5.0,My boyfriend loves it and the way it looks on me.  Very light and comfy.
5.0,"Loved it! If you can handle dark, gritty and a crazy ride, you will enjoy this book like I did!"
5.0,"It fit as expected, but not with much to give.  If you are between sizes, I'd round up.  Great top - love the open shoulders!"
5.0,"I bought this dress to be my mother’s burial garment. It worked out beautifully. I got the light blue because it was the color of her eyes. My dad loved her blue eyes, so this dress commemorates their love for each other. I wish I could say I got this dress for my mother to go dancing or some other happy occasion, but death is what we all must face, and she would have definitely approved of this dress to go to her earthly rest."
5.0,"don't know about durability, but the boots are great!  comfortable and not nearly as big and heavy as my boots in the past."
5.0,warm and comfy. love them.
5.0,Great chain like the color and the quality
5.0,I ise this for all my piercing it has a good grip and its big enough. Love this and it makes it so convenient to pierce
5.0,Gorgeous<br />Good value
5.0,"Bought it as a gift, so far looks good, will see if pass the test of time."
5.0,"I love these cotton pants, so far they have washed up nicely-this is my third pair. My first pair bright royal blue seemed to shrink in length after first wash as advised before wearing. I requested 2 inches be added to my purple and black pair. Seller accommodated my request and they are perfect in length before and after washing! Serging stitch of inside seams appears to be loosely done, hoping this stays in place after several washings."
5.0,"I got this ring for my daughter and she absolutely loves this ring! It is adjustable, durable, shiny, comfortable, and very stylish!"
5.0,Pretty and inexpensive.
5.0,"I bought these for my niece for christmas, she is 10 and she loved them."
5.0,"My 6 year old nephew is obsessed with Kobe Bryant. He asked for a Kobe jersey for Christmas, but since Kobe passed his merchandise is EXPENSIVE or it’s off the market altogether.<br /><br />This item was perfect for my nephew. It’s big since these are adult sizes, but he loves it and he’ll eventually grow into it."
5.0,My son got this for Christmas and loves it!! It was just what he was wanting!
5.0,Super comfy and cute. Good quality. I would buy this again.
5.0,"This item arrived on time and I damaged. It is of great quality, feels and looks great! It even fit as expected.<br /><br />I recommend the company and the product"
5.0,Love this! It is exactly what i was looking for
5.0,beautiful bag that is not too big.  Extremely well made.
5.0,It came in like it was supposed to I didn’t buy it for myself I got for my daughter however she likes it
5.0,"These slippers are great! They fit well, the material is soft, and there is enough cushion for comfort. The bottoms have enough traction so I am not sliding on the floor."
5.0,Beautiful gloves to wear with my lace dress!
5.0,"They are great in that they don't fall down or ride up. There's a little ""shelf"" under the chin to keep it in place. The nose can be pinched tight and the ears are adjustable.  And I can actually breathe in them.  I highly recommend."
5.0,"Bought for someone else, good price, and looked good."
5.0,This is a good quality item and I will purchase again.
5.0,"Classics.  The feel a little light, but I'll let you know how they perform next season as they were purchased as collapsible ski poles."
5.0,So many compliments on this dress! It can be a bit revealing so be fore warned! Other than that this dress is great!
5.0,"Great product. Very minimal socks that are not constricting (a big plus for someone who doesn't like socks). Almost like there is nothing there. The heel portion contains slim strips of rubber that keep the sock in place. As someone who had very low expectations, I was very surprised and delighted.<br /><br />As a point of reference, I wear these with Saucony Bullet shoes, and my foot size is 10.5. I have narrow feet with a wide toe area."
5.0,Most boys pajamas XL are 16/18 and after that you have to move to men's sizes which are often too long. 20's are hard to find. These are great quality and exactly as expected.
5.0,Thank God for this shirt. After the fiasco of my original shirt (from a different seller) not being expected. I found this beauty! It fits perfect! It's sleek and comfortable too and looked amazing in our family photos. The store had quick shipping
5.0,"Super cute! I did listen to the reviews and ordered a size up and I'm glad I did. I'm 5'6 and 120 pounds and the medium fits perfectly. It's definitely a crop top though, so stay away if crop tops aren't your thing."
5.0,They are so cute and fashionable<br />Great buy !!!!!!!!
5.0,"This was exactly what I was looking for. It's super cute, and also the perfect size (since I am a pretty small person). It's fits a surprising amount of stuff, including my tablet. It's also very comfortable to wear, and the material is thick and very durable. The only thing I don't love is that you really can't fit any normal water bottle in either of the side pockets - those wind up being more for pens or glasses or hand sanitizer (2020 lol). So you have to either put a water bottle in the main pocket or clip it on or carry it. I do wish more backpacks like these has actual water bottle holders. But oh well, everything else about this backpack is amazing."
5.0,"The glasses are ok for clip ons ,the packaging and cases that came with them are a great feature and bonus !!"
5.0,Perfect little earrings!
5.0,This is my second pair of these slippers and I’ll never wear anything else. They’re warm (but not too warm) and comfy on my wide feet; they stay on and don’t slide off. The only negative is that the little treads on the bottom come off; they aren’t attached securely. I just throw them away when they fall off; the slippers function just fine without them.
5.0,"Great fit, super comfortable & best of all WARM"
5.0,"This dress is super cute and a unique collection for my closet, it fits as expected and the quality of the fabric is great. No rips or tears or loose threads when arrived. The only thing I would warn about is how the straps are not fitted on. They work based on position. If you sit and slouch with this dress on they will easily slip off."
5.0,"I really like this bracelet because it is so unique.  It's fairly heavy but that's one of the things that I like about it, I'm pretty sure it won't break like other bracelets I have owned."
5.0,Great summer style for the fit bit versa 3! Comfortable and affordable :)
5.0,With those gloves easy to use a phone and you still can keep your arms warm. Love it
5.0,Looks good really nice perfect fit. Purchased a large. Washes well.
5.0,Almost 5 months and they still look like new. Exactly what I was looking for. I would say I will definitely buy again but I have a feeling I won’t need new slippers for a long time!
5.0,"The size was good, but a little lighter than expected."
5.0,It was a great buy it helped me so breaking nails 😊
5.0,So adorable and fancy! I love them!  The straps that go around the ankles are highly adjustable and fit my ankle even when it swells due to a medical issue.
5.0,Perfect for my baby boys one year old party!
5.0,I love how unique that are..
5.0,"Good quality, very pleasantly surprised."
5.0,"These have a great feel, perfect thickness-they are thick enough to not be shear but thin enough to still be comfortable. They also stay in place while running/exercising!"
5.0,"Added a bottle of wine, had Hotel staff put it in my son's room on their wedding night!!"
5.0,The smell of purse and material
5.0,Received this top and have already worn it 2 times.  Great length for leggings or skinny jeans and covers all the right areas without looking to over or frumpy.
5.0,Large was perfect for me.  I am six foot two and the item fit great!
5.0,"super agradables,  y causan mucho menos molestias en las orejas"
5.0,These look just like the picture. I wanna buy another pair because they are so cute and I lose earrings so frequently. I am quite clumsy.
5.0,"Bought for my wedding rehearsal, it's just like the picture. I'm 5'5&#34;, 135 lbs, 34C, and the small fits perfectly."
5.0,I bought this for my little granddaughter and she was happy with it. It looked fantastic on her.
5.0,Beautiful little belt.  Nice and stretchy!  Perfect for wearing over dresses and tops!  Love it!
5.0,Really great beach cover. Great quality
5.0,"These are the best things EVER! I can separate things out and keep them organized. They seemed flimsy at first, but they are super strong and durable. They also breathe so I am not worried about my clothes in plastic. I have tried other ones, but these by far take the cake!"
5.0,This was purchased as a gift and the recipient loved it! I would purchase from this seller again and it arrived before the listed dates.
5.0,Exactly what was wanted and needed. Nice sturdy belt.
5.0,great looking and great working
5.0,"Pajama time has never been so easy!! We love Sesame Street! Super soft and stretchy, breathable, great price!"
5.0,I got these for my boyfriend and he loved them. Great quality too!
5.0,Will keep you really warm during the winter.  Great price.  More than words can say.
5.0,It was just what I wanted
5.0,Very comfortable and good elasticity
5.0,Pretty good band and doesn't pull hair.
5.0,I really like this romper. It looks really nice on.
5.0,"Really like the fit of the Salomon Adv Sin 5L vest.  It sticks to you and breathes.  Super comfy, stretchy, and durable."
5.0,Well done. Good quality garment.
5.0,"I have always carried a large handbag for all my ""stuff"". I discovered these a few years ago and they are great. Three separate zippered compartments - the center one has lots of slots for credit cards and ids. I can actually get everything I need in a smaller bag. I even clip my key fob on the outside."
5.0,I bought in brown and another in grey.  The colors true. And I just love the way it fits. Gorgeous.
5.0,"Nice t-shirt.  Size is good, fit nice.  Love the color.  Material is a little thin but will be great for hot summer temps"
5.0,It is exactly what it looks like in the pictures!
5.0,I ordered a X large I'm 5'4 and I weigh 160 it was really cute but a little big
5.0,Pretty i like it
5.0,"Fits perfectly, great quality"
5.0,"Great length, lightweight, but perfect for work because they keep the a/c so cold. Loved it so much I got one for my mom too. And I’m thinking of buying a second one already"
5.0,Estoy muy contenta con mi compra y enamorada del color es hermoso 😍
5.0,"I love this dress. It fit beautifully, but be careful when you're putting it on to make sure the tank top straps (built in) are on your arms properly or else it may cause serve armpit discomfort."
5.0,"I LOVE this purse. Every time I wear it, I get several compliments!"
5.0,"I bought this a size bigger; so it would drag behind me as I walk...it fits great, the tie up chest helps.  Can't wait for the whole look to come together on Halloween night."
5.0,"I had been using a wallet-purse for a long time, then I changed purses.<br />I had money, credit cards, etc, all over the purse, couldn't find anything.<br />Then I bought this wallet at a great price. It has many slots for cards and ID's,<br />pictures, money and a big coin area.<br />It has so many areas to fill, I just can't fill them all. It is soft and a gorgeous color of purple (my favorite).<br />I have only used the wallet for a very short time, but it is already perfect. I can't wait to stuff it with more things, there is still a lot of room left."
5.0,"3 pack camo, love!"
5.0,Beautiful and loving. But I bought for a friend can not talking to something that does not use
5.0,The quality is great! The color is bright and vibrant and they feel very soft! My hubby really enjoys them.
5.0,Gave this to my grandson for Christmas. This was a huge success!! Fit was perfect.
5.0,cost so little looks pricey...mine again
5.0,two tiny beads fell off but the whole necklace is still beautiful!  I'd say this is a good buy!
5.0,"For those summer nights you don’t want a lot of material touching your skin<br />I’m 5 foot , 140lbs and 36C bust and a medium was great. I got the light blue and black color<br />The night gown is a little above my ankles which is perfect. Exactly what I was looking for."
5.0,This fit my wife beautifully and looked great on.  She said it was really comfortable
5.0,"Very comfortable, light weight and warm for cool weather."
5.0,A gift and the kid loved it. Big fan of Judge
5.0,fit perfectly and at a much cheaper price is well worth the buy
5.0,I got these to start working out in. And wanted to dry fit shirt. Too expensive in the box stores. I love them so much went back and bought every color they had. Only wish they had some that had the finger loop. I do not like things tight. Please do come with a certain form fitting though I don’t think there’s any way around that. I normally wear a medium to large depending on style. I got a large.
5.0,"These earrings are absolutely beautiful!!  I just wish they were on a silver wire instead of gold!!!!  But other than that, absolutely stunning!!!!"
5.0,Great buy.Look expensive  but not!
5.0,Grand is doing gymnastics but has to wear a mask so a little fun
5.0,The minnie ears had sparkle!
5.0,"Wow! Great bag! Needed an everything bag for a cruise. We stuffed towels, sunscreen, souvenirs, water bottles,etc. and still had lots of room. Lots of compliments from other cruisers and a crew member about how accommodating it was. Can easily be washed if it gets soiled. Handy little inside zippered case that is attached to the inside for cell phones or cash. Love it!"
5.0,My Grandson Noah loves Cobra Kai Shirt! Made Nice! Great Quality! You'll love it too!
5.0,"Adidas quality at a great price. Doesn't shrink or fade in the wash and color is true Vols orange, made well, thick, quality cotton."
5.0,"Got three of these for my kids and they love them! Perfect size for all of them ages 10,8, and 5."
5.0,Such a fun dress! Get compliments every time I wear it!
5.0,Great outfit for summer. Material nice. Fit perfect. Unique looking garment. A little hammer pants but extremely cool. Go for it!
5.0,Gift for granddaughter with clothes too. Shh! she loves her new undies too.
5.0,These are so comfortable and soft.  These wear a bit bigger than expected but I still like them.  They are comfortable and done roll down like some underwear do.
5.0,I was surprised that they fit so well with having an size 10 shoe
5.0,"Love this robe, feels like a light weight sweat shirt!"
5.0,Very nice. Hat.
5.0,It's so thin my daughter loves them.
5.0,This one fits great and I love the colors.
5.0,"Nice shoes that fit great, the Velcro is great, no untied shoe laces."
5.0,"I ditched my regular ""slippers"" and only wear these lovelies.  More comfortable than regular slippers, and stylish enough to wear all day, around the house, to the store, on the go.  Don't know how they will hold up in water, but I will find out as soon as I find a beach. I plan to order a pair in every color."
5.0,Dress fits as expected! Beautiful dress
5.0,"I love how this fits!  I’m 5’2, 127 lbs - I ordered a medium and it’s perfect.  I’m ordering another one!"
5.0,"I’m 5’4 160 lbs and got a large and they fit perfectly. High wasted and stop just above the ankle, super comfortable. Recommend if you have short legs."
5.0,"I got medium size, but was large. I am 36B-C. So, I got small size and fit perfect"
5.0,Love this outfit. It fits my daughter perfectly. And its true to size.
5.0,This is super cute for a nice fall day to wear with jeans or could wear with leggings for more casual look. I bought it in red.. purchased the green for my sister.. and tan for my mom. Great for everyone who tries it!
5.0,Watch is durable and comfortable. I would buy another one!
5.0,I love this bag. It's lightweight and roomy with inner and outer compartments. But it's not one of those bags where you can't find things because of too many storage areas. I had to order a second one for a friend because she fell in love with mine.
5.0,I get a lot of compliments on it! I'm a massage therapist & wash my hands a lot & the water doesn't get trapped under the ring.
5.0,A very nice watch.  I can wear it with either my gold or silver jewelry.
5.0,"I bought a set of these as a gift last year for my daughter and she was thrilled and liked them very much.  However, she lost the back of one of them and was pretty disappointed.  So, I purchased another set for her this year, which gives her some spare parts in case it happens again.  The catch does seem a bit loose to me, so I would suggest adjusting the tension a bit before wearing."
5.0,"Solid metal, exactly as pictured. Good size and thickness. Don’t have any complaints."
5.0,Not too big and not too small!
5.0,These are quality and easy to put on with the large back piece. Great packaging!
5.0,Shirt fits excellent and looks absolutely amazing. Nothing bad to say about this!
5.0,Beautiful addition to your wardrobe.
5.0,"I love it!!! My only joke I can remember the punchline is about a snail taking a ride on the turtle's back and the green is absolutely beautiful and I couldn't have picked a better self gift for me (Green is the color for people with GP) and this absolutely charming tank will help me to keep my spirits up. The only thin I am concerned about is the material used for the graphics, but I will hand wash and hang to dry to keep it!"
5.0,The fabric is soft and is true to size. I am 150lbs 5'6&#34;. It looks dressy.
5.0,The color and size for two pairs of glasses.
5.0,"Fits nice around my wrist and keeps my watch secure. Plus it’s Star Wars themed, what could be better?!"
5.0,Love the suit but it's too small for my busy size.
5.0,Real nice earrings
5.0,My son wears this all the time!  It keeps its color well and the netting hasn't snagged either.
5.0,very nice light weight sweater
5.0,I love it and it looks great!
5.0,"This beanie comes on time and fits as expected. I used this for a Halloween costume DIY, and though it wasn't super big, I knew how large it would be. If using this for a DIY or if you have a large head, BEWARE: Check the length and width. Somewhere in the description will be the length and width of the beanie, and for everyone I would recommend you measure the length and width out on a ruler so you know all the dimensions before buying and so you can visually see how the beanie will fit for you. I did that before purchasing and when it arrived, I wasn't surprised; I knew it wouldn't be a large beanie. Great though!"
5.0,"Lightweight fit, no glare, color, comfortable"
5.0,"This hat was a great value and worked out perfectly for our 7 year old at the beach.  We measured his head circumference with a fabric tape measure and ordered the corresponding size.  It fits perfectly.  A bit of wind does not take it off his head, and it's not too tight.  Just right."
5.0,Very nice quality.  Fast delivery.
5.0,Muy buena prenda para dormir
5.0,"Great tie and tie bars, love it!"
5.0,Awesome<br />Kids loved them and they worked perfect
5.0,My niece loves it. Diversity needed in the various types of keychain but yoy don't have to use it... can use your own
5.0,I especially liked the expandable waistband as I generally use these types of shorts while cruising and I’ve found that sea air makes you gain weight. Lol. They seem to be fairly well made. They’re probably not as good as more expensive brands but that’s to be expected.
5.0,I have really picky feet when it comes to socks. These socks worked really well for me when wearing boots. Good moisture wicking.
5.0,"Works, serves the intended purpose."
5.0,"These loose fit jogger pants are just what I was looking for. They hang a little baggy and loose with a cuffed leg hem that makes the shape billow out a bit. I got a size small pair and they definitely have extra room for anyone looking for more room in the pants yet are still a nice loose fit on a smaller frame. I'm 5' so I appreciate the cinching the bottom cuff taking some length off the bottom and making them ready to wear without any alterations for me.<br />I love the olive green color. It's a great variation of a neutral.<br />Nice to have pockets. They add to the shape and form as well as being a handy feature to place your hands in the upper side pockets, and place something more substantial in the larger cargo style pockets below.<br />T"
5.0,"This was almost like wearing nothing in the perfect accent to cover my arms, it’s made well and it was perfect"
5.0,I ended up getting two caps exactly the same color....military caps told me to send theirs back and they would exchange it for a black cap...I mailed their cap back over a week ago and have not heard from them...could you check on it for me?  thanks....the cap I have is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone who served in the 1st armored ....Ed Mansfield
5.0,Great for my shoes
5.0,Perfect for your aviation lovers
5.0,Longer than I expected but absolutely lovely andffun to wear
5.0,"So I ordered a T-shirt that just came in and I really like the fit.  So much so that I want to order another with the exact same fit.  But there doesn't seem to be any way to use your previous fit details, you have to start over again - which means there's a chance the fit won't be exactly the same.  Idiots!  Great tools, great products, and terrible fulfillment!!!  Come on guys!<br /><br />UPDATE:  While there is no ""Re-order Here"" button, I did discover that you can re-order by clicking the button labeled ""Make My T-shirt"" -  same button you clicked to start the measuring process initially.  Not very intuitive, but I still really like the shirt!"
5.0,Earrings look very nice and not cheap at all.
5.0,"Love how well this bikini fits.  The fabric is very nice and comfy.  Will be wearing this when on vacation, also just around the house too.  Feels nice under a dress especially the bottoms.  Highly recommend Beachsissi. The quality is good."
5.0,The kids love them for their bracelets
5.0,"You can't beat a dress that's cute, comfortable, and has pockets! The color is a lighter grey than it looks online, but it's okay. The material is light and rather thin (making it a great summer bum-about dress), but it's not see-through as long as you're not posing in front of a bright light. The style is nice a simple, but interesting enough not to be plain. This is what I consider a wardrobe staple and would be a good one to have in multiple colors. You could do so much with it depending on your accessories and be comfortable doing it."
5.0,"Sturdy belt that doesn’t loosen . Not sure what these other reviewers expected, Yes the belt is stiff at first but it becomes more pliable the more you wear it ."
5.0,I bought this skirt as a piece to a costume but I actually LOVE it and wear it all the time. Fit is true to size. I have also washed and dried it and it has held up well.
5.0,"I love this strap 100x more than the one my original pebble came with. Since this is a men's watch band and I'm a 26 year old 120lb female, I was worried about the fit. But, I wear this on the 2nd tightest notch and it fits perfect. After a few months, there's still no signs of wear and tear. I was looking for something sleek, waterproof that I could wear swimming, working out, but also look good when I dress up. This fits all the criteria and I know it will last a very long time."
5.0,Husband bought me this desss. Perfect for around the house or casual day at the office!
5.0,"This is a really nice shirt.  It is very long, so be prepared for that, and it runs big.  I have to send it back and unfortunately, the color it bought is no longer available. The quality of the material is great.  I’m sad I can’t get this color again."
5.0,"This product was just what I expected. Fits well, comfortable and warm."
5.0,I use them for running
5.0,I'm 6' and it can be rough to get something that fits my torso right but this is great. The material is super nice and has just that right kind of tightness. It feels really durable too. I really like this
5.0,Absolutely love this!!  Gorgeous!  Have had so many compliments!  The earrings are clip - just as an FYI.
5.0,"Made people wonder if I’m smart like that. I always tell ‘em, ya graduated top of the class. The ole thing fit good, would recommend."
5.0,"Very comfortable and so very bright!  I always like bright underclothes-makes me smile when I get dressed.  These do fit a little on the small side.  I was hesitant to get the Large/X-Large when medium is usually loose on me but after reading reviews I decided the larger size would be better and I am very glad I did.  The material is pretty stretchy but I don't like anything too tight fitting.  One caution, I can't  wear these under my workout clothes without a little line around the legs being visible because as you move around a lot the legs will ride up a little and bunch but it isn't a big deal.  It only shows up under my yoga pants, not jeans or sweats.  Once again, super comfortable."
5.0,"Great products for picking up objects out of reach.  Note that these can pick up objects much heavier than regular grabbers, but they will still crack at the joint if you try to lift something too heavy (a gallon of water, for example)."
5.0,"This is an attractive infinity and beanie set.  The lightweight fluffy pom-pom on top of the beanie gives it a whimsical feel.  I cuff the beanie when wearing it and it fits just fine.  In fact, if the beanie is not cuffed, it feels too large.  It's warm and comfortable - I have no complaints.  Both the maroon and tan look equally attractive."
5.0,Love the words and colors.  Vibrant.  They make nice gifts.
5.0,Nice skirt... would order other colors.
5.0,"Nice fitting.. suits well on me, nice color, nice material. I am so happy made this purchase"
5.0,"Great buy...I slapped it right on a 22 mm Jules Jurgensen chronograph.  Good quality with easy link removal and and adjusting.  The repair block with pin removing tool was a bonus.  It complimented the time pieces style, up until getting this, my chronograph looked clumsy...like I'd strapped a hockey puck on my wrist with a &#34;zip tie.&#34;"
5.0,These lenses are excellent! I was able to remove the old and install the new lenses. They have a snug fit. UV rays are blocked. I couldn’t ask for more!
5.0,"I love these! Nice and long. The material isn’t too bulky, actually light and soft. Arrived quickly. So comfy!"
5.0,Soft and comfortable. It would be great if we could get the v-neck in long sleeve too.
5.0,"This is an Easter gift, not sure how it will fit until then but quality looks good and came as it said it would."
5.0,"fits great, size is accurate"
5.0,"Came on time, great quality"
5.0,"I absolutely love these sunglasses and I am so glad I purchased them.They are very stylish( classic black and white design) an chic and can go with any outfit. Along with the beautiful sunglasses you get a protective hard case, a soft case and a tool kit. The lenses are polarized, glare eliminating and block 100% of UVA an UVB rays. They are very comfortable to wear and I have been compliment many time while wearing them.<br /><br />** Major plus is that for every product sold by this company, they give an exam, sunglasses, and glasses to someone in need."
5.0,"great fit, great fabric."
5.0,very nice!  Grandma was thrilled with this product.
5.0,The pins are very good quality and larger than expected.  Just a bit less than 3” wide.  They will be a nice gift at Christmas.
5.0,"Not kidding. This great necklace will get you noticed in a good way. The wolf spear itself is quality. The plasticy string it came on; not so much. Switch it out with a silver chain or a leather necklace. I wore it for maybe 2 hours after purchasing it, went out and saw some friends and every girl I came in contact loved it. It's a great, masculine piece of jewelry that should be bought by any guy wanting to stand out....in a good way."
5.0,"Beautiful and sexy.  I bought this for an outdoor concert and it's amazing, shows a little skin but not too much and it really accentuates your curves in a good way.  The fabric is thick and comfortable, however since it's white the butt is a little sheer and you should wear probably wear a nude slip or some boy shorts with it.<br /><br />I am 5'2 and 125 lbs and the medium fits, but I could comfortably go down a size for a tighter fit."
5.0,"This is absolutely adorable. I surprised my husband with a cat girl outfit and I feel like this added an extra touch of quality that showed my effort to make the outfit nice. It's pretty, sturdy, well-made and the jingling sound it makes it is cute. I love it."
5.0,How the dress for me and the price of dress
5.0,wife absolutely loves them  very nice product and it allows a personal touch to her scrubs
5.0,Backpack purse zipper.
5.0,Ordered these for my twin sons and the pants were consistently sized and fit well. The inside of the waistband has a small tacky part to help keep them up which is a nice compliment to their belts.<br /><br />Our boys got into the creek after their first game and the white pants got so dirty I was pretty upset with them. I was pleasantly surprised how well they cleaned up after some scrubbing and a wash.
5.0,"I recently purchased a &#34;Gun Tote'n Mamma's&#34; X-Body Smart Phone Pouch which is a small, cross-body, concealed/carry purse...very small. My WalletBe accordion wallet fit okay, but since it holds IDs and cards in a &#34;stacked&#34; fashion, it created a big &#34;pregnant&#34; bump in the middle of the purse.  I don't particularly like purses to begin with, but, Ugh!  After many trips to the various local stores to find a wallet that would accommodate all my wallet needs, everything I could find were too big for the purse...either too long or too wide...or didn't have the storage features I was seeking.  I initially had the same problem with Amazon until I came across this Visconti wallet.  It's PERFECT.  It's loaded with card slots; has a roomy, zippered, double pocket that holds my cash and my phone; has an internal zippered pocket for change and such; and has five other pockets for whatever you could need them for.  It's leather, looks nice enough to carry sans purse and is quality construction without being outrageously priced. AND it fits the &#34;Gun Tote'n Mamma's&#34; X-Body Smart Phone Pouch like a hand in a glove. Even when filled with all my stuff. The only thing missing (only because it doesn't come with one) is a wrist-let."
5.0,Fit was perfect and i was surprised at how good of quality materials. It is very comfortable as well.
5.0,great quality .

5.0,I'm so glad I didn't listen to the reviews I actually ordered up a size I'm usually a large  12-14 I went with the Xl and it is PERFECT !!!!!
5.0,The grinders are made very sturdy..I have been using them for a few weeks and have no complaints.
5.0,"These are very well made, they dont pick every piece of my hair in the wash like other boxers (mabe the fabric?), and they feel great."
5.0,I just love the items from The Barrel Shack.  This bag is EVERYTHING the description described it as. I was able to buy this bag at a fraction of the retail price on DealDash.com. I just love a great deal and this bag was a fantastic one.
5.0,Very comfortable and free of &#34;break in &#34;period. I love them. I will be getting some spray to waterproof for the wet weather. Fit perfect( I am a 10 ) no matter what socks I wear. I love them.
5.0,Beautiful color and comfortable dress. Inexpensive as well. May order in other colors.

5.0,"I LOVE this dress! Thank you! It arrived when it said it would, it is beautiful!!!"
5.0,A great buy I would like to have had an option for a longer chain though.
5.0,My daughter love it! She always using it to school!
5.0,Daughter joined ROTC and can only wear silver color studs. Perfect for military women who have sensitive ears.
5.0,Thank you for the reviews that suggested ordering up two sizes. I did and it fits perfectly. Good quality fabric.
5.0,"Love this hat, especially because of my favorite skateboard company, Creature all the way."
5.0,I love this dress it fitted great.
5.0,"I love these men’s sheer socks, so thin and elegant, I wear them with my loafers and office attire for work, very comfortable and soft to the touch, I get lots of compliments at work from both male and female co workers, would definitely buy again"
5.0,"Loved them everything stayed nice and neat and wrinkle free, was able to fit everything  in suitcase plus had room left over and that’s a first."
5.0,"Very good for sleeping. Shorts are short, so maybe don't go outside to check the mail, but the fit is great for bed. My husband approves the set and says it is cute. The fabric washes well and seems like it will hold up to frequent washes. The material is also breathable so that I don't sweat at night. I choose the charcoal grey and the color is great."
5.0,Purchased as a gift to brighten someone’s day!  They loved it!  Thank you!
5.0,We got this as a gift. My sister loved it!
5.0,"Paint them orange if you're a beginner. Despite the brilliant finish they are easy to lose.<br /><br />I learned to throw knives with these, would suggest them to any beginner."
5.0,"Perfect fit and perfect comfort. They are a great pair of shorts to wear around the house in the winter, and probably early spring and late fall."
5.0,Great necklace. It made for the perfect Valentine's Day gift.
5.0,Love this keychain it's so pretty and it hasn't broken yet and I have had it for a couple months.
5.0,These are exactly what I wanted. Warm and comfy.
5.0,Excellent quality and nice style. Very comfortable and btw arrived instantly
5.0,"Really cute! White one is see through though, but I don't care that much for this price. Fabric is nice and the print is so cute!"
5.0,"I was looking for something to keep the sweat out of my eyes.  These work great, very absorbing, stay in place and are machine washable."
5.0,"Super cute top! fits pretty well, I did expect it would be a little smaller but it is acceptable I ordered a med but I could have gone with a small. I used the size chart and per it, I should be a medium ( I am 5'5 120 lbs ) But a little big is better than too small I suppose.  So anyway top washes very well easy care no issues there.  Lays nicely when paired with shorts or jeans.  I ordered the green and it's just at pictured very very nice if you like the color. no fading or wrinkling. Order arrived timely in excellent condition would recommend. good price"
5.0,"I was very excited to find a belt that wasn't made from leather and that looked like it might fit a smaller waist. Upon arrival, it smelled a bit funny- sort of plastic-y. The smell went away after wearing it for a day, so it's ok. It fits my 25in waist great! Not too tight, but tight enough to be cute. I love that it has a two-snap closure instead of velcro or something equally as stupid. Very cute belt that's definitely worth the price, in my opinion."
5.0,A rotator cuff surgery
5.0,Love these! They are so much bigger then I imagined! Great buy!
5.0,"This sweater fit well, very low cut, definitely need to wear a tank top under it."
5.0,"I’m a walker, and wear a protective hat always.  These are perfect, as I have long hair and its much more comfortable to put my hair through the hole in the back of the hat.  I would highly recommend purchasing these hats."
5.0,"Unique, fits well, comfortable."
5.0,"Good fit. Cuff it to keep warmer, or tuck it during the spring / fall in the south. Good price. What’s not to like?"
5.0,I got this for my daughter who loves K-pop for Christmas and she was very happy with it.  I'd recommend it.
5.0,Love them!  Came in exactly as I expected.
5.0,Love it!! I have 4 children and definitely don't have the body I once did but this swimsuit does wonders for my tummy area. Comfortable and covers what I want covered.
5.0,I got this hoodie for my cousin and he loves it!
5.0,The uv rays are great I will be ordering more love the sun glasses.
5.0,Good material nice and soft good fit... it's not sweat shirt material it's t shirt material.. it has a double hoodie one gray one purple and it's attached...it has hidden side pockets...and the buttons coming off the neck are just for showing...nice everyday ware...
5.0,"Use the inside cloth first then the outside cloth to polish.  Works beautifully, don't wash it."
5.0,Really like the dress... it hugs you in all the right spots to show off you assets. Very comfortable
5.0,"Perfect for what I needed. I have two wireless headsets for my Xbox and Playstation that have been finding homes all over my room. This is a budget friendly, and efficient fix to give them a proper home without putting holes in your wall. The adhesive feels strong and reliable, and the holders have a small lip at the end to prevent your headset from sliding off. Plus they look great. I also love that this came with a set of two by default."
5.0,Fits great and price is perfect. Looks great too
5.0,Absolutely  love this piece from a true Cali native living abroad.
5.0,These are pretty sweet glasses! Really nice for the cost and feel like great quality
5.0,"Wore to a pool party and was so hot, material holds heat. But it's beautiful on. Versatile"
5.0,"Saw this on the app Poshmark. Someone was selling it new in their boutique for some outrageous amount like $30! Looked it up here and was aghast at the difference in price.<br /><br />Bought it for my daughter and her friend, as they are both huge fans of Billie Eilish. It’s their friendship necklace and they loved it.<br /><br />FYI: The “rope” is plastic, but they both have nice clasps. Not for little kids of course. Just treat them gently and they will hold up well."
5.0,Great look and feeling band
5.0,So glad to find some spacers for my Pandora leather wrap bracelet! You have to use the rubber o rings with those bracelets. Some of these weren't my style (came with every bead shown so I knew that ahead of time) but I'll just pass them along to someone who could use them but the ones that were more &#34;me&#34; are very nice! Something for everyone!
5.0,Great jeans. My husband really likes them and they fit him well.
5.0,Perfectly fit my 6-month-old nephew and still has some stretch to fit him when he's older.
5.0,They were like 2 sized too big for my son. I sent them back
5.0,The colors and quality was great for the price of the tops. They are tag less this no Irritation. I love the stretch in the tops as well as the length. It cover but still allows for a peek of skin.
5.0,"I really like this umbrella. It was super easy to assemble and I was pleasantly surprised that the colors are more vivid than pictured. I only got it yesterday, so I can't comment on how sturdy it is. Today the price is $41.99, which is a steal. I paid $59.99 and only got it yesterday and so far that's the only thing I'm unhappy about."
5.0,I wore this to college the other day. It is a beautiful tunic. I love it.
5.0,"Like other reviews have said, I was quite impressed with the quality of the pendant. A solid and sturdy masculine piece that's well up to the task of holding the ashes of a beloved one. It came with a nice chain and very easy instructions for use. Perhaps better than receiving the pendant itself was the customer service. I was sent the wrong style and sent an email asking to exchange it for the correct one. I was immediately contacted, told to keep it, and sent the correct one all in a few days! I was very impressed by their prompt response, wonderful handling, and beautiful product. Thanks again!"
5.0,Fit great. They are a little heavier than compression shorts so work well by themselves. I’ll buy another pair.
5.0,Very good product. It's a cute little keychain
5.0,"I absolutely love these!<br />Friends, family, and dates think it's the real deal lol I get so many compliments and definitely some new fans<br />They're definitely stretch-able, just be careful as too much and anything could break (bending = heat = break)<br /><br />I take them out when I blow my nose... I'm not that invested in the &#34;image&#34; lol<br /><br />Didn't come in exactly the same pairs as they have in the image, and ended up with one dud (broken, captive ring style ring) but all-in-all, I'm delighted -especially for the price- and spend serious time choosing between them before I leave for the day lol"
5.0,Beautiful necklace 😍
5.0,It looks just like the picture! It's incredibly long on me (but at 4'11 I'm used to it...will need to cut about 5-6 inches). The material is also more forgiving than I thought it would be. It seems to run a big large but I have no problem with that as it still has a beautiful shape. I was going to return it simply because I would loose a lot of the pretty mermaid bottom hemming it but I'm going to have them take some material from the midsection instead.
5.0,"I read several reviews before I purchased this dress. They were all correct. This is the softest, most comfortable dress. I love it."
5.0,Love the dress ❤️
5.0,No nickel allergy with these so a major plus on my vote.
5.0,Fits comfortably under clothes and it’s is pretty.
5.0,Clasp and rings durable and look nice. Material around neck is not slippery and has a good texture to it that is comfortable.
5.0,"I love these. They fit both me(I have a lot of thick, naturally coily black hair) and my husband. They are very comfortable and stay on all night while I sleep. The colors are true to the pics and very adjustable for fit to accommodate for different diameters of the size of our heads...Very fast shipping and packed very, very nicely. Each one individually packed, then all are packed together into a 2nd plastic zippy thing. Great purchase"
5.0,Very nice even better than expected. Super soft and warm
5.0,"Love love love it. True to fit. Soft material. Kinda on the thin side, but perfect for hot NC summers. Colors are vibrant. Comfortable fit. I'm 5'7&#34; 145lbs  and brought medium."
5.0,This shirt is my grandsons favorite! It fits perfectly!
5.0,"I love the softness of the material, it feels so good against my skin."
5.0,What a pretty wide brimmed straw hat. I like that there were gradients of blue on this hat which gave it a sophisticated look. I went to Chicago for 4th of July weekend and this was a perfect hat that I could roll up when I wasn’t using. It was wide enough to block out the harmful rays of the sun! The quality was well made. Want to get more colors!
5.0,Love these. Look adorable
5.0,"Exactly as described, nice fit"
5.0,"Perfect product, high quality for the price and the details are incredible."
5.0,"very pretty color, lighter than picture"
5.0,"The wife loves dachshunds and loves this little pendant, too! She is very happy with it and wears it several times a week."
5.0,Bought this for my son's teacher for Christmas. The packaging for it was beautiful and it is very soft and stylish.
5.0,"Good quality, very nice crystals"
5.0,Go for it.
5.0,The details and the shine was excellent. I would definitely buy a hornet version in a heartbeat if they had one!
5.0,This guitar strap was easy to put on and seems to be very durable this lets me hold my guitar on strange angles without having for me to worry it may fall.
5.0,"My son loves these shoes. He says they are comfortable, and easy to get on. He seems to like under amour shoes better than others."
5.0,"I just wanna drive dangerously when I wear these! Just kidding... Seriously though. I feel like Ryan Gosling in Drive or the Transporter or something. These gloves are amazing. They provide good grip on the steering wheel and have this expensive and high quality feel to them. They even came in a fancy suede bag! Shipping was also a lot faster than expected. About a week fast.<br />They do fit a little weird though. I mean I got the right size and it's a very nice fit and it fits great.<br />It might be because my hands aren't too wide, but the knuckle holes are weirdly spaced. They fit good on my first three knuckles, but on my pinky knuckle it goes almost to the side of my hand.<br />All in all though, these are amazing gloves, and for $30, they're quite a steal. Very happy with the purchase."
5.0,"These pants are amazing!! I've been searching for Capri leggings in stores locally with no luck at all. I found these and thought for the price it was worth giving them a shot. I'm so glad I did. I will be ordering more. They fit great, they are comfy and they are not see through."
5.0,Earrings exactly as pictured. Excellent craftmanship.
5.0,"The pockets are useful for cell phone and listening to music while exercising, and the material is soft.  I ordered the x-small because that's my usual size and ignored the waist suggestion (my waist is 28"") and it was totally fine... they are actually a bit loose in the hip/butt area (my hip measurement is 32.75"").  The price is pretty normal for the product... they are basically just leggings with pockets.  Good for working out or wearing around the house."
5.0,"She loved it.  Fits greats, really comfy, washes well!"
5.0,The bracelet is just as gorgeous as my diamond jewelry. It was delivered quickly! It is breath taking! I have only one complaint. Now I want one in every color!
5.0,Great at all.
5.0,nice blouse-  dry clean only tho
5.0,Installation was fast and easy ! Compatible with all clog type shoes ! I like that these are different and have a smiley face on them definitely hooked my kid up with new smiley face rivets and he loooooves !
5.0,"Really big watch, still gorgeous though. I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he really likes it. It keeps time well, no loss or gain of time that's been noticable."
5.0,I love the bulky look and so warm. It’s great with almost anything.
5.0,I Love this watch it was a little to big . . .
5.0,The product is great! I love the material and the built in bra- it just didn't fit me. I'm 5'4&#34; and weigh 123. I got the large based on other's reviews.  My torso is too short for that leotard. This often happens to me so.......
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful, perfect size, decently comfortable, impressive packaging. Really like how it comes with its own box. Little difficult to change the time, but that’s ok. Definitely a fine addition to my collection."
5.0,"These little things are awesome, have a bit of a weight to them. I hadn't worn them yet. I purchased in advance so when I do get a piercing, and ready to switch them out when healed. But for the price, I cant complain. Over all, love the appearance, and as far as shipping, got them extremely fast."
5.0,Thus seller was on it. Came in super quick. Watch band fit perfectly.
5.0,Love this necklace.  Its nice and light weight and looks exactly like the picture.
5.0,"This shirt was really good to express your love of the Eagles winning the super bowl. The quality of the shirt wasn't 5 stars, but it was definitely 4.5 stars."
5.0,Stunning for the price!!
5.0,Love this dress in red! Super cute. Fits great. I have a large bust and it is a bit tight there but if I ordered a Large I don't think it would have been as flattering everywhere else. Love the pockets. The material is great too....not see through at all.
5.0,"I thought these were gonna feel and look cheap, but they are really nice. They fit exactly as expected so you have no hesitation there. For the price point these are fantastic. And please note that it’s 70% cotton and 30% linen but they do feel very light and airy, these are perfect for a warm climate environment"
5.0,Love the goth look it gives my peacock-blue pedicured toes!
5.0,Oh my super sexy fit. Great
5.0,Arrived on time and the bags were so cute. I love them and will purchase more soon. Thank you
5.0,Comes with everything you need to make a princess no dress but that’s okay! I still love it and they do to!!!
5.0,"Purchased this dress in XL, although I usually wear size 12/Large in dresses.  5'4, 155lbs., and the fit of the XL is perfect. I usually have a hard time with this style of dress hitting in the right spot - I can easily look pregnant if the waist hits too high, or the waist sits right under my boobs, which is not a flattering look.  In this dress, the waist hits in just the right spot to hide belly bulge. I would love it more if this was in a different material, but for the price, style, and cut, it works just fine.  Very happy!"
5.0,This dress is so beautiful! It fits really good. I am 5'5 & 175lbs. I got an XL. With heels it's a perfect fit.
5.0,excellent for training and going out it's worth the price and the fabric is very good I've been with them for months and they are as if they had arrived yesterday recommended
5.0,"I wanted it for a fall jacket for my grand-daughter, its perfect."
5.0,"Really great cardigan, well made, very soft and thick enough to keep you warm on a chilly day.  It's not too thick that you can't wear it under a jacket as I bought it so I can dress in layers. I am 5'7&#34; and ordered a size medium and it fits perfectly.  It is made slim in the arm so that is something to take in consideration.  I am very happy with this purchase!"
5.0,Ordered 2 of those for my daughters to wear at their band concert. While they have a strict uniform they can sometimes add accessories and bow ties. These were perfect and both my 13 & 15 yr old girls absolutely LOVED them! As did their friends who continually commented with compliments! Definitely a great purchase!!
5.0,"These are so comfortable, that I bought 4 more."
5.0,Our wedding colors are<br />Navy and gray. I wanted to have some blue on and decided to look for earrings. These are<br />GORGEOUS! very bling- so don't get unless you want to be a showstopper ... Definitely good to pair with classic simple hair as to not overdo your look. Definitely a good value.
5.0,"I love these shades. They feel high quality and are polarized. The gold accents look beautiful and high end, and I get compliments on them each time I wear them. I'll definitely buy a back-up pair."
5.0,The blouse fits perfect! It’s beautiful
5.0,My niece loves Paris and loved this as a Christmas gift. Got her the beret as well!
5.0,They are amazing like it has the best quality for the summer and it's not to baggy but a manageable size. Recommend buying hundred percent 👍🏻
5.0,The item was shipped quickly a good.quality and fit as it should.
5.0,Very nice.  High-end looking.
5.0,These are very cute and detailed. They’re kind of heavy though so I won’t be putting them on my keychain
5.0,I ordered for my wife and just loves them.
5.0,These gloves are amazing! Better than I expected! 👌🏽 Very warm and fits snuggling. Love them!
5.0,I love this dress. it is very good quality for the price.  It runs small. I tried a medium but wore the large. I am usually a Medium. I am 5’4. 120 pounds and 34 DD.  The length was great on me. The hem hit the floor on one side but it didn’t affect my mobility. On a taller woman it would be fine too.
5.0,This dress is even prettier in person I’m blown away😍
5.0,This hat is cute and fashionable. Good quality and it arrived on time !  Would clearly recommend this product !
5.0,"Firstly, the quality of this dress is unbelievably fantastic as it is of great quality.  Secondly, the dress is well made as it delivers a great fit.  I am 5""3 with a bust size of 36D and the medium which I ordered fits like a glove. The only considerations are are the length as it falls below the knee and the bust may need to be pinned as it may be low cut depending on the wearer.  I could not have made a better purchase.  A very classy, elegant and well-made piece of clothing."
5.0,"Love love love this dress, looks great on And material is great. I ordered a large but will be ordering an xl next time."
5.0,Super cute! Nice fit. V neck is cute and not too low.
5.0,These are very cute. $10 for four. PTA charged $15 for one. Love that I don't have to put my mask down on  table.
5.0,"This corset is so nice. I had a full corset before and it was so uncomfortable ( and yes, I know they are supposed to be, but still...) So I got this one. Its definately not sure shaping so much as it is for looks. I got it for my renaissance festival outfit and it works perfectly. I normally wear a size 1x-2x in shirts and I got this in a 6x. It fits really well. Probably could've gotten a 5x, cause I can tighten this as much as it goes and its still a tiny bit loose right under my bust area, but you can't really tell if you are just looking at me. Attached are pictures of my original corset and a with this one."
5.0,Ordered this for a clockwork orange Halloween costume. Did the trick.
5.0,I love it perfect size for my purse
5.0,I got this hat for my BF’s birthday and he loves it. Great color and comfortable fit. His head is on the larger side and it fit perfectly. Please stock more Project Rock stuff!
5.0,Very comfortable and well fitted dress
5.0,"The DENSREE Micro Modal Boxers are the way that boxers should be. Featuring a super comfortable modal/polyester blend of materials, quality construction and ergonomic design, every man should try on a pair of DENSREE’s Micro Modal Boxers.<br /><br />The photo shows the open four pack of DENSREE Micro Modal Boxers. There are four colors to suit the occasion. DENSREE Micro Modal Boxers are cleverly designed to separate the male parts for maximum comfort.  The front pouch allows freedom to stretch out while the pouches below provide ventilation and support.  As a result, the experience of wearing DENSREE Micro Modal Boxers is like no other for the comfort and confidence it gives me. I like that.<br /><br />I highly recommend DENSREE Micro Modal Men's Boxers to everyone."
5.0,"I’ve purchased three of these now. First purchase was directly from them, 1 adult and 1 child. The child was for my large 3 year old and the other was mine or my husbands. I’m very petite. My head is small and generally adult/one size items don’t fit me well. The adult fit me, but not well. The kids was perfect. The adult became my husbands who’s “average” size and I ordered another kids for me from amazon. They wash well with no special treatment (I wash it along with everything else). My husband works outside in the inland northwest. He wears his a lot and loves it."
5.0,"They work perfect, I have bought multiple different brands , and this one was perfect for my grandad"
5.0,I originally order this shirt in blue and I loved it so much I ordered the pink one.
5.0,"Solid sunglasses. A little bigger than expected which is a good thing. They have a bit of weight to them, and are not flimsy. Polarized lenses are decent, but not as dark as I'd hoped. Highly recommend there if you're looking for good quality, low cost sunglasses."
5.0,This is a high quality bracelet.  Better quality than what I expected it to be but ROCK ON!  Thanks!  My husband is going to love it for Christmas!
5.0,Love the selection.
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress! I was worried about the material being see through since it's white, but the material is thicker than expected and nothing shows! Fits wonderfully and is a great length."
5.0,This is my 2nd top. The first one I washed on delicate. Line dried! But I ruined it...I was shocked and sad...<br />never dawned on me to look at the tag....this top has to be DRY CLEANED!  I did buy a 2nd one because I got so many compliments on it!
5.0,Lucky shirt
5.0,My granddaughter loves this mask.  It is too big for her.  I was able to make adjustments.
5.0,I loved the white one so much I bought a hot pink one. Looks expensive and I get tons of complements
5.0,Good product! May a couple more as gifts.
5.0,"Wonderful sweater, looks great. My son lives it!"
5.0,It was exactly what I wanted.  I wear it everyday.
5.0,"Very slim, durable, modern design, and much better than outdated foldable wallets. Look no further!"
5.0,these are Christmas presents- Well made and great designs.
5.0,Beautiful...simple yet stylish. Comfortable to wear all day and comes in very nice packaging
5.0,Love the color and fit. It’s a great lightweight jacket
5.0,My son loves this...I can't say I'm a huge fan but it made him happy (he is 14) so that's what matters!
5.0,Love this dress. Great fit and feel. Can dress it up or down. Very flattering and forgiving. Wore it to work with nude heels and to an afternoon BBQ with keds. Can't go wrong with this dress.
5.0,It’s a nice casual dress
5.0,Love these cozy leggings!
5.0,"EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW WHERE I GOT IT FROM LOL , IT'S DIFFERENT & THEY EVEN PUT A LITTLE PLASTIC PROTECTOR ON THE FRONT TO PEEL OFF .. JUST LIKE BUYING A NEW PHONE .. I LOVE THIS CHAIN & IT'S THE TRUTH !"
5.0,"But that is eXactly the way I wanted it to be , Too Large ., So I am happy and that is what matters ,,,, right"
5.0,These enamel sets are beautiful I'm so glad I ordered them. It gives my customers more choices for their necklaces.
5.0,"Very pretty, received in time for Christmas. My mom loved it!!!"
5.0,"If you're looking for a substantially made, easy to carry, and well priced umbrella look no further. This little guy is strong and durable and fits in my briefcase with ease. Upon opening up for the first time I could tell this thing runs laps around my old (and now broken due to gusty winds) umbrella. I am very happy with my purchase. Highly recommended."
5.0,"My 12 yr old son LOVES THESE SOCKS!! I probably should’ve bought a couple packages! He thought they were the coolest when he saw them! But when he put them on he really loved them! He said these are so soft, lol!! I told him they were specifically for snowboarding & he was all over that! But what I was super impressed with was the fact that he NECER complained that his feet were cold!!! And that is HUGE! He has always had trouble with poor circulation I guess you’d say in his toes/feet & fingers/hands. So he truly has a rough time in the winter. But not with these warm socks!!<br />Thank you for making ROCKIN SNOWBOARD SOCKS!!"
5.0,"Material is somewhat thick but not hot. No under shirt needed. Very, very soft. I bought a Medium and it fits somewhat loose but doesn’t look grumpy!! I’m 5’4 130lbs and wear a small or medium in most things. Good length!"
5.0,Comfortable to wear and easy to change out!
5.0,"Good quality Tar Heel champion t-shirt, got one for myself and one for my husband. Hope to buy more next year!!"
5.0,Love the fit and the price
5.0,Is as stated. I like it a lot.
5.0,"These insignias are beautiful...nice size, weight, and detail."
5.0,"This is a beautiful dress. The fabric is good quality and the dress is lightweight and flows. All of the reviews I read said that it runs small, which I found to be true. It seems to be a true &#34;era&#34; style dress in that the bodice is fitted and the skirt is loose. I wear a size and I ordered a XL. I probably should have ordered a XXL. Please note that due to the lightweightness of the fabric it is not &#34;windproof&#34;."
5.0,"Very lightweight, yet durable. My husband is very happy with them. They are his fishing glasses and he loves them. Very comfortable!"
5.0,I love these earrings.  There are nice and long.  Wish they had silver.
5.0,They are just the BEST !!!
5.0,"Love, Love, Love this fan!!<br />Very classy and unique. Quality was very good for the price. Attended a Roaring 20's party and another guest had the fan in pale pink. We were both saying how pleased we were.  Not too much shedding and the fan really gave off air when fanning."
5.0,"This is the second wood case watch that I have purchased through Amazon and I have been very pleased with both, I especially like this one because of the contrasting blue dials and second hand."
5.0,"The increased visibility is great. You would think the lens would be dark when looking through it but, not."
5.0,Awesome craftsmanship.  Turned out perfect delivered ahead of schedule
5.0,"Super cute! Fits perfect. I am 5’5 138lbs and I got a small. The length is perfect, not too long. Colors on the dress look as pictured (I got the Black/Orange) nice quality."
5.0,Esi
5.0,"The small sized glasses worked really well for a Harry Potter costume for a child (10 years old). I tried them on myself and they were a bit small, but could have worked also. My son and I were both impressed with the quality of the glasses (frame and lens). Son was quite happy with the purchase."
5.0,"Wow! These are killer comfortable and fit so good. I love the ""tight"" form-fitting, but the fabric is stretchy enough that my workout wasn't compromised in the least. On top of this great report, these are very stylish as well. Time will tell how they hold up through washing and lots of wear (cuz I'll be wearing these bad boys every chance I get). These are multi-purpose pants, easy to lounge at home, workout at the gym or outside, or even stylish enough for casual wear around town. Finally, compared to Public Rec (I know, not exactly apples to apples), these are a great bargain."
5.0,Great for the money . I am very pleased.
5.0,"They are very nice😊  No surprises, they are everything they say they are. They also arrived within days.  Love them"
5.0,This is a perfect gift for any ocassion
5.0,This watch strap firs right
5.0,"Great value for a genuine Indian product. I call my local Indian dealer for this hat, and it was 50% cheaper on Amazon, for the same hat!!!"
5.0,Fit well. Seem to breath. Little socks are dry when I remove the shoes. Easy on and off. Good shoes.shipped quickly. Would recommend them..
5.0,"These things are great! They seal quite well to your face and nothing gets in. The gasket is really soft, pliable, and comfortable. Good quality; highly recommend! They even sent free ear plugs and a nose clip which also work very well. It’s a better nose clip than I have usually received as a freebie."
5.0,"My man bought me a necklace but the chain was only 16 inches and I like it but wearing certain items I needed a longer chain.  I like the original chain a tad better but for the price its perfect.  This chain is elegant, thin, and the length is perfect for my diamond pendant:)"
5.0,"This item is very nice, however it does shrink after washing and drying. So order up a size"
5.0,"I've had these for about 4 years now. Sometimes, I don't want to wear a beanie; these are great with a ball cap, so both my head and ears are covered. They're soft, warm, and comfortable. When I go indoors (somewhere heated), I can just pull these down around my neck, like a pair of headphones. I love these things."
5.0,"These gloves are very warm and feel comfortable,  so far they are great for the price."
5.0,This hat is just what I was looking for. A little floppy but not too floppy. Big enough to protect from the sun but not too big. The chin stap comes in handy for winding days on the beach. Love it!
5.0,Used this for a vampire costume. Couldn't believe the weight of the chain and &#34;Stones&#34; for the price. Great value for a costume.
5.0,These are pretty and very lightweight.
5.0,"I keep the mask on the door handle of my car, I don’t forget to grab it. Veer comfortable and easy to breathe. Will buy again if I need to."
5.0,A high quality denim jacket but didn’t expect the rainbow lettered word: Solocote in the back but daughter doesn’t seem to mind
5.0,This was a gift for my grandson who is a tween. This shirt was perfect since he also loves to play video games. It was age appropriate.
5.0,Good arch support for someone who needs to prevent foot from turning inward.  I have a pair for my house and I bought another one to wear while out.  Most comfortable footwear that I own.
5.0,"I love this.  It is comfortable and keeps my long, thick hair easily in place.  The drawstring makes it so easy to use.  Great value for the money."
5.0,"Because I have experienced hearing loss and don't wish to make it any worse, I ordered these Safety Muffs because I practice with firearms often.  I've only used them once while firing a pistol but they did an excellent job of muffling the loud reports.  I have no complaints with comfort even while wearing glasses with them.  The seal around the ears and glasses were firm without being oppressive.  These are much better than the ones that I was issued at my workplace."
5.0,it's there. Just like the picture.  Very nice bag.
5.0,"I am truly enjoying this Winners Bank200!  Before using the bank, I would leave the casino with nothing. Now I get so excited to see what I actually have won and have it to show for it when I get home. This is an awesome product,  my hat goes off to the genius who created it. Thank you truly for this.  It makes enjoying one of your favorite entertainment a lot more fun!!! 🤗😁"
5.0,My residents at my work loved my new scrub top got lots of compliments. It's Christmas style but not over the top I love it
5.0,"looks great, and works like a charm, thanks !"
5.0,I have gotten a lot of compliments on these shorts. These are my favorite shorts. The way they are made and look you can wear somewhere nice or just every day. They look kinda dressy the red 🌹 rose on front is beautiful!!!!<br />Only thing I wish is that they were little longer and I wish had more colors in shorts and more colors in 🌹 rose's.<br />You would really be happy with this pair of shorts.
5.0,"bought this for my mom as a gift. I am very please at the quality of it. the image of Jesus is clear and being within the heart is a nice ""bonus"" if you will.  so very happy with this."
5.0,"Such a beautiful dress. I wear a 10 and got a 12 and it fits perfectly. I'm 5'8&#34; 155lbs. It's well made, and the laces up the back make it fit like a dream. I can't wait to wear it to my benefit!"
5.0,"EXCELENTE, GRACIAS."
5.0,Good thick rubber coating for impact resistance. Air gaps on the sides of fingers for venting. The coating doesn't make your hands gooey like cheap imitators.
5.0,Super cute dress. Fits well and looks good on. Nice material and well made. I’m 5’9” tall and on the fluffy side and this dress fit me perfectly.
5.0,These are very good looking jeans better quality than I expected
5.0,I liked this product it did the job and is pretty cute and soft. I was nervous because of the other reviews
5.0,Perfect fit for Any Body type. Very comfortable. Washes well. I have 3 pairs.
5.0,Great way to organize all these bows without having them get ruined!
5.0,"I'm really happy with this product. I bought something like this a few years ago and liked it, but I only got one pair and the price was around $10, which made me reluctant to get more when I lost one. Now, with 20 pairs, I don't have to worry about losing one every now and then. Although I don't expect that to happen often, as these stay on well."
5.0,The color doesn’t stay on them long so the end up being just silver balls but work for the money
5.0,"The original band broke after a couple weeks. I've had this replacement for a couple weeks now and it's really holding up well. I like the soft silicon, it's very comfortable and durable. I thought maybe because of the very reasonable price that it would be cheaply made or the stripes would fall off or something. That is not at all the case. The stripes are trendy and a little flashy. They put just a little bing on the otherwise very black and sullen watch band. If this band ever does wear out or break (I&#34;m sure from me not being careful with a $300 watch) I will most definitely buy another one. I was unfamiliar with Henoda before this but this excellent product has earned my trust with them.<br />UPDATE: After several months of use I can say the white stripes on the bottom of my wrist are worn off. I suspect this is from using my mouse and my wrist dragging around my desk. See the second picture of the worn spot, where there are no stripes. You can also see where the stripes are worn off near the sides of the band.  I'm ok with this as the majority of the band still looks good. Most importantly this band is far more durable than the original."
5.0,"I bought (and returned) a similar one. That one was more expensive. This one is soft, Both in looks and feel."
5.0,Needed a plain white t shirt for my daughter and decided to go with this set because it was inexpensive. Great quality and perfect for what I needed.
5.0,Great Bags!! Helps keep my travels organized... although i dont used each bag for the recommended items they still keep me organized. I do however wish the bags were blank.
5.0,"Great product, comfortable & light. Lens are interchangeable  and are included."
5.0,Love this on my son....we sing the song &#34;panda panda panda&#34; when he wars it :)
5.0,"ADORABLE dress.  I wish I had one in every color.  It is important to note, though, that there aren't any buttons or zippers.  It's simply a wrap dress that you close together with the belt that is included.  But it's very comfortable and pretty."
5.0,stylish and UV protection !!
5.0,I love this shirt...unfortunately it came with a hole in the seam but I returned and they immediately sent me a new one no charge!
5.0,I love my new hat!  :)

5.0,"Great price, and very comfortable."
5.0,Great product. Soft and durable.
5.0,"Awesome tee shirt for my husband. He is 6'4"" tall with a short torso and long legs. Shirt seems to be long enough for him too. Washes up well and graphics are designed well. Soft cotton and seems like it will hold up well. His new favorite t shirt...and I certainly would buy from this seller again!  Third time in the laundry basket yesterday...as shown in the photo!  :)"
5.0,Very easy to fit and very comfortable belt.
5.0,I loved this belly ring a lot! Very cute and love the color. This is definitely a must!
5.0,Came in a very timely manner and looks and fits great!
5.0,"Love this dress, well made for the money. The problem for me was it was way too short waisted, it fit more like an Empire. Sad, really because it is so nice!"
5.0,"Ever wanted an umbrella that just opens when you want it to, and closes without a battle? Look no further. This cool umbrella has a button that actually works when you press it (no more jiggling the umbrella handle in the pouring rain!!). To close it, simply press the close button, and the umbrella will snap close. I have not been able to test it in a real downpour yet since mother nature is roasting us right now with brutal heat, but I'm confident this umbrella will perform.<br /><br />*I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review of the product. The seller did not influence my review in any way, and I was not required to leave a positive feedback. The review is my own experience with this item. [...]*"
5.0,Cute arrived as expected
5.0,I like it.  Used for a baby shower party
5.0,"They fit, they're water proof and everybody comments on the<br />horses! Loving the wear and the attention."
5.0,Gets so many comments all holiday season. Unique and immediately recognizable.
5.0,This is a great felt cover for card games.
5.0,The size of this wallet is very convenient. It doesn’t take up a lot of room and can easily be carried around. It’s very light and was exactly what I needed to carry a few bucks and cards. I truly love the color !!!
5.0,"Purchased this for my mother in anticipation of her losing her hair to chemo treatments. She says it fits great, is well made, with a soft fabric. Will be purchasing more."
5.0,"Got this for my wife, because she likes sterling silver. She especially liked the mother and child. Not a lot of jewelry out there that represents the love of Mother and child in the way that this one does. The diamond are very shinning. Chain has held up nicely as well."
5.0,"I was super pleased with these.  They ran bigger than the sizes I've bought before.  I would never buy another pant type snow pants without bibs, because the snow rides up my daughter's back.  These are perfect.  And she gets them on and off easily!"
5.0,"Nothing shouts ""class"" as loudly as a PBR belt buckle. Even if I were to employ the use of said buckle, it wouldn't be visible, for the shirt with some band on it that I would be wearing would cover it. So what is the point? People need not look at my crotch area to see what kind of beer I drink-they need only look in my hand.<br /><br />  America's best in 1893, baby."
5.0,"Strong, use it at work"
5.0,"Now these are cuuuuute! Fit is true to size, comfortable while walking, the heel is stylish (feels a bit over 3&#34;) and the color, dusty mauve, looks pink in the suede material. Pleased with this purchase."
5.0,Like them wish I would of just ordered a large
5.0,I wore these all of December. Cute and comfy.
5.0,My Daughter loves this.
5.0,Only bows that stay in my 1 year olds fine hair
5.0,This jacket is awesome. Really like the height of the collar beneath the hood and it has a nice soft texture on the chin. It's the little things.
5.0,Great Color to pick my black bag out of the crowd.
5.0,"Fit great on my 5'8&#34; 135lb, 36DD wife. This is a quality item and she loved it!"
5.0,"Fit my 13 year old nephew perfectly and he's a big boy, with a big head. I almost didn't purchase because another reviewer said, this didnt fit her 9 year old. The reviewer had stated it was too tight for her 9 year old. Good thing I did end up purchasing. Keep in mind its also a snap back, so it'll fit a variety of sizes. Great price, great quality. Very satisfied."
5.0,"The shoes fit, are comfortable and look great."
5.0,"I love the dress, fits just as described! I wear 14/15 in clothes. I ordered a 2x!  I feel very sexy in it and still classy! You want be disappointed! Pictures coming soon!"
5.0,"Got this for a good friend who lives over 1,000 miles away. She loved it!!"
5.0,I'm so happy I got this bracelet. The eye means different things in different cultures. I have received many complements wearing this bracelet. This is very well made and high quality.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*High quality<br />*Beautiful colors<br />*Well made!<br />*Great Gift idea!
5.0,"These watches are very cute and colorful and work for the intended purpose. Two of them were off by a few minutes but I’m not using them for the time. I have an Apple Watch but needed something small enough to fit in my pocket to pull out when taking vitals. I don’t like using my Apple Watch as the screen turns off when in the middle of counting, unless you set it to have the screen remain on (which drains the battery). Also, sometimes my apple watch dies so these are perfect for reliability.  Absolutely recommend these."
5.0,This is a lovely dress. It’s very comfy and elegant. I would purchase again.
5.0,"I gave it 5 stars because the hat is fine, as advertised, came quickly (it wasn't Prime).  And I figure, as an agent, if, before I die, I get one conversation from the hat and that turns into a client, the hat pays for itself 500- to 1000-fold (or something like that).  It does sit up high on your head (there's space between the hat and your head, that is), which is not my preference - I like snug caps - but that is no fault of the hat, only my personal preference."
5.0,"Comfortable, cute, fits as I expected and looks very dressy for a casual sandal."
5.0,A little short but otherwise a great dress.
5.0,The fit perfect t around my calves and huge thighs. They fit comfortably around the waist and the crotch area. The cotton is soft and the joggers are premium
5.0,Best beach dress ever! Super comfy. I got so many compliments.
5.0,Very nice top and color was great too..
5.0,Feet feeling cold following surgery.  Need to keep them warm!
5.0,This dress is so cute and flattering! I love that it’s modest enough to wear to work. Also super comfy! Definitely recommend.
5.0,Looks great for the money and goes well with many of my outfits
5.0,Really cute and durable. The chain does not feel cheap at all. I wore it for carnival and it didn't break
5.0,This keychain is beautiful - worthwhile purchase.
5.0,Loved the support
5.0,I ordered one size larger because they run a title small. I’m a 40 and ordered a 42 and they fit perfect. They are also flex fit so they stretch more than your avg. Good deal!
5.0,"So comfy and pretty cute too. The pieces are well made, fit, and a good price."
5.0,Love this shirt.  Very soft and the perfect weight for fall. Been wearing it as a night shirt and I sleep so comfy in it.  I'm so excited for next week when the temp drops so I can wear it during the day and not just as a night shirt.  The purple is also a great color.  Kids hate when I get ready for bed and start hopping a round saying a mock a mock a mock..... But it's all just hocus pocus ;-)
5.0,I absolutely love this top this top flatters everyone it makes your waist look so small it's very flattering to the hips especially if you have a curvy body I bought this and every color I love this top I feel very built in it it camouflage is all my imperfections
5.0,Very nice tie! Better than I expected. And my wife liked it too. But I'm not letting her wear it LOL!<br />Looking forward to wearing it tomorrow with my black suit to my nieces wedding. I will probably be<br />buying more ties from Mindeng. Great for a low price!! Thanks.
5.0,This is really cute. I am super happy with this.
5.0,Really nice jacket and a great price!
5.0,These socks are the best socks for lounging around the house or wearing to work. LOVE THEM. They also make really fun and practicle gifts for anyone.
5.0,Love it  he loves it  what other colors do you
5.0,Fit beautifully.  Will order in different colors
5.0,love this bathing suit cover up
5.0,"In my house we are Disney lovers! I have so many Disney ears with bows, I have two boys that love them but my ears are very girly, I got this for my one year old and had to get one for my 4 year old because he wanted one! We loved it!"
5.0,"They're cute, comfortable, and a perfect fit!"
5.0,"I bought these as decorative spray bottles to place around the house, and use to spray my cats with water when they misbehave or try to scratch furniture! The range is pretty good, they are of really nice quality and the blue color is pretty so I can leave a bottle on the coffee table and it blends with my home decor!"
5.0,"After much research I decided on this particular magnetic Hematite bracelet. I'm glad I did. It's good quality & I noticed when I wear it, I feel more relaxed. My mother noticed this as well. However, my sister said it gave her energy. I've ordered 3 of these! Gave as gifts. I will be ordering another.<br /><br />Update 8/20: Just purchased 2 more. Very happy with the quality & effectiveness of these."
5.0,Still my fav hat So many  compliments
5.0,Button fell off immediately but for 20 bucks what can you expect? not see through and fits well.
5.0,Great jacket.  Has a front vent to open when you get too warm.
5.0,Kept me cool in the sun!
5.0,"Beautiful color, perfect size for a girl of 5 and very resistant. Would buy it again anytime!"
5.0,Like it was adjustable
5.0,These earrings are cute as can be.  My 6 year old granddaughter got her ears pieced this past summer and she loves the earrings.  They are adorable especially for little ears.  Would recommend.
5.0,It keep my head warm. 😺
5.0,"I bought this strap for my spouse for a Seiko 5.<br /><br />Other places on the internet stated that a 20mm band width was fine to get for Seiko's (which are listed at 19mm)<br />Those places are wrong! other bands may work at 20mm, but these are quality leather and do not fit in that smaller opening.<br /><br />However, with a very small amount of work with a small sharp knife (avoid cutting the stitching if you do this yourself!) the leather fit nicely between the watch lugs.<br /><br />The spring loaded bars posed a larger problem.<br />They are much easier to put in and take out than normal bars due to their 'bolt action' quick release, which is probably great on all 20mm lugged watches, however they would not fit inside the smaller Seiko.<br /><br />We ended up removing the bars the bands shipped with entirely (had to stretch the leather with some very pointy tweezers) and reusing the Seiko bars. This was the most stressful part of the whole process as I really didn't want to scratch or scuff the new leather up!<br /><br />TL;DR<br />The bands are too wide for Seiko's, but with a little work they can be made to fit wonderfully (custom fit!). Spouse super happy with gift, acts like its a whole new watch."
5.0,muy bonito!
5.0,"Great shirt w/ clear graphics. I wear a size 4, and the gray women’s shirt in M was on the verge of being too small. Recommend ordering 1-2 sizes up."
5.0,I order two more pair as they are get !!!!!!!
5.0,"This fits relatively close to how it fits the model. I'm shocked. I'm typically a small and I ordered a small. It fits well through the hips (very flowy). The top is loose on me; I wish it hugged me tighter to show off my waist. It's tight enough though that it has stayed up all day at work without drooping. I wish it as a little longer; I'm 5'7&#34; and it hit my ankles as pictured. It you're shorter than it would probably be a nice long maxi on you. The quality of the fabric was pretty good given the price. It's akin to what you would expect from a fast fashion company like H&M or Forever21. Overall, totally worth the price and it arrived very quickly."
5.0,BEST HELMET IN I'VE OWNED IN 20 YEARS BAR NONE AND FAST SHIPPING!!!!!
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for. Thick, strong and durable. Highly recommend."
5.0,I have gotten so many compliments when I wear these. People ask where I got them and I’m happy to say on Amazon
5.0,"The tortoise shell pattern of these glasses is the best I've seen in a while. The gold accents are a lovely touch! I'm quite scared to leave these sitting down, because everyone I showed these glasses absolutely loved them! I even know someone that likes them better than her Armani pair!"
5.0,"Fit my husband perfect, he loves them & they have been a great work boot for him :-)"
5.0,Love this product - but it is TOO small
5.0,I bought this for my daughter-in-law for Christmas.  Today was the first opportunity she had to wear them since our weather is SO unpredictable.  She really loves them.  The hat is not just a beanie but looks exactly like the picture.  It has a little soft roll up &#34;brim&#34; so it doesn't just look like a beanie.  And she said the gloves are very warm  I had forgotten that they're fleece lined.<br /><br />She likes it so much that I think I'm going to buy one for myself!
5.0,"The charm is beautiful although it's not exactly what I expected. Its flat on the back to make it lay smoother, I suppose. I have recieved several compliments when I have worn it."
5.0,"I really love this dress. I love that it's one piece. No fussing with arranging myself just so. The color and fabric is really nice. So here's the important stuff. I'm 5’9 196 lbs,  I like my clothes TIGHT so my opinion of it being lose in the waist could just be me 🤷🏼‍♀️ either way I decided to keep it. Its an 2X."
5.0,Was bought a gift.  Recipient loves it.
5.0,Perfect earrings to go with my outfit
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:bc7a347f52569f6e06e3fca565692f76]] This is nothing if not an indulgence. This mask is a product that I likely never would have gotten if it weren't for the fact that I'm in the Vine program. It's not remotely cheap at $120, and I got it with the idea that it'll be something cool to use for Halloween later this year. It's far beyond my normal Halloween budget. I was curious about what to expect from the quality, but the truth is, it's every bit as wonderful as the product images make it seem. It's easily the funniest and most ridiculous item I've gotten as far back as I can remember.<br /><br />Some of the fun I've had with this thing so far:<br /><br />1. Scaring the heck out of my dog (you'll see in the video that I mention my dog is terrified of it; actually, she got used to it and started to think of masked me as her buddy. Now if I put it on, she runs over and wants to hang out!).<br />2. Diffusing arguments with my wife. Any time we're having a discussion, I'll slip away briefly and put this mask on. There is literally no way to continue to be angry/frustrated when the person you're arguing with has this on. It's better than therapy!<br />3. Messing with friends who come over. Now they think I'm a furry. Oops!<br /><br />The next use I have in mind for Halloween is this: I'm going to wear the mask and sit lifelessly on my porch with a bowl of candy and a sign that says ""take one."" Then, when kids show up, I'm going to scare them by barking at them (especially if they take more than one candy). I'm pretty sure there will be many more potential uses for this that I haven't thought of yet, but basically, I love this thing. It's incredible.<br /><br />One thing worth mentioning is that the movable mouth has worked great for me as long as I wedge my chin in the mask the right way. My head is a bit larger than average, so prolonged use is not incredibly comfortable. My wife on the other hand is petite and has a proportionally small head. She couldn't quite get her chin placed adequately to move the mouth. Keep your head size in mind if you're considering one of these.<br /><br />***I write reviews as a hobby because I love trying out electronics, clothing, household products, kitchen devices, and more.

5.0,"I work in technical sales and travel around the globe. As an engineer and gadget junky, im always lugging around a ton of gear and cables. The grid-it totally keeps all of my stuff organized and i literally cant travel without it. Superb quality and amazingly functional. Highly recommend this product."
5.0,I love this necklace and I wear it often.
5.0,We got this dress to do Goldilocks and the three bears. My daughter was so cute and got so many compliments! Dress is well made and true to fit.
5.0,"Perfect for flying long distance, also used them for a music festival with palladium boots. Great looks and they definitely help my calves no to be so sore after 3 days partying."
5.0,Very comfortable and nice design.  Does cut way down on bouncing while working out.
5.0,The reviews were correct to order sandals a size bigger form your true shoe size. I ordered a size bigger and the sandals fit perfectly. Love them and just in time for the beach
5.0,"Great app to set and adjust it.  Has a wonderful FIND MY iPHONE feature!  Literally rings the phone if you cannot find it.  Of course, I suppose if you lose your watch and your phone, you are screwed! LOL. But seriously, great looking, tough watch.  LOVE IT."
5.0,"Love the ring.  😍.  Definitely,  worth getting.  I aim to buy another."
5.0,"Absolutely Loving this concept! Especially with the winter days fast approaching. My husband works all day outdoors. This is perfect in keeping him warm AND enjoying his music at the same time!! He wore this to work and ALL his friends just had to have one. I can imagine them all together, dancing along to their music and actually enjoying their day at work :-) <br /><br />Design:<br />Greatest thing about this is no noticeable wires. <br />It's completely comfortable!<br />Keeps you fashionably warm!<br />Perfect fit!<br /><br />Maintenance:<br />The headset can be easily removed and the beanie washed either by hand or machine wash. I personally have machine washed in cold water with no problems. <br /><br />Performance:<br />The control panel is on the side of the hat. Simple to operate! <br />Buttons easily accessible to control Play/Pause music, the volume and Answer incoming Calls! :-) The music is true to sound. Hubby enjoys it at full volume. <br />BONUS: The phone calls come in clearly too.<br /><br />Overall, this beanie is a huge hit with family and friends. Excellent for gift giving for the holidays. I must now get one for myself :-)<br /><br />Also MyDeals provides Excellent Customer Service!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my HONEST review."
5.0,The fit is spot on. They are not baggy or too loose. I don't like pants that are to loose. I had bought a gray pair at a retailer and it was their last pair and I was needing a black pair as well. I did my research for the item number and found these online. I wear these to work and they look great! I get so many compliments on the pants. I definitely recommend these for anyone any age!
5.0,I bought this costume to wear at work all day at the office. The material comfortable and light weight so I won’t be uncomfortable while at work. Very cute could wear to a Halloween party too. I did by some spiderwebbed leggings to wear with it.
5.0,Super cute too!  Nice thin and flows material.  Happy with this purchase overall.
5.0,"i now have two new pairs of this new style of Teva's.  I really like Teva's, I live in AZ and we are always outside and live with tile floors, they are great for indoors or outdoors.  I love how I don't slip on tile floors or cool deck if they are wet."
5.0,I am happy with these leggings.  They are perfect for yoga.  You may wish to wash them separately the first time even if you purchase a light color.
5.0,Beautiful purse with elegant fabric inside.
5.0,Comfy stylish and layerable shirt. Great for a night out outfit or as a casual pajama top
5.0,Buenas gafas
5.0,This dress is simply stunning. I ordered it two days before NYE and got it by noon on the 31st! I was so pleased. It came in a beautiful box and bag. So classy. I couldn't wait to open it...so much better than it arriving in a thin plastic shipping bag. Totally unexpected! Then I tried it on. I am 6'1 and about 145 pounds. My arms are obviously long as are my lower limbs. I ordered a 10 and it fit perfect. The top is so beautiful. The images don't do it justice. I did find the the backing that bordered the neck and under the breast are to be bunch and pulled under the garment so that the detailed ends were not as showcased as they could be. So I careful trimmed around the neck and entire bottom till about where the arm hangs down and the edge starts to move up the back. This allowed the lace to lay flatter so not puckered back. Spray a little stiff hairspray to give the detailed edges some weight and it was perfect. I was the bell of the ball. Seriously I got sooooo many compliments and everyone wanted to borrow it. What a way to start a new year.<br />I didn't get any photos that night but I do plan on wearing it for my birthday later this month so I will try to get a couple so you can see how amazing it looks....how beautiful it can make you feel. I will buy again from Chic Bella.

5.0,Got these for use for Volleyball and basketball for an injury prone finger. Delivers great compression and support and easy to wash.

5.0,"Item fit perfectly, quality was nicer than expected. Has been through the wash a few times already and still in great condition."

5.0,"Necklace bead color is deep red, almost red-purple, with unique black details. The necklace is actually more beautiful in person than what photo shows. Black, bare chain near clasp is a little different but quality, color combination of the beads is amazing and well worth the price.<br /><br />May 2018 update:  This necklace is still one of my favorites.  I wore it a lot during Christmas parties/events since the deep red matched many of my outfits.  The necklace is holding up well."
5.0,I love this dress! It's super cute.  For reference I am 5'5&#34; and about 110lbs.  I got the smallest size.  The dress length is perfect with sandal.  I wear it with a belt because the silhouette is too boxy for my liking.  The fabric is thin but not see through because I got the dark color.
5.0,"Very warm, quality much better then I expected for price."
5.0,I liked the quality.

5.0,Love this belt! It’s versatile and goes with everything.
5.0,I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  Delivery was just in time and the necklace was better than I expected for the steal of a price.  He is rough on jewelry so that is why I choose the stainless steel over sterling.  He is a big guy... (6' 220)and the length was perfect. Hit right below the collarbone.  The weight was heavier than expected but just shows that it is a solid piece.  The links are well polished and almost rounded the width is just as I expected and not too small but wide enough to be seen at a distance.  Just a great look.  Thanks! Will look for this sellers items again!
5.0,My husband is Canadian and I found this tee for him.  It is great quality.  One of the best quality tee I have seen.  He loves it.  Washes well without shrinking much.

5.0,Very nice love em
5.0,My pets love this food.
5.0,Fit better than expected. I bought so I could get out of wearing pants or shorts in hot weather.  Comfy! I’m a 32 B and a small 5’4” and 110# and a small is perfect. Not too tight not too loose. The beja blue is perfect for a pale white woman like me.
5.0,"Love the color and shape, they look beautiful."
5.0,"Great shirt, wore it for a blues jam fest and got a few compliments too"
5.0,"These are awesome swim goggles, according to my daughter.  we were invited to go to an indoor swimming pool so she was excited I received these goggles as she loves to wear goggles when swimming.  I tried them on first and they fit perfectly on me, an adult, the suction was great and they were easy to put on and take off.  My daughter is 12 and with a quick small adjustment they fit her head perfectly.  She said they were the best goggles she has used so far.  No water seeped in, they were comfortable on her face and eyes and she could see underwater great!  The other people with her tried them on and loved them too!  While I didn't swim myself, I can only give you her opinion, but her opinion would be better than mine as she uses goggles every swimming trip!  She loved them and said they were the best ones she has used.  We didn't get to try out the UV protection so as we use them more more, I will come back and give you our opinion.  I received these goggles at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion.  They were wonderful, and my daughter loved them.  I would definitely recommend these to my family and friends, and I plan to buy more for gifts for my grandkids!"
5.0,Seems well made and I expect they'll last a long time. Very comfortable.
5.0,Bought 'em for my husband with terrible night blindness. He loves them and swears by them.
5.0,"so cute and personal for that someone special...these charms that fit into a floating charm holding necklace are the latest thing and better and cheaper than buying extremely expensive Pandora charms, (although nice they are pricey)...get several birthstone crystals, charms and the necklace and personalize this for someone special. Sooo many charms to choose from and you get a little free gift like a pearl with it. Very cute!!"
5.0,"For the price these can't be beat. Fit great, come with a hard case, soft drawstring bag, and even a small screwdriver. They look cool and the wood is soft. My favorite sunglasses!"

5.0,Cute & super comfy. Order a size up in u want to wear as a dress.
5.0,Good pair of cufflinks.  The material is solid and looks well made.  Also they are easy to open and close.
5.0,It's cute and exactly what I wanted.
5.0,"I first bought one (dark blue). When it arrived, I tried it on and ordered a second (maroon). This purchase was my third (light grey).<br /><br />The lining makes it comfortable to ware and adds warmth. The workmanship is good, however on all three sweaters the zipper are on the women's rather than the man's side; E.g., the zipper pull does not follow the convention for a men's garment closure. As a result, the first time I put one on it took a while to figure out why I was having trouble. Once you know this, you will quickly adapt to that quirk."
5.0,Great quality and think chain love it
5.0,"Lightweight, convenient water bottle holder and room for i.d. and phone in pocket.  Strap is one and half inch wide durable nylon web and buckle is ample...great for hiking."

5.0,i like my wish pearl nescklaces very pretty.
5.0,Nicely made. Exactly what I wanted.
5.0,"The cuff is shinier than in the picture and just the right size for my ear.  I can see how if you are not careful it might break, but I have been wearing it for a week and have had no problems.  I had to adjust it slightly with needle-nosed pliers, but after that, it fits perfectly."
5.0,These fit perfect and and so soft and comfortable. I would definitely order these again.
5.0,My son is a Batman fan really enjoys to have
5.0,"These necklaces are definitely worth the price for any Taylor Swift fan.  I hung mine up in my vehicles, but I love them to wear as necklaces too! Sturdy quality, but still nice and dainty looking. I personally love their overall style, and showing love to TS with these."

5.0,"Comfortable,  great price. Would purchase again"
5.0,I really liked this dress. It was very long though so I had to pick it up sometimes and it was a little too form fitting in my stomach. But overall a great purchase for future costumes.

5.0,"great top, long and good quality"
5.0,"LOVE the design of the frames, but the lenses are not dark enough so they sadly had to go back. Replaced with Bvlgari 6038B 278/13 Pale Gold 6038B Visor Sunglasses"
5.0,"I only wear sandals due to feet issues and needed some socks to wear in the winter that were not too thick yet very warm. I did alot of research online and took a chance ordering these. Thankfully, they are perfect - as smooth as butter, they fit in my sandals without any extra pressure on my feet and are a godsend in the cold. Thank you!"
5.0,Great selection of colors! Sturdy key ring.
5.0,Bought this choker because I wasn't sure if it would look good on me. I figured for the small price I wouldn't be losing much if it didn't. It's a nice soft velvet and very light. When you're wearing it you barely realize it's even there. I feel like it's very easy to break though because of how light it is. I've worn it several times with no breaking though. Good little choker for the price.

5.0,"Beautiful, very satisfied, nice gift"
5.0,beautiful pair of earrings
5.0,"It's breathtaking! My friend who's a belly dance instructor wore it to a belly dance recital and she was the queen of the night. So when my sister saw her picture,  she asked me to buy it for her and plans to wear it on an International costume day in Thailand. I'm sure she'll stand out."
5.0,This hat fits perfect and is at a great price!  Very stylish and well made New Era hat which matches all the other PXG gear.
5.0,So nice to fold them away in the trunk of my car and stand them up in the grocery store at checkout.
5.0,This shirt has easily become my favorite to wear! It’s thin enough to be comfortable and move around easy. It fits wonderfully and the letters haven’t faded or looked any differently after multiple washes

5.0,"Exactly what I needed for my costume. Lightweight horns, snug headband , and the perfect height on the horns."
5.0,I love this outfit. I've had so many compliments about. The only thing is that you will have to go up in size.
5.0,she loves them. pretty true to size.
5.0,"Bought this at a mountaonbike festival, brilliant design, made I  USA and it is super comfortable. The buckle is a little wider and may not work with narrower loops. They have a new version coming with narrower buckle. Super efficient, and light and strong."
5.0,"Even do the Cap is not NIKE It is just very good material, nice Fit, it does look like a Barcelona FC original official product ! I recommend you to buy it and if you like Barcelona wear it with your Messi favorite jersey because he will stay at Barcelona and make our history Greater than ever!"

5.0,I love these but the backs aren't very tight.
5.0,These Wire Lock Pins replace the original pin I lost recently.  I use them on a weight distribution hitch to lock the hook-up chains in place.  These work better than the original because of the small extension (about 0.75 inches) of the wire below the pin.  It makes the wire lock much easier to remove.  Over all I am happier with this wire lock pin than the original set.
5.0,"Sólo que son un poco frágiles, pero hermosis"
5.0,"This is the nicest cardigan you can ever imagine. Soft, made well, fits true I love it a must for every wardrobe!"

5.0,It was so pretty came nicely In a box wrapped in a bag for reusing my sons teacher loved it
5.0,My 12 year old wears this almost every day - to my chagrin.  People often comment on how great it is.  Seems like a nice quality sweat shirt.
5.0,my Sunday School Class bought gifts for ladies in the nursing home which do not have family members visiting them.  This was something I purchased for one of those ladies.  I am sure they liked it.  It looked great.
5.0,"I was looking for a casual dress that I could also dress up.  This is perfect!  T feels like a t-shirt but is not clingy.  Fits very well (size 4).  It is not clingy around the hips.  The color says blue but it is subdued and I feel it can be worn and dressed up with black heels/shawl, etc.  I am thinking about the getting the brown color as well."
5.0,The belt shown was what I was looking for & needed the size is right and no frills.  Excellent.
5.0,"Great! I used them to replace a bunch of watch straps as I am allergic to leather and I have a lot of collectible watches I don't get to wear. I received a discount on these in return for a review. I honestly grabbed them on a whim but I am glad I did, great for someone with allergies or someone who wants to cordinate their watch strap with whatever they are wearing."
5.0,It's so cute and since I have the matching wallet it's adorable.
5.0,"Thinner than how it looks online. I have one from the same company that is wider and was expecting that width. Otherwise, still looks nice and fits just right. 👌"
5.0,Loved it! I wear L usually and I’m 175lbs 5”1 but I could’ve gotten a M. The straps were loose so I crossed them in front of me and it was a hit!
5.0,I am a huge Van Gogh fan andI love the shape and size of these. They art perfect
5.0,provides adequate shade for sensitive eyes and the adjustability makes this a sensible buy for anyone concerned with being able to see or worried about being seen
5.0,I. Love. This. Bag!!
5.0,Beautiful soft sweater.  Many compliments!
5.0,"An excellent choice to identify sports equipment, backpacks, gym bags — you name it. These tags won’t fade or get worn out. I heartily recommend them ."

5.0,"It's a cute pearl-hoop earring, perfect hoop size, too! Super love it!"
5.0,Very nice feel and lightweight
5.0,"Tried smaller similar magnets but only these were strong enough to hold together medium weight blouse fabric. Punching holes in the fabric each time with decorative ""blouse buttons"" was not an option."
5.0,"It fits perfectly. The quality is really good, in fact better than I expected. The print doesn't fade away easily with regular use or washes."
5.0,Kinda on smaller size but so so adorable! I would size up 1.
5.0,Great product no issues. Great to add spare key for bike rides or quick trips to mailbox Strong & durable.
5.0,"Loving it.  I ordered an XXLarage due to past experiences with ordering tops.  However, this one came way too big.  But it is so cute.  I gave it to my niece and reordered the XLarge.  That was an perfect American fit.  I wore it to work and got lots of compliments.  I am very happy with my purchases.  My niece loves hers too.  I recommend.  Just the right fabric for us in Florida."
5.0,love it!!! that is why i ordered another one!!!
5.0,First one we ordered was an x large... it fit like a small to medium... company was great with refund...

5.0,"Excellent, excellent,excellen!!!"
5.0,The ear crawlers are exactly as pictured and described.  They arrived fashionably boxed and in a timely manner.  I am pleased with this purchase.
5.0,"Dress material is smooth and soft, but it will cling to curves a bit. Size runs small"
5.0,"This was a gift to a friend. He really liked it. At first he said the exchange of lenses was not smooth, but then he said that was a good thing, and it is strong. He did need to adjust the nose pad, but I think that is a good thing, it enables you to customize it a bit. Very comfortable and light. He bikes and really likes it, he now doesn't bike without it. All items in the description arrived, and in good shape."
5.0,"Good, inexpensive polarized sunglasses. I keep missed placing my prescription sunglasses, and these fit nicely over my regular glasses. They provide good coverage. They are well worth the cost."
5.0,"A little bigger than I expected, very pretty"
5.0,"This is a nice selection of multicolor bandanas. These are colorfast and do not stain the other clothing articles they are washed with. They are only printed on one side, so you may select a blank side or the side with decoration to be worn facing out, which I like. These are large bandanas and are very useful for a large number of tasks."
5.0,"Love these boots for winter snow and I know they will be great in the mud in the spring.  Did have to add an insert, no biggie.  People comment on these all the time."

5.0,Spins well. Great pigtail cypher.
5.0,Really feels good and looks attractive. Will buy another in another color.
5.0,"In the best way— these feel home made. This strap holder is a supple and soft leather, with a metal no-sew button stud like you find on denim jeans and jackets . I expect the product will be durable and stand along the more expensive Name brand which has a detachable plastic button."
5.0,Really cute. Liked it more than i thought.
5.0,Love this brand of socks!
5.0,"Nice Lightweight Shirt , i ordered a medium  and i am so Happy that i ordered a medium instead of a Large,,,, shirt runs big and i am Happy with this shirt,  it is very comfortable and you stay nice and dry on a hot day , Good material and shirt looks classy"
5.0,It's silky but thick fabric. It looks elegant.
5.0,I like the product and it is used for cycling.
5.0,perfect fit and was just as described
5.0,I  wish the price  was  more  accessible. Great as  a gift.
5.0,"Love this shirt. Got it in grey, green and blue. I returned the ""yellow"" one as the material didnt feel near as soft. For some reason the red sleeves arent rhe same material which was super disappointing.  That said I love the 3 I ended up with. They are my new favorite shirt. I recommend sizing down if you want a slightly more fitted feel. It fits more like a unisex t shirt if you go a size down."
5.0,Gorgeous floral dress even better than picture. Fit perfectly.
5.0,Reffing High School Soccer
5.0,Our daughter loved this dress.
5.0,Absolutely not see through

5.0,"Good fit, doesn't hurt my ears, provides great coverage - no light leaking around the edges."
5.0,"We loved it, my girls have a very pettite face and just recently were told they needed glasses, well first time using them, and being a pair or very active toddlers i knew those glasses wouldnt last a whole day, so i serched online for something that would hold them from falling and i was planning on taking them back to the eye doctor to have them fix or something.<br />And i bumped into this crossed my fingers and when they arrived..wohooo best purchase ever, they loved the colors the addaptors are confortable, helps keep them on the stap from not falling, loveley colors and the got to pick their favorite...i even got to give one from my grandma.<br />Easy to wipe clean easy to put on or take of, soft and stylish. I recomend them 100%!!"
5.0,"Franco Sarto makes the most comfortable high heels I have ever worn.<br />I've owned several of his shoes over the last decade and found that I stopped wearing the other shoes since the Sarto's are so much more comfortable.  So I decided to give these a try.<br />Right off the bat they feel like a comfortable pair of slippers, even though the heels are over 3&#34; high.  They also look very stylish.  Very satisfied with the purchase."
5.0,This necklace is even better in person. Great investment
5.0,"I had a different expectation for how this would look on me, it's silly. Looks more like a park ranger hat than whatever I was expecting. I was going for a cute lil kayakin hat, got a cowboy hat with a small brim and a pink ribbon around it. It's a quality hat, it's been through a lot and still pops back into shape, but it's not what I was going for. It looks exactly like the Amazon photos in person though, so that's good I guess."
5.0,very good socks. would buy again
5.0,"great sweatsuit! Long on length, small at waist for 5/6 size. Jacket is right at 5/6 size. Love the print on the jacket. I'll have a little ninja running around for sure."
5.0,I ordered a size up as recommended in reviews and it fit perfectly.  The dress looks nice and is slimming in the waist.  The material is a little scratchy but the fit is so nice that I can overlook that.
5.0,This tee is so cute and great quality! My kid's preschool tie-dyed shirts and it came out SUPER CUTE!
5.0,"Recipient liked them very much, they look nice and sharp on his shirt, thank you!"
5.0,"Absolutely loved it! Was worried because I'm on the thick side, but fit me without rearranging my organs. Very cute!"
5.0,"This is a great parka for people who want something simple that doesn't shed feathers and keeps you warm. I love it. I've had it for a good month or so and it hasn't lost a whole bunch of feathers, which is more than I can say for the down parka I bought at Macy's. This is also very nice to have on a cold night. Overall great buy"
5.0,"Packaged nicely and arrived a whole lot sooner than it said. Beautiful tapers, nice quality"
5.0,Perfect Dorothy dress and fit as expected. Nice quality for the price!
5.0,Really nice. Much better than expected for the price. Perfect size.
5.0,This is a very nice tote but returned it because it was bigger than I thought it would be.
5.0,Love Vera paisley patterns and needed a bag like this
5.0,"Great shirt! I did have to exchange the L for an XL, only because it was too tight across the bust. Even with the XL, I had to put a safety pin between two of the buttons so it wouldn’t gap open. I do usually wear a L shirt, just for reference.<br />But the shirt itself is beautiful, I feel very comfortable in it, and I want to buy one in all the colors offered."

5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised! Great fit, not really shiny, very black. Love them. Great pants for the price. Perfect for hot yoga."
5.0,I wear this jacket all the time. It's light weight and perfect for the cool days. The only complaint I do have is the tie string around the hooded portion was not knotted at each end so within 2 days one end had moved up into the material and I had to fish it out. They now are knotted to prevent that from happening again.
5.0,Love it .. ordered size Large & wear size 12-14 & 36DD fit good not snug .. flows beautiful & light weight
5.0,love it. get so many compliments on it.
5.0,The quality is great! There are multiple adjustable links to customize your size. I like how flat it lays on my wrist. I am on a computer all day so some bracelet bands can be uncomfortable but this band is very comfortable! Would recommend!

5.0,It's soo pretty. It had arrived on time. Charms and safety lock are not included. I would buy again
5.0,If my daughter could wear this outfit Everyday she would. She wrote it on Christmas and got so many compliments. Price was Affordable as well!

5.0,Bought these for my husband. We both are happy with the way they look!
5.0,"After reading the reviews I ordered a large and it fit perfectly! For reference I'm 5', 130 lbs and a 32 B! This suit is really adorable and unique. It comes just under my belly button and helps to disguise all of my sins. :)"
5.0,I TOTALLY LOVE THESE SHOES...<br />THEY ARE SO COMFORTABLE AND I CAN WALK AND WALK IN THEM

5.0,"Nice and comfy. Bought them for my wife, she loves them"
5.0,"Fits perfect, I'm 5'7"" and 175 lbs. Just wash and its ready to go. The red accents make you look wider in the shoulders."

5.0,It’s exactly what I needed and arrived so fast!
5.0,Bought this jewelry set for a military ball. Extremely surprised at how elegant and NOT cheap looking the set was. It held up really well also. I was very happy with this purchase.
5.0,I liked them until the elastic started not staying up on my arm so soon. I wear them to cover my arms from the sun. They do work great.  Just dissatisfied with the elastic.
5.0,Used for years as tote for work
5.0,"This is a really nice leather backpack. Very sturdy, useful and attractive. It arrived promptly and was true to the description. Glad I bought it."

5.0,"Goes perfect with a lot of different dresses and tops, recommended"
5.0,Real men rock purple. I bought this beanie to work with a Fortnite costume (loot lama) But he wore it for a month. Just a regular beanie. Thick enough. Seemed like good quality.
5.0,I freaking love this dress. Fit perfect. I want every pattern.
5.0,Love love loveee this product!!! Worked for all type of shoes and materials. Does wonders.
5.0,Wonder!!!! Outfit runs small but fits perfect. A tad bit sheer so wear skin tone underneath.
5.0,"Got many compliments, definitely worth it to get these!"
5.0,"This is a wow,  just great cardigan!!! It’s very comfortable,fits true to size,  nice soft material, not over clingy and hot!  It is versatile to wear, you can dress it up for work or dress it down and use on the weekends with a nice pair of jeans. Looks very, very expensive!! I bought 4 colors: black, beige, light blue, light pink. Have gotten so many compliments.<br />My only regret is I couldn’t get my size in the other 2 colors I wanted, which were the brown and navy!<br />They sold out super fast. Been checking to see availability in colors in my size, which is XL.<br />Buy!! You won’t regret!!"
5.0,These fit well over my glasses when I just didn't want to be bothered with my contacts and they also wear well alone.  Very pleased with them. Took these out on my hikes and they also kept the bugs out of my eyes with the wraparound style.
5.0,Excellent quality and design!
5.0,"Love this seamless bandana, very pretty.  Bought it for COVID and by the time it arrived we learned you needed to wear masks with double or triple thickness.  But!!  No problem.  You can easily double this and pull it up to cover up properly.  Great purchase!"
5.0,My granddaughter loved it!  It was exactly what she wanted!
5.0,"True to size, and surprisingly well made! I expected it to be thin but it's a well made, thick material."
5.0,The Amulet is as good as described and looks.  It has the right amount of weight to not feel cheap or too heavy to wear.  I am wearing it for a Halloween pet therapy event primarily for children.  With my dog's red cape and this Amulet it should cheer up a lot of sick kids.
5.0,Well constructed unique design I like it However it is extremely  Heavy  Watch
5.0,Great item with a case to keep them.
5.0,"Fit perfect for my 9 month old who was 27&#34; during Halloween. Now that he is 10 months the legs and arms are a bit short. The quality is superb! Very thick stretchy soft  material with kam snaps running alongside under the leg. The neck opening easily stretched to fit over his head. My son hates things going over his head and this was relatively pain free. My only peeve has nothing to do with the product, but that a great majority of people (young and old) thought he was dressed as Uma Thurman in Kill Bill.... @@"
5.0,These earrings are a perfect size.  They are not to heavy or bulky.  They do not infect my ears.  I hope the quality lasts.  I like the money back guarantee if it doesn't!
5.0,It was beautiful!  Perfect for the denim and diamonds affair.  We nicknamed the belt Elvis.

5.0,I looooo r these. They’re so thick & soft. Actually keeps my foot warm
5.0,"My dragon loving daughter loved these. I put them in her Easter basket and she wore one to match her outfit for several days after. At first I thought they were priced a bit high but they really aren’t, they are basically a dollar a piece plus a dollar for the case they come in (which is great for keeping them organized and not lost in the sea of other stuff on the dresser). I would recommend them. Both my 10 and 12 year old wear them."
5.0,Fit as expected. Delivery of item was better then expected
5.0,"Nothing not to like, fit great. Love the fabric."

5.0,"Fit great,  comfortable,  flattering!!!"
5.0,This capelet was perfect for a Minnesota winter! I broke my arm in November...terrible timing since we were heading into a cold winter here in Minnesota! I couldn't wear anything with sleeves for several months and I was trying to come up with a solution for subzero temperatures. I bought this lovely capelet and it kept me warm and cozy even on our coldest nights! I used a thermal compression sleeve (usually cyclists use them) to keep my bare arm warm and protected. My occupational therapists were impressed with this capelet as well...they had never seen one before! I highly recommend if you're dealing with a situation like mine or if you need a similar adaptation!
5.0,Love.  I have worn bracelet continuously since receiving it.  Will definitely buy again.
5.0,"Thank you so much! The size I purchased was an XL and I love how this fits! Also the fabric is very nice. My waist is a bit thick (35in) but I think once I lose a couple more inches off my waist it will be perfect. I am also busty, (41in) but the fabric stretches really well."
5.0,"Great quality!! I ordered a bigger size thinking they were running small Nope. They are true to size. They are sharp, comfortable and professional."
5.0,My mom loved it maybe cos it was from me hahaha have a nice day
5.0,Got many compliments on this ring but tarnished very quickly too bad cause I really love my ring.

5.0,Great gift for my boyfriend.
5.0,"I LOVE THIS SHIRT! I'm usually an XL/xxl in teens (depending on the level of bloating) I ordered a 1x and it for perfect! I order the red color as well, very vibrant! I will be ordering more!"
5.0,"Im about 200lbs, 5'8, small chest. I got the 2x to be safe and i was quite surprised and happy with this shirt. I got the light blue and its definitely true to size. I could have gotten xl for a better fit but i can fix it with a simple hem. Its flowy and light and its COTTON! I was expecting some non-stretchy material. It looks just like the pic and i already washed it (no shrinkage, maybe i should have put it in dryer). Already got compliments on it. Sits right on the body, super soft, long, flowy and comfortable. Glad i took a chance!"
5.0,Anything polka dot it love!
5.0,These leggings are so soft and are breathable!! They move with my body and stretch super well! I love these leggings.

5.0,Screen is able  to read
5.0,Adorable! Hit of the under the sea party!
5.0,Very handy to have when someone visits unexpectantly.  Wears and washes very well!
5.0,Recommend it to everyone true to its color. Exactly like the picture.
5.0,I get compliments on this every single time I wear it.
5.0,"These are comfortable and don't ride up like I thought they might. I bought them to wear with pants that fit a little tighter in the thighs and seat, that would cause my boxer briefs to bunch up. These were exactly what I needed."
5.0,"Love this dress so comfy, and loose fitting as pictured."
5.0,Fit very good on my goggles and they block the sun well
5.0,nice! wish it had more pockets

5.0,I ordered 2 packs and got 2 sets of the same 7 stones but they are different and very pretty
5.0,"These coveralls are now my favorite ones I own... very vibrant and fit really well. I wear them for fashion purposes, not work, though."
5.0,I ordered the 7&#34; it's slightly too big but when I wear a head band underneath it fits perfectly
5.0,"I took a gamble by ordering this so close to my trip that’s 2 days away and I’m so glad I did. I purchased this for a fall beach trip and wanted something light and versatile for cool beach mornings and evening. This sweater overdelivered. The details and quality are even better in person. I didn’t expect to love it as much as I do, and I’ll probably wear it a lot at work and with jeans after my trip.<br /><br />Sizing - I usually wear a XS or S in (jcrew and old navy for reference) but followed the other reviewers comments and ordered up. I’m 5’4” and 125 lbs and the medium is perfect on me."
5.0,Bling bling bling I love it Ty
5.0,"Came just as pictured and I love the champagne color! Slightly heavier than I would like, I probably won't wear them all day. Great earrings"
5.0,I absolutely love these jeans and will order another pair. They smelled like bleach but after a few washings the smell went away. So comfortable! You can wear them rolled up or down for a nice straight leg look.
5.0,I bought this for my 13 yo niece and she love it. Would recommend and will buy again.
5.0,Muy linda y útil para diferentes usos porque tiene capacidad para varias cosas y muy buen tamaño me encanto.Gracias.
5.0,This watch is simple yet sophisticated. I love the sleek yet feminine design of this watch. I would highly recommend this to friends and family!
5.0,Fantastic fit and breath ability
5.0,"This was a super fun holiday addition for my daughter's Mini Cooper. This reindeer antler set withstood rain, snow, and wind. On several occasions we had people smiling and giving thumb's up when we were stopped at a red light. We have it stored away ready to use next Christmas season."
5.0,"I bought this chain back in 2018, 4 years later it's still shining like brand new. All I do is give it some basic polishing, keep it away from water, and store it in a jewelry box out of direct sunlight. People always compliment this and ask if it's real. On top of that it's only $10 so if it does eventually tarnish I can buy a new one no problem 👍"
5.0,"I am very peculiar about my wallets. This is the first wallet in years that I have liked! It is attractive, compact, and holds the exact amount of money and cards I prefer to carry."
5.0,Solar y presicion y resistente al agua
5.0,Turns too easily in terms of color
5.0,Arrived nearly packaged and not crushed. Fit as expected.

5.0,"I have had the same slippers for years and didn't want a new pair, but I have to say these are nice and fit well."
5.0,Very comfortable love the no tag
5.0,"I have had these for 4 years. They are comfortable and I use them for shooting, chain sawing, and other activities that tend to be noisy. Sometimes, (like shooting) I use them in addition to foam ear plugs for maximum protection of my hearing. I would buy these again and recommend them to others."
5.0,Bought this for a cat lover friend. Was small but very nice.  She loved it. Will buy again for another soon
5.0,The sunglasses are adorable and fit great! They fit amazing and the lenses are easy to see through .
5.0,"Used on a Trollbeads bracelet I have and it worked great!  Shined the silver very nicely, does take a little effort though."
5.0,"My husband has been wearing his since they came with no issue. Just like everyone said buy a size small because it stretches. It fit tightly at first. My husband works on helicopters, and this has not caused any issues. He loves t and is very comfortable with it. I recently started wearing one of them when I lift weights and I also love it! It makes lifting easier, because j do not like to be without my wedding ring."
5.0,This is the first dress that I purchased that was true to size. The chest and the waist fit perfect. The quality was good as well.
5.0,loves the cargo pockets abd light weight!
5.0,"I'll be honest, I ordered this watch and when the first one arrived it had hair imbedded and finger prints on it and the band was chewed up and missing part of itself. Hopefully that order gets taken out of rotation, it was a HUGE discouragement and I almost cancelled completely to go with another brand or a g-shock.<br /><br />But I called amazon to complain and they took great care of me and sent me a new replacement right away.<br /><br />I am extremely happy with this watch. It is as accurate as everyone has said and it fits my wrist perfectly. I needed a watch for the military, I go to basic training soon and then who knows where to after. I needed something reliable that would withstand a lot and also be able to help me along the way and I believe this watch is the one that will provide just that.<br /><br />The atomic time keeping will help when traveling, the barometer will help when I'm out in the field and if I need the compass along the way, it's perfectly placed on my arm for easy access.<br /><br />I am very pleased"
5.0,I own this necklace in two colors.  I wear lots of black and white.  This necklace is perfect for my work wardrobe.
5.0,"This is just a wonderful dress. I actually have this EXACT dress in brien but it's Kenneth Cole! I paid a fortune for it and this one is every bit as good.  The cut would be flattering to nearly everyone and it's very forgiving; belt can be cinched to be flattering, but it can be worn on &#34;fat days&#34; too. Washes very well."
5.0,"LOVE THEM! Cute, sexy casual and not too high. They are super comfortable also! Can't wait to order other colors available!"
5.0,"Perfect wintertime pjs for my lil guy. Great fit, nice and snuggy. Buying more soon."
5.0,Go Gators! Hat fits well and looks great.
5.0,"Ordered for my husband who hates to wear shorts and doesn't like netting lining.  They do dry fast and he seems pretty comfortable in them.  With draw string they stay up when getting out of pool.  Oh yes, I bought them as swim trunks because of netting lining in swim trunks.  I couldn't find swim trunks without them.  These are a perfect length for my husband who hates short shorts.  They aren't to loose either so they don't look like a little kids shorts."
5.0,They look exactly like the picture. They were exactly what I expected. I love them. Will be buying another pair
5.0,Feels soft yet provides adequate supportive
5.0,Gorgeous loveit
5.0,Apple watch

5.0,Great I ordered multiple.
5.0,Delivered as expected.  Product quality exceeded expectations for price point.
5.0,"Ordered a small and fit really well. Happy with the cut on the legs and the material, great one piece for the price!"
5.0,"Value prices and pretty!  I love it that these are adjustable!  I can literally wear them anywhere...thumbs, mid pointer, any finger and as toe rings.  They are dainty yet durable.  Stack them or wear alone.  The silver also makes my light skin look tanner, I'll take that!"
5.0,A surprise 70th birthday party.
5.0,"very sturdy and durable. goes perfect on any pair of jeans. just be careful because even though it doesn't weigh a million pounds, it's definitely a noticeable weight"
5.0,"Love the dress, however it’s too long on me. I’m 5.4” and weigh 125. The dress is a little too long but I tied it again and it helped. Overall for the price can’t complain."
5.0,"Absolutely love the style, fit and quality of these shirts. I have many colors, want them all!"
5.0,My kids use both in the pool and running around
5.0,Looks great and great price
5.0,I just love theses jeans there very comfortable and I would buy them again
5.0,"I bought this for my wife (in the picture) as a nice every day jacket. It's sporty, cozy enough for mild winter days down here in Texas. Light enough that it can be packed away in it's included pack and stowed easily, if it gets too warm for wearing, while we're out and about. Very well made out of quality material. My wife REALLY likes it."
5.0,Not good for adult women but perfect for teenagers. I bought it and cut the strap to shorten it for my 2 year old who loves purses. She loves it. She Carey's post it pad and pen so she can write wherever she goes. It's perfect. Light weight.
5.0,"The dress is beautiful, I just bought the wrong size. This dress is very form fitting, so make sure you go by your measurements. The size chart is spot on."
5.0,"Great comfort, fit, quality."
5.0,"I got the green color.  I needed a hat that would fit my baby dreadlocks (about 6&#34; or less long) and this is great.  Won't fit once the dreads get longer, though.  It is a super cute look, soft, and have been wearing it all over the place.  Colorado winter is just starting (late) but kept my head warm the other night when the low was 20*.  Thinking about ordering a couple more, my only complaint is I wish they had more colors!"
5.0,Nice hat with excellent detail
5.0,"super comfy, pretty color and pattern!<br />I love it!"
5.0,"Really love this product! The kimono looks great, and the delivery was surprisingly quick. It's a really nice kimono, but there were some minor details I noticed. In the pictures provided the flowers look pale or somewhat white but they're actually pink which I honestly don't mind. The kimono is still appealing. There were also a couple of loose strings, but they can be fixed quickly with a pair of scissors. Overall very satisfied with the product."
5.0,The shirt fit better than I expected! I'm 237lbs and it fits me nicely! I would definitely recommend!
5.0,Very please with this purchase. My grandson is going to love these PJ’s! They a so soft and glow in the dark so vividly. Would definitely recommend to any dinosaur lover.
5.0,"I bought this for my husband who is 6'1&#34; 180 pounds. It fits him perfectly. The quality is extremely nice. Very soft and thick. If you're a Who fan, you're going to love this robe!"
5.0,Love the slim buckle
5.0,"I love this visor!  Perfect fit.  The Velcro closure makes it perfectly adjustable.  After a year of frequent outdoor wear, the color is starting to fade.  I’m going to purchase the same visor in white this time!"
5.0,I love this dress! Perfect above the knee length for a summer type of dress. Just enough stretch without being overly stretchy. Machine washes well without any visible shrinkage. The fabric is soft and seems fairly durable. I’m good for trying to find a cheap-ish dress to stay in my wardrobe because I’m a dress-person and I like to buy them at a fair price point without worrying if they’d fall apart or not.
5.0,"beautiful love it thank you so much,it has so much room ut not overly large,just the right size and love the color."
5.0,Gorgeous!!! Have already gotten several compliments when wearing. The pic doesn't do it justice bc the color is an absolutely perfect blend of blues!! I highly recommend!! And it's quite light weight as well.
5.0,Super cool gift. Friends are always impressed with this item.
5.0,Love these earrings.  Perfect size and fit.
5.0,"Sturdy, pretty!!! Lots of comments!"
5.0,They are more than what I expected and warm
5.0,Like the dress I just didn't get the right side it was to  Type
5.0,"Having been asked to honestly review these shoes - here goes. I have not worn them at any length yet. However I have had them on to try inside the house. They are form fitting and visually appealing, stretch material. Time will tell how well they hold up for walking around longer than a few minutes on rugs."
5.0,Very pleased with quality and sin filtering.
5.0,"My dress is beautiful, I love it .. Thinking about ordering another color.  Thanks 5 stars all the way"
5.0,Better quality than I thought for the price. Definitely well worth it and I will be ordering more in different colors
5.0,Super cute! My daughter wears these boots every day. Great quality.
5.0,"I like the product,  very good quality."
5.0,"This fitbit band slips on and off. I believe it will last much longer than previous bands because you are not buckling and unbuckling every day. With the old band, sometimes I would sweat under the band. This one fits loose enough that I have not, even in this current heat wave. It fits loose and is comfortable but stays on and still registers correctly the steps. And I really like the patterns on the bands. I have gotten numerous compliments.  I would definitely purchase again but think it will probably be a long time before I need to replace."
5.0,PERFECT - using for an Ursula Costume and is amazing!
5.0,"Just as described and very good quality , wash and wear well."
5.0,Good quality sports shorts.  My daughter uses them for gymnastics and they fit well for this.
5.0,"Great for those sexy low cut dresses. The front is obviously low cut but the back sits low as well, at least for the size i got. I ordered a 34 C and it is perfect but i heard the band gets thicker the larger the size. None the less, I love it!"
5.0,All these items are wonderful they are worth the money I have no regrets about my purchase nice nice!!! !
5.0,"Beautiful dress wearing for a wedding, bought the elegant green one and bride changed mind so bought  thd blush pink.....both very pretty"
5.0,Soft and as expected. I bought mine from Walmart though and it was only just under $8 so...
5.0,"Fit perfect but the arm holes are slightly large for me but I actually have skinny arms. I still Love it. 5'3&#34;, 165lb, 40DD"
5.0,"These double sided earrings are so cute! They are stainless steel so even my daughter who has a nickel allergy has had no adverse reactions to them. They are super easy to use, the big part goes at the back of the ear lobe. They are easy to fit together and they are no loose. No chance of losing the backs to these. These are made very well and look amazing on. We have had so many compliments on these earrings! Anyone looking for a different style earring, I can recommend these.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this item for free or at a discounted price for my honest unbiased opinion."
5.0,Helps with balance
5.0,Very good they work

5.0,Great item. I highly recommend it. Fits try to size & got lots of compliments on the dress.
5.0,My little girl loves these glasses! so stinking cute on!
5.0,My grand baby look awesome in the outfit.  I love it.
5.0,Perfect. Exactly what I was looking for
5.0,I do not own expensive jewelry.  The JG 14K Real Gold Plated Thick Hoops Earrings for Women look like the “real thing” and make me feel like I do own expensive jewelry.  The gold is very shiny and the glass stones could pass for diamonds.  The stones are placed strategically in the right center of the earring.  They are visible to others looking at you and when you move they are large enough that they move too and the stones<br />Glisten.  The post closure is sturdy so there is not chance of the earrings accidentally falling out.  I will feel special every time I wear them.  They are definitely a 5.
5.0,Bad ass Cubs hat!!!!!!!
5.0,I have used them on Saturday for the first time right out of the case. My wife was impressed with how they looked. I was impressed with how they worked! I love the idea of the case. It seems tight and I will put a piece of lens cloth over the lens when I put them away.
5.0,Head pieces where very beautiful. I purchased th for my bridesmaids
5.0,Great product.  Simple and effective
5.0,Looks and functions just like the original<br />No complaints
5.0,"This product was exactly as described, absolutely perfect fit."
5.0,"My daughter just loved this when she found it in her stocking! It was well made, nicely packaged, and came when it was supposed to. I'm very happy with the product and the seller"
5.0,"I purchased 3 of these slim wallets.  Red, brown and black.  The main reason for the purchase was for my son who was entering boot camp.  They are not allowed to bring much, but required to bring an ID, SSN card, debit card and a phone calling card along with a small amount of cash.  This was perfect for that.  I went a ahead and picked the other two up for me and hubby.  We are out and about frequently and these are great because they hold what you need for running errands.  Fits well inside a pocket.  I also just use mine in my purse as well it is very convenient to pull in and out.  My husband thinks this is just the travel wallet he was looking for.<br /><br />We have no issues with getting the cards in and out of the slots. Not too tight - just right.  Nothing will fall out.  I am able to carry a few $ bills comfortably - between $20-$30.  They are nice leather and the colors are true.  I love my red one!<br /><br />Very pleased with the functionality, appearance and the size.  Good price as well.  Would make a nice small gift or stocking stuffer.  Perfect for travel, hiking or biking."
5.0,great fit & nice material
5.0,I use myself its perfect
5.0,Soft. Light but warm. Color is like photo.
5.0,Husband loves them. COOL AND COMFORTABLE
5.0,My wrist is slightly larger than 7.5 and this bracelet fits perfectly.
5.0,This robe is itchy..
5.0,Bought these pins (and others) got my wedding in Oct ‘21. I put the Drakkon gold pin on my work ID and it still looks great after all this time.
5.0,I like the look of the shirt. It's a little tight in the shoulders compared to other medium sized shirts so maybe order up one size. I have two of them and they both fit the same.
5.0,"I love these jeans! I felt bad having to say I wore a plus size, but I think the sizing is small as usual. I ordered a size larger as I want to put them in the dryer. The fabric is heavier, so they look like real jeans and not leggings. I'm not crazy about the orange colored stitching, but can live with it. No smell, like the others I have ordered. The price difference is totally worth it. The wider waistband and a bit higher rise is so much better. Smoother under sweaters. I'm buying another pair and returning the smelly others I purchased."
5.0,This hat is so Adorable!! I bought it for my niece and she looked beautiful in it. Definitely recommend this item.
5.0,"Perfect for cold weather, my daughter plays soccer and it works perfect!"
5.0,Very nice boots. I gave them to my grandson and he loved them. Very very good product.
5.0,"Looks great and offers great protection from everything but heavy books in backpacks. Now I can toss it in my coat pocket with my keys and not worry about dust, lint, or scratches."
5.0,"Works perfectly, except the polkadot ones leave little circles on your legs if they swell for a period of time. Love them anyway!"
5.0,"I purchased these for an upcoming trip to India and they're perfect. I was afraid they would be too much for my petite frame but they have great drape and don't look bulky.<br /><br />Super comfortable and I wish they came in more colors-I maven wear them for my long haul, nineteen hour journey to Delhi."
5.0,"This hat is solidly put together and a really nice build for the price. It does run a little big, but if you have a big head like me, you will appreciate a hat that actually comfortably fits. Great buy."
5.0,"These glasses fit perfectly and really help when working at my computer for a long time, it’s very light, comfortable and the colors stay true I’m honestly surprised how well they work for me."
5.0,Definitely would buy again. They are so cute
5.0,"It is a good material. My husband liked it. Practical,  I recommended it.  The only problem was the size, it was big."
5.0,"Super cute!  Perfect for my Princess Jasmine costume or a night out when you want glammed up!  When it arrived,  one of the draping links was loose. It was an easy fix!"
5.0,"My Boyfriend bought me these & at first I wasn't sure.....well, I wore them with a few girlfriends & they all own several pair now!  They're light & great for warm weather!  I can't say enough good about them!  Dressed up or down.....plus they wash nicely & are inexpensive!!!!  Just bought 2 pairs for a friends B'day!!!!"
5.0,My 11 year old granddaughter loved these socks because they were pink and had the Eiffel Tower on them.  Her name is Paris and she loves anything that has to do with Paris France.
5.0,Affordable and durable plastic gloves.

5.0,I like got it match my other purse. In the same pattern I put different color key ring on its to find it.<br />I love it
5.0,"I love the lilac and teal colors. The quality is good. I went from a small to medium and the medium wasn’t much bigger. I’m usually a small but the waist was too tight on the small. They are long enough for me, and I’m 5’8”."
5.0,"Bought these to replace a $20 pair that had broken. They look the exact same, and the quality is great for the price point."
5.0,I bought 2 of these hats for my daughters age 7 and 3.  The adjustable band is Velcro so it's easy to use.  Both girls love their unicorn baseball cap!
5.0,"I ordered this, knowing the fabric was considered “lightweight.” I was a bit concerned that it would be too flimsy to provide some warmth, but it is just perfect! Not to warm and not too cold! The pattern is beautiful and it looks great. The only thing I would change would be the belt placement - I would prefer that it sat lower on my waistline - but I knew it was more of an empire waistline when I ordered it. I would highly recommend this product."
5.0,"I purchased this bag to use for short trips or as a carry-on bag when flying.  I was worried it wouldn't be quite big enough, but it proved me wrong!  I took it out for a spin last weekend, and it worked great!  I was able to store my 17in laptop, it's charger, extra phone charger, battery backup, a notebook, 2 pairs of jeans, 2 shirts, 2 sets of socks/underwear/etc... and a small bag of toiletries, all in the main compartment! There was even room left over if I'd needed to add a few more items! Aside from the main compartment, there are also plenty of little pockets for storing small things like ear buds, pens, wallet, keys, etc...  The look of the bag is great.  I love its bohemian-chic aesthetic, with the dark body and bright pop of color in the center panel.  The versatility of being able to wear it over the shoulder, or as a backpack is a HUGE plus, as well.  This bag has Form and Function in spades!  Great buy!"
5.0,I was very satisfied with my purchase ‼️
5.0,"Love the vivid colors, No mistaking my bag at the airport anymore !"
5.0,Christmas gift for my grandson.  He had two to pick from and decided on thiabone
5.0,"This dress is a light and soft fabric, perfect for fall and it's really cute. I have gotten alot of compliments on this so far. Its a little tight going over the hips if you have curve to your hips but fits nicely after it goes over them. I will be wearing this dress alot, love it!"
5.0,Like sturdy
5.0,The pocket hat is a great hat for just wearing around your house or taking on a trip.  It is pack able in a suitcase or in a briefcase.
5.0,Perfect for its purpose as a training leotard.
5.0,Needed a Scarlet Witch Tiara for Halloween. This set is perfect. The tiara is comfortable and fits well and the necklace is a nice touch. Comes in a gorgeous box with a certificate of authenticity. Highly recommend!

5.0,"My 13yr old absolutely loves this necklace.  It is double layer, made well, great clasp and the pendant sits well and is secure.  The prefect length and goes well with many outfits.  Great price. Highly recommend."
5.0,This is a high quality replacement watch band. The material feels nice against your skin and will last.
5.0,I absolutely love it. I recommend wearing it with a black top. I also liked how it arrived in time. I've gotten a lot of compliments. You cannot beat the price deal either!
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:86bc977571b885d094d807c59a0fc747]] This Wooden Wrist Watch by Bewell is a very pretty watch, definitely different from the norm, in a very good way. The wood grain makes the watch very beautiful and unusual. The weight of the watch is very light, the face is easy to see, and the watch is very comfortable to wear. This watch would be a wonderful gift for the man who has everything because of it's uniqueness. The watch is very well made and will make a great gift for my stepfather for Christmas. I may purchase another for a Christmas gift for someone else, now that I have seen the quality up close. Sometimes I review products here on Amazon for selected companies, and this is one of those times. As with any product or experience, your results may vary, this is simply my opinion. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
5.0,"I bought several of these and gave to fans in my Walking Dead club. They are so well made and the quality is awesome. I’m still getting compliments when I wear it and it’s been almost 2 years since purchase. I work out in it and shower in it, no fading or rusting yet. You’re definitely getting quality with these necklaces."
5.0,These were perfect for my son who was going to a conference out of state. Everyone adored them!
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for a young woman's 16th birthday. She absolutely loved it! It is beautifully crafted, nice metal hardware, stitching is spot on. It is just the right size for holding a phone, a lip gloss and a couple of cards and cash."
5.0,"I am surprised at the quality of this product! These are glass beads, not plastic. The large faceted beads are very sparkly. It is a tad too long for me but the length is as advertised and reviewed. This was bought for a 20s themed wedding and it will fit the bill. You can't beat the price, it has heft to it and a pleasing sound when you move, just like the flappers wore."
5.0,"This is absolutely perfect for Alice!! It comes with the dress, apron, and headband/bow, which you can remove if wanted. It was the cheapest price yet best quality costume I found. It fit perfect and was super cute. I'm 5'7-5'8 and about 148 lbs with a 34&#34; chest. It fit me well in the waist and length, but I honestly don't know if anyone with a bustier chest would feel comfortable in it. That was the only place was close to not fitting well. Overall, I loved it!!"
5.0,"I love it, but I am 5ft 8 and weigh 150 and I had to get the biggest size. I do wear a D bra but the hips are small like others said, and I have small hips.  also the price is great."
5.0,A good length for me and it's super soft! (5'6 140lbs+ and I got a medium.
5.0,Nice: Light and pack-able travel dress. Not long--am 5 fit tall and it hit me mid-knee.
5.0,Was completely as expected. Would buy from again!!
5.0,This ring is so pretty!!!
5.0,This tutu is perfect. The color was wonderful. The quality is wonderful. Would recommend.
5.0,Will be buying more soon! Quality is as nice as some of my more expensive pairs of workout pants for a third of the price. Love the pockets too!
5.0,"I bought this because I love the show 'Breaking Bad' and I needed new sunglasses. Never 'lend' your sunglasses to a 14 y.o. If you get them back, you'll be lucky to see through the scratches.Regardless, these glasses are clear and provide excellent eye protection. They are stylish as well. There's nothing cheap about these glasses."
5.0,"I love the color, it fits just right and doesn't look cheap."
5.0,Good material was perfect size
5.0,"Beautiful, quality . Would encourage friend to buy."
5.0,This case helps keep my watch safe from damage if I drop it in the shop
5.0,Very smart. Good quality.
5.0,I ordered this blue butterfly bracelet and a pink one.  My granddaughters loved them.  They are beautiful and of good quality.
5.0,"My wife said she wanted the kids to get her pearl earrings for her birthday and was very clear that she did NOT want as she put it, ""Old Lady Pearls"". After some searching we found this beautiful pair on Amazon. Once they arrived I inspected the quality and was amazed at how beautiful the pearls were. Truly, the images online don't do them justice and my wife absolutely loved them!"
5.0,"I love it, soft and fits perfectly"
5.0,Super cute & comfortable!  It fits so nice that I bought a few different colors.
5.0,"Love, love, love this suit. Gave me coverage where I needed it and I loved the color. Material was a little flimsy but I still love it!"
5.0,I am so impressed! I have a hard time believing that these aren't Aligns... They fit even better in my opinion! The material seems almost identical... I will definitely be picking these up in more colors.
5.0,Comfy and cute!!
5.0,"I’m a big fan! Maybe create a version with a Velcro strip on the back side for name tapes. Otherwise, satisfied customer right here!"
5.0,I love how it looks it’s perfect on her
5.0,What you'd expect. Flimsy but sturdy fabric that conforms to face.
5.0,"Unlike most scarves or bandanas being used as a mask/face covering, this one is actually thick enough to inspire some confidence that it will protect you from airborne particulate or viruses. While I won’t promise that it will, I will say that it has a tight enough weave to pass the candle test. It also comes with a filter slot and pm 2.5 filters, which when inserted definitely add another layer of protection.<br /><br />My only dislike is that if you tie the scarf over your mouth and place the knot behind your head without it resting on top of a ponytail or headscarf, it slips easily. I wear a headscarf, and normally have a second bandana tied underneath it around my forehead, which I can rest the knot of the one tied around my face on top of to keep it very secure. It comes in a pack of two, so I recommend using both at the same time in this manner.<br /><br />It can also sometimes be a bit hard to breath while the filter in, although not so hard that I have to remove it. Just something to be mindful of."
5.0,A little confusing to put on af first but you’ll get it eventually
5.0,I loved it and I lost it and I will be ordering another one because I thought it was beautiful.
5.0,"I’m five feet 118 lbs and ordered a size small and it fit just perfect. It’s a maxi dress on me right by my ankles which I love because I never find dresses that don’t sweep and need alterations. Fit is a loose comfy dress, ordered the green khaki color and the color is rich and a true army color. Product is well made, good fabric and the stitching is perfect. Very much recommend!!!! Love that it also has pockets!!!"
5.0,I bought these for my granddaughter and she loves them. The fit is good and they seem well made.
5.0,I’ve actually owned these glasses before. They are great and easy to change out the lenses.
5.0,Really Cute!!
5.0,Item Returned.
5.0,Comfortable fit with wide waistband to avoid &#34;rollover&#34;.  Thick material so no panty lines (or cellulite) destroys the silhouette.
5.0,I normally wear a size XL or 14 the fit was a bit small around the waist but everything else fits perfectly. Super sexy!
5.0,My daughter will love these whn she gets them for Christmas.  She likes the lighter earrings and these fit the bill.
5.0,"Husband doesn’t like masks, but this one he will wear!!"
5.0,Nice sleek design. Came with a replacement straw which is extremely helpful. Will purchase again in a different color!
5.0,These work as expected to use your phone when they are on.  They are also stylish so they look great.

5.0,"I have been looking for a soft thin breathable socks in awhile, and this is it!"
5.0,These shower shoes really arent to bad they are a little narrow but they do hug your feet to where they dont feel like they will come off
5.0,Love this dress! Pretty color and has a nice fit! Will be purchasing more like this one
5.0,"This fits perfectly, is very comfortable and I love the color."
5.0,"Excellent fit and feel.  I had purchased a pair at a competitor for more money.<br />Got lucky and found them on Amazon for less.  Great to use as a pair of pajama pants also.<br />Slick finish makes it easy to slide your outside pants on over these.  If you're looking for something that will help to keep you warm without bulk, these are the ticket.  This style is not made for extreme cold weather though."
5.0,"Love these so much! They are perfect for my office job! Look very professional but don’t make you feel tight and restricted, almost feels like I’m wearing leggings! I am 5’10 so I ordered the longer size because I usually need longer than average, but these are a bit long on me and I have to roll them, I may try the middle length choice for my next pair (which I can’t wait to order!)"
5.0,Really beautiful<br /><br />Real luxury
5.0,This is a beautiful watch to add to my collection.
5.0,Get complements every time I'm in these. They're a bit warm tho so not summer wear in the South.
5.0,Beautiful!! Looks just like image shown
5.0,"They a little long , but they fit really well and so comfortable! I definitely recommend!"

5.0,"Enjoy wearing them, also have the necklace."
5.0,"I bought this belt for my son who has special needs. It is awesome. He is easily able to faster and unfasten it. He is in a size 14 slim, buy it can be let out even more as needed."
5.0,I was pleasantly surprised how cute this charm was...It was small but very well finished & looks lovely on my &#34;cat&#34; charm bracelet.  Not quite 3 dimensional but well finished on both sides (has an oval shape).  Well worth the money.
5.0,"Fit great, durable around seams. A lil thicker material, so are a lil warm, but are not lined."
5.0,Used for cousin Eddy costume. Very warm & well made.
5.0,"What can I add to the boatload of other 5-star reviews? Probably not much, because I’m about to echo a lot of what others have said. The fit is extremely flattering, with the empire waist and forgiving flowy fabric that hangs before my mom pooch, the racer back cut, and the long length. The fabric is a nice, soft jersey material that doesn’t withstand wrinkles, but doesn’t scream “iron me!” if you don’t have time to iron (and who can when you have a toddler around). I bought two of these dresses in different colors and I must say the purple is gorgeous in person. The red is just not quite my cuppa tea, but that’s of personal taste. I will be ordering more soon as my go-to summertime dress."
5.0,"Snap back, not too tall in the front like some hats. Beautiful heathered grey. My husband loves this hat!"
5.0,I bought this is for a gift for my niece.  She loved it!  Its a nice size with excellent detail.  Any Dr. Who fan would appreciate this.

5.0,SO CUTE! Good quality. Great gift for a Miyazaki fan!
5.0,I ordered a three pack and only received 1 pair
5.0,This is my go to camera strap. I attached it to my Sony A6300 and it makes bringing the camera around so easy. Not to mention i store my additional batteries in the strap zippered pockets so it’s really a great on the go strap.
5.0,Love these shorts withe the pockets in them very comfortable
5.0,it was just what I wanted.  I ordered two of them.
5.0,"Caught these on sale and thought I’d give them a try since I’m getting back to running more and hate the feeling of my phone and keys giggling in my shorts or joggers pocket loosely. Once they arrived, I tried them on and they seem like good quality and fits as expected. Perfect for holding my phone and car key fob while I run. Would buy again for sure."
5.0,I like these socks a lot!
5.0,Love it. Great workmanship.better then pic. So very happy that I decided to get it. Loved the reviews cause that’s what I go with.came right on time.never was interested in this kind of Jewery until I saw this. Very Happy with company. Great job.
5.0,My brother is a big guy and it was a great fit. Nice material as well. These s***s are a fun way to let family know that you are expecting!
5.0,Was exactly as pictured and fit was perfect.
5.0,"This is a great hat. When it first arrived the bill was a bit stiff, but it wore in quickly after it was in the water a time or two."
5.0,"Just right for a formal attire event without being too over-the-top.  Fits well and looks classy.  I added a crinoline under it for an even more vintage effect and it absolutely made the dress stunning.  This was purchased for a formal wedding and it was an absolute winner!  Quality dress, well made and classy."
5.0,You get 10 of these suckers! Useful for those polygamy relationships or you can be like me and go through ex-wives like IHOP does with pancakes... Had a Qalo ring for years and lost it (2015 Easter Colection Neon Yellow). So I bought this because it had the same color. These rings are more square-ish than qalo but does the job amazingly.
5.0,"Beautiful, clever crafting! t looks like an artisan made it. Very happy wearing this lovely bracelet!"
5.0,"A CLASSIC<br />IT  was bought based on reviews.<br />The color is brought and fashionable.  I too had received many compliments as I am know for using bight colored purses<br />The purse is perfect, when I first took it I thought is this not going to be enough room for all my papers, but once the tissue<br />was removed and I loaded the purse, everything fit with room to spare even my iPad min fit.<br />i like the separation in the middle and pockets.<br />Although it has not feet on the bottom it stays up and does to fall<br />I recommend this purse, you won't be disappointed"
5.0,Smaller than the light pink one I bought... odd. But still good.
5.0,"I wear these types of socks all the time, and these are perfect!  They fit right, the silicone on the heel works to keep them on my feet (most of the time).  I like the variety of colors and plan to purchase more in the future."
5.0,I was pleasantly surprised with how thick this shirt is I was expecting it to be paper thin. I ordered an x large ( I always go a size up when ordering from china.) I definitely could have had  plenty of room in a large. The only thing that does not look as pictured the metal grommets are gold not silver as pictured not a deal breaker but the silver would have looked better and the holes and grommets are also much larger than pictured.The length is nice and long .
5.0,"Even though these tank tops were too small for me, they are of high quality and I would recommend them."
5.0,"Worked great for my Hufflepuff costume.  No complaints, no surprises."
5.0,The Hangover Bradley Cooper Aviator Glasses - fit great and are stylish; I enjoy wearing them! I will share with my friends too!

5.0,product was perfect ordered 2 more
5.0,Good quality shirt I think. Perfect for my needs
5.0,"For an elderly gent with arthritic joints, these pants are very easy to put on.  They launder well, and if pulled out of the dryer quickly need no ironing.  They look very nice, and are a comfortable pair of pants for the hot weather."
5.0,This is so nice it look rich
5.0,"Each bracelet came individually wrapped in plastic. It was fun waiting on the shipment and being surprised not knowing what colors/designs that you would be getting. There were a variety of colors/designs. I would have loved to receive some neutral colors like champaign, silver, rose gold or regular gold but didn't get any. There was only one solid color bracelet, it was red and very pretty. There were only a couple of bracelets that I didn't like, but I loved the majority and it is such a great deal buying in sets of 12 instead of individually.<br />I bought these for CHRISTmas gifts and for my teen daughter. I will be borrowing from her and can't wait to wear them!<br />This is a great purchase and value for your money.<br /><br />I ordered another set of theses. I liked all the colors but was hoping to get some neutral colors like gold, rose gold or silver but didn't get any."
5.0,"In some place of Taiwan, the wind is strong and cold. I saw this apron in Italy in 2021 Feb. It's very common there. I decided to buy it when I back home.<br />The protection is wonderful. But I think not good in rain.<br />Worth it !"
5.0,"Love everything about this bag: color, size and style!"
5.0,Really nice sleep shirt. Very soft and washed well.
5.0,"I wanted small hoops for my cartilage piercings and these are perfect for that! They are a little tricky to close. I thought I had them closed but my hair kept getting caught in them. I realized that one of them wasn't actually closed all the way. I managed to close it and haven't had a problem with my hair since then. If I need more small hoops, I would happily buy this set again."
5.0,"Love these! I will only buy this brand. After 12 hours of being on my feet, these are the most comfortable compression socks to wear! Not too thick and not too hot!"
5.0,"This is a lovely, generously designed skirt although it is verrrry long. i'm 5'5&#34; and have to roll it up twice  :  ) i'm going to try washing and then drying it in the dryer to see if that helps.

5.0,"Love love love this sweater. I am very sensitive to wool, and this is slightly itchy to me, but not awfully so. I'll wear a shirt underneath and it will be amazing. I paired with a little belt and it's absolutely perfect. It is shorter on me than it is in the photo but it hits right under my hip. The material is very soft...can't wait until it gets a little cooler so I can wear!"
5.0,Great purse and great price

5.0,"Fine product, good quality, works very well."
5.0,"I read some reviews before purchasing so I had an idea of what to expect. This dress isn’t for a super fancy event, but it’s cute and comfortable and just what I needed. Would be good as a cocktail dress or everyday dress if you’re fancier than me. Is pretty stretchy and offers lots of support, I didn’t even need a bra and it provided nice lift. :) I needed a blue dress for a bachelorette party (I purchased the navy) and this is perfect!<br /><br />I’m 5’2” 135lb 28in waist (on a good day) 36D/34DD and a medium was a nice fit."
5.0,love it!! Runs a tad small....not as long as it looks but still such a beautiful shirt!
5.0,"Cute little wallet. Excellent quality, faux leather but very good finish. The pink on black adds that special something. I believe it will last a while"
5.0,"I love this purse.  It is compact, but still holds everything- phone, wallet, keys, ..."
5.0,"Love this shirt! Fits great and that fabric is super comfy. I’m 5’5” and about 120, ordered a small and it’s a bit loose, which is what I wanted :)"

5.0,These are perfects - I bought an additional set for myself and another for my sister.
5.0,"I love it, it's bold beautiful and hangs just right."
5.0,Really pretty i love them
5.0,I ordered this dress for my college graduation and I am VERY pleased with it! I was looking all over for a dress that looked good for a winter graduation and the dark green look was exactly what I wanted. The price cannot be beat and I got quite a few complements on it. I was a little hesitant about ordering clothes from amazon but for this price I couldn't pass it up and I am very glad I didn't!
5.0,"I bought these because I needed a comfortable shoe with a 2” wedge to match my walking boot after breaking my ankle. I’ll also need a comfortable shoe when I can wear two shoes again! These are amazing so far- lots of cushion and no cutting into my toes or ankle. Fits true to size, and accommodates my wideish foot just fine."
5.0,Love this bag!  It is perfect for my little girls ballet and tap shoes!
5.0,This is a very cute cover up dress. I wore it on a boat cruise during my Miami vacation. It fit perfectly.
5.0,Need it a little bigger
5.0,"Why doesn’t it have a back to secure the stone? I love it anyway, but find this curious."
5.0,Great bracelet!  The Olaf charms are adorable! My niece loves it!  :)
5.0,Great size.  Good construction.
5.0,"This watch is what I expected.....a Breitling Navitimer copy, and a pretty good at that! It's 8mm larger than a Breitling &amp; had an AM/PM indicator subdial at the 3 o'clock position. The $4,000 watch deals with second, minutes &amp; hour subdials. Some reviews complained of the bezel being fixed. So what? If it rotated, it would give navigational information. Other than pilots, who knows how to operate and read an EB6 flight calculator? Common...for $24 you get a great looking, well built timepiece. Otherwise, you can drop about $5,000 on a great looking, well built timepiece. So, unless one flies #2 slot with the Blue Angels, enjoy this watch."
5.0,"I typically wear a size large (10,12) but sized up to an XL because I wanted a looser fit. It is true to size, and probably still would have been roomy on me in a large but I love how the XL fits me. I am 5'5 and the dress comes up right above my knees in the front and on the side it comes up to mid thigh. It is comfortable and can be worn so many different ways! I just paired it with cute sandals and recieved so many compliments. I am really glad it has a hood and front pocket too! LOVE the army green color."
5.0,I love this shirt. It is well made and fits exactly like I thought it would. Will definitely be buying more

5.0,Queda precioso
5.0,I love this skirt!! Im getting compliments all the the time!!
5.0,"I loved how comfortable these pants are, so soft, love them"
5.0,Now my calling card on my vest. Love it
5.0,"This bracelet came in lovely pink velvet pouch, so it would be perfect as a gift. The bracelet itself is well made, the size is the same as indicated on the picture. The strings in the back regulate the size of the bracelet so it would fit any wrist, and once you pull them to the desired fit, the bracelet stays put. I am very satisfied with quality and the look of it on my wrist. It's perfect for summer. I highly recommend it."
5.0,Love these as they are lightweight and comfortable all around. They may run small for some but I think they are true to size for the most part as they will stretch just a tad after wearing them a little while.
5.0,Well made dress very vintage<br />It is a gift and I hope they like it
5.0,My son loves this backpack.  The graphics are great.  It is also padded for comfort

5.0,I thought this was cute but did not allow much stretch
5.0,Love the look and feel. Could have a little more material. Bigger guys might have a hard time with fitment until the reason you got a fitbit starts to work.
5.0,Looks much better in person. Super sturdy and beautiful! Great purchase!
5.0,Ordered a size up.. so fits a little big as I expected. What's not to love about a toddler in rainboots?! Work well and keeps her feet dry. Adorable
5.0,"Great hat, but I've gotten beat up a lot since donning it."
5.0,Velcro closure allows for snug or loose fit as needed. Very comfortable.
5.0,"The blue is more of a navy/purple and it is lovely. Very tailored and classic, but still fun to wear. I am 5'2"" 138 (athletic) and a small fit perfectly."
5.0,Love these! But be sure: The earrings are heavy and would be better supported if you wear flesh tunnels.
5.0,awesome there needs to be more colors
5.0,"I owned a Casio digital watch nearly identical to this when I was a young soldier decades ago and was delighted to find it again when browsing for an inexpensive digital sports watch, surprised it was still being sold. This Casio is basic in its functionality, but I wanted basic. I have dress watches if I'm going out or dressing up. This is what I wanted for timing my bike rides and doing chores outside and the like. Perfect for my needs."
5.0,Heavy great for streching ur ears to the next gage

5.0,This dress is so comfy and cute! I've worn it both with and without a belt around the waist and get compliments both ways. It's loose fitting but also flattering! I have it in 2 colors!
5.0,"5'3"" 140lbs when I bought it. this dress fits perfectly I ordered a medium, I gained 10 lbs and it still fits great! 😊"
5.0,"I didn't expect it to be really small, but I eventually got used to it. This watch is great for running or any other kinds of activities, it feels super light on your wrist. In fact, it's so light I can barely feel anything on my wrist. Also, no fancy features so don't expect much but this its still a reliable watch."
5.0,"The best part of these amazing socks is the image-quality on the socks. The images are well-made and the face image looks very accurate to the President's face. These colorful MAGA socks definitely make a great-gift and will be certain to turn heads and start conversations. Comfortable, soft, and with the proper thickness to wear with any type of shoe. I highly enjoy and recommend these socks all the way, an election-day essential and an entertaining way to show support."

5.0,"Excellent quality and very good hat,fits great"
5.0,"Love these pants!! I'm 5'4, 110 and wear an xsmall. They fit great. Tight but not compression tight. They are not see through at all, and they don't stretch out. I have them in navy, raisin, black and gray."
5.0,"I love these pants and they fit so well plus they are so comfortable to wear with any top.<br />I can wear them to a dressy event or to a casual event, they are very versatile. I highly recommend them. Plus, if you are going to an event where you expect to eat you have plenty of room to expand. (if you know what I mean)"
5.0,"Held up well, was a bit short and a bit small, but otherwise great product!"

5.0,"This ring is so pretty and sparkly, and the size 8 fits perfectly."

It's SO durable, fits everything I need it to fit, and is radically cheaper than the high-end &#34;fancy&#34; girl bags that companies try to sell women photographers.<br /><br />I have had this bag for 1 whole wedding season and I'm really hard on my gear and this thing just takes a beating and still looks brand new. Highly highly recommend."
5.0,"I love this top, it runs big I'm 5'3, 112lbs, but big busted and ordered a small. I really need an xs. I will probably buy another in xs because I love it so much."

5.0,So beautiful! They fit perfectly!  They block the sun pretty well too!
5.0,I bought this to replace my 15 year old yardwork cotton boonie hat.  I like the wider brim and so far the quality seems good. It does run a little snug but I have a large head anyway. I've used it for a month or so now and I like it.
5.0,I absolutely love this house coat.  It's  a nice length and very comfortable to wear.  I wear this all the time after having surgery.

5.0,Love this watch.reliable seller.recieved item as described  and prompt delivery
5.0,"I am so glad I decided to order this dress! The top portion is a nice thick stretchy material, which stays true to color even when stretched across the chest. The plaid is a very thick, stiff material--I will need to iron the pleats but I like the amount of structure it has. This will be a great dress for fall and winter, and I can wear it to teach or maybe even to a wedding.<br />As for sizing: I am 6 ft with a long torso and large bust, and typically wear a U.S. 18. I ordered this in a 2X. While the top of this dress feels too tight when you're putting it on, it fits perfectly once adjusted and zipped! The top of the plaid does sit juuust above my natural waist, but not enough to be an issue. The skirt hem brushes my knees.<br /><br />If you're looking for a flattering, modest, cool-weather dress...this is it!"
5.0,"I had to return a more expensive  but cheapy looking underseater. This one is nice and very well made. Rolls smoothly. Can be used for work and travel LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!"
5.0,"I really like this belt. It's a thick leather and may even last a while. I wear my jeans in a size 40 and 42. I have to use the first 3 holes in the belt when wearing it. Otherwise, very good belt."

5.0,"Like everyone else, I bought these to wear in the shower, but they are so comfortable, I wear them all the time.  A shoe genius must have designed these."

5.0,Love these  earrings
5.0,Very comfortable.  Very adjustable.

5.0,Get it for my granddaughter she love it
5.0,"got this for a ""goth"" photoshoot. i loved it so much i ordered another in a different color. i loved the varying lengths you can adjust it to."
5.0,"I'm a small person, height and weight, my size is usually small. If this is you, I recommend buying the extra small, I had to do a return because around the straps my bra would show. The extra small was a lot better fit for me."
5.0,"length is long,  experienced seamstress can fix. purchased as my wedding dress two weeks before my wedding, got it expressed shipped. notified the vendor,  got it on time. nothing but net! perfect day, fit right in at  my rustic fall wedding,  looked amazing.  10 out of 10 experience"

5.0,look just like the picture. cute relaxing skirt
5.0,"The best sunglasses for the price I've ever purchased...smart design, sleek style, nice packaging. Most of all, it has greatly reduced the glare (and fatigue) to my eyes. Would like to find out the UV index when I get the meter to do it. Would definitely recommend!"
5.0,V er y nice fit. The color was excellent for me.
5.0,Wow!  This gift was the over-the-top I was looking for!  My son loves them.
5.0,"The socks fit as expected. The socks are not that thick, they fit like a reg. cotton shoe sock and don't keep your feet warm on cold days. I like wearing them outdoors to go shopping and to the beach in AM."
5.0,"I wear this under a knee brace post ACL surgery. Works really well to protect my skin, and also to keep stink off my brace!"
5.0,"These are great for the price- fit my kids well. Perfect size for my 10yo. For my 4yo, the mask size is perfect for his face however the elastic loops are way too big. I tie a little knotted loop at the ends and it’s great"
5.0,My daughter wore a set of these with her winter formal gown that had a plunging neckline and open back.  She was discretely covered and felt very comfortable.
5.0,Beautiful!  I ordered more!
5.0,Sleep and lounging around
5.0,Very cute ! Love the look and the cute little case . Could pass for Celine
5.0,"This fabric is very smooth and soft, yet has a slight structure to it. It’s perfect for around the office or dressing up a blouse. I find that the waistband is structured enough to give me a little tummy control without being uncomfortable. The fabric doesn’t bunch or bead up either. Very curvy girl friendly!"
5.0,I get TONS of compliments on this skirt! I love it so much I'm ordering a second one.<br /><br />Pros: Forgiving material sits nicely without clinging. Color works well in all seasons. Easy to dress up or down - I love adding a belt. Awesome price for an awesome skirt!<br /><br />Cons: The metallic material snags easily and creates very noticeable &#34;runs&#34; in the material. This is NOT breathable material so not ideal in high temperatures. Takes a long time to ship.<br /><br />READ THE SIZING CHART!!

5.0,So comfy and super cute.  But runs large.  Has a drawstring tho so not that big of a deal.  I’m 5’7”  130 lbs and I got a medium.  A small would have been plenty big
5.0,"My husband needed a ring that was durable and comfortable while working/traveling without having a fear of losing/damaging his real ring. I purchased this for him, and he loves it! No brainer, buy it."
5.0,I used this band to replace a cheaper one that was worn. The quality and appearance are excellent. I feel sure this band will last a long time. It also soft and comfortable

5.0,Wore it to a party lots of compliments very nicely made thank you
5.0,"I love this dress. The fabric is soft and thick enough to not cling, but not so thick that it feels heavy. The pockets are an added bonus. My recommendation if you on the fence between two sizes is to size down. The extra fabric that makes it a swing dress is very forgiving. I also suggest ordering the Cinch It! product from Amazon to give you a bit of a waist without turning it into a body con dress.<br /><br />My neighbor complimented me on the dress almost immediately after leaving my house! I'm going to order other colors."
5.0,Just what I was looking for. My little convertible looks stunning!!!!

5.0,This is the perfect Auntie new baby gift! It’s just Adorable! The black t shirt onesie is good quality & the fushia tutu is very soft; not scratchy.It came with a matching head bow & headband. I love the font on t shirt. Looks like it would fit in one year; fingers are crossed.
5.0,"My teen daughter wears these. She loves them. They fit well, don't slide down and she loves that when wearing them the picture doesn't stretch out and get distorted. This is likely because she has somewhat slim calves and ankles. Regardless, these are a hit in our house."

5.0,Beautiful for such a good price.
5.0,"I received one pack of ""CGBE Christmas Nail Charms"".<br /><br />In the pack was 2 round organizers with sections holding the ""Nail Charms"" & also included was a pair of tweezers.<br /><br />I thought these ""Nail Charms"" would look cute on my fingernails around Christmas time unfortunately my fingernails are a little weird and flip up sharply (kind of like a scoop). So, I couldn't get the ""Nail Charms"" (which are pretty much flat on the back) to adhere to my fingernails.<br /><br />I eventually decided to use these ""Nail Charms"" for a craft project & that worked out perfectly.<br /><br />What really struck me about these ""Nail Charms"" was how detailed they were too be so small. They are so cute! Very colorful & let's not forget sparkly."

5.0,"I’m 68 years young ..a fun loving woman, interested in staying healthy into my golden years! I’m also the proud owner of six of the Casio G Shock Watches. Each one is cherished for a different reason. Based on the  reasonable prices, I thought they might be “throw-away” watches.<br /> Au-contraire!  These are great little gems that just go and go and go! And the features…. My goodness!  Stop watch, date, super accurate time,  other time zones, alarm features. Should I continue??  Ladies, this is not a giant oversized face, but one you can comfortably read. It can also be dressed up or down as the occasion calls for. I particularly love the rich brown color that is neutral enough to go with just about anything in your wardrobe. So what are you waiting for? Grab one while you can!"

My daughter is growing fast and she still has room to grow into them. She is almost 7 YO, wears a Medium 7/8 and we purchased M, which was a little on the large side for her.

The light on it is also great and it lights up the display nicely.<br /><br />I dont really use the alarm feature but it's handy that it has that feature.

5.0,Love this handbag.  Looks more high end.  Nice Lining.
5.0,"Luv this dress! I dance and wen I saw this dress I had to have 😍 haha!! Perfect for twirling. Though I read the reviews about it running big, I ordered the size I normally wear (US Med) because I wanted room. Well, it was tooooo much room. So I altered by sewing a piece of ribbon under the bust to tie in the back to fit better. Now I want another (just different color / material 😁)"

5.0,"The mornings are getting cold at our place in the Adirondacks and my summer robe no longer did the job. I ordered this robe from Amazon since the local stores didn't have any in stock yet, It came fast and surpasses my expectations as far as comphyness and warmth, I'm 5'8&#34; and about 185lbs. I ordered a large since I wanted lots of room. It fits perfect."
5.0,Literally my new favorite bottoms
5.0,"I love them. I would say only issue with them is the fact when I look at a screen of some kind it looks weird with the green lenses. Other than that, they look great and professional. Love them."
5.0,Bad girl meets the classy woman. Love it.
5.0,Of all of my mighty wallets with different designs this one is my very favorite.Because I dropped it out of my pocket in a restroom once and a lady going into the stall said mamm u dropped ur papers.So. it was a great deterrence.I had money in it.
5.0,"These are good feet warmers.  Some  nights I just can't get my feet warm.  Put these in the microwave and on my feet and they do the trick.  A little moist when you first start using them, but that goes away in time.  I didn't expect them to be delivered as quickly as they were as they were coming from England to the US.  But they came very quickly and during the holidays, too.  Great product if you have cold feet!"

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:f996a33953090fd159d066659c5d7021]] [[VIDEOID:b0b70f66af8039bc8fcadc80ed54f54b]] This dress was pretty much what I expected from the pictures. The fabric is heavy and has quite a bit of stretch to it. The nice part is that the colors are as vibrant as they show in the photos.<br /><br />For sizing reference, I purchased a 3XL. My measurements are 45&quot; bust and 39&quot; waist and I am 5' 3&quot; tall. The dress fit snugly, but not too snug. I am probably at about the top of the measurements and have it still be comfortable. It starts out feeling a tad tight when you are putting on the sleeves, but was fine once I got it on and zipped up ... again due to it's stretchiness. If you are heavier or have larger arms than me, I would probably go one size bigger.<br /><br />The skirt is nice and full and perfect for adding a petticoat to. I have added a [[ASIN:B01FTPQONC Tidetell Vintage Women's 50s Rockabilly Tutu Skirt 26&quot; Length Petticoat Black L(FBA)]]. The length is perfect as it peeks out about 1&quot; from the bottom of the skirt."
5.0,These are so comfortable I love them. Downfall sanitary napkins do not like to stick
5.0,I absolutely love this bathing suit and its colors! I bought the red/bright orange. It fits comfortably and is also body flattering!
5.0,"Great service, great pants."
5.0,She'll loves it.  Gonna need a thicker chain.
5.0,Seemed to be made well strapped it to the handlebars of my mountain bike road some pretty rough trails so far its taken the beating
5.0,Very nice looking LED shoes. The battery lasts very long. They comes with dual charging cable which can change both shoes simultaneously.
5.0,Looks good and is sturdy
5.0,Worth the price. Nice for a nursing shirt. I got an extra large for it to be extra lose. But if you wear a large. Definitely get a large it would be lose enough.
5.0,Exactly what was expected..medium in size.
5.0,"It’s for my son he’s a pipe welder, he loved it! Put it right on his belt!"

5.0,Great quality but a little snug. It serves the purpose.
5.0,I loved the colors
5.0,"So beautiful! I love this color (the red). The smocked waist fits very well. I am 5'7&#34;, around 110lbs, and usually wear a size 2-4. The skirt comes to just above my ankles."
5.0,I love the hat perfectly for summer and to cover up
5.0,I was a bit iffy with ordering clothes online never had much luck but this went well. It’s thin so comfy in warm months but not so thin that it’s see through. I got the grey.
5.0,"I got this product because I liked the design and it does look good! The fabric felt a little rough but I’m sure with a quick wash it’ll be soft. It feels a little oversized but I like that style and when you’re wearing pajamas, it sounds and feels nice to move around freely."
5.0,"Great item, just wish the sole was a bit thicker."
5.0,"I love these boots, they are stylish, durable, dressy, yet casual, go great with jeans, or skirts, excellent no slip soles.  I like to wear them with leggings tucked in and a nice long length pull over sweater.  I get many complements on how nice they look, especially tucked into jeans.  They are very comfortable, and no slip grip sole is well made."
5.0,used for the fourth of July - was just perfect!
5.0,Fits great on my Kate Spade case. Now don't have to bring my purse.
5.0,My cats love this...they play in this ALWAYS!!!
5.0,"Top tier cheap sunglasses. Getting everything you’d want in good sunglasses but a brand name. Feel very durable, sleek, and high quality lenses"
5.0,"I bought this to attach to my keys (shocking right?) to hopefully avoid pregnancy brain mishaps. Thankfully I haven’t needed it yet, but as a mom with a baby and a toddler, I still appreciate the peace of mind. It looks just like the day I attached it and I still like it."
5.0,I like the full width heel.  Other brands with a narrow heel section tends to stretch the leather.
5.0,My daughter really likes these pants. Nice soft fabric. Just the right thickness. Pockets are a plus.
5.0,This are cotton....yay!  I have sensitive skin and I liked these so much I have two pair in green and one in orange.  The waist band is wide and flat and stays put.

5.0,quality summer caps are scarce but this is my favorite hands down.
5.0,Love this watch!! Have had soooo many compliments while wearing it out!
5.0,"Ya'll ladies listen here. I struggled my whole life to find a good high impact sports bra that kept the girls in place. I'm a 36F-G depending on the brand.<br /><br />I've been seeing adds for this bra all over Instagram, Facebook, and snapchat but it was from knockoff fake companies so I decided to do some research to find out who the company actually was.<br /><br />Found SHEFIT and was a little skeptical of the prices but decided to try anyways because I'm in dire need of a new sports bra......<br /><br />It arrived today and LET ME TELL YOU WHAT!!!!!! Best thing since sliced bread hands down! The sizing is perfect, the color is nice, the quality is excellent and even more the packaging is awesome, comes in a laundry bag for when it needs washed.<br /><br />I am THRILLED to have found these bras and will be buying one in every color and style and I recommend you do the same!"
5.0,"This shoe is great. Everyone is in love with them on my feet. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to purchase comfortable and affordable shoes for work, gym, yoga just about any occasion. They are the perfect match."
5.0,"My wife really loves this necklace. The design is attractive, and not too big, and the way the light refracts off of the zircon is astounding. It looks like a much more expensive piece than it is which is exactly what you want from costume jewelry.<br /><br />This will make a great gift for anyone you love, including yourself. ;-)"
5.0,Thank YOU so much for OFFERING this beautiful prayer shawl. My husband and I LOVE it!!! We would love to come to Jerusalem one day! Shalom
5.0,So soft fits and comfortable 😌
5.0,Love this shirt. Fits great. Will buy more colors.
5.0,"Wear this almost every day.  Have one in silver, also.  I have tested it and it only records the steps when I am actually walking.  It does NOT record a step if I bend over and the necklace swings back and forth.  People do not know it is holding my Flex 2.  Has not discolored and I have been using for about 3 weeks now.  It is even comfortable to sleep in to record the sleep pattern."
5.0,It is in great shape. I love the wallet. I just wish it came with $ inside.
5.0,Great for dress and casual
5.0,Easy wear and comfortable
5.0,Perfect fit for me! Want other colors and solids.
5.0,"Excellent value, very soft, and very useful...warm."
5.0,"I got these for my nephew's shoes and they worked great.  They are very shiny and they flashed in the sunlight.  I put them onto a pair of toddler shoes (size 9m) and they were basically the size of the shoe, but that almost made them better.  Great shwings.  Great color.  And as my 3 year old nephew says, they helped him run really really really really fast!"
5.0,"Shirt fits as expected and looks awesome, hence the reason I purchased it. I don't think there is much more than that I can say about a shirt."
5.0,This tank feels like a big hug. So soft and so comforting. I ordered three more and planning on ordering the onsie too. My new favorite tanks and I feel so good knowing the fabric is healthy on my skin! Love and so reccommed this thank top!
5.0,This was a great gift....looks great...excellent quality hat...he loved it
5.0,just arrived...have not used it yet but packaged nicely in box and high quality leather/buckle.
5.0,Delightfully kooky
5.0,Nice leather and material.  Keep hands warm while driving.  Fit is a little snug but not uncomfortable.
5.0,I gave these leggings to my daughter.  She likes the Plus size because they are loose and not binding.  They go down to her ankles because she's kind of short.  So these capris were perfect for her.  I ordered a pair of regular long length leggings for myself.  VERY SOFT and comfortable!
5.0,"I got these for my husband, who is a sound engineer and carries tons of stuff in his many pockets and is extremely hard on his clothes.  He wears things to death in no time.  Also, he is hard to fit. I have bought a hundred different cargo style pants and these are the only ones that fit him perfectly right.  I have bought three pairs and they are all wonderful.  I had gotten him Match brand cargo pants which only lasted 6 months before the material fell to pieces.  I tried a couple of brands from other asian companies and even ordering six sizes up found that they were too small.<br />I have done everything, but am sticking with company from now on.  They got it right the first time and every time!"
5.0,Love it! It’s cute sparkle not trying to be fancy sparkle. Arrived faster than quote which is always awesome. No complaints.
5.0,"its a good par, more reliable than the last adidas i get, so i totally recommend it"
5.0,I love this! It’s sturdier than I expected and fits mine and my 3 yr olds head just fine. One of the jewels did pop out pretty easily but it was simple enough to glue it back on.
5.0,"These are beautiful ammonite fossil earrings that go well with some other jewelry that I was given.  They are a bit heavier than the earrings I typically wear, but I didn't find them painful."
5.0,"The GV Denim Shorts came on time, as expected and the fit is comfortable. The pockets are like on their jeans, deep enough to hold a wallet, keys and change. They look nice for casual dress, but feel heavy enough to work outside in."
5.0,Really works the mid section...
5.0,I'm a 36&#34; waist and the 32-34 (medium) fit very well.  Have washed and dried them twice and so far they have not shrunk.
5.0,They are a gift so not completely sure yet but they look good. For my son in law who is a Pastor😊
5.0,Great Product at a great price with fast delivery
5.0,"Absolutely perfect! These bibs are unbelievable soft, super cute patterns, and a great quality! They are great for my teething boy that has become a drool monster lately. These do a great job at absorbing the drool and keeping his outfits dry, which keeps him happy! We love that the fronts are super soft 100% cotton with nickle-free adjustable snaps (2 snaps on each corner) to fit any size. They've gone through several washes and have held up great, strong stitches and no fraying. I am beyond pleased with this purchase, and plan to buy another set as a gift for a dear friend. I received a discount on these in return for my honest review of the product."
5.0,"They fit excellently. Look amazing, and I’m beyond comfortable in them. Deep pockets are definitely a plus as well. Can’t give you a bad reason to buy them. Buying more shortly."

5.0,Softens and water proofs leather.
5.0,Love this dress! Fits like a glove and is ohhh soo soft & comfortable!
5.0,"My 7 and 9 year old daughters got these Time Turner necklaces for Christmas.  They are both obsessed with Harry Potter, and they were so excited to open them.  The necklaces came well packaged.  They arrived in a red velvet pouch inside of a pretty black box.  The necklaces feel substantial and not cheaply made.  The clasp is very easy to fasten and unfasten (my daughters can do it themselves!) and we haven't had any trouble with it falling off.  This has become a favorite piece of jewelry for both of my girls.  They wear their necklaces out regularly and always receive tons of compliments.<br /><br /> The only thing I am not totally happy about with the necklace is that the sand passes through the hour glass almost instantaneously.  It would be nice if it worked more like an hour glass where the sand slowly trickles through."
5.0,"Bought them to make a tribute to General Pershing, the only living General of the Armies The U.S. ever had during WWI.  General Washington was postuemosly promoted, since no one can outrank him, and Douglas McArthur was going to get the job during the Korean war (6 star general equivalent).<br />  Pershing was allowed to make his own rank insignia by congress.  Other allied countries had generals with as many as 10 stars of various colors.  When he proposed 4 gold stars to congress, as opposed 4 or 5 silver stars, other allied countries generals laughed at this.  So he settled on 1 big gold star, as an insult to them.  They had to follow the orders of a man who wore 1 star, insulting them, he made it big, so all could see (especially thier own troops), these men (Generals) obeying him.  He kept his star gold to signify the difference between him and other U.S. General, all who were at the very least went to a Military College.  Pershing eventually went to the War College, but not until after his promotion.<br />  The General of the Armies is the Commander of All the U.S. and U.S. Allied forces, out ranking the President, nominated to the Allies by congress, and Appointed by all the allies.  As you can imagine you want someone who will not be a Tyrant or Dictator for this position, so they picked a man who was enlisted and became an Officer on the battlefield, never had any political aspirations for this, John Pershing.<br />  The position lime 5 star General is for life, so it is awarded by the President with Congresses approval rarely, and historically only in Wartime.  This is one of the major changes in government that has allowed to let politicians run Rampant, there used to be these Generals to keep them and each other in check.  The U.N., The W.H.O., and Interpol try, but like Pershing get not much respect.  If we had Generals like these in the six permanent Countries that are on the U.N. Security Council the U.N. would have less hassles.  Think, the U.N. got no respect from Saddam Hussien, thus the war on terror.  The W.H.O. got no respect from the U.S., thus the Carona-COVID Pandemic.  The CDC got no respect from the President and ""National Health"" Advisor, and you have mutating COVID Viruses, etc.<br />  As a former Army Paratrooper, part of our mission was to ensure the medics could do thier job while we provided Security for this.  Conclusion, we say martial law, next time appoint leaders with global jurisdiction devided by the established U.N. and the countries that compose it for this reason, (and not just NATO)."

5.0,It is beautiful and exactly what I was looking for.  I Couldn't ask for more.  The details are well done.
5.0,"Generally, this item is what you'd expect. Mine's a bright yellow, its material is smoother than some I've worn. There's a partially removable clip for an ID but it's so small it's a little hard to manipulate- probably just as easy to remove the lanyard itself as releasing the clip. If you had a second lanyard with the matching male end of the clip on it I guess it would make the feature useful for switching the ID back and forth."

5.0,"The product is hiding, I'm using it in my medusa/cupids bow/upper lip. I like curved barbells better here over flatbacks because it doesn't get caught on my teeth. I added a blue opal and CZ dermal topper in the same size and it screwed in nicely!"
5.0,Great fit and color combination
5.0,I’ve only had this bag for a week but it seems well made. It’s a perfect size and meets my needs as a daily purse
5.0,"LOVE THESE BOOTS!!! I bought these boots for 2 reasons, the first is we had a concert to go to at a country music event and my old pair just didn’t cut it for a dress look anymore, the second reason is I needed a new pair of dress boots. I put these on the day of the event, I wore them for well over 12 hours and not once did my feet hurt or get sore. They were comfortable right from the start and the design is adorable. The only problem I had was the bottom was so slick I had to take some sand paper to the bottom before we left so I wouldn’t slip. Someone spilt a drink on me and I was able to wipe it right off the boots without even a satin to the leather."
5.0,These are the best panties I have ever owned! I usually wear a Large in panties and the Large fit perfectly. They are so stretchy and comfortable. They cover my whole bottom and stay put. I can wear with dresses without worrying about a panty line.
5.0,"These are a great pair of casual joggers. They fit as expected and are nice and soft and stretchy. The fabric is thin but not see-through or overly clingy. The cut looks cuter than most yoga pants that I have, I love the little buttons."
5.0,These are so sexy I used to look so good in them oh my they were so sexy and comfortable but they got destroyed while pole dancing in them.
5.0,I love these! They're small and adorable! I've been wearing huge ugly nose rings because I have to hide them at work but I was getting sick of wearing them outside of work too! I wasn't sure I wanted to get them because before I bought smaller ones as well that said it was a certain type of metal but ended up being paint over metal and the paint chipped away and caused my nose to become sore. These are perfect! They look attractive and are the perfect size for me! And there is no paint whatsoever! I can't hide them at work because they're too small to fit in my nose but I already figured that so I got them to wear outside of work and switch them out for work. If you have a job you have to hide them for I would suggest getting these as well as something wider like a retainer and just switch them out like I've been doing!
5.0,"Omg I love it!!!!! It’s perfect, 5’8” over 200lbs and fit me perfect, no complaints at all"
5.0,Me encantó.<br />Fue un obsequio de navidad y le encanto

5.0,"I wear size Small on button-down shirts (and on rare occasions, XS). This time I ordered - Asian XS/US MEDIUM - and it fit perfectly. An Asian Small/ US Large would have been a bit big. For reference, my measurements are Bust: 34B/ Waist: 25.5&#34;."
5.0,So cute and warm for my baby girl!!

5.0,"I love simple jewelry and this fits the bill. At the 1ct size it's not overbearing, just lovely, delicate, and elegant. I've worn it several times and the setting has not dulled or tarnished. The stone has a nice clarity and reflects light well. This particular pendant doesn't come with a chain, but I had extra and it was definitely a great buy. I also purchased one in silver."
5.0,I had to return this under misplaced order. but the quality is very good
5.0,"Simply put, absolutely beautiful! Perfect for my beach wedding!"

5.0,They are my favorite earrings and didn’t give me an allergic reaction and my ears don’t hurt or bleed or get red and hot when I wear them
5.0,This is richly colored and beautiful.

5.0,"This top is just beautiful! I think the colors are perfect for it transition into Fall from summertime because it has those warm, earthy peach/orange/green tones in it! Fit is perfect! I was a little worried about getting it on but because it has the shirred back it has some elastic so it stretches to go over your head but it fits back nicely around your waist for a fitted top! Love!!!"
5.0,My first combat boots or actually my first boots ever and I've already bought 2 more pairs in different colors. I love them. So comfortable and fit my size 6 perfectly.
5.0,"Love them, they are extremely cute on our boy"
5.0,"I hate wearing a mask! Can I just say so? They always suck into my mouth and nose, no matter what the advertisement claims to the contrary. I have tried a couple of different cages, but THIS one finally is the one I will use every day. It is lightweight, easy to use, and actually works! It is black so my makeup never shows. I can breathe even while walking and talking. Imagine! I bought the package of 5 so I can keep one in every location I keep a mask. I hope never to suck a mask again!!!"
5.0,"This backless strapless bra is a great addition to my wardrobe. I purchased this to wear with a strapless maxi dress on my upcoming vacation. When it arrived, I impressed to see the protective case with insert to keep separate the adhesive cups. More importantly, the fit of the bra is great and it provides excellent support."
5.0,They fit perfect and are so comfortable. Will probably order another pair. I will see if they come in other colors
5.0,My daughter loves this hat. She wears it to school and all her friends love seeing her in this hat. One of her favorite hats.
5.0,Really like the bag. Sturdy construction with good zippers. Light weight and just the right size. Love the pockets on each end. Much better than the floppy (10+ years old...) Addidas bag it replaced. Listed as Prime but didn't get it until about a week after I ordered; at the time I ordered it was listes as in stock.
5.0,i have been a fan of rat fink ever since 1963 when i was in high school. big daddy roth is king
5.0,Inexpensive. Reasonably priced.<br />Very pretty.<br />The center stone is a rich color (green) surrounded by tiny CZ stones.<br />It is easy to secure to your ear.<br />You can wear these with your hair up or down.<br />Wear them when you are dressed up or down (casually).<br />The metal does not irritate my skin or cause redness.<br />Definitely a must have.<br />5 stars
5.0,I love this stub cap. It’s super cute and comfortable to wear all day.
5.0,"For my teenage niece on mother's day. Really pretty and special looking, didn't realize one butterfly is larger than the other making it a perfect aunt and niece or similar meaning gift.  Good size and right theme for a 13 year old. Bought it to match the London blue sapphire bolo bracelet from Gem Stone King that I got her for Xmas, perfect match. Now if only they had London blue marquise earring studs to match!"
5.0,"These look like 200.00 sun glasses. I get compliments all the time and they were only 10 bucks.  They feel good, look good and fit good.  I will be ordering more for backup."
5.0,Gave it to my ex gf for Christmas... we broke up shortly after.
5.0,I wore this shirt for golf the day it arrived and look forward to many more wearings. Nice feel and sun blocking without being too obvious about it.
5.0,"For looks I like the subtle contrast between the grey and blue.  For the most part I like using cotton but if heavy not the best for excursing.  But this shirt tough feels good for exercise with a good blend of cotton and polyester to be breathable, soft and still retain the body of cotton all giving it superb comfort and feels great on my bicycle rides.  Looking to get another one or two.  I also have one of their all polyester shirts which I use when biking and it to is wearing well.<br />Definitely my go to brand."
5.0,The slippers are a very good  replica of the  French  Bulldogs.  They arrived in time.  They  are a gift from my grandsons to their  mom  for  Mother's Day.
5.0,I am really hard on my sunglasses resulting it cracked and scratched lenses. I was thrilled to find these lenses to replace my broken and scratched ones! These went in with relative ease and fity frames perfectly. No need to spend another $300 on sunglasses when I can replace the lenses!
5.0,Super comfy.. could use more of a pouch up front. Wink wink nudge nudge
5.0,It fit perfect. My granddaughter wear it at my wedding and everyone loved it.
5.0,"Great dress for the price. Wore it to an event and got many compliments. It looks just like a free people dress without the expensive cost. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for something stylish yet different. I usually wear a size small, but got a size medium so the keyhole would be deeper. The medium is a little big, but I preferred it over the small."
5.0,About as comfortable as you are going to get with sandals! Will buy another pair for sure!
5.0,"Love the quality , real stone none of that imitation stuff"
5.0,I bought this for my son for Halloween and figured he'd wear it some later.  Great looking hoodie.  Fits as expected.
5.0,"I really like the shoulder pads.  I have been looking for some like this for awhile.  Seem to fit well, though a more petite style."
5.0,Liked everything except for the fact that only one dragon is left. High quality cap.
5.0,Warm and pretty
5.0,"I love these pants!! They are awesome! Not see through, very flattering, comfortable, and beautiful colors! I bought the bright blue color and black ones. They are absolutely worth the money. If you are on the fence about these, just buy them, you won't regret it.<br />I ordered a size large and still had room. For me they were perfect because the material fits the body so well."
5.0,Got as a gift and receiptant was very impressed. Shipping takes a little while but worth it.So if you plan on givibg as a gift just know takes a while to get but worth it. Very reasonable price.
5.0,I love having all my important cards in one place! I would recommend this product.
5.0,"This is the one. Not all are up to snuff, in my opinion. I bought two just in case..."
5.0,I love the pattern and the color. Probably look better and the pattern would stand out more if my ear gauge was bigger. Im a (1/2inch) gauge.
5.0,"What surprised me when these arrived was how these necklaces have a good weight to them. The necklace lot offers a good variety, for multiple outfit changes. The Evil Eye 🧿 is my favorite, as it’s bright and colorful. Great set for a gemstone/crystal enthusiast."
5.0,"I was very pleased to open the package, almost kept it for myself. Bought as a gift, she was very happy."
5.0,"Though I did not buy these boots from Amazon - I own and absolutely love them.  I have very skinny calves and the boots still look good on me due to the stretchy suede-like material and elastic top.  They are pretty comfortable as well.  These are certain to be my favorite knee high boots (move over Steve Madden). Anne Klein has some very nice boots and normally I would be very hard-pressed to shell out the money for her boots so I find that Amazon's deal is an excellent one (I found mine at a very good price as well).  From reading the reviews, it appears as though this boot style is made for a variety of calve widths.  I would definitely recommend these boots."
5.0,My niece still likes them but were a little shorter than described
5.0,I love this skirt. Not only is it pretty but it washes well; machine wash and dry and it looks like new.
5.0,A birthday gift. She loved it! So stylish and affordable!
5.0,Beautiful ring. Fits great. And very fast shipping from China
5.0,Purchased this magnetic band watch as a gift for a 94 year old that has trouble putting on a wrist watch. She was so happy!  Very easy to take on and off with the magnetic band. The watch is good quality for the price and works as described. You can't go wrong with this watch for the price being offered. The watch is attractive also on your wrist. Would definitely purchase this again and again.
5.0,I love the material on here it keeps me warm but also is not too hot if it's just right for my body I'm 5 to 115 lb and I got a medium and it fits just right I wear it to bed sometimes I definitely recommend this one
5.0,I love this body suit really great thumbs up
5.0,"Like walking on clouds. I weary these as slippers and for hours on end. I love my fuzzy slippers but they get hot and ware out quickly. These clouds are perfect for all things - right out of the shower, cleaning, playing with the kids… you name it.<br />Makes a great gift, not easy on the eyes but totally ideal for around the house."
5.0,The wife states that it works as it should. Very basic but functional.
5.0,Love the product! Looks exactly as advertised. Shipping was extremely fast. I highly recommend this seller.

5.0,Quality fabric and very well made. Super soft and comfy. The flannel is neither too light nor too heavy. I washed in hot water and dried in hot dryer and there was no shrinkage.  I liked it so much I bought another one.
5.0,"Since it isn’t 100% cotton, it doesn’t shrink. Plus it is a beautiful color."
5.0,Beautiful.  And great to wear.!
5.0,"Love these! Got them for walking around the condo after being in snowboard boots all day and tracking snow in. Socks get wet, but these have a light sole, which keeps your piddies warm and dry :)  They fit as expected (I'm a size 8) and come up to about 3&#34; above my ankle. They wash well, too."
5.0,Perfect.  Exactly what I was looking for in a protective case and stylish too!
5.0,Esta bello.
5.0,This was an adorable outfit and loved the entire thing. It ran on the a little bit big side but not too big that he couldn't wear it. Unfortunately we won't be able to wear it and see how long it lasts and our baby got his angel wings last week.
5.0,Great for my husband birthday party decorations
5.0,"Love this cover up! This is the kind of cover up so nicely made and trendy you could wear it out as a summer duster. Whether at the pool, party or just out and about this is a sweet addition to the wardrobe! This is more fitted at the chest than most so if you are busty, go a size up."
5.0,Bought this to use for photography pictures!  Beautiful dress!
5.0,"Strong, well made drawstring bag. Arrived on time and it was a hit with our astronaut fan at home."
5.0,Needed decent but inexpensive stud and cufflink set for son' as junior prom. Better than renting as s he can use them for upcoming formal events as well.
5.0,Fit great and comfortable fabric. a little see thru so it was hard to find underwear that you couldnt see the lines.
5.0,"So I was a little rough while taking these out of the package and ended up bending one of the posts, BUT I was able to bend it back into shape without breaking the earring. Looked very cute. I bought them for a special event but I can’t wait to wear them to work to spice up my look."
5.0,GTEAT
5.0,"They are beautiful! Just perfect for my purpose, jewelry art."
5.0,"Fit is as expected my little one has a kinda wide foot and there was no issue, happy"
5.0,This is the most comfortable hoodie I’ve ever owned. Feels super high quality and looks just like the picture. Fantastic quality for the price. You need this!!!
5.0,"I read the reviews before I purchased and was skeptical, but I ordered 1 size larger than usual and it fits great! The sleeves are short and hit me more at the wrist, but I just push up the sleeves for a scrunched look. I've received many compliments wearing this with leggings and boots. Super comfortable and flattering!"
5.0,Lovely and the perfect size
5.0,Fits perfect. Soft material.
5.0,"Great product.  Just as expected.  I had to shorten, but knew that going in.  Quite pleased."
5.0,Loed it
5.0,"Lovely jacket, please do note what the other reviews say about sizes. I am 5'3"" and around 135 lbs and I purchased a medium so I would have room to wear a hoodie underneath. The jacket isn't bulky or too puffy either way and does great at keeping the wind out! Mine came with pockets lined with cloth and the inside button was a cute plaid one. I highly recommend."
5.0,Who could ask for a better pic for a dad who plays the guitar?  Great father's day idea.
5.0,Cool little gadgets.

5.0,Very light and so comfortable. Will be buying again in the future.
5.0,"I wanted to love this sweater. Unfortunately, that was not the case. It had a funny fit to it and the craftsmanship was not up to par. The material is extremely soft and thick, that is the only good I found. I read the reviews beforehand, then took the gamble and lost. May the odd’s ever be in your favor should you decide to risk it too.<br /><br />My 5 star rating is for the customer service I received upon reaching out to the seller. I received prompt responses that were genuinely concerned with my dissatisfaction. The seller was courteous and gave multiple options to choose the best resolution. I have no qualms about purchasing other items from this seller in the future."
5.0,Awesome cover up!
5.0,"Very nice quality, holds up great I have worn it every day since receiving it without any issues."

5.0,"These go well over the knee, which kinda makes 'em awesome."
5.0,"love them. They fit as expected, easy to put on and look very stylish.  I've been wearing them for months and they still look great. The gold hasn't faded and I haven't noticed any wear anywhere. I was a little skeptical at first because this wasn't leather  but I'm impressed by the quality. At under 15 $ this was a great purchase. I also want to mention that I paid for this product with my own money and didn't receive any incentive and wasn't asked by anyone to write this review. I felt like noting this because some Amazon reviews aren't genuine."
5.0,This is an amazing buy.  Excellently made and the material is fantastic.  They did not have a medium so I tried a large and unfortunately it was too big.  So sad to have to return it.  the navy is gorgeous!  Hopefully they will have more sizes in the future.
5.0,"I purchased this for my grandson, it is easy to get on and off and looks adorable.  It is to long for him but I bought a larger size to make sure it fits him all winter."

5.0,"These glasses are perfect!!  The price was right, the style is attractive, and my eyes are comfortable wearing them.  An all-around win.  These are 10 times better than the overly pricey ones I bought a year ago that I can't wear because of eye strain.  Very satisfied."
5.0,5.5 145 to 150lb Medium fits perfectly. Bodysuit is well made. Gives the appearance of a waist. I love this!
5.0,"I love the color of this crossbody, it’s a little small for me, but it is great quality!! I can’t wait to purchase a larger bag!"
5.0,It's a pack.
5.0,"Nice size, double layer, looks great"
5.0,"So cute! And inexpensive. The fabric and cut were much nicer than I expected. I bought a medium. It's pretty fitted so if you are large busted or have a womanly figure, I would recommend buying a larger size."
5.0,I haven't had a chance to wear this yet but I'm so impressed! It is just fantastic! Love this seller! Packaged wonderfully! So very pleased! Looks great & very well made! Thrillled!
5.0,"Bags are nice. Part of the material you can see through a bit and believe they intended it that way so shoes could breath. Bag is for one shoe each , men / womens dress shoes or a pair of flip flops would fit in one bag. If your shoes or sports shoes are that bad then you should keep using a plastic bag or bag them first."
5.0,Good Lightweight Vest.
5.0,"I love the size. Perfect fit for my cell phone Samsung Galaxy 6S. The strap is adjustable for length. Just what I needed for trips,shopping, and night life. I bought the all brown and yes it is somewhat shiny but not enough for me to dislike it. I will get a lighter color for spring & summer. It is an all true leather handbag."
5.0,"bought this for wife for xmas gift, she loves it, wears daily for nightgown."
5.0,"had them for my son, my daughter lover hers also!"
5.0,I really like this! The stones hold the scent of the oil. The chain is long.
5.0,"This shirt came quickly and looks good on my husband.<br /><br />The fit is a bit strange, though. It's sorta longer and bigger in the torso and short in the arms. However, my guy is slender, has a shorter torso and has longer arms by an inch or two than usual, so I can't say it's the shirt, though the sleeves did seem particularly short on this shirt.<br /><br />If you have longer arms, don't order. If you are normal sized or even have shorter arms, this will work great.<br /><br />The material is polyester like. It'll work great for cycling and running outside in the fall and spring."
5.0,I have been wearing contacts for years and my vision has declined enough I needed to go back to glasses. I have transitions but they do not help in the car. These over the glasses sunglasses are amazing!  I would highly recommend them!
5.0,"Authentic, delicate & beautiful"
5.0,"These OVersized glasses are so comfortable and I have a pretty big round head, it’s hard to find sunglasses that fit me , and I finally found some that I can’t leave behind ,they go with everything I wear and I always get compliments, they literally look like they could be a high end brand but I definitely got good quality buying these  sunglasses. I will be buying some more as gifts for friend that love them."
5.0,These shoes are adorable!! I have wide feet so I was a little worried about the fit but these are comfortable and don't squeeze my toes!
5.0,"Great, go DODGERS"
5.0,I purchased this for a vintage 1920s party. It is perfect!
5.0,This charm is just what I wanted for my new Grandson.  It fits a Pandora type bracelet (Royal Diamond sold at Amazon) and was perfect for Mother's Day.  Glad I got it.  Thanks Elizabeth Charms for a quick delivery and a cute little charm
5.0,Nicely made shorts. Both fit as expected. The red pair is actually a bit more burgundy in color than the product photo lets you believe but still a nice shade of reddish/purple. The material for these also has a bit of a textured stitching that doesn't show well in the product photos. Overall I am happy with the purchase so far.
5.0,Well made and great product.
5.0,My granddaughter wears a size 3 and they fit perfectly.<br />My daughter-in-law says that they wash very well and have not faded or shrunk.<br />They are very reasonable for Disney prints
5.0,"My grandson loves this hat, no itching!"
5.0,As described. Nice jersey. Wish you could offer custom personalization name and number.
5.0,Fits perfect & comfortable!
5.0,lo uso casi a diario
5.0,"Very cute and matched the description. Made well, and seems to be of good quality. I would recommend if you are in the market for some heart shaped glasses."
5.0,Bought for my wife for a wedding and she loved it.
5.0,Beautiful!! Color is great fits just as I expected. Very soft material has some stretch to it.
5.0,Perfect for my 2 year old son. He loves it.
5.0,"I travel for a living as a Sr. Technology Consultant and constantly struggled to keep all the gear and cords in order for phone, wifi device, extra mouse, bluetooth, etc. I LOVE the Grid-It! Now all of my cords are in one place, clearly visible, and easy to keep in order. I could have used this years ago."
5.0,Great bracelet. Thank you.
5.0,"The shirt is really cute, just a little seethrough/"
5.0,Adorable and good quality.
5.0,I now own this brand and this sort of style in many colors. The only thing that would make them better … Pockets .
5.0,Bought this as a gift and she loved it. A good pedant size.
5.0,The small size belt fit my size 32 waist with 3 inches to spare.  Very comfortable.  Flexes when I bend.  Holds my pants firm.  Would recommend to anyone.
5.0,Great quality hat love mine
5.0,It's so pretty. The material is a bit shiny and the skirt is laser cut. The print is super cute. I really loved it!
5.0,"Good quality, color is nice, comes in a cute box!"
5.0,Love!!! Love !!! My beautiful watch ♥️💕♥️♥️ Elegant and nicely 💕💕
5.0,Can get an inch more room
5.0,Great product and delivered on a timely basis.
5.0,"Awesome,  I Love it!"
5.0,Great gym clothes with bright colors. I will definitely buy them again and again.
5.0,"While I didn't buy this belt from Amazon, I did buy all three colors from another source. Pricing is the same no matter where you buy unless you happen to find a coupon on sites such as offers.com.<br />Anyway, this is an outstanding belt. I now wear them with sports coats, blue jeans, shorts, casual pants or anywhere else you need a belt. The belt moves with you and does not bind or pinch.<br />While it is a bit pricy, it is well worth the expense."
5.0,Great quality! Got so many compliments on it!
5.0,"Love this vintage baseball shirt, its very stylish, soft and made very well. I did order a size larger than I normally wear and it fits me perfectly. I washed the shirt already and if looks just as good as before I threw it in the wash. Love the color of this shirt as well, it can be worn with boots and jeans or tennis shoes, perfect for the fall days ahead. I received this shirt at a discounted price for my unbiased and honest opinion and I highly recommend it."
5.0,This dress was perfect!!! 5’1 200Lb size XL
5.0,"My fiance loves Sailor Moon, so I got him this pin to stick on his work bag. It's small and understated. Just as described by the seller!"
5.0,I was Leary about no wire but it fits nicely and gives me support back & front. I bought my size & it fits perfectly. I will be buying all the colors of this bra.
5.0,Love the shirt lots of compliments. I hate it runs so small.
5.0,Wonderful  - I love it!!
5.0,looking forward to wearing my gift to me
5.0,The bag wasn't what I wanted but I love the company and their handbags and they are very easy to work with.  I will continue to shop with them
5.0,"So comfy but I’m short so I had to hem it, love the pockets"
5.0,These socks are a life saver. Helps greatly with my edema.very very helpful.
5.0,"My husband loves how light this shirt is. I love the quality. It's lightweight, but of good quality."
5.0,"Stylish, great for anytime. The scarf is super cute, I love the pattern. It's a soft material, not itchy on my skin. They have other colors but this style I think goes with most of my winter gear, not that we have much of one here in So Cal =)<br /><br />In the spirit of full disclosure, I was given the above mentioned product free to facilitate my review."
5.0,"I am 5'2&#34;, dress size 12-14, measurements 42-32-42.  I ordered the XL in red with polka-dot collar, and blue with black collar.  Both dresses fit great, and the colors looked exactly like the photos online.  The only fitment issue is the sewn-in belt; the belt is made of the same fabric as the dress, and only goes around the front of the dress.  It is sewn into the sides of the waist, and the button on the front of the belt is sewn to the fabric (not a functioning button and button-hole).  On both dresses, the belt fit too loose on me, so it just hung limply from the waist.  You could remove the button, alter the length of the belt, and re-sew the button if you wish, but I didn't have time to do this so I simply cut the belt off of the dress at the sides (you can't even tell) and added my own black belt, and it looks great.  The only difference between the two dresses is the collar; the polka-dot trim is a different type of fabric than the plain black, and it lays slightly better as it's a bit heavier than the plain black material.  For both dresses, the dress fabric is a thick, soft cotton with plenty of stretch, which makes for a flattering fit as it hugs your curves.  Both dresses immediately got lots of compliments, and I'm sure I'll get a lot of use out of them!"
5.0,"These are so cool! They're sized for actual adults, and on heavier fabric than you'd expect (while still being light enough to be properly flowy). The design is only on one side, but it shows on the other side just fine, too. About the only thing I would change is the elastic that you fasten around your neck. I would add maybe another inch to the length of that, but I have a larger than average neck."
5.0,Beautiful shirt!! I've gotten so many compliments and it's a beautiful material
5.0,I have so many watches that I can't wear any more because the strap loops tore apart. This solved it! Gave new life to 2 of my favorite watches.
5.0,Very soft and warm. I would recommend this scarf to anyone.
5.0,Amazing. I want one in every color!!!!
5.0,Great fit! Very comfortable for those 12-hour shifts at the hospital!
5.0,"Very good quality and well manufactured buckle, compared with some other high end (high price) belts!"
5.0,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this ring! It fits well, feels like you’re wearing nothing and it’s easy to take on and off. Will purchase another one"
5.0,it looks exactly as it does in the pic. Im  happy
5.0,"These slipper socks are very soft, and have good slip guards on the bottoms.  I purchased for my 3 1/2 yr. old granddaughter, and they fit, but just fit.  Since they are just for ""kicking around"" at Grandma's house, I feel they were a good buy."
5.0,My daughter looked so cute in this top for Christmas pictures! Good fit and material! Might buy one for myself!
5.0,Perfect size and shiny.
5.0,"These earrings arrived on time, and are so darling. They’re perfect for cartilage piercings!"
5.0,I bought two different kind of bracelets and both have held up great as well as look great too.  Highly recommend!
5.0,!. They loo good.  2.  They don't hurt.
5.0,"High quality hoodie, thick and well made."
5.0,Fits perfect and is so soft! Love it
5.0,just loved them
5.0,So amazing! They are nice and soft without being too thick. Loved them so much a bought a few more pairs 🙌🏽
5.0,"I love these glasses so much! I always worried I'd feel silly wearing glasses despite 20/20 vision, but these do so much for my look that I wish I had gotten them sooner."
5.0,"Bought the Camel Crown 3in1 jacket for my wife for her birthday basically because I just couldn't afford the jacket with it's logo on the back shoulder (I think that's stupid anyway),and also because it had good reviews. My wife really loves the jacket and it fits perfect! Keep in mind that I ordered a large instead of a medium because of what everyone said on here, so make sure you do that. The jacket is just as nice as her other shoulder blade logo and maybe a little better because it has a few cool pockets that come in handy on a hike. But when compared to the price, it's definitely the winner hands down. You can get three of these for the cost of one of the others!"
5.0,Great chocker necklaces and I love the charms. Great buy and they arrived on time
5.0,Dress fit as expected.
5.0,Very good product and service!
5.0,Purchased as a gift for son.  He likes it.  Holds all his cards and he really likes the money strap.
5.0,"Fits everything.  small but has become my everyday purse:  phone, all the cards you need, paper money, change. it's great !"
5.0,A+++ Great seller!  I hope we deal again!
5.0,"very nice, high quality. I did not use them yet, already like the colour and size."
5.0,"Even though I'm only 27 years old, I like high waisted ""granny panties"" like these because they're so comfortable. I'm on the larger side and like something to hold my stomach in while smoothing me out so my clothes look better. These panties do a great job at that, particular because the material is nice and thick, lending itself for more support. These are definitely not panties I would wear on a date, but my god are they comfortable! So much better than having a thong riding up and not providing any support."
5.0,"I love this! It is a perfect lightweight jacket to take camping or fishing. You can barely tell that you are wearing it because it's lightweight. One thing I love about this, it doesn't have all the fuzzy cotton on the inside. I look forward to wearing this when there is a little breeze but right now it's to warm.  I love the coloring. I got the navy blue and it has kind of a pearled  look to it. The pockets are big and it don't appear that your stuff will just fall out. I definitely recommend if you want something with the features mentioned.<br /><br /> I received this item at a discounted rated or free in exchange for my honest unbiased review. I do hope this helps you in making a decision."
5.0,Divinos
5.0,Love this!  Colors are perfect and for great!
5.0,"Beautiful bracelet, delicate and worth the money. Highly recommend!"
5.0,They are perfect!  They are the size I was expecting.  They have the sparkle I was expecting as well.  I have received quite a few compliments already. Love them!
5.0,funny and well made
5.0,Awesome for my little black dress.
5.0,I swear sometimes the size reviews are a set up. So many if you said it runs big and long. If you are short please do not give length reviews. These are very nice but are not long AT ALL and DO NOT run big. Buy your size. I am a size medium and should have bought a medium and not small. Now all mediums are sold out. These skirts are suppose to flow and not be snug ladies. The pleats are not suppose to separate on you. It is designed to flow beautifully. I am so annoyed right now.
5.0,"This dress is gorgeous!! Love the pattern, the design for the bust area... simply beautiful! :)"
5.0,Nice glasses. The best ones I’ve found to fit my smaller Head/face.
5.0,"Beautiful colors, fits and feels great"
5.0,I love this it’s perfect
5.0,"Perfect item! They fit just as described.  I wish the material were a little softer, but they aren't harsh.  They are cute shorts.  Short enough to be interesting but not slutty short."
5.0,Quality bank along with a great price!
5.0,Looks great on my grandson!
5.0,"Often, when you get camo garments, you may sacrifice quality. Not the case with this swimsuit. Nicely made. Mesh lining in the suit keeps body parts in place. As well as mesh side pockets (not the cargo pockets, which have Velcro closures). 100% polyester for quick drying. Elastic waist with string tie.<br /><br />These are surprisingly well made, and quite comfortable. I even wear them when I'm not going swimming.<br /><br />Very satisfied with this purchase."
5.0,I love these little septum rings. The value can’t be beat. Doesn’t make me break out or anything & im sensitive to jewelry.
5.0,Umm this dress is amazing and for $10! I ordered XL and I usually wear size 18. It's thin material but the dress is perfect fit (not tight) so you can't see through. Definitely going to buy more!
5.0,5'1'' 115lbs and small was a perfect fit
5.0,These were for my little nephews age 3 and 7. It fit them perfectly
5.0,"Really nice suit.  I am rather large chested, and short, so the coverage on the top by the underarm were a bit revealing.  Overall super cute suit for the price and it fit just as expected.  Thank you!!!"
5.0,Beautiful and comfortable dress. Perfect for beach and summer weather. Fabric is extremely comfortable and feels great on the skin.
5.0,Great value for high quality attire.

5.0,the bag is beautiful and great quality meets my expectations and I will use it often
5.0,"Love this dress, fits exactly as expected, and very comfortable."
5.0,"Gorgeous watch , everyone drools at it it’s so nice and exclusive . Would sell it for 4 times it’s original value"
5.0,"If your looking for a tactical belt to fit regular pants,  this one does in my opinion.  The 1"" width fits the belt loops on my Izod shorts."
5.0,Great weight. Great length very comfortable and the price was right !!!
5.0,Came in time for my wedding and looked beautiful in my bridesmaid's bouquets.

5.0,Very pretty ring. The pictures don’t do it justice.
5.0,They fit great and I am so glad I ordered them.
5.0,I love this sandals I can use them everyday!
5.0,Loving these so much I had to buy more. The fit is perfect! Not too tight and not too loose. My son is just in 9 mo clothing so the 9-12 he will grow into. We just fold the legs and arms up and it stays because of the seam. I love that these will fit him for months. The design is so cute and the quality is great nice thick material.
5.0,I ordered this dress for my mother in Texas. Took a little to get to her....but she loved the style and cloth. She is usually a medium..but I got her a large because I wasn't sure how true the sizes were. Seems like it is true to size because it fit her to big. She took it to the tailors and got it fitted.
5.0,Love this haven’t taken it off since I got it
5.0,Grandkids loved these for 4th of July. Nice and affordable.
5.0,Cute earrings for the price!
5.0,These are by far the coolest glasses I have. They're so flimsy but for the price and how cool they look I don't really care.
5.0,My granddaughters loved these.  They are 2 and 4 and easy for them to use.
5.0,Perfect.  Using it all winter.  Hope I can get a white or beige one just like it for summer.
5.0,I really love this dress! I think it is perfect for the holidays! It’s a nice burgundy red and it is surprisingly a very comfy material which is great. I can dress it up for a holiday party or dress it down for a more casual look. I think it runs a little big in size but It still fit me perfectly!
5.0,Gift for my daughter.  Fits great!
5.0,Shipment came quicker than expected.  Lightweight and comfortable.
5.0,I love my new sunglasses. Just what I was looking for.
5.0,I got this pants because I thought they are cute I mean a bunch of bandanas put together to make short how cute. it fit as expected wasn't tight fitted well worth the buy.
5.0,The necklace is small and dainty and absolutely beautiful. I love it and how it looks in contrast to my skin tone.
5.0,A nice crisp woven fabric with NO stretch to it. It for very well and looks great.

5.0,"Beautiful product, good customer service"
5.0,"These belts fit my petite figure nicely, and I love the material and quality."
5.0,These sandals offered more support than I expected plus they’re cute. I am very pleased!
5.0,I love these! They look so shiny and pretty. I can tell it was cheaper quality because the stick that goes into the ear was wiggly but you can’t beat it for the price. I’ve already worn it many times and got my money’s worth. Would purchase again for sure!
5.0,Love them and its light weight and easy to breath through
5.0,Fit great and opaque. High waist didn't roll down. Love them as much as Lulu!
5.0,"Been having for about a month and this my first time wearing. Arrived as stated, in a Lil box n package was neat. In person it is a gorgeous set. Love it."
5.0,Very nice earrings!  Love them!
5.0,I'll admit it; I am a habitual buyer of $$$ designer sunglasses.  But these are great to have and keep in the car for a spare pair that you don't have to worry about -- they are very stylish and go with casual or work outfits; solid black always looks great.  I am going to order another pair for additional backup!
5.0,Love these. I am very active at work and they also have good tummy support without feeling too tight. I did seem to sweat more but they look nice and fit well.
5.0,They are beautiful and very high quality. Bought 8 of them as Christmas Gifts. Love!
5.0,very nice shirt. not cheap at all. nice fabric and very well put together. really high quality shirt and materials. i highly recommend to anyone interested. very good deal on shirts i bought 2.

5.0,Great for hiking and riding our ATC’s and provide comfort and support.
5.0,"This was my very first time ordering any type of clothing from Amazon. I was so nervous that I wasn't going to be able to fit them once they arrived, but once they came in they were a true fit!"
5.0,Just like the picture. Looks great. Adds just enough animal print to my outfit.
5.0,"This is made out of a nice soft material. It feels like a nice quality sweater. Perfect for a nice outting. Cut looks weird on me, so it is not meant to fit every body style."
5.0,Love love love this shirt! It's longer in the back which is perfect for so many looks. The blue color is just as pictured online. It's a vibrant color!!! The neckline is tailored well and fits comfortably. The sleeves can be adjusted up or down with the D rings. I prefer them up because when they are down they have half the D ring exposed and dangling from the outside. The material is not too sheer and is comfortable to wear. It's such a flattering shirt on so many body types. I received this shirt at a discount in exchange for an honest review and love it.
5.0,Bought these for my grandson. He loves them. Says they keep his hands warm and dry
5.0,Perfect everyday earrings!
5.0,I really like this.  I ordered another color in the same size but it was too big.  Giving it to a friend.
5.0,I LOVE this rose gold watch band. I am really happy with my purchase. I was a little iffy at first but definitely did not disappoint. The rose gold tone is not exactly like my watch but you really can't tell unless you are looking for it. I will be purchasing more bands and a case.
5.0,"great fit, but do not put in drier it will shrink"
5.0,Excellent Product Its

5.0,Fits perfectly.  Beautiful color & quality :)
5.0,Perfect! Just what he wanted.
5.0,This is my new favorite dress! So comfortable and love the way it looks. I wear a 6 and the small fits perfectly. I’d say it’s true to size. Pockets are nice too!
5.0,"Super soft, love the quality! Will definitely buy another one maybe in a size smaller. I did want a baggier more comfortable sweatshirt for work so I bought I size up from usual. Definitely got exactly what I paid for!"
5.0,For the price it is a really great deal.
5.0,"Sturdy, no issues, my coworkers loved them"
5.0,This is exactly what I was looking for as I prepare for an overseas trip.
5.0,I ordered this dress in a size small but had to return it for a medium instead. I am 5’2” and weigh 123 lbs. The medium fits perfectly and the dress is beautiful! The small size fit me but it was rather tight. With the medium I have room to move around.
5.0,"If you are a mermaid, you must get this....ASAP!!! I am in love😍😍😍 It's bigger than I originally thought it was and that's no problem with me!!"
5.0,"These are cool...and they fit well. When I searched for &#34;narrow&#34; wayfarer style, I wasn't looking for a pair of sunglasses that were for a narrow face. What I was looking for was a wayfarer style that had lenses that were narrower from top to bottom. I've never liked the way most wayfarers looked on my face because of lens size, but I always liked the cool style. So, I was nervous about the fit, but they are great...so great, after I received my first pair I ordered a second pair just in case I needed a spare! Hope this review helps!"
5.0,My granddaughter was delighted with her pendant.
5.0,bought this for my wife and she loves it

5.0,Love these sneakers
5.0,"Let's be honest, I have a big head. I hate when glasses rub my cheeks or touch the sides of my face. These are awesome! Cheap (cause ain't scratch them) and have a nice DARK tint. The mirror look is a plus. The colors are bright. Great buy"
5.0,"Comfortable enough for all day wear, 12 hour shifts!"

5.0,"I'm 5ft and 110, typically wear a 0 or 2 and this fit great.  Anything not petite is typically long in the arms for me as was this, but not too bad.  Super cute option for an 'ugly' Christmas party."
5.0,Amazing backpack!! 👌🏼 100% Recommend..
5.0,My wife loves this necklace. She says the fit is perfect and likes the simple elegance of this necklace
5.0,I like them. They are pretty. The knot is a little larger than I expected but I will keep them. They will be perfect for my outfit.

5.0,Rave review from me!!! Whoever designed this little gem has done a fine service for all bracelet lovers!  I LOVE it.
5.0,I love this. Ordered the other colors because it fits well. Slightly snug but it works.
5.0,I love the bright colors. They fit great for my ears no discomfort. The jellyfish as able to be seen. Over all great looking
5.0,My mom loves this (it sounds like a Chinese medicine ball)
5.0,For my 1 year old great-grandson’s birthday. It was absolutely adorable.
5.0,Great quality! It’s like riding a unicorn naked and bareback over a rainbow! 🦄🌈
5.0,"Nice design, leather, and color. Easy to spot esp that we mix it with other keys in a dark spot in the house"
5.0,I bought these for my beautiful girlfriend and they look absolutely gorgeous on her. She tells me they are very comfy and has no issues when wearing them for long periods of time. Definitely an amazing pair of boots.
5.0,"wife loved it, good quality, one of the best mother day gifts the kids could get her, she was so happy"
5.0,I tied it to make it crop top
5.0,Wow very nice thick well made material looks sexy😊 Fits perfect and fast shipping thank you I love it
5.0,Bought these for a hospice patient.  The socks were perfect and arrived very fast. Item exactly as described.  Very happy with my purchase.  Thank you.
5.0,It was sot and comfortable. I wore it to my homecoming. Very chic and fashionable
5.0,Wow I love this beautiful necklace such a lovely sound.
5.0,This is the most beautiful face mask I own! The material is outstanding! Comes w/ extra vent inserts. The mask has a pocket to put a filter in. Get one you’ll be satisfied!
5.0,"Great dress watch. This is the newest addition to a collection of a tag hauer, a borealis, armada's, seiko's, victorinox, ect. The orient is an excellent addition. The case size is perfect at around 42mm with a thickness of 11mm. The band is high quantity but the greatest characteristic of the watch is the face. The blue is beautiful and the eye at the 9 o'clock position showing the movement is the selling point for me. The Roman numerals are very well done in white and compliment the blue dial perfectly. If your in the market for a dress watch this is a great choice. It having a 22mm lug width makes it a perfect candidate for any after market straps. I can't recommend this time piece enough, especially coming from a company with such a positive reputation as orient."
5.0,"Beautiful dress. I was expecting a transparent and or slippery material since most of these kinda dresses appear o be so but no. Very cute reason at a reasonable price. I love it and I'll certainly recommend if asked. For the reference,  I'm 5'8 , 118lbs and a 34B cup size. I ordered an S and it fits as expected"
5.0,Very reflective. Fits great. Super bright. Photos are right out of the box with flash and no flash. Can't wait to use this soon for night runs. Great customer service and marketing as well :)
5.0,"Love these scrub caps! They are great quality, material is nice and thick, and the buttons is an added bonus to keep your mask off of your ears. I would definitely recommend this product!"
5.0,"This is such a beautiful gift and what a great, original idea. Not only do you get a beautiful pin but you get matching wrist bands for mom and baby.  This is gorgeous, original and great for a shower gift.  So pretty!"
5.0,"These are my absolute favorite sunglasses! Only complaint would be the silver decals rub off after some time, but I don't even care. I love these so much!"
5.0,"I love this cute little suit. Reasonable price, good fit. I'd imagine it fits a lot of shapes and sizes too. I'm in the more voluptuous category and it looks nice."
5.0,Bought for family member and then returned to buy another set of huggy earrings. Comfortable.
5.0,Great vest I wear it every so often I was concerned about the crotch flap at the bottom but it detaches so you can have it on or not
5.0,"Made in U.S , really fun brand, loved the top!"
5.0,"So cute, I love the adjustable bead on it with the rubber inside of it, I haven't seen that before."

5.0,"Fast shipping, well made.  Could be worn on or off shoulders.  One of my new fav's!  I plan to get this in more colors."
5.0,These are beautiful earrings. They seem to be made well. Many compliments.
5.0,Daughter really likes it
5.0,"This dress fits perfectly and falls right above my knees.  I am planning on wearing it to a wedding and also work.  You can really dress it up or down.  The fabric is so soft and comfortable.  The tie belt is the perfect length, but also removeable if you wanted to use a different belt.  Love it!"
5.0,de muy buen material y económicas
5.0,"I am utterly in love with this casual, roomy and well made hand bag. As another reviewer stated, the handbag is generally larger than I was expecting. I can fit an amazing number of items inside, including my MacBook Pro even. The craftsmanship is excellent for the price, shipment and delivery was fast, and I expect many years of enjoyment out of this handbag. I highly recommend this bag to anyone who has a casual, carefree style."
5.0,My 3 year old was so excited to take this to Disney World. He felt so grown up!
5.0,My fiance love it
5.0,Got it on the prime deal! What a cool glasses! It looks great on my skin tone and suits most of my dresses! Stylish and cat eye shape is really cute!<br />. Sturdy too! It’s an awesome buy for the money!
5.0,Perfect wardrobe staple piece. I get compliments every time I wear it. Love it!!!
5.0,"My grandson loves this shirt, nice quality"
5.0,"These socks fit as expected, and are comfortable to me. They are a bit dressier than your normal pair of socks, so I would wear them in a way that they can be seen and shown off, and I would avoid wearing them as the type of sock to say garden, or workout in. If you are looking for something with a little frill that also looks a bit retro/vintage, these are great!<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted promotional rate for an honest and unbiased review."
5.0,I bought this to wear with a pair of overalls for a White Trash Bash and it fit perfectly! My boobs were out a bit more than expected but it was fine haha. Fabric was not tight it was loose. Will wear again.
5.0,"I am a 38B, and pretty small. I bought these to wear a low cut top which I would not be able to wear a bra with, but am not comfortable going with nothing on. These are easy enough to work with and did stay on throughout the evening. Mind you, I only wore them for about 3 hrs. I did have to reposition them a few times to get the look I wanted or to make sure the top wasnt peaking out the top of the shirt. I haven't reused them after, so I can't comment on their ability to wear and re-wear them unfortunately, so I will try to update this once I use them a second time."
5.0,I gave it as a birthday gift and the recipient seemed to be very pleased.
5.0,"These are top quality pants. Suitable for the workplace, home, or hanging out with friends.<br />I love these pants so much I had to buy more colors!"
5.0,"Love it.  Nice design, water and stain resistant.  Not too big and not too small - great for day adventure or light overnight."
5.0,"I do a fair amount of shopping on Amazon and I have to do returns pretty often as well. This dress succeeded my wildest expectations for a body con dress! Because of the peplum at the waist which covers any little bulges or imperfections you might have while standing or sitting and the color was wonderful for work and play (purple-navy dress)I always get compliments when I wear it and it is very flattering on me. I wear control top panty hose when I wear it to help smooth out my bulges but the dress does a great job on its own it falls very nicely it's light enough to be worn during the summer and with a cardigan or jacket can easily go into late fall. I'm going back to buy this dress in its many different colors as I can because the fit is so flattering and it is true to size. I bought a medium I am 5'6 and a 1/2 And I weigh a 135 pounds on a very good day, i usually fluctuate up 5-6lbs pretty often. Also, I am an older woman so I still don't have the muscle tone I would like and I have bulges here and there this dress hides them beautifully!"
5.0,Exactly as described. Runs a little small but it was perfect for the occasion
5.0,Great for travel. Always had problems with shoe trees hat were too heavy for traveling. These are easy to use and very light weight.
5.0,"These are phenomenal. Used them today for the first time. I was used to those gloves with the padding on the palms - my fingers and hands would eventually go numb with those if I didn't give my hands a break every so often. Didn't have to with these. I did not expect them to be better, but I'm gonna be ordering a second pair for myself so I can have one here and one down at my in-law's house where we also do some riding."
5.0,I bought these for my sister's Christmas gift. She has not taken them off and told me they are the best gift she received this year. They are pretty adorable.
5.0,delivered very fast looks great
5.0,"Was much smaller than I was expecting, but kinda worked better that way. Sleek, elegant, shiny. Gave it as a gift for mom and she loves it, says she gets lots of compliments."
5.0,This was for my son.  He loves things like this.
5.0,Sequined scarf.<br />It’s dressy and sparkly. Will be pretty with my black turtleneck and black palazzos. I would expect to pay twice the $10.99 somewhere else. Carol

I popped it in the dryer just for a quick few minutes and walaah!  Still looked amazing.  I love the ruffle detail of the dress as it helps camaflauge my tummy.  Highly recommend this dress.  I am 5'7 1/2, 180 pounds I orderd a XL and it fit perfectly.....!"
5.0,"THE MOST EXQUISITE PIECE I HAVE SEEN ONLINE!<br />The princess cut is the most elegant.<br />A great gift for any woman who is fearful of losing really expensive jewelry.<br />After I lost my mother's ring with rows of stacked diamonds, I gave up on wearing real diamonds.<br />This is a keeper!"
5.0,"I love this stalysh and amazing suitcases... I bought two of them.. and I was able to put 50 lb inside, just what my airline allow to, so it was perfect."
5.0,Absolutely gorgeous pendulum. I recommend this seller.
5.0,Bought as a gift. Very well received
5.0,I bought this for my wife and she loves it. It was a great find and it was very affordable as well.

5.0,Wonderful accessory
5.0,Perfect fit for my septum
5.0,I absolutely love wearing these and I keep in them in for months at a time!
5.0,I wear it in bath still did not rust.
5.0,"It's a beautiful dress, looks as the model. It's not heavy fabric and good quality. The cords helps you for modify the neckline back and top as you like it. My recommendation for this dress is wash it in delicate and leave it dry in a hanger. The color is dark red or wine or Burgundy. My camera does not have good resolution for you can see the real color but I will try my best."
5.0,"the leather is very stiff, but that's what you expect -- it kept the bag from being flimsy. the color was a little more beige than the picture shows, but in my opinion it's an incredibly beautiful bag. fit my laptop inside no problem. would definitely buy again."
5.0,"Fantastic.  Bought these for an adult birthday girl to wear boating, they were great.  They also have a little tint that makes the sunset AMAZING.  These were lost off the back of the boat and another pair was immediately requested."
5.0,Compression? Not so much. Comfortable? Definitely. Would recommend. I ordered a medium and it fit snug and is stretchy.
5.0,I love everything about the skirt
5.0,"Very classy and sexy, I received lots of complements. I am 5'2'', full figured. I wore this with a black knee high boot and leather like pants."
5.0,"Its so cute, its thin so wear something underneath. It runs small so go a size up"
5.0,Quality beyond fabulous !!<br />The best I have found After shopping everywhere .<br />Had a small gift as promised<br />PAckaging top knot .<br />ThAnk you !!!<br />Will buy again
5.0,"i received this product in exchange for an unbiased and honest review. the shipping was fast as it normally is for amazon prime and it was packaged securely in a box, colors are bright. the instructions are clear and easy to follow. the design is bright and colorful. has many color choices The wrist wraps are comfortable to wear and thick and hold in place.the face has bright easy to read time second time hand is a nice addition, winds up nice comes with preset date and time.  the are lightweight and compact for easy storage in gym bag,car or purse. they are made of durable material which can be wiped clean with damp cloth. The tools made it very easy to interchange the watch face plate. i like this product its good quality and priced right This product is great because its made of durable sturdy materials, its very usable, fashionable and hip, and is a great product that does as described. this is a great conversation opener made from a great company I referred this product to all my friends this review is my own personal opinion and may differ from another persons"
5.0,"These affordable tights are funky and fun. They fit as expected. If you are on the curvy side, like me, the fabric's vibrancy diminishes a bit as it gets stretched, but not as much as other leggings I have worn. They are on the warm side because of the Lycra material."
5.0,I absolutely love these sunnies. They arrived quickly and were packaged nicely. Definitely recommend.
5.0,Fits my wrist perfectly and I love the color! Highly recommended 👍🏾
5.0,It looks cute on my watch. Love it!
5.0,I feel like the photos do not do this VERY PRETTY dress the justice it deserves.  It is an all-around really nice dress.  The style is super flattering and the fabric is the perfect weight.  It’s has the perfect amount of stretch—not overly tight but hugs in all the right places.  It’s also thick enough to hide any panty and bra lines.  Not at all see-through.  I love the front tie too.  This will be my go-to event dress this summer.
5.0,I got exactly what I ordered. They were perfect and came extremely fast. Very happy with the product.
5.0,Very light material... Must have missed the side zippers in the description..? Pleasant bonus.
5.0,I'm  extremely impressed with this watch. For the price you can't go wrong.
5.0,love it.....very comfortable on the wrist
5.0,"Very comfortable, slight blue tint from an angle and just wide enough for my big head.  These are quite comfortable and the accessories that it includes is a nice touch."
5.0,Awesome Christmas earrings!! Super cheap!
5.0,"I'm a size 12 or 14. I thought the plus version of this would be too loose.  This one's a little snug, but wearable at my waist. I would not be able to sling this low at all.<br /><br />Great price and I'm impressed with the quality."
5.0,"So pretty, the cuff hurts after a while but still fun to wear. I love the hint of blue though."
5.0,"Soft, light weight earrings, with bold and beautiful spooktacular designs. Perfect for Fall."
5.0,"I love it! I wear a 14-16 in American Eagle pants, I’m 5”3 and just gave birth so I weigh 196 at the moment. I ordered the xxl (a size up to be safe) and it fits a little snug but comfortable if that makes sense. The fluffy skirt was the only thing that was almost too little but easily fixed. I love the dress and it’s made pretty well!!"
5.0,"This dress looks cute and elegant, very stylish. The color is beautiful. I get many compliments from people around me."
5.0,I love it. Perfect fit! Length and cloth quality is great also.

5.0,"This is my third pair of these glasses. This order replaces a pair that was lost. I use these for cycling. They are wonderful. They're sturdy, They fit. The hardshell case is just right. The reading lenses are positioned perfectly and work well. So great to be able to easily see my watch or phone while wearing these sunglasses."
5.0,The bracelet is very nice and I gave it as a gift. The quality was good too.
5.0,"I like that they came individually packaged with a cute tag. Only one of the 12 seems to need re-glued at the bottom  (the one I opened, defect pictured). They are not all perfectly straight, but with a little manipulation I was able to easily straighten out the one I opened.  It was a little bit snug on my adult head, but it’s perfect for my kids ages 2 to 9. The colors are perfect. I am happy with what I got for what I paid and the kids are going to love them."
5.0,love them.  great leggings
5.0,Fit so nice loved this
5.0,"I love this dress SO much. I may order another in a different color just to shake things up. Not skin tight, but fits just enough. The fabric is cut to shape your form, so you don't look like you are wearing a straight potato sack.  I recommend for all body types."
5.0,My favs:  Love that they are made of cotton - the style is most comfortable for my body shape.
5.0,This case is adorable! Fits her glasses perfectly and it's a lot sturdier than I expected it to be!
5.0,"Fits great! Long and warm, and love the kangaroo pocket on the front! Thicker than t-shirt material, but not too thick! Perfect for our South Carolina fall & winter temps. Well made."
5.0,"This watch band is not only beautiful, but very easy to use.  In fact, we liked it so much, we just bought another one - so now we have both a silver and a black watch band.  Outstanding design and quality."

5.0,GORGEOUS!! 😍
5.0,Muy buena calidad me quedaron espectacular.
5.0,This is a high-quality travel bag! I used it on a short trip (3 days) and it held all of my clothes and accessories. There are plenty of pockets to store small items and it easily fits in an overhead bin on an airplane or under the seat. I am very pleased with my purchase! I would highly recommend it for traveling!
5.0,Love the quality ! Love the speed of shipment and the color is so nice.<br /><br />looks really nice with black watches.<br /><br />Instagram @CCordova8
5.0,"I never used any kind of oil or boot product before, but this restored color, shine, as well as rehydrated my used boots. The product doesn’t smell bad and was fun to use, like a wash and wax on a cars paint. Be aware it darkens brown leather, so my brown boots that look tan and worn are now brown again, black boots it did nothing to the color only shine and hydrated."
5.0,"What a fun shirt! The material is lightweight and breathable. I really love the appliques on the sleeves! The flowers are sewn on tightly, and have a really beautiful embroidery in between the cloth flowers.<br /><br />I ordered this in a medium and was happy with the size - I can usually wear a medium or small in shirts, so if you want a more flowy fit, I'd size up!<br />I didn't find the shirt too see-through either, so it would be work-appropriate as well~<br /><br />This shirt came with an extra button as well, for the back neck part!"
5.0,"On time, fits good, and is warm. Great for walking."
5.0,The towels are beautiful. The quality is fantastic and they really add beautiful detail to the room. We are not using these towels as everyday items so I can't speak to the comfort but as bathroom showcase - they are perfect.
5.0,"It seemed like it would be impossible to re-lace the boat shoes, but this tool made it quick and easy."
5.0,"The beanie is a little tight where it goes around your head, but I like how it fits everywhere else. I have kind of a large head, so for people with a smaller head it may not be so bad. It seems to stay in one place and is definitely doing a good job keeping my head warm."
5.0,They are very nice quality
5.0,Gave it as a gift to me SIL and she loved it. The bag looked elegant and of good quality. It was soft and well made.

5.0,"The dress was true to size with multiple options for wear.  With weather in the 80 's, worn with a slip, appropriate for outdoor dining and comfortable! I also wore as a cover up even in the pool which dried nicely.  Excellent price!"
5.0,I got this because I needed a new pocketbook and I don't like to send lots of money on them. Everyone asked me if it was a designer bag and couldn't believe how little I was able to get it for. It was roomy enough to hold all the crap I carry with me. It is very sturdy and the color I got is the perfect.<br />For sure worth your money!
5.0,"Very nice wears well, its very sheer and thin but it is a great go to with anything"

5.0,"Quality, Size, Style, Versatile, Great Cost and packed with care. Great for weddings or any after 5 affair!"
5.0,"I got this bracelet as a gift for Christmas and I absolutely adore it. I have only had it for two days, but I think it is absolutely beautiful. It arrived in a light pink box and was wrapped around a jewelry pillow. Very beautiful shipping, my mom just kept it in the box and wrapped it in wrapping paper. It is not adjustable, so be cautious of that when ordering. I have small wrists and it fits me perfectly, but if you have big wrists, you should definitely pay attention to the sizing. I don't know how this bracelet will do in the long-run, but for now I absolutely love it."
5.0,My son's obsession with this hood is extreme. Shipping takes a little while. It's not a heavy hoodie more a light weather. The graphics are amazing. My son loves it and I'm the hero that found it for him so winner winner

5.0,"What a fun shirt t wear! The patterns and colors are eye catching without being overly bright. The fabric is smooth against my skin and the seams are superbly sewn.

5.0,"I absolutely love these and want to buy more, but they only have them in a size small. I need a 2x."
5.0,Just as expected. Same quality as the same hats I see in the stores for much more
5.0,I was very happy to see that this keychain was a great size and very substantial. Great purchase!
5.0,Very nice necklace and was very good priced! Would recommend! Nice quality.
5.0,"Very well made, simple to use!"
5.0,These earrings look expensive and pair well with casual or dressy attire.
5.0,"Love this piece, so casual and versatile. I sized up one to an XL to make sure it wouldn't be too tight over my thunda thighs. The bust was a little too big but I just safety pinned it together. Fabric is a very stretchy, soft, jersey-like material so I expect it to pill like soft fabrics do. Overall, great staple piece."
5.0,"I ordered a 'Zattcas Womens Long Sleeve Casual Floral Swing Tee Shirt Dresses with Pockets Black Large' to review.  This dress has been worn multiple times by my wife.  It has worn well with washing on delicate and even throwing it in the dryer on low.  It is sewn well with good seams.  My wife wears a size 6-8 pants and this dress is form fitting.  I would definitely order up a size or two.  The length is a bit short for my wife to wear as a dress, rather she wears it with a pair of leggings underneath. Overall good quality, great addition to my wife's wardrobe."
5.0,"Second time buying these boots. I absolutely love them and for the price, you can't find better.<br /><br />Surprisingly good quality."
5.0,this is just what I was looking for - small dainty that could be paired with other bracelets.  nice quality.

5.0,buena compra
5.0,"Great looking hat, looks super high end, great quality !"

5.0,Excellent quality and color combos.  Color-coordination is now a breeze.

5.0,"Love the way it feels, and fits!  Super soft material!"
5.0,"For three or four dollars, you cannot do wrong with this procuct. Easy to adjust and looks good. Had for 3 months now, no problems."
5.0,These are so adorable and my daughter gets so many compliments.
5.0,"I consider this ring to be a wide band. At 1/3"" wide, it makes a bold but beautiful statement.<br /><br />It has 26 cubic zirconia ranging in size from very small to one that is larger than the rest. They give the impression that they were sprinkled over the gold gently to form a cluster of sparkles.<br /><br />I don't recommend wearing this ring as a stackable due to its width. It looks beautiful enough by itself. Let is sparkle all alone."
5.0,My husband loves it!!! I'm buying two more.
5.0,A little tight in the shoulders for my friend
5.0,Nice & spacious! Great value for your money! I bought it for myself😬 & still using it after wedding The best part is being able to wear it after the wedding bc it doesn’t say bride. You’re only a bride for a period of time but a Mrs. for ever! 😉
5.0,"I love it, it enhanced my wedding gown.👍👍👍"
5.0,These were a hit! Perfect for party favors & let me just say-they are not small!
5.0,"I absolutely love these leggings. I intend to get a couple more. They are very flattering, and comfortable. I tend to wear them as a casual dress outfit. They would be perfect for strength/weights/yoga workout days.<br /><br />My only request is as a mom I would appreciate pockets for hands free moments. 😀"
5.0,"It is a really nice cover up, very sexy.  It runs small, I would go a size up."
5.0,"Very nice material. Have other pairs in many colors. Comfortable, wear to gym & for everyday."
5.0,Beautifully crafted. Does not come in protective packaging though
5.0,Very pleased with purchase.  Exceeded expections.
5.0,"A fantastic item, I purchased it for my wife and she is very happy with it, the item is exactly as pictured and arrived faster than expected, I'm very happy with it"
5.0,Exactly what you would expect.
5.0,Got these as a stocking stuffer for my grandfather and he loves it! He's really into science and he thought these pins were very cool. He wore one on his lapel for the rest of the day. The pins seem to be high quality and the designs are awesome. Definitely get this for the Sagan fan in your life!
5.0,Hands down the BEST DRESS! Quality is amazing. I am always a small in dresses and this fit perfect.
5.0,I ordered this wallet months ago and have filled it with everything from Insurance Cards to cash and it has withstood the abuse. I love my little pink wallet.
5.0,"The kids loved these at my son's wrestling party, they were a big hit"
5.0,"This nylon adjustable wristband is so superior to the silicone wristbands that came with my size small Fitbit Alta HR device because this nylon one is more adjustable with the Velcro attachment, more pliable, and does not irritate my wrist like the original silicone ones sometimes did. Being an adult who has small wrists, the length of this wristband is perfect for me. This nylon wristband is also washable with mild soap like Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser. I liked the first one so much that I ordered a second one to swap out when I wash the first one."
5.0,My wife loves “different” socks and will wear them at various family events and cause comments. Her current pair are very light weight and traditional calf length. She likes these short socks much better as well as the heavier weight. The vibrant colors don’t hurt either because they do get noticed and spark conversation. These are much better made than her current pair.<br /><br />She does not use them for running but because they are FUN.
5.0,"Nice, kinda feels like silicone and not so much leather, but is very pretty"
5.0,Much more Beautiful in person than on the pictures very happy with my buy :)
5.0,It was good buy until i saw it again for sale at $10.00  less that what I paid only 10 days ago...<br />Do you honor a price difference????
5.0,THEY  are decent quality but not as thick as my carthart and no where near as heavy but it is decent quality!
5.0,I'm truly not as nimble as I once was and this bracelet mate helps me latch my bracelets without assistance. It's a tool worth having!
5.0,Me encanto demasiada hermosa muy delicada y fina
5.0,Love my wallet!! it arrived a day earlier than expected. with many places to put my cards and stuff in it. I really like the fact that it is RFID blocking it makes me feel safer.

5.0,Gift for hubby. Works good and fast shipping
5.0,"Order 1 size up for a nice loose fit. Super durable, breathable, but also warm enough on cooler days."
5.0,We use this for a luau table centerpiece that people could take home
5.0,"best glasses at the best price, don't let this bargain pass you by!!!"
5.0,My husband LOVES this bathing suit!!
5.0,was a gift purchase & she loves it!!
5.0,"This bralette is so much more beautiful than what the pictures show and even my best attempts to take pictures that show just how beautiful it is,,, fall very short !  Honestly it is not so much beautiful as it is sexy in a classy dignified way ! I think the reasons why it looks that way, is because there is detail in every aspect of it . There is lace and flowers and cute edges and tiny bare patterns that add a little here and there all over it . The entire bralette is like this!  It is extremely detailed. Plus the strap adjusters are a bright gold color and that may seem like no big deal but they are incredibly visible and look amazing with the dark rich black color. Once again you can't tell by the pictures. There are so many things about this you will have to see in person to fully appreciate it's intricate detailed design and unbelievable sexy elegance.<br /><br />I honestly ordered this to make as an everyday wear and wear out soon bralette! I love the bralettes as they are very comfortable and breath. After trying it on I am putting this with my &#34; for my ME and Special feel good days about myself and more....&#34;<br /><br />I was a bit hesitant to order as it showed large size was 33 in band size. But I have black bra extenders and ordered anyway as I am a 38B. Guess what ? It fits without the bra extender!  Also it lifts the breast up a bit but not so much it looks like you did it on purpose !<br /><br />I am proud of this one and I could go on and on what I like about it . Like the back straps have that beautiful flower looking lace and petals. But honestly I love it and am so glad I found it !  I have no reason to lie and I hope you may have found this helpful ! ray333ray2001@yahoo.com"
5.0,"Killer fit, looks beautiful on me. I love it!!<br /><br />No cons. Fits as it should."
5.0,"So cute and comfortable! And warm! Fast shipping which was great, it came just in time for a snow storm. Recommend!"
5.0,Great replacement for that tacky rubber wrist band that comes with the Alta.  The video on band shortening makes it vary easy to get the length that best suits your wrist size.
5.0,"The white lining pokes out quite a bit so it isn’t ideal, but it looks to be the same as the photo. Very cute pattern, looks exactly like the photo other than the lining. It fit well, just material issues."
5.0,"This is an amazing swimsuit, so beautiful and great quality! I absolutely love the sugarskull pattern, it's vibrant and  gorgeous, has a real pin-up look, and it's not something you will come across on every corner. The sizing is true to standard, I got the size I normally wear and it fits me perfectly. The material is excellent quality (the other swimsuit I had of this quality cost at least 3 times this much...), and the whole swimsuit is lined (double layers of fabric), making sure it doesn't become see through at all even when wet. The style is very flattering as well, even if you have a bit of something extra here and there - I actually feel attractive wearing this! The swimsuit is not actual boy-leg though (as per the product description), but the bottom does cover a lot and does not ride up. The chest part for me is perfect (I wear a 38D in bras), but as it does not have a wired bra, it might not provide enough support for someone with larger breasts. I'm so so happy with this purchase and can only recommend.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for a fair and unbiased review."
5.0,"These stayed on nicely through the night but came off easier at the end of it than other pairs of similar items I've purchased. They weren't terribly painful to get off, I didn't have to stand under water for ages or just where them for a day or two. There was no weird sticky residue after."
5.0,It is so cute and it goes with everything.
5.0,"I have a pair Ive recently purchased in Hawaii and was very pleased with the comfort and style, so I decided to purchase a pair for my son. Unfortunately, I had to buy them a little big as it was the smallest size available.  He still LOVES them and wants to wear them all the time."
5.0,Love the products
5.0,"Fited well. Fit like women size 4 to 6. I am 5'2, wear a 34d bra. 126lbs. Wore to a presentation, received a fee compliments. Inexpensive, great buy."
5.0,Very pretty I ordered a 6 but it fit like a 4 1/2-5
5.0,these fit perfect and slim just what I wanted.
5.0,"I bought this for my daughter and she loved it so much we ordered a second one! She usually wears a 2 to 3 x.The first one we ordered in a 3x it fit just right but she prefers her shirts to be a little loose so we went with a 4 x the second round and it fits just like she likes. The material is very good quality and you can not feel the outside design on the inside. I am usually disappointed with clothes purchases on line,but not this time! I would totally buy this again! I did! Lol!"
5.0,"Wow! Love how these pants fit. A very nice material, not cheap at all. Great pants, great price. I’m ordering them in Navy now. FYI, I’m 5’3, 135ish and size medium fits like they were made for me."
5.0,I love all the different ways to use these excercise bands
5.0,"They hold up good, feel nice and look cute but if you have wider feet or more muscular calves you will need to size up. But overall they're pretty good shoes."

5.0,"I’m 5’6” and 140 pounds. I have a pear shaped body and a long torso. I have trouble buying tops because they are always too short. This waist shaper is amazing!! Truly gives you an hour glass shape and good posture! I initially bought a medium but it was a bit too snug. Bought a large and am so happy with it! Use the hooks that are most comfortable for you to move in, especially while sitting. I wear it all day, working out or not! I’m already seeing results and my self confidence is growing! I’ve already recommended this shaper to my long torsoed girlfriends! Don’t wait, give it a try!"

5.0,Was glad to find these
5.0,"I have purchased this brand in the past so was excited to see this larger bag. The only negative for me is the handle orientation,  would have preferred a t-shirt bag style handle as they are easier to put over your arm."
5.0,I work in a hospital nd i wanted to do something to bring some funny to wirk having to go thru 2 years of stressful covid. So this mask with a green irish durban was a huge huge hit. Had so many smiles and laughs even from patients. They loved it. Great mask. Gets a lil qarm to wear but its worth the smiles.
5.0,Love it 💗. Extremely comfortable and well made
5.0,Haven’t been shot in the face so I can’t attest to the ballistics but they fit my Oakley M frames. Perfect replacement for the stock ones.
5.0,Great Quality and a Great Price.  They work well with smart phones.
5.0,This is a cute and snappy looking case with lots of room and compartments. Also an area for taller bottles if needed.  It folds nicely for storage in a suit case or can be hung for easy access.  Love it!
5.0,The best slippers ever. Like walking on air. Highly recommend.
5.0,"The glasses are comfortable to wear over my prescription eye glasses. Glasses are helpful for night driving, especially in the rain."
5.0,I made masks from the cloth
5.0,The watch is very comfortable and durable. It lives up to the sellers description completely. If style is important to you I personally believe that it goes with and complements most standard outfits for men. I believe it's at a great price too for it's durability and functionality.
5.0,Fit is great and length is perfect
5.0,It’s perfect But I haven’t washed it yet. The weight is nice not too heave or too light. You can wear it alone or under another top. It’s nice and soft. If it laundry’s well I’ll give it a 2 thumbs up
5.0,My husband wanted this shirt for golf. He loves it.
5.0,"These are actually much nicer quality than I was expecting for the price. Each pair comes in a little plastic bag with two plastic stoppers (the things you use to keep the earrings from coming out, as all are French hook). All of them are in a nice velveteen bag, which I will use to store them。I want these to wear for Halloween.Met expectatons！"

5.0,I love them!!! Super fast delivery. The bands are so beautiful and comfortable:)
5.0,"Worked just fine,  laced & tied. What more could a person ask for!"
5.0,Nomad always makes really quality straps and this one is no exception. It’s well built and sturdy and looks classy. My only complaint is the price. I dont think it’s overpriced per say for it’s a nomad product I just think it’s overpriced for what it actually is...... a watch band. But I think it’s a better alternative to apple’s leather bands and some other brands.
5.0,These are a stocking stuffer for my daughter who refuses to pierce her ears!! 😂 They are super cute and look as colorful as the picture!
5.0,Great fit! Extremely comfortable!
5.0,My grandson loves the shirt almost as much as he loves the game! It looks great even after washing.

5.0,Just perfect want another in size 7
5.0,I love tea and this is the most unique necklace. Get lots of compliments. Goes with dressy or casual. And I love how it looks.
5.0,"Product review for Eyekepper Computer Readers Titanium Memory Bridge Spring Hinges Oval Computer Reading Glasses Gunmetal: I'm relatively new to needing readers but have worked with/on computers for 16+ years. These make a difference! The frames are comfortable and look great, even if the glasses themselves feel a little front-heavy. The lenses do have a slight tint (thus blocking the blue light) but, frankly, I find it causes most other colors to pop more and details to stand out better."
5.0,"I suspect these are perfectly fine for hockey, but I am using them to raise my TV up an inch.  They work and look great!"
5.0,"Beautiful dress, quality is very good it’s lightweight. I work for an event and receive lotta compliments. It can be dressed up or dressed down."
5.0,"It's all in the title. Seriously though, it's the nice soft cotton which us ladies love!"

5.0,"Wearing if finally chilly enough to wear, I bought it in the summer and have been waiting a few months to wear it"
5.0,Beautiful dress and amazing quality. Should cost twice as much. Love the dress and fits true to size
5.0,I just wish they had my size in all colors :(  glad I got this one :)
5.0,muy práctico
5.0,"Bought theses for myself, not my kids. Does a great job for laps in the pool"
5.0,"This dress fits perfectly. It's professional and sexy at the same time. I am 5 1"" and 120 lbs and the dress fit well, it was not too tight, it just fit close and work appropriate."
5.0,"Just what I was looking for in a boot. I had a pair of Sporto boots for a number of years and wanted to replace them with similar qualities, warmth and comfort. I went to a couple of local stores but found nothing. I am skeptical ordering online but when I found these boots by Sporto, I decided to give them a try. I am happy that I did! They are warm and fit perfectly. I am a size 9. They have a stylish look along with good traction in the snow. I would definitely recommend them."
5.0,"Perfect winter hat. Soft, sturdy, and keeps the sun off of the face."
5.0,"It is easy to place pictures into this wallet insert.  It holds 12 pictures, or 24 back to back."

5.0,Stepdaughter loves it. Decent material.
5.0,The glasses work great

5.0,One of the most comfortable pair of jeans I own.
5.0,I purchased this purse because it was blue..  But I received it and was in love. It is a perfect size with great pockets. A full size wallet fit into it with ease. I really love the handle and the shoulder strap is a bonus. They are comfortable. So you can carry as a purse or as a hands free cross body bag. It really is perfect.
5.0,Purchased to leave in my classroom for students who need them during recess.
5.0,"I ordered it in XL and I knew it was gonna be comfortable and the expectations were great, I think I’m gonna order another one but now it’s only letting me order large?"
5.0,"It fits my kids' heads fine (and since I bought it for my 11-year-old son, that's all we needed) but I don't think it should really be advertised as a men's hat, as it's a little too small for a full-grown man. The pin on the front comes out easily, but can be stuck back in. The brim is green on the underside, which doesn't look very authentic, but otherwise, it's a really nicely made hat."
5.0,they fit good and don't slide out of his feet. the elastic still not to tight and is good because don't cut circulation...
5.0,"Very nice quality, excited to give my daughter this for our dog we lost!"
5.0,Custom designed to fit with my Halloween costume. Came out perfect! I can also wear it year round. LGB!

5.0,"Fun, unique gift and item."
5.0,Good looking at a great price.  Latch is a little large for pendant use.
5.0,"I love with shirt. It is super airy and comfortable. I will be buying more of these because they are some of the best cute athletic tops I own. If it's windy, the back does open up, so if you're afraid of showing your lower back, then I wouldn't recommend it, but I think it's perfect."
5.0,"This dress is perfect! Good quality fabric, fits great, exactly as pictured. I will be ordering in different colors."
5.0,They shipped quickly. My 3 year old son loves them and will keep them on the entire time at the track. Great price!
5.0,Has the look and feel of exactly what I was expecting. I'm tempted to buy another one as a backup.
5.0,I switched to these from Balegas as an experiment. I loved my Balegas but I was still getting blisters on long runs. I switched to the Drymax and no more blisters. They're light enough I was able to wear them on my runs in the Texas summer and still be comfortable. Fits my small feet perfectly. I've bought several more pairs.
5.0,Loved these! I get so many compliments every time I wear them.
5.0,Casual lounge wear. Could be a little softer

5.0,Keepons went on to my glasses very easily. Within a few minutes I did not feel them at all and my glasses stayed perfectly in place. I would definitely buy them again.
5.0,"I bought these leggings in the lavender camo print.  I've worn them 3 times since they arrived, and am wearing them right now with a big grey sweatshirt.  They are extremely comfy.  Interestingly, they are ribbed, like certain kinds of tights, not leggings.  Sewn kind of like a sweater, if that makes sense.  The high waist fits a few inches below the breasts, and keeps your tummy taut.  The tiny little stitching in the a$$ crack makes your butt look fantastic, since it cinches in and makes your cheeks look round and smooth.  I'm a size 6 and bought this in Med.  They fit perfectly.  A++"
5.0,"I got this shirt mainly to embarrass my wife on Valentine's day (and any other day really). Can you imagine the possibilities?<br /><br />Me:  What was that honey? I'was cleaning the gutters like you asked me to last year.<br />Wife:  (sounds similar to those that Charlie Brown's teacher)<br />Me:  Did you just say you just gave birth to a baby flower? What kind was it?<br />Wife:  (more sounds like those made by Charlie Brown's teacher)<br />Me: Oh, you've got a baby shower to go to.<br />Wife:  (more sounds)<br />Me:  So let me get this straight, I'll be going too? Me? I, will need to go to your boss' baby shower on Super Bowl Sunday, you say? You mean, the one I've never met who makes you do her work for her while she takes all the credit and go bobbing for soiled diapers while I'm there?<br />Wife:  Ummm, yeah. You like living right?<br />Me:  Of course I do, I've never taken breathing for granted. Anyways, it sounds like a ton of fun. I can't wait. I know exactly what I'm going to wear.<br /><br />This shirt is hilarious and comfortable. I read in another review that this was an Anvil shirt, so I knew that it would fit similarly to an American Apparel shirt with just a little more forgiveness. Being a little less than 6' tall, with a muscular build at 180lbs, the Large fit perfectly. I'm very happy with it and I know my wife is going to get a kick out of it. In fact she's got a &#34;in the mood&#34; pair of shorts she likes wearing, so I think I just found my t-shirt version of that.... just a little less subtle.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
5.0,"As described, this scarf is made of soft material and it feel super soft on the skin. I ordered the pink one and it’s absolutly beautiful."
5.0,The outfit is adorable on! I felt it was very well made and fit perfectly! I ordered two and they arrived with no staining and securely packaged.
5.0,"Fits great!!! Haven't worn it yet,  but I know what I will wear it with. It's the exact perk-me-up for the non-descripted ensemble it was purchased for."
5.0,This has been a great basic chain for layering with other necklaces.  The style is very basic so it really coordinates well with almost any other necklace.  It's also been very useful when I wanted to wear random pendants that don't already have a chain.  This chain has had a LOT of use!
5.0,I needed something that wouldn't show with heels and flats. These are perfect and don't fall off my feet! They cover all the necessary parts of my foot.
5.0,Pretty well made and good looking. Worked well for our dance. The only suggestion - it could be a tiny bit wider at the bottom for better effect.
5.0,"VERY DELICATE AND PRETTY. ONLY THING I WORRY ABOUT IS A PARAMEDIC WOULD NEVER LOOK AT THE BRACELET, AS IT LOOKS LIKE A PIECE OF JEWELRY. NEEDS A MEDIC ALERT CHARM ALSO!"
5.0,"This is the second time I’ve ordered these and I love them! The colors are vibrant and pretty. Also, they are well made! I will but again!"
5.0,It fit big but I was hoping it would fit big so that my baby can grow into it. It was so comfortable for her. It fit perfect from the top and it was a bit long but didn’t mind too much .
5.0,I WEAR A SMALL AND IT FIT WELL.
5.0,Perfect sizes for your suitcase.  Leaves everything organized.
5.0,"I was a bridesmaid at my sisters wedding at a golf course, the owners were worried about the green so I got these for myself and the rest of the wedding party and they worked perfectly."
5.0,I was very pleased with product would recommend this bag to others
5.0,"Looks great (definitely belies the cost) and is very well-made.  The watch band is quite comfortable and feels expensive -- and is not embossed with that ubiquitous phony croco pattern.  The second keeper even has a stitch in it.  Does not overwhelm my small wrist, for which I prefer a 38mm.  And BTW, contrary to another review, the second hand hits the markers.  Personally, I think it would be dressy enough for work with a suit and/or dress shirt."
5.0,These are the best underwear (per my husband). Great quality and supportive fit
5.0,Xmas gift. Happy with cap. Arrived in a timely manner.
5.0,"very comfortable, can see the road very clear at night."
5.0,"Great item, have used it in a few rainstorms now. Has held up well so far. Need to watch the high winds if not tied down properly. Over all I like it as it leaves my hands free to do other stuff, (IE: fishing, dog walking, using binoculars at sporting event, etc., ,  ,) and that really helps. Construction seems fine as no problems have occurred yet."
5.0,Accessorizes my coat perfectly.
5.0,"As others have stated, it is very lightweight.  This is perfect for cool but not cold weather.<br />Very useful for someone easily overheated but should have something on their head.<br />My child plans on wearing this anytime of the year- on bad hair days."
5.0,"This dress is ABSOLUTELY beautiful!!!  It fits perfectly.  I wore this dress out with my husband for our first anniversary, and he loved it, too.  I will be purchase this dress again in a different color."
5.0,Its a great ring I am very happy with it
5.0,"They're excellent slippers, especially for the price. No complaints whatsoever."
5.0,I am so pleased with this necklace.  During these crazy times in this world it is good to remind yourself everyday with  inspiring and reassuring words from the Bible.  I bought this necklace for myself as a birthday present.  I couldn't be happier with the quality.  Fast shipping also!!  What means a lot to me is it arrived the day I received my first COVID shot.  Couldn't be a better time to Fear No Evil.
5.0,It's perfect! It's cute and doesn't get caught in my hair. I wear on the top of my ear cartilage. It's very well made. I'm in love with it.
5.0,I wanted a loose fitting cardigan and this style had various colors so I bought 3.<br />I would recommend for anyone who doesn't like heavy cardigans.
5.0,Huge fan! Super cute and came very fast. Highly recommend. Thank you!
5.0,"I just received these slippers a few days ago. I love them, very comfortable!"
5.0,Wore these hats while ringing the bell for the Salvation Army. Just about everyone commented on them saying how awesome they were! Definitely got some donations just because of the hats. Very fun!
5.0,"This particular one was ok, and I like it."
5.0,"Very pretty scarf, good quality."
5.0,Very comfortable and cute knit sweater
5.0,It was for someone else looked ok
5.0,"I bought these for my daughter and not only did she love the color and design, they fit her incredibly! Definitely a worthy buy. Very durable too for as active as she is."
5.0,"Considering the price of these boots I was very skeptical of purchasing them, however with all the good reviews I decided to take a chance.  I'm so glad I did!  They look like $150 boots!  They look exactly as pictured and fit my not so skinny calves perfectly as well.  My only complaint is they are a little big so my next pair I will def be ordering a half size smaller"
5.0,Love this shirt! It is super cute.
5.0,"This may be the BEST purchase I've ever made on Amazon. This dress is SPECTACULAR! I purchased for my best friend's rehearsal dinner...and I received more compliments than I can count. It fit PERFECTLY, the color is on point and the price was just ridiculously awesome! I'm actively seeking out events just so I can wear this dress as many times as possible!"
5.0,I use it with my Parelli ropes
5.0,"I LOVE this shirt! Fits beautifully, very becoming and flattering! I’m going to get two more in different colors!!"
5.0,Great product thank you very much for a great buy. I would surely recommend this product to a friend. Works great!
5.0,"Yes, I know you can tell time these days easily on your cell phone, but my cell phone is usually in the bottom of my purse and not easy to retrieve.  Hanging this little watch on the side of my purse is perfect!  I can easily check the time while running errands, without wearing a watch.  Keeps perfect time too!"
5.0,"Nice colors, very comfortable and well made"
5.0,Good item and great buy.
5.0,"These pants are so soft and comfy!  I ordered a large because I’m between Med & Lg and I didn’t want them to fit too tight, like spandex. But this fit is perfect!"
5.0,Great quality scarves. Super silky so if you’re using for your hair it tends to slip off easily. Colors are vibrant.
5.0,Fashionable (if you like sparkles); nice deep/rich colors; fabric is thick and the face mask does not rest on your mouth making it easy to breathe and wear for an extended period of time
5.0,I can’t say enough good things about this shirt. Fits great. Sleeves are long enough. Flattering cut.
5.0,"Purchases the blue sleeves for my pre teen and the red sleeves for myself. They were scheduled to arrive next Wednesday, but arrived today (Sunday). The material is super soft and fits perfectly! I will be looking for more shirts from this company! (Review by Jessica, Michael’s wife)"
5.0,Love love love. Comfortable. Sustainable. Does not fall off or slip.
5.0,"Bellisimo, sencillo y elegante, perfecto para un evento"
5.0,"Purchased as a gift, the recipient loves it so I do too."
5.0,"Obviously you may see a few copycats! But who cares, it’s cute and a decent price. Had a blast and looked cute doing it. Definitely a solid buy."
5.0,These are adorable. So cute. They're well made.
5.0,"This bracelet is even more beautiful than it looks in the picture, flawless, shines like a mirror.  Has a tiny &#34;sterling&#34; stamp on the inside.  I ordered it as a gift and it came in a nice, little white cardboard box with cotton inside which I wrapped."
5.0,"I purchased a medium and the length is perfect, the top is a little large around the armpits but I think the small would be too short for me so I’m going to take it in myself just so it’s a little more snug around my arms."
5.0,My son just turned 6 and is on the slim side. These fit his face perfectly and I think they will for awhile. He reports that they are comfortable on his nose and behind his ears. He loves the little storage bag it comes with. Great deal!
5.0,"Price is great, its a cute, warm skirt, the only thing I will say is that the pockets aren't the same size, and are made for small hands. Great winter skirt overall."
5.0,"Super comfy, and it hides the belly!"
5.0,They are very smart looking and I just  love them.
5.0,Bought these to share with granddaughters and to give to friends as little happys.  These nice pins also make a great decorative addition to Christmas bows.
5.0,I ordered this dress in size 26 because I am large and lovely. The fabric was amazingly light and flowing. This dress was beautifully manufactured and well worth the price! It looks exactly like the photo and is very feminine. The back is adjustable and that makes it fit quite nicely. I love this dress and I will definitely order from this seller again.
5.0,"I purchased the gold and pink. Love them both. Love that the glitter is inside and not on the surface. Very soft and comfortable. I had purchased a light blue and a white one from another company for the Samsung Active 2 and loved them, but had to return the watch. I would love to see you come out with more colors."
5.0,"Really nice belt, good quality, i like it!"
5.0,"Great sweater dress, very soft and comfortable."
5.0,Light and handsome.
5.0,"Awesome, but I can't find many occasions to wear it."
5.0,Really nice. Very happy with purchase
5.0,"I ordered a large since God chose to gift me in the chest area.  T-shirts purchased online are a little sketchy with sizing so I sized up just in case.  It's cute, a little roomy, but still flattering.  I could tie or knot it if I wanted but I usually just tuck in the front of my jeans.  Get lots of smirks and ""I like your shirt"" when I wear it.  Could've ordered a medium and been fine.  For reference, I'm 5'2, graced in the bosom area, and fluctuate between 140-160 depending on how much fast food I consume in a few-month period while ignoring the gym.  It's not super soft but not stiff aka it doesn't feel cheap.  The cuffed arms is a cute detail too and also oddly flattering since I tend to think I have fat arms.  If you're on the fence, I say TREAT YO SELF and get it."
5.0,Good quality. Love the style.
5.0,it looks great ! and has  a lot of compartment.  so far so good .  only had it two weeks
5.0,This was a present and was a hit!
5.0,Lovely ring I get many compliments .
5.0,"Exactly as pictured, very comfortable"
5.0,Light weight and accurate.
5.0,Fits perfect and very pretty! I love the pockets too!
5.0,Very elegant...I am a big Betty Boop fan...I will definitely be shopping for more...I love my bracelet...
5.0,Great collar clamps. Came a long way with these from every workout sessions. Very durable
5.0,Okay for the price it gets the job done.  I have another one that is almost twice the price.  This one is easily comparable to a more expensive product.  Don't be fooled by the price.  The inserts help keep it up without slipping down.  It does run a bit small so it may be a good idea to get a size larger than normal.
5.0,Looks great and fits since we went a couple sizes bigger.  My 15 year old normally wares a large.  We read some of the other review and went with an XX-Large just to be on the safe side and fits great.  Thanks :-)
5.0,The warmest thing I’ve ever bought.
5.0,I bought two of these rings.. they are sturdy and nicely made. I am happy with my purchase. Little on the thick side but not a problem if you don't mind that.
5.0,"This dress made me so happy. As a Christmas dress, add a red belt & shoes. It looked fabulous.<br />Good fabric, design & craftsmanship"
5.0,Super cute scarf and it came really quickly . I love it and it is perfect for valentines day!
5.0,Person loves! Uses it for snowboarding and shoveling!
5.0,I loved this dress. It fit me perfectly. Love the material. The length was perfect. I may purchase it in other colors-
5.0,Look even better than in this picture. Great bracelet!
5.0,😍😍👍👍👍
5.0,Very nice and very quick shipping
5.0,"I just got these yesterday and I love them. I really just wanted the black ones but I'm happy I got all the colors for backup in case I lose one. It's a really great deal to get all these pairs for the price. I can't really speak to their diameter because I lost one of my previous plugs and went about a week without anything so my holes shrunk in the meantime. I do love their length though. I have tiny, thin earlobes and I usually have a problem with plugs flopping around, sliding back and forth because they are way too long. These are perfect. They stay put and don't stick out too far."
5.0,"Great shorts for a great price, very satisfied with this purchase"
5.0,Got this for my son as his first wallet. He loves it.
5.0,"These laces are good quality and I would buy them again.  They replaced the old laces in my boots, and are prabably better than the old ones too."
5.0,"Cute socks! Great quality, nothing else needs to be said!"
5.0,Love the fit of this sandal!  So many compliments on the availability of the bottle opener on the bottom of this flip!
5.0,These shirts feel great and even motivate me too workout more.
5.0,Fun and funky got lots of compliments when I wore them on vacation in Mexico. Also beat to have something different that not everyone else was wearing
5.0,Todo quedó bien
5.0,It has met all my expectations. I love it!
5.0,Nice shoes .
5.0,"My daughter loved them, somewhat cheese but hey for the price and for the fun she got from them will worth it."
5.0,I have been looking for this style for long time. very good looking and  stay on a head well. I can play pickleball and golf and they stay well. It has adjustable string inside so good for all size of the head. I am going to buy another one as back up. I just bought similer style of panama hat  and I paid appx $90. This one is only $20 and better looking.
5.0,I like the classic pattern.  The material is  not high quality but good for the price.  Happy with the purchase.  Would recommend.
5.0,"It is exactly as the picture!<br /><br />Gorgeous, elegant, and just perfect! :)<br /><br />A must buy!! :)<br /><br />Very happy :)<br /><br />Very soft :)"
5.0,So comfy!! Love it!
5.0,My daughter loves them. Good quality.

5.0,"Very nice piece, a bit smaller than I expected but my wife loves it. It sparkles beautifully in any light."

5.0,Soft and true to size.
5.0,They came three days early. She love em
5.0,Great and just the right size and easy to use.
5.0,Just what my Daughter-in law wanted!!
5.0,I purchased these bras for my daughter. They are a perfect fit and give her the support she needs. The bras are modest enough for a young teen with enough coverage.
5.0,My son likes this set - love that it comes with matching shorts
5.0,These were a gift for a friend. They were adorable and perfect. She loved them. They seem super sturdy and well made.
5.0,"Awesome quality, really shines."

5.0,Very Pretty !!
5.0,Love this dress. The color and fit look just like the picture. It's so comfortable and soft. Love that the sleeves are not too short on me like they usually are. Wish it came in more colors!
5.0,Fits the Noggin Nicely! ... Went to visit my dad the other day and he stole mine so I had to buy another identical. I highly recommend this hat
5.0,Works well for UV protection. I can now aviod all the sun  products that stain my shirts. I intend to buy more of this item.
5.0,Coolibar rarely disappoints. Comfortable and most important sun protective. I now own several pairs.
5.0,Got the watch band with the tool it was 10 min<br />With the swap and people at work notice right away<br />I love it
5.0,I ordered these for a birthday party for an 8 year old. They loved them! They fit a 5 year old up to an adult fine. They were cute and creepy at the same time. Good quality.  None of the strings broke and it was a trampoline party! I would definitely purchase again.
5.0,Super soft. Hand Wash alone./ hang to dry.
5.0,Exactly as described and very cute. Fits well and doesn’t show any undergarments.
5.0,"Used this on a trip oversees. It worked for me very well. My cellphone, 2 passports, credit card, picture id, money, lip gloss and other small items fit in it. I was impressed."
5.0,This was perfect for the holidays to add a little sparkle..
5.0,This product looks nice and suitable for everybody.
5.0,"My boyfriend is actually an Amazon delivery driver 😂 he needed something to go under his work shirt but keep him warm during the colder days. He wanted something that was thick, but didn’t cost $30+ like in stores.<br /><br />He wore it the day it was delivered, and he was so impressed! He loved the fit of it, and he couldn’t get over the quality! It’s so soft, and you can tell it’s a higher quality than the cheaper options (obviously, but just wanted to note). He actually wants to get another one!"
5.0,Wonderful! Solid quality!
5.0,"It arrived way earlier than expected! Good quality, fits as expected, and it's adorable. Bought for my 2 year old for pictures to announce we're expecting baby #2!"
5.0,"I was shocked that this dress fit so well after reading the reviews. I am 5'9 size 9, I purchased an xlarge. I really like it"
5.0,"My husband loves these white shirts for tennis in Florida. They are very affordable and durable. Eventually the suntan lotion stain does not come out of the white, but for that price it does not matter."
5.0,I like that they stretch to fit. Pretty color.
5.0,Everywhere I go I get compliments about the flannel shirt
5.0,"These are super cute and guess what, when you attach something to the back with super glue, it doesn't bleed through the design and mess it up! I make needle minders with these :)"
5.0,"Lovely locket (ordered 2) for a gift for two grand daughters who lost their grandma.  Nice quality and packaged nice!  Only wish they included a sample template for the picture, but I figured it out."
5.0,"Love love love these. They fit great, I'm 5'5&#34; and 180lbs ish. They're as soft as Lularoe and so much more affordable.."
5.0,Frees the shoulders
5.0,Las amé
5.0,"I can't wear the traditional plastic watch bands. The material makes me break out. This fabric option is exactly what I needed. Adjustable, comfortable, and doesn't slip or loosen throughout the day."
5.0,T-2000 (his name apparently) was just what I needed to add something cute to my bag!
5.0,"My 13 year old son ordered this to be funny  to be “Fox in Socks” for Dr Seuss week at school. He said it was uncomfortably droopy in the crotch, but It was fine for a day. He liked the costume, but would never wear it as comfy pajamas around the house. For the money it was fine, but would have been nice it it were comfortable to wear more often."
5.0,Got this for my 12 year old for Christmas. She loves it and wears it every day!
5.0,I love this base layer. Fits great. Seems to be of high quality so far.
5.0,This bracelet is even more beautiful than depicted. A photo does not do it justice. I love it and would not hesitate to buy from this seller again. This is a fine piece that carries an affordable price.
5.0,Such a great bag at a good price. I bought this to use for work and it works perfectly. I carry my laptop and a couple of other stuff in this bag so it's quite heavy but it has held perfectly fine for about 8 months now. It still looks new. Great quality.
5.0,Great for night driving. Eliminates the bright light
5.0,the dress fit fine but the straps are crazy long - had to alter but the dress was a hit!
5.0,"Brilliant! Incredibly flattering leather-look leggings. Worn several times, washed twice, no sign of creasing or wear. The waistband is comfortable and doesn't cause any muffin-top issues. The leggings make your legs look insanely good - to the point that I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing them anywhere but a party! It looks like your legs have been covered in a poured matte oil, or something (I see girls wearing leather leggings around town and I always admire them)<br /><br />The only reason I don't wear these more often now is that we've got extremely cold winters here, and these are really, really thin. As in, they are less warm than a pair of tights. I don't know how that works, but these really aren't made for temps below about 50 degrees."
5.0,I absolutely love this necklace!! The color is just like in the picture and it is a great fashion piece.
5.0,"This fits as indicated and had a reasonable price.  However, it was in a shrink-wrapped plastic.  So, it may need a little fluff from the dryer to gain its fuzzy texture."
5.0,Beautiful color.  Fits well.
5.0,Great product! Thank you.
5.0,"These earrings are so beautiful and elegant, very nice quality"
5.0,"Very happy that I finally ordered this set of watch bands for my Samsung galaxy. As much as I liked the dusty rose silicone band which came with the watch, it was boring and not very comfortable.<br /><br />  These stretchy fabric bands are just a sliver or so wider than the silicone, and that's ok by me. The fit is infinitely adjustable because of the elastic. With the manufacturers silicone band I was unable to get a comfortable fit, one notch was too tight and the next was too loose. I'm not a small girl, by any means, and it's nice to find an option that's cute and fits with ease.<br /><br /> Installation was a breeze. Just slide the spring tension quick release pin towards the center of the watch, pop the other end in, then release the pin and pop that  end in. Ok, I admit, YouTube helped because this was my first band change of this kind. Sooo much easier than the old school bands where you needed to be nothing short of a micro surgeon or explosives tech to get those stupid little slide pins to actually slide.<br /><br />  The connection parts and loop adjustment are a pretty durable feeling black plastic. The colors are vibrant, with a nice quality to the fabric. For the price point, I am very pleased. I'm very happy that I didn't opt for a set of silicone bands in multiple solid colors. (yawn)<br /><br />  Give these a try if you're looking for comfort, a splash of bohemian styling, and something to make you smile as you glance at your outrageously priced timepiece."
5.0,"Exactly as shown! Wonderful price. Leather band was very stiff when I got it, but I worked with it and It loosened up. Love it!"
5.0,"These are great pants, they fit good and feel good on. Nice deep pockets with a small pocket inside the right<br />hand pocket for keys or something small. Bought the first pair, liked them so well, ordered another pair."
5.0,Absolutely love!!!!
5.0,"YES GET THIS. I literally have no complaints I love everything about it! Makes your butt look great without it being super over the top cheeky. I’m getting it in every color. I got a small, I’m 5’6 120 pounds and wear a 4, fits perfect."
5.0,Good for activities like Zumba.
5.0,I love this bag. Just right size - sturdy and love the pink!! Thank you
5.0,Great Quality... Excellent example of alternative culture dress<br /># hippieswag
5.0,"Super comfy. Sooooo cute. Feels like Lulu material. Still breathes. My 5 y/o wears them under her dresses. She wears a 5T in clothing. We used to get into HUGE fights over wearing shorts or bloomers under dresses and rompers every morning. These immediately solved the problem. Now she wears them even if she’s not wearing a dress (with jeans, shorts, and everything else.) LOVE!! Ordering two more sets right now."
5.0,Very nice & well made. My husband is quite happy with them.
5.0,Need to get more!!!
5.0,Got here in Great time... will look awesome for halloween this year. Cant beat the price....
5.0,I would wear this every day if I could! Shirt length is mid-thigh and looks great with jeans! It is lightweight and covers my nursing baby well without making her hot.
5.0,I have been wearing this non stop since I got it!! So cute and the quilted look adds a cute little flare to it!
5.0,El juego de mascarillas y amarres es la mancuerna perfecta. No pesan ni hacen bulto. Me encantaron.
5.0,"Soft, versatile. Will be used as a petticoat and a skirt"
5.0,I bought this for my Granddaughters birthday and gave it to her one month ahead of time.  She couldn’t wait to wear it on the big day.<br />It is well made and of good quality.
5.0,"Granddaughter lived this. We didn't use it as a Halloween costume, we use it for play dress up! She loves it...wears it almost everyday to play.. great material cuz it still looks great and we have washed it more times than we can count!"
5.0,"I bought a large size and it had a nice fit. Waist area had good room, not tight. Work appropriate and length was just slightly below the knees. There was some sewing issues shown in picture but not noticable when worn. I can sew it if seams come undone, but other than that I'd buy it again.<br /><br />C cup<br />Bust 38 inches<br />Waist 34<br />Height 5'3<br />Weight 160"
5.0,My mom in law to be loved it and will wear it at my wedding in September!
5.0,"Very cute, eye-catching and inexpensive. Arrived after a week. I can't wait to wear it. I would buy another to wear in the other ear at the same time."
5.0,Exactly as described. I love it!!!!
5.0,Love it—just as described
5.0,"This is perfect for the pool, lounging in the back yard or the living room. Nice and long."
5.0,"I love this dress! I bought it in blue for a NYE party. It is beautiful! It does fit a little loose but that is the style of the dress. Also I appreciate the fit because the beading is very delicate and would not stretch well. I selected this dress after about an hour of searching because most that I saw were very short. This dress is long, beautiful, and flattering even for my pear shaped body. Very pleased with this purchase and may buy more colors in the future."
5.0,Beautiful beyond the picture proof! Delicate and gracefully elegant!

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:d4af12f4e727a63a998a2c01364f426b]] Things that I liked:<br />It is bright, almost blindingly so. I never have to worry about people not seeing me on my bike<br />Very light weight and thin (good as a top layer)<br />Good amount of pockets<br /><br />Things I don't like:<br />If you are sweating at all and your skin comes in contact with the jacket it will stick and feel like you are wearing a plastic bag. Always wear a long-sleeved layer underneath if you are going to be sweating."
5.0,"Love it, awesome dress"
5.0,LOVE EM!!! Just perfect. Buy now. DONT HESITATE.
5.0,I really like his little sweat jacket fit is great and warm very soft

5.0,"This product was purchased as a gift for my 74 year old father.  He is from the old school where men always carried a cotton handkerchiefs.  Unfortunately, they're harder to find these days.  My father was extremely happy with the gift and says they're just the right size and he loves the soft cotton."
5.0,This was a good and she loved it.
5.0,I listened to all other reviews and sized up. I also posted a question and most answers I got was to size up. I usually wear a 4 so I got the 4.5 instead and I'm glad I did. I love these shoes the leather is extremely soft and the shoe is very well made and looks even much better than the picture. The heel is comfy and not too high. The fit is great but I would highly recommend to size up since it is not the issue with the length but rather that the shoe is narrow. If i got the 4 they might have fitted length wise but I think the issue would be with the width. For the price and this being a Vince camuto I'm in love with this shoe.
5.0,i got this as i play as D.va at times and these looked good to me and i already wear Tracer leggings but it certainly nice to have these and would recommend any d.va fan and or mains...i even continue to buy these as replacements to ones that worn out

5.0,"living in Minnesota, we get a lot of cold weather.  from running the snowblower to shoveling, to cleaning off my truck in the morning when its below zero, i am happy with the comfort and warmth of these gloves !!!!"
5.0,Awesome fit..great material
5.0,"Love this hat! Light and very comfortable. I finally found a hat I like and look good in that wasn't a ball cap.  And I have to say, I look much better in it than the photo they have here. :)"
5.0,"Usually wear a size 14 in shirts, usually an XL. Saw that previous buyers had said item ran small so I ordered an 3X and it fit perfectly. Very satisfied with the outcome. If you are looking to buy this shirt order up! Very happy with the shirt though!"

5.0,"I purchased this necklace with the hopes that the negative ions would help negate some of the radiation from electronic devices. I am not sure if this necklace has improved my balance, but I have noticed less upper back pain since I started wearing it. If nothing else, it does give me peace of mind that I am reducing my radiation exposure levels."
5.0,Super cute & the jingle wasn’t obnoxious. I was able to wear them all day at work several times without it being aggravating.
5.0,Item  ordered met expectations
5.0,"I bought the XL for my daughter who is 5'2&#34; and has a 32DD bust.  She wears a size 8 pant and the xl fit her in the bust. It is a bit roomy in the waist, but because of the polka dots, it just looks like ruching.  It is a simple serged edge on the sides, so it will be easy to take in, if she feels it needs it.  The neck tie, which is adjustable, is rather thin and she felt like it was cutting a bit into the back of her neck. We can always put another bathing suit's strap on it for her or she can wear it without the strap. The back tie is really easy to clasp and the tension holds it closed.  She would have liked the back strap to be adjustable, but a simple snip and re-sew of the clasp attachment will fit it right up.  She is usually a size Medium in USA made clothing, but reading the size chart, I knew I had to order up.  See from the pictures how it fits her, without the padding in the cups.  We took them out, as she is in no need of extra junk on the front :)  It doesn't come up very high on the legs and covers her backside completely.<br />All in all, a very pretty suit, modest and fun colors!<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I have personally used the product and tried my best to reflect my experience with the product so you can make a more informed purchasing decision. Hopefully my review includes the information you would want to know before ordering. If you’ve found it helpful let me know by using the buttons Amazon has provided below."

5.0,Product is comfortable & fits great...
5.0,"These are really pretty! Blue stones are dark enough, but not too dark. Clear stones very sparkly.  Size is just right, not petite but not huge either.  The workmanship is very good.  They look far more expensive than they are.  I'm very pleased with this purchase."

5.0,"This was a great buy and love wearing these while riding my Harley, working in the yard or hanging outdoors.  Been shaving my head for over 25 years and need something that is cool and lightweight.  Not sure how much the UV protection rating is but it sure makes a difference and no fried crown while wearing these yet.  And I even lounge around the water as they are a comfort while in the pool,  Why spend $25-30 for a Buff or Harley band when you can get several for yourself and gifts for a few friends here for a fraction of the cost."
5.0,"As a mail carrier I have the challenge of having to read small print in sunny conditions. I can't switch between readers and sunglasses constantly while on the road. I found that the Bora sunglasses were a perfect solution. I tried other bifocal sunglasses from the drug store, but they were flimsy and gave a weird distortion when walking. I notice a big difference with these glasses. Firstly the bifocal is nearly invisible. I don't notice the bifocal line which caused blurred vision in other glasses. I like the glass shade it is a smoke grey not so dark that I can't see indoors. I can see better with the Bora sunglasses.  I did not have to adjust what I was reading to be able to see.  I could pretty much look at it normally and be able to read it. No more find the &#34;sweet spot&#34; when trying to read.  The glasses are sturdy and well made. They fit snugly I like the spring hinge. No more constantly putting my glasses back in place. I love them so much I will probably but a second pair just in case I lose them."
5.0,The item came in time & my expectations were met.
5.0,"I’m usually somewhat sensitive to metals/belly button rings but these have worked out great! Authentic, not cheaply made and look just like the picture."

5.0,These were a gift for my sister and she loved them.  She get compliments at work all the time and everyone wanted to buy their own!
5.0,Beautiful dress but did not fit since the top part of it is made very large. If you are a tall and bigger girl then it will fit but standard and small frames won't
5.0,"Perfectly what I was looking for. I love the way square cut undershirts feel. Much more comfortable than traditional round cut. This is my second time ordering these, got them in black before, grey this time. They're a light Heather grey. Very happy, Thanks!"
5.0,Fantastic. Love them!
5.0,"These Pjs are the cutest, fit well with room, so soft! Great quality!"

5.0,My grandson loved them he plays soccer and needed the shin guards they worked just fine...
5.0,My son loves his new sunglasses. They are very comfortable and block out the sun well. He is a life guard so he knows how important it is to protect your eyes from UV rays
5.0,"Excellent deal, fit as expected.  Great Christmas present, sparkle like the real thing."
5.0,"This is much nicer than I was expecting. It came packaged securely in a cute little box, completely undamaged and ready to wear. Even the chain is nice!"
5.0,"[[ASIN:B017RYVO7E Finish It! Gear - Made in the USA - Women's Ponytail Headband with Double Fleece Sewn into Ear Area for Extra Warmth. Perfect Running Headband Ear Warmer for Winter Weather, Super Moisture Wicking]]<br /><br />I'm trying to lose weight and get fit. As everyone knows, trying to get your steps/run in during the winter can be frigid. If you are looking for the perfect solution, here it is! An earwarmer/headband with a spot for your ponytail.<br /><br />I always have problems with this type of earwarmer - They slip around, especially if you have your hair up. But this solves the problem - the ponytail secures the headband in place, and you are good to go!<br /><br />The material is absorbent and warm. The ponytail will need to be low though to position the headband properly over your ears (see pictures).<br /><br />Note: I received this product deeply discounted in exchange for a fair and unbiased review.<br />#finishitgear"
5.0,The fabric<br />The feel<br />The size<br />It’s a great

5.0,Fits just right!!!
5.0,Beautiful dress. I got a lot of compliments. Note that it comes in two pieces.
5.0,The ties were perfect for what they were bought for.
5.0,"No con all pro!<br />Size is as expected: I'm 5'1&#34;, 146 lb., 36D, and medium is just right- not tight, presenting the kinda loose A-shape. Fabric is thick enough so it's not clingy and not see-through. Best thing: no wrinkles after washing or being stuffed in a suitcase!"
5.0,"Comfortable, waistband doesn’t roll, Sizing is accurate, All in all good undies."
5.0,"Good quality would but again , I got a large and it fit good"
5.0,Great dress. Has a nice flow.

5.0,I wear a medium and the medium fit perfectly
5.0,I use them just for wear
5.0,"Be noticed.  If you can't handle attention, wear a pair of flipping *Dockers* or something, but move on to another product.  If you are at all able to rock this kilt, you will get +1 to almost every personal stat you have . . . with cool people. . if you actually rock it.<br /><br />**Remember you will always get -1 to those same stats from conformist types* To get the most from your kilt, you have to wear the ever-loving $&#)t out of it: you will gain the power to make weaker men *feel inadequate* as you pass, giving 0-Fs after 0-Fs to everyone that sputters in your wake,and everywhere your grinning, confident face turns.  And when you see them in the eye, IN THE EYE, you will see the shiver of little boy fear rippling down them - from their sweaty foreheads to their &#34; practical&#34; cargo shorts as they think &#34;wait, I was cool a minute ago - then Mr. Smarty-Kilt over here decided to pimp slap me FROM ACROSS THE ROOM with his disregard for **PANTS**<br /><br />No, seriously, go buy something else if you can't maintain the standard, because, whoever you are reading this review, you should be aware that you only have two options in a kilt: *awesome* or don't own it, don't wear it, stay in the hole that your conformity and fear make for your self-esteem.<br /><br />End of message."
5.0,Works great as a trash bag on the boat.
5.0,Beautiful dress! Loved the material!
5.0,This is a Christmas gift for my mother in law and it got here in record time!

5.0,I love this dress! It is perfect for work events!
5.0,Great price. Fit perfectly in the frames I have. So happy to have fresh lenses in my favorite frames that are no longer available!
5.0,Love love love this set!  It's absolutely adorable and such fun pieces to wear.  Looks exactly as shown.  Necklace was a little small for my neck so I just added and extender and was good to go.  Can't beat it for the money!
5.0,"Really cure  top- looks as described.  The print is slightly blurry, but I don't think that is a bad thing.  The tank top has a comfortable,loose fit."
5.0,I love this dress it fits and looks exactly how the picture looks!! I will definitely be ordering another one in a different color!
5.0,"This is a nice Gi.  Very durable.  Only issue is that belt is so stiff, it's almost impossible to keep it tied."
5.0,"Great, durable umbrella"
5.0,"I am loving this shawl wrap. Its not to thick but it is warm. Its a pullover with a hood and feels like I'm wearing a blanket. I wanted something easy to put on as I get further along so I won't have to buy a bigger coat just for a few months. Its soft and big, also fashionable."
5.0,"I loved my order & pretty sure my son's teacher will too. The only negative thing is the shipping, order should be shipped a more secure way. The business next door received my package & I was worried I was not going to receive it.. Other than that happy about my order!👍🏻"
5.0,I ordered my regular size and it fits perfect. I don't have dainty feet as you can see on the photo attached but it fits perfect in all spots.
5.0,Product appeard to be well made and in good condition!  And when a child asks for something this specific you know they will love it!  And she did!
5.0,I was very excited finding these earrings. I had a pair just like them and had lost one.  I had been very upset.
5.0,Fits well and is breathable. Surprisingly comfortable considering the price.
5.0,"For the price, this is a cute bracelet.  It comes packaged really nice, in a cute little bag with a ribbon.  The bracelet seems to be very well made and the clasp is magnetic which helps putting it on with one hand.  This will look really cute with jeans or dressier outfits.  I'm glad to have it!"
5.0,Very stylish and comfortable. I have light eyes and need good protection. These glasses are wonderful!
5.0,"It was a gift for my mom for her birthday, she called me to take so many times cause she loved it so much"
5.0,Gorgeous!! If they weren’t so pricey I’d get more.  It is just beautiful. Much prettier than pictures can show.
5.0,Like the graphics
5.0,This tie is so much fun. It looks good as a white tie if the lights are off but looks AWESOME lit up. This is a great buy.
5.0,So cute! I get so many compliments
5.0,FIYS WELL
5.0,"Got the shirt very timely, LOVE it, as I am a huge Mass Effect fan! went with a medium, because it's a men's cut and because of the reviews, but probably could have gone with a small.  It hangs a bit longer on me than I prefer, but that is also probably because of the men's cut.<br />All in all, I love this shirt and recommend it."
5.0,I bought one of these from a local store last year. I absolutely love it. It's great quality to hold some cash and/or a few plastic cards.<br /><br />It never fails to make someone smile or crack up. I initially was worried that the language would offend people but even my wonderful but somewhat prudish mother in law snorted when she first saw it. I'd recommend it for a cheap and easy way to keep your money organized or for a pocket friendly wallet when you don't need to carry more than 1 card and an ID.
5.0,Positive experience overall. Quick delivery and good product.
5.0,Very nice. Excellent quality. Love it!
5.0,Perfect fit. Exactly as discribed.
5.0,"Great little wallet . My old one only had one pocket , this one has many It's great , Thanks !"
5.0,"Im still getting a hang of folding them right. However, i love going shopping with these!!"
5.0,"I LOVE this apron, it’s very well made and the material is great. It’s not cheap and light and really has the perfect amount of pockets. I may order another one for my dad as a gift because it is so good!"
5.0,I bought a set for my daughter a few months ago and decided to get my husband a set for Christmas.  We like how easy they are to use compared to the usually metal clamps the gym provides.
5.0,I liked the shine of the fabric. Very stretchy and comfortable. Waist band is really tight and they’re super long waisted so I had to fold them over but I’m very thin. I wish they had a couple extra inches in the inseam and out of the waist. I’ll still be adding them to my normal rotation of just a few pieces of clothes I wear each week. I’d buy them again.
5.0,"Im 5'2"" and 118 lbs and purchased a 5 and they fit perfect."
5.0,I switched to using these flat money clip style wallets when I got a motorcycle and really appreciate how compact they are. This particular one is affordable and well made.
5.0,"I'm a 36bust, ordered a small.  Perfect fit.  I like the way it flares out at the bottom.  The back is longer than the front.  You can dress it up or wear casual with shorts.  Navy blue  is not see thru, even though it's thin material."
5.0,"Really like weight. Impressed by the quality and keep getting compliments on them. For the price, it's a no brainer."
5.0,Must buy chain is very shiny gotten many compliments first day
5.0,Beautiful and a great size.
5.0,"She loved it! Good clarity, quality, and fast shipping. Packaged well. Great buy."
5.0,"The colors are so vibrant and lively. They compliment my lipstick and natural tan that I got going on all year round. Here I'm wearing it to the LatinaCon Women's Conference held at the Hilton Hotel in beautiful Charlotte, NC. I love to have this sturdy and fun necklace handy for whatever event. It's very versatile and easy to combine. Definitely recommended!"
5.0,Like. Used for warmth during winter.
5.0,Convenient and pleasant to use
5.0,Comfortable and fit well.<br />Dinner and dancing.
5.0,Love them and great shipping time
5.0,"I own a couple quartz watches, an automatic watch, and wanted to try out a digital watch. For digital watches, Casio is the go-to! I got this style because I liked the classic sleek design, and I wanted one with a bit of matte gold to somewhat match with my matte gold wedding band.<br /><br />I love this watch. I use it as my daily. I don't have to worry about trashing it, losing it, or getting it stolen for the reason that it's so affordable for the average person that I can always replace it with a new one. I've worn it on a vacation trip and wore it in the pool/ocean for hours without any damage.<br /><br />I also like how understated it is, which is the style I go for. It makes a statement that you don't care about showing off your money on your wrist, at the same time having a nostalgic 80s feel."
5.0,"Purchased these as a gift and they were a hit! They were a bit large for the box they came in so the tassels were bent, but I was able to straighten them out easily by flattening them under a heavier box for a couple of hours."
5.0,Very Happy. Easy to adjust.  Cut off least amount. You can always cut off more. High quality leather with solid contemporary buckle. Great for casual or dress.
5.0,Wonderfully made and fits really well.
5.0,I received this as a gift and although it wasn't really my color I have to say I love it!! It is very flattering and a great fit. I am thinking of getting more colors- and the customer service is very friendly. Great product.
5.0,Quick shipping and great product
5.0,Super soft and warm. My son loves all Pokemon and runs around the house in his Pokemon underwear during winter. Now I at least know his feet are warm.
5.0,Gorgeous dress. Well made
5.0,"Great quality youth Jersey.  Gave as a gift to an avid Bruins fan, she absolutely loves it and the price was right!"
5.0,I am very pleased with the thickness and stitching of the belt itself.
5.0,My daughter loves this purse. It’s so nice I may get myself one.
5.0,"It is so cute. There is the rubber smell when you open the box, I let it vent a bit in my closet and the smell don't bother me no more."
5.0,my son likes it so much
5.0,Fit as expected comfy and thick
5.0,Great to put in your clutch or a small pocket! Holds a few of those very nice heavy duty business cards! Classy and cute!
5.0,very good<br />can locate my suitcase in a crowd<br />Durable<br />Easy to put on and take off.<br />I put it on after going thru security.
5.0,Bought for my 6 year old and they fit great with no fogging up...13 year old niece tried them and now she bought a pair.  Buying another for my 9 year old daughter...great product.
5.0,Great color like picture fit to size. Good work out shoe and Amazon got the order to my house fast
5.0,This product makes securing my shoes a breeze. So much easier than traditional shoe laces. The wide range of available colors also allows me to closely match my shoe color and type.
5.0,"Wow,delivery was fast and for the price I paid ,the sunglasses are a perfect fit and look great."
5.0,"I bought this watch roughly 4 years ago. Its rugged good looks attracted me, and the price was almost unbelievable for the heft and style of the timepiece. I own several watches - some higher end, some lower - and this one gets twice the compliments as any of them. It has become my go-to for every occasion. I wear it 360 days a year, from work to scuba diving. It has taken a beating and still looks great. One battery and o-ring replacement, and the band is finally showing some wear, but what else can you ask of a $100 watch over four years?<br />When/if this watch breaks I will happily replace it with the same. Great looking, great value, and tons of compliments."
5.0,I love this one.  Nothing shows thru due to it being blue.  It’s shorter .  Now I don’t step on the fabric. It’s flowy and the colors are wonderful. I ordered a size m and it’s perfect. Love the side pockets too.
5.0,"Absolutely love it!!! Was very fast shipping. I was surprised to see it was back in stock when I was intending to get another color instead. So as a very happy customer from a previous purchase, I had to get both. I feel amazing and comfortable in them. Thank you!!!"
5.0,I bought 2 pair and took off the gold wires off my earrings I already had and replaced them with these. I won't loose them now :-) They arrived quickly and I love them :-)
5.0,"Great product, easy to wrap and tie, very comfortable. stand up to all conditions. Very useful for anyone whether it be a day out in the woods or elements a month or for someone who spends multiple days a week out."
5.0,"Good quality! Nice colors. I wear it with most of my clothes because it has multiple colors, so it fits with any thing I wear."
5.0,"Super cute! I’m 5’7, 153lbs. Fits fine. I will definitely be getting more colors!!!!!"
5.0,The vest works really well for me. Holes are bigger than a competitor I have tried in the past so I get more air. Its nice not to come home with a t shirt drenched in sweat.
5.0,Great Dress runs small.
5.0,"I love these.  I got them for a Halloween costume and they are absolutely perfect.  They are nice quality, comfortable, and HUGE!  Love them."
5.0,Love it. Was happy about the material. The size was what I was hoping.<br />Love the feel and the look.
5.0,I loved how big they were. Only one problem. They didn’t stay straight. Would fall lopsided a bit because of how heavy it was. Other than that. They were perfect :)
5.0,Bought for my 12 month old daughter for the winter season. She's tall so I bought the 18 month size. It fits her well with room to grow!<br />The quality is very good and I am happy with the double zippers! The fleece inside seems to keep her warm and cozy. To top it off the owls are too cute!!
5.0,Purchased for my granddaughter and she loves.  I wanted a cotton fabric and found this.  Quality is excellent and I can recommend.
5.0,"Bought this as a gift for a young man who shows potential to be a great fisherman.  He loves them, perfect fit."
5.0,Too cute my kid loved! But the opening to fit the foot is very tight. So I would recommend to buy a size bigger
5.0,Worked great! Used it in my car to store all the things I need on a daily basis when I commute. Super easy to fit differs shape items.
5.0,Very cool socks!
5.0,I got it sooner than expected and it fits true to size... I like stainless stell because it requires no care and you can wear it everyday... I would order from this company as they have reasonable prices and fast shipping!!!
5.0,My grandson is a Flash super hero fan so I knew these jammies would be a hit as long as they were nice quality and soft.  Even after washing I found them to be soft and comfortable.

5.0,[[VIDEOID:a76a1447ab807b6b132f151a1a3d0601]] I have a wide foot but not wide enough for E width shoes. These shoes have a nice wide toebox that is extremely comfortable. The upper is extremely breathable and not too thick. The tread is not overly aggressive and the shoes look good enough to wear for every day use. The laces lock in a way that keep the boot tight and do not work to loosen. I got these boots to use for work but they really look good enough for every day wear. I would not hesitate to consider these boots if you have a wider foot.
5.0,I love this! Love the way they fit!!
5.0,"So cute!!!  My grandkids love these cute slippers. Some are sized differently, but these are true to their size. At least the large size fits my granddaughter that wears a size 3. They are warm and durable."
5.0,LOVE THESE ITEMS! RECEIVED IN A CUTE LITTLE GIFT BOX..FOR GIFT GIVING. LOOKS EXPENSIVE. VERY IMPRESSED WITH THIS PRODUCT!
5.0,The reviews criticizing the sizes scared me but once I got it and tried it on the sizing was as described so I think the reviews are from a time when the company didn’t have an accurate size chart. The sizing was accurate and the material and accessories were well done. The material feels great and is very durable. The costume is honestly really good quality and I highly recommend it.
5.0,I'm satisfied with the product and the seller.
5.0,The bomb. I looked really cute in it
5.0,Looks like the real thing! This ring is perfect - I don't like to wear my diamonds in public anymore. This ring gives me the bling that I love without the worries. Enjoy!
5.0,My daughter love it she said it's soft and comfortable that all that matter
5.0,These shoes are adorable! My 5 year old LOVES them.
5.0,"I love these pants. These are very comfy, plus they have pockets. The pockets really come in handy for me since I don't like purses. I will definitely buy again"
5.0,fits fine no more sharp corners.
5.0,"I usually am a 12 in dresses so I go for a large. However, I ordered a medium in this navy version of the dress and it is the one that fit well enough for me to keep!"
5.0,Stays on babies feet and keeps socks on... oh and adorable :)
5.0,"Very inexpensive and really cute.  Plus, the chain is long enough."
5.0,"My 5 year old liked it because it's poufy.  I like it because it's easy for her to change all by herself at daycare when it's time for ballet.  (She did a leotard and separate thin skirt last year just fine, but this is more fun and easy for her.)  Skirt seems delicate and stiff and itchy, but she wears it with tights of course, and it lasted a semester without tears, unravelling, nor pulling away from the leotard, so it's doing well. I wash in a Tide delicates laundry bag on the regular cycle, cold; usually hang dry; quick iron when I'm not lazy.  I've thrown this in the dryer on low a couple times, and about 20 minutes passed before i realized it and fished it out-- it didn't seem to melt the tulle (or tulle-like) material, so that was a bit surprising. Also, it didn't have a bad, stale odor when it first arrived, so i love that."
5.0,"I wear these as hair wraps while I sleep or work out, but I find they have another useful function: I have a plant light over my herb garden that comes on automatically at 6:15, and if I want to sleep in, these make good blindfolds ;)"
5.0,This is one of the cutest things that I have ever gone for my daughter and she loves it. I didn’t expect to be so adorable And well-made. Highly recommend it.
5.0,Like this Team bought it for my daughter to show  it off love the flip flops.
5.0,This hat is amazing. I love the color with the palm tree on it. It is adjustable so it fits perfect!  Will be wearing it on the beach - I  know it will be my favorite!
5.0,Little bit smaller than i thought. It's a good every day. Love the quality of the bag. Im glad i picked this color over black one. It would have been better if there was a bigger pocket inside. But overall i'm very satisfied:)
5.0,It's so simple and does what it's supposed to! And it didn't occur to me until I put it on that it looks just like an Apple iWatch. People have asked me. Not bad for the price at all! It only displays the time when you press the button on its side. I kept the cheap plastic on the face of it to prevent scratches.
5.0,"got here fast and also a really great product, i definetely would advise others to order from this shipper--just really fast service, great prices, etc.."
5.0,This shirt is perfect. The quailty is amazing. I love this shirt!
5.0,Just love the way the pants fit and love the colors
5.0,Super strong keychain and very functional
5.0,I'm 5ft tall and weigh 200lbs.  I ordered an XL and I'm very impressed with the fit and quality for the price I paid.  It is really comfortable as well.
5.0,Fits well. Everything as expected. My niece was thrilled!
5.0,It’s a good product considering the price. It hangs past my hips and covers my bottom which I really like.
5.0,Very comfortable I have several of these rompers and they are very comfortable.
5.0,My husband loved it. Gave it to him for our 9th wedding anniversary.
5.0,Todo 10 puntos
5.0,I brought this for my Daughters birthday & she loved it !!!! It’s true to size and it’s very pretty.
5.0,I love it the necklace came earlier than expected.
5.0,cute! and comfortable
5.0,"I was a little hesitant at first, but this necklace turned out to be very nice. My wife loves it and has it on all the time, she says it quite conformable. Definitely recommend."
5.0,Super comfortable and the color is beautiful
5.0,"These are very cute, well made and the Seller was very responsive."
5.0,"Great leather, great construction.  In the see-through I keep my VA card, drivers license, lifetime VFW card, lifetime Disabled American Veterans card and my concealed weapon card.  In one of the pockets I keep my Medicare card, Eagles card, Eagles key card, business cards, I have 7 credit cards in the slots, and empty pocket, and I have had as many as 37 bills folded and the magnets clasp together. The only caveat, is that the leather is so good and strong, it will take some time for it to stretch and accommodate all of you stuff. I in my opinion, there is no better value than this wallet anywhere!"
5.0,Pros:<br />Cheap<br />Durable<br />Flexible<br />Will not snap<br />Customer Loves it!<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not susceptible as much as other brands to color correction/dyes.<br /><br />Defined Use Case: Watch Band Replacement
5.0,My husband loves me in this dress.  Bought for a wedding but it’s a little too revealing.  Date night dress for sure. Fabric is awesome and stretchy
5.0,I received this purse today and I am thrilled. It is leather croc embossed with a gator 3 dimensional imprinted on the front. It comes with a detachable chain. The inside of the purse has 2 zippered compartments and 2 open compartments. The purse zippers shut and then closes with the magnetic closure. The size is 11” by 5 3/4” by 2” in width. You can’t go wrong with this purchase. It is gorgeous.
5.0,"As an older person, with the beginnings of cataracts in both eyes, and living in an extremely sunny climate, I wanted to protect my eyes more than I had been, with normal sunglasses.  I could not be more pleased.  These prevent stray rays from entering my eyes from the sides and top.  I feel strongly that I am preventing a more rapid development of cataracts by using these glasses."
5.0,"I have a 50 inch chest  and at 6' 2&#34; and 290 lbs, this product does a very good job of squishing the blubber in.<br />The first couple of times I put it on was pretty amusing because it was so tight, but it has since become more pliable.<br /> It's actually fairly comfortable, very cool.  I used to wear under armor compression shirts and those would get pretty hot, but this tank is very breathable.<br />With most dress shirts you cannot see the tank, but with lighter colored and thinner shirts you can see the outline of a tank top, but no one would ever know that it was a body shaper.<br />Over all a very comfortable and well made product.  I would defiantly buy it again."
5.0,"Perfect size, not too big. Very different and pretty hoops."
5.0,This ring is so beautiful! Super shiny and cery good quality for the price! Does not look like this is under $20!
5.0,Great work out shirt.  Easy to breath light
5.0,I gave as a gift to 27 year old who was going clubbing. So many compliments. She said they kept asking her who the designer was. Her reply was AP (Amazon Prime). She was happy to share with others.
5.0,I have come to use this as my travel wallet. I keep my passport and foreign money and credit cards in it. Easy to store in the hotel safe as well. All nice and compact. Easy to find in my purse all in one.
5.0,My 8 year old granddaughter absolutely loves this mask. It is fully adjustable and fits perfectly. It helps having to wear a mask bearable and even fun.
5.0,So cute and stylish addition to any little princess dress
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:2f491d367ea6fbe0154a3b743d297c3b]] ★ i received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. I was not influenced by anyone in any way.<br /><br />My color choice: GREEN<br />I am VERY impressed with this bag. It's beautiful. My husband seen it and was wow'd with the quality of this bag. It is very well manufactured. The stitching well done. I did not observe any flaws with this bag what so ever. The price for this bag, I would say is very good. I'd pay this much or more for it, hands down.<br /><br />I love the adjustable should strap. Being able to adjust it to my body or my husband can adjust it to his and being able to just take it completely off too. The front buckle decoration is very nice. My husband was unbuckling them at first, asking me how it's done. I laughed and told him it's really not rocket science. It has snaps with magnets. He laughed too and felt like an idiot he said. But he said he does love the buckles but being able to open and close with the snaps instead is much easier and effortless.<br /><br />This Vintage and Classic design features a front flap magnetic closure. There is a compartment for cell phones/PDAs, pens, and business cards. This messenger features a rear quick access slip pocket, a roomy main compartment with a front zipper pocket and a padded computer sleeve that can fit a up to 15&#34; laptop. Features a compartment that is perfect for holding books. The computer sleeve inside has a hook and loop strap closure and a large zipper pocket. The strap is adjustable. Just so many compartments to put your belongings in. You can carry your laptop, kindle, note book, tablet, and more. I'll be taking this bag with me when I fly out to see my son. It's lightweight yet can hold a lot. If I want to carry it by hand or cross body style, I can do either way.<br /><br />❤️ PROS:<br />•great quality made<br />•easy to adjust shoulder strap<br />•beautiful design<br />•durable<br /><br />💔 CONS:<br />•absolutely none<br /><br />✔️ OVERALL: This bag is flexible, not stiff like other bags are. You can move it around . I am sure you will love this bag. It's premium quality. I highly recommend this bag if you are looking for something like this. You won't disappointed.<br /><br />_____<br />I will always be honest in my reviews. I know that being a consumer myself, I want to see honest reviews, not a 4-5 star just to make a seller happy. My husband and I rely on reviews for our buying decisions as well."
5.0,"These are just what I wanted! Keep in mind that the posts are a little larger than standard earring posts, so if you haven't used these before you will have to stretch your current piercings a bit. I didn't find it terribly challenging/uncomfortable when I first started wearing fake plugs but just something to keep in mind. The wood looks great, and the posts seem pretty sturdily reinforced -- I guess we'll see how long they last, but for now they're solid. They're the perfect size and look fantastic. Highly recommended!"
5.0,Great quality and comfortable material
5.0,"This is by far my favorite Tri-Suit, I've bought two of these so far in different colors and recommend them highly. If I were to lose mine, I would replace them immediately!<br /><br /> I've tried many different suits, unfortunately, they often have something wrong: No bra, too much padding, loose across the chest, etc.<br /><br />Not this suit. The included padded shelf bra has anchored pads, so they won't be moving around or winding up in a ball you have to straighten out. The padding through the crotch (for bike riding) is minimal and doesn't leave you feeling like you're wearing a diaper. The chest area rides high, so there's no drag in the water or wondering if you're flashing anyone. (Why anyone makes a low-cut Tri-Suit is beyond me, sexy is not the idea here...) The banded legs actually stay put throughout my workout (not just swimming) and do not ride up. This suit is -comfortable-.<br /><br />I would note that the sizing is not standard American. If you are a size 16, &lt;= 175 lbs, up to a large C-cup, you need to be buying the ""US X-Large / Tag XXXL, and it will be a little tight (which is how a tri-suit should fit.) If you are larger than what I've stated above, you will not fit in this suit.<br /><br />TLDR: This suit does not suck. Read the sizing."
5.0,la compra fue tal lo que quería
5.0,Perfect lanyard for college!
5.0,The stone in the necklace nicely matches the ring. The necklace is bright both the turquiose and silver. I'm very please with my purchase.
5.0,One of the nicest purses I've owned. I get lots of compliments on it. Perfect size. My only wish was the lining wasn't brown... 2 years later i still have the bag. Its held together great only wear shown is the trimming on the handles.
5.0,"Great fit, great quality, go cubbies!"
5.0,"This hoodie is adorable. Other people are correct, the top and sleeves are a little snug, but that is perfect for me, as I am bigger through the waist, hips and butt. I am a 14/16, and busty, and the X large was perfect. I also like the &#34;unfinished look&#34; and have had NO fraying or strings pulling or unraveling. A nice light weight I can wear all year long."
5.0,"I'm 5'7 and 190 (hourglass figure/36dd) and the large fits great. It is flattering and gives a nice feminine look and fits nicely at waist, arms and chest. It has material that is soft but movable. It's not see thru either. It's one of my favorite tops and I'm going to be ordering more! I highly recommend!"
5.0,"Beautiful, very well made!"
5.0,"Color, talle y calidad óptimas."
5.0,NICE tie set. Good quality. Good value for the money. Very happy with it.
5.0,"Great, packable hat to block the sun rays. It's breathable too. My only concern is that it is so light - it can easily fly away if a strong wind blows."
5.0,"My daughter loved the bohemian styling and rich gold color of this the moment she saw it. My daughter is 5'6&#34; and about 95lbs, very long and slender, and she usually wears a size XS in Juniors sizing. We received a size Medium and it is obviously large on her, but she's happy with the fit. She wears a B-cup, and with the cut of this top, I think it could easily accommodate someone with a larger bust. She can't wait to wear it to school - it is a perfect Fall wardrobe piece! It looks great with jeans, or black leggings and boots. It has a single button at the neckline in the back to help the top fit tightly. The sleeves have a frilly belled fit, and there is a coordinating flounce ruffle at the hemline. The fabric, being 100% Viscose, does not have any give, but it is very lightweight, so it will be a good transition Autumn piece. It has a great statement design, and feels like a quality clothing piece: it had no loose threads, even stitching, attention to detail. It is machine washable, so we'll be washing cold with like colors. It explicitly states NOT to let it lay on itself while wet, so I recommend line/hang-drying. This is such a pretty, feminine breezy top, and the price is very reasonable!"
5.0,"Pretty colors.. looks just like the picture, very satisfied with it.  Goes with so many different outfits."
5.0,i wish i had filmed the gasp of pure joy my daughter did when she saw this dress!  the quality is much better than most options I have seen and the price was great!  She loves wearing it!
5.0,The memory foam helps my hips when I am walking.
5.0,"Well made mask, decent replica.  The hair is a bit ridiculous when it comes and it is harder to fluff out.<br /><br />But I bought this for Halloween and Ubering, and I had passengers love it so much they bought it off me for cash LOL!!!  It is thicker and durable, and doesn't scratch easy.  If you are claustrophic, don't buy a mask, but this is a little tight for bigger heads.  Heats up quick inside.  This is good for light to moderate use."
5.0,I ordered 2 of these for each of my daughters for their birthdays. I will be ordering another! They are just what I was hoping for.
5.0,"Fits very nicely on my hard to fit body. So, Thank you"
5.0,I would definitely recommend these socks. I am allergic to most wools and yet these do not bother my feet. They are the only thing that keeps me warm in the winter. They hold up and wash well. Would definitely recommend them for keeping your feet warm in the winter.
5.0,"Me encanto el modelo, la talla es un poco grande, pero hermoso y excelente calidad"
5.0,Very nice tie. It’s a little darker than I anticipated but it still looks good.
5.0,"Great shirt! Fits well (I ordered medium, one size up from my usual American size) and very warm.  Lining is a thin fleece that doesn't sag or bunch up.  I washed it in machine and hung to dry. This is my 2nd purchase--loved first one so much, so I got a different plaid."
5.0,THESE ARE MY FAVORITE SOCKS 💜
5.0,"I have worn it for two months now. No skin staining, infection, or discomfort. I have only taken it out briefly for cleaning and it has survived the pool, workouts, showers, etc. I like this piece because the elephant head is fairly flat, so it doesn't catch on my clothing."
5.0,The colors are blue instead if black and I don't like that the chainsaw teeth are white too but it's super cute and looks sturdy. I don't mind the inaccurate coloration considering this is going to be a gift.
5.0,Works great with wraps and scarves
5.0,"Nothing special, they were what I expected. Second time ordering will continue to order these as a part of a gift package."
5.0,"I love this watch. It's does basic digital watch functions really well. This is a watch that I wear every day to track time and occasionally use stopwatch function during workout. If you are looking for something simple , this a watch for you. If you want a watch for style and coolness, then, this is not a watch for you."
5.0,No gift box
5.0,Great.☆☆☆☆☆
5.0,Love this retainer.<br />Had a Chum's mono before this. This is way better. First of all it's longer so it hangs down in the back [sorta] and doesn't stick straight out like the Chums.<br />Also with the chums the rubber piece that attaches to the eyeglasses got real loose after only a couple of months. These are still pretty tight and I really love the green.
5.0,These are the cutest shoes! They even come in a cute chocolate milk carton package. I just love them!
5.0,Be sure to order up! Not extremely small like some others but definitely runs on the small side. I'm generally a medium and ordered a large and it fits ok still maybe a tiny bit smaller than I would prefer but easily wearable and I love it. Have had many compliments on this item.
5.0,Piece was for my daughter’s 18th Birthday and she loved it!
5.0,"These are cute earrings, can't beat the price.  I like studs, am always on the lookout for something inexpensive.  These are perfect.  Very nice value."
5.0,Soo pretty and delicate.
5.0,Favorite purse so far. Love all the pockets & organization.
5.0,These are good sunglasses for me. They help block light from the side as well as the front. This is extremely helpful if you have a migraine.<br /><br />They are made of flexible plastic that will be hard to break.
5.0,Great gift for young people getting they licenses.
5.0,Not only was I blown away by the quality of the necklace but all the little extras you get with it. I’ll definitely be ordering from her again.
5.0,these work great and light up very bright makes me feel  better having my dogs out on their leash at night time with these lights on them so no one accidently hits them
5.0,Pretty and comfy!
5.0,Beautiful loved it!
5.0,"Size XL , 225lbs , 5.6” , for me ? Excellent ! 😍"
5.0,"I'm a grown woman but I wanted a cheap water sandal for my recent tropical vacation. These performed well for light hiking, long walks, and swimming in rivers, lakes, and the ocean. The grip isn't as great as something like a Chaco or a real hiking sandal, but they served my purpose well enough and were lightweight enough for carry-on baggage. I wear a women's size 7 and the 5 fit perfectly. They're a bit wide at the forefoot, which I like."
5.0,"I love this set. I haven't worn it yet, but am planning on wearing it to Church and outings this summer.  It is very classy and goes with almost anything.  The earrings are light and comfortable."
5.0,Good fit. Nice and comfortable. Nice for winter nights.
5.0,Heavy seems well made. Very happy with the product.  It came much earlier then anticipated
5.0,"This fits perfect, There is no problem seeing out the eyes .  I recommend this 100%"
5.0,My father was very happy with them..
5.0,I love this mask it dit perfectly!!
5.0,"Semi Short Review: So this coat, cloak, jacket, whichever you wish to call it, is truly amazing! It's rather legendary, it's from Naruto, it's the Akatsuki clan, which is a very feared and respected clan on the show! I already have the 7th Hokage Cloak and wear it in public (That's right, you read that right, I wear it in public, I sure do!), so when I seen this, I had to get it! Plus you get the headband and signature ring too!<br /><br />This would be perfect for cosplaying, or if you are your own person like myself, just wear it because why the shell not! The detail is rich, the fabric feels ultra soft, and it does a fantastic job at keeping you warm, did I mention the fabric feels ultra soft!?<br /><br />If you love Anime (Who doesn't?), if you love Itachi (Who doesn't?), if you love Naruto (Who doesn't?), if you are still reading this wearing why you haven't gotten it yet, I don't know, but you need to buy it!"
5.0,"I’m so Excited, ordered these Friday and got them today (Monday)...<br />At first I was scarred bc the tag said L, but the S has a L on the tag. They fit! Yes, they are snug but that hopefully will mean good results. They are high waisted and went up further then I expected.<br />Cross fingers that they will hold up!"
5.0,"The size medium fit my wife as expected (5'4&#34;, 140)."
5.0,"Aside from the basic buttons, this sweater is impressive. The details are very nice, the yarn is so soft. The sizing is generous and boxy for a small sweater, but the images show that and are a good representation of the item. I ordered a small. I am 5'8"" 130 lbs, wear a 34D bra, and size small or 2/4, women's dresses and tops. 35"" chest. The red wine color is lovely, and the color shown in the ad is an exact match for the color of the sweater I received.<br /><br />I am really impressed. If you wanted to order the sweater and make it special, take it to a tailor and get buttons, but other than that it's great. The buttons are black plastic, and are fine. But, since the sweater is so nice, it makes the buttons sort of stand out to me.<br /><br />5 Stars."
5.0,"I'm stocking up on bikinis getting ready to open my pool for the season and bought this white bikini after having a lot of luck with others from Aphrodite.  The size small fits me perfectly and I'm 5'6&#34; size 4 US, 34C.  The photos in the listing don't show the back but it's the &#34;scrunch butt&#34; style.  I tried to post a picture with it on but it got rejected by Amazon :(.  I love solid white as I can mix and match either the top or the bottom with pretty much any of my suits.  Like others I've bought from this brand, the material is on the thin side so not for the modest.  It's how I prefer it though because it keeps you cool and dries super quick!  I received this bikini at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,Absolutely LOVE this dress. Need to buy a couple more in different patterns. The colors are bright. Fits just right. Very flattering.  I'm 5'3&quot; 160lbs bought a large. You'll love it!
5.0,I am 5'5 and weigh 165 and  medium fits perfectly. Lots of stretch.  Would work as a maternity dresss depending on how far along you are.
5.0,"Just buy 2 sizes up.  I usually wear a Medium, bought an XL, they fit perfectly"
5.0,Good watch for the money makes a nice dress watch
5.0,Comphy n soft
5.0,I use this product for balance and am extremely satisfied with the results I get from using it and highly recommend it to all my family and friends
5.0,"I purchased the 3x (I'm 5'5 268lbs). This runs a little small, more like a 2x. I can zip it up but this is so lightweight i'm nervous it will rip that I'll just leave it open. The sleeves cut a little short on my arms (about 2 inches from my wrist) but it did look cute when I scrunched up the sleeves. Depending on your body size and how you want to style this jacket I'd definitely size up one for an open relaxed look or two sizes up if you want longer length and want to fully zip it up. This jacket is definitely for show and not everyday wear. I'm almost tempted to buy a backup because I can only imagine what happens if I snag it on something. Overall veryyyyy cute. Arrived timely. And perfect for fall and spring."
5.0,"Love these! Soft, comfy, and fit perfectly. I'm an 18/20 on bottom and plus size is perfect."
5.0,"I love it.  It's beautiful and I can't keep my hands off my girlfriend when she wears it.  She is 5' 6&#34; and it fits her perfectly, but if you are buying this for someone 6 feet tall, it will be too small. I absolutely would buy it again. Wash it by hand and it will last forever."
5.0,So cute. Not flimsy at all.
5.0,"Fits great, very comfortable, and has a convenient slit for you to easily adjust the padding as you need! Would definitely buy again!"
5.0,Excelente efectos del zapato mi sobrina feliz
5.0,"Gojira is one of those bands that when people ask “what are they like” there is no easy answer because they are hard to classify due to their uniqueness. I will simply say (in my never to be humble opinion) that if you like Coroner, Helmet, Melvins, Believer, Massive Audio Nerve, Snapcase, or Philm you should check them out. Not that I am comparing them to any of these other bands, that would be ‘apples and oranges’, but rather that if your tastes include the eclectic they are worth a moment of your time.<br /><br />I knew of Gojira by name only until they were coming on tour with Mastodon, since I was going to that show I figured I should check Gojira out. One taste and I bought every CD except the ever elusive Terra Incognita (currently selling for $85+ used, REALLY!?). As impressed as I was with their CDs and the live video of them online, it all paled in comparison to seeing them live. I will just say that I will NEVER miss them live again! Totally Savage!"
5.0,"I like it, it's well constructed. Works nice with a dress but also with jeans. Happy I purchased."
5.0,"Love everything about this top . Fits great , washes great & i get many compliments on it when i wear it either with work slacks, denim sorts or white shorts . So versatile."
5.0,I usually buy Mira flex. This was a great inexpensive alternative!
5.0,"I can't tell you how many people comment on my awesome Jake wallet, there are plenty of card slots and the chain is pretty nice. After using it for a few months there isn't any noticeable wear and the snaps hold tight."
5.0,"As another comment mentioned, there is a weird small bulge on one side of the dress around my waist which I think is because of the zipper. 5’1”, S fit perfect. Comfortable material."
5.0,"Got a lot of compliments with these pendants, they look great and add a layer of sophistication to the outfit. Great buy!"
5.0,"I'm in love with this dress. I got it for work, I work as a Paralegal and this is perfect! I love the style and I will get more use out of this than just a work outfit for sure. Thinking of ordering one in another color/pattern! I got a size small, for reference, I am 5'0&#34; and 98 lbs."
5.0,Perfect fit for small hands<br />1.5 year old sounds about right!<br />They are warm too. Great for 30 degree F weather
5.0,"Looks class, fits really nice and looks super clean even after 2 months , it seems to hold up against the rain also."
5.0,Great colors and design!! So soft..

I purchased this to give as a gift to my daughter, because it’s the perfect gift to give to give to a teenage girl.  Both my daughter and I really like this bracelet because it’s a one-of-a-kind and it is made from genuine leather. The bracelet is very fashionable and pink is her favorite color.  She wore it to school and she received so many nice compliments from her class mates. Now everyone wants to order these. We love how it fits on her wrist; fits perfect.  I would highly recommend this bracelet for all ages and it’s a perfect gift to give.  I am truly happy to have this opportunity to receive this item at a discount price.<br />Disclaimer: I have received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review.

5.0,We purchased these overalls for our six year old grandson. I was very pleasantly surprised when we opened the package.  The fabric was soft and the quality surpassed anything I could have hoped for. He couldn't wait to get them on and the fit was perfect.  I do believe he would wear them every day if his mother would allow it!
5.0,These are great belts.  They are leather.  I have to admit they do have a little moldy smell when you first receive them.  I believe its because  they come from over seas.  The smell does go away after a little while.  They make great gifts.  I would purchase a size larger because they do seem to run a little small.  For what you pay for a good belt these are a bargain.  I highly recommend.  I did receive this at a discount to try and then give an hones and unbiased opinion.
5.0,I ordered the large and fits me perfect! Very soft material and really cute! I will use as bathing suit cover up but could also be worn as a dress with a tank top under it. 👍🏻👍🏻

5.0,"I am a senior woman and I bought this sweatshirt for myself. I like the loose fit, it's very comfortable and I love the color green.  I wear it while I'm walking, shopping or just about anything. I'm getting more colors to go with my leggings and pants, who says you can't be colorful while you're out and about or walking."
5.0,I was looking for a necklace that I could take on vacation instead of bringing one with real diamonds; I was not disappointed. Its delicate but sturdy and lays very nicely on my neck - I love the layered look and would definitely recommend it!
5.0,"I’ve been skeptical about these blue blocking glasses for months but finally decided to try some because I hate the eye strain I get from my electronics. After looking at dozens of pairs, I chose these because they looked like they would fit my narrow face. They are perfect! I love the way they fit and look and they really do make my eyes feel less tired! I bought two pairs: one for reading on my phone and one for driving. I love them! Highly recommend!"

5.0,"I love this dress!  I am a man (5'10"" and 220 lbs) and the XXL fits perfect. If you are a man who likes to dress up on occasion, I recommend you buy this dress."
5.0,"I got this to use on an airplane for a trip, didn't want to have to drag around a mask and keep up with it. The built-in mask part of this worked great! It is a pretty thick material so it is kind of hard to breathe through during a long period, but if you need to do a lot of on/off, this works perfect. I also like how the mask just blends into the cowl/turtle neck. Not sure how much a lighter color would show but the black worked perfect. I also liked that it was a little longer and I could wear it like a tunic (I'm 5'4')"
5.0,Mi hija tiene 11 años pedí talla para 14 años le quedó perfecto ella mide 1.55 de alto
5.0,"My daughter needed this for her school play, it is really cute and fit perfectly."

5.0,"these are awesome, I stopped wearing both my Oakley glasses because the lens of these are better. never buying expensive glasses again. they also hold up pretty well, because they are so cheap I don't take care of them and they have almost no scratches. Have had them for almost 6 months."

5.0,"Very nice dress, It's gorgeous on!"
5.0,"This is awesome! Such a lifesaver when you're forced to walk in the rain (walking the dog, checking mail ect). Its full coverage so you dont get even the slightest bit wet. We just got it this weekend and it has already been used twice. It is a raincoat so its not exactly the most fashionable thing you could wear, but it sure does its job!"
5.0,"They run small, these were a size smaller than other brands sized  leaves that I have bought."
5.0,Love this retro dress. It makes me feel very feminine.
5.0,Perfect and just what I was looking for. Can dress up or down. Long enough and oh so soft. Super comfortable
5.0,"I got this for a summer outfit. It arrived in good shape. No pendants fell off, the leather is either really good at being fake leather or is real because it's in really good shape. The ability it has to elongate or shorten is smooth and functional. I absolutely adore this necklace. I definitely expected worse for the product but its great and I get a ton of compliments."
5.0,I got the 2xl and am a 14-16 and this was very comfy and loose like I wanted it. It's been washed and held up great. I'm probably going to buy another color!
5.0,Very soft and light weight. This fits exactly as the size suggests.  There is nothing super remarkable about this tank except that it is precisely what the description says and you will not go wrong ordering this.
5.0,"This is a fantastic piece. Hope my thoughts below help someone who's on the fence about this item.<br /><br />Sizing:<br />I am 5'7&#34; and 135 lbs. My measurements matched up with a Medium on the provided sizing guide, and it fits slightly loose on me. Kept the Medium so I can layer and wear sweaters under the jacket!<br /><br />Pros:<br />- QUALITY vegan leather; Does NOT &#34;squeak&#34; like some other faux leather fabrics. Looks and feels high quality- I wouldn't be able to spot this as vegan without touching it.<br />- As another user said, &#34;holy butts it's comfy&#34;; Blank NYC knows how to make moto jackets<br />- Well made and sturdy; Manufacturing is impeccable and the inside liner is superb.<br />- Flattering; Cut will cinch your waist<br />- Warm; Won't keep you fully toasty on a winter day, but keeps me cozy during lectures in freezing classrooms<br />- Versatile<br /><br />Cons:<br />- For my taste, the hardware looks slightly too loud/fashionable. I prefer a more classic look, but the hardware wasn't a deal breaker for me. I tried on upwards of 12 vegan leather jackets, and none of them even came close to this in fit, comfort and look. Highly recommended!"
5.0,"Simple, quick...been using a paste cleaner for years. Bought this and will never use paste (or anything else) again."
5.0,cute and came fast!
5.0,these are not surgical steel - can not wear - wish i could
5.0,Such a cute charm for my mother-in-law's bracelet!
5.0,I had to tailor it to fit as it wasn't hugging the body like the one on the model but I was able to make it work and it turned out very nice and for the price couldn't beat it
5.0,Lovely Betsy Johnson handbag! Very pleased with this purchase.
5.0,I love this dress. It is soft and comfortable and doesn't cling to my body.
5.0,"Love love this sweater! Sleeves were a tad too long for me,but i just rolled it tiny bit and it's perfect.<br />Buying more colors!"
5.0,very high quality and goes for cheap highly recomended
5.0,"Honeystore does a great job with pictures here as they do a good job representing this item.  It's a gold plated ear cuff with a leaf pattern that has little cubic zirconia stones that make it truly sparkle.  The gold looks nice and rich looking.<br /><br />The size of the cuff is pretty large and my wife, who has smaller ears, thought they were a bit large but she was able to wear it.  The bottom of the cuff goes on like a pierced earring and there is a small clip at the top that goes over the ear to help keep it in place and take some strain off the piercing since the cuff is fairly heavy.<br /><br />It is truly a nice looking piece of jewelry and is quite different than items I've seen in the past.  My wife informed me that this type of ear decoration is the new thing and she likes the look of this piece a lot.  It is definitely something that will get second looks or comments as it is different and quite striking.<br /><br />Overall this is a high-quality ear cuff that looks very rich in person.  It seems well made and quite sturdy but it may be a bit large for younger girls or those with smaller ears.  Recommended.<br /><br />Sample provided for review."
5.0,"Great product...I use it primarily while golfing.  It is very comfortable and also very protective.  This helps protect my skin so I do not get sunburned on my ears, face and neck."
5.0,"They’re sturdy, and look beautiful. I haven’t tried on the necklace or earrings yet but they look beautiful as well"
5.0,"This is cute, functional and stylish.  I transferred all the stuff from my other purse easily to this one, It is a smokey see thru plastic with imitation alligator skin accents.  The strap can be either a cross body or as an off shoulder purse, both work easily with the strap being adjusted to your preference.  It has a twist closure that matches the golden chains on the strap.  I can clip my keys to the D ring on the purse where the strap attaches, I feel confident this purse will last quite a while.  Some employers require purses that are see thru, this fits the bill.  This purse stands up without me being too concerned that it will fall over as other purses do.  The base is built for it to sit up.<br />My only concern would be losing items if it accidentally got knocked over.  I would not use this for travelling on an airline, with the metal accents and potentially losing important items in a airline checkpoint.  There is a soft inner purse, for ladies essentials or monthly cycle needs, keeping them nicely discreet.  Overall I think this is cute and functional, will use on date nights.  I think this can be used with confidence by a vast age range as well."
5.0,"These are my favorite pajamas. I have one in black and one in navy. So comfortable and stylish. Mostly made of cotton so it lets the skin breath well. Stores are only selling mostly 100% polyester pajamas these days, so buying online is the way to go."
5.0,"When my friends 3 year old opened the box with this gorgeous little unicorn dress, she gasped and whispered to herself,  ""It's so beautiful!"""
5.0,bought this for a friend and she loves it.

5.0,"I got it for my sister-in-law who likes tiny studs, and the fact that it was small and still climbed up the ear made her REALLY love it!"

5.0,Lied the different types of cages we got. Will ne placing another order soon!
5.0,"I bought this to go to Universal, as normal masks are too hot in the Florida sun. This works perfectly for the parks! If there is any sort of breeze, this mask makes it cool. While it can be a little hot around the neck, it is the most comfortable mask I have found."
5.0,hAT LOOKS AND FEEL GREAT.
5.0,"Comfortable, cute, and functional! I’ve had many comments on how cute these plugs are!"
5.0,The package included extra pins as well! No need to move the pin from one band to another!
5.0,The first thing I am going to say is that I love the stretchy soft fabric this blouse comes in. I chose the navy blue with flowers print and the contrast of colors look beautiful. The zipper is of good quality. Size XL is true to size. I like the detail that you can wear the cuffs as 3/4 or untied them to a full long sleeve. I would recommend this shirt; it is of good quality.
5.0,Arrived in time and very good quality
5.0,Went to the Hair Show in Atlanta and my boyfriend had people approaching him about his necklace. Great purchase.

5.0,"I love these things! They give you an amazing light show but because the center is pretty easy to see through you can move around much easier than with kaleidoscope lenses. Only thing is make sure that the lenses are tight when you first get them. Mine were a little lose and at one point a lens fell off, thankfully onto a bed. Popped em back in and tightened them and haven't had a problem since. Will definitely buy more!"
5.0,The quality and fit was much better than expected. I would purchase again.

5.0,"I bought this for my vacation and am so happy I did! It's a light weight tshirt material (a light jersey fabric) that can be rolled up and tucked into my suitcase. So versatile, too! Can be worn alone with sandals or with a denim shirt and sneakers. Very pleased!"
5.0,Very very pretty necklace! My DEH SuperFan daughter will be impressed!!

5.0,Please buy this. I love it
5.0,Very cute and packaged nicely for a little gift for my granddaughter who loves dogs.
5.0,"This does exactly what I need it to. I wear it under my baseball cap when I go for my walk/jog, and it keeps the sweat out of my eyes. I wore it all day at work under my hat for an outdoor event (in Central AZ where we consider 100 degrees a cool day), and was comfortable for the full 14 hours. It washes well, is light and airy."
5.0,"I bought this for an Arduino project, but it's useless for that.  It'll be useful in our booth as an MP3 player that can be controlled by pushing its buttons.  I ended up getting a DFPlayer that can be controlled by an Arduino.  So, I gave 5 stars because it does just what it claims.  That's all."
5.0,Most comfortable on the neck and shoulders.<br />Good quality.<br />Margin for the price.

5.0,"Raymond Weil watches are the best for me.<br />Quality, craftsmanship, class and European style distinguishes their watches from others.<br />They are your moneys' worth especially if your wrist size are not big.<br />Raymond Weil through the years have never wavered in their undying commitment to quality & an edge of class all in an affiodable price ! I, for one will continue patronizing and purchasing their product !"

5.0,"Very shiny, very shiny. A pair of beautiful stud Earrings are very exquisite. I love it. It just looks and feels expensive. Wow me. It looks big, but it's really small. There are no drawbacks to it for me, I think it's great, the only suggestion is that I think it fits in a prettier box to keep it in!"
5.0,Nice finish on the fabric. Pretty patterns.
5.0,We had my nephews foot measured the weekend before this was ordered. His toes were too snug in the front. I would say the shoe runs small.
5.0,"Fit comfortably for our long days.  If I had to wear a mask, it was gonna be a fun one."
5.0,I love this tunic! It's exactly what I've been looking for. The material is soft and it fits perfectly. It's not too big under the arms like a lot of tank tops. I'm 5'1 and it comes to a couple inches above my knee. It's so cute under shorter layers. I've also ordered the black and cream.
5.0,Bag was delivered very quickly.  The workmanship on the bag looks really good.  I’m giving it to my nephew for Christmas so that he can use for his first job this summer.

5.0,Nice and then great for family time
5.0,Why is the model for this A MAN
5.0,"These boots were nicely packaged and shipped/arrived on time.  I rarely buy shoes online because I'm afraid of them fitting weird and I think shoes are something you have to try on.  However, these were cute, I needed new boots and the price was right.  I decided to try.  They fall just below the knee and I'm 5'7&#34; tall.  I have thinner, but muscular calves so I was concerned they would have a lot of room in the calf area and I prefer a tighter fit.  However, they fit quite well.  There was enough room that someone with a larger calf would be comfortable, but not too much room.  They looked good. The material is soft and feels good to the touch.  The zipper zips smoothly and is a good quality metal zipper.  The look of the boot is more casual, but would look good with jeans or the right skirt.  The heel is low and it's a pretty comfortable shoe.  All in all a great boot and I'd certainly buy again.  I actually bought two pairs from Riverberry and both are really nice quality.<br /><br />I purchased these boots at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review.<br />All the opinions expressed here are solely my own."
5.0,This was a gift for my son.  He loved it.  Would  recommend it to  anyone with a son.
5.0,"VERY comfortable and flattering. The fabric is lightweight and breathable. I bought it specifically for a luau I’m going to, but I will definitely be purchasing more in different patterns!"
5.0,"Very pretty dress, good quality"
5.0,Worked awesome! Birthday boy loved it
5.0,"I adore this faux fur scarf! It's been freezing here lately and this keeps my neck really warm. It's the perfect length to tuck into my jacket that has a v-neck and it also looks great when I tuck the ends inside the collar of my other coats. The fur and lining are both soft and not at all itchy. I have the brown/grayish color and it looks nice with all three of my coats (black, brown and blue)."
5.0,"I really like the adjustable straps. It fits really well to my face. They are thick. A little hard to hear my voice through. Very comfortable and breathable. Look great, made great. I will buy more. Highly recommend."
5.0,My most favorite sock .. EVER!!
5.0,"We ordered these women’s long sleeve pajama sets for one of our daughters, and she does like the peach color, the design and the styling of the scoop neck, and the drawstring closure with the elastic belt. She says that she likes that the texture of the fabric is soft and smooth to touch, gentle and easy on her skin. Our daughter says that these pajamas fit loosely and her pretty well and are comfortable to wear, easy to put on and take off without any hassles. She says she has been wearing them for the past 3 weeks now and she says she likes that they are cozy to lounge around at home and as sleepwear at night."

5.0,I ordered a medium after reading reviews. I wear a size small or a 4 in a dress but this dress runs small or is sized for teens. The medium fits well and is slightly fitted. It falls just above my knees and I am 5' 4&#34;. Love it !
5.0,Love love!! Super soft material and very comfortable. Very cute!! Love it! It’s not a thick band.
5.0,"This fossil mini wallet is perfect for a night on the town. There are 2 card slots to hold credit cards, ID etc, a side money slot and a change pocket in the center.  The wallet snaps shut to keep things secure and there are 2 snaps in case you need a little extra room when filling it."
5.0,It was amazing! My daughter loved it.
5.0,"My husband loved these. His boots would get wet at work and the next day they would be dry and ready for his work day. On top of that, they never smelled after getting dried out."

5.0,"I bought a L- I am 5’6 170 pounds. I am curvy, have an “hourglass” shape-ish ;). It is flatter though and the mterial is not boxy. It fits to the body well. I like that it’s a little longer (above knee). The sleeves do look like a raw cut which worries me in other reviews but I think they look cute. Perfect for spring or summer!"
5.0,This ring is amazing very smooth and nice. It did come a little later than excepted but they did send an apology letting telling they were sorry and gave me a free gift. I think it was pictures of Rap monster (the ring I bought was Rap monsters) or a chain to hold the ring on. I already bought on for it so i didn't need it but I was very happy to get the pictures and the ring. I love it it's very nice.
5.0,This purse is Da-Bomb.com. I love it!

5.0,"Love love love these headbands!!! They stay put during my workout without a problem.  Headbands usually bother me and end up giving me a headache, but not these!

5.0,These run a smidge big but are perfect otherwise. My toddler loves them and they are soft and affordable.

5.0,These sunglasses are. They look nice and feel well made. Most importantly it keeps the sun out of the eyes.
5.0,"This is the second dress I have ordered from ACEVOG online. I followed the company's measurement guidelines and placed my order. Both dresses were very well made, extremely comfortable and fit me perfect. I received a great deal of compliments when I wore them. This dress did have one button that did not line up with the others, but I took it off and re-sewed it on and it looks just precious. I love this dress!"
5.0,"I have a big chest, and it's very stretchy, but the further your stretch it, the shorter it gets. So it barely covers my chest. But that's ok with me because I'm wearing a sleeveless top over it and it covers everything. The sleeves are a little long, but I'm short so that is expected"
5.0,Tend to be a platinum fan of this brand but the kinetic style fits pretty well
5.0,Fit just right for family photos! The little cinch at the waist made it cute without showing any rolls. Full coverage on top made it easy to pick up kids and not worry about adjusting my dress.
5.0,"Was actually impressed for an Amazon clothing order. Fabric was soft, super comfy, and the sleeves come all the way down to my wrists, which sweaters don't always do for me. Will be buying again in other colors!!"
5.0,This is my go to choker.  I searched a really long time to find a choker like this.  It is large enough to cover my thyroid surgery scar and light enough not to be hot.  I wear a lot of black so it goes with a lot of my outfits.  I just wish they had more colors I would buy them all.  Please make more colors.  Thank you.
5.0,Not what I was looking for but good quality and colors

5.0,Perfect size for a little girl.  We got this for our 4 year old who is just beginning to love jewelry. We wanted to get her some inexpensive things in case they broke. This set was great.
5.0,"Perfect. 5’8” and 250 lbs, I got an XL. Pretty true to size; I’m about an XL most places these days. I’m at the midpoint of my weight loss journey, so inexpensive transitional clothing is a must. This is so cute, definitely recommend."

5.0,It looks just like the picture but better in person. Well made  Nice vibrations Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
5.0,Exactly as expected. Love it
5.0,"Took a while to iron, but well worth it! I’m 5’8” 160 pounds. I got a large. It fit a little loose. It was as comfortable as wearing a hoop skirt can be. I paired it with a Pannier hoop skirt, along with white wig and white face, it was a hit!<br />My only complaint is the zipper. It barely worked well enough to try it one once and wear it once. Just know the zipper is horrible. But I got so many compliments. I might see what I can do about getting it replaced."
5.0,"I'm a 32 DD, 5'4&#34;, and 121. I ordered a small because I had ordered a medium in another brand and that was too loose. This fit much closer to my body, not tight though. It was between the two and I went with the fit that was more complementary."
5.0,I loved it. Hope they come up with different ones.
5.0,Beautiful yet minimal statement. Gorgeous color of fire Australian Black Opal. Perfect complement to my Australian Black Opal necklace and bracelet
5.0,Heavy weight material. Will keep you very very warm!

5.0,Soft warm and comfortable for elderly Mom who is always cold.

5.0,"Durable, washable, good quality"
5.0,"Wearing mine and it's already been a year and change. Haven't taken it off. Even in the shower. It's perfect and most people (for some reason) ask if it's from Naruto. But it stays true to the shine and design. Wish I took it off for showers because the shine has faded up and it's a bit more rustic but nevertheless, I love it."
5.0,Fits my Samsung watch perfectly and very easy to install
5.0,These compression socks fit perfectly! They don’t slide down at all nor do they feel so tight as to be uncomfortable. I work 12 hour shifts and they always feel great the whole time!

5.0,Amazing just as pictured! Actually cuter in person.m!
5.0,Very nice dress only that chest is to large
5.0,"Super cute skirt! I sized up per the reviews and I’m glad I did . I’m 5’5, 165lbs and got an XL ! It fits like a glove/ pencil skirt. It has some stretch but not much. It’s VERY cute though. The only CON was the sequins are on the elastic waistband and it hurts your tummy. But I’m that can be fixed with some material . I wore it high waisted , it does still drag a tiny bit if you wear<br />Flat shoes. I also would pull it up to get in and out of the car."
5.0,Love it. Wear it on the golf course everyday(until summer). All my friends want one. Really stands out on the course.
5.0,Love the color. Perfect size to put on wrist.

5.0,"The fit on this dress is amazing. I'm 5'8&#34; and 120 pounds and this dress is the perfect cross between work-appropriate and really flattering. The skirt is long enough, right about at knee level. Really great dress for the price. Just crossing my fingers that it holds up in the wash!"
5.0,"Great fit, nicely done."
5.0,Love it!  Convenient for shopping & hiking!
5.0,This is very comfortable great material size was perfect a little thin had to wear a slip underneath would recommend this dress color was as advertised. Robert

5.0,I'm very happy with how nice these look on her.
5.0,"This is a super cute simple summer dress without all the frills. It is high waist but does a great job of hiding my mid-section. The print is just as picture. I order a XL but probably should have ordered a L. I'm 5'7&#34;, 200# and all leg and it was a little loose even though I have a mid-section.  It is so CUTE!"
5.0,Definitely a stable in my closet
5.0,Cute...but took small
5.0,Me encanto el broche y es poco comun
5.0,loving it very much
5.0,Beautiful piece that is gift packaged in a nice box that also has a gift bag inside. I am giving to my nursing student daughter for Christmas. I am sure she will love it.
5.0,Adorable Gift
5.0,"Thank you my set  came on, I will definitely be making other purchases, and tell everyone at my College about your Company."
5.0,"Cute!  Nice color saturation. Though it is large it hangs so well, perfect weight to not look sloppy but very stylish.  Really good job, Mordenmiss."
5.0,Looks just like the picture.  Very nice little key chain.
5.0,Lots of complimentts!
5.0,Super comfy and cute - would recommend sizing up if you’re looking for a looser fit. Since these are for working out I stuck to my regular size (L) and they’re a little snug but still feel great
5.0,This is a great value seeing as there are some clips that are more than double the price. Maybe I’d care more about the durability if I wore ties every day.
5.0,I love this dress on my daughter! It's perfect for the Christmas pageant she is in! Fit a little in the bigger side but if rather slightly big than to small
5.0,Looks good.  Handy tools were included to make the adjustment to the band length.  There were instructions as well on how to use the tools.
5.0,"This robe is very soft! and warm, but not heavy.  I am 5'7"" and appreciate that it is floor length. I would buy it as a gift."

5.0,I bought this for my 9 year old and she LOVES it!  Great fabric and embroidery.  Looks exactly like the posted picture.
5.0,"My husband loved this watch. He is very picky, I should add. Good rich color but not too dressy. Very lightweight and appears to be good quality. Great for the price, was an anniversary gift for him. The watch face is very large...check your frame size before buying."
5.0,"I LOVE! I put they fit as expected because after reading the reviews I realized they would fit small so order up a size and they were perfect. The size chart is accurate, and it’s very dependent on how big your hips and butt are. I wear a medium in Victoria secret leggings and most other gym fit pants, and I ordered an XL in these. I might could have fit in a large but I would say if in doubt order up a size for sure!"
5.0,Very sweet ring  Arrived quick very satisfied
5.0,This bag is more than a cell phone holder. I now use it for my purse. It is perfect and so light.
5.0,More comfortable than expected. Will buy more.
5.0,This is a bathing suit dress! Bathing suit material. Nice surprise. You could wear this swimming with a bikini bottom underneath it. Great for the beach or splash pad or general wet activities. Also super cute with great bright colors.
5.0,My daughter recieved this for Christmas and it was exactly what she wanted.  Thank you for putting a smile on her face.
5.0,"I purchased this because I would rather have an ear warmer instead of a hat because of all the heat I generate when I run.  It was very soft when I pulled it out of the package.  When I first put it on, I was disappointed because it felt too big.  However, it stay on and covered my ears while running!!!  Obviously you do not have to have your hair in a pony tail to wear either.  I often French braid my hair and it fit well.  It does not absorb sweat too well, but an easy remedy was to wear a sweatband under it.  I would recommend."
5.0,"The adjustable ear loops were very good.  I wear glasses and hearing aids and this mask is the first one I have found to be compatible with both.  Also, my glasses don't fog."
5.0,Just love it 😍
5.0,This jumper fit exactly as expected. I was a little worried about ordering online but was greatly impressed. Everything about this was perfect!!! This is true to size.
5.0,My husband purchased this for me for Christmas.  They fit nicely and are warm.  They are also not too bulky.
5.0,"Am very pleased with this product, good quality material."
5.0,"I freaking love this dress! I bought it for an adult prom this weekend and I didn't want to spend a whole lot of money on something formal. I purchased the maroon and the black in size large (I'm 5ft7, 170, 36DDD) and it fit like a glove in the body but the top half was big even on me. I used double sided tape in the cup area and along the sleeve and it was fine."
5.0,"Fits well, nice quality. I have not wash it yet. But it seem it will hold well."
5.0,"Far more than I expected. Exactly what I was looking for -simple belt.I would definitely purchase another one.Ha, give it to myself."

5.0,"Great band, but they don’t seem to make it anymore"
5.0,Very comfortable  I would buy again
5.0,This shirt is excellent quality and so pretty on. I have had many compliments. It washes well and I hang to dry (my preference). It’s not too hot and can wear in warmer weather.
5.0,"It has pockets. By default, this dress is amazing. But for real, it's actually super comfortable, and it can be worn both casually, as well as formally if you pair it with heels or nice jewelry. It's also a very flattering shape as an A-line style."
5.0,I like em!!!<br />Washed 1x.<br />No shrink noticed.
5.0,very pretty and looks great with my dress.  my daughter came to visit and she loved it.
5.0,😍😍😍I am a 4est wearer 4evermore ❤️❤️❤️ THANK YOU 😀🥰 😍❤️
5.0,"I wanted warm socks that were not tight. I use these for meditation retreats, and they do not cut off my circulation at all, in addition to being warm, comfortable, and ideal in weight.  I have washed many times with no unpleasant surprises; however, I also always line-dry my wool socks to maximize their lifespan.  I have just reordered these same socks after blessing them many times on a long retreat in chilly weather. The colors are also crisp and nice- truly black, lovely rust, soft gray. I highly recommend them if you want warm socks that are also comfortable with no risk of elastic pinching or tightness."
5.0,Meets our requirements of covering nose and mouth. Easy to clean and breathe through
5.0,He likes that they are much easier to put on and take off while giving the support needed for edema.
5.0,"Ordered my original size, fits great fit. Very comfortable and soft"
5.0,"There are other leggings like those made by Valandy that I love, but they don't have pockets. These pants have two deep pockets on either side which are great for holding my iPhone on one side and my dog's poop bags and small wallet on the other. I like to keep track of my steps using my iPhone, and these pants make it SO easy to do that. I bought the 3-pack and am purchasing another pack. I wear these every day to walk and to work out. They are very supportive, comfortable, and well made. They have stood up to lots of washings. I wear a size 4 or 6 pant and the medium was perfect. I love these pants and highly recommend them."
5.0,"Fits great and is super cute! It's actually a thick material. But, if you are looking for a baggy sweater this is not it, it's more of a snug one."
5.0,"Fit well, soft, comfortable, and cute. Shorts are long enough to wear around the house, without being too long. Crop top is the same; short enough to feel cute, not so short that I'll scar my kids."
5.0,super comfortable and fits great
5.0,"I am 5'6, 125 pounds the leggins fit a little bit big on me. Really good quality, good for the price not too thin, colors just like the picture  very confotable, highly recommended."
5.0,Perfect fit and great price. This band is every bit as good as the original.
5.0,"I wear it every day, looks great!"
5.0,I get lots of compliments when i wear this. It looks like linen once washed a couple of time. I think they use different fabrics for the different prints though
5.0,"I really like the fit of this shirt. I'm a medium/large/size 10 and a I really like the fit of the medium. The fabric isn't as soft or stretchy as I was expecting, but I still really like it."
5.0,These shoes are light and comfortable.
5.0,Luv it. Gorgeous
5.0,"Super warm!  I love these wearable blankets!  This one has cuffs so you can cook etc without the arms flopping around and getting dirty.  I have washed it and it still is just as soft and cuddly.  I washed it inside out, with the colors setting on the washer, and dried it as usual in the clothes dryer.  I did add fabric softener and it was fine.  I've had problems in the past with the sherpa losing its softness after one wash and this one is still perfect! =)  I am a size medium and 5'6"" and it hits below the knees.  Oh!  there are fake snaps on the sides of the pocket that don't come undone!  It doesn't hamper the kangaroo pocket at all."
5.0,Purchased for our daughter's birthday and she really likes it! Nice weight to it and very comfortable.
5.0,I bought this for my Son for Christmas and he loves it.  He works outside all the time so he needed his boots to be dry when he goes to work.  He says they are great/1
5.0,Love it. Fit perfect
5.0,"fits true to size, get loads of compliments!"
5.0,"Size small, fit nicely; good quality 100% cotton shirt. All buttons sewn on securely."
5.0,"A little long on me so will be hemming it to my needs....but love the dress!  So soft and flowy.  I’m 5’5”, 125 lbs, 36 inch bust.  Aside from the length (which is a matter of personal preference) the medium fit perfect. :)"
5.0,Omg I finally found a yoga pant that fits me well I love the high waist and supportive but not tight fabric. I haven't washed them yet but I'd they do really well in the wash I'll be purchasing more maybe one pair every week until I have 10 pairs. I work a physically active job that I need to look somewhat nice for these panst with a cute top will do the trick for sure!
5.0,"Perfect for Florida weather..throw on over t-shirt..Many, many compliments..Ordered in white also..Thanks Coofandy..love your clothing..<br />RP"
5.0,Great shirt. I got this for my brother for Christmas. The shirt fit great and was exactly as advertised. It was super cute and geeky. He absolutely loved it!! All around Great product. I would buy again.
5.0,Esta muy padre lo k pasa k las bolsas las trae solo dibujadas
5.0,"Excellent buttery soft leather and even better in person.  I found these shoes to run true to size however, it was very difficult to put on the first few wears - it has stretched ever so slightly since, but still feels a little small.  I would recommend going a half size up."
5.0,These are great!! I ordered a size medium and they fit as expected. I am 5’5 175lbs wide hips ladies and they hug every inch!! Waist:29 Hips 40inches and the medium fits great. I certainly will be ordering different colors immediately!<br />I have ordered soooo many different brands of yoga pants throughout 2020 since there’s nothing else to do but these are now in my top 5!
5.0,Good quality.  My daughter is happy with them.
5.0,Been looking for a replacement for my mismatched rings for a long time and these did the trick.  At first I thought they were too large (in width not gauge) but I was used to it pretty soon.  Able to get the balls in and out without issue.
5.0,"My boyfriend luv this robe. I'm going to have to get me one for myself, it's  veryyyyyyy comfortable and very soft. I totally recommend this!!!"
5.0,"Order one size up for perfect fit. I wear a size S normally, but ordered a M, and it’s perfect 👌🏽 Looks just like the picture and the quality is great. Like a spandex/polyester mixture so it does have stretch to the fabric."
5.0,Super warm. So warm I had to take it off. Works great.
5.0,"LOVE this fan, love it can be charged!"
5.0,This is a beautiful necklace and a wonderful gift I give this a 10/10 and it’s  adjustable
5.0,"A lot bigger then picture, great deal $"
5.0,This product was wonderful. All my bracelets and necklaces look beautiful on it. And it also added a nice touch to my room. Loved it and recommend it.
5.0,Great google love it
5.0,"I saw this dress in a Buzzfeed article and I had to have it.  I got it, and I love it.  This is my summer dress.<br />It's comfortable, not see through, and versatile.  I like to pair it with a belt for bit semi casual look for the office.  If I am just running errands, I leave off the belt and pair it with a nice pair of sandals or canvas walking shoes.<br />This is a really cute dress."
5.0,"I had ordered a size up and I am glad I did. The material is cozy, the design is not  like a  &#34;normal&#34;night gown and that is what I really like."
5.0,"I bought this shirt for my son in a 2 colors. He’s pretty picky about the way his shirts fit and he loves them. He is tall and slim, and the  sleeves are definitely long enough for him – which is sometimes hard to find.  The neckline is perfect, not too loose-  not too tight.  I ordered another one recently for him"
5.0,"I really love this dress. The material is great, and the cut is flattering, especially on a curvy figure. I liked it so much that I ordered a solid black one jut like it. The material on that one is disappointing and stiff even after being washed. Stick with the paisley dress and you can't go wrong."
5.0,I love these bottoms. They fit great and had great coverage. I also found that they didn't ride up the bottom like most others do these days.
5.0,Comfort is great
5.0,"Thick, comfy, and fits true to size"
5.0,"I ordered these to replace some similar Jockey briefs that were starting to wear out.  These are a bit lighter in terms of fabric weight, but they’re fine.  They’re comfortable!"
5.0,Bought this choker for my grandson.  Love the ease of adjustment.  The price is right and he loves it.  Highly recommended.
5.0,"These things rock! I'm 5'2, and other compression socks are too long. These fit just right and really help with my shin splints from running. I bought all the colors since they're so comfy 😊"
5.0,Excellent buy. Spacious interior and very sturdy. Love this bag.
5.0,So pretty and elegant. Love it.
5.0,"Absolutely fantastic. It’s the NATO I’ve always wanted, the webbing material is more comfortable and far better looking than other nato bands I’ve bought over the years on Amazon, and the hardware appears to be very durable. This is the one you want. I immediately ordered another one in a different color."
5.0,awesome  bright colors and quick delivery  Thanks!
5.0,I am a cat lover and think this shirt is funny.  I wear it out and about with jeans.  I've had lots of positive comments.
5.0,Came really really fast.  Ordered it on a Wednesday paid regular standard shipping & got it 2 days later on Friday.  My only disappointed is the chain length cause I don't know chain sizes.  My husband wears a 20-21 chain size so not to have one to big I ordered size 16 thinking it would be just right.  Although it is not to tight I would like to have it a little bigger.  I am not a big or tall person only 5&#34; half inch tall but would recommend more like an 18 or so for a better fit.  I would recommend the necklace & seller.
5.0,Love the way these leggings fit.
5.0,I love my new sunglasses. I was a little hesitant to order sunglasses online without trying them on first but I read the reviews and decided to give these a try. They did not let me down. I got the red/yellow/pink with the silver frame. They are true to color in the picture. Fit great. The hinge feels stronger than lots. I am very happy with the purchase.
5.0,Perfect used for Halloween costume
5.0,Very nice bracelet just what she was looking at.
5.0,"It fits perfectly, feels good and a great way to look fantastic while biking!"
5.0,Great tux for an amazing price.  We bought this for my son's senior prom; he is quite tall and lanky so there were initial concerns on sizing.  Customer service was very helpful with answering any questions and helping me decide on sizing.  Everything is perfect it fits him well and he still has a little room to grow into it.
5.0,"My husband runs with these. They are wonderful and make him look great! Also light, dry fit and airy- just great for exercise"
5.0,Great price for two of these.  I have one by my bed for my glasses - keeps them safe from breakage.  The other one I actually use in the living room for the remote control
5.0,"I wear a 14, I got a LARGE PLUS"
5.0,I love the style was bought for my niece.  No dislike.
5.0,"So adorable!!! We had my granddaughter's 2nd birthday party yesterday and she got to wear this. Only problem (for us) is where she's tall, we had to put leggings on with it, but I was able to find the exact shade, so they looked like they went with the outfit. Very pleased with the purchase."
5.0,Nice strong product
5.0,Loved absorbancy and warmth.
5.0,very pretty adjustable size  I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN
5.0,Loved it so much bought another one.
5.0,I took these to my grandson's and granddaughter's birthday party at school.  It was a hit!!!
5.0,"I am 5’ 8” tall, 145lbs. chest 39”, waist  31” inseam 31” a small fit me perfect. A medium was way too big. I would say the quality is excellent."
5.0,"The pants are very comfortable and have a good ""modern"" slim fit similar to the big brands. They aren't nut huggers but they do hug the body well. I'm 5'11 205"
5.0,"These are absolutely amazing! Came with a case, small screw driver (Phillips and flat head) small enough to fit on your keychain. You can really tell just from the packaging and information on the business that they truly care about customer satisfaction!"
5.0,quality shirt fits great feels great excellent pricing
5.0,I liked the Hawaiian shirt. Receive many positive comments.
5.0,Really great to prevent headaches and eye strain! They’re very stylish and great quality as well. Great product would buy again. Comes with cleaning and repair items as well.
5.0,i love the skulls and hearts
5.0,"This is one of the few Asian products that are really true to size that I've bought before. I decided to go for an XL because I am chubby and in the end it was way too big for me should have gone for an L and I have big shoulders and wear bra size 38 as well as big hips too and it still fit well enough. I have a pear shaped body though but it is very true to size and fits perfectly, if you are not sure whether to get an XL or L I hope this gives people a better idea and it really does look like the picture and actually good product 5/5 would buy again."
5.0,Firm support in all the right places. I’m buying another one!
5.0,I loved it! It's worth buying.
5.0,These are a bit heavy. In w<br />The winter that was welcome in MN
5.0,I think this hat is awesome! The colors are exactly the same as the pictures in the description and it's very well made.
5.0,"Really happy with this set of luggage! We have taken it on 3 trips and it has been in the snow, road trip, and moving to a new home! It's sturdy, the zippers work great, the color is nice, and the wheels work great! Love love love!"
5.0,"light material, stretchy almost<br /><br />5'8"", 220lbs, 40dd.. ordered a 2x:)"
5.0,The sock are good! True to size and fix fine. They aren't really thick but not too thin either.
5.0,Adorable!!  I love them.
5.0,going to buy more colors
5.0,This is exactly what I was looking for.  For an inexpensive necklace the piece had good weight and didn't feel too cheap.  It was appropriate for the price.
5.0,These sandals are adorable!  Fit as expected.  I got several colors and always get compliments
5.0,"The dress looks amazing on my mom ,its really good quality ,good customer service.It is a little to big .My mom is plus size and its just perfect on her .You will not regret going with this company .Delivered wayyy faster then said."
5.0,The elastic is nice and stretchy. The fabric is also a good quality. I was impressed for the price
5.0,"This sounds too good to be true but it really works - I polished some old jewelry I haven't worn in years and it took off the tarnish in just a few seconds.  Couldn't believe my eyes honestly - those liquid ones never ever work so i gave up a lot of jewelry and just kind of stored it away... saw this cloth on a Buzzfeed list and was like, eh it's cheap why not try it other people swear by it, and now I do too. Definitely worth it!"
5.0,"A friend wore these to my house and I had to find out where she found them.  They're just so cute with the cut-outs!  I was happy to hear she found them on Amazon, and she also mentioned she'd bought a size large, instead of Medium, which we would both generally wear. These are great for wearing everyday with a longer shirt/tunic, cool and fashionable.  I bought another pair of ODODOS, with the pockets, and they are great for walking, hiking and working out.  My IPhone 12 Plus fits in the pocket!  a real plus for hikes.  I've probably washed them 20 times, and they still look and feel like the first day!"
5.0,"Fits true to size. Very comfortable fabric, love the pockets."
5.0,Perfect for a quick 80s look
5.0,I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. It fits her perfectly and it's held up for the couple months we've had it. It keeps her very warm and looks stylish too.
5.0,"I love, love, love this watchband. It fits my Huawei perfectly! I did have to take out six links, but you would never know it. The tool provided worked like a charm in removing the links without damaging the band. And the butterfly closure is invisible. I would give it a sixth star if I could. &lt;3"
5.0,Nice quality and really smooth - good purchase.
5.0,These are really cute! I got lots of compliments on them.
5.0,Daughters were pleased Christmas morn.
5.0,beautiful bracelet fits my daughter
5.0,My favorite top i love this
5.0,This bathing suit is super cute! I was worried about buying it after all the reviews about the chains breaking but I had 0 problems and the chains on mine were sturdy. Make sure you buy the proper size or even size up one and the chains shouldn't be an issue.
5.0,Cute & light weight!
5.0,"I love it. It’s soft, comfortable, generous, and seems well made. Looks cute too. The color was just as expected."
5.0,Love these flats! Comfortable and just cute.
5.0,My 3 year old grandson loves them!!
5.0,I got my necklace. I looks just as the picture. I get so many compliments when ever i wear it. Its a must have
5.0,If you take your shades on and off. And you don't want to lose your shades. You got to get a pair.
5.0,Loved These!  Definitely not for someone who doesn't want to be noticed. They are large and in charge - perfect for someone who wants fashion at a great price!
5.0,"Great sweater, fits well and very fashionable!"
5.0,This pack is on the smaller size but for his books and he likes it
5.0,"a little big, but my daughter is really small. But now that she's grown a bit, it's adorable."
5.0,This pj set fit all my girls amazing they all had the size small and it fit them perfect.
5.0,"True to its size and it’s light weight. Love how it feels. Looks not so much. But trust me, you will not regret this purchase"
5.0,I think they’re beautiful. My go to earrings right now. I often forget to take them out at night and have had no irritation at the piercing site like I do with some other jewelry.  Seem high quality to me.
5.0,"Fashionable, fits well and fairly well made. Thin material."
5.0,"Hey Guys, Don't let the title throw you off, I got two pair for myself and I love 'em. They fit well under my hoodie sleeves when I don't want to wear gloves and I can still do fine work when I need to and they keep my hands reasonably warm. If you watch &#34;Outlander&#34; you will see some of the men wearing them too.<br /><br />Brian"
5.0,I am 5’6 175 lbs and a n xl is almost too big... but fits just right. It has a little stretch not much. It came with a hole in the back of it so I need to see it up but overall a beautiful dress. Spanks are needed to keep everything nice and tight! Lol. Slit in front almost comes up too much. I will be seeing that up some as well.
5.0,"If you wear Birkenstock type, cork soled shoes, you really ought to buy this product. I've been wearing Birkenstocks for over 20 years, and I always use a cork sealer. It definitely extends the life of the shoes. If the seal is broken, the cork gets dried out and starts disintegrating. So try this product to protect your investment.<br />  I originally used the Birkenstock cork sealer, but I couldn't find the paint on kind anymore. So I tried this and it seems to work just as well."
5.0,Nice selection of charms. Perfect for rainbow loom.
5.0,Had it for a couple months now; it’s one of my favorite watches to wear rain or shine.
5.0,"These undies are very soft, comfortable & supportive. Highly recommended. However I've been wearying these a couple of months now & I still don't look like the guy in the pictures. Is that false advertising?"
5.0,I love this watch band! It has bling and a matte gold finish. It is absolutely beautiful and looks expensive. I had to adjust the size and doing that was so EASY using the tool provided in the package with the band. I am going to get another one in the Rose gold.  Great purchase!
5.0,I bought these for my 7 year old for his Halloween costume. He LOVES them! He’s worn them several times since Halloween. He says that they’re very comfortable and cozy. Lol. Highly recommend.
5.0,"My height is 5.2ft  my Weight 123 lb.<br />bought an L size.<br />Faldo and so tight that I don't fit.<br />The front pocket is really neat.<br />The delivery was slow, but the goods were really good."
5.0,Love this shirt bought 4 more
5.0,"I received last week my pair of earrings and are just lovely. I will buy again from this seller as they have an excellent service. This pair of earrings have the 9.25 silver mark and are well made and a little heavy as you can expect from Murano glass. I do not like big or heavy earrings so it took me a while to decide if I should order it stud or dangle. Finally I took the dangle option, I'm so happy with the size, earrings are great, and I'm so glad as are an affordable and amazing option."
5.0,Received my sunglasses in a nice little carrier and a cloth for cleaning the lens. When I first got them they were pretty flat and felt funny on but after a little bending they are super comfortable. The lenses have the perfect about of darkness. Can't leave the house without them now!
5.0,Nice soft hat
5.0,"This dress is perfect! Light and comfortable , easy to iron and really flattering. For reference I wear a size 12 solid top and bottom and I am 5&#34;4 . I purchased the large and could have purchased the medium for a more fitted look. See pic."
5.0,"This is a cozy sweater-tunic.  It is a very dark blue, and the designs are really cute and eye-catching.  I am 5'5&#34;, about 135 lbs. and usually take a medium (US) size, and this fits very well.  As a tunic with leggings it looks great, and is quite warm. I would love it if they had various colors/patterns."
5.0,"These are so well made!! The quality is really good and the size is just perfect, not too big, not too small. The only thing I noticed is that these might be on a bit heavier side, I could definitely feel them when I put them on.<br />One of the wings kinda sticks out a bit, which gives the earrings more of a 3d look. Overall I'm so happy with the purchase!"
5.0,Ordered for a gift... nice gift packaging.  Received quickly and packed well.
5.0,"This would be a simple LBD, but the sleeves elevate the style. They're fitted until just above the elbow, then bloom into a full, puffed bell. The boat neckline is very flattering, though the collar lining may not stay in place. The fabric is a midweight knit with stretch. The zipper is very thin and hard to grip. You may need to pull the dress over your head to avoid the hassle. The fit is true to size. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size. The medium fit me perfectly.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."

5.0,"Handy compact money, key, credit/debit card holder"
5.0,I sized up one size and it fits perfect. I love the colors on it and how long it is on me. I am 5'10 with a long torso and this shirt is long enough I dont need to layer it.
5.0,"Easy to assemble, great and easy fit, love the small increments adjustment. Best belt I ever bought."
5.0,My daugther love it!
5.0,I love them and will buy more!
5.0,"I’m 5’7 152lbs and very curvy, the dress fit perfect except the chest part. I am a 32a so I had to get the top taking in some. I wore this for my 30th Birthday and OMG the color was amazing. The shipping was fast as well."
5.0,Love these...fit to size and are very comfortable.  Plan on buying more!
5.0,"I really like this shaper it worked exactly as intended. Wore it under a tight floor length dress for my sisters wedding. Fit great, got a size medium. For me the straps are the best part because shapers always start rolling down for me anyways. Overall great product"
5.0,I placed an order and received the package the following day.  The band loops were exactly as described and at a great price.

5.0,Absolutely gorgeous! A dings but not big and hardly noticable. Just make sure you know it's only one set of two plugs.
5.0,surprisingly good quality- kids like these
5.0,"This swimsuit is FANTASTIC! I'm 5'3 150lbs and a 36DD. I feel confident in this suit and can't wait to wear it Out! It's very well made,  I haven't worn a two piece in years and couldn't be happier!"
5.0,Love this evil eye scarf.
5.0,Beautiful dress!  I did take it up about 3 inches......
5.0,Perfect goggles . thanks
5.0,"A great purse that's fits what you need - without having to carry a big purse. Three compartments that you can fit cell phone, and other items you need. I also used one for small glasses. All three compartments zip separate which keeps everything organized and easy to use."
5.0,"Stylish, fits well and so soft! Love it."
5.0,"Lanyard that represents my ride, very comfortable, I can finally get all the keys out of my pocket.<br /><br />BuckleDown also threw in air freshener as a gift, thank you!"
5.0,"I needed to get away from the full-sleeve wet suit and this was perfect , fits really well and is pretty comfortable for a wetsuit. Looks pretty cool too which as we all know triathletes care about"
5.0,Love it! Stretchy and comfortable
5.0,"In person it has a more flower design then what it looks like in the picture, just makes it more feminine but thats good for me. Its very neat looking, the clockwork looks awesome. So far keeps time very well. easy to wind. One full wind up lasts About 19 hours as far as i can tell. The only issue is that the front cover for the watch is actually plastic. Very nice plastic but still plastic. It doesnt look plastic but it is lose and you can spin it and when tapped sounds plastic. So it looks awesome just dont let people tap it. Very Very Very nice for the price."
5.0,Sweet and thoughtful to give to someone you love
5.0,This item is so comfortable nice and warm will definitely buy other one in a different color.

5.0,Cute sandals !
5.0,The daycare requires the children to wear mask but I felt that a shield would work best and these do a great job of not hindering the teachers view and the child speaking.
5.0,Fantastic deal!!!!!
5.0,"Great glasses and good price, good service"
5.0,"Make sure you measure the height needs for your watch. This replacement is very clear, and the date window is clear"

5.0,Great quality and fit perfectly. Highly recommend.
5.0,Easy to work with. Fits perfectly and sublimation results are beautiful on it.
5.0,"VOCHIC Winter Warm Fleece Lined Cable Knit Slouchy Beanie hat looks and feels great! I bought a total of 3 hats, 1 for me and the other 2 for gifts. The pom pom is big and fluffy. What is especially nice is the super soft fleece lining inside the hat that keeps my head and ears extra warm, especially where I live in Minnesota it's nice to have!"

5.0,fits perfectly I am 5.4  110 pounds
5.0,This coat is long on me and I’m 5”9 so If you are short it may be to long. I live the length on me and I know it will keep me toasty warm this winter. I’m excited for the temperature to drop so I can wear it.
5.0,"My grandson loves Spiderman, enjoys the hat and the gloves!!"
5.0,Like everything about it. I have the 44 mm Apple Watch.
5.0,up to expectations
5.0,Bought this for my wife. Looks great on her. Super sexy. Size is true.

5.0,COMFORTABLE Y CORDINA BIEN CON JEANS!!
5.0,"First, my tale of woe. I have arthritis in my back and neck and bursitis in both my hips. I also have had surgery on both my feet to correct arch issues. I struggle to find shoes that not only are comfortable, but allow me to stand for over an hour and still walk the next day. It's a problem.<br /><br />I've worn prescription orthotics that were over $400 and so hard I could not touch my feet at the end of the day because they hurt so much. I have tried gel pads. I have used special shoes. I have even started wearing compression socks at the age of 41. Nothing has really solved the problem.<br /><br />In 2019 I decided to buy this pair of inexpensive inserts from Amazon and see what happened. Quite frankly, I liked the name of these, Snapsmile, so I ordered. They arrived, I shoved them in my shoes and now on March 20, 2021, I am just now thinking they need to be replaced. Here is the thing, I can wear my sneakers and spend the day in the kitchen without any horrible residual hip pain. The arthritis in my back does not flare up because my feet and legs have not been supported all day. These inserts actually work. They are simple, inexpensive and super easy to wear.<br /><br />The only one drawback is they do make my shoes squeak when I walk, but honestly, I do not care. For $15 and two years of pretty solid pain relief from severe hip bursitis and arthritis I will take the squeak."
5.0,"The dress is perfect for an office outfit, is very comfy and well made. I purchased 2 more HOMEYEE dresses, I recommend this brand. Also te price is perfect!"
5.0,Awespme
5.0,"This is a first impression review that I may update as I continue to wear the dress.<br /><br />I am a curvy girl. 5'9&#34; with 41/38/46 measurements with a very poochy tummy and this dress looks fabulous on me! I have a hard time finding bodycon dresses that flatter my body type, especially around the middle. But this flatters my curves in all the right ways. I will say that I do need shapewear to feel 100% confident in the dress, but that's more of a personal hang up rather than a failing on the dress.<br /><br />The material stretches perfectly and feels comfortable on the skin. Even though the dress is predominantly polyester, it doesn't feel too hot.<br /><br />If you're looking for something that accentuates the curve of your hips and thighs, definitely get this dress. You'll feel just like Joan from Mad Men!"
5.0,"I was very surprised when I received this in my mailbox today. The package was a little crumpled but I think that that is because I have a very small mailbox. When I opened up the package it was folded up very nicely and it had no wrinkles. But, as soon as I opened up the actual bag that the sweater was in, it had a very musty smell to it. Otherwise, the sweater is very nice. It is a little thin, but I expected it to be like that. It was a little bit big, but I think that that is because I ordered it a size bigger."
5.0,My wife LOVES how big and comfy it is!
5.0,it was for the boy i was with at the time he loves it its super soft
5.0,"they're cute, they're socks, they don't have any lumps in the wrong places.  I like 'em"

5.0,"I put them on when they arrived. The quality is very good. The style and color are very good. Kids love it. Very attentive, five star high praise"
5.0,very light weight will be great for spring
5.0,For the money I was surprised at what a nice watch this is.  My grandson is a train nut and he is very happy with this present.
5.0,My girls school is a panther school and they wear their shirts whenever the panthers win
5.0,"I got the one with a black top & polka dot skirt - it is so soft and comfortable I feel like I'm wearing PJs, but I look like I'm ready for a day at the office. Seems well made and the fit was perfect. I'm a 14-16 and ordered the large. I am going to order more in different colors & patterns."
5.0,I love mine. Exactly what I was looking for. Great Quality and roomy. Has a slot for everything. One of the best purchases I made for myself. With all going on during the Christmas season I need to be able to get to what I need and easily suits my need. Looks great also.
5.0,Great for the price will give 5 stars but the shoelace on one boot is cut and not usable.  Is a gift so don't want them to have to return.  Possible to get a shoelace? Thank you
5.0,"Love this jacket. Perfect for Spring or Fall in the North East. I normally wear a Medium (4'11&#34;, 125) but based on others reviews, I ordered a large. The sleeves are about long, but otherwise it fits great!!"
5.0,"I was honestly shocked at what a nice shirt this is. It is made of nice material, and packaged as a nice dress shirt - with neck form, and folded perfectly with clips and cardboard keeping it in place. The neck is very stiff (as it should be) and there are both black and clear buttons. I'm wearing this to a company holiday party under a tuxedo jacket and I am SCREAMING with excitement since I opened the package."
5.0,Fits great! Nice for golfing!
5.0,"Wonderful summer dress, fabrics great, resist wrinkling and over Fabulous! A must this summer."
5.0,I like it! My girlfriend said it's so cute! I have socks for winter now ~~~~
5.0,I paired it with a sparkly brooch and received tons of compliments. Arrived quickly as well
5.0,Great for the price. Really pretty and small enough that my mom doesn't feel silly wearing the words mom on her ears :P
5.0,I ordered the blue and it’s exactly as described I bought a xl for reference I am 5’6 and 36 D and 10 waist and it fit perfectly. Will definitely order another in a different color! It’s super soft and I can’t wait to wear it when it gets cold out.
5.0,They came faster than expected! Pretty ! And I am so excited
5.0,"I love these earings, great quality for the price, i def wanna order more colors."

5.0,The shirt is well made and the fit is as expected.
5.0,"Red is just pretty and bright. This dress, the ruffles make this dress look sweet, but, yet, it's still age appropriate. Material is on the thicker side, which makes this dress nice to wear, it doesn't cling to the body, or, show all of your imperfections. Made/sewn well, color retains in the washer. Nice piece for the office."
5.0,These hats are super cute and worth the money overall!
5.0,I will know more as I use it. It takes some getting into but once there it works well.
5.0,"I wish it were a little heavier for when I wear it long, but it's very cute and well-made!"
5.0,"I love this dress. Very comfortable and cute. If anything, maybe a touch larger than expected, but very flattering."

5.0,Wash hands everyday wearing the ring no problems will not turn your finger green rust change colors nothing i have  purchase alot jewelry from this seller all outstanding purchases i had 1 ring for 1year still on my finger
5.0,"Just as described.  Material is thin, you may want to wear something more than a sports bra under.  But it is reflectorized, which is why I bought it, and you can always wear it over a t shirt or a long sleeved shirt in cool weather"
5.0,Appropriate workout gear or street appropriate
5.0,Perfect for wearing to interviews and if you work somewhere that doesn’t like facial jewelry!
5.0,"I wasn't sure what size to order. People in other reviews said that it is small,too short sleeves etc. I'm 5.7&#34; and slender build. I've ordered S and M to see what will fit better. The difference was soo small I could go either way. Eventually I've kept M just because I will layer it under. I love how it feels and looks. Someone said that the collar was not as pictured but I totally don't agree. It is very close to picture. Sleeves are not super long but it is the style and you can see it on the picture so no complains here. Leather gloves will do for a colder weather. Overall I really like it and I'm starting to be a fan of this brand because I've ordered couple things already and they are pretty good quality."
5.0,Received a lot of compliments for this! No complaints after few months of use
5.0,I liked this product because they are comfortable and fit just right
5.0,A roomy one person tent for impromptu jaunts into the woods when we stay longer than planned. Be prepared!
5.0,Purchased these socks to wear with my new Scetchers and they fit perfectly!  The socks are just adorable.  The colors are adorable too! They fit perfectly around my toes and shoe length.  They wash well in the washing machine and dry well in the dryer.  Have been using these socks to workout in and walk in for several weeks without any issues.  They have worked out well and have held up well too.<br /><br />Would recommend to my fellow shoppers!
5.0,Great compression socks for running!
5.0,Fantastic for the price.  Girlfriend loves it.
5.0,Gauges were very lightweight and look exactly like the pictures.
5.0,"Buy this dress! I bought the long sleeve option and adore this dress. I got SO many compliments on this dress, there is room for forgiveness. There is a dress on Lulus that is very similar, but this price can’t be beat. I purchased a large but could have gotten a medium, I wanted to make sure it was long enough with my heels. Large fit great!! Was not loose. 5’3 150lbs, muscular built"
5.0,"Comfortable, love the support it provides to my mid section. Exactly what I was looking for. Does tend to roll down a bit though."
5.0,does not need arch support as yet
5.0,"Fits nice, alttle big. Arm holes are modest."
5.0,So pretty i love it ❤️
5.0,"Love this item. It is way cuter than the pictures. I am so glad that I got this. It is the perfect size for me. Fits my phone and my debit cards, driver's license etc. The strap is long enough to be down to my hips, which I like. Wonderful product."
5.0,Bought this as a gift. Beautiful craftsmanship.
5.0,I ordered this locket and it is beautiful!!! Very high quality. I know my niece will love it. Buy it. It's lovely.
5.0,Love it. Looks very classy and simple.
5.0,I bought this men's slipper as a gift.  and the person loved them.  Said they are very comfortable. and he can wear them outside too
5.0,"There are a lot of unhappy reviews with this item so I'm going to try to clear some things up so you know exactly what you're getting when you purchase this.<br /><br />I ordered this in the green and mine is very much like the picture. It's a very beautiful kimono. I actually like it better than the one in the picture. Mine is a soft watercolor periwinkle blue (the picture on Amazon makes this color look more purple), green, and white and the colors are extremely flattering. It is not sewn all the way down under the arms, instead it is simply sewn only in one spot directly under the sleeve leaving the rest of the sides flowy and open. It comes to a thigh length point on each side in the front and the back also has two longer pointed sections on the outer parts that go down nearly to the back of the knees and it is shorter right over the butt. It does cover the butt completely. The sleeves come down to just above the elbows.<br /><br />I am 5'6&#34; and weigh 195lbs and the XL fit me perfectly. It is not as long as it is in the picture nor is does it cover as much of me as that one covers her. But I'm perfectly happy with mine and it looks just as amazing over a white tank top as hers does. Maybe even better.<br /><br />I hope this helps you all to see what you will be getting if you order this. It does take a full month to get to you but for this price and for how pretty you'll feel wearing it? 100% worth it!"
5.0,Dog ate package but missed the band ! Mailman should’ve known better but product missed its fate! Lol

5.0,"fits perfectly, ball doesn't fall off. GREAT."
5.0,This is a beeeeeutiful summer dress. The material is soft and the print is vivid and atttactive. I’m a size 12-14 depending on the dress so I just ordered a 2XL and it’s fantastic! I will be ordering more from this company!
5.0,"Super cute , love it !"
5.0,"Stats: 5'3,"" 143lbs, 34C, 23% body fat. Bought size 8. Absolutely LOVE this bra. The material was the first thing I noticed when I put it on. Its super soft and feels like it isn't even there. It is quite supportive and doesn't pinch anywhere that I've noticed. Im currently putting it through the wash since I got it today and hope it holds up well. The back is really cute! I bought this one and the one with the thin strappy back and I love that one too. The strappy back would not be something I'd wear doing any kind of cardio. Would definitely recommend these two bras if you're tired of paying 60+ on a bra but still want good and comfortable quality."
5.0,I give it high reviews because it is a nice product but the color did not match the way it said it should very disappointed other than that it' of good quality.

5.0,Bought this for my husband. He is a tow truck operator. His original band was badly bent. This has been perfect! Super sturdy and is meant for a hardworking man. The cables on the side of the ring made it perfect since he works with cables.
5.0,"This is an awesome suit. It's classy but unique. I was surprised at the quality! I bought the smallest size that was available, knowing it would be too big for my son. It's not too big, and still looks sharp. This suit is what convinced him to go to his Semiformal!! Love it!!!"
5.0,Just the color. Beautifully made. May be I’ll give as give to another owl lover s.
5.0,Got rid of the tarnish on my silver jewelry.  I bought a product prior to this which was like a wet wipe and a cloth but it didn't do very much.  This cloth sorted out the tarnish.
5.0,"I’m 5’11” with long legs and long torso. This swim suit is super flattering. Maybe slightly short in the torso, but not enough to make it uncomfortable."

5.0,"Good, summery earrings.  Just the right size."
5.0,"5 stars!! These socks are super duper thick.. so thick that you will not be able to wear any tight shoes.. but they are so warm and comfy. I like to wear them around the house to keep them from freezing. Through carpeted floors to tiles to hardwood, my feet stay warm and cozy throughout the night. I like this pair so much that I’m planning to get another set for my husband. Highly recommended!! 👍🏻👍🏻"
5.0,"I really like the purse; it is small on the outside but you can put lot of stuff on the inside, so the size is perfect then. Apart from that, it is really beautiful and easy to carry."

5.0,Looks just as great as pictured.
5.0,"I love it and it fits perfectly onto my Panerai 44mm case watch. The leather quality is superb and soft much better than other straps which I had bought at about the same price ranges. With the price of $35, I would probably buy another colors of straps so I could exchange the straps frequently. Good quality tang buckle tool."
5.0,"I bought this for my mom for Mother's Day, she loved it. It has leaves on it and it is a great summer bag!"

5.0,It is ok . I like it .
5.0,"I wear 7 1/2 shoe. Small is the right size. I now own 6 pair of these. Absolutely love them. They are great, hold shape, stay up.....perfect. I bought one pair originally and then kept buying. Now I buy as gifts for friends."

5.0,"I've owned Ray Ban Erika's for many years and, after trying on my wife's DeBuff pair, realized they almost feel more sturdy than Ray Ban. Lenses pop out kind of easily when cleaning so don't push too much when doing so - if they pop out, they're quick to pop back in. Overall 9/10."

I had purchased a pair at the store for a lot more than I paid for these 3 pair and I can say with certainty that these readers are a much better quality product. I would recommend these without a second thought."
5.0,"Can’t believe we waited 7 years to try these! They are a must for anyone with afos or difficulty putting on standard shoes!! This is our first pair, but will definitely NOT be our last!"

5.0,"Everyone needs a little black dress.  I have a few but this one caught my eye.  I love the lace arms on it.  It really dresses it up but not to much that I can't wear it for a casual night out as well.  It fits perfectly on me.  It's not to tight, but has a nice flow to it.  Makes you look great in it.  It has a v shape neck line.  This dress should be hand washed and dried to make sure that it lasts.  This dress is made of good quality material and came at a great affordable price."
5.0,Great use every day
5.0,Watch band looks great! Easy to install.
5.0,"I absolutely love these boots. They are perfect in color and very comfortable. I am a bigger person and my calfs measure 15.75 inches at the thickest point. I ordered a size nine. When I tried on the boots my calf size prevented the boot from zipping up all the way; however, the zipper did stay zipped to the point where it stopped. All in all, even with this hick-up I would still order these boots again! I am extremely happy!"
5.0,Really like this top. Fits as expected. Cool chiffon material is great for the summer. The accent on the color is just enough to add elegance for evening wear. Love!!!

5.0,Many people commented on how cute it is. A big hit.
5.0,Fits like a glove.  Nice and lady like.
5.0,its a ring and its a good price and it arrived quickly
5.0,I reviewed this dress and received it at a deep discount. I was very excited to review the stress because I thought it would be the perfect addition to a summer wardrobe and like the flexibility of changing the tap to look more appropriate for different types of social situations. I have included pictures of three ways I have worn the dress and how I assembled the top. I bought a size medium and I'm 5 foot 7 inches tall. It fits me perfectly but if you were shorter than that it would drag on the floor in this size. I do recommend making sure you have white or neutral colored underwear on underneath as any type of colored or print would show through on the light. I used a sports bra with the dress but you could put a tank top on underneath to cover up a bra. I am not one to go without support so I did not try it without a bra on.<br />If you look in the photos you will see there is a full length mirror behind me so that you can see what the back looks like when I have it tied each way. Some ways will show more skin in the back than others. If you don't like that then I suggest wearing a tank top underneath. I think it is a good idea to look at reviews on here and see pictures of how other people have worn the dress.<br />I am excited that it fits me perfectly and can't wait to wear it on a girls weekend and this summer.
5.0,This is very attractive and a little heavier than thought but I LOVE THE EXTRA thickness. Its great

5.0,Soft cozy sweater for work or anytime comfort.

5.0,I have the long black rope version and I am using it as a men's bracelet. It is definitely long enough for a 7.5-8.0 inch wrist. The clasp on mine is very good and does not come apart easily but there is no locking mechanism. The leather seems to be good quality and has not separated or broken during daily wear. I enjoy wearing it.
5.0,"This hands down my favorite sweater of all time (and that’s saying something). It is incredibly flattering, warm, and not too itchy. I live this sweater so much I have it in two colors and I am contemplating a third. I get a lot of compliments when I wear it. It accentuates all the right things."

5.0,I really love this bracelet.  Doesn’t look cheap.  Will be my new go to bday/Christmas gift to friends/family.  Gets snagged on clothes sometimes but no big deal.
5.0,Nice watch. Good quality. I had a small problem with the wristwatch that was promptly resolved by the Burei watches team. Great service specifically Alice.
5.0,I am a huge Taylor Swift fan so I was excited to receive this in the mail.  I have listened to nothing else but this CD.  The hat fits perfectly and is super cute.  I wish they had different option for the shirt but I recently bought a sweater so I can’t wait for it to come in the mail.
5.0,"The stitch costume is soooo cute, and the quality is good. lots of people ask me where did I purchase it when I went out on the Halloween."
5.0,"Very cool, got this for my boss, she always does a cute little meow when she passes you lol she loved it!"
5.0,"I dithered on ordering this bag and even after I pulled the trigger, I figured I’d end up returning it.  No chance of that!  This is a great price, and the bag is very, VERY nice.  I normally prefer an open tote style bag, but needed a little more structure in my current every day carry bag sine I’ve begun vaping again in an effort to quit smoking and don’t want my devices banging around.  One of the open leather lined slots has a double pocket sewn in which is perfect for that and so far hasn’t shown any signs of stretching out yet (I’m looking at you, Dooney Florentine Amelie). The zippers are smooth and the turn locks are beautiful, even if I don’t find myself using them that much. The leather has a heavy grain, which I’m guessing helps with it keeping structure.  I’m able to fit my small wallet, giant keychain, TWO hard shell glasses cases, vapes and juice, cosmetics, small sketchbook and other items without feeling like I’m carrying a piece of luggage.<br /><br />One thing I will mention, the pictures show a metal hang tag, but mine is leather. That sort of set me aback at first, but I do prefer leather, and I think the photos may be of the larger version. The discrepancy had me mildly worried at first, but there’s no way this bag isn’t authentic.  Also wasn’t too impressed with the shoulder strap. I’m not using it, but I think it will be serviceable for hands free, if needed."
5.0,"I bought it for my 6 year old, expecting it to be cheapy costume jewelry for the price. But it's very pretty, my daughter loves it and it seems sturdy so far."
5.0,He loves these PJ's!
5.0,There is an anything I didn’t like about it.  Going for a second one.
5.0,Get so many compliments on this dress. Fits great!
5.0,So cute. I eventually want all the colors
5.0,Love it! This bra is a little different from other seamless bras that I bought online or in stores.<br />The pad inside the bras are a little thick more like push up pads which I like.
5.0,"Fabric is soft and luxurious ...fit is perfect, hugs without squeezing."
5.0,Really good fit and some cushioning and warmth. I recommend buying!
5.0,"These are exactly as pictured. I love dangling earrings, but hardly ever find them in clip-on. These are SO CUTE!! The crystals are really pretty and they are really delicate and comfortable to wear. I ordered two pairs, as I tend to lose one earring at a time; two pairs makes 3 pairs when you do that!! :)"
5.0,it pushes the girls up nice but not very flattering under certain clothing
5.0,"I ordered this as a gift for my son in law and he absolutely loves it (hope he’s not just saying that), but he truly seems very happy about receiving this."
5.0,The wallet is a perfect gift! My six year old son loved it! It would also be a great gift for older kids/adults as well. Its a normal size wallet. It has a zipper part for change if you'd like but we use it to keep his dollar bills due to there not being an actual place like a regular wallet to put the bills.
5.0,Absolutely gorgeous! I love how it complements my curves without feeling restrictive. so soft and flowy too!
5.0,"Good deal, love them.  bought for my nephew"
5.0,"This device is the one that finally made it easy to get my medic alert bracelet on.  I tried several other ideas from magnets to a stand I rest my arm in, but it was this one that did it: the clip gives me pinpoint control over one end of the bracelet which makes connecting it to the other end (which I can hold with the fingers of my other hand) a short simple process."
5.0,I just got them And I for one love them they fit good feel good look good I'm a happy shopper thank you
5.0,These are so comfy and worth buying. Fit perfectly on me.
5.0,"I have a 23"" waist.....I never would've known. I'm not overweight so I can't give an accurate review as far as that but I do have loose areas from my 4 kiddos and although petite and pretty easy to hide due to my stature with oversized clothing... I'm nearing 40 and dressing like a hip hop reject is basically no longer an option. Plus it gives me the motivation to try to achieve this shape thru exercise and a healthy lifestyle. There is a lot of material. It's actually a bit intimidating at first but it surprisingly (my first time using this style cinch) is very smooth under clothing and creates an extremely flattering shape. I would and likely will buy again. I wish it were available in other tones such as tan or nude or flesh etc."
5.0,I ordered a XXL instead of my normal XL for a roomy baggy fit. The legs were a little long. It works for me!
5.0,I like it because fit my iPad and pretty
5.0,"These are crazy comfortable right out of the box and I expect they'll be my go-to shorty pants throughout the summer.  They do run a little large, but I expected it going in and purchased one size under what I'd buy for a pair of jeans.  I'm short and these fall just below the knee.  They came with the hem pre-rolled, but not sewn, so you can adjust as needed.  Lucky Brand comes through again with comfort and cuteness."
5.0,"I love this dress! The shape is cute and the pattern is fun for the work Halloween party! I would buy more! I will say that I am very busty and this was a bit low cut, so i just added a cami to keep the girls under control ;) I got the XXL. I'm usually a 14/16 or 16/18, 5'6"", and a 36H bust, if that helps with deciding on a size."
5.0,"Awesome hat and kept my head all warm during winter. Also, it ships from Great Britain, so the delivery takes some time. But, nice quality product for the wait."
5.0,Comfortable and not too hot
5.0,Cute to small for me but really nice
5.0,Long sleeve but not hot to wear
5.0,Very comfortable. Great fit. Bought a second time and very satisfied with both purchases. Thank you
5.0,Loveeee this dress! A little longer than i expected but over all super cute!
5.0,They are Beautiful.... :))<br />I love it......
5.0,"I looked for a good deal of time for a skeleton dress watch and I am truly happy I purchased the Dorado. After over 2 years of ownership it still looks great (actually the watch looks better in person than it looks in Amazon's pictures) and hasn't skipped a beat. I am always amazed at the number compliments I get when wearing it. This was my first watch with a deployment style buckle. It took a little while to get used to it, but now I think it's the only style of buckle I'd have on a watch. No more dropping the watch on the floor when trying to put it on and it also keeps the leather strap from wearing out at the buckle. The watch also comes with an impressive wood gift box. All things said I give the Dorado a 5 star recommendation for quality, value and good looks."
5.0,Perfect- Will buy from again! Awesome Product!
5.0,Perfect for craft show magnets
5.0,Good way to get others involved
5.0,These are perfect!! Can't wait to start some tye dying! !!!  ;)
5.0,Super comfortable. Especially like the length.
5.0,I took a chance with this dress as reviews were mixed reaction but I'm glad I took the chance.perfect beach dress and you can also wear it on casual get together.just order one size up.
5.0,"First I'll say the plastic case part was WAY bigger than I expected. That said it's otherwise an excellent bag, I use it almost every day. It's so convenient to pop out out, pull out the bag for my purchase, wind it back up at home, and pop the case back in my purse. The bag is large and a great size for errands, and sturdy. The strap is a good length, it can go over your shoulder for easy carrying. It's nice it comes with a caribeaner so the strap can't be retracted into the case (and probably it has other uses, like... clipping on to things). I've gotten many positive comments on it from people at the check out.<br /><br />Really great purchase, I'd buy it again in a heartbeat."
5.0,"I just received them so I have not been able to wear them golfing yet, but they are so comfortable."
5.0,It does what I expected it to do!
5.0,This is a really nice blazer! I was a little nervous because there was only 2 reviews and no pics but I'm glad I ordered this. I'm going to be super cute in this for the fall. 😁
5.0,Nice lunch bag especially since I have to take both breakfast and lunch.  It works great.
5.0,Perfect in the length and weight
5.0,"This sweater is very nice all around: 100% cotton, form-fitting yet not flimsy or clingy. I've already ordered a second one."
5.0,Way better than I thought they would be. Impressed.
5.0,Fit just perfect. Sexy yet classy!
5.0,Fir is good
5.0,"Love this purse, it looks as it does in the pictures, it is good quality and durable, it is actually more spacious than you would think from the pictures. I recommend it and its a great value for the price"
5.0,"I went by the size chart and got a Medium since I have a 36"" bust and it said up to 37"".  Although I thought the dress was VERY CUTE, it was way too tight!  I am not a big busted gal but this dress was even hard to get on and off.  Next time I will order a Large.  The style is pretty and the fabric is sturdy yet lightweight enough for a cool summer or spring evening.  Order a size up!"
5.0,"The sunglasses are perfect. They're exactly what I was expecting. Now, I'll just need to relax in my robe and drink some White Russian!"
5.0,My grandsons is going to love this
5.0,"Fits very well, looks good."
5.0,"These yoga pants are a finely textured grey--not a flat grey, truly heathered.  It makes them look like a good pair of wool slacks.  But they are not.  They are very comfortable, stretchy leggings that fit well and will go with everything.  The fabric has a finer feel than the typical yoga pants, it almost feels ironed, which may sound a little weird, but you will understand when you try them on.  I am very impressed with these pants.  They look too nice for the gym, could fit in an office.  I recommend them."
5.0,"Very cute and sturdy shoes. My daughter adores them, I’ve purchase 3 pairs and even had my daughters friend’s mom order some for her daughter too.  My daughter is a girly-girl but loves to play rough.  She only likes Mary-jane type or slip-on shoes cause she can put them on quickly and go, the problem with those types of shoes is they make her feet very stinky!! She’s had these shoes for about 3 months and they DO NOT make her feet stink, SCORE!!! They are very soft rubber, no redness or blisters they have a sturdy button like clasp that my 3 & ½ year old has figured out. Would absolutely repurchase. **Make sure you choose whatever size your child is currently wearing, the shoe will read a different size when you receive it, assuming because they are made/sold in other parts of the world (that has a different measuring system) but the shoes will fit fine as long as you choose the correct size at check out, the company will figure out the equivalent size ."
5.0,Love this dress!  It is a little short but I know to be careful who I bend over in front of. So cute and soft.  I bought a small and I’m 5’5 and 118 lbs if that helps you decide what size to pick.
5.0,Very comfy head warmer not to big and very warm highly recommend to anyone!!!
5.0,Bought  costume for my 15-year-old son. He absolutely loved it!
5.0,Very comfortable and easy to embroidery!
5.0,"My first attempt at underwear with sack support/separation and I can say these are awesome. The balls slide right into place and stay secure, but not smashed like traditional briefs. I just ordered 4 more pairs. I’m a size 30 waist and the small fits perfectly."
5.0,it is nice and soft
5.0,I bought this charm for my granddaughter. I thought this would be appropriate since she has joined the national guard
5.0,Lo compre para disfrazar a mi perro
5.0,Banana
5.0,Fab and stylish sunglasses. Has the crisp and clear view I need for the bright sunlight! Perfect fit and same amazing Guess quality!
5.0,My gf loved it!  It's absolutely beautiful
5.0,My son loved it!! I got him a size 6 because he's a giant 4 year old and it fit him perfect!
5.0,"This ring is awesome.ive had it over 2 years and I wear it every single day work ,doing dishes.everything.no complaints here and about to get another for my other hand.."
5.0,It fits true to size but I ordered too small after finding out that I’m actually a bigger size. The dress was so beautiful and great quality but I have to return it. I’m also going with a different theme for my wedding or I would have exchanged for a different size.
5.0,Well fitting. Comfortable. But one size up.
5.0,I've already made 3 pairs of earrings with these
5.0,It's a great shoe! I have many of the brand.
5.0,I've been looking for a watch that I could wear for when I'm biking to work.  My regular watch was feeling to tight and uncomfortable in the summer heat and sweat.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was how light it is.  It's very light and you hardly notice that it's on at all!  The silicone material is extremely flexible and was very comfortable.  I like that there are so many holes to adjust the size...sometimes you'll want to wear it really loose and sometimes very tight.  The display is bright and can be seen in direct sunlight.  It was easy to set and easy to use.<br /><br />I think this would make a great gift for someone who is really active!<br /><br />I hope you liked this review and found it helpful. I had the opportunity to purchase this product at a discount or for free in return for my honest and unbiased opinion. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and I receive no incentives or rewards. This item was used and tested before I reviewed it. My comments are sincere and are my own opinion!
5.0,"I love them. They fit like tennis shoes and don't slip off my feet like danskos. They also come with shoe laces of you prefer to tie them up but I like them as they are, the slip on variety"
5.0,Perfect little add in gift
5.0,"I bought these for my Bellatrix Lastrange Halloween costume, and they were perfect!"
5.0,Cute keychain great protection
5.0,Great dress...we bought it as a costume for a play - (the character is Water) and it worked perfectly.
5.0,"They feel really really good on! They snug around my legs perfectly and there is no pinching at the top of the sock. My legs aren't swollen after my 12 hour shift at the hospital. They feel more like a regular sock, I need to buy some more!"
5.0,"Justo lo que quería, pequeño pero hermoso 🤩 lo he usado asta en la regadera y no se ha echo feo ,<br />Lo compraría otravez!"
5.0,"Love the fit. Super flattering. I have a 36DDD chest, and I had plenty of room in the &#34;L3&#34;  If anything, It's almost too roomy in the waist. Very comfortable.  Very short, but I think that's sexy"
5.0,I am very pleased with the earrings. I was worried they would be too big but they were small enough. They arrived two days later than were suppose to be here. But all in all am happy.
5.0,fit perfect! exactly what I was looking for. Perfect for a rainy day to keep warm.
5.0,"I used to travel around the World quite often on business and kept one of these handy because every now and then when you find yourself in a remote obscure country or location there are people who try and sell gems they mined. I would use this along with an electronic tester. Good product, very compact."
5.0,"This is a great product!! It is durable, does what it says and arrived on time."
5.0,I bought this for our water delivery truck. It came in perfect shape. Well stitched. Couldn't be happier!
5.0,Larger mask compared to others I have bought. Thick and comfortable.
5.0,the ear rings are small and very pretty. may even be prettier than the pic
5.0,"These pants are some of the few that actually stay up during my yoga practice. I have them in some of the heather colors as well as some of the solids. The solids are a bit less comfortable than the heathers, but they both do great for workouts."
5.0,"The shoes are beautiful and comfortable, they fit true to size. Highly recommended!!"
5.0,"Stylish, cute, very light and comfortable. It’s not see through. I would definitely recommend it for a comfortable and stylish skirt:"
5.0,"The first word that comes to mind for these shorts is comfortable. The shorts feel quite flexible yet the linen gives them enough body so that they maintain their shape and don’t get stretched or baggy or wrinkly like shorts made of pure cotton or pure linen can get. In other words, you can wear these shorts through a variety of activities and they will still look crisp and fresh at the end of the day. The cord in the waistband also about a half-inch wide which means it is less likely to get twisted or to cut into the waist.<br /><br />Perhaps because of the relaxed fit style, the shorts seem to run slightly large, so if you sometimes straddle sizes, I’d recommend sizing down. As for the color—in this case, dark blue—it is true to description and the product photo shots. It’s a deep blue—almost black—that is rich in tone. It also washes well without any bleeding, as can be the case sometimes with deep colors."
5.0,"Great pair of plugs, no heart as shown in the picture but they fit week and are not too heavy"
5.0,Like the variety of colors.
5.0,"these googles are GREAT!, I like the fit and easy on/off clip on the back, I would recommend. swim cap is also a good fit.<br /><br />see pictures posted.  This is a quality product and I give it a 5-star rating!<br /><br />I hope you found this review Helpful."
5.0,loved the quality wasn’t expecting for it<br />to be as good as it is. leather holds up great with my everyday use. no peeling or separating of any kind.
5.0,Gorgeous A real statement  piece.  Good quality.
5.0,My daughter ordered this for my wife and it was delivered and neither one of them wear it. Money well spent
5.0,My granddaughter LOVES it and wants to wear it every single day.
5.0,I've been looking for the traditional red and navy bandana in SILK and HERE ARE!  They are perfect and my cowboy is happy!
5.0,Works perfectly at a great price.
5.0,Love these. Decent thick material. Not the thin crap I’ve have gotten off here. Holds up well in washer. Great with leggings and comfortable!  I bought this in two colors and actually sized down one size for a fitted look and had no issues being too tight
5.0,Always loved these shoes.
5.0,"Way too small because so much padding -  but so cute, I'm a 9-9.5 and I gave them to my mom who is like a 7-7.5 she loves them and even wears them in public LOL so they get 4 stars for making mom happy"
5.0,"Blouse is beautiful, love it but it’s to small. Received partial credit and kept it will give it away I’m normally a larg or extra large in this type but the xtra large is still small other than this it’s great quality for the price you can go wrong."
5.0,"I am able to wear the skirt long, to my ankles (I'm 5'7"") or hoist it up to my chest to create a dress. I bought the skirt to keep my legs warm in the winter and actually pull it up under my sweater so it's a bit shorter and easier to go up and down the stairs without tripping. Works really well! The fabric is soft and so comfy. I accidentally threw it into the washer and dryer (warm and warm) and it shrunk a little, just in the length. In a way I was glad for the shrinkage because the length for me now is perfect.<br />I can see that this will also be a perfect summer ""dress"" fitted over a cami or T shirt."
5.0,"nice wallet, lots of storage, got it in several colors..........wears well over time"
5.0,"Love these, especially for the price. Will be buying in other colors!! Size is exact, in my opinion."
5.0,"I was skeptical ordering it but when it arrived and I tried it on, it was a perfect 10!!! Very comfy and you can dress it up or go casual if needed. I will order more in different colors. For the price that I paid for, I should have gotten a dozen. The material is very soft and looks durable. Great buy from Amazon!!"
5.0,I love this dress!  The neckline is indeed sexy!  Will need some fashion tape for sure!  Love the flowiness.  Bought it to wear in France in a couple of weeks.
5.0,A bit pricey but well made and does not tarnish. These are regulation size.
5.0,VERY NICE!!! My Friend Loved it!!!<br />Can't give pictures because I gave it as a gift!!!
5.0,good!I have brought two already.
5.0,They are for my 2 month old great granddaughter. So we have no feed back from her.
5.0,Fits well. Love it. Love the pocket on side.
5.0,Loved it.  Really good size.
5.0,"Great looking, and fits a full sized hat perfectly."
5.0,I liked the whole set but it looks ivory to me and I need it to be pure white. I am using it for my wedding. Heart broken only because of the color
5.0,Wore these  glasses while visiting Israel where the sun is brutal.
5.0,My mother loved it! Its dainty and cute!
5.0,"good quality, exactly what I wanted"
5.0,I followed the size guidelines but it was pretty big and fell off my shoulders. I could have gone down 1 and possibly 2 sizes.
5.0,Best thing ever for a man who wears dress shirts
5.0,Love it so pretty just like the pic
5.0,Ordered this for my daughter.  Loves the blue color and that it fits nicely on her head.  An added plus is the chin strap that will keep the hat from flying off on a windy day.  She’s happy that the brim also covers her neck as well.
5.0,This is a beautiful dress. The fit is perfect and I'm super happy I purchased it.
5.0,Great product it does exactly what is supposed to do I was surprised to have so much room they actually fit!<br /> I have big feet and big shoes but they are perfect
5.0,"This is a great summer dress! Fabric is very lightweight and well made (I bought the white one and it is see-through at the bottom so will need something under) I am 5’11” 145lbs and find it difficult to buy summer dresses bc they are always too short! This fits great, length is perfect at just below the knee and the pockets are a definite plus!!"
5.0,Fits really well. I am 5'5&#34; about 130 lbs and I got a medium. It fits great!!!
5.0,"This skirt is soft and comfy. So surprisingly adorable on, too! Exceeded my expectations!"
5.0,"Brilliantly cut stones. Cute little gift box. Open setting allows light to dance off of the facets, and eases cleaning to keep them brilliant. Their just the right weight and don't pull on your earlobes. I adore my 7mm set! It's just enough to prompt a double take from your friends and for them to ask &#34;are those real!?&#34;."
5.0,"Great looking watch, so light on the wrist."
5.0,i am very happy with the item
5.0,I bought several of these. They’re super cute and comfy!!!
5.0,So comfortable! And I love the pockets
5.0,I bought this as a Valentine's day dress for my daughter. It is a little big compared to other companies sizing  (You may want to size down if your child is small) but the quality is great for the price and it's a very cute dress. I recommend!
5.0,My wife put it on her bracelet instead. Looks good.
5.0,Needed Wookie teeth for holiday family photo. They worked fine and every loved the pic. Nice to have this option when its not halloween time.
5.0,"Very pleased with the fit, the product and the service"
5.0,My Wife liked the ear rings (very much)...
5.0,"I love these shirts, as does my 4-yr old"
5.0,"Love it, true to its size. Finally something that fits"
5.0,Great pants the price!
5.0,"My girlfriend love this watch, it's elegant to use when she is wearing dress but also seems pretty good when she is wearing casual cloth (especially if she is also wearing some rose gold jewelry, like a necklace). The only thing you need to take in count is that is not as easier to adjust as others, but you can accomplish this as well."
5.0,Great bag.  Love the color and the space is more than adequate.  I will probably use this for travel.
5.0,"I bought this last year in tan with a black bow and navy all over this year.  A girl got to have choices.  The brim is perfect big without being rediculous.  I have a large head and this fits perfect.  The interior has a band around, underneath the one on the outside, but it is adjustable by pulling the string that is inside that band and pulls it snug without being visible.  Thus staying put and Boston is windy, so this keeps it snug. And if you have a larger head this is great.  Yeah, if you have a smaller head I might not choose this."
5.0,Soooo cute...great customer service!!!
5.0,"Love these gloves. Love that you can easily take them off because of the strings between the fingers. I will never own another pair of cycling gloves that don’t have that feature. I had never seen that before and at first thought that it was something that needed to be cut off. Then when I went to take them off, I realized what a great thing is was. They are comfortable and a great fit."
5.0,wow great puse. very well made
5.0,It's adjustable and fits my larger wrist. Have worn it several times without problems.
5.0,"I got the black, navy, and taupe set.  When I revived them the colors were different.  The navy that looked royal blue in the picture was more of a navy/dark purple and the taupe that had a more pink hue in the picture was more khaki/ tan.  I still like both of those colors but I still kind of wanted the royal blue color.  Unsure if i order another set with other colors how they might differ from what I'd be expecting."
5.0,I love this umbrella!!! It covers my whole deck so my family can get plenty of shade. A++++
5.0,These are a must have with your muck boots.  Quality
5.0,Very cute dress!!!
5.0,Cheap in price but not in quality.
5.0,Works well on tile and hardwood.
5.0,"EXCELLENT lenses, great quality and perfect fit. Very happy overall."
5.0,"This shirt was perfect for my Cobra Kai-loving son to wear for his birthday :) Or any day, really! We always do a birthday shirt that matches the party theme and this was great for that, my son really loves it. Good quality image and fabric, and fit overall is absolutely perfect, but that was also because I sized up. It's not often mentioned in these reviews so I'll say it: it runs small, size up. My son is a M (10/12) in everything, 4'10""//81 lbs.//11 years old -- we bought L and it fits exact. Almost bought a M, but so glad we didn't. Size up!"
5.0,"It's my first time buying a dress from bebe. I must confess, this dress is too cute. I like the way it looks on me."
5.0,Excellent fit and form. Perfect length. All backed by Amazon company.
5.0,My husband loves these. I bought them as a gift and he says they are comfortable and for great.
5.0,"I'm a silver earring girl, so I saw these and wanted them pretty much right away.<br /><br />The bar is bigger than I expected--about the length of a heavy-duty staple and much thicker. The cool thing about that is that if you want to use these as a kind of statement piece, you can twist the way the bar lands on your ear to make it visually look like you have ""staples"" in your ear lobes. They also work just wearing them vertically.<br /><br />Only downside is that I don't find them comfortable to sleep/nap in--the end of the post pokes my skin.<br /><br />Ultimately, if you're looking for something that's suitable for both the office and casual occasions, that's a bit dressier than a stud earring but is incredibly low-maintenance and not too flashy, these will be great for you."
5.0,"My 4 year old looked so cute in this, it was soft and fit her wonderfully!"
5.0,Very nice for the price!  Good size
5.0,"My 9 year old daughter loved these, they look fantastic, but I bought the wrong kind...needed indoor not Turf.  So I am returning.<br /><br />Definitely recommend these for Astro Turf or hard packed ground."
5.0,"These overalls are not only cute, but comfortable and ""hide"" a belly. The material is slightly stretchy and relaxed so it's not too stiff when you bend or sit. Absolutely LOVE them!"
5.0,Adorable!  My 7-year old son loves them!
5.0,"These Olukai sandals felt incredibly good from the moment I first slid my feet into them. Smooth, perfect fit, Olukai superior arch support. Did I mention how good these sandals look with a pair of coconut colored pants and shorts from Crazy Shirts?"
5.0,Beautiful looking well constructed comfortable out of box desert boot that fit my 9.5 E fit just fine.
5.0,"I'm 127lbs and I bought a Med, they were perfectly comfortable ...not too tight , love them!"
5.0,I didn’t do the custom measurements. I got the size 12. I had to get the top shoulder altered because I kept losing weight. I put a dress cage under. Perfect for my Selena themed birthday party.<br /><br />Beautiful dress great quality. It is heavy.
5.0,"Great holds cell and smokes easy access, just be sure when you put it on it’s not backwards when backwards zipper appears to be inside out"
5.0,"Good weight, solid but not very heavy. Easy to snap it closed. Unlike many other earrings, stays safely closed. Very well made with simple, but smart design. Very happy with this purchase."
5.0,A little pricey but so cute! I bought as a coverup but wear it more as a shirt with skinny jeans and ankle boots.
5.0,Wow me encantó cómo le queda a mi esposo. Muy buena tela . Estira y se ajusta bien a su cuerpo.
5.0,gift for my daughter  it was very nice
5.0,"These worked perfectly for my high school reunion “hippie” night. They matched a headband I had ordered and I got lots of compliments! So light, I couldn’t even feel them when wearing."
5.0,"Great and stylish top. Has a built in bra with removable padding. Really comfortable top, a great buy."
5.0,Really like. Feel protected
5.0,It is very nice however we had to use a peptide under it to make it fluffy.
5.0,GREAT FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER#
5.0,"The design is crisp, exactly what we were looking to get, and it’s comfortable.  Lightweight and perfect for layering. This ships from out of the country, but with planning we received it before the special day we needed it."
5.0,"Fits well, good product"
5.0,These could probably get me anything I want lol
5.0,Very nice.  I like the solid feel and the weight.  The wrist strap is a nice quality too.  Elegant design and features
5.0,"This top is really cute! I think the model looks weird with long sleeves and short-shorts. I know people do that sort of thing all the time. And, as a curmudgeonly old person screaming people off of my lawn I say: It's weird. But, the top is flattering. I imagine the whole choker neckline is a fleeting trend, though. At least it wasn't too pricey. Thumbs up!"
5.0,All as expected!
5.0,Great gift m granddaughter loves them.
5.0,My wife loved them. They go great together.  Also the Sterling silvers helps because it doesn't bother her ears
5.0,"I rarely leave the house and most times wear pajamas all day. I have been ashamed in the past if someone came to the door. No more! Love these PJs, these are my 3rd pair. I can wear them proudly to the door and out on the porch and have never been more comfortable. Love, love,love!"
5.0,This is much nicer than I expected for the price.  The engraving is sharp and clear.  The charms have a good weight and thickness to them so they won’t bend.  And there’s a little velvet pouch for presentation.
5.0,This dress was adorable on my 3 yr old! Fits true to size!
5.0,This tunic is perfect! The quality is awesome - it's nice and thick and well sewn. It falls and fits exactly like the photo. I am just under 5'8 (the models height) and so the length hits exactly where it does on the model. Don't expect it to be that length if your 4 inches shorter...these aren't custom pieces ;-)<br /><br />I'm glad they're finally back in stock (though more money now...sadly). I'm going to buy the other two colors. Love the pockets!
5.0,"The suit is good for swimming laps or lounging. It fits well and does not ""ride up""."
5.0,"I can load up a lot of groceries in these bags. They're super strong, making plastic bags obsolete. Plus, really cute designs to choose from."
5.0,"I would say it you want a fitted look, go a size down. Other than that this blazer looks amazing!"
5.0,"I got these for my husband who’s very active. He runs, and works out with them on and loves them."
5.0,"I have a 7yr old grandson that is into Ninja and I think he would love to wear dog tags.  Haven't given it to him yet, coming up."
5.0,I love these nose rings! I got the 14g even though I got my nose pierced with a 16g and I love the size!
5.0,Bought time to match my husband royal blue tuxedo and we look great together!  Love the stretch in the fabric.
5.0,I get compliments every time I wear this.  It’s comfortable.  This is the second one I’ve ordered.
5.0,"Medium fits to true medium. I'm 5'4, 130lbs and it fits great!! Shows off all the right curves and hides all the wrong ones! Not to long, but not to short! *knee height* Thin material, and very soft. I can't wait to wear it :)"
5.0,These are so cute!! Vibrant and beautiful just like in the picture. Thumbs up!💞 laaa laa loveeee
5.0,my son is fired up about these shoes! he said the shark is even cooler than he expected. I love that they are so easy for him to put on.
5.0,My adult daughter requested this ear cuff for Christmas.  She was very happy to get it.  She loved it so much she posted herself wearing it on Facebook thanking me so much for buying it for it.  Despite us buying her other more expensive gifts...this one was so obviously her favorite.
5.0,"Very flattering and comfy. Fabric has a little bit of a sheen to it. I'm 5'1"" and it comes down to my fingertips, so it will definitely be shorter on someone who's more of an average height"
5.0,"Bought for my boyfriend, looked so so so good on him. Material felt very nice, wasn’t too thick or light. Buttons were functional"
5.0,Yes.. I purchased this as a gift for my sister she loved it.. It very pretty but made very well.. I may purchase one for myself!!
5.0,"Looks great, my son really enjoys wearing them and they look up to par with more expensive ones like Under Armour."
5.0,"Wow, what a beautiful band! If you are looking for a &#34;aged&#34; or &#34;worn-in&#34; leather band, look no further this is it! I'm particular about my brown leather bands. I like the caramel or lighter brown color and this manufacture got it right! Don't listen to the one other reviewer who says it's not genuine leather. The margin of the band is bonded with material to close off the leather so it won't fray! Some people just don't know what they're looking at!"
5.0,My boyfriend goes through socks so quickly but these really stand strong.
5.0,"These earrings are adorable, and they look really good when you wear them. They were secure and well maintained. The service was exceptional, and I highly recommend them."
5.0,"This product was light, comfortable, and very cool to wear. Everyone commented on how nice it looked. The product is high quality."
5.0,Perfect gift! Very comfy with great fit. They are worn every day and he loves them.
5.0,Present for my son's birthday
5.0,Super cute earrings! I can’t wait to wear them next Christmas! Ha! The ones that are clearly not Christmas you could wear anytime of the year. They are a good size if you don’t mind them on the larger size.
5.0,"works great! dogs love it!very durable! it will last long if it used exclusively for tug time. do not let them chew it, thats not what it was designed for."
5.0,A holiday gift for my wife. It is a wonderful product and design. Quality very high. I recommend.
5.0,Muy bueno. Me gusto
5.0,TTS - soft and comfy!
5.0,"we had a pair of like new boots that were used for a litter of mice last winter, these new inserts are perfect, just like the originals."
5.0,I love the shirt...its not sweater material but rather a insulated t shirt types... very stylish and comfortable
5.0,Bought for a friends birthday she loved it!!! It came perfect as pictured !
5.0,Very light-weigh stroller for those who want a simple and easy to use device.
5.0,"I am so happy with my purse.  It's well made, spacious and had just the right amount of storage areas.  (Wish there was 1 outside pocket, tho.)  It's beautiful and just the right size too.  Love it!"
5.0,"Very comfy!  Especially, if you have a big shaved noggin’ like mine!  The material is softer than most and wide enough without rubbing the top of my ears."
5.0,"Very pretty, I am happy for purchasing it."
5.0,"Fun holiday dress, my girls looked adorable!"
5.0,These are super comfortable and fit great. I also love that they have pockets.
5.0,Very good quality and fit the bracelet for the brighten charms
5.0,These are the best!  Can’t wait to order more!
5.0,"Love them. I wear it all the time, it gets wet and stays looking nice."
5.0,"Classy, looks great! watch came in, it was a little loose, but I didn't care, you can either fix it or have a little slack. The metal was covered in a protective plastic and the batteries were included. Really nice looking"
5.0,"Very slightly slouchy, and I like that! But I think it really depends on how far down you pull it on your head, like over your ears or not. Perfect shade of deep burgundy! Looks cute, and warm!"
5.0,"These are my new go to leggings! They are an incredible fit and quality for the price. These have high compression on the waist to hold you in but in a comfortable way, and also super comfy to lounge in. They aren’t see through at all and have great pockets. The material is a soft and cozy but not too thick to wear in a hot yoga class or around in summer.  won’t be spending the money in lululemon anymore."
5.0,just what it looked like she said she loved it.  only took a day to get it.
5.0,Está lindo mi hija mide 1.55 de altura y tiene 11 años  compré talla 12 a 14 años y le quedó súper bien
5.0,Super cozy and stylish
5.0,I will always stand up for the victims.
5.0,"I have played basketball competitively for nearly 15 years and in that time have owned dozens of pairs of basketball shoes.  I play a point guard/shooting guard position and the factors that matter to me the most when picking out a shoe are: comfort, weight, sole grip, and ankle support.<br /><br />Comfort:  These shoes come with a special foam insole that ""molds to your foot"" over time.  At first I was skeptical of how well this would work out, as my first days using the shoe they felt a little stiff and uncomfortable in the sole.  However, after about a week of play, the shoes really do develop a custom-fit feeling to them.  Another nice feature is the shoe's snugness; once you slip them on and lace them up, you'll notice that your whole foot feels like it's resting inside a glove.  You won't be able to slide around and you definitely won't feel like the shoe is going to slip off of you while playing.  The shoe is snug without being too tight or painful- a definite plus.<br /><br />Weight:  All I can say is wow! These are by far the lightest pair of basketball shoes I have ever owned.  I know there are some shoes out there that are indeed lighter, but in my personal experience the Kobe VI's really did a great job of slashing out unnecessary weight and taking a minimalist approach to this shoe design.  I feel like I can jump through the roof when I'm playing in these and I definitely don't feel like my feet are clunking down the court when I run in transition.<br /><br />Sole grip:  And what I mean by ""sole grip"" is the level of stickiness that the shoes have when playing on hardwood floor.  Some shoes do a poor job of providing players with friction when faced with a slightly dusty playing surface.  This can be the difference between making a  great defensive play or slipping and getting embarrassed by the person you are guarding.  The Kobe VI's do a remarkable job of staying grippy even on surfaces that are less than ideal for playing.  I really like this about these shoes.<br /><br />Ankle support: No one likes to roll an ankle while hooping and any basketball player will tell you that the most commonly sustained injury in basketball is a sprained ankle.  One of the best ways to avoid sprained ankles is to have shoes that offer sturdy ankle support.  Makes sense, right?  However, when picking out shoes you sometimes have to pick and choose what matters the most to you and what is going to be the most suited to your position and/or style of play.  Quicker, faster players (guards/point guards) usually like to have lightweight shoes that allow them to make sudden changes in direction without feeling bulky.  Stronger, more powerful players (forwards/centers) usually prefer shoes that have really high ankle support.  With this in mind, I would not recommend these shoes to a forward/center player.  The Kobe VI's are a low-cut shoe will not provide you with the ankle support you need to play one of these positions.  However, if you are like myself (guard/point guard) and do not mind sacrificing a bit of ankle support for less weight, while maintaining the ability to change direction on a dime, then these just may be the right shoes for you.<br /><br />All in all, I've owned my Kobe VI's for about 2 months now and I have really enjoyed the performance I have gotten out of them."
5.0,"As expected. A tight knit, large enough to cover the ears."
5.0,Beautiful ring.  Great quality.  Fast delivery.
5.0,Absolutely love this sweater! So comfy and true to size. It is just as pictured in the photo! ❤️
5.0,Love love love these shirts so much I ordered more and with all my medical and joint issues they help so much
5.0,The display dome was packed well and looks great.
5.0,"Works very well, bought two."
5.0,This is a good suit - fits well and sized as advertised. It's comfortable and good for swimming and water exercise. The back of the top is very cute too.
5.0,"I'm quite pleased with the bag, although it's a bit larger than what I anticipated and for what it's replacing - but that is my issue and not the seller's. The stitching is nice and the entire bag is well made. I'm confident this bag will last for at least several years to come, if not longer."
5.0,"Fabric was perfect, beautiful, comfortable, and just one of my favorite dresses ! Got a lot of compliments and it's adorable!"
5.0,I love this purse.  It is such a nice bag.
5.0,I love this top because it can be dressed up or dressed down. Downside it is super thin.
5.0,He loved the hat
5.0,"Great product, X Large is just right"
5.0,Adorable shoes. Fit perfectly.  Now my 2 year old granddaughter won't burn her feet on the concrete around our pool !!
5.0,I got a charm bracelet as a gift and wanted a SpongeBob charm. It's really nice and fits my bracelet.
5.0,"I purchased this cardigan to wear for Disney World's Spring Dapper Day. April at Disney is already quite hot, but this cardigan is thin enough that I was able to wear it all day with the sleeves pushed up without getting overheated. The purple color was exactly what I wanted for my Haunted Mansion Disney Bound and I bought a second one in black  for my Minnie Mouse Disney Bound. I am on the smaller size (34, 27, 34) and typically wear a small (medium if I want a loose fit), but after reading other reviews I ordered a size medium and it was just right! It was fit a bit loosely around the waist, but the bust, shoulders and arms fit well (I sometimes have trouble with sleeves being too tight, but they were very comfortable and a little loose), the sleeves were a bit long, but I folded them up anyway and had the waist tucked into a belt so it was no issue."
5.0,These socks are great. My hubby works outside all day and his feet have never been so warm. Super happy with this purchase.
5.0,Buy this. It fits so well. The colors are SO vibrant I’m blown away. It is a tiny bit sheer but honestly who cares. I don’t have a problem with the sewing or any mismatching. This thing is genuinely like a second skin.
5.0,Nicely made and exactly what I had expected.  The price was fantastic!  Not something you see everyday.  Love it!  I came very quick also.
5.0,Si me agrado muy bellos
5.0,I used this bag to go see Hamilton at Proctors.  It worked very well going through security.  It also holds a lot.  I’m glad I bought this bag and hope to use it in the future for other events.
5.0,Do not slip. Just as described
5.0,Excellent product.  Great for gym or outdoor activities.
5.0,I love geninue crystal
5.0,"The girlfriend absolutely loves this corset and it looks amazing on her. She finds it to be just the right amount of restricting, although she definitely can't sit in it for a long period of time. The length is just right as she has a tad bit longer torso. I don't know how she is able to adjust the lacing, but she does it with ease all by herself. Overall, she is very excited to own and wear it. It is very good quality and I suppose we'll be ordering more in the future."
5.0,Perk One: excellent packaging<br />Perk two: excellent case to store glasses.<br />Best of all: the product is high quality material with a very premium look.  Been catching a lot of looks with these.. Recommend that you BUY. Awsome customer service also.
5.0,Very Fab! You can wear it different ways
5.0,Works great! Only issue is that you have to keep tightening it to the desired width if your moving a lot.
5.0,I really enjoyed wearing this shirt it fit great! No complaints!
5.0,"I've been wearing this band for a couple of months now. It's comfortable. Also, with the way it's designed, it can fit a variety of wrists. All of the holes in the pattern are what the prongs on the buckle go through. I have a medium sized wrist and there is plenty of band left for someone with a larger wrist to use."
5.0,Absolutely beautiful necklace.
5.0,The shoes are very light weight and very warm.  Better than I expected - very nice.
5.0,"I'm 5,5 126lbs and have an athletic build. I love these. When I do squats or bend over you don't see through them. The fit true to their size. The color is great."
5.0,"Followed the instructions on the package insert and it went easily.  I have limited mobility in one leg and other ""no tye laces"" have not worked well.  So far these have been excellent, but it's the first day. UPDATE 8122020- I have 2 pairs of shoes equipped with the zero friction lace fitting.  I cannot say enough good things about these laces and fittings.  Easy to apply,  and have required little to no adjustments.  One significant issues that I have encountered with every different brand - the tongue never gets shoved down in the shoes.  If the tongue does get pushed down I can easily pull them where they belong.  THESE ARE THE BEST  No Tie laces available currently."
5.0,Go Broncos
5.0,"I am usually a 40c-ish, and I ordered the 2x bra. It fits nicely, with no slip coating on the inside. It came with an extender as well, which is always a bonus for those ""I ate too much salt yesterday"" days. The cups are soft and very supportive. The straps don't slip, which is amazing in and of itself. The fit is also very flattering. Highly recommend!"
5.0,"I put this on my key chain and I really like it.  The best part is my keys do not get stuck in  the ring,"
5.0,"I'm so excited to take Valentine day photos of my baby in this outfit. Absolutely adorable, good quality material and true to size"
5.0,"Purchased it for my son's halloween costume, but it was so soft and warm, he plans to use it as a winter scarf too."
5.0,I was amazed
5.0,"These are all very nice. I am every happy with this purchase. Great quality for the price! The only issue I seen is with one of the clasps on the adjustable shoulder strap. Which looks like either slightly tarnished and/or was not properly assembled correctly. However, the overall quality far surpasses that one issue!"
5.0,It's a very nice scarf that's super cozy. Love it!
5.0,Thank you! It came with a gift bag and card it’s a perfect gift :)
5.0,I take a lot less pain medication since I have been wearing this bracelet
5.0,"This little guy is hands down, my favorite watch I've ever owned. It takes a beating, it's dirt cheap, and it works. It's great for my smaller wrist, and I don't feel like I'm compensating for something with a gigantic watch-head.<br /><br />Seriously, if you're thinking of buying it, regardless of gender, just do it. It's the little watch that keeps on going. Hell, I've gone swimming in mine with absolutely no issues. And let's be real -- if you lose it or break it somehow, this little guy is under $15. 100% worth it."
5.0,So cute and soft inside and out.
5.0,They reduce the swelling and make my feet feel better. They are easy to get on and off. I have diabetes and they have made a huge difference in the swelling of my feet and ankles.
5.0,"Really wanted to be Captain Janeway for Halloween this year, and thoroughly impressed by this pip set. A much higher polish than the pips on screen, but great quality for sure. Packaged individually so they would not scratch one another in transit. The backs could be longer, I have to push them through two layers of fabric - but if you just have one layer they should be perfect. Highly recommend 👌"
5.0,"This is the perfect fit for skinnier taller women.I’m 5’6” 140 lbs.,not much curves.According to the chart I was supposed to order F2,but good thing I didn’t.I got F3.The pants run just a little small.I thought I might not be able to roll,but they don’t restrict the movements and are very comfortable.Not baggy and no extra material like other brands.Tighter fit makes it harder for the opponent to grab.If you go by the size chart order a size larger.I do agree with other comments,chart is one size off.I would’ve ordered F2 if I didn’t read the reviews."
5.0,Fits well uncomfortable
5.0,They will tear after a few washes but it's better than having sweaty feet.
5.0,"Unique chopper-style mittens with fabric gloves inside.  They are not overly thick, yet surprisingly warm.  Also they seem well made for a very reasonable price."
5.0,"Great value, good feel ... not too thick. will have to see how they hold up. I would order again,"
5.0,"The dress was beautiful, it just didn’t fit as expected and I didn’t have time to return it for the wedding. It’s not the best quality straps- mine broke when I was just sitting and messed up the lace. I doubt I’ll be able fit it. If I had time I probably would have returned it since it didn’t fit the way the pictures looked.<br /><br />UPDATE: The seller refunded me for my dress, but also offered to send me a new one free of cost. 5 stars due to great customer service!"
5.0,It cute and easy to use.
5.0,"Our 8 year old grandson really likes these, they were a Christmas gift."
5.0,was very happy with this outfit. Looks just like the picture and great quality.
5.0,Love these.  So excited to wear them next week.
5.0,"Comfortable, great colors, I love them! Want to buy again."
5.0,It was a gift for my granddaughter and she was thrilled with it
5.0,little larger than expected in the waist. but super cute style and design
5.0,Nice comfort fit
5.0,SO SO CUTE
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised with these leggings!! They are soft, warm and sooo comfortable.  The design is different and I got so many compliments!!!  Love them!  Order a size up and they will fit perfect!"
5.0,My grandson love it it looks just like his yorkie
5.0,This was a beautiful piece. I absolutely love it!!
5.0,Impressed with the quality.  My son loves the look and the lights and I'm happy it was so much easier than going hunting from store to store for &#34;batman shoes&#34; :-)
5.0,"I got them for her for Christmas, and my wife loves them.  She says they're nice and comfy."
5.0,Authentic and exactly as described. I was a bit concerned about getting fake frames. I am thrilled!  I just lost my pair of this frame and am so excited I found another pair. I am buying more this week!  Highly recommend!!!
5.0,Great value! We needed Minnie shirts for our Disney trip. They are good quality and fit well.
5.0,"Look great, easily snapped. Just what I was looking for."
5.0,Cutest cardigan! So comfy and flattering. Definitely recommend!
5.0,Such a great costume!  It came with everything and it was great quality....very impressed and so so so happy I purchased it!
5.0,We are going to Disney soon and got this for our daughter and she was super excited!!!  So cute and quality amazing!!
5.0,Great material feels cool fits great I always order 1 size up for my dancer have hips teenagers
5.0,I got a small. I’m 5’4 and 120 lbs. This fits great! It is a super cute sun dress. I love it
5.0,Great material very silky much better quality than expected
5.0,It just arrived today.  It took awhile to get it but it looks really nice with a colored shirt and blue jeans!
5.0,Hide-ees are my favorite. My daughter does not leave the house without a pair if she's wearing a dress. The fit is as expected. They are soft and comfortable. She has never complained about the fit. She is true to size. When she's on the playground I never worry about her underwear showing. They come in many colors. My daughter has pink and purple. I highly recommend these to parents in my preschool class.
5.0,"My LO loves them, we'll be buying additional pair"
5.0,My favorite shorts!
5.0,"I bought these little cute shoes for my 1 yr old. I love them, my son can only walk with these because of their soft sole, I highly recommend them for kids under 2 yrs of age. I will buy the next size up.<br /><br />Great shoes, thanks Komfort Kidz"
5.0,"Absolutely love the color, fabric and finish. Great product for the price"
5.0,Bought it to take on a long red-eye flight next month and I think I'm going to love this. The memory foam and the fabric cover are very soft. Looking forward to testing it out. Will update when I return.
5.0,"Great earnings,  only pair my other half will wear..."
5.0,"I was able to wear this comfortably all day with my holster and pistol attached.  I was using a heavy leather belt before, but this seems to be more comfortable and still able to handle the weight of my pistol."
5.0,"The color is beautiful and just as I expected. The interior lining is not satiny, but it’s not plastic like another reviewer said. I’m happy with the stitching and hardware. This price on a real leather purse is awesome. You can barely get a decent faux leather purse at this price and they don’t look 1/5th as nice. I might buy it in another color."
5.0,my favorite scarf.  goes with everything and very nice silk.  Love it.
5.0,This skirt is perfect. It fits really nice and is really flattering! &#60;3
5.0,"This charger is the same as the one that came in the box with the watch, and works perfectly. I needed one to keep at work, because I am still getting used to having to charge daily instead of every ten days (I miss my Pebble) or so."
5.0,I Love them! They are cute and fit just right!
5.0,"So far the best none name brand sunglasses I've ever own! Fits perfect, light but durable. Dropped them several times and held strong. Polarized and cheap for the quality you get."
5.0,I like the softness and how it keeps my hair style to be ae to just comb and go without having to style again. I do think it's limited to the types of styles it can be used for.
5.0,Easy slip on that can go anywhere.
5.0,beautiful one
5.0,Very comfortable after a long day at work.
5.0,Comfortable and effective glasses for an excellent price
5.0,"I got these for my daughter and they are very warm and comfortable for her.  The size is big because she's 5 but she has no issues walking in them, she constantly wears them around the house and loves them.  Great gift idea for any unicorn lover"
5.0,Love these glass
5.0,Beautiful. One of my favorite watches
5.0,Amazing belt great quality nice design
5.0,IT DIDNT TARNISH.  I NEVER TAKE IT OFF
5.0,My granddaughter really loved this necklace! It came beautifully packaged and was so elegant! Thank you so much!
5.0,They fit well but my butt needs to be a bit bigger to fill out these shorts the way the model in the photo does.
5.0,"Bought these socks for my husband, son and brother who work outside in the winter all day. They loved them and will order more for next winter."
5.0,"First, very comfortable.  I love the length of the the chain...the very realistic pearl swings with you!  Elegant and fun!!"
5.0,"These are great! Easy to clean! We used them to make ice as well as chocolate candies, and both turned out great."
5.0,The best frame I have owned so far. They are light and take lot of abuse.
5.0,My son chose this as a Halloween costume and received several compliments. I wore it to a Halloween work function and was selected as funniest costume. Compared to other inflatable costumes the $32 was a good price!
5.0,Beautiful blouse!! Great price!
5.0,very comfy - true to size
5.0,It looks fantastic and I got so many compliment from it ;)
5.0,"These socks are comfortable, thick, and have nice arch support with the dense, slightly tighter weave around the arch. The design is cute, and the quality is great—very nice socks!"
5.0,"I'm 5'4'' and weigh 125 pounds and ordered my normal size medium and it fits great.  Looks great and comfortable, I would order it again."
5.0,"So far, so good, and already received compliments."
5.0,I liked the thin texture don't bother wearing it. If you're a type of thick fabric don't recommand it. And the snowman its very nice. And the top its ok but has very swaggy and long sleevs.
5.0,"This top is great especially for the price. I ordered a large just in case,  I am 5‘10“ and weigh 155 and I normally wear a medium but I wanted it to be a little blousy at the bottom  however actually it fits perfectly- not too small or large. I would say it runs a  bit on the smaller side. One review said the material is different on the back than the front but I didn’t find that to be true for mine which is black so maybe it depends on the color you order  – it’s very cute and sexy. I would order another one if they had another color that I liked  in the halter style.  Definitely recommend."
5.0,"I haven't worn it yet. It just arrived yesterday. I tried it on and it fits perfectly. Can't wait to wear it on vacation next month. I bought a medium since the description said plus size. I would've fit a small with no problem, but I wanted it to be loose fitting. I'm 5' 6&#34;, 184lbs."
5.0,"They haven’t worn them yet, but the color is perfect and they seem to be durable! I hope they hold up for the night for our ring bearers!"
5.0,These have well lasted me almost 2 years. I love them!
5.0,"I've been using it for a couple weeks now and it's durable, cleans easy, and sits really comfortably on my face unlike most other masks I've tried. I've probably already gotten 15-20 compliments on the design too so I'm really happy with it to say the least."
5.0,"This shirt is so cute and comfortable. It looks great on. I ordered the next size up. Worked perfectly for me. It makes you’re waist look smaller and hides your hips. My girlfriend is in awe of me, In what I find on Amazon. She can’t believe the prices and the choices. I love the look of this. Amazon, I think you just gained another customer."
5.0,"These glasses are well made and look great!  They feel slightly heavy on bridge of nose, which is to be expected with this style of frames.  Really glad I bought them!  They are so cute!"
5.0,"Nice fit and nice material, should last a long time!!"
5.0,"This is about the 4th item I've purchased from this brand. And this is so far my favorite. It's unbelievable soft!!!! Sooo soft. It's one size and I'm a L/XL in tops, 40DDD, it fits. It's a bit tight around my torso but it helps to shape and smooth at the same time. Because I'm larger the off the shoulder look isn't as dramatic as the model. But I love this look! And soooo soft!"
5.0,"I wanted a pair of simple, everyday sterling silver earrings.  I love leverbacks and these jumped out at me.  They are just what I was looking for.  First of all, it's a small leverback, but unless you have some kind of weird, gigantic earlobes, they should be fine.  The silver heart is super smooth and shiny (I give them a little polish after  get them on in case I got fingerprints on them).  I have been wearing them every day I love them so much."
5.0,Great jacket and great price.  My boyfriend really liked it for a new fall jacket.  Fit true to size.
5.0,"Does just fine.  I advise you to adjust it once, then step into it each time."
5.0,"I love Mordenmiss's products.  Material was softer than I expected but very comfortable fit for 5'5&quot;, 127 lbs woman."
5.0,"Purchased this bag for my son who works on Mauna Kea mountain, most of the time hiking, and this is PERFECT! The size is great, holds most of the things he needs, lots of pockets, and 3L of water! Very comfortable (almost 10 hours of hiking). Also, such great customer service from the company!"
5.0,"Love this bracelet, fits me well. It has a spoon bracelet look."
5.0,Love love love this comfy sleepwear set. The cut is nice and the jamas are so soft..I would buy more if they had a diff color. Very happy.
5.0,"What cute shirts for the summer! You can’t get anymore perfect! My daughters love them, love the designs! Price was just right too!!!"
5.0,"I like for a 'classy' cheap pair of sunglasses. I wear them hiking, out on the water and when we are hanging out outside with friends. I have a pair of prescription Ray-Bans sunglasses but I use those mostly for driving. I have a few pair of goodr sunglasses, a red/black and gold/black. Fun to have color choices to match an outfit or occasion!"
5.0,Very delicate and pretty. Don't machine wash.
5.0,last for a very long time. so many cute ones. i love changing mine throughout the day
5.0,My grandson was very happy with these socks. He's  into anime now so it fit perfect into his theme.
5.0,"I bought this in a Medium. I am a 36DD, so sometimes blouses are too tight around my breasts. This fit decently. The material more of rayon and isnt very stretchy or breathable. It drapes nicely. I have gotten a few compliments on the color. I ordered the blue colored blouse.  It is constructed well. Ive worn it out at least 4 times now with washing in between and its still holding up."
5.0,"This is my second time purchasing these. My granddaughter likes to wear socks to bed, and these are her favorite. They are cute, well made, and plush.<br />A tip: On a cold/snowy day put a pair of knee highs on her, and then these ankle socks over top. Put her boots on, and her feet will stay warm better and longer."
5.0,Soo cute and its perfect
5.0,"Glasses are perfect for my grandparent costume to wear to &#34;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&#34;, which is  our Christmas Eve theme party!<br />Couldn't be happier with them!"
5.0,"Beautiful Christmas Earrings, All came packaged individually."
5.0,This product does exactly as it says...it works...period. All you need to do is adjust them to the proper spot...
5.0,"Excellent backpack, some call it a bug out bag (BoB) and it can definitely be useful for that purpose as it has a lot of space, me personally, I am going to use it as a travel backpack, here's why:<br /><br />* It has 3 main compartments, and 2 small compartments, and pockets for small things, like mosquito repellent, water bottle, etc.<br />* The main compartment is very spacious and has a special pocket for the laptop and it even includes a velcro strap for the laptop.<br />* Bottom of backpack is padded (back of the backpack that goes against your back is also padded!!!<br />* Main compartment has a mesh compartment that you can zip up<br />* Shoulder straps are padded<br />* Can strap around your waist<br />* all the zippers outside the backpack have rubberized grips that are big enough to be easily grab and open in a hurry<br />* EXTERIOR IS WATER REPELLENT<br /><br />Overall, the backpack looks strong and it will fit any purpose you can use it for easily. Price is actually very cheap, when you buy the backpacks that are closer to $100 you are paying for the brand, not the quality. Get this backpack and you will not regret it.<br /><br />Also, I chose the black one because it is good for any situation, the cameo pattern looks good, but I don't want to look like military when I travel haha :)"
5.0,"This shirt is perfect. A little stretchy, great color and washes wonderfully."
5.0,"Beautiful dress, fabric is a thin cotton but not see through.  I’m 5’2 and it hits me above the knees.  Great casual dress!  Love it!"
5.0,arrived quickly. just love it. the stones on the peacock are very brilliant. it was well worth the price
5.0,Love it! It fits as expected. Great quality. Great value.  It is very silky so if you want it to stay tied the strap has to be in a bow or double knotted. Love the color and design. It does tend to have a bit static but for me that’s not a big issue.
5.0,These little things work awesome. Impressive I never thought they would work as well as they do.
5.0,Good product and fits as expected based on the sizing recommendations of customers. I normally wear a large but after seeing reviews bought an XL and it works just fine. Seems to be quality material and I have seen no tears or rips since I have been wearing it. I wear it all day and even to gym.
5.0,Long and comfortable. I love that it has pockets! You can dress it up or down easily.
5.0,This is for sure a loose shirt and very comfortable
5.0,My friend loved it but I thought it looked a lot rougher than I expected. I thought it would be smaller and look more delicate than it does.
5.0,This jacket is very nicely made. The price point is great and I am thrilled to be using this for my daily commute. I am a very happy customer an. I have purchased from these guys in the past and never disappointed with quality and price.
5.0,These key chains are the best quality I have received for the affordable price. Very happy with this purchase!
5.0,"They run small  my husband bought 2x for me. I wear 1x. 2x too small  had to order 3x. They fit great. Washed them couple times.  Cold wash in garment bag. Lightly dried low temperature 10 minutes. Hang dry rest of way, holding up  great"
5.0,I love this true to color light weight seem strudy enough
5.0,"This is an excellent product for children with sensory issues. My son suffers from SPD and he hates underwear, usually refuses to wear them. He loves these."
5.0,"I have both the necklace and earrings.  They are beautiful,  well made of excellent quality.  I get many compliments on them as this jewelry is not something you see everyday.  The colors are wonderful.  They do come in other colors, but I like the combination of several colors that make the paws more noticeable.  I highly recommend the paws for the great quality of the Sterling Silver."
5.0,Great trouser socks
5.0,I have not even tried the other band I'm so stuck on the leather one
5.0,"I searched through so many glasses on here until I found one with the right bridge distance for my tiny nose. Haha these are perfect and really comfortable. They really help with the screen time, don't let how cheap they are discourage the purchase"
5.0,"Enjoyed using this with my kids, they loved it!"
5.0,Favourite sleep wear now!
5.0,Nice shirt great for summer as it is light and long sleeve to protect from the sun.  Not Pocket
5.0,I love this bag.  It has so much room.  Very organized pockets.  Small ones and large.  Very well put together.  Awsome Quality.  Perfect size for a purse.  Light weight.  Love it.
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for... Covered up scratches and scuffs on the heels of my leather boots, allowing me to save them for at least another season. From a distance they look new after using the paint, but up close you can see the texture differences where the original paint had peeled. I expected this though and I'm very happy with my purchase. Before and after pictures attached."
5.0,I love these glasses! They look like real glasses and no more fog when I wear my mask.
5.0,i had 2nd thoughts after reading reveiws BUT mine is perfect ...NO problems. all still good after 4 months. i give it 5 STARS . as good as any and less$$$ than most.
5.0,"This set was a beautiful adornment to our keychains! My husband and I were both pleased with the intricate design, conventional size, and reasonable price. We've had them for about a year now and they're still as good as new. I would definitely recommend this product for all the couples out there."
5.0,"I LIKE IT ALOT . THE PRICE WAS RIGHT , AN ATTRACTIVE PIECE OF COSTUME JEWELRY"
5.0,The dress was beautiful and very comfortable.  Fit as expected.
5.0,"Bought these as a kind of joke for vacation. Was surprised at how comfortable they were and how cool they looked.<br /><br />They're made of a pretty thick, sturdy plastic. They did not feel flimsy at all. I bought the green ones, which are nice, but make it look cloudy out. LOL.<br /><br />Overall, a great, fun purchase. Would suggest."
5.0,This was a great he loved it wears it all the time and has had no problem with it . Thank you
5.0,Perfect fit over my glass
5.0,great for a small frame face
5.0,Love them.  Look very classy and they work great. I used all three pairs and they were very well made and sturdy.  I really find them extremely useful.
5.0,I have a problem finding sunglasses that fit my face so I frequently have to search for child glasses. They fit perfect and I love the pink.
5.0,Great glasses when using computer. Very stylish and lightweight. Arrived quickly and case is nice.
5.0,"perfect addition for my Halloween costume! Need an arch support in them - but otherwise, they're great!"
5.0,"Super cute, looked great for 2-year photo shoot! It was a little big, but the way you could tie the dress in the back made it adjustable."
5.0,Received this purse today.  I love the color!!!  Great for summer.  IT is  nice and soft and the handle is long enough to fit comfortably on my shoulder.  Very nice size to hold all my stuff.  Inside center zippered pocket has alot of separate compartments to hold smaller items.  Outside pocket is large enough for my 5s phone.  Would definitely recommend this pocketbook.
5.0,Must have! Well duh! How did I not have one of these before!? Amazing price and works great. Took a few minutes to get the coordination but that was quick. Will be buying a few more for stockings during the holidays!
5.0,"This romper fit me so perfectly! I love that it’s a romper but also looks like a dress. it’s flowy in the right places, it’s not too short, the sleeves are the right length for me, it’s just perfection. 10/10 recommend. (5’5” - 123 lbs)"
5.0,Actually impressed at the quality.
5.0,Looking to replace my Kate 70’ early 80’ wire choker like on  wedding singer movie
5.0,"These are really perfect socks. I have quite an obsession with over the knee socks - and it is hard to find the ones that fit right - do not pinch the thigh and stay up. These are very very good. They are made out of comfortable cotton blend knit material. They do have enough stretch but not too loose either. I like the color variety that I got with black, dark gray and gray. These keep me warm and comfortable."
5.0,"Soft, warm, fit great on my small 21 month old."
5.0,"Beautiful, light, and not overly big."
5.0,"Love it, I'm 5'4 157 34C and the Small did me justice held everything in place and looked really nice and form fitting. GET IT!!"
5.0,Loved it! Fit my two year old perfectly!
5.0,"I ordered this jumper based on one five-star review, and quite glad I did. It slides on easily, is super cute, light weight, comfy and fun to wear. Can be worn as a lounger or dressed up for a dinner date. Highly recommend. Will I order in another color? Hmmmm....maybe."
5.0,"Nice , my wife love it, accurate pictures, and good quality."
5.0,"I love this robe!  Feels like the robes at a 5 star hotel!  I bought one for my husband & he couldn't get me to give it back to him, so he bought me one that was my size & I love it!  It is so soft & stays soft. It is sewn well & sizing is spot on!  Kudos to the seller for a great product, exactly as described & maintains it's softness!  The quality of this product is great & I suggest you get one now!  A+A+A+A+A++++ Buy!!!"
5.0,This necklace is very light and great for woman.
5.0,I love this bag. it's sturdy and well made.
5.0,I bought these for my mom for her anniversary. She loves sapphires and really wanted a pair of solitaires to wear. I was a little nervous about the quality because of the price; but I was extremely pleased with the quality and look of the earrings. She has had them for about a year now and they still look great!
5.0,I have had this case now for a couple of months.  It is holding up well and I still really like it.  It is slim and sleek so it fits well in my pocket but it is protective and even though I have a tendency to drop my phone it hasn't broken.
5.0,"I love this Ukes Premium Sunglass Strap; it’s so stylish, comfortable and pretty - I purchased the Indios.  It’s also a very good quality strap.<br /><br />I wanted this strap because I’m constantly pulling my sunglasses off and on when shopping or just out and about.  My oversize sunglasses just don’t fit well in my purse, and I’m always forgetting them somewhere.  This strap fits them great and I figure will help me from losing my sunglasses for good.  Now I want another one for the sunglasses I leave in my car!"
5.0,I knew I liked the REVO brand sunglasses because I already had a pair and they fit exactly as expected.  They are lightweight and fit comfortable on my face the lens is amber which I prefer over the grey<br /><br />My item was shipped as expected and arrived the next day
5.0,Love this bag own one this one is for my sister
5.0,Great anklet!! Exactly as pictured.... love it!!! Hoping it holds up as well as it looks
5.0,It is EXACTLY as the picture and arrived on time!!!!!
5.0,"Confortable, beautiful I love it!!"
5.0,Fit perfectly! Love it. Will definitely order again!
5.0,They are amazing! It makes me want to style every outfit around them. The fit is so phenomenal I feel like I could do a night of dancing to Kenny Loggins music!!!
5.0,"great skort, got the larger size, fits beautifully.  soft, silky, slit on side allows for greater movement."
5.0,Love this dress!! Beautiful fabric and color!!
5.0,These bands aren't very expensive and they hold up and last! I have this color and the slate blue; both are great!
5.0,Very hip and stylish. A feel good earing
5.0,Good color on shamrock
5.0,The bracelet in rich red crystals is very sparkly in any light. I have worn it and all crystals are still intact
5.0,This dress is so comfortable!!  I bought a second one immediately.  I normally wear a large/size 10 because I don't want my closes to be snug but I ordered a medium after reading the reviews.  The medium fits great with room to spare.  I'm 5'4&#34; so this dress is a little too long on me but if I knot the front I don't trip on it and the back touches the floor with flat shoes on.  I love the v neck and its not too low cut.  The little sleeves make this great to wear alone without needing a cardigan.  I love the slits on the sides too because it adds interest and flowing movement.  I think this will be a go to outfit while traveling too!  This dress was a great find at a great price!
5.0,Functional and comfortable basketball shorts.
5.0,Love the fit and wicking. My feet sweat a lot and are smelly by days end. These socks are doing a good job of keeping my feet dry and odor free.
5.0,Fits great! Very comfortable. Comes in 6 versatile colors. Feels like 100% cotton.
5.0,We love this outfit for our little one.
5.0,I looooove my swimsuit! I ordered mine in a slimming black color and it fits perfectly! I am 5'3 and weigh 160 with a 36dd cup size. I ordered an extra large and it fits perfectly! I'm seriously considering buying another in a color! The back of the top is not adjustable but fits me fine…a little big but the straps around the neck are adjustable so once I tightened those it was fine! The fringe is only in the front but looks very cute although is thinner than shown in the picture. I posted a picture of mine and hope it helps you!! Don't mind the thing on my thigh…it's an insulin pump.
5.0,"Love em, get multiple compliments and asked where I got them from"
5.0,"I purchased this watch as a gift for my 8 yr old grandson, and he loves it. I wanted him to be able to tell time using an analog timepiece. Well, by the end of the day he was a master."
5.0,It came in a few weeks early and I was very excited that I got it. It was exactly what it says and can fit basically all wrists. I am very happy with it considering I love the band and wearing these types of brackets so if you want an All Time Low bracelet then get this one.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:38e34881325d8207b15ca327f9a3adbe]] Beautiful sparkling earrings. Well packaged, has a little box that came with it, and exactly like pictured. I liked that the back of it had a bit of extra cushioned support so that your ears are completely comfortable. They’re also light enough not to hurt your ears for the size that they are."
5.0,I absolutely love it!!  :)
5.0,"I did buy size S. I’m really in love, the material is of quality, the design is original.  Depending on what you use, it can looks very cute! If you are looking for something sexy, beautiful, feminine, I definitely recommend it! 😊 Ah, and use with invisible silicone nipple cover 😉😘"
5.0,My daughter prefers this style of underwear. These are really cute.
5.0,"I absolutely love these SOJOS glasses. They are elegant, geared to a smaller head, and look fabulous on. I would definitely purchase these again."
5.0,I love love love these dresses in the short sleeved version so I decided to buy the long sleeved one for winter.  I bought one in Black and I absolutely love it. I will be purchasing it in additional colors.  Can be dressed up or casual.
5.0,"What a surprise! I received a bonus mask in my order. I love them both, highest ""Johnny Was"" style and quality. Always receive compliments and queries about where I bought them. Thank you so much!"
5.0,"Great shirt, I think I should have ordered the med instead of the Large"
5.0,Wife loved them 110%
5.0,Super Cute!  Fits perfectly. Bought 3 sets for my granddaughters and they all love them!
5.0,It's a great wallet.  Just what I needed.  I purchased 2.  Speedy delivery.  Thank you
5.0,They were absolutely perfect. Very Soft
5.0,Super cute on. The bottoms are a little small but I have a big butt. Both sides are super cute.
5.0,Well constructed... Haven't had the occasion to test waterproof capability but I'm pleased with the purchase.
5.0,"This is the first perfect jumpsuit I’ve found, and bonus- it’s in black! I’m<br />5’2, 115 lbs and the Small is perfect! I have to put on only a small heel, which I would anyway since it’s dressier, and it’s perfect. Could really be dressed up or down- very versatile!"
5.0,"very nice, very comfortable, very stylish"
5.0,Very pretty. Love the colors.
5.0,"I bought this for myself and wear it everyday, I love it"
5.0,"Exactly as described! Galaxy's Edge Star Wars Legacy Lightsaber (Ahsoka Tano (Clone Wars)). Two hilts and they are from Galaxy's Edge. I could not be happier with them. They look and work great. As for the price, being able to purchase these online (even at a higher price) was still less money spent than a trip in person. I was able to get a 26"" and 36"" in Galaxy's Edge lightsaber blade to go with the hilts. Together they look amazing. And switching the blade colors from green to blue and back again is a great feature!"
5.0,Works great at post sleeve and ear spacers.
5.0,Satisfied. Worth the risk.
5.0,I love the fit and it is so comfortable.  I've ordered in just about every pattern available.  I definitely recommend.
5.0,Love the material. Got it for my daughter and she loves it.
5.0,I like it because it’s solid
5.0,"Fits as described, slightly tight on the thighs but comfortable. Dries fast. Belt works well, even when carrying equipment."
5.0,Like the color not too heavy fits just right
5.0,"Great product,  cool and comfortable. I two more in blue... ."
5.0,"Awesome tank top! The colors were great and the fit was good too. Ladies, if you want to purchase this be mindful that its a guy's tank so it will expose a lot of side boob. I just put on a neon blue bra under it and problem solved."
5.0,"I know friends of mine that spend hundreds on watches and I ask them why ? I have had this watch for over a year, wearing it daily, and it is everything I ever wanted."
5.0,Works great! Better then the band it comes with.
5.0,It’s a little scratchy at first but so cute with every outfit
5.0,Dipset dipset dipset
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for ! Great quality wallet . I already ordered another one for my friend . It has plenty of space for all my needs . Pancaking was high quality . I definetly suggest this wallet .
5.0,"Very pretty, my daughter loves it!!!"
5.0,Love this.  It goes with just about everything.
5.0,The detail is great. Fit fine on my stepmother pandora bracelet
5.0,"Super cute! The quality seems really good. I can’t speak to longevity since I just got it in the mail. But I’m really happy with it and I will update my review once I’ve used it for while. But I definitely recommend for now if you want a fun, cheeky, Y2K inspired phone strap!"
5.0,cool lights and very happy I would probably buy more.  I received them quickly and in perfect condition. Thank you very much
5.0,"These are so fun. They aren't amazing quality but they are worth the small price. Fun, on trend, and cute. They are quite large but that was exactly what I was looking for. Perfect for summer. They came neatly packaged, I just shook them to fluff them up."
5.0,I love my balls earrings!  Would buy again!
5.0,"I usually wear a large, but in light of other reviews, I got the XL, and I'm glad I did. It washes well, and although the material is thin, it is not sheer. I wore it the olive color with a pair of black jeggings and short heeled boots with a scarf tied around the waist. I wish there were more fall colors because I would order one in golden yellow and rust if available!"
5.0,"Socks fit perfect! I cannot wait to take them with me to Jackson, Wyoming this summer!"
5.0,Great Gifts for a former coworker
5.0,I absolutely love this dress. It’s was sized perfectly and the color “watermelon “ is just as close to a watermelon as you could get. The quality of the dress was great. But I really liked how it fit. I got many compliments on it and because I liked it so much I want to order one for my daughter in law because I just know she’ll love it too.
5.0,Loved them. Bought for adding the finishing touch to a Yellow Submarine party (all you need is love).
5.0,Truly stunning necklace. The shine is incredible. Very high quality. Strongly recommend it. Buying another one as my mom also liked it a lot. Thanks Seller.
5.0,Going on vacation and got this for a carry on bag. Very big and fits everything I need it to.
5.0,"Work very well,just the right size and well made. The only thing I would like is more color options."
5.0,These boots do run a 1/2 to a size large. They are high quality and feel like they should last for a few years. I really like them.
5.0,This was a really pretty swimsuit which was a little larger than expected. It has a very pretty design and the hot pink color is vey pretty and bright. It looks great with the ruching because it provides for a skinner shiloutte. Beautiful bathing suit that helps me feel confident at the beach. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review
5.0,"Perfect fit,,, Have bought these before, they are my favorite.  Just wish there were more  color choices."
5.0,Works. Needed to adjust high speed needle a bit as expected for my operating conditions.
5.0,"I buy these regularly - they fit well, they last a long time and they stay up without that tight grip that most socks have."
5.0,Great shirt. My girls love them.  Material is very soft for a school uniform.
5.0,"It's a terrific &#34;knock-off &#34; handbag.  I own 3 Louis Vuitton bags and one Coach bag.  Why ruin the real ones with everyday use?  I absolutely love it.  It doesn't exact look like a Louis Vuitton bag, but I like the patttern."
5.0,"Because I am 5’1, I was pleased the length was perfect for me. The quality is very good. After steaming, it looked perfect. The color is vibrant and beautiful!"
5.0,Están muy bien y de buena calidad
5.0,Cute personal gift for anyone special.
5.0,"I have tried so many hats, and they were all too tight on my head or too floppy, but this one is absolutely perfect. I used a very small pair of scissors to snip the threads and remove the mask part since I only want a hat, not a mask, and it is just perfect. It does not fit too tightly so as to squeeze your head like so many other hats do, and the brim is nice and stiff so it doesn’t droop down in your face and obstruct your vision. Also it is lightweight, which was important to me, and the colors are so feminine and beautiful. I just ordered a second one and may end up with a third. I like to spend time outside but I do not enjoy direct sunlight on my head or face, so I usually wear a hat outside. It is not an exaggeration to say that I have tried about 10 other hats before finding this one and being so very happy with it. This is a special design and I hope they keep making them!"
5.0,Fit great! Looks just like picture! Comfy!
5.0,This little bubble was absolutely adorable!!
5.0,"These elevate the standard over-sized sweater/legging /Chelsea boot combo I've donned all of quarantine. Add these with a heeled ankle boot or flats with a sweater/long sleeve/turtleneck etc. Super versatile and will help you upgrade the wardrobe that you love but is in great need of a reboot. I love them in black, I haven't tried the other colors yet, but I plan on buying more than one black pair and maybe a dark khaki pair if i'm feeling bold. I highly recommend them. P.S if you hate ironing, they're wrinkle resistant ( in my opinion but may not be advertised as such.)"
5.0,handy stuff
5.0,"Good for a fun, inexpensive, playful watch."
5.0,I always receive compliments on this necklace. love it.
5.0,Very pretty and nice!
5.0,The pic doesn't do it justice. The price is MORE than fair.
5.0,"Nice set! My husband really liked it. The tie clip is a little smaller than I’d like, but I knew that before ordering from the picture. This is a good gift item at an affordable price."
5.0,"Beautiful dress,  fits great and really soft.  Didn't know it was more of a cotton feel but still looks amazing!"
5.0,I love my jacket! It arrived quickly and looks fantastic. I'm very happy with it.
5.0,Very cool gift! I love the personalized box it came in as much as the leather key holder itself! The leather is soft and well stitched. The engraving is perfect. I got this for my husband for our 3rd wedding anniversary!

The only thing he complained about was that it is all one piece from the feet to the fingers (only thing removable is the mask), he would have preferred if he could take off the gloves so he could eat finger foods and use his hands a little better while still dressed up. There is a small zipper in the front for boys to pee out of so they don’t have to remove the whole costume to pee."

5.0,I love my new Pineapple iPhone 6 case!  It's super cute and fits the phone well.  My only criticism is that the hole for charging port is a little small for some of my chargers.... but that's not enough of an issue for me to give it anything less than 5 stars!

5.0,"We had a hard time finding sweatbands for our toddlers Halloween costume. These fit perfect and looked so cute on her. The color looks just like the photo.

5.0,"Really thrilled by the quality.  I do wish there were two pockets,  but not a deal breaker."
5.0,These earrings are ADORABLE!!!!!  I bought them for my 8 year old daughter and she loves them.  I also love that the proceeds go to supporting a great cause!

5.0,"Cozy, thick knit, warm, well made, cute, fits well and durable. My niece loves it and wears it all the time. She only wears dresses inside the house so it keeps her warm. I got it in 6/7. I am going to be buying more of these dresses because she really seems to like these dresses."

5.0,Nice quality black bow tie.
5.0,Super soft. Zero compression. Def comfort!

I totally forgot to take it off and ending up going shopping with it on because I didn't even feel it.  I got a few chuckles before I realized I was still wearing it.  So much better than a blue wig for my Thing Costume!"
5.0,7 year old daughter loved sticker earings
5.0,They are good quality and should last a long time.

5.0,"I found these at the Christmas Tree Shoppe a few years ago  and I love them.  I had several pairs and gave them to everyone I know.  Then the Shoppe stopped carrying them; I searched around and found them here,<br />They are well made with pleather palms and trim.  They are lined with thinsulate and can be tossed in the washer and dryer.  I like the bright colors as they are usually only black, gray or navy.  I came back to buy more but they appear to be out of stock.  They also have skyrocketed in price from the $5.99 I paid at TCS to over $20 here, which I can't justify."
5.0,Beautiful Anklet..!!
5.0,"Durable, cute, well constructed! My toddler loves them."
5.0,"Yes, this product took forever to get here, but I knew that before I purchased so it wasn't a surprise. The material is absolutely buttery soft and fits my 9 month old so well with one cuff on the pants and sleeves bc it's still a bit too long for him (bought 12 months so he could grow into it). Just for reference, my 9 month old son weighs just over 18lbs and he is in the 50th percentile for height (can't recall exact measurement!). The hat does fit a little on the snug side but he has a bit bigger head<br /><br />Oh yes, and I must add- it fits perfectly over a cloth diaper. See picture for reference 😊"
5.0,The dress fits well and has a great pattern. It may run just a little bigger in size.
5.0,Great product. Bought these for my son for baseball and they are very durable - three tournaments in and no issues.
5.0,"Beautiful skirt!  I will purchase another soon.  I will probably go down a size from a medium to a small.  I had a few inches to spare in the waist.  I am 168, 5'2&#34;.  The length is just past my knees."
5.0,Great little watch and looks as good as the image.  Only glitch is the clip is a bit too tough to open....
5.0,Perfect fit. Love the quality & its comfortable
5.0,This bag is awesome! Loads of pockets for extreme organization! I love it! Not too big either so I don't feel like a weirdo toting all of my stuff to the gym.
5.0,It's so pretty! Shipping came fast and I love it! Will buy from this seller and this item in the future! Thank you again!
5.0,Is very comfortable<br />washes well<br />hang to dry
5.0,Just as pictured. Lovely!
5.0,This facemask seems well made. It is soft around the eyes.
5.0,Absolutely love this nose ring came well packaged and sooner than expected
5.0,"Blue size medium (5'4&#34;, 126 lbs) - perfect fit. Good length and high rise. Not high waisted but that maybe because they are slightly loose on me. I expected NOTHING from the price but to wear around the house. Shocked at the softness of material and COMFORT. Very fashionable- I have not taken them off since I received them yesterday! Can wear with Henly or tunic.They make you look very shapely- husband loved how they looked. The finishing and seams are well sewn. I can't believe they can hold up like this (no sagging or baggy knees) for long but considering the price, I will buy more. Highly endorse."
5.0,Great t shirt. It's thin but good quality. I'm 5'2 120lbs. I got a small and it fits well
5.0,"I WEAR THEM VERY OFTEN.  They were much more in terms of sturdiness, than I expected for the price.  You cannot go wrong on purchasing these earrings.  I will buy four more pair, so that I can give them away as presents."
5.0,"Great glasses for the price. Although they were bit large for me, but they fit my husband great."
5.0,I notice the difference when wearing.
5.0,Love these so comfy. Have to roll or fold waist down to make fit.
5.0,Soft and comfy. Love It!
5.0,Great christmas gifts!  Great price and cute!
5.0,"Came packaged beautifully and safely. Have to say I love it! The colors are gorgeous and match my dress perfectly. I know how difficult it is to match colors or coordinate colors when shopping and choosing on line, but this was perfect! I may never shop for silk scarves anywhere else every again! Thank you."
5.0,I was able to pack for a week long trip. Used as my carry on. Looks great!
5.0,"I love this dress! I feel so lady like in it. I'm a solid size 10 ,5'4 and the large fit perfectly. Also VERY fast shipping.  It came in 2 days!"
5.0,My daughter loved it and it breathes well

5.0,This key chain idea adorable
5.0,Received as advertised. Would order again from this seller.
5.0,Fits  perfect just what I expected... Lightweight perfect for working out
5.0,"I bought this to replace the band on my Pagani Design Seamaster Homage and it simply looks better than the original. I also was able to install the quick release, although I would only advise it if you have a thin wrist. I am very happy with this purchase."
5.0,"Comfy and matchy, great colors."
5.0,"I didn't have any rose gold backs to go with my rose gold snaps, so these were a perfect fit."
5.0,Love these foldable sunglasses for travel. Easy to put in a very small purse or pocket.
5.0,Nice fit sandal. Good quality.
5.0,These pants fit perfectly and are very flattering.  They are easy for vacations because they don't wrinkle easily and are super comfortable.  I wear between a size 6 and the medium was perfect.
5.0,Beautiful necklace. I should have bought more colors!!! I get so many compliments!!!
5.0,"No pinch, no bind, no tab scratching you, nothing but comfort and amazing soft material against your skin.  The sizing is perfect and the feel against skin is like nothing is there but softness.<br /><br />Cannot recommend this product more for the price, comfort, and overall fit."
5.0,The only thing I don't like is that I have nowhere to wear it! (for now) It fits perfectly and is very flattering.  I am a very petite woman and was worried it would be to long on me. It goes down to mid calf which for me is perfect as I am an older woman with old lady legs.
5.0,Looking cool
5.0,Really cute style with the &#34;support&#34; promised.
5.0,It's so cute!!! The wife loves the thing!
5.0,My son loves them. Great shoe. Arrived quickly.
5.0,"My husband is completely pleased with the belts. They look and feel great, and seem very well made,"
5.0,"Really like this dress, own it in multiple colors, including the coral and the white.  The white is a bit sheer, but I can get away with just wearing neutral undergarments no problem.  The coral color is really a BRIGHT orange.  I like it, but it's not quite as it photographs.  Bottom line: It's super flattering and comfortable.  Not sure how it washes yet."
5.0,Love them no more eye fatigue at the end of the day.  It makes a huge difference.
5.0,Love Birkenstocks and these are perfect as expected. I have been wearing Birkenstocks for 40 years.  Love them in all colors.
5.0,Very cute gift for my granddaughter
5.0,"I am a huge Sorel fan, I own an embarrassing amount of their shoes. These were marked down to 50% off and living in Florida I can wear them all year long. I bought these in black and white. I get compliments all the time on these and I could play basketball in them! There is 1 draw back to these particular sandals, they do rub on your baby toe. I spritzed the inside of that area with a little alcohol and immediately wore them and it fixed the rubbing. But you may want to pack a bandaid the first time you wear them, specially if you plan on a lot of walking. Follow the brand and get notification when they have sales. Glad I did not miss this one, 2 pairs for the price of 1! Happy Dance"
5.0,They are comfortable and very cute. Good value. I get a lot of compliments at the gym and people ask me if I've lost weight so they must be slenderizing too!
5.0,Nice and soft gown. Just right for cozy winter night.
5.0,This outfit wa amazing it was long enough I could have legging with it if I wanted it was just what I was looking for a t shirt dress this company is absolutely 💯 amazing and I would recommend all there items !
5.0,I really like this dress and will order other colors.  It's comfortable and cute.
5.0,"Here are my wife's notes about the item with a picture:<br /><br />I'm 5'4&#34; 115lbs. Comfortable material. Lightweight material but not see through. Best to wear pasties or no bra. If I were any taller, I would need a larger size because the length is just right for someone at 5'4&#34;. Very cute and the perfect summer outfit. Can be worn casual or dressed up."
5.0,I got the 6-12 month size and my baby is 8 months; it fit just fine.  The little pants faded on the knees after washing it and treating the knee area since he crawled on the floor with them on.
5.0,"I was very impressed when the band arrived it.  It looked great and I got a lot of compliments on it.  The downside is that the band could be tight at times and after a few months the wear and tear was very visible.  I was using the band all the time and I sweat a lot so it is not great for working out.  The rating of 5 stars is more for the company. When the clasp broke (band wouldn't stay closed) I contacted the company. They were very responsive, gave me several options to choose from and replaced my band with a rubber one within days. The replacement band is awesome and still going strong after several months. I workout and play tennis with the new band and it is great. In summary this band it perfect for less strenuous activity and a more stylish look but not gym activity."
5.0,"Beautiful timepiece.  But if you dislike BIG watches give this one a pass, it also helps if you have a bigger bone structure. Everything about the watch feels solid.  The Seiko 24 jewel movement sweeps super smooth, keeps time accurately and the 500 meters water resistant rating makes this watch perfect to withstand the toughest conditions. The illumination is great and holds its brightness for quite a while. I love it."
5.0,was used for a present but was what I expected
5.0,"Perfect for sleepover parties, kept my daughter warm during the winter season.."
5.0,"they are great! love the style and the fit was perfect for me, 30x32 as advertised."

5.0,"My first package was delivered with a hole in it so no product. I think on the resend, they sent the wrong colors (green and black but I LOVE the new bands. Super easy to get on and off, very light and comfortable, like you're not wearing anything."
5.0,Surprised the material was so light and not well formed.
5.0,Fit & good
5.0,Just put it together in no time. It has a huge coverage area. Looking forward to seeing how it will be for the season.
5.0,"Quality product, don't be fooled by the easily peeled plastic, it's there as protection before it gets to you; I was initially concerned about it until I realized the quality of the product."
5.0,Not very well constructed...
5.0,aaa so cutee i bought this for soobin in 2019 and I had to get one myself.

5.0,"This is one of the best purchases I've made so far.  Bought 2 sets in different colors, one for my husband and I, and we just used them on our<br />recent trip.  We travel often and how I wished I had purchased these a Loonnnnngggg time ago.  They made travelling and packing and unpacking<br />so easy!  We were moving from hotel to hotel and everything was so organized and easy to find.<br /><br />Excellent quality and highly recommended!"
5.0,It’s perfect everything I need fits
5.0,"What in the world is this material the frame is made out of?! Seems indescribable to me. I would like all my products in my home to be build as well as these sunglasses. Mah gawd, loving every minute in the sun, if Minnesota had any from from September to June... A+, they aren't cheap, they are in expensive! Get some, the polarization rules, ever look directly at the sun through some cirrus stratus clouds? Probably not, but with these, you can! It's super weird, it's a perfect circle."
5.0,"I love this dress, it feels soft and flowy, great fabric for the style!  Long sleeves keep me warm but not too warm. I love this dress and will likely buy another one"
5.0,"Good fit, sexy silhouette, silky fabric, vibrant rich blue color."
5.0,"This dress is just beautiful. It arrived exactly as pictured. The color is gorgeous, the detailing and are perfect. I could not be happier with this purchase. I requested one adjustment and I got an immediate response. The customer service is the best I've seen."
5.0,"Bought these for my boyfriend, a diehard Green Bay Packers and Aaron Rodgers fan, for his birthday. That was over a month ago. They've been collecting dust on this dresser, slowly disappearing under a pile of random things. Now, Green Bay has played pretty well without his sock support so far, but I personally feel like if he had worn these socks, the Packers might have been undefeated this season. Anyway, back to the point- these socks are great. Amazing photo quality, very soft, no doubt legit good luck. Everything you need to complete your dresser decoration collection.<br />**Update** it has now been 4 years since I purchased these socks. I started wearing them as back up boot socks. I am a diehard Chiefs fan aannnddd we've won the Superbowl twice since I purchased these. They are for sure good luck in some way, my boyfriend should have worn them. 10/10 recommend."
5.0,This outfit is soooo cute. Fits as expected
5.0,Pretty accurate watch and overall great value for the price and what you get.
5.0,Good packaging. Was concerned this style hat would be a mess. Surprise! Nice.
5.0,Really pretty sweater
5.0,"This fits my cell, credit cards and a small change purse for craft fairs, shopping or walking. It's just big enough to carry my necessities, and it's small enough to be carried effortlessly. I love the neutral pattern that coordinates with lots of colors I wear. A good value and well made."
5.0,"Soft and comfortable, great for everyday use"
5.0,"I don't review things often anymore, but this is definitely an exception. For the price, this is a stellar product. Very heavy duty, very detailed, and the adjustable necklace is great. I am just really, really pleased with this all around. Its tough to find good items relating to Thoth, and this one is fantastic and very reasonably priced."
5.0,"I have Plantar fasciitis and this is my 3rd pair of Terox sandals. They are the best shoe I own for relief when walking & standing - including my Naot,Dankos, Keen, and Merrell that are three times the cost of Terox.  I bought this slip on style so I could wear with a light sock (around the house) during the winter.  True to size."
5.0,"This is one of the few mask that my kids do not mind wearing. The material does not leave indentions on their little faces. They also like the variety of colors.<br />As a parent, the mask is light weight, washes well, and has the adjustable strap. My daughter like to try to blow out my candles with her mask on, but she was not able to blow out the candle flame with these mask even after a few washes."
5.0,I got the blue and it is stunning! I am confident I will get tons of use out of this one.
5.0,I couldn't love this dress anymore then I do !!! I am a 10/12 normally but did get the xl and fits perfect !!! I'm a 36d and it fits amazing in the chest and flares out at the hips !! Very good quality !!
5.0,"This apron protects and fits well.  Great color, too!"
5.0,I hunted for this coat in this size for about 6 months after I physically saw it in another store. So happy to get the right size. It is well made and very warm.
5.0,"I’m 5’4 130lbs, 36B, got the small and I’m glad I did. Loose enough to be comfy but not look like I’m drowning in it. Wore it around Vegas and I was comfy in it! There’s pockets btw but it was kinda lower than where I’d usually want my pockets to be. Still cool though. Love the adjustable straps too."
5.0,"I would highly recommend these masks to anyone who is looking for great quality and protection. They fit the face nicely, and I feel pretty comfortable wearing them. I believe they abide by CDC guidelines for cloth masks (3-layered) and offer good protection overall when used in conjunction with a filter insert."
5.0,"I've had this ring for a while and I am very happy with it. My wife bought it because I'm always loosing my ring, and for the price it is a great ring. It looks like a more expensive one and the inside if beveled making removing the ring as well as putting it on very easy. When the time comes that I loose this ring, I will purchase another one of these."
5.0,These were very beautiful earrings for the price. Love PearlSource and would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone.
5.0,Comfortable and fit great!
5.0,I love the brave person swimsuits they are so comfortable. Hope to have all colors.
5.0,Great product! Really high quality material. I had to try these out as babies tend to push out their mittens and scratch themselves. They're expensive but you'll see why. Def worth to get one at least.
5.0,"These shirts tend to vary in sizing, but these turned out to be true to size, meaning a large, which I ordered, was the right fit for me.  I had no need to order a size up or down."
5.0,Perfect beautiful and cute
5.0,"Honestly, I’m not sure why these dresses would have any bad reviews. Sure, it wrinkles but after I throw it in the dryer for a few minutes while I get myself ready it’s as good as new. Most of my clothes get wrinkled easily anyway so it’s not big deal. For a $13 dress I have no complaints. It fits great! Just check the size chart if you don’t know what size to get. They’re all extremely cute and can be worn anytime of the year."
5.0,These are exactly the style I was looking for! Great product. Nice and breathable with a lot of room for my inner thighs. Leggings bottoms hug nicely around my cafe to ankle. Waist band is really great fit as I don't have to worry about tying anything. Has loose cool front pockets and couple button pockets in the back. Very light and comfortable.
5.0,Love the loose fit and material.
5.0,"It is comfortable and cool for summer. I am pear shaped and I was able to purchase an xl, which  worked great for my shoulders and bust, but was also large enough to fit me around my hips.  That did not work for all the Anysize styles, but this dress worked great for me. I purchased this dress in 3 different colors. Dresses are well make and fabric is light weight great for Florida weather."
5.0,"Under Dr. orders my husband has to wear a hat when he's outside. I'm not putting one of those stupid straw gardening hats on him. This one looks great, shades his face and keeps his masculinity intact. Good price too. Others have them cheaper. This is a sturdier hat. So guys buy this hat, save your skin and look like a man. (Ladies, it looks pretty good on me too)"
5.0,Purchased this for my five year old because she wants to be a nurse like mommy. It is absolutely adorable! Definitely recommend this product to any child who likes to play dress up!
5.0,"I purchased two of these bags, one black, the other navy.  These were for my son to use for school, one for A day, the other for B day.  They are sturdy with extra compartments for cell phone, water bottle, etc. He fits 3 binders, 2 notebooks, 3 school books, 1 pencil pouch and his cell phone in the drawstring backpack.  There are no rips or holes in the fabric surprisingly since he is not the most careful. Works great for school life/teen life."
5.0,"These are okay,<br />Good for the price and definitely better than other drugstore branded pull up disposable underpants for kids."
5.0,What a concept!!! They work
5.0,love this dress so much even order it in two different color
5.0,Lastima que la talla no concuerda pero la tela y el diseño esta soñado buena calidad
5.0,"This belt is awesome! I've used Invisibelts for several years, but they need replaced often since the plastic buckle fasteners wear down and then the buckle opens frequently. This belt stretches as you move and is much more comfortable. Definitely worth the extra $$!"
5.0,"Truly doesn’t keep my keys in line, better than all the s-clip types I used to daily. Over all, amazing product, no idea how the Go Pro tool works though. The rings are also very strong."
5.0,Fit good thank u
5.0,I bought them to give my friend’s children cooking lessons. They were thrilled.
5.0,Loved these guys! I actually slipped them each on a chain and wear as necklaces. Really well made for the money and look just like the photos.
5.0,My daughter loves these & wears them all the time! A lot nicer quality then expected!!
5.0,Beautiful color and the fit is tight but not trashy. I like the side detail to break up the solid color. It came quickly.
5.0,Amazing having the zipper to get uncooperative toddler hands in
5.0,Gifted to guys who loved the message and the socks. .as advertised. . Fun gift choice.
5.0,This worked well for my husband who is on the heavier side.
5.0,I purchased this as a gift. I personally love it and wish it came in more colors. If I could keep it I would.
5.0,Luv these colors. Will buy more!
5.0,"I got these for my daughter for the first day of school and they fit AMAZINGLY. I was a little nervous because my daughter has long legs and a really small waist. I was worried these, like all her jeans, would be too big in the waist because they were bought to accommodate her long legs. I was pleasantly surprised when she didn't even need the belt I'd purchased to keep them from falling off. This is definitely a company I will buy from again. My daughter loves these jeans and says they're the most comfortable ones she has."
5.0,It fits perfectly. The fabric is cheap but as expected with the price. I love the way it looks on.
5.0,"I've worn these twice for yoga and weightlifting. They are comfy and flattering----also, nice fabric!"
5.0,"I ordered two of these chains, along with a similar one that had no lock, and they made a delightful and sturdy addition to my Jacob Marley's ghost costume for a production of A CHRISTMAS CAROL. They survived two dress rehearsals and three shows with no problems. I also used regular chains with them, though I made sure to put the real chains on first. I would definitely recommend these for anyone wishing to use them."
5.0,Beautiful quality and price!
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful! But the backs came off easily and I lost them soon after purchasing. Very sad about that, because I love the earrings! Big fan of turquoise jewelry, and this is spot on to my taste. Too bad they didn’t stay on and lost them soon after purchasing."
5.0,"These sunglasses are awesome!  I ordered these for my 2 year old and she loves them!  As you can see she demonstrated their flexibility in her little toddler hands.  I have to say I think these are more than worth what RIVBOS is asking for them!  They flex and bend easily, are polarized, come in cute colors, and even come with a bag!  I want a pair for me!  In fact, I tried them on for you to see.  I think they fit me great!  Note that my daughter is a little younger than the ages specified in the listing but it is not stopping her from wearing these at all!<br />I received these at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  I honestly LOVE these and I will be buying them for our kids whenever they end up losing or somehow breaking a pair or the lenses are too scratched up to see.  We live in a sunny place and these are much needed and worth every penny!  Polarized?  Awesome!<br />Update:  these are polarized.  If you cock your head to the side while wearing polarized sunglasses and then rotate it back to the center so your head is back in line with your neck, the sky will change from dark to light.  This is because polarized lenses bend the light.  These are awesome sunglasses for the price!!!!"
5.0,Great organization...plenty of room...good looking too.
5.0,Nice band. Softer than the original. Clicks on tight.
5.0,"This is a great top.  The fit is great, the fabric is great, the look is great.  I have no negatives."
5.0,Bought these for my 3 year old daughter and they did not disappoint! Great quality and adorable designs.
5.0,Absolutely love this necklace.  Great buy as well.
5.0,for a gift..great price..good quality..
5.0,Purchased for my wife and the item was fine<br />Quality was good
5.0,Happy with my purchase! Feels like great quality! I wear them on a 12 hr shift and I have to CONSTANTLY look at my watch for time checks with my patients. I wear these quite often since I just don’t feel like changing my bands all the time and it has held its durability for a long time. I’ve had my band for about 3-4 months now. Good purchase!
5.0,Son loves these slippers
5.0,These are just perfect... I bought them before Easter so I could ness with my very Christian family by making then think I had real piercing and I had snakebites and nose and ear piercing and two left over these things are really fun and they do not hurt at all they feel just like the real thing and fast shipping too!! 10/10 I'd buy more
5.0,When I purchased this I thought its nice. But when I received this it was better then expected. It's small and perfect for a woman to wear. It was way better then what I had expected. I am very pleased with this. I would definitely purchase again.
5.0,"The first &#34;wallet&#34; I've had that really holds everything easily. Well constructed. It is not small or thin, but super functional."
5.0,Got it for my wife perfect for<br />She's 5'5&#34; 36dd 130lbs and she looks so sexy<br />I will  buy more in the future for sure<br />Awesome!
5.0,"Beautiful dress, makes you appear to have small waistline.  Lots of compliments"
5.0,This hat is great.  The quality is 100%
5.0,"Sturdy, easy to fix<br />Would be nice to have more colors"
5.0,Nice Malay for the price beads are smaller about 4mm
5.0,I have a rather large head that being said after I wear this a few times I'm sure it will loosen up. Made with nice materials and will keep you warm.
5.0,Bought it to try and get with a girl I like but she ditched me😂😂😂
5.0,Super cute. Fit well.  We loved it!
5.0,excellent quaility
5.0,Nice dress picked the other one
5.0,"Perfect size, good workmanship, sturdy zipper, cute flamingo designs."
5.0,So cute and Dainty! My sister will love them.
5.0,"Perfect fit. After wearing for weeks, it would not lose its elasticity. It would still retain its compression. Very comfortable, no irritation around the neck or arm pits. Keeps me cool during outdoor activities."
5.0,"These are VERY comfortable to wear for extended periods of time and they fold down nice and compact.<br /><br />I have not been able to take them to the range, so not sure how they will do with a loud noise, but comparing them to what I currently have, I think they will be fine.<br /><br />These are also lighter than one of the sets, so that is appreciated as well as the way it folds down and is very compact.<br /><br />So whether at the range, lawnmower, bug out bag or just throw them in your gear bag, these are excellent and lightweight"
5.0,Perdy
5.0,"I bought this jumpsuit last minute for a wedding rehearsal and it was better than I ever expected, especially for the price. The material was light and it fit amazing, I actually feel like I could have gotten a M instead of a L. I definitely recommend the jumpsuit because it can be casual or you can dress it up."
5.0,I’m a big Schitts Creek fan and Alexis is my spirit animal. I’ve been eyeing a necklace with my initial for a while and finally went for it. I really like this 🥰
5.0,Great clip-ons for steampunk outfit.
5.0,Love! I have very sensitive ears and have been able to wear these daily! I love them!
5.0,"I love this flannel! I read that it ran a little big, so I got the next size down and it was perfect. My boyfriend is 5’ 11” and 220lb and large fits him perfectly."
5.0,Wore this with a purple dress to a wedding. Stunning! Loved it!
5.0,"These are absolutely darling! And so lightweight! I can’t wear statement necklaces anymore because I had a fusion in my neck and now they really bother me, so I’ve been looking for some fun earrings that are different and I will be definitely buying more of these earrings! The bonus was how light and easy to wear they are!"
5.0,This is my second time buying from Sports Farm and they are made very well. I have used it quite a few times and has held up well. The numbers stay on tight and do not flip around all over the place.
5.0,This watch is amazing 👏
5.0,These are great classic bushcraft bags!! Very well made and classy
5.0,Absolutely loved this. My son is 6'4 255lbs muscular athlete and I usually taylor his dress clothes and I must say this was a great fit and cut. I was impressed and very satisfied. Great buy for 3 pieces. SCORE👍
5.0,"I ordered a size 18, a bit loose, true to size, I just rather order up then take in when needed. It's easier to take in, impossible to add when too small. I own at least 8 dresses of Nemidor  this is the most beautiful of them all, yet all Nemidor dresses are my treasured choices. This one I'm Leary to give a positive review because they run out before I can purchase another one.I feel very feminine and proud to be seen with this dress, I absolutely LOVE the pockets. Please bring back a couple more my size soon, I'll be waiting/watching/hoping for the green one, I so enjoy my black one."
5.0,These bracelets are exactly as described. They are very sturdy and perfect for a young lady's birthday or graduation. I am very pleased.
5.0,I love them they are great !!! In my Tony the Tiger voice than you! So I give you five stars.
5.0,"Cute earrings - and people either get it and bond with you, or they don't get it.  Heavier than expected, but that's not problematic."
5.0,"I really like these! The silicone bands that come with FitBit trap moisture and irritate my skin. These allow my skin to breathe!<br />If they get wet, they dry quickly, or easily swap out to a different band. I like that they stretch to slide on and off my wrist easily, without having to deal with a clasp."
5.0,Love this bag it got soooooo many pockets to put stuff in
5.0,They are soooooo comfortable!!!! Ive been wearing them all day around the house and even outside for a couple months. They are in great shape. Very durable
5.0,"Great price and quality. Light weight, easy to store."
5.0,Granddaughter Loves them.  She wears a 1.5 but the 2.0 is comfortable with room for growth.
5.0,"They are awesome!! My daughter loves them, we are gonna buy another pair because they are so good."
5.0,As described<br />Nice athletic pants
5.0,beautiful!! just bigger than I expected
5.0,love the bow tie and will order it again
5.0,Comfortable. Easy on the ears
5.0,So good!!
5.0,"These are super fun.  The pack has a lot of Christmas ones in it.  There are the other holidays.  But, mostly Christmas.  My daughter loves them regardless."
5.0,beautiful. I wear it daily and receive daily compliments on it. very good quality.
5.0,"I just received this product today and it's everything the reviews said plus more! I was actually a consultant for Thirty-one and sold purses for 3 Years!!! For this price, the look, and the space you can't get much better then this!!"
5.0,"These sunglasses are amazing! I wanted a pair of sunglasses to protect my eyes from the sun, and they do a great job without making everything appear super dark. They are also really cute!!"
5.0,So.. Be very sure you want to buy this jacket before purchasing it. It's from a third party seller and they are stricked on returning. They require a 25% restocking fee.<br /><br />The material is weird and hard and it fits kinda big in my opinion. The color pictures well but I'm person was more of a raspberry deeper pink. Not my cup of tea and was expensive.
5.0,Perfect top. 💪🏽💪🏽
5.0,This dress looks amazing on the one who wears it. Hubba hubba hubba
5.0,These fit so well. They are also machine washable and that helps shrink them back down after they have been used.
5.0,"Quality, Fashion, Beauty!"
5.0,I gave this as a little gift to my cousin and he seemed to like it.
5.0,Omg I get so many compliments when I wear this dress. This is a must have.
5.0,This has been used by a 6 year old for just 2 days. So far it's functioned as expected. She loves pink and loves unicorns so it's a great success style wise.
5.0,I love it! So soft yet durable and looks great!
5.0,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these socks! They are incredibly soft and comfy. They are not too thick and are perfect for booties or dressier shoes for the office work place. The fall colors are absolutely gorgeous. Also these come individually tagged so they are perfect stocking stuffers as well. For the price you can not beat this deal in store."
5.0,"I am reviewing the Adjustable Yoga Mat Carry Strap & Fitness Stretching Strap sold by NJSJ. I received this handy device as a free sample in exchange for an unbiased opinion. This product is of very good quality and I use it daily, so it receives a five star review from me. I am not influenced by free or discounted products. All opinions expressed are valid and I stand by them.<br /><br />This simple device has made my life so much easier in just one easy step. I have made myself a yoga/physical therapy mat (to do exercises post hip replacement surgery) out of an old but usable piece of mattress egg crate material. I got a piece of pretty fabric and covered it and voila, personal mat. The mat is comfortable to work out on, but rather bulky. My solution was to braid three pieces of stretchy fabric together and tie it in the middle. This was ugly, did not really hold the mat rolled tightly, and was awkward to carry and store.<br /><br />Enter the yoga mat strap. It is almost 71 inches long and 1 ½ inches wide. It is made of an extremely strong cotton/polyester canvas strap. The strap is flat except for about 15 inches where the loop holds the strap in place, where it is folded over and stitched for easy sliding of the loop. Now my lightweight but bulky/fluffy egg crate mat is bound up firmly and has a nice carrying handle. I don't go to a gym, but do exercises in my home. The mat is nicely compacted by the strap and easy to carry from closet to living room where I do my routine.<br /><br />I cannot comment on using the strap for stretching. I already have a dedicated stretching yoga strap and prefer to use this one only for its main intended use. For those who do not care for the black strap, which is what I have, the strap comes in two additional colors, purple and rose red.<br /><br />Each of my reviews is very sincere because I depend on quality reviews when I buy on Amazon, so I take the evaluation process very seriously. If my review assisted you in any way with your decision to purchase or not, please click &#34;yes” that you find it helpful.<br /><br />In conclusion, I am so happy to have received this handy product to review. It has turned my bulky homemade yoga mat into a lightweight portable exercise tool, which I am now more likely to use than leave sitting in my hall closet. Because the strap can also be used for stretching, the price is very reasonable for carrying the mat and loosening up tight muscles. This convenient mat carrier is priced to sell and a must have for anyone who travels to the gym, or just from their closet to another room."
5.0,I love this shirt! I get soooo many compliments on it.
5.0,"Bought this for as an accessory for a plain bag I had . What a difference it made , that extra pop of color was what it needed. Well made pompon"
5.0,"-Amazing material<br />-Stretchy, but fits to your body<br />-Does not fade<br />-Not see-through (squat proof)<br />-No camel-toes<br />-Beautiful colors!<br />*They looked tiny when I received them, but they stretch and fit amazing."
5.0,"Very nice. Bought as a gift, size was correct and it is a very sturdy quality."
5.0,I love the way it fits and how it feels like it is a steel toe shoe. Thank you so much I was very shaky on this product. I give it 100% and will recommend you to friends and family.
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for!  I have an intense dislike of being barefoot in public areas ... these are perfect for Barre class and they are cute and ballerina-esque! Win!
5.0,"It was cute as ever, i wore it to Vegas. The only thing that sucked were the strings rubbing against my sensitive skin and leaving marks on my collar bones for like 2weeks. Other than that, it was super cute, for right, and had the hoes hatin’. Ha! Jk. At any rate, I was in Vegas and was more worried about going out for my friends birthday than taking a picture of it, so maybe send one in later"
5.0,Fits well except I wish it was a little looser around the crotch
5.0,"feels so good i don,t want to take them off!"
5.0,"I originally bought these for my teen daughter, she liked them but wanted it smaller. I was was getting ready to return  them.<br />My son who hates the way most pants fit him saw them and tried them on. He refused to give it back so I can return them. Said it is now his favorite pants. Did I say he was picky with clothes? That would be an understatement."
5.0,Granddaughter looked adorable in it..
5.0,"This is an adorable and dainty necklace, perfect for everyday wear. The chain adjusts and I adore the matte hammered look. Definitely buy!"
5.0,"Got this because some of my toddler's shoes fit fine, but were tough to get on...especially the dance shoes. It's sized just right that somehow it can work for her tiny feet and our adult ones too. It seems durable, time will tell. We liked enough enough we got a second to put in the dance bag<br /><br />Oh, and my daughter loves her &#34;shoohon&#34;"
5.0,Oh my goodness I usually have trouble with the fit of this type of pant because I have thick thighs and a small waist but these are amazing and I was surprised by the “mono pocket” detail since there’s no fly the pocket goes all the way across left to right like a sweatshirt. My second pair of this brand and now I plan to basically buy everything
5.0,"Love this bracelet, I already have navy and grey, I wear them constantly and after 5 yrs not a single stone has dropped out. Excellent quality and so sparkly and modern looking."
5.0,"Update**I agree these do run a little big and they stretch a bit still great pants!<br /><br />I threw these on the minute they arrived and I cannot be more thrilled with them. I got them in black. I am 5’3 and 150 and the medium fit me (I’m top heavy tho—36 F). Someone taller than me over 5’5 and these might be too short and I’m small in hips they might be tight for some depending on body type. They are SO comfortable. They are very on trend being that baggy is in, but they look nice, not frumpy. Which is hard when dealing with the oversized style that is hot these days. I wear this outfit with cute chunky sandals and a ribbed white tank. But it’s obviously so versatile you could wear with many things. I want to get these in other colors but not a fan of the green from pics. Would love to purchase a pair in beige and rust! These remind me of free people for a fraction of the price!  I love finding deals like this on Amazon."
5.0,This Saturn 5 tie clip is the perfect accessory to wear with my space ties and I've received many compliments when wearing it!
5.0,"I bought these for my mother in law and she loves them! They come exactly as pictured. They're of good quality, so you can rest assured you're making a good purchase."
5.0,I purchased the prayer shawl as a gift. I am very pleased with it and the person I purchased it for is very happy with it.
5.0,The rings are as advertised.
5.0,Perfect for my husband. Goof material..
5.0,My wife loved them and they look great
5.0,Top notch quality and really sends a message
5.0,nothing to dislike about it
5.0,"Works beautifully, easily adjusts size, and warms instantly!"
5.0,"Loved this band, especially for the price. Unfortunately it broke after only wearing for 4 weeks and is unable to be returned/replaced due to the 30 day return policy."
5.0,I love this dress😍😍😍
5.0,I’m a farmer and these are great wedding bands for all my activities.
5.0,Great looking tie.  Fits as expected.  Arrived on time.
5.0,Unique. Coworkers admire it. People out in town have never seen one like it.
5.0,"Strong, sturdy and heavy, last one flew away with the first storm. Easy to install, it took my husband, my two girls and me a couple of hours to put it together. My kids were jumping on it as soon as it was readying, they love it!"
5.0,Great fit. Non restrictive. Keeps me warm as I work on lights outdoors
5.0,It was just as I expected!
5.0,"Very nice leotard, nice material. Girl is 5’ 90 #, XS fit perfectly. She loves it!"
5.0,"Awesome seller, great item Comfortable fit cool for summer wear, highly recommend to all buyers"
5.0,Es liviana y resistente. Se ve delicada en el reloj.
5.0,"My husband has a knack for losing baseball hats and leaving home without one!!  He needs one to shield his head and face from the sun.  He has a collection of logoed hats but I ordered this plain one for the car, so he'd have one when he needed one.  When it arrived, my husband tried it on and right away we both noticed that the bill of the cap is very long.  My husband (style icon that he is:) didn't want to wear it.  I tried it on and loved the long bill for sun protection. I now wear it for gardening and walking the dogs.  It's actually getting a lot more wear this way, than in the car, and it's held up well.  I've washed it once and so far, so good.  This is a typical baseball, golf type ""trucker"" cap, but with a very interestingly long bill."
5.0,This outfit looked like the picture it fit true to size and the quality was great. I’m 5ft 3in I ordered a medium
5.0,These earrings are gorges. They look just like the picture.
5.0,Bought these for my daughter 13 years in age.  She absolutely loved them and received compliments galore from her friends.  Probably will get another pair for her birthday.
5.0,"These gloves are beautiful! Soft, stylish and very comfortable. I saw others in stores for double the price that were not made as well or looked as good as these. I loved them so much I also bought them in black."
5.0,"Very professional in appearance, would love to purchase more in bulk for a better price, however."
5.0,Kid loved it so much she wont wear it. Just dances in circles with it. Thanks.
5.0,Favorite tops! Ordered 2 and will order more. :)
5.0,Love it love it love it but don't get a size bigger it will not get smaller no matter what I do. We'll made with good stiching. So what can I say but love it love it love it.
5.0,Fits perfect! I got a small and I'm 5ft 125lbs. It's very much worth the money and then some!
5.0,"I absolutely LOVE the style and color of these pants. I always get compliments! My only complaint is that they are a little larger than expected - I am typicall always a size L in pants but these have a decent amount of extra room around the waist. My first pair ripped near the seam after 2 wears, but it was replaced speedily. The pants are also a tad longer than the model picture shows. I am 5ft6in and they got at ankle length."
5.0,"This is a very cute summer outfit. The only thing is if you are short like me (5'4) and need an x large, the skirt will be too long for you. I had to pull the skirt up around my breast to give enough room from the floor to wear without tripping over my feet :) Other than that, buy it. The materials nice, not flowy, like on the model."
5.0,"My sister bought me 1 of these belts while she was out of town (we had never heard of them) because I have Colitis & my stomach s always bloated, sore & its too painful to button/snap my pants. #ProblemSolved..!!..<br />I/we LUV these 'no buckle' belts ! They clip around the 1st pant loop on the Lt & Rt & then u can loosen or tighten it up w/a clip in the back - Great for 'bloated or fat' days, but we wear them all the time ! I purchased 10 more in different colors....a Christmas present I KNOW my sister will LOVE !"
5.0,"Love this, seemed a little top heavy right out of the box but it works perfectly and is very stylish."
5.0,"I bought these slippers for my husband. He said they are very comfortable , warm & are of exceptional quality. The hard sole is great for quick trips outside, or garage. This is the second pair I’ve ordered & they  last for years. I will definitely order this brand again not only in slippers but other shoes as well."
5.0,Not only is this dress a great fit...it has pockets! The material is stretchy so it isn't stiff and makes it more comfortable on a long day. Nice pattern and style. I love oxiuly!
5.0,Used for Cos play. They are overall good sunglasses but lenses are a bit too dark.
5.0,Great.  My daughter loves it.  She says it is warm.  It is NOT a sweatshirt more like a super heavy tech shirt or super thick tshirt.  Mu daughter loves it though.
5.0,they are well made and clip on earrings
5.0,"My jacket arrived at 2pm today. Pouring rain started last night & is still raining.<br />Temps were 66 in town.<br />60 in rural area.<br />Opened it immediately.<br />I thought no way this light jacket is weather resistant.<br />Looked closely at the material. So soft to touch, color is nice deep blue, like my sweeties eyes. Nice.<br />I tried it on & it fits perfect.<br />It is wind proof & it does repel rain.<br />Now if it lasts a season or years remains to be seen. I have high hopes."
5.0,This scarf lays beautifullly and is so versatile!  I love it and will be wearing it as my favorite scarf!
5.0,Best shoes ever.
5.0,The mask is really quite realistic.  My daughter jumped two feet off the couch when I walked into the room wearing this mask.
5.0,Bought it for wife and she loves it. Comfortable
5.0,"The product is as it was listed and feels great, its a little large but workable."
5.0,This was part of a Christmas present to my wife. It is very well made with quality materials and the colors are exquisite. She smiled from ear to ear when she saw it in the Box. The only thing is we needed an extender for the chain other than that this was a fantastic purchase thanks for helping make her Christmas special.
5.0,"I have these  in a few different colors. The price point is perfect for me to leave them in my car, in my purse and in my beach bag. They work great and look cute."
5.0,We used these for a glow Easter egg hunt and they were PERFECT! bright and easy to use for all ages. I would buy these again
5.0,"Great product, especially for the price. I have very sensitive skin and can't wear earrings with nickel content. These have been great. I have worn for several days in a row, and not an issue. Arrived on time as well, excellent packaging."
5.0,Own them in every color I love them so much!
5.0,Nice western shirt
5.0,[[VIDEOID:46525746f3c0a0af9b477921e1a5d405]] I love it it came very fast and it was just to my liking!!! And I added the letters I wanted just in time before my birthday! Contact also responds you all should definitely buy this!
5.0,Product is working well.
5.0,they look just as advertised! They are so cute! I wish they came in solid colors I would buy another pair!
5.0,"Very comfortable. Excellent quality for the price. Soles are a bit heavy, but I would highly recommend these. Definitely need a smoking jacket to wear with this style of slipper."
5.0,Beautiful hoops! (:
5.0,"Good color, Good cloth material. It well fitted for my daughter."
5.0,a little thin fabric but as a lite summer shirt it is nice.
5.0,"The only problem is the bar on the top, but it was easily removed and filed down for the costume."
5.0,"Very good product, sturdy, unlike another similar item I bought that cost more but had no frame and a cast-zinc mechanism that broke after a few months (I agree I am a rough user). A small problem when I opened the pack: the clip was detached from the lenses; for me it was easy to fix, but I had to look at the old broken shages to understand the relation of the 2 parts, and I'm quite handy at reapirs: another person might have found it difficult, especially for the lack of instructions. The photos in Amazon don't show details of the connection.<br />But I'm very happy with the product itself and I won't deny the 5 stars: it's so much better than all other clip-on shades  have seen before"
5.0,I was skeptical when purchasing these for my 7 year old. She loved them. The Velcro closer is really easy for her and stays fastened.  They were higher quality than I expected. Best of all they have a pretty comfortable insole too!  Both mom and daughter were happy!
5.0,Very Nice Great Watch For The Price. Many People Say It's A Nice And Don't Believe The Prize.
5.0,This piece is very pretty and exactly like the photo.
5.0,"This is a sexy manly bracelet!  My husband loves it and he looks rugged when he sports it!!  The leather is thick and sturdy , very well made"
5.0,"Beautiful piece, very detailed work, you can make out the chevrons on the Stargate. Chain is nice, not too short, not too long. A must have for any Stargate fan.  I've been wearing it for a few weeks, and people who do not know what it is think it is just a round piece of jewelry, and people who recognize it know what it is."
5.0,I love love this dress !!!!! Fits perfect !!!
5.0,Awesome bag I would recommend it to anyone !
5.0,Love these!! Can match colors with different colored shirts
5.0,"While I bought these as bit of a gag for ""Bomb Pop Day"" they are now in my regular rotation they are soft and support quite well. Lets see what else I can find from this brand."
5.0,I got this for my husband that leaves real early in the morning. It's really worm and fits as it suppose to.
5.0,Gift for a friend to encourage her. She really liked it.
5.0,"Love this necklace, I get so many compliments when I wear this!"
5.0,"I'm runs a little big, but it's a wonderful dress!"
5.0,"Wow.  After losing another pair of pricey Bolle (left on the table of a restaurant last weekend), and not able to replace them (style no longer made), I needed a quick replacement while I look for another 'permanent' pair.  These are really nice.  For less than $10, they are polarized, fit nice (I have a little width to my forehead and don't like the arms touching my temples), and comfy.  I tried them out already and they don't slip although I need to adjust the nose thing cuz it does feel a little snug, but it doesn't slip which is more important to me.  And they stay on my head.  I was jumping and shaking my head to try them out.  Very surprised how well they stay in place.  I'm buying a couple more to keep on hand (since I do lose or break them about once a year, sadly).  I may not be looking for a permanent replacement now.  We'll see after a few weeks, but so far, these are awesome."
5.0,"very pretty, good size :-)"
5.0,I love these dresses! Nice weight fabric. 1st one I bought was the long sleeve v neck. Decided to give this a try. Did not disappoint! I am 5'2&#34; and 120 pounds average build and shape. The small fits perfect!
5.0,Striking! Forever!!!!
5.0,great room
5.0,Good fit and nice design
5.0,granddaughter wears it and loves it
5.0,"I received the item it looks really nice and casual. its simple an plan, you can wear it with anything you like. or send it to someone as a gift I highly would recommend you to order it because you would love it!!!! I received this product in a discounted price in exchange of my unbiased and honest review."
5.0,I love this ring ! It’s comfy and beautiful
5.0,I love the nice and good itims.
5.0,Nice hat!  I love it!
5.0,Fits so perfect lots of pockets and so comfy<br />Wish they came in different colors perfect length<br />Great price
5.0,"Such a good fit, but would not recommend for larger busted ladies.  This will not potentially offer enough support for high intensity workouts.  But if you are doing moderate exercises, you can try you luck.  Either way it is a really flattering top, but I am smaller on top so keep that in mind."
5.0,"Very Nice Quality, I haven't found a flute with any better detail!  My daughter loves it!!!"
5.0,The Seller was great! Very accomadating. Ties were high quality and good value. Received right away.
5.0,"I usually wear a medium I ordered a size 6XL, it fits perfectly. Arm length and waist are perfect."
5.0,THEY ARE VERY NICE.
5.0,nice enough to wear out to dinner but light and cool on hot days
5.0,I love this dress I wore this for the party after my wedding and it was amazing
5.0,"I’ve had my bracelet set for a few months, and weirdly the purple just faded. Pretty bracelet though."
5.0,My granddaughter just love it so much.  Just what I wanted for her special day.  Will be buying another for her sister who will be 21 next year!
5.0,"I ordered this as it was just what I was looking for, it was well made and fit perfect"
5.0,Bought for my son. He loves it. It fit according to measurements. The color is bright and hasn't faded with washing. It also has not shrunk after multiple washes.
5.0,"This belt is just right for wearing with jeans.  The belt buckle is nice and flat and doesn't poke or bulge out underneath your clothes like bigger buckles do, making it look like your belly is big.  The leather is really good quality and this belt should last for years.  I really am very happy with it."
5.0,So pretty- and very dainty.
5.0,I wear this to yoga class. I love the fact that it's a little longer than other jackets. I'm 5'6 and it it lays at my hip bone which makes it comfortable for me to walk around in yoga pants when I stop at the grocery store after class.
5.0,"These socks are great. Warm when it's cold, cool when it's warm. good for multiple days if minimalist hiking too"
5.0,"Looks nice, has a little bit of weight to it, which was desired in this case.  Very happy."
5.0,One of my favorite dresses🤭🤗
5.0,"Fighting crime is much easier when my pants aren't falling off. Come bedroom time, the ladies will know exactly what kind of gentleman they're dealing with.  BAM! POW! ZAP!"
5.0,"Great socks. On the thin side, but we're getting great wear out of them. Because of how they're made (what materials are used) I can tell that if they were thicker, my child's feet would stay super sweaty. Being a little thin, like dress socks, is what keeps my child's feet from sweating. The neat thing is that these socks keep my child's feet warm without them getting wet. After the first wash (I air dry) they're kinda fuzzy on the outside, but that doesn't bother us. They are made of 75% virgin wool, 23% organic cotton, and 2% elasthane. They're soft, not itchy or scratchy. If you turn them inside out you'll see threads that stick out about 1/2 inch, in a line, from where the sock touches the back of the calf, straight down to where the toe box begins (with the exception of the heel and toe box. There aren't any threads sticking out there). The loose threads don't bother our child in the least. Can't feel them while being worn either. The socks stay up where you put them. Our child is 1 year and 8 months old but she has big feet. So we purchased the 3-4 years size, and the socks JUST fit. Very little growing room for her. Lol So, for us, they fit small. :) But, what a fit. We love these socks and WILL purchase again."
5.0,Started a new job in retail requiring  many hours on my feet. These helped immensely.
5.0,Absolutely love this top! It fits true to size. I am 5’8 with a slender athletic build and order a medium. Fits perfectly and comfortably for yoga.
5.0,a bit more support than expected
5.0,Beautiful shirt but it's a little large.
5.0,Fits fine and is excellent and a reasonable price.
5.0,"Perfect-sized, all weather tote with deep pockets on both sides of the outer part of the bag, as well as plenty of space and 4-more pockets inside the bag, and the straps keep the tote closely tucked under the arm or casually draped over the inner elbow."
5.0,Perfect birthday gift! Had no problems w shipping & arrived as expected.
5.0,I absolutely love these joggers! So comfy and perfect for everyday wear or exercising. I got two pairs!
5.0,Very happy with the quality of the sweater

5.0,The feel and fit love it
5.0,"With our anniversary two weeks from Valentine's Day we usually only celebrate one. I decided to add this to the mix, she loved it."
5.0,buying the second one of same stuff
5.0,My wife loves this item were it all the time when every we are out doing errands  of grabing a quick bit to eat. Women comment and love her shirt
5.0,Great for running and sweating
5.0,"Very lightweight fabric, but not at all see through. It's pretty short, but I think it's supposed to be. Get your normal size, it will fit fine."
5.0,"Bending the bill have it the correct shape, but you can tell it’ll be a bit before it stops pressing in on the temples. This thing is going to last FOREVER. Perfect crown height, solid stitching and materials, truly a well made hat."
5.0,"Product is beautiful, fits perfectly and has a comfortable feel. Customer service is excellent. Had a problem with my initial purchase but was promptly and courteously resolved. Highly recommend AmorWing."
5.0,"Nice scarf, well worth the price."
5.0,I purchased this for the office manager at my job. . . It was a huge success. she put the company mug away :)
5.0,Absolutely love this gorgeous shawl!<br />It is super soft.
5.0,The kind of boots that u can wear with anything.  I wore this with a black mini tight dress
5.0,Really like the shorts nice change
5.0,Very comfortable dress and hugs all my curves in the right places. I will be ordering more colors.
5.0,"Very happy with this purchase, loved the variety of the colors for the price. Would highly recommend these!"
5.0,"My 9 year old daughter loves it. I had to battle her to take it off and wash it. It’s that thinner material, not the super thick, warm type of material. My kids prefer it, so they don’t overheat indoors, but don’t expect it to keep you toasty warm. We couldn’t be happier with our purchase, this was my daughters favorite present. She’s an average 9 year old size and a large is baggy on her (she wanted it that way.) it had a slight chemical smell that came out after one regular washing. I don’t think the reviews saying it’s a raincoat plastic material are accurate. It’s that usual Amazon printed hoodie material that is more of a silky cool finish not thick cotton. Again, my daughter loves it."
5.0,We are going on our girst cruise in two weels. I'm so excited to wear this cover up on the ship!
5.0,"This is form-fitting and runs small. I ordered 2XL (I'm usually an XL because of broad shoulders) and it fits more like a large. It is meant to be snug and form-fitting. I'm only a B-cup, so if you're very large-chested, DEFINITELY order one or two sizes up. It's also short in length, but kind of stretchy.<br /><br />That all said, I do like it, because it's exactly what I was looking for."
5.0,I LOVE this band! It was super easy to adjust. Just pop open the clasp and cut to size! I do recommend putting it on the watch face fist so you get the size right and cut from both ends to make it even. It comes with instructions that was easy to understand. I use this band for my Samsung Galaxy Active 2 watch.
5.0,"great fit, just as expected"
5.0,Cómodas y elegantes.
5.0,"This dress is very pretty and classy. I got the light pink shade and was very pleased with the color. It wasn't too bright or light. It is more like a light, millennial pink. I absolutely love the fit and material. I am 5'3 1/2 tall and it fits right below the knee."
5.0,"I Love them,  comfortable fashionable, and sturdy!"
5.0,"So cute and sexy! My partner is a big fan. Im a big fan too! I was looking for an undershirt that was lacy and came up high on my chest because i don't like showing off the girls too much, but I wanted something romantic too. Very happy with my purchase"
5.0,This pendant is so cute. I had to have my cat of 17 yrs put to sleep.  I wear this  in  honor of her.

5.0,This was a really great mask. Well-made and fit well. I ended up returning it because it turned out I did not need it.
5.0,Love it gave as a gift because I loved mine
5.0,"Nice simple bow tie. I use it to practice making knots, but it is very well made it could be used to any occasion."
5.0,I accidently ordered the smallest size but thought is was so cute when I got it (just too small...like for a child).  I emailed the seller about an exchange for a larger size and they said go ahead and keep the small one and we'll send you a new one in the larger size. I was so impressed with this customer service.  I can't wait to get the new one.  It's so darn cute.  I'll give the smaller one to my niece.
5.0,Keeps me cool in hot sun
5.0,Purchased these for my wedding day. They were exactly what I was looking for and did not disappoint.

5.0,These are not too thick and worked well for helping to find our bags.
5.0,"I'm just getting these, there was a mix up with the post office. However, I'm very pleased. They say that the overalls run small so I bought the 'Med.' instead of my regular small, they fit perfectly like overalls should. Thank you."
5.0,"High quality and very nice.  One of the prettiest fleur-de-lis charms I've seen.  Actually, it's the ONLY fleur-de-lis charm I've ever seen that I like.  Quick mailing, and I'm happy with it."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:35f23a8f05c2de80568a95eedb2e4295]] Awesome sunglasses! I have never worn them, but now I can't live without them. Very dark, and look great on me."

5.0,Great look on my vacation
5.0,Its came quick and it fit my wife perfectly
5.0,I bought these because I had used them before.  Good for wet and cold situations while still being able to work.
5.0,"At first I wasn't a huge fan. The fabric is polyester and stretchy and looks and feels cheap. However I did use it as a sleep shirt and it was perfect for that! It definitely doesn't look as luxurious in person, but it's not all bad"
5.0,Nice shades. It’s fits my fat face very nicely
5.0,Just got it so this is just the first impression but it really looks good.  It's different and hangs great on the gold chain I got to go with it.
5.0,"This is a beautiful top. It is actually encrusted<br />with embroidery and jewel-like accents. With<br />that said, it does not look conspicuous or<br />showy. It is dressy and it is also relaxed."
5.0,These were used on my shoes for my son's wedding. They looked beautiful. The flowers are on bendable wires so you can adjust them to your liking. They can be clipped to front of shoe or on the side. I placed them on the front of my shoes and found them to be very comfortable - I never felt the clip against my foot. Highly recommend
5.0,I purchased this chain as a replacement for a pendent necklace that had broken.  It arrived very quickly and is exactly as described and what I wanted.  I would definitely purchase from this seller again.
5.0,Surprising quality for last minute overnight replacement ties for wedding!
5.0,"I didn't realize that she wasn't in school, in person... no mini ceremony. So we took it as an opportunity to share with the family a various social distancing gathering. It was so sweet to share such a small milestone with so many people we cared about. So thank you for listing on Amazon and providing such a quick delivery. Although we missed in person school, the celebration happened on a bigger scale than we imagined. For a family that lost an important person in their group, this was much needed."
5.0,"Nice bras, true to size"
5.0,"Beautiful bracelet,  love the look"
5.0,"Extremely spacious! Enough for a light sweater, a very full wallet, water, keys, 15&#34; MacBook pro, kindle paperwhite, big headphones and some extra pockets in the front for anything else."
5.0,wearable
5.0,"I've owned this hat for 5 years now. I wear it every time i leave the house and an not going to work. The hat holds up well. None of the stitching has come loose and no other quality issues. After many years in the sun the outside of the hat has turned brown, but hey i guess that shows its earned its faded colors. Am buying another for if something ever happens to this hat"
5.0,"They look really good on, however the nose part seems a little wide, however I did like them and keep them anyway"
5.0,"I love these tee shirts. They are not heavy material, and they arrived just wadded up in a bag. But they are 100% cotton, really soft, the sleeves are not too short, and the fabric is sort of peached for softer colors and feel. They run fairly long, if that's to your advantage, but it's not a problem for me. They fit well and I don't have to pull down the full length for my short frame, they just sit at my hips. I'm 5'3 160 and a large fits me great. I've ordered twice and gotten some different colors each time. Unbeatable for $4 each."
5.0,These are my favorite scrub hats. I have bought about 6 already. Love the designs.
5.0,"Lettering is good, seems like a well made keychain 🤙"
5.0,"This is a gorgeous scarf made of polyester with a very silky feel. It is to be hand washed only. It is really lovely to feel and to look at, so delicate in detail. There were several different colors to choose from and I chose what was called the Red, Gold and Blues Multi Color 6. I've presented four photos below for you to look at so you can see the richness of it. I don't see it keeping a person warm on a cool night as a shawl, but it will be perfect as a scarf and no doubt would look lovely hanging in a room or draped to dress up an area in your home. I just love it!<br /><br />I was given the opportunity to review this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
5.0,"Good looking shorts, fit as expected and well.  I purchased a 2nd pair in white and my panties do not show through.  Love them"
5.0,"This flannel shirt is very well made. True to size. Bob loves the shirt, says it is very warm. Has held up being washed, in laundry mats while he is on the road. Gives him moving room in it. Great shirt. ( Bob is wearing a shirt underneath) I hope this has helped. Thank You"
5.0,"Now this is a great leather band for your Apple Watch!  I like the sporty look, perfect fit and the stylish design.  Pleasantly surprised that an extra wrist band was included which is a different style - see my pic above!  Excellent value and one happy customer!  Definitely recommend this product."
5.0,Very comfortable and fit just as expected.  Would definitely buy again
5.0,I enjoy these
5.0,"These are great shorts! They fit true to size, excellent quality. My husband like them so much we went back and ordered them in every color."
5.0,Para un regalo muy bonito.
5.0,I got this just cause it looked cool. The detail is exquisite. It looks small but it actually fits the ear just fine. You cannot put it on the rim of your ear because it will fall off. The back does not sink all the way into the other part (the thin needle like part of earrings) so don't assume it's broken or anything.
5.0,The material is a soft comfortable feel. fits as expected and very cute!
5.0,"It's a bit small for our 2-month old - it fits pretty tightly. However, the material, design, and appearance are excellent. The feet are especially very cute, with those dinosaur feet design. The full length zipper is very convenient as well for the diaper changes."
5.0,"Love these workout capris! I bought 2 sets when I first started working out 4 months ago, and had to buy another set in a smaller size a few weeks later. (I have lost an amazing amount of weight).  They have held up great being worn 1-2 times per week each, and I can probably go another 5 lbs or so before I need to order the next smaller size.  (I am down 33 lbs in 4 months and only had to buy in 2 sizes so far.  They give and are forgiving as you shrink into a slightly too tight pair and don't stretch out of shape.)"
5.0,"Quality hats at this price point, and very cozy.  I got the black and charcoal grey, impressed with the soft inner liner.  Quite happy."
5.0,COLORFUL AND SOFT
5.0,very good !
5.0,I love these joggers. They fit great and are extremely comfortable. I am a curvaceous short woman so I got these in a large so they wouldn't be tight and they fit great. They are not baggy but are not super tight either. They are just right. I am definitely going to purchase more in different styles.
5.0,"I ordered two as gifts for young 20 something ladies, both loved it and wear it often. Super soft! I told my son's gf that if she didn't want it, I would wear it (lol!) she wouldn't let it go! Quality stitching!"
5.0,"Great digital watch! The color is a little darker than the pictures, and kind of metallic too. It has a good alarm function. So far, I am enjoying it."
5.0,It fits perfect!!!! Pretty good quality<br />My wife looks great on this leggings
5.0,I love this dress. It's soft and flows. It doesn't hug in the wrong places. It's very comfortable
5.0,Gorgeous ahead of Its time
5.0,Surprised and amazed so much compliments even if not cosplay would look nice simply going out
5.0,"This works well as a sling strap for my Nikon DSLR camera. The sliding motion as you move the camera up into shooting position is a little jerky and awkward, but otherwise it's great. It seems to function best when the strap is slung across your left shoulder onto your right hip. What I like most about it is that it has 2 closing pockets along the strap that can hold an extra battery and/or memory card"
5.0,"My kids wear sunglasses year round and its a must especially when we are out and about. They have held up months later with no lenses popping out, which I appreciate. Would definitely purchase again."
5.0,My father has been wearing it everyday.  Very oroud
5.0,"I love this piece of lingerie. During the COVID-19 time, I've decided to spice up my sleepytime which turns into my daytime wear. It hugs my small frame but not in a restrictive manner. The pink shade is feminine and cute. The panties although are ""sexy"" are not my thing. However, for the more adventurous women out there, you can definitely play peek-a boo!! Anyways, this was worth the money!"
5.0,It is sturdy. And I wear it everywhere. The color hasn’t rubbed off. No complaints over here
5.0,love the feel and the look of them and like said love dragons so i pull the look off quite well so lets see what else i can pull out of my hat
5.0,"I love this wallet. It have enough space for my cards, a zipper for coins and a place to keep my cash flat. It is wonderful. I will but again."
5.0,Excelente!!! Me gusta mucho cómo se mira. Muy cómodo
5.0,"We moved internationally and I had an abundance of electronics to keep my three kids entertained for a 17 hour day on the flight.  This grid was the perfect solution for organizing all those cords, plugs, chargers and ear buds that seem to come with every device.  They make these grids in almost every size.  It was difficult to decide on which size but I went with this 12 by 8 because it was the perfect size to easily fit in my backpack.  The webbing snuggly hold everything in place and there is a zippered section on the back that is perfect for instruction manuals or boarding passes.  I have concerns that the elasticity of the webbing will give out eventually but I see no signs of stretching yet."
5.0,got these for my 4 year old daughter she loves them
5.0,"my hubby says im so pretty cute with it ;) it would really it protects and keeps me warm on winter with the hoddie and collar :) it is cotton blended, polyester, high neck sleeve and long sleeve. i love the color combination too, black and gray. it fits good for my petite size. very good quality clothing, cozy and comfy!<br /><br />i received this product for free in exchange of honest and unbiased review."
5.0,"Our nieces were thrilled with these shoes. They come about 2 sizes too small, but the Amazon return procedure didn't make this a big problem. If you want to thrill kids in your life, buy them. They are cool shoes I wish I had as a child . Awesome."
5.0,Bought this item for someoneelse
5.0,"Very cute top, material is comfortable and light but definitely not stretchy.  I really like that the straps are adjustable."
5.0,"I am a runner and used this when I had a bout with plantar fasciitis after over doing my training. Along with easing off the training for a month or two and doing a few exercises on my own I got through the problem. I wore the sleeve at night and even sometimes at work. I believe along with the other changes I made, it helped . This sleeve is also well made."
5.0,Great gift I got for my son he loves it great material.love it
5.0,very comfortable and very flattering
5.0,Just as described. A bit heavy but you get use to it quickly. Very pretty. And comfortable.
5.0,Love the key chain
5.0,"I keep buying these exact jeans for my daughter, she's obsessed! Obviously, I don't mind, they look fantastic, aren't overly expensive, and hold up will."
5.0,"Looks just like the picture, I got it for my son and so far no complaints.<br /><br />We had no problems at all."
5.0,Love the color and it fit just as expected. No complaints at all only compliments
5.0,Bought the blue as a 2nd pair for my wife. She loved the first pair (black) and wanted another pair because they were SO comfortable.
5.0,"Gosh we love these lightbulbs!  I do lots of crafting and sewing and purchased these lightbulbs instead of the other ugly and expensive full-specturm light fixtures that are otherwise available (Ott-light, for example).  These bulbs fit right into your existing fixtures and emit what at first seems like blue light compared to your regular incandescent or other CFL bulbs.  We quickly got used to the light and I find these to be excellent task lighting for late night reading or hand sewing sessions."
5.0,The best part of this dress that it's easy to put on. There is no zipper in the back. You just tie it together.
5.0,Bought these for a kids birthday party- we let the kids mark them as part of the things they got to take home. Was a hit!!!
5.0,Size true. Looks great. Very warm.
5.0,"so very pretty,just like a carribean ocean"
5.0,I have long legs and these were well above my knee!  I luv it!
5.0,"I was looking for an oversized long top to wear with leggings and this is perfect. I'm 5'7&#34; and about 160 lbs and the XL fits a little loosely and can be an off shoulder, but that was what I was looking for - a long top that slightly hugs the hips for a bit of shape. I may get other colors too."
5.0,super nice design and style!
5.0,"Just adorable, loved it!!!"
5.0,"These bandanas were just what my husband wanted: large size and attractive pattern. In fact, they were much nicer looking than the picture even. When I unwrapped them, I was concerned that they wouldn't hold up to washing, but they washed and dried just fine."
5.0,Very soft and cute for the price
5.0,LOVED the vintage look!
5.0,Very comfy and nice color combo.
5.0,The price combined with the durability have made this my go to watch. I don't need anything fancy or expensive just a watch that keeps time.
5.0,"This scarf is SO soft and luxurious.  I wear it in the neckline of my coat.  The way it is made allows me to use it as a light blue scarf, a dark blue scarf, or a combination of light and dark blue. It's my favorite scarf."
5.0,I brought this as a gift for my patient who lost hers at the hospital. I searched everywhere for a robe exactly like this and had no luck so I figured I would get on Amazon and just my luck they had it! My patient loved it so much and told me that It looked and felt like her old one. ♥️
5.0,"Buy this skirt!  At first I was a little a turned off by the fabric texture, it's very polyester and thickened almost shiny.  Then I tried it on, all the things that turned me off initially are what makes it work on.  It's what makes move, this skirt swings when you walk.  I actually had strangers stop me in the street, in the grocery store, in the crosswalk to tell me how great I looked.  It wasn't me, it was the skirt."
5.0,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mom as she loves pinks.  I hope she loves the vibrant colors of this.  Would buy from this seller again.
5.0,"nice , warm and as described"
5.0,"They feel very comfortable and fit well for a large person, they keep this fitting good after washing"
5.0,I've loved anchors since I was about 13 (I'm now 20 and still in love). These earrings are the perfect size and they're freaking adorable. Will definitely be buying more from this seller
5.0,"Great little bracelet. Goes with my style very well. The string to tighten is is kind of annoying to use, mine keeps on loosening up, but it only takes a second to tighten back up again. The braided part did come detached from the main part, but a little drop of super glue and its perfect. (I would suggest gluing it anyways just so it does not come off)  But I like it, its comfortable and cute."
5.0,"I bought these sheets after buying pillowcases from the same company. I was very happy with the pillow cases so I decided to order the sheets as well: these are perfect for my Airbnb. Def a great buy. They are easy to wash, wrinkle free and seem comfortable and good material so far."
5.0,"I bought this dress for a wedding and I loved it!! I didn’t have high hopes, but it feels amazing, fits amazing, and it was so cute!!"
5.0,Love them! Just as Pictured!
5.0,These lovely earrings can be combined with a pendant to provide a beautiful gift for the mother and child sharing February and August birthdays. Not too pricey but worth a mint of memories!
5.0,Very beautiful love it bought another for friend!
5.0,Casual dress really soft. It's thin and stretchy like jersey knit. I ordered a medium at 5'9. 165 lbs. But I like to show off my best asset the waist which is loose. This has pockets and is not see through but definitely light material. I will take in a little at waist
5.0,Beautiful color and great fit!
5.0,Love these i will be ordering more very soon
5.0,"I am surprised at how great these look especially at the price. I bought them because they were cheap, expecting to probably wear them once and then forget about them, but they have been my main sneaker for a while now. I have had many 'nicer' sneakers that I never wanted to wear because they were $70-100+ and I didn't want to ruin them. At just over $20, these I'm not afraid to drag them through the mud because I can buy a new pair without hesitation. They hold up well and just look like a nice, solid, non-showy-off sneaker and I plan to buy more and different colors in the near future"
5.0,Waiting for the car!
5.0,I got this dress for formal party and I have to say fit perfect. I'm big bust 36DD small waist and small hips. I ordered the small size it was perfect got many compliments.
5.0,Good ítem
5.0,Fits perfectly on my name tag..
5.0,Bought it for my son in-law he just bought a gibilih he loves it😬
5.0,"I just received this mask today in purple! It is beautiful and fits perfectly! It also came 1 day early, so I am very pleased overall with my purchase! It is very well made and the colors are so rich and vibrant!  I also love the elastic strap on the back, as it is so easy to take on and off.<br />I originally wanted the blue but could not wait for delivery, but the purple is just as gorgeous!<br />I highly recommend this mask !"
5.0,Love this shirt. I have one in black and another in red.
5.0,"I PURCHASED 3 PAIRS OF THIS BOOT BLACK, GRAY AND GOLD SUEDE . ARRIVED SO FAST, MY HEAD SPUN. ALL THREE PAIRS FIT PERFECTLY. THEY ARE HEAD TURNERS, AND THE PRICE IS UNBELIVABLE. VERY, VERY HAPPY WITH THIS COMPANY AND PRODUCTS. THANK YOU ,<br />  HAPPY NEW YEAR.....DEANNA C."
5.0,Very nice belt.  The quality is FIRST CLASS.  Well constructed buckle.  Well constructed and functions very well.  The belt material is strong and high quality.  This is an EXCELLENT belt.  I'm very very very happy with this company and their belts.  This is the 3rd belt I've purchased from them.  Testimony in itself to how enthusiastic I am about the quality and style.  I wear mine with cargo pants and jeans.  They're stylish and look high quality when I'm wearing them.  5 very happy stars!!

5.0,"I ordered this tee shirt for my husband, It is true to size, soft cotton, and did not shrink when washed and dried. The color is a few shades darker in person and my husband loves the color."
5.0,Off tha chain
5.0,"Soft and comfy, cotton socks are impossible to find. Perfect foe cold weather."
5.0,"It was packaged well and arrived inside an envelope. The info cards are double-sided which is helpful in case you make a mistake or something changes. The ends are stitched, so very durable. Glad I got them!"
5.0,It was just as beautiful as pictured.
5.0,Love it! Has a bit of curve to it. Can't see through.
5.0,she wears them.
5.0,I purchased this item first of all for the 95% cotton thinking they were actually be soft I was wrong they're very very soft for the price that I pay for four pairs it's just amazing it's hard to believe that there are actually 95% cotton they are the softest pair of underwear I ever own they have last and they clean just perfect very small and very very hot and sexy finally at after purchasing my second pair I have just ordered another set of four I have a look and look for better ones and I have not found anything better than this I will definitely will buy more after my third shipment that will come very soon Hamas and definitely definitely one of the best buys you can ever make in underwear
5.0,"This scarf is beautiful, its classy and super soft, came nicely packaged and love it perfect for any occasion"
5.0,This shoe is exactly what I was looking for.  I wore them to an event for hours & they were pretty & comfortable!
5.0,"This was a great quality dress. I chose to return it because it was too big, and the neckline is higher than I could see in the pictures."
5.0,I gave this to a male co worker and it fit him really well. The last one I bought didn’t. And he loves it and the buttons.
5.0,Great quality!  Great fit and style!  Nice case included!  Polarized!

5.0,Favorite headband
5.0,I absolutely love these locks! They fit nice and tight to the plates and are amazingly simple to lock in place and unlock to unrack. I'm so glad I found these.
5.0,"I have a very narrow foot. Normally, I would wear a seven narrow. However, since the Ortha heel sandals do not come narrow,  I have gone down to a six medium.  Unfortunately, my styles are limited because I have to choose the sandals that have a Velcro  fastener.  The fit and comfort of the sandals is what is important since I have an extremely high arch plus some planter fasciitis.  I am now walking free pain - hallelujah!!"
5.0,These are sparkly and beautiful. I got these for my daughter for Christmas--they look as good as the earrings my husband got me that were way more expensive.
5.0,Excelente producto y muy buena calidad
5.0,I didn't like the idea of haveing no belt hoops. I baught to be the star at parties..
5.0,The product runs very small so make sure to order much larger but the quality of the product is extremely nice and better than the pictures!!
5.0,"I'm actually obsessed with this chocker, and the blue bead stands out nicely."
5.0,"this is a very easy mask to breath through, not as hot and stuffy as some I've used.  Plus what a bonus I get to show my love for  the G S D breed"
5.0,Such bright colors- very nice material-makes my guest bathroom feel like an oasis
5.0,good quality and works as expected. I recommend this.
5.0,"Not too tight, feels comfortable"
5.0,They help with my rls..literally helps my circulation issues too.<br /><br />Not to mention how cute they are.<br /><br />Id buy again.<br />This is from a critique...I approve.
5.0,"A tiny tiny tiny bit larger than I would have liked, however once I wear them I'm sure I'll change my mind ❤ I have purchased another pair of earrings, actually a couple from this company, and haven't had any allergic reactions ❤ That speaks volumes to people who have had some really bad experiences with sensitive ears/skin!! Bought these to match the remarry me ring my husband got down on both knees to propose again after all our years together (the ring is the real deal oh my. What I had before was just a diamond band, that I was perfectly fine and content with. But this was just wow❤❤❤ Also, FYI, I found a necklace similar to match from Kate& Chloe I believe it was. I now have some bling for date nights to go with my ring💐 Would definitely make purchases from this company again ❤"
5.0,Very good for my hose
5.0,My all time favorite Athleisure brand. Fit is perfect. Super comfortable and washes well.
5.0,"My daughter bought these for me in red for Christmas. She read reviews that advised ordering a size down. She did and they fit perfectly. I love them. They are comfortable all day long - even with a bone spur in my heel!! In fact, Crocs are the only shoes I can wear without pain right now! I love that they are scrubbable. I also love that they look so dressy, but can be worn casually, AND are so very comfortable."
5.0,My so loves these
5.0,Bought as a lightweight robe or after shower or at night. Fits great! A little static that I hope will go away with a wash or after worn a while.
5.0,Beautiful blanks! Works out well for my vendor show no tarnishing so far it’s been about a month
5.0,"Plusasa La Lune Sleeveless White T Shirt - *Arrived way ahead of estimated delivery date!<br /><br />I love edgier unique clothing - whether it’s a vintage find at an estate sale or a throwback hipster cast-away at the thrift store – bringing it home and finding a way to incorporate it into my work wardrobe makes me grin. Given my penchant for finding interesting clothes, it’s not often that I buy new, it’s hard for me to find the uniqueness and character in brand new clothes – Plusasa is changing that for me! Plusasa has a fashion line that gives me the option to buy high-quality new clothes that have a fresh, unique, edginess that set them apart from ‘mall clothes’. The La Lune Sleeveless T-Shirt is my newest addition from Plusasa.<br /><br />The La Lune Fashion T-Shirt is a well-made sleeveless T that provides an androgynous edge to a decidedly feminine cut shirt. Sizing is import-standard – I am 5’3” and around 135 and the XL shirt fits me perfectly. The Polyester base is blended with lycra, nylon, and elastane to keep this top washable, wearable, and looking as good as the first day I wore it. The weight of the fabric falls between a standard t-shirt material and a light broadcloth which lets the shirt drape beautifully while having the softness to gently hug those girl curves. The sleeves have a deep urban ‘cut-off’ look but don’t fray even with repeated wear due to the high-quality material. The printed design is bold and well-defined with no color bleed. The finished neckline is classic girl-t style and the fold-over is expertly tailored. Hem and seams are double stitched and all stitching is straight, even, and perfect. Designer tag at the inside waist line means no tag at the neckline which I love!<br /><br />I received the Plusasa La Lune Round Neck T-Shirt at a promotional cost in exchange for an unbiased review and love the great quality, the unique design, and I especially love the outstanding versatility of this top."
5.0,Its beautiful like the set
5.0,"I love this dress so much! It’s very flattering, and since I’ve put on weight I don’t have much to flatter. My shape is not what is once was, but you can’t even tell with this dress! I almost wish I would have gone down a size though. I’m a 5’4” woman with 36G and 170 pounds."
5.0,I love this watch! It is not bulky but very nice and thin.  I might wold prefer it a bit smaller but it’s just something to get used to. My large wrist accommodates for it anyway.
5.0,This dress fits me perfectly and I have received many compliments.
5.0,"Pretty silver anklet. I have worn it for almost a month and no green tint. I wear 24 hours so, even going swimming hasn't produced any skin discoloration.<br />Will buy from this company again."
5.0,Love it!!!! Adorable with leggings!!!
5.0,Love this dress. It fits very well and very chic
5.0,"The Rose Gold is stunning. If the cz was a bit larger, say 1.5, or 2.0 ct. It would be perfect."
5.0,"I ordered the Mahogany and it's a bit more purple and less burgundy. But I love it. It's just the right size to be able to hold all your purse stuff, plus maybe a book and a journal. It's the perfect size for me. The straps are soft enough and long enough so that it's easy to carry on your shoulder (some satchel type purses have stiff straps and you have to carry them by hand, which I hate). All in all, a great purse for the price. It doesn't look fakey either. A nice looking leather knockoff."
5.0,My grandson loves this chain. It is so rugged and manly looking yet beautiful and elegant. It compliments his cross I gave him. Thank you for making my gift a success!
5.0,These work great for keeping sweat out of my eyes and from running down my neck.  I need to order more and soon!
5.0,love the fit and nice length with leggings
5.0,these were the perfect birthday present for our princess
5.0,Get nice glasses.  The chicks dig me now.  At least that’s what my wife says
5.0,very expensive looking
5.0,I love this so much. Its helps my belly to become flat specially when i wear dress.
5.0,Love how it fits. Nice color and no need for an undershirt.
5.0,I bought this necklace for my 14 year old granddaughter's birthday.  She loved it because she doesn't like anything formal or prissy looking so this was just perfect.  The chain is as it appears (like a keychain design) but that was fine with her because it made it more athletic in appearance.  The stones are small so not too gaudy.  I'm happy that she's happy!
5.0,"Got this for my son, adult male, who loves Kingdom Hearts.  He wears it all the time.  Hand washed and still looks great."
5.0,super cute and trendy. very comfortable.
5.0,Love this bag!! Being able to connect it to my stroller is awesome!
5.0,Arrived on time and fit as expected.  This was a gift for my dad and he loved them.
5.0,"very cute, fits my small head well."
5.0,"When I ordered these I was pretty amazed at the quality of the item. I assumed it was going to be cheap but the lens were not scratched, nothing was bent, and everything moves without resistance. Great item and was definitely worth the price."
5.0,These bracelets are beautiful!!! They came in exactly like the picture and the go with ANYTHING!!!
5.0,"I was pleased that the top fit well.  Definately an 8/9 top.  Material is not heavy and not see through, so you can get away with not wearing a bra."
5.0,Absolutely love these sunglasses! I recently had cataract surgery and decided that I needed a really good pair of sunglasses.  So many good choices but these were my favorite.  I get a lot of compliments on them.  Great product.  Love the gray lenses.  Work really well for me.
5.0,Looks exactly like the picture and a beautiful piece of costume jewelry.
5.0,Absolutely love these hats. They are warm and fashionable. I love in buffalo ny so it’s imperative that I have warm gear.  100% satisfied.
5.0,Just right and looks good!
5.0,Great rocks!!  Super fun to paint!
5.0,It's a cute Halloween dress.
5.0,love it size was great.  No cuffs but seams ok.
5.0,"Llegó antes de la fecha indicada, me gustó es muy cómoda, me cabe todo lo que necesito, la calidad del material no es muy buena, pero el precio es justo, y esta bonita."
5.0,Love my bag!  Need to get one in black too!
5.0,"I wanted something I could use for cutting glass bottles, they work great."
5.0,These cufflinks look expensive! Great for formal or casual occasions!
5.0,"My father said it best, in a recent conversation: ""A cellphone is not a man's timepiece. You need a wristwatch.""<br /><br />It didn't take much convincing: As a young prep on the verge of leaving college and entering the workforce, I needed to find a wristwatch which was not only unique like me, but also professional enough (if a bit edgy) to wear with a suit in the months and years to come. This Fossil wristwatch fit the bill perfectly. It's eye-catching, but not flamboyant; conservative, but not stuffy. And just as importantly - especially on a student's budget - it's a quality, handsome timepiece that doesn't break the bank.<br /><br />The strap is very comfortable, and could easily be swapped for another cloth band in the color of your choosing - personally, the navy and white works perfectly with my preferred palette - or dressed up with a leather band, if you so choose. I was nervous that the watch itself was a bit large, but I've quickly found that I had nothing to worry about - it doesn't weigh me down, and while a bit on the large side, it's not gaudy. Although it features a chronograph, I wouldn't necessarily wear this watch for sport - I don't think it's of shoddy construction, but I can't imagine it would look so nice if subjected to excessive wear and tear.<br /><br />If, like me, you're looking for a wristwatch that's not run-of-the-mill but won't leave you looking like a fashion victim, you could do a lot worse than this watch from Fossil. I've heard nothing but good things about fossil watches, and I'm sure that, with a bit of care (and luck), this wristwatch will age well with me."
5.0,"Seems like a good dupe for the lularoe version, I can't wait to try styling it like how it is styled on Pinterest :) plain but versatile!"
5.0,This is beautiful and fits nicely on the head. (not too tight)
5.0,"It was too loose and it was way too short. It felt like a long cropped if that makes sense.  There’s no compression on it whatsoever. It might still work tho so I’ll keep it 🤷🏻‍♀️<br />The color is nice. Not too light. It’s like a grey-ish blue.<br />I ordered an extra small in revival dusky pink and that one was perfect. The length was just right. The compression was perfect. It fit my body perfectly. The color was amazing. I’m not sure if the difference comes from the style? I’d stick to the revival line better.<br /><br />***update*** the seller contacted me and sent me another pair of leggings. Vital marl blue in XS. These leggings fit way better. Right out of the package you can see the difference. Great compression, great length, no baggy-ness. The seller was very helpful throughout this whole process! Highly recommend"
5.0,Cool for a costume party!  Looks very classy.
5.0,Purchase for my daughter loved it no dislike!
5.0,This dress is classy and gorgeous! I love the way it fits :)
5.0,It's beautiful. I got lots of compliments. Love it !!
5.0,They fit great! Have a good stretch to them. They wash well & hold up. I don't have big thighs so I can't comment on how they fit in that realm but they are comfy and a great go to pair of casual shorts at a very good price!
5.0,Love the way they feel love them
5.0,"I was in the process of buying a ski mask from another brand when this popped up as a recommended item. It was so cheap I thought why not just toss it in the cart? As it ends up, I use this item WAY more than the ski mask I bought, which actually cost more and claimed to be breathable. Why? A)This thing is super warm and comfortable. B)The face part is super breathable, and does not fog up my ski goggles or glasses. The ski mask fogs up both, but this thing does not. Highly recommended, especially at the price."
5.0,I ordered according to the size chart. I am usually a medium however u might want to size down. The product is great quality. A bit on the longer side.  It’s great material. The top portion shows a little too much but it can easily be fixed by putting a pin or hemming it from the inside but it’s an easy fix. But it’s a great sexy dress
5.0,They are very good shades. Frames are strong if you drop them. Worth the price.
5.0,Girlfriend loved it. Then she cheated on me and got knocked up and left me sooooooo......but no it looks nice no defects. Just make sure the woman you’re giving it to deserves it 😢
5.0,Beautiful neckalce

5.0,love the Megan Dress perfect for shorrties no trailering needed the perfect fit for every occasion!!
5.0,This anklet is so beautiful. I love the little balls on it and I am thrilled that it's all Sterling Silver and I was able to get one big enough for my ankle. Thinking about another one and I'll definitely use this same seller. Completely satisfied
5.0,"Great quality, comfy and a good style for exercising because it's not low in the front. I am usually a small but ordered a medium and it's big. I am 5'9&#34; 125 lbs and plan to order other colors of this shirt in a small."

5.0,Beautiful and holds my fine hair great!
5.0,"This T-shirt is so comfortable! I usually wear a size small but I ordered a medium and it fits great. A small would have fit too but I was hoping for a more loose/long fit and the medium was perfect for that. I love wearing this shirt around the house because it’s so comfortable, but I have also worn it for a casual night out with friends. It’s so versatile which I love."
5.0,"I was amazed at how well this fit. I was so nervous about purchasing a swimsuit without trying it on, but it worked perfectly."
5.0,"Entrega rápida, antes de lo previsto. Excelente la calidad del producto y a muy buen precio"

5.0,Cool colors. Keeps sweat out of my eyes really well.
5.0,Delivered on time. Looks just perfect on wearing.Must have product and matches most of the stuff we generally have in our caddy.
5.0,The draping is so different and very comfortable.  Love the thumb holes too
5.0,Just what l wanted. Nice watch.
5.0,lots of room and made well
5.0,Came just as it looks. Good quality. Now all my jewelry matches! Yay.
5.0,"Fits as expected. Great shirt for the price. I prefer a softer cotton than this shirt is, but I figured this would be the basic t shirt thick cotton feel."
5.0,"I have never written a review before, but I love this swimsuit!! I have tried on many suits, and his is by far my favorite. Very comfortable and good quality material. I'm 5'7, 150 lbs and I ordered a medium. It fit perfectly!"

5.0,This shirt fits perfect. I followed the washing instructions and has not faded or shrunk on me yet.
5.0,"This watch is an updated version of one that I bought around 25 years ago. That one is still keeping perfect time despite many immersions in water while white water canoeing and several falls off horses. I bought the updated version to take advantage of the improved compass, and temperature and pressure sensors. The new version promises to be even better than my old beloved version. My only nitpick is that the day/date can be a bit hard to read in some lighting situations as it is superimposed on the barometric pressure display box. The back light on the new version is much improved over the older version, however."
5.0,"Love the shirts. Very comfortable, wash and wear well."
5.0,I wear my cap by the pool and have no worries about getting sun on my face.  I am in my 60s and trying not to get any more &#34;brown spots&#34;.  I think this will help tremendously.

5.0,"It's nice fit,. I like it."
5.0,Fantastic Wallet. Perfect fit for my cards!
5.0,I'm a 7 3/4 ball hat size and I would say this almost a size 8. Very nice hat! I am extremely glad it was purchased for me. They usually tend to shrink a tad bit after awhile. Similar one like these can run $100. This is really a bargain for the price!
5.0,"Nice little pin, pretty sturdy where the tack is attached in back."
5.0,Excellent quality and well received as a gift.
5.0,"This is a fitted-style shirt. Was perfect fit but, would size up if your little one isn't a peanut. Enjoy!!!<br /><br />PS-it washes well and the glitter is holding on strong!"
5.0,Quality feeling hand purse that fits my ZTE phone (without case). Love the Navy blue. Very happy with product and customer care.
5.0,Perfect size for me. Not too large but not too small. Good weight and quality for the price. Probably will get another in different finish.
5.0,My 10 year thought they were awesome. She’s happy so I consider that a win.
5.0,"I had to return the first just because I have broad shoulders and long arms but t was so pretty I decided to get the next size up. Very pretty and looks even better in person than in the photo. I also love the length of the dress. Not to mention, the dress is super comfy. Although you would want to wear a slip under the dress, it's still a great buy."
5.0,"Good quality and fits as expected. Bought this for 12yr old daughter who is 5’4 and 120lbs, so I wouldn’t suggest it for a bustier/taller woman."
5.0,"I'm 5”11 170lb and I chose M size, it fits great and the quality is better than what I thought. I do recommend this jacket!!"
5.0,I did not expect the quality for the price. This is very good quality!
5.0,"very pretty , just show when you move head"
5.0,"I like this lanyard better than the sparkly rhinestone ones I’ve been wearing. Nothing comes off, and it’s far more comfortable to wear around my neck. My students and I are Peanuts fans, so they like it too. It was delivered in a timely manner and in excellent condition."
5.0,I love the fit and feel.
5.0,Fantastic hat!!! Worth the wait!!!
5.0,Its a classy beautiful bracelet - exactly what I was looking for. I wish it came in different size options as I have large wrists but I love it just the same. Great find.

5.0,swelling in legs
5.0,"These sunglasses fit my almost 3-year old perfectly! The soft, rubberized finish is nice too. Comfortable and stylish!"
5.0,"These do have an odd fit, as others have mentioned. The sweater is a bit tight on your body and the arms a bit long. But it is well made and I expect to use this for many ugly sweater parties and feativus celebrations to come."
5.0,Great shoe! It is holding up nicely with a 6yr. old boy.
5.0,Love this little top-perfect compliment to my colorful palazzo pants -worn to a jazz festival and received many compliments
5.0,"pretty comfortable shoes to walk in, not for distance though. i’d give them an 8/10."
5.0,"Honestly, I bought this without even reading the description. I needed an umbrella and this one is great. It operates easily with the push button and it feels quite sturdy. I am planning to order a second one soon, so I can keep one in my car as well."
5.0,My daughter looked amazing
5.0,Very good! Fast shipping!
5.0,"Cute masks for kids, but each pack came with a pink mask.  Wish the listing would have showed that. Needed all boy colors."

5.0,Love these pajamas—I will be ordering another pair
5.0,"Love this dress, wore it to a wedding and got a ton of compliments. The only  thing, I read some reviews and sized up, it wasnt necessary.  I'm a 14/16 38DD. I am wearing the 2x, but will order an xl next time"
5.0,"Fits well, looks dressy and great price!"
5.0,Love the Dress fits very good
5.0,Elegant and comfortable. Wash in washing machine and hunged to dry.
5.0,"I loved the packaging, the cufflinks, everything. MY SUPERMAN loved it. Thanks for helping me make his day. Great Fathers Day gift or just a gift for the SUPERMAN in your life"

5.0,They are very comfortable and fit perfect
5.0,"Beautiful, great quality, and it can be used to dress up a great pair of jeans!"
5.0,"I purchased the Navy Blue Quarter socks. Seemless toe. Entire footbed in cushioned. It is not to thick or to thin, would call it medium cushion. Overall nice quality sock for the price. I would recommend. (Shipping takes awhile since it comes from Great Britain.)"
5.0,Gave them to my grandson and he loves them. His older brothers now wants a pair.
5.0,"This is a pretty robe that's light enough to wear in hot weather. The material doesn't breathe as well as 100 percent cotton, but it's fine indoors. I like the long length and the pockets. The size I normally wear fits well, but it's loose enough that I can pull it on and off over my head instead of unfastening it. It would make a good gift as well as something for yourself."
5.0,Love it made great
5.0,"Super cute, yet classy.  Runs a bit big, but looks good as well even if a bit wider.<br /><br />Got a Large and it’s too big (135pounds and 5.4Ft)"
5.0,Love it super warm!
5.0,This dress is so cute! Unfortunately I ordered a M and they sent an XL. I gave it to a friend and she absolutely loves it!
5.0,"This is exactly what I was hoping for. Fit perfectly, priced right and was delivered as promised. Thank you for coming through."
5.0,"These earrings are as cute as a ""button"""
5.0,"Me agradaron mucho, porque son grandes y nada pesados!"
5.0,Gave this to my friend for her awesome friendship!!
5.0,usually they run small we orderd an 2x and its def a 2x but keeping
5.0,Dislike the band.  I brought the wrong one.  Can you return it?  thanks
5.0,Would buy again for<br />Sure
5.0,Love the dress and light smooth material. Arms are a little itchy.
5.0,"These are nice bandanas and I like the large size.  They are only printed on one side, but they are useful for most uses a person would have for bandanas."
5.0,"Great fit, value and looks great! I have paid 4x more for a lesser product"
5.0,My husband had shoulder surgery so we purchased 3 of these shirts because his arm is in a sling. This shirt was perfect with the snaps
5.0,"I am very happy with this, it is going to make a wonderful present for my Mother.  Great workmanship, and the packaging was perfect."
5.0,These feather earrings are perfection!  I purchased a pair for me and one for my daughter-in-law.  She has a severe allergy to nickel.  These earrings are lead and nickel free. Beautiful crafted. Not too small and not too large. The packaging is excellent. Very highly recommended.
5.0,"I bought this for a vacation to Orlando in July. I was a little skeptical, and everyone who saw it before my vacation laughed at it. However, it worked out great in practice. As others have said, it needs direct sunlight to turn the fan. This actually meant that I avoided shady areas because it was much cooler to stand in direct sunlight with the fan working than in the shade without it! It survived getting completely soaked at Aquatica and a lot of people in the parks commented on it - I think they were all a little jealous!<br /><br />One minor drawback was that my niece's really long and fine flyaway hair got caught in it a couple of times, requiring careful extraction and some anguish. Apart from that I have no hesitation in recommending it."
5.0,I have size 6 feet and the socks fit me very nicely.
5.0,Really love this bag - perfect for everyday but I can see the value as a travel bag as well.  Great quality of construction.  Yes the leather is really leather.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:ac10a62bd2ce3314c36f261c42273245]] I obtained this bucket hat unisex sun protection cap to use whenever I’m outside in the sun.<br />-This is a nice lightweight hat.<br />-It features a drawstring to keep the hat on your head when the wind is blowing.<br />-It’s made of polyester which drys quickly.<br />-It’s got a built-in sweatband along the inside that helps to keep your head dry.<br />-The brim is wide to keep your precious skin from getting sun burned.<br />Overall, it’s a great bucket hat for being out in the sunny summer months, and I highly recommend it!"
5.0,"Really great product for price. Far nicer than the picture! High polish, sparkly and large stone! Definitely a nice gift!"
5.0,"My daughter likes this leo,she says its comfortable."
5.0,"Estaba un poco preocupada porque leí reviews de muchas mascarillas de tela , y es difícil encontrar alguna que te haga sentir que tu hijo va a estar seguro , en cuanto la recibí en mi casa la abrí y cuando se la medí a mi hijo de 7 años le quedó perfecta , le cubre muy bien la nariz y la boca y si hay personas a las que les pares a que es de material delgado , tal vez , pero con el filtro que se recomienda usar creo está más seguro ."
5.0,"Fits my Pandora bracelet like a charm (lol). Looks great, holding its shape and color very well."
5.0,"Great hat ..but hard to tie under chin ., I got a cord slider"
5.0,Awesome!!!!!!! Wore at the jingle jungle 5k at Disney world
5.0,Definitely warm! Kinda thick though
5.0,"Perfect color and great quality.  Just the right size - no check book slot which I did not want, (don't carry that any more.)  But, lots of room for organizing without becoming a mega wallet.  Very nice."
5.0,So bright and colorful. A BTS curio too. Well made and arrived in sealed plastic pouch.
5.0,"I am very particular about the underpants I put on my girls.  I do not want children's underpants that look like bikinis.  I hate pop culture or Disney characters on kids underpants.  There are a ton of other brands I have purchased and loved on amazon but these are by far the best.  Nice full coverage, wide sides and generous crotch.  Soft fabric and covered waistband.  They were a little big but shrunk slightly to the perfect size.  And they have been my daughter's favorite."
5.0,Great for outdoor yard work!!!!!
5.0,"This bag totally met my expectations. Even it's not leather, the quality of the material is really nice in comparison to other pleather products I've had in the past. It feels really durable and has tons of space. There is definitely enough room for all of my stuff as well as my kids and husbands stuff, because everyone thinks I should be keeper of their stuff. Now I can easily keep track of all my stuff as well as everyone else's."
5.0,Very well made. Thick. Well finished. Looks like it would last a long time.
5.0,fun cute
5.0,"Comfy, warm, and cute"
5.0,"I sit for hours at a computer each day. My feet were experiencing tingling sensation due to lack of movement of my legs, even though I take breaks to stand up and walk. These compressions socks helped relieve my feet. I will be purchasing more so that I have enough for each day of the week."
5.0,These short/skirt are so comfortable! They look great and fit great.
5.0,"Very nice tunic for work and play. Alittle big, but workable"
5.0,Great value for the price! Nice shades!
5.0,"The picture on Amazon.com showed a bright pink shirt with the words ""Well Dressed & Coffee Obsessed"" on the front even though the description said Christmas Winter Penguins All Over Gray Nightgown Long Sleepshirt and that's what I ended up with.  I actually like the one I received better than the one that was pictured.  The color didn't matter to me - I just wanted a soft, long sleepshirt and this one fits the bill.  I ordered 2 sizes larger than what I normally wear so I wouldn't have to worry about shrinkage but it didn't seem to shrink when I washed it and dried it. It comes to my knees but that's OK too.  I had bought a Secret Treasures nightshirt last year at a Walmart while on a trip when I forgot to take a nightgown.  I am now doing all my shopping online during this pandemic so I was glad to find this brand on Amazon.  I would recommend this nightshirt."
5.0,I’m 223 normally wear 14 in jeans n XL tops but I bought the xxl thinking it’s going to run small but it didn’t. I could have gotten the XL but I kept but I like some things loose fitting but fit a sexier fit u can buy your reg size
5.0,Easy to use and just as secure as traditional key rings.
5.0,"Exactly as pictured, and a nice sturdy buckle."
5.0,"I felt physical pain having to return this exquisite confection. I had heard that dresses from Chinese manufacturers ran small so I sized up. HUGE, tragic mistake. When it arrived, I was stunned by the beauty, by the workmanship (the inside was as gorgeous as the outside.)  Then I put it on.  [cue sad violin music]  I'm 5.3 1/2 and 112 lbs, but I swam in the size 6.  I spent an hour in disbelief, tugging, folding, imagining what a skilled tailor could do to make this work. But alterations would have cost more than the dress and would have most likely cut off one of the most sublime features: the red roses at the bottom. Even so, I spent several days with this beautiful thing slung over a chair in my room, imagining myself as fairy tale princess about to wear this for a tryst with my true love. I hoped the magic of this dress would somehow make me 4&#34; taller and 20lbs heavier overnight. Alas, I had to accept the fact that I am a runty Olive Oly, not a statuesque Cinderella, and that the dress had to return to its misty origins in fairyland.<br /><br />I paid the price for waiting too long to shop for a dress (formal wedding in 3 weeks) and not reading the questions and answers that were pretty darn clear on the sizing. They offer custom sizing, with very specific dimensions. Had I to do all over again, this would have been my route.  I am sadder but wiser. Really sad. [end sad violin music]"
5.0,I love the whole package perfect all around great gift for a best friend ❤
5.0,"I loved this at first view. Gave it to my daughter for graduation. She loves it! She immediately put it on. The description didn't state, but the chain is about 24 inches."
5.0,My 11 year old loves it!  He wears it everyday.
5.0,sunglasses were perfect. dark lens keeps sun out great.

5.0,Love the charm and the color
5.0,Perfect prop for any Fortnite party!!
5.0,I have received so many compliments!! I love them!! Will be buying another pair. Do they come bigger?
5.0,These were great for our softball tournament for Halloween!! We were the super sluggers and the tutus were lightweight enough to not interfere with playing or running but sturdy enough to never tear at all! Great price for the quality especially.
5.0,"So pretty, and doesn't irritate my brand new navel piercing."
5.0,These are very comfortable sunglasses that really keep that sun light out! The quality is good and the frame is very durable. Besides being so attractive I recommend these sunglasses for the quality and price.
5.0,I love the glasses the good contrast a different outfits great product
5.0,Absolutely amazing!!<br />Wear these under dresses & it's so comfortable.
5.0,this shirt has a very nice feel to it.  purchased the rum color and it will go with lite or dark color pants.
5.0,"Excellent.  They do not slide down, good compression."
5.0,I bought this dress for a funeral. She loved pink so this fit in perfect. I wish it would of been a couple of inches longer because I am 5'10. But overall I love it.
5.0,"These earrings were purchased as a gift. I have ordered from this seller before and the earrings were very nice, especially given the cost. I the sparkle was brilliant and the silver was stamped 925. Nickel free is always a plus for me since I have a nickel allergy. Will buy again from this company!"
5.0,"This is an amazing price for a light, soft, warm sock that is really made of merino wool!  Judging by how well they wear, there is some synthetic fiber in the mix, but a lot of wool.  They don't come in fancy patterns, but they keep my feet warm.  They wash well and though they do shrink if you put them in the dryer, they don't shrink catastrophically.  I can still wear them, they're just a bit shorter.  I do recommend letting them hang dry, if you can.<br />After one winter of wear, they are thining slightly in the heel, but no holes yet.<br />I liked them so much that I'm giving them as stocking stuffers to all five members of my family this Christmas.  Buy them! You won't be sorry."
5.0,Beautiful mask! I wore this to a New Year's Eve masquerade party and got raves. Great quality for the price. Would definitely buy this brand again.
5.0,"really relieved a lot of foot pain for me, especially in terms of arch support"
5.0,"Beautiful, comfortable and very convincing! I get tons of compliments when I wear it."
5.0,"My 8 year old grandson! He loves it & wants to wear it everyday! When I put it in the washer , he stands & waits for it👍🤗🤗Very happy"
5.0,Great no tie laces. Easy to install.
5.0,The tshirt was well made. Nice graphics. It was too large for my Dad. It might run a little large.
5.0,My daughter loves her night gown. It’s super soft and the colts are so bright and pretty
5.0,"I have to say that I did not like the dress when I first got it! The material felt really strange, so I washed it and hung it to dry, and it is perfect now!  I’m 5’8” and 130 lbs, I bought a size small and it fits perfectly!!  I wish there were other patterns in Sz small!"
5.0,"I bought this dress to wear to birthday celebration and my daughter dress was mess up so i let her wear it and that was it ,i only wish i came in red so i could buy it  love,love it"
5.0,"Very nice everyday hat. Fits good, true to size. Delivery was good. No complaints and I have 20 some hats."
5.0,I really like these as I like to wear my own shoes out in the water. These work great and are everything I was looking for!! The belt system is great
5.0,"This dress is great! The length is perfect (I'm 5 ft even); I have the straps tightened as far as they can go, but I'm not even sure that's truly necessary. The general fit is great-- it's definitely a loose, breezy piece though. I'm rather chesty, but I felt like it drapes well over curves and the size Small (I'm ~115 lb) doesn't over-expose cleavage. I was worried when the fabric seemed really sheer holding it up to the light, but when I put it on it seems to be fine-- I stood in a variety of light and I couldn't seem to get any outline of underwear at all (this is with the navy polka dot fabric).  Very glad I took a chance on this well-priced summer dress. Wears well belted or unbelted. And the pockets are great touch. Can't wait to wear it out."
5.0,Very nice; will probably wear it lots.
5.0,"These are the best gloves I have bought, they fit good & keep my hands warm"
5.0,"Finally!  This is the first  bag we have ever had that holds all that we need for the beach.  We have only had it a short time and used it twice, so I can't promise its durability, but it seems very well made"
5.0,The fit and size were exactly as expected.  Shirts feel good and look good.
5.0,"Bought for my son in law, because he’s a Hugh Chevy fan. He wore this shirt out. He wears it a lot."
5.0,"These are perfect, exactly what I was looking for, sexy and very unique!<br />Highly recommend using a garter belt with these, to keep them in place.<br />NOTE THE SIZE RUNS SMALL -- I am 5' 8&#34; and 140 lbs, long lean legs - and the PLUS size fits me perfectly.<br />This is unusual, as this brand (leg avenue) usually runs true to size.<br />But trust me, if you are over 5' 6&#34;, get the plus size, otherwize they won't reach your garter belt!!"
5.0,Perfect for work as a correctional officer! Definitely helps during summer with the heat and vest.
5.0,I but a Angel iron on and everyone loved<br />Fit great and easy to clean<br />Thanks
5.0,"Very cute dress! Perfect length, very flattering neckline, and gorgeous print."
5.0,Beautiful top for summer! Looks just like the picture. Very happy and satisfied with this purchase!
5.0,"I bought this pack only because I wanted the half mask abs just in case it didn’t look right, I had others to choose from. This mask was EVERYTHING! I got compliments all night. It was super comfy and stayed in place. I loved that it was lace so it was breathable material. I’ve tried other masks that were hard plastic that was extremely uncomfortable after a few hours. If you’re questioning getting this mask…. GET IT!!"
5.0,Love the look. Very comfortable
5.0,"I love my new pajamas. I've been waiting over a year for my size to come back in stock and I'm very pleased. I will wear the fleece pants and long sleeve cotton top all winter, not just for Christmas time. Sharing my love for Star Wars!"
5.0,love these earrings.  lots of compliments
5.0,Looks as pictured! Packaged properly.

5.0,"Really like this purse.  Get lots of compliments, too.  Room for everything.  Good quality."
5.0,For the price it is great
5.0,Perfect for weddings
5.0,Seems well made.  Holds 2 9 foot poles with reels and 4 5 foot poles with reels.
5.0,"The delivery on this item was very quick.  The socks seem to be of good quality.  They are not super thin, but are thick enough to feel like they will last. Like that they are simple, just maroon with a white logo.  My son does not like printed or patterned socks, but he will wear these."
5.0,"I love these, I’m a woman 5’6 / 130ish and these are so roomy but have the perfect drawstring to snatch your waist. I like my sweatpants baggy so I sized up to a large"
5.0,"Love the colors, chain and fastener is also nice, gives you about 2 inches of room to change the length of it.  Colors are vivid and clear. The size is appropriate for the chain.  I really like this piece and wear it all of the time. Well made and seems to be a pretty sturdy piece."
5.0,Seems well made and durable

5.0,I really liked these I got them before winter came and wore them this winter. Well worth it .
5.0,Most wrap dresses are flattering because it masks all the right spots! It was just as expected. Would buy again!
5.0,"These are exactly what I needed!  These are my Costa sunglasses, they are ridiculously expensive.  The lenses have held up well but sunscreen and bug spray have degraded the plastic frame.  The tips of the arms were cracked and pulled my hair out.  Painfully.  I tried hot glue, super glue and paint to seal the cracks without success then found these cute little socks.  Ta-da!  At first I bought the small ones they did not fit but the return was no hassle.  These are large.  Highly recommend!"
5.0,"This dress fits very comfortable, I got a Large to be safe, and it is very breathable. It is long enough not to worry about it being too short when I walk, and the material is thin but very comfortable. It is great for it's price."
5.0,These were perfect for my daughter's birthday. Adults and kids were able to wear them for the party. Loved it!!
5.0,Perfect fit perfect look
5.0,These was great and durable my son took a bad hop line drive in the hot corner off these and they never broke or even cracked the slightest. We will be buying a few more pairs for him to have.
5.0,"I wear a dress size 16 and ordered an XXL! I LOVE this swimsuit and omg I can’t wait to show it off and get compliments like seriously I feel soooo hot in this, like no one can tell me anything. Material is good and double-lined. Get this suit."
5.0,"I know this product says “plus sized” but I’m 5’2”, 115, 32DD. The vanity panel on the back would NOT cover a plus size fit. It fit me very well! The shoulder straps were too long, that was the only negative"
5.0,I'm going to wear this for fathers day.
5.0,"This was a lot more extravagant than i thought! :) i thought it would be really small, but it's actually quite large! It is soooo beautiful in person!"
5.0,I ordered this for an eight and ten year old.  Although the 8 year old it hangs on the floor it looks great and they both love their kitty talils.  I'm 5'8 and it is a great size for me as well.  I'm very pleased with the quality of this company.  At first I thought they were a bit pricey but the extra cost was totally worth it.  These kids have been wearing these tails non stop to school and church and everywhere and they still look great many months after purchase.  So many compliments.
5.0,"Great fit, exactly as pictured."
5.0,these just arrived and I  love them! They are true to size
5.0,Husband love the watch! Sleek and worth the price.
5.0,This shirt is great for tailgates! My boyfriend wears it to work and his coworkers love it. Makes for the perfect gift for a Buffalo Bills / Star Wars fan!
5.0,Reminded me of my High School days. All of the girls had one. Fits well.
5.0,I LOVE these socks.  They are of a nice quality and the colors make me smile.  They fit comfortably and they keep my feet cushioned and warm.  I will definitely buy them again.
5.0,I picked this up on a daily flash deal through Amazon as a gift for my brother.  He is particular (kind of a metro) about his style choices.  The look of this watch is great.  He has not dealt with any the quality issues that it seems some have come across.  I am thinking about ordering a similar one for myself.
5.0,Was worried it wouldn't be big enough but did and has some room too. Light weight so not too hot to wear anywhere either
5.0,I am so excited to wear these. They are more 'Bling' than I expected.
5.0,Had previously bought some carabiners but they were to hard to get on and off my belt loop.  This product solved the problem.  Very happy with it so far.
5.0,I love this dress. I'm on the big bone size. I got a large and found I needed a Medium.
5.0,These are amazing! I wear them every day!
5.0,"Awesome quality, great for kids."
5.0,"I have this in two prints.  I love it so much.  Comfortable, flattering, inexpensive, it's an all-around win."
5.0,Both pair of these glasses look great on
5.0,I really love this purse very nice quality. The only down side is it doesn't hold its shape very well and things get lost in it.
5.0,It looks a little bit like a robe but the material is great and the print is exactly how it looks in the picture.
5.0,Sturdy and well crafted.
5.0,"Love these earrings and you cannot beat the price!  They are heavy though, and I don't think they are truly silver like they say.  I am almost sure of it."
5.0,Love the vibrant color!  Definitely buying again.
5.0,These hats are so soft my baby loves them! They also give him room to grow. I will most likely buy more.
5.0,Love the style i just wish the quality was a little better. They broke a week later.
5.0,I loved the color and the dress! Definitely would buy other colors. Grace Karin dresses never disappoint me. I’m wearing an XL. I wore it to a wedding and everyone said they loved this color on me. 🥰
5.0,"Fit perfectly, 6 pockets with 4 having strong Velcro fasteners."

5.0,These 2 masks are exactly what I was looking for!  They look great and feels great when wearing them.  I love them.  Thank you very much for this product.
5.0,"I bought this 2 sizes to big because I hate tight fitting clothes. I was not disappointed, the material is silky and stretchy so the fact it was oversized didn't detract from me enjoying lounging around in it. If I had ordered it to ""fit"" it would have been not as enjoyable because it would feel like I was stuffed into it like panty hose."
5.0,I love these socks I bough for my grandson!
5.0,"Lightweight, comfortable, and really good clarity.<br />Makes working on the computer less stressful on my eyes, no headaches."
5.0,Fantastic necklace.  My son loves it and it's nice and big.  Great for any Star Wars fan.  Seller extremely nice.
5.0,"Fast delivery, beautiful addition to my other bracelets"
5.0,"I receive review products for free or deeply discounted in return for a fair and honest evaluation of the product. Free or discounted merchandise does not guarantee a positive review. Negative comments will be mentioned if there are any, as well as passed along to the vendor. If my review is glowing, it is because I truly think highly of the product in question.<br /><br />I received the Lecxci leather cross body wallet/purse free in return for my honest review. After using it I give it 8 stars. Well, I wish I could. It gets 5 stars and a wonderful review.<br /><br />This purse is one of the nicest I own. The color is absolutely beautiful, just as it appears on the product page, a beautiful deep Rose more Pink than red color. The leather is soft, supple smooth with a slight wrinkled appearance and a beautiful gloss. It comes with a nice long shoulder strap, about 50 inches long, which can be adjusted shorter, and a wrist strap to use it as a clutch.<br /><br />Internal magnets hold the purse closed when folded over. There are zippered pockets and card slots galore. The purse measures just over 10 inches by just under 6 inches. There is a zipper on the outside of the purse. When unfolded the entire purse unzippers to reveal a compartment that is about ten inches.<br /><br />Just inside the opened purse is a brown satin with embroidered roses lining 4 x 10 inch slot. There are three other compartments, one zippered and lined with the brown satin, a center leather lined slot containing slots for six cards, and an additional slot lined with brown satin containing slots for another six cards and a zippered compartment.<br /><br />The purse can be kept nice and slim holding a few ID cards, some cash and checks, a phone and a few other items, or you can load it up and go for broke so to speak. The leather, I cannot state firmly enough, is of superior quality, and the stitching is excellent and color matching. The purse comes in another two colors, a lovely tan/gold, and black. I believe this purse should be a part of every woman's collection"
5.0,Bought these for my daughter for Christmas because they were on her list. They are soft and according to her very comfy and help her create the visco girl look she denies she is aiming for. Amazon price was very good and the first pair didn't fit and returns were extremely easy.
5.0,Perfect shoe for little boys.  Can be dressed up or casual.
5.0,Nicely fitting sunglasses; durable; fun race car case included.
5.0,"Wasn’t my style, will use for outdoor activities"

5.0,"I'm 5'1"", bottoms perfect length. Wist I could wear all day."
5.0,purchased for my granddaughter. It fits perfectly and she loves it. the quality of the dress is exceptional
5.0,"My daughter absolutely loves her new dress. It is a perfect fit. We shopped on tons of other websites and were unable to find &#34;The Perfect Dress&#34;<br />Finally to Amazon we went. Not only did we find &#34;The Perfect Dress&#34; but we also found fantastic Accessories, (ex. Necklace, Tiara, Shoes). Such great prices with great deals. Shipping was fast and extremely efficient."
5.0,Cute shirt. It's ribbed with the cross detail at the back. I normally wear a size small and got a small. It fits perfectly.
5.0,Happy with sweater!
5.0,"Love this bag!  Used it for a recent trip and haven't switched back to my regular bag.  Love the phone pocket that goes across your chest so you have easy quick access to it.  Only thing I didn't like was the water bottle pocket.  Doesn't hold it too good, need some kind of drawstring closer to make it tighter.  Love the little quick access pocket on the side!"
5.0,"Love the dress, very comfy.  There was a small flaw in the actual material!  I know it's there but, know one else does"
5.0,"I really loved my night vision glasses!<br />I wear contacts and the bright lights always dazzle me while I am driving at night, so these glasses have been very helpful. Also, my conventional glasses fit in perfectly, so this is a win win!<br />100% recommended!"
5.0,"Nice shirts, funny saying"
5.0,My son loves his glasses! Fits him perfectly. He’s 3 yrs old.
5.0,"This bodysuit has a smooth, silky texture, so it will feel like a second skin, against your skin. It has adjustable straps and snap closure on the bottom, which makes is more convenient to slip in and out of it, and when we need to use the ladies' room. ;) So they certainly put some thoughts into the design, which is great. Since most products have poor designs and not very comfortable to wear. It has a really simple design, but look very classic and classy at the same time, because it's not overly provocative.<br /><br />Overall, these will look great underneath the sheerest gowns/dress or wear alone, underneath a sexy leather jacket/blazer/light coat. This bodysuit looks very chic and very slimming without restricting your movement. They feel great on and fits like a second skin. I love this bodysuit so much, I got it in nude as well, because they look great and fits great."
5.0,"Just the right size, beautiful!!"
5.0,Purchased this for my husband and he loves it! Super soft! Reminds him of the robes we wore at the resort for our honeymoon. It has fuzzies that come off but the wash should take care of them. Recommended.
5.0,I am a size 4. This sweater fits me perfectly. It’s cozy & soft. It can be worn like a off shoulders sweater too.
5.0,"super cute, storage space is decent and overall quality is amazing."

5.0,These are super cute. My niece loved them. They came in a little plastic jewelry box- which made them look very special.
5.0,I’m plus size and this fit beautifully. High quality look. Goes over my LuLaRoe Carly perfectly!
5.0,Fitting well and warm
5.0,"Ive had my 5 watches from lux woods for 2 years now and the batteries are still going strong! CRAZY!!!!<br /><br />To be honest I can't go anywhere without someone grabbing my attention to ask, &#34;Hey!!! &#34;Is that wood!&#34;<br /><br />Then I take it off my wrist and let them hold it to show off how shockingly light it is. After that me and my gf giggle about how that's now the 7th or 8th time today! lol<br /><br />If your thinking about buying an 8-900$ watch...Could you do me a solid and slap yourself in the face for me!!! Thanks...You could've gotten 15 of these!<br /><br />I would say don't get 15, but maybe 4 so you can have a different style for every outfit.<br /><br />Once you go wood...🤣<br /><br />I took some pictures of my watches I have 5 but the other ones in the car and I'm to lazy right now! lol<br /><br />P.S. If you ordered these watches 3 days ago you'd be wearing it already..."

5.0,Great cap ...great price
5.0,"Color , fit,"
5.0,It’s a perfect size
5.0,It’s really cute but it has to be tailored to fit mine the pic as it is rather wide like a traditional sweatshirt and not thin-fitting like the pic.
5.0,"This fits a bit small, I'm usually a small or 4 or 6 women's depending on the brand. For this top I ordered a medium and glad I did, the medium fit perfect! Love the red! For reference, I am 5.8 and 130lbs with a small upper body."

5.0,L XL great quality
5.0,Very nice quality for the price--got tons of compliments. Very bright red color.
5.0,"I ordered this dress in x-large after reading the reviews, I usually wear a size 10 in dresses, it DOES RUN SMALL, especially in the bust area, I am returning it, with that being said, I already ordered another one in xx-large, I loved the dress, it's a great style and it seems to be well made, I might even order it in another color❤️"
5.0,Great enjoyed it very much.

5.0,I bought this ring as a present and the person who received it absolutely loves it. It is very pretty and an excellent value.
5.0,I hate bathing suits and they never fit right and I'm always uncomfortable.  THIS ONE IS GREAT.  It's actually flattering.. that never happens.  I can't say enough about this swim top.  The only one that I am able to wear with my large chest.  Highly recommend.
5.0,I got it for my daughter for an event at school.  It's looks so nice with her haircut. I hope that she is able to wear it a few  times before its tarnished.

5.0,Very comfortable and elegant dress. I received so many compliments.
5.0,Clear view with these glasses. It was easy to switch from reading to watching something further away. Perfect for reading at the beach!
5.0,"If you’re looking for a basic, easy, comfy sundress then you’ve come to the right place.<br />This dress is so cute & everyone agreed that we would order more in other patterns &/or colors!<br /><br />She’s 5’9”, 145 lbs, 34B & typically wears size Medium or 8/10. I ordered the sunflower pattern in a Medium & it’s just right.<br />The length is just above the knee & she’s tall, so it would be longer on someone shorter. It’s not lined, so either braless or a strapless bra is needed & the straps are adjustable. The fabric is a single layer rayon that’s loose & swingy, not clingy at all.<br />Plan a few minutes to steam it after opening (it steams quickly) & you’re good to go!<br /><br />[NOTE]: POCKETS!! Having pockets kicks this simple dress up a notch. They can’t hold super heavy things, but a lip gloss or your hands or even your phone for a few minutes. They also give the dress some extra fabric for extra flowiness…<br />Love this easy sundress.<br /><br />**Thank you for reading this review & I hope that it’s Helpful!**"
5.0,"Great price, Didn't fit, had to return it"

5.0,"Best brand toddler shoe I have found.  The sole is flexible, but sturdy.  My son walked at 9 months, and the comfort and flexibility of these shoes made him eager to wear them.  I bought 6 pairs of various styles for him so that I have them as he grows - he's in his 4th pair and has loved every single pair."
5.0,These appear to be well made.  I've have them for a month or so and have had no problems.  Easy to adjust size.
5.0,jus rite
5.0,"Very cool,very good quality glasses"

5.0,"I'm using this as a travel case for my pills and vitamins. Because the cases screw together, I can take one case for an overnight, or as many as I need for longer trips. The box keeps them together when they aren't in use. Great little product."
5.0,They are wonderful and look so cute.
5.0,"These fit perfect, look good, great material."
5.0,Everything met my expectations.

5.0,"Bought the xs, and for reference I am 5'2"", 107 lbs, 34A and the fit is perfect. If I were to want to wear another shirt under would prob go with a sm. I bought it to use at water parks with bathing suit top and swim skirt to protect me from the sun and it was just what I was looking for. Ended up wearing with shorts also since so comfy. Washes well and air dries quickly."
5.0,This bead is really pretty.  The flecks of gold that are part of the swirls really add to the bead.  The swirls are nice and three dimensional.  I will definitely enjoy using these beads!
5.0,Nice a tight. Very comfortable. Doesn't feel cheap. I'm going to buy a couple more.
5.0,Very nice.  They have every size imaginable.<br />The quality is unmatched anywhere else.
5.0,well buy again
5.0,"These are cleaning monsters. First couple of runs was in the kitchen.  Pots, pans, dishes, entire kitchen was cleaned in record time.  Pro tip -  Do all the soaping first and all the rinsing last.  In some cases it might help to only put this on one hand and a regular glove on your other hand so one hand isn’t soapy.<br /><br /> Later will try this on sports equipment  but not sure about my car.<br /><br /> This was a genius invention. Works 1000 times better than those junky silicon scrub gloves.  More comfortable as well with a soft inner lining. They are quite stiff But that does not cause an issue, I assume they need to be that way for durability. At $20 these things better last"
5.0,"I was a little hesitate at 1st due to not knowing how the shirts would fit being I'm a women working in corrections. However, I absolutely love them & recommend them to my fella brothers and sisters in thr field. And just a little tip if you want it to fit nice and tight order a size smaller there perfect!!!!"

It feels very light and comfortable.<br /><br />The quality seemed very nice. This would make a great gift. It would be good for Mother's Day, her birthday, the winter holidays or any other occasion.<br /><br />It seemed well made. It went on just fine.  I would recommend it.<br /><br />It is nice that it is real sterling silver."
5.0,Love the look and fit! They are effective too.
5.0,Nice dainty ring. Perfect size for me. And the I think it is prettier than the picture. Love it sine it is my birth stone!

5.0,Perfect for my daughter on Halloween! She loved the “fluff” on the skirt. Great value!
5.0,"This dress is beautiful!  It runs slightly large, so you may want to size down.  I added some extra ribbon trim and lace appliqués to give it a more authentic movie look and I added flowers and a chiffon chin strap to the hat that comes with it.  The boot covers didn’t look so good, so I didn’t wear them.  The dress is high quality—it looks so much more expensive than what it costs.  I received so many compliments and my husband and I won first place in the costume contest."
5.0,Cute pants! Only down fall is worn once and the bottom of the bells started threading.
5.0,Charms were very easy to install.

5.0,"everything I wanted!!, its a bit small for holding multiple BULKY items on both sides of the sipper center but it works out a little better that way n e way.

5.0,Very cute and comparable to others!
5.0,"This is not the first time I am wearing a Zaful bikini. I liked my previous ones and ordered this. Another good bikini. Very comfortable and doesn’t slip at all. As i am a bit plump, i wasn’t sure about the criss cross design would look good or fit. But it fit well and looked great. Zaful bikinis are great"

5.0,"I am a huge silicone fan. I love these silicone rings. I have a couple that I like to wear. This fits as expected. I have a thicker one but I like this one now because it's not so thick. It is flexible and durable. There are many colors to choose from. I wear mine as a wedding band and I will change out the colors to fit a holiday month or if I'm going to go out, I will wear a color to go with my outfit. I've no complaints on this silicone ring.<br />They are quality rings, great price and I do highly recommend these silicone rings. I would rather wear one of these and lose it, than to wear a thousand dollar ring and lose that. These are great for those that can not wear their metal rings to work. You can put your metal ring in a locker and wear your silicone ring while  working.<br />My husband can not wear his to work so, he wears a silicone wedding ring now. We absolutely back them up 100%. love love love them.<br />►i received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. i was not influenced anyone in any way of my opinion of this product."
5.0,"Great fabric, holds it's shape and doesn't wrinkle too badly when washed"
5.0,Really cool piece of jewelry. A must-have for a Boba Fett and/or Mandalorian fan.
5.0,So cute and lightweight
5.0,All time favorite shirt ! Fits great !
5.0,This skirt is fantastic. The weight and flare are perfect.
5.0,"Great product, very strong 30x lenz. I have others I paid much more for that are not nearly as good. You should buy these."
5.0,Great strap. Heavy duty. The holes are super tight like they should be. Strap is a great value and the pick holders make it even better.
5.0,great when I dress in drag ;)
5.0,"Easy to use, they fit great and the plastic seems durable. I haven’t gotten a chance to actually take them to the slopes yet but mounting them on the board went smoothly as it could."
5.0,Finally found screw on earrings small enough for my baby and she hasnt ripped them out!!! We've been through countless pairs. The gem is still a little big compared to a 3mm ball but I am pleased that they actually stay in and they didn't cost me hundreds!
5.0,"It is posable and easy to attach, would recommend using silicone to attach behind human ears"
5.0,"Runs on the small side. But comfortable and great looking, love it!"
5.0,"I needed a small ""purse"" to take to the store with me or a short outing. I am the lady that usually has the kitchen sink in her purse so going to a very small one is a culture shock for me. This little PU ( polyurethane-coated) Leather ""purse"" is perfect for my transition. It will hold my Galaxy cell phone in one pocket along with my driver's licence and credit cards and then in the other, it has room enough for a few extras but not big enough for the kitchen sink! Nevertheless, it has room for all I need. The outside back has a zippered pocket for cash bills or change.  The long strap which is detachable is adjustable. I LOVE IT. But I am still not giving up my big purses for longer outings. This purse is really classy looking too which is important to me as I am a designer trendy purse junkie."
5.0,"These pants were beautifully made. Others said they ran small, but they fit as expected."
5.0,Peso ligero.
5.0,"Sometimes with tee shirts, I worry about quality and material being too thin. This shirt is soft and comfortable and not too thin. The fit is a little larger than some shirts but not abnormally so. Great color selection. Highly recommend."
5.0,I have been looking for a while to find this hat. It is very good
5.0,A LOT OF COMPLIMENTS!!!
5.0,No complaints. Would recommend.
5.0,"Love them! Extremely comfortable, great price, and love the color!"
5.0,Best hat I’ve bought in a long time
5.0,"Beautiful set, I bought this for my daughter for her Christmas program and she loves it, has worn it everyday."
5.0,Very cute. Will serve it's purpose next Mardi Gras
5.0,"This was pretty easy to get on my Fitbit, and it looks great! I have a white Fitbit, so it looks really good and is a nice upgrade from the standard Fitbit band for non-workout occasions!"
5.0,It fits true to size. Loved this dress.
5.0,Lovely - thank you!
5.0,wore it to a outdoor wedding. loved it.  made from good fabric
5.0,I got these for a party and they were a hit all the kids loved them especially the fact that they light up.
5.0,"Very warm, not itchy. Worked well in windchills of -10 degrees!"
5.0,was much better than I expected. same quality as all the bralettes at boutiques and for a tiny fraction of the price. wish there were more colors so I could buy a few more! looks great underneath a strappy shirt. decent support.
5.0,This is super cute! It has a very stretchy and comfortable waistband. I like that because I can wear it on my actual waist or lower on my hips if I decide. I’m surprised at how great the quality is. It’s really full and fluffy and not cheap looking.
5.0,Gave this as a Christmas gift and recipient was very happy with quality and size.
5.0,Got then as a Valentine's gift for my boyfriend and myself!! They were perfect! Didn't come in a box though or with stickers. But my boyfriend loved it so much!! He is normally a medium and it was a little tight but I am a small and it fit perfect!!
5.0,"I like the comfy high waist band. It is a true high waist, above navel. (I got a M and my waist measures 29) The ankles are a nice snug fit without being tight. And the legs are just flowy enough to be comfy yet flattering, not baggy.  I don’t always want to wear painted-on leggings for working out, so this is a nice alternative. I will be ordering more colors."
5.0,Super lightweight pants.  Perfect for bumming around in!
5.0,They are so cute. Well made too. I bought them as a baby shower gift so I am not sure of the fit. The doggy on the front is sewn nicely and the pop of color adds to the chram.
5.0,"I attended a Roaring 20’s luncheon at a Country Club, in the North Shore of Illinois.  We were asked to wear something from that era.<br />I wore this lovely headband and was the hit of our 10 person table.  I felt so dressed for the day."
5.0,"Only had them for a short time, but they look great, and so far they're comfortable.I'll update this in a couple of months once I've had a chance to wear them more."
5.0,Great set !!! Really loced everything that came in the box !!!
5.0,This is a beautiful bracelet!  Having a magnet on the clasp makes it so easy to put on.  It has a nice bold presence and I am proud to wear it in honor of not just cats and dogs but all animals.  I have worn it every day since I received it.
5.0,"I love this necklace, it makes any outfit I have worn with it seem sophisticated, it makes statements with the simplest look"
5.0,Absolutely love it ! The packaging was very nice. It even came with a little gift bag and blank card.
5.0,I thought the swimsuit was flattering for my portly figure
5.0,"Excellent product, good communication and fast delivery. Thank you!"
5.0,"It's a nice length, not too long.  My wallet purse falls about 3 inches past my underarm."
5.0,"Some sites sell one set of tapers for $120.  i got both a black set, and the rainbow set.  these are AMAZING. very, very happy with my purchase."
5.0,"Sturdy, stylist and polarized! What’s not to love"
5.0,"This is a very good cost effective base layer for anyone doing any physical activity in cooler temps. Similar to other reviews, it does tend to fit a size smaller than stated."
5.0,This dress was perfect for my engagement photo session and really popped. The size was perfect except the bust area was too small for me so I couldn't close all the buttons. This wasn't a big deal as I wore a tank top underneath. Also the blue is brighter in person but I think the color is better than the pictures.
5.0,My kid really loved this shirt! Good quality and still in great shape after washing over past 2/3 months!
5.0,"very nice, I love the necklace"
5.0,"I really like these sunglasses. They are dark, look great, and the frames feel very solid. I have a hard time deciding between these, And my $150 Oakleys. These are spectacular on very bright days and are comfortable to wear. Best $10 sunglasses I have ever bought."
5.0,Gorgeous earrings . A little heavy but love the color.
5.0,I was very impressed with the quality of these shades for the price. They have nice weight to them and are very stylish indeed. Would recommend.
5.0,So much prettier in person !  You actually get the same pattern that you order I've ordered things before where you end up with a different pattern or a slightly different color variation but in this case I got exactly what I ordered and I'm very happy with the fit and the style and the print !
5.0,best fitting hat ive ever owned
5.0,"Great boot, too bad they dont make them anymore. I think this was Wayne Rooney's favorite cleats."
5.0,"Beautiful necklace at an amazing price, I was very impressed"
5.0,These are fantastic gloves and very durable! I purchased them to pull lily pads out of our large duck pond. They fit great and I was able to feel everything through them unlike other gloves I’ve tried that were too bulky. I purchased the two pack because I didn’t think they would last long for what I planned to use them for but I was wrong. I gave one pair to my mom to use for things because the pair I used still look and function like new after hours of digging through muck and sharp rocks to get to the roots of the lilies. I’ve added a picture to show our pond with all the lilies before I pulled them out and some pictures of how the gloves look and fit with our lily free pond in the background. I’ve already gotten my money’s worth out of these and am extremely satisfied with my purchase!
5.0,"This has become my favorite bracelet, I have tried some others similar to this, I have smaller wrists and they end up being way too big, but this one fits perfectly! And even if it was too small it doesn’t hurt to bend it a bit to adjust. If I’d ever need to, I would definitely buy again!!"
5.0,"Soft. Nothing to grab on clothes, etc. Doesn’t irritate skin. Super easy to keep clean."
5.0,Cute..perfect for what I need it for
5.0,Every southern woman needs a tomato pin cushion so she can channel Grandma while she sews back on a button
5.0,"Best hat for winter,  Fit is perfect and very warm and stylish at the same time!"
5.0,Great quality shirt.  Our son loved it.
5.0,"These are great for kids, slip on and go!  No laces or velcro to mess with.  Good quality--they will be outgrown before they wear out.  This is our 4th pair in this style.  Hold up well in the washer and dryer.  Best of all my daughter thinks the cheetah print makes her run extra fast :-)"
5.0,All round great cap!
5.0,Granddaughter lovd them!
5.0,Bought it for my 16 year old grandson and he loves it!
5.0,"Beyond what I expected this hoodie to be, thicker, and the clear image, my son also loved this gift!"
5.0,If you are unsure about getting these dont hesitate. I've actually ordered these twice over the last couple years (decided to close up a year ago and now I miss them) these are amazing quality. The weight is perfect if your looking for something to help you stretch naturally. I reccomend these to everyone! Left a review because there arent enough reviews for these!
5.0,Very pretty both sides print and soft
5.0,Made a great casual dress for a relaxed outing.
5.0,Top 2 or 3 pairs of pants in my closet!
5.0,These are a mixture of good and bad. The good is that they are cute (adorable) but the bad is that they have plastic posts that you have to be exceedingly careful with HOWEVER for those of you with allergies...these are ideal! They are the ultimate hypoallergenic earring and the seller seems to be very nice.
5.0,Love this dress fits well looks sexy
5.0,"perfect! better than pictures, has not chipped or scratched being in my key chain with the keys."
5.0,Great product for the price high quality
5.0,"Great socks for kids.  I would say they run a tad small, but they are really fun and cute.  My 2 year old daughter loves them.  Have held up very well (for kids socks)."
5.0,"Bought these as a gift & the pictures don’t do the jammies justice! They are so soft & adorable. Great quality & will purchase again, this time for myself!"
5.0,I love this sweater as it is versatile from casual to semi-casual.  I can were with jeans or tights.  It fit as expected.
5.0,The design was as advertised and the colors vibrant.  Socks are comfortable.
5.0,Beautiful pendant for the price.
5.0,I love the lace detail and the breathable material. Easy to dress up with a skirt or pair of black pants. Also perfect to wear with jeans or shorts for causal occasions.
5.0,I love my multi plisse robe.  It is lightweight and gives just the right feel on a spring day.  The colors are nice. It washes and dries and ready to wear.
5.0,"Thought it was going to be bigger, seems to be made well."
5.0,Great fit & good support. I will be buying more!
5.0,"They are lovely; perfect size, perfect sparkle!  I'm very, very happy with them."
5.0,i ordered these for a friend for her birthday because we got our cartilages pierced together and she was stoked to wait for it to heal so she could wear an ear cuff so i figured these would be perfect for her. i ordered them with a stud on top instead of a fake ring and they look amazing! they were made with care and the costumer service was beyond wonderful they were extremely nice and when i needed a post instead of a cuff they immediately responded that it would be no problem i love them and i know my friend will too :) they look like they were made with love and i couldnt be happier thank you sooo much jujubeads :)
5.0,"Just great, I bent the frame a little, and voilà."
5.0,The shirt was exactly as described. Very comfortable and soft material. Fits perfect!
5.0,Looks like real Gold!
5.0,"I live in a community with tennis courts and pool that require a key to enter. I purchased this (quite large, bright red) to put that key on so that grandkids and guests are less prone to mislay or stick the key in their pocket and walk off with it. BTW: I added my address in marker just in case. Lol"
5.0,"Love this dress. I throw it on for just casual anything. It’s flattering, not at all see through and I don’t need a bra. I’m 132 , 5’4 and postpartum 3 mos so it camouflages my baby bump too. I ordered a size small."
5.0,"I love this wallet, the shape, the size, the color, the sturdiness ( i don't think it will ever break since the sides are thick).  It feels so nice in the hand.  Its awesome they give you an extra band win the box in case you lose the first one or you need to double up on the sides.  The main side only holds about 4 cards without protruding over the lip..I use this side for all my money cards.  But then I also use the other side to load up on all my other cards like ID and work card.  I absolutely love it when I go into my office, i just hold up the rear side and my work tag picks it up, and back in my pocket the wallet goes."
5.0,Good fit. Well made. Love the style.
5.0,"Hat fits as shown in photo. Not for tiny ones...my son is in 24m. It is unbelievably cute though! Love the cowl neck - works wonders in place of a scarf. Face opening is small enough that he can't easily pull it down. I have washed it once and hung to dry. Held up just fine. Shipping is not quick, but super cute and priced well!"
5.0,"Have not gave it to her yet, I know she will love it."
5.0,"I love them, they are cute and the perfect size."
5.0,Loved this.  Got tons of compliments.  Nice lightweight material.
5.0,"I was kind of unsure about this dress, however I'm so glad I purchased it.  I love this dress, I am 5'4 and I purchased a large it fits perfectly."
5.0,"It looked just like it did in the picture and it fit perfectly! It has a nice, soft fabric and it's not see through."
5.0,Very comfortable except the top. The back where it was put tiger was rough and scratchy. The bottoms are very bell bottom.
5.0,This is so comfortable and is flattering on.
5.0,Very easy to change out and have made my glasses look like a new pair. Would buy again as this is a cheap and easy fix.
5.0,I got this for my mother for her 30th wedding anniversary.  It's lovely.
5.0,Love it!! Beautiful dress!!
5.0,I like this item but I forget I bought it before now I got two same one omg can I return the item or rerun please I dunno how to return
5.0,"There okay kinda cheap, made in China."
5.0,"Cute, sturdy served its purpose!"
5.0,"It's definitely worth the price, effort into getting it turned on after charged properly (Pay attention to the Directions Please), and worth the Money!<br /><br />Now only if it wasn't so gaudy, you know so huge. But my daughter will have to grow into it. It was a Christmas gift for her, so she better wear it lol.<br /><br />I'll try and update as I go along."
5.0,"Originally thought I needed to return these for a size larger, but then I caught COVID-19 and lost 15 pounds. They feel great, high quality materials, and the sizing was perfect for my post COVID body!"
5.0,A very nice watch! It's simple and very comfortable to wear.
5.0,I got the masks a week before the expected date of delivery which was awesome! Also the masks fit my face perfectly and have adjustable ear straps to tighten it to my face. The best surprise was that there was a rubber ear saver in the package as well! Which i was not expecting but am very great full for! Nothing bad to say about these i feel like the seller is very concerned with their packaging and the customers satisfaction which is nice. Thank you!
5.0,"5’6” 145lbs - I think this creates a really modest and modern look. The material is really light and airy, as well as comfortable. I was concerned with how it’d wash, and aside from wrinkling easily there were no problems. It fits well and it’s overall a great top for warm weather."
5.0,Super soft and extremely comfortable! Great for layering in the winter too
5.0,"The cheap glass doesn't clean easily, but good quality for the price."
5.0,"Supportive & comfy! Exactly what this mama was looking for! Size down if you want extra support! The only downfall is on the white sports bra you can see the pads in it, so I just took the pads out of the white one, no big deal! But you seriously cannot bear the price!!"
5.0,Love these..
5.0,Awesome made mask. Won first place...
5.0,"I received my glasses timely and WOW was I surprised!!!  They came in a soft Amazon Envelope, you know the kind with the bubble stuff inside, and they were not protected by any hard outer layer but they arrived perfect!!  All three pair were in an individual draw string cloth bag and each arm of the glasses had a plastic cover to prevent scratching.  I absolutely loved the heaviness of the glasses, they felt like a pair I had purchased at an eyeglass store.  The quality is exceptional, the colors bold and vibrant and the diamond cut makes my glasses shine like a diamond....and thanks to these glasses, I now look like Penelope Garcia from Criminal Minds.....<br />Another great buy ....thank you Amazon"
5.0,my bf loves it for his bday present :P
5.0,So much fun!  Wire to SMU football games and on the 4th of July!!
5.0,"Tight, but okay. I mean that is exactly what it is supposed to do!"
5.0,Got this for my son and it fit perfect.. loved wearing it. Very comfortable
5.0,The 42 D is perfect. I originally bought 40C but after a few days realized it was a little snug. So I went up a size and now fits perfect! I would say if you do get it go up a size first.
5.0,"Love, love, love this dress! Got this dress for an upcoming trip to Vegas as something light and cool to wear. I had heard mixed feelings about the quality of the brand, but I am absolutely surprised by the make of it! I am 5'4&#34; and 140 lbs, got a med. and it fits perfectly!"
5.0,Beautiful extremely well made<br />See the pics !
5.0,"Is a very nice skirt but ""Is very body fitting"" It fits like a glove, will have to think what to wear to balance the attention from my hips! Will think maybe an oversize shirt will do the trick!  Is a beautiful skirt!"
5.0,"Great top, lots of compliments!"
5.0,"My mom loved it. The pendant is bigger than I expected. I will probably get my mom a nice chain, as it came with a rope (which is fine, just not my preference). Great purchase!"
5.0,Fits my 9 year old son. He loves it.
5.0,"I'm always a bit nervous to buy things online due to not being able to try them on...but these socks are awesome.  I may have to order more, my kids are already stealing them!"
5.0,Actually better quality than I expected. The colors are vibrant. Looks very nice.
5.0,My father is 190 and 82 years old. He loves them.
5.0,just what I needed for Halloween
5.0,"I like it.  Very well make, excellent stitching, silicone rubber material is thick and of good quality.  Pinhole pattern gives it a nice sporty and modern look.  Goes well with my watch. Also very comfortable."
5.0,"I love the hair bow holders, well made. They work perfect for hair bows and looks awesome on the wall. My daughter is going to be so excited to see all her hair bows nicely hanging up."
5.0,They are extremely comfortable without having too much padding.
5.0,"Is what I was expecting. Fits great, confortable and keeps me warm all the time.<br />Where I work it’s a cool environment and definitely this beanie hat scarf is what I was looking for. Great buy!!"
5.0,"These are perfect, son loved them."
5.0,When it’s hot in the summer you need sun glasses. Problem is I always lose mine. Which is why this 2 pack is such a great value. Protects my eyes and I can have a pair in each car while also still looking trendy with almost any outfit.
5.0,"This shirt is absolutely perfect! I will say the color is a little more ""heathered"" than the picture shows, but I still love it. The material is great quality, thicker than I expected. The fit is TTS, but not super fitted. The length will be great for leggings. I am always a bit nervous to order clothes from Amazon, but this top does not disappoint. I ordered a large, and I am about 165 lbs. and 5 ft. 5."
5.0,This is the only hair band I've tried that actually stays in place while running.  I highly recommend these for sports.  The velvet keeps the band in place without tearing out your fine baby hairs like other bands with rubber grip strips do.  These are totally worth it.
5.0,Material was extremely thin and already ripped.
5.0,I have a very small wrist and this band had the perfect thickness. Fits great and is comfortable.
5.0,Clean looking well built slim wallet with captain america logo. What more is there to say? been using it for a few months and it has held up well.
5.0,"Came beautifully packaged, definitely could give this as a gift. I have worn this in the shower and to bed none of them have discolored so far."
5.0,Pog
5.0,"I have these joggers in a few colors and they are so comfy! I love that they have pockets. I prefer the black and darker gray pairs that they have to these lighter gray ones, just because they are less flattering."
5.0,Just like the photo. Great color. Just as ordered.
5.0,Too Cute ! Omg. And it fits so well. adds so much class to a regular out fit. got so much compliments
5.0,I purchased these rings for my husband to replace one he had previously.  We were replacing a more well known brand due to it wearing out and stretching.  The Ikonfitness rings are as well made as the more known brands.  My husband likes the look and feel of the Ikonfitness rings.
5.0,"So simple, nice material. Lays well on a plus size woman. The rouching in the center helps disguise back and front fat.<br />Hangs below the knee, almost mid shin.<br />5'7"" 250lbs"
5.0,My Wife loved the purse I bought for her. Its really really nice and the price great. Got husband points on this one
5.0,Love this bands. Comfortable adjustable and don’t make my wrist sweat.
5.0,"Beautiful gloves, nice visit."
5.0,Perfectly roomy and then some. Small enough not to look like some huge tote. The fabric is completely cleanable. Perfect for a casual bag cross body style or on the shoulder
5.0,This is a great towel. Not thick but dried off quickly. Great for the pool or after a shower. We got our 8yr old a medium... plenty of room to grow but great even now. Purchased the striped one. It looks just as pictured.
5.0,"Exactly what I wanted, my grandson loved it!"
5.0,"I liked the design on the inside of the ""terrarium"" quite well, but I bought a second one and turned the necklaces into earrings. I've received several compliments each time I've worn them."
5.0,china product
5.0,Super nice shirt for the summer. Looks stylish. Can't complain for the price.
5.0,I love my new pumpkin shirt. It fits perfect and is really soft.
5.0,Got these on a lightning deal. I have the green and wine colored ones. They are comfortable and lovely. You can't see through the material. Great for church!
5.0,Soft material.  We ordered brown was worried might look muddy but colors are vivid.
5.0,Only trouble was adjusting the band but followed directions and works fine
5.0,"A gift to my friend , she loves it, wears it a lot ,lives in Florida"
5.0,Love the baggy style of this. I can wear it around the house and I can wear it out. Color was vibrant! I washed in cold water and dried on High heat and it shrunk very little.
5.0,I love it. Very easy to install on my phone and put on my watch strap. Excellent durability and not bulky.
5.0,"My husbands favorite coat, he loves it."
5.0,love this hat. my wife bought it for me for fathers day the fit is a tad small in the beginning but after wearing it for a bit it starts to loosen
5.0,My dad got a kick out of this hat. He liked it.
5.0,Fit perfectly.  Just have to get the pants hemmed
5.0,"These are so cool, I wanted to see a reaction from my family that I got &#34;piercings&#34;  and they believed it. now I want the real ones like this but i'll settle for these a while longer"
5.0,"Loved it, think it runs a tad small, fit a little snug, i normally get a large, and sent it back for an XL, since it is cotton was afraid it would shrink."
5.0,Just the right level of light for ambiance and to see by without ruining your night vision and the outdoor vibe.
5.0,"These leggings are great! They fit well and are completely squat proof! No worry about being see through. My only complaint is not even a big deal, they are a little long for us shorter gals. Would buy again"
5.0,Love them. Great product
5.0,For the price these are great. We tend to choose these when working outdoors because the vision is clear and the bifocal is in the right place.
5.0,My husband has trouble finding hats that fit his big head. This one fits
5.0,"I was looking for an updated look for jean shorts since my only pair were from 2011 (yikes). Then I found these, they fit perfectly and give the loose fit without the diaper look (very important as I like to be able to dress them up or down) the high waste is perfect so I can decide how risky I want my look to be without worry of my belly 🥰"
5.0,"I purchased two of these scarves and immediately washed them upon receiving them. (Machine wash, hang dry). The material is so soft to the touch. I will be getting more in different colors."
5.0,Soo worth it!  Warm and snuggly<br />♡
5.0,"Such a cute top!  Fits true to size (for me anyway).  I'm 5'8, 150lbs, 32DDD and I got a medium."
5.0,"Love this bathing suit, very unique & fit great!"
5.0,These are nice earrings.  They were a gift for someone who loves them.<br /><br />NOTE: These didn't turn his sensitive ears/skin green like many other earrings do.  Big win for me!
5.0,"Great fit, I just wish that all of Selena album shirts, and a few others will come back to the market"
5.0,The earrings are lovely. Well made. The seller was most courteous in dealing with the delivery problem and re-sent the earrings abd they arrived in a short oeriid od time. It was very gracious for them to resend. And I am greatful.
5.0,i love the material and its perfect for workout
5.0,My six month old daughter looks adorable in this hat. The size adjust to a perfect fit with a bungee pull and it has the chin straps. She was very comfortable wearing it and never tried to pull it off. I'm very happy with this purchase.
5.0,Too cute! No complaints whatsoever.
5.0,OKAY... PRETTY BUT LOW KEY COLOR
5.0,Fit well and kept its shape well.
5.0,These are quick and easy to add to my glasses. They’re durable enough to not break when I have been putting them in my pocket (when I go indoors and take them off of my glasses).
5.0,"these came in earlier than I thought they would. bought these for my 6yo daughter. she keeps them on all day. rhey don't pinch her ears, they are a snug fit. I wore them to see how they'd wear with me. and they are comfortable. only downside is I wish they came in some smaller sizes and more colors."
5.0,I use my visor in the shower to help the water to not get in my eyes.  I got eyelash extensions and when they get wet or soaked it loosens the glue so you loose lashes so this is why I got these visors.  So far they are working great.  Since I have a whole bag left (11) I may use when I'm outside this summer.
5.0,Nice shoe strings. Used for face mask.
5.0,What a fun garment! Can dress up or down and it's so breeezy. It fit me as I had expected. I got the 3xl since I'm about a 20/22. The fabric wrinkles super easily though.
5.0,Nephew loved them
5.0,"I purchased the miniature needle driver instrument keychain as part of a Secret Santa gift for a surgical tech. I wasn't able to test if it clicked upon closing like a real one (item was in a plastic bag) but it looked like a real one! Super adorable, well made and the recipient loved it."
5.0,"This is my second robe, previous one I purchased 5 years ago and over many many washes it finally lost that heavenly peachy color. Highly recommend!"
5.0,"I've been wearing it surfing and, like my previous Swatch (which finally gave out after a few years) this one is holding up like a champ. Love it!"
5.0,My boyfriend loves this hat. The fit and color are perfect.
5.0,Pleased with the fit and length; washed in cold water and hung to dry and experienced no shrinkage.
5.0,"I’m reducing my “carbon imprint” so instead of using so many plastic bags, I’m using these to pack my items into.<br />I also wanted something with more flexibility in stuffing my duffle bag with bs packing cubes, which can be limiting."
5.0,I love it. It fits my bracelet perfectly. Nice and heavy.
5.0,Very cute and fit well. Not see through and very well made.
5.0,After over a year having this. Me and my gf still have this!
5.0,Such a cute bag looks just like the  picture . Would buy it . again and it is not to small.
5.0,"Cute jacket, daughter wears it all the time"
5.0,Great bag! Even included a cute tassel keychain in the bag!
5.0,My daughter loved this.  Very high quality and fit great.
5.0,What do I have to say....Absolutely Absolutely AMAZING!!! Very fine detail...Disney did an outstanding job on this. This wallet is flawless!! If u ♡ The Little Mermaid dont hesitate this is a must have!
5.0,Bought this for my Mom who loves scatter pins/brooches. She loves it!
5.0,"They’re really nice, and they’re great when I wear them"
5.0,"I loved this outfit so much. Got asked if it was even vintage. My favorite Halloween costume to date! I ordered a different headband on here because I wanted something a little more extravagant and with some jewels. I didn’t wear the gloves because I wanted to be able to use my phone. I wore an XL and I am 5’2 180lbs. It had one small spot on the supper that kind of bunched up? Not sure if that’s the word I’d use but overall such an amazing dress for the price! Not to mention you get fishnets, jewelry, and cigarette holder as well. ❤️"
5.0,"So cute! Haven't worn it yet, since it's an accessory for Halloween, but if something changes, I'll update!"
5.0,"Great price much nicer than expected, the material is very plush, not recommend for a shower robe though"
5.0,"I love these palazzo pants! After a quick iron they look fantastic. Super light weight and will be perfect for hot summer days. I am 5'4&#34; and 120 lbs. I ordered the 4/6 and they fit perfectly. I can't gain any weight though. If you weigh more than 120, I suggest going up one size. The waist is snug and the cut is designed for an hourglass shape. If your waist is the same diameter as your hips, go up a size for your own comfort. The built-in shorts have no give either. Given the airy design, sizing up won't look bad. They are a bit see through so you would need to wear skin tone undergarments. I bought a white body suit and you can see it through the pants. It's not so obvious that I mind, but I can tell. Other than it taking well over a week to receive, I am very happy with my purchase."
5.0,"I love this bag. We're coming up on a year of almost daily use and it still looks brand new. It holds my mat, mat towel, two hand/face towels, eye pillow, lip balm, essential oil roller ball, two tampons, a mini deodorant, hair ties, car keys, and usually my wallet. Pretty sure I could cram a bit more in too."
5.0,"Fast shipping and the exact length. Quality is good. I found them on Etsy, more variety and way cheaper."
5.0,"Great quality, fits like a glove and the price is right. Couldn't ask for more!<br />I bought it for my 4yr old, she is average height and weight. This would have never fit my other daughter who was a tall 4yr old. So if your child is tall for a 4yr old this probably would be too small."
5.0,"Very pretty, only needs a very small amount of ashes."
5.0,"I ordered these and the first pair provided partial glare reduction. After communicating with supplier, they sent a second pair. I don't know why but this pair woorks just fine. The workmanship on the glasses is very good. The packaging is impressive. I would recomend."
5.0,Thank you SO much!!😊I was able to save a lot of my boots that I almost threw away.
5.0,"These are a fantastic, stylish pair of very affordable sunglasses! Very happy with the purchase!"
5.0,I loved it for my halloween costume!
5.0,"Love that saying and always tell my granddaughter that, she is 18 and hopefully will always remember this."
5.0,"My son loves this hoodie, it is one of his favorite go to hoodies. Product arrived as described. Nice quality and vibrant colors. Has held up well and retained it's color wash after wash."
5.0,"arrived on 3/25/15, pretty, musical, i liked it very much!"
5.0,Cute and great priced necklace
5.0,for the price this is definitely a nice dress up sort of option. ;)
5.0,"Exactly as described & easy fit, love it"
5.0,These are my husbands favorite!
5.0,I use it for a winter hat and it works quite well.
5.0,"It is just what I wanted, something to go through airport hassles with free hands, but not stiff and bulky like the nylon versions. Big enough to put passport and tickets,or hotel keys, some money, mirror and lipstick. You can slip it under a jacket or vest, or wear it on the shoulder. And it is elegant enough to go through an evening dinner also! Nice soft leather!A good buy!"
5.0,super cute leather braclet
5.0,"It is so cute, and I love turtles."
5.0,Talk about getting something in the mail.....only to find out it is MUCH BETTER than you had ever imagined. Pictures do not do these shoes justice. They are fantastic. Can't walk into a Pro Shop without someone having something to say about your shoes. Oh - added bonus - they are extremely comfortable and have great traction for wet days. Win win.
5.0,"I looove this shirt, I wear it at least once a week and the material holds up really well! Looks nice and fits comfortable"
5.0,"cute boots, especially for the price. fits as expected and not painful after walking so long in it."
5.0,It works exactly as expected and is very durable.
5.0,Super cute- go on easily then Velcro down- I got the larger size (xl) so they grow with my daughter (now 2).
5.0,This product is good.. My son loves his ring.. Fits comfortably and fits perfectly too..
5.0,I love it! It's a great looking handbag! I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the materials and how roomy it is.This handbag can hold a lot of stuff :-)  The extra long length strap that's included is a definite plus as well.
5.0,I received my order when expected and it was really good quality! Love wearing my pretty braclet! Would definitely recommend!
5.0,Super cute very well made leather. The mouth of the pig opens and has a snap closure.
5.0,Very cute lapel pins.  Love them!
5.0,Very cheap on the price and great for the nostalgia!
5.0,i love them they’re so cute
5.0,I could never get my daughter to wear goggles because they are always too tight and pull her hair. She immediately put these on and kept them on! No more hair pulling.
5.0,Product has nice design
5.0,"The Orchid Row Women's Fashion Wranger Hat with Velvet Band looks great on my wife’s head. The blue and black color is very sophisticated and will match with most coats. The hat uses quality, durable material. It is suitable to wear out for most occasions."
5.0,My favorite thing about these glasses is how dark the lenses are. I live in Florida with a lot of bright sunshine so these are helpful.  They look a little bit big for my face and they fit my fiance better.  They are snug though and do not slip down. Great quality sunglasses! I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.
5.0,"Love it. I was a little hesitant to buy it at first because it's coming from China, but it was as good a hat as the expensive equivalent I was eyeing at Urban Outfitters."
5.0,Loveeeeee this bag and I loveee Kate spade
5.0,"Just what wife needed, small but being 14K they kept her sensitive ears from getting infected. since she has 3 holes in each ear, they suited her perfectly!"
5.0,❤️❤️❤️ just Perfect
5.0,"This is a perfect go-to dress! I bought for a work conference. Just enough stretch and give to keep it cute but professional. I'm 5'6, a sporty 150, 34B and I went for the large. I have a longer torso and it fits right at my knee. It wrinkles, so a nice fold or hanger is a must. Washed it and hung it dry and it's still looking good."
5.0,"My blaze used to hurt my wrist bone on the outside because it had a tendency to shift there. These fixed that problem. They grip even without them being too tight. Its also pretty good quality silicone so I expect to get a lot of wear out of them and frankly compared to others I've owned these have already out shined the competitors who broke after a few months of constant wear. I wear two different ones all the time including caring for the horses and riding. Even tightening them down for a work out hasn't shown any wear in five months. I do switch out of them at night for a leather bulky style one. It helps get the sweat trap to move away for a bit. Its not a bad trap, but any watch worn 23/7 will get some trappage. Also, there is no metal frame with these because the band itself encloses the blaze. These means no switching out frames, but more importantly it holds the HR bump up, so its flat. You still get great HR monitoring, tested it at a doctor's office, but you don't get the wrist pain from the bump digging in."
5.0,"These two clowns who reviewed the watch think they know about watches. I own 3 Rolex watches that all run over $30k each and I can tell you this watch is by far the best quality I've found at this price point ever!! Do your self a favor don't listen to these idiot's and buy it. This is one of the coolest watches you will own, get lots of compliments and it will last for years without any issues. The quality is excellent!!"
5.0,"These board shorts were exactly what I was looking for. They offer ease of movement with adequate coverage in a up-to-date fashionable way. I really like the material. It has a slight glossy finish to it much like any swimwear does. It is stretchy yet fitted enough to stay in place. I am thicker at the bottom so I was concerned that the legs would be too tight. These shorts were perfect - they have a V slit on the side of each leg and this allows room for those of us who have larger thighs. I did not feel constricted - in fact the leg opening was still ample enough that I felt that the shorts hung nicely, covered some trouble spots, and allowed me to be active. There is a built in bikini that is very comfortable and provides adequate coverage. Even if the leg of the short creeps up during beach or swim activities, the bikini provides needed coverage so you do not worry about showing anything. The waist has a drawstring to tighten the shorts up if needed. For me, the shorts were about an inch below my belly button. I personally would have preferred them slightly higher to cover a little more of my belly but with a tankini top, I am just fine. I foresee these shorts being my summer go-to swimwear for any outdoor, water related activity. I would recommend these board shorts to anybody who doesn't want a regular swimsuit bottom or the swim skirt. This is a perfect option and they are very comfortable. I received these shorts at a discounted rate in exchange for honest review."
5.0,This shirt arrived quickly. It is very comfortable. It washed very well. I have received many compliments while wearing it. I highly recommend this shirt and seller.
5.0,"This dress fit true to size, and was perfect for Halloween.  We had enough space to put a long-sleeve t-shirt underneath for warmth before trick or treating."
5.0,The pullover is just as advertised. Soft inside and great fit. I ordered an XL for a roomy fit for layering.
5.0,They are perfect for dress up or casual wear
5.0,Fabric is so soft.  Fits as expected.  Would order again!
5.0,"Just received this and wore it to an arts festival. Very cute, comfortable, perfect for my needs. About to order another. Pockets are a plus too."
5.0,The chain could be a little thicker. But overall a cute necklace.
5.0,Nice it's like a t shirt dress
5.0,fits exactly how  I expected  them to fit. They are a little see through
5.0,These are beautiful and I do not turn green at all on my skin like costume can do. They pull my earlobe a tiny bit but over all are pretty light. They are on the more yellow side too
5.0,Absolutely stunning! I bought them for a birthday gift for my daughter!
5.0,"I love this dress!  It is comfortable, casual, breaths well and HAS POCKETS!  I wore it to a wedding and received a number of compliments!<br />I am 5'2&#34;, curvy and it fit just lovely on my body.  Size L."
5.0,"I ordered these a little bit hesitant based on a couple reviews. But I have to say,  I LOVE THESE SLIPPERS.<br />I needed something with an actual sole but not hard.  These are perfect! Cozy inside, firm enough sole that I can step out  on the porch in cold weather."
5.0,"My daughter was Amelia Earhart for a school event, this jacket was the perfect touch.  She wears it all the time.  I’m very pleased with the quality, especially for the price."
5.0,Fit my daughter perfectly and was so cute
5.0,"This is a cardigan vest that looks and feels great on me. It is perfect for everyday use or casual occasions. The fabric is soft, comfortable, breathable and it has a stretch to it. It has short sleeves, opens at the front,  has no buttons and it long like a tunic. The cardigan is true to size, I am size 16-18 and the XL size was a perfect fit. I had no problems machine washing and drying it and I have noticed no shrinkage or pilling."
5.0,"Very good quality it appears with good aesthetic appeal, excellent gym/workout top"
5.0,Bought these for my beloved small footed mother-in-law. She uses custom orthotics and these are wide enough to accommodate them
5.0,These are so cute.. and excellent price
5.0,Great but did not realize how long the feathers were - at least 5&#34;.  Maybe I did not read this in the description so could be my error.
5.0,I love this dress! It's so beautiful and fit perfectly. I want to buy more in different colors. I get so many compliments when I wear it.
5.0,"She can fit the pair I kept, and she loves them."
5.0,I ordered a size higher like the seller recommended and it fit my daughter perfectly!
5.0,"I've been buying Vivobarefoot for my kids since they have wore shoes! My 4 year old absolutely loves them!! They fit great, are comfy, easy to put on/take off and no. 1 importance they do not hinder your child's natural toe splay. Her feet were born perfect and we're going to keep it that way! Not cramming her toes into a pointy unnatural shape shoe ever! Also, this UK based company is amazing giving back to 3rd world countries and use renewable, sustainable materials for their shoes. It's a company you can feel awesome for supporting!!! Vivobarefoot for life!!!"
5.0,Love!!  It’s PING!  What more can you say?!! Quality is there.
5.0,They look like the picture. Perfect for wanting matching ones
5.0,Absolutely love the colors.  I wear it quite often.
5.0,"it is a pretty watch,good price."
5.0,"Excellent Travel bag! Gone for 3 weeks. It contained everything I needed, held up perfectly, is lightweight, and fits easily into plane overhead because it is just a little thinner than my previous carry-on. Never had to put the backpack straps to the test but the rolling equipment was great! Can't say enough good things about it! And my husband bought the more expensive Rick Steve's backpack and was not nearly as satisfied!"
5.0,Received nightgown earlier then expected.  This is my second nightgown so I'm familiar with the nice fit and feel of the material.  Its not tight but has a nice flowy feel to it.  Very happy with purchase
5.0,This is super cute!!!! It’s a bit bulky but I love it!
5.0,"Very cute, soft and fit my 11 year old great. Pants were a little big but he is very tiny."
5.0,Got these for equestrian stock pins. Work great and look traditional.
5.0,Great price for the glasses and everyone loved them
5.0,I like the quality of this item
5.0,This is the second time I have purchased these good product for the price!
5.0,"I impulse bought this little ditty and couldn't be happier.  On those days when I feel the need to add more holiday cheer to my life, I slip into my elf costume and let the magic unfold.  The costume is well made and includes all the basic requirements that an elfish person requires.  The size chart was accurate, everything fit me as expected.<br /><br />My only complaint are the shoes.  They are just sort of shoe covers that go over bare feet or other shoes.  That isn't a problem for me since I own several pair of authentic elf shoes, but something to watch out for."
5.0,"Nice wallet. Not too big, not too small. It looks more worn out in the photos, but it shows up in very good shape without being too stiff. The price is right too."
5.0,I really like these socks.  They seem well made and are comfortable.  I would buy them again.
5.0,"bigger than expected, but looks pretty nice"
5.0,The white looks super sexy and fits wonderfully! 38-25-40 and it wasn't too loose or too snug.
5.0,The writing is clear and the t-shirt is of good quality. Very cute and can't wait to put it on our granddaughter.
5.0,Clips on to my hat for surfing and kiting.  Works great.
5.0,These are so adorable. I bought them for my family so that we could always carry our loved one with us.
5.0,"Beautiful design, good materiel, stunning look."
5.0,"I love suit~fun, classy and makes you look very retro~"
5.0,Really nice and soft and wide enough to tie in front and cover your shoulders.  I personally don't like something too thick and this is perfect.  It's not thin but it's not thick either so it will be nice for travel since it won't take up too much space. Well worth the price.
5.0,So cute for the price. I wore for dress up night out with a black pantsuit and they looked very expensive.
5.0,Really cute little shoes but run smaller than other brands in the same size. My granddaughter loves them.
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for! Fit great and great quality! Love it!
5.0,Fun for a Gag Gift
5.0,amazing lenses! they fit perfectly on my juliets. They come individually packaged and they send the lenses with a special tool to change them when ever you feel in the mood to have a new lense color.  An extremely good buy.
5.0,Love this dress! Very comfortable and attractive. I received many compliments
5.0,"I searched high and low for a toddler sized packable down coat that could be worn in the car seat that didn't cost more than $50.  I decided to take a chance with this coat even though there were no reviews, and it is exactly what I was looking for!  I did not have to adjust the car seat straps at all when my son was wearing this, and as a bonus it's cute, has a removable hood, and is packed with real down so it's actually warm.  He's 3 and a little on the small side and the 3T worked great with some room to grow."
5.0,THIS HELPS AVOID SURGERY &#62; WHICH NO ONE SHOULD EVER HAVE (ELECTIVE SURGERY ) GATEWAY INTO AN EARTHLY HELL~!
5.0,"I liked that there’s different types of charms and they’re all super cute! For 30 of them, this is a good price! You get what you pay for!"
5.0,I love that it sparkles on my pinky finger in  a delicate fashion!!
5.0,This keychain is so adorable. I like it that it's not bulky and takes not much space in my jeans' pocket together with 2-3 keys. I love to touch the smooth surface and look at the elaborate pattern on the back of it. The keychain is just perfect!
5.0,I love the Rosary!!!!
5.0,"This shoe is very cute and comfortable. I wear a size 9, but ordered a 10 and the fit is perfect."
5.0,LOVE it has cats on it so its purrfect.
5.0,"This half-zip fits snug like a glove w/o making me feel like I have to constantly adjust. The fleece lining is so warm, hands down the best 1/4-zip for New England winters"
5.0,Nice construction and very roomy.
5.0,Really enhanced my NYE look! Was extremely comfortable & looks just like the picture. I think I’m going to bring turbans back in style?
5.0,The cut of the body of the shirt is slightly fitted and very flattering. Slimming. And the fabric is just yummy!<br />Casual - or not. Comfortable & elegant.<br />You wear this shirt. It doesn’t wear you.
5.0,Thus is the love of my life! My favorite
5.0,"I love dress! Very cute, I am 5’2” and got a medium and it fits great!"
5.0,NICE COLORFUL EARRINGS. GOOD PRICE AND FAST SHIPPING.
5.0,"Super soft nice fabric, it’s very stretchable. It made my bum bum looks really nice, and it’s just cute overall. I will definitely get another set in different color. I feel like it’s great for work out outfit but it’s also good to go out outfit"
5.0,"I bought this as a present, and the recipient was quite pleased with it. He is interested in steam punk, but most steam punk items are too large. This is subtle and interesting up close. It will look good with a variety of suits and keep the tie in place."
5.0,"I'm 5'8 130lbs with 36"" hips and a 27"" waist.<br />The small fit great, not even too short.<br />They are crazy soft and will now be replacing all of my sweat pants, I don't even care about the ridiculously tiny lady pocket in the back these are so nice."
5.0,Very cute and they are amazing to wear all dressed up!
5.0,"Beautiful, affordable watch"
5.0,"I love this shoe. I have already ordered another pair. Coming Wednesday. I love them they’re light, comfortable, I’ve worn them out to the grocery store, it’s better than a pair of socks. I highly recommend this particular product if you like something warm and comfortable, with fuzzy on the inside this is the little shoe for you."
5.0,"As a lady, it has been very difficult for me to find a pair of cowboy boots that fit my size 10 1/2, somewhat wide feet. I had to break down and buy a pair of men's boots after no luck in stores or online ordering boots in a women's size 11. I ordered these boots because they were a brand that is known for well-made boots, but they had the most ""feminine-looking detail"" with the stitched lasso pattern. I LOVE these boots. The leather is soft, the support is perfect, I do not struggle to get my feet in or out of them, and there is room in the design for me to embroider some flowers for a more personalized look."
5.0,I like it very much! Its perfect on my body.<br />I recommended!
5.0,"These necklaces are so adorable. My husband and I are both super nerds at heart. So naturally, all of our children got started on the Harry Potter movies when they were toddlers. I got these necklaces for my two oldest daughters and they absolutely love them. The chains are the perfect length for both adults and children. On me, the glasses hang about an inch and a half below my throat. On my girls, they hang about 3 inches below the throat. I love that the glasses are small and dainty. Not gaudy at all. The craftsmanship on these necklaces is also wonderful. They definitely had an attention to detail to include the pieces on the side of the frames where the ear pieces would attach instead of simply leaving the edges smooth. The chain also seem to be fairly sturdy. Like all other necklaces, I wouldn't recommend tugging on it but it doesn't seem like it will fall apart on its own.<br />*I received this product for free or at a discount. All reviews are my opinion and in no way due to the fact that the product was received at a discount to me.*"
5.0,Keep the feet warm
5.0,Super cute! Got it for our cheer coach and had all the girls sign it
5.0,So cute! I bought 7 of these and me and my friends loved them! Its great!
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:c208e5eeb93240f8b7ff3e2a0ca6e9ff]] Absolutely love these blue light glasses! So cute & comfortable! I love to use them for work, reading, scrolling through my phone, watching television, anything! Love the color & so comfy on my face! Definitely 5/5 stars!"
5.0,"Very nice watch, lots of compliments on how it looks. I will be shopping more with this brand. I give it 10 stars instead of 5"
5.0,I thought it was material. It appears to be more vinyl. I guess I should have read the description better. This is ok for me I will use it for my art projects instead of the kitchen. In the kitchen I would like something more absorbant.
5.0,Absolutely the Very Best Customer Service and Value! Strong Recommendation...
5.0,"I was NOT paid to write this review, I purchased these after searching and digging through a lot of other reviews to find some no-show socks that would work for me. And, to be fair, I have a pretty significant anxiety disorder, so making a decision on anything I am going to have to live with is pretty huge for me!! LOL!<br /><br />I have a large, wide foot..size 10. I was looking for something that would keep my toes warm but not shoes under my one pair of Brown Danskos when I wore them. (It's a very particular outfit). These fit the bill perfectly! I find them so comfy and warm, that I wear them all them time, even just around them house. Maybe it is just because I have a larger foot, but I am not sure why other folks are experiencing problems with them not staying on. I do wash them in a mesh laundry bag and air dry them they way I dry my stockings, but that just seemed to be common sense to me....if you have anything with the rubber &#34;grippy strips&#34;, you don't want to damage it by putting it in the dryer.<br /><br />These socks are comfy, cuddly, super pretty, and make my toes incredibly happy, and I really recommend them. And I am not one that writes reviews usually."
5.0,a lot larger in &#34;real&#34; Time...
5.0,Fits my 5 & 6 year perfect
5.0,The fit and texture is very high quality.  Considering picking up a very more for Fall.
5.0,"Looks good on my wife, she is happy with it"
5.0,"bought this for daughter for christmas and looked (and bought) a couple others before settling on this one. I wanted one just like the one I bought back in the early 90s and it was harder than I thought. This is like a light fabric, more than a knit scarf, which is exactly what I wanted: light enough to wear as a scarf but it does double duty as a travel blanket or a throw in a cold movie theater. highly recommend."
5.0,Very well made and thicker than most ties I own.  Nice length and design pattern.  I often get compliments for it.<br />Dry clean only.  I would recommend.
5.0,"I’m 5’3” and this gown is 6” above my ankles. Perfect. Soft and well made. Highly recommend. I did not want to order the longer gown, because I knew I would have to hem it, this one I do not have to hem."
5.0,Good product.Not too constricting.
5.0,great recommended seller
5.0,Good looking and fits as I expected!

5.0,"After a month the straps are loose, they were sewed up to the side and both came off and are all peeled off it's a shame it is a nice bag..."
5.0,Bought for my daughter and she really likes them! :)
5.0,"Love the scarves! Great size, lightweight. Great for fashion addition. I ordered 3 different colors."
5.0,I decided to give my husband new wallet for Xmas and found this. Was even happier when I found it in green since it’s his fave color.<br />He’s able to fit everything in there he needs. Came in a box and it’s RFID.

5.0,I have a smaller backpack and after measuring the inside of my back pack and based off the measurements of this backpack organizer it was a perfect fit for my backpack.<br /><br />I've been using it constantly and it hasn't shown any wear it's a very well built organizer and would recommend it to anyone needing more storage organizing in their backpack.<br /><br />Please make sure you measure the inside dimensions of your backpack before purchase as to not get any issues as I've made that mistake before.<br /><br />You can tell the stitching is very well done and will hold up for a long time of use which is what I was looking for.<br /><br />It's exactly as advertised.
5.0,I am very happy with this product.  I have ordered several pieces from Gem Stone King and was never disappointed.  The stone is a very nice size as well.  It's not small and not so big as to look gaudy. Well made.
5.0,These are really pretty  I have not used them yet but they seem to be good quality charms.
5.0,I am making charms and these were perfect for them!
5.0,Early christmas gift .......the watch was the perfect weight and size. He loves the big face of the watch .
5.0,Oh so cute socks for the money.  My grand-daughter looks adorable in them and loves wearing them. The no-skid feature is also a plus.
5.0,I love my rings. They fit perfectly not to tight and not to loose and I can wear them with anything.
5.0,Absolutely stunning! So sexy & much more glamorous than expected!
5.0,"I absolutely love this jacket. The style is great, it is a cotton blend. So it's not super heavy but great for when you need a light jacket. It is really adorable on. I'm a pretty standard 2XL for tops, and this is pretty close but would not be good for lots of layers underneath.<br /><br />I was seriously very excited when I got it and when I tried it on. I'm overall very happy with this."
5.0,Perfect replacement for the originals as my daughter chewed up the old ones.  Took me about 3 minutes to replace them and they look (and function) like new.
5.0,"soft, flowy, pretty, flattering, washable, doesn't wrinkle,  love it!"
5.0,"I bought this set of metallic silicone rings to wear for my wedding ring because I thought they looked a little more feminine. I like that I can choose from several different colors depending on my mood that day. The rings are extremely comfortable and I almost forget I even have it on! The only color I don’t really care for is the black one, but all the other colors are great, and I can pick and choose from them!"
5.0,wonderful pants my daughter just wants to wear these pants.  perfect size and good quality
5.0,These things suck up the sweat like a sponge. Of course they are not sponges. They have a good fit and don't feel overly constricting.
5.0,"I waited for these and the wait was worth it.  These little pins are beautiful.  They would be great for dressing up a cocktail dress, a jacket, cocktail shoes,  small handbag.  They are very delicate rhinestone pins which you could used one at a time or group them together.  Very clever idea The stones give a lot of sparkle and if you want to dress up your outfit these pins would be the perfect treatment. I am so glad I ordered these and I think you will be also"
5.0,Met my needs
5.0,"perfect fit without trying on first, look sharp"
5.0,Flowy and well-lined! Will be ordering another in navy

5.0,Perfect and the right price
5.0,Love these kitschy earrings. I work in healthcare so they're the perfect dorky accessory!
5.0,Wore this with formal kilt for daughter’s wedding. Very comfortable and high quality leather.
5.0,"The shoes are Real,I""m so in love with the shoe, just as picture"
5.0,Great gift for my sister- she loved it and sizing was pretty spot on
5.0,I like it. Fits good. Looks good.
5.0,"Not too thick. Not too thin. I wish it had pockets, but I can live without them. I had it embroidered for work."
5.0,[[VIDEOID:a52ae164925d4c506d5e07b507c9c7eb]] Okay
5.0,With room! Inside safety pockets are easy to use. There’s plenty belt so wearing it loose is an option.
5.0,"Showed up when they said they would.  Tried it that same night for a couple minutes, Bluetooth connected right away and was enjoying my music.  I am planning to buy more for gifts in the family.  Good stuff!!"
5.0,"This bracelet has beautiful gemstones, a unique design, and looks really pretty on my wrist.  I love wearing it.  Well worth the price!"
5.0,"And really that's all that matters....  Great price, he loves the look and he say's it is comfortable.  Just wishes it was an inch or two longer (if he raises his arms it lifts and shows his torso, but he's also pretty tall)."
5.0,"Love the shirt! I got a size 6 in black.  I'm 5'4&#34;, 130lbs, and a size medium in most shirts.  I got the size 6 based on the size chart however I realized this shirt is bigger than the measurements since it's supposed to fit loose like on the model.<br /><br />The size 6 fits perfectly for me though! The cut out holes were the perfect size for me.  The sleeves were a tiny bit long but not by much since I buttoned it so it fell on my wrists anyway.  The fabric is chiffon so it's not a stretchy fabric at all.  It's also easily wrinkled but a quick steam fixes it.  The shirt falls below my butt so this can work with leggings or jeans.  However, if you are tall it might not be long enough to cover the butt so just keep that in mind."
5.0,This was an award for one of our agents and she loved it.
5.0,"These are by far the most comfortable and easy to put on compression stockings that I have tried. I absolutely love them and if that wasn’t enough the color is beautiful! Definitely give these a try, they are so comfortable that I hate having to take them off LOL."
5.0,"I've been camping and backpacking for 40 years and have at least four tents, all of which have worked well in their way. My wife bought me this for Christmas a few years ago when I said I needed to lighten my backpack load. I then went with her on a two-week trip with her Girl Scout Troop to Ontario, where it rained every day for a week. I've seen some reviews elsewhere that questioned whether it would hold up in heavy rains. Mine did. i was the only one on the trip who stayed dry."
5.0,This is gorgeous... just know this is a small size so unless ur wrists are fairly dainty like mine they may not fit... I measured my wrist before buying it and its true to the length as described... I read some reviews that said it was very small... thats because it is... you have to read carefully... definitely measure your wrist before buying... but its gorgeous... great quality.. and I got so many compliments...
5.0,Very nice piece love it
5.0,"I might have to get my husband another, as he's living in this one. 😂"
5.0,These were for my daughter.  They came quickly and fit her well.
5.0,Very stretchy and lengthy. Perfect for all wrap styles.
5.0,Loved IT!
5.0,These were great for my steampunk costume. Fit well and are durable.
5.0,These crocs are absolutely adorable on my toddler! He loves the light up feature.
5.0,Great price and quality would definitely buy again
5.0,Great for traveling. I’m a convert. It really helps save space when packing and keeps you organized too.
5.0,Great deal and I was actually surprised on how pretty they are!
5.0,Came in on time for school. The lids live them
5.0,"I understand there are a lot of key chains out there. Some are great and some are not. One thing I have noticed is most keychain are quite hard to deal. They tend to long and/or heavy. This keychain comes in between. It's a keychain that have two titanium rings that are easy to access.  It is a universal rings therefore, it is easy adding and removing keys and other things one might carry on the keychain. It is very  high-quality and carry key with ease."
5.0,Love the versatility of these incredibly comfortable shorts!! Love the fit & look!! Would like to order more in different colors!!
5.0,"This jumpsuit is super comfy and look cute . It’s fits really well, I ordered small size and I’m 5,6 feet 130 pounds. I love the color , it matches with everything, sneakers or sandals. Perfect for spring or summer time ."
5.0,Love this dress. Fits perfect and it’s super soft and comfy!
5.0,Love the glasses it's a cool and sleep design with a nice shape and dark tint keeps the sun away nicely
5.0,"I don't know if they provide any therapy, but they are cute for the price."
5.0,This dress is awesome- i am 5’8 weigh 130 and wear size 4- i got the “one size” and it was medium 8/10- and it fit absolutely perfect. It is cheap material and very thin- so just need to be careful bc i feel it could rip easy- but for a costume- it will do- and i love it! It doesn’t look cheap but just very thin- only noticeable to person wearing it.  If they was made of nicer material- it could sell for a lot more!!
5.0,"I have had this bag since 2017, its a great bag! I use it in the months I dont have to wear a winter coat in Michigan.. so 6-8 months a year.  Its functional, fits my glasses, sunglasses, wallet, items for my kids, etc."
5.0,So COMFY!!!!
5.0,"The price really made me consider other options but I am glad I committed. I would NOT order a size smaller. Have your foot measured and order your size....I ordered a half size smaller and they are very very snug and it takes effort to get my foot into the boot. The quality is outstanding! The type of leather is great, naturally water resistant (not water proof) and scuffs rub out easily- just need some neatsfoot oil. Double/triple stitching where appropriate. Definitely a worthy investment. Take care of your boots and they will take care of you. Upgraded to these from Clark's and there is no turning back. I would recommend ordering some cobbler's cement and rubber soles for the bottoms (especially if you live where is rains or snows a lot, or you don't have a cobbler near by who can re-sole them after a year or two).  Oh and the best part, is they are made in 'MURICA!"
5.0,"They will irritate my ears a very small amount after a long days wear. But I'm talking 12 hours or more a day,  or 8 plus hours daily for a couple days in a row. I wear them often for half the day,  most the week without issues"
5.0,Exactly as described. My daughter loves them!
5.0,Love the belt. It’s perfect. I would buy again.
5.0,"Original pretty,with good chain."
5.0,I wondered if these ankle sock would be comfortable.  There are very comfortable and look great no matter the length of pant.
5.0,"These glasses are so stinking cute. I was worried that they'd fit too big on my small face, but they fit perfectly."
5.0,Like all of their other necklaces it showed up beautifully packaged and the stone itself is beautiful. Got it as a gift for my mom so I love that it comes with a little packet that explains what the different stones do.
5.0,This Is One Fly Backpack
5.0,"I am IN LOVE with this dress.  I don't know what it is about the style...maybe it reminds me of my grandmother and all of her fabulous dresses in pictures, but when I saw it, I knew I had to try it and I am so glad I did.  This dress is absolutely adorable.  It is very flattering on a small waistline, and slimming in and of itself.  I love the cap sleeves and the Rockabilly Swing Vintage look.  I also totally love the color.  It's like a vintage dress with a  modern color.  Looks great for work with a navy sweater or scarf.<br /><br />I love the quality of the fabric that it comes in.  It isn't too heavy but heavy enough that it sits right.  I imagine this is probably how most dresses were made during that particular time period, because the quality is great.  With all of our modern conveniences and being able to iron and wash so easily these days, cheaply made outfits often require tons of work (iron, wash and hang to dry), but this dress was great. I always wash my nice dresses and hang them to dry (habit) but it needed a light press and it was ready to go.<br /><br />Can be casual or dressy, you choose!<br /><br />I did receive my Anni Coco Women's 1950's Rocabilly Swing Vintage dress at a discounted price in exchange for an unbiased review of the product!  Totally loved it and would love to see more in this style in different colors!"
5.0,Me encanto el reloj y muy elegante
5.0,"These are awesome. They fit great, look great and people are always impressed to see them fold up so small. I've had them for about a year and haven't broken yet, which is awesome for a ten dollar pair of sunglasses."

5.0,Excelente compra muy elegante ocasional muy bonito
5.0,"Beautiful and comfortable, I wear them almost daily"
5.0,What can i say its tungsten steel

5.0,"Looks great, love the new leather smell"
5.0,"IT'S SO THIN WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU USE ANY OTHER WALLET.<br /><br />Like holycrap. Wallets are stupid, and this one is the only one I'd ever want to use. As long as you're not a ridiculous packrat then you won't even feel it in a pocket."
5.0,I love these pants.  I also have the black ones.  They are casual but could be dressed up.  Great quality!
5.0,good fit good product
5.0,"I just purchased a Kia but, the dealership didn't have key tags and nothing I have worked. So, I bought these and I love them. All of my keys fit and the added plus is it comes with a mini screwdriver. Easy-peasy! :-)"
5.0,"bought this for my 15 year old sister and the band is very big, my hand is 61/2 inches and it fits me perfect, the band can extend for a bigger hand as well."
5.0,"The color is very vibrant and it is very real, it comes with a very exquisite pandora bag, box, and a small satchel to safely store your pandora jewelry. All with the Pandora logo on each item."
5.0,"Great quality, warm inside. Because it's warm inside, though, I would recommend to order a size bigger than your usual. That way it's comfortable :)"
5.0,I liked everything about them
5.0,"Ring is beautiful, I wear it daily with no problem!"
5.0,"Really love this set.<br />Unlike other stainless steel jewelry, I am able to bathe with this jewelry and not have to worry about it turning."
5.0,"I'm 5'6"" and weigh about 195 pounds with athletic build (CrossFit and weightlifting) typically wear large to extra large sizing depending on product. I went extra large for  this leotard and it fits well. Not too tight and not too loose. Gave me full coverage and was comfortable. I'll be purchasing more."
5.0,"fits perfectly, medium was perfect, i only hope they don't shrink when washed. So far they are well worth the price in every way, really nice looking and i really like the gathered leg. it's much safer for older people, llike me, who sometimes trip over the flared flannel PJs. i think the style if perfect for all age groups"
5.0,Bought for my granddaughter who is on dive team.  She wanted it for that
5.0,"It's a little fussy about what it will and won't clamp on to but once it does, it's a honey."
5.0,"Daughter loved it, super soft material, fit as described and washes beautifully."
5.0,Great quality.  Fast delivery.  Lovely color.  Item just as described.
5.0,Bought this for my GTI key. The key ring and attachment is thick so I’m not worried about it bending or breaking. The fabric is also thick and can be used to hang this from a key ring. Definitely recommend!

I purchased these because I recently to work out w/ Denise Austin again:) Also Doing yoga.<br />I Can wear with sports bra and almost sheer top,or even a t-shirt and go shopping.  I like the deep pocket's too.<br />I'd definitely recommend anyone looking for a little Tummy control & comfort.<br />FYI: My husband likes them possibly as much as I do:)))"
5.0,I liked it my granddaughter looked adorable
5.0,"I may look like an idiot wearing this while walking around sightseeing, but reducing my calf pains by 50% is well worth it. Do note it doesn't eliminated pain, or pain after a long walk/hike. What it does is limit the amount of pain. :) Overall I highly recommend this!"
5.0,I love it fits great! The material is a little bit see through but I always wear a cami anyway so not a problem for me.
5.0,"The photo looks just like our Boston, so it was a hit with the wife.  The shirt is a great fit.  if it holds up to several washes then it will be worth the price.  We will see"

5.0,Really cute and great price! Feels nice on my face

5.0,"Great value for the price! Unfortunately not as no show as I wanted for my super low slip ons but they work for everything else. Not too thick or thin, good material, nice stretch. I'm a size 8 for reference."

5.0,Its a good product and fits well
5.0,"I bought 4 of these and I love, love them! They are so comfortable! The fabric is super smooth and stretchy! It has a high elasticity /  spandex so when I run with a phone in the pocket, the phone doesn’t bounce up and down. Highly recommend these!"
5.0,I wore these all winter long.  These are light and comfortable.  Not scratchy and not too tight or conforming.  Comfortable for lazy weekends and even thin enough for Spring and Fall.  Well worth the price.  They did not shrink and do not have any piling after months of wear. Love the pockets.  Love not having button down either.  5 stars!
5.0,"Sent this off as a gift, so I don’t know her reaction but I know it is a beautiful & colorful scarf and can be worn with any color."
5.0,I am a commercial & landscape photographer in Alaska. I love this brand and this beanie. These new styles are awesome in that I like that I can double up the ear warmth if needed.

5.0,"The athletic shirt is as advertised, comfortable and attractive."
5.0,"The colors of these earrings are spectacular. The screw on back being flat makes it feel as if you're not wearing earrings. No more getting stabbed with the post when you lay your head on the pillow.  I'll never go back to the old type of backs. It's a little difficult to get these on if you have long nails,  but it's not a design flaw. I'm just not coordinated"
5.0,"I really like this, it’s really cute and I love the fact that it has pockets because so many things that I cater to women do not include pockets. I am 5’4” and usually weigh between 135 pounds and 140 pounds. It fit me perfectly getting the medium size. The material is very strong, and I like the included the belts that can be adjusted anyway you like. It can easily be dressed down with some sneakers, or you can put on some booties to make it look a little bit more sophisticated. Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase."
5.0,It looked way more expensive than it was. I wore it a lapel brooch to a work party and got so many compliments.

5.0,It is just as described. I love it
5.0,Wow I just love these Christmas-themed glasses! These are so cute and if so many different sayings everyone at work love them when I brought them in for the students to wear on our ugly sweater day. This is a nice set with lots of different choices so there's really something for everyone in there. The only thing is they don't really fit over regular glasses but I wouldn't expect them to however if you do wear glasses to see you might want to consider wearing contacts that day if you plan on using these Christmas dress up glasses.
5.0,The sacks are so comfortable I am on my feet all day and they feel good this is my 1st time buying socks like these love them

5.0,Ordered for my husbands personal glasses collection and he loves it.
5.0,"I LOVE this dress!!! I’m 5’10 and 195 pounds.  I lift Weights and I’m pretty solid.  This flatters all of my curves and fits like a glove.  I actually could have gotten a medium, but I may put it in the drier.  My BF said if I got a medium it would be too tight on booty and boobs. It’s feminine and cute and comfy at same time! Will be buying more!"
5.0,"The Pretty Baby Gifts - Shiny Handmade Tassels Soft Sole Shoes First Step in Learning to Walk Baby Shoes are just adorable. The pink sequins are very sparkly and bright.

5.0,very nice piece.top quality
5.0,love this purse and get compliments every time I go out using it.  My only concern was the zip pocket on outside to be a bit longer so it would hold my cell phone.  People think I spent a lot of money on it (that is because my other purses are expensive and designer names)

5.0,"Great bag, sturdy"
5.0,Exactly like the picture perfect
5.0,Cute shirt.  Nice quality.
5.0,"I use these glasses for kids in our air rifle team. As kids are hard on equipment like glasses, I have to buy several pairs a year. These glasses seem to last them longer than most because they like the look and feel better than the bigger bulkier glasses. The price is great for small clubs like ours and the speed of shipping is excellent. i will definitely be ordering more."

5.0,"Okay I've got two young son's who LOVE the funky sock era we're in but it's so hard to find them their size. Every time I order the smallest in men's they are really size 10 not 6-10. SO I decided to search women's socks since they run smaller. Jackpot! They LOVE these! You can't get much more funky than these here. Socks are soft, seem to be well made, the elastic is good &amp; famous paintings to boot!<br /> Very impressed &amp; thankful for this find!"

5.0,"I'm normally an XS/S underpant- I ordered the large and they fit perfectly. Definitely order the size up, otherwise they're awesome. Full booty coverage and the legs aren't riding up which is a pet peeve of mine when it comes to boy shorts."
5.0,"This necklace is beautiful and it feels good to the touch when I twirl it with my fingers.  Perfect length chain for a pendant like this.  I had hinted for this by allowing my boyfriend to see my Amazon Wish List.  I was very happy to get it, and I'm so happy with the quality.  The stones sparkle, and frankly, because they are so small, it would be conceivable to my friends these may be &#34;real&#34; diamonds.  I love this necklace!  Thanks, Honey :)"
5.0,My Granddaughter loved the pjs!
5.0,I love the fact this has pockets. This is a lot thicker than expected so be careful with wearing long sleeves with it. Plus it came with some stylish sunglasses.

5.0,Great looking key chain. Really stands out.
5.0,"I purchased these after seeing a friend in a pair. I couldn’t believe the quality for the price! I’ve paid $100 for a pair of joggers that didn’t feel or look this good! I love them!!<br /><br />These are more of an athletic material, as opposed to your regular sweatpants. I’m 5’7” and bought a medium. They fit just as they should, coming right above my ankle. I also love that they are high-waisted! Highly recommend!!"
5.0,Fits good really getting good use out of it
5.0,"Love love this! I’m a 2X and this fit perfect. As I’m only 5 ft and 235 lbs I have a really hard time finding a sweat top that fits. Sleeves only have to be rolled up once. Length is right at hip. If you have really long arms it might be a problem. But for us short plus girls, PERFECT!!"
5.0,Love them.  Nice and warm and cushy!
5.0,This is really cute and slimming. I am 5'5&#34; and 135lbs and the medium fits perfect. Nice stretchy material.

5.0,"This anchor necklace is absolutely gorgeous. It is very well made, a high quality product! I am very satisfied. Highly recommend."
5.0,I love this nose ring! I have two nose piercings and wanted a better hoop than what I usually wear. The diamonds have not fallen out and it has not tarnished or came out. It’s actually harder to try and take it out. It really is a cute ring and I say order one!
5.0,"This shirt is very forgiving especially after having a baby. It looks great on me and is of great quality and materials. I don't have any complaints. I first bought the black color and because I loved it so much, I got it in four other colors. It looks great with tights and boots with a complimentary scarf. This shirt hides my stomach until I loose the baby weight and just looks fantastic because, although you really can't see it in the picture, the wrist area is fitted and the neckline in a perfect V with just a hint of cleavage (which I don't mind). Very happy with this shirt and this brand. Have been looking at others in this brand as well."
5.0,Bought these for my boyfriend and he has quite the thick ears but he actually has extra wearable area which is great and they look amazing and feel amazing ☺️
5.0,The order same super quick and they are better that expected.
5.0,"Fits perfectly on my ear. Very cute and feminine touch. I’ve had both ears pierced in the cartilage, and they always ended up sore and infected, so matter how clean I kept them. I can now have the trendy look minus the pain."

5.0,My daughter loved these. Had no issues with purchase and they fit her great. Would buy from this seller again.
5.0,These are really cool shades. They are actually pretty durable for the price and don't look like 7 dollar glasses. They to do a good job at blocking the UV rays and you look cool in the process.  I am going to purchase several pairs in different tints.
5.0,goodnite
5.0,Absolutely loved this shirt. It's perfect for the recipient! The shirt quality is good!
5.0,Fit well. Warm. Works with touchscreen.

5.0,Esta bien diseñado solo un poco pesado para la cadenita que bien
5.0,If you want something squat proof buy a dark color but these are amazing regardless just not for leg days.

5.0,Really cute!!!! Great quality 👌
5.0,They are perfect for vintage style hair dos.
5.0,"If you don't have many keys this is just amazing. So easy to remove and add keys quickly, and much stronger and more durable than you would expect it to be. It is quite a bit smaller than the photo on here looks, but its just so darn easy compared to a standard key ring."
5.0,I am the grandmother of an autistic 8 year old girl. For whatever reason she was constantly breaking her glasses. I can not even say how much her parents spent on glasses over a two year period. It was quite expensive keeping this child in glasses. I saw these while trying to find unbreakable glasses. Took a chance and order a pair for my sweet girl. She has had them for six months and try as she may she can not break them ! And they are cute as can be. She even wears the band that keeps the glasses from slipping down her nose ! Without a fuss ! We are more than thrilled with this purchase.
5.0,I am positive that my Grand daughter will LOVE this necklace and will probably wear it every day!
5.0,Very stretchy and attractively cut dress that is snug in the right places and loose where I need it to be loose. I was pleasantly surprised by how well this dress fits and how flattering it is!

5.0,So very nice !!!!
5.0,Love it!! the gift was meant for a new momma. Best service. Thank you for everything!
5.0,"I normally wear a small and got the medium, fit is perfect. Check out product description for neck size before u order.  These faux shirts are perfect to make your outfit classy, and it’s easy to hand wash and a quick iron to crisp the shirt collar ( no need to iron front back and sleeves! )  . Another fab point is for travel, you can bring these and have 3 “shirts “ 👕 that fit in an envelope!  And you don’t have to tuck another shirt under your jeans or slacks too!  The fabric is heavy cotton and not see thru.  Some of these reviews says it’s too short but this is really a faux shirt collar. Highly recommend."
5.0,It is what I had in mind and I love the look.
5.0,Fit is true to size. My granddaughter loves them!
5.0,"The strap seem to hold the camera safely, it's comfortable to wear and doesn't shift around when walking. It took awhile to figure out proper setup, an instruction sheet would have been helpful. Very nice addition for my equipment"
5.0,Nice and confortable tank.
5.0,Beautiful and worth the money. I am a photographer and I am using it in an upcoming styled bridal shoot. I phone photo of ring paired with another ring from seller.
5.0,"Very cute and light, perfect for those slightly cool weather."
5.0,All my biker friends love this shirt. My Hubbs is all of the above! Great conversation piece!
5.0,"I have several pairs of the Cole Haan Tali flats but this is the first pair of Elsie flats I have bought. They are superbly comfortable, really cute and everyone who sees them asks if they are Ferragamos. I want a pair in every colour."

5.0,Nice detail and quality! The price is good tooooo!

5.0,Nice sweat-shirt
5.0,I am so grateful for all the reviews because I purchased this dress hoping for the best! Based on the reviews the fit was perfect. I am a 38C/D and I am usually a Large. I purchased an XL and I received so many compliments!

5.0,These are great. Them come in a nice little bag and you can use the bag to clean them!
5.0,NIce quality and cool theme. Just a little snug.
5.0,"I was skeptical when I bought it, because of the price, and most of my friends use the fancy $50+ ones.<br />I used it last time I went snowboarding and I cannot make a single complaint. It fits very well and comfortably (does not get too tight to the point it hurts and you want to get a relief every time you have the chance).<br />It also filtered out the sun pretty well and allowed me to see the track much better."
5.0,Completed my costume perfectly! and good quality for its price.
5.0,". First, I will start with I love the band fits perfectly and is so comfortable.  I would recommend it to everyone who doesn't like the original plastic band that when you workout gets all gross. This one allows air in to prevent that super gross feeling under the watch.<br />Second, I did have a small product issue (a missing piece to connect the band), but this company was quick to respond and resolve my issue. I loved the quick and very polite customer service, I would definitely recommend them to everyone and will reorder from them."
5.0,I have 4 pairs of these pants! They are incredibly comfortable and wash well.
5.0,Great lighter weight sweatshirt. My second one!
5.0,"SO ADORABLE!!!!! Really flexible and easy to move around in. A bit narrow, held up nicely for the first 2 wearings so far...which is more than many dress shoes on my toddler!"
5.0,My niece loved these slippers. They were comfortable and fit perfectly
5.0,"I am a size 12 and ordered LARGE. Fit PERFECTLY! Great, sturdy fabric. Adorable! I would recommend this dress and will be purchasing more colors/patterns."
5.0,Great retro designed shirt. good job Harley!
5.0,This was the ship my husband was assigned to in the early sixties.  The memories are invaluable to him. When he received the hat he was especially pleased with the accuracy of the ship's outline.
5.0,Great for jotting down and remembering appointments….<br />Along with some gorgeous pictures of my favorite breed of dogs.
5.0,Amazing! Got my Tubbo Hoodie!!
5.0,This took a long time to get to me but surprisingly I really like it . Nice size ... about an inch . Doesn’t look cheap at all
5.0,"I use in home for multiples activities and not have allergies in my hands, good material"
5.0,Purchased this for my father as a christmas gift after he said he loved the one I had on a diver of mine. I also got him a strap tool so he could change it out without scratching anything.
5.0,"This watch is an incredible value for the money. People that are bothered by the fact that this is a Rolex sub homage are just dorks. It is clearly very well made, and it looks beautiful. I cannot speak to the water resistance quite yet. The band is pretty crappy, but $75 for a handsome watch with an automatic Seiko movement is a no brainer."
5.0,"I'm 5'9', 155 lbs and always leary of ordering dresses like this for fear they will be too short. I am very happy with the length of this dress (in medium), it hits a few inches about the knee and I don't feel like a brisk breeze will expose my nether regions. Will the material last? Not too sure, but for the price I will definitely get my money's worth of wear out if this dress! I will mention that the top part fits snugly but not too tight on my 34DD size."
5.0,"Lightweight and comfortable, runs a little smaller"
5.0,A beautiful piece of jewelry. I bought four and all are beautiful. I wear it on a chain and touch it often.
5.0,My husband loves it!  Especially the lining that is baby soft!
5.0,"I am an avid shopper and normally hesitate to order something online without seeing/touching or recognizing a familiar brand. However, due to COVID-19, time and availability I decided to take a chance on a few things.  After receiving the items, I am pleased to say this was by FAR the best purchase! The color and sizing were spot on. I honestly wasn’t expecting to have gotten such an amazing, high quality item for the price I paid! I will be ordering more items from this brand!"
5.0,Cute! Ready for this pandemic 😟😷
5.0,Comfortable and warm. They wash well.
5.0,Great quality with clear bright stones!
5.0,"The pink CZs sparkle nicely.<br /><br />The flowers were so pretty.<br />These earrings were lovely. They were pretty. They were dainty, but not too small. They are pretty versatile and will work for a great deal of settings and people. I think they would be good for anyone from a child to an adult.<br /><br />I thought these were unique. They came packaged nicely. The quality seemed good.<br /><br />They were very comfortable to wear. They were flattering on. They felt secure on my ears. I thought they were a reasonable value. I would recommend them.<br /><br />It is nice that they are real sterling silver."
5.0,Gave this to my son in law & grandson!! They loved them
5.0,The dress fit just like the photo had advertised. It didnt need to leggings under it although I wore them because the weather is so cold but I got lots of compliments on the dress. So glad I made the purchase.
5.0,It is super cute!!
5.0,Fits perfectly. The quality is good.  Hugs all the right curves. Simple but sexy dress. You can pair it with high heels or sneakers
5.0,These are great for people on their feet all day! Super warm for the winter months as well.<br />I wear them to work when it’s cold and my feet and legs feel amazing! I feel like I have more pep to my step with these wonderful socks! So glad I bought two pairs!
5.0,Great for guys who's weight up & down
5.0,My step daughter loves this jacket. She said it's warm and she likes the pattern.
5.0,Material is soft and keeps me warm.
5.0,"Soft touch,  as I wear overnight , it is not feel pressure  on my head. I recommend  it."
5.0,"Absolutely adorable! We love it! We bought all of these Harry Potter chokers. Some were given as gifts and loved by those people too. From our experience, these fit from ages 8 to adult."
5.0,"Made in USA, quality workmanship!  My grandson loves these because they are just like his daddy's."
5.0,This is fantastic!  I got it as a gift and love it!  I wear it everyday.
5.0,"These are soft, well made, and extremely versatile. My daighter wears these on a boat she works on all day and they are amazing-- protect from wind and also can use so many ways!!!"
5.0,"Just what I was looking for, nice, light, and flowy, but most importantly it looked great on my postpartum body and was super easy to nurse in. I got lots of compliment at the wedding."
5.0,Great fit. Got compliments.
5.0,I love it! Nice quality and way cute!
5.0,"I was genuinely concerned that this would not fit well or look too cheap but I was wrong. This jacket looks great on, no steaming needed at all. And the color I got, red looks great and is very versatile. I looked at the size chart and decided to go one size up since I'm a bustier girl, so if you want a perfect fit and you're over a size 12 definitely go up one size. Since it is summer right now wearing a jacket doesnt make sense but if you are in A/C conditioned place or outside at night it is perfect."
5.0,Awesome beanie!
5.0,"I love the soft material, I bought this item twice more after trying them out! Highly recommend. They stay put. I wash them in a net bag to avoid lace rips. I don't feel the lace, thankfully. I'm curvy so super happy these stay in place and are not binding. Love!"
5.0,They are the grillz that killz.
5.0,Love love love this piece!!!
5.0,"I had found this bra at a discount store and liked it so much that I searched for it on-line.  It's the best racer back bra I've ever had. My only disappointment is that it was not available in Vanilla, but I will keep on looking for when that color is available."
5.0,"LOVE IT! I'm 5'10&#34; 180 lbs with an awful &#34;apple&#34; shape. It's nearly impossible for me to find a dress I feel comfortable in. THIS IS IT! FINALLY!  Nice quality stretch material and for whatever reason, the cut is perfect on me! YAY!"
5.0,Fit was comfortable and the color and style pattern was versatile for many occasions.
5.0,"The material is very soft and fits perfectly. I wore this with jeans and can be worn as a casual outfit, not just an athletic outfit."
5.0,"Moonstone pair.  Wow good quality stones, to me.  Due to stones being natural, one is more clear and protrudes out less than it's partner.  However, both have the moonstone quality of the flashes of luminescence.  Stamped 925 on back and silver is shiny.  Packaged with care.  I recommend and will order again from this company.<br />,"
5.0,"good value, and makes packing and organizing your bag a lot easier!"
5.0,This is perfect and for fall..Quality is good
5.0,Good Quality for the price!!!
5.0,How can I not love this beautiful handbag?!<br />I LOVE Brahmin to start with and these beautiful colors are gorgeous in person. I did have to order the wallet through Brahmin.
5.0,"For fake earrings these are pretty great! They are smaller than you think they are but really I like how delicate they are. They are very sparkly and they look real to me, they also stay on securely and for 5ish bucks I don't think you can beat this deal. I'm debating buying a second pair."
5.0,This outfit is so cute. We’re in December now and I still use it.
5.0,She wore it to help Grandma bake cookies-  little 18mo. old.  So cute and laundered well. ♥️

5.0,These bow ties are precious!
5.0,Beautiful pink pearls
5.0,lovely little bracelet. casual and easy to wear.
5.0,Brought this dress for my 12 yr old daughter she’s 5”6 and is a 38DD  brought the dress in XL .. great fit worth the money
5.0,Fits as advertised. Comfortable. Durable enough for a teething baby too.
5.0,"A little on the large side, but good quality and comfortable."
5.0,"Well-made belt with a nice finish. Plan to order another  one in a different color. It appears to be all leather, with none of the weird manmade products that can be found in a lot of belts that fall apart fairly quickly."
5.0,Great summertime dress! Fit as expected and the snap is a little odd but I don't need it
5.0,"Sizing is accurate and so are picture! Quality is great, and can’t be cost."

5.0,look good on the little lady boobies
5.0,Flashy! Earned me several compliments
5.0,It was surprisingly a great fit!
5.0,"Very fun kids' piece of clothing. My daughter loved the color, which was very durable for use; the paint did not faint immediately, compared to a similar product from Jcrew. I would say it is definitely a good quality pants for the kids to stand out anywhere they go."
5.0,Great necklace! Fast shipping! Absolutely love it!
5.0,It's so cute I love it!
5.0,The quality is good. This is a cute dress just as the picture shows. It looks great on me! Every penny worth! I would love to recommend it.
5.0,"The colours are vibrant and they look, feel and fit nicely."
5.0,lots of compliments.....
5.0,"Beautiful. They are somewhat fragile, but just the right size."
5.0,"I fell in love with a bunch of Allegra K's loose fitting tops that go almost anywhere.  The fall and winter ones are soft, warm and comfy, and the summer and spring ones are also loose fitting, made of chiffon, and very airy and cool.  I certainly have enjoyed my choices, and as you can see kept going back for more.  If this is your style, go for it!  I am over 70 and they work for me, so the look is not necessarily only for the young ....... and they are very affordable."
5.0,This was for a community service
5.0,Very happy with the product and price!!!
5.0,What a great Christmas gift.  I have one I love so gave it to someone who really liked it.
5.0,"I ordered this on a whim when also replacing my 20 year old Henri LLoyd offshore jacket. I usually use either Marmot or Arcteryx fleece jackets as mid layers, but thought for the money i would see how good this is. I was very impressed by it, it is an excellent dinghy, and sailing jacket for average cold pacific days. It sheds splash water well and has a lot of sensible features for out on the water, the hood is particularly  nice, and it sits out of the way when not in use, and zips off easily when wearing under a storm jacket.<br /><br />The fit is on the slimmer side than i would have expected from Henri Lloyd, but it is cut in such a way that it fits really well under one of their offshore jackets. I have no complaints at all.<br /><br />For prospective buyers, the fit of this mid layer, is similar the the one Arcteryx uses with its mid layer fleece or down jackets."
5.0,Bought these for my husband. He loved them so much that we bought a second pair!
5.0,Have this basic loose fitting t shirt in many colors.  washes nice and fits as expected.  The colors are as shown and the fabric is soft.
5.0,"This dress exceeded my expectations! It's very comfortable and flattering.  It was perfect to wear to a recent summer wedding.  I got the purple, and the color is beautiful.  I feel like it fits true to size.  I'm normally a medium (8/10), and the medium was the perfect fit.  For anyone looking for measurements, I'm about 5'4"" and 143 pounds.  As some others have said, the zipper isn't great quality, but for the price, this is a good buy!"
5.0,was exately what we were looking for.
5.0,"Cute, roomy, very comfortable. The sleeves are just the length I like and the gown is a great length, not too long and not too short."
5.0,"Great size, and I love Edward Gorey's art. The canvas is nice and thick too. Excellent library bag!"
5.0,I absolutely LOVE this suit! I'm 5'10 and about 185 lbs and the size 48 fits perfectly! I was so glad that the pads were removable! I might order another one!
5.0,The dress is very well made and fits very well and is slimming. I bought my size xl and fits as though it was custom made. It’s not tight around the stomach which is a plus. The size chart doesn’t seem to be right as it says xl is US size 10. I usually wear size 14-16 and xl fits perfectly. The material seems shiny in the picture but in person it’s not. But the material doesn’t seem expensive. The material is not transparent and will not need a slip. I liked the dress so much I bought the other colors before the price went up.
5.0,A gift that was well received.
5.0,It's a great hat I even managed to wear it on tv the other day I have pictures. Great price.
5.0,"I got the black, and it’s a very nice looking, well made cap.  I have a fairly large head for a woman, and it fit me just fine, using the strap in the bag to make smaller, which was very easy to do, and the strap in hidden in the hum of the cap, so it’s not sticking out.  I really like it, the extra nice mask included which I also love.  I am really unsure of what I am supposed to do with the button kit that came with it, the cap doesn’t need them. anyway, love the cap!"
5.0,"The perfect bag! This was the third 3L bag I had tried for my backpack and the first to not leak.<br />It is easy to fill and locks shut. You can actually fill it up to 3 liters (actually even a little over) without any difficulty due to the top fill/closure (unlike ones where you fill it in the front).<br />The snap off connector is not right at the base of the bladder as you find with Camelbak and some other brands.<br />The standard tube comes with insulation.<br />The only problem I had was trying to figure out how to open the bite valve. Without my glasses on, I couldn't see the little arrow showing where you had to unlock it.<br />I had no leaking in a very full/stuffed backpacking pack -- even when I put the pack down flat (the last one gave me wet straps when I did this). No leaking from the valve at any time. I just used it for a 2 day trip and plan on getting one for my daughter now."
5.0,"They arrived fast, look sharp and fit well. Look forward to enjoying these while boating."
5.0,Great quality sox's. Thank You
5.0,Gift for grandson and he loves it

5.0,cozy and warm. Love them
5.0,"Love the way it looks, I get lots of compliments on it!!"
5.0,This was perfect for our 4tb of July party! It was light way and fit my daughter perfect!
5.0,"This looks much more expensive than what its selling for. Its an absolutely beautiful piece and very delicate. The chain is lighter than what I would prefer and my hair gets twined up into it, but its so beautiful and the price is right...  This would be a perfect shower gift or favor."
5.0,"I wasn't sure about ordering this suit but because of mostly good reviews I figured what did I have to lose with free returns,right.? So glad I did! I thought for the price that it would maybe be made with  a poor quality fabric,but it seems to be fine. I haven't swam in it yet so I don't know what it will do in the water but the fit is great for me. I am 5'6 @135lbs and have curvy hips. I bought the large based on the size chart~ which comes marked 2x. Don't let that make you shy away from it..I have never bought a 2x in U.S. sizes but this is from china. For the price and the fit I am happy with this purchase and expecting it will be fine in the pool!"
5.0,"This is just as fun to wear as it looks in YouTube videos. Kids love it and its tons of fun. Its very flimsy but hey, it's not from Tom Ford so relax. If it lasts longer than a few days I will be happy with my purchase :)"
5.0,Love the color and the style!!!!!! A ton of compliments..

5.0,"My daughter loves it, the lining is lovely too.  I should have paid closer attentions to the proportions listed, it is a little bigger than what I think of as a clutch (lengthwise) but it was for my daughter and she had plenty of room for her phone and lipstick, so loved it. It's also very pretty."
5.0,Can’t believe I’ve lived & traveled  so long without these! Mad packing so much easier. I even bought them for my mom as well!
5.0,Absolutely stunning my husband did a double take perfect fit I was amazed I wear a size 12 I'm 5/6&#34; and I was afraid of the size large not fitting and it fits perfect and I am very satisfied 💯 thank you 😊
5.0,They fit just right. Super comfy and really soft! I want them in all colors
5.0,"Absolutely love these pants. So comfortable, yet very professional looking for work."

5.0,My son loved this.  It’s still intact and not broken a month after playing with it.
5.0,When you first pit them on they feel snug but then the memory foam conforms to your foot. It's wonderful. Love these sooooo much
5.0,"Gorgeous ring! It looked dainty and classic, but the ring size was too large. I had to return."

5.0,"Perfect size, and colors."
5.0,"Great for putting your hair back to do a facemask, but not really recommended for working out. May work as a general hairband to go out, but I would be afraid of it slipping off.<br /><br />Works with the 9 variety of head sizes in my group."
5.0,Cute swim top. Love the pattern.
5.0,Hair was so life-like!!  My daughter had many compliments on it.
5.0,"Wonderful It's soft, it's big, too big but it's OK.<br />Only suggestion be some sort of button above the zipper so that the hood stays together at the neck when you unzip it while wearing it."
5.0,"This came quicker than expected. I ordered an XL due to a 20 pound weight gain after surgery. It's a bit big now and I'm a size 12 currently. If I do lose, it will be no problem taking it in. The sleeves are black spider lace, not white or silver as I thought they looked all in the picture. I'm going to add some spider hose, heels and a black spider fascinator and I'm ready! Will definitely buy from this seller again."
5.0,"One slight drawback is that it is a bit too big for my wife’s thin wrists, meaning a lot of unused material to trim or fold in."
5.0,good quality good service good price.....very satisfied
5.0,Barton makes the BEST NATO watch straps I've owned. It's the only band I will purchase in the future!
5.0,Looks and feels great fits very well and is super comfy over all good buy
5.0,Love them!  They are comfortable and cute.  Kept me going on my feet all day without swelling up like I usually do.
5.0,"Great price, great product. You get what pay for!! It shaped my body from postpartum. And it has an elastic band that makes the stomach part sweat."
5.0,"They were better than expected for the price!! Such a cute unicorn, super soft inside and hard bottom, perfect for when we have to run out somewhere real quick!!!"
5.0,Shockingly impressed with the quality. It has some weight to it and a liner so it’s decently warm. So soft! I am curious to see how the Sherpa type texture lasts but love this and always love pockets!
5.0,I love the tassel earrings.  The colors are beautiful.
5.0,My son tried these on and loves them
5.0,This purse is just what I was looking for. Size is perfect for me. It is just as pictured.

5.0,I brought these mesh shoes for my husband for our Florida trip to wear at the water park.  He didn't complain and said they were comfortable.
5.0,Cute and perfect size
5.0,nice product and fits well! for the price is worth it
5.0,"Made me smile when I saw it online and laugh out loud when I opened it up.  Positively precious.  It looks like my cat, and it is in her private bathroom.  Quality is better than I expected.  It was not just made in China, it actually came from China so shipping longer than usual.  The only con for me was that it was folded so tight that I can't get the creases out.  Tried washing in warm water with washcloths and hand towels and removing before spin cycle.  Supposedly the weight of the water would pull out the wrinkles. It didn't.  Even tried spray wrinkle remover. Directions specifically said not to put in dryer.  Should only give it four stars because of this but it is so cute I just have to leave it five!"
5.0,"Beautiful cover up.  Soft material, easy to launder. Good price"
5.0,"Listed as a man's cross...but this is the one I've been searching for. Modern, but not too much. For silver lovers, but has that perfect touch of gold. To me, its the size of a usual woman's pendant, so don't worry that it will overwhelm. Even the chain is perfect - not at all heavy but not the usual dainty chains that women's necklaces often have. I love it!"
5.0,This looks great but not for 2019 corolla hatchback.  I guess I wasn't paying attention when I originally ordered . Looks good. Just the key ring part is on the wrong side. I just cut one out and keep this on on my spare key.
5.0,This is a great accessory for any suit
5.0,I received my purse and it's small/medium size I think it's a great size. It's exactly what I expected when I saw the reviews on it and the pictures I love it. Now I can't wait till I go look for some more purses to buy.
5.0,"Ladies, this is beautiful! Please buy!"
5.0,it is great watch it feels like i had a product from the alians<br />the only thing i discovered is that oakley had a newer ver. of this watch with another ID with the same look<br />i looked alot i found out that there is a tinny diffrence between both versions<br />but if i knew that before i buy i would go for the newer ver. of course<br />but sadly i bought the old ver. by the price of ther newest<br />but any way no big diffrence
5.0,Love these sock. Made very well. Arrived as stated.
5.0,"I love this shirt. The way it is cut makes me look like I have a waist! Very flattering. It's one of those shirts that when you wear it people ask, &#34;Have you lost weight?&#34;. Looking to buy in another color. The fabric holds its shape and doesn't wrinkle easily. I usually get two wears out of it before I wash it."
5.0,"Good product, right size and right price."
5.0,Very soft and comfortable.  I love modal cotton pajamas.
5.0,These skirts are a staple to my wardrobe. Comfort and easy to wear.
5.0,as expected ++++
5.0,"This is an amazing piece of jewelry.  I bought it as a cosplay prop for my D&D cleric, but I would wear it every day!  You won't be disappointed."
5.0,these are great low compression socks and I love the design!
5.0,I love this product.  It is so beautiful and creative.  It is large and the colors are lovely and the chain is antique looking and attractive.  This is so much more beautiful than many necklaces/medals that cost 10 times as much.
5.0,"Soooo pretty, I turn them into my wine glass charm"
5.0,"My son has autism and has toe-walked his entire life (he is now an adult). This means he wears out socks and shoes much sooner than is average. The other name brand socks would have holes after 2 months. These socks are thick, soft and durable. They are breathable and don't make his feet sweat. He started to wear holes in them after 6 months plus. That's a win for me as mom."
5.0,"Cool ear cuff that fits well. However, the two free items are not really useful; I didn't even understand what they were until I check the seller's product description. They are suppose to be clip on's but they don't even open for you to clip them on. In short, the cuff is awesome but the free items aren't."
5.0,I like this bag very much. I dislike nothing about it.
5.0,The fit  is good true to size I am 5”4 and 120 lbs I ordered a medium with plenty of xtra room I don’t like things right.
5.0,We purchased these for my son's Ninja Warrior birthday party favors.
5.0,Not for women of any height or weight. Okay for petite size 5 ft 6” small framed woman.
5.0,"I have Flintstone feet (7.5 4E) and it's difficult to find shoes and boots that fit well.  I ordered these in size 8 and my little toe is not cramped at all.  They are a little bit long, but I'm used to that in my boots/shoes."
5.0,These pins are wonderful. I use them for my sweaters that don't have buttons.
5.0,I can't wait for warm weather to wear this dress. My husband loves it and told me to order another in another color. Great fit awesome dress!!!!!
5.0,"Love them! Great cust service, the sunglasses are amazing!"
5.0,"So, make sure you order this as the description states. I was originally going to order a large but I am so glad I didn't and it also isn't as short as what the picture depicts. I am 5' 3 1/2&#34; and it comes right above my knee. My boyfriend teased that once it went over my butt (I have a butt!) that it may be too short but this fabric is very forgiving and it still looks very nice."
5.0,Bottoms are long enough!
5.0,My husband loved these sunglasses!
5.0,These are so beautiful. I love them.
5.0,"I need a bigger size due to the bust area, this fits perfect, it's short but  so am I 4'11"""
5.0,Love the way it looks and fit.  got many compliments
5.0,"I really like the clip (carabiner) style keychains, and the zinc alloy is a perfect material for this, and reminds me of titanium. The extra features, like the bottle opener, and mini knife, to cut a seatbelt in an emergency, are great touches. The best thing that I see is the security. I have had many detachable keychains, but they sometimes separate by accident. I usually find my car key off the chain, but in my pocket. Obviously, this defeats the whole purpose. This carabiner loop seems to close tightly, and that is really the best feature, besides its awesome looks. It is easy to put on a belt loop, and easy to remove. Highly recommended!"
5.0,"Shoes were a hit for my 5 year old niece. I ordered a size 12, which is what shes just getting into, and I'd say they fit true to size because they were just slightly big. They did run wide, though. They have the perfect amount of sparkle and fancy to them! She had no problem pretending she was a princess at her birthday:)"
5.0,"As I said, these are great boots for the money! They feel tight for the first few hours after start wearing them, but break in after just one good day of wearing. Heavy duty zip and Velcro fastener to keep them secure. Work great as station boots."
5.0,Every time I wear this I get compliments.  So glad I ordered.
5.0,"I wore this to a wedding! Very cute dress! I’m 5’3, 135, medium was a perfect size. The material is thick, slight stretchy with beautiful colors and floral print! It was comfortable and form fitting. I was skeptical about ordering it. I’m glad I did!"
5.0,I bought these for my boyfriend because he lost the ones I bought him from LL Bean. He loves them. They keep his hands warm and dry. Great purchase!
5.0,"I like the cross, it just what I needed for to ware to church"
5.0,The material wasnt what i expected. I thought it would be more silky like one other dress i brought like it
5.0,Excellent design and soft material washes well and color stsys
5.0,Great condition.  Daughter loved them.
5.0,Looks like the picture. All crystals were attached. It is quite heavy & slightly large for someone with small wrists.
5.0,realmente excelente
5.0,"Since I have let my hair grow out I was in need of larger earrings.  These fit the bill!  They're beautiful, great quality and they're super light weight despite the size.  Would highly recommend these!"
5.0,Looks like the picture they look good no damage 💯💯💯💯
5.0,"Very nice fit, very comfortable, good purchase for the price."
5.0,These are well made shoes! Nice Leather upper and rubber sold and heal. My grandson loves them! He never wants to take them off!
5.0,"I am in love with the dress!  It's probably the most comfortable thing I've ever worn - I didn't want to take it off!  It fits beautifully, and looks amazing!  Hard to believe it costs so little, as it is pretty good quality.  Highly recommend this!"
5.0,"Nice, sturdy, wide belt.  Fits perfectly, no needed adjustments.  Does what it's asked to do without question.  Would purchase again."
5.0,"I ordered an extra large because of my bust size, usually a large and the xl fit great"
5.0,"I like this item and going to order more , nothing to mark  as ""dislike"", thank you much. Would  you ,please, tell manufacturer produce  more size 16....for 12-13 year girls.Thank you again, Loudmila."
5.0,"Very impressed. Withstood heat and moisture! Stayed on without issue, throughout a night of dancing!"
5.0,My son wears them everyday with his school uniform. Well made and nice looking.
5.0,"I am loving this baseball shirt! I wear it to work (for the month of October). I work in an elementary school and the kids love it too:) ~ this shirt fits nicely. I got a large and I tend to toggle between a medium and a large. I got the large going according to the reviews because at the time of ordering, 64% said it was smaller than average. Honestly, I could have gotten a medium without and issue. This has been washed and dried and there is minimal shrinkage (I wash/dry inside out because of the logo...it's a vinyl-ish material. I think I'll have this shirt for years to come!"
5.0,My son loves this bracelet! It is made very well and it doesn’t loosen like others he has had.
5.0,"I love this belt. I use it every time I workout. Be prepared to sweat like crazy. Even with moderate intensity workouts, my stomach and back sweats!! I had stopped working out but now that I’m back I’m down almost 2 inches because of this belt"
5.0,Got my outfit in 3 days like expected and it fitted perfect will shop with the seller for now on
5.0,"This is my new favorite shirt. I get a lot of compliments on it. It's simple, yet the buttons add nice detail and create some texture and movement that is flattering for pouchy bellies. I like that it is a longer shirt and covers my rear. It's very soft and a thinner material, which I prefer for tees."
5.0,Great sneakers! She loves them!
5.0,My 11 year old daughter loved it
5.0,Nose piece didnt last long but goggles are great and easy to adjust.
5.0,Flattering for curvy shape
5.0,"I love this bag! I actually keep my diaper bag in the car and use this to go on small trips (store, doctors appt etc). It’s perfect for easy access to baby’s things. However is a hassle as now I’m carrying around two bags for baby in the car! But overall I’d say it’s worth it!"
5.0,"Really love this quality tie, it is really quite beautiful for the price.  I am very pleased with my purchase, I ordered white but I am starting to wish i had gotten some more colors.  I really love the sheen of this fabric, and it is soft & smooth.  I would definitely recommend this tie."
5.0,I bought this first in silver for my mother-in-law who is never without a pair of earrings on. Now I've bought this one in black for my 13 year old niece for her birthday. It's a great gift for any age woman who loves earrings. No more digging through the drawer in the jewelry box to find the matching earring. I will have to order one for myself!
5.0,"I love this bag! I got the khaki one and the color is exactly as shown in the picture. It has tons of pockets and storage and a phone pocket big enough for large smartphones. I have the note 5 which is the same size as the iphone 6 plus and my phone fits perfectly in the phone pocket. I also really like that the bottom has a firm base to it so that when you set it down, it keeps its upright shape. Some slouchy bags just sort of collapse on themselves when you set them down, not this one! The rhinestones are sparkly and a very nice touch. Well worth the price!<br /><br />I DID NOT receive this product at a discount. I paid full price so my review is honest :)"
5.0,"Lightweight, comfortable and sexy."
5.0,The wristband was an exact match to my old band that I had for the last 3 years.
5.0,Very good size I’m a little concerned about inner zipper quality
5.0,"My grandsons really wanted these. So, of course I got them, they seem happy. If they're happy, I'm happy."
5.0,"What an awesome scarf! I got the red one, and it's so bright and pretty! These are really thick and well-made, and the PERFECT addition to my outfits on these chilly spring mornings in Nebraska! I love the knitted pattern to my scarf, and have gotten compliments pretty much everywhere I go! My favorite is to pair this with a funky t-shirt, and black leggings, and let the scarf be the pop of color in my outfits!<br />I received this infinity scarf for the purpose of my review, but my opinions are 100% my own, and based on MY personal use. I was not told what to say, only asked to give an honest review based on my own experience with the product."
5.0,Gorgeous. Had to return it and get a smaller size but love it. U can see the blue and the engraving is clear
5.0,"The watch is beautiful and a gift for my mother’s birthday in a few weeks. I hope that she will be thrilled!<br />I’ve owned a Seiko diver for going on 40 years and it’s never, ever failed me nor needed repair. I bought a Pressage a few years ago and it too is beautiful, robust and reliable. I trust Seiko automatic watches and would recommend them to anyone."
5.0,I am very happy. The product is great.
5.0,Fits as expected. Looks better advertised than in person.
5.0,Good quality for the price. Does not look cheap. Compatible size to fit your basics and a little extra.
5.0,"This scarf exceeded my expectations! I was afraid that it would be scratchy because of how cheap it was, but the scarf was surprisingly soft! I've gotten loads of compliments on it too! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a looking for a cute, fashionable, light-weight scarf."
5.0,They were delivered fast.  Seem to be pretty sturdy.  Great quality for the price.
5.0,Very good product.  Met all expectations.
5.0,"They are way to cute on, I wish all my jeans fit like these,  size was right on, love them!!!<br />I got size 28, and fit right on ."
5.0,It is small..but perfect for me. Love it totally! Bellroy makes the best wallets ever and I have several that I have given as gifts and everyone loves them.
5.0,"Great little eyebrow set , and a great price! They actually are really great quality glad I bought it!"
5.0,Great fit. Thank you for your services.
5.0,Great item and I received it on time. I ordered an XL and it runs a little small. Quality seems good.
5.0,I've had my Daith piercings for well over a year and they still had not healed. Even after purchasing new jewelry from a piercing shop I still had some discomfort and bleeding.  I purchased these and am finally seeing a difference. My ears are no longer sore and have almost fully healed.<br />They are a little tricky to get in at first but I'm overall satisfied with this product.
5.0,Great little gift for anyone!
5.0,I collect wallets and this is my absolute favorite
5.0,"This Mickey band fits my Versa Lite watch perfectly.  The leather band doesn’t irritate my skin, as the original silicone Fitbit band did.  I appreciate how cute and stylish it is and can proudly display my love for Disney with my watch."
5.0,I love them..sterling silver at a great price
5.0,"numerous pockets, very useful"
5.0,These are the go-to brand that I get for my son. Love that the length can be adjusted. These are the best.
5.0,"Feels good, great workout clothing"
5.0,"Came quickly, great price. Very antique looking. I’ll be wearing for St. Patrick’s day."
5.0,Great my niece and all her friends thought they are great
5.0,"Wire at the top is comfortable and gives excellent fit so that there is minimal air exchange, and they are also very breathable, while protective. Highly recommend."
5.0,Llegó rápido. Es de.buen material y quedó perfecto. Mi niña tieme 4 años y pesa 33 libras y el CXS le quedó exacto.
5.0,the hematite really does help the arthritis. I have arthritis in my neck and upper spine and the hematite has really helped. And it's such a beautiful necklace it just matches just about anything you wear.
5.0,"I wanted a reddish-brown strap to go with my Timex Weekender and I initially ordered the &#34;rich brown&#34; strap based on the colors shown in the product pictures. The color of the strap I received didn't match my expectation, and I give the seller kudos for quickly responding to my query and resolving my concern.<br /><br />For those in a similar situation, know that the &#34;rich brown&#34; color is more of a chocolate or cocoa brown, and the regular brown is the reddish-brown I was initially looking for. I've included pictures of both for reference. In the picture where the two straps are laying side by side, the watch is on the &#34;rich brown&#34; strap in the right of the photo.<br /><br /> Either way, both straps are decent quality, especially considering the price paid. The band is a little thicker and longer than the strap that came with my Weekender, but I like the more rugged look that the straps bring to the table over the original."
5.0,I love my WW industrial ring. I haven't worn it yet. My piercing is one month new. I can't wait to wear it.
5.0,"I needed a pair of dance shorts to put on over my leotard and these are perfect. They do there job, they are soft, flexible, and comfortable. I would recommend these in a heart beat."
5.0,Cute and comfortable (also very subtle)...I wear them all the time!
5.0,Absolutely Beautiful  a must have
5.0,"Amazon site recommends size small for this item, however you must order true size (In my case Large)."
5.0,Great for the money. Scratches easily if you aren't careful but they are cheap so it's okay. Be gentle and they will be fine
5.0,Great sunglasses. A hit with my 3 yr old as she has ongoing issues with the sun getting in her eyes. She practices her knowledge of open and close as she moves the darkened lenses back and forth. Very very cute!
5.0,"I'm happy with these and they came in exactly as expected but some things to keep in mind: I've never owned slouch socks before, so I have nothing to compare them to. I read the reviews before purchasing and knew they were going to be thinner than advertised, which is actually what sold me on them. I don't like my feet to be too stuffy in my boots and didn't want anything too thick. I'd consider these thin and not medium thickness, personally.<br /><br />The colors are accurately represented and they are comfy. I wear a size 7 (and have pretty wide feet, if that helps anybody) and they fit me perfectly."
5.0,"Purchased this for myself as a birthday gift. I was expecting very little because of the price but was pleasantly surprised by the quality. The beads aren't cheap plastic, they are actual heavy stones. I purchased the adjustable 9 planet. I think where people are disappointed is they see the adjustable picture but purchase the stretchy band one. They are two different options. I am extremely happy this far and will update as to the longevity of the bracelet."
5.0,"Comfortable and fit as expected. Definitely recommend, especially at this price."
5.0,"Outstanding quality and craftsmanship! Especially for the value. Stylish and nice color. The hardware is a gunmetal type color. My wife has some other designer brand purses and the quality of this is close to those brands. This has plenty of storage pockets. It's versatile with two straps, you can carry it the way you like. The leather is soft with a pebbled like texture with good stitching. Excellent!"
5.0,This is no smell product. It comes two with very nice price. One for light cooking one for heavy cooking. And it’s really water resist that you don’t need to worry about to wear nice cloz while cooking.
5.0,Quality pants. Simple enough. Fit as expected as I would normally buy in store.
5.0,Like the touch of color on a basic tortoise shell frame. Makes them look much more modern than others. Too bad they don't come in other glass strengths or I would have bought some for my husband. He needs 1.5.  Great glasses.
5.0,This product works well
5.0,"This just had me fill out a shoe review for this wallet...Do these shoes provide goo arch support?  How should I know?  Last time I checked wallets weren't worn on feet or classified as shoes.<br /><br />Anyway,  this product was as described.  The images are phenomenal and over all it's good quality.  I am extremely satisfied!"
5.0,Beautiful and durable - nice fit and a good buy
5.0,"Love this dress, good job Oxiuly!"
5.0,Super good quality
5.0,The Style Republic Men's 100% Cashmere Extra Long Scarf has a classic look that goes with almost anything.  The scarf has a fine knit and is made from Cashmere for the ultimate comfort.<br /><br />This is my go to scarf when I go out.  It has a European style that makes me feel like I'm in Barcelona.
5.0,Justo como me lo imagine me quedo perfecto me encantó !!😍
5.0,"Great, quality dress for the price. I'm 5'5"", 200lbs, 38B and I bought an XL. The olive color is beautiful and the flower design is vibrant. Flattering, comfortable, great length and POCKETS :)"
5.0,Very pleased with my dress.  It's much nicer quality than you would think for the price.
5.0,My toddler loves to steal my husband’s Oakley sunglasses so the fact that these look similar is awesome! Love the color choices and they fit my 2 1/2 year well with some room to grow.
5.0,"I used this on my vacation in Disney...held my cell phone, charger, wallet, keys....this is a lifesaver while on vacation!"
5.0,Very pretty necklace. Nice dainty size!

5.0,Fit and quality is great.

5.0,This was great in AZ for gifts. Cactus on both sides. Not cheaply made!
5.0,"Great sunglasses, just as described"
5.0,"I love these bead bands they are really absorbent, and wash well."
5.0,"Put together with charm and poise.  My daughter who is seldom stirred by sentiment, was quite surprised."
5.0,"Great price, quality is decent for the cheap price."
5.0,Colors and comfort are great. The size is as described I wish they were a little bit longer. I will go a size up next time I get them for the length.
5.0,This robe is just what the reviews I read about said.  It is very soft and loose fitting.  I was replacing a robe that I have had for years and wanted the same fit.  I am small framed and ordered a size small.  The robe is long but I know with time and washing it will shrink in length.  I have only had it a week but so far am very happy with it .  It is light weight but still very warm.
5.0,Boyfriend even likes to wear it .
5.0,"I love these so much. They are a little bit thicker than the average dish glove so dexterity isn't quite as good, but it's good enough and I like the extra protection. They seem very durable so far, no punctures. I love that it's environmentally friendly I like the latex."
5.0,My son loves it. Strongly recommend!
5.0,Bought it as a gift and the person loves it. Affordable for what the quality is.
5.0,Look good fits nice
5.0,"I always been a fan of these kinds of braclets, when I first ordered it I thought it had a clasp hook , similar to the other bracelets of its kind. But upon receiving this bracelet, I noticed it was one that wrapped around my wrist as many times as I need it to for a proper fit. To attach the bracelet you loop it around the bottom of the anchor.<br /><br />This bracelet holds meaning to me because of the anchor, not that I'm into nautical symbols, but the anchor means that I refuse to sink.<br /><br />I can wear this with almost any outfit as the colors are black and silver. It fits my wrist perfectly. Also because of it being a wrap around braclet, I can also wear it as an ankle bracelet with a pair of sandals or flip flops.<br /><br />It is made of material that is waterproof so I don't mind it getting wet."
5.0,Great mittens. Perfect fit. My 13 year old loves them. No more cold fingers skiing.
5.0,I love them. I wish I knew exactly how to make them. I have several ideas.
5.0,My husband loves to wear his hat. The socks are very warm.
5.0,Well made and warm  Not designed for typing :-)
5.0,"Beautiful! Great color, great feel!"
5.0,"I've been looking for flowy tops like this for a while now, this one is amazing!"
5.0,Perfect size gorgeous color
5.0,"What a surprise!  If you want to feel super sexy, get this nighty!  I absolutely love it.  And although surgery on both knees, large scars and all...I feel great in this sweet number.  You will not be disappointed.  I have to get 2 more in different colors!!!!!!"
5.0,Wicked light and expensive looking
5.0,"Very cute dress, fit great, and it was comfortable. I haven't washed it yet so not sure how it will do with the color in the wash, but I love it so far."
5.0,Yes very much
5.0,"Nice jeans! The fabric is very soft, the stretch is there but not obvious, and the length is perfect for me. Right out of the package they feel slightly loose, but a few washings should snug the fibers up a bit. I'll be looking for more of these in different colors."
5.0,The colors are exactly as pictured and the tie is a very nice quality. Goodbye!
5.0,kl;'[
5.0,Happy so far.
5.0,"So far the case has held up well. The magnets which allow for closing the case are strong enough to the point that I don't worry about separation. The case is a tad bulky, but I could tell before buying it. The bulkiness allows me to store related items in the case as well, although I keep the glasses in a pouch when doing so. I have been planning on another pair of Gunnar glasses in the future and this case would likely hold both pairs."
5.0,"I have issues seeing at night to drive....so bad that I stopped driving at night.<br /><br />I had to have cataract surgery done in both eyes and decided to get a new pair of night vision glasses as the old ones were 10 yrs old...<br /><br />I am loving the vision I get with these new glasses. Honestly I have not driven at night yet due to healing but I have gone for a few nice walks on a busy street at night and they are working well.<br /><br />The cars coming towards me with headlights are dimmed down. The best feature I like is that all lights that are headlights come at me the same color, a nice dim yellow amber color....no more getting killed by the bright halogen style lights....they are a bit brighter yellow amber than the older headlights but they are NO longer the bright kill your eye bright as before....<br /><br />If ever there is a need to replace them I will definitely purchase these again."
5.0,Purchased this for my daughter that runs at night and she loves it!
5.0,"I got these shorts for my daughter to have for dance class, so we were just looking for something super comfortable and easy to move around in that would fit well. This were just the thing we needed. The material is soft with a bit of stretch but doesn't shrink too much in the wash, so they fit just as expected. They feel pretty well-made and durable. The patterns are fun and the colors will match a variety of tops. They were also a great value for the price with 6 pairs in a pack."
5.0,Very cute! Decent size my daughter loves it!
5.0,Excelente compra. Quedan bien ajustadas en los cristales traseros. Como todo se el carro esta corriendo y bajas el cristal se caen no están pegadas en el cristal. Pero los automóviles se ven hermosos.
5.0,"These super short shorts are comfortable for sunbathing and swimming. I ordered size medium and they fit exactly as I expected. I normally wear size 34.<br /><br />It's nice to be able to dry off more quickly after swimming. I'll generally wear these at home around our pool. I'll wear them in public at the beach while sunbathing but I wouldn't walk around in public (in the United States) in them. In public (in the United States) I will wear longer shorts over them as a cover-up and then take off the longer shorts for sunbathing. Outside the US, like in European countries where &#34;board shorts&#34; aren't common and where nearly everyone wears something short and tight, I would wear these and walk around in these on a public beach without hesitation.<br /><br />I've since ordered a couple of similar pairs that appear to be about an inch longer. I haven't received them yet, but if they do turn out to be an inch longer I would feel totally comfortable walking around in public here in the US... in a beach / resort setting of course... not the grocery store!<br /><br />These are about 1/3 the price of similar Speedo shorts and I think these ones look better, with the accent trim, the pocket, and the little notches on each leg (which make for a more interesting tan line, too). Overall these are very cool looking.<br /><br />*** UPDATE 9/7/2016 ***<br /><br />Just took these with me on vacation in Hawaii in late August and really enjoyed wearing them on the beach and to the pool 3 days out of 10. I also had purchased this other pair (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JGLSNMG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which were slightly longer and which quickly became my favorites that I wore to the beach and pool 7 days out of 10. Really, you can't go wrong with either pair. No more board shorts for me."
5.0,"I love these socks, they're so soft and they really do stay in place. Most socks like this fall down throughout the day but not these. I definitely recommend buying these."
5.0,Great for the money and great fit for new mom bod! Flattering yet still young and fun looking!
5.0,I bought this for a gal I really like. She loves the labyrinth and this was a thoughtful gift. Quality is fine! Not amazing but it is something sweet and not bank breaking.
5.0,Beautiful! I wear a size 9 and this fit perfectly<br />Just remember to order two pieces of you want a pair
5.0,At first I could not adjust it but they emailed me and told me how so now I love it and will be getting more =]
5.0,"Buena calidad, llegaron a tiempo. Gracias"
5.0,"I bought a bunch of these in different styles. Love them. Soft, comfortable, flowy, flattering. They do wrinkle, which is a little annoying, but just don't leave them in the bottom of the laundry basket for days like I do."
5.0,I love this swim skirt! It fits perfectly. After reading reviews I had ordered one size up. The material is very good quality and apears to be well made.  It almost has a silky feeling to it. Loved it so much I ordered another in a different color.
5.0,Granddaughter loves it because it was blue her favorite color.
5.0,"Fits perfect, true to size.  Very comfortable with a camisole (just a little scratchy).  Gotten compliments on this and the 2nd one I bought in another color."
5.0,"Super cute, nice material & I got lots of compliments."
5.0,"These are great, and the customer service is amazing.  We just had our second one delivered to our son on his first day of college.  Older brother got one last year.  They are VERY true to the online personalization, very high quality, and a big hit on two different college campuses.  The second one took a little extra time to make, but Mixee Me shipped it priority mail and it made it from Washington state to Long Island in just two days."
5.0,They are absolutely cute. They are gift for a friend and he loved them.
5.0,Everybody wants one in adult size.  Buy it
5.0,I love this wallet. I do wish there was a change purse/pocket with it. Very good quality for the price.
5.0,"This outfit is very nice. The colors are army green, red, and black. Very comfortable and stretchy. I am 5'3 130lbs I got a medium it fits nice. Will order the black/Red one next."
5.0,Love  them nice size cute on got compliments.
5.0,I liked it because the quality was good. It gave the impression that it was professional grade. My nephew loved it.
5.0,Nice quality - soft thick
5.0,"Great fit, extremely light weight. I would wear these everyday if the wife would let me!"
5.0,This dress was well made nice material. I did send this dress back because although it was mostly flattering I had one area where it just didn’t look great on me but it’s a problem with most dresses for me.
5.0,"nice watch, got many compliments while wearing it glass really stands out."
5.0,Great - kids love em
5.0,"I have authentic Rayban, Bolle, Wiley-X brands among others...so just as soon as I held it (light and plastic feels very cheap) I said...&#34;I am not wearing this&#34;. I wanted to throw it away. It took me days before I even tried it on. However, if you can get past that...which I had just as soon as I put it on...you will also give this a 5 out of 5."
5.0,It’s perfect !
5.0,"I bought the wrong size.<br />I fit a L/Xl best and bought Sm/M.<br />Even in the wrong size they are still useable.<br /><br />I keep buying them for work as a mechanic as they are quality. I have bought a pair one time and the brim was crooked and breaking away from the hat, but its a one time issue. Besides that one time, my only complaint is there is no M/L size."
5.0,"It was impeccably made.  Sturdy, easily adjustable and stunning.  Pictures didn't do it justice."
5.0,"Really love this dress.  Pockets are perfect, fit worked for me as a petite girl.  My only disappointment was I would have liked bright coloring on the print, a bit more faded than the picture shows."
5.0,"Okay, so I bought this for my new Apple series 5 44mm watch.  I bought it for 129.99 but apparently it’s dropped in price at 119.99...<br /><br />So this band comes nicely packaged and has all the tools you need to make the adjustment.  I will say adjusting the band was a pain.  It took about 45 minutes of adding and removing for the perfect fit.  I was concerned I’d scratch it but I didn’t.<br /><br />Okay, so once you’re over the steep price and you’ve managed to size up the band. It’s pretty amazing looking band.  My significant other complimented it until I told her the price.  Then she thought I was crazy.<br /><br />Anyhow, would I buy it again? Yes. It looks great."
5.0,We use this for swim practice. A lot thicker and softer than I was expecting. Good product.
5.0,"Finally a pair of earrings that are cute, light weight, I can wear them all day without having my ears breakout. Thank you!"
5.0,Wasn't engraved as it was supposed to be
5.0,"I feel that for my body it's a bit big and im not too tall either but it's super cute, it serves its purpose and it's made well. Thin, and breezy, and just great vibrant summer colors"
5.0,Exactly what i was looking for.  I got the XXL (5'7&#34; 165lbs) and it fits a little lose but It will probably shrink so it is perfect!!! Great Price and shipped faster then expected!!!
5.0,Wore too a wedding and it was so comfortable; I am very pleased with it. The turquoise blue was so pretty.
5.0,"So dainty and pretty in person, will be wearing for my wedding and probably after too. Thank you!"
5.0,"These are great. They fit a little bit but the adjusters on the ears help with that. And if you fold it in just the right way it actually fits better. The quality, is amazing like these are really good quality they're thick but not hindering on your breathing type thick. They are thick in the way that you are comfortable with the other layer and so easy to breathe in."
5.0,Good quality. Vibrant colors. Very happy.
5.0,"I purchased these flip flops for my husband's birthday...he LOVES them.  He says they fit well and are comfortable.  Plus, they look great!  You can't miss the Seahawks logo.  Go 'hawks!"
5.0,Real light I rather have this then a bulky watch
5.0,"I love this tennis bag. The racket pocket early holds my two rackets and the other compartment is roomy, as well. Light weight and we'll made."
5.0,Arrived quickly and very comfy. Appear to be well constructed and hopefully last a long time. Will likely by more at this price point as well.
5.0,Love this shirt fit great I got it in a large and it was perfect would recommend to anyone thinking about buying it
5.0,Item as described. Comfy
5.0,Cheap and excellent for our Blue Devil sports!
5.0,"I know this isn't meant to be a rigged product, but I've found it to be. This wallet has held up well, even after I accidentally washed it. It has also been with me while working outside during some serious rain. It's practically as good now as the day I got it."
5.0,These leggings are super soft! They are great for lounge wear but wouldn’t suggest them for active wear! I would size up in these one size!
5.0,"Just received the luggage yesterday, so I haven’t traveled with it yet. Headed on a trip this weekend, so I’ll update the review after using it.<br /><br />My first impression is... fantastic! The luggage has lots of extra features that I love! Easy to lock and unlock, zippers are ergonomically friendly, storage space is huge, inside storage dividers are handy, front storage compartments are a nice touch. Hard sides seem sturdy."
5.0,Super cute & well made!
5.0,My husband loves these they are sleek and sexy on him. They fit very nice and are easy to clean and put in. This is a amazing product for the price!!!! This is not the fake stuff that turns your skin green. I will be purchasing more!!!!
5.0,i have yet to find a use for this but i am still glad i bought it. i hope other people who like star wars will see it and we will have a connection.
5.0,"for this price, very cute hats"
5.0,"I love the style, the only thing is that it's a bit too long.  Other than that, it's a pretty dress."
5.0,"I appreciate the length. They had saved me from spider/insect bites when I trimmed in the late evenings. Very well made, comfortable and durable. I haven't washed these yet. I would think they will be fine with air drying.<br />Will definitely purchase more for myself and gifts for family members and friends.<br />Highly recommend."
5.0,"These were exactly what I was looking for in a lightweight, comfortable, and cool undershirt to be wore with t-shirts and polos.  They are long enough to tuck, and remain tucked, provide a layer of protection, and are almost unnoticeable.  I will buy more."
5.0,Very comfortable. Gone on two runs and had multiple showers and it’s stayed put! Wish there were more options for colors though.
5.0,Was fine for a costume.
5.0,Excellent product. Buy real glasses for your kids. The fake $2 stuff is not a good experience.
5.0,Very comfortable! The back is longer then the front but that's the design. It is sheer but not see through. I wore a simple black bra with it and it was fine. The blouse is true to size. I like that the sleeve is tapered around the wrist. Hope you enjoy this blouse 👚.
5.0,"Such a cute piece of jewelry any young girl would love to receive! I bought this adorable Enamel Flower Necklace for my niece for her 6th birthday. She opened the box and immediately started gasping with excitement over this super cute necklace!<br />First, this necklace arrives in a very nice box with a ribbon tie right on front! The box lid 'flips' open to reveal the necklace attached to a black velvet covered piece of foam. The logo on the front of the box is metallic pink with white lettering and looks nice.<br />Next, the necklace itself is gold plated, has a lobster claw closure that is easy to use and it seems quite durable. The necklace is fully adjustable and includes an extension chain. The hand-painted enamel flowers are pink, purple and a teal-green and have a crystal in the middle of each. The colors are bright pastels and look very nice. You can also purchase matching earrings and bracelet to complete the set.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review"
5.0,"My cats love these. They are a great size, come well made and made wonderful christmas gifts for other family member's cats."
5.0,My wife loves them. Not too thick for her fingers; and she can actually wear them because she is allergic to most every metal. I bought her a ceramic ring to replace her white gold and rose gold that were causing problems.<br /> But that is her &#34;fancy&#34; ring now. I bought this for her for everyday wear. She gets more complements about her untraditional ring than she would wearing a metal one.
5.0,This is a really pretty ring and stone. Great quality for price.
5.0,Perfect! These are very pretty and elegant looking. They were exactly as pictured and lightweight.
5.0,"Good quality, so cute."
5.0,Wish they were warmer but other then that the look and feel is perfet
5.0,This is so cute and especially for the price!!!! Love it
5.0,I love the dress just not the fit
5.0,"Wow, these are tall and thick, so a lot of people won't like them, but I LOVE them.  I used to have to ring out my headband often, not with these.  I haven't had to ring out at all until I'm done, even after a 2 hour run."
5.0,Awesome beanie that can fit my son! Great for music or youtube videos to keep his head warm and let him enjoy videos without interrupting tv shows or movies. 5 stars! If anything notable happens regarding this product during my time using it I'll update my review for you here. Hope it helps and thank you for taking the time to read it. 😊
5.0,Loved them super comfy!
5.0,Classy & sexy!
5.0,"The colour is far more beautiful in reality than in the pictures, I love it, thank you! A side note: I don't know if it's the ring or if my fingers somehow lost weight but I ordered a size 8, which normally fits my ring fingers, but this ring sits loosely on all my fingers, and sits well on my thumb. I might have to exchange the size if it's worth it to. I haven't read the reviews, but if there are more about the lose fit, then I would suggest people order a size smaller."
5.0,"I ordered the floral strap. When it came in it was a pure white. It didn’t really match my guitar the way I wanted it to, but I soaked it with a tea bag and made it look a little aged and now it’s PERFECT! The strap is also very good quality."
5.0,This puffer jacket is excellent!  It's both fashionable and eminently functional. I have worn this jacket in both mild Autumn weather and below freezing temperatures and it has kept me nice and warm.  It is so light and packable that it is my go to travel jacket. It fits great as well. I am 6 ft 168 lbs and pretty trim and the medium fits perfectly.  I would highly recommend this jacket for anyone. Under Armour products are always great quality and this jacket is second to none.
5.0,Described well.  Fits comfortably and perfect my compression needs of my foot and ankle
5.0,Great product. The way the mask is contoured it gives you a very comfortable fit. Most mask fit flat on your face. The wide band keeps the mask in place evev when you roll around. Also the size doesn't allow light in.
5.0,"I really like these pants, they fit well, are comfortable, and lightweight."
5.0,I liked the way I was able to tighten or loosen the mask. Very comfortable.
5.0,perfect size and appearance.
5.0,"Theses are strong, but very feminine."
5.0,battery didn't last long
5.0,This is my 4th dress. Fits me fabulously and its reflective of my heritage
5.0,Satisfied and tgey are very cute!
5.0,These are incredibly comfortable and great for doing yoga - my new Yoda yoga pants.<br /><br />They're also great for just lounging around the house. I highly recommend them.
5.0,Item exactly what I wanted. Excellent quality.
5.0,"I purchased this watch shortly after buying the Gshock GSteel only because I realized the MT-G has the Radio update feature I would need in case I lose cellular connectivity in Europe. Not only that, this MT-G has a metal bracelet, which I wanted for strength, style and (mainly) comfort. After sizing it, I've used the quick-adjust settings several times on the clasp for wrist expansion. Fantastic!<br /><br />This watch is awesome. It's very similar to the GSteel, but it has that extra quality and features the Gsteel just doesn't. Definitely a step up! Don't get me wrong though - the GSteel is still one of my favorites in my collection and will always get equal wear time.<br />You can NOT go wrong with this watch!!"
5.0,"Fantastic skirt. However, the material is thin enough to see panty lines. Other than that, the fabric is soft and snug to your shape."
5.0,Great socks.  No more blisters.  They run a bit small.  I would definitely air dry them.
5.0,"Excellent quality, very thick 100 percent cotton in vivid colors. I ordered a large and it was a little big so I just reordered 6 colors in medium. I am usually a size small in women’s . I am a 4 in dresses. I know this company runs smaller. If you are a xs get small. A small get medium and if you are a medium get large. I was a fitter for a fashion company for years so I know my measurements. Other than that these tops are really nice and definitely worth the price!"
5.0,Perfect for keeping the sun off my aging skin while I kayak.
5.0,"These have nearly everything I look for in boxer briefs.  They are tagless, comfortable, nice fitting, and look nice.  The only thing that is missing is a fly hole which is a bit annoying, but forgiveable if everything else is good.  And everything else is good.  I have put two through the wash and they look good and given the quality feel of them, I would expect that they will last well."
5.0,Fit true to size. Nice length too
5.0,Love everything about this bag!!!
5.0,They work as intended.  I use these as traditional shirt stays don't work well for me since I'm 6'2.  I simply attach these to my lower thigh and use the shirt stays to attach my shirt to it.  It keeps my shirt tucked in and looking neat without feeling uncomfortable because the shirt stays alone aren't made for someone as tall as myself.
5.0,I liked the way it fit and the cost. Great top
5.0,This hat is so cute and I wear it everywhere! I love it so much!
5.0,"Well made t-shirt.  Not thin like some tee's, the material was great!"
5.0,My son brought these for his classroom treats for Valentine's Day. His teacher encouraged non-food items. The kids tried them on right away and they had a lot of fun seeing the rainbows through their glasses.
5.0,"Classic, a must buy"
5.0,"Great material, long enough to grow with baby. The arms seem like they might become a bit snug if you have a chunky baby but overall a great product."
5.0,Good shirt... we ordered a larger size to be cautious and it was still bigger than expected
5.0,No está nada mal queda muy bien
5.0,"True to size , soft but a little lightweight.  But very nice for California's weather."
5.0,Awesome! My husband loved it
5.0,very cute. quick response from seller. ordered two such a deal
5.0,Super cute and product was as expected
5.0,Looked at a few other airtag wallets and they were too minimal.<br /><br />This one has more pockets and two clear pockets for ids.<br /><br />Not sure how durable it is but it looks great.
5.0,"When I got it I washed it with DownWash, dried it and slept in the hammock that night. Low was 31°f. I use a top quilt and my head gets cold even in a merino balaclava. I usually have a hooded puffy that I wear or drape over me. I slept better than ever with this down hood on my head. I did not wear the puffy and did not end up with my head down in the quilt. It was perfectly warm at 31°f. The interior fabric is super soft and comfy. This is one of the best purchases I have made in a while. I feel that I got a great bang for the buck.<br />Highly recommended."
5.0,"For purchasing purposes … I'm 5' 2"" and about 130 lbs. I ordered a medium. I love the dress! I tried it on when it arrived and haven't taken it off yet! For the price, you can't beat it … I don't care if only lasts a couple summers, I will definitely order more. It fits comfortably and I love it."
5.0,It was very easy to attach band!  Very comfortable  also
5.0,"Works well, like RFID protection, no more need for individual sleeves to protect cards."
5.0,This is just like the picture.
5.0,These were cute and unique earrings!
5.0,I bought the 3XL! Nice and snug without it being overly too tight. Might buy more since they're so comfy. And they have pockets! 😍<br /><br />UPDATE: i bought another pair and they arrived 3 days ago! Yay!!!
5.0,I ordered the 6-12 month size and it fits my chunky 18 lb 6 month old great! Material is soft and very vibrant!
5.0,"I like the weight and quality, it's super cute and my daughter loves them."
5.0,"I've had the slippers for a couple weeks now and they are really exceeding my expectations. I have plantar fasciitis and these shoes give me the same supportive feeling I get from my orthotic inserts prescribed by my doctor. They appear to be well-made and durable and the bottom of the shoe holds up for outdoor use like taking out the trash. I wear them any time I am home and they seem to be holding up quite well. My only complaint is a personal taste that I would prefer a higher back to the slippers instead of a full slip-on but this is apparently the style these days and I am getting used to it. Otherwise, I highly recommend this product!"
5.0,"I love these UCPOY women’s flip flops! I typically have a problem with flip flops because I have osteoarthritis in my big toe joint and most flip flops are so flimsy and lacking support that they hurt with any walking. I even had surgery(cheilectomy)on that joint only three months ago.<br /> I wore these on a one mile walk to the beach and am so surprised that my feet felt good. They are more stiff than others and I believe that is the reason these work for me! The other features that are probably helping is they have a drop ie the heel is raised compared to the toe are and there is built in arch support. According to my podiatrist I have average arches and these are perfect for my feet. The only thing I’m getting used to is the thong part between my toes is fabric and so I can feel it a lot, but I’ll get used to it as it’s not painful.<br />Highly recommend"
5.0,"I had been looking for a wallet that was RFID and still was a decent size.  This wallet is nicely made!  I love all of the pockets for credit cards, etc. and I like that there is a a place for change and two slots for bills.  Perfect wallet for me."
5.0,"I received this charm from the manufacturer at no cost for evaluation during the product's launch, and here are my observations.<br /><br />This heart shaped charm looks as lovely in person as it does on the product page. Set in brightly polished stamped S925 sterling silver, the charm features a ruby red crystal heart centerpiece surrounded by clear diamond-like crystals, a small clear crystal on the top, and an opening through the heart that's wide enough to fit Pandora style bracelets.<br /><br />The charm measures 0.4&quot; x 0.4&quot; and it looks lovely on my Pandora style snake chain bracelet. I especially like the fact that the design is done on both sides of the charm so that it is visible regardless of the way the charm is strung on a bracelet or necklace. Silver does tarnish, but it just takes a little bit of care to keep it looking its best. Avoid swimming with the charm on, store it in an air tight pouch when you aren't planning to wear it for a while, and wipe it off with the included silver cloth to keep it looking bright and shiny."
5.0,My light needs really fit that handbag as PERFECT!! I love it!! Beautiful Handbag!
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful, and I'll never have to polish it."
5.0,These are well worth the money. They are very comfortable and seal very well on both myself and my 2 kids. And they are prety cool looking too
5.0,A friend owns a grill specializing in broasted chicken. We wear our caps to publicize her business
5.0,Very cute shirt!!! Material is soft & very high quality - well made with a great fit.  I LOVE this shirt & may order another one. if you go by the recommended sizing chart it will fit perfect!!
5.0,Works well and looks cool!
5.0,Arrived on time.  Fit well and keeps feet warm
5.0,Love this dress! I ordered three dresses for a wedding and this one was the winner by far! I'm 5'5'' 130lbs small fits perfectly!
5.0,"My husband works hard and needs a nice quality sweatshirt that he's not going to feel bad about getting stained and dirty. These are perfect. Very nice quality and heft, roomy without being too big, good length (for that all-important coverage!) - and a great price."
5.0,Great shoe! Fits my 6month old perfect
5.0,"Love the look, style and colors. It was a gift and he simple loved it."
5.0,Ring still holds its color as the picture
5.0,My wife really liked the looks of her new watch and could not wait to put it on. So far has kept really good time.
5.0,"These are very comfortable and easy to talk with. Great for someone who answers the phone all day. They may not be 100% effective, we're not sure any of them are, but they are the most comfortable I've used for an 8 hour day at my desk."
5.0,"LOVE these sweatshirts - they are SO soft, warm and wash up marvelously - the price is incredible<br />for the excellent quality."
5.0,"super cute over-sized sweater, perfect for comfy casual outfits- great with leggings and sneakers or skinny jeans and boots! the quality of this chunky knit exceeded my expectations. warm and cozy. love the cappuccino brown color. looks MUCH more expensive than it is!!!"
5.0,i absolutely love them. especially the hoop.
5.0,"This earrings are perfect for my Sailor Moon cosplay! They're not too big or too heavy. My only complaint is that there's writing on them, but other than that they're perfect. If you want earrings for a Sailor Moon cosplay or just to have I would definitely recommend these earrings and the seller."
5.0,"Soft, not see through. Love it."
5.0,"These pants are perfect for me. I ordered a size up due to reviews saying they run smaller. The large is perfect for me. I think a medium would have fit as well as the material is stretchy. I'm 5' 8&#34;, wear danskos to work everyday (which add 2 inches to my height) and always have trouble with slacks being long enough. These are the perfect length, fit very well and I love the way they look and feel. I'm ordering 2 more pair in other colors. I could literally leave straight from work and go to a yoga class in these, they are so comfortable but look very professional."
5.0,"I absolutely LOVE it! It looks exactly like the picture and fits great! Seeing as my head is on the smaller side and hats almost never fit, this was perfect for my event."
5.0,Nice fit.  Perfect fabric.
5.0,LOVE this bag! Great price and great quality!!! Everyone loves it too! I've received a lot of compliments...Thank you!
5.0,Best Socks I've Ever Owned.  Love Them!  I am diabetic with some foot pain - these have really helped.
5.0,"I read reviews that this run small. I am 5'11&#34; and wear a size 12-14 generally. I got the XL and it's tight around my waist, but not uncomfortably so. But...this skirt is gorgeous, sits nicely, and is so light and flowy!!"
5.0,These jammies are a gift for Christmas and I am so excited to see the reaction when they are opened!  Cars are his favorite Disney characters.  Thanks for getting this present to us quickly and damage free.
5.0,"Looked thin at first look, but it does its job very well."
5.0,Best I love it
5.0,I went to a costume party and everyone loved the mask.
5.0,"child is about 5' and weighs about 102, age 12 1/2. these size 14 fit great!"
5.0,"Needed a key chain and this is a keychain. Looks as if it should last for a while. If this falls apart within the next few weeks I'll revise the review but as of now it appears to be able to fulfill the need. It arrived quickly and, thus far, I am pleased with the transaction."
5.0,"I've had these for a few years and they remain in excellent condition. They are light, wick sweat away quickly and don't hold odors. Plus they keep my junk in my shorts when I'm doing sit-ups. Very important. No one wants to see that."
5.0,"Fits true to size, very comfortable and really warm!!"
5.0,I love them! They are exactly what I was looking for!
5.0,"Great product. Soft and does not make my forehead itch like other beanies. I didn't realize I bought the slouchy hat, but I like the fit anyway. The picture for the Camel color looks light ​but is actually a darker color."
5.0,Beautiful necklace. My granddaughter will love it.
5.0,My son thought this was one of his best gifts ever!
5.0,Love this bag! Getting nonstop compliments! Perfect size
5.0,Beautiful. Great quality. Can't wait to give to my daughter.
5.0,"I moved to a colder climate 6 years ago and have been trying to find a winter dress that worked for my body all that time. For reference, I am 5'10"" about 170 lbs. I am going to go into a weird amount of detail about my body shape because this dress worked for me when most didn't. If you are lost and have a similar body shape, it can help you decide if you want to risk buying. If you were to judge by the location of my rear end, I would (proportionally) have short legs and a long torso; if you were to judge be the location of my hips, you'd flip those ratios. So, I guess, I am proportionally long hipped with shelf hips (wider at tip than the bottom).<br /><br />The more fitted sweater dresses had the curves in the completely wrong places. The a line dresses either flared weirdly around my hips making me look at least twice as wide or they fit like and empire waist. Nothing fit!<br /><br />On whim I spend far more money than I would normally spend on something like this and decided to try it.<br /><br />I love this dress. The material is a little stretchy so if you order a size up or are just small up top, the waist can fit almost at my waist! The arms are long! And the skirt doesn't do anything strange and falls slightly above my knees. It is exactly what I have been looking for! Also, the teal color is beautiful in my opinion, the dress is warm, and it seems well made.<br /><br />Very happy with my purchase. I've only washed once at this point, but I will update if my opinion changes."
5.0,"I am over the moon with this suit and can not believe it’s 30bucks! I am upside down pear shaped so the hips are a little on the larger size than I would prefer, but I always have this issue. I also am big chested and with the adjustable straps this suit works great for me. I got the red and the color is awesome. Happy me all around!"
5.0,"Nice quaility, nice $!"
5.0,"Very nice, great tunnels at an even better price. Good sizing. Came with it's own velvet bag making it a great gift."
5.0,"Fits good, feels nice and looks good. I'm happy I bought it I can use it in multiple ways."
5.0,"Fit perfectly, very comfortable on the face. Easy to move around in."
5.0,Loved the product but unfortunately it was too large so is being returned.
5.0,"Love these light weight sweater top cover ups. I bought several more. I hate heavy weight clothes and these are perfect for me to layer over a tank with pants or skirts. They are soft and comfy, gave enough warmth and cover up but not heavy and are pretty. A bit large on me but I am petite,  but ok. I tie the bottoms in a knot sometimes. I wash on gentle and cold and then hang dry. They are holding up well so far. I purchased some of the skirts which are nice also."
5.0,Very flattering swimsuit - I ended up buying 2!
5.0,"I love everything about this jacket! It’s heavier than expected, so perfect for someone like me who hates winter and winter coats but unfortunately lives where a coat is required for winter months. The sherpa lining in the body and hood is as soft as expected. I really like the cable knit look and texture on the outside. And the color, rosy pink is perfect! While the sleeves and pockets are not shepa lined, they are at least lined and feel heavier, unlike other jackets I have bought similar to this one, keeping you warmer. I did buy a larger size than I normally purchase because I hate tight coats, so it is big, but that is to be expected and just how I wanted it."
5.0,My Daughter Loves These Boots....
5.0,This is probably one of the most beautiful bands I have purchased! I love it. Beautiful color of blue... it’s huge I say that because I LOVE pink! But this goes well with blue jeans and work clothes! But it you will love it!!! The
5.0,Love the high low
5.0,"Bought these for my boyfriend and he liked them. The only issue is that we think that he may have gotten two right shoes.. he said it isn't that big of a problem, which is why I didn't return them, but it looks like he's got two right feet lol."
5.0,The quality was everything especially for the  price and delivery was very fast!!!
5.0,I bought this for my vacation and I am glad I did! It is very useful!
5.0,Looks cute. Fabric is soft. Washed twice. So far it’s holding up. Good quality
5.0,"Love it! Someone told me I looked like I was wearing fishing lures and someone else said nipple tassels, but I don’t care 😂😂😂 I think they’re adorable!!"
5.0,"I don't normally take time to review my purchases here on Amazon, but this dress deserves all the praise I can give it!<br /><br />I am 5'3, and about 135 pounds. I initially bought this item in gray, size M, for a travel dress. While the medium fit very well, it was slightly too long and a little loose in the shoulders (even after drying on high heat). However, it is still flattering and comfortable, so I think the fit of these dresses is very forgiving, flexible, and entirely up to individual preference.<br /><br />I ordered two more, in black and cranberry, size small. I LOVE them! Since travel was my main purpose for buying them, I wanted lightweight, easily packable items that could be worn multiple times before washing. This dress did all of that and more, as I got compliments from strangers over and over. I was especially impressed with the drape of the fabric and how it moves with the body. It is also very breathable and can look either sporty or dressy, depending on how it is accessorized.<br /><br />I am back here to order another color in time for school to start. This dress will be perfectly appropriate attire in the elementary school library where I work."
5.0,"Love these glasses! I took them to my optometrist and they put in transition lenses, anti glare and anti scratch. So happy with this purchase and I receive a ton of compliments."
5.0,"So comfy, I love it"
5.0,Fits over my prescription glasses very nicely. Helps to clarify night vision without the halos!
5.0,I wanted something I could wear for Halloween as little red riding hood but also could be worn after Halloween as well. This was perfect! Loved it and super cozy!
5.0,Beautiful purse. I get a lot of compliments on it.
5.0,"Super high quality. Lanyard is extra long which really helps me since I am tall. I searched everywhere and I could not find a better deal anywhere plus I recieved it much faster from Amazon than I could have gotten anywhere else. In this puchase combination, I actually got (6) SIX units in different colors ( so I could change with any colors I was wearing for the day easily) for almost the single price of just one unit anywhere else. what a savings and option to have .... I hope this helps your purchase decisions and answers any questions you may have."
5.0,Took awhile to ship but as expected since coming from overseas. Great quality for a low price.
5.0,"What a fabulous dress! This was exactly what I was looking for, light weight, stylish, vintage, adorable! The length is perfect for me, right below the knee. I ordered a large and general wear a size 6.  I cannot wait to wear it to work! My only complaint, which is with 90% of dresses, add pockets. Why don't dresses come with pockets?!?"
5.0,"It's a good size. Everything fits such as moto jacket, workout belt, dip belt and gloves. It's just right with plenty of room to spare. I don't even need to use a locker. I wear it crossbody, and it fits comfortably over my coat. I highly recommend this bag."
5.0,"They never broke, any of the tapers. I got up to a size 2 with them, and still perfect. Spot-on sizing and all and the length of them made it pretty easy to stretch my lobes.<br />I will buy from again!"
5.0,"Mine came in pairs that were pretty well matched. None were chipped, and they all look to be the correct size."
5.0,"I love this shorts set! It is somewhat silky so it feels nice, but not too silky as to be slinky. The flowered shorts are especially flattering. I did order a size larger because I didn't want it to be too tight, and that was a good call, as they fit just like I wanted them to. My hubby loves them! Very cute!"
5.0,"Loved it so much picked up two more for my kids. One thing though, I wish they were bigger."
5.0,"Beautiful, we'll made, and comfortable."
5.0,"All I can say is EXCELLENT.  NOW i can get all of my rollers back going again, instead of having to replace the whole roller-OH! and the 79's fit just as well.  cjp"
5.0,Great style and colors
5.0,Ver nice quality
5.0,"Cool modern slides for warm weather or locker rooms. I had to google, ""how to never break your foot again"" and it said to never walk barefoot again... so here we are. I wear these to the pool and in the locker room at the gym. They are soft but also firm with a wide footbed. They are pretty wide which works for me. The color is very soft pink. Love these slides."
5.0,I get very good comments about this blouse it fits very good .
5.0,"Let’s get this out of the way, this jacket is so cheap I’d hardly call it a blazer. The material is more like a vintage jogging jacket (think Adidas) with lapels and a liner. I think that’s weird and wonderful, and I really love this coat.<br /><br />I’m 6’ @ 155 lbs. wearing a US M (Asia L) and the fit is perfect. The arms are a bit longer than normal, which I really like, since getting my shoulders fitted usually makes my sleeves come up a bit short. If you didn’t already know, the shoulders are the only part of a coat that you NEED to make sure fits. If they don’t, the coat looks sloppy and you look bad. Thankfully they’ve provided shoulder measurements for each coat, so just match that.<br /><br />The wine color isn’t quite as dark as it appears, but it’s still nice. This “blazer” transcends its cheapness by being far less serious than an actual blazer, with its plaid liner and superfluous neck clasp. Its contrasting collar makes it look like it should be popped, which is something you shouldn’t do with actual (e.g. wool) blazers. Somehow, this all makes a blazer sewn from jogging suit fabric acceptable, admirable even. There will, however, be static.<br /><br />The very definition of cheap and cheerful; I’m ordering another."
5.0,Nice piece of work
5.0,Gorgeous and fit perfectly!
5.0,This shirt is very cute. It has a flattering cut and the pattern is beautiful. I love it and I always get compliments when I wear it.
5.0,Very comfortable with fashionable style.
5.0,"This dress fit great. I'm on the summer side 5'7, 140lbs And the medium for great. I probably could have sized down and gotten the small. I ordered the black dress and it's not see through. This is great dress for those hot summer days."
5.0,Fits perfectly very nautical and summery
5.0,Purchased size 5. My daughter wears a size 5 comfortable in a tennis shoe but these boots have a lot more room for growth. They also slip off a lot. Hopefully they will fit better in the fall.
5.0,Cozy. Crim-1-1 forever
5.0,"These are great for the gym !!! they are great material , not see through what so ever and keep their shape:) I ordered (rasin) love the color ! I fluctuate between 115 and 120 lbs , I ordered a small and they fit perfect with stretch room :) a medium I feel would be too big. so if your in this weight range deffinatly get a small!  :)"

5.0,I LOVE THESE. They are insanely comfortable and warm. Great for unpredictable Chicago weather. I was so happy I ordered more in various colors!
5.0,Classy black steel band for your Fitbit blaze.
5.0,"I love this necklace. I ordered it for myself as a special treat after my first son. I didn’t want to spend a crazy amount of money and I really wanted a bar necklace to represent my new adventure as a mommy. This necklace was just the ticket! It looks exactly as it is pictured and has held up well against my son pulling on it. It’s not so short that it feels like it’s choking me, but it sits high enough that it can be seen when I’m wearing most shirts."
5.0,Great piece of jewelry excellent seller A+++++
5.0,My nephew loved these!
5.0,Bought this for a friend. He loves the shirt and its a very cool design.

5.0,GIVING IT AWAY AS A GIFT.
5.0,Sparkly and adorable
5.0,"SO cute, have gotten tons of compliments. They are pretty sturdy, but be careful of the metal between the lenses as it can bend if your not careful."
5.0,Love it! Especially for the price! Good quality and very comfortable
5.0,Was exactly as described & came as promised.
5.0,Perfect mans wallet!
5.0,This is great for the kids school I.D.  This one was even cuter than the one sold in the Stores at Harry Potter World and cheaper too.

5.0,Everyone loves my sweater thanks it is perfect
5.0,"Very, very stylish...imo, as nice as the picture! It definitely runs small...got an X large, can't really button it yet, but am on a diet and plan on losing 15lbs, so should fit then...fingers crossed 😊"
5.0,Really cute and light weight.
5.0,Great hat.  Love it.  Just wished I ordered it sooner so I could've worn it all winter😀
5.0,I LOVE THESE! I will say that they ARE mini. As in very very small. They are more suited for upper piercings than as the main earring you are wearing. But they are cool and sparkle despite their small size.
5.0,Great baggage for short travels. Very nice looking.
5.0,Love these an buy offen for the dream catchers i make. Great color an quality
5.0,"Hubby really loves these  - the fit, the color, the style!  They look great on him!  Will definitely buy more!"
5.0,AAA+++ Highly recommend Thank you
5.0,"I really needed a one-piece watch band for my Garmin. I love the array of colors - it's bright and cheerful. I wish the ends were a dark color rather than white, but all in all, I really like the band."
5.0,I thought they were beautiful but I also thought they were clip on but they were for pierced ears
5.0,Love the look and feel.  I'm so happy with my purchase!
5.0,"Extremely cute and well-made! I was expecting 1 bonnet for my daughter's Pioneer day at school, and we got three!  Highly recommended."
5.0,I think they are very cute and confortable I love them so much
5.0,"Live the pants and the perfect fit. I’m 5’ 31/2”, weighing 125 lbs and the s/m was perfect (although they don’t fit me as a crop, but that’s what I was hoping anyway). Have received many compliments from friends as well as strangers. Very comfortable and the deep hidden pockets are very useful. Would definitely order again. Shipping was super fast. A+++"
5.0,"Soft, warm and very comfortable... I've gotten a lot of compliments when I worn this sweater."
5.0,"Wow! I thought this tie looked pretty good in the pictures that are posted. When it arrived, however... Just stunningly beautiful!<br /><br />The images are nicely discrete and unidentifiable for anyone not paying attention, or who's looking from any distance. From up close, the detail is beautiful. The silk is a nice smooth weave with a gentle satiny luster. The golds are an excellent dye job, not metallic; thus they don't catch the eye from a distance, but look bronzy metallic from the fabric's luster up close. I couldn't be any more pleased!<br /><br />Honestly, I'm a fiber snob, and this tie is better than I could have dreamed! (P.S. My husband LOVED it! Merry Christmas dear.)"
5.0,"My daughter and I are huge Drag Race fans - we always giggle when one of us wears it.  Comfortable and has held up to washing and drying in high temperature.  It took a bit to get to the US, but it still arrived before expected."
5.0,Perfect size!  Looks much more expensive than they were!
5.0,"They are exactly as described, and very strong."
5.0,"I have 3 of these shirts and I absolutely love them. I'm constantly coming back for more. I have black, navy, camo, and tie dye. I love the fit and how these look with leggings and with jeans. So comfortable, washes well.... I'll keep coming back for more!"
5.0,Have had for awhile now they are the only push up bras I use they are my ho to absolutely love them ❤️❤️❤️❤️
5.0,A good item to add to your nightwear . I love it when I my wife uses it and I find it does for very well
5.0,"Print looks great, was afraid it would look blurry, fabric is a good quality"
5.0,Very satsfied
5.0,Beautiful set! I got so many compliments
5.0,"Very good material and great price, I will buy again from them."
5.0,"I bought this for two of my grandchildren & they both loved them! Most of them were flat in various sizes, they love to paint them & leave them around town so other children would find them. It makes both children happy & it shows my grandchildren how it feels to make others happy! It’s a win win situation!"
5.0,I would highly recommend this seller!
5.0,My grandson thinks its really &#34;cool&#34;
5.0,"Love this dress!!! It's so light and cool, perfect for the hot Texas Summer. For the filter figured ladies not sure about size, I am 5'7"" and 240lbs. I carry most of my weight in the belly, bottom, and thighs. This dress is very flattering. It's fitted in the chest and sleeves, accentuates my high waist and then flows beautifully. I bought two and will most likely get a couple more. Love it!!!!"
5.0,"perfect size for my son who is 5 years old, and he didn't complain about the straps on the ears. they were soft!!"
5.0,"I just recently got into traveling. I first used them on a three week trip all around Europe and they were fantastic to use to seperate my shirts, pants socks, miscellaneous items and more. It made it super easy to pack my suitcase as well as to find what I needed. All I had to do was pull out the cube get what I needed and then put the cube back. It’s a great way to keep your stuff organized in your suitcase! I loved them so much I used them on another trip to Europe! Definitely recommend."
5.0,"SOOO cool! Fast shipping, packaging was nice. Lovely for my LOTR collection!"
5.0,Thr material feels great. They are thick and don't show your business. Very pleased
5.0,I love these little earrings. They are so cute and delicate and good quality--no infection or ear sensitivity on me. Highly recommend.
5.0,So cute! I can't wait for my daughter to get here so she can wear this &#60;3
5.0,"I liked this HAFURY brand 19mm Black Watch Band for a number of reasons. First, the band’s soft and pliable material makes it comfortable to wear. Next, not only is the band completely black, but so is the buckle which gives the entire watch band a nicer look when paired with a black-color watch. The band includes pre-installed quick-release spring bars making watch band changes fast and easy. The band also has a clever locking block positioned on the inside of the watch band retention loop that keeps the band from coming loose. All of these qualities already make this band terrific. What gets this HAFURY band 5 stars is the fact that it's currently very reasonably priced as well. I would order this watch band again."
5.0,"LOVE these sandals.  I had to size UP since I am a 9 1/2, so the shoes tend to be wide on me, but with the adjustable strap it works fine!  Great goldish/silver color that goes with just about anything.  I have already worn these sandals all day at work and feel 100% comfortable.  I would highly recommend!"
5.0,A great gift for anyone who is loves technology.  My father got them for christmas and I was instantly jealous!  I ordered my own and love it!  I use it every day to keep things organized.  It is an easy way to keep things tidy and also accessible.  I highly recommend it!
5.0,"I needed this for the new arena in our area, where we have season tickets to AHL games. It fits my keys, wallet, phone, and some gum. I like that it's crossbody and they give you two straps to choose from. It's a good deal if you plan to use it multiple times."
5.0,If you're interested to spirituality this is a must-have item
5.0,So cute soft
5.0,Love this checkbook cover.  It's so beautiful and sturdy.
5.0,These crystal pendants are so dainty and cute! The stones are the perfect splash of color you need to add to any outfit! I love that I can switch them out daily to my chain necklace and sport a new color. They are great for gifts because there is one for each birthstone. I would definitely recommend these pendants!
5.0,"The size of the numbers is a good size. Large enough to be seen well, but not over large to be gaudy looking. The metal is shiny and a thickness. I really like the chain, its a really good size - length and thickness. Looks nice but not small for dainty looking and not overly thick for being gaudy and heavy. Very excited to wear this during soccer season for my kids - #soccermom"
5.0,I have other piano rings that I purchased from amazon and they are nice but I like this ring better because it shows the real look of the black and white piano keys.  I ordered 2 rings and waiting for my third.
5.0,These are perfect dress socks for my husband who wears a size 9 shoe and has pretty narrow feet for a man.  He likes the snug fit plus the extra compression around the arch area.  The stitching on these was done really well too.  He did comment that it did take a little bit of work to get these on though.
5.0,This pin is small but looks very nice.
5.0,"Perfect bag and it looks more expensive than it was. I love this handbag and had debated as I looked in all the stores that I went to and couldn't find one that wasn't cheaply made. This is a great find, not too big but big enough. Everyone who has seen it has asked me what store I got it at and how expensive was it. They aren't surprised that it came from Amazon as I am not an extreme couponer, but an extreme Amazoner. Love the product and the price was perfect. Would recommend this to anyone."
5.0,Fits very well and good quality
5.0,I am in love with this! I am usually a 10/12 and got a medium. It's just right but next time I might get a large as I like things loose. Very nice fabric and quality. Flattering fit.
5.0,"I love these socks! This is my fourth pair of Solmates. The colors are vibrant and beautiful. Socks are comfy and fit fine. I ordered a women’s small and I wear a 7 shoe. I don’t wear them with shoes, just for hanging out at home. I like these much better than Bombas."
5.0,"Bought this for my hubby.  It has an extra cotton lining inside that is very nice and warm (but not in the arms).  And it also has hip pockets and large chest pockets.  My husband loved it.  I've even stole it a couple times to wear outside working in the yard.  Nice quality, very comfortable."
5.0,"It is a pretty thin material so I wore it with tights to stay warm, so it would be a perfect summer dress even with the long sleeves."
5.0,"I love this strap.  It goes on and off the purse easily.  I use it for my purse, a tote bag and a lunch bag.  It is sturdy and comfortable to use.  I highly recommend this as an easy and fun way to change up the look of accessories."
5.0,I bought this as a gift for a teenage girl and it was worth it. The watch is very girly and although the dial is a bit large it's trendy for teenagers. She was impressed that it was stainless steel too. Nice buy.
5.0,Very nice quality very cute choker !
5.0,"This is a fun, sturdy, fashionable hat that my granddaughter really likes.  It offer her warmth with a bit of flair and it is different from what her friends wear."
5.0,"Bought this bag on &#34;lightening deal&#34; about 18 mos ago. Frankly, I couldn't be happier! Yes, the bag is a bit heavier than I anticipated, but the color and the obviously genuine leather smell (yes still faint!) remind me that treating myself to something nice needn't break the bank. I don't typically spend more than 40 bucks on a bag and they are rarely leather, so this bag feels absolutely luxurious. As other reviewers stated it arrived well-protected and looked so lovely. I get compliments on it regularly - which is weird, I don't usually have anything nice enough to warrant that - but I don't have to feel guilty because it was a smart splurge on a bag that will last many seasons - it's THAT well made. Will be eyeing other bags by same maker (darn it!) as I really loved this purchase - if you are on the fence and are considering the red - it's GORGEOUS!"
5.0,3 necklaces that could be worn together or individually. My daughter is very happy.
5.0,"Soft, lightweight dress, fit as expected."
5.0,"Very good quality & fit!<br /><br />The only adjustment I would like is a slightly smaller waistband, but it's fine."
5.0,The chains are nice and thick as well as long so it seems like it will hold up well. Very pretty.
5.0,"Quality is good , love it!"
5.0,The perfect accessory for St Patrick's Day.
5.0,My husband enjoys it very much.
5.0,"Bought this as a gift for my friend's daughter, the purse arrived as described, very cute looking, the material feels good, good capacity for the iphone, cards and keys. length is adjustable. A very good choice as a gift."
5.0,Beautiful quality earring
5.0,This works great my little girl can run quickly and she loves to hide. This prevents me from going crazy and she likes the color pink. I’m a heavy set dad so I’m worried if her getting away from me in a crowded mall. This helps me ease my mind :) I’m happy
5.0,"good fit, very confortable, great look"
5.0,Everything perfect!
5.0,This jacket is perfect.  Very warm.  Wore it in the 40's with just a shirt underneath and was warm and comfortable.  It's really light weight and can easily roll up and be packed.  Looks good too.  Received many compliments on the jacket.  Excellent pockets too!
5.0,"For now, I love this shirt. It's loose and very comfortable. I love the color too, very vibrant and it stands out!<br />I definitely want to buy this shirt but in different colors."
5.0,Great shower shoe
5.0,"This boots is good,Materials is nice,the heels is just about 2&#34; high,but I wish I order 7 and half instead of my regular size 7,because it was a little tight,but then I still keep it because I love it."
5.0,Love this hat! Adorable! Is adjustable inside and provides awesome protection.
5.0,"This Item does run a bit small, so Buyer make sure you order a size bigger! Other than that the dress is beautiful!!"
5.0,Good quality very pretty adjustable length chain
5.0,Just as described - fits against our patio roof by double sliding door
5.0,"I love this wrap skirt/cover-up!  It is very beautiful and sexy.  It does feel somewhat large, but I have a small waist, 28&#34;."
5.0,"The accessories were kind of crappy, but the dress itself (which was what was most important) was amazing. Beautiful and well made. No issues with losing beads or strings. I'm 5'5"", 135#, and wear a 34DD and the medium was a perfect fit.<br />The dress held up perfectly while I sprinted across the interstate, over a guard rail and they the median to help someone who had been in a car wreck in front of us. Despite that, not a single lost bead or lost string."
5.0,I love the shirt.  I bought it for my teenaged grandson.  He likes it too.  You can't go wrong with this shirt.
5.0,Terrific!  My toddler loves them!
5.0,Runs a little small. Husband loves it.
5.0,Daughter in law loves them!
5.0,Liked the tee but it was too small. Will reorder in a larger size.
5.0,Super soft and silky while being well made. Perfect fit and I will be buying more!!
5.0,"I love this dress! Not too long, not too short, not too young, not too old!  Nice silky fabric, very flattering.  I am in my 70s with a bit of a tummy and if it looks good on me, it'll look good on just about anybody!"
5.0,Footjoy socks are the best!
5.0,"My wife ordered it and really likes it. For the price it is nice quality, looks good and is comfortable. Not for the dinner party but nice for everyday uses."
5.0,"Soft flowing fabric, deep pockets, lightweight. I chose the gray color. Paired it with silver jewelry and silver belt . Good value."
5.0,Love this swim suit. My husband loves it too! Fit is perfect!! I’m a young 60 years young full figured gal and I feel good when I wear this swimsuit!
5.0,I love the softness and length. I ordered a medium and it's a little looser than I thought but no problems with it. I bought the yellow one and will definitely be buying more. Love this shirt!!!
5.0,excellent quality in material and the size is perfect
5.0,Love love it super soft
5.0,My sister told me about this product on Christmas said you put your hair in it at night after washing. Sleep in it. Take it off the next morning and hair is super curly and ready to go. I have natural curly mid length hair and have to use a lot of product diffuser and time to get my hair to do what this does overnight. I have no idea how it works and am shocked it does. I thought for sure it would come off in my sleep as it isn’t super tight and I am a pretty restless sleeper. It stays and I don’t even know it’s there. Definitely a keeper and a must have for anyone with curly hair!
5.0,"I LOVE this shirt! It fits perfect and doesn’t fall down or anything like I was afraid of. I wear one of those stick on bra things with it, and it covers the bra completely. Also I have several similar shirts where the arms are a little too tight so it gets all bunchy and makes my arms look sausage-y (which they are not). Will be ordering more colors for sure."
5.0,Very Nice belt for the price. This is my second one. Lost a little weight so I purchased a smaller size.
5.0,So very comfortable. I bought the light pink and just ordered the beige. It &#34;disappears&#34; under several of my shirts that were too sheer to wear with out a full camisole. The back of this bra is completely smooth. I was worried that the lace would be scratchy but it is so very soft. I hate tight bands and this one is very comfortable.
5.0,"I love my new hat, fits perfectly. I also love the material it's made from. I purchased this hat to wear when I'm going to church and I am no sorry that I did."
5.0,Good fit! Not like a potato sack like some billowy shirts. Great with leggings or black work pants.
5.0,"Great fit for my small face, silky material, easy to breathe in for long periods. Love the design, very pretty!"
5.0,These are great! I wear a size 7 shoe and the xs gloves fit perfectly. Very good price. They do a good job keeping my hands generally warm as I have terrible circulation!
5.0,Bought for my self. Nice.
5.0,"I love this dress!!!! The material was better then I thought it was gonna be. I'm normally between size small and medium. I order a medium and it fitted me perfect. I'm 169 cm tall and the dress is maybe around 4-5 cm from touching the ground, which I prefer any way."
5.0,"Great fit, very comfortable, I have worn twice and received many compliments."
5.0,Gift for my husband.  He has several Old Guys Rule shirts - loves them.  Always getting cool comments and compliments.
5.0,"The best thing I could have gotten postpartum. My muscles were starting to separate which was causing me pain. Immediately, I noticed a difference and the pain subsided after wearing for a few weeks."
5.0,"I had never seen green opals before. My mother in law loves green, and opals so I got them as a gift for her. She LOVES them so much. They are just gorgeous! We kept the map of where these earrings were made. Will definitely purchase from this seller again! Absolutely beautiful artistry."
5.0,"Really comfortable, great shorts."
5.0,Super cute! Wear it all the time love love love!
5.0,"Great give and very warm! Doesn't slip down easily and goes up to the right length on my legs (5' 7&#34;), overall great product! Well be buying other socks from them in the future."
5.0,"Absolutely love this dress . Doesn't look cheap at all to me.... The dress is chiffon and chiffon material is see through , but very sexy . The bottom is not as see through and comes with an undergarment attached . It's so elegant and sexy . I plan to pair it with my furry heels that all the girls wear . I'm normally a size small but I ordered a size up and it fits perfectly ! I'm 5'6/5'7 and the dress falls to the floor with or without heels."
5.0,"They are really nice and warm. They fit really nice just didnt stretch as much as I thought, so they are a little snug on my legs but they're still amazing!"
5.0,Went 2 sizes bigger due to having read product feedback. Fit perfectly.
5.0,High quality!  These are hard to find. Even the vendors at the VA don’t carry ADA stuff.
5.0,"Great fit, delivered on time, and the colors and pattern are just my style. Great for low impact and and impact exercises. 100% makes you want to workout and feel confident. One thing though, I wish the pockets were a little tighter so when I jump my phone's not jumping too."
5.0,I really like the different colors
5.0,"Cute bracelet. When I cant be near the mountains, I surround myself with mountain jewelry. It's relaxing, in a unique way."
5.0,"Fit hubby perfectly!  Sometimes boots aren't wide enough for him, but these fit great!  Shipping was fast and the quality seems great!"
5.0,"So comfortable and very fitted. Looks like I'm wearing a tailor made glove. I am not into fashion, but people in Quebec (the trip I bought them for) kept commenting on these nice gloves... bizarre!<br /><br />Be sure to refer to their sizing chart... that made all of the difference (rather than having to return and try again). Be smart, take the time and know your size first!<br /><br />Lastly, works wonderfully with the Samsung S5."
5.0,Belt fits well and is a fun accessory to pair with an outfit.
5.0,M arms are allergic to the sun and these arm covers not only protect them but they stay cool.Nice surprise.
5.0,very nice would buy again

5.0,Exactly what expected! Love!
5.0,"this chemise is the best ever I love the softness of the fabric . it holds up in the wash very well and the adjustable straps makes it very comfortable . the length is spot on as well . over all its a great product, the price was good and I plan on buying more in the future"
5.0,I bought these for my daughter.  She loved them.  She asked me to order more!
5.0,I bought these earrings for my 18 year old niece who loved them. They are perfect for dressy up any outfit.
5.0,I've been shopping for a wallet that was big enough for a reasonable amount of cards but not too big.  This one fit the bill.  As advertised it had places for 3 cards and 2 larger pockets.  What they failed to tell you is that it has on more pocket that is the sized of the whole wallet.  I love this thing.
5.0,Lovely: better than expected. Highly recommend.
5.0,this is Christmas present for Grandson and he loves it
5.0,"Beautiful skirt, good material, well worth the small cost!"

5.0,Great quality u won’t regret buying 😉
5.0,Love it cant wait to try it at school to see if it works for color and relaxers and hair treatments
5.0,"This dress was perfect for a fancy dinner I was attending! I received so many compliments. I ordered an XL which was too big for me, but I didn't have enough time to exchange for a Large. If it had been a large and available to purchase in the red like the pictures, it would have been the perfect dress! Still, it was comfortable and great quality for the price!<br />For reference, I am 5'6"", 153lbs, 36DD"
5.0,I prefer the Stafford shirts to Hanes.  The Hanes shirts I bought started unravelling right away and stretched to easily.
5.0,"I was afraid to order this because: Would it fit? Would it look as good as the picture? Would it be durable? Would it be everything that I want? Simple answer, Yes. Honestly, this is about the average price I would pay for a hat. I wear hats in all weather for all occasions. I don't want to sink a lot of money into a hat because between the dog getting a hold of a few others and the constant need for cleaning, they wear out quick. This feels like it will hold up against dirt and the elements. As far as the size, the adjustable buckles with snap closures ensure a perfect fit. The style is perfect for casual or dressing up. I will be buying a few more colors."
5.0,She loves this hat
5.0,"Love this dress period! Nice material, perfect length...I ordered the green dress in the large and it is to die for...I'm looking forward to buying more colors..I just hope the quality is the same👍🏾"
5.0,Fit perfectly and made me a lot more comfortable
5.0,"I bought two of these, for two people. (They both loved them.)<br /><br />The chain was nice and long, and the watch worked wonderfully on both.<br />They showed up on time."
5.0,Exactly as described. Loved the colors in the earring- could match so many outfits. Wore it with a blue jumpsuit to a wedding and received all the compliments!!
5.0,Really nice payams and good fabric
5.0,"My 9 yr old Loves her masks. Great Quality and is exactly as their ad. Lots of other kids her age that like FNAF, smile when they see hers. I’d buy from them again. Happy Holidays. Elizabeth Andersen"
5.0,"I love this!  Per the comments, I ordered 2 sizes up and it fits great."
5.0,Great looking and feeling shirt.
5.0,Waiting for spring to use it. It is very nice. Hope it wears well.
5.0,It’s a great belt.
5.0,My daughter loves it! Fit was easily adjusted to perfect.
5.0,This apron is super sexy.  I love it.  Cooking is always more fun when you feel good about yourself and this is very flattering.
5.0,Arrived in great shape.  Great pin for my pirate costume.
5.0,"Pretty good so far, it's shiny, decent size and looks good over all."
5.0,I absolutely love the material of the dress.
5.0,"Surprisingly comfortable, though I’d suggest wearing with socks. They are soft-ish, but not like a normal slipper - and they are snug around the ankle (which in my case is a good thing). They are the perfect extra warmth for me since most slippers make my feat sweat too easily. I like the rubber/vinyl bottom since it allows me to go outside quickly and avoids wet socks and keeps my socks cleaner (I have two kids under the age of 5, so there’s always some kind of mess on the floor). Highly recommended. Keep in mind that these have pretty much zero support, so don’t expect some kind of extra cushy feeling as you walk around the house."
5.0,"It was a little big for him, but that’s okay. He’s 9 months and I bought a size 12 months. Love it."
5.0,"Good quality, my Dad loves it. Too big for a ladies' hat, good size for a guy."
5.0,I love this spacious bag
5.0,Loved the color and they are so comfortable
5.0,"I loved it, very fun dress for summer and into fall"
5.0,I really like this glasses
5.0,"This was probably unnecessary for me to purchase. But golly do I love it!<br /><br />I went abroad this fall to Europe to study. I of course had a bunch of electronics to bring. I packed my bag, originally placing all my electronic stuff in gently, and eventually it became this large bundle. So, for my own sanity, I purchased this last-minute and organized my stuff. It saved SO MUCH ROOM, and made everything so much easier! Also, I felt so organized and special for using it.<br /><br />So, maybe not worth the money to everyone. But I found it worth the last-minute splurge, especially since I was traveling with so many electronics. And maybe as time goes on, I'll get more use out of it, and it will be worth even more to me."
5.0,Bought this for a program at the school where I work. Fit great and very high quality for the price. Got so many compliments on it!
5.0,Got a pair for my daughter who is very picky about running pants. These fit great and are comfortable.
5.0,I LOVE all my barefoot dreams apparel. They are so comfortable and soft I can't find anything to complain about. They are a little pricey but well worth it
5.0,Very well made belt- locks in place tight and doesn't need adjustment. I purchased this for work so I would have a belt that mixed utility and style and it works great for both. The belt does not flake from wear and is flexible so there are no tigt spots.
5.0,"This soft fabric outfit is warm and so comfortable to wear. Color is what I expected and the fit, also."
5.0,These socks are great and keep my feet warm and dry. I will be getting more of these soon.
5.0,"It will make a great little tinder bag for anyone.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Quality is good<br />Not very large<br /><br />Cons:<br />I really don't have any cons, its a waxed canvas bag for holding fire tinder, unless it flys apart on me in the middle of a winter storn in BFE it should be fine."
5.0,So cute! So worth the money
5.0,I needed a size in between the regular ones because the 12 was too long and the 10 to short but this one fit’s perfectly
5.0,I recommend the store and product that are of good quality
5.0,Nice and delicate. It's heavy enough which ti gives a great look.
5.0,"This appears to be well made.  We have a full sized stadium bag.  This is about half the size of that.  Holds a wallet purse, small water bottle, phone, hat - the items I needed - with room to spare."
5.0,Love these pants. Super comfortable and dressy looking. But I am typically an average at 5’6” and ordered the shortest and still had to wear heels. So expect them to run long.
5.0,LOVE this dress. Fits perfectly to my figure and fabric is comfortable.
5.0,"Been wearing this for months now and has held up against the elements (showers, beach days etc) really well! No signs of wear yet, Good value!"
5.0,its a good hat that fits perfectly. the design on the hat is also perfect and looks genuine.

5.0,love it! exactly the colors and look I was going for.
5.0,I love each and every one of mine I have like 20 of them there awesome
5.0,These gummy bears are the best quality I have been able to find on many sites! I have ordered these several times and I do not think I ever had any defects (which is rare when purchasing resin gummy bears). I absolutely love these cabochons and will continue to buy them for my business to make earrings.
5.0,Sexy bra i got black w pink true to size going to order the other white one thats avalible as well!
5.0,perfect for Ugly sweater party
5.0,Gave as a gift so cute not heavy nice detail
5.0,My daughter has had this blanket since she was a baby. She’s now six years old and still takes it everywhere.
5.0,This is a great gift for a guy who wears shirts that need collar stays. The punch works with ease through gift card plastic!<br />I've even decided to use some punched stays in my Art journal as pointers and book marks. This handheld punch is really sharp and easy to use. I'm very pleased with it.
5.0,Super adorable set! The fabric is nice and soft I love wearing them to sleep. They also fit perfectly!
5.0,Very cute bag. Love it.
5.0,Very nice. Not flimsy like so many earring are. Bought as a gift. Will buy a pair for myself.
5.0,"With all the shirt stay straps that I've used in the military, and in the corporate life after serving, these straps are perfect for a wide range of occasions. The quality of the shirt clips are exceptional and will not slip, no matter what, all the while without damaging the shirt.<br />The strong hold of the clips is due to the spring tension of the metal, complimented by plastic cleats, gripping the shirt material without fail.<br />The clips are very easy to attach and detach from the shirt, along with an easy slip on foot loop, which together provide a quick solution for those semi-formal occasions. I bought these shirt stays discounted, during a promotional event and this is my experience of using them."
5.0,"Me gustó, sólo que el color azul es como opaco, no es un azul bonito brillante,  es un azul cenizo, eso ni me gustó, por lo demás, el tamaño bueno como lo esperaba."
5.0,"I usually buy expensive clothes, but was very surprised by the quality of this blouse."
5.0,Better than the fitbit bracelet! I'm very pleased with my purchase!
5.0,"I ADORE this bathing suit. I have larger lady bits up top and they held them well (the pads could be a little better/larger, but they're still really effective). I want to get this suit in more colors if they restock my size. This suit is really flattering and doesn't give me the sausage look that certain fabrics of one piece suits do. Love it!"
5.0,Super nice and soft a little long but good for those who do not like to show off too much in the bridesmaid getting ready
5.0,"I ve tried so many pjs to be able to find the right; soft, breathable and comfy one. I don’t spend time for reviewing usually but this has to be highlighted hands up! The best I bought through amazon! Don’t search more!"
5.0,Very nice fit and stayed in place. Hadn't worn shoulder pads in years but had a dressy top that just needed a little something and these were the trick.
5.0,Had to sent the first order back because it was to loose.  The new one is great
5.0,"I love wearing it to show of my Potterheadidness without going overboard. I always get complements, even from non Potterheads, even though some of them don't recognize it immediately. When that happens, they are in for a scolding from yours truly.<br /><br />I've seen that some people don't know how to change the time on it. It's really quite simple: pull up the button that also opens up the watch, then turn it to cove the hands.<br /><br />Also, when I received it, I was worried about whether I would be able to change the battery. So I emailed the seller, they were super helpful although their instructions were a bit unclear. I figured it out though: Take something really thin, like a nail file, and worm it under the side of the back cover and push it off. It comes off easily and to put it back on just push it into place. Make sure you note which side of the battery is face up when you replace it.<br /><br />I hope this answers some of your questions and brings some clarity to the whole thing!"
5.0,These were a birthday gift for my 4 year old grandson. He loves them!  Good fit and room to grow into his mittens. They've not been washed yet but the label says machine washable. (It's fleece--hoping for minimal pilling.)
5.0,I ordered this for a necklace which was too short for my neck. This extender worked perfect!<br />Received in plenty of time; in perfect condition

5.0,great ...they are what I expected

5.0,I like that you can’t tell they are readers.
5.0,I bought these for a wedding.  The fuchsia color matched perfectly with the fuchsia dresses.  Great tie for the price-I don't know if they will hold up well afterwards but I only needed them for this one event.
5.0,I loved the dress .  The sizes run a little small.  I should of over the next size up.
5.0,Great bag. Ample pockets and a middle section with a zipper compartment. I love that I can secure my valuables in the zipper section. I can fit so much more in this bag than I even thought I could. I do get a lot of compliments on the bag. Love Challa bags. They are so unique.
5.0,"This shirt is awesome, the quality of the print, the drawing and the size everything is perfect. I really enjoy it."

5.0,"Even though I'm busty and hippy, it still holds the ladies in and that's an A+ for me. I LOVE IT!"
5.0,"Purchased several Neleus brand sports T for workout.  So far I like the dry fit flexible fabric the best.  This is my 3rd purchase.  It's very comfortable and the darker ones makes you look more fit and boosts your confidences more.  If you are a size 33-34 waist recommend get size L for a comfortable fit.  Product looks great, comfortable and yes very lightweight."
5.0,Todo perfecto 🤩

I was able to separate and keep all my items organized and easy to access for my husband who will be the one digging through my bag to help me with essentials after birth!

5.0,I love it!!! Great quality and I love how it is very unique looking. It looks expensive too. Can't wait to wear it on the beach!
5.0,"I'd definitely suggest you size down.  I nearly sized up because I wanted to make sure I had a swingy fit, and I am sooo glad I did not!  This definitely runs a little big, plus it has stretch.  Whatever you do, do not size up.<br /><br />Very cute and comfortable dress.  Flattering, and it's very nice for days of transitional weather.  Print as pictured (I have the black with peach roses).<br /><br />I have only worn it with leggings as I find, even though I'm short, that the back hem is a little short for my preferences if worn alone."
5.0,"Love it, especially the color."
5.0,"Comfortable, warm, and looks expensive."
5.0,"This bag is seriously nicer than i thought it would be, and also bigger😂 Brushed suede look, plenty of pockets inside."

5.0,My fiancé and I love it it’s really soft to sleep in
5.0,Really comfortable shoes--straight out of the box!  Instantly became my favorite pair!  Runs about about a half size small.  Maybe even more than a half.

5.0,Great fit. Adds layer of protection for no leaks.
5.0,Super shear. However if you wear a slip it's totally fine
5.0,Hubby loved them!!!
5.0,"Really cute and pretty fluff. I purchased this to put on my diaper bag so I was worried about the size and how it would look. I bought the small fluff (5.1&#34;/13 cm) and it looks amazing and prettier then I expected. Also, haven't had any shedding. Very happy with my purchase."

5.0,"The material is form fitting and stretches, so it will hug your every curve. I sing for a group monthly and always try to outdo my last dress. Next month I don't know how I'll beat this one. I was told it was my best one yet and had at least 1/2 dozen compliments on it. I came back to see if it is available in other colors but it isn't. :o( ."

5.0,Really cute and very colorful.
5.0,"super comfortable. nice enough to dress up for church with lacy slip peeking out of bottom & scarf around neck, or wear lounging at home.."
5.0,I love it casual but sexy
5.0,"Wow, what a deal.  3 great tanks for under $25.  Im a bigger guy (6'1'' 250 lbs) and into powerlifting, and these fit perfect.  Im  not into getting super cut, so stringer tanks just down work for me (they look horrible on me). These, however are perfect.  They fit just like my other 2xl tanks.  They also offer some streatch, but are far from skin tight.  I have full confidence that these will survive any workout.  I have worn all three, but am yet to wash them.  5 stars, and I will adjust if they end up shrinking.  Highly recommended for all gym activities, or just a comfy shirt on your day off."
5.0,"I do love these leg warmers.  They fit well, with a bit of a slouch, as thy should.  They are not the real long ones, which they state before you purchase.  They are a great fit.  I am pleased.  They do keep you warm.  I do recommend these."
5.0,"It shipped a lot faster than I thought it would; the time said to expect it nearer to Chirstmas or New Year's, and it actually got here before my party. It has a nice, tight fit, and the mesh and fabric aren't itchy at all, which is grand. The black fabric is decently thick, so it's warmer than the mesh and no chance of it being see-through (I find a lot of similar shirts have that issue). There's no tags in the shirt anywhere about washing instructions, so to be on the safe side I'd suggest cold wash and hang/lay flat to dry. But it looks great and is very well-put together. Initially I only bought this as a shirt for a cosplay, but the quality's really nice enough to wear out. I'm definitely buying other shirts and dresses from them in the future &#60;3"
5.0,Great price and great looking glasses.
5.0,My daughter just recently started collecting Italian charms again and she is absolutely thrilled with this one and it fits her too
5.0,I love this cardigan! It looks like it came from a boutique
5.0,Love this ring. We purchased it for my 5 year old stepdaughter. We wanted to do a ring ceremony with her so she felt included. She does not take the ring off and it has stood up to a kindergartener. We purchased it knowing that her little hand would grow and this way we could get a larger size and not waste money sizing it. Very happy with the ring.
5.0,"Daughter liked it! I liked it, too. She doesn't know, but I wore it to work and my coworker complimented me on the necklace!"
5.0,Perfect little lemon earrings
5.0,Perfect size purse.  Love the chic style .  Also has zippered closure under flap for security.
5.0,"I love this sweater.  It fits perfectly,  is stylish and warm.  I like it so much I am ordering another one in a different color."
5.0,"I originally bought a pair at the Fred Hall Fishing Show in March. They were so cute that I bought one pair. I mean, who doesn't like mismatched socks? Plus they were handmade with cotton yarn and appeared to be well made.<br /><br />These socks are extremely comfortable. I have worn them with my Crocs and worn them around the house on cold days. Since I only had one pair, I was constantly washing them. It's been 9 months and the color has not faded nor has the material been worn down. Really wished I had purchased more. Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised to see these on Amazon. Problem is: which color combination to choose next. Hmmmm."
5.0,I love this dress!!!  It's exactly what I wanted. Fits great!!!
5.0,"This is an ""oldie"" but ""goody!""  I have been using these for years!  Really helps to keep in natural curls overnight!"

5.0,"After having surgery for melanoma, I was advised to protect myself from the sun. Since I run marathons, this was the answer to my problem. They are very comfortable, and actually feel cool, even in direct sun."
5.0,This did have duplicatesome. But it was worse the price. Pluss you can add to this jewlery and create new and make your own creation. Good for retail....yes..... fundraiser....yes... worth it
5.0,"I had to do a little tailoring which was no fault of anyone, I'm just naturally short. Wore it at a colleague's wedding with my fiancé, the dress got a lot of compliments. Will be wearing it to take our engagement pictures."

5.0,Really beautiful with delicate feminine details.  Love it!
5.0,"So cute, was a gift for Valentine's day to my hubby and he loved it!"
5.0,"Found these cute ass gauges for 3 bucks a pair! Well made and super cute they are perfect for my ear stretching project. For the price of what one set costs with other sellers, it's well worth it. Now I have a good pair to wear between gauging until I reach the size I wanted which is 8mm. I'd also like to shout out to the seller for the super cute extras you send are a nice little gesture and surprise! I enjoy getting them! Thank you again!"
5.0,This is my new favorite  nightgown! It is cute and comfy all in one! It says “cat mom” on it-which I absolutely love-and fits perfectly to my shape. The color is beautiful and it is nice and soft. I wear this nightgown as often as I can and enjoy it every time!

This top is well-made: perfectly weighted fabric 4 a smooth silhouette, the style is very slimming, shows no rolls, and there's no riding-up of the fabric anywhere. Very nicely done!!"

5.0,I wanted a small diaper bag and that's what I got.
5.0,Works great and they are very comfortable on the neck.
5.0,"Disliked nothing.  They are soft,warm and cute."
5.0,"I've now had this dress for a year and a half and I wanted to update my review:  Possible negative which I'm still perfectly happy with: the lace trim at the collar and sleeves and hems has faded a bit, while the rest of the dress has not, leaving it with a rose lace trim on a burgundy dress.  As mentioned in my previous review, the red one is a brighter red in real life than it appears on the screen here, and it's a fantastic color.  It fit true to the size chart.  My friends keep trying to steal it because it looks good on everyone.  The lace is soft and nice-feeling on the skin."
5.0,"They were for my husband and he loves them keeps his feet warm when he goes out to take care of our cattle, Thanks a lot"
5.0,"I love this Hoodie and have lived in it since I bought months ago. I thought the misspelling of Emotional was hilarious. Be careful washing it, the washer and dryer definitely made the picture of peep start to come off, and the material really collects little lint pills and pet hair. I still love it and I'm wearing it as we speak lol. Definitely kept me warm and I'll always love Rocking peep merch."
5.0,"I service about 3 classes of 30 students each, and a para's salary. But I'm not the grinch, so I was happy to find something that my students would use, would enjoy, and was still affordable enough that i could get 36 students something and more durable than paper. Now, I should clarify that I did specify to every *single* class ""I have over 90 of you, there's only one of me. If I got something for everyone, you probably would all end up with a 33 cent bookmark"" and then would use the class dojo randomizer to select 9 students a class. Kiddos were putting the mittens on right after getting them, no joke. It is really true, you cannot have too many fluffy gloves. Sadly, a few friends had to be reminded of the rationale for why everyone didn't get one afterwards. Fortunately, it was the IEP students, and they understood as soon as I pointed out, ""can you imagine how expensive it would be if you had to get a gift for your homeroom teacher, the sped teacher, myself the para, the speech teacher AND all the specials teachers?"" But in all seriousness, thank you so much for making it affordable for me to not be the grinch this year!"
5.0,Very pleased with set and would purchase again
5.0,Soft and good quality.  I plan to buy more!
5.0,"Very flexible, and it fits."

5.0,I have worn readers for about 6 years. Scojo is the ONLY brand I will buy. They are a bit pricey but are totally worth it. They have so many stylish pairs to choose from and they never break. I LOVE every pair I have purchased and I own about 6. I don’t lose them but like to change styles/colors about every 6 months. You cannot go wrong w these.

5.0,Very nice socks.  Thank you pf

5.0,"This bag works beautifully with my ALICE pack and frame. I currently have two belts through the loops on the bottom of the ALICE pack and the frame, anchoring the compression pack to the bottom of the ALICE frame. It's a versatile bag, offering a tailored size from 8"" x 8"" X 8"" all the way to its maximum size of 8"" x 8"" X 18"". Good for many things, in this case, my tent and maps."

5.0,"Adorable hoodie, bright colors,nice fit, thanks!"
5.0,"Flowy, soft and fits perfectly.  FYI, I am 5'8"", 155 lbs. and a large was just right."
5.0,"I sized down as other reviews suggested and it was still a little bigger than expected but I machine-washed and -dried it. Seems to have shrunk just a little; more fitted in the shoulders now. Very comfortable, soft fabric, loose in all the right places, and POCKETS!!! might order other colors."
5.0,Amazing mask!!! The fit is perfect and the look is awesome. Great display piece too!
5.0,Está precioso. Pero no es compatible para 38mm
5.0,The pictures do not do the bag justice. My mother absolutely loves this bag!
5.0,"pretty, breathable, and it has a tiny bit of elasticity to it so wearing it for very long periods of time while working is great!"
5.0,Love these pants! A little long and had to hem but love the overall fit!
5.0,"I like that these come in 2 packs. Even though I am a small, read the reviews and opted to size up after reading that these are cotton and will shrink up after wash and dry. After one wash and dry cycle they shrunk down a bit and now have a better fit in my waist. Most importantly, they are not embarrassingly short! If you want to wear these out, beach, pool, lounging, etc,...size up to account for shrinking and you'll get more wear out of them. They're extremely comfortable light everyday wear cotton."
5.0,I love the fit I’m going to order more
5.0,Great for yoga; I love the grip on the heel/toe!
5.0,"They lay flat (look ironed), don't curl up on the edges,  haven't unraveled , and are the original size despite many washings.<br />Other bandanas look like a lump wrinkled of fabric, lose 1-2 inches in width after one washing..<br />Just wish they had more color choices. I can't  get myself to order more from other companies because the quality is so poor. But , not happy with the limited colors. Luckily the quality makes up for putting up with only dark colors."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:a490bedf0e064e24acb1c3e42757534]] Stretchy, squat proof. The scrunch is subtle but so flattering. Waistband stays in place and is seamless, cutest leggings I have. There are some knockoffs of these I recommend getting from this brand because the ones I have are great quality. I don’t get the itchy thing people talk about with these. They are super comfortable. The stretch is crazy. I usually order a size L in all my leggings as I carry weight in my thighs, glutes, and hips. I got a medium in these and they fit perfectly. Could even get into a small but I’m happy with the M. Buy these."
5.0,I love this robe...excellent for the money!!! buy with confidence
5.0,They are really beautiful
5.0,"This is a very comfortable shirt, I love the cotton fabric.  The mock turtleneck is a nice fit also as it doesn't fit around the neck too tight as turtlenecks sometimes do.  I also like the length, when you raise your hands the tummy is still covered! I have several of these shirts, wish they came in more prints."
5.0,Wonderful gift from the boyfriend! Excellent symbolism behind the piece.
5.0,I have enjoyed this cap for many years.  Just bought a new one in a larger size.  The old one was always snug and growing my hair out and repeated washing made it too tight.  I don't like to wear caps so this one is nice on hikes because I can pull it out of my back pocket and put it on in the sunny sections and put it away easily in the shade
5.0,"another review said the hook bent...  I wonder what they were hanging?  my x-large 7mm wetsuit hangs just fine.  But I wouldn't put anything heavier like a BC or weight belt on it.<br /><br />it took me a couple of tries to figure out the latch which does take quite a bit of pressure and you have to be careful to not get your fingers pinched.  but once you understand where to press and how hard to press then it works great.<br /><br />it looks nice and it functions well, what more could you ask for?"
5.0,"Very comfortable, soft, great fit."
5.0,Love these slippers. And so does my 2 year old. Nice and soft in the inside and great soles on the bottom. Finally found some slippers that actually don't send my kid flying on our wood floors...haa haa
5.0,Love this band. Very good quality and stays on.
5.0,Got these for all of the kids in the family during our Christmas night with family. They all loved them and played in the basement with them for hours!
5.0,"Best &#34;no show&#34; sock I've purchased yet. As a size 10, most of these type socks slip off the back of my foot many times per day. These have not done so after multiple days of wear.  The are specifically for sizes 10-12.5. Also these are made different than any others I have seen. Constructed unlike most socks, These have a bottom piece of material which is shaped like the outline of a foot. This flat bottom piece of material is sewn to the piece which covers the sides of the foot/tops of toes. IMO, this is what keeps the socks from slipping off a large foot like my size tens."
5.0,I work in a Gym...It's always cold from the air conditioning.  I wanted an open-front sweatshirt to wear with my yoga-wear before my class started.  I love this sweatshirt!!!  It looks really cute with jeans too :)
5.0,I loved this keychain.  The saying was perfect and it was a nice touch kind of gift.
5.0,"I ordered both colors, blue is like on the picture, but grey is GREEN! not grey!<br />Very comfortable and great for hot weather. Love them."
5.0,"Not trucker look. I like the baseball style and this fits perfectly. Nice looking hat, a first pick when wearing a hat"
5.0,They're comfortable
5.0,"I bought the size L-slim (!!!!!!) at my local Mast store about a month ago, paid full retail. Within a couple weeks I almost got a second one in a different color. I didn't only because this will join my &#34;special clothing&#34; collection that includes a Royal Robbins pullover sweater that is 20 years old, &#34;made of plastic 2-liter Coke bottles,&#34; is light and warm, and is in the same condition as brand-new except faded.  If I had two it would not be &#34;special&#34; any more. I hope that makes sense. Patagonia is of similar high quality as RR, and I expect great performance for years.<br /><br />Specifics:  Very light. Well-made. Retains heat well, and the &#34;waffled&#34; inner fabric distributes heat such that I keep comfortable and can control temp via the zipper. I'd call this a technical garment in terms of its &#34;science&#34; and consider it as warm as a light-to-medium-weight parka of 10 years ago.<br /><br />Fit is a definite plus. I am 6'1&#34; with a long waist, and I weigh 163 lb. When I tried on the size L-slim Patagonia I marveled at the clean fit, as if it were tailor-made for me. It's comfortably loose but not at all baggy. I can throw a ball, do big circles with both arms at the same time, and hug my wife with free movement at my shoulders and armpits, yet without the body of the garment riding up. I could easily wear it if I weighed another 10 lb, maybe more, but I won't guess. I think part of the warmth of this pullover comes from my body not having to warm all the cloth of a typical size L garment. Thanks, Patagonia!"
5.0,Good quality and comfort
5.0,very much my style
5.0,"The band on my black Casio (of 5 years) broke so I thought I’d get a new one, and why not in gold! I never take this off and I’ve showered in it, swam in it, baked with it, you name it. Runs perfectly on time and minor to small scuffs are visible on the face after ~1.5 months of wearing it. Backlight is better than my old one. Highly recommend this very trustworthy watch."
5.0,Papa b day present
5.0,"I ordered size 45 since I wear US 10.5 and they fit just right. I've taken them to two rides so far together with M530 pedals on a road bike, and they really make a difference coming from regular shoes and platform pedals."
5.0,"Great shirt, my son loved it."
5.0,"It's a very comfortable dress. I do recommend you wear an under garment because the material is very soft so it sticks to your skin and shows every imperfection lol, so if you're plus size like me, under garment is a must. I'm 5'3, 210lbs 40D chest."
5.0,"I LOVE these and wore them for the better part of a week,m. Not even exaggerating. Thick weight, cozy and warm. Well made. Love the “pop” of orange lining. I’m 5’8 & 160/165 lbs, I ordered a medium and they fit like a dream. A little extra bonus...I have 3 dogs who like to sit on my lap and worried about dog hair sticking to the pants, but that was not an issue at all! My one and only criticism is that I wish that they came in multiple colors because I would buy a different color for every day of the week!"
5.0,Love this dress and colors I bought 3 so far !
5.0,"I read every review for this dress on the fit and based upon them, I sized down. I wish I hadn’t! I am 5’8” 180lbs. It fit true to size. I have a small chest and the chest area fit fine because the straps were pretty taut. The length, however, was shorter than I thought it would be. It came to my ankles and I was hoping for it to be sweeping the ground in high heels. The quality is exceptional. I altered it some for a themed event - let the hem out, lengthened the straps, and attached leaves to the chest area. I’ll probably order again but I’m a size large."
5.0,Shipping was a week faster than expected. Amazing surprise as they are a birthday gift. Great quality socks!!
5.0,Nice cuff.  Hits at mid ear. It is pretty much just as the picture shows.  Glad I bought it.
5.0,"This is the perfect little cross body bag!  I use it mainly for traveling or going to theme parks.  It easily fits a wallet, sunglasses, cell phone, plus other smaller items.  There are lots of different pockets so that everything stays organized.  What a great deal!"
5.0,"I bought one ring for my mom for mother's day, another matching one for myself.  They are perfect and the engraving is crisp and clear, highly visible.  My mom loved hers, and I love mine.  Great price, great quality and perfect size for everyday wearing."
5.0,Does run large. I normally wear a large and this jacket in medium fits great. I would highly recommend purchasing.
5.0,"Comfortable right out of the box, well made and a great price"
5.0,"Me agrado, se lo regale a mi hija"
5.0,"I love these so much!! So durable and such nice material. Not only are the colors beautiful, but the studs are smooth and you can tell they were made very carefully and no corners were cut. Such wonderful earrings!!"
5.0,My6 year old Granddaughter loved this.
5.0,Comfy shirt and good quality! I love it!!
5.0,"So nice, more beauty in person. Fits perfect, arrived on time."
5.0,"Bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  Nice, thick material and graphics are well done.  She is a junior size 7/8 and the small fits nicely without being tight."
5.0,The dress is impressive and high quality. The accessories set is an adorable bonus!
5.0,"This is I think the 4th pair I've ordered and I love them! They are super soft like lularoe, lightweight and are not see through at all, I definitely recommend and will order more colors"
5.0,"One of my better buys from Amazon. Think good color, comfortable, fits well! Would defintely buy again!"
5.0,"great, ordered and received exactly as expected."
5.0,The Price!
5.0,"Made in the USA! Quality product, not a LEO, belt use for business casual dress, ability to swap buckles is cool!"
5.0,Bought for my son to use for prom. It matched his dates dress perfectly.
5.0,This little charm was what I hoped it would be.  Nice weight of sterling silver and the CZs were clear and sparkly! Very pretty!
5.0,Really well made good quality
5.0,Love this watch!! Received it for my birthday and I wear it everyday. This watch is beautiful and classic. I've always wanted a pearl face watch and this is just perfect!!
5.0,Great fitting and comfortable good looking eyewear....Quality at a great price....
5.0,The size is perfect. I like there is a lock inside which others bucket bag don't have it. It looks gorgeous!
5.0,I have been buying these panties for a few years now.  They are nice and fit very well.
5.0,Love the pockets and fit of the dress!
5.0,Adorable little shoes.<br />My 20 month old is between a size 4 and 5 and these have a little room for her to grow into them in the summer. I'm very happy with the purchase and the price.
5.0,"I bought this jacket as a present and the recipient wears it outside and around the house all the time. The mint green and silvery off-white look great and the embroidered tigers look tough. It is thin and not made for arctic climes, and it is not going to hold up to abusive treatment. For the price, it is a great buy."
5.0,It was a bit big when it came but that was expected as I have somewhat small ears. But I was able to bend the metal a bit and it fits perfect!
5.0,absolutely love these! beautiful and well made! flexible material and now I can really see when I'm skiing!
5.0,"The dress looks very similar to what is advertised, but fits me slightly differently. It has a lower cut. I’m not very busty, so no dangers there, while still appearing classy. The waist is tapered. My own is not tapered quite as much as I would like, so pleased with this illusion.  If not wanting curves to show much, you may want to size up. Out of the bag, I thought it looked large, but definitely not, when I tried on. I’d like to be able to blame the mfgr, for the dress being a bit fitted, but truth be told, I’ve gained a few. Lol! At 5’8”, 145lbs  35.5-27.5-37.5, I’m wearing a size M. There is inside fabric, with a faux wrap atop. The inside fabric fits snugly, but just fine. However, If I gain any, there cld be a problem. It is “not” a stretch fabric with a zipper back. The fabric is delicate, and if too tight will probably rip.  Mulberry color was discounted at time of purchase. I guess not many wanted, but I am really quite pleased with this color. In short, I believe  this dress is better looking than expected, and the design will be flattering on different body types."
5.0,The material is very soft and comfy
5.0,I was looking for a two-tone band for my Apple Watch 4. This is a good quality band and looks very nice. It was a little bit of a challenge to remove the links; but they send very good quality tools to make the process easier.
5.0,"It's a little tight around my boobs, which was to be expected cuz I have very large boobs.  I love this top, it's so cute and the material is nice and soft, and it matches perfectly with these super cute shoes I got!"
5.0,"My daughters are still crazy about One Direction and after MUCH looking, I found this shirt for one of them and love it.  The design looks great and each of the boys pictures look good!  So many of these 1D band shirts have terrible pics of them, but this one is perfect.  My daughter usually wears a girls 8-10 and this shirt is just a bit baggy on her which is what I expected since it is a junior size.  It is still super cute and she adores it."
5.0,Ever since I ordered this I haven't taken it off its very classy and sparkly! I added two clear coats of nail polish to prevent any discoloration or any green and its worked! love this ring its my new fav.
5.0,"Color is beautiful, nice quality. I like the necklace but the clasp made me a little nervous so I modified it myself, no big deal. It made such a difference, it feels more secure. I even slept with the necklace and had no problems. Shipping was super quick I received both my necklaces on the first day promised. I am sooo happy. Envelope was very well protected and postmarked from India post making it more authentic in my eyes. The necklace came in a pretty red pouch, was expecting the black pouch with the Ayana Wellness but no big deal. Thank you I will definitely purchase from this company again."
5.0,So cute! I want to buy more!<br />It is thick enough that no slip is needed. Fits comfortably
5.0,Good quality. Super cute.
5.0,Love the watch and get compliments on it everywhere I go.  Had to remove two links to make it fit and it was fairly easy to do so.  Only had one problem with the instructions on turning off the chime/alarm.  Finally figured out that button &#34;B&#34; and &#34;C&#34; were incorrectly identified.  Looking forward to wearing this watch for a long time.
5.0,"Received this polishing cloth today. I wanted to shine up my Pandora bracelet and some of my rings. I am SO impressed! All of my jewelry looks beautiful, especially my Pandora bracelet and charms! I will definitely order this product again!"
5.0,This style baseball cap is cooler than some others because of the mesh top. It's adjustable and it fit me perfectly. It arrived in perfect condition and ahead of the scheduled delivery date.
5.0,Bought to replace my old wore out biker wallet. The tiger is raised about 1/8” from the embossed wallet cover so a little thick. It holds all my cards and other junk we seem to think is important enough to put in it. Cash fits nicely better than my old wallet. My daughter liked mine so much she asked me to to get her one to. I gifted her one and she love it.
5.0,Brilliant & larger than expected.
5.0,This was a great product I got for my sons at Christmas and they loved it!
5.0,I think it's an excellent top for what I paid for. I love to wear it with my jeans shorts and it looks good.
5.0,I loved these boots and they are very comfortable very comfortable.  Loved the side zipper function 100 in my book
5.0,"These socks are warm, comfy and stylish!"
5.0,I was very happy with this dress I ordered it for my mother for a wedding. We did order one size larger than she would have typically because the material is not very stretchy. She was very pleased with how it fit it was not to loose and not to tight.<br />Would buy again.
5.0,"I have a big melon (7 5/8&#34; and up depending on brand). XL is a little snug on me but good enough. However, I think Dorfman Pacific should consider XXL and up sizes for those of us with big noggins. 2.5&#34; brim lies nice and flat unsnapped thanks to extra support around the outer edge of the brim. It can even be shaped a little but ,like others mentioned, it probably won't fold well due to the plastic support piping in the brim. It easily goes flat without folding though. Looks kind of funny snapped up. Like a too small cowboy hat. Brim needs to be bigger for the snapped up look to work imo but that's not why I bought it so not an issue for me.<br /><br />I also bought The Hat Depot 300N1510 Wide Brim Foldable Double-sided Outdoor Boonie Bucket Hat for a few bucks more and there's no comparison imo. L/XL is way too tight on me. Not unexpected though since it only comes in two &#34;shared&#34; sizes. No head band around the outside and mesh lining like the Dorfman. 3&#34; brim doesn't lie flat unsnapped because there's no support like the Dorfman. It wants to angle down and looks like a frumpy bonnet just like the pictures on the mannequin head show. Doesn't want to shape either :/<br /><br />Dorfman Pacific gets my vote!"
5.0,"Very cute hat and fits my head perfectly. I bought several colors to match my outfits. They are so stylish and can be worn on many occasions- so suitable for my fashion needs. This hat is a good value for the quality, comfort, fit, style and price."
5.0,"Very spacious, has room for a week packing"
5.0,"I was quite happy with the customer service. I'm also pretty happy with the durability given that I wear the watch for all kinds of running, swimming, and calisthenics. Would purchase again."
5.0,"My daughter wore this to Disneyland for her first birthday. It's nice and stretchy, lightweight, and is great quality. Very true to size. Could not be happier! I also love that the bow can be taken off the headband because she hates to wear handbands. The bow slides into her hair in two seconds and she leaves it on all day."
5.0,Very please fast shipping
5.0,A++ - Highly recommended
5.0,I love that they all came in individual packaging instead of altogether so they wont get scratched up. I also loved that there was such a variety of the sunglasses and that the were different in their own way and that they can go with anything.
5.0,christmas gift for my son
5.0,"These are my Favorite Panty - no pun intended... and I believe they discontinued the line because I can't locate them in Walmart, Target or anywhere locally. They do not pinch or ride up, they are soft and really comfortable."
5.0,So pretty!  Very light weight.
5.0,Wore this for my company holiday party and it worked out perfect. The fit was great and the material was comfortable.
5.0,"I lose gloves like I lose sunglasses, frequently. Plus I tend to get them dirty during the season so I didn't want to spend money on expensive gloves. These are the perfect price point in a bulk package of traditional knit gloves that fit a variety of hand sizes, so I can share them with other people too. At this price I don't mind throwing them away when they get to dirty or if I happen to lose one. Plus the variety of colors means you have a pair to wear with just about anything."
5.0,"Finally, a bra that will hold up during my intense workouts! I wear a 34D & got the small. Perfect size for me! Not too tight, just right."
5.0,"Makes a great gift, and comes on a cute gift box"
5.0,I use to go out.
5.0,Cute as a dress or top.
5.0,Great base layer or stand alone. I love this hoodie
5.0,Every one compliments how great it looks
5.0,Love this top!  Looks great with my jeans.
5.0,"I like these in red and gray/blue... wish they would get that color back in stock. Great alternative color option though. Light, polarized and comfortable"
5.0,My dad was over the moon for this hat!  He wears it as his &#34;dressy&#34; hat.  He's so proud to display his affiliation with the USS Ticonderoga  :)
5.0,"It's very soft and comfortable, but it runs very big. I bought a size 12 for my daughter who normally wears a 12, and it was huge. I decided to save that one for the future and went back to buy a size 8, which fits perfectly."
5.0,"Perfect!!! Got them for 28 bucks or something, came with what was needed to attach to the pedals, nothing extra required!"
5.0,Very nice and neat. Not bulky.
5.0,Comfortable and sexy! Great combo when you just want to relax and still feel good about yourself.
5.0,Useful gift
5.0,Great shirt for casual wear. The colors are clear and vibrant. Good purchase.

5.0,I love this dress so much! It's really flattering and comfortable. I'll be buying more colors for sure.
5.0,Received many compliments on this bracelet. Very happy with purchase.
5.0,"Some people think these are supposed to be worn over your head, but they're not. They're meant to be worn as in the picture.<br />And as for my review, it's warm, doesn't get in the way of my hard hat, and fits snug.<br />This is the first time I've ordered ear muffs like this, so I don't know if there are more comfortable ones out there, but I like the way these feel."
5.0,"very nice material and well made.  Had to alter neck, somewhat small."
5.0,"Really nice quality but this runs very small so order larger. Otherwise, very nice and well made."
5.0,"I love the fabric .I’m 4’11 , Size small and 114 pounds . The cleavage is a little too much for me , but I don’t know is because I’m 35 C and maybe is because of that . With high heels and accessories is perfect for a cocktail, wedding guest , a date  or any activity .Looks super elegant because the fabric. I’m so glad to have a classic black dress."
5.0,Okay! This is a cute wallet! The pockets are perfect on the inside and it is holding up very well. The colors are vibrant and fit very well together! The button on the front clicks well and seems very durable. Super happy.
5.0,"PERFECT for what I needed!<br />I needed a bag for my water aerobic gear,  This was my 3 try for getting the right size for towel, shower stuff, towel and the awkward barbell-things! This bags has a drink pocket, an outside pocket for keys and phone and it has a tab on the back to hang it on a hook, The drawstring is an easy pull to open and close."
5.0,Very pretty and looks expensive. Smaller than expected but it’s so pretty still love them.
5.0,"So warm, fits great!"
5.0,Great to use as a rashguard under Gi's<br />Holds up very well.
5.0,"Very nice for the price, really!"
5.0,"I got this band about two weeks ago.  So far it has worked out great.  It was easy to remove the links and attach to the Charge 2 screen.  If you are looking for a band that is more fashionable, look no further."
5.0,"These necklaces are super cute! They are very versatile, you can change the length which helps them go with different outfits and necklines. The packaging was great too, each necklace was individually wrapped and they all came in a cute black jewelry pouch. I would definitely recommend, so pretty!"
5.0,Perfect my husband loved it
5.0,"had to remove 2 links, watched video, fairly easy.looks great!"

5.0,Excellent experience!
5.0,"Love these, and will rebuy them"
5.0,My husband bought me this for Christmas. I love it. It is beautiful. I wear it everyday. I don’t take it off at all. Usually the chain of the necklace gets caught in my hair but this one does not at all! The pendant doesn’t move at all as well. Stays in place which I love. Recommend this

5.0,"Nice lightweight little summer dress. I bought xs ,I am 98lb's, 5 foot tall. The top part of dress was too big, I took it to a seamstress to alter it. I liked the dress to pay a few extra dollars was worth it."
5.0,My daughter is a cutie when she wears this.
5.0,Very nice looking. Very impressed
5.0,"This Flygo Women's Winter Warm Wool Plaid skirt was perfect.  It fit just right; the color (blue) was muted and beautiful and the material of this skirt was soft and warm.  NO SMELLS, NO TEARS, NO HOLES!  I wore this for a show I did and got lots of compliments on it from everyone.  I'll definitely purchase another one."
5.0,I bought this bracelet as a gift for a Friend. She loves it. It's beautiful.

5.0,Right length and very warm.
5.0,Provides great shade on the patio.
5.0,"Any cat lover would enjoy this. I got mine today. Shipping takes a while but this is disclosed upfront. I haven't removed the battery ""clip"" to enable the watch, so I might need to update this review if the battery doesn't function properly. The strap clasp is silver. It's nice that the strap doesn't have links, so you don't have to remove links to adjust it to your size. The watch face is 1.5 inches across, horizontally, including the knob. The watch face thickness is approximately 6/16 or 3/8. It would fit wrists between 6.5 to 7.75 inches (by measuring from the clasp to the band holes). The photograph is an accurate depiction of the watch."
5.0,"Love these slippers, high quality. Soft wool, does run a but small. I’m a 7.5 in womens and purchased the 8, fits me barely. Recommend sizing up. Def would purchase again."
5.0,Runs small and sleeves are fitted. NOT like picture shows. My daughter wore this on her weddin day.
5.0,I bought this watch on impulse. As a UGA grad I thought it would be fun. It turns out that the watch is so comfortable with a high quality band that I wear it almost every day. I've even been passing over my solar watches from Seiko and Citizen to wear this Timex. I like the understated retro look; and of course the Power G! It's not gaudy like some of the other college watches.
5.0,Strong and duro
5.0,"It fit so well wore to my niece’s wedding, I received many compliments!"
5.0,This is one of my new favorites. Fabric is soft. Great fit.
5.0,Extremely comfortable and the look is stylish.
5.0,"Captain Jean Luc Picard is happy with it! Awesome quality, perfect for a Star Trek fan!"
5.0,I used this when I went to Greece and it had enough room inside for all of my beach necessities and more.
5.0,Calming colors and a beautiful bag. I use these from transporting supplies to just having it around gor throwing my purse in it.:)
5.0,Bought for a gift and they loved it~!
5.0,"Soft, beautiful. Unfortunately should of gotten 3xl, for more boon room"
5.0,It's a great jacket! I love the fabric! The fabric has a nice thickness to it. I may purchase another. I would recommend buying it.
5.0,Worth. Every. Penny.
5.0,"I loved it sooo mush that I'm considering buying it in other colors. Infact, my mom even ordered one in black.I was a little worried about the length, as  I'm only 5'1 and wanted to wear flat sandals like the model, so after reading the reviews that it was wearable for my height, I took a chance and am soooo happy I did. The fabric is soft and a of a good weight. It will be great for traveling on long flights. As others have mentioned, it does fit large. I am curvy with large breast and butt and normally wear a 10-12 ordered a medium, but could have definitely gotten a small. Regardless, it hangs beautifully despite being a little big, but the next one I purchase will be a size small."
5.0,"The reason I first bought these earrings was for my secret Santa gift. I never realize how beautiful it was until I received it through the mail, and let me tell you how satisfied with how fast the delivery was to my home. When my secret Santa received her gift her eyes opened real big and she truly was blessed with the beauty of this jewelry. The Quality and the product it self was just magnificent. I for sure will continue to shop on amazon"
5.0,It was a nice gift to a retiring Senior Chief
5.0,Works better then the originals.

5.0,Dress is perfect light weight flattering I’m very comfortable
5.0,I love them they look so beautiful<br />I asked if they had a size 9 and 9.5 cuz i wanted to get a ring for my dad since they say jade is good for health and they help me out so nicely I would totally order from them again
5.0,It's a very pretty piece.
5.0,Adorable and very useful! Love it! It was smaller that I thought it would be (I didn't look at the dimensions) but I still love it regardless!
5.0,Love this and it’s perfect for Face protection
5.0,I ordered a med for a little extra room. The dress is cute. Cant wait to wear it with my little girl!

5.0,"Lovely dress, the colour is vibrant and beautiful and the material is nice and thick. Love it."
5.0,"You might be thinking, “wow, what a great looking pen case.” But you would be wrong. This is, in fact, a cat bed. The most expensive cat bed I have ever owned. There used to be pens in it, and it was perfect for organizing my most used pens, planner stickers, and highlighters. The quality is wonderful and I haven’t had a single issue.. other than my cat stealing it from me every chance she gets."
5.0,Loved the color really good material and fit like a dream I wore it to a wedding got many compliments. Was definitely worth the purchase.
5.0,"Ordered as a gift, my brother loves it"
5.0,The item was just what I was looking for looks and fits great
5.0,Item exactly as described and arrived on time!
5.0,THE BEARPAW MENS GRAYSON SLIPPERS  IS SOOOOOOO COMFORTABLE  FOR MY FEET!!!
5.0,"This bag is very well done, it has a lot of pockets and when not in use it collapse in a very small bundle."
5.0,Love this just go a size up...when you first wear this take it on and off the first week or until you get use to wearing it all day
5.0,Went a size up and still a little snug but the quality is amazing.
5.0,Beautiful earrings. Glad I got them....
5.0,The photo does this dress no justice. I was actually pleasantly surprised and please with the quality and color or this dress.
5.0,I bought this just to have something to throw on. I get lots of compliments on it and am buying a couple of more dresses. Satisfied.
5.0,Very nice watch for the price. The watch is stylish  looks like a much more expensive watch. I own other styles of their watches as well and all of them have kept time accurately.  It's a lot of watch for the money.
5.0,I bought these shoes for my husband for the second year. My only disappointment is that they only come in one color. Create another color so I can buy him 2 pairs😊
5.0,"Wonderful tie! I ordered the green and black. Exactly as pictured and it both ties and hangs nicely. May pick up a few other colours in the future, although I thought this one the most striking."
5.0,"Good mask easy to breath. Sleek look! Fresh smell, huge plus!!! I personally like the cut outs for the ear. Specially when am at the gym Easy for people to telI I have ear buds in. Great mask to work out in.....so I won’t have to wear the one I wear normally to a store.  It stays nice and cool too.."
5.0,Arrived quickly and is absolutely beautiful. Has a nice shine and comes with a polishing rag for the necklace.
5.0,Love this!!  We use use it haul firewood from the porch to insude by the fireplace .  Cuts down on the mess!
5.0,I've bought several brands of compression socks to wear while flying or being on my feet all day. These are by far my favorite! They fit well and they stay up.
5.0,Beautiful accessory to sweaters or shirts. Shiny and sparkles just subtly but strongly enough.
5.0,"I bought this for my daughter’s Halloween costume. It was the perfect accessory to add a finishing touch! Fit well, good quality."
5.0,I bought this pack for my family to use with their masks. Everyone loves them. They are great if you don’t want to lose track of your mask and don’t want to place your mask down on a table or something.
5.0,"Fits perfect, love the colors"
5.0,This was prefect for Father's day. My daughter chose it for her dad. Good thick quality.
5.0,"I love this skirt.  Pockets, elastic waist, affordable, nice fit. No complaints."
5.0,Shirt looks great but the pic is not exactly what you get. There are multiple girls in different poses on it which isn't a problem for me. Buy a size larger than usual. It is 100% cotton and will shrink. I baught mine one size larger (XL) and it fits like a large after washing.
5.0,Perfect lil bracelet. Love it.
5.0,"Bigger than what i thought it would be, very good quality and looks better than the pictures!"
5.0,"The padding is great, it sits at all of the right places.  I also like that the waistband isn’t super tight so there’s nothing to dig into you when you’re moving in and out of the saddle and breathing hard."
5.0,Love these pants. Fit like a glove!
5.0,"I switch this band out for special occassions (formal dinners, weddings) and recieve a lot of compliments. It dresses the watch up and is easy to swap out. The only downside is the pins come out completely, so I have lost a few along the way and had to order a whole new band to get more pins. So keep the pins in a safe place! The button to adjust is easy to use but it does help to have someone assist you with tightening it."
5.0,I love these tank tops. So comfortable!
5.0,"Took a while to get here, but the mask itself is great. Light and comfortable, my son wears it all day long at school. He loves the design."
5.0,Very impressive and unique for sure.  Do not buy this unless you are a confident and bold person.  I love it. Love adding it to my collection of watches. But this watch is not for everyone.  It's big and bold so it will fit perfectly on the person who is the same way.
5.0,"I got these slippers for my 13-year-old daughter to wear at home, and to take to sleep-away camp. From the product description, I had a feeling they would be cute. When they arrived, yes -- they are cute. But they are also rather huge! It really is like wearing two stuffed animals on your feet. My daughter says they are comfortable and soft. They are nicely padded on the bottoms and the sides. Because they are so huge, the feet kind of knock together, so they are not great for running and playing, and might be a bit of a hazard going up and down stairs. If you're looking for slippers that are cute, warm, well-padded, and fun, this is a good option. I recommend them."
5.0,Love love love love.... so comfortable. Love the material. I'm not even going to lie I bought these to pass off a slacks and wear to work... best purchase ever
5.0,This is a beautifully well-made handcrafted piece. I immediately felt its energy and the love instilled into it from the artist. I highly recommend! Fits nicely in my hand and totally enjoy the scrolled vine down towards the tip as I point as if SHAZAM!!! Absolutely happy. This will be an adored and treasured heirloom piece.
5.0,"I wore this for my tea party bridal shower.  It was well made and the clips held well in my natural hair.  I did have to fold it under and put a weight on top of it to shape the mesh in the way that I desired, but that was a personal preference.  I would recommend this."
5.0,"Super cute!! I was a little doubtful when I got these what they would look like in person...but they look just like the picture shows! I think that these are comfortable to wear, and very fashion forward! They are a little on the edgier side, in my opinion, so I don't think that I will be wearing them on an every day basis, but they do remind me of Kendra Scott's stuff, which I like. Super cute, and very glad I got this!!<br /><br />I did receive this for a discounted price to give an honest and unbiased review, which I was not paid for. All thoughts provided are my own. I give ratings based on what I believe a product is valued at, and not what the seller wants me to put. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission 16 CFR Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsement and Testimonials in Advertising."
5.0,Most breathable gaiter I've found yet. I do wish it were an inch wider as it clings to the face pretty close.
5.0,I liked the color and fit.
5.0,"The colors are awesome.  They are like the old school headbands, very thick.  They are great at soaking up sweat during my workout."
5.0,"Not only is it cute, it's comfortable and washes well."
5.0,Looks pretty cool!
5.0,"Bought for my mother for mother's day. She loves to dress in red, white and blue.  She has worn it the last two days!"
5.0,Perfect! Thank you.
5.0,Quality material. Great price looked very elegant on my daughter. She received tons of compliments on this dress.
5.0,The product arrived on time. Quality was just like shown. It's a gift for the daughter. She was grandmas girl and the stone resembles February stone plus it has angel wings. She will love it
5.0,These are great. The way they are packaged it’s like opening up a beautifully wrapped gift.
5.0,"my friend needed to get his wallet out of his back pocket, and this one is perfect for carrying in front pockets. It is slim enough to not weigh down the pocket and everything is conveniently placed. He loves it!"
5.0,Received exactly what was described ... quick delivery.
5.0,These are warmer and better wearing than the more expensive Kamiks they replaced.
5.0,Love it.  Good quality leather bag. Have five Heshe bags and never disappointed. The pink colour is just outstanding.
5.0,"XS - fit just fine, I'm 5'3"" and 124lbs.  It came with a full facemask, just simple Black Panther costume, very happy with the purchase especially for the price.  I accessorize with a pair of claw gloves to complete the costume."
5.0,Got them for a festival! Very cute and came with a soft shell case and a harder shell case.
5.0,Really great quality!
5.0,"Great multi use piece, especially for traveling. I get compliments every time I wear one -- I have three of these!"
5.0,This is a beautiful and simply elegant necklace. Obviously I bought it for the conversational message “Carpe Diem”and it does the trick as a banner piece to break the ice when meeting new people. Be prepared to explain what it means to a lot of people when you go out adorned with it which most certainly is the primary fun in wearing it!
5.0,Great hat. Just as expected.
5.0,My mom wears this charm everyday. She said it whad the most thoughtful goft she has ever gotten. Fits her pandora bracelet perfectly.
5.0,"This spray works very well to keep your glasses from fogging up when you are wearing PPE, like a mask. Just spray it on both sides of your lenses, wait a few seconds, and then wipe it off with the supplied cloth. The bottle is small, so you can keep it with you, or it takes up little space in the glove box of your car. I am not sure how long a single application lasts, but I have used it to go grocery shopping, and it lasts at least a couple of hours. It is completely odor free as well."
5.0,"It’s very comfortable and flattering, and it has pockets. I got a lot of compliments when wearing it."
5.0,The bracelet is really nice. Just like on the pictures and good price
5.0,Love it!! I bought this for an Easter outfit and the material is super comfy. Colorful and cute. Would definitely purchase again
5.0,"I bought this hat for my 12 year old nephew's birthday. He pretty much never takes it off ... which is pretty damn cool to see as an aunt. Apparently I made a good decision in this hat. It's pretty high quality ... it's still holding up despite the fact that he literally wears it nonstop and does all the preteen boy things like roughhousing with other kids and stuff. It's a little dirty, but still holding up. Thanks for making me the &#34;Cool Aunt.&#34; hahaha."
5.0,"I have severe neuropathy  and narrow feet.  With the velcro straps on both sides of the slipper , I can pull them to fit properly to my feet, also the sole and inner sole furnished makes my feet feel very comfortable."
5.0,"It is PERFECT!!  I love your jewelry, packaging and company!"
5.0,"Love Eric Javits, best bag on Market.  Using only this brand right now!"
5.0,"I don't consider myself as having a big head but it isn't small either. It fit perfectly and I got the largest offered. It looks OK on I guess but I bought it for practicality, not looks."
5.0,Great for kids leaving glasses everywhere
5.0,"I love this ballet shirt!  It's perfect to wear over my leotard on my way to class, or with leggings and comfy boots running errands."
5.0,Very nice shirt but fitted and a little small
5.0,"Was not sure if this would work after reading some reviews.  But to my surprise they are excellent and very comfortable. Yes they are easy to get on, so you don't think they are 20-30, but surprisingly enough they tighten around my swollen ankle and legs reducing the swelling. All day comfort and long for a tall person. Long enough to reach my knees and not leave indentations from being to tight. Compared to other brands that I have and like. Highly recommended so I purchased too more.<br />Update: I now have 5 pairs of Go2Socks. I found them very comfortable and very helpful with the swelling after a trip to Colorado by car. Two day to Colorado, 10 hrs each day. Two days back home, 40hrs total on the road. No breaks or sores between toes or feet and best of all no infections. For me the best choice in compression socks."
5.0,I just received my new band. It's even better quality than I expected. It wasn't difficult to remove the necessary links using the provided tool. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone!
5.0,"Perfect pool bag - durable, lots of space and pockets"
5.0,"Great shirt, wore it in the hot Mexico sun. Washed it when I came back and it still looks good."
5.0,"Comfy, cute and warm. I like the softer, knit covered headband that doesn't dig into my scalp like some do. It's past Christmas and I still wear them, reindeer design and all. I also purchased a second pair, with the snowflake design."
5.0,I bought these to use in my shower to eliminate the slipping that caused a fall.  They are really good for that purpose however there is very little arch support so I’m not sure if they would be comfortable for daily use...however as a shower sandal I really like them...no slip!
5.0,"Fun and funky!  Sold at an amazing discount.<br /><br />SAS shoes are the best shoes I've ever owned, and they keep me going!"
5.0,This is so beautiful and perfect
5.0,"Great for the price. It is NOT a no-iron shirt, so plan on ironing it or take to cleaners."
5.0,These are great socks. Well made and the toes help my feet stay warm when wearing flip flops to the gym.
5.0,A nice lightweight knit top.
5.0,Daughter loves it. Soft and cute. Love the hood too.
5.0,Beautiful bracelet. Size works for average and large wrists. Love the natural coloring. Ready to buy more jade jewelry because of my satisfaction with this purchase.
5.0,"Everything about it was perfect!! True to size, correct color. Can't wait to wear it this summer!"
5.0,This was a gift and worked out perfect. The t-shirt quality is very good and the picture was very funny.
5.0,"Me queda muy elegante y cubre bien las partes íntimas, ósea no es clarito, cubre muy bien 👍🏻"
5.0,Bought it for my aunt. Loved the color.
5.0,"Sooo cute, it’s my boyfriends favorite sleep set!"
5.0,"Bought a pack for my 3 yr old a few months ago, and went back to buy a second back.  She loves mixing and matching the animals, and they fit great!  She's toddler size 8-9 shoe, and we got the Medium size socks."
5.0,Extremely small for any kind of picture
5.0,"As with most Free People apparel, I sized down from a small to a XS. These pants fit perfectly. I live in FL and these pants are lined, so may not be able to wear them in the summer. But they are extremely comfortable and will definitely be replacing an old pair of vic. secret sweatpants. They are great for lounging but you can certainly dress them up."
5.0,I love this shirt! So cute and light weight
5.0,Awesome bras love the fit
5.0,"Exactly as advertised. Bit big and bulky, but looks good."
5.0,Perfect for hot summer! My doughter loves it!
5.0,They look absolutely beautiful! The design of metal all around makes them sturdy and not catching on clothes. I use them for my back dimples.
5.0,"Fits pretty well, looks quite sexy. Perfect for curvy women."
5.0,Comfy socks that went over my ankles a few inches. I was hoping they would be longer but the colors are so pretty and felt good in my hiking boots.
5.0,"Me parece muy bien para el precio, y rente otras cosas; me gusta que no tiene el resorte por fuera, ya que los otros suelen deshilarse, son de buena calidad."
5.0,"I prefer these to the new synthetic boots. They are comparable to the old F50s at a much better price. They are extremely comfortable. the orange ones are crazy bright, they look good."
5.0,Fit perfect to my Fitbit Altra. It came with a tool to remove links.  Very easy to do. It also came fairly quickly.
5.0,Such a classy looking shirt. Love it. Looks so much better than the picture. Easy wash and stays wrinkle free. I get tons of compliments on this shirt. You will love it.
5.0,"It's a plain dress but easy to dress up!  With it, I wore a black cinch belt (with gold clasp), and a red necklace, both purchased on amazon.  Also paired some red heels that I already owned.  It's soft and comfortable.  I ordered a L and it came to my knees.  (5'6&quot;, 165, M shirt, 10 pant, small bust.)"
5.0,Great fit. Just the right amount of stretch. Very comfortable. Wash and hang comes out perfect.
5.0,I have really tiny wrists that I had to buy a little girls watch instead of a women's  watch.  I still had to have holes drilled to make it tighter so it would stay in place.  Pretty watch and fits me better than most.
5.0,My niece wear this on her bracelet and it hasn’t changed color and looks just like the photo
5.0,I wear S size usually. But ordered M to fill more comfy and relaxed. It's warm and the hood is thick. I like it.
5.0,"These were great post shoulder surgery. First week with swelling only snapped them up to stay on and not be exposed. Snap them up completely now, never have to lift surgical arm. Can even get dressed without removing sling, top snaps give doc access to dressings and wound w/o undressing and material very soft and stretchy. I'm 5'8"" and weigh 280. The 3x fit great."
5.0,"I love the design of this socks. I get a lot of compliments from my coworkers. Aside from the design, its compression helps me to last the whole shift without my legs/calf getting too tired. After experiencing these socks, i never wear ordinary socks during my 12hr shifts anymore. Compression socks is the way to go."
5.0,"For those of us who use insulin pumps and wear skirts/dresses, this is a must buy! I have been on the hunt for a solution to my problems with wearing a skirt or dress with a pump. These shorts fit the bill!!!<br /><br />My criteria-<br />Effective for chub rub shorts<br />Pockets on both sides<br />Doesn't interrupt with silhouette in dresses/skirts<br />Isn't pantyhose/synthetic feeling and super hot<br />Pump doesn't weigh it down<br /><br />The only thing I would change about these would be to make them high waisted because I prefer that, but not a huge deal because they are awesome in all the other places.<br /><br />Seriously,  if you wear an insulin pump and dresses/skirts, buy these."
5.0,They are very comfy but provide no ankle or arch support.  If needed you could add arch supports.  I wore all day on uneven terrain and walks with no problem.
5.0,Ordered a med was a bit bigger than expected and very light weight as well. Love the sweat shirt but very pricey for the lightness of the fabric. Washes well and dosent stretch out . Is good for a light cover up.
5.0,"Just as described, and perfect for my purpose."
5.0,"I love wearing toe socks with flip flops in the winter or when I'm cold in the warmer months of the year. They are so comfortable even in a pair of tennis shoes. Why aren't there more toe sock out there? My toes are kind of gapped so I love that my toes don't feel confined in the conventional pair of socks.<br /><br />Good price, fast shipping, great product."
5.0,"Easy summer dress, nice length very stylish!"
5.0,This is just perfect for my grand-daughters Elf on a shelf she loves it!
5.0,It is a gift for my nephew he lives in another country. But I am sure he will love them. I tried them on me and really isolate the noise I am sure it will help him.  Thanks for this great product.
5.0,"Gorgeous watch, received a lot of compliments about it! Wish there was a shorter band size because I have tiny wrists but I just keep it a couple inches from my wrist and it stays put for a whole day of moving around."
5.0,"This dress is a perfect fit; it is so comfortable! The fabric falls nicely, and the color is beautiful!"
5.0,I love the material. It's very soft and has some stretch.
5.0,These are great earrings and I can hardly tell I have them in they are so lightweight. They are colorful and each come with clear backs to keep them secure. They all arrived individually packaged inside a jewelry bag.
5.0,"Me encanta ,"
5.0,"Excellent quality! I would definitely buy these again! They were perfect for a first-birthday shoot, and they're also perfect for use with adult outfits."
5.0,"These are the perfect size for my upper holes, hugging my ear.  I love how easy they were to put in, unlike other types of endless loops."
5.0,This is a beautiful item.  It fits as shown in picture and is quality item.  I LOVE IT!!
5.0,"I love this nightgown. It's very pretty, the fabric is soft and light, cool and comfortable. The way the top rests on the chest sort of creates a billowing effect so that it is modest in regards to showing the chest and any concerns about middle-aged bellies. I've bought two now.  And the embroidery details are very pretty"
5.0,very comfortable and the red shade complements some outfits
5.0,very cute and the perfect size for carrying as an everyday purse- the straps fit under the shoulder and the inside decoration is very chic
5.0,"I ordered the black pair in a size Large. I am usually a Large in bottoms and assumed these would follow suit. When they arrived (rather quickly) I noticed right away that I would not be able to wear the original pair I ordered. I did try them on and immediately felt how soft and stretchy they are! They have a little key pocket inside the normal pocket, which I thought was clever. Overall I feel these are great quality. My only complaint is how small they run. So, be aware of that when ordering for yourself!"
5.0,"Item as pictured. Well packaged. Shipped from Amazon warehouse. Arrived earlier than expected. Adorable, roomy, very sturdy construction with nicely finished seams. Has a fat brass zipper. Inside is a slouchy pocket and a zippered pocket. The zippered pocket is smooth and well placed. Purse has satiny interior lining. Detachable shoulder strap is very adjustable. Worth every penny and more. Smells like new car."
5.0,My husband loves this hat!!!
5.0,out of all the ones i looked at this one had 3 for them for only a dollar or 2 more than all the single ones. very well made product so far. ive had no issues yet and im happy with them
5.0,This is a beautiful infinity scarf made from very nice material.
5.0,"I have loved wearing this, and changing out for different bottoms.  Doesn't look like a swim top, so it can go from beach to outing by adding a cute skirt or shorts.  Love it!"
5.0,"Speedy delivery, good quality, and pretty colors. A variety of solid colors and designs. I asked for a set for Christmas and have ordered 4 more since. You just can't beat this price."
5.0,"Love this band. Fits my atyle better than the rubber ones. Only downside is swapping the band to this, but that's just because the tiny pins the Galaxy Active 2 requires--not the issue of the manufacturer of this band."
5.0,Loves these earrings! Highly recommend! Great quality and I have extremely sensitive ears and they have not turned green. I love them! Great value for price!
5.0,This is a bit smaller than expected. It will still fit the baby but not for as long as I was hoping for.
5.0,"Really cool, very clean. Packaged well"
5.0,"God. I LOVE this dress. Seriously. It is absolutely beautiful, fits comfortably (I did get a size bigger than I usually would)  AND it is long enough!!! I NEVER get to say that last part. I'm 6' tall, most dresses (especially dresses from Amazon) always fall right above my ankles. Not this dress! It was actually a tinny bit too long for me, so I even had the option of wearing heals! I can't say enough positives about this dress, it definitely is well worth the money-I'm planning on buying one in every color because I'm so happy with it."
5.0,Great guy and great cover. It is very high quality and gives great protection and protection to my steering wheel. Very comfortable to hold.
5.0,Super love it!
5.0,I love the material and stretch
5.0,The umbrella opens to give shade to almost our whole deck. I couldn’t be more pleased.
5.0,Great Quality.  Love it!
5.0,"It's simple and light. Nothing spectacular, but works very well. I have always hating wearing watches but this is so light and small it seems to disappear on my wrist."
5.0,Excellent quality...strong clutch pin...I am proud to wear it.
5.0,I purchased this for my daughter and it looks super cool and it fits to her FitBit very well and also received on-time.<br />I am glad I purchased this and my daughter is happy with look and it fits perfect. 5 star !
5.0,The necklace was perfect for a young girl.  She loved it!  The quality is beautiful and it comes in a beautiful gift box.
5.0,"I wore the top with a different bottom but the shorts fit great too! I was surprised this fit so well and the quality really is decent, especially for the price! Just get a size up, normally a medium but considering the price, I went up to a large and it fit perfectly."
5.0,"I was hoping for a bigger Ganesha, but it’s really cute and I been wearing it for the last month. 🎋"
5.0,"[[ASIN:B01GZGPTA8 Pop Fashion - Silver Braided Twisted Bracelet - Designer Inspired Cuff Bangle - Amazon Prime]]<br /><br />This is such a lovely, well-made, and versatile bracelet. It is heavy, without being too heavy. I have worn it dressed up to work and with jeans when kicking around town - it goes with pretty much everything. The quality is what I would expect at a much higher price point. It has kept its shine through multiple wearings and none of the plating has come off. I've had no issue with it turning my skin green.  I'm not the only one who likes it - my daughter keeps &quot;borrowing&quot; it. I may have to buy another one so we don't have to argue over who's turn it is to wear the bracelet.<br /><br />I disclose that I received a discount on this item for review. I am not affiliated with the seller or manufacturer."
5.0,This was a gift for my granddaughter who is heading to Disneyland so she was thrilled with the shirts.
5.0,"I am 5'1 135lbs,wears small or size 6.I bought large in this coat that fits below my hips, l can also wear a sweater under and not look bulky.the buckle on the belt is also cute,the color is exactly what it shows I pair my coat with a autumn winter olive green boots I bought from &#34; happy &#34; on Amazon there chic together."
5.0,Saw them in Vegas for $700 bucks. Good thing I waited. I love them.
5.0,"Yep, this dress has everything:<br />-comfortable stretch fabric<br />-perfect length for anywhere, including the office<br />-flattering easy-going fit<br />-has pockets<br />The only thing to watch out for is color fading in the wash. I recommend using wall light and not washing it too often, since I’ve noticed similar fabrics fade. Excellent all around—see pics!"
5.0,"Good value, fits really well, good product"
5.0,"Well made, fits and does not slip off my foot in my shoe. What more could you ask for in a sock. After my first purchase, I bought 3 more packages."
5.0,I love this watch!! I've been a fan of Marilyn Monroe ever since i was a child. The item came packaged very secure and on time.<br />I would buy from this seller again.
5.0,"I'm pregnant and didn't want to spend too much on maternity wear. If possible, I wanted garments that would work during and after pregnancy. The fit, the comfort and the look were perfect. It'll be loose and breezy after childbirth which I'll love. Absolutely love it!"
5.0,These lens fit exactly like they should.
5.0,Lifetime warranty and one hell of a backpack!
5.0,The robe is exactly as described. It fits perfectly and is warm and cozy.
5.0,Lovely earrings. Very modern looking
5.0,I love these glasses  and sad that I can no longer order them. I keep trying to find some I like as well with no luck.
5.0,I am very impressed by the quality of these t-shirts. They are super soft and very comfortable to wear. The process from picking out your style to getting measured was incredibly easy and took minutes to complete. Even with ordering a week before Christmas I received my new custom shirt in less than 5 days. I found the fit to be very accurate. Overall I am really glad that I ordered this and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes t-shirts.
5.0,i just love it
5.0,Love this dress. Very comfy and super cute
5.0,I ordered the black and white necklace for a formal affair.  The quality was very good and it looked amazing!
5.0,It's great and they are perfect frames.
5.0,"Hi There. Mine arrived today. I’m thrilled w it. YOU WILL FIND IT CLEARER AND EASIER TO SEE THROUGH IF YOU REMOVE THE INNER FILM. Carefully, Gently on inside of visor, at one top corner, use your fingernail or a pin to lift top corner of film and gently pull. It will peel off in one piece!!"
5.0,Beautiful dress! I'm so in love with it 😍 I'm short so I had to get about 6 inches cut off. Fits perfect I got my size I wear in tops.
5.0,Love this dress! Love that it has pockets! It’s super cute! I’m 5’9” and it’s the perfect length for me!
5.0,Nice & warm...just what I wanted!
5.0,"Fits great, feels great, washes great, looks great. Solid purchase."
5.0,This comes in handy when you have a lot of patchwork sewing or intricate pieced sewing. I also like the multi functional aspect of the opposite end where you can use the flat part of the wood to “finger press” a seam.
5.0,These look like expensive jewelry. I love them!
5.0,Gorgeous bag.  Leather is top quality.  Great size and color beautiful.  I have purchased more for gifts.
5.0,"Perfect! I used them every day during a 5 day hiking and trecking trip. They provide full movility, specially when climbing. I liked that they did not limit my movility as other pants have done before. I was skeptical when buying them because of their low price compared to others sold by famous brands such as The Northface. I am really glad to have given them the chance because they turned out to be fantastic. Just what I was looking for!<br />Highly recommended!<br />I'm a size 8/10 and the Medium fit perfectly well. Even when using warmers underneath they still have space to make you feel comfortable."
5.0,"As described, just a little smaller than I thought they would be.  Cannot use as I discovered I cannot hold the back to put on due to arthritis.  Have passed on to someone who loves them."
5.0,"The material is soft and somewhat stretchy which I think is accommodating for most body figures. Overall I think it's a decent dress for various occasions, quite classy for a brunch."
5.0,Love this long cardigan. Although I usually associate “cardigans” as being some kind of wool. The fabric is light and the fit is true to size. Very pretty !
5.0,"After ordering an inferior belt here on Amazon, which broke after only a couple of weeks of use, I found this belt.  I must say, I was a little daunted by the idea of possibly having to trim the belt and/or add more holes myself, but after reading other reviews, I thought it would be worth a try.  I am certainly glad that I did.  The leather is softer and more pliable out of the box than many belts I have previously owned, and the fit is actually quite good as received.  I ordered the 39-44&#34; belt (I currently have a 40&#34;-42&#34; waist, depending on the pants).<br /><br />When this one wears out, I will certainly buy another of these!"
5.0,Perfect sandals for kids that want to live in them. Great fit and the comfort is perfect. I recommend them to all my friends for their kids.
5.0,Cute  summer slippers
5.0,Awesome shirt. Definitely lightweight and oversized!
5.0,I get more compliments on this ring.  Even at the jewelry store!
5.0,"So easy to put on, they look so glamorous!  Good quality."
5.0,Love it thanks! Wife loves seeing me in it!
5.0,"I purchased this to go with a matching pink tutu, for my toddler granddaughter. Although she hasn’t worn it yet, she loves it — especially because the girl bunny, on the front of this top, is wearing a pink tutu, like my granddaughter will be wearing on Good Friday, to preschool. As my granddaughter is tall for her age (She’s 3-1/2 years old.), I ordered a size 5T, and it fits her perfectly. Thank you."
5.0,Another win from PattyBoutik! Feels sexy without feeling like your showing too much. Love it
5.0,A small petite woman may e able to fit this . Definitely not a 5'4/short torso woman. The colors are as pictured. The word MIAMI is on the back. I hope I can find an adult size  as this !
5.0,I love the elegant simplicity of this watch.  I love wearing it and the colors are great.
5.0,This swimsuit definitely runs on the small side but it looks so cute!  The seashell cups and pearl halter make me feel like a mermaid! Looks just like the picture but order a size up just in case.
5.0,"Fit a little tight, but nothing that won't loosen up after a few more times wearing them. Be warned though, they do come pretty long and you may need to hem. I just wish I knew why they show as ""currently unavailable"" from Kingsize, but when you click on more buying options they show as being available from Kingsize at more than twice the price? The same has been occurring with many other Kingsize products on here? Hmmm?"
5.0,Bought these for a family trip to Disney World. They not only fit but dont look ridiculous on my 7 year old all the way up to my husband. AND! They're priced in such a way that it was no big deal if they got lost or broken.
5.0,I have a super small waist. So I was scared hat these would be too big. They surprisingly aren't and there's so many neutral colors. You can match these with any outfit. I love them!
5.0,"I don't like sunglasses that fit too tightly on the sides of my head (which a lot seem to do), so these oversized glasses are great.  The padding is a nice feature when riding."
5.0,great anklet.  the hearts are pretty big and stand out well.
5.0,I like the material though it’s a little bit long
5.0,love these.  very festive for the holidays
5.0,Really lovely bracelet. I got two for my teenaged nephew and his girl.
5.0,Love this retro Nike shoes!!!
5.0,I have a 2xl head and thick hair.  I need hats that are a little larger than most every hat available.  This hat fits and fits nicely.  I also like the visor being a little longer than most. I just bought 3 more for a total of four.
5.0,"These were displayed in the product line silver clip on earrings in my Amazon search & nowhere in the description nor photo was the product noted or shown as post earrings.  Therefore I had to reorder a pair of silver clip on earrings for a Christmas gift.  These earrings are lovely, nice quality but not what I wanted."
5.0,"Love this shirt, will probably order another color, esp. love that if you hang it, the wrinkles fall out!"
5.0,Good fit and nice looking.
5.0,Suit fit nicely and was easy to put on.  I normally wear size 14 but purchased an XL.  It was not tight around the legs
5.0,I love these and have been adding to my collection. They are good quality and adorable detail.
5.0,Love it!  Perfect for the beach!!  This is the 2nd bag I bought from Basic Fashion.  Quality and price can't be best!
5.0,I love the way the cap feels and fit.
5.0,Giving them for Christmas..
5.0,"Works very well, thanks"
5.0,Use chart to decide your size. Chart is right on
5.0,Lands End always makes their clothes fit exactly to size. Love buying from them.
5.0,Cute for your Harry Potter fan
5.0,"I sized down one size after reading the reviews and it was still a little big. Loose fitting, goes great with tights and boots. It's pretty short. I am 5'8&#34; and not sure I would wear it without something underneath. But overall I really like this dress."
5.0,Awesome gift idea! Speedy delivery!!!
5.0,"The funny part is I was prompted to rate this wallet on whether it provided good arch support. I said &#34;yes,&#34; because it's so small. :) This is a great standard wallet for people with less needs for multiple credit cards and change. It's real leather, but the leather seems so tight and non-porous, it seems fake. Which is fine, but unexpected."
5.0,These are great boots.  Comfortable.  Warm as can be even in the below zero temperatures we have been experiencing in the northeast. I would definitely buy them again.
5.0,"This dress is Amazing. The dress is definitely made to last. The dress is very heavy which is awesome. It doesn’t feel like a costume at all. It feels like your wearing a ball gown. I would recommend going down a size. According to the size chart I would have been a 2xl but after reading reviews about it running large I’m glad I bought the XL instead. The 2XL would’ve been way too big. For reference I am 5’4 1/2 and have a 47 inch chest and a 36 inch waist. I tried the dress on without a corset or bra but if I wanted to I would’ve had room to do so. If you are wearing the dress in the summer heat it will be very warm but in fall and winter it will keep you cozy from the weight of it. To get the nice full effect of the dress you will definitely need to buy a crinoline. I can’t express how wonderful this dress is. The quality is superb, it went above and beyond my expectations. I feel like you could have this dress for many many years. The first photo shown is with flash and the second is without flash. Honestly the dress made me feel like a gothic princess. It is totally worth the buy and for the price you can’t get better. I’ve spent way more money on my renfair outfit and it wasn’t as detailed as this dress. I can’t wait to wear this for Halloween. If you’re on the fence take the plunge and buy this dress! You will not regret it!"
5.0,"Nice bed jacket, it will be nice to use in the hospital."
5.0,"As someone who was in desperate need of a light meter without going bankrupt with the more premium models, this is a nice solution.  It has all the features and settings I need in a light meter and it comes with a nice case and lanyard.  Having to add a lumidisc could be a bit tiresome and annoying but it's really not that big of a deal."
5.0,Totally recommend this for all your makeup needs. I have organized everything and it’s so much easier to get ready when all i do is give it a little spin to get to my makeup. All my bottles fit and shelves are adjustable.
5.0,I thought the material was extremely light in weight but I can’t really review it because they were a gift for my grandson
5.0,Sheer top true to size and very boho. I get compliments every time I wear it and the colors are very vibrant and pretty. It’s well made and really affordable. I have purchased quite a few items from this brand and they wash and wear well.
5.0,Love these pajama pants.  They are my new favorites!
5.0,"Love it, fits and feels good for the price"
5.0,Fits well. Nice and light material. Just what I was looking for
5.0,These are really great - excellent stretch and very thick.
5.0,"The ring setting is bigger than I anticipated but the quality and shine is amazing. I wanted to use this as a joint ring so I love that it's adjustable. It's very comfortable to wear and I get a lot of compliments on it. The image on the setting is very precise, the blacked out part is perfectly detailed. (there have been times I've gotten rings where the craftsmanship has been less than adequate definitely NOT the case here)."
5.0,Isn’t too thick and isn’t too thin. I get so many compliments on it and I love it myself.
5.0,It was the perfect gift for my niece! She loved it!
5.0,"Nice socks.Does not keep the socks that warm,But, will do......"
5.0,Easy to install onto my old umbrella frame. Very nice quality.
5.0,"It is a nice piece but, sizes are smaller in other countries than they are in the USA.  What may be listed XXXL in another country would perhaps be MED in the USA.<br />I have requested a refund but, no response from seller."
5.0,Good sport tank.
5.0,I’m a size 18 and I got the xxl and it fit fine. Material is stretchy. Very pretty
5.0,"Although it took about a week for me to get my things, I'm satisfied. I actually received more than I ordered, which was surprising. I did receive 2 duplicates, but the fact that I received a few extra made up for it. Multiple colors and patterns, and I even received the Rastafarian one that a lot of people hoped for. I can also attach the rings to my long barbells without any problems. It's definitely worth buying."
5.0,Looks exactly like the original
5.0,"I really like the space inside the cases, and the latch for fastening it to my purse. It means that I can hang it on the strap of my purse, and have more room inside my purse for other things.  It keeps my glasses safe, and is a good place to store small things that would get buried in my purse."
5.0,"Love that this bracelet adjusts. It fits nicely and looks great! Casual enough to wear everyday, yet fancy enough to wear as a more formal piece too."
5.0,"Perfect postpartum leggings. Great compression, very high waisted and lifting to the booty. My favorite pair of postpartum leggings. I ordered them in both colors."
5.0,Lots of comps on this top. I llove it !
5.0,Super product.
5.0,Beautiful mask for men or women.
5.0,Really love it!  I can wash hands woth it and doesn't get dark or anything... always shinning!
5.0,Nice fabric! Nice fit! Great for the price!
5.0,I bought this for my mum's birthday gift. She loved it! The fit was great. If I wore silver I would buy one for myself!
5.0,Cute little gift for a 12 year old kpop fan!
5.0,I love my little purple bag. It just what I needed.
5.0,Perfect for my sunglasses
5.0,"Love this hoodie, I get compliments all the time!"
5.0,"Nice strap for cross  body. Nice size. Holds phone, small coin purse and keys. Nice color and very eye catching.  Nice small purse."
5.0,I play golf & it provides comfortable protection against the sun !
5.0,Even prettier than the pictures online. Arrived on time and exactly what I wanted
5.0,I get 5 or 6 jackets for my crew... goooodamned... good quality and we feel very good...<br /><br />Jacket recommanded and approuved... if you don't buy the other... i make a next order.
5.0,"I love the comfort, style & fit of these shorts"
5.0,Overall good pair of leggings.  Fit great.  Great material. Comfy.
5.0,Just simple black silicone wristbands. Works as expected.
5.0,It arrived quite fast and it’s beautiful
5.0,"This sweater is so comfortable and warm.  I live in the South and when temps get cold, I need something exactly like this.  I would definitely recommend."
5.0,It has both an awesome look and feel!
5.0,serves purpose for replacement or color upgrade at reasonable price and quick shipment
5.0,I absolutely love this purse it is a great size and beautiful color. I want this bag in more colors it is great! Definitely will buy this again.
5.0,My favorite !
5.0,"Very happy with this belt, I used it as a band around an inexpensive garden hat and it’s added just enough color to elevate the look of the hat. The belt is beautifully woven. It came in a cute drawstring pouch with a tiny handmade Guatemalan doll. This would make a nice gift."
5.0,Very colorful and fashion forward.  It is quite large and can be worn as a scarf of shawl.  Seems to be made of durable material and has proven to be of great quality so far.  I would recommend it to others.
5.0,Will be getting a 2nd even if have to buy the 3 package cause this one is way better then the other style on here  in person since I have both. I need another of the huge flag as well it's so bad ass!
5.0,Love this. Well made.
5.0,absolutely love this! has 4+ pockets for cards/ids. it is very flimsy material but i don’t mind because it’s so adorable. if you want a thick & sturdy passport holder i wouldn’t recommend for you.
5.0,Light weight and good fit
5.0,"I love this hat. It fits great, and it looks great. Don't forget to measure your head first, and compare it to their size chart."
5.0,"I really like these glasses.  They come with a nifty hard case and a soft cleaning cloth.  The quality is excellent, however there are two things to be aware of;<br />1.  If you wear your glasses towards the tip of your nose, like I do, the arms are too short for a secure fit.<br />2.  If you take your glasses on and off frequently, you'll be better served by a spring hinge.  These glasses have very well made hinges but no springs.  That causes the frame to flex every time you put them on or take them off.  These frames are made better than most but because they are thin they will flex. Because of flexing in other brands, I have lost screws and broken the arms at the hinge.  These frames are definitely made much better, but I would still be aware.<br />UPDATE: Forget about the flexing issue.  I sat on them and bent the attachment where the arm screws in.  I thought when I bent it back, it would snap off like others have.  Not these frames.  I bent them back into position and these are as good as new.  EXCELLENT FRAMES!<br />UPDATE 2: I have since sat on these glasses a few more times.  Just lucky I guess.  These frames are indestructible.  I have bent them back in shape 2 or 3 more times with no hint of breaking.  6 STARS!"
5.0,"Received neck cooling band and used it right away, really works just soak in cold water and put around neck keeps cool for quite awhile."
5.0,"When I first got the item, I loved how it came in it’s own felt bag and when I took them out, they were very pretty. I put them on and they were pretty light, not too heavy. But the quality was really nice quality of a clear resin that is great because I can wear it with any outfit!! They are beautiful! I love them! Thanks soo much! :-)"
5.0,Good times
5.0,Love this dress. fits my curves beautifully.
5.0,"great price ,,thanks for fast shipping"
5.0,Adorable and worth every penny
5.0,My go to sunglasses now! I’m a mother who is always out in nature or on the go and no matter what I need my sunglasses! This is great as I can just slap them around my wrist an not worry about them getting lost or scraped when sat down! Love love love them! Update: this is my 3rd pair I’ve bought because I love them so much! Will keep buying!
5.0,"Got this for a wedding fit perfect, got a lot of compliments on the dress. The long side makes it nice so if it cools down your not in a short dress and gives it a edgy look. Thicker material but not u comfortable."
5.0,Pretty. Nice long chain. Fits great on.
5.0,Great for my 10 yr old outfielder.  He loves them.
5.0,great feeling sneaker
5.0,Pretty solid gloves! Takes a bit longer to dry after they have gotten wet due to how many layers there are but these will keep your hands warm.
5.0,"I bought this frame for my 5 years old.<br />She really likes them and says it's very comfortable.<br />Yellow color is so cute, she's got a lot of compliments every day."
5.0,Omg I love these leggings!! Super comfortable and well made. I have bought 3 pairs. Also sizing is perfect.
5.0,My little Peppa Pig grandson loved it!!
5.0,"Great for larger glasses,my mother loves it"
5.0,These are the glasses that the Dude wears in The Big Lebowski. No knock off crap here!
5.0,Product is as described looks great on my chamber devices easily identify empty chambers.
5.0,This dress fits well. A teeny tiny snug across the chest but not so much I will not wear it. Just more snug than I prefer. It is not uncomfortable but I just have a preference for tops to be looser across the chest. I have been losing weight so hopefully that area will decrease lol.
5.0,"Much nicer than expected. They look like real gold and have a substantial weight to them; not light or cheap feeling. I think they're very classy looking. Great value. (They arrived more quickly than I expected: 15 days. But since they come from China, I imagine that the shipping time could vary quite a bit.)"
5.0,I love them and would recommend for purchase
5.0,Great fabric. Thick enough and soft. I haven't washed it yet but I hope it still looks just as good afterwards. I got plenty of compliments. I wore it to work with a black blazer and to Christmas eve dinner without a blazer.
5.0,Cute and durable. I lose sunglasses like it’s my job. I have bought two pairs so far. I love the convenience of reordering the same pair again. These go with everything and they fit cute
5.0,High quality bracelet that fits my Tissot Le Locle perfectly.  I was even able to re-use my original clasp.  Included tools were super helpful and easy to use.
5.0,"Length was perfect. Stretchy fit was super flattering. Pockets are a nice size, shape, and well positioned to flatter a woman's curves."
5.0,I bought these for my husband because he likes to wear undershirts but gets annoyed when they lose their shape. These fit nice and because they hug a bit (just slightly if you buy your size) they give a leaner look. He had me order him more.
5.0,"I wear a 14 US. Purchased an xx L.<br />I thought by buying a big size the waist might be longer.<br />This fits like an an under the breast babydoll<br /><br />Unflattering and super static material. If you rub a dryer sheet on the fabric, it helps.<br /><br />I thought the design/pattern of the greenish was cute. It really just looked terrible on my body type."
5.0,I love cats and these are just cute and fun earrings to wear with a tee shirt and jeans.
5.0,"Perfect for what I wanted, thin stretchy socks that look nice."
5.0,"My loves this ring I'm really glad I got it for him, he delivers stuff constantly picking up and moving heavy things and it's very durable!"

5.0,"Ordered these glasses for my best friend’s bachelorette party and they were as big as shown, fit every face shape, and were so much to take photos in. Best value ever."
5.0,Pretty and sturdy.  Lots of room for cards.  Usuallybuy french wallets for the space.  This walletis a good replacement.
5.0,"Love the Greek Alphabet letter for Lambda. It is a great way to wear who I really am. It is durable. I have it on a particular bracelet. I will order more from this company. I like the style, and I do recommend this product."
5.0,Still working.
5.0,"Soft material, lots of room, good length, great color, wear with T-shirt or tank top tucked in at the front. Good for sleeping or hanging out, or with sandals shopping or at the beach."
5.0,It has pockets! 😍 this dress is lovely and well made. It has some stretch to it and hangs beautify.
5.0,"Wallet works great, was able to put 12 in cards easily. Slot for drivers license. Very satisfied."

5.0,2.5 year old wore them the entire Kings game! Couple in front of us had another brand for their 3.5 year old and they spent the game fighting the kid to keep them on.
5.0,"As expected. Very basic shirt, but great Father's Day gift for my husband. Had my kids put their handprints in acrylic paint on it for him."
5.0,"This set is very, very warm. It is soft beyond belief. I received compliment after compliment when wearing it. Even in a hard wind they keep your neck and head warm. Good purchase!!"
5.0,I brought this item for a me and a friend of mine and we both love it it fits well and it's not too long being I'm only 5ft I would definitely recommend this item to anyone.

5.0,Nice looking shirt :)
5.0,[[VIDEOID:4770b3daa808439a81b21580da6458ea]] My favorite watch thus far. I did Change the band on it. I found a oem seiko Jubilee band to put on and it's even nicer now. Great high quality watch. I don't think you can beat it for the price. Feels and looks like a<br /> $1000+ dollar watches. The back of it has a skeleton cover.
5.0,"I just received these and immediately tried on. They look awesome in the package and look better on! Very good construction, I bought them just for weight lifting and cycling activities. I wear a 36DD, I ordered the XL and it’s perfect. These are definitely worth a try at an amazing price"
5.0,"LOVE these pants! They arrived quickly with no problems! They are so comfy and love that they have pockets too! I get lots of compliments on them. They go with just about any top or tank in the summer with sandals or a pair of funky platform heels, and they are all-season enough to carry into late-fall/early winter by layering a long sleeve shirt under a shorter sweater & a pair of bootie style boots or converse all-star tennis shoes. (I guess you can tell by the way I dress that I like to be fun, funky and free-spirited. These pants are not for the conservative dresser, obviously, but they sure would enjoy the comfort of them!)<br />These can be dressed up or down. They are easy to care for. Wash with darks - DO NOT DRY - hang dry or dry clean only!<br />They run true to size (I am petite - 5'3', size 0 to 2, small hips), so the length falls right at my ankles, about 30&#34;. So if you are taller than 5'4, they may come up a bit higher, but remember it's like a skirt also, so it won't be like pants so it shouldn't make a difference.<br />These are great pants for travel, quick changing from casual to dressy if you need to, all-season, made well, and super-comfy! I wish they had more colors!<br />I like how Modernmiss offers unique clothing from the hum-drum &#34;cookie cutter-off-the-rack&#34; clothing at an affordable price! Thanks! You have a loyal customer!"
5.0,Love ornament.the chain kinda weak.
5.0,"Nice design,  always I'm looking for something different,  easy to use , love the band it's  unique and everyone asked me from where ??"
5.0,"I used these to stretch from 00 and the stretch was super comfortable with these tapers. I love the tunnels that came with them, although the o-rings can be rather difficult to put on them once they are in your ears. For such a low price, I'm glad I made this purchase and am very pleased with the product I received."
5.0,great addition to the costume
5.0,Works great<br />Looks great
5.0,Nothing I dislike about the socks they relieve my feet and legs from fatigue because I work all day at work.
5.0,Perfect for holding some gifts of USA silver coins to foreign friends of ours.
5.0,Super cute with good detail! They feel durable and all the image details are actually on the pins when you receive them! They have a good weight and quality to them.Cool pins!! Gave a few to my friends and kept a few for me. Super fun and show how you go outdoors!
5.0,"I had been agonizing over getting a timepiece, and my options were limited due to my skinnier wrists. My whole ethos in getting a watch is just to have something so I wouldn't glance at my phone so much. Ultimately I selected the F91-W. Practical, looks fine on my wrist, gives me a slight retro charm vibe, and it's cheap. You know what you're getting with this. And I am glancing at the phone at work less.<br /><br />This watch works well with casual apparel, but I also got the Casio a158w when I feel more like a fancy man and need to dress up a little. It is also cheap and also FINE."
5.0,"In addition to being AoT themed, this wallet has like 20 different card slots, 2 clear ID slots, and 4 check pockets."
5.0,Comfortable. Keeps light out. Doesn't fall off when sleeping. Decent price. Does the job.
5.0,"Such a pretty color, super stretchy material & this design definitely accentuates your curves,"
5.0,"Love the Jacket. However,  the sizes aren't too compatible for a 280 lb man, even though I do wear 2x in most outerwear.  Perhaps, the sizes are smaller than they used to be. I have another Jacket by HHGKED that still fits perfectly, so, that's is why I ordered the same size again for the newer jacket."
5.0,Bought this for my 10 yr old son and he loves it. The material is all satin (in and out) so he wears a tshirt under it.

5.0,This Cuban link chain is a great accessory for going out on the town and looking super fresh. The quality is nice and the clasp seems solid. Definitely a head snapper for getting attention. Totally recommended if you need some icy drip for your collection!
5.0,"I replaced my broken Timex Waterbury band with this one and it couldn’t have been easier. Even swapped out the buckle with the old hardware to match the face. The leather is quite stiff, but I like that it is smooth and doesn’t have excess stitching which adds bulk. More of a warning for Timex wearers- I had to return the size Timex specs listed the band would be (22mm) for a smaller (20mm) band, but that has no bearing on the quality of this band or the seller. Photos are after about 2 months daily wear. Still needs a little breaking in, and I may need to punch another hole for a better fit as the face of my watch is larger and makes the fit a bit looser on my wrist. Would fully recommend."
5.0,"These are great!  I bought these for 2 reasons ... my 8-y/o grandson wanted to be ""a nobody"" for Halloween and so he wore all pale gray, and he wanted a straight face.  Via one of these mask, I was able to achieve the look that he was after; I used a pale gray, matte, spray paint to paint one of these mask for him ... perfect!<br />Since this buy was a pack of 12 masks, I decided to have a grand-kids' sleep-over with grandma ... typically, we get creative and make fun foods & crafts at these sleep-overs, and these masks set the season!  I let the kids decorate their masks however they wanted ... paint, markers, stickers, glitter, sequins, feathers ... we had it all!  The kids still adore their masks; the girls hanged theirs on the wall.<br />I used a box cutter to cut 'breather holes' in the noses & mouths of the masks, and I cut little holes in the temples so I could thread the elastic straps through the masks (so the kids could wear them).<br />Although the cardboard masks are strong, before cutting into them, I reinforced the backside of the areas (to be cut) with white duct tape.  For us, this worked great--as, when people wear masks, their breathing causes condensation in the masks' nose & mouth areas, which could cause cardboard masks to weaken and promote moisture to bleed though to the front of the masks ... for us & our masks, the duct tape reinforcements act as a lining that keeps the nose & mouth areas of our masks dry and strong."
5.0,Excellent colors and design! Perfect for my outfit and event!
5.0,Warm and colorful. Livin large.
5.0,Super cute. Bought 2 of them
5.0,"Me gusto porque es ligero y calientito, queda para informar y casual"
5.0,"As a 34D I have a hard time finding swimsuit tops that fit, look cute, and that I can actually swim in without popping out of. This one is fabulous! Holds me, makes the girls look good, and I can swim and play in it without constantly adjusting."
5.0,My 5 year old daughter loves these❤
5.0,Looked really pretty in my hair.
5.0,"I absolutely love these board shorts! They did a great job at flattening my belly, dried really fast and the pockets are awesome(make sure you select the ""with pockets"" option) .  Im 5'5  168lbs and a large fits great!"
5.0,Love the shoe.
5.0,Bought this for a friend of mine.She loved mine so well had to get her one.
5.0,"These earrings are very nice!  I love the feather design so much that I bought these earrings in both gold and silver.  They are lightweight, the perfect length, and pretty sturdy.  They should last a long time.  These earrings go great with any outfit...work or casual!  I highly recommend them."
5.0,Love this wallet I have always had my wallet in my front pocket to protect from falling out my back pocket and this wallet is amazing it’s light it holds all the cards and even has a pocket for money in the middle everything is permitted. It has nice assassins creed logo medallion on the front it’s like a medal type of material. It’s great let’s everyone know I’m part of the brotherhood.
5.0,New favorite brand; variety of styles and material blends. Black is always a choice. Please add add'l colors. Prairie Girl
5.0,They fit very well and are extremely warm.
5.0,I absolutely love this pendant. I lost one of my Italian Greyhounds in September. I have this is a long silver chain with a teardrop pendant that hold his ashes.  I just lost my second IG this week and will get another teardrop pendant for her and have them all on the same chain.
5.0,"Super cute, purchased these for my 3 year old for preschool. Takes the worry away of my daughter accidentally dropping her mask.  I made the mistake of forgetting to wash it in a laundry bag and the plastic piece the animal was on broke. The others seem to be holding up fine."
5.0,"Bought it to complete a Halloween flapper costume. One of the feathers was bent from shipping, but overall I was pleased with the purchase and rocked my Halloween costume like a boss."

5.0,I bought these for my son's girlfriend and she loves them. Said she usually has a problem with them staying connected but hasn't had any trouble with these.
5.0,Nice hat. Good quality.
5.0,Love it...worn it once so far and got lots of comments
5.0,"Easy to change out, comfortable, fast shipping,  works great with my charge 3"
5.0,"Compared to the Buff brand headwear I've been buying, these are super cheap.  Buff's are generally $15+ each. This package of six averages about $3.50 each. What's the difference?  (1) Buff's feel more cloth-like.  These are  slippery. I didn't have issues with them sliding on my head, but I have some hair to help hold in place.  (2) Buff's are made with a thicker material. These are thinner and have a much more open weave (see picture). (3) Buff's have almost invisible seams.  These have obvious stitched seams.  When wearing on my head, I didn't feel the seams so I guess that's OK. (4) Buffs have many colors and print patterns while these are only solid black, white, and gray.<br /><br />I wear these on my head while exercising.  They do a good job of preventing sweat from dripping into my eyes.  I think their thinness/porousness also helps sweat evaporate faster.  My head stays cool.<br /><br />I'm not a medical professional, but I don't advise wearing these for your COVID-19 face mask protection.  The material is so thin I don't think it provides significant protection from germs and viruses."
5.0,"Bought for my dad.  He loves it, looks pretty good."
5.0,This is probably the most comfortable bra I've ever worn. Love the light padding as well as the color.
5.0,Warm.  Great fit.  Fast shipping.  My son loves them
5.0,Exactly what I needed to finish my project.
5.0,Perfect Minimalist Wallet. Holds everything I need and access to all my cards are quick and easy.
5.0,"Perfect size, cute and fits the Pandora."
5.0,Very nice! I would buy this again!
5.0,"Great sports necklace for the kids. I purchased 20 for the team of 11. As far as I know, only 1 broke.<br />Regardless, all of the kids were happy."
5.0,Beautiful necklace! My wife got this as a birthday gift because it is the color of her birthstone. Packaging is nice and it comes with a nice card verifying its authenticity. I would recommend this product.
5.0,My wife ordered this.  She is 5'6&#34; and weighs 120 pounds.  She ordered a small and it fit perfectly.  Very nice dress for the price and was of good quality.
5.0,"I was a little worried about the product because it was alloy and not stainless steel, but the clips are smooth and durable.  The colors are all great.  The clips do not move and do not snag the tie.  The size is perfect for most ties.  I would not use these with skinny ties."
5.0,Well made and beautiful. I bought it as a gift for a 4 year old girl and she loved it
5.0,It's a little long and there is no way to shorten the band but will work
5.0,I ordered the wrong size but it would fit as expected. Then my fiancé didn't care for the style & he rarely judges anything I wear lol so I returned it. Lovely dress though
5.0,"I'm 5'4ish so it's very long and with long sleeves but I love the fit. I'm in heels just as much as flats so not bothered by the length.  Each time I wear it, I get plenty of compliments. And it has pockets!!!!"
5.0,I love this scarf! It’s very warm and comfortable.
5.0,Cute and cheap.
5.0,Just what I was looking for. Quality is fair and they are just like any well-made​ sweatpants on the market. 10/10.
5.0,"It's a really great bag! It holds all my items. It was much smaller than I expected it to be, but don't let that stop you from getting it. I am constantly getting compliments on my bag. You should get it!!!!  I will always order from this company if I ever want a anime related bag. The shipping was really fast, it took my bag about three days to get to me, it was much shorter than the date they first gave me."
5.0,"during Covid we all walk outside a lot.  In Minnesota, that means walking into a north wind at less than 10 degrees.  OK.<br /><br />Also, blowing snow.  From a snow blower.  OK.<br /><br />I cannot afford to move to Arizona every time it gets cold.  So, I put on this.  It fits comfortably on a large man, breathes well, is comfortable.  When cold, I wear a stocking cap on top of it, but only at first.<br /><br />I have worn this cross country skiing, and it breathes well when you are sweating (in the cold).<br /><br />Does this sound fun?  IF so, this is a necessity!"
5.0,So great to keep my phone at convenient anmy neck. Never afraid of leaving it behind or drowning it.
5.0,"These are ridiculously expensive, but no one makes anything nearly this great for creating a lightweight, smooth line underneath slacks. If you’re looking for super compression, this is not for you. I’m 5’2” and 112 pounds. The small fits great."
5.0,I was actually concerned about whether or not these would fit my daughter since she is sorta in between sizes right now. I was actually very please with how they for her. I got them for her first birthday outfit. After getting her pictures done for her party though they are a little muddy I just hope they clean up easily. Overall I am very pleased with them.
5.0,Love these....adorable!
5.0,"These feel great and my husband, who does not wear this kind of sock, wears them all the time."
5.0,"Very nice ,100 % cotten . I like it. 👍"
5.0,This dress was absolutely perfect for my granddaughter's wedding on the beach. I did have to go up a size (normally a medium) but that was for MY comfort.
5.0,Excelent¡¡
5.0,"Flattering cut. I have an Athletic build so some maxis do not look great. Also, this has pockets. Who could want more in a casual dress? Unlike many of the maxis I have tried, this one is a soft cotton blend knit."
5.0,I received this watch as a gift from my husband. It is very pretty and I have gotten several compliments on it from people when wearing it out and about. Very happy with this purchase.
5.0,Love these dresses for easy summer wear!
5.0,"Love, love these Amberta products. Have 13 bracelets, all 2mm & 1mm. Wear them all together all the time.  Never tarnish & are strong for their width."
5.0,The collar should have been different
5.0,"The fit is well nice colors length ok, wish they were  longer for the most part great."

5.0,"Giving as a gift,  so I’m hoping it fits her but I feel like she is gonna be as pleased with them as I was when they came,  For as cheap as I got them I wasn’t expecting much,  But they feel good and very very cute pair of Pajamas"
5.0,This shirt is lovely for working out in. It is thin and breathes well. It is also soft. Incredibly comfortable.
5.0,Really nice.  I like the cute little 'hat' that unbuttons to cover fingers when desired.  My hands get cold when driving and using the computer.  These keep them warm without getting in the way.
5.0,"It's a little big but I love it anyway... it flows really nice and it looks nice on... even with a jacket it is cute. I probably should have gotten one size smaller but I would buy this again. Interestingly enough, the arms are a little snugger than the rest.  Also super super soft."
5.0,I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this tshirt dress! It is super comfy and fits as expected (maybe even a little looser than expected). I loved it in black so much I ordered a grey one! Love this dress and the material is very soft and comfortable. It also machine washes well on delicate with like colors and I hang dry it and it look perfect!
5.0,"Love this watch! I wanted all colors but started with the pink. I wish I had ordered the green first. The pink is lovely but I regret not getting the green first, not knowing how fast it would sell out.  😢"
5.0,I ordered a Medium ..I'm 5'2..122 pounds. The fit was perfect. The embroidery was beautiful. I ordered black. I returned the shirt because it is a crop. Im too old for cropped shirts. But it is very pretty.

5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised with the quality, appearance and the price of the pearl necklace."
5.0,"I was searching high and low for a cute summer dress for my upcoming beach vacation. I wanted something Beachy but not too casual. This dress is perfect! It arrived a little wrinkled which isn't very surprising. The blue is gorgeous, it hits right around my knees, the ruffle detailing around the top is adorable, and the buttons are a nice touch to dress it up. This dress is flattering, feminine, comfortable, and really versatile. I am 5'5"", 110 lbs, and the small fits me perfectly."
5.0,"Has been through wind gusts, rain, sleet, and hail, and has done just fine! Only thing to keep in mind is every time you roll your windows down they can fall off lol, and on certain coupes with the frameless glass such as mine, you might have to put the antlers back on when you open the door"
5.0,Fit perfectly & I love that you can adjust the size with the drawstring!!
5.0,Very pretty! Daughter loved it! Worth the money for sure.
5.0,"Incredible material and great color. My new favorite tie, I have to control myself so I don't wear this too often! Would recommend!"
5.0,Even mini would be proud!
5.0,These socks actually stay on my newborns feet. Enough said!
5.0,Love these! So easy for me to get in and out. The jewel isn't to big or small just right so my boss doesn't get after me about being professional lol most of the time my toddler doesn't even know when I changed it and he notices everything! The L bend is also perfect size don't have to worry about it coming out. All together happy
5.0,Love them. Would definitely order again
5.0,Very nice fuzzy sock. Great for wearing around the house and to bed. Keep your feet nice and warm. Pretty colors
5.0,Nice transformational dress.  I arranged it to be an Egyptian costume.
5.0,Bought this for my friend after her surgery. It’s super soft and snaps up in the front. The pockets hold the drains (she has 4). I went up a size due to swelling which really helped her. I reviewed several different shirts but I’m so glad I chose this one. She had a mastectomy and then reconstructive surgery. Would have bought more.
5.0,Great item for a great price
5.0,Had to order a size larger but I love them.
5.0,Fast delivery and comfortable
5.0,My husband loves these shirts.  He especially loves the two pockets with one separated to keep a pen/pencil.  Very handy
5.0,Very cute bracelet.  Was exactly what I expected.
5.0,I really enjoy them it has really help with the swelling in my legs and feet
5.0,"I've been wearing these day and night for the last week with no trouble or irritation. I was afraid they might poke my skin or catch my hair, but so far they have been minimally troublesome.<br /><br />I think the size is perfect and the studs are long enough for me. The diameter of the post is larger than I'm used to wearing, and my ears have been re-pierced, so it was hard getting them through at first.<br /><br />I love the comfortable screw-on backs!! They are very secure. I check them throughout the day, but they've never once needed tightening."
5.0,Sons likes the design and comfort
5.0,Purchased this for my Granddaughter for school.<br />The fit is just right.<br />The best thing is she loves the top.
5.0,Decided to go with National Lampon's Christmas Vacation as our theme for our family Christmas this year the shirt is absolutely perfect...I would highly recommend this company and it's product to everyone!!
5.0,"This bracelet ticks off all the boxes... beautiful, comfortable fit and affordable!"

5.0,"Super cute and very well made. Nice and big, I love it!"
5.0,Love the way it feels and looks!!
5.0,"As I'm getting older, I find I've lost the ability to determine what is &#34;cool&#34;.  But this bracelet just LOOKED so cool, I bought it not even knowing what a survival bracelet was ! ! ! And my 45 year old mountain biking son just loved it.  He couldn't have been happier and so I was totally happy too.  Very well made and much affordable.  Guess I'm still a cool Mom.  Thanks!"
5.0,"Exactly as pictured, fits like it was made for me, and how can you beat that price?!"
5.0,Look expensive! Very nice glasses. Packaging and case were very nice. I look forward to using these soon.
5.0,Color and quality is exactly what I expected!  Great place to get ties.
5.0,"Bands came as advertised, brand new, great quality and comfortable fit, they do not look like some cheap bands you see around. I would recommend this set for the money. In the picture is just one of the various bands that came in the set."
5.0,"Super cute and well made! 2T fit my daughter perfectly, she’s in the 95% for height."
5.0,I really like it and thank you
5.0,"Beautiful dress, fit great."
5.0,"The most comfortable bra I’ve ever worn. Invisible under a T-shirt, good support, light, breathable and comfortable. I highly recommend purchasing this and will be buying one in every color."
5.0,"Nice dress, great quality for the price. I would definitely purchase other colors if available."
5.0,"Great case! Not sure if wrap around sunglasses would fit, but regular glasses fit just fine. I believe the piece of foam that fits into the lid is not glued in incase you need that extra room to fit your glasses. I'm using that foam, and so far, it's staying in no problem. If it ever starts to fall out, I'll just glue it in. Don't really care how waterproof it is, got them to protect glasses from damage and to be able to clip the case to belt loop, lanyard, etc..... the cleaning cloth is very nice too. Would have been nice to receive one for each case tho."
5.0,"Got this dress at the last minute to wear for a winter wedding...,it was perfect!"
5.0,Ahhh I was so excited for these to come in and i love them!
5.0,Great choice for the young Superhero lover. Gives kids the feeling of a grown up Smart watch while enjoying the Batman theme.
5.0,Came early and fit right! Thanks!
5.0,Fits comfortably. I would size with your regular size. I’m a medium and it’s perfect fit. Not to tight and not over sized! Loved the photo! I have washed several times and it never faded
5.0,Comfortable and love it!
5.0,Very colorful. Have received compliments on the shirt every time I wear it.
5.0,So beautiful and a perfect blue
5.0,Loved the color and support!
5.0,4'11. Size small. Very bright color as shown in picture. Not see through at all and very light weight fabric. Fits well all around. I knew when ordering it would be too long and it was very long on me but an easy hem solved that issue. Very excited to wear during my summer vacation!
5.0,Love this dress! Super comfy and flattering
5.0,Fits like a perfect size 25 as i am in all flying monkey jeans. Style and color is adorable. Definitely will be wearing this when it gets warmer out
5.0,Perfect accessory to my closet to help organize all my purses so i can just grab the one i want and go!! Fit perfectly on the door..would definitely recommend this
5.0,Awesome aviator glasses.  These have a good color to them but does not effect the vision.  Clear vision out of the lenses.  significantly cuts out glare from the sun.  Flexible enough to be a good fit and not push too hard into the temples or above your ears.  Stays in place on the bridge of the nose well.  Feels like these are durable and should last a good long time.  Nice soft shell carry case too.
5.0,I love the way it looks & love the color & the way it fits me
5.0,My 7 year old LOVES them!
5.0,good material and very comfortable to exercise
5.0,"I've had this pajama set for a year and a half, and it's my favorite ever. It's very loose and airy, and the fabric is thin, cool and incredibly comfortable. No obvious fading over time, and I haven't noticed any pilling or other wear and tear. Hard to get stains out of, though. I wash after every wear (and sometimes wear throughout the day or to do yoga), and I don't use a delicates bag; I usually wash permanent press warm and always hang to dry and to store."
5.0,Silver Dream Catcher earrings look great and will make a great gift for my daughter.
5.0,Looks and feels just like the one that originally came with my watch
5.0,Nice brand with affordable pricing!!
5.0,"Heavy duty,  much stronger and thicker than I thought."
5.0,This is a very professional blouse. Very crisp look. Just a bit snug aroung the chest area.
5.0,My son loved them they are super lightweight and very durable surprisingly so they are very comparable to the high end under armor ones I’ve paid 5 times as much for and I think these are even lighter tgennthem which makes them a bit better in my opinion we will see if they’ll hold up over time but so far so good.
5.0,Got this for my husband who really likes it!
5.0,"I can not praise these enough. Very nice, great quality. Held together for a whole night of dancing. I will be wearing these with many different dresses. Thank you."
5.0,Was received as expected.
5.0,They are kinda flimsey but still cute
5.0,"Good quality wallet although I wish I could test the RFID blocking quality. It's held up well over the past few weeks and there are more than enough pockets for all my cards. I wish the ID card insert was removable as I never really use them, but this one seems to work pretty well."
5.0,Fits perfectly. I'm very pleased with the length. I'm 5'6 at 115lbs and it is long enough to wear with heels and still slightly drag the floor. (Which is what I want). Hope this helps.
5.0,durable and comfortable.
5.0,"High quality mesh bags. I love the soft feel of the material and the tight woven mesh. Great for a multitude of uses from travel, camping and doing the laundry. Already have more on order."
5.0,The locket was perfect for what I wanted!
5.0,Absolutely love it!  Great quality.
5.0,"I get compliments every time I wear these.  Good, solid quality for the price."
5.0,"I just tried this. And I love it so much!<br />I ordered XS and it fits perfectly. I’m less than 5 ft so it’s below the knee but even with that situation, it still looked great.<br />For someone who always wear red on Holidays, the color was perfect for Christmas and New Year. Good quality too. The belt was long but can be wrapped around my waist twice."
5.0,This was a wallet not shoes. Not sure why they are asking about fit.  My mom loves the wallet and so do I.  I am contemplating on buying myself one.
5.0,"I'm 5""10"" tall and weigh about 250 and these are a perfect length.  They are a bit large and loose, but I'm only going to wear them around the house, so that's fine with me."
5.0,"Ordered the skull one for my grand daughter (she's 16) as a gift and she loved it! She isn't a girly type of girl and isn't into the whole idea of a scarf, but ever since she got it she has worn it. It fits just right around the neck and looks just like the picture."
5.0,Love the t shirt.  It's soft and comfy and makes me smile.
5.0,"Gorgeous bag! Came well protected and beautifully made. Color is perfect for any season, will do great from late summer to fall... Just enough space for my stuff but not too much to lose things in a black hole, lol. High recommend"
5.0,Great little summer dress.
5.0,Great jewlery for my purse.
5.0,"I thought they would be a bit smaller, they are about 2.5+"" long with the gold bail at the top adding more. They are pretty and whimsical. Something different to add to your collection."
5.0,I like this product very much
5.0,This ring is so comfortable and you don't even realize you have it on
5.0,Loved the jogger fit with cuffed ankle; no shrinking after washing/drying.<br />The weight is perfect for fall outdoor walking or running errands. I purchased in three different colors
5.0,My wife loves this item.
5.0,"Very nice looking shoe. I read that the bottoms will crack out after a couple months. Haven't experienced this yet, but again I don't wear the same shoe everyday. So far so good! It does kind of have this cheap shoe sole I think on the bottom. So maybe the other reviews are right. We'll see."
5.0,"I'll start off by saying that I bought these with disgust and anger in my soul. My 16 year old son and I use the same shower.  He has grown into a disgusting fellow. I started noticing the remnants of snot rockets dried to the floor of the shower. Rather than continue to fight the urge to vomit as I shower, I opted to buy shower shoes.  Yes I corrected him, yes he stopped, yes I had him clean it, but then I had a horrifying realization that this disgusting act, which mortified me, may be just only one of the disgusting substances being left behind by him.  If I could figure a way to effectively wear a tyvek suit in the shower, and still get clean I would.  So the shoes, meh, they suffice.  I give 5 stars as I'm no longer fighting the urge to vomit as I shower."
5.0,Wish we could get another one !!
5.0,Love these they are perfect and came super fast
5.0,My grandson loved this outfit perfect for swimming or just being pool side
5.0,It was as expected--
5.0,"Great product, fits well and you can put the cover on or off with ease. Buttons work perfectly with the cover on as well."
5.0,"Love it but have to return it, sadly I am too large chested for this dress"
5.0,Got this for me and my boyfriend. He loved it too. meant a lot to him
5.0,"These sunglasses are my favorite!  I have gotten two colors and will probably be ordering another soon.  I have a hard time finding sunglasses that will stay securely on top of my head when I don't want them on my face, but are still large enough to provide good coverage and not give me a headache when they are on.  These are the perfect size.  I love the aviator style, but not the metal frames that get tangled in your hair when you push them up on your head.  These frames are all plastic with a smooth nose-piece."
5.0,I wore these socks on an 11-hour flight and my feet and legs felt great!<br /><br />I wear a size 8.5/9 women's shoe and I have skinny ankles and legs. The M/L were not super tight but they were snug. I'm in my 30s and healthy so I found them to be tight enough to be beneficial.<br /><br />I have sensitive skin and this product did not cause itchiness or any discomfort.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
5.0,These are perfect. Buttery smooth and true to size. Definitely buying in more colors
5.0,Nice charm but the bracelet is very thin an easy to break.
5.0,Seems to fit as expected. Material is nice. Worth the money
5.0,The size chart is wrong. By your usual size you normally get.
5.0,Hand bad arrived very well packed. It  definitely is a nice big hand bag! Well worth the money . I have recieved a lot of compliments thus far and I have only had it 1 week.
5.0,My daughter likes them so much for daily wear purpose.
5.0,"love slipknot, love hoodies, it's perfect"
5.0,I love this dress!  I have received several compliments. I can wear it over a bathing suit or dress it up for lunch or an evening out! The color is FAB!!
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for to store label maker.
5.0,Friends loved it.
5.0,I love these. I have a tankini top that’s is perfect with it.
5.0,Love these they are my favorite and I always get lots of compliments
5.0,"Gorgeous! Looks more expensive than it is, I get so many compliments on it! I wear it as a beach coverup or over a tee shirt dress to go out in!"
5.0,Well made and perfect for handsfree key usage!
5.0,Love this sweater immensely and will be buying more in the near future.
5.0,Worked great for the gag gift I envisioned.
5.0,"This is a fantastic product! So much I'm sending one to a friend.<br /><br />I've tracked down so many of my forgotten pieces of jewelry, and brought them back to life in a new way. It's amazing how beautiful a piece of jewelry can be once it's clean!...much like so much of things in the rest of our lives ;)<br /><br />In both of my photos the pieces on the right have been cleaned up, and the ones on the left haven't. You can see how gross the unclean clean ones are! Magic- and I love it."
5.0,"These are excellent shorts.  Not too tight nor too loose. Exactly as I desired. They breathe, they are comfortable."
5.0,Have each one to my crazy plant lady friends. They love them.
5.0,Nice earrings and good quality. I just wish the black was darker more of a smokey black..
5.0,Good quality and very nice piece
5.0,Super comfortable will definitely purchase more of this bra
5.0,[[VIDEOID:aa4bc1b12f535dfd038dc9c0b6bf13ac]] So squishy. Great price for the amazing product I recommend if you want a 👍🏻 great  squishy.
5.0,"Just like the picture, love it and thanks so much."
5.0,I like the keychain the most.
5.0,"My husband is a LEO and he loves these gloves. Warmth but he can still grip the steering wheel, use pens, use his phone, etc. He even wears them when he goes for runs to keep his hands from getting wind chapped. He said just size up for more comfort."
5.0,Love the item for the price. these types of things go in and out of season.
5.0,"I bought this for my granddaughter and she love, love. Loves the bracelet."
5.0,"I bought this belt as a gift for a relative.  After he wore it, he reported that he loved it!  He said he  really enjoyed how easily the belt could be adjusted, and in such precise increments."
5.0,It's wonderful! Got here a little later then I wanted. But it's beautiful!
5.0,Graat
5.0,I purchased these hats for my 18 month old. They are so cute. They fit her perfectly and are of great quality. The Pom poms were also really fluffy.
5.0,"This piece is a very detailed, strong, durable, and beautiful work of art. I’ve sweated and swam with it on, and it looks just as good as the day I first put it on. It’s also a great little reminder of the 2nd Degree in masonry!<br /><br />The price is excellent for the value I received with this necklace."
5.0,"this bathing suit is too cute!  oh my goodness I wish I got one years ago. I am 39 and this is my first bikini!  im 5 foot 5, 148 pounds and wear a size small/ x small in old navy clothes.  bust size is 36dd.  I ordered this in xl and it fits perfect!  I was way too self conscious to ever wear a bikini but I feel stunning in this!  and its a head turner...the colors and pattern are so bright.  I feel very classic 1960's beach!  feminine and curvy!  im in good shape but not exactly toned up for a low cut bikini bottom. especially after a c section 15 years ago!.  im so happppy!  cannot wait to wear this for my beach weekend!"
5.0,I used one to replace the original that broke.  I will keep a few.  My granddaughter is creative: I'm giving the rest to her.  I'm expecting some interesting Christmas gifts.
5.0,My grand baby will love this set thank you
5.0,"Perfect for me:  lightweight, lots of pockets, roomy enough to carry a large water bottle or a paperback book."
5.0,"I have tried 2 other brands, so far this turned out to be the best fitting, and nicest quality."
5.0,"Exactly as described. Fit is comfortable and just right. Not too tight, not too stretchy, doesn’t loose shape with wear"
5.0,Great sling pack. Awesome size. Will buy from again
5.0,Muy rica tela
5.0,Very beautiful and perfect size.  The diamond cut sparkles.

5.0,My son wore this tie to his prom and he looked great!
5.0,"I'm Absolutely in love with this necklace, It is EVERYTHING and a little more. Its a Great quality, its exactly how it looks in the pic. They say you can never go wrong with pearls and this necklace gives that justice. Can't wait to wear it at my sister's beach wedding!! Ready to Slayyyyy!!"
5.0,Loved it! Really cute and simple however it oxidizes after a month.
5.0,"UPDATE: Gave this to my junior high class as a prize and they loved it!<br /><br />They’re much better than you’d expect from wrist bands. Love the lettering and painting and it’s seemless, it’s one solid band. Comes with a nice packaging."
5.0,I'm 5'9. I wear 14/16 and this &#34;one size&#34; fit me perfect. The material was nice and flowy. The length the was nice (to my feet) and adjustable.Although the color on the picture did not match . I love it!!!😊
5.0,I have been wearing LE clothing for years. These crop pants are among my favorites. Lands End has discontinued them. They run a bit on the generous side. I wear a 14 and take a medium in these pants ( I am bottom heavy). They are extremely comfortable and appropriate to wear to work or just casually. They are a go to for me in the warmer months.
5.0,Really great and cute for what it is... great investment if your flying Spirit (Or one of the cheap airlines) with such expensive carry on policies...
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:4815498bf94f17875a8cf3076b766ebd]] Design: 5/5<br />Flexibility: 5/5<br />Durability: 5/5<br />Value for Money: 5/5<br />Packaging: 5/5<br /><br />The crown is designed specifically for birthday parties.

5.0,Love the quality! Will continue to be a customer!
5.0,"Loved this bag! Took it traveling and used it for the beach, shopping and groceries. Bought two more when I got home."
5.0,Bought these for my deployed husband and he LOVES them for workouts and runs! They fit great & help keep his glasses in place.
5.0,"Good value, 4 for the price of one. This is great for physical activity. You don't have to worry about fixing your glasses all the time or worry about falling off if you need to bend. Fits your glasses like a globe. Very comfortable to wear as well."
5.0,The price is right.  The product works as designed and promised.  Meets all expectations.
5.0,they came finally it took a long time they are smaller than the picture looks. If you like small hanging earrings they are for you.
5.0,"Found this item to be softer than expected and very comfortable and perfect to wear on a chilly evening at home curled up on the couch. As the rest of the family wears winter and Christmas themed clothes, this chicken really stands out and I love it. It’s also great for walking the dog and going out to fetch the mail. It never disappoints. I am extremely pleased with this purchase."
5.0,very attractive shoe.
5.0,"Skirt was little loose, wasn’t sure if the back was suppose to cross or not, so I crossed it anyways since it seemed a tiny bit loose. And I must admit it looked much nicer that way. My daughter wore it on Thanksgiving and I must say, she got a lot of compliments! It’s so cute!"
5.0,"I bought these for my son who adores all things Minecraft. I always cringe when ordering clothes online but these were totally worth it. He has declared them to be the most comfortable jammies he has ever known. For me, I love that the size was exactly as expected (we sized up slightly to allow for growing room). They washed up so soft and the design is adorable. I would definitely purchase these again."
5.0,Love the chain!
5.0,So pretty and unique!!!
5.0,like that the material is jersey like and made very well not only are they comftorable they are very soft
5.0,"Perfect belt that's why I own 2,<br />Stylish perfect easy to wear matches everything flexible and very much enjoyed thank you"
5.0,"I have been using Polysorbate 80 for 20 years, as a solvent to wash away DHT deposits on the scalp, said deposits reputed to be inimicable to the hair follicle. When my supplier discontinued this product, I found a new source on Amazon, and I am grateful to have done so, and satisfied that I can still continue my protocol for retarding hair loss on my aging head."
5.0,6ft 190 lbs. Ordered xl.  For pretty good.  Little loose around waist.  Drawstring needed to keep em tight. Feel like right fit for working out.  Don't like right workout clothes. Don't know about durability just got and looks so far
5.0,This is really beautiful and I love how big it is
5.0,Beautiful! Exactly what I ordered!
5.0,IT's easy to use and great and works well in hot weather.  I would recommend to anyone who wants to stay cool for a while in the hot weather.
5.0,Had a lot of fun wearing it. Tip: if it’s not sunny and bright turn it off while driving. Many vehicles mistook me for an emergency vehicle with the flashing lights and pulled over.
5.0,I love this dress. I wore it for my son's Church Dedication and got lots of complements. i added a belt to add shape to my waist.
5.0,Love these shades. Durable and I get so many compliments.

5.0,Soft and comfortable. I have already ordered more.
5.0,"Fun glasses.  Taking them to Vegas,."
5.0,"Good size tote for travel, not too oversized. It holds just enough where it doesn't get too heavy. Love all the zippered compartments & RFID case."
5.0,"The color of the rose is a little different then pictured. Mine was a tad more yellowish than the creme/pale yellow color the picture shows, but it was still beautiful. When you consider the price, it's actually pretty good quality for such a low price. I'm happy with it. I didn't experience the flower falling off like some other people did. Even if it fell off, just super glue it back. The chain is nice and long so it hangs really nicely. I love it."
5.0,Love love loved it. I seriously have to say I looked good in it.
5.0,"This jacket is very nice quality. It looks great even if it wasn’t heated. The heat gets warm very quickly. I like that you can take off the hood & patch. The pockets are really nice. It’s comfortable to wear. It’s very fitting, looks slimming, but still has good range of motion to move in."
5.0,So pretty and so sexy! Love how mysterious my husband looks in his mask. He says he loves how my eyes pop in this mask!
5.0,Definitely don't feel like cheap sunglasses totally worth the buy. 😎 I love that they came with a hard case and a large dust cloth. I ordered the blue lense ones because they looked like amazing but also because of the great price. They are better then expected and I always get so many compliments. I love them and I’ll happily keep replenishing my sunglasses for this price.
5.0,"Wore them for the first time this morning, kept my hands much warmer than the woven ones that I have. Easy to drive with also."
5.0,I really like these very soft
5.0,Purchased as a gift. Closure peg didn't fit well. Pretty addition to any antique gun display.
5.0,Beautiful earrings! Perfect for spring and summer!
5.0,sockes
5.0,Very comfortable doesn’t hurt behind my ears having to wear one 10 hours a day at work
5.0,"Stocks fit great, stay up and are long lasting"
5.0,Stunning in person. Looks much more expensive than its price tag.  This was a gift for my mom. She wears it all the time and says she gets tons of compliments on rhis necklace!
5.0,"I absolutely LOVE these leggings ! If you’re on the hunt for great leggings, THIS is your sign sis . What are you waiting for ? I love that they’re high wasted and the compression on these psshh  GIRLLLLLL they suck everything in and sinch the waist beautifully. I will definitely be buying more."
5.0,Great swim trunks fit as expected nice and light and quick to air dry I would recommend they are fun and definitely a conversational piece
5.0,This was a Christmas present for my husband! It fits great and he loves wearing it!
5.0,Great quality! My almost 10 year old loves them.
5.0,Great socks!!! so cute and perfectly new and cozy.  I love them.
5.0,"I have this suit for my 8 year boy. I bought a size 10 but it was too big, so I change it to a size 8 ( his normal size ) and it fits perfectly!!<br /><br />The color is as the pic y looks super nice. The fabric is super soft and looks great quantity. The shirt is a perfect size.<br /><br />The pants is a little long for my son but he won’t use it few months later so probably he will grow. It is an amazing suit."
5.0,I love this oversized shirt!! It's so comfy and moves with me. Not to mention super cute!
5.0,"Me agrada como se ve, cuando la uso ademas de que abrogated mucho el cuello , y Guarda muy bien el calor manteniendo el cuerpo en una temperature grata...."
5.0,"Perfect fit, the material al good. Perfect fit<br />Five stars"
5.0,These pants are comfy. They wrinkle pretty easily but if you throw them in the dryer for a few minutes it’ll fix that. I loved my black pair so much that I ordered the hunter green as well. They also fit beautifully but beware. The material is so thin if you have any cellulite on your legs the green does show it. I’ll just wear those around the house.
5.0,"This is a very lightweight and compact bag, but still fits gym clothes and a pair of sneakers.  I wear a size 10 and they fit great, along with shorts and a T-shirt.  I wouldn’t plan to use this as a weekend getaway bag but this definitely works for the gym.<br />I wish it had a shoulder strap but that’s about it."
5.0,"Let me start by saying that I have now purchased 2 of these. Not because the first one was faulty, broken, etc.  The first was for Xmas---fast forward about a month after receiving it and my son left it in his jeans.  It went thru the wash.  After sitting in rice for a couple of days it still worked :)  couple weeks later---washed again.  This time it didn't survive :(<br /><br />I reordered and simply told my son that I had sent it to get fixed (after all it was from Santa)...he loves it.<br /><br />I have to admit that for, essentially, $6 this item exceeded my expectations.  I seriously thought I would get an item that would fall apart after a little usage, cheaply looking, or have the 'bronze' flake off.  Am happy to say that none of these have occurred (and even withstood that washing!)  Shipping was free, although since it comes from Hong Kong it did take a while.  Plan accordingly.<br /><br />I would be curious to find out which seller the negative reviews dealt with.  My experience with VIKEN was positive.  Shipping took 'long' but not as long as the 'expected' arrival date.  The only negative would be that I did not get the 'extra battery' but for $6 I didn't mind :)"
5.0,Love these glasses. Very well made. Wear them every day.
5.0,Ordered the 6-12 month because my baby is 6 months but wears 9 month clothes but the 6-12 month was way too big and the 0-6 month wasn’t much smaller no way it would fit a newborn. My baby is 29” tall and 17.5 lbs
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:782600289e6093683b8c1451525b1628]] The softest and comfiest thing ever!! You need it! I got the white with the pink and orange and I love it!! I feel like i will be wearing it everyday!! Its just so comfy!! For someone like me who is always cold, this is the perfect item to keep me warm!❤️"
5.0,Green and gorgeous. I ordered my usual size and they are just right. These would make anyone feel at home in the Emerald City.
5.0,I love it.  Not only the fabric but also it fits perfectly.  Hope you have more styles that we can choose from.
5.0,"These pants are exactly what I was looking for to fit under ski pants. They are very formfitting, I would not wear them as my only pants. They are a smooth silky material which makes them perfect for putting other pants over the top of they do not stick to my ski pants. I received this product in exchange for my honest review."
5.0,Adorable solution.  And actually stay on!
5.0,"Quick delivery, great value and fit."
5.0,"I have been wearing Think shoes for many years. The fit is reliable, as is the comfort of certain styles. I wish they were less costly, but they hold up for a very long time."
5.0,Very soft.  A good fit.
5.0,These are very comfortable. They’re light and don’t leave marks on my nose. They’re also very easy to see over so I don’t have to take them off and put them back on all the time.
5.0,I really love this bracelet and will purchase more! It's a good fit.
5.0,"My feet tend to run hot so always looking for thinness and best breathing socks. These fit the bill perfectly. No bunging. They stay put, no problem."
5.0,I bought this pack for my son and his team - all the boys loved them. Great buy!
5.0,Fits amazing!! And the complexion is the best I’ve seen for my skin tone yet.
5.0,"You can feel wind blow through it, so it’s nice if you want a lighter hoodie"
5.0,"Keeps you dry, fits very well"
5.0,"Love these - and they are, despite another reviewer's comment, normal sized earrings."
5.0,I love these glasses. I got them in size medium and they're absolutely perfect for my face. Not too huge and not tiny. They're a great fashion statement and they're very durable and high quality. Great for the price.
5.0,"Love the dress.  It fits and I'm shocked at that!  Have terrible time finding styles that fit my 5'4 120 small frame.  It is nice light material, and hang nicely.  I did 5 stars, but I haven't tried washing it yet, but am hoping it comes out ok."
5.0,Love the style and design of this dress. Very flattering and super comfy!
5.0,Bought a side smaller looks and feels great wearing now
5.0,"WHAT A DEAL!!! Very quick delivery. For about $40 I wasn't really expecting as nice a pair of gloves as these. The fit and stitching is perfect. They're not thick gloves...they're exactly what I expected and wanted for driving gloves here in So Cal. The leather is very soft and my smartphone touchscreen responds perfectly with them on. I ordered the brown and it's a very dark brown. So dark that I wss only able to distinguish that they were brown is by outing them next to something black. I love them. Especially at this price, most definitely recommend them."
5.0,The hubby loves these. well made. they fit his big head perfectly.
5.0,"Cute! But because it doesn’t have a tongue and I had to size up based off previous reviews, it does leave a little indentation on my daughters foot. She’s 18 months and said “owwwe”. Lol however, the shoes are super cool because they glow in the dark!"
5.0,"Honestly, I'm not sure if it's real leather, but it is super light weight, fits all I need in it and bright so easy to find in my purse."
5.0,These slippers fit true to size and are super comfortable to wear around the house.
5.0,Awesome. Look great. Would buy again.
5.0,"Where have these little things been all my life! No more floppy collar. These things really do work, you can’t see them in the shirt and just make the collar look very crisp. Phenomenal product!"
5.0,love them price was great too
5.0,Sentimental
5.0,I purchase this item for my daughter for Christmas and she loved it.. thank you
5.0,Adorable! And excellent customer service!
5.0,WORKS GREAT. SON USES IT FOR NIGHT FISHING.
5.0,"I ordered this dress in three colors and ended up keeping two (black and cobalt). The dress is a tiny bit shorter than I expected - even though I am only 5'2""- but still a good length. I've worn them to several events now and gotten many compliments. Especially considering the price, this dress is great!"
5.0,Best tie ever
5.0,Very cute bead! Adorable and I love it 😊
5.0,This band works great and much more comfortable to me than the plastic band that comes with the fitbit
5.0,Great bras very pretty!
5.0,Great fit. Good product for big men!👍👍
5.0,Good quality very cute good size
5.0,Really easy to put in and super cute
5.0,As advertised & on time!
5.0,Gojira is amazing. great cd
5.0,I would first of all say that this dress is not Nordstrom quality. But neither is the price. You get what you pay for if not a little more. My daughter looks beautiful in this dress and I have already washed it a couple of times and it still looks the same. The material is very thin but it is sewn well and should last a few more washes at least.
5.0,I really like the feel and the fact I don't get hot or warm even in the sun. The designs are beautiful.
5.0,I was expecting something at thin and cheap end cotton because of the low price but this is actually thick and good material cotton. I have sensitive skin and get rashes on my chests when stitches are in front. I don’t get rashes on this one.
5.0,perfect size and great color!
5.0,Comfortable and do the job
5.0,"The dress is gorgeous, but runs a little big. I was on the fence between ordering a L or XL. I went with the XL and it’s a little too big, which makes me look even bigger. I plan to exchange the the L when it’s back in stock. The material is very light and silky. I tried it on with nude undergarments and you couldn’t see them. Perfect dress for summer!"
5.0,These leggings are the BEST!! There well made and VERY pretty the lace adds a feminine touch. I will buy again for sure.
5.0,"My daughter got these boots for her Cosplay outfit for the convention coming up. She has not had a chance to wear them long term yet so cannot really say how long they can be worn comfortably. But I can tell you that they look adorable on her, fit as expected and she says they feel comfortable to wear. They came on time."
5.0,For those of us cool mint over-imaginative and tender stories like Alice in Wonderland no longer being available to us this simple but lovely zippered pouch is a fine reminder. The pouch is long enough to hold pens and pencils or makeup or any small collection of things you may have.
5.0,Absolutely beautiful. Just as pictured.
5.0,My girl love
5.0,Hermoso y cómodo.
5.0,My son love his new glasses I took them to Costco for his prescription👌👍
5.0,My son loves these hoodies with a mask.  He picked it out and was so excited to wear it even though it was 95 degrees out.  I've washed it a few times and comes out great.
5.0,"LOVE this handbag! It's not real leather, but it has the look and feel of real leather. I chose the ""coffee"" color and it's terrific! I love all the different zippered sections and the fact the zippers work smoothly. I don't like carrying around a large purse, so this size is perfect for me. Knowing that it's waterproof sets my mind at ease. I like having an adjustable strap so I can use this different ways (crossbody, over the shoulder or by hand). This is a great purse."
5.0,"What Is It?<br /><br />Polysorbate 20 and the other Polysorbate ingredients (Polysorbate 21, Polysorbate 40, Polysorbate 60, Polysorbate 61, Polysorbate 65, Polysorbate 65, Polysorbate 80, Polysorbate 81, Polysorbate 85) are a series of general purpose hydrophilic, nonionic surfactants. The Polysorbates are used in a variety of products including skin fresheners, skin care products, skin cleansing products, makeup bases and foundations, shampoos, permanent waves and fragrance powders.<br /><br />Why is it used in cosmetics and personal care products?<br /><br />The Polysorbate ingredients help other ingredients to dissolve in a solvent in which they would not normally dissolve. They also help to form emulsions by reducing the surface tension of the substances to be emulsified.<br /><br />Scientific Facts: $<br /><br />Polysorbates are surfactants that are produced by reacting the polyol, sorbitol, with ethylene oxide. The number in the name of the Polysorbate indicates the average number of moles of ethylene oxide that has been reacted per mole of sorbitol. The polyoxyethylenated sorbitan is then reacted with fatty acids obtained from vegetable fats and oils such as lauric acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid and oleic acid. Polysorbates function to disperse oil in water as opposed to water in oil"
5.0,They fit just perfect. Kevlar + pads included
5.0,"Great dress. Ordered both a size 4 and size 6. Both fit but I liked the fit and length of the size 6 better. I am a mom of 3 little kids and I need to be able to move and bend without worrying about my dress being too tight. I am 5'2 and 120lbs, 34C."
5.0,Fit perfect! Cute!
5.0,Just my granddaughter wanted.
5.0,Excellent product quality
5.0,This bathing suit fits as expected and is super cute. I love the colors and design. It's also very comfortable to wear either walking around at a water park or swimming.
5.0,"I am 5'2, 185 lbs., wear a L/XL, size 12 in dresses - When I took the dress out of the packaging, I thought,  oh no, its not gonna fit, but I was wrong! This dress is gorgeous! The mid-section stretches, the upper area is nice and roomy, not too tight, and the bottom, beautiful and flowy. I wish they made this dress in solid colors I would definitely buy more!!!"
5.0,I love the way this dress fits. And I definitely like pockets in a dress. Worth buying. Very flattering.
5.0,Beautiful. I love this idea of wooden jewelry. This is such an interesting style. It is sustainable too! I also love the earrings they sell!
5.0,"It's extremely long, I was thinking about cutting it! But overall it fits great and looks good on! I can't wait to wear it"
5.0,"I just returned from Poland after buying amber jewelry there. I didn’t buy earrings and regretted it.<br />These are perfect. The quality is very good, not too heavy and the color is beautiful."
5.0,"I will be Mother of Groom this fall. I shopped for my dress wearing my fave fancy earrings, purchased on Main Street in Half Moon Bay. Now we live in Texas. The dress neckline calls for a necklace and all I could do short of flying back to NorCal was search Amazon with a prayer - ANSWERED! Discovered the earrings were by Catherine Popesco and, yay, Amazon has coordinating necklace! Arrived beautifully boxed and quickly as always."
5.0,This top came nicely packaged and is nice quality top for summer. I ordered a 2X which is my normal size and it fit perfectly. The sunflowers are vibrant and received many compliments. Worth the money
5.0,"Exactly what i wanted! good size, stays put, and looks good with any outfit style"
5.0,"When I received this product I was pleasantly surprised. The fabric stretch to mold to the shape of your body. I encountered two small issues: the length is very long which is a great option for those taller (hem) however the material is thin (shaper pantyhose will fix that). I am 5' 4&quot;, 174lbs and I ordered a Large."
5.0,"Nice armor, very tough, nice cut leather and decent stitching. Looks real and is functionally stiff. Item arrives flat. Good price."
5.0,"This has become my go-to vest.  It’s lightweight, warm and drops down in back for a little extra coverage.  Also, washes well with no shrinkage or pilling.  I really like the band of turquoise on the edging, although I hesitated to buy it because of that.  However, it gives the vest a little decorative touch."
5.0,Nice color / pattern selection. I'm able to easily mix these in with a lot of different shirt/tie combos.
5.0,Very comfortable easy to put together has nose clip and is atactive easy to use and no problem breathing and you don't sound like Darth Vader.
5.0,"I just got this product today, and first impression is that it is well made and very comfortable.  I have ready other reviews, saying that the color rubs off.  As far as I can tell, right now, I don’t see that happening.  However, if it does I will update this review.  As of right now, I am very happy that I made this purchase, it is much better than the stock band that comes with the Gear Fit 2"
5.0,"Great item, as described!"
5.0,Awesome. My wife loved it
5.0,Very happy with the Belt Very nice Thanks
5.0,Fits perfect and looks elegant
5.0,I in the past left a negative review due to my anger of waiting almost two months for the product. I came to find the seller was not the reason for the late delivery but yet it was USPS who Lost it not once but three times. when the product came it was just as described and my daughters loved them being that i bought the red and purple one. great Product and service all around.
5.0,Soft fabric with beautiful designs that pop on the color of the shirt.
5.0,This dress is so perfect! It is lined so it is not see through even through the white. It fits great and the high low hem line is so cute. I am tempted to buy it in the other colors!
5.0,the hat is great and fit well- a fun hat!
5.0,"I originally got the gray shoes and gave a 4-star rating because they seemed tight (bought right size) and with little foot support.  I've worn them for miles daily and came back to buy the shoes in another color, I like them so much.  They just needed a little breaking in."
5.0,Really a cute style! I’m a plus size and finding young looking nice clothes are a challenge. I wore leggings with it! Soft and comfortable!!
5.0,This is a beautiful bag. Perfect gift for my sister and she love it so much!

5.0,What what was expected
5.0,"Beautiful dress, the elastic  on the shoulders is little tight but not enough to return it. Received compliments when I wore it."
5.0,"Gave them as Christmas  gifts, everyone loved them and wore them during the winter...thin but very warm! Very cute and will buy them again!"
5.0,"This is a beutiful watch, shipped so fast!! thank you,  Watchmaxx !!"
5.0,I love the swivel and tilt features on this umbrella.  Very easy to use and I really enjoy this umbrella!  I use it everyday that it isn't windy.
5.0,Display my job when in usaf
5.0,Quality material and print.  I wore this shirt to a bar and it stood out so much a CU fan wouldn't let me sit at an open barstool haha.
5.0,"My daughter fell and broke a shoulder bone so severely, the surgeon had to use a metal plate and pins to put her back together. I purchased this shirt, in every color and, they are fabulous! I think when one is recovering from surgery the last thing one should struggle with, is getting dressed. I am so thankful to the inventor of this garment, it has saved us from pain, discomfort when dressing and, tears when personal privacy is abandoned. My daughter feels great about getting dressed and going to PT without having to expose herself. I only wish there were more colors!"
5.0,they are amazing I love them I am definitely getting more
5.0,I loved the earrings. I was looking for a lot of pairs of earrings for my new earring holder and I was in love with them. You get the value for your money. Super cute and light weight. Super fashionable as well.
5.0,Just like it looks online.
5.0,This is a super cute little thank you gift or gift of appreciation that won't break the bank and can easily be paired with something else.
5.0,Very nice and well-made!
5.0,When I recieved my necklace I was extremely pleased.  I get alot of compliments everytime I wear it....its very beautiful
5.0,Comfortable and colorful. Great for warm weather rides. Provides some cushioning.
5.0,Very comfortable. Nice water resistance. Didnt smell even after a few days in jungle.
5.0,Very light weight and durable.
5.0,I LOVE this dress. I get so many compliments on it.
5.0,"very comfortable, sturdy, and quick change for arms to strap"
5.0,Son is very picky about shoes. These seem to be soft and comfortable.
5.0,"Nice gloves, great price. Size runs a bit large,I usually wear a large but the medium fit me."
5.0,I love love love this dress. Very flattering and my go to LBD
5.0,"Loved this dress so much that I ordered a second one in blue!! I’m 5’2”, 135lbs and purchased a small. Not see-through at all and has pockets!! :) Super comfortable."
5.0,"Great quality , very beautiful . My daughter 1.5 years old, weighing 12 kg , was great !!"
5.0,"This robe is great, nice quality fabric, very comfortable.  I only wish the hood were bigger.  Otherwise, it's prefect, just what I was looking for.  For me, the &#34;one size fits all&#34; is a good fit; I'm 5'10&#34;, about 155 (male) and typically wear a men's med-large."
5.0,It’s soooo pretty!!! Gonna purchase the gold necklace as well!!
5.0,Simplemente hermosas! Adorables!
5.0,"Great with my boots, keeping my jeans in for my boots to fit over.  Looks really cute and classy for boot wearers, for both tall and short boots."
5.0,"I can't say anything but great things about this pendant necklace.  The price was perfect, shipping was fast, the pendant is a great piece, perfect size, flawless look with a great chain.  My wife loved it!!  This was an excellent buy and I suggest taking a look at this business, I am positive you'll be as pleased as I am.  I will be buying from them again.  Top Notch Business!!"
5.0,"I unearthed some EXTREMELY tarnished sterling silver family candlesticks which had not been polished in at least 25 years.  I bought new products from Amazon before tackling the job: a liquid tarnish remover, a silver polishing cream, and this polishing cloth.  Despite all the elbow grease and satisfaction after using the first two products, the white portion of the Polishing Cloth surprisingly found even more tarnish!  And, lastly, the navy cloth portion  (attached to the white) rendered a soft, glowing silver finish that is absolutely beautiful!  Buy it!"
5.0,This product worked better than I imagined. My timbs were covered in 6 different types of bbq sauce and all things in a bbq restaurant which are the absolute hardest stains to get out of anything. This kit took them away completely
5.0,Great Qualtity and Fits perfectly<br />40DD Fits an Xl Nicely
5.0,I love these! They are super long and warm! Just what I was looking for!
5.0,"I was a little skeptical about this product, not really believing that a couple of pieces of cloth could really shine up my ring (sterling silver). But it worked amazingly well!! I highly recommend this product."
5.0,We took a family trip to Denver and my son used these goggles and he loved them. He wore them for two days and never complained about them being uncomfortable. That’s good for a 6-year-old who doesn’t like anything in his eyes. They goggles looked so good that I was going to order me a pair.
5.0,"Such a great bag, so roomy and decorative!"
5.0,Super duper cute
5.0,"My wife is in love with this. Being from Phoenix, she was worried about the cold during her week long work trip to New York, but this kept her warm"
5.0,"These earrings are perfect for casual wear, especially with jeans. But since I wear Jean's everywhere, I wear these earrings a lot. Great buy"
5.0,"I got a large and it fits great! The material is a good thickness, which was what I mostly worried about. Definitely go by the measurements they give you in the description. Mine fit like a glove. My boyfriend was speechless for Valentine's.<br />Very soft inside so it's extremely comfortable to wear, even for someone like me who doesn't like to wear dresses."
5.0,"Bought this jacket for my winter jacket this past year and it lasted well, held up to the rain and snow, and kept me warm. Definitely a loud jacket when your sitting in the middle of a quiet lecture trying to take it off, but get the job done with being cute and comfy."
5.0,"Perfect. This is rather thin BUT soaks up sweat. I was wearing 'normal' 4 inch cotton headbands at the gym (I put a pretty, thinner one as a 2nd layer).  But sweat was pouring down my face. With this? No sweat at all comes down. Now, my face itself also sweats, but this performs as promised, fits perfect, is quality material (went in the washer - by mistake- came out fine, and I air dried it).  Very happy with purchase. Will buy more, should I need to."
5.0,"Amazing shirt, hilarious, comfortable. It fights me closer than other shirts. Normally a large, an XL might have been too big. A medium definitely wouldn't have fit. Would buy a large again. (6ft, 220lbs, somewhat barrel chested)"
5.0,Great Item - and like 95% off retail
5.0,"I really love this dress! I also bought it in blue and black & white, and they all look amazing. The dresses are tight and cut really short, but that is exactly how I wanted them to fit. I bought an XS and I was so pleased with consistent sizing and a true bodycon fit. I'm 115 lbs at 5ft 5in, and I usually struggle to find dresses on Amazon that aren't baggy on me. These dresses did not disappoint! I would buy more if the style came in more colors!"
5.0,I love this shirt. It's so comfortable and fits really well. The worst part about it is people keep asking me if the old man is my grandpa and it keeps bumming me out. People should know who the Father of Evolution is.
5.0,"I'm 5'3&#34; tall, with chest 34b, waist 25&#34;, hips 33.5&#34;, weight 102 lbs, and I ordered small in Navy. This jumpsuit fits like a glove. Fabric is stretchy, lace is of decent quality. Fabric rides up a bit but manageable. I think as hours pass, this form fitting jumpsuit would relax a bit so fabric would not ride up as easily. I like the Ankle length look but I wouldn't want it any shorter, so definitely handwash in cold water, or turn jumpsuit inside out and put it in laundry bag before placing it in washer on hand wash or delicate setting- again, make sure use only cold water and air dry naturally to prevent shrinkage. I've ordered black and red this morning. Hope they're as nice as my Navy jumpsuit. Highly recommend! Thank you Seller!"
5.0,Amazing band!!!
5.0,Love the watch.  Easy to read
5.0,For my daughter and she loves them. They fit perfect and lit up just like they were supposed to. Great product great price. Would definitely buy again.
5.0,"This dress is an absolute dream! Flattering fit for curvier figures and the cutout chest provides ample room for a fuller bust without being too obscene. The true circle skirt is full enough that the dress can be worn without a crinoline liner, however I've worn it both ways and it looks cute with/without.<br /><br />I'm no stranger to these inexpensive Chinese brand vintage style dresses,  and they can be very hit or miss, this one really knocks it out of the park!"
5.0,This is so cute... the quality is great. I love this dress
5.0,I broke other pair I had these were a replacement love them great sunglasses
5.0,"ToteBagFactory Cotton Canvas Tote Bags are made with a thick material that is perfect for screen printing on! My husband enjoys designing and screen printing t-shirts, canvas, posters, etc. These tote bags have a thick canvas that absorbs the ink very well, but doesn't bleed through. The length of the straps is what I was pleasantly surprised by. Normally, tote bags have short handle straps, but with these straps I am able to carry over my shoulder. The stitching is tight and with the heavy weight material these are quality bags! I highly recommend these bags for screen printing, iron-ons, fabric paints, etc! The 12 pack makes it great for personalizing and giving as gifts!<br /><br />Given sample to test thoroughly and return my personal honest opinion. I have made no false statements nor promised a high rating."
5.0,"I love the way this dress fits, and how elegant and classy it made me feel. The dress is true to size and it made me feel stunning and gorgeous.."
5.0,This dress fits perfectly. The fabric is thick so no bumps are showing off. It is a stiffer material too but not uncomfortable and you can use an iron on it. I got lots of compliments in this dress and I feel like a 1940s dream.
5.0,Bought for wife on mothers day. She absolutely loves them.
5.0,Beautiful ring. Details are great. Love that ring
5.0,"For me this purse is the perfect size - small and light enough to not feel heavy yet big enough to hold my wallet, phone and a few small items.  To reviewer Mom's Stuff:  contact the company.  They guarantee the purse and will take it back if you are not satisfied.  Mine opens and closes easily so you must have gotten a defective one."
5.0,Jay love it- Thanks
5.0,"I've had this wallet for a little bit now and it still looks like new, and I'm really rough on wallets. It has plenty of space in it and the designs are still really vibrant. There isn't a fade on it anywhere that I can see"
5.0,Great buy - I really like the shirt it fit well and looks good. I've had several compliments when worn.
5.0,Gave as a gift that was very well-received.  She loved it!
5.0,These are my new favorite workout/lounge pants. At first I was skeptical since I’m a die hard Lulu Lemon fan but once I put these on I quickly order 5 more in different colors. They’re so comfortable and super flattering on my body.
5.0,Good product to wear as a layer in the cold. I ise it as a layer when i run in the winter
5.0,Bought them for my girls and they love them
5.0,"Didn’t come with gift box as stated but comes in a little pull tight bag instead. Very nice, easy to read and good size for keys. A bit on the heavy side but overall as expected."
5.0,"these work very well for blocking blue light. they are a tad larger than my prescription glasses frame and make them a tiny bit heavier, but it does not bother me. no more headaches during long gaming sessions!"
5.0,"Cute dress. Well made. I've washed it twice already and I've had no problems.  It wasn't too short. I'm tall, so I can't wear a lot of short dresses."
5.0,They arrive tomorrow
5.0,"They were exactly as I needed in a 20mm pin, slightly thicker than my others, but fit within the strap."
5.0,"I can't believe you get three of these, I thought I would receive one. They are pretty shiny almost have a white-ish color to them."
5.0,"Picture is spot on for what the glasses look like. Also really nice they each come with a soft case. More for looks them for use, also not the best quality but what do you except for a cheap price. I love them though and wear them all often! They also arrived very quickly."
5.0,"Great product for a great price. I'm so happy to have purchased a couple of these for a recent trip. Texas heat and sun are no joke and protecting our skin is a constant thing.<br />These hats provided the protection needed and then some. The brim is wide enough to cover the neck and depending on the size of the person wearing it it also helped protect part of the shoulders.<br />They are comfortable airy and adjustable. Perfect all around. The top part is a breathable mesh material which allowed air flow.<br />They were definitely life savers! Kept the wearer fresh and protected.<br />Perfect for gardening, yard work or any outside work and especially perfect for outings and pool or beach trips.<br /> The free cool rags were an added bonus! Together they provided maximum protection. Very pleased with the product! Will definitely buy again!"
5.0,I love them so comfortable.
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress! It fits great and the soft, silky material stays wrinkle-free all day. I’ve received many compliments on it. I exchanged the first one I had ordered because the design was mismatched on the top, but it’s replacement is perfect. I plan on ordering the long sleeve version for fall/winter."
5.0,SUPER CUTE! Got one for me and my mom and We both absolutely adore it ❤️
5.0,"I love the way this shirt fits. The material is super comfy, and I’ve actually had strangers compliment me on it. I want like 10 more"
5.0,Bra got here in one day. A record for even Amazon…<br /><br />Bria fits perfectly and is very comfy. So happy with this product that I will soon buy some more Yvette bras.With my wide shoulders I never was able to find anything that fit me. Always have to wear men's shirts because women's sizes just don't work.<br />But the bras I bought from you fit great. Can surely recommend them!
5.0,Son likes these easy for him to put on. He is 5
5.0,I've accidentally jumped in the shower AND the pool wearing one of these. I've literally run it through the washing machine by mistake. And it survived! Eventually the battery pooped out so I bought this replacement. Why wouldn't I? The price is right and I need something that'll hold up to my shenanigans. So far so good. I wish the light was a tad brighter but it gets the job done. Highly recommend.
5.0,"LUV this top!  Style, Color, Fit, Material...All are awesome! Everything went as expected, GREAT SELLER"
5.0,"Super cute ... absolutely love!  Not supportive wear allll day type flops but otherwise perfect. I’m usually a 7 Most brands I always do size 8 this brand and Tory Burch. If you’re 7 or 7.5 , 8 will fit perfect. Love!"
5.0,Great product value for the money. Arrived on time.
5.0,"I love this pendant. For the price, it is costume jewelry at its finest. I love the night sky, and this piece brought it all home to me to wear all the time. I paired it with a shorter chain than the one it came with although I plan to use the longer chain on some occasions. If you are a sky watcher like I am, and if you love to wear sparkles, this is your piece!"
5.0,"For real these are great, very cheab but with great quality, these doesn't look like cheap jewels.. me and my partner are very happy."
5.0,Used for a grooms chair at a wedding shower. Very cute and worked perfect for what I needed for sure!
5.0,Love them but to tight on ankles returning. But very good quality and very nice.
5.0,Looks great. My XL fit me as expected. Hopefully the colors will still pop after a few launderings.
5.0,"These are thin and very long, but worked very well to keep my hair out of my face when running. I have a huge forehead but was able to fold these in a way that I liked to fit my head. I didn't have any problem with slippage. I would suggest washing after each use because they can get pretty drenched with sweat."
5.0,Excellent product. Excellent time respond. And excellent price
5.0,Looks great. Fits great.
5.0,Excellent gift. Beautiful with Gator alum charm on bracelet.
5.0,This fit me a bit large but that is my fault. The material is great and i will definitely purchase again just 1 size down this time.
5.0,"My daughters and I love these for ballet flats, and my girls also wear them with their converse.  Fit well and hold up in the wash well."
5.0,I’ve had these for about 2 weeks now and I’m really happy for this brand. I teach surfing on Maui and this brand is by far the best your money can buy the last pair I had lasted for 4 years of day to day use and these are the same but better the neoprene drys quicker and with a wash bucket and some Wollite and Laundry Sanitizer these will last you for a very long time.  But make sure you dry them thoroughly and flip to drain out water.
5.0,He love them!!!
5.0,"Leggings Depot has excellent quality, fantastic prints & the best prices! Thank you so much! I'm a very happy repeat customer. 😊"
5.0,"The modeling wax is easy to work with, blends out smoothly to the skin and lasts a long time. The color is pretty pale, but once we got blood and paint color added, it wasn't a noticeable difference.<br />I used this to create some scratch wounds on my face, and my sons hand and face. I did not use any spirit gum to create tackiness on my skin, but it still stuck well and lasted until I wiped it off.<br />After applying to my skin, I used some loose powder to set it and with my sons' wounds, I used some liquid foundation to blend it."
5.0,These slippers are adorable… We found them at Walmart almost a year ago and I have continued to buy more pairs. This most recent one was the fourth pair we bought and my daughter just adores them… She wears them all day every day! They are perfect in every way!these slippers are adorable… We found them at Walmart almost a year ago and have continued to buy more pairs.

5.0,"Love it, fits well. I'm 5'3 150lbs. Received wonderful comments."
5.0,I ordered this hat and a one with a slightly different style. Very good looking hat. Fits well. Good quality and very stylish!
5.0,Awesome onesie! Fits like he was born a Skywalker!
5.0,"Loved these earrings.<br />Price was low but quality was Great.<br />Earrings had a little weight to them which is good, didn't know what to expect, would deff buy again."
5.0,My son has 4 daughters and this was just the answer I didn't have to buy separate rings.
5.0,Just really like these eye ware cords as they come in 2 lengths depending on type of glasses 👓 you are wearing<br />At the time—
5.0,Great. These are super cute.
5.0,The right sizes for my granddaughter
5.0,Absolutely loved it. For my bday great. Sadly we lost it at the Route 91 Music Festival but would reorder in a heart beat
5.0,"I had been looking for a nice bralette that has good support and comfy that I can wear around the house and out and about. I was super excited to get this! Super cute and soft material. There are wires along the sides to keep the band from rolling which can be uncomfortable if you're laying on your side, but the support is pretty good for a bralette. I wear a 32D and ordered a small in black and it fits perfect! I did remove the padding, it fit well before and after I took them out but I personally don't like padding so I just took it out. Will be ordering more :)"
5.0,This dress was perfect. Everyone was staring at my daughter
5.0,My new favorite shorts. Love these.
5.0,"This hat and glove set is very nice.  They both fit well and are soft and comfortable.  They have done a good job of keeping my head and hands warm during a recent extremely cold snap.  The gloves have sensors to use with a touch screen and they work as well as any other gloves I have with the touch screen sensors.  Overall, a quality set for a good price."
5.0,I got this for a friend and she loved the style. It is not cheap feeling and it is a great price!
5.0,"Love it, just as per the pictures. Comes with a dust bag."
5.0,"I was very impressed with this pendant/chain/packaging when it arrived, and my wife gushed over it when I gave it to her (it was part of a birthday gift). I asked her earlier tonight what she thought, and she said that she was VERY happy with the ""build quality"" (whatever that means), and that she received compliments the very first day she wore it (and has ever since).<br /><br />So, WE are happy customers, and I'm already eyeing a Paz for her upcoming birthday..."
5.0,"I am pleasantly surprised. I was expecting a cheaply made tie that I may not like. But I liked the design so I took a risk and bought it. To my surprise the tie, tie clip, and cuff links are very good quality! They are not as soft as my Hermes ties, but that is expected. For this price I am very happy with this purchase. I don’t know how they managed to sell it at this price point! Usually a tie clip alone is atleast $10. I am very happy with this purchase and I would DEFINITIVELY recommend. Get it while you can while the price is right"
5.0,"I ordered a small and normally a small fits a little loose in these types of dresses. I am 5'2"" and 128lbs. This dress fit tight through the body. Enough that I had to wear Spanx to smooth out the lines. It is very comfortable and I would recommend this dress 100%."
5.0,Exellent product for the money.
5.0,It is so comfy and cute and has pockets!
5.0,Cheap but good quality. Surprisingly nice case included.
5.0,I love these. They are exactly as pictured!
5.0,Perfect size not too big or too small. Has separate inside zip for small items
5.0,Create dressed for work. Fits perfectly. I am 5’5 Wait 120 pounds. Usually wear a size 4 or six in this fit perfectly.
5.0,"After a lifetime of being teased about my BIG head, I finally found a hat that fits !! Looks well made. Came in an envelope but the U.S. Mail took care of the package very nicely. NOTHING was crushed. I will order more of these Size 8's.<br />The people who make &#34;One size fits all&#34; should be sued by us size 8's, 'cause they do NOT fit us ! :)"
5.0,We use this extensively with kids and found it to be fun and a stress reliever. Holds up well to everything they dish out except the biters. Great idea.
5.0,I absolutely love these! They are very comfortable and are stylish with anything! I totally recommend to anyone looking to spice up an outfit.
5.0,Triple spiral evil eye bracelet. I finally found the exact same one I had for years I bought at a metaphysical shop that eventually broke after 2yrs of wear n tear. Very happy!
5.0,Got pins for book bag and I love them all! Just put three on the book bag for now. Got here quickly!
5.0,The product looks very durable and has a nice thick liner In it. My son may grow out of them after one season... but they are good looking and look very durable.
5.0,I bought these for my daughter to give out to her teachers. It was great!  Loved the selection!
5.0,So cute! Its a little small but i still love it
5.0,I absolutely love these tanks.... I bought 2 more sets of 3!!!
5.0,Hermoso. ....
5.0,"This gold tone necklace came packaged in a white plastic bag inside of a plain but just right blue hard cardboard gift box.<br /><br />The chain is a little thin, but is not brittle and is holding up well.<br /><br />The font on the text ""All too well"" is decently sized which is good because it makes it more legible from a distance.<br /><br />This necklace is simple but looks classy and elegant.<br /><br />Overall, a good price point and I think this would make a great gift for any Swifties!"
5.0,One of my favorite dresses! Comfortable and cute.
5.0,They arrived as indicated. Perfect for small wrist.
5.0,5 stars for quick shipping and beautiful black cat pattern.  4 1/2 stars for corners not finished smoothly. Still great price and free shipping can't be beat. Thanks for the free KeyRing.
5.0,Bought  the shirt  and shorts for my girlfriend.  She loves them.
5.0,The light weight is great for our little man. Good color too.
5.0,"The material of this dress is very high quality and not see through at all. I absolutely love the cut of this dress, I ordered a small and it is a little large on me in the chest and waist area but that is normal for me since I have a smaller check 32A and a very small waist. However being able to tie the dress really helps it to be more fitting to my figure. Love this dress!!! For product reviews please contact me via email at alyssarilea@gmail.com or via Instagram @lyssarilea"
5.0,"This is THE perfect tube dress that can actually be worn with confidence at night or in broad daylight. The outer shell is soft, lightweight, and adjusts to my curves, while the mesh lining is sturdy like light shapewear! The elastic at the top stayed in place all day as I wore it, and I didn't have to adjust my boobs constantly...and, mo cellulite, jiggle or normal imperfections showed through. It looked classy, effortless and sexy. Didn't make me feel like an over filled sack of grapefruits trying to escape.<br /> I haven't washed it yet, so can't confirm it's integrity after the initial wear...they also come indifferent fabrics, I think. I got the olive green on the top row, that's a rayon/spandex blend because I don't like polyester lol!<br /> It fit as expected: I am 5'6&#34;, 137lbs, 34D, 27&#34; waist, 38&#34; hips and I bought a medium, based upon the helpful reviews and photos posted...thanks for being thorough, ladies, it really helps!"
5.0,"We were having a hard time finding shin guards for our 3 year old, these were great. Very pleased with them."
5.0,Awesome for the price. Fit perfect and very comfortable. Might buy another pair for under my board shorts
5.0,Love this turtleneck.
5.0,"I respect Casio Baby-G series as it can survive on children's hands for years!<br /><br />I bought another casio baby-g (not this model) 4 years ago for my daughter when she was 10 and she was wearing it all the time.<br /><br />She treated it badly but still watches were in a pretty good shape until recently one button stopped working.<br /><br />So I decided to buy another casio baby-g!<br /><br />My daughter (she is almost 15 right now) is happy with it, especially when I explained her the meaning of 'high-low' indicator and it's connection with phases of the Moon.<br /><br />Even though this little item is not cheap I would recommend it for children who is not familiar with hummer -- it will survive everything else! :)"
5.0,"I wanted a ring with meaning, was well made, and reasonably priced. This ring hit all the marks. After wearing it for a few weeks now, I have no regrets. The sizing is perfect, it has a great shine, and a nice weight to it."
5.0,PEREFECT
5.0,"Overall it fits perfect. There is a tiny smig of fabric that sticks out by the armpits, but a quick sewing fix did the trick."
5.0,I bought a size small and upon opening the package I thought this dress might be too big. The pattern is stunning ❤ I tried the dress on and It fit perfect!!! I'm on love. My new favorite dress.
5.0,I like that it allows your skin to breathe
5.0,I loved the dress. It fit perfect.

5.0,"Love love love these!!! Underwear shows through a bit, not the color or print, but the seams!"
5.0,Really comfy and well made - no see-through!
5.0,Great alternative to wearing a mask all day. My son works in retail and he’s required to wear a face covering when customers come in. These are great because he can wear around his neck and pull up when needed
5.0,"It's beautiful, fits to size and exactly what I wanted!"
5.0,Nicely cushioned mid weight sock.  Wears very well without developing thin spots.  I got them for golf originally but have quit golf and still wear them all the time.  A good variety of colors.
5.0,I actually really liked this hoodie and felt like the quality and material was good.
5.0,"My 3 year old loves them! The hardest part is convincing him he only needs to wear these when it's wet outside, not when it's  90°F and sunny!"
5.0,Super soft and vibrant in color.  Kids love it!
5.0,Up to date style
5.0,This reversible mesh tank top is really heavy and thick-- super quality. Letters are only on the blue size though.  The seem to run a bit big-- so you are probably a size smaller than your tee shirt size.
5.0,These are so beautiful and I can't wait to wear them on Monday.
5.0,"I was not expecting much, boy was I surprised!  The packaging was impressive enough before opening and there was some weight to it, I was questioning myself as to what it was!  Once I got it opened, I was blown away with the quality of this Scepter!  I cannot express enough the quality and the beauty of it.  Definitely a 10 plus star rating!  Highly recommend and would definitely purchase again."
5.0,Very cute but way too big for my face I’m sending them back
5.0,"These PJs are very soft, comfortable and they look good."
5.0,"Arrived just as pictured.  Perfect gift for new condo owner.<br />Also one of the only new home owner gifts for a single person.<br />Thanks again, Amazon."
5.0,"Purchased size smaller than the size chart recommended. Glad I did, I am 4'8, 140 lbs, 36C/36D bra and the size L worked perfect for me. I typically wear a medium or large in t-shirts. (Short torso). I like my clothes a lot tighter than most people so this size was perfect. I am on the third row of hooks but from day one of wearing I can already tell a difference in my shape and I will be at the first row of hooks in a few weeks! Came on time as well. Will definitely re buy when its tie for a new one."
5.0,I create crochet patterns and I can tell you this is not crochet but rather a knit stitch that uses more than one needle. Crochet is bulkier! But what I can say is it’s true to size and looks super cute. I love it. Thank you for the great sweater and the nice bag for washing it in.
5.0,"As the other reviewer said, it's a beautiful ring and a nice cabochon stone, but the lines in the stone do not show. If I zoom in on the close up photo, I can see the lines, but of course no one will be zooming in on your ring. Nevertheless,  it's beautiful, well made and a good price."
5.0,I love these earrings SO much! They're purrfect! Tons of compliments. I also have very sensitive ears and they don't bother them!

5.0,My Grandson plays football in high school so was pretty excited to get these for his Christmas gift.
5.0,"I have been hospitalized for 11 days with COVID.  During my stay, I had quite a few nurses wearing these.  I was and still am on oxygen and the tubing was making my ears so sore.  While I was still in the hospital the nurses had told me they had all found these on Amazon so I did a search and found this company.  One day after my release they arrived.  I ordered them in 6 different patterns.  Let me tell you what a life saver these are for me.  Not only does my oxygen tubing wrap around the buttons perfectly but my face masks do as well.  They are lightweight, breathable, so comfy and I love every single one of them.  I believe in supporting our small businesses and this purchase could not have been any better.  LOVE LOVE LOVE 10 stars!!!!"
5.0,Just awesome.
5.0,Excellent Backpack!
5.0,"I love this little bag charm. It lights up, looks great and I get many compliments. Shipped fast."
5.0,"Such a well made dress. Fits in every aspect. I'm 5'5, about 165 lbs (fit and curvy haha). 38"" bust, robust hind end lol. I ordered an XL which I normally wouldn't do, but I heard it runs a little small and I wanted it not TOO snug. This size is PERFECT for me. Super duper comfy, length is perfect (above the knee enough to be sassy, but not too short to show too much!). So excited. I ordered the white with turquoise also, and can't wait for that one to come in! I would totally get one in every style!"

5.0,"If you are between a Medium/large --- Go with the Medium.  This is a GREAT dress.  i plan to get another.  It is very ""forgiving"" and super sexy.  I am 184lbs  38/36/40 and I needed a medium.  I ordered the large and it falls off my shoulders."
5.0,I really appreciate the quality of this piece it's very nice and comfortable.
5.0,Great socks for my little one. Material is soft and fits well
5.0,"I'm a 30 something mom who absolutely loved putting this on my car. I ordered it a week before Christmas, so I already removed them for the year. I do intend to use them again next year. My husband isn't a big fan of them, so I won't order another set for his truck. ;)"
5.0,Looks the same as pictured.
5.0,"These are too cute.  They are just a tad small, but have stretch.. so I can get into them.  They are not capri length, a lil longer than that, and I am tall."
5.0,I wear this ring all the time and it still looks great. No defects yet. Great deal
5.0,It is everything it was advertised to be.  It holds all my credit cards and makes them easy to locate when I am shopping.
5.0,What a great concept😊 When you really want to get in there and do some scrubbing. These gloves were great!
5.0,Love it so much I have bought a few!!
5.0,Excellent Product... EXCEPTIONAL WELL MADE!<br />Fit was PERFECT!
5.0,If your working outside or just playing with kids in the snow these pants will keeps you warm and dry you don't need to ware alot under them. Keeps you dry and warm. If you our to much underneath you can get to warm
5.0,They are a great addition to my costume!
5.0,Very comfortable!  I barely notice it there.
5.0,"The jacket has exactly what I needed ;  waterproof and windproof.  I have to take my dog outside, in rain, and wind. Now I am comfortable .  Plus,  and added benefit,  the jacket's color is visible to traffic.  Comfortable.  A little bigger than I expected, butm I can put a sweatshirt under if  it is cold outside, and the jacket will fit."
5.0,These are great!! My almost 7 month old wore them to the Indy 500 and he barely flinched the whole race!! He also didn't pull at them at all. I'd highly recommend these!
5.0,I gave several of the bracelet mates as gifts. They were a big hit. This is the extra hand needed to easily put on bracelets and necklaces without having to ask a friend or family member to help. It's a big frustration reliever!!
5.0,"This scarf is very generous and soft.  The colors are true and it looks great against my winter coat.  It is also large enough to use over the shoulders when a bit chilly in a restaurant or movie theatre.  I purchased 3 of these scarves and plan on using one as a gift.  For the price, they seem to be well worth it."
5.0,Love the fabric and color. Fits as expected
5.0,Great Taco Tuesday Socks. Not very thick but still nice.
5.0,"Soooo soft, well made and flashy! Can’t wait for a Christmas Party so that I can break out these trousers!"
5.0,I bought this ring in rose gold tone and when I opened the packaging I couldn't believe how much this ring looked like 14k rose gold and how bold and fabulous it is. I have 14k rose gold prices. I bought the white version right after! I love this ring. Need I say more?!
5.0,Given as a gift and they loved it.
5.0,"very cute compact purse, perfect for anyone who doesn't need a giant bag. just carries a few things.  can easily hold your phone, passport, small wallet. and some etc.<br /> it very cute shade of pink. it not bright. more of a matte version."
5.0,"I LOVE THIS DRESS!! I got this dress for my daughter's High School graduation. I'm a size 14, so I ordered a large and it was perfect! The material has some stretch, so even if it had been a little small, it would've easily stretched over my chest.<br /><br />I got so many compliments about the dress, I began to worry that I was taking away from my daughter's day. 10/10 would order again!"
5.0,"Really nice looking key fob chains and carabiner. The leather cord is tough and strong feeling. I’m slightly worried about the finish wearing off, but I bought 2 sets just in case. 👍🏼👍🏼"
5.0,Loved this statement necklace. Shipping was fast and it complimented my outfit!
5.0,"This wallet is great!  I went from a leather money clip/card holder to this.  My old one, although quite thin when empty had the unnecessary added bulk between each card.  Since I rarely carry cash anymore the money clip did nothing but increase the size and provide an edge that seemed to grab onto to anything else in my pocket.<br />I tried, unsuccessfully, to shake the cards out of this Minimalist wallet to give myself assurance that they would stay n place.  Needless to say it passed with flying colors. Now I have a smaller, more stylish, wallet than I previously had and with the NFC/RFID protection it is much more secure than my old wallet as well."
5.0,The pictures of the extenders do it no justice<br />Beautifully made<br />Great quality<br />Fit perfect<br />Will definitely buy more<br />And recommend to others<br />Worth it
5.0,Ansoulutly love It

5.0,"My second pair!!  Lots of compliments, very comfortable, even wore this in Spain walking last summer!"

5.0,I think this will be a sweet gift to a precious family expecting soon.

5.0,These are great!  Easier to tie than the original laces and people often comment on them.
5.0,"This fit like a glove, this is a minnie, order your size this my size it looks good but I order another 1 size up so I dont have to pull while all this walk makes it jiggle"
5.0,"Beautiful, great price. A bit heavy...If you ever make a lighter option or a smaller mushroom for a car key ring let me know"
5.0,Excellent product. fast delivery.
5.0,"I really love this blouse! The color is lovely and the material is silky feeling, cool and thin but not see through. Not the highest quality material but just as I expected for the price. And is a perfect summer top! It fits well and has washed well. I have not dried it in the drier."
5.0,It was a gift for me ... BEAUTIFUL
5.0,This shirt is so my father and he's going to love it when I give it to him for Christmas it looks amazing I can't wait for him to get it
5.0,Funciona bien
5.0,It’s stylish and beautiful
5.0,"Fast shipping nice, really impressed. Fits good super cute!"
5.0,Excelentes abrigan súper bien!
5.0,"I was worried about buying this because I was not sure if it was just a cheap knock off.  It's not.  I have purchased this product from the store that typically sells to law enforcement and yes, they sold a good product.  But the price was higher and I had to pay shipping.  I just wasn't sure if this was an authentic product because of some of the reviews but it definitely is.  And yes, you will read of people having problem with the button hole, etc.  Yep!  That's hows this works and always has!!  If you can't handle the button you need to consider a different product but this one is working the way it's supposed to!"
5.0,So please with these haedbands. It is comfortable and colorful. I used it daily. Person with really  big head may have problem using it.
5.0,This is a perfect hat for kids who are outside a lot.  Because it covers the neck there is no need for a scarf!  One less item to loose!  I have one for each of my kids and they love them.
5.0,Good quality better than I thought it would be
5.0,"These give me great sleep by keeping out the light and don't squish my eyes or lashes because they are raised, contoured covers. The material is comfortable and has adjustable strap. A+ Seller"
5.0,LOVE these boots.  Best investment for the winter.  So many compliments.  Super easy to get on and off. I plan to buy other styles.
5.0,LOVE these super comfy yoga pants. They fit like second skin & have pockets.
5.0,I absolutely love this watch band. I was given the opportunity to review this product at a discounted rate and I genuinely love this watchband. When I had been shopping around for different bands before this wasn't originally something I would have bought. The metal has a flat appearance and isn't to flashy but matches well with the watch frame itself. The band doesn't pull arm hairs like other metal bands can. The only thing that is a bit disappointing is that I would need a smaller size if available. My wrist is 6.5 inches around and this band is as tight as it goes. I wear my watch high on my wrist about a fingers width above my wrist bone. I will be buying the black one when I get paid tomorrow.
5.0,I absolutely LOVE these! They are so warm and cozy and fit perfect. They have a bit of stretch to them so they don't get all baggy in the knees and aren't too tight like many other over the knee socks I have purchased in the past.
5.0,"I keep on buying this particular mouse pad, as I love the moon image on it and it lasts for more than 3 years under relatively heavy use. Not everyone wants a round mouse pad, but this is a great choice if you do like them."
5.0,"Nephew loves it, has it on all of the time"
5.0,Love this hat.  Hides the sun as promised.  Well worth the money..
5.0,I wore these as part of my Halloween costume for Little Red Riding Hood. They were perfect for the style I was looking for which was a casual “Mary Jane” shoe. There was a small amount of space to wiggle my toes at the top area of the shoe but not enough to where I couldn’t walk in discomfort. I didn’t mind as I’d be walking a lot trick or treating with the fam bam! Lol They were comfortable for being such simple shoes and they have a Velcro strap on them for a “fake” buckle strap. (Which I loved) because it was soooo simple to put on being 7 1/2 months preggers.  I am a women’s shoe size 6 and ordered the size 4 1/2 from online.
5.0,"We bought 2 of these for a Spirit flight my husband and I recently took.  I must say far more fits into these suitcases than I ever thought would.  We had no problems with Spirit they were the perfect size and other people did have issues because of baggage that was oversized, so we were glad we bought them."
5.0,I got this to replace the green band originally on the watch because I liked its face colorings better and now it is perfect.  Great purchase.
5.0,"This is a beautiful blouse, however it does run large.  I usually end up tying it in front."
5.0,These shirts are adorable. We will wear them on our honeymoon.
5.0,"arrived on time, better in person.  Love it.  Everyone loves it...at work, in the store....strangers love it....haaa...thank you, very happy with it.  I am 5'6 and is a bit long without heels, with heels perfect.  without heels I do not trip because of the front curved shape"
5.0,I have had the entire collection for years and was replacing the red one after it finally had stopped keeping time. These watches are fun and get a lot of attention when worn. They keep excellent time for many battery replacements.
5.0,"I bought this set for my daughter as a Christmas gift. I almost freaked out when it arrived. The top was so small I thought it was a Polly Pocket shirt. Never, ever, did I think this would fit. Amazingly, this set fits perfectly. Very nice fabric, perfect fit, quality material. She is always tugging at her workout clothes as they are always falling down. Not with this set. Love it."
5.0,Reusable face mask it is very comfortable on my face it is breathable it is light weight you can always wash it snd reuse it again it is great for keeping yourself protected from the virus I love this face mask highly recommended
5.0,Keep my feet warm.  Great pair of socks to workout in
5.0,"I love this skirt, its perfect for the office and it is thick and good quality."
5.0,"Comfortable, good fabric, and good price. So happy!"
5.0,Love love love these...Right after my delivery i wanted to go back to my exercise routine..they fitted me perfectly even on my postpartum body...<br />awesome addition to my gym wardrobe :)
5.0,Very nice set. Fits very nice and made well.
5.0,I bought this beautiful purse to wear for an upcoming couples dinner date and it really matches my shoes. It definitely is a rose gold/champagne look depending on lighting. The texture is leather like but to me it felt like the protective foam to protect like delicate things like the purse was in which I actually thought was cool. It's soft not hard to the touch. The packaging was great as well. The purse was securely wrapped. My package came quickly thanks to prime! I received it the next day!
5.0,I'm a plus size girl and this shirt makes me feel so pretty it fits and it's lose and it is airy so it isn't hot material
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for. I went to a shopping mall, and they were charging me around $180 for something similar.<br />This is very good quality, and has an excellent price."
5.0,Great knee highs for the money
5.0,We are excited to always wear Christmas pjs<br />Every year<br />And these hit the spot<br />Super soft<br />Very stretchy<br />Very warm<br />And long lasting

5.0,Love this wallet great size.
5.0,I've been wearing it daily for about 6 months now and it has held up very well. Super cute design
5.0,"Comfortable,  well made.  I really like the grey which seems to not be avalilable now.  The filter pocket is open on both ends which makes it much easier to install filter. I have washed a few of these by hand and they came out fine. It would not be good to put them in the washing machine under any condition because the nose wire would not hold up. Also I have been using masks with nose wires for many years and my experience is to only adjust the nose wire on the first wearing,  continued adjusting will cause the wire to break prematurely."
5.0,It was warm and comfy. Everybody at that party loved the costume. The material isn’t bad as well. Very reasonable price.
5.0,"Great watch, especially for the price. It is a little big, (not the fit, but the size of it on my wrist), but to anyone accustomed to wearing any kind of GPS or Apple watches, it's no big deal. It's a fun pop of color, too."
5.0,"Beautiful, well tailored shirt, can't wait to wear it to the Links !"
5.0,The kids loved them. Came quickly. Thank you.
5.0,"Nice, Airy, but not for me. I would suggest it to my friends."

5.0,"Very pretty, comfortable, and doesn’t wrinkle while traveling! Loved this dress!"
5.0,Like the riveted metal buttons.

5.0,It's a very small keychain but good quality.  My boyfriend loves it.
5.0,Gave this to my daughter-in-law for her birthday and she loved it. She liked that the shoulder strap was adjustable to her length for different occasions.
5.0,Was able to clean shoes I thought were gone for good.  Was so surprised when I started scrubbing and the dirt came right off. 5 stars 100%
5.0,"I love these jackets, got me two for myself and one for my daughter. We're always outdoors and these jackets are great for protection. They are lightweight and super comfortable :-)"
5.0,"Very cute.  A bit more green than I expected, but they look great."
5.0,"I'm 5'6"" and 132 lbs and the size small fit me well. I wrapped the band from the front to the back and then to the front again to make it a small bow with no hang.<br />Loved the fit and the color. Wore it to church and got may compliments. No complaints. I had to wear a strapless bra to suit the boat neck design.<br />I will buy additional colors in the future."
5.0,"These were bigger than I thought they would be, but they are lightweight!  My ears were healing from an allergic reaction so I was nervous about putting these in but I haven’t had any trouble at all!  Overall a great product!"
5.0,"Very comfortable, dries quick after getting wet."
5.0,Good quality and trendy.
5.0,"I love it !!  I order size small is little big, maybe use like XS the color is cool to fresh for hot days 👌🏽"
5.0,My 4 year old loved it
5.0,"I love the sweatshirt! The second I opened the package I new right away This one would be a keeper. It's super soft.  True to size.  I went with a large I usally  ware medium but I like my sweat shirts more baggy/loose fitting  and this one is perfect.  It's not to tight  and not super baggy.  It's not a heavy weight sweatshirt, it's a lighter sweatshirt but the material it's made out of is just as warm as a heavy sweatshirt  I now live in WA state and it will be perfect for the cold rainy wheather we get.😝  Or it can be worn on a cool summer or fall evening. I will for sure be buying another one."
5.0,"I ordered this as a sexy cam outfit. Fits well and is sexy AF whether wearing something or nothing underneath.<br />Material is good, stretches well."
5.0,Can't beat the price.  :)
5.0,"Good quality shirt that looks like it will fit well. Bought as a gift, I think this shirt will be a hit."
5.0,arrived on time and gorgeous!
5.0,I love this top! I just wanted a padded tank top so I don't have to wear regular bras or sport bras that are uncomfortable and show under t-shirts. This is perfect. It's a crop top so no matter how short my shirt are this doesn't show. It's so comfortable and soft. Highly recommend!
5.0,Cute earrings good quality for the price
5.0,"I continue to be impressed by these dresses. For such a low price I never expect a great dress to come out of the packaging when it arrives, but every time I am proven wrong. This dress is a brighter pink than pictured, but that's what I had hoped. The pockets are HUGE, the dress isn't *that* see through, and it was even fairly long, hitting mid thigh on me (i am 5'9&#34;.)"
5.0,Fits very well 💕💕
5.0,"I'm a bun, top knot kind of gal so wearing winter hats is an issue. When I put one on I either had to take my hair down or leave it up, and look like I was wearing a tent on my head. I had seen these type of hats on here, but figured it couldn't look as cute as the pictures. Then I seen a woman at the store rocking one of these. Came home, ordered this and love it. Definitely recommend this hat. The hats hole is made of stretchy elastic and positioned perfectly for any type of updo. I can wear a ponytail and it's a more slouchy look or bun and it fits like a typical beanie."
5.0,Fuzzy inside but not too warm
5.0,I loveed this brand.  Bag was a little small but beautiful.  This was my second big buddha. Def will get another.
5.0,"I have a jacket with lion head buttons on the sleeves in gold.  This necklace matches it perfectly.  Fun jewelry, and the price was amazing.  Delivery was fast."
5.0,Excelent !
5.0,"YAY!  This adorable suit arrived on a perfectly awful, dreary, rainy day and added some much needed sunshine to my day, while I daydreamed about summer!  Only a few more months!  The polka dots are cheerful and fun!  The top and bottoms fit perfectly (although the bottoms are a little snug on the leg openings, so if you have thicker thighs, maybe order up a size?) and I love how the top has a little bit of extra padding to help us flatter chested gals out.  Super comfortable - doesn't pinch anywhere and gives decent support to my chest, but again, I am not a large chested woman.  (38B)  The suit seems to be good quality, and well made.  The colors are exactly as I thought they would be and I can't wait to wear this adorable, retro swimsuit during the summer months.  Such a flattering little bikini!  Its a little more coverage than your average bikini which makes it perfect for a mommy post babies.  It covers up the stretch marks and makes me look sort of cute!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount."
5.0,They are great if you have Diabetes feet.
5.0,This is an amazing top. Got lots of compliments!
5.0,Absolutely love this item! And it was delivered only 3 days after purchase too! (With free standard shipping). The outside is definitely more a sweatshirt feel but the inside is a thin fleece which keeps you warm but not extremely hot which is great!
5.0,So cute....
5.0,Ordered this jersey for our Grandson. The quality is excellent and colors are bright and appropriate.
5.0,"I purchased these for my ten-year-old daughter and they make a perfect complement to any outfit, definitely would recommend them"
5.0,"this thing is really cool, there are tons of different ways to make it, it would be really cool for all those trick or treaters who can say this is my lightsaber, no one elses looks like this.<br /><br />i must say i really wish there was a way to make a purple blade cause mace windu was a hoss and everyone wants to be him.<br /><br />i recommend it for all those are immaginative and love Star Wars."
5.0,Great quality and sizing is right on
5.0,"My wife [Who is very picky.]  is completely happy with these earrings.  I've noticed that she swears them very often. It's the wright balance of style and uniqueness, that I like to give to her.<br />Happy wife Happy home."
5.0,"Nice, strong ring."
5.0,"This sweater fits true to size, and the color, proportions, weave, and fit are as shown on the sales page. The yarn is mid weight and fully synthetic, so it won't shrink or fade, but won't breathe and will be prone to pilling ( I have a shaver). The weave is somewhat open, which I like, especially in synthetic fiber sweaters."
5.0,Nice costume...fast delivery
5.0,El traje es muy lindo y cómodo.  Queda un poco abierto al frente.
5.0,This charm was exactly what I wanted for someone who sells perfumes and cosmetics!
5.0,"Fits a little small, but I love it!"
5.0,"True to size, sexy and definitely worth it. Great strong material!!! Don’t hesitate!! Seriously!"
5.0,"comfortable , love it"
5.0,"Love this dress.<br />Sadly it's a little too long for me (nothing new) and to take it up it'll lose the curve of the hemline but it's a great fit, nice looking and will be perfect for summer outings or travel.<br />Comfy, soft material, nice flow...<br />Will work for casual or nice outings too."
5.0,"I have found the perfect hat to paint en plein air.  Not to hot, sun protection, adjusts to fit perfectly and has a feminine flair. Thank you."
5.0,I changed into that for after I got tired of wearing the dress
5.0,comfotable and effective.
5.0,"I'm 5'3, weigh about 115 lbs and size small fit almost perfectly but it was a little loose. This dress is just as lovely in person and the material is nice and thick."
5.0,It’s beautiful and exactly what I imagined.
5.0,Its super<br /> The zipper starts to not clasp well and stay zipped at top after a few wears. Great find.
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful. Stunning. Sort of delicate, so I ended up giving it to my granddaughter. She loved it. She's seven."
5.0,Even better than I anticipated the quality passed my expectations its so sturdy and realistic looking diamonds for the price
5.0,"I ordered the tortoise color and am very pleased with the fit and style of these sunglasses. It looks retro without looking too obviously hipster - the effect is more subtle than other retro glasses I've worn (For example, Cat's Eye sunglasses). They come with a black faux leather case (envelope style) and cleaning cloth. The quality is very good and they look more expensive than the actual price. They also deflect strong sunlight as well (It has UV400 protection). Overall I have no complaints."
5.0,This charm is large and beautiful! It was perfect for my grand daughter's charm bracelet as she loves gymnastics.  I bought another gymnastics charm but it was way too small! This one is perfect and arrived on time!!
5.0,These underwear have lasted a long time<br />Super cute patterns
5.0,"Comfortable, no riding up or falling down while I was running and the quality appears to be well crafted and the pants won't have holes anytime soon.<br />I ordered the pink /purple floral capris and in my experience the picture is a true representation of their actual color and pattern. Most of my workout leggings are black so these are a welcome pop of color.<br />I ordered large and possibly could have gone down a size but these are the best fit for me.<br />I am 5'6, 170lbs, 31&#34; waist and wear 8/10 pants"
5.0,"I am so impressed with your beautiful jewelry! it was perfect and you even included a gift bag, and note card, and jewelry cloth. The box it comes in is wonderful.  I want to thank you for the wonderful attention to your jewelry and sales. You're worth every penny and I will tell others about you!! I promise that."
5.0,More of a smaller purse than a wallet
5.0,"These are very soft, close-fitting and comfortable. Liked so much, I ordered more."
5.0,Very very very nice pair of sunglasses. For the cost it's excellent and very ideal. I bought them for my wife and she absolutely loves them. Definitely going to get me a pair in the orange color. It's a must get! Very reasonable prices as well.

5.0,This is a beautiful piece of jewelry. I love it.
5.0,"Good product, easy to identify luggage."
5.0,"They're tight for the first wear, but as they wash and wear they're going to be just right. The pockets are minimizing and I feel like I don't even have my phone in my pocket."
5.0,"Great fit. Soft and very comfortable. Cheeky style, very flattering. Style is as pictured on description."
5.0,"My Burei arrived on time and well packaged. The watch looks far more expensive than its true cost. No problem with the watch however I was a little clumsy when trying to shorten the band.  First side went smooth as silk, the second side I decided best to consult a jeweler.  Would I buy it again, yes I would."
5.0,MY WIFE FELL IN LOVE WITH DRESS. AFTER SHE PUT IT ON SO DID I. BEAUTIFUL..
5.0,"I'm usually L, that's what I ordered, but the top was baggy, so I'm just going to hem it, but otherwise it's a very nice dress, looks perfect for running errands in"

5.0,I love it someone need to try this glasses
5.0,Adorable dress. Lots of bang for 29 bucks. Great!!!
5.0,"unlike some other masks this style, this one has sticked edges and is made out of a decently thick material. it breathes well and is very comfy to wear. I was pleasantly surprised to find it came with an elastic cord that will cinch to hold it snug to your face. Thanks to the cord it never falls or slips, but I need to be careful about pulling the cord too tight, as the pressure can get uncomfortable quick. My voice is not muffled, and even blowing hard, I have to basically touch the mask before I feel it on my hand.<br /><br />My family and strangers at the grocery store were spooked and delighted by the design."
5.0,Great product really like it! Would recommend this to anyone who’s lookin for a nice band
5.0,very cute and fit my head perfect :D Would recommend!~<br />I get alot of compliments from it too :) ~!<br />11/10 ;)

5.0,Received many comments and compliments on these festive conversation heart earrings. Nice size and easily visible by others.
5.0,"I was in the need of more sock, and these worked great. They were very comfortable and fit well. (shoe size 10/11). They are soft and form fitting. I have yet to notice any substantial shrinkage in the wash, and they seem to be of high enough quality not to break or fall apart, atleast before numerous wears.<br /><br />I would recommend them for the comfort."
5.0,I bought this earring holder for my sister-in-law and she loves it! It is perfect for her earrings and she doesn't have to search for matches anymore.  It is also attractive to have out on the counter.

5.0,The Santa suit was not disappointing. Glad I purchased this suit. Good quality and will last for years to come. My husband is a larger man so I was afraid it would not fit but it was great. Did our novelty christmas cards and will be using for other things.. like seniors hospital visit at christmas. Best part was it didn't need any add ins as this came with absolutely everything. Highly recommend.

5.0,"I have sensitive ears but when I saw this earrings , the rose looks very real , like frozen in water , I decided to treat myself anyway and I can only wear them occasionally because of my sensitive ears but got lots of compliments and they are just as advertised,nice workmanship too"
5.0,Es muy lindo!
5.0,"This was a wonderful petticoat. For the price, I am very glad I bought it for my dress. It really made the difference and it is made out of great material that did not feel cheap. I would recommend this to anyone who needs one. Its cheap, fast shipping, and great quality."

5.0,I love this hat!  I love hats!
5.0,I bought this after losing my Oakley Nanowire sunglasses.  I needed something that would stay put while running which these have gone perfectly.  I also wanted something with similar styling to the expensive Oakleys but didn't want to spend $300 again.  This fit that very well with one exception: they are heavy.  If you are coming from designer light weight sport sunglasses you will notice the weight difference of these.  Overall these are great and I recommend them 5/5.
5.0,"The tint is perfect the color is perfect, I really enjoy them!"
5.0,These are great for yoga. The material is soft but comfortable. I have multiple pairs and I love them. I am wearing the charcoal in xs and the green is a small. I prefer working out in the xs and lounging in the small.

5.0,Cute and good price👍
5.0,This is the softest robe I've ever felt! It feels just like those expensive extra soft fleece blankets. It has 2 pockets which is a huge plus for me & a hood. As far as how it fits...it is a bit small for me. I'm a southern &#34;thick&#34; girl & the robe doesn't wrap around my hips entirely so I have to hold it closed with my hand when anyone is around. The robe goes down to my knees & the sleeves are very long as well.I ordered the gray color & it's a beautiful silver color. I very highly recommend this

5.0,"This wallet is a huge value both in terms of quality and price point. There is little that I can add to the many positive reviews but I will admit that it does have a smell that is clearly not pleasant but I was able to mitigate it by not sticking it up to my nose for a sniff. I suspect that the smell won't last for long.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed."
5.0,It was a little small I returned it for a bigger  size. Cannot wait for the new size. Beautiful materal
5.0,Was a little tight but a beautiful color looked great at my ring ceremony.

5.0,It’s a great swiss watch
5.0,"Everything as expected, would buy again"
5.0,I ordered this to wear as a cardigan to pair with leggings & a t-shirt or tank. The colors are vibrant & look so pretty & can be worn with so many different colors. Love!!! Love!!! Love it
5.0,"They do scratch easily, but that's because I cycle 15 miles a day to & from work, and I think dust & pebbles might hit the lenses from time to time (since I live in the desert). Besides that, since the glasses came with a lens cleaning & protective bag, I'm able to use these glasses for a much longer period of time compared to others that get scratched up in my pocket or backpack without a protective case."
5.0,My toddler hasn’t figured out how to get these off yet! 😀
5.0,Nice piece that attracts compliments and a chance to tell people about Shungite.  Have not tested the piece and assume it is as advertised.

5.0,"I'm an essentialist when it comes to my handbags and I don't like to carry a big purse.<br />I purchased this bag in navy because I didn't have any bags in that color.<br />I must say that this bag packs a bug punch for a small bag.<br />There is a convenient little wallet area in the front for all my credit cards. Then inside is a nice wide opening for my phone, key, pen, lip gloss, etc...<br />There is also a zip pocket where I put my other little items such as hair bands and on the other side is a pocket for cash or receipts.<br />I will be purchasing in another color very soon."
5.0,"This is a good thing I've got here. Soft as can be, really feels good to get out of the shower dry off and slip into my robe so cuddly and warm. I can cover my head and no monsters can find me. It is great!!"

5.0,"This dress is absolutely perfect. Great material, not too thin, but still breatheable and light. It's very flattering."
5.0,"Perfect dress. Size fits perfectly, the dress could fully show my curve and the material looks like the images, well cutting. It is super cute for the butterfly knot design and wavy hem. The dress is not over solemn. It is comfortable for the all day wearing. I supposed to go to a formal party on it and everyone love my dress. I got lots of compliment. Also, I wear it to work. My co-workers want me to share the link LOL. Highly recommend it, very flattering and I believe you would like it too."
5.0,"I got this ring about a week ago and i love it, its very pretty and im glad I ordered it."
5.0,Fits perfect just what I needed
5.0,My 10 yr old daughter needed masks for school and picked these out. She LOVES THEM! She actually doesn't mind wearing these! Super breathable and stylish. I've already bought several for her.
5.0,These are just beautiful! I love the quality and craftsmanship of these little drop pendants. They'll be gorgeous on my hand crafted jewelry. Will buy more soon.
5.0,Perfect for big or small women<br />Yes yes
5.0,"Product arrived as described by seller.Used for sleeping and indoor wear.Lightweight,soft material.Good price.Thank you"
5.0,"For my first NATO I wanted something comfortable and of high quality but at the same time and expensive. I looked around at Barton, Ritchie, Blushark before finding Wornikoff. What first attracted me to the strap was the photos of the hardware. In person they are no different, very substantial and very high quality. The pin for the holes it thick and fits into the groove on the buckle perfectly. The buckle is beveled at the corners and also has a channel on the underside that allows the strap to sit flatter. The floating is great as it allows you to adjust but also position the excess strap under wrist rather than on the side. The nylon is soft and pliable, but seems durable as well. Also, the holes and end are sealed as to prevent fraying. Overall, it’s just a smart design. I guess my only complaint would be the lack of color options. It would be great to see more patterns in the future. Even then the sapphire blue matches perfectly with the dial of my orient! To you Mr. Wornikoff, I say your straps are amazing."
5.0,"This shirt has a lot going for it.<br />Most importantly, it fits!<br /><br />I selected this shirt knowing that nowadays a large regular fit shirt can vary a great deal in size. Often, a large is what was not long ago a medium size.<br />I figured if the shirt was too small for my husband I could wear it as an oversize top myself. But it does fit him, and is roomy enough that a little shrinkage won't make it unwearable.<br />(The fabric is 100% cotton, and the product description does claim that ""the shirts are water processed to ensure no shrinking."")<br /><br />The shirt is well-made and traditionally styled as a casual woven shirt, with a button down collar, and one chest pocket.<br />The pocket is situated a little lower than I would prefer.<br />The shirt is long enough to stay tucked in.<br /><br />I chose the red buffalo plaid style for my husband. We like the pattern, and were happy to find it available in a shirt that is not the traditional long-sleeve flannel lumberjack style.<br /><br />The shirt is reasonably priced at the time of this review. It's a great summer shirt, breathable and brightly colored; you could call it ""lumberjack lite."""
5.0,"I have to say that this is the most vivid green I have seen in some time. I have also received the black and white one too -- they are so comfortable. I find the colors vivid, the material is lightweight and practical. I am 5 foot tall and it goes to just above my ankles. I usually wear it over my pajamas as I figure this is perfect for summer and privacy among a house full of teenage boys.<br /><br />I think this is fun to wear -- and my mom agrees too since she received the black and white one. The colors really are vivid and it is hard to feel depressed while wearing these stylish colorful kimono. I am sure that this would be appropriate to wear out of the house too. It is so unfussy -- great for work too!"
5.0,Really nice necklace. Thanks
5.0,"I love Ann Arbor T-shirts, and this one is very nice as well. It is high quality, and fits nicely. The arm holes are a bit bigger than usual with all my other Ann Arbor shirts, but I still love it."

5.0,These shoes are great!
5.0,So many colors! I have all the colors I need to match up with my daughters outfits.
5.0,Perfect color and very comfortable a little long but cute for a tshirt dress.
5.0,"This product is great fit true to size, lots of stretch but very comfortable"
5.0,"Great joggers! They look exactly as advertised. They're a super soft fleece like material but it's not thick fleece. It's very thin so you don't get too hot. I'm 5'7"" and between 135-140lbs and I got a medium which fits great! The length is great--goes down to the ankles. I'm ordering others in different colors, but this time I might get a small because the crotch area does seem to have a little extra fabric bc I don't have a butt."
5.0,"Great quality, cane packaged well, not a bad price."
5.0,"I really liked the fit, cse I bought it a bit big, so I can wear a light jacket under if need it. Definatly ordering more for christmas gifts.thank you."
5.0,"great quality. was asked 3 times ""where theyre from"" by ""lululemon girls"""
5.0,"I’ve been wearing the Ritche Seatbelt Nato for a little over a week and I must say it has been a treat. I wasn’t a huge fan of nato style straps/bands but this one changed my mind.<br /><br />It is comfortable, has more adjustability than the Ritche Premium Nato (which is also high quality), and looks great."
5.0,"Arrived exactly as described. one never knows when ordering not directly through amazon. The picture does not do justice to this coat. It is so light weight (you can easily stuff it into a carry on on your flight from the cold to the tropics), yet warm and flattering. I usually get compliments every time I wear it. This is my staple winter coat."
5.0,"These are beautiful bracelets at a great price! Looks and feels so substantial, looks like it cost way more than it did, and makes a lovely present, in a little drawstring bag. Perfect for animal lovers young and old! Quick, accurate service too!"

5.0,Worked great for my husband on our around the world trip. No worries about info being stolen.
5.0,Loving it!!!color is cool and fitting is perfect!<br />I would recommend this dress for small parties !
5.0,"Size was what I was looking for and this necklace definately delivers.  Sheen and glow appear increasingly evident as the pearls are worn about the neck and absorb oils from the skin.  I wear this strand coiled once around my neck and I get an impressively big, and obviously natural strand(s) of what looks like -real- Tahitians (because of the pearl size).<br />The pearls are somewhat potato baroque but not so much that their sense of the round and circular (o) on the strand is lost.  I'd prefer more luster but heck for less than $100.00 this is a steal. Really!  I know my pearls."
5.0,Great quality tie! Perfect for my event.
5.0,Shirt is adorable. It's a bit big but super cute for the price. I would definitely buy again.
5.0,"The pics make it seem that way, but It’s not pajamas- which was great for our Disney trip. Our daughter was comfy and fashionable :)"

5.0,I bought this bag for my daughter.  She loved how roomy it is.  She just packed for a weekend and informed me she was even able to add her pillow inside.  Great price too!
5.0,"I really like this tank top.  It has a cute graphic, was a nice color, and the material was soft.  Pretty much everything you could ask for.  I've worn it to work outside in the garden and it was long enough that bending over, etc. wasn't much of an issue.<br /><br />Washing it worked well, it went through normal wash/dry cycles with no issues, fraying, fading, etc.  For sizing, I ordered a medium and it fit well, just a bit big and it didn't shrink any in the wash.  But not enough out of range that I would worry about it, sometimes baggy is good.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2021"
5.0,My husband loved that it  close
5.0,Perfect fit. Looks really well on.
5.0,Fit perfect! Great quality! The softest tank ever!
5.0,"Good quality and really provides leg support for a long time. I use it for work, about 13hrs"
5.0,"I have thick thighs and these don't fall down at all. Given that they have a slight tightness around the top to keep them up, I can get a little muffin top at the top of my thigh, but nothing crazy. Very cute and perfect for my Baby Spice costume."
5.0,Fantastic product. Loving it!
5.0,"I have had mine for 5 years, and now I have purchased 2 for my children as a right of passage.  These are awesome necklaces, heavy, and reassuring. The cord is great and adjustable for different sized neck or wear you choose to wear it.  I wear mine every day, as sorta a profession of faith, as me and My family follow the law of the pack."
5.0,"Cute, but they didn't look good on me, I sent them back."
5.0,"Loved this bag!  It is a great size, and seems well made.  I bought it as a donation for foster kids to use when they move from house to house.  I like that it was very large and able to carry a lot.  It can also be folded back into a small pouch. It had two types of straps, and included an outer pocket.  Zipper seems sturdy.  All of the prints are adorable.  We bought two different ones."
5.0,What can I say? SAXX is a very comfortable brand. Does what it's supposed to do.
5.0,"I love these slippers for summer! They are light, comfortable and airy."
5.0,The most beautiful top I owb!

5.0,My Grandson just loves this outfit and it fit him just perfectly!  Nice quality!
5.0,"Nice sports bra. I'm a 36c bought a medium. I like that it's little bit higher in the front. So while doing yoga or cross training, that require bending down it does not feel like your chest is going to pop out of it. Very secure and pretty!"
5.0,These are very nice socks and at a great price.  They are not incredibly thick but the softness and sturdiness of the ankles made me overlook that.  I will definitely purchase these again as I am not liking the price increase and durability decrease my normal Hanes black women's socks have been going through.
5.0,"Really tight when new. Once it breaks in, you never have to worry about cards falling out again. Easy to use, organize and fit in a front pocket. No worries about getting wet with your wallet in your pocket. You wont have to worry about damaging a wallet unless you get run over! I ordered the raw aluminum because it does not show scratches. Many compliments any time I take my wallet out."
5.0,large fit. but the boys love them
5.0,I love this dress. It is so soft and comfortable. It is perfect for the office and so comfy to wear all day.  I did take the advice from other reviews and ordered a size up. Glad I did. I will be ordering more colors.

5.0,Nice looking key chain. Good quality overall husband was pleased.
5.0,"This band is beautiful and durable I purchased 2 the iridescent and black, I already own a silver one that I spent way too much for. Comparing these to the original silver one I have, they are slightly thinner and lighter in weight. However, this item is durable, stays attached, doesn’t irritate your skin and most of all beautiful.  I’ll upload some pictures soon.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend purchasing all colors, which is my plans in the nearest future. Don’t sleep on this ladies and gentlemen."

So when i got tired of trying the scope i took it off so i saw a squirrel outside at my moms bird feeder i got the cartrage with loaded pellets and shoot fall it fell strait to the ground i went out and it was wobaling around so i loaded one and shot him in the head he was dead then i gutted him and ate him i didnt really like it tho cuz they have a unique flavor witch i dont really like but this is a good gun just dont buy it on amazon buy it at walmart.
5.0,My daughter was so excited to wear these nightgowns to bed she had a hard time choosing which one to wear first. They fit perfectly and are so soft and comfortable.

5.0,Purchased for the first time and will definitely purchase again.  This jewelry cleaner is fabulous. It made my diamond rings sparkle like crazy!  Great product!
5.0,"Purchased and shipped this to my granddaughter. She loved it and thought it was a creative way to celebrate her big day. With the coded bead design, she will also be able to enjoy wearing it beyond her 18th year unlike some others I saw which contain more obvious ""18"" charms and would have been too frilly for her taste."
5.0,"I love the material, it's soft and form fitting to the figure. The color is perfect for any season."
5.0,Works well for.what I wanted. Hats allow.sweat to.run down this one absorbs

5.0,"Absolutely LOVE this top!! I was hesitant because I don't do a ton of online shopping but I'm so happy I gave it a go!! The shirt is very flattering as well as comfortable. I'm usually a M-L because I don't like things too tight. I ordered a medium and it fits PERFECTLY! It's form fitting but still loose enough to throw on with yoga pants. I highly recommend this top!! I'll be ordering more colors! I did NOT get a discount for my review, just one girl to another. Hope this helps!!"
5.0,My daughter loves this tutu! Super sparkly and fluffy. Great buy for the price.
5.0,"This locket exceeded my expectations. The durability and design are satisfactory for the $10 price tag. While they provide a good amount of chain, I would have preferred a more sturdy one. But hey, it's only $10 so I can't complain."
5.0,I'm impressed.  They happen to fit my glasses very well. They have a nice look. I would by another set.
5.0,"Good material, has pockets"

5.0,Fit okay design looks kinda wacky when they are on..

5.0,Just what I wanted!  Bold color and perfect fit!  Will be wearing throughout the Fall season.
5.0,"I wear a 7.5 shoe and these were perfect. They work well with ballet flats and don’t usually show, but if they do then the cute lacy design looks nice"
5.0,"These glasses are adorable! I mainly got these for fashion purposes, but I figured that if I ever needed a replacement glasses, I could always ask my eye doctor to pop out the lenses and put in my corrective lenses. I didn’t really know if this was going to look good on my face since few glasses do in my opinion. I find that glasses that are tiny or really round make my face look rounder which is not the look I’m going for. Usually oversize glasses are perfect for my face, however, I was worried that these were still going to be too small for my face.<br /><br />Thankfully, this complimented my face and I really like how it looks! It’s not really bulky and it matches well with any outfit. It feels of pretty good quality and I’m really enjoying these. It also came with its own cloth carrying case which I liked."
5.0,[[VIDEOID:cbb2fdf5d6c95f71ac0a6e944dce7604]] Me encanto
5.0,Product as pictured. I gifted them and very satisfied with this product.
5.0,For one use only. They fade really quick.
5.0,Perfect!! It was exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,"Super cute, great quality. Used for toys and activities for airplane. Held a 360 cup in the pocket!"
5.0,This is a very nice cellphone holder. Fits perfect for IPhone 6s plus. Purchased a second one as a gift. Have received many compliments. If you want a bling cellphone holder that can be worn crossbody I would recommend.
5.0,Lanyard for college football cornhuskers in pink
5.0,Nice quality and good chain.<br />Bought for my little granddaughter who lives it.
5.0,"I bought the royal blue (beautiful color!) for my son.  He's 6'1&#34; 180 pounds with an athletic build, and the medium fits just right (not at all bulky or boxy).  He has long arms and often shirt sleeves are a little short, but that's not a problem with this one.  I washed and dried it before he even tried it on, so I'm not sure how much it shrank.  Thick and warm.  Great value!"
5.0,Me quedo pequeña en el busto
5.0,Way better then the cheap &#34;coilover&#34; keychains you can buy. It's so cool being about the adjust the perches and spring. Exactly what I wanted and great gift for any car guy
5.0,Nice Franciscan cross for the money! Good sturdy string comes with it. Need to take extra care with it as it is a very delicately built cross.
5.0,really like the boot .
5.0,Well made bible cover. I haven't had to wash yet so I hope it doen't shrink. Love the colors and the extra pockets.
5.0,The socks arrived on time and are very cute.<br />I can't say anything about the quality because I gave them as a gift.
5.0,I absolutely love this band! It is by far the best band I have ever owned! Comfortable to wear 24/7! I LOVE the camo pattern! Will be ordering more!! You cannot beat the amazing price either!
5.0,Arrived on time and was exactly as described. Stone color is perfect
5.0,I really love this product. It's very pretty and it looks actually like the picture. Not to mention great service !
5.0,Cute but they run small. Bump up.
5.0,"This shirt is so cute! It fit as expected and I get compliments on it all the time! I have washed and dried and there was no shrinkage. The flowers still look just as good as they did on the day I got it! Not only is this shirt a great price but it fits so well and looks really great. I will say that the V in the neck does cut semi-low on me, but I am 5'3 and have a short torso, so if you are someone that is conscience about cleavage you may want to wear a shirt underneath."
5.0,"Very nice period looking pin. In fact, I'm still not sure whether this is an actual piece of marketing material originally distributed by the Indian Motorcyxle company or just a replica. I actually don't own an Indian but I do ride and I have several bikes. In my opinion, there has always been only three brands that the biker community considered to be true to the lifestyle and those three are Harley Davidson of course, Triumph and Indian."
5.0,"I have multiple colors, they're very comfortable. I'm 5'0, 157 lbs, I ordered Large, it's too long for my height I had to adjust the length with my sewing machine, it fits loose, that's how I like it, if you're a conservative woman, be aware that you'll need  to wear a slip under it."
5.0,Books came in perfect condition
5.0,I absolutely love this anklet! It is so delicate and feminine. I love the rose gold color! It will make a beautiful gift!<br /><br />I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review.
5.0,"Soft, airy, stylish, excellent fit, not too long which is great!"
5.0,Perfect lightweight dress for summer - work or party - can be dressed up or down. I believe it fits true to size or a little big but I found it flattering. I am 5’4 and 210 lbs purchased an XL in Navy-04. I can not wait to wear it again and again !!
5.0,"These r warm, and fix perfect"
5.0,This ipurchase exceeded my expectations.  The amount of items that can be included in this tote is amazing.
5.0,Bought this for a lady friend. fit wonderfully. I was so happy and it was so cool seeing the pants fit with R2D2 design.
5.0,"I reordered this dress in a L after i ordered too big (XL) on the first one (oops) and it came in fast! It wasnt see through which was amazing and went with our casual disneybound as starwars characters (I went as Padme from Attack of the Clones)! It was surprisingly warm, and it wasnt too short, I could still bend over without showing my butt to everyone!!!<br /><br />Listen to the comments and order your size, too big or too small will be a difference!<br /><br />A small warning is that it does tear a little easy, I put a celebrating pin on my shirt from disney and it created a little hole, nothing I can't cover up somehow but that did leave me worrying that I would get caught on something else and tear it in other areas :("
5.0,Great colors and for for young competitive swimmer.
5.0,I wear a 42R sleeve on my jackets. This is pretty comparable in the waist and chest. It's a little difficult to raise your arms above your shoulders in the front (like if you were trying to reach for something on a shelf right in front of you). I'd recommend a size large if you're like me on the medium/large spectrum.
5.0,"This product is beautiful and the shipping was fast. I just got it and good price, I love it already."
5.0,My daughter dressed up as Peter Pan so I decided to dress up as Peter Pan's shadow.  Suit stretched nicely so was easy to put on and I could see (and breath) pretty good.
5.0,Very cute bows.  Perfect fit for my 4 year old.
5.0,Cute sugar skull band. Comfortable and decent quality.
5.0,"Fair price, easy to install,  fits as it should"

5.0,Fits to my phone perfectly. I love the color. I've had it for a couple months now and dropped my phone a few times and got no cracks. Very satisfied with this product!
5.0,This shirt is awesome. It's got two thick layers so I'm able to just wear the shirt without anything under. Nothing is showing through. It fits perfectly and is true to size! Definitely an every day shirt that I will continue to wear. Really happy and surprised withthe quality.
5.0,My daughter loved the fit and color
5.0,My son loves his PJs! They are soft and cozy. Just as expected.
5.0,Love the different sizes
5.0,These socks are prefect for Friday nights lights.  Even after double overtime my feet felt great.
5.0,Awesome! I love it! :)
5.0,I just went back to see if there was a long sleeve version and I’m excited to see there is! I have worn this dress every week since purchasing it and it washes and hangs up and looks fantastic. I have worn it tied and down. Both with sandals and casual tennis shoes and it works great. I will wear the long sleeve one to work on Friday’s for fall. I have no idea how it’s getting low reviews unless I got something totally different. It’s comfy made well washed well and had some stretch to it.
5.0,I’m 5’1” and 190 pounds and ordered the plus size. I definitely could have ordered the regular size and been fine.
5.0,Great stuff of highest quality materials. Will be back.
5.0,"The best ties. Get them, won't regret. And beautiful colors."
5.0,perfect for pre schoolers.
5.0,"Wow, prettier than expected! The chain is simply beautiful! Photos do not do the shine justice!"
5.0,I love this PJ set it’s very comfortable

5.0,Thanks  I'm  glad that all my orders are complete

5.0,I'm am enjoying this product that I purchased awhile back. Love the look.
5.0,FANTASTIC. A quality product for a bargain price!
5.0,Work great for an adult male.
5.0,"I bought the black patent shiny Mary Janes for my daughter to wear with her Halloween costume and also during special occasions / dress attire during the holidays. My daughter is almost 6 years old and wears a size 12.5 in little kids, so I ordered a size 13 for her and they fit very nicely. They are very well made, and she says they are very comfortable and cozy. Despite my ordering them for her to wear only during special dress up days,  she loves them so much that she likes to wear them almost daily. I highly recommend these shoes!"
5.0,The tights are for my young nieces. They have matching Thsnksgiving dresses and the tights are perfect combination. They live in Holland Michigan so their little legs will be protected from the elements. The size fit both girls. Thank you.
5.0,"This was a Valentine's Day gift for my wife, and she liked it (and that's what really counts).  She's 5'7&#34; 125 pounds and looks great in the size medium."
5.0,Cute hasnt faded :)
5.0,"This is a great light to medium weight jacket. Very cozy for 50 deg F, or short periods of 40 deg F"
5.0,"What a great deal!! Exactly as described, I loved these headbands so much.. They were perfecf"
5.0,So cute but not very flattering on me.
5.0,"I’m obsessed with! I’m 5’7 but very leggy , the inseam can ruin a pants look like these, but these are LONG ENOUGH  !!! Finally! With heels on they won’t hit the ground, or room to be hemmed if needed. They are so soft & comfy, ordered another pair already."
5.0,"A little big, could have ordered a size smaller. regardless, it worked perfect. Great quality for the price. Very satisfied!"
5.0,Great workout shirt. Free range of motion for lifting
5.0,I feel much safer walking with my dogs at night now that I have these lights.
5.0,I got this ring  for my wife she needed a ring for her middle finger she is delighted it fits well and looks good
5.0,This is a great buy and they feel so soft. You can't go wrong.
5.0,"I have 3 other pairs of Bandolino pumps. All 7 1/2. In this case, they were too small. I had to send them back and order size 8."
5.0,I love this dress so much!!! Buy it now. It’s so flattering. The material is thick not thin. Fabric hangs nicely.
5.0,"I love love these shoes!!! Super comfortable, gotten tons of compliments. I have a wide foot and size 7 1/2...I ordered a size 39 and it was a perfect fit!! Planning on ordering another pair.<br />Side note...getting them took a little longer that expected...BUT since I wasn't in a hurry, I didn't mind the wait."
5.0,Cute bag and fast delivery thanks !!!
5.0,"I bought this pack of masks because I liked the color combinations. They are all blues and thus can be worn by male or female. They are three layers and have an adjustable nose clip. The ear loops are also adjustable for a comfortable fit. In addition, I like that you can put a filter in the pocket of the masks which is a good feature. I think these masks are comfortable and breathable.. I have washed these masks several times, and I let them air dry as others I bought in the past shrunk when I put them in the dryer. Air drying works very well! (This is my HONEST opinion. I was not paid nor compensated in any way for this review.)"
5.0,I'm all about comfort. Could have gone with bigger size
5.0,"OMG I love this dress! I assumed it would run large so I got a medium. I normally wear a size 6. I should have gotten the small. High quality material and such cute pattern. It fit a little loosely around the waste for me, so again, should've gone a size down. Gonna be looking for more dresses by ROMWE."
5.0,These work get and was easy to install.
5.0,Great! Fits very good!
5.0,You may get one that isn't perfect but the price is so affordable you can't complain. I love these bows. They don't leave an indentation in daughter's head and are very sweet looking. You can use them for dressy or casual outfits. Order in advance becuase they take about 2 weeks to arrive.
5.0,Yasssss
5.0,"My calves are not that big. They're average sized, but they are always suffocated by the bottoms of capri yoga pants, even sometimes spilling out at the bottom like an upside down muffin top. It's not comfortable and not cute! I thought that's just how they all are. Nope! These are perfect! They fit snug everywhere else, just like other yoga pants, except there is extra room in the leg openings. Yay! Finally.<br /><br />I bought black with red logo on leg, black with white logo on leg, and the plum color with white logo on leg. I highly recommend!"
5.0,"Good fit, looks great and very comfortable."
5.0,Very fun for your MINECRAFT gamer. She loved them. They matched perfectly with the Creeper Hoodie.
5.0,This is a must have nursing bra! I searched and searched and everything was so uncomfortable. I like that the cups are super soft and the padding is thin but thick enough to give you good coverage. I also like that the strap when you clip down is thin and not irritating. It isn't a beautiful bra but this is the only bra I will be wearing while nursing!
5.0,This is so great I love this thing. It's so soft and magnificent. Cozyyyyy... XD
5.0,"They fit everyone in the house, men and women alike. The addition of the filter makes the already good city masks much more efficient at filtration, and after 3 washes they are holding up well. One negative is that the strap for converting ear-loop to back of the head doesn't want to work at all."
5.0,"I just got these as back up parts mostly for my favored pieces. Occasionally, the dangled pieces come loose, and sometimes fancier belly jewelry doesn't come with a matching upper jewel, so I swap out the plain jewel for the like color, and this assortment has every color. These look good to wear as is too.<br /><br />A few were a bit stiff to twist off at first. I just covered them with a cloth and gently used needle nose pliers to loosen them up. No problems after that."
5.0,"Love these sunglasses. My son is very sensitive to bright sunlight and needed polarized sunglasses. Not only do they protect his eyes, they’re so stylish as well. My son put them on right away and felt so cool. He’s only 2 years old."
5.0,This is our second or third rope necklace for our son.  He loves them and they hold up great through a baseball season.
5.0,Buenísimo!
5.0,"I have venous insufficiency and take medication for fluid control. Because of this, I have to wear compression socks daily to keep my legs from swelling and prevent cramps. These are the most comfortable socks I have tried and they are very reasonably priced. I have two pairs now and I plan to buy more. Try them. You will be glad you did!"
5.0,"They are incredibly soft, fit perfectly, and super comfortable. They have a nice silky feel. They wash and dry well. Highly recommended"
5.0,I absolutely ADORE this dress! It's extremely flattering and comfortable. I always get compliments on it. It is very ilght-weight and flowy and comes together at the waist nicely. I'll definitely be buying in more colors for the spring!
5.0,Stylish & they work! You can actually see & feel the difference (especially if you do a lot of screen time)<br />One of 4 pairs of bought for myself & as gifts.
5.0,"Adorable, comfortable, and fits well. I ordered 1/2 a size up because I do think they run small, and then they stretch a bit. They make me happy every morning as I look down at them."
5.0,Could be a bit fitted but nothing like a tailor couldnt fix. Decently priced for what you get.
5.0,"Nice watch. Nice size; not too big and not too small. Looks simple and classy at a quick glance, but upon closer look, the row of numbers on the inside rim, and the roman numerals, give it a bit more style and charm."
5.0,Totally hesitate to buy these but they are perfect! I can even wear them they stretch enough! Great for kiddos and lots of fun colors.
5.0,"Got this for my son.  Fits great, washed well."
5.0,My daughter wanted this watch for Christmas she loved it it’s a great smart watch for kids
5.0,Nice robes for the price
5.0,I like the outfit. Purchased for my daughter baby shower. My grandson is due in April.
5.0,"Great leggings. Very thick and soft. I especially love the high, seamless waist band on them. It's like wearing comfy spanx!<br />I did return only because I ordered a large and I think a medium would have fit me better, however they were out of mediums at the time so I have not been able to order another pair but will when more are in stock! If you're in between sizes, size down because of how stretchy they are. Highly recommend!"
5.0,Purchased for my 9 year-old son for Christmas. He is a Saint's fan. He has worn it a couple times and not any issues. The jersey is great quality and he love it.
5.0,My little girl loved it.  thanks
5.0,These are very well made and seem like they should hold up nicely
5.0,Great all around watch band. Love that they are made in the US and the quality is on point!  Very happy with my purchase.
5.0,Arrived on time;fit as expected; good quality
5.0,"These earrings look awesome; sometimes faux Druzy can look super fake- NOT THESE!!! They look fantastic, the blue is so beautiful. Definitely recommend, you can't beat the price."
5.0,"It was exactly what I was after. And it was a little bigger than I expected. But regardless, she loves it :)"
5.0,This hat was an absolute WINNER this past fall and winter season and I literally wore it every time I went anywhere/ including in public. It’s very practical for warmth but also way stylish and I received TONS of compliments on this hat. My only issue was I ordered the large and it was a bit big but not too big where it was unwearable. Next time I will size down. I will be buying a new one next season! THANK YOU FOR A QUALITY PRODUCT!
5.0,I love this product.  Is there any way to buy a dozen of single letters?
5.0,Comfortable right out of the box. Supportive on the arches and great color!
5.0,"I own a couple of these belts. They are exceptionally well crafted from very high quality leather.  The belt is not a fashion item, but it looks good in the way really good artisan-made items do."
5.0,"Good fit over glasses. Secure on my face.  Far less expensive and less trouble than switching back and forth between regular and sunglasses.  I like the blue and they are nice looking.  They could be a little tighter on my face, but they aren't loose."
5.0,I loved it!! I got the XXL and it fits just right... I wish there were other colors. It's soft and airy. I am very satisfied with the product!
5.0,"This is my second wallet from Recycled Fire Fighter. My first was The Captain and is my everyday carry. I destroy wallets and I'm lucky to get a year out of one. So far I've been very impressed with these, they are very tough and rugged. I bought this smaller one to take on bike rides and hiking trips so I'm not carrying my entire life with me if it gets lost. I'm thinking about ordering a couple of these for christmas presents as well.<br /><br />I did receive a discount because I am a returning customer, however I would have bought this product even without the discount."
5.0,"love love love these pants, prints and solids --"
5.0,"Looks great. Bought  it for Halloween, but I will probably wear it pretty often."
5.0,"My boyfriend ,hi loved..."
5.0,Gave as a gift. My son was very pleased.
5.0,I had to hunt these down! I purchased one from Walmart and fell in love. And have been attempting to buy every color since then! Super soft extremely comfortable. I could stay in them all day everyday
5.0,i Like it very much
5.0,I got these for a gift and they LOVED them. Looks exactly like the picture and are pretty sturdy.
5.0,Love these leggings!  Perfect fit and super comfy. Will be buying more.
5.0,It's sooo cute!!!
5.0,this is much more accurate then the string method
5.0,"It's a pretty ring. Feels good. The stone is nice. I hope it's real black sapphire as the description doesn't mention it being lab grown or a crystal. My friend saw it and she immediately said it's a sapphire, which surprised me as it's the first time stumbling on this listing that I heard of black sapphire. I know about the blue one. Yellow sapphire, and I think ruby is basically red sapphire. But didn't know black existed. I love it, feels good and is nice looking little ring. The design is cool, just like pictured. I had purchased the same with a nano emerald (crystal of some sort I guess, green), and didn't like it. It was very flashy green. I have a ring with a real emerald, and comparing the two it just didn't feel right to have the crystal one. Either way, happy I switched. Seems to be a good company for inexpensive jewelry. It does have a stamp. I just can't read exactly what it says right now as it's dark :)"
5.0,"Nice dress, true to size. Quality of fabric is decent."
5.0,"Bought this as a Christmas present, well made."
5.0,Perfect for my costume! Stiff and sturdy hat. I loved it!

5.0,"I love the material, it’s very comfortable. I wore the dress with booties and it was a perfect fall outfit."
5.0,"Esthetically pleasing with a beautifully engraved floral pattern, lightweight enough to wear every day, great for arthritis and tendonitis!! I wear mine daily and even sleep in it at times."
5.0,Muy lindo! Y buen tamaño talves el material no es bueno pero el trabajo de la hada lo compensa a mi me parece perfecto
5.0,this bag is amazing. definitely bigger than it looks. got it for my dad for his frequent weekend work trips and he loves it.
5.0,"This is a very well made shirt. The stitching is well done and should hold up for a long time. The Pattern is very close tight squares and the color is not a bright color but more a dull blue which my husband likes better. It runs rather small so i will have to buy him a bigger size next time, this one is a little tight on the chest and arms. I will be purchasing other shirts because they are really nice and really well made. They where delivered quickly and securely. The Sleeves are cuffed and more on the causal side. They look great with dress shorts or Jeans. As I said i will be getting more of them and I got this one at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review"
5.0,Super cute and fun little keychains!
5.0,Professional quality. Perfect for my handmade earrings I sell in my boutique. Great price!

5.0,Lakers
5.0,Great material. Fits baby great.
5.0,"I received this item at a discount in exchange for my review and honest opinion. I purchased the Winter Warm Plush Stripe USB Heated Fingerless Gloves Hand Warmer for Women Girls with Stylus by Sealike. These glove are so cute and super comfy. They are made of a very soft material with strips in purple, light pink and dark pink. They have a small square inserts sewn to the inside of the glove that gives off a low heat when  plugged into a USB port. These are perfect for that cold day at the office, ridding in a car or for days when you just don't feel like running the heat on high but want your hands to stay warm. These gloves would make great stocking suffers for the Christmas holiday!"
5.0,Love this unique ring.
5.0,"This purse is beautiful, plenty of storage inside.<br />It is a great quality for the price. Would purchase it again."
5.0,"The best boots! It’s gorgeous and fits perfectly. Walks for hours with this boot, not feel tired at All! Love it!"

5.0,I have several different colors...love it!!!
5.0,"Great running vest. I am able to carry a pair of jeans, two shirts, and a hat in the main compartment with some room to spare. Great for my work commute. The side pockets are hard to open and reach while the vest is on but I do not typically need to use those."
5.0,Worked perfectly for my son's uniform
5.0,The material is so soft and comfortable
5.0,This is do warm and comfy. I wore it on a very windy day and this jacket worked well

5.0,It looks better than the picture..<br />It's a beautiful color and classy looking on.
5.0,Kind of a matte black look
5.0,Love the little me brand for my grandson.  It is made exceptionally well. The fit on infants is slightly loose and not cut so narrow that it's a tight fit.  The price point is great.
5.0,good quality but didn't fit as expected
5.0,Love this beautiful sodalite necklace! Came with a gorgeous silver chain too. Will order from this company again! Highly recommend.
5.0,I have used these for a few years now and they a lot of abuse at work. I only buy new ones because I loose them from time to time. They last a long time.
5.0,"These are the most flattering leggings that exist. Not only do they look AMAZING, but they are so comfortable. 10/10"
5.0,"All my daughter has been asking for this Christmas is a locket with our Trinity's photo in it. She passed away over a year ago. This locket is perfect! The picture is perfect, the T, the locket itself, everything about this piece is PERFECT! I can not wait to give this to her on Christmas day. It will be something she treasures forever. Super fast order and shipping as well. Thank you!"
5.0,I love wearing these under my clothes. They really help to hold in my extra pounds.... without being uncomfortable. I would highly recommend.

5.0,Looks like disco balls!! I love tgem
5.0,I love this little charm. It's perfect for Pandora bracelets!
5.0,"Had these a year and a half, and they work like a charm. I'm picky about how sunglasses sit on my face, specifically the nose piece, but these fit great, and don't cause any problems. Aren't the strongest, so treat them with care, my pair finally developed a crack on the far right side."
5.0,Product is exactly what is displayed and discrived. Purchased as a gift and the recipient loved it! Would recommend
5.0,This is a very elegant necklace.  I love it!
5.0,"Beautiful earrings, wear them daily!  Very light, so no tugging on the earlobe!  I get many compliments on them.  Light and sturdy- love love love them!"
5.0,Good polarization for clip on. Flip up clips are metal and are less bulky than plastic. I prefer the brown tint as well. Good looking and don't look like ordinary clip ons.
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised to find an additional zipper pocket inside, especially since this wallet was to replace an older one of a different kind that had only one zipper and it broke after a few months of gradual use. It looks like this wallet is better put together, so we will see how it holds up."
5.0,This is my new favorite shirt. I have a few of each color because they are so comfy. Not too thick but not too thin. Works great for around the house with pajama pants or with jeans too. I am a medium frame B cup and the medium shirt fits nicely not tight at all
5.0,Perfect size for a child.
5.0,Great material and fit!!
5.0,"The material is very soft and sturdy. The stitching is great, I think this will last a long time. The pockets are positioned perfectly and are a good size. I will definitely be getting another!"

5.0,Best pair most comfortable ever get your self a pair this pair makes 6 I've tossed the others
5.0,Love this hat! Fits my 4 year old granddaughter and she loves wearing it around and in the pool! I feel better knowing she’s protected from the sun 👍
5.0,The husband wanted something similar elsewhere but the price was high.  Amazon had this set.  Nice and classy.  Does the job.
5.0,classy and sturdy along with the stylist look with your jeans
5.0,I use these hats as a lifeguard and they are very efficient in the sense of keeping my neck protected while allowing for circulation of air to my head with the mesh on the sides of the cap. Also the ability to remove any feature of the hat makes it that much better. I often use the cap without the face mask and the flaps buttoned behind me.
5.0,This was a gift for my son he loves it fit him just right
5.0,"...LOVE IT! It's bigger than I expected which is good! I bought it to take on our excursions this summer. It does have a plastic-y feel like some of the other reviews say which is fine with me, it reassures me our stuff will stay dry! The color is great I was worried it would be a faded looking design but it's not. My only recommendations to possibly improve would be another pocket on the inside, maybe a top zipper and maybe &quot;feet&quot; on the bottom to keep it off the ground (as long as they wouldn't rust). Either way I'd buy again!!"
5.0,"fits great, good quality, and love the look"
5.0,Very nice weight made well!
5.0,"Really like this sports bra!<br />You can feel solid support and I like the strappy back.<br />One thing I noticed is that any excess skin/weight hangs out from between the straps, so if I was any heavier I might be less likely to wear this.<br />For reference, I’m 5’7” 150lb 34DDD"
5.0,"I am a very tactile shopper and I love the feel of this shirt.  I probably should have bought a larger size, but really love this shirt."
5.0,"Fit comfortably.  Designs looks good. Not blurry, also the material is comfortable."
5.0,Great produce. Great shpping
5.0,Bought it for my Mom on her Birthday and she Loved it!! :)
5.0,"great thin, light weight shirt. It fit but with no wiggle room, so i would recomend you go up a size for range of movement."
5.0,"Exactly as shown. Perfect in every way. Beautiful rich, deep color. Super soft and luxurious looking. You never know what you are going to get but this met every expectation. So happy."
5.0,Arrived when I expected. Just as described.<br />This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. I hope she she loves it!
5.0,"Great shoe, great buy.  No breaking in, comfortable from the moment I put it on.  I ordered the size I typically wear and these fit like expected."
5.0,I couldn't believe the quality at such a bargain price. I like to think I look like a super-buff cross between Arnold Schwartzenegger and Steve Jobs.<br /><br />(I actually probably look more like a sweaty Michael Moore)
5.0,Has so much room in it.
5.0,I bought this as a gift for a horror buff.  They loved it!!!
5.0,"Got this for work purposes, my boss allows nose rings but they have to be small ( mine isn't ) . But my carpet ate it one day when I was removing my makeup ugh !"
5.0,Very soft material. Not see through. Plan on purchasing other colors. Sizing is as expected.
5.0,Good for cold mornings and evenings.
5.0,This is cool and rare too.
5.0,I bought these for my daughter to wear with an open back dress.  Worked great! They did not move while she was wearing them (no adjustment needed).  She said she hardly noticed them once they were on.  It was a little uncomfortable to peel off skin at end of wearing but not too bad.  We saved the plastic covering to place back on the bra to re-use and wear again.
5.0,"I LOVE This hat!!! It looks like an old lady hat, but I’m totally cool with that because it completely shades my face from the damaging rays of the sun all while allowing me to have a bun on top of my head! I can’t sand trying to finagle my hair through a ball cap!!! This is the perfect solution if you’re willing to forgo being fashion forward. I would buy it 10 times over! This coming from a 30 something stay at home mom of 2... ages 7 and 3...  I wear it primarily at our country club pool. So either I’m a complete nerd or I’m setting a fashion trend... we shall see. 😆"
5.0,"Looks and feels nice, I ordered a large on purpose despite being an S/M so it would be longer. It goes down to my feet when I pull it up to my chest (i’m 5’4). I had to safety pin the back, but that’s my fault, not the company’s."
5.0,The shirt is adorable! Slightly tight around the busy but just order a siZe up and you'll be fine. It's such a cute top for fall and the pearl detail is of good quality !
5.0,Very lovely. Fits as expected. A nice item.
5.0,This dress is sooo cute. I am so glad I ordered it. I’m 5’3” and 130 lbs. I ordered a small. Fit absolutely perfect. I’m considering ordering another one. I love it so much.
5.0,"Perfect length socks. I've been looking for a comfortable light weight sock and this is it. They are light enough to wear during the summer but not so light that they are see through. Very comfortable, neutral socks."
5.0,The material is a bit cheap but the dress is beautiful it will work for exactly what I wanted which was a sexy dress for a nice dinner! Fits as expected but adjust if it didn’t fit perfectly
5.0,"I got this as a gift for my sister-in-law of Irish heritage, and she loves it! Her father passed away a year ago, and it's a special tribute to her maiden name of O'Brien. It's pretty and came well packaged. I got this on a lightening deal and it was a great deal! This would make a great gift...for a friend or yourself. I'm going to order one for myself for St. Patrick's day!"
5.0,Quality strap. Rose gold looks mint. Not cheap. Worth it. Leather is soft and durable
5.0,Fits and worth price
5.0,"These are great quality, soft and has premium look and feel. They seem to run a bit small."
5.0,El me queda perfecto cómo lo queria
5.0,Love it. Came earlier than expected on the holidays and it came in a very nice box. So i didnt even have to wrap it
5.0,"These Pajama Pants arrived in brand new condition.  The picture displays the exact product received.  The material is ultra-thin, medium tension fabric, and is as expected.  The U.S. Army(r) and Star design is good quality ink print and does not cause bunching or stiffness in the thigh.  All seams are quality work with no loose strings on the exterior.  The drawstring is a substantial strip of tight-weave cloth.  Overall, this is an excellent quality product sold at a great price delivered as expected."
5.0,Simple and light to carry. This was just what I needed.
5.0,"great socks, great fit"
5.0,Love it! Very roomy and the quality is way better than expected
5.0,"Love the color and elegant look of this rose gold watch! Exactly what I was looking for and what a great price! My wrists are small, yet I didn’t need to adjust the band at all. The bracelet gift was really nice, too!  The seller Valbuy provides excellent service, and emailed instructions for adjusting the wrist band if I needed to. Thanks so much for such a terrific lightning deal!"
5.0,"Absolutely LOVE these glasses!!! Unfortunately, so did my dog. She chewed them up before I had a chance to wear them for the 4th of July :( I plan on ordering them again."
5.0,I love the look and feel of this dress. It was comfortable and cute. It fit as expected and the fabric is good quality and not too thin.
5.0,It isn't too big or too small. It fits nicely on the collar of my wool coats.

5.0,this is adorable!!
5.0,These earrings are a beautiful pink color and appear well made.
5.0,"Bought these specifically for a trip to Italy because old Italian roads have not been kind to my feet in the past, even in the most comfortable of shoes.<br />These have wonderful cushion, and never slipped off. These will be a staple in my wardrobe from here on out!"

5.0,"So happy I purchased this bracelet.  I’ve wanted a Cape Cod bracelet for years but everyone I’ve ever found that has a gold/rose gold ball, is PLATED gold, and my skin eats right through plated gold.  I like the all silver ones, but knew I wouldn’t be as happy with it.  I searched and searched and came across this company, and they state in their description that the balls are solid, which is a huuuge plus for me.  This bracelet is stunning.  Elegant yet simple, and that’s what I love the most.  I couldn’t be happier with this purchase.  If you’re tossing around the idea, go for it, you won’t be disappointed.  Believe me"
5.0,"These pants fit well! Most sweats and yoga pants are a bit too short, and a bit too tight in the thighs on me but these are just right. Very soft too!"
5.0,Love this band. So elegant!!
5.0,"I bought these earrings in August of 2018. It is now March of 2022. I bought 2 initially and wear them as regular earlobe studs. I take them out about once every 3 or 4 months to give them a good cleaning (1/2 hydrogen peroxide and 1/2 rubbing alcohol, let them sit in it for about 10 mins then wipe off with a q-tip, rinse with water, dry with a paper towel), but otherwise, they stay in my ears 24/7. I cannot say enough how much I love them. I used to lose my earrings in the bed or swimming or while brushing my long hair all the time. With the screw on backs, they have never once fallen out. And the backs are flat so they are very comfortable to wear, even when laid down to sleep. I am very sensitive to metals, but the stainless steel in these doesn’t bother me at all. I have been scouring EBay, Etsy, and Amazon to find these earrings so I could buy another pair. (In fact, I just ordered 3 more pair to have for the future in case they ever quit making them, because I would be devastated). They obviously aren’t real pearls (look at the price), but they have managed to look amazing for years. They did initially have a white coating on them which pealed off around 1 year of continuous wear, but the stud underneath is a light cream color so they still look like pearls. I get compliments on them all the time. When I get the new ones in, I will post pictures of them side by side to show the color variation."
5.0,"These shorts are a nice fit; not too tight and not too short, with a casual look."
5.0,Love the look of many bracelets. Well made. Eye catching.
5.0,"THANK YOU , LOVE THEM :)"
5.0,Beautiful suit. Very well made and extremely comfortable. The fit was just what I'd expected. This would make a terrific tennis outfit as well.
5.0,"They fit perfectly! I'll admit, I was a tad bit nervous with the one size fits all. I'm normally a size 7-9 and these are perfect, they stretch to fit your curves!"
5.0,"My son loves them and they are a great fit, I wish u had slim fit for really tiny heads but my son is more than satisfied with them!!"
5.0,"I purchased this for my husband. My first order was a 3XL,  but ended up being a little small. Returning it was free and easy and I purchased a 4XL which fit great. Pay attention to the sizing chart in the description. My husband has a 44 chest and 34&#34; arm with 17&#34;neck. Generally he wears XL or 17 34-35 in dress shirts.  Shipping was much faster than expected."
5.0,"This was a nice quality weather watch band to get. I like the way it feels strong. Comfortable, good. Looking easy to install. I'm glad I got it"
5.0,"I like these shirts more then I expected to! The colors and fabric are very nice.  Follow the Neleus size guide.  The large fits just as I hoped - I'm a smallish person, 5'4&#34; 110 lbs,  and don't wear a large in anything!  I did not want skin tight but not baggy either.  I bought the Neleus brand tank tops in both small (for a compression fit) and medium (slightly looser comfortable fit), and the long sleeve in a large (to layer over the compression tank).  Everything fits as I hoped.  It doesn't appear there is a huge difference between sizes in this brand.  I found no size variations in the 3 packs of any of the tops - as reported by other buyers.  I also do not put any dry fit type clothing in the dryer so haven't had any problems unraveling or seems falling apart."
5.0,Very cut and comfortable!

5.0,"I like bigger sunglasses but sometimes they can be heavy.  theses definitely don't feel cheap but for some reason, they're light and easy on the side of my nose.  I often get red marks that last a hour after I take the sunglasses off- but not with these."
5.0,I love this thing. Its tooo sexy. If you buy a size up as is recommended. You'll be fine. Just one size tho...I went up twice the first time and had to return it for a smaller one.

5.0,adorable on my baby!
5.0,"I love the look and have gotten compliments, but be a little careful.  The clasp, if you don't pay attention, may come loose unexpectedly. If you hit the sweet spot, though, no worries at all, and it's a great price."
5.0,Color was perfect as well as the fit
5.0,Lo que yo esperaba así mismo
5.0,"For the price, these feels very sturdy and expensive! Packaging was good. The sunglasses were perfect! They are gorgeous!!! I honestly thought it wasn’t going to match my oval shaped face (with the big forehead) but it worked out great. It’s flattering! I’m taking both of them to my trip to Mexico this August. Great deal!"

5.0,"This beautiful if not femine ECO-DRIVE watch by Citizen(nee Bulova) is absolutely wonderful; classy and most attractive if not utterly functional without the need for a battery which I do detest (I have 5 watches!) So FINALLY, ""tech"" is on my side without making it complicated or ridiculous.  LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (-PLUS $100 less than the jeweler's price! THAT matters!)

Ordered both on same day, both were prime,  both arrived at same time and I was pleased with both colors..<br />From there the 2 are very different.  This dress is perfect.  The other is very large and has a shortened waist.  This company offers free return ship the other does not.<br />I love the dress and will order from you all again."

5.0,I was a little worried at first but the purse is one of the best I ever had.
5.0,"I have Two of The Italy .925 Silver with 18 K Gold Coated Chains in Sizes 5 MM x 16"" Lengths, and This 6 MM x 16 Length looks even great as well. The 18 K Gold Coating last for awhile to. I found this to be a good option, until I can afford a solid Chain anyway."
5.0,"Loved them. very cute, excellent quality"
5.0,"Love the feel and weight of this hat, it just feels like quality.  I bought an XL and it fit my 231/2 head.  I needed a decent hat for the summer.  My head sweats in everything but I think this will do the trick."

5.0,Love this cape!  I'm putting together a box full of hats and stuff for &#34;pretend days&#34; for my grandson. I know he will love this one.  The lightening logo isn't glued or ironed on. It's seen on to last through his many flights of fancy!  Well done!
5.0,"Good quality and comfort for the price. Too small. Normal shoe size is 8, but usually a 7 in sandals. Buy true to size."
5.0,"This is a great hat!!!!!!  I had two, my daughter walked away with one, I bought another.  I keep one in my house, one in my office and one in my car.<br /><br />That is how much I like this hat.  I do not NOT use an umbrella.  I hope this review will not prevent me from getting another of these hats, because the market will not support that........ I had better order another ten -- quickly."
5.0,"Great dress! Super comfy and cute. Can dress it up with a pair of wedges or heals and can be dressed down with flip flops or sandals. Runs a little big, but that could just be the style. I think I will buy another in a different color."

5.0,Beautiful bag. Large enough to hold everything I needed for the evening.
5.0,"great watch.accurate,easy to read.looks better in person than pictures"
5.0,"nice dress but not for my age, maybe on 40+"
5.0,"Love these heavy duty gloves for women because they are actually made to fit women's hands/fingers.  I was so tired of trying to work with the big fingered men-size gloves that make it hard to pick up things.  I usually wear a size L, but these only come in S or M, & Medium fits me fine.  These gloves do a good job protecting my nails when I'm doing heavier yard work."
5.0,This is my favorite summer dress now.
5.0,"Perfect Fitting! Nice texture and confortable, Ideal for Cruise Travel!"
5.0,The person I bought this for loved this watch! Very classy and fit perfectly.
5.0,Boys loved them!
5.0,"THIS, omg is like..... faux suade but it feels awesome, looks awesome, it's just a little over sized but nothing you could notice ( im veeeeery picky about fit so if you want it with a little breatheable space then choose the same size you would) other than that is Freaking amazing for the cold weather."
5.0,"These socks are awesome, they are really comfy and cannot be seen at all while wearing my Chucks."

5.0,Beautiful! Made a perfect gift!
5.0,Great cheap sunglasses that work 10x better than my expensive Armani sunglasses
5.0,It was just what I needed. Though it is small space inside it was perfect for a small portion of my baby turtles ashes

5.0,Perfect belt... Exactly as its described

5.0,"The first time I wore this top, I received so many compliments. It fits perfectly, is made well, and actually can be worn with a number of different things. Just a little edgy to make you stand out but not too much so. I like wearing things that are on a somewhat daring side, and this top fits the bill. Love the dolman sleeves especially. I will definitely shop this seller in the future. Many many thanks and highly recommend."
5.0,"Hmmm, why not add a little pizzazz to something I carry with me everywhere and what better color than rose-gold like my phone. Yep, the phone holder locket is just the right touch.  I do have to say that it's a bit heavier than I thought it might be but it's so cute that it's not a big deal."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:b0a559fcd296c1c98f0d9086e204317d]] I really loved this costume !! I was so skeptical about it because it doesn’t have a lot of reviews but I was amazing . Side note though, order early bc it almost didn’t make it in time for Halloween"
5.0,A really nice set of earrings. I get lots of complements.
5.0,Everything was just as described
5.0,"My son is 9 years old, tall for his age, and somewhat husky. The medium fits great!  I am buying 3 more pair for school."
5.0,"LOVE THIS!  For the price I thought it would be so-so quality, but I think it's really great! At first I was really disappointed that the curly one wasn't available in the shipping time frame I needed, but after receiving it I think this one is even better.  I was beaming as soon as it arrived.  In addition to using it for Halloween I think I'll definitely try to incorporate it randomly throughout the year.  I got tons of compliments.  So great and so fun!"
5.0,Very cute style!  I love it!
5.0,I had to remove a couple of links - I love the look of this watch... sporty yet smart!
5.0,"Nice shorts at any price. As others have mentioned, make sure to order a size larger than you normally would."
5.0,Love the style and fit if this suit.
5.0,"Impressed with packaging, quality and value of this adorable bag. For the price paid, it arrived in a condition above my expectation and I am very happy with the purchase. A quality paperboard thank you card was enclosed as was an included dust bag. Everything was packaged very neatly, a huge air pack was inside of the purse to keep it's shape and the overall handling of the item is what I'd expect of purses sold over $100 and I paid a small fraction of that.<br /><br />I was aware when ordering that the hardware is gold on this item. My only &#34;complaint&#34; is that it would be improved by silvertone hardware, but this is my opinion about all hardware. I am not a preferer of gold tone. I would absolutely buy this brand and from this seller again. If you like the look of the bag, it came looking identically to its picture. You WON'T be disappointed. Thanks!"
5.0,Very beautiful and the great quality earrings. Gift to a friend and she loved them.
5.0,Came quickly and exactly as described

5.0,Love these tops. This is my second order.
5.0,Don't let its simplicity fool you. This gives a girl a genteel look.
5.0,I bought this to carry car seats through the air port. It's nicely made and very compact.  It fit nicely under the seat in front of me on the plane. It fit one car seat on well but two did not work. They kept falling off sideways every several feet (I thought my husband was going to chuck everything across the room lol). But that was our fault not the product.
5.0,Me encanto es de muy buena calidad
5.0,"The piece came just as pictured! I'm very happy with the quality of the product, it was worth its price. Works perfect for my cosplay."
5.0,It is gorgeous and arrived earlier than expected. I wish the dresses came in US size 2/4 but I ordered the small and it gives me just a tad extra space if I gain a few pounds.
5.0,Love these on my wife.  Makes her ass look great
5.0,Absolutely perfect! My five-year-old son is completely obsessed with Tom and Jerry and he was so excited for me to get this for him!
5.0,"I absolutely love this ring. I bought a cheap adjustable one in a gift store and lost it, i was so bummed. This one is dainty, i forget i have it on sometimes. I do wish the stone was just a little bigger but other than that i love it. I've gotten compliments already! And they sent me a free gift which was gorgeous too."
5.0,"These glasses were amazing, and came exactly how it was shown in the picture."
5.0,Great summer scarf.  Its thin And nice

5.0,Great travel size back pack. Material is great. I bought the yellow one as a gift to my sister who prefers stuffing things in her pocket than to bring a bag a long but she loves it and takes it everywhere.
5.0,"loved these, when opening the shoes to put on you could see some of the glue material used to make the shoe"
5.0,So cute and fits well. Good buy.

5.0,"These boots fit perfectly, nothing negative to complain about"
5.0,This item is perfect.  Thank you
5.0,looks nice and fit well.
5.0,"These hats are very well made, nice material and packed with care.  This is a great deal for a quality product.  I have a smaller head, and these fit perfect I  like the adjustment at the back makes adjusting for a pony tail easy."
5.0,"First off, ignore the one poor review for this product. What can you expect from someone that complains about a dead battery for a wind up watch!!<br /><br />I have enjoyed wearing this watch.  The rosegold color is true and does not disappoint.  The brown leather band compliments the watchface, well paired. It's fun to wear a mechanical watch and the inner gears are easily seen through the decorative rose gold face.<br /><br />The one drawback is that I believe the band is on the smaller side.  I'm not a big person, but I only have two holes remaining on the band with a semi snug fit. However, for a $17 price tag it's really nothing that takes away from this product for me.  Don't forget to wind it!!"
5.0,Great shower sandal for the gym!
5.0,I ordered these as gifts and they were beautiful!
5.0,"My son loved these sandals, wore them daily until they couldn't fit him! Super comfortable, sturdy, fit as expected. Great value for the price."
5.0,"Cute shoes!  Ordered in rose gold, color accurate as well as size.wish heel was a bit higher but is a comfortable height."
5.0,Love this bag ! Classy !
5.0,"The dress fit as expected, it fit pretty well on me"
5.0,"Great quality, thick, stylish watch strap.  Generous XL length.  The color is very unique with creme and light browns. Outstanding python skin, love this strap for a variety of watches.  Somewhat expensive compared to many other off-the-shelf watch straps but well worth the price."
5.0,"Tried the jeans on... they seemed very comfortable and to be a good fit. The quality was not the best but better than I expected if that makes sense. Zipper seems very cheap but you do get what you pay for, and at around $20 I'm ok with that. I'm very happy with my purchase<br />5'3&#34; and 140lb. Size 7"
5.0,These Gregory Peck glasses are great and would look cool on anyone!
5.0,I purchased this lovely bracelet for my great granddaughter's christening.  It is beautiful.
5.0,"I LOVE THIS THING!! It works great and looks good with any hat you put on it (even a Santa hat!). I haven't tried a mask yet, but everyone thinks it's quite creepy."
5.0,Our granddaughter just loves this hoodie
5.0,"This watch band works very well, comes with adjustment tool."
5.0,Beautiful!  Fits just as expected.  Lace isn't itchy.
5.0,This dress feels amazing against my skin.  Can't wait to buy another color.
5.0,A little snug and I have a small head! But it's very warm!
5.0,My husband is pretty particular when it comes to clothes . He absolutely loves this shirt ! He wears it almost every weekend 😊
5.0,Great Fit and color ! Ilse Jacobsen jackets do run small ... I am normally an XS / 0 and the 34 fit me great !
5.0,"I ordered a few different brands of the capri length style leggings to try out... and these are by far my favorite.  They are very soft and have way more compression to them than the other brands.  I’m short, so they hit me around the base of my calf, which is exactly as I expected (and wanted).  The waist hits right below my belly button.<br /><br />They are not shiny, more of a brushed cotton look.  Perfect for working out or casual wear.  I ordered the bean paste color and wasn’t sure what to expect... but it’s a gorgeous purple, I would probably call it a deep plum color.  Nice change from black and grey, but still neutral.  This brand will definitely be my go to."
5.0,First impressions are great. Quality is superb and pockets galore. The reason we went for this one is the spinner wheels and they seem to be legit and well made. Should be strong enough for most travel. It’s small. Good for 3-4 day weekend trip maybe more. The usb is a gimmick but it’s nice to have. You will need to provide your own battery usb). The handle is sturdy but not super hard (it’s aluminum). And yes a MacBook Pro 15.4 inch will fit just fine. It’s tight but it can work. I made it fit in the provided sleeve and in the bottom. So it works. Not much to add. It’s the future of travel. Should fit under most seats but you have to check airline.
5.0,It was a gift so someone
5.0,Great socks. Great product. I will be ordering again soon.
5.0,Love this dress! Its a staple for work.

5.0,Cute and confirtable
5.0,I love my shirt it fits great true to size.
5.0,I just love these glasses They fit well over my prescription glasses. The heart shape on the sides is a nice added touch.
5.0,The first visor I have. Beautiful color and good quality.  Recommended.
5.0,Loved the comfort and flex of this watch band.  Terrible workmanship in that it barely lasted 40 days before it literally fell off my wrist.  I included pictures of where the band separated from the connector piece.  Will not buy again.  This is the second band that has been ruined of this style.
5.0,"Comfort, style and practicality. This cap has it all. Wearing it for 12 hours it’s proven its worth. And it washes well. Love the print of the fabric and an amazing buy for the price!."
5.0,The material is super soft. Fits as expected. I got a large and I’m 5’5” and 180. It has pockets so it’s a solid win from me. I would order every color if I could.
5.0,Shirt is Very Nice Printing is Great
5.0,Great versatile dress. I got it in two colors and wear often. Washes up well and very comfortable. I like the sleeve length as well as the overall length of the dress hitting Just above the knee.
5.0,My 6 year old is happy to have his version of &#34;roller shoes &#34; ..He is waiting for summer ......
5.0,These are great for the price! I get so may compliments on them. I would definitely buy these again! I bought the 4mm and they are cute and subtle but I plan on buying the 6mm too so when I want to be a a little more flashy they will stand out more.<br />I did give these a three for comfort not because they aren’t comfortable when I wear them but because I have super sensitive ears and I’d prefer not to wear them all day. I wear them to work or church and then take them out when I get home.
5.0,Amazing wallet for the price Overall I’m happy with my purchase :).
5.0,This belt looks great and fits my Anson buckles perfectly. The buckle it comes with is pretty nice also. Definitely a great cost effective option. Will buy more.
5.0,I like these. I only wear them when I’m working out though.
5.0,nice materials but size S still large for me with weight 106lb and height 5’3
5.0,Very nice item.  Works great!
5.0,"The model I god works as a long, somewhat thin and stylish, scarf to wrap around your neck, or as a fluffy infinity scarf which captures warmth in the many air pockets. Very happy with this scarf!!"
5.0,Love the fun look of these earrings. I am looking forward to being able to wear them longer next Christmas.
5.0,"Heavy as hell. Love it. Took about 5 minutes to install and another 30 minutes to get the length right. But, overall. Great price and quality."
5.0,Looks great on my son
5.0,"I love this skirt, got so many complements as I have gone religious and need more modest clothing but I also want to look cute."
5.0,Que combina con todo
5.0,Love this !!!! Fit perfect and quality made ! Fast service ! Highly recommend
5.0,Love them so much definitely size down 2 sizes at least.
5.0,Perfect deployment replacement for the buckle - quality SS - I like this deployment style much better than others as it sits inside of itself so it's comfortable and thinner than the smaller deployments that stack the clasp onto of each other rather than inset like this one - IWC without their logo
5.0,Love these and would highly recommend.  The silicone treads help for walking around hard floors but don't get sticky.  Super cozy without being hot.  I will be buying additional pairs.
5.0,I love this jacket! It is light but just right when the winter wind is gusting.  Would buy again!
5.0,A simple classic!
5.0,If you've never tried these and you work in the heat you ought to try these. Soaking them in cool water really helps but tap water also works well. When I have a project that's going to have me out in the heat Ill soak one or two of these and put them in a Baggie and set them in the refrigerator for an hour.
5.0,"all good - fabric, fit, padding"
5.0,BEAUTIFUL! I got so many compliments on it!
5.0,was exactly as described.  Love it and it shipped fast.
5.0,I bought this shirt as a gift and the recipient loved it! Fit as expected.
5.0,I bought this for a birthday present. It's beautiful and very soft. My friend should be quite pleased. It arrived in a timely manner in perfect condition.
5.0,"Great hat that stays cool damp much longer than its competitors.  Nice styling and the fit is spot on.  Don't expect this hat to work very well in humid climates.  I live in low-humidity Arizona so this hat works fine.  The lower the humidity, the better it works."
5.0,"So cute, good quality, good size!"
5.0,"Adorable, excellent quality, great size. I ordered these for when the pups go to doggy daycare, and they do not disappoint. Tip: a quick pass of my steam iron took the shipping wrinkles right out."
5.0,The sweater was perfect fit and feels so soft. Large number of colors to choose from to fit your color choices. It is warm and gets many compliments from co-workers.
5.0,"I love this dress!  Wow is this cute and well made to boot!  The material is a heavier material, which helps it hold its flowy shape.  The design is wonderful and the sewing is very nice and is uniform.  The appliques of the flowers are a nice quality and look beautiful on the dress.  I got the XXXL, the tag on the dress says 16W.  I’m a 14, XL, 36DD but generally do get dresses in a size 16 for a better fit.  This fits like a dream, no altering needed!  The one shoulder looks is fun and cooler in the summer months as well.  I didn’t have my petticoats under this dress when I took the photos but they look amazing under it!  I’ve received many compliments on this dress, and I feel wonderful in it to boot!  I highly recommend it!"
5.0,"Holy Crap!!! 2016-2017 Never realize, I forgot to write a review. Sick plugs, super vibrant, great length & width, overall satisfied."
5.0,Fits great not too heavy and very comfortable to wear!It is a great price seeing that most stores charge 3x the price of these earrings! I highly recommend these!
5.0,I really love this Socks! I bought them for my 3 year and they fit just right. She wears a size 8 in shoes. They are perfect for the fall/winter time.
5.0,"I LOVE this jumpsuit. It’s perfect for the price. I’m 5’2”, and it’s the perfect length on me, coming to my ankles. I love the ruffles and don’t think they’re “too much.” I’ve worn it twice now and gotten multiple compliments on it. Love!"
5.0,"The shape and visual texture is surprisingly accurate to the show, note that you might have to wear a face shell under it as it’s a latex mask.<br /><br />My only issues were it’s aroma and the eyes, I had to swap them out with separate LED eyes.<br /><br />The size probably doesn’t fit child’s so only use this if you’re at least 15 I suppose."
5.0,Bought this for my boyfriend.  And it's amazing! Definitely worth the money! Looks and feels like the real thing!
5.0,THESE BRACELETS ARE SO PERFECT!!! JUST THE RIGHT SIZE. I WAS SO WORRIED IT WOULD BE OBNOXIOUS.IT IS BEYOND NICE AND I LOVE IT
5.0,Excellent quality for a great price
5.0,All it said it was very happy
5.0,I BOUGHT THESE TO EMBROIDER FOR BEACH BAGS FOR MY 4 GRANDDAUGHTERS.  GREAT QUALITY AND BEAUTIFL COLOR CHOICES.
5.0,"These are the most darling overalls I have ever seen! They fit perfect! And, the legs are not too long as happens so many times you order pants. Plan to order several more pair!"
5.0,"My new favorite skort! Bought 6 pairs in total. Great color selection. These are the most comfy clothing items I have bought in years. Great for exercise and casual every day wear. Looks great with sandals or tennis shoes. Fit is fantastic, moves well and stays in place. Shorts do not ride up at all."
5.0,Beautiful and great packaging love the box
5.0,"Beautiful , soft, Well made , fits well, comfortable,  speedy delivery,  wishes they came in other colors"
5.0,These mask are nicely made. We wore these for hours Christmas Eve and had no issues. You can breath normal in them with no issues. The filters are light weight and are easy to insert into the mask.
5.0,"I love this, it helps me keep my glasses and sunglasses together. It makes me happy someone came up with something like this!"
5.0,Beautiful and looks way more expensive than what it was.
5.0,They loved them and are still using them today.  Work great for kids.
5.0,"Perfect for small bodies too! I’m 115 pounds and around 5’3”, I wanted to grab a dress that would make me feel like a goddess! This one is exactly what I wanted and I’m glad it didn’t overwhelm my small frame!"
5.0,"The pattern, fabric & fit are exactly as pictured. Definitely a cute addition to a summer wardrobe.<br /><br />Totally happy with my purchase."
5.0,"My daughter really likes these. No ridiculous colors and patterns. Simple, comfortable, and functional."
5.0,Looks nice on jewelry.
5.0,"Fantastic quality, colorful and unique: always when worn, I receive compliments! Print of blue horse is also on the back (not just solid pinkish colour) I adore Franz Marc and Der Blaue Reiter. Probably the best thing I've bought on Amazon!"
5.0,So impressed with this suit!  Super cute and fits great.
5.0,Went right into my medicine pouch for protection
5.0,Looks great wish for a 5 mm.
5.0,"Nice belt. I’m a big girl and was concerned that the 42” wouldn’t fit, but it fits!<br />Nicely made!<br />Thank you for making a quality product!"
5.0,Very cute😊
5.0,Wow! What a nice piece. I am so glad I bought it.
5.0,Very cute coat! Perfect length & it kept me warm.
5.0,"I bought these a while ago and have been meaning to get more.  I like this bead, probably because you can see through it.  I consider this one of my regular beads I use on my bracelet.  May get a few more."
5.0,Fit as expected. Very durable. Arrived just as depicted in photo. I have a LOT of hair (length down to my waist) and it all fits inside the scrub cap in a bun. Would definitely buy again!
5.0,I had a pair of these a long time ago and loved them they fit like a glove no pun intended haha l love these gloves so much I got 2 pair one black and one white there very good quality
5.0,"WOW, what an elegant necklace. almost looks medieval."
5.0,It is always confusing when ordering off Amazon to know if you are getting a high quality product.  These shoe laces are excellent quality.
5.0,so beautiful large ring thank you
5.0,"My granddaughter loves her dinosaur slippers.  They are comfy and warm. Perfect fit, the size was exact."
5.0,This is either my third or fourth cap I purchased from this small business!! I absolutely love!! The MOST comfortable & breathable
5.0,Delivery quick and on time. Pants are very comfortable.
5.0,Needs pro fit not strap
5.0,"It holds all my stuff and that I cannot complain about.  I have had this about a week and find it to be well made.  However, time will tell on how sturdy the item will be and I will update my review as necessary.  I do like the fact it is a RFID wallet.  I do not carry a wallet in my back pocket because it kills my hip.  I carry in the front pocket which makes it harder to lift in a crowd.  I just hope the seams hold as well as the soft leather with no tearing.  If I can get 2-3 years out of a $25 wallet I will consider it a victory.  If you need a nice looking leather wallet with ample card holders and is RFID protected I don't think you will find a better one.  The one thing I did notice upon opening it was that it had that same smell of every dentist office I had ever been in!  It is like that new car scent smell but that every dentist office smells the same scent!  I cannot explain it unless Alpine Swiss also makes all dental chairs and equipment for the reason it does.  Okay, I am weird but I am heavily driven by my senses and this wallet smells like a dentist office! LOL!"
5.0,"I’m in love and I’m going to order two more colors right now. Never in my life have I been able to follow directions with some things so easily, the material is so incredible that it really flows when you are twisting and wrapping it in a turbine. I look fabulous, it’s light weight, perfect amount of stretch and the green color is gorgeous. Not an emerald green like in the photos but a little bit lighter like a lime. Love!"
5.0,I bought these cute gloves for driving. They are comfortable and stylish. Delivery was quick!
5.0,I love the shirt very much
5.0,I loved my purchased item. I will definitely purchase more items from this carrier as well as this website and I will recommend others to do so as well.
5.0,"Great buy, good quality and so easy to use with any style of clothing.."
5.0,"These are beautiful, recieved many compliments."
5.0,"Cute & comfy. I like the little pockets(wouldn’t hold more than a lighter or a couple of cards). Looks good with or without a belt. Very thin material, so I’d wear a slip on the bottom half at least. I ordered a small- I’m 5’7” 125 lbs."
5.0,Worked just great.
5.0,"If you like how they look and you have a big melon, don't hesitate. Equal quality to my old bolle kings."
5.0,Love 😻💜💛💚🧡 ❤ them they're so cute 😍.
5.0,Very comfortable. I have a small face and this was adjustable so it fit very well.
5.0,This Cross was purchased for my sons 24th birthday. He loved it. Just to say this cross was much larger than we thought.It is well made and worth the money.
5.0,Absolutely love this apron it's super light and fits perfect!!
5.0,"Fits 6 rolls of labels, the cord, and the label maker itself. Keeps everything tidy, love it!"
5.0,Very nice and classy chic yet young looking. I buy both to use them as chocked and solo. Can blend in well with designer jewelry.
5.0,"So comfy, plenty of support!"
5.0,"I like the styling and fit, and now my friends are taking them.  They look and feel good.  What else needs to be said?!"
5.0,My daughter is so thrilled with this backpack.  The monogramming looks perfect!
5.0,Fits perfectly. Tons of compliments. Would recommend to anyone.
5.0,Excellent product for such a low price.
5.0,the best quality
5.0,"I like this thing. It's strong , light and doesn't take up a lot of  real estate in my pocket. Lots of times I clip it to my belt loop for convenience."
5.0,Awesome is authentic and looks great.
5.0,Beautiful necklace. Love to wear them with my turtlenecks for a more dressy feel.
5.0,"So far, I love it.  It is perfect for everything I need to carry and I can do it hands free with the cross-body option."
5.0,"This is my second pair of these.  They fit exaclty the same as the first pair, which I've had for many years."
5.0,These are very cool and unique earrings.  My girlfriend really likes them as she enjoys jewelry that is more of a hand made style.
5.0,Awesome polishing cloth for your jewelry.
5.0,Super cute and great price. Quality fabric.
5.0,"Cute, color as described. Made a great addition to a Valentine's Day outfit for my 10-year-old. Soft fabric that has held up well."
5.0,"Beautiful. Just beautiful.<br /><br />Before I ordered it I was concerned it would be small, and that it was possibly modeled on a very small head. But it’s awesome and very generous, comfortable and elegant. Will buy more."
5.0,"Great set, they seem like decent quality for the price"
5.0,"It fit like a glove, and very classy, felt comfortable in it, I’m a beverage server and I️ was active for New Years Eve, definitely recommend."
5.0,Very fitting and comfortable
5.0,These are absolutely beautiful.  They fit perfect.  Shipping took much longer than expected but I think that was due to Covid stuff.
5.0,These worked great for my mother
5.0,shirt was just as i was expecting
5.0,This is probably one of the best casual/party up dress i've purchased online. It is so flattering. I'm between a small & medium but went with a small. It's fits just fine.
5.0,I have been using this rope chain for small pendants for almost a year. It still looks as nice as it did when I first purchased it. I have had no problems with the clasp or with the chain getting kinks in it. It is a classically beautiful and strong chain that could be worn without pendants also.This rope chain has by far surpassed my expectations especially in view of the reasonable price for a rhodium plated chain. I highly recommend it. The quality is great and the rope style can be dressed up or down for any occasion. Happy shopping!
5.0,Beautiful and fits great.
5.0,"This is the second time I've bought a silkie from Sarah silks. I bought a pink one first for my baby girl (pink). Not soon after by three year old boy was taking it over so I bought him a blue one. Love them, high quality and exactly what I expected."
5.0,"I was a little worried about the quality of these hats when I ordered them, but seem to be very well made and sturdy. And they are so cute, as are the white gloves. Purchased to go with a tea set, and I know they will be well-loved and used many times."
5.0,These were nice.
5.0,Made of nice material. Sturdy. Easy to wipe. Good size
5.0,Amazing quality.  Low price for such a beautiful work of art.
5.0,"Every time my daughter outgrew these, we bought the next size up in exactly the same style. She gets tons of compliments (the stars make them extra cute), they hold up really well (we live in west africa, so they take a beating), and they don't show the dirt (again. West Africa.)"
5.0,These socks are so cute!
5.0,My daughter added this to her Cruella de Vil costume and it was perfect (although it was so slippery that it kept moving all sorts of wrong ways - like in this photo. ha!)<br /><br />The quality is nice and the design is very pretty. It's soft and well made. It's also nice and large so can be worn many different ways.
5.0,I didn't like that they were so small for what I wanted them for but for the money they are okay.
5.0,Very comfortable and will by again
5.0,"The most comfortable band! Easy to put on, take off!"
5.0,"We have bought 2 of these wallets now for my daughters.  My younger daughter got one for Christmas and then my older daughter wanted one.  They work well for smaller purses and hold quite a bit.  The faux leather looks very nice and it comes in so many colors.  They have held up well. If you are looking for a smaller, inexpensive wallet that looks nice, I recommend this."
5.0,Love it. Bought 6 colors.
5.0,vire good
5.0,I love this shirt a little more snug than I thought it would but but super cute and flattering
5.0,Looks old school and came in great condition- thank you!
5.0,Great stadium bag!  Large enough for essentials. Adjustable crossbody strap is a plus. Very affordable.
5.0,Great with turtlenecks or sweaters.
5.0,"My son wore these all spring and summer and they are holding up really well! Beach, swimming, park.....He has not complained about comfort at all."
5.0,It isn’t very warm mostly just polyester but my son absolutely loves it you definitely wear it for the picture on it.
5.0,My husband loves this jacket. I was a little worried because it was so inexpensive but very well made and comfortable!
5.0,"These masks were fantastic.  My husband and I were attending a masquerade ball.  I purchased these masks so that I could wear my eyeglasses with them.  I was able to weave my wire rim glasses through the mask to wear it.  I could leave the mask on, still see everything, had my hands free and didn't have to deal with ties in my hair.  Definitely a win!!  Because there were different styles to select from, I could select the style that best worked with my eye glasses."
5.0,"I own a number of sports bras and they are not as comfortable as this one.  I ordered the large, as I am normally a 36C, and it fits well.  I ordered the peak green and it is bright and pretty, just like the picture.  The material is soft and with just the right amount of stretch.  It has enough compression to hold things in place, while not giving the feeling that I am being squeezed by a vice.  The straps are wide and adjustable, so they do not cut into my shoulders.  There is padding in this bra, which can be removed from the pockets by an opening on each side of the cup.  The back is racerback style, which adds to the comfort when I am exercising.  It makes such a big difference when I am exercising and I can wear something that gives the support I need, yet is comfortable to wear.  I would recommend this sports bra.<br /><br />I received this item free in exchange for using it and providing my honest, unbiased feedback.  The price I paid had no bearing on my review, as I have no relationship with the seller and I never guarantee a good review."
5.0,Very happy with the product. Fit as expected. I ordered the 4X for my daughter who wears a 3X. She loved it because it was big enough to wear other shirts underneath and still be roomy enough.
5.0,My son loved this.  Great quality.  Material is nice and stitching is amazing.
5.0,Divine fit and very luxurius‼️‼️
5.0,I placed an order that wasn't completely correct when I received it. But they made sure that I would be a very pleased customer at the end of the day. They are a company that you can trust to do the right thing to please as well as keep the customer wanting to return. Excellent job in turning a small mistake into a pleasurable experience.
5.0,"I love the room these shirts have provided my upper arms during tattoos. Also, the style has a normal neck. Large, wide neck openings are required at times, but rarely is the case with me. I like shirts that hug the neck. Overall, I am quite pleased with this purchase."
5.0,"Absolutely gorgeous! Nice thick material, incredible color, is VERY flattering."
5.0,This year is my daughter's first time playing soccer so we bought this for her. She loves it
5.0,My go to mask that makes me feel not only protected but stylish at the same time. Highly recommend!
5.0,"I got the XXL.<br />I usually buy XL, but this fit perfectly! My bust is 44.5 inches, US size J-cup, 5'6"" tall, and 175lbs.<br /><br />The only downside is the material is swimsuit material. I'm not sure how it'll feel in the hot summer weather, but just walking across the street in 96F weather didn't feel too good."
5.0,"It is a femine looking watch.  I l ove the way it looks on my wrist.  Good every day watch, I think it is a step up from timex, for that price and style."
5.0,I bought three and always stay satisfied
5.0,"Very nice in person, particularly at such a reasonable price. The red color is a nice deep color and not cheap looking. I also got the brown color, also nice. My husband appropriated it on sight to use for traveling with earphones, small cables etc.  I actually got this for a change purse for myself but will also use for travel pouch. It would be a good stocking stuffer too...."
5.0,It looks good. Did the job. Fitted on the phone. Might wrote another review as it age.
5.0,Wife in I loves this brand
5.0,Good quality. Very comfortable. Even after washing a few times they are still fitted. Like these socks a lot.
5.0,"Nice watch, no known problems"
5.0,We'll be wearing this on Christmas eve! Very nice product! We bought different sizes for all family. We are very happy with our purchase!
5.0,Beautiful bracelet. quick delivery
5.0,"Love it, will be ordering more for friends.  I like the fact that it is vinyl so it can easily be cleaned.  Very roomy, expands nicely to hold everything I had in my purse and more.  Best part is switching purses in the morning as I continuously run late and forget that I wanted to switch purses until I'm walking out the door.  Not a problem anymore, grab it by the little handles, plop it into the other handbag and I'm gone.  Certainly can't beat it especially for the price."
5.0,Very pretty and comfortable dress. I have received a lot of compliments on this dress.
5.0,"helpful correspondence with seller before purchase.......soft and pliable leather...nice pewter color clasp....unfortunately did not work for me, BUT grandson loves it!!!!!!!!!!!"
5.0,"Beautiful earrings, great price"
5.0,BUY THIS ONE!!!  This polishing cloth is far superior to a package of them I bought recently.  It is LARGE and SOFT.  Easy to use and does a great job!!!  Excellent product.  Top quality.
5.0,This product is sturdy and can carry weight up to 50 lbs. Made from 100% woven polypropylene and has a good seam running throughout the length of the bag. I would highly recommend this!
5.0,"Had these for a few weeks now, wood beads are awesome and full of character. After a few weeks of wear, the beads appear slightly weathered but that adds to the beauty of this piece. Love them!"
5.0,"Great quality mask that won’t disappoint you. Plus, it comes with two insertion filters."
5.0,"Nice feminine watch, delivered safely and on time!"
5.0,Blades are quiet and work flawlessly for the couple flights I have flown with them.  The blue compliments my camouflaged wrap.
5.0,"I bought it because I like the cut. The fabric is soft, I did use it to workout and I think fitted. Great, I look good and It didn’t show the sweat or stuck to my skin.<br /><br />I think would look good with jeans too, very casual T-shirt"
5.0,"Perfect size, great price"
5.0,Thank you & I'm buying another one!
5.0,I live this shirt!
5.0,My son loved this hat! I bought it as a gift and he wears it all the time!
5.0,These are great got them after giving birth very comfortable fit great. Perfect for what I needed
5.0,This chain really is huge! It is going to be a really fun photo prop at my sons hip hop themed birthday party.
5.0,Very easy to use. No allergy problem w/ these.
5.0,Just received this a few days ago and I love it! I wanted something small enough to clip on my keys. This is big enough to hold everything I need it to and small enough to clip to my keys when I don’t want to carry a purse!
5.0,Very cool glasses. I don't fake the funk; I tell people how much I paid for them and still get lots of compliments on them.
5.0,color and material are good<br />I can put my cell phone in it
5.0,Looks grate.
5.0,great shirts for the price!
5.0,"Came in a vacuum sealed package which made the material look weird and smelled odd but after I threw it in the dryer with some dryer sheets it fluffed it back up and got rid of the smell. Very thin but warm, feels like netting. Wish it didn't feel so delicate."
5.0,"I enjoy having bags that have different ways to open so I chose this bag. It is plenty big enough for my things plus any small things I get along the way. The drawstring is fun to open & close & in a hurry you don't even need to close it, just use the magnetic snap or nothing at all, everything stays in. The short strap is nicely wide which makes it work better on your shoulder for times when more security is needed. The fabric is strong & unlike many charms hanging on bags this cute tiny snap charm could hold a key or something of equal size."
5.0,"Seems nice quality. Just got it and tried it on, but haven’t really worn it yet. It is roomy, my husband wears a large and this is fine. I’m anticipating it shrinking a bit when it’s washed."
5.0,So great omg I love them!!!
5.0,Slightly bigger than I would have expected but not bad. Pocket on the side is very small. Can hold a set of keys. Very comfy!
5.0,This is a great affordable product and I would definitely buy this again. The shipping was pretty long but other than that It's awesome!
5.0,Better then expected color matches face exactly
5.0,Awesome wallet! I love this thing. ❤️
5.0,"Wonderful, warm hat. Perfect for winter in the mountains."
5.0,"Liked it so much, had to buy in another color.  This brand makes wonderful yoga related products."
5.0,"Very nice bathing suit, fit as expected, seems to be well constructed, and it is very flattering for my plus-size, pear-shaped figure. The pattern draws the eye up, and the skirt length is good for those of us who like a little extra modesty. The only thing I would change is the short length. They're too short and hit my thigh at the thickest point, which makes them roll up to where they may as well not be shorts. However they're still full coverage."
5.0,"Great quality, design and fit.  Nice product!!"

But no biggie!  this bag is cute and doesn't have the &#34;diaper bag&#34; look. I'm using it at as a carry on bag on our next trip too! Love it. Perfect for me and my 10 month old and all our crap haha!!

5.0,perfect for what im using it for!
5.0,"Love the ring. It’s very pretty and looks nice. I feel the sizing runs a little small, so think of that when ordering your regular size. Great purchase for the price."
5.0,So pretty and lightweight
5.0,"These are great!  Quality seems good, and the little girl I bought them for looks very cool in them. She really likes them too."

5.0,My daughter wore it for Halloween.  It was perfect for her
5.0,"The product is very comfortable to use, I like it very much."
5.0,These are better than expected. The texture of the finish is super cool and different from what I can find in local stores.  The polarized lens are just right for protection from the sun's rays but I can still see well (without it being too dark a lens as sometimes happens. The noseguards and hinges are also sturdy and stylist.  Was truly surprised by how lightweight these are and am enjoying wearing them already.

5.0,"Favorite Jammies!! So soft and beautiful pattern, ordering more!"
5.0,Fits perfectly! Awesome quality
5.0,"After reading the reviews, I decided to size down. I can usually fit into a small, but I would normally order a medium when ordering online. However, I ordered a small size skirt. The band has great stretch, which allowed it to tighten around my waist perfectly. Therefore, I would recommend ordering a size down."
5.0,Loved these and they were great for my July 4th party!
5.0,"so glad i found these on amazon, I have been buying them from mall stores for years at double the price. I have 22 piercings in my ears and I wear these in every hole. The hoop is small and a bit of a pain to clasp but I never take them out. The hinge is great for snags so there is no ear tearing. I do lose them now and then and that is the only reason I replace them."
5.0,My daughter loves these. She is able to slip in and out of her shoes much quicker and easier. She receives lots of complements from her friends at school about the colors.
5.0,"Looks great,works great. Fits my larger wrist perfectly."
5.0,This scarf is a great size. It seems to be created with terrific quality. My wife says the scarf is not only warm but comfortable against her skin. The black sparkly stars is a really cute addition.  The stars don’t leave glitter trailing everywhere.  I highly recommend this scarf. It’s my wife’s favorite.
5.0,Warm an it servers it's purp.
5.0,"Great leggings! Smoothing and pulls the stomach in. They also don’t ruffle or fold when working out. The color is great too, definitely will be ordering other pairs. I ordered a medium and the length is good for my 5’1 height."
5.0,"Looking for a good sandal for the price.  This is the one.  Fits and feels fine; however, don't know about durability."
5.0,Got it for my 2 year old son because he is always finding change somewhere and he loves it!
5.0,"I am 59 yr old,  5'4&#34; and 120lbs, 34-36C.  The reviews say to order a larger size.  I usually wear a medium or small in regular clothes.  Bathing suits are generally tight and feel small on me - I like my butt covered - so I ordered the xl.  I returned the xl for a large which fits a little big but I'm keeping it.  I could have went down to a medium, but the butt coverage is good on this one and I didn't want to take a chance that a medium might be too small.  It's a lovely suit, very flattering, good material and construction.  I will buy again, but I might try a medium."
5.0,Love love love. You won't be disappointed.
5.0,"I’ve had so many compliments over these sandals . I can wear them dressed up or down and the material seems to be strong and sturdy. At first I was nervous if I walked for long periods of time they would break, but Ive worn them about 10times, and they are amazing !"
5.0,In love with this bag
5.0,Comfortable and lightweight enough to walk 18 holes!
5.0,"LOVE IT!! Great Value. Very well made. Shipped on time. Big enough without being too big. I use the sling to hold my puppy's stuff when we go out. The back pocket holds her food, the front pocket holds treats, a small toy and her collapsible dishes and the main pocket holds her harness, collar, leash, my wallet and my snacks. The d-rings on front holds her poop bags and my keys. The mesh drink holder holds our water bottle for when we get thirsty. The cell phone pocket fits my Samsung s8+ with a case so I can talk hands free while I walk my puppy. If you are looking for a small, but not too small, sling I highly recommend this sling."
5.0,Very cute fun boots
5.0,Love it!!! It's way to big but that's on me!!! Lol I love it anyway!!! It's nice and comfy! Will order from them again. Arrived right on time!!!
5.0,"This piece of jewelry is absolutely beautiful! It has a nice weight to it (not flimsy at all) beautiful edges and a really nice chain. I know I am gushing over it , but I honestly didn't expect it to be as nice as it was. I am a huge LoZ fan and this piece is a great addition to any collection. I bought this as a gift and then turned around and bought one for myself. The box it came in was perfect for gift-giving. The piece itself didn't have any scratches, but it does smudge easily but holding it by the edges takes care of that."
5.0,This is a superb company that provides high quality shirts with perfectly designed graphics.  I've already ordered a couple different size products from them and each has been flawless in its fit and finish.  The communication throughout the ordering process was also an example of customer service at its absolute finest.  I certainly feel confident recommending Comical Shirt to anyone.
5.0,"Good glasses at a great price! Very pleased with my new readers! Frames are lite, yet feel sturdy. I am male, the style of the frames are subtle, which I like.  I will be buying more in the future; as I lose them!"

5.0,I ordered the small and received a medium. Its a bit big but because of the fit of the sweater it doesnt make much of a difference. exactly as pictured. very cute and extremely comfy.
5.0,Love this band! So pretty and good quality. Series 4 Apple Watch 42mm
5.0,"These are very lightweight, very comfortable on the nose (I barely feel them during a 20 minute treadmill speed walk), and, so far, the nose pads (did I mention they're comfy?) have not fallen off, like has happened with several different types I've tried. And they do not feel flimsy. Nice case, feels like it would protect them."
5.0,Bought for my girlfriend who just got her full sleeve tattoo finished. She needed to keep it out of the sun for a bit. Living in Hawaii it hard to keep away from the sun. They fit perfectly
5.0,Great buy! I use it all the time and still no wear and tear!

5.0,It’s so adorable and looks exactly like the photo !!
5.0,"What is best about this dress is that it is not Minnie Mouse Costume.  My 4 year old granddaughter wants to wear it all the time.  She plans on adding a Bow and ears to wear it on Halloween!  Good quality and fit, easy for a child to put on and take off. The tutu bottom of the dress is adorable."
5.0,Great hat!  Better than expected and received it before promised!
5.0,"Great add on to anyone collecting TMNT stuff, this pin celebrates 35 years of Turtles with this pin showcasing both old and new versions of Donnie."

5.0,Very good details got many compliments i really like it totally recommend it
5.0,"I bought this for my daughter, she is 6 month right now but I think this summer when she is 1 years old she will be able to fit in it and walk around. Super cute design , the shoes is very soft, feels very comfortable for babies and toddlers to wear it to walk. Great for summer time!"
5.0,I like them very much. Its confortable and great for work out.
5.0,"Perfect - wide, soft, absorbent, and washes well."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:9111b2a1b70b1bb8132bab0068a24043]] This is the first pair of battery heated gloves that I own, they seem to work as advertised but I am still waiting for winter to try them to their full potential.  My left fingers had an injury which keeps them cold in the winter so for me this was a useful purchase."
5.0,Great hat !!! Go Raiders !!!
5.0,"This is such a flattering top! The lace is gorgeous, and the way it lays off the shoulders is really pretty! I also like that it's a little long, I'm a tall woman at 5'11, and it is amazing! Because the description said it fits small, I went from an XL to a 2Xl, its a little baggy, but not too much, it's also extremely flattering!"
5.0,Price and engraved design are awesome!
5.0,"I will differently be getting more when I run low, I cut off the eye hook and file it down to make charms for shakers, the little seahorse is just too adorable and I can't wait to get more."

5.0,Fits great I have big hand and they did I didn’t have no problem
5.0,Great glasses and case
5.0,Love them super comfortable and long
5.0,"Hey, this is a pretty nice watch. Got the gold & silver. Sharp! For the money this is amazing. It was even shipped with the correct time. A quick manual sync to my atomic clock app and it's all set. Only minor drawback is there isn't any lume on the hands. So you can't see the time in the dark. No biggie. Familiar with this style of band, I found it very easy to adjust and lock in to size. Used a dart tip or small stiff jewelers screwdriver. Thin, stylish and light weight, I like it better than my recently purchased Bering. It makes traditional styled watches look old, bulky and obsolete. Definite keeper. Recommended.<br /><br />Watch is running a second slow in less than a week.<br /><br />*Update*-July 2: Watch is now only 5 seconds fast. Pretty amazing since its been a few months. To me the style is reminiscent of my grandfather back in the '60's. When I look at it I can smell unfiltered camel cigarette smoke and have visions of LBJ. Strange I know. But the watch keeps good time and is still recommended."
5.0,They are fabulous 💕
5.0,Love this dress. It fits snug so if you order a size up it will be ok. Good quality fabric. Good quality work.
5.0,"Wanted a pair of snow pants that had a bib. These are insulated all the way up and down and keep me super warm in the frigid Minnesota air. Wish they had some elastic at the bottom to keep snow from coming up my pants, but it hasn't been an issue yet."
5.0,The recipient loved this gift.
5.0,Fits perfect didn’t need to hem and I’m 5’ tall! I bought the bright pink and the color and design is amazing ! I will be ordering another in a different color.
5.0,I was surprised with how well its made considering how much I paid for it. I would definitely buy again. I don't usually leave reviews but I felt this deserved it
5.0,"I love , Love , Love this purse.  I am a dalmatian lover and pretty much own anything and everything dalmatian. (including a real one). When I saw this purse I knew I must have it.<br />It is a smaller bag, big enough for a check book sized wallet, a cell phone and maybe a few extras.  Has 2 quality pockets one on each side. and one inside to safely store Keys or mints.<br />Its pretty durable and the zippers work GREAT ,  The Rhine stones have managed to stay on so far  so I would say t his is a great deal for the money.<br />also a plus its vegan leather so you can feel good about your self toting this stylish bag around."
5.0,"Living in Florida I struggle to find comfy pajamas that are short sleeved (or sleeveless) and shorts. These are perfect! They are soft, thin, and they are so comfortable."

5.0,These worked great as rescue flats for a Dorothy costume I wore over Halloween this year.  I haven't danced in years but they fit as I remember split sole soft shoes should.  They have a great profile/fit and decent quality for the price!  I even threw them in the wash and let them air dry after our night out and they held up great.  Highly recommended.
5.0,"These sunglasses are gorgeous, I love them! :)"
5.0,I am 32DD I weigh 107 pounds I purchased a D cup and bra was extremely big so ladies if your petite like me make sure to buy a cup size smaller! I returned my item and received a fast refund the seller contact me to try another product free of charge so I ordered there silicone self adhesive push up bra in size C cup and I love the bra better than ultra light backless.
5.0,"la tela es muy fresca y cómoda, al lavarlo no queda aspera y sigue siendo cómoda incluso en las costuras no le molesta"

5.0,"This shirt is what I wanted, but a bit heavy for our summer weather. Will be great beginning with fall. I’m 40 DD and had to get 2X. I don’t want sloppy, but don’t want tight either. It was perfect.  Will likely order different color."

Very convenient. Thank you, will definitely be buying from you again."

5.0,I love my charm.
5.0,"I love this credit card holder!<br />Most typical wallets where either falling apart or bending my cards causing them to stop working or cracking them. The cardholder is still like brand new and, I have seriously put it through hell and back, It still looks brand new and fits conveniently in my front pocket. With it's size and RFID blocking properties, I feel very secure carrying my cards with me and don't have to worry about scanner thieves. On another note, some people might look at this and wonder, &#34;How easy will it be to get the exact card I want out?&#34; but you shouldn't stress about that. Yes, there might be a slight learning curve but once figure it out, it becomes second nature. Great job Atizloose."
5.0,My husband love this!

5.0,Little bit longer than my expectation but looks amazing. I get compliments every time I wear this dress.

5.0,I purchased these for biking in the summer months and they work great to protect your hands from the sun. They are light weight and easy to get on off. I would recommend for biking
5.0,The picture does not do this necklace justice!  It is absolutely stunning and fits well with my raven pendant I wear! My picture doesn't do the justice of how it looks in person!
5.0,Love this top! It’s so comfortable and cute.
5.0,"Was super cute and perfect for my gravity falls cosplay! The hat was warm, but not too overbearingly hot. It is snug and kept my wig intact underneath it. I totally reccomend ! :)"

5.0,"I love this hat protects from sun and glare and I can squish it up to fit in tote and it keeps its shape, plus it has a torso it won't blow away in wind or you want to take it off to see and you will never lose it b cause it's on your neck;)"
5.0,Does as advertised.

5.0,Soft and not too thick. Cute and comfortable. Adjustable around the nose and ears.
5.0,Love this shirt so much I bought another one. It is see through in front but has another layer in the front. In the back you can kind of see your bra straps but I don't care about that. It's so light for summer.
5.0,Love these glasses! :3
5.0,"I adore these pants!<br />I'm usually a size  1x, or a 14 in bottoms, and I ordered a size 5x for these. They fit like a dream.<br />The only thing is, I would have preferred them a tad bit shorter because I wanted more of like a capri fit, and these were right at my ankles (I'm 5'5 btw).<br />If you're my size, you could probably get a 4x if you wanted them shorter, but otherwise they are perfect! Super cute and boho, and really cute with a striped top or a crop top."
5.0,So very lovely!  Thank you!
5.0,"Purchased as a surprise Christmas gift for my daughter.  She absolutely loves it.  So many compliments to the special places we went over the holidays.  It is very light-weight, but that's what makes it so easy to wear."

I cant recommend them enough!"
5.0,"I liked that the product was delivered on time, and it was of great quality."
5.0,"Love this dress!! The material is opaque and kind of shiny feeling. The back is a bit lower than expected, but that's okay. Doesn't feel cheap or poorly made at all. Bought the navy blue and might buy again in black."
5.0,Just what I wanted. Quality fabric
5.0,Excellent craftsmanship! my daughter loved It!
5.0,Fine product of good quality.  To unfasten the buckle you have to activate a small level on the bottom of the buckle which is unlike other ratchet belts I've purchased.
5.0,"This dress is INCREDIBLE.  It highlights all the right places! Great for all heights too! I'm super short and it was long-ish, but I LOVED IT.  I received more compliments wearing this dress than EVER in my life!!! Will likely buy in other colors!!! I would give it 10 stars if I could!!"

5.0,"I like wearing tall socks to the gym sometimes, and these socks were no exception. They are black with bright colors so they go with almost any outfit, and they provide some protection against rope climbs. They didn’t shrink in the wash and have held up well."
5.0,"I bought this to wear after I woke up from shoulder surgery My nurse and I were ecstatic about it. I also used a bandolier style bra. I was home by myself, and this made things super easy during those first few days after. It's also helpful for PT. Although I won't get much use out of it normally, it definitely already paid for itself before I even left the hospital."
5.0,Great glasses for a great price! I can’t complain!!!
5.0,"The Spikerking Women Long Section Short-sleeved T-shirt Dress Beachwear Cover Up is very nice.<br /><br />It came packaged well, folded neatly in a plastic bag. It was not wrinkled. It is as descrived on Amazon, oly it looks black but it is acutally naby. Has a very nice white paisley/floral type print.<br /><br />it fits great! It does fit a little tight over my hips (I have wide hips), but I think the way it is sewn, kind of bunched up, the seem can be let out a little bit and this will help the tightness and cover my bottom better. it is light weight and breathable. It is a wrinkle free fabric.<br /><br />It will look great with leggings. Can be worn with a cardigan when it's chilly out since it is short sleeved. Can be casual or dressy.<br /><br />I like that the neck line is high enough that you can't see my girls or cleavage. It's not too high that it irritates your neck. Very modest and flattering.<br /><br />Very good quality at a reasonable price. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />I purchased this product at discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion."
5.0,Good quality belts
5.0,I love these pants! Great purchase for myself. I will be ordering more for Christmas gifts.
5.0,I bought a size up thinking it would shrink in the drier but should have got his regular size. The fabric is really soft and he loves it.
5.0,"Se ven tan bonitos y pese a que los cerre bien, inclusive asi los quitaron de mi maleta. Si los compran ponganles hasta colaloca al broche para que no les pase."
5.0,Nice head wrap for bikers!  Flame accent is cool.
5.0,Product arrived in great condition and was exactly as advertised.
5.0,Husband loves them. Would wear everyday if he could.
5.0,"Absolutely love my case.  I knew as soon as I came across it I had to purchase it, I have no regrets.  It was shipped and delivered much sooner than I thought.  Thank you"
5.0,Purchased these for the office and home and they are perfect!  It may look like a yellow tint but it is not.  Works great!
5.0,I found this to be somewhat small but not so small that I can not use it. I would order a size bigger then the chart shows. It is made of very soft light weight material and will be great for wearing over a tank or sun dress. It was a little wrinkled when I received it but I just threw it in the dryer and they came right out. This is a very nice product. I received this item at a discount for my honest review.
5.0,This necklace would make a great gift as it looks great quality and has a great message. The gold is not too shiny and looks authentic . The price in this necklace is very affordable for what you are getting and most importantly the necklace is well made
5.0,Comfortable.  Like that ear slings can be adjusted.  Received compliments.
5.0,I really love my waistbands they are very comfortable
5.0,"True to its description. I replaced my leather watch band with these VimVip 20mm silicon sport band, just for work. I have to say... I'm not despondent at all. They look and feel great. Even comes with a tool to help you with installation of the band pins, which even comes with the bands"
5.0,I like to send these in a card. As we are all under so much stress and facing many challenges these days !!! God bless
5.0,"Has held up so far, nice quality as well!"
5.0,This little hummingbird has defied the laws of aerodynamics. All things are possible
5.0,Haven't used them yet other than to text the rollers which seem to work great.  Nice appearance and nice quality for the price.
5.0,The product has been in use for some time and is holding up well with the wear and tear in my trouser pocket.  No wear on the logo yet.  It holds enough bills to get me through my purchases and need to carry pocket change.
5.0,beautiful<br />Perfect
5.0,I love them one of the roses I didn't know it would be that large but it is ok I can make it work
5.0,The material is super thick and has a rich color. Holds your body firmly. Fits perfectly
5.0,The cross with the colors is so nice.
5.0,"Nice zip, thick, tangle free zipper with excellent quality materials."
5.0,The best one I’ve used so far other ones are too tight or fall in front of my face.
5.0,The wallet shipped quickly and I love it. I like that it has plenty of room for all my cards and I can carry it anywhere knowing my information is safe.
5.0,"I love the price point on these sandals. Even better than that is that they are just as good as, if not better than, Oofos. Every pair of Oofos I have owned, the toe piece has broken. These have a thicker toe piece. We will see how these hold up."
5.0,"These ‘loafer’ shoes are attractive yet still comfortable. My hubby has feet neuropathy and these he can wear better than so many he’s tried last couple years. And he’s tried them all, including a foot doctors recommended pairs."
5.0,"Very comfortable, wash well, and hold their shape.  I'll be ordering more come fall."
5.0,My daughter loves these .. did not get stuck in her hair
5.0,"This purchase has proven to be my absolute favorite purse. I've been using it for a week. The leather is soft and supple. There's enough space for all my stuff and my phone fits easily in the outside pocket. I love how I can switch between the short or long strap, depending on my need or look. I'm truly impressed with this purchase. I've never bought a purse online, so my expectation wasn't high, but my Heshe purse is awesome. I also enjoyed how the company sends a personal email too. They are very courteous and right there for you, if you need them.<br /><br />**Update 03/24/2017** I use this purse everyday and it's proven to be the BEST handbag. It's the perfect size and haven't had any trouble with it. I highly recommend."
5.0,Just received this dress and I ordered it in a large size although I am a medium size. Fits perfectly. I am a 5'6&#34; 160 lb and the dress could have been a little longer but its ok...at least I won't trip in it...you can see the shoes though... The fabric is light and soft. The lilac color is gorgeous. I would recommend buying but a size larger because it is Oriental size and it runs smaller.
5.0,Nice quality and so cute....bought for my great granddaughter.
5.0,it was as advertised
5.0,"Love, love love!  This beautiful handmade necklace is original and stylish!  It's well made, casual and elegant at the same time timeless.  With the versatile design it can be worn with jeans, little black dress and out on the Town!<br /><br />It's a great travel piece because I don't have to worry about losing it, given the reasonable price and it goes very well with everything.  You'll have fun adjusting the length for different occasions.  I truly love this piece!"
5.0,As I thought they would be
5.0,"The belt that came with them went in the trash right away, but the pants fit perfectly based on taking measurements. I wore them to hike 18 miles for their first use and they were cool, comfortable, and stayed dry. I got compliments on them too, so they are attractive as well. New favorite pants for outdoor activities."
5.0,I lost a bet and had to wear something Rams. I wore this sheep horn headband on top of a Rams hat. LOL.
5.0,These fit great and look good.
5.0,Everyone Like's Them.
5.0,Well made. Bigger than expected. Worked well in organizing lugggage.
5.0,Awesome these are great and fit our daughter perfectly.
5.0,Good quality and works great
5.0,love it and it what I wanted
5.0,"I remember wearing Champion gear 30 years ago when it wasn’t cool but very affordable for the family. Now that it’s the thing to wear I figure I would get a vest.  I’m glad that I did.  Fits perfectly.  Looks great, just like I remember when i was a kid."
5.0,Love them!!! They are so comfy and so warm!!! They look just like the picture. Some slippers after you wear them the softness at the bottom of your feet go away. Not these!!!!
5.0,Good for more pockets
5.0,Great soft feel.  Very short and stylish. No too bulky.  I will purchase more in different colors.
5.0,"Perfect, adjustable and a great official way to ask someone to be your bridesmaid!"
5.0,super cute! love this dress- i just have a longer torso for someone who is 5'4 so the Small was a tad bit short but i can still pull it off.
5.0,I ordered this onesie for my baby's first birthday. Beautiful gold glitter letters & glitter doesn't fall off the onesie.
5.0,"Super soft and great fit.. Love the waist hides my love handles and does not slip down while working out or running. No muffin top. I am 5'4&#34; and 130 lbs. I've had 4 kids oldest 11 and youngest 2 years old. Kids and getting older have taken a toll on my stomach and thighs. I fluctuate between 120-130 lbs depending on my activity level working out, winter lazy season and eating habits.  I wear these 5-6 days a week for working out, lounging around the house, yard work or running errands with my kids. These pants feel too good not to wear and hide all my extra love handles. Bonus, they make the rear-end look amazing and compliments from my husband. :) I finally had to order more pairs because one pair always was in the wash or dirty laundry. Now I have three pairs in navy, black, and charcoal grey.  I'll probably order another pair soon as winter where leggings every day approaches.<br /><br />For size reference I ordered a size small and they fit great. Form fitting and don't get loose or sag throughout the day or at the gym working out. I also ordered the high-waisted version and love those too. They cover more of the lower belly mommy pooch. :)"
5.0,"They are not itchy. They hug my legs and make me feel very, very warm."
5.0,"Excellent quality, Sterling silver, perfect size for a charm bracelet. You cannot beat the price. Highly recommend"
5.0,It is absolutely beautiful and perfect!
5.0,Very happy with this purchase. Was hesitant as it’s not “official” but for my 6 year old I didn’t want to spend $100 on a jersey. The quality was excellent (soft jersey material.. definitely not t-shirt like some other reviews) and it fit great. Highly recommend this product for the price.
5.0,Love my PR cap
5.0,I just bought this hat recently and it looks freakin awesome!! I've already had people telling me how much they like it! :D Good quality too.
5.0,I wear these all the time around the house.

5.0,I love the sparkle and wear the crystal rhinestone earrings all the time -- they match a lot of different colors and outfits.  Perfection.  Thank you!
5.0,bought this for a friend for christmas and she absolutely loves it.  Fits perfect and no need to tie it since it is velco. The velcro holds nicely and doesn't come loose

5.0,"It is a great quality hoodie, very thick and durable. My daughter loves it, fits liek a glove. Im very happy I purchased this product!!"
5.0,thank you Amazon my mom lives up in St Augustine Florida and this went to her as a gift for everything that she has done for me I'm a special needs young man that lives down here in Mount pleasant South Carolina and my mom loves it so much thank you
5.0,My daughter loves this headband. She wears it at all her games.
5.0,"I bought this in a size small for my 12 year old son who is 5'3 and around 125 pounds and it fits him perfectly.  It's very lightweight, but he reports it is warm enough for a cold Wisconsin winter morning (around 12 degrees).  At least it was warm enough for a 5 minute wait for the bus- can't verify if you want to wear this for hours in freezing cold.  Looks attractive to.  I'm hoping it holds up to a kid yanking on the zipper for a few months and cramming things into the pockets."
5.0,UPDATE on the second piece was worn and is stained....<br />I am buying more of it because is so perfect.<br />The fabric is soft and super stretchy because I'm 5.2' it hangs half inch below my knee but is so beautiful that that does not matter at all.
5.0,"Love my rose lapel pins, I get compliments all the time. Great buy for the price."
5.0,Beautiful amethyst color.  Dresses up very nicely.
5.0,I love it! It fits so well. And so cute.

5.0,Elegante camisa de vestir
5.0,Such a great jacket! I love that the material is thick but thin enough to be super comfortable! I want more colors! Loving this as we get into the cooler season!
5.0,Bought these to help hold up my pants when I put tools in my back pockets.  I don’t use the included pads.  They seem well made after a while of daily use and don’t slip like ones made of all elastic.  I like them a lot so far.
5.0,"Love this top, I get so many complements about the colors! Fit is great, washes great!"
5.0,I just received my order and was pleasantly surprised to see that the batteries are actually Hubsan batteries! I have them charging up right now.

5.0,"Just what we were looking for, great for our craft project!"
5.0,Good quality and well worth the money
5.0,"Ok, let me just start by saying WOW! Im very impressed and satisfied with this strap. I’ve bought so many straps before, from handmade to custom made ones, and this product is worth every penny you pay. Beautifully crafted, true to color. If you were to have this custom made it would cost you 3 times the amount you pay here. I’m ordering the other 2 colors.<br /><br />JUST BEAUTIFUL!"
5.0,"It is just as cute as it looks in the pictures. The ribbon trim makes it look more like a piece of clothing than a dance costume. The ribbon is a great touch, too. Its worth getting multiple colors. Red and magenta colors are as pictured."
5.0,"I really love this toiletry bag!  It is durable and well-made.  I had a similar style in the past, and the zippers broke within a week of daily use.  This is really holding up.  I keep the makeup that I wear almost daily in this.  The little hook on it lets me hang it on the back of the bathroom door, and the way it is set up lets me keep all of my makeup organized and within reach.  No more digging around in makeup bags and finding the top of my loose powder has come off and gotten on everything (Oh, that never happens to you?  Yeah, me neither.  NOT ANYMORE!)  Now when I go anywhere overnight or anything, I just take it off the door, zip it up, and I am good to go.  It really keeps everything in place and handy.  I cannot recommend this particular bag enough."
5.0,Price is good Quality better
5.0,It’s handy but a little difficult if u want to use the scribble feature
5.0,Love this purse!! Bigger then expected but so worth it!! Love that you can wear it as a &#34;under the arm&#34; purse or a messenger bag!!
5.0,Very soft comfortable material.<br />Fits as described. Love everything about<br />this top.
5.0,Nice Pants. No complaints!
5.0,"The genuine sheepskin leather is incredibly soft and supple, while the Thinsulate lining keeps my hands warm even in the coldest of temperatures of Hyak Sno-park."
5.0,Great jogging pants.
5.0,So cute.  Ordered it again
5.0,I usually wear XL in shirts. So I bought XL. But I had to return for a bigger size. Didn't fit like my regular shirts fit with XL. Rather than that loved the shirt. Soft. looked really good. Just to tight in the arms.
5.0,I love the looks and the feel !
5.0,Fast delivery great sturdy earrings
5.0,I have given several as gifts. Everyone loved them.
5.0,The fit is exactly as expected. I have little US women’s size 5B and these always fit great.<br />Magnolia pattern is very cute.<br />The Keds Champion is my go-to casual shoe and I am very happy to add this one to my collection
5.0,I bought various dance necklaces for students from this distributor and all of the girls just loved them!! High quality with lots of sparkle.  Look even better than in the pictures!!  Will definitely purchase from Glamour Girl Gifts (only) in the future!!!  Thank you - you made me quite the hit with all the girls!!
5.0,I love the purple! I love space and all the pockets!I love that it doubles as a bag or backpack!
5.0,It's such a beautiful bag. It's worth it. I wear it everyday and it's soo cute with every outfit. Classic guess logo.two leather straps you can wear this as a cross body bag or shoulder bag it's really versatile. Not too big but perfect to carry everything you need. Don't hesitate.
5.0,Love and fits.
5.0,This anti-fog spray is awesome. My glasses always fogged up when walking or going inside stores while wearing a mask due to COVID. The spray totally works like a charm. Just spray on and wait 20 seconds before wiping off with a cloth. Highly recommend.
5.0,These are just beautiful.
5.0,"I have given this, as a gift, to two of my favorite women and they absolutely loved it."
5.0,"I like the length.  Fit is excellent and it washes well and did not shrink.  Sleeve length is perfect, just above the elbow.  The seams are nicely finished.<br /><br />Con: Washed a second time and it did shrink about 1 1/2 in I believe it was due to the water temp and maybe the dryer ."
5.0,Love these socks - I have several pairs - very comfortable - goes well with crocs!
5.0,My daughter-in-law loves this shirt I bought her! Also need to mention the exceptional customer service I got. This seller went above and beyond. I appreciate their great service very much!
5.0,All cute designs perfect little valentine's gift for the ladies in my office.
5.0,"Far exceeded my expectations. I didn’t want to write a review till I washed the socks a few time because anyone who buys wool socks knows that after you wash them a few times the cheap ones will lose all form and need to be constantly pulled up throughout the day. I am happy to say these have not lost their shape and require no adjustment throughout the day. When I I totally received them they felt soft but I questioned the thinness of the material. It turned out that they weren’t as thin as originally thought and while not super thick, the thickness is perfect for both providing warmth while allowing moisture to escape. The first morning I had them I went for about a three mile walk, with an outside temp around 25 degrees wearing walking shoes. Usually with normal white exercise socks my feet get cold and numb, or when I put on the thick warm camping socks I have, they get hot and extremely moist. These socks left my feet in the perfect condition. Warm and not moist. I was really pleased because the price point was almost generous. When I initially saw the price I just assumed they would be a three month sock before I bought more. That’s not the case at all. So in sum, the quality, comfort and price make these socks easily five stars. A really great find. Thank you ViGrace! I’m looking forward to trying other products you have on amazon. I’m not going to add a picture because I’m not a feet guy, but the stock picture is accurate as to what it looks like."
5.0,Just fabulous!
5.0,I bought these beauties to give as gifts and ended up keeping them! They are so lovely! Great worn together or separately; very cute compliment to jeans & t- shirt look. They are made well & arrived on time.

5.0,"I bought this for my brother, he loves it."

5.0,I get complimented every time I wear this top! I love it.
5.0,"Easy to use, the magnetic is strong, good design, great for everyday use."
5.0,Purchased as a gift and well received. Nice shirt.
5.0,Got it for my dad for Christmas and he loved it. :)
5.0,"Very cute Ariel nightgown. My daughter loved it.  I purchased it with a flounder plushy and she loves to sleep with it.  Very nice to gift for any little girl who loves princesses.  Washes well too.  It is a bit bigger than expected but kids outgrow their clothes fast, so it's ok.<br />Would recommend."
5.0,It runs about a size too small but i still love it.  I bought a size up is why it works.  Very cute and comfortable i get many complements every time i wear because it's different
5.0,I’ve gotten so much use outta this wallet! It is awesome! People compliment it all the time (which is an added plus lol) um the only thing is that the zipper sometimes doesn’t get closed all the way and my change falls out into my purse.
5.0,Love it!! Amazing material!! Fits perfectly!! ❤❤ I'm 5'4 150lbs and I bought a Medium...
5.0,Super cute and chic. I always receive compliments on them when i wear them out.

5.0,Adorable. Love the fabric. Fits so cute on my daughter.
5.0,"I love the quality and the shirt fits so great!However, it does fit more like a crop top."
5.0,Is excellent coat
5.0,One of my casual toppers. Great with leggins.
5.0,I love them!!<br />the quality was great for the price and I can’t get over how soft they are!
5.0,My daughter loves these. I no longer have to keep telling her to put something on her feet!!
5.0,Just the right weight. Just the right number of pockets. The only wrong feature is lack of additional colors. Mesquite color is fine but we need at least 2 more: dark brown and black.
5.0,"Thanks, very nice."
5.0,Adorable hat at a reasonable price
5.0,The sweater fits perfectly and is soft and stylish. The color is exactly as pictured and is a nice soft color. It is very warm and is perfect for cold weather.
5.0,"Fit perfectly! I was a little worried because I'm tall, but it fit fine.<br />I'm 6'0 and ordered a small"
5.0,Muy Lindo y una tela agradable
5.0,Love it... great quality... great fit...<br />I'm a bigger guy.... with a bigger head...<br />This hat fits me really well...
5.0,Came with 2 parts I wasn't sure what to do with. Apparently they go across your shoulders.
5.0,Great product for the price. Fits nicely and holds it's shape. True to size chart and the color is beautiful.
5.0,"Such a cute ensemble, love it!"
5.0,"Does a great job on my 7X Beaver, perfect size!"
5.0,Innought this as a birthday present for my sister and she loved it
5.0,"I really like this sling bag!! It has just enough room for my wallet, credit cards, keys & cell!! I have tendacy to<br />Overstuff! So, try not to do that!<br />I’m enjoying this sling bag color as well! It has the ability to hang on your right side or left because their are loops on both sides with a hook on the strap. Lastly, the woven strap is very sturdy and hangs nicely off my left side. I may purchase a black bag in this style to provide versatility. Love it!"
5.0,A fantastic option for the tactix delta sapphire. Very comparable to the band that came with the watch. Only used it a week so a little early to rate the durability but I don’t see an issue and at a quarter of the price that Garmin is asking for the replacement it was a no brainer for me.
5.0,I really love this. It’s simple and yet really elegant.<br />I think it looks cute and it’s nice and light
5.0,Very  good craftsmanship and material long lasting wearing
5.0,This was exactly what daughter wanted and it fit perfectly.
5.0,Love these jeans. They fit well!
5.0,"Excellent wallet very clever design, really works well.  I have 11 plastic cards in it room for one more."
5.0,"I purchased the black bracelet and very surprised first, by how pretty it is and secondly, how it fits my wrist perfectly. I don't like dangling bracelets so I was looking for ones that are the stretch kind and that will fit nicely. These met my standards. I am very happy with my purchased and now going to buy all the rest of the colors!"
5.0,They were just as pictures.  Nice quality.  My grandson loved them!
5.0,Just wish Oakley didn't  stop making the lenses for the Pro M
5.0,I am so happy with this purchase so far! Lots of zippered pockets and looks cute
5.0,LOVE Stance socks and this is a great graphic
5.0,Great quality and fit. A must buy for all current and former military personnel.
5.0,I've had this backpack for over a year and I use it from time to time and I haven't had any problems. Works away a backpack should work. Small enough to put on my back and carry small items like a tablet and the wallet but not bulky. It is definitely a great value.
5.0,"A little bigger than expected, but looks great nonetheless. Soft material and easy slip on. I wore this dress with a blazer for my first trial and I felt confident in my attire. I love it so much I purchased it in 2 other colors."
5.0,"So I just got these last week Friday. The reason why I bought these was because I needed a new pair of running shoes. These fit as expected. They are light weight and, can fit into luggage or a backpack. I haven't tried running in them yet but, I plan on doing so sometime this week. I would recommend these shoes to people who like shoes that feel very light or shoes that feel as if the wearer is barefoot. One drawback I can see for this shoe is, people who need support for their feet. These shoes are very minimalist in support. I hope that this review helps people consider purchasing these shoes."
5.0,I have my fair share of bad watch bands but this one is an exception! The color is vivid and it doesn’t look cheap.
5.0,"Tal como en la foto, lindos colores y buena calidad de tela"
5.0,I love this product. Just wish it provided more room when you speak.
5.0,Bought for hubby and he absolutely loves loves loves them . Has a great soft material for all day comfort .
5.0,I love these and have actually slept with them in.<br />The back doesn't pierce into your neck like you think they would
5.0,Cute. Could be tighter.
5.0,Lovely package. .... exactly how I imagined it
5.0,"These sunglasses are a gift for a friend, and they look great, are well made, and come with a fantastic zippered case and an extra surprise. Lots of bang for your bucks!"
5.0,Love this dress fits great it worked great for spring wedding. I just bought another one in red!!
5.0,Very comfortable and perfect fir for women.
5.0,Fits really well and the material is super soft.
5.0,Very comfortable good product
5.0,"Very good for the price. Not too big or bulky, not too small"
5.0,I like a soft wide strap on my purses. This made a great replacement strap
5.0,Fits my daughter perfectly. She is comfortable and it is not too clingy. The price is good and the product is well made.
5.0,This is the cutest wallet ever it took a long time to receive it doesn't take up much space in my purse ni realized I needed a wallet for change my six year old always ask for gun in the machines when we are out and I never have any because I never have anything to carry it in this is perfect
5.0,Nice solid and weighted necklace- I like the fact that it is stainless steel as it will keep it from turning or tarnishing much better than the plated variety of jewelry.<br />The cuts on the metal make it look really stylish and dressy but can be worn every day as well- It is well made and looks like an expensive piece<br />Nice lobster claw clasp keeps it secure and the weight of the metal helps keep it from sliding around your neck a lot.<br />I did buy this necklace at a discount and I always give my honest review for products. I like this necklace and the seller was prompt and quick so I can recommend it. It also comes with a velvet storage pouch to keep it in when you are not wearing it. Nice piece
5.0,Used these as a Girl Scout Troop gift. I ironed on felt letters without any issues. Really great value would purchase again.
5.0,Beautiful case. Well made and attractive
5.0,"These are so easy to wear. Like all clip on earrings, they do start hurting but after a good 12 hours. Plus you can't tell they are clip ons, even with this stud style."
5.0,As you can see this mask is really scary and really accurate! So glad I purchased it ! Everyone loved it !
5.0,"Absolutely adorable. Not too girly. Great for spring, cool summer nights at the drive in or fall wear."
5.0,Love this swim suit! You can be active at the beach or pool while still looking cute!
5.0,Best purchase I’ve made all year
5.0,For the price of these they were well worth it.<br />It did take me about 30 minutes of sitting in front of the mirror bending them to my teeth and repeatedly trying them on before they would stay. Once I had them perfectly fitted to my teeth I used the wax to mold them in place. Make sure you do not over heat the wax but def get it hot enough to be moveable. Hold them in place for about a minute and a half.<br />It's super hard to talk in them and I'm sure you couldn't eat or drink with them but for a Halloween costume and the price they are perfect. If you are looking to wear them on a regular basis I would spend the money and get nice ones.
5.0,"This is a great cosplay for someone who is new to cosplay or if you want something light-weight for warm weather. It's very manageable, easy to take on and off, and can be worn as part of many different costumes if you're willing to get other headbands and rings. The robe is much sturdier than I expected! The stitches looks great and the patches are tight. The zipper doesn't snag and I can't find any damage to the robe. I ordered a size large and it is plenty wide but not super long and I'm only five foot. This cosplay comes with a headband and ring. The headband is a little small and the ring is a little big, but I can work with both luckily. This is a fun cosplay for anyone who likes Naruto!"
5.0,"Ordered by mistske, don't need teo, Thx"
5.0,I’ll buy this item again with different colors… used this for working out and hiking!:)) The cloth is so soft! It fits perfectly!:))
5.0,"This size was a little big on me, but it still works."
5.0,"Well made and comfortable. I bought both a large and an Large X for my husband, who usually wears a size medium sweater. I purposely bought them large because he wanted them to fit very loose and the XLG is big on him, but he likes it. I've washed them and there was no shrinkage of dye running. Nice sweatshirts and I would buy them again."
5.0,"I've bought a couple of these sweatshirts now, and I buy them for the thicker, lined hood. I live in a windy state where it can get quite cold. Fits and wears like a medium weight sweatshirt, but the hood is thicker than most."
5.0,Def. 5 star rating. Comfortable on a hot wedding day. I am a size 14 and the size large fit perfect!
5.0,Absolutely beautiful! I'm so in love with it! I ordered a 2x and I'm 200+ and 4'11. It fits great!!!
5.0,These were great during my pregnancy. I only gain 19 pounds and were still able to wear my regular jeans with these. Easy to use and came in multiple colors.
5.0,great item. looks nice.
5.0,I bought these as a gift and they were awesome. The Totoro was super soft on the sock!
5.0,Order a size down !
5.0,"Very nice youth T-shirt, soft material, reinforced modified V neck, longer than most T shirts and slightly longer in back, which we like.<br />The boy is an avid fan of the Patriots so this was a nice surprise for him.<br />Quality material in a well-made garment, finished seams and hems throughout, no raw edges to fray."
5.0,Love the poncho.  On the thinner side so don't be confused.
5.0,I absolutely love these compression socks!  They are very comfortable and make my legs feel so much better!  I have had several ankle problems and wearing these compression socks gives me the added support I need.  I highly recommend them!
5.0,This was amazing! Soft velvet quality and fit incredibly! This was a gorgeous product I would recommend for anyone!
5.0,"Imho, these are the best underwear a big guy can get. These are very comfortable, they dont bunch up or stay wet like cotton and other fabric blends. Best of all if your cheeks are hungry, they cant eat these so you're not picking them out all day."
5.0,Gift for my Mom...she wanted a pair like mine and they delivered in two days at Christmastime
5.0,A comfy dress you can wear to do your shopping or out to dinner.<br />Light and cool for the summer<br />Perfect
5.0,See my other review of these shoes...I have them in several colors.  Fabulous find!
5.0,I looooooved this dress. The only problem I had was that it was too long. So i had it cut above my knees and I think it looks much better. Otherwise it looks like an old lady :)
5.0,"This shirt is perfect. The purpose is to protect from the harmful rays of the sun, yet is is really cute and stylish. I am 5'2&#34;, 105 lbs and the size small fit perfectly. I have not used it yet, but I know I will be very satisfied. I like to spend time in the water, swimming, boating, paddling and boogie boarding and now I can stay in the sun without worrying about the obvious. I still have to use (toxic) sunscreen, but with this shirt and board shorts I don't have to apply nearly as much."
5.0,"These are really adorable purse charm/key chains! I love the variety of design & color - they are all so cute - I can't pick a favorite! I also got these on Amazon Prime Day & got a super deal, so extremely happy!"
5.0,"Color, fit and comfort - beautiful!"
5.0,These look great.
5.0,My daughter loves these so much she purchased another pair!
5.0,Bought this for my granddaughter.  She received it yesterday and was totally thrilled.  Made her day.
5.0,Nice adjustable fit and wide brim for sun protection.  Great product!  I have another one for my preschooler and we love it.  We got that one directly from Coolibar.  Amazon is CHEAPER with the free shipping.
5.0,"Very comfortable, and attractive looking.  I'll enjoy it next fall/winter.  It's already too warm for them in the desert southwest."
5.0,If only it had come true...
5.0,These are my go-to earrings for my second piercings to match any silver-toned jewelry. The 3mm is the perfect size for that. I wear them at least 3 times a week!
5.0,Not bad for the price and very comfortable.
5.0,"I received these on Friday and promptly wore them to a 12 hour trail event. At about mile 8, me and gravity had a disagreement (spoiler alert...gravity won) and I fell on a fire road which was mostly rocks and gravel on a downhill. I tore up both knees and my palms pretty good. I actually fell so hard it ripped through the KT tape and rolled the compression sleeve down a bit (I had road rash going down about a 1/4 of the way past my knee. These compression sleeves stayed with me the entire race. They were great, though at mile 35, my calves started to swell and I had to take them off when I finished at 40 miles. The blood stains and mud came out and with the exception of a snag and a small hole which I sewed shut, they held up beautifully. I wanted to order a 2nd and 3rd pair and a replacement to the ones that got a little trail wrecked and a larger sizes to compensate for next day swelling, but the prices went up which is a bit of a bummer, but they are totally worth it. Bonus photos and you can see how well the sleeves held up compared to my knees."
5.0,"Great quality, stick well, perfect little gem earrings."
5.0,Nice sandal. Good quality. Great price.
5.0,"I’m in love with the color, the feel, the pockets, and the overall fit of the dress!"
5.0,I love the way they fit. I got most colors and lots of compliments ❤
5.0,I work a late shift and driving home at night is much more enjoyable now that I'm not getting blinded by oncoming traffic.
5.0,"Much nicer than expected. Just based on the price and some other reviews I wasn't sure what to expect. I'm pleasantly surprised. Nice quality, no parts look cheap or plastic, the color is nicer than in the picture and goes with nearly everything. It fits my larger wrist perfectly while some of the other cheap bracelets I've bought are much too small."
5.0,It was a gift she loves it
5.0,Get gift
5.0,I love this dress! Great quality and very pretty! make every color available in every size please! I want more!
5.0,These can sooner than anticipated and separately packaged! They're also SUPER cute!!
5.0,These were great for the money.  Super light and looked nice!
5.0,Like these better than the darker set. I can read my phone with these on.
5.0,"Fits like a glove, very Comfortable"
5.0,It was exactly as pictured!
5.0,"This is beautiful, warm, lightweight, compact, and altogether amazing! I love this jacket."
5.0,"I got the interlocking circles necklace because I wear rose gold mostly but have some silver pieces. It's lovely, my daily necklace. Had a delicate but substantial presence."
5.0,"Super comfortable! Lightweight and loose fitting, still get your normal size."
5.0,"It looks good, not bulky , fits true to size"
5.0,Love the shirt but it’s not linen.
5.0,I sold these in my motorcycle shop for several years. We actually had fishermen come in to buy them. I still have a pair but sold the biz so nice to know where I can get them again. We sold dozens of these glasses for 34.95. This is a good deal. Global vision makes great glasses. Only drawback is that polarized sunglasses cause a rainbow effect when looking through a Harley windshield.<br />The reading lense is not dark which makes it easier to read menus in restaurants.
5.0,I felt so amazing wearing this!!! I went to a very formal Mermaid Ball and fit in perfectly!
5.0,Nice quality. Cute. Easy to clip
5.0,Lightweight and don't slide off my face when I sweat
5.0,I love these! ! Sooo comfy and look like jeans :) highly recommend
5.0,This is beautiful and the price was great! The &#34;scales&#34; are hearts that are connected or welded together. It's a really cute and solid piece of jewelry.  I will definitely wear this!
5.0,"I found the dress to be all I had expected I love the feel , the comfort, length, color, only one thing was wrong, alittle tight in the bust"
5.0,Great quality print for the price.
5.0,Perfect for prep room when embalming.
5.0,I plan to use it when I travel. I don’t think it will hold all the extra items it has pictured. The pockets are small and could hold a few things but I bought it to use for the drink holder benefit with my carry on.
5.0,I am a 144 pounds and I'm 5'3 and a medium made me feel confront not to hold my gut in😭🤣 I feel real pretty in these dresses so I wanna buy them allll
5.0,"I don’t know,I buy fora gift"
5.0,Very comfy. Breathable so I am able to wear even on hot days!
5.0,I chose a large size just in case and it fits perfect. Glad I made the right choice. I was looking for a plain black night gown and found it! Love the length. Works well with my height as I’m 5’7 for reference
5.0,Great product... Clothes doesn't get wet as well... I strongly recommend to buy the product...
5.0,"Have not used the gloves to test durability or water resistance, but the gloves are very comfortable and a great price."
5.0,Muy buena calidad de tela y las costuras. Muy conforme y contento con el regalo a mi hijo.
5.0,this is best out of three BOLISI watches I bought
5.0,nice one i am M size and it fits perfect
5.0,"I've been looking for a lightweight storage box to place on my pontoon boat for fishing on the river, and this is perfect.  I did some modifications so that it fits my needs a bit better, such as adding two buckles on the sides to strap it onto the boat, and a rod holder.  This is great since I can use it as additional storage and a cooler, and it adds negligible weight - I can't believe how light it really is and still be tough."
5.0,Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend before he goes on a ski trip and he loved it! It's really soft and doesn't feel flimsy.
5.0,Yet to give to my wife.  I peeked at it and it looks gorgeous!  Came with 2 chains.<br />Will update after Valentine's Day!
5.0,Darling!!!!
5.0,Have worn around the house and shopping. Very comfortable and flattering. Have worn  to Doctor appointment. The material stretches with ease and washes and dries without wrinkles. Purchased the same suit in black and white .
5.0,Excellent fit and material! It was perfect for my performance that week and I got tons of compliments.
5.0,Love these booties!!!  They go with everything!!!  Dress 'em up or down!!
5.0,I bought these for my 7 year old son.  I did go a size up than his usual size and they barely fit so they do run on the smaller side.  But they will work for the summer.  And you can't beat the price!!
5.0,Beautiful ring as pictured.
5.0,"I love this hoodie~! It fit perfectly! For reference I am 5'6&#34; 140, 32DD and the hoodie fit me like the model (oddly enough). Fast shipment and well packaged. This is worth the money with how warm and pretty it keeps you~!"
5.0,This arrived yesterday and fits great.  I love that I didn't have to worry about getting an incorrect size.  This is perfect for our cruise this summer since I do not want to risk losing my wedding bands. It is very comfortable too!
5.0,Perfect light weight summer crossbody!  Love it!
5.0,"Comfortable and stylish, this hansa choker is exactly what I needed to complement a night outfit or even to wesr to synagogue. Love the Middle-Eastern flair combined with the elegant black velvet."
5.0,"These are heavy, which is good. But I wasn't prepared for it. They really sparkle, I love the cute swirly design. They arrived with a few extra jewstones on a baggie for replacement, that was nice, and it all came In a nice box and bag for them. Sadly in my wedding photos you can hardly see them, which was upsetting but I know I was killing it so its okay:) 5 stars because they aren't tacky, or fake looking and they sparkle like no ones business:)"
5.0,"Purchased this as a gift for my 10 year old granddaughter who loves it.  I worried that the it would be too big for her, but it worked just fine for her.  I'm 5'3&#34; and tried it on as well just to see how the fit would be for an adult and again, no problem.  The fur is soft and there were no loose seams so overall I was very happy with my purchase"
5.0,It arrived on time and is as described.  It’s light weight material and comfortable.
5.0,Fit was great. Kept me warm and comfortable out side in the freezing weather.
5.0,"These are very small, perfectly made earrings that I love to wear. The stones are bright in color and the earrings are well made."
5.0,Love the color. The Blue on black looks really cool.
5.0,"I am 5'11 and 145, I could have easily gotten a small but I have broad shoulders and went with a medium. I love!!!! The material is not thin but light, so very breathable. I ordered this for senior pictures/graduation and am so excited!!!! it is so flattering and 10000000x worth the price."
5.0,This is a beautiful pendulum. I love it!!
5.0,"These earrings are super cute, great quality and make quick easy gifts/ giveaways! Perfect price $❤️"

5.0,My favorite riding glove.  Helps with arthritis in my fingers.  Highly recommend
5.0,"As an older lady, this bra is phenomenal.  It is comfortable and has a nice shape under every day clothes. I'm 112 lbs, 5'5"", a 34 C, and the Large is perfect. I ordered a red bra and a pink. I will order again."
5.0,Jeujd hi riudjjejdodjejje
5.0,"They're a little hard to break in at first, just like any pair of docs, but once they're broken in they are the comfiest shoes!!!"
5.0,Great quality fit nicely fast shipping arrive way earlier then planned ..
5.0,Using the product for jewelry making projects. Very good quality for the money.
5.0,"This item shipped quickly, considering it came from China (which I didn't know when I purchased.) I was skeptical when we received it, but it seems to be very high quality and has beautiful colors! My husband loves it!"
5.0,These are perfect go with anything type earrings
5.0,"This bracelet is super cute and lightweight.  It arrived in a cute little black bag like shown.  I thought that this bracelet by Kanti Design was so unique from other designers, yet simple.  It paired perfectly with my fit-bit on my left wrist.  The lava stones are rare as others do not have or make them.  The Buddha charm was very intrinsic, yet channels peaceful thoughts when I look at it.  It's simple, unique and charming or any one who loves yoga, spiritual or calming tangible goods.  I received this item at a discount for a honest and unbiased review. This review is honest and my own and based on the product itself."
5.0,my second set from this sellar!!!! I have very very VERY sensitive nips  even after a year of them being pierced. this sellar is the only person I trust for rings outside of the tattoo shops! they rings are beautiful an fit me perfect!!! thank you again!!!
5.0,Perfecto muy buena calidad de echo voy a comprar otro para un regalo lo único que les recomiendo es que si pudieran hacerla mitad cubana mitad americana fuera ideal Gracias

5.0,Loved these!! Super cute and comfy!
5.0,Bought for my husband for Christmas and he just loves it! Really beautiful and a nice size. He gets lots of compliments. I appreciated the nice packaging for gift giving.
5.0,Great product. Exactly what I expected. Outstanding customer support. The elasticity of those sleeves is just right.
5.0,I was able to make great zombie skin with this. It dried and settled on the skin well enough for me to rip into it and it was sturdy afterwards for me to apply blood &#34;inside&#34; the rip. Love this!
5.0,I love these bands with all the holes air gets to your arm and its not so hot. Very comfortable also.
5.0,These are super soft and lightweight. I got these for my husband bc he works out in the sun and he lives them.
5.0,The skirt fabric is light weight and perfect for the summer heat where I live.  I am very happy with the purchase!
5.0,"Fits great, not big into long sleeves but really liked this one"
5.0,si llegaron
5.0,Very nice looking.  Nice weight feels like quality.  Glad I purchased this.
5.0,"i was very pleased with this hat, it fits and looks as expected. color is as shown. my daughter loves it"

5.0,Workout and yoga approved! They are slimming and feel very nice
5.0,Beautiful charm fits pandora bracelets
5.0,great cloths
5.0,"After washing they need to be pulled a bit  to shape; now I order a larger size for everybody.  I have the large, and I wear a 9.5N shoe. Brother in law who wears a 12 is too big - my husband who wears a 10.5 has a few pair.<br /><br />We've bought them for about 30 friends and family and everybody loves them. I thought they were mismatched in VT, but this year's crop lists NC."
5.0,I've carried this back every day for 4 years now. LOVE IT STILL! I went with brown leather so it works with every outfit. The leather started out soft and has gotten softer over the years. There are some slight wrinkles from leaning it again my desk daily. Otherwise it's in perfect condition! I think it wore in nicely. Would purchase again in a heartbeat.
5.0,We just got this today. I wss nervous about the fit but it worked very well. My daughter is usually a large but we bought an xl. The fit is nice not too tight. For the price this dress is amazing. She wanted it for her military ball. I was very surprised his elegant it looked considering the low price. Made of very stretchy material. If you want it tight and form fitting buy your size. For a little extra room buy a size up.
5.0,"As others stated, almost no outgassing smell with the organic mask. Kinda hard to breathe through. Maybe I will get the one with the valve next."
5.0,The band arrived fast and included everything needed to install. Install only took about 5 minutes. Highly recommend to anyone looking to seriously class up their Casi-oak! 10/10
5.0,"Just gave this lovely piece, along with another piece from the same seller, to my lovely wife. It was the perfect &#34;just because&#34; gift. She loved it! Despite the affordable price, the necklace is of good quality. It looks nice and feels nice to hold. I look forward to seeing it around my love's neck for many years to come."
5.0,"Great little dress, good comfy material, stretchy for. Will be buying more!"
5.0,"So soft, has many compartments (which I love) and the color is so unusually pretty. My favorite bag."
5.0,It works to keep my knees warm.
5.0,Beautiful! Fits perfectly
5.0,This scrub cap is a very good choice. Thank you
5.0,Beautiful and as ordered. The colors are beautiful and the chain has a very antique feel and look.
5.0,Finally a long enough cover-up with sleeves! I had a hard time finding a cover up for my daughters with long legs. All the ones I had seen are short! But this was perfect. Love the long sleeves and hoodie (just wish it had pockets but that’s ok). And the material is like a towel but very soft. I got the small and medium for my 3yr and 4yr old. Bought these for my kids to use on a beach camping trip where we were going to be at the beach all day so it helped keep them warm when it would get cool in the afternoon. Received lots of compliments on it.
5.0,Very nice cross pendant and adjustable leather neckleace.
5.0,"I'll start with the negative. I ordered a Large based on the size chart, as I normally wear a 36"" or 38"". However, when i received my first pair they where clearly too small. But hey, that's online shopping and what free shipping and returns are for. I went up one size and they fit great.<br /><br />Material: very light weight and quick drying. I suspect they are made of the same ""quick dry"" material that a lot of fishing shorts and shirts are made of.<br /><br />Fit: As mentioned above, I had to go up one size. The inseam is a true 7"" which is a little shorter than average, but I knew this when ordering.<br /><br />Overall: nice light weight shorts for casual wear. Fishing style apparel without all the unneeded pockets. Looks good enough to wear with a t-shirt or a button down."
5.0,"This ring is beautiful and dainty. Even though it’s fairly thick, it’s so light and doesn’t feel heavy. I’m slightly concerned by its delicacy and getting it caught on things, but as long as you’re mindful while wearing it it’s not a problem. Such a classic look and the perfect addition to a stack. Just love it!"
5.0,"I’m always skeptical with ordering clothes without being able to try them on. But, after reading the reviews and deciding to give it a shot, I ordered this dress. Let me tell you, I am in love! The material is thick and stretchy; great quality. It zips in the back and the ruching falls nicely right over that “tummy pooch” area. It’s slimming and very flattering. For under $30, it’s a steal! For reference, I am 5’2, 130lbs, 34C, with a more curvy/muscular build and the small fits like a glove, almost “sucking” you in, in a way; but VERY comfortable."
5.0,Good size for adult male. Sturdier than I expected for low cost.
5.0,These were absolutely perfect!
5.0,Just like shown
5.0,"I ordered this Land’s End tee shirt, thinking it was just another striped tee.  To my surprise, the neckline sports a “fuchsia” stipe, in contrast to the blue and white striped shirt!  So unusual and cute!  I love it!  (The shirt fits as described.)"
5.0,"I've been really tired of having my glasses fall off because the lariat broke or the little rubber holder snapped, so I'm trying out these straps.<br />So far, so good and the company offers a lifetime warranty so who could go wrong? The pricing is more than fair for what I think is a quality product."
5.0,"This cropped sweater has become one of my most favorite garments in my wardrobe! I wish I had it in every color. It is made well, the fabric is nice and comfortable, and it fits true to size. It looks great with my jeans and leggings. I have already worn it and washed it a bunch, and the fabric has stayed intact and not frayed. I definitely recommend getting this sweater!"
5.0,"Great product, the oversized tags have a sturdy metal clasp, the straps are durable to wrap my luggage. When combined on my common looking black suitcase I can spot mine a mile away!<br /><br />Only draw back, one time coming from Seattle someone had the same strap/tag in the same color, must have bought the same one 😂"
5.0,Warm. Comfortable.
5.0,Love it! Love the color and it is packable!!!
5.0,"Product works as hoped.  Process is simple:  clean, dry, spray, wait and wipe.  Took all of a minute.  Still good after a few days.  If I have to reapply every few days that’s fine by me."
5.0,Really nice bracelet will purchase more I'm now looking for a necklace to match!
5.0,great bras.
5.0,"I totally did not expect these sandals to be so comfortable!. I've had them for almost a mth, but just wore them a cpl days ago. Super cushiony! Definitely recommend.  Oh, and they look good too, lol"
5.0,These look really neat on a charm bracelet
5.0,More storage.
5.0,Fit good. Just a little thin. Like a thick shirt but fits is purpose.
5.0,Arrived as promised. Good price.
5.0,Wow!  What a nice weight fabric and perfect fit!  It’s so classy looking and I can’t wait to wear it!
5.0,I love my hat and wear it to all my pickle ball league nights. I like that the letters are embroidered and the hat is comfortable and cute. The quality is great! Will recommend to all my pickleball playing friends.
5.0,"absolutely beautiful, will be one of my favorite scarves now. great, true color<br />better than hoping. Thank you so much"
5.0,Fantastic quality and they fit exactly like I had hoped. My son is tall and thin and these fit him perfectly. He wrote them to a wedding and had them in for hours with no complaints and he looked so great in them.
5.0,Vibrate color and easy to style. Pattern is a bit more pronounced in person.
5.0,Comfortable and lite! Love em!
5.0,Cute bold colors
5.0,"+Worth the wait (a month) since it was shipped from China and and money (was 10 bucks when I bought it).<br />+RGB LED + different light modes.<br />+Looks really good and makes you stand out in the dark.<br />+Came in one piece and with batteries.<br />+Clear acrylic, no scratches.  Guess I’m lucky.<br /><br />-Came in a messed up box. Very understandable because it was shipped over a long distance and period.<br />-Sharp edges make it kinda painful (ears and nose) when wearing over a long period of time.<br />-Very close to my eyes (touches my eyelashes), which makes it kind of uncomfortable when i blink and especially to those who have long eyelashes.<br /><br />**Overall: great toy!"
5.0,"Everything about this jersey is wonderful -except the C logo on the back. Brand new it feels like those cheap iron-ons that never last. Since the rest of the jersey is well-made, I'm going to invest in an embroidered patch and sew it on when it cracks or comes away from the fabric. 99% sure it's going to do just that.  Even so, still very happy with it!!<br /><br />Bought a large for our Welsh Terrier because all jerseys/sweaters are always tight around his front legs. This works great!"
5.0,It’s all especially nice for the price.
5.0,"Arrived promptly, very bright and fun, just what I was looking for!"
5.0,Fits my chip and helps me keep a constant reminder of where my head should be.
5.0,This a good product. It fits perfectly and it’s great quality.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:a8fd6bfbd5e4e40071a4c0252414f87]]
5.0,My grand-daughter loved it.  This was exactly what she had hoped for.

5.0,Very pretty nd flattering
5.0,All around go to store or gym fit is great

5.0,"Neleus did it again. Great fit,<br />nice material, good selection on colors and a great price. Have not ever been disappointed with Neleus products."
5.0,They’re perfect! Wear them all the time! And I just bought some for my dad on his birthday nd love it.
5.0,These are very comfortable I would recommend them to anyone
5.0,This dress is super cute! Fits well and I love the color
5.0,"Love these pjs! The size is accurate to me, ordered a large. The print is very shiny but not cheaply made. Feels soft and durable. Love for any game of thrones fan"
5.0,Fits as shown on the model.
5.0,Absolutely stunning. The stones sparkle like diamonds. Beautifully made. A real couture piece!
5.0,I am petite in length so this dress is too long.
5.0,Great for keeping my hands cool while working in the summer sun. The only thing I dont like is not being able to touch my phone screen with them on. The black atlas nitrite gloves do but get really hot.
5.0,It’s so pretty!  Picture doesn’t do it justice. The stones are really shiny and pink. Pictures I took make it look a bit dull. It’s not!  I’m so very pleased.

5.0,"Thick quality material, very soft to the skin, there's a type of fleece like material on this inside..great for cold weather. This dress does stretch, but it is similar to compression type of clothing or like shape wear type of stretch. It accents all your curves but holds in all your extra rolls. You will definitely be bringing sexy back in this dress. I ordered according to the sizing chart and it fits perfectly! I will be ordering this dress in every color available in my size."
5.0,I purchased one of these when traveling in Europe….was delighted to see I could purchase by way of Amazon. Easy to pack and put on over bulky clothes in a flash when raining. Bought 4 more for gifts. Have had the original one for 10+ yrs

5.0,I broke them pretty quick. But I liked them in the meantime.<br />Co worker did say I looked like a heroin guy whatever that means
5.0,"This is amazing looks great, just need to up your size"
5.0,"Best $15 spent ever! Everyone loved it! I'm 4'11, 135lbs and I got a size small! Material was super stretchy although a little thin I had to put a black skirt underneath to hide panty lines! Cant wait to order from this vendor again! Ordered in white bc prev reviews said came more silver which was what I was going for!"
5.0,rules
5.0,"I’ll be testing these out in the snow in a few weeks but so far this set is great! For reference I’m 5’5” 149/150lbs and my measurements are bust-35” waist-33” largest part of hip-43”. I ordered the medium. Going by their size chart I picked what I thought would fit my bust. The bottoms are only a tiny bit snug at my waist but not uncomfortable. There is great airflow when moving around so they seem like they’ll be a great base layers for keeping you warm under a coat but cooling you down when the coat is unzipped. I also specifically got these because they have a wide waistband like my workout leggings.<br /><br />3/6/21 update, washed inside out no pilling. They did great on my trip ended up wearing the shirt, bottoms and shell ski pants in the 54*F weather, kept me warm and dry."
5.0,Great pant with cute style. Love the color
5.0,Wore with a hat that had peacock feathers on the top to a wedding and everybody went nuts
5.0,I am 5’4” and about 115 lbs. I used double sided sticky tape to help prevent gapping around the side boobs. Had to order some 4” heels to prevent the dress from dragging cause I didn’t trust my sewing last minute.
5.0,This dress is true to size I am a size 18-20<br />But a 2X it was perfect- Every time I wear this dress I get complements..
5.0,Worked great. They fit my lips perfectly and I haven’t had a problem with the balls coming off either
5.0,they matched my coat and they have a lining which I was worrying about but as always Amazon came through. I would purchase these gloves again. They served their purpose nice and warm for a 35 degree day. I love the color they look beautiful on me.
5.0,"These chains arrived in a nicely packaged box. Once I opened that, there was an sectioned case inside. Great packaging! I do love the variety of chain colors."
5.0,They are the best thing I’ve purchased in months
5.0,"Perfect fit, lightweight, breezy, and comfortable!<br />Perfect for my winter escape to Puerto Vallarta"

5.0,"Adorable, light weight, and come in all the colors."
5.0,I walk before the sun is up and found a headlamp blinding and a flashlight cumbersome.  This waist light is just right.  It give plenty of light and fits easily wround my waist.
5.0,"This apron is proportioned well for smaller, shorter, slimmer people. The length is not long, and the waist ties are pretty short. I like the styling, and the waterproof fabric prevents the wearer from getting wet from splashes, etc. I wash mine in the washing machine (cold water) and then hang it up to dry (do not put it in the dryer!). It stays very clean this way."
5.0,Great granddaughter loves these shoes!
5.0,Very good fit. I love this shoes.
5.0,Perfect for my husband who was a dealer at casino night for the after prom.
5.0,We bought this for my mom for Valentine's day! It is so shiny and lovely. About an inch in length and comes on a very nice sturdy chain. The name is spelled out very visibly. We selected the silver tone. Very pleased.
5.0,"It's amazing how much oil, dirt, and grit the inner cloth cleans off jewelry. The outer cloth does a pretty good job buffing out some small scratches. Put some elbow grease in it and you'll have very noticeable results. I cleaned my white gold and diamond engagement ring and an old platinum-mix class ring. The class ring is almost 8 years old but now looks new again."
5.0,"GREAT dress, daughter loved it, good quality and cute."
5.0,My step daughter loved this necklace. It’s super cute. She hasn’t worn it yet because it’s “so special” to her. She is 10 and I put this in her box to ask her to be my maid of honor! She plans to wear it the wedding day. So sweet.
5.0,They are a little tight on my 4 month olds thighs but they are really cute
5.0,These are gorgeous! They're light weight and yet substantial enough to provide coverage.. I use them as head ties as well.  My sister loved them on me so much that she just ordered her own

5.0,Love love love this shirt! Extremely flattering while loose enough in the tummy area. Purchased the yellow floral. Will purchase in other colors.
5.0,Super soft. Well made (material isn't paper thin). Has a zipper on back side that's hidden. Pockets are sturdy. My daughter LOVES this costume.
5.0,"Buy a size up and you can wear big wool socks, but still easily slip these on and off.  Great construction, very weatherproof and warm."
5.0,"It's a nice keyring, holds up well so far on my car keys.  Looks good and seems durable enough."
5.0,My current favorite pair of earrings! I get complimented on them all the time!

5.0,My 9 year old niece absolutely love it!
5.0,Great Value. It was a hit.
5.0,"Love them!  They are as cute & delicate as I thought they would be.  I receive many complements every time I wear them.  They also don't swing down to hang from the ears, as I was afraid they would; they stay snugly up against your ear. My only caution is if you have multiple lobe piercings. They may interfere with them, especially in the back."
5.0,love love love this purse...lots of room and there is no way anyone can tell it is a conceal...did I say I love it!!!!!!
5.0,"I work in a grocery store in the coolers and needed something that would keep me warm but still thin. This keeps me very warm, is very comfortable, and is great quality. I’m 5 foot 3 inches 170 pounds, measurements 38-30-40 and the medium fit perfect, I like the long length."
5.0,Love this hat! Very well made. Quality fabric and construction. The adjustable Velcro strap is very strong and stays put. I am especially fond of the deeper cap and long bill..
5.0,"Looks good, feels good. Good buy."
5.0,"Bought these for my sister who does not like hanging or large earrings. She loves them. Unique look was perfect for her minimalist, sophisticated style."
5.0,If you're a fan of Tokyo ghoul then you'll love this face mask. Unless you're a maga supporter... Then you probably don't wear a mask so I wouldn't bother.
5.0,Absolutely loved the dress; will wear it every chance I get. Went to some friends 50th wedding anniversary party. Was a perfect hit! The only issue I had was the fact that I had three pairs of shoes that matched the dress and found it difficult to choose a pair. I finally did though!
5.0,works great. I want another one
5.0,my kid loves these.
5.0,my dad like them
5.0,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM!!!!!!!!!

5.0,I love this brooch. She’s giving classy and will make any simple look sooooo much better
5.0,"good product, what u see is what u get"
5.0,Ordered as a gift.  My son loves it.
5.0,They are gorgeous.  They shimmer beautifully.  They bend easily due to the amount of gold and they don't come with any back to prevent them from falling out. Still well worth the money.
5.0,"Love, love, love. This dress is beautiful and fits great. I’m 5’7” and 180lbs I ordered the sz12. I can’t say anything negative about this dress. It’s classy looking and pretty. I ordered this for my nieces confirmation I’m her sponsor. But since I received it early enough I’m thinking I’m going to wear it on Easter Sunday to church too. Definitely recommend this dress."
5.0,came fast and good quality
5.0,Cute charms from pretty silver. Only drawback is to many repeats. Should be a little more variety not 6 of one cat image.  Otherwise good!
5.0,"I love this ring so much. It's sparkly, looks much better than the price and stays at the size you put it at. As soon as I wore mine a couple times I got one for my daughter who loves it and that's saying something. I might order another just in case something happens to mine and I am not the kind of person that does stuff like that. If you're reading this, stop reading and buy it now"
5.0,"Super cute and adorable, extremely flattering!!!! Order one size up , it'll look much better on , not as tight.."
5.0,"Great gift, look good."
5.0,Great fashion shoes. Not for any sport activity. Ok for walking. I mostly wear it to run day errands.
5.0,Got this for my daughter and she loved it.  Chiffon and lace....very dainty!  Good product.
5.0,These goggles are great! They fit my face without squishing my nose.
5.0,"Got this as a gift for my sister in law who loves pirates! It looks a lot like the one from the movies, love it so much that I am going to order one for myself!"
5.0,"Just love this top, I paired it with Adidas women leggings.  My husband loves the look. Great for times when you want to be casual but do not want a regular tshirt."
5.0,"Nothing bad about it, light weight, value for money."
5.0,I love it. Its beautiful.
5.0,Love the added inches on the backside.
5.0,Arrived in 2 days in perfect condition. I like the non slip coating of the box. Seems sturdy and the light is bright and shines were it should. So far so good.
5.0,It is very oversized but I love it. I would order a size down so you don't lose your shape when you put this on.
5.0,I removed the old nose pads then cleaned the contact points on the frame with the tip of a steak knife. Attached the nose pads with exterior grade contact cement I had laying around in my shop. Worked fine. Now I remember why I loved these sunglasses in the first place.
5.0,This is a beautiful St. Christopher pendant.  I had been searching for a while and this one was a perfect choice.
5.0,"I love these tons and got it in 3 colors Black, white and orange.  They look cute with jeans or stretch pants. I pair mine with a cute denim or flannel over shirt now, but will be wearing them through the summer. They are loose so I got an XL to accommodate my bust, but could have gotten away with a Large. I wear a Large normally except in some shirts due to my bust size.  They look fabulous anyways and i'm planning on buying them again in a smaller size in the future."
5.0,"As advertised, they do change color in the sun! Perfect sunglasses if you're into that kind of thing and a poor student like me"
5.0,Absolutely beautiful and will be exchanging it for a medium. They now have a new customer.
5.0,Very nice. Pearl are somewhat small. Would be excellent for a young lady
5.0,Super cute. We bought too big so he’ll grow into them
5.0,Let me just say this I’m very curvy and plus size I’m 5”10over 250pds and I love this outfit
5.0,"This is an awesome sweater! I ordered the Bordeaux color in small (I'm 5'2) ..Fits great.. It's nice and thick, but doesn't make you look heavier.. And it's a beautiful pattern. I think I need another color!"
5.0,Application was very easy and the smell is great. My leather purse looks brand new again!
5.0,"These v-necked tees are very silky smooth. They’re 95% cotton, but the 5% spandex seems to make a big difference in the feel of the cloth. These are nicely made a great weight for warmer days or wearing under sweaters, etc. These are a little shorter than I’d like them to be, but wide enough around to fit loosely, which is good unless you have a really skinny kiddo. The sleeves are nice and long, and overall the fit is decent. I just wish these were about 2 inches longer, but they’ll work as is, so I can’t really complain about the style, even though I just did, LOL. Overall, these are silky, comfy tees that seem as if they will hold up for a good while. Very pleased with the texture and feel of these tees.<br /><br />Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

5.0,The nicest shirt out of 11 shirts that I bought even though they are all really nice!!!
5.0,This shirt is really nice!<br />I got this for my office wear and I will buy more colors for casual occasions.<br />It matches well with all of my jeans and skirts.<br />I am very satisfied the quality of the fabric.<br />Overall this is better than I expected!
5.0,"Game changer!!! I have always liked dressing up but always hated having my shirt untuck exposing all the extra fabric. This changed that all, now I can always feel a slight pull on my shirt, but it pulls down not out meaning it will always stay tucked. You will feel them as you walk, but they are not uncomfortable, and feeling the constant pull on your shirt gives you a feeling of confidence. This is particularly useful if you have an important event where you must look sharp such as court, or funerals ( especially for pallbearers). The clips on the ends secure very well and has not yet damaged my shirt or socks. Also forgot to mention that this keeps your socks up which is awesome."
5.0,I love it.  It's an added attraction to any dress.<br />Dottie
5.0,Great for sensitive ears. Look like the real thing.
5.0,Cool socks!
5.0,Beautiful for my vacation to Jamaica and beach days!! Wish there was more room to add more to the inside but my phone wallet and keys were a perfect fit and that’s what I was searching for!!
5.0,I received as a warm gift from a warm soul. Anyway it is quite snug in the bicep region but that’s not a design casualty I have developed biceps.
5.0,This is my favorite ted hose.  I am not sure if this company went out of business but I am having more trouble finding them.  Love the design and fit
5.0,"Perfect purse for holding your cell, keys, gloss, and sunglasses. The strap was a little short for me so found a longer one elsewhere, which made this even more perfect."
5.0,"My daughter loves this soft and cute ""pajama dress"" as she calls it. Fits true to size. I like the long sleeves for the winter."
5.0,Fit my wife great. She loves the shirt. We already orders another color.
5.0,I buy these until they wear out or get lost--always love them! Best watches for the money!
5.0,Love it!! So comfy and received many compliments.
5.0,I just got my leggings. They fit very well and will work nicely for my needs. I am quite pleased with the quality of construction and fabric. The yoga waist is comfortable and doesn't roll down at all. They snug in your problem spots beautifully. I would definitely purchase this product again.
5.0,"This ring is beautiful!  It is a Celtic knot in a contemporary design.  Well done and true to size. I liked it so much that I ordered rings for my two nieces.  I have purchased from Gem Avenue in the past, and they continue to provide excellent jewelry in a cute gift package and speedy delivery."
5.0,Great price for this product !! Fits amazing . So happy with this purchase
5.0,What more could you want skulls and American flags. To me the skulls could look a little tougher they look a little bit goofy-ish but not in a way where it's going to make you look like a dweeb. Plus also having the American flag to counteract it if let's say you are in a different setting that's not so appropriate to have a skull on your face. I would still be wearing it if I didn't lose it somewhere.
5.0,I liked that they got my kiddo long legs and little Waist
5.0,"These are nice quality for the money!  I used them to make a necklace for a Christmas gift, and am very satisfied with the purchase."
5.0,Gift for grandson....he loved it!!!
5.0,"Lightweight, pretty, unpretentious, comfortable"
5.0,Fits a bit big but love it
5.0,so many complements!
5.0,"This is a nice leopard print blouse that fits true to size. The medium has a 38” bust and 26.5” length. It is 100% lightweight flowy rayon. It is cut in a way that is flattering and forgiving. The brand is “Sonja Betro” which is Amazons newer women’s clothing brand. So far, I have found this brand to run true to size and be a good quality."
5.0,I love wearing these with leggings or skinny jeans in the colder weather! And they are beautiful.
5.0,I have ordered these twice because they are so good.  Versatile with accommodating to anyone that needs reading glasses.  I keep them all over the house and one in my purse!
5.0,Hubby likes them looks great on him. Bought the size he was large fit perfect.
5.0,"I liked the look ,the full and the color."
5.0,Very beautiful pin and I wear it proudly
5.0,"This sweatshirt is a great little essential sweatshirt. I’m 5”6’ 160 with DDs and I did feel like it’s a liiiittle big, but I’m sure once it shrinks it’ll be perfect (just took it out of package pretty much in this photo which is why it’s wrinkly). Very happy with it but I will say that this is supposed to be the Gray one... and as you can see contrasted with my gray leggings, this is NOT gray. It’s like a light sage green-gray almost. In real life it looks nothing like the color pictured in all the pictures here, but it’s a beautiful color and I actually like it better than if it were gray-gray. Very happy with this sweatshirt!"
5.0,Wonderful fit! Love the design. Only wish it had pockets but that’s my own preference.
5.0,"I'm about 5'6"" and 112 lbs.  I usually always order XS and did so with these capris.  They look tiny and have a well tapered waistband.  I have a small waist and a flat stomach, they fit absolutely perfect. Rather snug, yes, but I love that compression feeling and after a few hours of wearing them they give a little.  If you want a less tight pant you should probably size up.  Muffin top may occur if you carry a few extra lbs around your midsection, they're not high waisted."
5.0,"I bought two of these for my husband and I, and I must say that they spectacular. They come very well packaged, and most of all they are of a perfect fit. My husband loves them."
5.0,Size chart In the pics are accurate and the pink is like a salmon pink. Really pretty comfy top
5.0,I have purchased these products for years and am always satisfied with quality of fabric and comfort.
5.0,These were so pretty that I had to buy another pair to send to my sister.  She loves them too!  Really nice quality at a very reasonable price.
5.0,This was a gift for my son and he said it is one of his favorite jackets. Very warm and soft.
5.0,"Just comfy, really like it."
5.0,Using this on binoculars...especially when little hands are holding them! The strap is comfortable and strong; does everything I want it to do.
5.0,This product was just perfect for all my bike related lock/keys.
5.0,Classy and elegant. Im overjoyed with them. Service was super-speedy. Thank you.
5.0,"Very nice quality for price, I was not expecting that."
5.0,"This is such a lovely pendant! Bought it as gift. Love the craftsman look to this. Not mass produced.  Very pleased, quickly delivered!"
5.0,Use it all the time.  Very comfortable.
5.0,"For all the more money I paid for this necklace, it is a steal.It is sturdy and so sparkly.It is great with a pendant or alone.I would recommend it to anyone who loves sterling as much as I do."
5.0,Very nice cut and color. The material is heavy enough for winter and fall. The charcoal color is deep.
5.0,"Anything to do with The BBTheory, is a-ok with me. Marvelous color and fit."
5.0,Item exactly as described. Excellent quality.  Recommend this seller.
5.0,"I was looking for some new watch bands to give a couple of my dressy watches a more casual look.  I ordered several different ones but this is my absolute favorite.  Perfect color, perfect feel, and the leather is extremely supple and looks as though it will wear well over time.  I waited a couple of weeks before writing this review to make sure my opinion would stay the same, and I have to say, the more you wear it, the better looking it gets!  If you're looking for a nice quality, casual leather strap then look no further.  I loved it so much, I ordered it in black for a different watch."
5.0,Perfect for any panda lover!!!
5.0,Nice hat thank you
5.0,"I really love the red & pink cherry charms, they feel heavy so it gives it a more luxurious feel to it and are true to color ! I can't wait to start selling these earrings (the leverback that i used to connect is bought separately & got from another vendor),, definitely would purchase again :)"
5.0,Very stylish and good quality.
5.0,Got becouse to going to custom i am doing its going to be fun being a midevil elf thank you
5.0,"It is pretty small which is nice, the color of the metal is a little lighter than in the picture which looks amazing. I was pleasantly surprised. I am really happy with my purchase of this medal."
5.0,This bathing suit arrived quickly.  I purchased it for a vacation to the shore.  I am a more mature woman and this is a flattering bathing suit.  The top covers nicely  and the bottoms cover nicely as well.  The pads in the top are a nice plus.  I loved that there are so many colors/prints to choose from.
5.0,My son wears this everywhere.  Very nice quality!
5.0,High quality fabric and doesn't stretch out.
5.0,I really like this shirt. It is light weight without being see through. I like how it is a little longer and more flowy so I don’t feel like I have to readjust it every time I lift my arms up.
5.0,I bought several shirts this day and all of them fit great. I really love the colors in this shirt.
5.0,"So refering to my title, this legging is great for a night out with a short top or dress. I was worried it was high waisted like other similar leggings on Amazon but it sat below my belly button. I wore it to a club, worrying I might get too hot or it would scrunch up since I'm fairly short -5'2""- but I had no issues with it whatsoever. I got complements on it (it looks expensive) and my boyfriend loves how my butt looks in it! Great investment. Glad I bought this."
5.0,It’s nice to out a new pair of gloves in each coat at the beginning of the winter season.<br />Cheap enough to loose and not care.
5.0,I just love it and had tried to find one in the stores with no luck so I'm thrilled
5.0,"This is a must have in many colors! Perfect casual dress that can be worn with boots and also dressed up with a scarf to wear to dinner. Love the fit, comfort and style."
5.0,It fits perfect. And it’s comfortable. Can’t wait to start working out in it!!
5.0,The jersey fit perfect for the size and was of good quality.  It arrived a day early which was even better!!!
5.0,Band is nice and small so that it stays on small wrists securely.  It was exactly what I was loking for.  Watch even came with an extra battery!
5.0,"38” bust and I got a small, with a white sports bra under it it’s not see through, good for the price and it was really stretchy, I wanted a super form fitting look and that’s what I got!"
5.0,"LOVE THIS TOP!! It is super comfy and fits beautifully. I am a plus size girl (5'4, 225lb) and I often run into problems with tops being too clingy and unflattering but this shirt is perfect. It is probably going to be one of my staples now as I am ready to order several more of them in all of the different colors! lol I would definitely recommend. And I am very picky about tops so that says a lot. =)"
5.0,"Great bag, and I love the length of the crossbody strap!"
5.0,My wife really liked the pendant. The chain length was excellent!

5.0,Love them and so does my little girl
5.0,"Super light weight, fits well with a nice silhouette and does an amazing job as a wind breaker.  I live in the south so we don't need heavy jackets but we do still need to be warm and this is a great, low cost option that you can roll up and store in your glove box as your extra ""car coat"".  I would purchase this again."
5.0,Great for teaching swimming to young students!
5.0,Got this bralette specifically to wear under my long sleeve mesh top! The bralette is suuuuuper cute and I LOVE that the pads are removable. I want to get these in other colors now!!
5.0,Nice floating charms bracelet.
5.0,"This is a nice set! It is good quality, and my daughter loves that it completed her Princess Jasmine costume perfectly."
5.0,Bought them for my husband who says they look and feel like far more expensive glasses.  Plus he looks good in them. Bye bye dollar store
5.0,I bought this as a Father’s Day present and he was thrilled!
5.0,Muy buena calidad recomendada 100%
5.0,I have been very happy with these gloves.  The sizing was accurate and the gloves fit well.  The product feels like it is well built and the gloves are fairly warm for every day use.
5.0,"Love these pants! They are so comfy and fit perfectly. I am a large in pants and on<br />the curvier side. I love how they make my body look and I feel they are so great for business attire, work or just casual."
5.0,Love these it fits alot snugger than my other ones. It also doesn't seem to stretch out like previous ones I have bought.
5.0,"Nice top. Pretty , I had alot of compliments on it."
5.0,"Good for work, thank you"
5.0,"Just got them but, so far so good!"
5.0,Very light weight.  Very beautiful for jewelry making.  Worth the pennies spent.
5.0,Bought this as a gift for my 16 year old daughter.<br />She loved it!
5.0,Bungee cord should be a little thicker
5.0,Esta bien megusto mucho
5.0,Great support for my daughters cheer
5.0,"It started falling apart after a while, but it might just be because I only took it off when taking a shower. Makes a great gift for you and you significant other. 5/7 would buy again."
5.0,"I needed low (10-15mm HG) compression for a pesky vein that itches if I sit all day. These sleeves let me wear my super fun socks, are way easier to put on than full compression socks, and keep the vein from acting up. According to my dermatologist, they'll also keep my risk of edema caused scarring (yes, it's a thing, the red icky looking legs some folks get after years of swelling) down."
5.0,"love these socks, soft cotton."
5.0,"Purchased tow of these after having a terrible experience with luggage from Antler UK, and have to say these luggage is great... totally worth: beautiful and solid made, great wheels, and very resistant."
5.0,They look very nice.
5.0,Comfortable well made just what I was looking for
5.0,"Sturdy, well-made, hypo-allergenic, and very pretty. These make great gifts and people have thought they were genuine!"
5.0,"Bought this for a friend who loves gardening and she likes it very much.  It's light,  breathable  and keeps all the bugs & mosquitoes away.  Highly recommended."
5.0,Bought these for my husband who was size 14 wide feet. He has a really hard time finding shoes that fit - even sandals. He cannot wear Rainbows - we took a chance on ordering these and he loves them! Great buy.
5.0,one word beautiful
5.0,really kept my felt warm in Iceland.  shoe looks and feels great on! must buy! great value!
5.0,"So soft and comfortable, I ordered a large after reading reviews glad I did bc if not it would have been too big."
5.0,Beautiful necklace.  Perfect gift for my teenage daughter.
5.0,My granddaughter loves Peppa Pig!!!
5.0,These made my butt look more defined and not huge!
5.0,Perfect to wear with slacks as knee high hose are too long since I have short legs. I wear a size 6.5 shoe so the size is great
5.0,My six year old grandson said they are very cozy and comfortable grandma.
5.0,I am on the taller side so it looks slightly short on me but it is amazing and the perfect color.
5.0,Daughter said they fit okay. She's in between sizes and does not like women underwear. These are the largest ones I found in the kids styles that she likes.
5.0,Grandson loves them I loved the price.
5.0,I got this for my daughter because she loves to wear dresses. My daughter is a big 3 year old so I purchased the 6t and it fit exactly like I wanted it to. Not too long not too short. I’m absolutely in love with this dress and it’s not uncomfortable on her!
5.0,Just had to replace one that I had had for years.  They really wear well.  So glad they still had the same style in production.
5.0,These jeans are great! The material is super soft and they are great for pairing going out looks or even casual. These would be great for fall as they would look really cute with a lot of sweaters and some olive colored tops. These shipped SUPER fast and I had the pants within just days of purchasing. They do run a bit small so I would recommend going a size up if you're on the cusp of the measurements. I am typically a size 2-3 in jeans and pants and ordered a small but think a medium would fit well as well.
5.0,I'm in love 😍
5.0,Bought this in a 2xl I have a full chest so this one i thought would work not so. All 2xls do not fit the same this one ran particularly small. It is a nice sweater but better suited for a more slender person. If you are a little more fluffy this will not have the best fit.
5.0,The quality and pricing are great. Perfect fit with the adjustable buckle.
5.0,Love this cute little charm. Looks just like it's pictured.
5.0,"Great products, we had fun wearing them to a Christmas party!"
5.0,Great swimming trucks.
5.0,The grey goes with anything you wear. All around a good looking well made shirt. Will buy another in a different color.
5.0,will order more in other colors!
5.0,My child loves FNF so this was perfect for him.
5.0,Last minute Halloween mask but it’s great quality and look great !
5.0,I love the simplicity of the bracelet. The size of the font is just what i was looking for. So happy with this purchase.
5.0,"Runs true to size - I wear a size small/medium and a small fit me great. I'm 5'5"" and hits right at my knees. I love that it has pockets and they are deep! Cute dress!"
5.0,"I love with this dress, confortable, sexy and casual"
5.0,Easy to take care of nice workskirt
5.0,Really attractive kippah that looks even better than I expected from the pictures.  Really happy with this purchase!
5.0,"Great one, not for big faces though. If it fits, it feels great. Great built quality too."
5.0,Comfortable and Supportive
5.0,"I really like these hoops. If they get caught on something, they pull off your ears instead of ripping your ear lobe. Exactly what I was looking for."
5.0,"Moana!!!!  LOVE these cute tennis shoes.  Made well, and are being enjoyed."
5.0,I have chosen these from the two frames I ordered to be my next pair of glasses.  I love the red.  The bling is nice but not necessary.  I see now that they are sold out.  Smart choice.  I am glad I saw them when I did.
5.0,Great price.  Great item for fans.
5.0,Absolutely love this skirt. I bought a size down(large) and was a bit nervous on sizing but it fits like a charm. Has the perfect stretch to it.
5.0,Soft scarf<br />Got many compliments
5.0,These are great for watching TV while using the Laptop or iPhone.
5.0,"Got this on sale and it's a good cover up for the beach. It is a weird material, but it definitely dries fast. It says ""Medium"" but it's one of those one size fits all, because I bought an XS of this in a different color and they are the exact same size."
5.0,Bought 2 more since she wears it 3 days a week. Best girls leotard ever.
5.0,I bought this for my toddlers boots & it works great!
5.0,"This is a very nice purse.-not too small and not too large/bulky, and is reasonably priced!.  It's very hard to find one that has a lot of exterior zippers/pockets to hold your keys, phone, etc., but this one fits the bill - and it's all leather!  I'm very pleased with it."
5.0,"Fit great, comfortable and look good."
5.0,"Overall fit as expected. I'm 5'3 & I wore it as,a dress. No leggings. Got lots of compliments. I'm curvy so the style works great."
5.0,"I love it. It is easy to use. Easy to find, in my very unorganized purse. I can located my credit cards all in one place. I would recommend it, if you need it.<br />Thank you."
5.0,The colors really stand out and are a varied enough assortment to have one to go with any of my ties. They're about 1/8&#34; longer than some of my thin ties but it looks fine. The bar is relatively smooth on the back and the teeth on the clip are not as large as some of my other tie clips but I stuck a tiny piece of Velcro on the back of the bar and it works perfectly to keep it from slipping (I move about a lot at work). I find myself wearing one of these nine out of ten days and have had compliments from coworkers.
5.0,I bought these earring for someone who never wears earrings and it was great. Easily clipped on and looked beautiful on her .
5.0,"Square or rectangular brown lens aviators are the only sunglasses that both look good on me and fit my wide nose but narrow face. This is an excellent example - comfortable, light weight, adjustable fit, good polarization, and cheap!<br /><br />They work great for driving because the frame doesn't obstruct view to car blind spots.<br /><br />The temples with rubber on the entire inside are a great feature. They look nice, and are grippy and very easy to adjust.<br /><br />Very happy with them, will order another pair for a car backup at this price."
5.0,Love!! Fabric is very soft..
5.0,"The gym I go to has small half sized lockers and it gets crowded.  I've been looking for a bag that I can use without having to pull it out, put it back, etc as I changed & showered.  Add to that, one I didn't have to keep out while getting dressed.  Sometimes there is no room to put it anywhere other than the floor and constantly bend down to put things away or get things out.<br /><br />I have seen people with the Ogio locker bags but they always seem to take them out or the locker to use them, when I saw this one I decided to take the risk and spend a few more bucks.  And BOY - did this turn out to be perfect.<br /><br />First of all, it fits perfectly in the locker, the bag opens on the side panel, I couldn't tell that from the pictures but it's brilliant.  It hangs perfectly on the hooks at the top which leaves room below the bag to put the wet towel and sweaty gym clothes while I pull the clean ones out of the bag and put them on. When I'm done I put the sweaty clothes in the wet area at the top and zip it up. The insert bag for shampoo, deodorant, etc is perfect.  I can hang that on the knob where the lock is and everything is easily accessible without taking up bench space or having to bend down to go into the bag on the floor.<br /><br />The large side pocket is perfect for my wallet, watch, etc. and is located in back, not easy to find or quick to get at if someone were to break into the locker.  Once I am dressed I can get at them when I take the bag out of the locker.<br /><br />In short - I love this bag.  It's a bit more expensive, but it's made in the USA and it's definitely worth every penny!!"
5.0,Was bigger than what it looked like in the picture
5.0,"These are amazing! I was so tired of trying to keep my baby from pulling off her socks and these have worked beautifully. They come up to just below her knee and they stay on! Even if she tries to pull them off, they're long enough that she isn't successful. Finally her toes are warm and covered. We also get compliments on them constantly."
5.0,"I love the color. If you love the color as advertised that’s not how it looks in your ear, you can see the purple in some light settings, other than that it’s a deep purple, I love it either wait worth the penny!"
5.0,I got it I open it I put it on and yes I like it very much so do all my friends .
5.0,This is a great product and I am happy with the look and feel of this . Thank you.

5.0,The watch is new again....
5.0,"Love these gloves always have on hand for multiple uses. They are food safe as well. Use them when handling meat and chicken, easy on and throw away! Have used for planting taking the disposable pad off steamer any dirty job! Many more uses!!!!!"
5.0,"Muy buena y encaja muy bien, le pude poner con la ayuda de una pinza para sacar los pasadores y las llaves allen que trae la correa te ayudan a sacar fácilmente la primera parte tienes que colocar bien la correa para alinear a la hora de poner los pasadores. La calidad muy buena."

5.0,"I like it. I initially wanted this for my morning walks so that I wouldn't have to wear my face mask and have a mustache sweat or my lipgloss all lol! Well, it's so comfortable and functional that I wear this everywhere now! I even get compliments. I feel stylish in a horrible pandemic"
5.0,Well made and super flattering
5.0,Like it very comfortable.
5.0,Gorgeous bag! I'm in love.
5.0,"I like the Presentski bracelet, the price is lovely. I used to spend a lot on pandora, the color tarnished after  12 months. Now I am stuck with a useless bracelet with many charms I paid a lot of money for...I can't even sell it because it is so tarnished. Don't buy Pandora. Presentski is only 1/10 the price. When the color fades, just throw it away and get a new one, because of the lovely price."
5.0,Good as usual casio
5.0,It's great. Had to adjust it significantly but I wear it everyday. Nice design and a few scratches after wearing bit still pretty durable.
5.0,So cool! My son wanted this for Halloween. He got so many compliments on this mask.
5.0,"I bought this after reading so many positive reviews. I absoloutly love it. I bought it to replace an aluma wallet, which smashed into pieces from a 2-3 foot drop from my had on the pavement in my parking lot. It is actually sleeker than the aluma wallet and yet seems to hold slightly more. It is eye catching and unique. I currently have 6 credit cards/id's and 9 bills in it and it closes comfortably. It could easily take a couple more bills or another card. Combine all these positive attributes with the under 10 dollar price and you've got a winner here!"
5.0,"This is way cuter than the pictures!  Fits great, and so pretty!  It’s SO comfortable and a great price!!!"
5.0,They got here on time much earlier then the listed estimated date they came around 5 or 6 days after I ordered them and all of the gems are there and everything they look a little small when you get them but once you put them in ey stay there unless you pull them out
5.0,I love these things! I do indoor cycling 4-6 days a week and I had the problem of my glasses falling off my face and to the ground or constantly having them slide down! Now with these I feel comfortable wearing them!
5.0,Grandson was thrilled with this for his 8th birthday!
5.0,"OMG!!!! Love, love, love!!!💜 Perfect. I accidentally stained collar when taking it off. I freaked! Tiny bit of pretreatment and it Came out! Will be ordering again! Top notch 👌"
5.0,"Beautiful bracelet,  came with a charging stone.  Arrived  quickly."
5.0,"The case is the real plus. Smooth, fits comfortably in your pocket. The quality of the glasses is great. It would be nice if they came in gold as well, I'd buy more of them."
5.0,This is my favorite watch band. It doesn’t budge during the day and goes with everything I wear:)
5.0,I bought these for nipples.  Healing better than surgical steel.  A little long but no more ball issues with going under skin.
5.0,Big hit!  She didn’t take them off for 2 hours.
5.0,I ordered the pink shirt and liked it so much I got one in white.  Nice material with a little stretch to it.  Also like the detail of the lace sleeve so it not just a plain shirt.

5.0,This polishing cloth has cleaned up my gold and silver jewelry beautifully!  I plan to order five more for Christmas presents!

I have at least 10 designs from past 2 years and was wearing oldest one recently & still holds its shape gripping on bridge of my nose nicely not falling off. Lightweight & the material is nice and smooth.  I can breathe just fine so I really recommend these!! -J"
5.0,I like this s*** if u have any fat on your back don't buy it . it has an open back that presses.but breast support is good.

5.0,"I am loving this leotard.  My daughter usually wears a size 6 in girls, but for dance items I have been told to always order a size up and it is just barely big.  It is perfect and the thickness and quality is very good.  Exactly what I wanted in a winter leotard for my daughter."
5.0,I love them. I have received several compliments!
5.0,Very pretty and well made. Fits my tiny ankles and lays nicely. Beautiful actual.

5.0,"All the teachers loved them! They do not look or feel cheap, and yet they were very inexpensive."
5.0,Great boots for children who wear afo braces. This was our second pair. Fit great and wore fairly well. My girl is tough on shoes and her first pair last year lasted all winter. Well worth the money for her to be able to put on and take off by herself.

5.0,Daughter loves it. Washes well. Seems to be made well.
5.0,"Love these boxers and have now bought them twice.  The only odd aspect is that, upon unpacking both shipments, the individual boxers had a very strong and unpleasant odor, most likely as part of either the manufacturing process or some issue with storage.  I did have to wash both shipments 2-3 times with a heavier amount of liquid detergent to allay to smell completely.  Other than this, these are fantastic for the money."
5.0,I love them and just my style! Can't beat the price either!
5.0,Looks great on my hat.

5.0,This necklace is the cutest for a pirate accessory . It looks better in person & the crystals sparkle well.
5.0,Light weight but a great purchase nonetheless
5.0,Very nice! Exact frame my daughter was looking for & price..
5.0,"I LOVE these tanks. They fit great, they don't make you sweat, and they are very, very comfortable.  I am the type that wears a camisole under everything, and I always put these on before any of the other tanks I have.  I have washed them several times and they have retained their shape and quality.  I also put everything in the dryer so no worries that it's going to shrink or that the fabric is going to change."
5.0,Perfect for an Abbadon cosplay at comic con! She's one of my favorite Supernatural baddies!
5.0,The material was beautiful and fit just as expected. Worn for homecoming and it was a big hit...definitely away from your typical homecoming dress but still fabulous. Would definitely look into getting different colors
5.0,this is a really good product i love it
5.0,"My son has sensory processing disorder with sound, touch, light. We got these headphones because my husband was having some work done in our yard with large equipment that was quit loud. Our son did very well with these. We are going to use them when we go to the movie theater as well. I now travel with these just in case we need them while out."
5.0,I love the shirt  Pam Grier one my all time favorites
5.0,Top fits well. Received compliments for the color and fit.
5.0,looked good but lost before use
5.0,"Bought this for my 6yo daughter for recital day to keep her warm while she waited. She loves it! It's pink and has pockets! The material is lightweight; however, is heavy enough to help retain some bodyheat. I really like the robe too. It was a great last minute find at a reasonable price point."
5.0,Because of design no one can see through the skirt
5.0,This belt is stylish but most importantly it is comfortable. Not too stiff as most dress belts are. Great purchase!

5.0,"Super cute and flowy! It fit perfect on my waist and the length was perfect, I even wore a 2inch heel. (I’m 5’6, 140lbs)"
5.0,Bought this for my mom and she loved it so much
5.0,"Absolutely LOVE this dress!!!  The sleeves are slightly shorter than pictured, BUT I love it more!  It's very flowey in appearance and the material is nice to the touch.  Very flirty and fits at the natural waist, so definitely gives that feminine look.  I'm going to love wearing this out during the spring!  &#60;3"
5.0,Fits just right for little hands
5.0,"I originally didn't have high hopes for this mask since I had previously bought one from this company and it arrived misprinted, but after receiving this second mask my mind on it has changed.  The mask was printed correctly and worked well for the photo shoot I had planned to use it for (see attached image).  Would definitely consider ordering from this company again after having received correct prints of the masks."
5.0,"Even though these camisoles run small, I gave them five stars because they are comfortable, wash well and are a great value."
5.0,"I have to give these shoes a solid 5 stars!! For the price, these babies held up wonderfully! I've suffered a financial hardship, and therefore just couldn't afford the brand names I'd once been accustomed to. So, I decided to order these which I thought were still stylish, affordable, durable, and could get us through a semester. Nearly half a school year and summer later (almost 8 months maybe) these shoes have lasted, and actually held up!! These belonged to an active 12 yo who's tough on shoes! Definitely pleased with my purchase, and have continued to buy these shoes."
5.0,Very cute on and a wonderful price point. You can dress this down or to go out at night. Very pretty and good quality.
5.0,Excelente producto. Buena compresión. Cumplió con lo esperado

5.0,I love this dress fits perfect 😍
5.0,I'm very satisfied with my purchase! Thank you seller!
5.0,"Amazing socks!! My daughter plays tournament softball, the cheap ones from big 5 only last a month or so, but not these! We lasted 1 entire season!"
5.0,They fit perfect! Super NICE and really comfortable. If you have bunions I think that is what they are called covers it. The sandal makes your feet look pretty. I have purchased 4 pairs two Ive already received and two on the way. You cant beat the price they Dont look cheap at all. Great for the California Sunshine.
5.0,Love these glasses! Great alternative to paying $150 for Ray Bans... I lose/break glasses way to much.
5.0,"I suffered my second DVT earlier this year.  I have purchased five different brands of compression socks.  These work best. Thee reasons.  They have good compression at my arch giving me some relief for having flat feet.  Also, other socks squeezed  my toes together causing discomfort; not an issue for toeless socks.  Finally, all compression socks are thin and your foot slides in some shoes.  Since these have no toes, I wear a thin nylon/cotton sock over my compression sock and get perfect comfort in the shoe."
5.0,"Not to warm to sleep in, great price I would order again."
5.0,Arrived quickly! Was even sent a free smaller version of the sticker. I love them. Thanks so much!
5.0,Adorable. Many compliments.
5.0,"The White Formal Dinner Jacket was delivered on time, and fit perfectly!"
5.0,Goes with everything- classic and low cost.
5.0,"Not overly soft, but acceptable when you take into account the lightweight fabric and great absorbency. Overall, great product for the money."
5.0,Love them!  Christmas gift for the grandson.  Can hardly wait to see him playing with them!
5.0,Awesome and outstanding great fit highly recommended
5.0,This brand is MUCH better than the Anemone Women's Lace Bralette which fits disappointingly small. This is much more like the one I got at Urban Outfitters. Would buy more - wish they had more colors. Super cute and sexy under tank tops. Good for those with small boobs.  :)
5.0,My daughter loves them.  This is her second pair of the same shoe.  Goes with anything she tells me.  We got the white.
5.0,"Very well made! I wear a large, ordered a large and it fit exactly like a large. The fabric was substantial, not flimsy and the drape was nice, not clingy. The color was exactly as it appeared on my screen. I am very happy with my purchase!"
5.0,"Gift for Mom, she loved it."
5.0,Perfect 👌🏻😻❤️
5.0,"The quality is WAY better than I expected, like wow. I get so many compliments when I wear it and it’s so comfy. Very true to size."

5.0,"Excellent buy for the price. I wear this belt to work daily, and it's holding up extremely well after the first few weeks."
5.0,Liked that it was easy to alter waist size.
5.0,"Darling belt, but hate the &#34;China&#34; smell from shipping"
5.0,"Super solid belt that deserves more recognition. The buckle is easy to operate and has a really simple design that is not prone to breaking. It's made of a really sturdy metal but isn't bulky at the same time. The belt itself is made of a rugged canvas material that will probably hold up to years of use, while also maintaining slight elasticity which helps when sitting down. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a belt that is easily adjustable in size and has good build quality. This belt beats a lot of the top rated products on Amazon and I wish it had more reviews/acknowledgement because it's seriously amazing!<br /><br />*I did NOT receive this belt at a discounted price in exchange for my review nor did the company reach out to me in any way. I paid full price for and I'm just a genuinely satisfied customer"
5.0,"I bought the pink one! It's cute, holds the essentials for my work day and I don't have to grab my wallet when I go for lunch. I think I'd prefer a thinner softer strap but it's fine I like the clasp part."
5.0,Super cute and easy Halloween costume! Jacket fits as expected with my regular shirt size.
5.0,"Nice knee high socks for the Gym or whatever. Comfortable, goes high up till knee and good value."
5.0,Very nice and large.  Polishes very well!
5.0,"AMAZING. Fit is great, quality is great. I get so many compliments on this and it’s soooo comfortable! It’s boutique quality. People are always surprised when I say i got it on Amazon! I’m usually wary of clothing from Amazon but you can buy this with confidence. It’s amazing"
5.0,Granddaughter loves these and so durable
5.0,"I really like them but the 2x is a bet too larger.<br />The colors are fade not like the picture, but I still love them"
5.0,Very nice purchase for my daughter!
5.0,this is a cozy night shirt that didn't shrink too much and I am wearing it a lot...'
5.0,looks good on verynice
5.0,The value for the money and the quality is awesome
5.0,"just beautiful , well constructed"
5.0,Loved it! Good quality material.<br /> Get a size smaller.
5.0,This charm complements the charms already on my bracelet .
5.0,Beautiful braclet...looks just like picture..very happy with this braclet. Well worth the $17.00 paid on cyber monday.
5.0,"Can wear as a dress. I'm 5'5"" and it comes right above my knees. Sheer but not flimsy. Would look good with a pair of tights. Pretty buttons, faux mother of pearl. Good buy."
5.0,This product was awesome and really helpful. It absolutely protects my elbows when I play volleyball on the wooden floor.
5.0,It was what was expected. Something to wear in everyday chores.
5.0,"Nice for the grandkids, they loved them"
5.0,These are working very well.  They hold quite a bit and are very easy to fold back up and stick in the glove box or wherever so they are always handy. I purchased several sets and gave my sister and my daughter a set
5.0,I love it!!?
5.0,"I ordered this dress for a rehearsal dinner for a wedding and it’s so much prettier than I expected. The fabric doesn’t look cheap as some do when you order off Amazon. It fits as expected so order your true size. It’s a simple, pretty dress that seems comfortable and easy to wear!"
5.0,Feels smooth. Girls love it.
5.0,"Bought this on impulse as a lighting deal and I'm highly impressed with the quality of this bag.  Very real looking faux leather, no plastic smell, can't find a flaw in the stitching.  The zippers operate smoothly and easily.  I've seen far lower quality on bags at 3-4 times the price."
5.0,"I have allergies to nickel, so 14K gold is all I can wear comfortably. I had some crystal dangle earrings with broken earwires and I wanted something a little fancier than plain earwires. The Fleur de Lis is perfect. The lever back doesn't get caught in my hair or clothes and the open ring made it easy to attach the dangles I already had."
5.0,"These are absolutely the best boots I've ever owned and the best money I've spent in a long time.  I've owned Sorel & Uggs but these top the cake.  They're super comfortable, run true to size and are very warm.  The first day I wore them it was -24 outside in Minnesota and the only thing that wasn't cold were my feet.  I highly recommend them!!"
5.0,"Good product, size fits."
5.0,"It's a Christmas gift, very beautiful and elegant..I'm very pleased."
5.0,"This sweater can be dressed up or down which is nice because I can wear it with jeans or leggings and have two completely different looks. The material is very soft and not itchy but because it is knitted the material has some spaces between it so you may need to wear a cami underneath it, but it really is not super see through. I like that the neck goes a little further up but is not a ""True"" turtleneck, it looks very classy. It is also warm to wear but not smothering."
5.0,My toddler usually wears leather moccasins so I was nervous she wouldn't be able to walk in these. She foes just fine and they look adorable
5.0,I am thrilled with FC Rose Gold GP anchor necklace. My youngest son is in the Navy and I wear it proudly.
5.0,Love this color blue.its beautiful and roomy
5.0,This was really nice too
5.0,When I pulled this dress out of the package the fabric was so soft. I tried it on and fell in love with it!  I am 5'7 and 210lbs I wear a 40DD and this fit perfect! It did not cling to my lower section at all! It flows very nicely and is super comfortable. If you are curvy this is a great dress! I will be buying a second one in another color!
5.0,The bracelet is as described and very pretty. The box looks great as well. Would recommend.
5.0,Well made. My 3 year old nephew loves it!!
5.0,Love this dress. Fits perfect. A great deal!!!
5.0,Good quality as what you paid for. True to size. However the length runs longer than expected.
5.0,"Gods always by my side but for some reason I seem to have better luck driving when a rosary is hanging in my car, great product a little small but worth it, shipped fast"
5.0,Looks amazing! Top quality.
5.0,I like this item.
5.0,I have a lot of keys for my different places of work and this is the best key chain ever! There’s no way the keys can accidentally fall off.
5.0,"For the amateur or professional coin collector/ watch repairman/ mad scientist, this is a great bargain at $7.  Works great.  30x is a good zoom for analyzing coins, watches, etc."
5.0,"LOTS of sparkles with these studs.  Posts and backs are a little thicker/larger than what I am used to.  But, that said are comfortable to wear so long as I don't wear them day after day.  The size of the stone is a carat per earring.  A great find at an amazing price."
5.0,"Un bonito trabajo un cierre muy bueno, y me encantan como quedan un poquito carito,pero valió la pena, estoy encantada con ellos"
5.0,"I bought black and Medium ,fit it perfect .Very soft in Summer day .Also suit for outdoor .very sexy and comfortable aroung my body ."
5.0,"Very high quality, well made, fast shipping and courteous customer service.  Only wish they made children’s sizes.  Would recommend."
5.0,Every time I were these cufflinks I get compliments. Thinking about buying a second pair in case I lose the first.
5.0,"Nice quality, great value for what the product is.  Not cheaply cast and then coated with paint. Smooth and well made die cut outs are clean and crisp. Very happy with purchase. Just beware they are metal and will swing from mirror with force due to weight."
5.0,"The first one I received had a little rip in it, I told the seller, and they quickly sent another one. I bought it for international travel & its perfect. It is so roomy, and fit everything I needed & more! A slight annoyance is that the straps do need adjusting from time to time - I wore it as a backpack the whole time. I kept a water bottle, umbrella, wallet & sunglasses in it the whole time and still had space. I am very happy with my purchase."
5.0,I got a pair of ultra light glasses and I couldn’t keep them on my face. Now I don’t have to worry about them falling and breaking anymore. My husband used them when working outside and gardening so he doesn’t have to worry about his glasses slipping when he sweats.
5.0,"Works as advertised. Had others before, but this one is my favorite."
5.0,"I am enjoying my watch! It's face is large enough to read easily, but not so big that it looks masculine. Holds up well around water"
5.0,It took a little while to get this but it was well worth the wait! I love it!
5.0,Get holes easy
5.0,Love it. Only wish the earring hooks had not been patina'd at it makes them too difficult to insert into piercings.
5.0,Cute oversized sweater. It looks great with my leggings and boots. It is also very comfortable and the neck part of the turtleneck does not bother me like some can. Perfect fall/winter sweater.
5.0,Fits really good and also works
5.0,🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘
5.0,The necklace was shipped quickly and I love it.  Very well made and just what I wanted.<br />I would buy again from this company.
5.0,It's very stylish with the rectangular face.  Especially like the rose gold.  The price was exceptional.  Bought two so that we had a back up.
5.0,"Great hat. Was a total hit, my husband added lights and a decorative Dia de los Muertos skull. It was the best at the party."
5.0,These sunglasses are great and love how they fit. I can easily pull them up and they sit nicely when I’m indoors. The polarization really helps keep my eyes from being bothered by the sun!
5.0,Got it!! Love it cant wait till the other one gets here!! Thanks amazon and Mobile Expression.
5.0,"I was looking for some every day stud earrings and ordered this product. There are 56 pairs with an assortment of  silver earrings, gold earrings, and rose gold earrings. Mix and match for every day and also for dress up. Love the assortment. There was also a bonus included, a lovely velveteen pouch to store them in. This is a great buy and would make a great gift."
5.0,"100% Polyester. True to size. Just as pictured. Great skirt for a nice T-shirt or blouse. Comfortable and soft. Not too tight or restricting when walking.<br />Only thing is, you might need a slip to wear underneath so your legs/panty line don’t show when the light hits your skirt.<br />But other than that a great skirt! Would recommend and buy again for sure!!!"
5.0,Cute Pajamas . Fits well
5.0,"The band isnt as nice as a Fossil band,  but since it's cheaper,  I can overlook that.  But now, just after my 30 day window closed,  I have lost part of the screw that holds it together. I've owned a few Fossil bands and have never had this problem, so like a fool,<br />I didn't keep my spares. Now,  I can't figure out how to contact this company to get a new screw and I can't wear my watch until I get a new one. Super frustrating."
5.0,These are great and so cute! They look just like the picture. Great oversized square glasses for the price!

5.0,"I got this for my best friends Christmas Eve party. We are a fun group- I wanted something super festive and something the kids would like. It’s a good fit and honestly better quality than I expected for the price. For a one night outfit it was exactly the amount I was willing to spend. The fit is great. Has a little stretch. For reference I am 6ft tall, 140 lbs- usually wear a 2-4 and I ordered the small and it fits well."
5.0,I LOVE these shoes. Definitely worth buying!!
5.0,"Great casual summer shorts. I wanted something softy and comfy for travel and walking, They are perfect. They are ultra lightweight, breathable and comfortable without being too expensive or too 'gym shorts' looking，These exceeded my expectations. I'll order another different color again."
5.0,MY LITTLE GRANDSON WAYLON LOVES MICKEY MOUSE AND HE LOVES THE COLOR RED. THE PRICE WAS GREAT AND HE WAS SURPRISED TO GET AT CHRISTMAS. FITS GREAT AND HE HAS A LITTLE ROOM TO GROW. HE IS A TWIN AND SO<br />WHEN I GET THINGS FOR THE BABIES I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET SOME USE OUT OF THEM. THIS WOULD<br />HAVE COST MORE IN THE STORE SO I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE VALUE. THANKS
5.0,My 2 boys use these under their uniforms. They are compression shirts so the fit snugly.
5.0,My son wore this for his 1st birthday.The material is very soft.He is now almost 15 months and it still fits him.I would recommend this item.
5.0,My husband doesn't really wear belts often so I wanted to get him a 2 for 1 kind of belt. This one suits that need. The buckle is heavy but that's good for my husband because he is rough on everything.
5.0,Great credit card carrying phone case.Good adhesive stick on back and good magnetic stick on the closure. Love that the credit cards all pull up and out when you open the enclosure!
5.0,I bought 12 of these tanks because they are PERFECT in every way

5.0,Pantalonngrande jacket pequeño
5.0,Really Comfortable!
5.0,I thought this was a women's shirt it was my fault for buying it too big. It did shrink a little.
5.0,I bought this for my brother urn. Very happy and came perfect!
5.0,It holds my chip securely and seems very well made...I used to carry my yearly chip in my pocket but they would fade over time...this will prevent that
5.0,Saw the reviews ordered one size smaller .. Perfect Fit !
5.0,"Comfy, right size and it'll shrink if you wash it in hot water than use a dryer on hot because it is cotton and not preshrunk."
5.0,Really nice quality and fit really good!!!! I am glad I purchased these!!!
5.0,"I needed a watch-face that is big and easy to read. This is it! I clip it on my purse strap, or on a belt loop. I can read the time at a glance. I don't snicker at inexpensive watches: my last $8.00 watch lasted me for seven year! So happy to have found this one."
5.0,"I am 6ft 170 and got an xl, it is kind of small. I like my clothes a little bit bigger. My little is 18months I forgot what size, whatever was recommended on size chart she is 30lbs, it fits her great. Material is thicker than I thought, but not to think. Not see through. The back red thing does move around, but can easily be sown on if wanted to. Washed twice didnt shrink which was great."
5.0,"This pair of wedges is just awesome. I got myself 2 pairs(the gold and fuchsia---the colours are just amazing)!! The cutting of these wedges is a little bigger than the usual shoes I wear so instead of wearing a size 9 or 9.5, I managed to comfortably fit my feet into a size 8.5 for these shoes. A must have for all you women out there!"
5.0,"I already have one of these purse. I used it for a year Loved it. Purchased it at Kohl's for a lot more money.I like the new one.<br /> But doesn't seem to be made quite as well as the other one but at half the price. Still liked it. I probably will purchased<br />another I like the way it's put together I like crossbody kind of purses. So I'd say purchase it. This one was gray,<br /> I had a blue one and I would probably purchase a black one next."

5.0,"Great quality, doesn't pull on ears and the Vegeta is sublimated so it doesn't peel off."
5.0,"Previous comments helped by saying blouse ran a little large, which was true.<br />But I rather have a blouse roomy rather than tight.  Was pleasantly surprised<br />that blouse was elegant, comfortable and beautifully designed."
5.0,"I have a dog that needs to be walked twice a day rain or shine.  This is wonderful for the rainy days.  It is not a great fashion statement but is very serviceable and keeps me dry while having the use of both hands, one for the leash and one of oh maybe, coffee."
5.0,This protection mask is really awesome. Fits real good and offers great UV protection.

5.0,Very pretty. Used for<br />Costume. As described
5.0,Great looking with quality at best price!
5.0,My husband loves his new wallet.  The only down side on this is that you cannot store too much cash inside because it does not close.
5.0,I love this shirt! It is way cuter than I expected! Thank you! Very soft material too =)
5.0,Wear this every day
5.0,I had to run string through to the center of front. Fun and comfortable. Accentuates curves.
5.0,"I'm 4""11' and my waist is 34😔 I'm working to lose some inches but in the meantime I need clothes. I bought a medium and it comes up over my muffin top, which is great.The material is stretchy as another reviewer stated. From the photos judge how this might fit based on your height and waist measurement. I can't attest to how it holds up in the wash because I got it yesterday, but I plan to hand wash and air dry it. Thanks everyone for the great reviews, they helped me decide what size to buy."

5.0,My toddler hates wearing shoes but I took these out of the box to try them on him. He hasn’t taken them off yet

I have no idea how or why this fits so perfectly on so many different body types, but it does! I am 6'0 and 145 lbs with measurements of 34-24-34, and a light C cup and a Medium fit well for me."

5.0,Great looking glasses for my daughter!
5.0,"My husband loves this hat!!!  He is in the sun a lot in the summer cutting grass, working in the yard, at pools when camping, etc.  This hat has air vents above the brim of the hat so it keeps the sun off and lets air in.  It has the string for holding it around your neck or tightening it, if need be, in a storm. It has some really nice detail on the cap part, and the seams are extremely well sewn and there is no fraying, no crooked lines. This is really a great all around hat or fishing hat! he is thrilled with this hat. He is really likes the wide brim.  it is made of cotton material so it is washable.  It looks to be a sturdy hat.  I received the Winnideo Outdoor Sun Wide Brim Camouflage hat a a discounted price or free for my review."
5.0,La ventilación es exelente y el peso es correcto.
5.0,I like it because it’s religious. And it’s attractive.
5.0,I wish it fit. I think too small of a style for tall Americans. It was well made so if you are Petite you should look adorable in it.
5.0,This was my best Amazon purchase ever. Loved everything about this dress... Just had a baby in February. It's fitted in the upper waist but also flares out in the lower waist which is flattering. Can't wait to wear it!
5.0,Perfecto. Cumplen lo prometido. Muy recomendable.
5.0,Kinda sexy watch washing but I liked them
5.0,"So... it's a belt.  Unlike most belts I've owned in the past, the leather on this belt is more pliable.  I'm sure how this would effect the fit, but I think this belt probably won't last as long as I'd like, or it may stretch out sooner, but I don't see that as a big deal.  If it fails early somehow, I will update this review.  The texture on it is really nice, as is the buckle design and finish.  It is a wide belt also, which I like and I really appreciate having a reversible belt for my blacks & browns.  I'm looking forward to at least 2-3 years of use from this one."
5.0,"Very well made. It is plastic, but the head of the blade is screwed on to the handle, so it's not going anywhere. The weight is great. Itmakes you want to swing it every time you pick it up.<br />Looks like image."
5.0,"Fits perfectly on my Oakley Turbine as described.  Visibility is great during my mountain biking sessions.  I do see some glare spots, maybe from the polarization."
5.0,Bought this as a present for my daughter.  It is thin as described but it is well made and pretty - she loves it!
5.0,arrived early and as described
5.0,"The fit is great but you do need to order a size up. If you want it loose fitting, order two sizes up. I love the way it looks!"
5.0,I got this one for my work and close up work and detecting counterfeits. I like the stainless steel but also have one in black as well. Don't leave home without one. You never know when you may need one. Good for all kinds of close up work.
5.0,This mask is amazing!!! Only minor issue is the holes for the eyes are too close. Some minor cutting to open them up more and perfecto.<br />Great mask. Exactly as the picture shows
5.0,This was bought for my teenage daughter and she likes it alot
5.0,Dress fit great and was great quality!
5.0,Loved the casual look of the piece!
5.0,Very nice quality material. Very reliable seller.
5.0,Excellent quality and material<br />But if you have a big butt a little hard to pull up and pass trough<br />the seams do not stretch<br />Beside that everything is great
5.0,So fluffy and furry!!!! They are so puffy you have to squeeze into them but they will break in and fit perfectly. Have bought several pairs and by far these are the best ones so far!!!! Will buy again for sure!
5.0,I love this dress. Just wish it wasn't so see through.
5.0,Loved the fit and the color of the shirt. It was exactly as expected.
5.0,"Sweet thick beads, great addition for a 40th bday celebration"
5.0,"Super beautiful though and a really great quality, so I will definitely be swapping the sun out for a smaller size because this is a must-have"
5.0,Fit my daughter great!
5.0,Excellent watch.  Functioning flawlessly.  Looking to purchase another.
5.0,They are grest even though they are from china. We try to purchase everything including fresh veg from usa. I use them everyday.
5.0,I have a Series 5 watch in Stainless Steel Gold and the Shinning Gold band perfectly matches the watch! I only had to take out 2 links (which was very easy to do) for it to fit perfectly. It looks cute & classy.
5.0,"Great hat for cold winters! Side flaps cover a lot of cheek area, and with mask the only thing exposed is eyes. And even then, large brim keeps snow out. Mask is roomy and comfortable.  Hat tightness adjusts with drawstring. Very pleased!"
5.0,most comfortable belt.......EVER!
5.0,A lovely product soft  and comfortable.
5.0,Just exactly as shown in picture. Purfect light aqua color for my toddler grandson.  They came 1 day earlier than advise which was also nice
5.0,I saw a lot of negative reviews about it breaking and turning the wrist green but this has not done either. I've had it on 24/7 for over a week now and this Viking bangle is amazing!!! Absolutely love it!!
5.0,"I love this flannel gown. Good quality material. Very comfortable. I ordered another one. I wish there are more colors, so I can order some more."
5.0,Love the material and feel of the dress. I ordered a SM/4 and I'm 5'4&#34; and 115 lbs. The arms were a bit snug so I won't be putting this in a dryer! But everything else is very comfortable and classy. V neck is not low at all.
5.0,"The ladies I made this purchase for L O V E them, they wear them proudly."
5.0,My daughter loves this cute top!  She is 5’3” and around 100 lbs and we bought the small. It fits perfectly.
5.0,My 3 year old loves this costume. Sizing was perfect. Fit great and probably better quality and price than stores offer right now
5.0,This belt is well made and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality for the price.
5.0,Quick delivery.
5.0,Great quality and price! The hat says it all!
5.0,"My 11 yr old refuses to wear pads. It's a fight and a half. Someone told me about period panties. So I went on a search. The first pair we bought didn't hold and leaked. You have to wear a pad with those... Well, that wouldn't do. So we bought these. No pad needed. They don't leak and hold very well during her periods. No more fights or meltdowns over pads. I suggest buying several pairs as you'll need to wash them and hang dry them. I've worked out a system that works for us. I was very worried between the price and some of the reviews, but these are well worth it. (I can't put a price on one less meltdown I have to deal with.) kiddo loves them. Says they are comfortable and fit very well. If you have a child like mine, who can't stand the feel of pads and isn't ready for tampons, just do it. Go for it. It's worth it"
5.0,"Excellent compression socks. They stay up, don't slip and fall down.Legs don't hurt. Very durable."
5.0,Fits true to size. These are perfect and I like that they are SPF rated.
5.0,"I love this dress.  It twirls wonderfully, is comfortable, and looks great on.  I am going to wear it to my prom at church."
5.0,I use this shirt as I run 4-5x a week. when its a little cool out and I need to wear a light shirt with long sleeves. the fabric is wonderful and is moisture-wicking..
5.0,so fun he loves them
5.0,Exactly like the original from FitBit with the exception this one has a better clasp than the original so I'm happier with it.  I would definately buy from them again and highly reccomend them!
5.0,"It is a beautiful spring/Easter dress.  My daughter is a tall 2 year old and I got the 3t size. It fits her well, maybe a little long but it will be fine in a couple of months for the spring time."
5.0,I order a small but tgey were too small. I will need to return and get a bigger size. I really love how warm they keep my hands.
5.0,I love these earrings. I receive compliments every time I wear them.
5.0,I ordered a medium and it fit perfect my only dislike is that it rises when you walk you can dress and up are down I love it!
5.0,"Ordered: 04 Green Red Dress.  It is very pretty.  It fits just the way I wanted it too.  Material is soft and feels great on.  I will use it for appointments and casual wear.  Also, have ordered the Black Dress.  Am very pleased with both dresses.  Thank you for selling on Amazon.  LADYD"
5.0,Currently my favorite purse. Very cute. Lots of pockets !

5.0,"perfect for weeding ,for those who love formal dresses,here is one."
5.0,"Excellent.  Finally, a great jewelry cleaner without the horrible chemical smell. Did a nice job!"
5.0,Great quality definitely order your size. From my experience most bralettes run small so I order a large instead of a medium and I should of ordered the medium. But I definitely love it.
5.0,This ring is super cute and super secure in my nose! I love it and my teenager even said it was cool looking!
5.0,"Got a red one and a white one because the price was amazing and I was really scared that since they were cheap and coming from another country, that they'd be garbage. BUT I was very pleasantly surprised. They're SSSOOOO soft and perfect length and so cute! Highly recommend them! The white one seems to stretch a lot more, it could be because of the type of &#34;stitch&#34; used to make it, but I love both of them and I wear them a lot! I'm also about to have a baby and plan to use them as a light cover when I breastfeed! Also, no horrible smell or anything like that, and did I mention how SOFT they are?!?! Lol! I want to get 2 of every color now!"
5.0,Super cute charm. Just as expected.
5.0,"Five star sports bra. It has an extremely high quality, almost luxury fabric feel. So soft and comfortable. The color is cute and the design is very slimming. It is more of a cropped top than a bra, which makes it even more comfortable. Buy with confidence. This will be the best sports bra you’ll own."
5.0,This skirt is sooo comfy but still form fitting and makes my buttocks look fabulous! It folds over like Yoga pants do and that adds to he tummy support without squishing my fat out the sides. Perfect fit!
5.0,"Beautiful sweater! Fits true to size, soft, designed beautifully, and feels high end. Love, love, love this sweater."
5.0,Was a little bigger than I expected but fits comfy! Didn't shrink much when washed. Bought a size bigger than I should have nevertheless it still fits how I wanted.
5.0,Was a gift for my grandson and he loved them<br />Great buy
5.0,"Got mine in yesterday, very cute. However beware, mine did not come with a paw print but a little sunflower instead."
5.0,"These are cute. I find the quality to be good. I ordered a size bigger thinking they would run small and I'm wishing I ordered the current size because they run true to size. I ordered 9-12 months when my nephew is in 6 months but is on the chubby side, and it's still to big for him. I ordered the white set that says boss on it it's very cute. The pants have a cute print on them as well.<br /><br />I received this product for a discount in exchange for my unbiased review"
5.0,Great shirts . Will order again.  I'm 5'10 240lbs and ordered size  XL
5.0,"It looks good, the material is waterproof, its cheap, this is great."
5.0,Very long. And extremely comfertable.
5.0,Fits comfortably on the wrist. Hopefully it gives more luck than previous bracelets I have had.
5.0,"Great quality, soft.  Not stiff like some t shirts can be.  Sized up not knowing how it would fit, was a good decision  as she does not like tight shirts.  Bought it for a friend and she loved it!<br />Price awesome."
5.0,The dress is nice and the fabric is thick<br />It is just not for me.
5.0,Get bigger size if you are in between sizes
5.0,It's comfy cute for a good price.
5.0,gave to 19 year old son for birthday present.  he loved it.
5.0,Was actually quite soft and seems to be good quality.
5.0,My husband just had surgery along his calf. He was having a difficult time with swelling. His surgeon recommended using compression socks and we ordered the travel socks. We have since bought a second pair. Highly recommended!!!
5.0,"Great, warm and soft beanie hat. In a winter that doesn't seem to end in Boston, this came really handy - my go-to hat most days of the week.<br />The fleece really adds comfort and warmness. I want to buy more colors or other models of the same.<br />Highly recommend."
5.0,"Fits my all my waxing necessities. Iron, wax, base cleaner, fiberlene, diamond stones, edge files, roto-brush and my black & decker drill."
5.0,I call this dress my stylish muu-muu. I have gained so much weight over the last few years. Dresses are preferred over pants. This dress is very cute and forgiving of my curves. I can be cute and comfortable. Win-win!
5.0,"The material is ok, kind of stretchy so it's not like a straitjacket, but mine I chose the size that would give me a normal &#34;loose&#34; fit. I thought it looked spectacular!"
5.0,Me encantaron .....son hermosos
5.0,Awesome shirt. Very distinct and bold. I get a lot of compliments on it.
5.0,These were such a great buy! Had a little bag for the boots to b kept n...which will come n very handy for our impending move from Anchorage to Ga ugh. Anyways these are very well made and the robot theme is a adorable.  They're a little on the big side but at my on fault not the company...I ordered them a little bigger so they'd fit a little longer but ordered them a little bit bigger than I meant to lol. These were for my 1 year old twin grandsons.
5.0,"Using it on our boat to hold the curtain on our ""porta potty"" when not in use. Serves the purpose just fine."
5.0,It’s a little smaller than expected. If the kids have a lot of books this ain’t the bag for them. Still very sturdy and good material
5.0,"It appears we will be wearing facemask for awhile.  I was so afraid of leaving my facemask in a restaurant, bar,etc.  these straps will fix that problem.  The clasp are perfect for my favorite masks.  Love the colors."
5.0,"Love these, soft, stretchy, comfortable. Fit seems good, no complaints"

5.0,I absolutely love this dress!! It is long enough to wear with leggings or without. It is not see through at all. I will order again from this seller.
5.0,"Wonderful socks! Ordered S/M last time but it is a bit tight for a shoe size 9.5, but the socks are so comfortable so I tried again and ordered L/XL and they have a better fit! Used them in gym and love them!"
5.0,Looks fabulous on and I can see the time without needing my glasses!

5.0,XL fit perfect! 5’5 200lb Cutest dress ever by itself or with belt
5.0,I bought a medium. This fits so nicely and it's long enough to go over your butt if you want some coverage. Tunic style and love the little thumb holes in the sleeves. Comfy enough to lay around it and light weight and durable enough to workout in

5.0,The LadyColour Blush Rose Teardrop Necklace is SO beautiful that I'm very satisfied with it. This is one of my favorite Thanksgiving purchases. I will definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a high quality jewelry with a reasonable price.
5.0,"This top is so comfortable.  Material is soft, kept me warm all day and absolutely love the pockets.  Bought the blue color and it was a little darker than expected but nothing I couldn't live with."
5.0,Better than shown in pics!
5.0,Love my purchase!! Very good quality for the price.
5.0,Material is not really thick but they are stretchy and comfortable.
5.0,Personal use ! Great choice!
5.0,I purposely bought the 4x. I washed it twice in hot water. It shrank but it’s perfect! Still very roomy and great length. I love the fact it has pockets. I may just buy another one.
5.0,I will be a very happy man if my girlfriend is as excited as I was when I saw these and thought of her immediately.
5.0,"This is a high quality band at a nice low price for you Fitbit Alta. I had no trouble adjusting the size with the handy tool included with it. My only negative comment would be it took longer to get than the normal 2 days I've been spoilt by Amazon to expect! I would highly recommend this, but would say it's mainly a band for men, not women. It's most likely too large for for most women, and is fairly heavy, which does not bother me, but might bother most women."
5.0,fits well..I wear with leggings.
5.0,"Product was neatly packaged, arrived sooner than expected, and even included a cute card for gift giving, which was a nice addition to an already quality product."
5.0,The look is fantastic. Very similar to my Bulova. To change the sizing of the band was super simple which I loved. They even have a video to help!  I have gotten so many compliments on the band. Will definitely purchase from this seller again!!
5.0,Fits fine snd a black band for each mask is included.
5.0,Love all of the tops I ha e ordered
5.0,"Clips in well, has a very nice low profile. It's easy to turn it to be crooked in my glasses, but that's the nature of clip-ons. Overall, I'm very happy with the price, the low profile and the fact that it came in a case."
5.0,"I was reluctant to purchase this bracelet because no one had reviewed it at the time. I'm sure there are others who might bypass purchasing this bracelet for that same reason, so I decided to add my review. The bracelet was quite lovely, especially given the price. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality.  My daughter was quite happy to receive this as a gift. I was specifically looking for a coil-type bracelet because I have bought these for other family members in the past, and they have worked quite well for all size wrists. My daughter is very petite, so this type of bracelet is perfect for her wrist. These types of bracelets also work well for older people who struggle with clasps on jewelry. I love this bracelet, and I would not hesitate to buy this in another color from this seller."
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for my father. Not only did he love it, but it was much softer and longer than he or I expected. Also very warm."
5.0,Great value on good headbands!

5.0,I am very pleased with my shoes  my feet no longer hurt  would love to have a more dressy pair just as comfortable
5.0,"I got this metal-free belt for my dad, who discovered he has a nickel allergy. He's been wearing it since then with no problems, and he says it's very comfortable and durable. This was a great find, and we will definitely consider purchasing another belt from this seller in the future."
5.0,Turned out great! I purchased this for my 5 year old. I love how the monnogram turned out larger than expected.
5.0,Amazing quality! Very soft and warm. I will buy again.
5.0,"Great customer service! When the color I requested (ordering lingerie) was out of stock, they substituted a close color match AND  added an extra pair to each 3-pac. So I got 4-pac at no extra cost on what was already a good deal."
5.0,These earrings are really cute and unique. I like that it had good and silver tone as options.
5.0,Love Love Love this handbag!!  Perfect fit and adore the color!!
5.0,excellent even though they are made in china.
5.0,"My absolute favorite dress right now! Deep pockets, flattering fit, this dress has it all. Love the color option I picked, and am considering buying more in different colors. So comfy and the fabric is ridiculously soft and breathable. Feels like your favorite old t shirt but cute, longer, and with pockets."
5.0,I like this watch. The only dislike is that the light is not too powerful.
5.0,"I needed a black pencil skirt for a top I had bought. Nice stretch, good weight, excellent price. It was exactly what I was looking for and I would definitely buy again!"
5.0,"small, and very cute earrings!"
5.0,I had this on for the whole summer last year and received many compliments.  Doens't look cheap at all.  Bought more for friends.  They all like it.
5.0,"love. it’s the perfect sweater. amazing quality, covers your butt!"
5.0,"I'm 5'2"" and 130lbs. The small fits great. I love the comfort and it's perfect for running errands or dress it up with nice sandals and a bit of jewelry for date night. It's bright and colorful and my print is definitely not see through as some have mentioned. Love this dress."
5.0,These glasses are really nice! I love everything from the packaging to the way they fit.
5.0,So glad I purchased this bracelet. It looks expensive. The magnets are inside the bracelet.
5.0,"Daughter loves it and has received many compliments. I bought a medium even though she is a size small, it was a perfect decision."
5.0,I love this dress. It's absolutely beautiful! I usually wear an XL in dresses but they were out of stock so I bought a L instead and it fits great with more room if I ever need it. The belt really completed the look. I'm about 5'8 and it comes down to my feet. I wear it with heels though so it works out great. Love it overall.
5.0,I love it. It’s sooo soft and perfect for head wrap styles.
5.0,The fabric was good quality.  I was expecting something cheap looking.  Perfect for our 20s NEW Years party!
5.0,Good quality and arrived swiftly.
5.0,I love these socks! Exactly what I was wanting!
5.0,"loved these for my 5 year old niece!!!!  real, non-scuffing boots to wear for church or play!  She said they were her favorite present for her cowgirl birthday theme party!!!"
5.0,This was a gift fom my grandson.  For Christmas.  This is his favorite  soccer player. So this gift was a big hit.
5.0,Great look & nice price. Adjusts to desired length and stays there.
5.0,Okay sandels
5.0,Works great for me as an EMR belt bag.
5.0,"This is the cutest, easiest tee I've ever tried on. So so so soft, forgivingly fitted... hides the flabby bits beautifully. It's perfect.<br /><br />I am usually a dress size 10. I am 5'6&quot;, weigh 144lbs, and have a 36DD bust. The medium fits perfectly."
5.0,This product is super cute. They were easy to adjust. The design is clean and pretty. They very good quality.
5.0,"Beautiful watch. Keeps great time, and the best lume I’ve ever seen on a watch. Lume stays strong upwards of 8-10 hours."
5.0,"This thing is perfect. I bought one in Rose and it was WAY softer than I expected. I almost jumped on and wrote a review then but I figured I needed to wash it first before I give it 5 stars. But sure enough, it's still JUST as soft after washing so I ordered in green and blue too. I will be living in these this winter. It's perfect by itself or over a Tshirt or base layer. My 19yo daughter complimented me on how flattering the curved hem is. Love the longer sleeve length so when I use the thumb holes it doesn't feel stretched out. Love the front pocket too. It's roomy but dont expect it to hold things if you lay down. Also I don't love hoodies usually because of the weight and 'pull' of the extra fabric around my neck - not an issue with this one. The fabric is lightweight enough that it doesn't pull the neck part back."
5.0,Love this dress and is a good fit if your like me and a bit overweight.
5.0,"Exceptionally well made.  The back has two pins, one for the clutch, the other keeps the pin in place preventing it from tilting."
5.0,I ordered one size larger and they are just a little bit big
5.0,The pumpkins on the shirt are upside down.  I ordered a large I want to send back for a medium.  How can I be sure the pumpkins are upright like the picture and not upside down?
5.0,FAST shipping and my boyfriend loved it!
5.0,It delivered on the early end of expected date... which was perfect.  I had a party to go to and wanted them for that.<br />Finished my outfit!! Fit is good with plenty of room to keep my rings on.
5.0,"Compression ✅️<br />Lift ✅️<br />Breathable somehow but thick and comfy at the same time ✅️<br />Back and body support, helped with misaligned spine! ✅️✅️✅️✅️✅️✅️✅️🤗<br />  Thank you, definitely recommend and want more!  Also great post-surgery/recovery gear. If there is a way to be notified of more sizes in stock, I gotta know when!"
5.0,"Tight around your face but not tight directly on you mouth. After some trial and error I found a mask that is comfortable. The ear adjustments helped and I really really like that it does not touch my mouth, it makes talking less bothersome and I dont feel like I am suffocating. I wish they had more patterns."
5.0,My daughter loves the glasses
5.0,Very nicely made. I plan on saving these (I bought 2) for my granddaughters.
5.0,"sister wanted this bc she thought it was just a plushie, got it and it had a mirror, it’s good if that’s what u want but not what she wanted lol"
5.0,"I love this brand. They fit great, wash up great have come in a variety of colors and patterns. I get a new pair every year to treat myself. They hold up well, but I just like a new pattern each year."
5.0,"This spaghetti strap sundress is my current favorite dress. It is super comfortable with a lightweight and flowy feel. The coral/peach color is beautiful and has received compliments every time I've worn it! I wear it solo or with leggings, and it looks beautiful either way. It washes and drys in my regular cycles with no issue. It fits true to size. The length is roughly mid thigh. I'm 5'4. This dress is cute to wear to the pool/beach, mall, or out to dinner. Its quite versatile and my new favorite summer dress.<br />I received this item at a discount for my honest review."
5.0,"I love it, it fit perfect. I will highly recommend this to anyone. Good material too"
5.0,"I LOVE this bag, I wanted a small crossbody bag to carry just my cell, credit cards, id and maybe some gum or lipstick, just a few items.  This is perfect!  Love the blue plaid print. Material feels like a raincoat material, seems strong. A few weeks after I ordered the first bag, one of the clasps for the detachable strap broke. I messaged the seller and they responded right away.  They offered me a full refund or replacement bag. I chose a new bag - I love it. They were so helpful and sent me a new bag, again, right away!  Didn't even ask for the old bag. They also said they would report the quality issue to the factory so they could update the clasps in the future. Hopefully the new bag won't break, but this was handled perfectly!!  I will probably order this bag in other prints!"
5.0,I absolutely love this outfit. I got so many compliments. Fit just right I bought an extra large I am 5’7 at 165 pounds
5.0,"My daughter is always cold, she wears it all the time and is comfortable. Happy family, good buy!"
5.0,"I will not palter, but the jacket was not put on yet. Bought for growth. And till winter still far. Taking into account our dimensions and speed of an increase of weight and growth of newborns in the first year of life it is sure that will fit by winter.<br />Looks fantastically. Warm. Gentle coloring. Convenient fastener.<br />Good goods"
5.0,"Love em, well made! Color is very bright!"
5.0,"These sterling silver earrings are just the right size, not too big and not too small. The heart that hangs off of the earring can be worn either side. One side has scroll work which is very pretty. The other side has diamond accents that really sparkle, very eye catchiing! Definately worth every penny, Love them!!"
5.0,Beautiful bow! Just what I was looking for
5.0,They match my helmet and shoes for cycling and are seriously &#34; on point&#34; for eye protection while riding and being stylish at the same time.
5.0,PERFECT dress! Love how it fits and everything! Fabric is lovely and so comfortable- will order more in different colors!!
5.0,The weird smell wore off quickly. I'm still getting used to the height but they're wicked comfortable. Love them!
5.0,good quality and great choice of colors
5.0,Blends in very well with rose gold watch .. pink sand !
5.0,I love “Next Level” t-shirts. They are just so well made and fit very comfortably.
5.0,I literally have like 50+ of these tanks in all colors- mostly black. They hardly fade even after washing 10 times!!  and they are great to wear to the gym or as under tops
5.0,pretty stylish
5.0,My husband loves these Sun glasses..  very comfortable and great sun protection.. They look great on too..worth the money...
5.0,"This is a lovely kimono. The fabric is a silky polyester chiffon that drapes beautifully, floating over the body. It can be worn to dress up basic jeans, leggings, or a dress. It would also work as a nice bathing suit cover-up or a robe, although there is no belt, so if you want a more traditional closure you will have to supply it yourself. My daughter has been enjoying just wearing it around the house while she relaxes. She wears a 10 or 12 and is 5'5"", and the kimono hits mid-calf."
5.0,"I have been searching for a long time to find the perfect leggings and these are it. They have great compression, are buttery soft, and make your booty look gooood. The first time I wore these in front of my boyfriend he asked if they were lulu lemon. Buy these pants! I'm 5'3 115 lb and an XS fit perfectly."
5.0,Good value !!
5.0,"Love it! It is a little bit sheer to wear in public without another layer under or over it. Super soft and very comfortable! I bought it to use as a lounge dress and couldn't be happier.  I read in the comments that it runs a little large so I bought it one size smaller than I usually buy, and it is perfect. Loose, soft, and comfy."
5.0,Good prouct
5.0,This is a beautiful ear cuff. The second one I purchased.  Will purchase from this company again!
5.0,"Fits great. Love the print. Any Star wars fan will be happy sleeping in these bad boys. Very breathable and made of cotton. No shrinkage after washing and drying, which is good. Overall very satisfied and would totally buy these again, or other pairs if they had more prints!"
5.0,Cute top. I get lots of compliments. The swing tunics are great for a plus sized woman like me. I’m pretty tall 5’10” and hits me mid thigh. Great look paired with leggings.
5.0,Loved the dress! Very light and comfortable. Fits perfectly. Very satisfied with the purchase. Should see if it would still remain this good after washing.
5.0,"Beautiful! Used as part of my daughter’s congratulations basket for being accepted to University of TN, Knoxville."
5.0,Such a comfortable sweater. Great quality and stylish
5.0,Perfect for my baby BUG!
5.0,"I bought this bag instead of giving in to buying a fanny pack for a trip to Disneyland. It was wonderful! The seam at the strap is starting to tear, but it was put through a lot between myself and my husband. It’s gender neutral so a man or woman could absolutely tote this around."
5.0,So pretty and just what I needed!
5.0,"Nice shirt, comes true to size and it has a really cool/cute retro look to it!  I really like it because it looks like a Ladies shirt when it's on- not like a dyed man's long underwear!!  It's a nice thermal, perfect for these never ending cold days of winter, good to layer under and over!"
5.0,"Nice pair of shades. Great durability, nice look, seamless fade from top to bottom; it was a tad tight on my head seeing that mine is a bit larger than the average. It really is the whole package. Extremely versatile, I use them casually and dress-wise depending on how I feel. Cool aesthetic too. I receive countless complements every time I throw them on."
5.0,Le quedo bien aunque un poco grande
5.0,I work on a truck dock. I need fingerless to write etc. These are the warmest fingerless gloves ever! If fingertips get cold  I start walking and swinging my arms and/or put hands in my coat pocket. This is the second pair I bought. They can take a beating too!
5.0,"Love this dress! It's cute, with a touch of sassy! I got compliments all day. It fits my figure as expected. I ordered true to the size guide. No complaints at all!"
5.0,Fits perfect and stays on unlike some others I've tried
5.0,"This item is very high quality! Highly recommend, and plan to purchase more. Very nice..."
5.0,"This came in a very nice box, with a selenite charging stone. The clear quartz bracelet is super pretty. I’m very satisfied with this purchase"
5.0,"looks very nice for my friend and she really likes this sunglasses, and it's very cheap cost-effective product."
5.0,"my boyfriend didn’t think a medium would fit because he usually goes for a large, but the medium fit perfect! definitely a looser fit, but is as advertised!"
5.0,These are some unique sunglasses... I have never owned a pair of floating sunglasses before nor did I even know they existed... These come in very handy for the water lover... I go on the lake quite often in the summer for boating and swimming... I had the opportunity to go up to the northern part of Michigan last weekend and was able to really give these glasses a once over... Spent four days on the lake and being out in the sun all day wearing sunglasses can cause a headache for me... I noticed that I wasn't even aware that I even had sunglasses on all day as they are so light you don't even feel them on your face... I also put them on the lake water to see if they floated or not and they floated very well and that is a nice feature if you accidentally  dropped them... I like the lenses (you can put these sunglasses right back on completely  wet and the visual integrity isn't distorted at all) the UV protection is outstanding as I never noticed any blurring or haziness after taking them off... These are also very stylish and sexy might I add... I really like these sunglasses and recommend them to anyone who is out on the water or anyone who wants a quality pair of protective lightweight sunglasses...<br /><br />I received at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
5.0,Just what I was looking for! Worth!

5.0,Watch is a good price.  Appearance is great.  Keeps good time.  Overall a good watch.
5.0,"These are very nice quality.  The metal is thin, but not so thin that it will easily bend.  Due to the fact that they are made of aluminum, I expect them to get scratched with use, but they were perfect when they arrived!  I was looking for an anniversary gift for my husband who does not like &#34;fru fru&#34; stuff and these are perfect!"
5.0,"Great shoe and value . Can’t wait to take them on trip . Was looking for something lightweight for hiking/walking/bicycle. These are it . I can’t stand my feet in closed toes and go barefoot or flips everywhere. These feel like I am barefoot and don’t have to feel constricted in normal running/workout shoes.<br /><br />Update : took on trip to South of France . Wore every where . Great walking /hiking/bicycle/beach shoe . So comfortable, no blisters being brand new . I where them now for dogs walks along the beach at home and bicycle rides ."

5.0,Very comfortable! Love this dress.

5.0,Igual que en la foto!
5.0,"I don't think I could hike the full Appalachian Trail, I couldn't carry all the supplies I need. Plus, I get headaches when I get hungry so I wouldn't make it. But at least I got the hat and it fits really good. I feel like a  park ranger though with that round patch on the side."
5.0,I love how this band dresses up my not very pretty watch. The directions show you how to easily take out links to make the band fit your wrist. Love it.

5.0,"Loved it, only it was small."
5.0,"Wow! I was shocked when I open the package to see the quality and comfort of this turtleneck sweater. It is heavier than I expected, softer than I expected, and extremely comfortable. The fit is as expected. I normally wear a medium, and this medium fits perfect. The color is beautiful. I can’t believe the price that I got this sweater. I have another one in burgundy, arriving in a few days, and I’m excited to see that."
5.0,Big and confortable bag.
5.0,I wish these came in a three pack at a value.
5.0,"for the money, you cannot beat this watch. I wear mine daily, and never had an issue."
5.0,"Beautiful and delicate, but well made. I can't wear pierced earrings anymore and I'm always looking for not-pierced options. I have purchased these in grey and green and they've been a great dangly addition to several looks."
5.0,Super cute! Took awhile to get here. Coming from China is my guess.

5.0,"Pleasantly surprised with quality of this belt, is roughly the same quality and construction as one I picked up in a leather shop in Italy but paid a bit more for.  Always a gamble for the color match online but it is a deep navy and matches my loafers perfectly."
5.0,This is such a great replica of the necklace from the show… Really made my costume pop!
5.0,Great sturdy bags. Love that they told up and have a pouch to put them in so they aren't just all over my car trunk.

5.0,Beautiful.  Very well made. I have received many complaints  or this piece
5.0,"Small and dainty, great buy."
5.0,"These were a bit thicker, softer and better quality than I was expecting. The fabric has just enough stretch elastic mix, the design is nicely detailed (dark gray background, light and dark color cream illustrates the ""skeletons""). Perfect for any dinosaur or paleontology buff."
5.0,"Normally long socks are itchy, or don't stay up properly. These socks have neither problem. They fit comfortably just over the knee, stay put all day, and are not itchy at all. Even after being worn and washed several times, they keep their color and texture. These are my favorite thigh-highs, and I'm ordering more from the same company."
5.0,These are much bigger then another pair I bought from a different seller. They were not  in a box so when I opened them I was hoping there was no damages. Luckily there was no damage so I'm happy.  Really cute glasses  def will order them in silver. I got the rose gold ones
5.0,"For the price, this ear cuff is a deal.  I had been looking for a while for a cuff, but had not found one that I like.  I found this one on Amazon and am glad I did.  It is well made and attractive.  It clips on the ear easily.  The material is thin, so if you have to bend it to fit your ear, do it slowly and gently.  I would recommend this ear cuff to anyone.  The package arrived at my house in 3 days from date of order.  Impressive."
5.0,The costume fits well a 6 yo.<br />The gloves are big but the rest is perfect.
5.0,I have a friend addicted to ketchup and she loved the shirt.  Said it fit great and everything

5.0,My son loves it and I added it to his fortnite collection. It’s not very loud (which is a plus for me) but you can still hear it 😁
5.0,"Size up. Runs a little smaller than normal so order the next size up. Stylish and comfortable, was a surprise for the wife and she was happy. Will order more in future. Thanks."
5.0,For the money not a bad pair glasses. We truly do get what you pay for but these look good and do the job.
5.0,beauiful-perfect size

5.0,Very sturdy and good price.
5.0,Clutch came in sooner than I expected because it said it would take about 17 days but it really took about a week and a half for it to be delivered. The size is PERFECT! it even has a strap that comes with it if you would like to wear it on your shoulders. For the price I paid I am very much satisfied!
5.0,"I really like this skirt. I was a little leary at first with it being a pencil skirt, Asian made. But I have big, pretty legs and with my ankle heeled sandals a good match!  I am a 12/14 and purchased xl."
5.0,"I bought these for my husband...I actually got him a pair for Christmas and he liked them so much, I bought him two more pair for his birthday. He LOVES them. His feet are cold all the time and he says these keep him warmer than any other socks he has."

5.0,Used this on my Birkenstocks and goes on white but dries clear. Perfect to freshen up your cork on your Birkenstocks
5.0,These are worth the money!  Most bands slip off my head.  These stay put!!  I have the thicker band but these are thinner in width & will be buying more!  Highly recommended!
5.0,Esta fresca y comoda pero un poco grande
5.0,These are thee most adorable and quality sandals. The leather is great and the style is even better looking in person than the advertisement! I adore these sandals!
5.0,"This ring is stunning. Looks more like a more expensive ring that it really is. Yes, it is small so I wouldn't personally recommend it for someone with larger hands/fingers. In dark lighting it appears to be a deep gray shade but in natural lighting or brighter indoor lighting, it shimmers green an purple, absolutely beautiful. The cubic zirconium side stones are dainty and shimmer with perfection. It's a must have."
5.0,It was a great gift for my nephew to wear on his high school graduation.  He had a little bit of his dad to wear on his special day to walk along him.
5.0,Great clutch purse!  My android phone fits perfect and it's classic Coach!
5.0,"The blouse is absolutely beautiful. I read some of your reviews which stated that it ran small.  Very True!  But, I liked it so much when I saw it, I had to have one.  I usually wear a Medium US size, so, I ordered a 2XL  size, and it fits perfectly. So, comfortable."

5.0,Perfect reusable gift bags for girls trip weekend. They were a huge hit!
5.0,So much better than wrestling with panty hose!
5.0,Very nice use them everyday!
5.0,cute jacket for little superman lovers
5.0,"I bought these for a trip to Europe in January. We were very lucky and the weather was generally too warm for gloves, but on the few occasions when I needed them these were perfect. They were thin and didn't take up a lot of room in my pockets, easy to get on without a struggle, but warm, and had good enough dexterity for me to use my phone with them on. Sometimes it took more than one tap on the phone to get a response, but I figured out pretty quickly the right angle to make the fingertips work on the touchscreen. I did originally order the medium, and they were okay, but the fingers were just a bit short. The large was perfect - long enough, but not sloppy. I would buy these again!"
5.0,"Good purchase, fast shipment"
5.0,They are a little bit bigger than I expected
5.0,Nice product and packaging.  Good value.
5.0,Tons of compliments. Fits as expected. Great quality.

5.0,Beautiful dress! Bought it for my trip to Mexico. It was a little long for me in the front since I’m only 5’3 and I was wearing it with flat sandals. I’m sure heels would make the length perfect.
5.0,These are great for wearing under pants.  The high waist line is really comfortable and does not roll down.  You get what you pay for.. if you bang around outside in them (like I do) they will snag.  But these are super comfy
5.0,Beautiful dress. Quality
5.0,"Oooh, Pretty!  For $2.70, these are a great buy and comparable to department store costume jewelry.  The earrings are an inch long, the enamel was bright and well-painted, and the rhinestones are actually big enough to see!  The earring backs are the combined hard plastic-metal backs meant to provide a firm backing for heavier earrings so they don't droop.  That said, these don't seem too heavy to be comfortable.  I'll be wearing these often, and I wouldn't hesitate to give them as gifts.<br />I received absolutely no compensation for this review."
5.0,"Just an inexpensive watch for work - nice in appearance, works well"
5.0,I displayed it inside my truck
5.0,I love the color and the fit I’m a Medium and it fits perfect
5.0,My husband love it’s hat. He like to wear hats and finds this one as a good summer hat.
5.0,Cute design.  Fits my son well.
5.0,"Mask is thin, but is of soft fabric. Very pretty. Washed well, hang dried."
5.0,I was searching for a nice black handbag and bingo found this one. Absolutely love it.  It is the perfect size and holds everything without falling over.  Has lots of pockets for carrying things neatly.  Also is quite light weight so it does not feel to heavy once you put your things in it.
5.0,"I love this bag it's small but really neat looking, and made well. I'll be using it for my bus trip to Florida for things like my headsets, camera, i.d. n credit cards. It has secret pocket on back of it perfect. There isn't really anything I didn't like"
5.0,Love the dress. Perfect to make a special statement. Fit great in the shoulders and nice a line frame.
5.0,Washable comes out nice and soft. Love the feel. Warm and Pretty
5.0,"Super fast shipping and a great product! My daughter had been having some pain and redness with her current nose ring and when she put this one in, the redness and pain went away within a day!"
5.0,Unique lace with lovely ruffle cuff. Little finger is a bit long but it's not really noticeable. If you can't get that manicure in time you can grab these lovely gloves and dress in style. Shipped promptly.
5.0,"Amazing socks for long trips. These do not pinch your toes, yet they do exactly as they should on your legs. The PDF was helpful if you've never worn this type of sock before. As a frequent traveler, I will be purchasing another pair. Definitely worth having. As an aside, the customer service from this company is fantastic."
5.0,This was made well and a great item to personalize!
5.0,Just like I remember in the olden days!!
5.0,"Absolutely love bragard aprons, I used them when I worked for TK and had been missing them since, honestly best aprons in the market."
5.0,"I’m a swim coach for young kids & sometimes I have to get in the pool with them. We swim outdoor year round, so I got this to keep me warm in the water/air. Pool is heated, but air temp in cold. I tried it out the other day, so far so good. I usually wear Ladies M, I’m small chested, athletic build. Glad I got the 2xl (size 10) fits well, snug."
5.0,"I ordered a Medium. I am 5’8, long torso, short legs for my height, 145lbs, 36C. It fits great! It hits right at me knees, not too revealing in the bust either. It’s a little loose in the chest/waist, but I think having the length be perfect is a great trade off! I ordered the red and it is very pretty!"
5.0,A lot of positive feedback. Friends like it.
5.0,"GREAT PRODUCT!<br />I received these Sock Snaps as a gift with some new socks. Ingenious product.  Very easy to install (JUST READ THE INSTRUCTION) super simple and they actually work great. The first load of wash we did with my Socks with Sock Snaps my wife and I both ran to the dryer to see if the socks actually stayed together and I have to say we were both amazed, they did. I give this product a 2 thumbs up 👍👍. I would highly recommend them. Saves you a lot of time."
5.0,"I got these as a baselayer for sub zero temperatures. Since the weather is warm right now I can't say exactly how they will do but I think they will definitely be keeping me warm! The fleece lining is very soft and the waist band has a double layer of fabric. At first I thought the double layer would be too bulky and annoying but I was wrong! These are so comfortable! Just the right amount of stretch. They are thick but not so thick that I won't be able to wear them under ski pants or other cold weather gear outdoors. I think they will also be great for lounging when its chilly or for working out in cold temperatures as well. Theses are full length leggings. I am only 5'2"" so they did bunch around my ankles"
5.0,I love love this shirt. Perfect to west with leggings and boots. It’s so comfortable and flattering.
5.0,It is hi/low blouse like I like it.  I purchased the blue and black one.  I wear with pants and long skirts.

5.0,Got this for my mother and she loves them
5.0,I ordered a xl and should of ordered a large but other than that really satisfied
5.0,These goggles easily fit an adult or large child. They work well underwater. You can see clearly without water interfering. These are awesome!
5.0,Wonderful purse and strap is long enough for even us plus size gals to use as cross body purse.
5.0,"Took a bit to get this locked onto our trailer tire (auto tire), but it's secure and so far a great deterrent."
5.0,My 2.5 year old granddaughter loves it.  Especially the matching hair ribbon.
5.0,Good quality and perfect size for my daughter
5.0,"I really like these gloves.  I bought them for riding my motorcycle during the colder months.  I've used them on several rides were the temps were in the 30's and 40's  The do a good job of keeping my fingers from getting cold, and work even better if I put the grip warmers on.  Gloves are well made, and fit nicely and are comfortable.  They are not too thick or stiff and don't slip on the handlebar grips.  Great gloves for the price"
5.0,My last name is fox and I substitute at elementary schools. They get a kick out of the foxes eating doughnuts and cake on the lanyard. It is soft and doesn’t irritate my neck or make it hot. I love it🦊💕
5.0,So nice. They can with there own case. Look good with my glasses. Just happy I can wear them and drive without the sun in my eyes.
5.0,I love it... it's just too big
5.0,"Works perfectly with Sharon Raw helmet at a much lower price than OEM replacement goggles. Only gripe is that the strap frays easily. Other than that, very good shade from bright sunlight, no distortion, and fits well."
5.0,"Perfect and comfortable fit, love this top!"
5.0,Great material with beautifully large printed cherries.  The fabric is nice and soft and the dress is puffy on the bottom which makes it so cute!
5.0,"Best glasses: I use them all day for work. They are comfortable, well made, light weight: and roughly 1/4 of what the computer glasses cost at my optometrist"
5.0,I absolutely love this house dress! It's soft and fits perfectly.
5.0,Great dress as expected
5.0,My boy bought and loves! Really detailed.
5.0,I bought please for a gift and she loved them but they do run pretty large
5.0,"Looks just like the picture, my boyfriend thought it was super cute and thoughtful!"
5.0,Pretty skeptical about this purchase. I was pleasantly surprised. Very light came with solid case and screwdriver. I am about to order another color now. Really impressing the clarity of the lenses. You can’t beat it for the price.
5.0,Soft and comfortable. I ordered another set
5.0,"These are really cute punk earrings. I love them, they look so good and are pretty eye catching. Easy to put in and take out, these clean easily as well. I'd recommend!"

5.0,Very classy looking!
5.0,Loved this umbrella while we had it until it was stolen.

5.0,Daughter and both have one. We love it
5.0,"This dress is absolutely beautiful! The colors are very vibrant. I were this on my recent vacation to Cuba, I received many compliments. The material stretches and it's breathable. It's fits true to size."
5.0,Nice shirt although there shipping was ridiculous if you want it before months from now.

5.0,"Beautiful dress, super comfy (="
5.0,Granddaughter really loved them I say loved in past tense because she has literally wore them out and they had to be trashed with out her knowing.
5.0,GO HAWKS!!
5.0,The shoes didn’t take anytime to break it which was great. They are exactly as pictured.
5.0,"This is a great “little black dress” for very cheap.  I don’t go out often so I don’t wanna spend a bunch money on something I may only wear once.  I love the dress- it fits well. The material clings so it will show your figure, but it’s not too tight.  I will say that on me it’s a tad big in the boob area, and I do have a well sized bust.  That being said it’s not enough  of a negative to take away a star. It is on the short side, very sexy, & ends at my fingertips.  My boyfriend loved it on me."
5.0,Fit was great and higher quality than expected! Great find! Would highly recommend!
5.0,These were a Christmas gift to my mother. A bit on the small side but my mom loved them!

5.0,"Third pair, uber comfortable. Like the last 2, a little big around the waist. Will buy again!"
5.0,"I was looking for some heavier weight gripper socks.  My husband is in a SNF, recovering from a spinal cord injury and his feet were getting cold with the usual weight of gripper socks.  I found these and they are perfect.  They are soft, fit well on his size 11 feet.  They were such a hit, they have all disappeared in the facilities laundry!  Have to buy some more!"
5.0,I bought this to put golf balls in. Keeps them in one place in my golf bag rather than having balls everywhere. Works great. Sturdy and well made.
5.0,"Perfect, comfortable shoe. Good for walking."

5.0,perfect for my 6 month old baby they are so soft and warm and just the right size
5.0,"Very cute and fit was perfect for both my children, shoe size 11 and 13"
5.0,Very nice and ruggedly built.  Fits a Kimber Pro Crimson Carry II in a conceal-carry holster with no problem.  Bought this to replace a backpack.
5.0,I wear size 4 (sometimes 6) pants and the size small fit perfectly. I’m pretty short (5’3”) so it didn’t look obscenely short on me either. The coloring was a little lighter than expected near the bottom but that’s no big deal
5.0,Excelente vendendor
5.0,Love this bathing suit. Thinking about order more.
5.0,"The hat I received was the black, white, gray pattern. I love it. It is easy to adjust and is well made. The fabric is polyester.  I am not a hat person but I do like this one because it doesn't cover the entire head."

5.0,Dress is beautiful an fits perfectly
5.0,This dress just arrived and I couldn't be happier! The fabric feels soft with a little stretch and the dress is very comfortable. The colors are vibrant and the print is gorgeous. I'll be taking it to Las Vegas this July and I know I won't be overly hot while wearing it. I'm 5' 7&#34; and 169 lbs. I purchased the X-Large as my bust is a 42C and the fit is just right (not too big in the waist or hips). It definitely hugs all your curves!
5.0,I livd these glasses so much i bought 2 pairs but now i wish i would have gotten 8 more pairs

5.0,I absolutely love this top. Feels so soft and washes really well.
5.0,Love the different rings!

5.0,"Got purchased items.  They seem to be ok, haven’t used yet, but will serve the purpose intended.  Thank you!"

5.0,"Luv this dress! Perfect fit and VERY nice quality!  I'm 5'4-3/4, weigh 125 lbs."
5.0,"Pleasantly surprised with how well this set fit me. Super cute. The shirt is shorter than I thought,  its a crop top, i thought it was full length, though I still like it.<br /><br />Edit to add: its been a few months, Im pregnant now and these shorts are my second favorite to wear to bed. Im 7 months along and they just keep fitting, i love them. They arent too constricting and most of my other pjs are. I would add another star if I could lol"
5.0,"Very cute, wish there was a little more support or material on the top, but its flattering and nice material."
5.0,The recipient was thrilled.  They are a very nice quality.

5.0,It’s ok nice dress
5.0,These compression socks are very comfortable. I hate to take them off.
5.0,I like the product because of its' comfort for wearing all day.
5.0,"Have had this dress >1 year, worn multiple times. Of the many look-alikes that Chinese & off-US-shore brands make, this is a good one. Was made w/ good workmanship & my material is a good weight, not see-thru (am assuming different fabric may have different materials - mine is the teal/coral/etc/ patterned). Cotton or rayon & some spandex, which is important for swinginess! icing correct, the dress might lean toward the larger end of stated size range. For the price, well worth it."
5.0,This jacket is beautiful.  The leather is superior.  The customer service is excellent.  This jacket did not look good on me so I returned it.
5.0,"Love these jeans.  I had them taken up just a hair, which was no problem, but they are excellent and stylish additions to anyone's wardrobe."
5.0,I have bought several of these and they are my favorite under shirts in comparison to the old school style. Definitely a must try if you have not.
5.0,This is the cutest Calendar!  It has large date blocks where I can add appointments and notes.
5.0,Order a size or 2 up. The neck I did not like it's like an actual tshirt neck so I just cut it into a vneck
5.0,"Me encantó, pedi un M tengo 180 lbs y mido 5,9, no es transparente  buena tela"
5.0,Read headline

5.0,Bought it for my son for St. Patrick's Day. He loved it. Nice set for the price!
5.0,"Since buying nylon stretchy bands, I don’t think I can ever go back to the original bands. Those would always leave my wrist feeling itchy and uncomfortable after a day wearing them. With these bands, I find that I have to keep checking that I am in fact wearing my watch because they are that comfortable!"
5.0,"Cute pendant, just a little larger than what I was thinking."
5.0,These joggers are great. They are soft and the elastic waistband is very comfortable. I am 5’ 6” and 165lbs and the large size fit perfectly. I’ll probably buy another pair in a different color.
5.0,Really hate I didn't upload a picture because the picture doesn't do this hat justice.  I wore it and got lots of compliments.  Its nice and soft and looks amazing on long hair or short.  It gives you a retro fashionista look.  I paired mine with a long semi curly wig the big ear rings AMAZING!  If you're familiar with the Fugees I thought I was Lauryn Hill!
5.0,very comfortable a little tight in the toe area but not enough to send them back.
5.0,As described! would order again
5.0,"Arrived early than expected.<br /><br />There's no instruction though,<br />I found this on google-<br />Method 1- Open your phone camera<br />Align the convex surface of the pendant<br />You'll see the ""i love you"" languanges<br /><br />Method 2- Turn on the flash light of your phone or any flash light will do<br />Align the flat surface of the pendant<br />Project light shadows onto a white/black background<br />You'll see the ""i love you"" languages BUT inverted<br /><br />Overall, it's worth it. 👍👍👍👍👍"
5.0,"This turtleneck fits well and feels good. In addition, it is quite lovely to look at. Lycanslady is an excellent seller,  so I will be sure to make my future turtleneck purchases from their Amazon store."

5.0,"These masks are incredible.  They are so soft and comfortable.  They seem a bit thick at first, but that extra cushioning just adds to the comfort factor, it in no way affects the breathability.  The satin-type fabric is very pretty and makes them a little more dressy than the typical everyday mask.  I love them!"
5.0,Love my keychains! Thank you for fast delivery!
5.0,Loved the fit and the color

5.0,Purchased these to wear at Roaring 20s themed party. They worked and looked great. Two thumbs up!!

5.0,My granddaughter loves them. It did had a strong plastic order but I left them outside over night and they were fine.
5.0,"My husband was looking for a new belt and prefers canvas belts since the cheaper ""leather"" belts often crack, and the belts with holes aren't as adjustable. I got the Black/B699 style and it looks even nicer in person. The belt itself is a thick and durable canvas with finished edges so no worries about fraying. And the buckle is sturdy and well made. He's really pleased with this belt so high recommendation from him!"
5.0,Love this bag!  Just got back for a vacation and it was the perfect size to fit things for a carry-on.
5.0,Very pretty wore with a blue Jean jacket
5.0,"I love love it, at first I wasn’t sure if I should get only because I was scared it would be too tight or smelly. But NO! is a comfortable barely doesn’t feel like you wearing it sometimes. I even work out with it and it doesn’t get smelly, I do sweat a lot when I work out and was also scared of the smell being problem. I love it, get them, and is true to size and color! is worth the price."
5.0,"This shirt is everything I was hoping it would be. I'm the kind of person that is super picky about how t-shirts fit and I hate the ""soft cotton"" or 50/50 blends. I love the heavy cotton material that Carhartt is known for and this shirt fit perfectly. I am between a 3x and 4x right now and got the 4x. The short sleeves are not stretched out or too baggy. They go to my elbows which is what I wanted and the length after washing and drying was nearly perfect. It could be about a half inch shorter in length and it would be perfect but it's pretty dang close. I will order more Carhartt relaxed fit heavyweight shirts in the future."
5.0,"I love it, most beautiful bag, I wish I ordered a wallet immediately.  I suppose you know what I'm going to do next?  You bet."
5.0,"I gave this as a gift to a graduate. When I came in at look to be of nice quality and the grad's mom told me he really liked it and was currently wearing it. If there's a problem later I can update, but for now it seems to be a good product."
5.0,Very comfortable and fits me perfectly!  I’ll be ordering more!
5.0,Snap back so size is adjustable. Logo is screen printed on so will it last long term? TBD. But looks good. Cheap as you’ll find price wise. I wear it often to support my club. #allezparis
5.0,"I sewed the patch on my blue and yellow scarf, and it works perfectly.  It’s a great way to show house pride."
5.0,I have got so many compliments on these. They are very cute and comfortable.
5.0,"Love It! Light weight- perfect for hot weather,  gives sun protection while outside orin the car driving."

5.0,So cute and keeps your things organized!
5.0,"When I purchase socks on Amazon, I've no luck. Each order seems to be two sizes too short. So ordered according to their size chart, several sizes up and it's still too short. Have no problem purchasing outside of Amazon-great socks. So I gave them to friends who told me they're warm, strong, very comfortable. Of course, they're microfiber socks. RECOMMEND: Buy a few but first contact the seller (I never did) about the sizing. The sizes seem to be for asian or European sizes."
5.0,shows off your curves
5.0,"30 year pipefiter, wearing a wedding ring is by an option. The rings are fantastic"
5.0,Cute & great bargain

5.0,Very lightweight jacket. Great for spring days.
5.0,My best friend and I are like peanut butter & jelly. These key chains are adorable and came well packaged. Great buy!
5.0,For my car keys! Since my Cars name is the BlACK WIDOW!
5.0,I'll add pictures later CUZ ITS SUPER CUTE but reading the reviews I was thinking it would be a little tight in the chest area and I would have to keep pulling it down and stuff but guess mine are just small enough (even tho I'm like a D cup lol) i thought it wouldn't fit honestly but I got the 5xl and it fit good just a little tight in the back of my chunk arms ha I can put it on without unzipping but needed someone to unzip it for me to get it off lol I didn't feel like I was gonna hulk out in it either LOL (like those clothes wear it feels like if you move or bent over they would rip) imma buy other colors hope someone reads this and buys it and likes it as much as I did. ❤✌

5.0,Works as described for the price seems worth it.
5.0,"I am 5'2&#34;, 126lbs (34-26-39) and ordered a small. The material is thick and very stretchy. I love my dresses to look painted on and this did exactly that. I am also wearing Spanx and a padded bra to give a clean look. I got a ton of compliments on the dress...the only caveat is there is no zipper and you need to slip this over your head and need to avoid the dreaded deodorant streaks."
5.0,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect, given the low price. However, I am very pleased. Good buy, the knitting is nice, and it fits well, without a clip (I do have short hair)."
5.0,Bought it for a friend who coaches soccer. She loved it. Good quality too.
5.0,"Me sorprendió la textura de la tela, esperaba que fuese más caliente, pero en verdad es bien fresca, me gusta más así, pedí talla L ya que mido 6,1"" y peso 230lb con un poco de músculos jajajaja, me encanta como queda."
5.0,I bought these becuz they matched the onesie that I bought for my gf. She loved them.

5.0,My Oma loved it
5.0,"These really are super soft! I'm 5'8"" and 180pds post partum. I can't fit in my pre-pregnancy clothes yet, so I needed some comfy leggings that are good for my height, cover the belly, and will last. These are perfect. Feel great and look great."
5.0,"It was a gift for someone that hikes, they liked it."
5.0,"These pants compare very favorably to my much more expensive Patagonia and Columbia Sportswear versions. I normally wear a 35 or 36 waist, and the large fit great. Unlike many hiking pants that are really big in the leg, these are tapered without being a really slim fit. Nice pockets with zippers on the rear which I really like. A lightweight fabric that drys quickly."
5.0,U would see a big difference !!
5.0,This dress was actually better than I expected for the price. The material was sturdy and it fit perfectly! The color matches the photo also.
5.0,Very cute socks! My 2 year old looks so cute with bubbles and dresses with these socks!

5.0,Holds in place even if it's not tied. Good quality.
5.0,this was for a wedding in October and I need it to be replaced with one that has white and black stripes instead of ivory and white stripes
5.0,"Throw away the clunky wooden or ugly plastic racks. These are better if you’re a serious player and they hold up well. If you’re having trouble with ball spacing, it’s user error. These work almost perfect if you’re beyond primate evolution. Cheers!"

5.0,"My husband  absolutely loves his rings. They both fit hit perfectly  and the color is just right, very nice rings."
5.0,I am glad I got the medium instead of a small because the medium fit perfectly.  It's a little thinner than I thought it would be but good for the summer months.
5.0,Its small but its adorable!!! It doesn't fit any water bottles but it can fit small snacks :D
5.0,I ordered a sz bigger and it’s still tight after a couple washes
5.0,Nice ribbons. We gave them to the Veterans at work.
5.0,Nice quality.  Good value
5.0,It looks 👌in my nose!
5.0,"Good quality,  beautiful fit."
5.0,Went with the Medium as I am 5'3&#34; 138 and a 34D.  They fit as expected.  They quality is really nice.  Plan on these to hold up for quite some time.  I do suggest washing them first there is a slight smell when first received.  That is due to the material and being packaged in a plastic bag.
5.0,Actually bought these to use when cleaning my pool tile and the water is freezing this time of year. I bought these purely because they were not bad reviews and cheap so I didn't hold to much hope but I have to say I am impressed. They are a fight to get into but once on they work okay and best of all they do not leak. So they are good for there use but still need to wear warmer clothing underneath to keep from freezing. Worth the price.
5.0,Just what I needed. I have a small pearl pendant that I got in Hawaii and I have broken the chain that went with it. I snagged this little gem and it has made for a great replacement. My only wish is that the clasp was a big larger (but the loop into the clasp is perfect size to fit in my pendant).
5.0,"Good price, well made and comfortable."
5.0,"I had been looking for a cheaper alternative to Nike and UA compression shorts. These are great. Fit well, feel great and are a great price. I compared my size to my Nike and UA compression shorts and they fit the same."
5.0,Love the glasses good price
5.0,The earrings are very small as I like them.  I have several holes in my ear and they are the perfect size to fit my small ear.  They are also lightweight so I don't even know I am wearing them.
5.0,Great quality! Shipped on time. I believe.
5.0,"I bought these for myself because every time I get a bonnet my daughter uses them. Well, she loves these the best. I will have to get a new set for myself 😂"
5.0,"I am a HUGE New Orleans Saints fan....and I have earrings that match this charm perfectly! I got the charm and put it on a silver chain to wear as a necklace.  I am very happy with the earrings, the chain and this charm....all purchased on AMAZON. I now have something new to show support of my favorite team. GEAUX SAINTS!"
5.0,Wire it while in Cabo
5.0,Great Item - keeps my saddle nice and moist.
5.0,"The vest is very handy in the winter. Got it for my brother in law and he loves it. The vest heats up within minutes, if not seconds. Its also adjustable in size so it makes it comfortable. Depending on the battery bank it last for a good while too."
5.0,Well made and fit perfect.
5.0,"My son wanted a fornite gaiter to wear for school. We had ordered one that was a little less expensive first and it never arrived. This one arrived on time and for well. I wanted the ear holes to help him keep it up. Yet he does tell me he has problems with eyeglasses fogging, and I think the traditional masks with metal over nose are a little easier to keep from fogging, but he cares more about wearing is fortnite gear lol."
5.0,"Very pretty dress, many compliments. It runs a little big but not to much, perfect for pregnancy. Very comfortable it’s a little long on me but I’m 5’3” so most dresses are even longer on me than this one. Good quality for price."
5.0,Bought it as a gift for my wife. She loves it. She receiveds lots of compliments and looks exactly as the image.
5.0,The dress is super cute but I got 1 size larger & so thankful I did or I would of returned it.
5.0,"This is a awesome necklace and looks so much more expensive than the price of $5.99 with Prime shipping.  The interwoven pearls with the gold bars is so striking, I really love this updated necklace design for pearls. It is so comfortable, you forget you have it on.  My neck is large and I use chain extenders so it fits as I want it to.<br />I can not fault anything about this necklace.<br />Recommend"
5.0,"Despite being a tad too large, these are really really nice and beautiful shoes! They get uncomfortable to wear after a little while but it's not that bad at all. So far I haven't seen any signs of wearing or falling apart that a few others have complained about but I'll update after a few months!"
5.0,"I love this belt, in fact, I bought another one so I could leave one in my everyday pants and never take it in or out! Plus I travel a ton so the 10% stretch makes it really comfy for plains, cars, shuttles, etc. The magnet doesn't set off a metal detector so I can keep my pants on while I go through TSA  security! Score for everyone."
5.0,"The t-shirt fits true to size and has a loose fit. The fabric is soft, stretchy and breathable. I love the contrast between maroon background and the black drawing. I am wearing it right now. So comfortable and just perfectly casual for every day."
5.0,"I loved the comfort, color, and style of this dress. This is a true to fit size dress and is perfect for  casual workday or going out for lunch with my friends. I’m very happy With my purchase 😊"
5.0,"Absolutely perfect. Great quality and fit and my little girl looks so adorable. My daughter is 22 months, wearing mostly 3t clothing and the size 3 fits great. Highly recommend"
5.0,I cut the fingers off and wore them during a spartan race. Great grip. Comfy and durable.
5.0,This wallet exceeded my expectations. The quality is outstanding considering the low price. It hold all of my cards perfectly. Its cute & compact. I have been using it daily for almost a month. I will reorder in different colors because its hard to find a wallet that fits all of my cards! lol It did take awhile for shipping but coming from overseas its understandable. It did however arrive earlier than ecpected.
5.0,Great value for its price! The gi itself is soft which is such a relief!
5.0,The ring is very will made very happy with it.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:5ae3d3888b387da95be1dedf07efd6d7]] Super stetchy thin material. I love how this is shaped to fit my curves and not just a rectangle, great for my wide hips. I ordered the red and it is fire engine red, definitely draws attention. At 5'4 it hits below the knees, so it's not short."
5.0,"I actually really LOVE this dress. The detail on the bottom had a small rip in the pattern, but is easily fixed with some black thread and definitely worth keeping the dress. I feel like I could throw this on really quick to go to the store or wear it to a funeral."
5.0,Just had cataract surgery and these are the Best!  I have owned Vaurnets in the past and the one thing that sets them apart is color crispness and glare reduction.  Perfect sunnies!
5.0,"Perfect for my 7 year old. She can start and stop the stop watch, switch to military time, read the time and date. She loves it, especially the light button.  It’s as expected, and just what we were looking for."
5.0,This chain is really very nice but I didn't realize it's only 1mm which is very fine. This would be good for a silver charm or to wear plain.
5.0,My husband loves these socks.
5.0,"I love this costume, and so do all my friends! The Nightmare Before Christmas is my favorite movie, so this was the perfect thing to wear! You will love it too!"
5.0,"I don’t know why it’s so hard for me to find shorts.  I want ones that fall at or just below the knee.  The material should be thick enough I don’t feel like my manhood is sticking out on display.  I don’t want crazy colors or designs or giant logos drawing attention.  These fit my requirements perfectly at a very affordable price and the quality seems good, I will definitely buy a couple more pair in different color"
5.0,This outright is very cute with vibrant colors; I love Carter’s!!!
5.0,"So comfy and lightweight, plus it has pockets! I do recommend steaming it after washing due to it “shrinking” from wrinkling in the wash. Doesn’t actually shrink"
5.0,"had this product for a while now and wear everyday, from swimming to hiking all summer long. have yet to fade haven't lost one, sturdy back. excellent product"
5.0,Soft. Machine washes and dries well.
5.0,Perfect fit.  High Quality material.
5.0,So adorable!! Perfect for my little girl on Christmas. Very well made.
5.0,I got for my daughters 3rd birthday.  She is average build (55-60% according to the docs) and I read other reviews and got a size up for her. It fits but I know it won’t for long. She has had it for a month and she loves the dress. It looks new even after being washed at least 10 times. I wish I got 2 sizes up instead of just 1
5.0,I love the colors and this fits just as I expected... I'm currently pregnant and the waistline doesn't squeeze me at all...🥰
5.0,Really think this is a great deal. Soo pretty
5.0,love it!! amazing quality. looks so rich and beautiful with other charms!
5.0,I use these during a long run (10+ miles). Very comfortable..
5.0,"These are even better in person! I always love Demonia shoes but these ones are super amazing, fit true to size and the deliver was unbelievable fast!!! Would definitely order from this company again without a doubt"
5.0,The quality is excellent.  4 pairs for this price - so I was expecting them to be thinner. They are great and will be more suitable in summer.  My daughter wore the black ones with the silver bows for Christmas to match her dress.  The silver bows are so very pretty and no glitter comes off.  That's a huge plus!  It has good elastic too. Definitely very pleased with this purchase.
5.0,Super cute earrings :)
5.0,This is a gift for my dad. Love the hat.
5.0,It hasn't broken yet and me and my girlfriend wear them everyday. I'd buy it again. Had for about a month now.
5.0,"Absolutely in love with this watch. Had my eyes on it for a long time and finally had the opportunity to get it. Love everything about it, except for a slight issue that is the light. There IS a light button but the light is weak and at an angle wear it doesn't illuminate the time, so if you're going to be in the dark a lot this may not be the best option for you. As for me I love it."
5.0,Love everything about these shirts and the pricing is great
5.0,I love my new money clip!! Right now it is holding 12 bills and my license along with one credit card in the slot. Haven't had my wallet in my rear pocket for 5 days! Great customer service and follow up.
5.0,"Beautiful quality necklace. The pendant was much larger than I thought it would be, which I liked. Lovely piece to add to my necklace collection!"
5.0,The belt just looks awesome. The colors are spot on and the belt is easy to adjust for size. If you're a Pokemon fan go ahead and order this belt.
5.0,Fits well as expected and color is great
5.0,Beautiful. Fits very well to the T.
5.0,"Okay so I love this watch. It's really small and really light, but it's really comfortable to wear. I also like how simple it is. And for some reason it's really popular with hipsters. Or at least I suppose it is that's what Google told me. Anyway it's cheap and fun you'll like it."
5.0,They were cute & nice
5.0,My bff loves her gift
5.0,True to size. Feels comfortable but I would like it better if it was a bit wider. Other than that it's a good look and a good feel.
5.0,These pins are really nice and the price is incredible!
5.0,Love love this skirt. It fit better than I anticipated and the pockets were a wonderful addage!!
5.0,Great outfit but you need a to buy two sizes up. Seems like the default as with everything China China
5.0,"Since receiving this I've worn one everyday under my regular and work shirts.  I run a sheet metal shop that isn't really heated or cooled and since I live in a state where the weather changes as much as peoples minds I've had the opportunity to wear it in hot and cold.  I have to say, no matter the temperature, this tank has kept me comfortable.  I have since this purchase added three more to bring my total to five.  Well worth the money."
5.0,Great swimsuit. Double lined. Heavy material. High Quality.  Fits great
5.0,So cute and comfy!!!!
5.0,It was all as expected and then some.
5.0,"Soft, comfortable. A little big but overall great"
5.0,I really love the way it looks! It fits perfectly the delivery was pretty fast considering the fact that it came from Hong Kong 2wks...the fit is true to size and the quality is great considering what I paid!!! I will be ordering again!!
5.0,"I’m giving this 5 stars because it is extremely well made and the fabric is high quality. The shape is a boxy and the torso section is short- I wish it were 3 inches longer. It is soft and it has some stretch to it.<br /><br />I am 5’4” and 120 lbs., I normally wear an xs but the small fit me well."
5.0,Her favorite shoes
5.0,"I do have this dress in blue too but I ordered a medium that time and although you cannot really tell it is a tad big I ordered a small for this one and it fits perfect. Even though I am a bit more well-endowed in the top area, it still fits and flows nicely. I obviously love this dress since I have it in multiple colors. It is very comfortable. It is a silky type material and thick enough to where you cannot see through it but thin enough to where it can be worn in summer without making you uncomfortably hot. I have had issues with other dresses that were like that. I cannot stress enough how awesome this dress is and how glad I am for getting it."
5.0,I love everything about Harley Quinn so when my old wallet aged out I knew I would get one with her on it. I do have one issue with it in that it is to small but my old wallet was about an inch and a half thick. So this will help me clean out the crap in my wallet.<br />Edit: I have been using this wallet for 5 years and I have yet to regret buying it.
5.0,Not the best quality but it is easier to use than most of the other septum jewelry here.
5.0,Fit as expected and I have received many compliments. Good jacket to ride in without the big ticket price. My only concern is the inner lining is a bit light and can tear if not careful.
5.0,"I was quite surprised when I received these earrings, they are really beautiful and the perfect size for your ears, delicate and dainty in size.  Beautiful white roses, I highly recommend them!"
5.0,"I not only received one, but two. On my daughter's birthday! So she got one and so did I! Thank you!"
5.0,Always nice to give the right gift
5.0,"i get so many compliments on this! long, fit great. i'm 5/2 150lbs and love it!"
5.0,I have 3 pairs now and they are soooo comfy!
5.0,Looked more expensive stylish
5.0,"Price, quality and customer service off the charts. I highly recommend this seller and their products."
5.0,"Love these things!!! I’ve had them in since I bought them. The backs do not get loose like other earrings due to the screw type closer. They do not hurt my ears at all and have not turned them green either!!! Wins all the way around on these for me so far!!! I got the black, but the silver ones are next! Super cute, easy and comfortable to wear! Excellent buy!!"
5.0,"Very slim, holds only a few cards and a little bit of cash.  I don't know if it protects my credit cards, but it did block my RFID room key from working when inside the wallet.  I bought it for travel use, but have continued to use it since I got home because it's comfortable having the small thin wallet."
5.0,"Great quality, and it came with a tool to make another hole, AND directions how to shorten it.  Excellent"
5.0,"I was apprehensive to get this bag because it's the cheapest one that I found but since it had free returns, I figured, why not because if it's janky, I can just return it and awesomely, it's exactly as pictured!  I wanted a purse that would go with everything and it sure does!  I haven't had any issues with it but also haven't worn with nice dresses yet so I don't know if it'll snag but it seems pretty tightly woven so I'm not worried about it, hope this helps!"
5.0,Words can't explain how beautiful and glamorous this producIs is.  I wish I knew how to upload a picture because I look so beautiful in this. The fit was perfect because I am a bit Curvy on the back side so I'm glad it runs a bit big.
5.0,Very comfortable and easy to adjust to my particular waist size.
5.0,Quality soft Headbands.<br />You get what you pay for...<br />These Headbands/Sweatbands are wonderful and feel so good next to your skin.
5.0,"04.04.17 Update - I've  had the purse for a while. I still like it and would buy it, but ive added 2 pics for you to see with and without ends snapped. Also some of you may be more picky about the way the one zipper lays, I'm not. Hope this helps with any purchases. ORIGINAL POST- I bought the blue bag, and am very happy with it. I wanted a workhorse purse. I don’t want to change every five minutes and this fits the bill. It’s a classic style to me, with three main zipper compartments; however keep in mind the middle one does not connect on either end of the zipper, meaning you could put a bottle of water in the end, or someone else could put their hand in their and take something, so I put important stuff in the two sides. It does stand up on its own which to me is great as I hate when they fall over. The inside is a chocolate brown material which goes quite well with the blue, and the zippers are metal which appear to be sturdy so they won’t break in a month. The handles can go down or cross over each other at the top. Would I buy again? Yes. I would definitely I recommend it, and the brand."
5.0,Love my dress. It fits and looks wonderful on me. I am 5ft. And not many dresses fit me well. Thank you.
5.0,It's perfect and got here on time for Halloween!
5.0,"Beautiful necklace, I love the geometric pattern of the wolf"
5.0,The phone holder fits an iPhone 6s with a life proof case anything bigger will not fit. It seems to fit my dog comfortably.  I will update if bottom straps cause any irritation.
5.0,"My set came on time like they said, and I am loving my set :)"
5.0,perfect fit on my regular glasses.
5.0,Fits and keeps shape. Soft material.
5.0,Really comfortable and true to size.
5.0,Good carry-on glasses
5.0,We love it bought it for my nieces high school graduation because she joined the Air Force!👍🏼
5.0,"When I am on my feet for hours and hours at a time these are the best socks to wear! I noticed when I was on the nursing unit that my legs would hurt and ache throughout the day and especially at the end of my shift, but now with these compression socks my legs and feet never ache! They're amazing, highly suggest!!"
5.0,Look great. Fit well. Very warm
5.0,Very nice as a cover up
5.0,Excele
5.0,Huge hit this past Xmas. Versatile and fun.
5.0,"This is my new favorite shirt!  I've gained some weight since quarantine started (of which my sister lovingly refers to as the quaren-fifteen 😂).  I needed something with a little extra room in it, that wouldn't drown me if I lose the weight again.  The pleats on the front achieved just that.  I don't look chubby in this shirt (yay) and it's incredibly comfortable.  I wear it with leggings while I'm at home, but it can easily be dressed up with a pair of slacks.  I plan on buying the other colors soon!  I am 5'2"" and around 145lbs.  I ordered a large."
5.0,"Fit just as expected, looks just like the picture. Awesome find."
5.0,Very cheap. Awesome colors. Exactly what i wanted
5.0,"I love the simplicity of the watch, no bell, no whistle, no ego. My only gripe is that the built in light is a bit weak and turns off immediately after the button is let go."
5.0,"Super cute dress for $7.99 during Amazon deals. I am about 125 and height is 5'3 so I ordered a small. It fits perfectly fine and it hits above the knees. I ordered the navy blue, it's not see through and it's so cute for fall and spring. I do recommend!"
5.0,Fits like it was custom made.
5.0,Love how easy to put on and wear these are
5.0,Love the fit. Not too tight like some can be.
5.0,My favorite yellow dress!
5.0,"This tank is amazing...Perfect fit ( I got a large) stretchy,good quality and over all good buy"
5.0,Liked everything about this sweater.
5.0,So beautiful.  My friend ‘s 5 yr old granddaughter loves it.
5.0,"Cute, small, color matched photo, has 4 card slots w. a small coin section in the middle. It holds 4 quarters. I saw reviews saying they had Italian writing under the bow that translated to something weird BUT mine says &#34;forever friend your choice&#34; I laughed out loud because well...thats just silly. It also came 10 days early. I love this wallet though!"
5.0,They came quickly and are exactly as pictured. Very pretty
5.0,"I bought this to have a simple band to wear at work as a nurse. I haven't taken it off! Very comfortable, the sides are smooth and you can't tell you are even wearing it. The color is very shiny, and I love my new ring! I received a discount for an honest review, but this ring is well worth the asking price."
5.0,Cute top.  Perfect for my granddaughter.  She loves Ariel.
5.0,"These boots are so pretty and sturdy!! I was very worried about them, seeing that I am a plus size women with size 15 feet! But it all worked out, and the material was stretchy for the leg area. Will continue to purchase from this company in the future!"
5.0,Absolutely love it. Use it all the time and it's so handy to have.
5.0,"beautiful, elegant peice-if i  had one negative , it would be that the chain is almost to delicate for daily wear-"
5.0,"This dress is very pretty and has delicate details. There's a zipper on the side to help you get in the dress easier. I found the fit to run small. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size. The X-Large would have been ideal.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
5.0,For the price this is an excellent watch. I do like Casio. Owned several. The band usually wears out before the watch. But I am rough with a watch.
5.0,"Husband loved it. Fit well he is small. 137lbs 5""7. Got a small"
5.0,Love these shirts! Need more colors
5.0,"Quality construction, exactly as described, speedy delivery, even a handy soft carrying case bag thingy. Great deal for 8 bucks."
5.0,Nice glasses. As described. Thanks so much! Fast shipping.
5.0,Love the feel of the shirt next to my skin. Comfortable and silky.
5.0,"Order a size up for lose fit, for oversized off the shoulder you may want to go up 2 sizes. Comfy, easy top that goes with everything. Definitely recommend, not long enough for leggings but fit is cute and it’s lightweight as well."
5.0,"I’m not allowed to have my ears pierced, so I have to go for the clip on. A little painful when you Wes rut for a long time. Though pretty hurts."
5.0,This has to be my favorite purse ever! It’s got so much storage but it’s small! It’s the perfect size. I like the material and design.
5.0,I bought them for a gift . They are super cute!
5.0,Cute!  Purchased for my 6 yr old and they fit her well.  Gives the world a green tint when you look through- she likes them a lot!
5.0,Great quality dress. I normally wear at XL but ordered a 2XL but after receiving it i could have ordered my normal size and it would have fit perfectly. Out of all item's the head band was small. It fit around my head but it was tight. All other items were perfect!
5.0,Nice and exact what's described.<br />Worth the price.
5.0,Didn't have any problem for the one time I wore them.
5.0,My husband has short wide feet so he normally buys a half sizer bigger shoe to accommodate his wide foot. I ordered these for him and he LOVES them. He says they qre rhe most comfortable boots he has ever had. He also has these weird knots flair up on him from wearing different shoes so he pretty mich lives in his work boots to avoid the pain. Hands down i will continue to buy him these boots!
5.0,she put it on the first day it arrived and hasn't taken it off since. This is her first necklace that wasn't gold and she absolutely LOVES it!!!!
5.0,"Super comfy. I’m short so was really long when it arrived, and I ended up taking in the length and now it’s perfect. I wear this dress to work or to hang out with friends. It’s not very forgiving so I usually wear tights underneath"
5.0,Para hacer ejercicios muy bueno para retener el sudor
5.0,My New Favorite type of shoes and they turned heads! I’m glad to have purchased 2 pair!
5.0,I bought this for my now husband as his wedding day gift.. I had it engraved & when I received it in the mail I just couldn't believe what high quality and wonderfully made it was considering the price.. he loved it! And wore it for our ceremony :) it is slightly smaller then most pocket watches but I liked that. It also comes in a nice wooden box
5.0,Good quality.. Works just like it should. Received quickly!
5.0,I bought these slippers for my daughter she loves them they are very cute and plush
5.0,These are a wonderful product! My husband bought them as a gift for my MIL. She loves playing darts and was so excited to receive these as a birthday present. Would purchase again.
5.0,Good water proof watch
5.0,"Beautiful, good size and soft enough!"
5.0,This pajama set does not fit as expected.  The top is too small and the bottom belongs to another size altogether.  I will not return it because the shipping cost is too much.  It isn't worth returning.  I am stuck with it.  I won't buy again.
5.0,What little girl doesn’t need a few extra tights.
5.0,It was even better than expected. Beautiful fabric.
5.0,"Yay for pockets! Seriously tho- so tired of faux pockets on women’s pants, ladies deserve pockets too! SO happy to have 2 REAL, and deep front pockets in these! These are really cute, comfortable, and flattering! The fabric is a bit different than i expected which was a semi structured stretch dress pant material.. what they actually ended up being are more of a thicker jersey/yoga pant material hybrid.. i don’t know how to describe them, all i know is they’re super stretchy, comfy/soft, breathable! The fabric does make them a little more casual- which I’m happy about since I’m used to wearing fitted pants and i worried these may look took “office attire” but they’re totally suitable for any time of day- brunch, cocktails, all of the above!<br />I’m 5’7”, 25” waist, 33” hip and usually wear a size 25 in pants. I have a crazy long torso so high waisted means a minimum 12” front rise to go over my belly button. I ordered a small and the waist fits perf! I measured the inseam at 33”, and the front rise at 14.5” so fits great in all directions!<br />Really adore these pants- thinking i may get a white pair to wear after the winter months!"
5.0,"Love, love, love, them! I ordered my size 8.5, and they fit perfectly. I get compliments every time I wear them. They are very comfortable and the bottoms are non skid."
5.0,Pleasantly surprised by this purchase. Great quality for the price.
5.0,Close to what I saw in Florida and did not buy it.  It will certainly draw some attention when I wear it.  Great Buy!
5.0,I used this with my Monokuma cosplay and another choker to make  it even more dramatic.  I like how long the spikes are because they still show even with A bulky wig.  It also came in a nice protection bag so it’s easy to store .
5.0,I am very happy with this purchase! The band's colors a beautiful. It seems to be very durable. When it gets dirty I just throw it in the wash and then it is fine.
5.0,"I normally order a Large in sweaters but the only option was medium for this one so I took a chance since I loved the colors so much.  It's perfect, I think a large would have been too big.  This goes to the top of my ""favorite sweater"" list!"
5.0,I got a cup size bigger than normal as advised. Love this set.
5.0,"This is my most favorite snap!!! It is so beautiful and I get tons of compliments every time I wear it. The colors are so vibrant and it goes with every thing I wear. Gave my daughter one too, and she absolutely loves it as much as I do. Buy it today, you won't be sorry, it will be your favorite too!!!"
5.0,Fast delivery and exactly how it’s shown in photos! Very great quality for price
5.0,comfortable and well made.  I forgot i was wearing it..  It holds a lot as well.
5.0,"Bought these sunglasses for a trip, so I wouldn’t have to ruin my 300 dollar sunglasses. And these fit amazing and will be perfect for my trip"
5.0,Great Aviator Glasses look sharp good quality and they come with well made carry case to keep them safe.!!
5.0,As always excellent quality from Vans.
5.0,Live this key chain. Great quality😊
5.0,The fabric is so nice.  Very soft and feels great on.. I am a medium and it fits great
5.0,Found these a few years ago and liked them from the start. Does a great job of keeping your glasses right where you want them. Love the fact that you can adjust them.

5.0,La tela es buena y la misma que en la foto y muy cómoda de usar.
5.0,I was wrong in ordering 36&#34;.  I should have ordered 32&#34;.
5.0,Love it..well made hat...
5.0,I ordered way too large. I'm usually a size 27 or 28 and I wasnt sure so I got size 5. Way too big. But I love them even too large so I will exchange for the next smaller size.
5.0,"These are holding up well. I think I I've had them almost 6 months now, I wash and dry them after each use."
5.0,"Very cute, I’m 5’9 so I was pushing it with length but love it! Will wear next year"
5.0,"It's hard to find angel like this more less one in silver. I wanted it in silver to match all my husband's other uniform pins. It looks great on his uniform, and he loves it."
5.0,This coverup is very flattered and cute. It been perfect for the pool and the lake this summer.
5.0,"Perfect for a person who likes small, gold earrings with some pizazz."

5.0,Small and perfect!
5.0,This is a nice looking jacket. I'm impressed.
5.0,Beautiful!  Great price!
5.0,"Beautiful dress, originally purchased to walk down the isle, but wanted a little more of a wedding dress look, this one I’m wearing to dinner on my wedding night. Perfect ivory color, dress is a little heavy but I like that because the liner holds things in place without bulging out my belly or feel constricted.  Elegant and classy, comfortable. I’m 5’0” 153lbs. I ordered a large and it’s perfect normally wear an 8/10. The dress comes right about my knee. Love it!"
5.0,Absolutely worth the money. I’d buy again
5.0,"Exactly as ordered and came the next day. Real wool, genuine tartan colors."
5.0,"My husband and I both tried these out this last weekend, I was pleasantly surprised that the vinyl was thicker than I had expected it to be. They did a great job protecting my hands. These gloves have a nice stretch to them. I will repurchase these."
5.0,I love this dress. It is so easy to throw it on and look well put together. Plus pockets!!!!
5.0,Super cute vintage lake hat!
5.0,Love them.  I've 0h<br />ad multiple compliments.
5.0,Fits normal.  I’m 6ft 170lbs and I got a large.  I would def recommend it to my friends and family.
5.0,"Supet cute. Kinda long, but great for a night out"
5.0,I got this to send to my sister for her Feb. 12th birthday.  It looks so cute I ordered me one.
5.0,"I took a chance and bought the last of the inventory ... I'm glad I did.<br />They fit me like a glove, without cutting off circulation.<br />Unfortunately I'm 5 pair shy of a complete set.<br />I use them under my work pants to keep from shafting ... as funny as that may sound, is as good as it works.<br />I tried the shorter style and found it to be a little too tight and constricting, so I gave them to my wife; now she's hooked.<br />In two words ... Thanks and Restock."
5.0,This was an awesome fit.
5.0,"Fits as expected, nice quality, soft and warm. Great gift"
5.0,"The mens chaco's are much heavier than the women's, but overall chacos are great!"
5.0,Got my bag and i love it!! It looks good and goes well with my everyday outfit for work:) it comes with a purse where I put my make ups and other paraphernalias lols..
5.0,Love them! Perfect and looks so shiny !
5.0,"I followed Azbros size chart. I'm a 35 waist and 44 hips and the 3x fits me perfect. Seriously my new favorite skirt. I've worn it all around and it is just great. The black slip underneath is a bit tight all the way down so if you have bigger hips you may have to remove it or get a size larger. The belt was really cheaply made but I didn't care, thought it looked better with a thick belt anyway."
5.0,We love this shirt- excellent quality and vibrant colors
5.0,These sun glass are perfect. Great quality as well.
5.0,These were a gift for a friend she loved them and the drop earrings are in fact genuine leather!
5.0,Love everything thing about these joggers. This is my third pair from this company. I will be buying more.
5.0,Best way to surprise dad and family
5.0,My girlfriend absolutely loves it! Identical in every way imagine ...she haven’t even taken it out the plastic yet since Christmas!
5.0,"I love it! It’s the fluffiest robe ever! I use it as a night robe. I’m medium size but like my robe to be bigger. I ordered x-large and it came as perfect as I expected! The length is not too long. Plus it gives me the feeling of wearing a nice cozy blanket in winter. Another thing that I like about it is I’m a new mommy. This robe makes my life much easier to breastfeed. I’m currently on mentally leave which means I get to stay home all the time. Of course I choose to be in this warm robe all day. It’s easy to breastfeed and do other stuffs. Especially, I have to soak in a hot tub to heal after delivery 3 times a day. I can just jump in and out to the robe. Not only it’s great for the usage. But the design and material are also good! I like how it feels, nice, thick and fluffy. The size is perfect as described. It is best for winter! I absolutely recommend this to my friends and family"
5.0,"Socks are so cute, great quality material. Love it!"
5.0,"Listing says machine washable, care instructions with product says handwash only.  I'm splitting the difference: I will machine wash and hang dry.  I'll let you know how they hold up."
5.0,"I don't live in a cold place, but my family does.  These make for nice gloves for when I visit my relatives or go on winter trips.  The leather is soft and the insides warm.  Are not heavy duty, but perfect for moderate cold weather.  I have small hands and these fit nicely."
5.0,Lots of different ones
5.0,"Super cute top, love it"
5.0,They are super cute!  Grandson absolutely loves them!!
5.0,Lightweight very cute
5.0,"Beautiful color! Thiner material but not see through! The ruching is very flattering on my post baby tummy (5&1y/o) & hips! The top can be pulled up to hide more cleavage or down to show off more! Very beautiful dress! I'm 5'8"" 147lbs and ordered a medium the front is about 3 inch above my knee and just above my knee bend in the back"
5.0,I love these joggers. They’re so comfortable and the material feels very luxurious. They fit like a glove and are incredibly soft on the inside and the pockets are a great detail to have. Will be purchasing in other colors.
5.0,I love these earrings. The quality is excellent and they really look beautiful. Excellent price! I bought a set as a gift; loved them so much I ordered another set for myself.
5.0,Nice and comfortable. I think padding in a little to much though.
5.0,I think this is really a good fit and I got it to match a pair of leggings and it’s just a terrific match.  I am hoping that it lasts for a long time.  I like it so much that I plan to buy one just like it for my niece who needs to add some sweaters to her college wardrobe.
5.0,Love the feel and looks great<br />Go America
5.0,Love these shorts! So comfortable and cute! I love the cell phone pocket too.
5.0,"Although this was intended for outer wear, such as cloaks or capes, I bought this for cardigans, it's very cute in person.  I love the simple style, I wish the had silver/black color too."
5.0,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! Got it for my husband in anticipation of an upcoming trip abroad.<br />As a test, I washed it in the sink and hung it to air dry. It was dry in less than 2 hours and it didn't need ironing. It packs small, it's soft to the touch and it looks great on.The pattern/color is subtle and goes with anything--from a pair of shorts to jeans or nice linen pants.<br /><br />It has a nice generous fit but since my husband is lean and trim (wears fitted M, generally) a Small was the right size for him. I would love to see some more subtle patterns like this as well as solid basic colors: black, navy, white. Same for the women's options which of course, I now need to get for myself."
5.0,It fit more snug than I wanted at first but eventually stretched out. I wear this so often. It is so comfortable and cute. Not a dupe as everyone says the straps are a lot thinner but still sturdy. I do want one in every color
5.0,Exactly as described. I spotted this at Target and found it on Amazon for $5 cheaper. Classic and good quality. My Casio watches always hold up better than the more expensive brands. FYI I know this is a mens watch but I am wearing it and looks great on me (a woman.)
5.0,"Delivery was super fast. The dress fits great and I really like it. I'm a 5'1, 120 lb and ordered a small."
5.0,Es lo que se ve material muy bueno flexible que con vapor moldeas

5.0,Gf is a huge GOT fan and also loves the comfier things in life. These pj's were a hit!

5.0,"Great shirt, but the sleeves are very large and very long."
5.0,Very pretty and the extra bracelet included is very pretty. My daughter loved her gift.
5.0,I saw this necklace on Etsy for over $40!  I was happy to find it in Amazon.  I have gotten a lot of compliments.  It looks very expensive especially because of the slightly thicker chain.  I love that it has an extender too. It's perfect!
5.0,These work well and easy to clean
5.0,I bought these for my daughter as a birthday gift and she loved them.  There were the right size size and elegant.  I would recommend.
5.0,Luv it so much!
5.0,Love these joggers. They are like leggings but are joggers. I ordered large as I wanted them loose. They fit perfect and are so comfortable. I will order more colors.
5.0,Perfect! Exactly what I wanted
5.0,"Nice product. I bought this for my son. Nice color, nice price."
5.0,"Very fashionable, I have a computer desk job and have found since purchasing these that I have less headaches and do not squint or strain my eyes anymore."
5.0,"I ordered a size bigger so it would fit large, and I love it! I'm 5'9&#34; and the length is perfect. It's soft, comfortable, and the sleeve length is just right for a summer into fall day. I only wish it came in more colors!"
5.0,Love this sweater.  It's very cute and lightweight.
5.0,"I was looking for mens luggage for a while... saw these and bought right away.  Loved the bags.  Rugged, plenty of room and no frills or extra BS.  Just pack your junk and go......"
5.0,my wife LOVED it! Thats all I need to say!!!!
5.0,"This dress runs very large, but that is the intended look. I have gotten more compliments on this dress than anything else I own and I'm constantly telling people where I got it. Even took less time than stated to get to me, which was nice. Great quality and look for the price!"
5.0,Love it!!  I will have to wear a nude camisole under it but it looks great.
5.0,"I purchased this watch as an outdoors watch for camping, hiking and hunting. I was looking for an atomic, solar powered watch, and all the other functions are a bonus. Most items seem to work out of the box. I had to recalibrate the compass, and continually have to do so.. the manual recommends that you recalibrate according to your map each time you go out. Which makes sense due to the difference between true north and magnetic north. The manual is intense and teaches a lot about why and how the watch works to help provide an understanding on how to properly use the functions. Another reviewer said the watch clarity is a lot better on the real thing, and they were right! The watch is beautiful, and the functions work as they're supposed to. I find myself wearing it all the time, not just for outdoorsy things!"
5.0,I like excellent
5.0,Wife loved her present. Gorgeous
5.0,"Love it. Very pretty lace mask. Excellent craftsmanship. Quality embroidery.  Intricate details. Feminine and delicate, but not to the point of being fragile. I think it has a little sizing in it to give it some stiffness, which means it should hold up over time.<br /><br />I only wish that the double satin tie-back ribbons were a little larger and thicker to make tying easier.  I had trouble tying it from behind and had to get my husband to help me.  The satin ribbons were too small for his big clumsy hands, and he had trouble tying a knot. So I had to get a female friend to tie it for me.  I wear glasses, so that made it difficult for the mask to stay in place.  If you wear glasses, just know it may be a bit challenging keeping the mask in place.  It tends to come untied and slips down the face.  Just be sure it's on tight, but not so tight that you can't see out of your glasses.  Other than those those two things, I'm very pleased and happy that I bought this mask.  I will wear it again when the right occasion arises."
5.0,Gorgeous dress! Stretchy fit! I ordered an XL but returned it for a large and fits perfectly.
5.0,What a gorgeous bag. ECOCRAFTWORLD produce the most quality bags and should  always buy from them. This is fabulous as a gift or for yourself. The colour and feel of the real leather is amazing. They always make the best and do not be tempted to buy from other sellers.<br />Great !!
5.0,"I am a very good customer of miusol, but this is the best fabric used so far. Highly recommended for office wear"
5.0,The has been one of the best toddler suits we've ever owned.  It's fits well and holds up to consistent use.
5.0,These are so light and beautiful. I love them they look very classy.
5.0,"Extremely cute & GORGEOUS dress! Better than I thought it would be, for sure.<br />Came in excellent condition, folded beautifully and no creases right out of the package.<br />This is a prefect outfit for business, dress and even casual. The hem line is about knee length (perfect in my opinion) and can be used for almost any function because it's black and timeless!<br />The fit I chose was medium l, and it fits me better than expensive dresses!! I'm 5'9&#34; and about 130lbs... It's hard to locate flattering clothes so when I say I'm impressed.. I most certainly am!!!<br />Not a string out of place, looks high quality and fits so well!!<br />I would most certain purchase again!!<br />I did receive this dress at a discount in exchange for my honest review, experience and opinions. A discount does not sway my review in any form."
5.0,"Soft, the graphic on it is super cute, perfect for sailor moon lovers for a minimal mask showing that off."
5.0,"Nice jersey type material, fits like a jersey should. Turned out great for my hallo costume."
5.0,"Good fabric, excellent cut and design, fit perfect.<br />Recommended"
5.0,I wanted a cotton knit dress that would be comfortable in South Carolina summers and this dress fits the bill.  I am 5'8&#34; and have a hard time finding dresses that won't show off my underwear when I raise my arms.  I'd actually prefer this be an inch longer but this one is all right.  I first got the blue and then order a second one in olive drab which I can wear into October when it might be 90 degrees here.
5.0,This is awesome. I love the design and the nice large bat wing arms. It is a nice length. Can be casual or dress up! The material is soft and light. It was exactly what I was looking for. I am a size 12 and bought a large. It is loose and comfortable. Fits Perfectly!
5.0,"Hands down, the best bra EVER. The first time I ordered one size up (38B) and it fit good, but I thought my normal size would be better. I read all the reviews and I was trying to be safe, but it turns out that my 36B fits perfect. I love this bra so much that I'm ordering almost every color, right now I just have black and red. It's super comfy, pushes up better than my $60 VS bra, and I love how it adjusts with a simple lace up. I can honestly say that I don't want to wear any other bra again :) So happy with my purchase!<br />*EDIT* Just to be clear, I only ordered my normal size because I like my bras tight. My normal size (36B) is tight on me, and it gives me a better lift. The 38B fits great and is very comfy, and still pushes up, I just prefer a tighter fit. I hope this helps"
5.0,Baby gift.... cute& soft!
5.0,"Hooked on Darn Tough socks for their comfortable fit, excellent durability and high quality of material and craftsmanship. Selected this model for its heel tab that keeps them form slipping into the shoe even at faster pace and longer distances. Highly recommend."
5.0,Love it! I'm 4'11 and it fits me perfectly!
5.0,"Everyone loves this leopard Santa hat.  I didn’t want to tell people where I bought it so they couldn’t go and order one.  This is my signature piece, and I wear it for the entire month of December.  I’ve been doing this for years.  I bought this one as a backup just in case something happens to my original one.  It truly is a hat that that everyone wants."
5.0,Loose fit. Perfect as a cover up at the pool or the beach.
5.0,A boon if you travel a fair bit. You can actually pack enough in it to leave a carry--on at home.
5.0,Daughter loves this set. Great for Spiderman fans...both boys and girls!
5.0,These fit a little bigger but they’re great socks! They will last
5.0,Really great quality.  Size up and you'll get perfect fit. Image is amazing.
5.0,"Love love love this dress wearing it to my husbands Christmas party with some satin red heels. I'm 5'4 195lbs so I'm really self conscious about my tummy, this dress perfectly hides it well. It fell right below my knees so it is perfect when your running around trying to catch/ bending over to carry a 1 year old."
5.0,"Ordered for my 7yo and it went right up to the knees. A thick material, good quality."
5.0,"I wear these & I bought a pair for one of my daughter in laws..!! Beautiful, with a feel of real sterling silver. Not expensive but one would never guess..!!  ;)"
5.0,"Love this dress!  I am over 60 years old and have more bumps and lumps than I used to have.  I am 5'9 and take a large sometimes a x-large.  I bought this is an x-large.  This dress is perfect, light weight and hides everything.  Looks good on and pairs well with any summer blazer.  I also like the fact it is not low cut in the front."
5.0,I love the way they fit! They offer just enough stretch to move around and not have them migrate down!
5.0,This was a gift so I don't have an opinion about the fit. The recipient loved it though so... great!
5.0,"Good value, used for a costume"
5.0,I like it.  I took my watch to a jeweler who attached it for me.
5.0,Beautiful watch.  Compliments everywhere. Really stands out.
5.0,loved it and was promptly delivered
5.0,The one thing that is different from the picture is that the sleeves are REALLY poofy!  I HATE poofy sleeves!  In the picture the sleeve do not look poofy at all.  I will have to modify the sleeves so they aren't so poofy.  The bow is removable which is awesome since it just isn't my favorite on me.  I sewed it at the back of the dress and gathered the skirt in just a tad in the back to make it look cute.
5.0,"Great hat for the gym! I was worried about the quality, but so far so good."
5.0,love having a key ring that I can just throw on my arm and have easy access
5.0,"Seriously love these!  I had read that they were good quality.  Owning other brands that can cost up to 10x the cost of these, I figured I’d give these a try.  The quality was as good as the more expensive leggings I own and I ordered two more pairs when I put these on!  Will be buying more."
5.0,Thanks...my most fave and powerful crystal yet...also received it much sooner than estimated time
5.0,Handsome watch
5.0,"So pretty, I always get compliments!"
5.0,"Love it, fast shipping.."
5.0,"Loved this outfit, a little itchy but nothing too unbearable and that is to be expected. Purchased for Halloween, wear for fun sometimes and have the wife wear it too. I'm 5'8"" male weighing 140 lbs and this fits nearly perfect, I can fit into it without unzipping so I suppose a medium would be a more of a perfect fit. Regardless fits great and would definitely recommend this quality outfit."

5.0,Flattering! Easy to wear! I have many!
5.0,Gray shirt Smooth and light I like the way he looks
5.0,Its really warm . Love it pretty.
5.0,"These are well made and have decent sound quality, especially compared to similar products on the market. I'm glad I spent a few extra dollars and purchased these. This was not my first purchase by Soundbot; in fact our bluetooth shower speaker 2 years later still works and sounds great. They are not clunky like some of the hats, that have the speakers hanging out or showing. Bluetooth speaker beanie came in a nice box/packaging as well."
5.0,"Love it, so hard to find big and tall sizes that look nice. It fit perfectly"
5.0,"Very nice, good quality. The leather even smells good!"
5.0,"Looks exactly what is advertised, would definitely buy again. Very sturdy pin 📌"

5.0,good merchant
5.0,Material was good quality
5.0,"Love it ,looks just like the picture. I highly recommended this ring if you are considering buying it."
5.0,Very cute and soft rubber bottoms - bought 2 pairs
5.0,I didn’t wear it with the top because I don’t like the way the top fits but the skirt is perfect
5.0,I was looking for a skirt I can wear while teaching and this turned out to be perfect! I am 5'7&#34; and it hits right under my knees. The color is a bit darker than it looks on the picture but I didn't mind that. Material is very stretchy which makes the waist band very comfortable. The best part is that the skirt looks a lot nicer than it costs! I thought this was such a great deal and I ordered another one in grey!!
5.0,in fact I am ordering more today for my mother. She saw them on my carriage (for a horse) and wants to put some in her china hutch the tine no see wire is perfect for that as well.
5.0,Love them. Will take a few days to &#34;break in&#34;. After that they are so comfortable.
5.0,"I wasn’t sure if it would really work, but it does. The color is pretty. Not khaki. It’s more mauvy. I like it a lot. Will have to iron the packing wrinkles out though. Haven’t washed it yet but from the material it will probably wash well."
5.0,Love love love this bra makes my boobs look amazing fits good i did size up the band size since others say it was a little small n it fits great sizing up i will definitely ordering more
5.0,"Ordered it for a Halloween costume, and it's perfect! Surprisingly thick material with good color. The red shines through the black very slightly, but it is not noticeable."
5.0,Daughter in-law loves them!
5.0,I love it! !
5.0,I bought these sleeves for a recent Ironman race. The temperatures started to look like it was going to be a little cool.  The sleeves worked great.  There was minor slipping near the wrist when in the aero position.
5.0,These shoes are soooo comfortable and I have bunions ! Love them
5.0,Beautiful  and elegant piece. Perfect.
5.0,"Put them in my regular daily-use sneakers.  Easy to insert them and fasten them.  I don't feel the difference as I walk around my day, but they're definitely easier when lacing up in the morning.  And they don't wear out the sneakers or laces 'round the holes.  Overall, I like them!"
5.0,"These are the most comfortable,  thick & protective fabric masks I've found."
5.0,"Literally, I have not worn another watch in about 8 years. I keep buying this over and over. Eventually the strap holder breaks (after serious abuse), but it's cheap enough to purchase another one. The light is dim, but it doesn't bother me. Great water resistance. I wear it swimming, lakes, shower, etc. I sleep with this baby on. Eventually, you forget it's even there. Sleek and slim. You don't need a fancy watch to show your importance. Get out there and do something worthwhile. The watch is for telling time."
5.0,"Nice, light material. Great"
5.0,"Very nice material, fits true to size.  Looks lovely on!"
5.0,Good quality. Fast Delivery.
5.0,Product matched expectations.  Nice key chain.
5.0,"This is a lot more then I needed, but it is a great deal.  For the price, you would pay for one elsewhere you get a set of 10 and I am sure I can always find friends who need them.  I use this for my motorcycle key with the trunk and accessories keys in the second half.  I use to have to turn off my engine just to get to them, but this definitely helps."
5.0,"I love this shirt and am getting another one in a different color. It is SO soft and comfy, perfect for cold weather and for layering."
5.0,perfect shirt to wear for my sons graduation. color shown matched actual color perfectly. Washes well too.
5.0,"So soft and comfortable, thin enough to wear during warmer weather, the cut just flows with you, will definitely buy again!"
5.0,"Awesome sleep mask! When I began using a CPAP about 8 years ago, I got up every morning with swollen and puffy eyes.  It was not until I was told that the air from the CPAP machine was what was causing my eyes swell, so I have worn a sleep mask since that time.  I have tried a lot of different ones with mixed results but I can say this is the most effective sleep mask and blocking any air from the CPAP mask &#34;leaking&#34; under the mask and causing eye swelling and puffiness.  It does an amazing job of sailing the area of the nose and lower cheeks that completely blocks any airflow.  Not only that is extremely comfortable to wear.I also love the travel case because it holds sleep mask and the earplugs that I use when I am traveling.<br />I did receive a discount on this product for my unbiased review however the product discount in no way affects my unqualified recommendation for this product.  I would highly recommend it to anyone, especially to CPAP wearers."

5.0,"my granddaughter Loves them, Great value!"
5.0,"After a few months, I was concerned that the COVID-19 pandemic did not show signs of slowing down, I knew we were in this for the long haul.  I anticipated that protective masks would be the trend. The masks with pictures of fashionable designs or the ones that sparkled would be the ones that would be a ""best seller.""<br />Every where I go people are always complementing me or asking me where I got my masks. I am very happy with my purchase and will continue to purchase more."
5.0,A fun gift for my quirky son! Thank you!

5.0,"I normally wear an XL in clothing especially on my tops. I'm a double D and I need lots of room LOL. Because of this I ordered a 3X. So glad i did. it fits like a cover up should. Because of the adjustable straps I can make it fit just right, after all cover ups are suppose to fit loose.. My husband loved it too. Now I can feel 100% comfortable when walking around the cruise ship or any pool."
5.0,"I absolutely love these earrings. I never mind ones with the French back if they are long enough not to fall out of my ears. Since I stay very active, this is a requirement because when they are too short on the back side and I get busy at work or exercising, I don't want to lose them.<br /><br />Aside from that, these are really quite lovely. I have very sensitive ears, but these don't bother me in that regard, and they are very stylish and go with lots of different outfits. That's always important to me, that products be versatile as well as functional and pretty. And these tick all the boxes."
5.0,"Great, simple and conservative dress for dinner parties or a even a funeral. Was pleased with the quality, especially for such a low price. At 5'6, it hits just below the knee."

5.0,Awesome wire free bra. I have never been a fan of wirel free bras (34d) but this one has changed that. I love how comfortable it is. Its not seen through tee shirts.  It even  gives you a little cleavage and provides a more natural shape.
5.0,"Cute and just as expected. Use it daily. This is not a high end piece, but that is to be expected for the price!"
5.0,"It is a 1.5 mm necklace, but it is exactly what I was expecting. It looks extremely neat with the right pendant. Also great quality and all solid. The funny thing about this necklace was that I had it in my cart and bought it by accident with the One Click Buy option and couldn’t cancel the order by the time I realized, but I never returned it because I really liked it since day one. Nice jewelry piece to have.  Definitely a great purchase.  Buy it, you know you want to.  LOL"
5.0,"this is a company of integrity. i was totally satisfied with the pin i recently received from artazia but ... i had an obscure question about it. customer service did not know the answer instantly but they said they would look into it and get back to me. and they DID!!! with a full answer to my question. i am very very pleased with artazias product as well as their customer service and would order from them again in a heartbeat!!! i now own FOUR of their pins. gorgeous artistry with attention to detail. hard to find in these times, a company that cares about its customers.<br />jo ann."
5.0,"Very attractive, love the pattern and they give the pressure that I was informed by the doctor that I need.  No one would ever suspect that<br />they are what they are.  In the old days they were not attractive.  You knew you were getting old when you had to start wearing them.  They were<br />only one color, an unattractive &#34;flesh&#34; color."
5.0,"I love the way they are not to dark and not to light and they comfortable, they don't move around your face."
5.0,This hat is so much fun! I ended up taking the buckle off of it because I wasn't a fan. However the light show was so fun. Myself and trick or treaters could not get enough of it.
5.0,Love the style! It's very slimming through the middle and very soft material. I'm 5'1&#34; and the length is perfect!
5.0,"Durable material, the accompanying supplies make it easy to adjust the links."
5.0,My granddaughter used this for her cat costume. She is ten and it fit perfect. It did tear on the belt a little but it served its purpose well since she was only using it for Halloween.
5.0,Would like more patterns

5.0,This T-shirt is so cute and lovely for spring look. It came in handy to complete my spring look with my Initial on it. The cute floral design makes it perfect for the look I was going for. I also love the texture of the fabric. A girl can never go wrong with white tee in her closet!

5.0,So lucky to find this pin.  Was missing this set.  Yeah:)
5.0,"I've been meaning to get one of these for 2 or 3 years and now that I finally committed I feel dumb for not doing it sooner. I'm 6'1"" and 235lbs and got the XL. It fits perfectly. It's only been a little chilly so far so I haven't been able to really test it in the harsh cold. On chilly days it's great. I've even worn this in the rain and while my pants were soaked this kept me dry and warm until everything had evaporated off of me. On windy days you do feel the breeze get through it but it's bearable. Just wear a long sleeve on those days and you'll be fine. I'm not planning on buying another one but instead I'll be buying several. This has been one of the best buys I've ever made."
5.0,"I bought this sweater to layer on cold riding days.  It is SUPER nice and CUTE, as well!  It stretches well enough to get it over my helmet if I need to take it off while riding.  I highly recommend this sweater!!"

5.0,"Comfortable, well made, my grandson loves them."
5.0,"I love loose, flowey clothing and these pants for the bill. I like to match them up with a tighter fitting tank top or shirt. Better quality than expected, although I haven't put them into a washer machine - figured I'd stick with hand washing.<br /><br />I ordered the size 38 option. I'm 5 foot, 112 lbs and they fit perfectly. I didn't even have to bother with a hem job, but I like my pants to be slightly longer than most women do.<br /><br />For something that cost me less than $15, the value is simply fantastic."
5.0,"I went home to Argentina where men like to look put together. We many ltalians there so we dress, this shirt got so many compliments. BUY IT!"
5.0,This is my 1st watch Winder and it is doing excellent

5.0,"I gor these for myself and I absolutely loved them. I had my grandma try them on to see how she liked them, and it was hell trying to get them back. She was absolutely amazed at how crisp and clear everything looked, and said ""I can see so well and clear in these I might never take them off..."". I ended up buying her a pair, and while we match, we both look fabulous."

5.0,"Attractive, looks as shown on webpage. Nice fit. May be slightly roomy for small heads."
5.0,"I love this beautiful necklace. It is even better in person. I read to paint it with clear nail polish, which I did, and it looks even better. It wasn't tied when I opened my package but no big deal. I tied it and burned the end with a lighter. I'm very pleased with my purchase. My sister doesn't know it yet, but I'm getting her one for her birthday too. I flipped for it, so I know she will too."
5.0,"I have a  lot of hair and when I put it up it takes up the room.  Very comfortable. Going to take on long trip, will update when I get back."
5.0,"Was unsure after reading other posts, but I'm pleasantly surprised! 5'9 size 8/10 and it fits great but would look great plus or minus a few pounds' the length might be an issue for someone shorter. The fabric is kinda like nylon, but feels nice and hangs attractively."
5.0,"Arrived on time, good quality.  Definitely would but again."
5.0,Work out @ gym
5.0,"Very soft material. It is thin material, very soft! Not sure how it will hold up in the washing machine yet."
5.0,I liked that the chain did not catch on any of my hair - this is kind of a common problem with necklaces I've purchased online. The beading on the chain was very smooth and it didn't irritate or pull on any of my longish hair. The design was exactly like how it looked in the picture.
5.0,Loved the necklace.
5.0,"Not the warmest pair of running pants that I own, but certainly the least expensive and the useful. This is a medium-weight pant that works well in temperatures as low as 32 with the wind blowing. Very pleased with purchase; I own 2 pairs now."

5.0,Cute and useful scarf

5.0,This is my 3rd time buying these sunglasses. They're my all time favorite.
5.0,Love love love these pants!! Being almost 6 ft tall it is a challenge to find jeans long enough. These wranglers are not only the perfect size but also a 38 inch inseam!! I love that they have a little stretch to them that adds to the comfort and perfect fit! I will definitely buy these again and I recommend them to everyone!!
5.0,Easy to clean.  Can wear in  sunny or cloudy weather while playing pickleball.
5.0,Excellent quality! Perfect for a party or Halloween! Worth every dollar!

5.0,"Super comfortable and warm, but they do run a little big."
5.0,"Fit well, great for light usez"

5.0,Love this hoodie! Super soft and O so cute!
5.0,"WOW!  The quality of this pins are amazing.  They are a nicer than expected, bigger than a half dollar coin.  I will be using them for invitations for my 40th Bday-Chanel theme.  This will make a nice keepsake for my guests too.  Do it!"

It came with two molds, very explanatory instructions for use, other helpful tips for best outcome, and a cute gift from the seller! I would definitely buy from this seller again. The shipping was also much quicker than estimated (est. between Sept. 14-22, received Sept. 4th). One of my favorite purchases as a resin artist thus far."
5.0,The shoes fit as expected. However my boy grew so quickly that I had to get one size up. So I ended up returning and ordering 1 size bigger.

5.0,"Love the cross and bling, I have had many compliments, good price for the quality."
5.0,Feels good. It was tight at first but it seems to have broken in and loosened up.
5.0,"I am only writing a review because I was surprised by the coat. It's true to the size. I am a 2XL, weigh 240 pounds, I thought this might be a little tight but I can wear a hoodie under it and zip it up and it's comfortable.  Also! I live in a very cold climate. Yesterday was -16 and this jacket actually kept me warm, not just slightly, I was warm all day. Very warm coat, great plus size option. And it's really cute."
5.0,They came really fast and I was surprised by the quality of them. I totally loved them! I would recommend to anyone
5.0,I love it i received so many compliments.
5.0,"I purchased these gloves in conjunction to a Fnova 47-inch Aluminum Snake Tong.  We recently moved to rural grassland area with lots of wonderful critters, including rattlesnakes. These gloves provide that extra protection needed when wrangling rattlesnakes out of the carport or garden. They are heavy duty and long enough to reach the elbow.  They also worked well when I had to pick up an injured bat.  They have been very handy. I'm very glad I purchased them."
5.0,This bra is awesome. Provides great support and is sexy.
5.0,I bought these sunglasses for my son who plays baseball and he loves them.  Since it's getting warmer outside and sunnier they really help.

5.0,"Bought these to take my kids to their first Indy 500. They are 5.5 and almost 3, and they worked exactly as I hoped. Despite incredible heat, the kids kept them on all day and definitely enjoyed the loud and crazy environment more for having them on. They didn't complain about them at all and I am very happy with the purchase. They can even fit a small to medium sized adult head."
5.0,"Bought as a gift.  Looks more expensive and more important, the person I gave it to, loves it."

5.0,If it fits over your hand this is a great item! I appreciate the surface etchings and the strength of the material. I would recommend or buy as a gift with no hesitation.
5.0,Nice Scarf
5.0,smaller than expected but pretty very pretty. fits perfect
5.0,"My new favorite travel dress! Flattering, if a little big in the waist and full in the hips and skirt. I bought a black medium, and despite having a large bustthe dress still fit well up top. The length just hits the top of my knee and doesn't expose my bra straps, so I'm super happy with that. The material is a bit thicker then their other dresses, making it great for cooler weather, and it's still incredibly comfortable. I always try to line dry all my Toad&Co/Horny Toad products so they don't shrink. I've never had an issue with wrinkling with like drying anything from them either. The dress looks great with boots or flats, and I really like the pockets. I haven't put anything in them besides my hands, but given the fullness of the skirt it looks like it will still hang well with something else in there; like a wallet. For sizing purposes I'm 5'3&#34; with a 34DDD, 31 and 39 inch measurements, and I bought a medium in black."
5.0,Loved these and bought two pair because I wear them so often!
5.0,Perfect for my granddaughter's birthday ! Love it !!
5.0,Great looking silver band. It was easy to remove pins to make it smaller with enclosed tool. Love it!
5.0,Most durable and vision friendly readers I have ever used.  I order a pair occasionally to make sure I have a pair handy at all times.<br />Just great and also very comfortable to wear!
5.0,They are perfect. Fit well. They are doing what I got them for. My dermatologist suggested them for my capillary leakage in my legs. They have reduced the discoloration significantly. So far holding up well even after several washings. I have ordered two more of this pair and one other pattern.
5.0,Love it! Got so many compliments! I'm 5'7 about 180 lbs. I ordered a XL fit great!
5.0,It's very cute! Very soft material. Fits well. Just remember it's almost a belly shirt.
5.0,I absolutely love this dress! Fits my curves just right. Perfect for a busty and curvy girl. I wear a size 18 and bought the 3x. Will buy again!
5.0,Very durable and classy.
5.0,"Sunglasses are authentic Dolce &amp; Gabbana and arrived on time and in new, perfect condition.  They had all of the original packaging included and are very stylish and sophisticated cat-eye style sunglasses."

5.0,Love them! My son has photosensitivity and needs sunglasses when outside and these are perfect. He loves them and so do we :)
5.0,"I love how small it is, but the pendant feels sturdy. Adjustable clasp helps too, in case I want to wear it longer or shorter. Definitely recommend!"
5.0,"I deliver food.  These bags are super great. I put the actual bags of food inside, zip the top. The handles are great , easy to carry, they look good when you walk up the pathway like you've got your act together! they keep food nicely warm and nicely cold. Super easy. Makes carrying food so much easier!"
5.0,"I've tried a handful of sub $10 price range amazon glasses and I have to say this one is by far the best I've tried. It's actually cheaper than $10, isn't obnoxiously oversized (they are still on the large leaning end), and the lenses are plastic (as expected of cheap glasses) but block sun very well and make a very pleasant view (though not good for phone use).<br /><br />Look is retro, though I wish the curve at the top of the frame was convex instead of concave. For $8 can't be beat"
5.0,Love the quality ordered in two different colors. The material is great.
5.0,I am a Swiss Watch Collector and have many costing thousands more but this watch takes over any of them due to its incredible price. this is a Real Man's watch so if you have baby size wrists or you prefer a more feminine or delicate watch this is not for you. it compares in size and feel to a Breitling Seawolf if you are familiar with it.<br />except costing thousands less.<br />the I.N.O.X line comes in different sizes so pick your flavor before you buy. as for me this is my sweet spot.<br />Beautiful looking watch that makes no excuses and an incredible value. my new every day wear favorite!<br />Highly recommend!<br />disclaimer. I was not paid for this review in any way and I've purchased with my own money.
5.0,"This is a very nice umbrella. It has a good quality feel to it. Yes, it’s on the pricey side but what do you expect when your paying for BMW OEM brand. If you don’t mind spending the money this is a very nice umbrella to keep in your BMW."
5.0,"This cloth is exactly what I needed to clean my jewelry. It polishes and clean s any type of metal and it being a cloth helps with its flexibility to work with any item I.e. rings, necklaces, earrings, and bracelets. Absolutely worth purchasing!"
5.0,can’t imagine life without amber beads
5.0,"I love my top, it’s so comfortable!"
5.0,"Very cute, my 2 year old loves to wear them, lights up as expected and sturdy."
5.0,Loved it. Worked well on my luggage keeping the bottom tucked in. My luggage on the bottom when standing sticks out because of all the weight but with this strap it held it in. It also help me recognize my luggage quickly when getting off the conveyor belt.
5.0,"This scrub cap fits well.  It has some elastic so it isn't too tight.  I can either tuck in my hair in, under it or wear a pony tail and I still have room, my head doesn't feel trapped.  I received the package on time and in good condition.  I would buy this cap again!"
5.0,Very sturdy and nice
5.0,I bought two colors. Size small. I love the fit. The price was great and many colors to choose
5.0,"This MEDIUM Jacket fit me tight on the arms (especially the forearms) and loose on the torso.  I am 6'-1"", 165 lbs with a 39"" chest and 32"" waist.  I wear a 2mm vest underneath this jacket and still it's loose in the torso.  Nice jacket with a plastic (no corrosion) zipper.  Wish I could get it tailored.  Best of luck!"
5.0,Bought this sarong to take with me to Hawaii soon and it’s so beautiful! Such pretty colors! I’d highly recommend!
5.0,So comfortable and cute I get compliments any time I wear it
5.0,"When I first got them, I didn’t think they would stay on. I answer the phone all day long and they stayed on, I even forgot they were there until someone complimented me on them. I’m going to buy every color! You won’t be disappointed😊"
5.0,Love this.. how can it be so cheap when it looks so good? So worth it :)
5.0,REALLY THEY WERE ENCHANTED WITH MY PURCHASE AND THE SELLER SUPER WELL AND FAST. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
5.0,"I love these shoe clips, adds elegance to a classic pump."
5.0,Beautiful pieces for jewlery making
5.0,My daughter loved this as a birthday gift.
5.0,Very very cute dress up outfit for my 7 year old! She loves pretending to be Elsa and the different parts to this one are so awesome. It has been washed a couple times so far with no issues. 100% would buy again.
5.0,"First, they are as comfortable as any mask. But, more importantly to me, is the fact that they are disposable. I'm not wearing the same mask over & over like some people do. If I'm going to wear a mask, I want a fresh one every time."
5.0,Cute and stretchy so there is give and not too restricting. Definitely would order again if I needed another pair.
5.0,Love how these leggings! Super comfortable!
5.0,"GET THIS DRESS!  For the price, it’s awesome. It looks really cute on me and is very comfortable. The material is flattering. Great buy!"
5.0,"They are comfortable, fit well."
5.0,"Bought it for a relative, to help her maintain her thinning hair.  She finds it very comfortable to sleep in."
5.0,"The packaging came already opened, but the product was still safely tucked inside. The gloves are super heavy and made out of a really nice metal. They're painted in vibrant colors and seem to be without chip.<br />I got these as a Christmas present for my Apex obsessed boyfriend (Pathfinder is his favorite). He adores them!"
5.0,Decent quality and adjustable....
5.0,charms are great girls gift
5.0,True fit.  Make sure you use the size chart.  Snazzy fedora!

5.0,very very very very good
5.0,My granddaughter loved it...she was reading &#34;little house on the parrie&#34;
5.0,"I love this material, love how it fits.  Was delivered on time.<br />It's meant to fit loose after all its a  shift dress.<br />I would buy it in a different color."
5.0,If you swap bags often for day vs. longer trips this is the perfect companion.  Now I just move my laptop and grid-it and done.  No more sorting out every pocket for each cable to move.
5.0,Fits well & comfortable material.  Wore it bowling and had several comments.
5.0,Wore these for my daughters wedding and they were very comfortable. Didn't pinch or bind. The top did roll down a little bit but not too bad.
5.0,Just as description says
5.0,"Cute, my grandaughter loved ot"
5.0,"I must admit that I was looking for something alternative to pollution masks, considering the wildfires in California and relative smoky environment. But... this scarf is much more.  Elegant and unique. I used with with one of my MUXXN green dresses and it was the perfect combo. Lots of compliments just walking around."
5.0,"Well made, good fit!"
5.0,My husband likes his shirt. I ordered him a 4x instead of a 3x so it is a bit big on him. A 3x would have fit him better but he could tuck it in and it would still look good on him.
5.0,It was a great gift for my grand daughter - she loved it!
5.0,"Very nice, but to heavy!"
5.0,Perfect fit I love my sunglasses and color like ocean
5.0,Great value and my son loved it!  Good quality!
5.0,Loved them for pj's.
5.0,Cutest hat ever !
5.0,"Nice wide toebox, and a wonderful amount of support and cushion beneath my heel and arch.<br />Fantastic value, as opposed to Oofos's (which were always too narrow) overpriced models!<br />These are my new go-to, just wish they'd have more colors for clogs.<br />Flip-flops look great, but seriously aggravate my plantar fasciitis!<br />Love the clogs, now I have something good to  wear in winter!"
5.0,"I don't like to Travel with Big Pocketbooks all the time so this is great if you just have to run and go ...Very Durable..Waterproof, feels thin but perfectly made to hold everything inside !!! Phones,Keys, Pens, Ect."
5.0,"It's very cozy, one size fits all, very comfy to wear around the house all day.. but not very suitable to use when you're fighting your enemies, it's too loose and heavy."
5.0,"I got these for prizes for our campground carnival. The other adult campers love them, so I'm sure the kids are going to also. Our carnival is at our campground and anything that lights up is a winner."
5.0,Such a cute and super soft robe for my daughter! She wears it everywhere in the house!
5.0,If you wear large or xl dont order xl order a xxl
5.0,50% quality rating. Love the strap design and polished hardware. Length is perfect for me and enough to perform the nato tuck. I understand this is a nylon strap that will wear in time but when I buy it new I want it in perfect condition.
5.0,"I really loved these chokers! They looked super small at first, but they got perfectly!"
5.0,"I love my new MYDream Pajamas!  They fit great and are soft, cozy and comfortable!!!  I do not want to get dressed in the morning!!! [[ASIN:B0753598M7 MyDream Women 100% Cotton Soft Cozy Pajamas Set Button Front Long Sleeve Top Sleepwear]]"
5.0,My granddaughter loves this necklace & wears it all the time!!!
5.0,"Work, some had loose fibers that was uncomfortable."
5.0,"Had this since July22, 2019 and it held up amazingly! It’s been through camp trips, family get togethers, going to the lake, (minus all the lockdowns/sheltering in place) in our mini pool, my toddler just running around being a boy lol! It’s been through a lot!! I’m sad that he’s almost to big for it 😭<br />I’ll most likely buy another one 👍🏼💵 it’s cute, blocks unwanted sun exposure, and most importantly my kiddo Loves it💝"
5.0,Crystal Clear at night and no GLARE from on coming traffic...
5.0,If you have nice curves. The material had to much cleang

5.0,"I love my bracelet, good quality and heavy,"
5.0,I was nervous about ordering this purse for fear of it being too small. To my surprise it's not too small but just right for my needs. Thankyou!
5.0,I like loss fiting clothing so ordered this in extra large and love the fit. I am not a large woman around 5' 6&#34; around 140 lbs so returned the large for the extra large. Very light fabric and will go great with beige tones for that dressy summer event.
5.0,"Great item, thank you"
5.0,Husband loved them on his long trip from Ca to Tx
5.0,Worth the money wish they were tighter but would buy or recommend again.

5.0,Fits as expected with adjustable strap. Fast delivery and good quality
5.0,they arrived in good shape seem to be a good product  . The next time I will deal with you guys direct no more amazon
5.0,"I got a 10, I'm usually a women's 7/8. 10 was too big in the waist on the skirt but all I did was sew the buttons so the waist could be tighter and it worked. The shirt was a little loose but washing and drying helped. It also helped the skirt not to be so stiff. I would have gotten away with an 8 but I am still keeping it. Was wondering if maybe the shirt would be too narrow in the shoulder because I'm broad shouldered.<br /><br />You should try ordering your own size in this one!"
5.0,Costume was for our grandson who was a pirate in the children's theater &#34;Peter Pan&#34;.  He loved the costume.
5.0,"beautiful color, keeps good time. if it comes in other colors, I will purchase."
5.0,Work great. Will purchase again as needed.
5.0,"These are the first eyeglass straps I have bought. They hold the glasses well and the glasses don't slip off. finding a use for the purple and reddosh ones is a challenge, but the others are great and well worth the price."
5.0,Bought this for my son and he loved it. It's well made and I have no complaints what so ever. This is for school so we'll see how the durability goes but I think it should be fine. The cost was cheaper than the selling price from other stores ($80.) Happy with this backpack and I'd buy it again.
5.0,My son is a big Star Wars fan and loves these socks.  He's 11 and they fit well.
5.0,"These gloves are very classic. The soft internal material is high quality and the gloves look great. It took a few days to break them in as they arrived stiff, but after a couple wears they move really well! Would highly recommend."
5.0,"I recently have been going thru Cancer treatment and have been SO COLD!!!! So I have been pulling out anything I have to put on and also to put around my neck to KEEP ME WARM!!! I had had a period of time in the past where I was around a number of European people in casual situations, and they always had a scarf with them, many just this size, 20"" by 20"". What they taught me was that the scarf was very versatile for keeping them warm by going around the neck, acting as headgear when the winds were big, becoming a mask if we had local fires, etc., etc., etc. I have used scarves since, but simple cotton is one of my favorite fabrics. I have not yet washed these, but I do believe they will ""bleed"" dye the first time washed, so wash with like colors. I am MUCH WARMER using them!!!"
5.0,Awsm
5.0,"Love my new hat! Delivered as said, would order another in the future."
5.0,Love this product good for your Tim’s I will be ordering this product again
5.0,I love the soft feel of these and the fit of them! I'm ordering a second pair this week.
5.0,"They work great, I load my bar and don’t have to worry about my weights slipping off. Easy to use and very durable"
5.0,"It’s a great casual dress but you can dress it up. I am on the smaller end of a large for a looser fit due to breast size, or max out the med. this large gave me the perfect fit. It is a bit sheer but o ordered the red and green so it wasent bad I just wore a slip. Over all they are very cute. I eased them on delicate and dried them hanging. Because they come very wrinkled, but they come super fast."
5.0,"Beautifully made and embroidered with colorful flowers and design. Denim is of nice, thick quality, my neices loved them!"
5.0,Great quality! Buying another pack so I never run out for my daughter.
5.0,Good for toddlers. Very flexible.
5.0,"Honestly i use this dress in different types of ways, i fold in the top to make a skirt then i tuck in the bottom to use as a shirt. This dress is really comfortable and the fabric is soft but also kind of thin. Im 5’1 and i got a medium and the length sat right in the middle of my knees and my waist. This dress also defined my waist a little bit more. This purchase is definitely one to be made."
5.0,Loved this!! Was expecting delivery later than arrival and super excited to have the mask before the movie. Highly recommend
5.0,Warm but not bulky.
5.0,I liked that the details were clear ~ I’ve seen angel pins where the angels looked deformed. They were given as a token of gratitude to some exceptional waitresses and they loved them
5.0,"Love it! Fit great, modest but cute! May buy in another color!"
5.0,These gloves look and feel great.
5.0,Great fit and arrived quickly
5.0,Very happy as long as it stays shiny and doesn't turn me green I'll be a very very happy girl!
5.0,I love it so I keep it runs bit big
5.0,Loved the dress!  It was exactly as described and sizing was spot on! Very comfy and exactly what I wanted! Came very quickly too!  Would order from this seller again.
5.0,Got this hat for work to dress up for Halloween. Got lots of compliments  my head is big. So I was surprised that it actually fit.
5.0,For three shirts the price couldn’t be beat. I’m 5’9 180 and the mediums fit my frame well.
5.0,It's exactly as advertised & it's nice and suede-y soft!
5.0,Just like ones I use to own in the 80's.
5.0,Best Reading Glasses ever at this price . Will most likely buy 2 more pair .
5.0,Me gustó mucho algo que me gustó también Y es que es una buena tela
5.0,Beautiful Checkbook cover!
5.0,"Great Value,  Cozy Teen loved them."
5.0,This messenger bag is awesome! Great quality especially for the price! Highly recommend!
5.0,"I finally found a shirt that my husband considers warm enough. He is 75-years old and on medication that makes him feel cold all the time. He does wear sweat shirts, sweaters, etc, but only needs this shirt for warmth. AND it looks good.enough to wear even for special occasions.Washes well also."
5.0,I bought this for a female friend.  She's very lean.  About 5' 3&#34; and 95 lbs.  Top was fine but the skirt was very loose.  Fortunately it wasn't purchased to wear outside.  She really loved the feel of the material and the look.  If you or the person you're buying it for will wear it outside it is very short.  Very short ;)  I got black thigh high socks to finish the look and she thought it was a better choice than stockings would have been.
5.0,"This sweater is very cute and body hugging. It's definitely fitted, so order up a size if you don't want it to be tight. I love the snug fit though because this sweater looks so classic tucked into a high waisted pair of pants or skirt."
5.0,Very pretty bracelet. I have a funky wrist due to surgeries; this stretched enough over scarring and deformity to hide them both. On the good wrist it is spectacular. It is quite colorful and will go with many of my outfits. I love Bohemian style jewelry so this is a great addition to my collection.
5.0,I love these laces- they are on all my kids shoes! Makes getting out the door fast and easy!
5.0,"Got a L, which is what I wear in Jr fit. Fits like the girl on picture, Neck is slightly big. Can't see either bra strap if straight."
5.0,Love it. Gives me curves and feels wonderful!
5.0,"The dress is great, looking forward to wearing it at festival.  It is exactly as pictured.  Comfortable material."
5.0,Love the color and fit.  Have used it for a few weeks now and haven't seen any stretching or fading.
5.0,It’s cute and it fits perfectly :) I love it. My only beef with this earring was that one of the little turquoise studs had fallen out but luckily it was still in the baggy. Nothing a little bit of superglue won’t fix.
5.0,It came in a very cute case and protective packaging ..my son loves them he’s 4 so it’s hard to find anything in stock at target especially accessories but these pair of glasses are super sturdy and great price too!
5.0,"Love the fit, a bit transparent. Nice romper."
5.0,"I love this dress, and MakeMeChic’s customer service is wonderful!  This was my second order of this dress, the first one went to the wrong address and the company immediately issued a refund—no argument, no questions, no hassle.  Outstanding!<br /><br />The dress is heavy stretch velvet.  It’s generously cut, but is designed so that it doesn’t look like a muumuu.  It’s long enough for my 5’9” frame wearing heels.  It’s thick enough to not require a slip, and it feels luxurious to wear.  The simple design is the perfect showcase for dramatic jewelry and/or shawls and scarves.  Win all around.<br /><br />This is my holiday party dress, and I can’t wait to wear it!"
5.0,This top fits me perfectly it goes long sleeve for me as well. Very comfortable and keeps me warm for this weather
5.0,"My daughter loves owls.  She thinks they are beautiful and very interesting animals.  When I saw these earrings I knew that she would love them. The first thing I noticed right away is that they are very light weight.  I have had many earrings in the past that are nice looking but too heavy to wear because the weight hurts my ears.  These earrings do not weigh too much or hurt at all.  The Owl Earrings are very nice looking.  You can tell right away that they are owls.  The hang nicely on your ears and look very nice on when you are wearing them.  My daughter has had many compliments on these owl earrings.  She loves wearing them.  They can be paired with jeans and tennis shoes and yet wear them with a fancy dress.  Either fancy or casual these earrings would be good.  The earrings would be a perfect gift for someone or keep them yourself.  I am very happy that I got these owl earrings.  I received a discount on this product in a special promotion. My review, my opinion and experience is honest and 100% genuine."
5.0,Good quality wood
5.0,I purchased this for my son after he saw his uncle wear one. Very unique and adds a little more style to an already signature look!
5.0,"I had bought 5 Pandora Charms for my wife's birthday, you would thought that I had given her pure gold she loved they so much.<br />So when she is happy with an Item then I know that it is great.  The thing I liked about them was the speed by which I received them not only did they come fast but they were 3 days earlier than promised which is always great. My feeling is better early than late.<br />The charms themselves were very nice and the price was great. I can't say enough good about Amazon and there products."
5.0,"Great my only minor problem is that the cable charge port is hard to hide , anyway totally recommend it for kids."
5.0,100% Confiable
5.0,Easy to get on off. Comfy to wear. Best shorts I have had in years and years. Thank you!
5.0,nice glasses and fit comfortable
5.0,Super pretty necklace and good quality!
5.0,"So far I have not found anything about these masks that I don't like. I got a floral set. The colors are better than pictured. They washed up well, they are well made, they are adjustable and comfortable. I love the extra chin piece, for a better fit.<br />I feel good about protecting others as well as myself when I wear them.<br />They are priced right.<br />Thank you for making a great product."
5.0,"These fit my picky 12 year very well. Colors are good, not obnoxious."
5.0,It's very fast delivery to customer and I love it!
5.0,Gotta love the look. Quite the warmth as well
5.0,I bought this for some else as a Christmas gift.
5.0,Love them!!! I have big cheeks so it’s just what I was looking for. Great packaging too! Comes with a very stylish case! Cant wait for the sun!!!!
5.0,This mask is SO comfortable. Definitely my one of my favorites that I own. And I love that it has  a pocket for a filter too. And the versatility of the chains is amazing! I ordered 2 more masks and another chain. HIGHLY recommend.
5.0,Very cute dress. I have a few more pounds to loose so I can fit into the dress.
5.0,"There were no other reviews, but these looked so well priced.  I am normally a size six or eight which would be a medium. A little voice said “get the large”, I’m glad I did, they fit perfectly and are well made and comfortable. Thank you"
5.0,I was very happy with the way they handled a problem I had. I would definitely  recommend them fir good products and especially their service.
5.0,I liked that an extra pair of arch supports came with the slippers!
5.0,Love Vuarnets! First pair that I have owned in 35 years.
5.0,grandson likes it
5.0,"I just received my bag and really like it.  Seems really well made. Inside has little pockets on each side for cell phone, pens, business cards or other similar sized items. Lots of space that I am able to put many things in there.  I am petite size and this bag does not seem too big for me. Happy with my purchase."
5.0,"I love this! the straps are stretchy and fit well without being tight. It looks super cute on, I got several compliments."
5.0,"These are so soft, I'll be getting more"
5.0,This outfit of one of 5 that I ordered.  This particular gown was my favorite because of the fit.  It was more form fitting and the print is very pretty.  Delivery was quick .  I would order again from this company.
5.0,This is really helpful when wearing a mask. I like the price. It’s cost effective. The design is good too.
5.0,"I needed something for hiking, this fit the bill perfectly.  It's stretchy enough to not be tight and is lightweight as not to feel heavy on my head. I would call this pink more coral, but either way it is easy to spot while I am hiking."
5.0,just gorgeous! Just like a pandora
5.0,I love it!  nothing Wrong with it. It is exactly as described. If you have a bigger wrist it may not fit
5.0,Love them they are really nice
5.0,Perfect!! I got gypped on a watch I bought. Supposed to be ceramic and is rubber.  Couldn't get any satisfaction so when I saw your band I was so happy. It looks wonderful on my beautiful Bulova.  Thanks
5.0,Beautiful dress! Fits perfect
5.0,"Super cute and stretchy. I ordered an XL not sure if it would fit b/c I’m huge right now.. I’m 34 weeks pregnant/ 198.lbs 5’1 and nothing fits besides leggings.. it’s getting hot though so I decided to see if a midi dress will fit, for the price it’s great and super stretchy. I’m sure it will still fit after I have baby and loose the weight as well. The fabric isn’t super thick so it’s nice and cool but not see through and the trim around top has some kind of sticky feeling trim so it won’t slip down. Great buy I will defiantly buy more in other colors for future wear."
5.0,Nice quality. Well packaged.
5.0,"With Athena and one side and the owl for wisdom on the other, this key chain based on the ancient tetradrachm coin seems very sturdy and just what I was looking for!"
5.0,"Loved this dress! Great material, great cut and fit."
5.0,I received my dress super super fast and was very happy with the quality of it it fit me perfect and I got lots of compliments on it I absolutely love it !!!! I will definitely purchase more from you again thank you so much
5.0,"It's beautiful, returned dues to size...sized up but was still too small."
5.0,Great design. Love the look.
5.0,"Great shirt, semi-see through fabric. Looks like you got it in Brazil or Morocco.  If you wear it like the model guy does, you'll get lots of compliments, but you can also roll the sleeves up and button them to stay cuffed. BUT ORDER A SIZE LARGER THAN YOU NORMALLY WOULD WEAR.  I usually wear a large, ordered XL, and it still a little on the snug side."
5.0,Best glasses ever!!
5.0,These work really well.  I was a little skeptical.  doesnt survive many handwashings though!  but my rings dont budge.
5.0,This scrub cap has a sweat band in the front that not only keeps the sweat from your eyes but also seems to make it a bit cooler inside. I will be buying more from this designer/manufacturer.
5.0,Love these though one of my four pairs is too large. Can't explain that.
5.0,It was better than I expected!!! Loved it!
5.0,Grandson loves these PJ’s
5.0,Fabulous! !!!!
5.0,"The product came quickly and is a very good buy, especially compared to prices from Sears or Penneys for far fewer extenders. However, 10 is a lot of collar extenders. I expect to will some to my grandkids."
5.0,"I'm a 34i and fit into 8/10 dresses -- I ordered a medium and it is PERFECT. I can't wait to wear it to my rehearsal dinner!! I think in order to make it look classy you need to put a belt on under the bust unless you're going for a laid back, beachy vibe. Highly recommend trying this dress!!"
5.0,It honestly a little smaller than I thought but not too small of that makes sense. About the size of a dime! My girlfriend loved it so much and wears it everyday☺️
5.0,This necklace was very pretty in person. My daughter gave it to a friend of hers in marching band. Perfect gift!
5.0,Great dress for my daughter. Fit and quality was great.
5.0,Loved the watch! I have big wrists and it fits perfectly!
5.0,I love that they are not too dark. I'd buy again.
5.0,nice material. nice fit. look great
5.0,"This was for my daughter who is heavier. She can wear a 16 girls, or medium in juniors. This fit her nicely. She is short, so it was floor length, and the sleeves were still 3/4 length.<br />This is a heavy fabric. Made of Rayon. It washed well, but the seams appear to be becoming wavy. Make sure that you use low heat for drying, or air dry it."
5.0,Please order on my prome card. Cherry  Heath
5.0,these guys make really great products that last. This on is my 3rd in about 10 years
5.0,Best ones I found. They fit perfectly and are the perfect length.

5.0,Very pleased with these earrings.  Recommend them.
5.0,"Very sturdy and good looking watch, has bluetooth that can connect to your phone.  Name sure you use the right app, had to download a new gshock app instead of the older one"
5.0,"Fits great so comfortable. Straps are thin black elastic bits. It's great for bumming around the house or yard, or even working out. Would definitely buy more. Great for the price. I got the green, blue and black. Blue is like a slightly grey blue."
5.0,My husband loves this jacket.  It is lightweight and perfect for the Florida lifestyle.
5.0,Spent most of the winter in this shirt. Should have bought 2.
5.0,"I purchased this bracelet watch band for my wife and found it to be exactly what I had hoped. The bracelet is not cheap, as it has some weight to it. It was very easy to install."
5.0,gorgeous.  really nice.  Be careful taken it off.  the charms do not screw on (as with Pandora items); therefore your charms will fall off chain.
5.0,Oh these are simply wonderful for the winter and not too heavy but just right!
5.0,we love it.
5.0,So sexy and comfortable
5.0,"These are so cute!<br /><br />when I took these out of the package I was pleasantly surprised at how cute and well made they are, because you cant see them that well in the pictures. The lace on them is a thick, nice lace so there are no worries of it ripping up the first time you wash or wear them. The sock itself is well made with good stitching and there is a band at the top and bottom so they wont ride up when you wear them. They are also plenty long to stay tucked inside any boot, I didn't measure them but they are about 6 inches or so..<br /><br />I bought the light grey and I love the color. With the buttons, lace, and cute design these dress up your outfit so cute. I got these for my daughter but I was tempted to keep them for me.<br /><br />I received these at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."
5.0,"This dress is amazing. I get compliments every time I wear it. Love, love, LOVE this dress!!!"
5.0,I have not taken it off since I put it on the day I got it.  It is so light weight and comfortable I just leave it on all the time.  I have even worn other bracelets with it at the same time.  It is adjustable so if you have a small wrist you can wear it without having links taken out.  Does not tarnish because of the platinum coating on top of the silver.  It is always shiny.
5.0,"I LOVE this necklace! It’s the perfect length and the colors are bright and go really well with the silver! So delicate and cute, great present!"
5.0,Cute coat very stylish
5.0,I love these! Fit great and are exactly like the shorts from the ‘97-‘98 season. Great for any Bulls fan!
5.0,"Great earrings, You don't have to worry about the backs coming off or getting the earring post pushed in to the skin..causing discomfort. Btw I have sensitive skin these do not bother me.I love these and I  highly recommend them. Can we get more sizes and colors? Ty"
5.0,VERY reasonable price for the quality. I rate their quality similar to Road Runner Sports DryMax at 1/2 the price.
5.0,"Love these cute spirals, larger enough to be a good show."
5.0,"Beautiful! Comfortable! Fit perfectly! It is a little thin, but that's fine by me. It's longer than I thought-- I'm 5'7&#34;, and it reaches a few inches above my knees. Despite that, I'm so happy with this skirt!!!"
5.0,Love it! Very pretty jewelry!
5.0,I love those...very stylish
5.0,This watch band is dressy enough for an evening out or perfect for casual activities. The color matches everything.
5.0,"I really lucked out with this one.<br /><br />The cut and fit of this dress were perfect for me, and it seems much more well made than most of the junky cheap fast fashion on Amazon."
5.0,Delivered quickly.  Band fits comfortably.
5.0,It is a lot of bang for the buck.
5.0,"I've reviewed the grey smoke version of these and the unpolarized darker version as well.  If you read those you'll know I love these glasses.  I tend to prefer these amber lenses for fishing, as well as driving, especially with oblique sun or on a hazy day when there's still plenty of UV and glare but not so much brightness.  This colour really brings out depth and takes strain off the eye.  They are a very durable, and full-coverage set of glasses, and the value is unmatched by any other sun or safety glass I have used.  The drug-store sunglasses (even polarized) just don't have the durability to last (at least in my experience), and the more expensive name brand glasses may be equal in terms of quality and coverage, but the cost makes them unsuitable to keep spares of or to use when, for instance, using a chainsaw or grinding.  As I mentioned with the grey smoke version review, the nose pads tend to twist loose on the frame posts.  This could be a big problem, but I just use a bit of 800-grit sandpaper on the posts to get some good texture and use polyurethane glue (gorilla glue) on the post to hold them on permanently.  All my polarized glasses have this mod and they work fine for .. almost a year now.  I have used shoe goop in the past with equal success, but it's a bit messier.  The non-polarized version of these glasses don't have that issue due to slightly different construction design."
5.0,"Got them as a gift for someone, the size ran true, and I was told they keep hands warm and dry in the snow."
5.0,It's just a little big if you don't have long hair like me.
5.0,"My kids (10 &11) wanted matching Nezuko and Tanjuro backpacks and pins for school, and they were a hit! Lots of compliments, and the quality of the pin is holding up very well with all their school books crammed inside. Very well worth the purchase.<br /><br />Note: It took about 2 weeks to arrive. Plan ahead!"
5.0,"The Faybox Women's Sexy Lace Lingerie Baby Dolls Short Dress is just as described by the seller. It is a silky, satiny type material with lace around the bust and bottom. It has a pretty pink bow in the middle of the bust and pink adjustable straits. I love that the straps are adjustable. It covers very well over my bust, which I like. It is so soft and smooth. I love the black and white polka dots!!<br /><br />I purchased this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion."
5.0,I purchased this for my wife and she loves it.  No more getting soaked by the rain when getting in the car.  Someone should have thought of this years ago.  Great idea and a great product.
5.0,"Quality material, fit true to size and no shrinkage in the wash. I usually dislike the fitted shirts that are itchy and uncomfortably fitted to the skin after sweat but that is not this product what so ever."
5.0,I love these shoes has gotten a lot of compliments on them. They are kinda heavy but not extremely. They are true to size so order your show size i got a 6.5 and I’m usually a 6 so not so used to bigger shoes.<br />But i love them and i can now be at work comfortable and looking cute lol. I recommend these shoes! You won’t be disappointed.
5.0,Need need minor alterations but love it!!

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:1a4d7e30f3bc1d132a3cedac4ba4f2f2]] These are super pretty. These are 4mm, which to me is really for little girls ears."
5.0,Fit great. Death from above.  82nd Airborne Division
5.0,"I loved everything about these reading glasses! The price is excellent! I was looking for a pair with blue light protection in my pharmacy and they wanted over $34 bucks! I decided to go on Amazon and I found these. I was super excited to receive them. They are a nice larger size than the store bought ones, yet not too over sized. I love the purple color. They have helped my blurred vision tremendously! I was having real issues looking at my phone and tablet and even TV. Since I received them, I haven't had the issue. My eyes feel much more rested. I wish you had them with no strength to use while watching TV. I'd buy them again for certain if anything happened to the pair I currently have. They look like quality glasses. Even my husband commented I look sexy in them, and I'm 56! I absolutely love these. Nothing to dislike. They are also pretty lightweight on my face.  They make reading a pleasure again. Everything is larger and so much clearer I don't need to strain. I hadn't realized how much I was straining my eyes. Thank you Amazon for having these! I LOVE THEM!"
5.0,A very comfortable hat for a great price.

5.0,See my review for the matching bra.  Overall my wife really likes this brand.  They are sexy and feminine and are well made.  I really enjoy seeing her wearing matching bras and panties that our feminine and comfortable.  They are a bit pricey and it sometimes is difficult to find the matching bra and panty from the same source.

5.0,Beautiful necklace with a great chain.  Fast shipping!  Very satisfied with product and seller!

5.0,"The Glo Bag is an amazing gym locker bag. I am thrilled with mine. It has very comfortable straps that don't pull on your back or shoulders. The bag easily slips into a gym locker and has loops for easy hanging. You can then unzip the side of bag which opens to a completely organized system. There is a top compartment for clothes, a shelf for shoes, and below that is another shelf for a wetpack and/or accessories. The sides of the bag have very functional pockets. The designers thought of every last detail with this bag. I love it!!!"

5.0,Perfect fit for a little 11 year old Yankee fan 👍 👦 ⚾ 😂
5.0,"My favorite scrub pants by far now!!! I used to swear by another brand, and nothing compares to the fit and comfort of these. I'm 5'8&#34;, and have a booty so pants fit me weird sometimes. I bought these without trying them on, and they fit perfect. Also the Yoga top means no but crack hanging out during a long Nursing shift. I recommend for anyone."
5.0,"This isn't a high class, shiny, make-the-girls-swoon necktie. It's basic, classic and perfect for the price. I was worries about quality before ordering it, but it's quite nice. I definitely made my boyfriend think I spent more on this gift than I actually did ;)"

5.0,"This is an awesome dress. The material is high quality and it is well made. I was very impressed the way it looked. I am 5'1&#34;, 158 pounds, with large hips, big butt and 36DD. I bought an extra large and  it fit nicely. It was bellow my knees about 4 or 5 incles, so I am having it shortened.  I bought it to use for a job interview. Highly recommend and will buy more from Miusol. Great manufacturer.<br />Update: I shortned , that is how it looks after I did."
5.0,These are so adorable! My daughter loves them! Great quality
5.0,Wish I had found these sooner love them. I replaced all the backs on my favorites with these.

5.0,I love dat dress i oder a L
5.0,Awesome. Fits in corner of my glovebox.<br />Is very dry and weighs practically nothing.  Can ft in pocket or in a small pouch in backpack. Hood is nice with the wire frame that forms it the right way to repel water.<br />Only complaint is I bought an extra large and the hand pouches that are attached to it are tiny. They maybe cover top half of fingers. Although I can't imagine using them regardless. So nbd.
5.0,Love the material price and size was perfect thank you
5.0,"I have this belt style in two colors. It's sturdy without being too thick (about 1/8"" thick), and avoids the tactical vibe so common to webbing belts."
5.0,Fit really well! Looked very flattered and nicely covers up the chest area which is the biggest problem with wrap dresses! It's cute and great for the beach!
5.0,Love all of the earrings. They're all beautiful ❤️
5.0,Absolutely beautiful and just the right size

5.0,"Bought this gift as a Christmas present. It arrived days before it was originally supposed to, and it is a beautiful wallet. It is slim and has a nice color. The cards are a little difficult to put in, but it's new and I am assuming it will stretch out. I am pleased with this purchase and would recommend this wallet. It does say it is RFID, and I can't say much to the accuracy of that, but hey, it is a nice wallet anyway."
5.0,"Super satisfied , highly recommended !"
5.0,It is inexpensive and it is super nice.
5.0,"Nice cover. Not 20 anymore, this one is decent at hiding body imperfections."

5.0,the are beautiful and sturdy. No backs come with it. So I had to buy some. Had one of the earrings slide out while playing with kids. Don't want that to happen and loose them.<br />Very nice...better than picture
5.0,"I love it I want to order more it's comfy, long perfect for light cool weather it's perfect for around the house use or to wear to run errands,  it stretches, I love the hoodie I would recommend to buy if you like long, stretchy cardigans, I can't wait till it starts to cool down more."
5.0,Work safety shirt
5.0,I'm 190 and xlarge fits great.  Loved the look and loved feel of fabric. Perfect for Florida weather on vacation!

5.0,Just what I needed for my project.
5.0,Very hip but light !!
5.0,"Cute and soft, pockets aren't in normal spots and don't like how you can not button or zip up"
5.0,I adore these off-the-shoulder tops.  I have them in two colors.  I like them because there is enough ruching that the bottom half of the shirt doesn't stick out too much. That way it doesn't look like a maternity top.  The material is really nice too!
5.0,I ordered these because in summer time I don't like wear big earing and these looked to be pretty.<br />I was impressed when I received them because not only were they pretty they are very high quality stainless steel..and that's a bonus for me because I have sensitive skin.  I did receive the earrings at a discount in exchange for an honest..and in no way is my review affected by that.<br />I have been wearing them for over a week and have not had any pain or irritation at all.. I usually have that problem with low quality jewelry
5.0,This skirt fits adorable! It's girly but still classy. Could you be worn more casually with a casual top and jean jacket OR dressed up with heels. It can go from day to night easily too. I love the material and the way it drapes. I got a small and I am 5'1 and 126 pounds.  LOVE LOVE LOVE>
5.0,Absolutely LOVE IT!
5.0,"A bit smaller than expected, but it makes it work! i love it."
5.0,"I was very happy with my top! It came quickly and looks great. Size wise it was perfect for me. I'm a B cup and this top has some padding so I ended up looking like a D cup, which was good for me! I did reinforce one of my straps because it seemed weak and I'm usually rough with clothes. Nothing a little hand sewing couldn't fix. Overall a good buy for a great price."
5.0,"These quickly became my favorite pajamas! I now own a few of them! So soft, comfortable and wash well! Such a great find!"
5.0,Beautiful. Exactly what I was looking for
5.0,Love these but they run small!
5.0,"Bought this for my wife as I was happy to see something offered in her size (XS) and I am very happy I did!  It is the perfect mix of simple design with naughty see through portions. This stuck the perfect balance of being ultra erotic without appearing cheap or slutty. When she put it on for the first time, I knew I had made the right purchase!  Sexy as sexy could be!!  I'm literally begging her to wear it in public with me to a night club or on our next vacation to the tropics!  It is not very often that I find lingerie to be so alluring that it remains in place during intimacy, but that is exactly what took place!  Because the straps are tied, it is easily adjusted for the right height/fit.  The material is sheer in all the right places but is not fragile and easily torn.  Despite being a full length gown, it folds to a tight compact size that is easy for packing/storing.<br /><br />Ladies, if you are looking for something to command your lovers attention without a lot of extra effort involved with snaps and extra pieces, this is it!  My bride literally went from boring every day clothes to holy-smokes-that-is-sexy-as-I-have-ever-dreamed in less than a minute!<br /><br />Shipping was discreet and as expected, arriving earlier than we expected.  We will almost certainly be buying from this vendor again.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

5.0,Great hoodie true to size.  Son wanted something washed out was happy.  I liked also very soft.

5.0,Nothing i disliked bout the product. I just accidentally ordered two and when i went to return the extra product it was an easy process.
5.0,I love to neon color and the material. Great for  hot weather
5.0,The shoes arived on time and they fitt PERFECT!
5.0,This dress fitted perfectly.  I am a size 16/18 and bought an xxl. It is very cute and comfortable and the right length.
5.0,Did not dislike anything.
5.0,It looks just like the picture and came quickly. The material is good quality and lightweight but got snagged easily. I am 5'6 and 145 pounds with 38DD's so I was skeptical about ordering a dress online. I ordered a size 12/XXL and it fit just fine (just a tiny bit loose). This dress is very flattering and so comfortable. I highly recommend it.
5.0,These were really cute. My daughter loves them and has them all over her backpack.
5.0,Bought for my bonus daughter for her graduation from high school card from her Dad and I. She absolutely loved it! She said I’m keeping this card with me through college so I can re-read it! It’s very wise words and advice!
5.0,"Loved the feel of these gloves. Quality was evident and fit wonderfully. Bought as a gift, will be getting a pair for myself."
5.0,"I love these, I have similar ones from a local clothing store and I wanted more. I knew what to expect because I own several but be aware for those that don’t own a pair of these… the pockets are not real, the pockets look drawn on and really really fake so you won’t be able to wear short tops with these. I love them because I always wear long tops that cover my booty and they look like real jeans once the pockets are covered. The material is almost like leggings. I’m a 2X/3x and the biggest size fit me."
5.0,Beautiful dress!! Love the fabric.. washes well and doesn’t wrinkle.
5.0,Seems to fit well. I like it very much.
5.0,Cheaply made but it was also cheaply priced. I got this to go with my batgirl costume and it worked rather well. It was cute but I'm not sure if I would wear it for reals or not.
5.0,large and roomy but not to large really like it
5.0,My Mom love this... I bought her two more.
5.0,Cool hat.  Well built.  Perfect for dangling the Bitcoin Logo in other people's faces.  Good conversation starter.  Especially at a Goldman Sachs company picnic.

5.0,This is a great ring and a really great deal!!! Better than expected
5.0,Sooooo soft! Love the feel and style.
5.0,style is perfect
5.0,"First time seeing it and it looking so nice.  the holes were not on the right place on my waist but It included the hole puncher which is handy to punch the hole where you need it.  You just need to mark the exact place where it fit you the most and punch it with the hole puncher.  You might need to get a hammer or something hard to hit the hole puncher with.  Its easy to put on and fit me perfectly.  I have no problem with this and the only problem I have is the pre punch holes were not on point with my waist other than that its nearly perfect.  The design was nice and eyes catching. It look nice with every pant that I wears.  I've been wearing it several days and it feel really comfortable.  I can wear it all day and it doesn't fall out or hurt my belly any way.  The material is very sturdy and well built, it is not going to fall out anytime soon.  I love it.<br /><br />Pro.<br />- Well built for long lasting.<br />- Included hole puncher<br />- Nice Design<br />- Fit with any waist, use a hole puncher<br />- Comfortable to wear all day<br /><br />Cons<br />- Pre Punch holes were off on waist 30-33<br />- need to punch holes<br /><br />disclosure: I got this item at a discount/free price for unbiased testing and reviews purposes.  Thanks Seller."

5.0,"I went through the reviews posted by other buyers before deciding to buy this top.And like other happy buyers I'm glad i purchased this top.<br />Its lovely ,the material is soft knit stretch material.A bit low neckline than i prefer but very flattering.The only slight issue which i was not very happy with is the elastic on the waist...Mind you the elastic is not like tight one but slight loose stretch more to give shape ...but since I have big bust..the elastic kinda goes under the bust(i hope that makes sense) while sitting and needs adjistment every now n then...But still its a good addition to my wardrobe.."
5.0,Perfect for covering tanks at work during our 'Summer Casual' dress code. Love it!
5.0,I know this is passe in these times of huge wrist watches but it is actually kind of cool. I bought it to wear when I bike but I wear it other times as well because it is just so easy to live with.
5.0,"Had to make some minor adjustments, front you cannot adjust but I got at steam and tie to make it just a little more snug and not so open. Fits a tad large but it ties in the back. Have other suits but this has been my go to suit this season!"
5.0,we bought this for my pregnant sister and she immediately fell in love with it! the pattern is so gorgeous and it is extremely comfortable! it should be worn casually :)
5.0,"My head circumference/diameter is 21in.-22in. and this hat is perfect i haven't tried it out in the freezing cold yet, but it looks and feels warm enough for winter in Illinois"
5.0,"Great hoodie!!! I’m always nervous to buy clothes online since I’m 5’10”. Plus, a lot of clothes that you buy online but not from major retailers fit really weird or are poor quality. NOT this sweatshirt!!! I was pleasantly surprised and get a TON of compliments every time I wear it. It’s lightweight and comfy. Washes well. Sleeves are long enough!"
5.0,This are beautiful! No need to go to Hawaii to buy one. I’ll show photo but it was a gift nonetheless it was looks like the picture.

5.0,Just what I wanted for my art class.
5.0,Description / pictures very accurate  I actually purchased 4 pairs  with different designs. Very satisfied
5.0,"Terrific bag. Very roomy.  Did not experience the smells other reviewers had. Only complaint and not a deal breaker, the 2 slip pockets are very small.  Took out the middle stitching to make 1 roomy pocket."
5.0,"it is awesome fabric so think and the quality was great, I recommend this to my friend she even order two her self. we love the fit and fabric is worth it for the price."
5.0,Everyday necklace real gold no fading

5.0,Nice gift to give a teacher
5.0,Bought these for my daughter she loves them. There light and you can sleep in them. Well made very pretty.
5.0,My daughter and I both adore this necklace!  It is such a great price for such a great necklace.  We have had it for 7 months now and it still looks brand new.  The chain that came with it is great.  Very happy with this purchase!
5.0,"Very Nice, I had a hard time trying to decide on others that<br />that looked very close in style. I like the automatic GPS mode. I had to get a friend to set it up for me. other than that, very nice."
5.0,Keeps the sun off your face.
5.0,"I purchased the teal color in XS (I'm 5'5"", 93 lbs).  Perfect fit!  Love the teal color!"

5.0,"Love these!!!! All work great!!!! Used on my sweater to keep it together, got lots of compliments."
5.0,Cute and the price makes it all the cuter to me
5.0,"I love GV Amanda jeans, so I was anxious to try Avery pull-ons. They fit well, and are well made. Different from wearing Amandas, so don't expect the same feel, but comfortable and not too long!"
5.0,"LOOK AT HOW CUTE THIS DRESS IS! I was skeptical because I’ve never had belle-like sleeves before but I am IN LOVE! Fits great, feels great, looks great!"
5.0,This dress is outstanding and it is as pretty as it looks on line. I love it.
5.0,This dress fit perfectly.  For me that is the most important thing.<br />This is my fourth dress from Homeyee and I love it.  They are well made and are true to size.  I wouldn't say the material is the best quality but it's great for the price.<br />The dress looks expensive.  Sexy enough to be worn on date night yet modest enough for work.<br />I wish it came in more colors.  I would love it in pink.
5.0,My charm bracelet love it
5.0,"Good quality, fit as expected.  My son loved it"
5.0,My daughter is 7yrs old about 57lbs. Thin athletic built. And it fit like a gem . Love it!
5.0,I love my Dachshund leggings.<br />The fit is greate.
5.0,order one waist size bigger and fits great
5.0,I looove the quality! Whisks away sweat and no blisters. Perfect height and fit around the foot. I like the light weight more than medium or ultra light as it fits best in tennis shoes and is not too thin.
5.0,My son absolutely loves these shoes.  What I love the most is that they can be charged. No batteries needed.  The only thing that I was skeptical about was where the base of the charger is placed.  It is on the inside of the shoe by the ankle.  My son says it does not bother him.  I slide the tongue of the shoe to cover it up so that it does not rub his ankle.  I love the many options of the colors of the lights.  You push a button to change the color.  My son is 5 and wants to wear them to bed!  LOL
5.0,Learning how to walk in them was a challenge. I love them. They are warm and comfortable. Sometimes a bit cumbersome but I am getting used to it.
5.0,Nice heavy chain design. Nice style and shape!<br />*I received this item at a discount for my unbiased review.
5.0,2nd maverix hat. Well made-high quality
5.0,Good quality just enough stretch to it ... Covers just enough and looks really cute on
5.0,Ordered this twice. Once in a Sz 4 too small then in a 5 and it's fairly small as well. This is not a warm hoodie. It's more like a fashionable type shirt that looks like a hoodie. It is cute tho!
5.0,Love these. Excellent for my postpartum body! The pockets are an added bonus
5.0,My daughter and I love this cute bag it seems to be made well and it’s perfect size for her to carry everyday to school!
5.0,"I loved getting four pair at once.  Now that I find I need ""cheater glasses"" for seeing up close it seems I can't ever find them when I need them.  Whichever room I'm in, they're bound to be in the other.  So, I liked getting four pair at one time.  The glasses themselves are rather lightweight so they're comfortable to wear."
5.0,Needed for school and it wasn't uncomfortable and fit perfectly
5.0,"Very good quality! I wear these 24/7 and they are still like new. I was skeptical about the screw back because I have never worn earrings like those, but the have never come loose and they don't poke my head!"
5.0,Very soft and comfortable! I love the positive message!
5.0,"Love, love, love these!!!!!"
5.0,"Ordered them a bit big because my son keeps outgrowing all his Converse. These arrived in time for his birthday party so all was right in the world. Really cool design. Have received many compliments. Lucky to find these, as we bought the replica keychain previously but the actual shoe was discontinued and we were told no custom available. Thank you again Amazon."
5.0,Great quality and perfect size. Lightweight.
5.0,I love this kimono. I ordered it for a work accessory and I wear it nearly everyday. I’m obsessed with the look and feel of it. I want to order a black one but they don’t seem to have it in a regular large.
5.0,"Product is great.  I assumed I needed a larger size by judging other name brand sweatshirts I have worn.  I was wrong.  I should have ordered 3XL instead of 4XL.  The one big draw back of mail ordering clothing whether by Internet or phone: You really should buy them in a bricks and mortar store where you can try on the items to make sure they fit well or to your comfort.  But this fits okay, albeit a bit bigly,  and I am probably better off with a larger size.  After all, it is a sweatshirt and not a dress shirt.  The quality is very good.  The color is sensational.  Nice and black and inky like a silhouette or a blackboard or a '56 Cadillac Fleetwood .  I think this sweatshirt will last me a long time.  It is so comfortable and smart looking that I may even ask to be buried in it.  I don't know what else I can say.  It's a sweatshirt; and it's comfortable.  It is well made and warm.  It is inexpensive at the discount price.  I would not hesitate to purchase it again."
5.0,"I am in love with this hat!  The picture does not do it justice and is not able to show how soft and cozy the hat is.  Additionally it is difficult to see how well the special features of the flap and the ponytail port work.  I bought this hat for horseback riding this winter, after seeing a similar hat on another site that was more than double the price and had a high shipping cost.  I was unsure what to expect quality and size wise.  I ended up with a product that is absolutely amazing and perfect for my winter riding plans, as well as most any other activities I might participate in.  Stylish and well made!  I can't recommend this product highly enough for all those pony tail, ball cap wearing girls out there!"
5.0,Gave this shirt as a gift to my babes father and he loves it!! The print looks perfect snd the colors of the dye don’t run and look incredibly bright and bold!! Love love love!! I will definitely be back again!!
5.0,"I love the little purse. It is great quality, fits all of my cards, a lipstick, change and my S9+ phone. I am not a fan of carrying bulky purses, so this is perfect.  I will definitely be ordering more in different colors."
5.0,Buen reloj. Me gusta mucho el acabado.
5.0,It will be perfect for a small prize at our tropical wedding shower
5.0,very pleased. Elegant looking without the bulk of full leggings.
5.0,They are comfortable and made my legs feel better
5.0,"I am just over 200lbs, VERY pear shaped...50” hips and 37B breasts, I am about 5’5 and a xxl fits fantastically well! It ‘s tight enough in the chest area, but would have fit better if my chest was bigger. This dress just slides over my hips with plenty of room! It hits the top of my flip flop shoes, so no dragging on the floor. This dress can be accessorized well to wear out on a nice evening or casually enough to wear to the beach."
5.0,I purchased this purse last year...and it still looks fantastic.
5.0,It seems to fit more like like a teacher's dress than like what shows on the model but that's my body type I guess.
5.0,"The sturdiness, quality and clarity are excellent. The tint is perfect The price of the glasses are worth the products"
5.0,Everything was as expected  and on time
5.0,Beautiful scarf. Much better in person - great gift.
5.0,Great way to wear a belt and not have to worry about bulky belt buckles
5.0,"I can't get over how cheap this top is. I'm headed to a music festival this summer and this top is PERFECT. Fits perfect and is super cute. It took a looong time to arrive - about a month - so keep that in mind when ordering. I def recommend though! For reference: I am 5'4&#34; and ~130lbs, 34A. My frame is very petite but I am by no means rail thin or anything and I look great in it. I got the small."
5.0,Perfect for Disney trip!
5.0,My mom likes the dress
5.0,"So I was looking for a jacket/vest for my wife as a gift.  She is always cold and packs on the jacket/gloves in the house while she WFH.  I decided to get her something that she can wear and heats up so she doesn't have to be so cold all the time.  We don't turn on the central heat as much due to the crazy bills we'd get so we just pack on more clothes.  This vest was fantastic!  3 heating levels plus it's a nice and fitted as well.  So while I wouldn't run the heat forever, you can tap it off.  It also has an auto off feature if you forget.  TBH you only need it on for a few mins and you can shut it off to save battery but that's up to you.  Overall a great buy and the wife is warm and happy. Happy wife happy life!  I'd also suggest buying a size up as this was a medium and she typically is a small."
5.0,sweet ! I love it . great for hot weather . I can get my Semper Fi on !  well made and not too expensive !

5.0,"These were nice and comfy everyday shoes for my daughter, they were a little big but still wearable."
5.0,"I ordered this Rosary for my son and this is the first time I've seen him so happy about a religious article. He had the priest of our Church blessed it. And he recited his first Hail Mary in front of the Altar holding preciously the Rosary. I love it so much myself and I was about to order one for me as well and one for my sister but I got discourage because the price went up. Anyway I received my son'sRosary real quick  It came with a little pouch to put it so it will fit easily in his pocket. Thank you,"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:80ad022f6aff83239555a80ff6c68be]] This bag looks expensive but the price is great! Cute, great quality and well made! Get it, you won’t be sorry!"

5.0,The items arrived exactly as described and the kids absolutely loved them.
5.0,Daughter loved them! They have stayed on well
5.0,I use it to hang around and feels really comfortable
5.0,Such a nice assortment of charms! I am making jewelry for my poker group and these charms will add a nice looking touch.
5.0,For myself and I absolutely love them.  I think that the lock clasp could be stronger because one of them is not as tight as the other.
5.0,They where great my husband love them
5.0,"A nice ear ring.  Very sturdy, feels good, looks good, great price. A gift he was very pleased with & was delivered in timely manner.  Would definitely recommend to others to buy this product from this retailer."

5.0,"I live in FL so these are perfect the hot weather , they’re very comfy ! This is my second pair . I’m a medium in Men and the first pair I ordered was a 33-34 they fit good but a little too loose for my liking . I ordered a 32 the second time and they fit wayyy better. The length is perfect"
5.0,"Does fit a little big fro my daughter but she will grow in, so far so good"
5.0,My husband loves these socks--comfortable and stylish-looking.
5.0,love them. super comfy. fit to size. highly recommend.
5.0,They fit well and you can just wipe them off
5.0,As described 👍🏻
5.0,"Awesome timing for our event, even with a delay. Everything was awesome!! Thank you."
5.0,Super cute and squishy 🙂 and the metal tunnels don’t lose their color!
5.0,Variety of sizes make it easy for a casual look or a night out!  Love how they clasp in the back as well...
5.0,Very good compression and I love the lace on the sleeve.
5.0,Bought for after breast surgery. Worked wonderfully. Easy to button in front with enough stretch but doesn’t stretch out.  Was very comfortable while recovering.  Will continue to wear after healed.  Washes & dries like a charm.  Highly recommend.
5.0,"I bought to give as a gift and my friend loved it as soon as she saw it. I bought the purple one and it is beautiful, honestly."
5.0,Very professional material
5.0,"Oh my I love this dress so much. It is adorable it is one of my favorite things to wear. I didn’t think it would fit me just yet. I got this for when I lose more weight. However when this came I was super surprised not only does it fit it’s super flowy and looks beautiful.<br /><br /> The only thing I would really change is to have longer straps. I would really prefer it hang a little lower on my chest. Even so I can’t deny how attractive this is. The white is pure white not like an off white. I have to be super careful when I am wearing it not to get anything on it and ruin it. I want this to last as long as possible.<br /><br />The lace design on it is so pretty and very well made. There is not fraying on it or broken spots even after the wash . I do wash this on the delicate cycle as well as dry it on delicate or hang dry it.  The fabric is very soft and the way it moves on your body feels really nice. I’m so in love with this though the style is so interesting and pretty. Very happy with this dress.<br /><br />I received this product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. This does not affect the time, effort and integrity I put into a review that would be beneficial to any fellow customer. I have no relationship with sellers and manufacturers. I base all my reviews on quality, value, and personal experience of the product."
5.0,I love these leggings - will get another pair.  Very comfortable.
5.0,"These are really nice hiking socks. The foot is super soft and had a lot of give to it. This makes them especially nice for people with wide or narrow feet. The upper part is pretty tight, and it's more than just compression. There is not much give to it. Most compression socks that I've seen will stretch no matter how thick the body part (foot or calf) is. I think if you have thick calves, these might be a bit uncomfortable. I don't so they are great for me. I use them for hiking and when winter comes, they will be great for running as well. They go high enough to keep out the cold with out being a full calf-to-knee compression sock. I'm not sure the compression level is very strong, because I don't really care for compression socks but I like these. I think it's just sewn with a tighter weave that doesn't have much stretch. So this allows me to pull them on easily, but I don't have that super pressure feel that some socks have. I don't like to feel like something is grabbing my leg. Gentle pressure like these is enough for me. I think they would be good for long plane rides too.<br /><br />They also have a left and right foot. The design is so they are stretchier around the sole of the foot. There's really no seam around my toes which is great to avoid blisters on long hikes and runs. I like the color for hiking, but it's a bit strange for running because people will see both the blue and the black (unless your leggings are super long, which mine are not). That's ok though. I'm still super happy with these!"
5.0,One of my fave purchases & I buy alot!
5.0,"I bought this for my youngest’s baptism celebration.  It’s a beautiful bracelet, it’s dainty but not flimsy.  The crystals are beautiful and it fit her small wrist well with room to grow.  I would purchase this again as a gift."
5.0,I like theses boxers my favorite pair the quality is good almost the same as underarmour underwear.  I wanted these boxer for over a year now.  I finally bought them and they were so worth it...
5.0,"Very nice. Shiny, bright. Nice bling accessory!"
5.0,Fits perfect! Doesn’t change shape with excessive wear.
5.0,Love these gi's
5.0,It’s cute but the chest are too large😩
5.0,"I usually wear an XL in all clothing, but the one with pink ends was only available in L, so I took my chances and I’m glad I did!<br /><br />It was perfect for my casual kawaii cosplay/my normal fashion tbh//<br />It’s VERY roomy and actually SUPER heavyweight and thick, so it’s good for cooler days and not so much hot days looking cute.<br /><br />The top of the hoodie doesn’t have a collar, but it’s seen together weirdly (idk how to explain)<br /><br />either way it’s something I’ve always wanted and it exceeded my expectations!"
5.0,"This Dress is so sexy and beautiful for the Holidays or Date Night. I am 5'4"", 147lbs with a 38C bust and a bit of hip and saddle bag action going on and I bought a Large and it does have a bit of compression but I may need a shaper just to smooth it a bit. I had not problems with the bust cups and padding. I was able to adjust the straps albite a tad tight but better than having them not stay in place. Very HAPPY with this dress."
5.0,This shirt is great
5.0,"These gloves work great for handling jewelry or art.  I use them for overnight moisturization for my hands.  I have to wear braces on my hands overnight, so I put on lotion, then these gloves, then my braces.  The gloves make the braces much more comfortable, yet they aren't too bulky.  They run small, so take that into consideration.  I have small hands and these fit fine."
5.0,Fits nice and is comfortable. I'm 5'4 weight fluctuates between 190-195 and a large fit great.
5.0,Looks just like the picure. Leather is a little thin.
5.0,"These sandals are flat, but comfortable. Stylish. A great asset to any outfit."
5.0,"I loved the watch<br />I was looking for a watch that looked classy but sporty at the same time, and this tops it for me 👌🏻<br />I love the way it looks<br /><br />The only thing I saw that might be bad for others is that the light isn’t bright enough but then again it’s not something that would bother me<br /><br />Thank you so much 😊"
5.0,fabulous! and super comfortable!
5.0,"My wife loves this.  Perfect fit, and protects the key fob!!"
5.0,"These were nice and warm, fit my teen son well.  No construction problems."
5.0,"Had these for a while and have held up very well. For the price I thought they might break down when washed, but they are still going strong."
5.0,Nice blouses.
5.0,This dress was surprisingly well made for the price. Looks pretty on and can be dressed up with heels and jewelry or down with flip flops or sneakers...I Love it!!!
5.0,Great quality.<br />Beautiful detail.<br />Would buy again.
5.0,"There are a lot of dresses like this on Amazon.  I've ordered them all and kept a few.  This is hands down the best.  It is a nice light silky material with a lining in the skirt.  It's true to size even in the bust and the straps stay put.  The buttons actually button.  Though I wish there was a little button inside the dress at the waist where it gapes a bit.  Nothing a slip can't fix though.  Pockets are adequately sized and length is good.  Just below the knee.  Flattering cut for any figure.  For reference I bought an XL, am 5'8&#34;, 200lbs, 38b, pear shaped. Some of the other dresses you'll check out are funky in various ways.  This one isn't.  Get it."
5.0,Fit my husband well. He is lean and tall.
5.0,I saw one of these at the apple store and thought it would be a great way to organize cords and gear and it is. I bought three different sizes and use them all for different things.
5.0,I got these for my dad for his birthday. He has a race coming up so I thought these would be great for him. He seemed pleased and I was surprised they came with a string so you don't lose them. Good price and so far good quality.
5.0,"THIS is the best belt ever. I work in a warehouse and this fits my needs perfectly. When I started working I was close to 140 lbs but within a month I dropped 20 lbs so my pants all became to big to wear but I couldnt afford new ones that quickly. This is perfect for refitting it , repositioning it for maximum comfort and hold. Its not to wide but not to narrow either. You can put the buckle wherever you feel like having it to secure it wherever needed. LOVE IT.<br />I got to wear it once or twice and it disappeared, Someone else in my house liked it to much to so I bought a second one. Perfect belt."
5.0,"This is beautiful, vibrant and well made"
5.0,Adorable and I get lots of compliments.
5.0,Love the colors and quality of this cap.  I would order it again and give it as a gift.  Go Sooners!!!
5.0,These are great for rainy days

5.0,These glasses was perfect for our holiday in Colorado. They did not fog up once you fit them properly. If they are not properly fit they will fog up. Enjoyed by the entire family.
5.0,Seems to help with the blue light from my computer during the day.
5.0,Fit my one year old fine with room to grow!  We were very pleased. Excellent quality.
5.0,"I got this as a gift for my mom and I think she is going to love it. It is light enough to wear fall or spring, and the pattern is versatile enough to match many different colors. It is soft and seems like great quality."
5.0,Great peoduct and looking to get more. Perfect fit
5.0,"I wear a size small normally but I bought a large due to other people’s comments regarding the fit, and I’m glad I did. I love this sweatshirt. It’s soft and roomy and warm!"
5.0,"I just received these sunglasses today and my first impression was WOW this thing is light. I have a few pairs of Ray Bans and they're heavy on my face. I can't wear them on long trips because it digs into my nose after a little while. These sunglasses are perfect for long trips. I kept them on for a while and it doesn't dig into my nose!! It's nice and snug on the side of my face and when shaking my head, it doesn't even slide off like my Ray Bans. I'll be using this as my daily driver."
5.0,"I use these with open-toe compression stockings. Because they are really snug, I have to ""pull-out"" the toe to give my toes ""wiggle-room""."
5.0,I love my ring I wear it all the time
5.0,"I had a few issues with shipping but customer service was great and handled all the issues. I need to send my daughter's frames for 2 weeks to replace the lenses. My daugher can't be without her glasses that long. Her prescription is +5. I thought about buying new lenses to avoid the wait time. Instead, I decided to see if I could find frames that fit her current lenses. I stumbled upon these. You can tell these frames are a different material than her more expensive frames but it's still really sturdy. The eye doctor was able to pop the lens out of her Zoobug ZB1017 frame and put it in these. I also bought ear hooks for a reasonable price. Both were a fraction of what her other frames cost. Makes me wonder why I'm spending so much on the other frames. Will purchase these in the future."
5.0,"So first off I’m using my boyfriends account, so this review is coming from a girl lol this dress is so beautiful! I wore it to my brothers wedding in Tulum, Mexico in December and it looked fab! I got so many compliments on how pretty and expensive it looked! When I told them I got it on Amazon, their jaw fell to the floor lol This dress fit me like a glove! I’m 5’2, 152lbs, 34C and got a medium. I’ll be ordering different colors soon!"

5.0,I am very happy with them
5.0,Very cute! Fit my 2 year perfectly!
5.0,This top is so cute!  Runs big though.  I normally wear a 3xl and I wear a 1xl in this top.
5.0,Every time I pull this out for a session the reactions are priceless. Beautiful in every way. I purchased the gold but it really has more of a rose gold look.
5.0,Excellent product.  I used the buckles to make a couple of belts.  They work great.
5.0,"Bought this as a birthday present for my daughter. She received a lot of other things,...but the bracelet was the star. No one could take their eyes off it. She now wears it every day. Photos here don't show how bright and shiney it is. It's beautiful!!!. We all want one now. Thanks for making these. Where the money goes for these is icing on cake too! Cheers!"
5.0,Super cute shorts.  Denim is soft and the length is great for young girls definitely not very short so appropriate for school etc...my daughter who hates wearing jeans LOVES these jean shorts!
5.0,I love these! I'm small but they look great on me.
5.0,"I was looking for warm wool socks without the bulk.  These are exactly what I needed!  I have only worn and washed twice, so I can't say how they will stand up to repeated washings, etc.  I also made sure to keep them out of the dryer.  Really happy with the purchase."
5.0,"Absolutely LOVE this shirt! Fits great and the fabric is really comfortable unlike a lot of other cheap shirts on Amazon. I ordered a cheap imitation of this design from another seller on amazon and it was HORRID, the printing was terrible and all pixelated as if it was merely copied and pasted from this design. If you love this design be sure to buy from these guys, they do it right. The other shirts are cheaper, but you definitely get what you pay for, LOW quality. PUPPY MONKEY BABY!!!! Gotta love Mountain Dew and their crazy @ss commericials! Thanks for this awesome shirt!"
5.0,Large collection of cute earrings. I am happy with them.
5.0,I like this product. Every night I put it on when I go to bed.
5.0,Very nice quality. Used for a family reunion.
5.0,So cute! I haven't given them as gifts yet but I've had mine on my keychain for about a week now and it hasn't broke. Usually they break within a few days. Good buy.
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful. Was happy to read that this was hypoallergenic as its hard enough to find earrings that does not contain nickel in it. Shipping was quick, really pleased."
5.0,"This is the cutest bathing suit ever! It is a little short in the torso for those with large breasts, but I'd rather be a little uncomfortable with it pulling on my shoulders then not have this awesome bathing suit. I look so amazing in this I had to dance around the house. It looks like the sexiest little picnic 50's dress. I bought this in two colors in a size XXL. I usually wear a size 16, 36 GG, but measurements 45-35-45."
5.0,"This is a 20th anniversary gift for my wife along with the platinum chain. It is very high quality, looks great, is not flashy, just a classic cross. The simpler the better. She was delighted with it."
5.0,"My son just HAD to have this hoodie.... At first I was a little put off by the price plus shipping costs, but when we received the hoodie I could see it was really nice quality, so I didn't mind as much. I ordered the largest Youth size (I think it was Youth XL) for my 11yo boy, who is in a boys size 18 right now, and that YXL size *just* fit him, and for his preference it was too small because he likes them looser, and the head opening was also too small for his big noggin. So I looked at the Adult size Small measurements, but it is almost exactly the same measurement as the Youth XL. So I ordered the Adult medium size and it fits him exactly the way he wants it - perfect!<br /><br />Now, about the seller. I highly recommend them!! They answered my request for a refund by asking if I wanted a different size, which of course I did. I was worried about paying shipping yet again to send the smaller one back, then shipping again to get the larger one, but the seller just told me to keep the smaller one, AND that they would send the size I wanted at no extra charge!!! Wow - did not expect that! Very easy, very responsive seller.<br /><br />So the quality of the product, and the responsiveness and complete fairness of the seller - both 5 stars, easy."
5.0,"Durable enough for an entire summer, loosens a bit but that's expected with these kind of bracelets/anklets. The color was vibrant and the turtles are super cute."
5.0,These are great for mustard etc in kids lunch. They don't leak!
5.0,"Works great, keeps my 5.11 trousers up and my shirts tucked. A winner."

5.0,father loves it
5.0,Perfect for my sons Detective Pikachu costume! He wanted a hat just like Pikachu.
5.0,"These are SO cute! I seriously wish they made them for adults, because I totally want a pair of my own. My daughter loves them, and she has got to be the pickiest shoe consumer out there. Nothing ever feels good, and nothing ever looks right LOL. These were perfect for my tween! The only struggle we had was with the laces. Nothing new for leather laces, but I kept having to redo the tie-offs as it expanded with wear. Just something to plan for if you go this route."
5.0,I loved how it fit me perfectly! I wore it for a masquerade ball and I've only gotten positive comments about the dress.
5.0,Awesome shirt! My daughter loves it!
5.0,Outstanding!!! Bar None  Best!!!!  Warm. Cozy. Comfortably. Toasty. Tested 4 hours straight blasting snow.  These ROCK!! And there Stylish!!! Best of the Best. My stuff was frozen solid...but I didnt feel any cold.
5.0,Love them. I wear them everyday.
5.0,The product was received as described
5.0,Like the design! Good quality.
5.0,"Not cropped so much as just a little shorter than normal. I have a short torso so it may be a true crop on someone taller. Im a size 16 and ordered XL and they fit great. Opaque and stretchy, plenty of room for big arms. Great for the price."
5.0,Fine hat did it’s job
5.0,I wanted to introduce my 11yo grandson to a quality set of cufflinks

5.0,I received a ton of compliments on this dress! I added tulle to the bottom to be a little more dramatic since it was my birthday!
5.0,"Very soft, light weight material as advertised. It’s so handy for my granddaughters to pull up over mouth and nose when needed, and just let stay around neck when not needed....no lost masks or masks falling on the ground. For our family these masks are great! Oh, and I love the fact that they come with filters."
5.0,Super tight for my 4 yr old. It hurts her to put on/take off.
5.0,I bought 3 of these bracelets for my 3 granddaughters.  They love them.  Nice quality and pretty.
5.0,"Got so many compliments on this dress. Material is different, but looks so good on."

5.0,Miusol dresses just never disappoint me. I know my size for their dresses and they always fit perfectly. My body is hourglass shaped and it just looks great on my body.  I am receiving great compliments from everyone.
5.0,"A perfect hat for a sunny day.  Brim is plenty wide and fit is good.  Hat is well-made, light without being flimsly"
5.0,"I love it, it's bigger than I thought. I mean bigger than me😁😀"
5.0,"Nice, soft, durable and comfortable  fit.  I have thick fingers so I  have to be very careful about buying gloves- especially online.  This is my second pair (only because I lost the first pair)  But the comforting part about losing the first pair, was that I didn't have to worry about where to find  another great pair of gloves!!!<br /> I would definitely recommend them!"
5.0,"I will give this bra 5 stars.  I am super sensitive wearing a bra and normally will not wear one although I am of a size that should.  I have tried every comfort bra on the market and this is the first bra I can actually wear all day without pain.  I also bought the largest size but if not so sensitive, I could have gone a size smaller.  I would normally wear a 36."
5.0,"Order a size bigger and I am glad I did,Love it!!!"
5.0,Love this ring.  I wear it as a wedding band.
5.0,1st one I've had that doesn't hurt when I lay on that side.
5.0,My daughter absolutely loves this. She’s definitely a mama with three little bears...LoL
5.0,"I love this necklace! While I'm typically more of a dainty/feminine jewelry wearer, I like the sentiment. I am now 12 weeks pregnant and have been wearing this necklace while trying to conceive and throughout my pregnancy so far. I only take it off when I'm dressing up, which is rare due to the pandemic. It makes me feel like I'm doing something to help look after my baby, even tho that's really something I have no control over. I like what it represents and recommend for all those mamas going through pregnancy!!"
5.0,"Wife loved it. Fits great, looks great."
5.0,Looks great! Husband loved it.
5.0,"This cheap watch is very good, small, and probably not like any other watch I've had. It fits perfectly around your wrist and is more comfortable than other Casio watches.  I even forgot that it was around my wrist, that's how comfortable it is!!  I recommend this to all guys, including females.<br /><br />Simply the best watch I've ever had!:)"
5.0,"daughter loved it,"

5.0,Great exactly what I expected
5.0,Muy buena opción
5.0,Got this for running in the morning --works great! It's very bright and you can still see it even when the sun comes out.
5.0,"As actual sunglasses, these are fine, but as &#34;clip-on&#34; lenses (which is what I ordered), not so good.  Please charge the listing so it's clear as to what it is that you are buying.<br />SECOND REVIEW:  I was wrong in my first post .  I've changed the stars to FIVE to try and make up for my first rating of 2, although in reality I would only give them 4 because they are a little big for my glasses.  My problem before was that they are too elegantly designed so it took some time to figure them out.<br />  I'm sorry for the original post and hope I can be forgiven."
5.0,Item is of tip-top quality. Fast to send. Good packaging. Service was superb. A++
5.0,Love it!! Very comfortable.  I will be ordering another one.
5.0,My wife has worn this several times now and loves the neutral color. It's perfect for her to wear to work. Has been washed several times and no pilling or issues. She is thinking about getting more in other colors.
5.0,Hermosas para vestidos
5.0,Bought these for a gift for my other half. He wont take them off! He says the are super soft and comfy!
5.0,"A little big, but warm and will grow into them"
5.0,Love it! Have it to my mom and she loves it! Said you don't find stuff like this in stores. Good quality. Easy to read. Very nice.
5.0,"Cute shirt!  The only thing that was weird to me was how snug the chest was. I'm not even large chested and it's tighter than I normally like. Other than that the material is comfy and the length is perfect. For reference, I'm 5&#34;9', about 155 pounds and 36B. I ordered the medium."
5.0,I love this watch! It’s super cute and slim. I love the color and the band is comfortable.
5.0,"Wow! This is nice! I would definitely recommend it to everyone. Thank you, I am very happy."

5.0,My husband loves these pants just wish we could buy more and in more colors.
5.0,Excellent product. Excelent reception. Perfect delivery time.
5.0,The item arrived very quickly. It was exactly what I expected. I would definitely purchase from this source again.
5.0,"No need to take those extra pairs of socks from the hospital, lol. I was surprised with how many pairs came in the package and the quality of each. They were very comfortable on my father's feet, who suffers with diabetes. They are loose fitting and don't squeeze or pinch. Perfect sock for wearing over a cast also, just size up like we did."
5.0,Bought this as a gift for a friend. She absolutely loved it. It was unique and pretty.
5.0,Easy to attach to masks
5.0,"Purchased this item for my daughter having been born in Germany, and a great supporter of soccer in Amerika, wanted something that would show support for the German World Cup team.  The Old Germany crest Tanktop was the ideal thing and brought many comments and acquired many German friends that were visiting Amerika.  She spoke of what a great time she and her friends had with a group of German folks that were in town and watched the World Cup together.  Said it was great fun..."
5.0,It does as it's told
5.0,I am about 135lbs and 5’5- I ordered a size medium. I have a DD chest and this suit was WAY too big in that area for me. Also shows a LOT of side b00b. Not a modest suit if that’s what you’re going for. Thankfully my friend was able to make it work. The straps are crazy long and not adjustable. It is a bit cheeky. Overall worth the money- only physical complaint is that the belt looks cheap. It’s not too thin either.
5.0,"I've been looking at black freshwater pearl earrings for a while now. Thanks to many other reviewers' warnings, I avoided some cheap quality options out there!  I just received these from La Regis, and I couldn't be happier.  They are very high-shine, button pearls, and mine have no scratches or flaws at all. Just beautiful color in a quality earring. I couldn't be happier. Thank you, La Regis!"
5.0,Adorable my daughter loves them!
5.0,Nice look. And Durable.
5.0,"Everytime I look at it, it changes a different color. Truly worth the buy. Sold for much more on other sites, but sold here for a bargain on Amazon!!"

5.0,I like so much my tunic
5.0,"I purchased this band and I love it, Easy to use, , fashionable appearance!<br />Price is good for 3ps. quality good. I well recommended  to anyone."
5.0,"Great quality, great color, great shape. Just what I hoped for."
5.0,"Fits very well and hangs on the person nicely. For an inexpensive Chinese made lab coat, I would recommend this."
5.0,One of my favorite purchases! Everyone in the house wants to use this bag! Probably should order like 3 more LOL 😂
5.0,Holds my glasses in place instead of them falling off my face all the time.
5.0,"Very nice hat, really comfortable and looks good"
5.0,My wife purchased this jewelry set to wear to her mother’s birthday celebration and it was beautiful and elegant just as pictured. I recommend it!
5.0,I love the cuff socks.  The look very nice with boots.  I like the color too.
5.0,This worked well for the web effects I had for a Halloween decoration project.
5.0,"This is my second purse like this one.  My first one I bought in a western store.  It was teal and tan.  I loved it & literally wore it out!  It was my all time favorite purse, so I started looking for one similar, and this one showed up!  So, of course I had to buy it.  The price was very reasonable too.  It is tan on tan & it matches my new boots :)"
5.0,"Love my Bonnet. my locs feel great and not dry in the morning. fit very snugly, no chance of slipping off while you sleep"
5.0,comfy and cute.
5.0,Good selection and variety.
5.0,Pues en la foto se ven bonitos pero me los mandaron muy oscuros  Están bien pero no para mi
5.0,"This genuine leather casual is very lovely.Thank U, Georgeta"
5.0,I love this brand and love the inside support built in bra
5.0,Like it its good
5.0,Little see through but nice dress
5.0,This is the second time we’ve bought this product. Size large fits a 90 pound girl very well. Product washes well and wears well and is soft enough for sensitivity issues. Highly recommend
5.0,Loved this beanie hat and the fit was comfy
5.0,Súper biem
5.0,Look just like the picture! Love them
5.0,My 6 year old twin grandsons love them! They’re good quality too!
5.0,Value for money. Excellent buy. Can't wait to do another purchase like this one
5.0,It’s such a cute and clever idea. I gave it as a gift and the person loved it!
5.0,Perfect for traveling and carrying passports and currency
5.0,"Compared to my old y-style shirt stay, this one is way better. Doesn't irritate my legs. I like the plastic pieces that hold it together versus the metal ones on my old ones that were causing the irritation. Because of the width, I expect it to last a long time versus my old one. Going to buy another set as a gift to my brothers."
5.0,Great quality. Packaging was top notch. Great for gift giving.
5.0,Great card shuffler. I hope it holds up over time. Others did not but this seems to work very well.
5.0,"Love this scrub cap. It is light weight, comes equipped with buttons to comfortably wear a mask and a sweat band to keep the head cool and comfortable during long shifts."
5.0,Absolutely love this brand headbands. I wear them for running. They wash fantastic after a sweaty workout. Super soft and not too tight on head. Never has slipped off. I love it because in winter you can wear it over your ears to protect from wind.
5.0,Good quality.  Launders well.  Very warm.  Would buy it again.
5.0,good quality and beautiful with nice detail. Better than I expected.
5.0,"Been wearing these rings for a few years. My wife loves the wide, bold band that proclaims ""He's mine!""  I find them wonderfully smooth, soft and comfortable. I ranch cattle and do a lot of wood and machine work but am never worried I am going to hook, shock, tear or get caught by this ring.  The only minor problem I have had is that it stretches out when exposed to solvents or paint thinners.  But it will return to shape and size if you let it dry for a few days.  Practically indestructible in daily wear and won't strip the flesh off my ring finger!  What more can I say - get 'em!"
5.0,"Nice length, good quality."
5.0,"I ordered several shirts from several different companies and this one beat the competition hands down.  As other posters have noted, it's super soft and has some stretch, which made it extremely comfortable post-surgery to wear 24/7, including to bed, when I couldn't get jammies over my head.  I can't overemphasize the quality and softness of the fabric compared to competitors.  This is the shirt to buy for your post-surgical needs."
5.0,VERY GOOD!!!
5.0,Love how soft they are<br /> The wide toe box makes them very comfortable and I love how they look!
5.0,Came in a package which left the clear plastic box it was in a bit crushed. Luckily I was not going to use box it arrived in. Ordered a separate stand to give to my wife for our 24th wedding anniversary.<br />( for the OPAL color) .<br />The rose itself was great. I was very happy with it.
5.0,It looks just great for women too!  Love it. Very easy to adjust the length.
5.0,Worth the price and same as picture. Quick delivery.
5.0,It for perfect and easy to wash and dry
5.0,"For ice hockey players, size runs small.  Sizing seems more suited as sports fashion apparel.  I'm an XL in every jersey I own.  I'm guessing I'll need to upsize to XXL for this to feel comfortable on the ice.<br /><br />Styling is unique.  Lots of thumbs up on the 1759 jersey number.  Makes a good conversation piece at beer league games."
5.0,"My girlfriend got me this belt as a gift and I love it! She knows I  love good quality things, and this was a great choice by her!  It is strong and durable and beautiful!"
5.0,Smaller than zi expected.
5.0,"Ok so lately ive been ordering Xl cardigans (im XL regularly) on amazon and they are HUGE on me so i started sizing down to a large… and its STILL loose!<br />Soooo i went crazy and ordered a SMALL!! 😂 and guess what? It fits PERFECT! Plus im also going to wear it like a regular sweater not an oversized fit— so if u want that look by all means order ur size or a size down would be good also.<br />The material feels of very good quality, its thick, and well sewn! No crooked stitchings. No loose threads… im VERY IMPRESSED!<br />The pattern is exactly as pictured. I ordered the blue leopard sweater.<br />Im extremely happy with this product. I will wash and dry before i use and will update my review.<br />Thank you to the seller, definitely recommend! Great product so far!"

5.0,My husband loved this tie. The pattern is fun and different and the tie itself is great quality.
5.0,The buckle design
5.0,"Works great, easy set up though the controls are a little hard to use effectively. Last for about 4-5 hours. Charging time takes a little under 2 hours on a 1.0 amp charger.<br />I have also taken the headphones out of the hat and used them in my motorcycle helmet occasionally with good success."
5.0,"I bought on a whim during the Prime day sale, and I'm very happy I did. The dress looks amazing, the material is light, but perfect for work.<br /><br />I wear a size 14-16W in dresses and the XXXL fit me perfectly."
5.0,She is wearing it.....so that is a plus.

5.0,"Very cute.  Just what I needed for cell phone, credit cards and other small items.  Received several compliments."
5.0,"All four appear to be identical, no production differences. I used them with the NATO band also made by Barton. Easy to operate with no pliers, unsure how they would work with other bands however. I feel like the nub to release it may not work with other bands well."
5.0,I like this because it represents my country and my service.  Now it sits on my riding vest for all to see.
5.0,these are for part of  future gifts  they are pretty and nicely made
5.0,My wife said it fits good. Material is soft and she likes the style.
5.0,Love this!  I have a similar one from several years ago.  Little different in the graphic but same color and material.  This is vintage looking and very soft cotton.  Has a well worn look to it.  I always have gotten compliments on my old one.  Same with this one.
5.0,loved the price and quality
5.0,I absolutely love this shirt! I want to get it in so many colors!
5.0,"Love everything about it, that is why bought 2 more, got first the black and niw grey and blue. It is what is described waterproof."
5.0,I bought this as a joke for a gift exchange. But it was awesome.  So I ordered another for myself!
5.0,Love these shirts because they actually look flattering on plus size bodies!
5.0,This dress is very well made and beautiful.<br />My daughter is wearing it in my wedding and loves  it so much she wants to wear it to prom next year.<br />I was skeptical ordering online but the company has been wonderful to work with. We had a small glitch in one of the dresses and they worked with us!
5.0,My 10 year old wanted to be Robin Hood!  We loved this costume!  Great quality!  Nice material!  Not cheap plastic like some!  The only suggestion I would have is to reinforce the strap that goes under the shoe - but every costume we have ever had that had a strap that went under the shoe also ripped on the first day worn!
5.0,I dont post photos of my baby online however this outfit is super cute. Has a lot of stretch and plenty room to grow. The color is fabulous. I just love love love this.
5.0,Great product! Daughter loves the print! It's just as cute in person!
5.0,"I ordered L, but I will be buying another one in XL because I like it to be more loose.  I have received many compliments."
5.0,"Bought this for my granddaughter for a Disney cruise. She loves it. Her actual size is an XS but that was not one of the options so it is a little big on her tiny frame, but she loves it any way."
5.0,"Love the color, fabric and squat proof!<br /><br />Best part is the pockets!!!<br /><br />I ordered a large and fit as expected!"
5.0,First time getting shirts that fit me

5.0,Just love it!  It is a light but very nice and soft Jean jacket!  It looks just great!  Highly recommend if you are looking for comfort and a good casual look!
5.0,Love this brand!  What a gorgeous top - the fabric falls nicely and the fit is perfect!
5.0,These are so cute! I bought them for my 14 month old. They are a little big but not too big that he can't wear them now.
5.0,"These butterflies are everything I expected and more. They are made of a very soft metal. I find that they will be very easy to slightly bend into shape for many different craft projects. These are definitely not just for jewelry making. Also for those of you who do use them for  jewelry making, please note that they do not have a whole punched or a loop to attach them to the top of any jewelry"
5.0,Comfortable and does what it's supposed to do. I bought it to protect my eyes from the wind but that didn't work. I'm still in search of glasses that will protect my eyes from the wind that are not for snowboarding lol.
5.0,"I got this for my dad for his birthday & was worried the sizing would be off, but I was very relieved when he tried it on & it's very true to size. It's a beautiful shirt & I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase."
5.0,I am a size 8 and these fit absolutely perfect!!!!!  Super comfy too!!!!

5.0,"Nice looking quality, and a good option to have in your wardrobe."
5.0,Size 8 shoes. These fit well.
5.0,Nice little toddler socks. Love the grippies so they don't slip and fall.
5.0,I am thoroughly impressed with this jersey. It fits me so well and is extremely beautiful. I highly recommend it.
5.0,"Love it!!! It has plenty of compartments for all my travel documents and more! It can fit my iPhone, ear buds and my kindle so everything is in one place and easy to access! Perfect!"
5.0,I have this dress in 4 colors!!! They are true to size. I’m normally a large and the large fits me perfectly.
5.0,"I love the color and the length of these shorts. It’s difficult to find shorts this length and this color. What I like the least about these shorts is the cloth belt that comes with the shorts. I really don’t have much use for it, but I wear the belt anyways.Overall, these shorts are a winner!"
5.0,"A real XXL that fits! High quality cotton T and real graphics, not sprayed on or iron transfer."
5.0,Nice shirt! Nice material.
5.0,Very pretty. Just what I was looking for
5.0,The turtles are so cute. They make amazing earrings.
5.0,i loved my dress fits like a glove so light and airy and especially that it has pockets.
5.0,This bag is amazing!! I highly recommend it.  It looks fabulous!
5.0,"I like the length, but I would suggest ordering a size larger than you think you need."
5.0,Very comfortable for my large nose.  Easy to breathe .
5.0,It fits great and wears well. Got a lot of comments on the shirt.
5.0,I like that it fits but don't like the see thru bra cup.
5.0,Fit well and came as expected.
5.0,"kid wont take it off, love it"
5.0,"Bought this for myself and I love it. Easy to close, comfortable to wear. My wrist is small and fits perfect."
5.0,"Very summery, light-weight and flowy. Feels and looks great!"
5.0,"Incredible amount of functions and they all seem accurate when compared to maps, thermometers, and other measuring tools. Large, but still comfortable, and a vital multifunctional backup in the wilds."
5.0,I have been wearing this  brand for a while. I love them!
5.0,"This key fob case is very nice.  The quality is outstanding.  It is  a very nice size, bigger than I expected but that's great for when I do not want to carry a purse and I can clip it to my belt loop. When carrying my purse I can attach it to my purse so I do not lose my keys.  The inside of the case is lined with suede and has an additional key chain which is a nice added touch.  This keychain looks and feels very expensive.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for my honest, unbiased review and I definitely recommend this to others."
5.0,Omg this was more perfect then i had dreamed!!!! Was received perfectly wrapped and on time. I’m in love 😍
5.0,"Love!!!! Fits like a glove, lovely train, over all a cute, sexy dress/"
5.0,Sizes are good for 4-6 yr old and adults!
5.0,"I like these because of the material, the fit, and are comfortable when I have them on and have been doing lots of walking.  They stretch when you take a step, then reshape so they don’t fall off easily like most thongs.  They seem to be comfortable for all day wear.  I like that they are unisex in styling because I have extra wide feet so even though I’m female, the male widths of shoes fit me better."
5.0,"The dress was very form fitting and comfortable.  It kept me warm and I got lots of compliments.  The material is very nice and thick enough to not be see through.  The length of the dress and the sleeves were just right also, which was a relief since  I'm used to having dresses be too long.  The skirt of the dress hit right below the knee so this will be good to wear on date night or at work.  I'm 5'4&#34;, 150 lbs, if that helps."
5.0,"Soft, great fabric, covers the eyes for the baby. Love it!"
5.0,My son loves them and they appear to be solidly constructed.
5.0,"These are the best pj's you will ever own!  Got them as a Christmas present and they were a huge hit.  They are so soft and wash up beautifully.  They do run small so order a size up for comfortable fit.  The person I gave them to is 5'4, 140 lbs on the chesty side and the xlarge fit perfectly.  Will definitely order again!"
5.0,I wear these basically everyday. They go with pretty much all my outfits and I loveeee them
5.0,Loved this charm!  More beautiful than the picture!
5.0,I purchased a Navajo pendant that is absolutely perfect with the necklace.

5.0,Love it. Cute bracelet. Very low cost. Well worth it.
5.0,"Super cute and VERY comfy! I wear business casual to work and these are perfect paired with a plain cami and light cardigan. I’m all about dressing for comfort but I needed something different from my go-to black leggings. These did great. I got so many compliments on them and people were shocked to hear how inexpensive they were. They aren’t the thickest material, but awesome because these pants are going to be so comfortable to wear in the hot summer months. I’m 5’3” and usually size 6 and medium fit just fine"
5.0,Very happy with them. Very comfortable to wear. Love the color.
5.0,"I am 5'2"" and 130 pounds.  I ordered a large per the recommendation, but it's a bit tight across my chest and back area. Order two sizes up from your regular size. I wear a medium in USA made clothing, but need an XL here to feel comfortable."
5.0,Super cool item
5.0,"very cute, loose and blousey where I need it to be. Long enough to cover backside. going to buy in different colors."

5.0,"I LOVE TREELANCE TOPS!! This is my second purchase from Treelance. I get lots of compliments on them both! These tops are perfect for my hot yoga class, they don’t shift around and aren’t too tight! I‘m looking forward to more designs...thank you Treelance! 💖✨🧘‍♀️✨💖"
5.0,They run big...I've got a big head so I like them a lot!  Just what I wanted!
5.0,"Hilarious, fun, slightly hard to see out of. But our unicorn family was majestic."
5.0,I used this bag for everything! Very sturdy and durable. Fits a ton of things inside it and supper cute! Plus it supports a great cause with the purchase of one of these products?
5.0,"The material of the leggings are between regular stockings and regular leggings, it is breathable and comfortable when wear them, don't fell any discomfort like other slim legging that I've tried, will continue wear for slim result, so far love them!"
5.0,"Get for my boyfriends it has a nice light weight to it, now it is flat which I think is a good thing don't need a lot of extra weight. The key ring has a hint of green it is not hulk green more like a gold metallic green. Would still recommend for those hulk lovers out there."
5.0,Very cute and arrived quickly. Love this wristlet for the price .
5.0,Very nice well made. They were beautiful my boyfriend loved it
5.0,"Good quality, super soft but runs very small. Almost seems like child/teen sizes, arms and legs are super short"
5.0,Easy to put on and take off....worth it
5.0,"I purchased the pearl as a gift for my wife... When she open the box she imediatly fell I love with the pearl. I liked the packaging and how the pearl was linked to the two hearts. The best part is it looked fantastic when she put it on. I recommend this product, the quality and price are unmatched.<br />Thank you"
5.0,I literally just got the peoduct so I don’t know<br />how well it will stand up against wear or if It will turn my finger freen. I will update my post.<br /><br />But from what I can tell it is exactly like the picture! It’s also adjustable so size doesn’t matter!
5.0,"Unsure what to expect since the price was so low, however it’s AMAZING!  What’s not to love about Willie and comfy.  Whenever I wear this I get lots of laughs and compliments. T The material is super soft, washes well, and retains shape.  Runs a little large, and I’m 5’4” and 36C bust and usually wear a small."
5.0,Cute lil sock. They fit comfortably and they are pretty well made.
5.0,"Wow, simply beautiful purse...love it"
5.0,Me encanto el conjunto. Esta marca siempre queda bien.
5.0,I really love these for working out or around the house. My hat size is 7 1/4&#34; just for reference. I had to stretch both of them a little before they weren't too tight.
5.0,These are pretty decwnt. I managed to get my pair for $10. Probably should save them for winter as they are hot during these hot summer days. They fit a little loose barefoot but I'm cool with that.
5.0,"Love the design options! The cubes work great to help organize packing. If you are looking for compression cubes, these are not.  However, I can out pack TSA regulations every single time, and I could fit just as much in these as I would normally pack (just more organization as opposed to whatever fits where). Liked them so much I ordered another set in the star pattern.  Looking forward to our 2 weeks in Alaska and these will help keep us organized, as well as fit everything we need."
5.0,"Great quality, great product and I love it."
5.0,"It's a gorgeous dress, I picked the wrong size"
5.0,2 sizes smaller than stated size so if you wear a large may want to get 2xl other than that colors are super bright and good quality its a great sweatshirt
5.0,Pretty pink earrings seem.well made and nice length.
5.0,"Is a great Radio Strap, has held up exactly how Boston Leather should."
5.0,This was one of two necklaces I ordered. Received many<br />compliments when wearing this necklace. Necklace<br />is not too heavy or too light.
5.0,"Everything looks good, the flag is nicely covered under the transparent rubber. Only thing not so great is that it doesn't go with prime 2-day shipping."
5.0,Love these luggage tags. They are well made - strong and durable. I bought the green and they are a very bright lime color which helps me spot my bags more easily as the come across the baggage claim conveyor.  I would buy these again!
5.0,Love it! It’s the perfect length. I can even tie the front together in the center with the extra fabric if I want to!
5.0,"Love it got many complements ,kept on every day even shower does not tarnish stays like new.<br />Recomended"
5.0,Likes: fast shipping! Awesome design …maybe I’m biased because I really like hats 🧢.<br /><br />Dislikes: none
5.0,Love these they’re super cute for group baby photos! My sister in laws and I all had baby’s last year - so was a cute photo op! They run a little small though so I suggest getting a size up
5.0,"It looks very nice! The triforce is a bit big, and the chain is a little long. It is great for its price and it came way before the shipping estimate. It was supposed to come the 24th of Feb. but came the 31st of Jan! Great!"
5.0,NICE earrings! Surgical stainless. Comfortable. Great quality. Amazing price. I'm allergic to most metal and can only wear surgical stainless earrings & have limited options. These hoops are perfect.
5.0,Loved it. It fit both my 9yr old daughter and 5 year old beautifully. Just follow the measurements :) also I just hung it up for a few days to get the wrinkles out of the tulle which worked just fine.
5.0,"These are nice aprons! I got the blue for myself, and a gray one for my rather tall husband, who tends to be quite messy both in the kitchen and when doing other messy projects. He likes that he doesn’t need to tie these to have them stay in place."
5.0,"Love this 💞 The color is beautiful ,it fits good"
5.0,"the color is as advertised , fit true to size and very light weight, I like them very much"
5.0,Nice no wrinkle material. Very comfortable and fits great!
5.0,"These leggings are lightweight, opaque, and really move with you. They don't slip down at the waist while I run, which I love. Hoisting up a pair of troublesome leggings is the worst when all you want to do is get some cardio in. The best thing for me is that they are amazing at wicking away moisture. I get really sweaty, and these stay nice and dry throughout my workout. My only minor gripe is that they are a tad loose at the ankles, but this is easily overlooked considering how much I love everything else about them."
5.0,This this beautiful and fits perfectly!!! I love this skirt!!
5.0,I love it! I wear it almost everyday!
5.0,Used them as part of a commemorative swag bag. Everyone loved them!
5.0,Received earrings exactly as shown on web site.  Very happy.
5.0,Awsome !!!!!!! Thanks

5.0,Pretty Awesome Bag! We use it as a diabetes supply bag for my Type 1 kid. Holds what she needs and she think its cute
5.0,Great shirt! Love the print! A little pricey tho...
5.0,"These durags are wonderful, but after one wear on a clean head, they smelt kinda bad. Great otherwise though."
5.0,Great britches
5.0,"Cute and comfy, bought to wear as sleepwear"
5.0,These are a smooth rubber and nice fit which caused no discomfort and worked well in gripping the floor even when wet.
5.0,Awesome handbag the birds are very pretty and is a good size you can fit everything in it.
5.0,Completely adorable! Good quality.
5.0,"I bought this for my 5 year old as a birthday gift. It came in a really nice box that doesn't give the gift or gift's I should say, away. He was so excited to see what was inside. The stuff inside came very neatly wrapped in the cutest camouflage tissue paper I've ever seen. My son loved all his new army gear. The sellers definitely put alot of time and effort into making sure we were happy , and I would absolutely recommend buying this toy bundle to anyone looking for a small gift or surprise for little boys 3-6yrs. My son and I were both very happy with this buy and would def. buy again!!"
5.0,All Snoozies are so soft and comfy! The ballerina style is very pretty and I love the fun sparkle of this particular color.
5.0,Plenty of room and the material is soft. I use them for my cheaters.
5.0,Fit great!  Made the perfect gift!
5.0,Nice. Fits great. Warm. Not as loose and slouchy as I like but that's ok.
5.0,"I have used these for many years. They are perfect for the braless look. With so many attractive styles that are off the shoulder, this is a must!  Follow the directions and it will last a long time."
5.0,I love these for a casual drive. It came with a case!
5.0,I like the material and the fit goes well with my curvy figure. I ordered a size up and it fit well. I’m short so I will definitely need to have it tailored but for the cost of the entire suit it was definitely worth it. I’m going to order in another color. I wish they offered petite sizes.
5.0,"I held off on giving a review of this handbag until I had actually had an opportunity to use it. Let me tell you, it is a just as advertised! I love the purse. I personally do not like the big bulky handbag where you cannot find what you are looking for, and suffer shoulder pain for the sake of fashion, I am more practical. The bag is well equipped with many card slots, holds personal items, checkbooks, lipstick, keys, and an iPhone 6s, without looking bulky!! I would definitely buy this product again, and recommend it to all my friends!"
5.0,Estos lentes son excelente..los recomiendo
5.0,Love these earrings.  I have gotten many compliments on them.  Looks like the Kendra Scott earrings
5.0,"my son love this watch omg he is always wearing it every where he goes lol,catch seems to talk it off or put it down"
5.0,I love these socks!  I wore them all day and they did not spin around on my feet!  I will be purchasing more of these.  I have a lot of issues with socks and how they fit!  I had none of those issues with these socks!  I love them
5.0,I love them<br />Perfect fit<br />They don't dangle and got great on my loobs.
5.0,Just perfect for what my brother needed
5.0,I love the flexibility and not having to buckle. Makes it each to remove.Not too tight. Looks just like the picture.<br />Would purchase again.
5.0,"I bought these socks for my husband and he loves them, say's they are soft and fit perfect!!  Got a good deal on them great price good socks!!!!"
5.0,It's legitimately perfect. The charm being a little bigger than anticipated but pleasantly surprised at its simple perfection!! ESPECIALLY for the price!
5.0,Ordered mine directly from Neff. Seems to be working perfectly. I needed an all black watch to help me pace myself at work. I'm a photographer and shoot cars a lot with studio strobes. Cars can be very reflective and I like to not have to photoshop anything out in the end. Great watch! Got it on sale and it's just what I needed.
5.0,Great glasses 👓<br /><br />I get multiple compliments each time I wear em out
5.0,Such a fun legging.  Sometimes you get bored of the plain back. I love that it has a pocket for  my phone.
5.0,"This dress is really nice! I was worried it would be too thin but the material is pretty decent. Buttons are functional. I’m only 5’1” so the dress hits about mid calf on me, which I like. Great for summer and I can easily add a sweater and tights for colder weather."
5.0,was not sure how the bag would look based on the picture - it is bigger than I thought and holds a lot more than I really need (YAY ME!!!)<br />Finally a cross body bag that actually holds items you normally have and you do not have to down size
5.0,Perfect for my daughter for under her Basketball  jersey.
5.0,"I looked at the product description and wondered how there were 10 pockets and there are side zippers to pockets as well as top access with metal snaps which is great.  Opting for more economical than down and this fits great, has the utility of the pockets and looks like it will be warm.  I use it as an adjunct under my other coat and am sure it will provide more than an ample additional layer of warmth - well done !"
5.0,My 4 year old has worn this for months and the color is still pretty vibrant. the chain did break a few weeks ago but that was an easy fix. good quality and doesn't look like costume jewelry.
5.0,"Love these jeans! Great fit and perfect cut for riding or wearing out. These jeans love with you, but have good structure and hold their shape, and are flattering. I have come to love my Wranglers above all others."
5.0,Very nice watch strap. Looks a lot better than the seiko brown strap I had originally
5.0,"I love mine. After I got the first one and loved it, I ordered a second one in a different color. I may order more. They are perfect for around the house and anywhere really.<br />I don’t carry a purse, so I bought them for the pockets and also because I love hoods.<br />They are very soft and comfortable material and the large fit perfect for me."
5.0,It’s awesome for the price!
5.0,"Super comfortable and soft material.  I wish the color was more blue as pictured, it is more of a purple, but I'm happy with it!"
5.0,"Shoes are super sexy and fit great. They're high, but not too hard to walk in. Look just like the picture. Very cute! I wore them to go out clubbing."
5.0,Product is exactly as described. Would buy again from this seller! 100% happy!
5.0,Very nice looking.  Not too tight on head but snug enoug to stay in place.
5.0,"These charms are really cute, some of them are too big for my jewelry but I am still keeping them, I might use them for necklaces.  I am very happy with my purchase."
5.0,"These are awesome! I NEVER buy sunglasses without trying them on. But I figured I try because of the whole package (case, glasses,etc). The price seemed resonable.<br /> I'm REALLY GLAD I did. The glasses fit PERFECTLY (love the look) and they really make everything crystal clear. The case is awesome and far from being cheap, and the clip is just what I needed!<br />Just one thing (and not a bad thing about the product at all) I wished they came in silver. The gold is really pretty with the pink, but silver just looks better on me. Im still wearing them! Too awesome to be that picky! If you offered these in silver, I'd buy them too!<br />Thank you sooo much for the great buy!"
5.0,Beautiful purple color! One bag carried a gallon of milk and 3 quarts of lemonade. I can replace 4 plastic bags of food with one.
5.0,Got these for a Easter zen paint party. Great timing
5.0,two regular and two USB ports !  Life is good .<br />I can plug two 120 volt items and charge two electronic devices . Zowee !!
5.0,"A great bag for the money. Night one for my wife a year or so ago and she's used it heavenly since. It has been a sturdy bag. It was a bit smelly when new, but that's the only negative I can think of."
5.0,These earrings are even better than expected.  I love the length and more importantly they are not heavy at all.
5.0,Edit - the company immediately recognized the problem and has satisfied me with a resolution. EXCELLENT COMPANY.<br /><br />(Original) Only wore once and not even washed and it's falling apart. Total piece of garbage. Worst product I've ever bought from them. Usually quality stuff.
5.0,"These goggles are excellent. They look great, come in a handy carrying case and fit extremely well. The lenses are tinted and semi refective. They are very well priced."
5.0,My Mom has a difficult time with watch bands. Tried this one.. She slaps it on & shes ready to go.  So cute & has large numbers😊
5.0,Love it  especially that color of it. I ordered the blue one and also the black one.
5.0,"wore these on a recent trip while driving 5 hours, couldn't believe how much they helped....no tired eyes, no headache.."
5.0,"I got so many compliments in this dress! I wore it to my moms 70th birthday party and everyone told me how beautiful it is. It’s very comfortable. I bought the large, I’m 5’ 7” and I weigh 165 lbs."
5.0,"Cute top. I can wear when pregnant or after. Bought one, then went back and bought three more."
5.0,Nice and lite. I feel as if it's small for my face but so far it works fine.
5.0,"Was not expecting to love these sleeveless shirts as much as I do, but dang they rock! The fitting is spot on, the texture feels soft, the shirts feel well made, and and they look great!"
5.0,"Very comfortable and lightweight! I also like that it came with a cleaning wipe and case, making it a better deal than what I could even get at Walmart. I'll be buying this brand again."
5.0,I was a bit worried about everything fitting but it fits perfect! The bra and panties both are super comfy while looking sexy! I may have to get a few other sets.
5.0,"These are extremely strong work type belts.  Having worn actual ""tactical"" belts I wouldn't actually call these ""tactical"" unless you're talking about paintball.  I've been using these type belts for the past year or so and none have worn out yet.  I suspect they'll outlive me.  Important to note that you do have to remove one of the buckles to fit the belt through standard belt loops.  Bottom line is that the quick release feature works great if you're not changing the belt but every time you put the belt on a new pair of pants, you have to remove one of the buckles - and you can only remove one of the two - in order to string it through a normal set of belt loops.  Basically you leave the two parts of the ""buckle"" connected, sting the belt through your belt loops and then restring the webbing  through the one side of the buckle.  It's quick and easy once you get used to it.  They recommend that you not cut the belt but I cut it a 3 or 4 inches longer than I need and sear the new end with a heat gun.  Works great.  A number of 3 belts sets on Amazon are identical, and I mean identical, but these are the least expensive I've found."
5.0,Cord is a bit too long for me.
5.0,"Excellent quality, comfort with support. Can wear them all day long."
5.0,"Great product! If you’re petite like me, go a size down."
5.0,Used these with diamond wire to make a wire saw and it cuts like a hot knife through  butter.
5.0,Very soft and comfortable great purchase
5.0,Very cool looking ...  effective and protective!
5.0,This cover up is the real deal. I was scared it would be cheap looking. Nope. It’s stunning! I’m 5’5’ with an athletic figure and it looks phenomenal!!!
5.0,"Best reading glasses I have ever purchased.  I have stepped on them, washed them, got them stuck between the door, and still they keep their shape!  I have purchased more.  Great Quality!"
5.0,"Love material, fits great, should be great in Tavel time"
5.0,Best things ever.. I don't even know they are in my ears.
5.0,"I’m 5’5 and weigh about 147-149, got a size 8/10. Perfect fit! Love the color. Material is breathable. I don’t need much of a heel for it to not drag on the floor fortunately bc im terrible in heels that are too high😂"
5.0,"I made it for my father with pictures of both his parents/my grand parents and he loved it so much he was brought to tears, I was happy that he was happy and he wears it every day. Definitely makes a good gift for loved ones"
5.0,Is beautiful ring.
5.0,"This is such a sweet little bird Cape! Nice quality, see through but I like how it let's the light shine through!"
5.0,"I love this ring, it is very pretty in person and it is true to size!"
5.0,"This dress was a very good deal. I loved wearing it this summer to restaurants on vacation, or out with family & friends. It has generous pockets, the red is a great flattering a shade, and since I’m short, the high-low hem doesn’t swallow me up. You can wear it as-is or add a denim jacket. The fabric stretches, so order try to size."
5.0,Love the pink - swift delivery - gave a couple of them away to thrilled girlfriends - same as the black version.
5.0,"Perfect fit, perfect for an orchestra performance!"
5.0,These pants are so comfortable and versatile for the gym or everyday wear!
5.0,Incredible fitting socks! Will def be buying more

5.0,Great gift!  Was just as pictured!
5.0,Arrived on time and was exactly what i was looking for will be ording more!!
5.0,Fit as expected. Easy to put on.
5.0,"Very comfortable slippers, the memory foam bottom conforms go your feet. Rubber soles are nice for walking outside or on porch. Super soft."
5.0,"Fits well, nice heavy materials and feels good.  Go Packers."
5.0,"cute socks, will get a good amount of wear from them"
5.0,Beautiful pants...made well.
5.0,Best beanie ever.  I have multiple in different colors
5.0,Can't say enough good things about this dress. Beautiful. Perfect fit. Great lace quality. Looks incredible on... the photo doesn't even do it justice.
5.0,I didn't realize these were only ankle high but I love them anyways. They are perfect for yoga when you don't want to pull out your mat.I like the cute colors too.
5.0,"I just wish they had pockets, but I bought several of these!"
5.0,Good quality.  Heavyweight and a great gold color.
5.0,"great looking, quality slipper.  great service."
5.0,"Like the suit, but small in the chest."
5.0,Nicely made. Comfortable. Light weight. Lots of pickets.  Fit as described. A tiny bit long for 5’10” but they are cargo shorts so they tend to be longer. These will be perfect for hiking!
5.0,"These are very cute! The insole has a bit of cushion, the jelly material the shoe is made of is soft enough to not damage your toddler's feet, and the lights flash super brightly with each step which made my 2 year old wildly happy! The bow is of decent quality, and these little beauties were a great substitute for the princess dress up shoes she really wanted but can't wear yet because they seem to all come in only one size which is several inches to big for her feet. These are perfect if your little girl loves to play dress up and is under the age of three, because you can order her exact size. The standard dress up play shoes only come in size 8 and are for kids age 3-6. This was a real hit with our daughter!"
5.0,"I used to use those Jacobs latter type wallets because I liked how thin they were in my back pocket...but this product by far surpasses it. Not only that there is more than enough space for your cash, cards and identification. I'll be buying this product again when the time comes"

5.0,Looooove!! My scarf. I'm excited to see different colors and patterns. I'm ordering a collection. You can adjust it in so many ways but the main thing is it will remain on your head.
5.0,"I got these as a gift for my husband and he LOVES them. The frames are solidly constructed. The lenses do a great job of blocking the sun, and the wraparound design helps limit sun coming in the sides. The lenses are high quality. When my husband uses them at the beach or pool, the water runs off of them pretty well, whereas my cheap sunglasses are covered with water spots after they dry."
5.0,"I size down based on the reviews and it fits great. My only complain would be the area with the strings are not elastic and a little hard to get over my chest area without popping out a stich or two, but once I got it on it was a great fit and very flattering."
5.0,Very happy with my Hawaiian necklace!
5.0,Quality is excellent and very durable. Excited for Halloween.
5.0,"These boots were a wonderful bargain and were exactly what I was looking for.  For the price, the look and comfort of these boots is really high.  I actually am going to wear these a lot!

Would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for colorblind glasses that work ! Made Our Christmas morning so much more special ! LIFE CHANGING !!!"

5.0,Wow. Wish I bought these years ago.  Great idea!!!  Everything is organized and easy to find.  No unpacking and repacking when taking something out of suitcase.  Quality is very good.<br />I will buy more for friends.
5.0,Cute but broken
5.0,"I find these water skin shoes to be super comfortable. I have been wearing them around the house and for quick walks in the neighborhood. I love that they slip on so easily and hug the foot. They are very light weight and airy. I can see myself wearing these around the house, for quick errands, the pool, and especially the beach – protecting my feet from the scorching sand – or for that matter the cement and blacktop around my condo. The sole is thin rubber, but protects the foot well.<br /><br />Sizing – I read the reviews before purchasing and ordered the XL (in blue). My normal shoe size is 8 to 8 ½ and these fit me perfectly. So basically, follow the sizing guide (in one of the pictures on Amazon) and order a size up from it.<br /><br />They came shipped in a plastic zip bag, which is handy. You can reuse it to easily carry the shoes around and protect your belonging if the shoes are wet or dirty. They come in several fun colors, I plan on picking up a second pair (probably the green – I have the blue). I recommend these Luxur Barefoot Water Skin Shoes, and have fun wearing them!"
5.0,I love the handbag. It is very classy!
5.0,they are light and cute!
5.0,"It saves a step of buckling the strap and is very comfortable. Soft stretchy silicone material, easy on easy off but stays in place. Be sure to use the size guide, print the wearable chart for accuracy."
5.0,Bought for a Baby Shower Love it  Just what I Ordered Thank you  Thank you

5.0,The capris pants fit true to size. Well made.
5.0,"I like these for under short dresses or around the house. Really short, so if you have ANY booty, your cheekies may/probably will hang out of the bottom. Doesn't bother me, but if you're blessed with dumps like a truck and thighs like what, you may not want to use them for weight lifting or a lot of bending over.<br /><br />Also they have pockets that fit a lot so thats worth all the possible wardrobe malfunctions to me. And they help flatten the tummy a little."
5.0,PERFECT SIZE CAULDRON.  Love it.
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful dress, wore it to my company Christmas party and received many compliments."
5.0,These pants are made of just the right weight of fabric

5.0,Love this sweater!  Sexy but warm enough and fits like all of my other PattyBoutik tops.  Order according to their size chart and you can't go wrong!
5.0,"Absolutely LOVE this dress.  Very flattering and although the material seems thin like other reviewers mention, it is buttery soft and so comfy.  I recently gained extra weight and my clothes aren't fitting so I ordered this dress to hold me over until I can shed some pounds and I am so happy I did.  It looks sexy and sophisticated yet feels super comfortable.  Makes me forget that I'm a fatty pants right now.  For the price it's worth a try and if you are not happy the return is easy."
5.0,Lineo bracelets for men very decent for the price I'm giving one to each of my grandsons for the price I give it five star
5.0,This pin is a beautiful piece!
5.0,Good fits as size chart indicated nice solid practice Jersey

5.0,This is a super nice hat but it runs a little small. I have a small head and the s/m is snug. I liked the hat so much I ordered one in a size up in a different color. The hat is well made and has good detail. Great for kayaking. Recommended.
5.0,It was received exactly as presented & expected!! Thank you!
5.0,"I am thrilled with this product. I purchased it as an alternative to my fanny pack for travel.  It is lightweight but durable enough for my purposes.<br /><br />The capacity of the main compartment is more than sufficient to carry my 10&#34; Sony tablet, a hat, gloves and other gear.  The zippered storage pouch which is sewn to the shoulder pack, cleverly nests within the main compartment and doubles as a hidden, secure compartment.<br /><br />I have not had a problem with the water bottle holder because I wear the backpack backwards. The bottle holder is on the bottom, the small external zippered compartment is on the top, and the main compartment zipper horizontal and facing out.  I store my cellphone in the &#34;Enjoy For Life&#34; pouch on the strap, ready for action near my left shoulder. This positioning may not be the way it was designed, but everything is in the right place and very accessible for me.<br /><br />With this backpack my hands and arms are free, pockets empty, all of my travel essentials in one place, readily accessible, comfortable to carry, and a breeze to send through the x-ray when transiting airport security.<br /><br />While perfect for my needs, it certainly is NOT suited for rugged excursions in the wilderness.<br /><br />I am glad I found this accessory and would highly recommend it."
5.0,So cute and comfortable! Highly recommend!  I would buy again. Washes beautifully.
5.0,cute and fun!
5.0,"Way bigger than I expected but I didn't read the full description, just saw a pretty valentine's gift that now looks good on her wall."
5.0,Absolutely beautiful. So many dresses that are similar to this style that are pricey. This is worth it. Looks even better in person.
5.0,"I wanted a jogger with pockets and without that annoying string at the waist. These are so comfortable, fit perfectly and were just what I was looking for. I will be ordering a few more."
5.0,"I love these capris!  I have so many different brands of workout pants and dislike more of them then I like for one reason or another.  These ones are perfect for an intense cardio class, for yoga and for everything in between.  They do not need to be pulled up and they are so comfey.  My new Fave! Already ordered 3 pair this week!  I've been looking for something like this for a long time!"
5.0,I love the fit and the color.  Material is soft and comfortable.
5.0,They do a great job love wearing them.

5.0,It's an XL and fits fine!!! I live the adjustable straps!!! I'm a BBG (big bust girl) those help! The color is spectacular! I've not worn it IN THE POOL yet. But I hope it keeps it's color.
5.0,Love this so much I ordered another in a different color the following week. The hemline stays in place throughout the day and doesn't stretch out like many other skirts I have owned. Easy gentle cycle wash and air dry and looked good.
5.0,"This is a super cute shirt for the summer! I love the bow in the back and it's nice and cool and not too tight, making it a great tank top for shorts and a nice,  clean look.<br />This is made of a good quality cotton, the colors do not fade after a few washes like some do and it's to wash and dry, so that makes it the perfect shirt in my eyes :-).<br /> It looks good, hangs nicely, and is easy to care for!<br />I don't think that the stars and stripes are just for July 4th or other National holidays. I think it's a great looking around and especially in the summer when tank tops are a necessity in these parts, this is terrific addition to our closet and I think all of my girls will share it... and I may take it myself from time to time :-)<br />I've had many different purchases from this company and all of the items have been something that fit well and looks great so I really do recommend this tank top to anybody who is looking at it.<br />In my case, I was lucky enough to receive it at a discount in exchange for my honest review.<br />But I bought many things at full price and will continue to do so."
5.0,These are very comfortable with just the right amount of compression. Not restrictive.
5.0,"I just started collecting septum jewerly and I love this new addition in rose gold. It's subtle on darker skin tones, and yet still is bling!"
5.0,We have several of these  and we love them
5.0,"I bought these for all-day performance motorcycle street riding. They are very breathable, rugged and really do help reduce ankle and calf area swelling. I would rate them comparable to most racing specific motorcycle socks at a MUCH cheaper price. I'm very satisfied with the purchase."
5.0,"Given as a gift, beautiful!"

5.0,I have large calves and they fit better than the compression socks.
5.0,"came after awhile, but I own 3 cause they are cool very cool"
5.0,"Very pretty piece! At first I was worried about it being overly fragile, but it doesn't seem to be. It's a bit big, but it's not too heavy so it's not hard to find a chain for it. As far as the leaf itself goes, it's in very good condition with no pieces missing and you can see the veins in the leaf. The detail's lovely."
5.0,Great fit and the material seems quite durable.
5.0,Nice fit good quality
5.0,Ring to clasp keeps coming undone
5.0,"My room gets so bright in the morning - I was waking up and never able to fall back to sleep.

5.0,This was delivered sooner than expected which worked out great because it was a birthday gift!  The item itself was beautifuly crafted and undamged!  Made a great gift!
5.0,The shoe was very comfortable
5.0,"I am extremely happy with this diaper bag! I love having a backpack but find that we end up with a million cars at the bottom weighing it down because we can't see everything.  I love how this can be a backpack or messenger bag, and that it opens up so you can see everything.  The quality is great for the price!"
5.0,"Beautiful necklace, just as described"
5.0,This sweater is great!!!  It’s light weight (but not see-through) so it’s perfect to wear in-between summer and fall.  It’s a little longer (ends right below my seat) which I REALLY like.  I ordered a Large and usually wear a Large so I think the sizing is true to US sizes.  (I'm about 5'7&#34;.)  I like it so much I’m considering ordering a second one in the other color.
5.0,"This hat is just right for walking the dog in the rain. It keeps my face dry, and is warm and comfortable.  It stays on well especially if I turn up the back collar to prevent pushing against my coat. Best of all, it's not scratchy. Great for gardening as well."
5.0,My husband loves the sunglasses and they fit perfectly!

It was still a loose fit (I prefer my hoodies this way) and was the perfect length. My daughter wears a small in juniors or a 16 in kids, and this was huge on her. Very happy with this purchase"

5.0,"Perfect for my 83 year dad, he loves them"

5.0,"I love this hat.. I love the price and how it looks. I had been shopping around took a gamble on this one. I wasn't expecting much because it was such a great deal. Really glad I bought it. I read the other reviews about how it arrived bent and such. I may have been lucky and had nice mail people handling my hat. It arrived in excellent condition. It was in a bag type package, so I could see how it could get beat up."

5.0,No cons at all. Perfect addition to the Evolour Dresser. Just perfect all the way around.

I was worried how it would look on me as I am only 5'4&#34;, heavier and large chested.  It was better than I could have hoped for.  Think I might order a few more in different colors!!"
5.0,Makes me feel so Young. Love the way it falls from the body enjoyed the light material in the color was perfect
5.0,I love these riding shorts
5.0,"Very sophisticated, but cute dress!  Arm holes are a bit saggy.  Will probably wear something over top or I could have it fitted.  A bit shorter on me than the model."
5.0,"I got the red with white polka dots, and my husband's eyes lit up when I tried it on.  It's very flattering, nice and roomy and cool.  Good weight to the fabric, but not at all thick.  I""m 5' 4"", so it hits the floor, but with a pair of heels, it'll be fine.  I'm glad I got this dress."
5.0,These are so very comfortable for my terrible aching feet!  I recommend highly if the pads on your feet are worn out.
5.0,"I love it fits great ,it's comfortable and worth every penny ...I'm so happy that I took a chance on this product it works better than my overpriced shaper that breaks after a few months..Tip go up a size because it runs small"

She has worn these as her 1st change from her original piercing and wont take them out! The backs stay on,  they dont tarnish, the details havent fallen off, her hair doesnt get caught in them and they dont poke her when sleeping. I highly recommend these!! Hopefully she will get tired of the unicorns soon so we can change to the other cute ones that came with the package."

5.0,"I bought these for a friend for Christmas and she loves them! For any Harry Potter lover, this is a great gift!"
5.0,Durable and exact match to dads designers
5.0,"This is a great example of an original design.  The sweater fits tight to the body which is how it should fit.  It is 100% wool but is not bulky at all.  If you are not used to a military style sweater or want a sweater that is loose, buy at least one size up."
5.0,"My son loves incredibles. Just as advertised. Not super soft material, but my child was more concerned with the characters"
5.0,So comfortable love this dress

5.0,Muchas gracias!!!!

5.0,These really help your mask from sticking to your face and they are comfortable too. I recently worked out in one.
5.0,We used this to decorate a pumpkin and it worked great
5.0,I like everything about these shirts.  They are completely perfect and I will be buying more of them.
5.0,"Should have read it, didn’t know it had elastic in it, wanted them to match a necklace I wear to church."
5.0,[[VIDEOID:687593a4f9d91a1cceb4144b49d608fb]] Fits as expected<br />Feels better than expected<br />Durability is 100%<br />Absolutely no cons.
5.0,"I’m 5’ 4” & 175lbs; l purchased a large in both black and wine. The dresses are consistent in sizing. They are fitted but not tight. The fabric is not stretchy but does give a little. I love how the dress helps define your waist, especially since I have a tummy. I wear a 38B but believe this dress would look amazing on a C or D cup. Since the fabric over laps up top, my B cup fits fine."
5.0,"So, so comfortable."
5.0,"Really cute dress!!! Glad I ordered, great fit and the length was alright above my knees."
5.0,Very nice rain coat. Thick and warm. It was a gift and my granddaughter loved it

5.0,Perfect for a little girl.  Small and dainty.
5.0,"the wristband doesnt fall or get out of place<br />the magnet is strong enought,<br />the material of the band is amazing"
5.0,Love it! Just as expected! Youth small for my 6year old she’s 46lbs 3’10 tall
5.0,Love this! Very comfortable and wearable. I would buy it again and am considering buying it in another color (although the pink looks fantastic)
5.0,"Substantial material, fully lined. Comfortable and flattering cut."
5.0,"Super cute! Lightweight, great for summer!"
5.0,Put on my luggage last week.  Worked just fine.
5.0,I bought 2 pair - each one for friends.  Then I bought a third for myself.  These in particular I love.  Absolutely wonderful - driving is so much better than with regular drk gray sunglasses.  Would HIGHLY recommend them.
5.0,Great headbands for the price! They look adorable on too!
5.0,Really beuty
5.0,"This is a cute onesie for a one year old. It fits true to size and it is stretchy material, so it should last longer. The material is really nice and lightweight. I love that the gold hands are a shiny Metalic gold color. If you’re gifting this, it comes with a product tag, which is wonderful because it looks new with a new tag."
5.0,Nice light cotton blend.  I bought one in green and pink and was very happy with both.  Large enough to tie into a vest or use as cover up.  Loved these.
5.0,"I purchased the red in an XL and it fit beautifully, though a bit tight in the bustline area. If you're larger in the chest area, you will likely show cleavage, so depending on the occasion, you may want to wear a camisole. It's also very long, even with heels. I am 5'5 and wore this with 2 inch wedge heel sandals and it still dragged on the ground, so I'm having it hemmed about 2 inches. Otherwise, it's a lovely dress, very flattering for curvy figures, and the red is very eye-catching, more of a tomato red than anything else. It's also very seasonal and can be worn probably year round, though the long sleeves might be hot in summertime, not to mention the rayon material. But perfect for spring, winter and fall."
5.0,"I ordered a small, I’m 5’1”, 117lbs. Fits well, might be a little roomy in the abdomen but my husband and I are planning to start trying for kids so it will give my belly room to grow... but I still like how it fits without the belly!"
5.0,Super soft material and very well made!  Its actually very flattering and yhe cross in front makes it look really nice. I would say sexy or femine.  The color is awesme too super bold and pretry.
5.0,PERFECT BACKPACK  WAS SO GOOD I BUY ONE MORE.
5.0,"So cute ！My son wants to wear it to go anywhere, and it also looks very warm."
5.0,"This is a really well done hat for golf - nice soft material in the mesh, plenty of stretch to fit your head, lots of sweat absorption for the summer months out on the links. Hooey makes a quality product, and I never fail to get a comment when I'm out on the course about the hat and the brand logo. Stylish colors make this particular one a standout. I loved this hat so much I got one in a different style for my brother in law for Father's Day."
5.0,See my earlier review. We gulped when we heard the price.
5.0,My son loves it and the straps are easy for him to use. They are holding up well months later
5.0,The best 👑
5.0,Bought for a promise ring to my high school sweetheart give to me my birthday and was scared was to look good  amazing looking love it
5.0,This dress is absolutely gorgeous on. I ordered two Mediums in black and one in blue. The blue is a beautiful deep rich color. I ended up trying both dresses. The right arm on one was very snug. I have very tinted arms so it may just be me. Both fit like a glove.  My 19 year old daughter ended up taking the dress and wearing it to the gala we were to attend! She wears a 6 and I wear between 6 and 8. I wear a 38D in bra size. The medium fits like a glove.  Wish I'd gotten  a large for wiggle room. Great dress! Nice quality!
5.0,Definitely glad I ordered up a size and bought the XL.  It fits beautifully and love the flare of the skirt.  I used a shiny belt to give it a bit more flare.
5.0,"These came quickly and looks exactly as shown in the red I chose. It came in a very pretty gift box with a bow on it, The ball part has red crystals in it that were all in tact and had a red pearl like ball on the bottom drop of it. It looks great on and is easy to wear. Its light in weight and I got a lot of compliments when I wore it to a dance event with my red dress. No complaints here its a nice pair of earrings although it is not nickel free, You can easy just coat the post with clear nail polish which I did and I was able to wear it for a night out no problem, easy fix. These would make a great gift<br /><br />This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Regardless that I'm asked to review a product all my opinion are completely my own! I always read other reviews before purchasing any product myself and rely on them myself. If there is a product that I find is not 5 stars I will always contact the seller first to see if the issue can be resolved, and will note this. I've been really fortunate I have only had a few handfuls of products to date that have been not turned out great. I will also like to note I generally am allowed to choose what I pick to product test so more often then not these are products I'm looking forward to testing or already thinking of purchasing. Therefore less likely to be disappointed. That being said if you check my reviews I have not been shy to rate any product less then 5 including the lowest rating if it is warranted. Also if you have any questions on a product I have purchased and review feel free to ask =)<br />**If you found this review helpful, please vote by replying Yes to 'Was this review helpful' *"

5.0,"This dress is perfect! First it seem very complicated to put on, but it all workout out perfectly!"
5.0,"Very comfortable to sleep in!  After buying a pair of these a few years ago, I can't sleep in anything else anymore, and I bought a few more."
5.0,"This is my new favorite thing! I didn’t even know such a thing existed until I came across it while searching for an umbrella. Anyway, I have 3 boys ages 4, 8, and 13. It fit around all their necks (doesn’t fit my husband’s though 🙁). As long as they stay relatively still the hair is contained. (We just put on a movie). It has made clean up SO much easier! No more vacuuming or sweeping after haircuts! 👍🏻"
5.0,"These were perfect, my son loves them and they were the right size!"
5.0,"Looks good on, covers my belly good"
5.0,"Fits well, material not overly thin and drapes nicely. Felt true to size, though a little snug in the chest. For reference, I generally wear an XL or 14 maybe 16 in tops and 14/16 in jeans, and purchased the XL. I'm around 5'6"" and the skirt reached to about an inch above my knee.<br /><br />I bought in two colors- one a lighter pattern and the other a darker pattern. I mention this because the material has some stretch to it, which gives the darker color a shiny white kind of background when stretched. It's nearly unnoticeable on the lighter pattern.  There is also a slight fuzzing to the material (more like a halo effect than any kind of pilling?) to the material after a couple wears that is much more noticeable to the darker dress than the light one."
5.0,Fabric and style as shown.
5.0,"Great watch, I've worn it for weeks and I'm extremely happy. Highly recommended!"

5.0,"The sweater is a bit on the small side, but it's not so small that I can't wear it comfortably. It has a very silky feel, it goes with a lot of my outfits and it's perfect for this transition season between summer and fall. I hope to buy the same sweater in a few more colors."
5.0,Cooling beautiful fabric that is super comfortable and the fit is perfect. I might even buy a pair for my daughter as a gift. Highly recommend!
5.0,Lots of compliments about the color.  The Flamingos and the material.  I was hoping it was more the color of the pix but it came a little darker blue than pictured.  Nonetheless is fit like a USA size and had great delivery time.  AAAAAA
5.0,These socks are just so ADORABLE! They are soooo soft and comfy! I love them. I really wish I had gotten 2 packs because now they are not available. :-( Hopefully they will be back in stock soon! I wear a size 6 1/2 to 7 in shoes and these fit absolutely perfectly. I give 5 Stars! I definitely recommend!
5.0,"I wasn't sure how sizing was going to work out with this.  I tend to wear size large and the according to the size chart I should get a large.  Turns out I like the fit.  I would say it's an athletic cut.  When it comes to athletic cut, I usually go xl.  But I got this to block wind while I'm cycling and I like the fit.  Not loose and flappy which is perfect for cycling."
5.0,A gift for my son. He loved it.
5.0,"4th pair I've purchased. I love oversized sunglasses, these are perfect."
5.0,"Love this hoodie for cooler days. It's all I need to stay cozy and warm, looks great with jeans or tights. I can even wear it with shorts on breezy summer night's"

5.0,"Finally, got my husband to throw out his old tattered bath wrap!!  This is exactly what he likes...........very light weight and comfortable fit."

5.0,Absolutely love these (5067 version). Super comfortable and doesn't feel restrictive. I'll definitely buy again. I purchased a small.
5.0,Great fit and quality shirt. I'm taller so usually have trouble with extra large shirts being too short
5.0,"Very beautiful tie clip! Ordering things like this onlinr makes me nervous, since you have to determine the quality of a product based on other peoples reviews. This product is a win as far as quality and beauty goes. It looks very shard clipped on a tie and cross is the perfect size."

5.0,I love these! They have a little stretch but they are not so tight to cause a headache like the size medium were (from a different seller).<br />We use them for covering our ears to keep them warm from the bitter cold during the winter Ohio months when we are in our hot tub! They dry quickly after use. I highly recommend these!
5.0,My grandchildren love
5.0,Excellent I would buy again
5.0,You get what you pay for it. These are not top of the line but they're cute and I received a lot of compliments when I wear the yellow ones. Invest in different backing. But the price is worth the purchase.

5.0,Great purchase! Love my house slippers. Warm and comfy. A bit big but I am not running in them.
5.0,"Rare find, I like these shoes."
5.0,So I bought this for my fiancé and when I say it works I mean he shredded a pretty good amount of weight in just two weeks. Our baby was born last year September and he’s been trying to get rid of all the baby weight and the sweat suit really helped. And when I say he sweated I mean there were puddles of sweat on the floor. Really great buy.
5.0,So this is my second buy as they are good masks to have. Has a nose wire and filter pocket plus it covers your chin for better protection. Will definitely recommend this.
5.0,"Took almost 2 weeks to arrive, but worth the wait! Super cute for school and my daughter says they're really comfortable. We're only 2 weeks into using them, but so far no complaints."

5.0,"Fits good, light weight, and different tops can go with it."
5.0,"During a move, I found a lot of my old pants that are a little tight - as I can not button them after I zip them up.  With this large selection of choices within this package, I can select the button extenders that best match.  Now I have a huge selection of blue jeans and work pants I have just incorporated into my wardrobe due to these extenders, and I no longer need to go shopping for more pants.  Win Win!!!!!!!"
5.0,"fit percfect all good, arrived on time . . . . . . . . . . recommended . ."
5.0,Very cute.  Lots of complements every time she wears them.  They do fall off easily. Think the strap should be more high or the shoe not so wide.  Very nice though.

5.0,"Great slippers. Comfortable, strong and best of all my grandson loves it."

5.0,Love the strap. Sit at hip.  Matches my Coach handbag.
5.0,"Very shiny and just the right size to wear. Makes a statement and very well made, will order more from this seller."
5.0,"This is very comfortable bra, the fabric is soft and breathable, and it stretches just enough. I do not use it for working out, but to be comfortable around the house. It might not have enough compression or support for exercising, I haven't tried it. I am a 34C cup and got the Medium size. Overall it is a great quality bra and I would recommend it."
5.0,"Soft cashmere like, beautiful color! Love it!! Wear to keep warm and a punch of fun pink color!"

5.0,"I walk my dogs on a busy road with no sidewalks.  I do it early in the morning as soon as it is light enough to be seen but less traffic.  The only bright sweatshirts I could find were construction man orange and trash picker mt dew neon green.  As a plus size woman the women's sweatshirts weren't loose enough or long enough to be worn in cold weather over multiple sweatshirts.  I found these and despite some negative reviews bought hot pink, sunshine yellow and tie dye brights.  LOVE THEM.  I have worn and washed all of them.  I will buy more.  I found these to be medium weight, fit to size, and soft inside."
5.0,Shirt is very cute and soft. It fits like a women's cut tshirt. I was hoping it would be a little looser but it fits fine.
5.0,I liked the way it felt and the colors
5.0,I love these belts I had seen the YouTube add for them and was skeptical but when the need came along for a new belt. (After losing some weight) I can say it fits comfortably and it’s easy to use. I ended up buying one for everyday wear after I liked the one I had for work so much.
5.0,"Made beautifully and the right size for a necklace. The Girls LOVED it, would recommend and purchase any time again"
5.0,I love the dress. I was worried it would be see through because the video makes it look very sheer but I had three people check it in the sunlight and it is not see through because the material is dark! I got so many compliments the day I wore too! I would buy this dress again in a heartbeat.
5.0,Perfect for my toddler. Keeps the sun out of his face while playing outside

5.0,"This lovely, long, handmade (of course) necklace goes with just about everything!  I especially love it with my tunics because they set each other off!  The metal hanging pieces are more beautiful when you actually see it - the detail work catches the light with movement and are just stunning!  My daughter keeps threatening to steal it!  So, so glad I bought it!!"
5.0,Well made and colorful !
5.0,The band are comfortable
5.0,love it! Turquoise is my favorite summer color  and it fits my outfits.
5.0,Comfortable but gives me a mad muffin top
5.0,"I bought these for the gym. They fit perfectly under my gym shorts.<br /><br />I noticed while wearing this product my legs stay warm, without retaining too much heat. They have a good balance. They also stay dry during exercise, and are extremely comfortable. Very “stretchy.”<br /><br />Having quality gym-wear puts you in a fitness-minded mood. It has been said, “The hardest thing about going to the gym is GOING to the gym.” This is to say it’s mental as much as physical. When you dress for exercise it puts you in the proper state of mind, and helps you achieve your fitness goal(s).<br /><br />I will buy this product again."

5.0,"These boots are BEAUTIFUL!! Im 5'10&quot; and the boots came about two inches below my knee, which I love. The calf width was perfect to wear over jeans or leggings with thick socks. I wear a 9 and ordered that size and they still fit with good socks. The material feels like real leather and is good quality. I would order these boots again."
5.0,So Comfortable!  Lots of give!  Love them!
5.0,"WOW! Love these shoes. I wanted some nicer sneakers for work on Fridays, and these fit the bill. They're very comfortable with excellent arch support. Like to get wides when I can, but I figured 8M would be fine with the shape of this shoe. I was right. The PK (Performance Knit) fabric is very lightweight and attractive. Love the retro look. Great summer sneakers."
5.0,"I bought this ring on Ebay for approximately the same price. I bought it to wear as to work so I don't destroy my diamond engagement ring, but I still have a ring to wear. (I've destroyed many rings by wearing them to work) This heart ring is cute and fits perfect. I love it, so much that when I wear my diamond I wear this one on my other hand just so I don't have to take it off"

This is the one he gravitated to though.)<br />I hope it continues to be offered as I know I will need to get a replacement once he wears this one out.<br />Thank you!"

5.0,Very heavy duty. I use for my equipment key set which is very heavy and have never had a problem. Takes the dirt and dust like a champ

5.0,Package arrived as stated. It fits comfortably
5.0,It is very challenging to buy clothing for my wife. She is very particular about her style and she is very direct and vocal about what she likes and does not:) I decided to take my chance with this button shirt because she likes black and she always needs button shirts for work. It worked out great! It fits her perfectly. I ordered large because she has big boobs. She loves it so much that she told me it is one of her favorite shirts now. I might order a second one soon.
5.0,Haven't taken it off since I took it out out of the box
5.0,I am new to boxing and have used these gloves 2 times so far..... I LOVE them!  No blisters or sore spots.  These are real leather and about half the price of Title Boxing's plastic gloves.  Size medium fits me perfectly.  Great value!!
5.0,"Very thick, just like a blanket. I am sure it will get a lot of use with my first North East winter. This is perfect for me."
5.0,compfortable.
5.0,Very great goggles at a cheap price. I wear these for hours at a time in my chemistry lab and have never had any issues with ventilation of the goggles or the strap digging in to my head. They’re incredibly comfortable and considering how cheap these are I’d highly recommend them.
5.0,So far so good! They feel sturdy and look great. I got the purple ones. I love giant glasses and these fit the bill.
5.0,This is a very nice watch. Well worth the cost.

5.0,My Baby was so Handsome.
5.0,love it! size small 5'2 113lbs
5.0,"Awesome shades. Made well, and are easy to keep clean. If these were RayBans branded, they would easily be selling for twice the price. American Optics are the original aviators and blow RayBans out of the water. This is my 3rd pair, and only due to the fact that I lose sunglasses often. (At this price, you can afford to lose a pair or two!) Green glass shows colors accurately. I couldn't be happier! Get some!"
5.0,The size fit perfect and they seem to be good quality. I would absolutely order these again or recommend them to others. It’s also a great price for the amount you get.
5.0,Excelente calidad por un precio muy vajo

5.0,"Obsessed. This necklace is everything. Exactly as pictured, great quality and stunning necklace. Oh, and did I mention it's a DINOSAUR!?!"
5.0,These are absolutely beautiful in person. They definitely catch your eye and will grab attention. They came in a cute box with a polish cloth. The quality is amazing and I honestly can't believe how gorgeous they are for such a modest price. I will be purchasing more for my mother and MIL.
5.0,So cozy & warm!! Great style too.
5.0,"Love, love this dress.  I’m a curvy girl and it’s so flattering and form fitting, that I always get compliments when I wear it....even from 17 yr old, who is very picky.  Love it."
5.0,"Exactly like the picture. In its shortest form, it perfectly fit my friend's wrist, who has a strong build."
5.0,"Beautiful color!! The lights are so great, what a lovely touch. Every umbrella should be solar powered!! Easy to put together and seems very durable. Great price for this product, worth every penny."
5.0,these head bands were exactly what I needed to keep my hair out of my face. I was a little worried that they would squeeze my head but that wasn't an issue. I love these head bands and still love them!
5.0,"I love these stainless steel earrings so much I bought two pair in case they are discontinued. Very comfortable, shiny and lightweight. The attached cz post is an extra bonus which I couldn't even tell from the picture."
5.0,The shirt is amazing. It was a little shorter than I had hoped but it is accurate based on the photos. I do recommend washing it once before wearing it as it has a weird smell to it. Fits true to size!
5.0,NICE....KIDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD LIKED IT ALONG WITH MY OTHER EASTER DISPLAY ITEMS...<br />ALL GAINED FROM AMAZON.....
5.0,"My son ABSOLUTELY loves this shirt.  Great quality, fits true to size, and it's been worn and washed tons and still looks brand new."
5.0,Love the earrings. Smaller than I anticipated but they work perfectly for what I wanted. 5 stars!!!!
5.0,very nice and a bit heavy. good for stretching with weights. the ball has spring buttons to secure into place & when removing from jewellery must be taken out from front (not side of jewelry). A bit tricky getting ball correctly positioned when putting in place to wear earrings.
5.0,This is my husband's favorite mask. Fits well. Has a nice texture. Great quality!
5.0,"Such a gorgeous and elegant dress!  Size 8 was too large for 55 pound 9 year old.  I would have exchanged it for a 7, but they were out.  The seller packed it beautifully in a box instead of stuffing it in a bag like some.  I wish it would have worked."
5.0,Wonderful corgi key
5.0,"Beautiful top! I typically wear a large however in all of PattyBoutik clothing I need to order an xl. I'm 5'8, 180lbs, 36 to 38C cup. I consistently receive compliments every time I am wearing something from this line.  The designers definitely know how to flatter a womans curves in a sexy yet professional way. Wish this top came in more colors."
5.0,Fits good. Looks good. Happy with my purchase!
5.0,Great summer dress. Cool and comfortable. Fits well and I picked a pattern that hides the lumps and bumps. Lol. I’ll wear this all summer
5.0,Like it very much. Great size.
5.0,"This bathing suit is better quality than I expected for the price honestly. I hunted around for awhile looking for this style bathing suit with little luck, either too expensive or the affordable ones were very low quality. Adorable retro style.

5.0,Absolutely love this shirt and want it in every color now! The fit is perfect and it is so versatile to wear with leggings or any other bottom. I got a size small
5.0,"A beautiful architectural piece, comfortable because it is  also adjustable. I have many Alessi pieces for my home and now this collar will be something interesting to wear as a statement piece.  Ciao Bella."
5.0,They worked perfect
5.0,Beautiful. This robe fits perfectly and looks gorgeous.
5.0,I like it will continue using it. I also have the silicone which I like too but in summer sweaty behind the band makes my wrist sweat and itchy skin peel. I do switch in between seasons.
5.0,Everyone notices them and seems to like them. I adore them
5.0,"My wife loves the fit, comfort and material."
5.0,Easy to setup. Easy to adjust to large or small luggage

5.0,I bought it for a three year old and it was VERY long; pretty but could trip up a little one.
5.0,The chain is just the right thing to accent several of my pieces.  Good stuff!
5.0,They fit me perfectly (size 0) and are beautiful! So happy!
5.0,"I purchased the cross cross long sleeve, and it is definitely a bit oversized. I bought a large and probably could have sized down to a medium and still have it fit oversized (For reference I’m 5’4”, 180 lbs and wear a 36DD) the color is also lighter than the picture but still a great color and fabric!"
5.0,We love these masks they fit perfect!
5.0,It's beautiful I get so many compliments on it

5.0,I am a plus size 5’4” the xxl fits very well. I bought this dress for the Halloween season it is perfect!
5.0,Great material its light and soft I love it!
5.0,"I really like this dress! It's modern but with a retro style. I bought it to simulate a 1940's look. Comfortable, well-made, quality fabric (not see-through, nice drape and with a bit of give). Flattering fit. Recommended. (If it helps: I'm 4'11&#34; so it hits mid-shin on me. 38&#34; 34&#34; 42&#34;.)"
5.0,"I wear these earrings almost every day and just ordered another pair just in case I lose one. They're easy to out on, and they stay closed even after vigorous activity or a full night's sleep.  They are low key, but not too small."
5.0,The quality surprised me.  Strong thick stretchable cotton. Will order more from this company.
5.0,These gloves are super warm. I make deliveries early in the morning and these gloves keep my hands warm.

5.0,"She adores this! Fits well, washes well, adorable all around."
5.0,I gave these heelys to both of my daughters and they love them. They fit both girls with room to spare. Easy to take the wheel off and put it back on. The look  of enjoyment on their faces as they slide along in the mall and park is priceless.
5.0,"My mom is obsessed with Freddie Mercury. So, I got this as a gag/surprise so she could pose as Freddie in pics. The packaging was apparently unmarked, and there was no way to leave a note that it was from me. When she slid it out of the packaging, it was so realistic, that it scared her and she dropped it. For days she pondered where this awesome mask came from. She thought maybe it was a freebie from all the calendars she's ordered. Finally, baffled, she tells me what she received in the mail. I told her it was from me and to send a pic with the mask. She loves it so much that she refuses to take it out of the packaging. So, she sent a photo of it in the clear plastic wrapper. Lol"
5.0,"This bra is great!  I did not buy it for nursing. I bought it because I love loose bras.  I HATE when the bras are super tight with uncomfortable wires, because I have a lung issue.<br /><br />It also snaps in the front.  The straps are adjustable.  I bought a nice colored pink.  It is really cute.  If you're looking for a loose fitting bra (but not too loose), I would say get a little larger number for around the horizontal band for the chest.  I got a 38 or 40 but normally I'm a 36.<br /><br />I can wear it to sleep and that's what I love about this."
5.0,My teen and her friends love this hoodie
5.0,Love this top.  Covers you up but keeps you cool.  Highly recommend!

5.0,My favorite shirt. You can wear it off the shoulder which I normally do. So cute and comfy.
5.0,"They are amazing, smooth and fit perfect! Very happy with delivery time and quality!"
5.0,"Works just like described, no issues at all. Fossil brand, not a knock-off like some of the other reviews suggest."
5.0,This was just a little love from me to my daughter who was heading off to Navy boot camp. She loved it.
5.0,"While these lounge pants will make people's jaw drop as to color and design; I purchased a pair, from the same company 2 years ago and realized that they were my favorites in terms of quality, comfort and fit.  It started a line of garish sleep pants which was becoming a ""trademark"", if you will, of the flamboyant side of me, yet I like these and the earlier pair fir their comfort and durability.  I wish they had more design options - I'd get more."
5.0,"All 4 of my pants fit, all the colors are great spring colors, the prices were great, and I received them just as expected on time!"

5.0,The hat was way too large for me but that was my fault. Believe me when they say large it’s large.Check size before ordering. Going to give this one to my buddy (hoghead) and order me a medium
5.0,"For an inexpensive watchband it looks great!  Don't know how long it will stay that way, but at the price, it can be replaced frequently."
5.0,I loved this dress. I wore it at a cookout. It was so comfortable and cute. I tied a knot on the side to make it a little sexier and trendy. But I also liked it without the knot. I would recommend this dress.
5.0,"Good quality, great fit, looks great on!"
5.0,This lightweight sweater is super soft and comfortable. Fits perfectly
5.0,"First off, these arrived so much faster than expected and were well packaged.  The little box will be excellent for traveling and keeping up with my jewelry. Please ignore the ""Buttons"" in the second picture. They did not come with this set and were simply where I put them so that I could try on the Onyx plugs in the last picture immediately. They do seem a tad smaller than most of my day to day plugs, but they sit perfectly and stay put once they are in. There are a couple of the synthetics that feel 'off' if you are used to wearing natural stones, but no one would be able to tell that they aren't the real deal unless they are handling them or know exactly what they are looking at. The three wood plugs seem to be just stained wooden plugs. No idea as to what type of wood or anything exotic. They are still lovely and could absolutely be worn solo or paired with anything.  At less than $1.50 a pair, you cannot beat this deal. I will DEFINITELY order from Evevil again.  LOVE THEM!!  BUY THEM!! SHOW THEM OFF!!"
5.0,Really nice blouse with bow. Looks nice with jeans or with slacks.
5.0,"***I received this complimentary item in exchange for my honest & unbiased review, which is exactly what I will provide***<br />I own at least a dozen or so watches that I alternate depending upon activity, attire, and occasion.  I do my own regular watch maintenance including battery changes and band adjustments.  Working on watches is always a case where having the right tool for the job is essential.  This simple but effective tool is great for removing the pins that hold watch band links together.  The pins are typically very small and very firmly set.  To use this, simply place the watch band on the base, align the pin punch screw press with the pin hole (adjusting for the height of the watch band by using the adjustment dial set into the base), then dial in the pin punch press.  The pin can then be easily removed.  Replacement works the same way, only using the second press which has a flat surface to push the pin back in.<br />This tool is nice and solid with precision fit parts, works very well, and comes with 2 extra pin press attachments.  I am very satisfied with it, and highly recommend it if you need to or anticipate needing to work on a watch band."
5.0,tyty it never leaves my person hehehhe
5.0,This is a beautiful ring that fits exactly as expected. I only wish they had a wider variety of sizes so I could have gotten it for a different finger.

Makes a great something new and something blue gift for the bride.

5.0,Like all my other Sperry shoes I adore these sneakers.They are very comfortable and have good soles that keep me from slipping. I will continue to buy Sperry shoes because I have never been disappointed.
5.0,I love it! Beautiful and excelentes quality.
5.0,These are going to be give as a Birthday Gift.  I let you know what the word will be once they are given. they great I just may order a pair for myself.
5.0,Excellent value.  It really exceeded my expectations.
5.0,This was a Birthday gift and our Daughter loved it.
5.0,Wow I love it that’s what I look for I will order them again
5.0,Love these! Exactly what I was looking for! There is a grip on the heel so they don't slip and they don't show with certain shoes.
5.0,Big enough to cover your good clothes. Easy to put on and strings tied easily. Plastic did not tear-sturdy!
5.0,Likes what he likes
5.0,"Beautifully selected pearls, match nicely and the luster is perfect.  My granddaughter loved the cushioned backing on this earring.  I was very happy with this purchase."
5.0,"Very pleased with the band.  It seems well made and the color is much more,appealing than the original black band.  I ordered lavender and it's very nice.  My original band wasn't staying connected to the watch face, this one does.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this band to any fit bit user."
5.0,i like this produce for my pandora bracelet
5.0,"This is such a beautiful feminine piece!  I could not be more pleased! The workmanship on the filigree is just perfect. The chain that comes with it seemed a little too delicate for me, so I did buy a different chain because I never take it off, (I sleep and shower in it).  It holds a very tiny amount of ashes, it was easy to fill and it is smooth against my skin!  I had bought another one (from a different seller) and it broke while securing the ashes (can you imagine, how disappointing that was)?  When looking for a replacement I came across this lovely piece and I am so glad I did, it is so much nicer than the first one I bought.  It is a wonderful comforting way to hold the ashes of my soulmate!  I would buy for this seller again, and I absolutely recommend this stunning little piece!"
5.0,"I bought the orange dress for my sister.  I originally got it so she could show Halloween spirit at work without having to wear a costume; turns out the stripe is really navy and not black.  That actually worked to her favor because she really likes the style and cut.<br />It  is a classic fit and flare.  Choosing the size was a bit of guess, as the size chart they provide is little funky. For sizes medium and large, it lists the UK and US sizes as the same.  I can't speak for certain about the other sizes, but I think the number sizes are UK, not US sizes.  My sister typically wears a size 6. I know she doesn't like to wear tight/revealing clothes to work, so  I got the her the medium (10/12). She said it fits with a little room, probably like an 8 (equivalent of a UK 10).<br />So, if you are questioning which size to buy, I would consider the number as the UK size (meaning buy a size up).<br />My sister about 5'5"" and the dress hits her around the knee, so the length listed on the chart seems accurate.<br />She likes it so much, she may get another in a different color. She plans on seeing how it wears and washes before doing so, though."
5.0,The color pops and I like it very much. Good for indoor soccer.
5.0,I ordered 2 floral print dresses and they are really very nice. I like the adjustable straps and the fabric is soft and looks like it's a good quality. I like to hand wash certain clothing and I think it will work well with my dresses. I'm so impressed that I may order a few more!
5.0,I gave 5 starts because i believe people would buy this to accent their halloween costumes which i only bought to put with a black shirt to kind of make it colorful. It is a very beautiful scarf but honestly i do not think it is worth the price. It is very small and i do know i did not look at the size when i purchased it which is on me. The colors and designs are very beautiful though! I would recommend if you are looking for a small accent scarf.
5.0,"Love, love, love!  Exactly as pictured!  Amazing quality!  Definitely buy a size down though.  I'm usually a Medium and the torso of the dress was very large on me.  It's still amazing and I can sew, so it is not a big deal at all.  10/10 will be buying more!"
5.0,"Very pleased. What should I say? I love it. Sits nicely on my night stand and quietly winds my Seiko Kinetic, or my other Seiko automatic watches (when I don't wear them).<br />Full proof Prime service from Amazon. It arrived exactly after 2 days. Was well packed. Content looked new.<br />The only other competitive online service I am using and can compete with Amazon, is Newegg. However I think Amazon is faster (but for a price, Prime).<br />Thank you!"
5.0,"I got exactly what I expected. Good quality, bright colors, great quality key chain ring attached."
5.0,Great cap. Fast shipping
5.0,My daughter loved this! Does not feel cheap at all! Nice material.
5.0,I love this dress. It has not shrunk after many wash and dry cycles. I ordered itin black so of course it attracts everything around; as in lint or hair etc. super comfy I wear it everywhere. I will be ordering this again in other colors
5.0,Accurate description and easy to use!
5.0,"These are the cutest, nicest, most interesting low cut womens' socks. I think they will last a long time. They are comfortable, good material. I love them!"
5.0,"I wore one of these for probably 15 or 20 years as a baseball umpire during games when I worked the plate. Before I learned about the Hidden Tailor, a couple of ball bags and some light gear like a lineup card clipboard, strike counter, and pencil, tended to drag my pants down after numerous squats and stand-ups calling pitches. I learned about this trick from some professional umpires, and it worked for me! Now I volunteer on a CERT team and carry even more weight in the pockets of my cargo pants. Still works! I just bought another exactly like the first - not because the first one is worn out - it isn't - but just to be sure I have a spare to tuck in my kit. Great product - 5 stars all around!"
5.0,love it !! buy it !!
5.0,"It’s nice, wish I would’ve ordered a large, not a Med. it’s about the size of a dime... probably will have to return after Christmas, for a large (it’s a Christmas gift) but over all it’s what I ordered... I like it... I would keep the Med. for myself, but it’s for my husband"
5.0,"Perfect size, love the extra wallet space. Super cute and well made."
5.0,I got the larger size and it is a little tight but doable.
5.0,"searched everywhere to find a great necklace with a great price and this is it! Awesome too quality product!!! I am very impressed with how shiny and pretty it is. Its stainless steel so its going to last, which is what I needed. I am just so pleased at how great of a price this is! I love to get a deal and get something I feel is worth much more to be honest, but im certainly not complaining! I'm going to reccomend them to everyone. The necklace arrived in a pretty velvet bag too! Will definitely be ordering more in the future. You won't be disappointed!"
5.0,This watch is so beautifully made. I bought the purple one and it is the same color in person. In fact the picture doesn't do it justice. Highly recommend this watch!
5.0,"this has become my most favorite necklace! the coloring is beautiful and the metal work is meticulous! The weight is heavy enough that the necklace lays flat, but not so heavy that you feeled weighted down. Shipping took a long time, but that was clearly spelled out in the details.  It was well worth the wait!"
5.0,"I have bought many gifts from timberline traders for my girlfriend and they never disappoint! Great customer service, and even arrived early! Highly recommend these products."
5.0,"I've had this bag at least 10 years. I've tried others in between, but always go back to my iLi New York bag. Unfortunately, this one now doesn't fit my new S22+ phone. Not to worry though; there's the same bag on their site, except mesh outside pocket to see the phone, and it's in landscape instead of portrait. I ONLY purchase bags with grommet holes for the straps. I credit those stainless steel grommets for holding this bag together. There is no fraying whatsoever inside the bag; the zippers have held up excellently over the years and still work; the leather has softened even more over time, even though the leather is a thick, high quality - you just can't go wrong with iLi New York. My only issue would be - until the leather ""wears"" as much as possible on the strap, the black ink will leave a mark on clothing, which I discovered in the rain (no umbrella). Easy fix - I don't use it crossbody when it's raining; tuck it under arm or carry like a clutch. And now that the bag is 10 yrs old, the ink has faded to a nice, worn black/gunmetal grey. The strap is not adjustable, but I tied mine in a knot at the top. Voila! Just the right length for me!! Shop no more once you've found a great iLi bag for you!!"
5.0,It's a nice piece of glasses for cheap price. My kids love it. The pouch in the picture does not include with the items. It misleads customers.
5.0,"Only took 3 minutes to install, make a huge visual difference on my galaxy s3."
5.0,A good rendition of a current media message and colourful tee.  A good item for gifting.
5.0,"It's original jewelry, I like it.<br />Yin-Yang tree elements for you. Perfect like amulet for elements correction."

5.0,Great shirt. Fits perfect
5.0,This is exactly what I was hoping it would be! A perfect gift for my sister’s birthday.
5.0,Initially I ordered a pair in size 10 for my husband but they were too small. Wish cotton the supplier was extremely helpful and sent me a size 11.  The fit just fine and husband has been wearing them. In fact he just asked for a 2nd pair as they feel so comfortable on his feet. My husband is very difficult to please so this says something and their customer service is so good.
5.0,Ordered this to wear after my bilateral breast reduction. I am three weeks into recovery and this bra has been very comfortable to wear during recovery.

5.0,Perfect for my daughter to wear to my baby shower. It fits her perfectly and I love the back.
5.0,"I love this top (as a matter of fact I'm even wearing it today. It fits well and looks good on me. It hides a lot of problems with the design and I usually am not one for patterns but I like the pattern on this. The colors are subtle and pretty with pinks, blues and greys throughout it."
5.0,Great look and craftsmanship.
5.0,I love the clarity of the stone.  The charm picks up the light around it.  I brought it for my Pandora bracelet.

5.0,Excellent skirt for little girls wanting to have a pencil skirt!
5.0,Beautiful love it. Not too hot and not to thin either. Can wear on the winter and summer
5.0,"This tee is super comfortable and the fabric is actually better quality than I expected.<br /><br />Size-wise, I’m almost always a medium in tops and this medium fit perfectly. It’s a nice relaxed fit - not so loose that it’s draping but not body-hugging either. I also like the longer lenth."
5.0,Beautiful style and color . Used them for a Mardi Gras party
5.0,"Great, fits well, very comfortable."
5.0,I like this top. It fits a little loose and I feel comfortable wearing it casually or to work.
5.0,Fit perfectly and gave the exact look I wanted to my Sweetdresses 50s style skirt I also purchased. Just the perfect amount of flounce.
5.0,Color and size were spot on. Very feminine and soft. Washed well (in laundry bag). Can be dressed up or down
5.0,I believe the sizing is for children. I bought a large but in other brands (Lululemon) I wear size 6. Once you buy the correct fitting top it is fun (solution cut out the size tag)  and the color is amazing.
5.0,it's a little snug but I'm going to make it work
5.0,Simply Fabulous.  Looking forward to seeing just how it works when it gets cold.
5.0,These are perfect arch support for those suffering from Fasciitis. Just got them. Very Comfortable and I have high arches. I bought 4 pairs.
5.0,I love this because it is so easy to throw on and look nice.  I can wear with sneakers for a casual look or throw on a pair of heels and a sweater and its nice enough to wear out.
5.0,"This costume is a perfect fit and all around an amazing quality for the price! I had saved up for so long to buy this costume after being a die hard Green Arrow fan for 16 years, and now that it’s here and I have it I can’t believe it’s real! It’s such a comfortable material and light weight. The Quiver is just a tad loose on me, but that is a very minor thing. I am absolutely in love with this costume and I cannot thank you guys enough!"
5.0,Love it great to have when you go out or shopping and you don't want abig bag . Also I love the different compartments so you will know where things are.The long strap is what I wanted cross the body.
5.0,Zipper irritates back (inside). Caused a rash.
5.0,"adorable! the strap is a little stiff but I love it. fits my phone, wallet, keys and lip balm perfectly. and the colors are subtle but when they shine they're beautiful!"
5.0,Wore this dress for a wedding and received so many compliments.  The fit and the style was flattering for my shape and I was very comfortable. Ordering more.
5.0,it fit perfectly. my granddaughter loved it.
5.0,My granddaughter is 10 but already in a woman's size clothes.  It really makes it hard to find clothes appropriate for a 10 year old.  I was really unsure about this swim suit but seen I could send it back if it didn't fit so decided to try it.  I measured her and and went with the size that would be good for her breast and hips The fit is perfect.  We liked it so much we ordered another one in a different color.
5.0,These are nice aprons.
5.0,"Cute and so comfy! Love the rainbow stripe down the side, and I love that they actually have pockets."
5.0,"I ordered 3 of these.  I love them.  I have washed and worn them all and I have had no issues whatsoever. I like the slim arm sleeves, because that is actually one part of my body that's slim!!!  Although they are not tight at all. Just perfect for me.  I'm 5ft 6"", 150lbs and I got the Large.  Great fit."
5.0,Product fit as expected... and it looks adorable on my 3yo. It is longer than expected but my daughter loves it ... cute and comfy!!
5.0,They are great fitting cute trendy comfy footwear that I can wear and walk in all day. I also have the blush color. Love these
5.0,I love that we can't see these socks when my daughter is wearing tennis shoes. She loves the different critters on them. They don't fall off when she is running around inside or in her shoes outside.
5.0,"Love it! Perfect size. Had a small problem getting the charm onto the necklace, but I worked it out."
5.0,I love these pants so much I bought a few pair. Then I bought a pair for my sister! She loves them too. They are soooo comfortable and I LOVE the side pockets!!! They are well made and beautiful and COMFORTABLE....I'll be buying more as well.

5.0,Been using these December  thru February and they’ve been great just as advertised!
5.0,"When I first started carrying mail I was told by the ""Old Guy"" in the station that the only way to not get blisters was to wear thin cotton socks and over top wear thin wool socks in summer and thick ones in winter. Lesson learned. When I hike I still like to have the 100% cotton sock with the wool on top. He was right. No blisters! These are thin, just perfect for my needs."
5.0,Was well satisfied with selection.
5.0,"This is a birthday gift for husband next week.  I am sure he will like the belts, nicely made and perfect colors."
5.0,I bought these for a hippy costume but liked them enough to wear them on the regular!<br /><br />Not as orange as I thought they’d be but I kind of like that. Perfect size and make the best summer sunglasses!
5.0,"These shirts are amazing! I mostly use them to wear under my blazers for work, and they are super comfortable. I have slept in them and still great"

5.0,I love this wallet. It was just what I was looking for
5.0,Fit perfectly on my old gshock. It's like I have a new watch!
5.0,Bought these as dance shorts-cheer bloomers for my teenage daughter and she’s in love! Her thighs are very muscular so normally shorts roll up but these stay right in place. Mom buy for the win!
5.0,A must-have for people who wear silver jewelry.

5.0,These MOLLE Web Dominators work well.  They are identical to others that i have purchased except that the elastic is a bit larger in diameter.  These are fantastic for strap control on backpacks.  I highly recommend this product.

5.0,"These were a much better option than what I expected,  would buy again."
5.0,Had a lot of compliment! I love my acquisition
5.0,great for vacation and to pack in your purse.  Very cute and others wanted to know where to purchase.
5.0,"My daughter absolutely loves this locket. We sing her this song every night so it was the perfect gift. The only downfall is that it is extremely hard to open, I had to use tools to open it and told her not to close it all the way just to be safe."
5.0,"nice, got lots of compliments"
5.0,Very cute toy. Well received!
5.0,The best cheap watch you can buy in my humble opinion.
5.0,"These working caps are the best, comfort to my ears, no pain or numbness at the end of the shift."
5.0,Shorter thsn expected.
5.0,"My son is on the smaller side at 6 years old, I got him the 6-8 size and it's a tad lose, but still fits good. He will be able to keep it for a few years. Definitley a good buy!"
5.0,Sleeves were long enough. Basic long sleeve tee.
5.0,"Este vestido me encanta, cómodo, buena calidad, no se arruga, fresco, siempre me lo chulean, feliz con mi vestido!"
5.0,Fits great. Colors are Very soft..not bold as expected from the pictures.Very breathable material and is machine washable which is a plus. I will definitely place another order as a gift for a friend.
5.0,Dress firts cofortably. I love the pockets! Over all a good buy.
5.0,"I bought the 'flamingo pink' color and it is a straight up, true pink color. Bright and perfect for a sunny beach! I also wear a 36C and bought this in a medium per the size chart (I also double checked the size chart on the body glove website). It fits perfectly. The triangles dont cover up my full boob, but it fits just like it does on the model. The fabric is somehow soft and cushy. More lux feeling than a target/old navy bathing suit fabric. I'm sure it will be comfortable to wear all day outside. I mostly bought this because I wanted a bikini top without a behind the neck halter tie. I was nervous about the shoulder straps being long enough, but they are fine. I'm considering buying another one, but I don't actually NEED another one....."
5.0,They will be a great gift....very nice
5.0,"Got this as a gift for a cat loving friend. She loves it, said it is very soft and I often see it mixed in with her outfits 2-4 times a week."
5.0,We gave this to each of our 3 girls for Christmas and I don’t believe they have taken them off since!
5.0,"Really great boots for a great price, they feel very comfortable and they look great. Very good quality! I always have problem with boots being too tight around my calf and those fit perfectly."
5.0,"They are not bad. Comfortable, tad bit smaller than expected, but will stretch to fit"
5.0,I bought these glasses to use as my computer glasses. Nice clear lenses with good magnification. My eyes are not tiring when I am on my computer for a long time. Good price! Good deal!
5.0,"So nice quality, color and material!"
5.0,Beautiful watch and holds time well.
5.0,Excelente material calidad y servicio
5.0,Was looking for this item for a while to repair an old Invicta watch. The product worked exactly as I tended
5.0,"I bought this for my niece for her 16th birthday and she loved it!! The quality was very good, it didn't smell like glue like some cheaper items. The size and shape were perfect. I bought the white and it was fluffy and fun. Now all the girls in the family want one."
5.0,Glass case is very sturdy and material is very thick. Cat pattern is very cute
5.0,"I love this shirt. After I received the first one, I purchased the rest of the colors. It fits a little bigger than expected, and is somewhat baggy, which was a pleasant surprise as that’s what I prefer. It’s also extremely soft material, and perfect for the gym, or lounging around. For reference, I am 6’ 220 pounds, approx. 12% body fat, and I bought an XL. If you like looser fit, purchase the size you normally do; if you like a little tighter fit, purchase a size down. I really hope they come out with more colors!"
5.0,"What a bargain! I love these wrist bands so much. They are slimmer than the Fitbit wristbands, very comfortable, and the designs are so pretty. I decided to order more after receiving the first two I purchased!"
5.0,Cute hat! Great quality a little smaller then expected but still fit. Junior sizing
5.0,The ring was true to the pictures and quality referenced on-line.  It was delivered as promised and was a great gift that brought a wonderful smile!
5.0,Nice shirt washes well
5.0,"Bought for my son who loves Orange. I was nervous buying shoes from Amazon but not like I can take him in a store to try on!  Shoes for well, were light. And so far holding up well to a 6 yrold"
5.0,Fits great and doesn't look cheap. I will order again in a different color.
5.0,I was in need of a slimline wallet to hold all of my cards. This is perfect. It also holds my iPhone XS in its case. Love to.
5.0,"These are the most beautiful socks, love them.  They fit so well and will enjoy wearing them."
5.0,"After returning the first pair (12s) I reordered a 13 and they fit great.  Don't be deceived by the size chart saying 12s are a Euro size 47.5.  They are a 46.  The 13s are a 47 and fit great.<br /><br />These are a good quality boot.  Very soft inside and with some wear and polish the exterior looks and feels terrific. I have a high arch so these boot could use a bit more support.  However, I can fix that with an arch support insert if needed.  Now that I have the right size I am a happy customer."
5.0,I was actually expecting a cheap material but I was wrong. It’a beautiful and the dress is well done. The size is perfect. I am 129-131 lbs. and my size is Medium. It fits me perfectly. It’s simple yet seductive due to the back is open. I used sticky bra for this dress to avoid straps in the back.
5.0,These fit as expected and look nice. I bought them for going out shopping and doing errands in bad weather and so far they have kept my feet warm and dry and are not slippery on wet surfaces.
5.0,Granddaughter loves her jammies
5.0,I love this shoes.... I have been using this brand since I was in college and now I am buying this to my little niece! I recommend it 100%
5.0,They’re so COMFORTABLE!  👍🏾👍🏾
5.0,"Really comfy & very cute. Nice length, just covers my knees & I'm 5'6. Flattering neck line. The only concern was the white material is a bit see-through. I felt like I could see my nipples through it even with a bra, so ended up having to wear bra petals with a bra. The material, overall, is a nice weight."
5.0,"Comfortable and adjustable, which my ski instructor showed me. Very happy with my purchase!"
5.0,"I've been using this band for a while, and I initially intented to change it out with others but I don't want to. I love this one"
5.0,This great. Fits my large planner. Room for important things I need to have handy. Beautiful like a purse. You could use it for a purse!!!
5.0,BEAUTIFUL Dress!!! Will need to steam the creases out of the skirt once it is delivered but it's a great quality especially for the price. Can't wait to wear it!
5.0,"This product was as shown and described. The small bonus item was missing from my order but once i notified Amazon, it was replaced quickly"
5.0,Very cute.  Looks exactly like the photo.  My neice will love it.
5.0,"I was really unsure about this jacket for awhile, but the more I wear it, the more I like it. I washed it on a cold, delicate cycle and let it air dry. This seemed to give it a softer, “less packaged” look if that makes sense. I’m 5’8” and 115 lbs, so normally I wear a small, but for a coat I like to size up. The medium fits great. It also is long enough in the arm and torso area to accommodate a taller woman."
5.0,"Simply put: If you have leather and no mink oil, you're wrong.<br /><br />Of course, you may have leather products without the use of mink oil, but that ownership would be like having a piece of bread before the invention of peanut butter - tragic times.<br /><br />I don't know the differences between the available brands off the top of my head, but the Redwing name is revered among my Alaskan people. They make the kind of products you dont want to wear outside because they're sexy, and then you do and they get sexier, and then you oil them up to a peak of sexiness, and then you leap off that peak into your jeep, and the Angel's sing Hallelujah.<br /><br />Yeah, Redwing products are a nobrainer."
5.0,"Fantastic watch,very reasonable price.Was very pleased with everything about it.Very comfortable to wear,and looks like a jeweled bracelet.May buy another for my other wrist."
5.0,The length is not at mid-calf I can either wear heels or flats with it & it looks elegant!
5.0,These worked great for my art project!
5.0,"Absolutely PERFECT!!! The ""peach"" color is vibrant and reminiscent of spring. The material is heavy weight and it actually keeps you warm on a chilly day/evening. I am a size 12 so I purchased a large. It fits perfectly."
5.0,Kids loved it !!
5.0,"Received what I ordered, size was perfect for someone with a large melon, LOL  thanks for a great product!!"
5.0,"Got these about two months ago, liked them so much I bought another pack to replace all my older underwear.<br /><br />I like boxer briefs because they hold everything together, and are not briefs which look funny to me. These are very comfortable. The elastic band is comfortable and doesn't dig into my skin like others do. These fit exactly as I would have expected based on the size chart.<br /><br />I like that they are not too long that they look like shorts, and I can wear them under running shorts without them showing. They do not have a flap on the front like most underwear but I don't mind as I've never used that. It is also kind of funny but they do have padding on the front which does make them more comfortable around the groin, and also makes it all look bigger, so I guess that's a bonus as well."
5.0,Beautiful! Works as necklace or bracelet. Great quality and great price!
5.0,I like this dress. It’s flattering.
5.0,Came in fast! And super cute! I’ve always wanted a pair!

5.0,I really love these socks. They come all the way right below his knees and it is super soft. Some are ticker than others and I am fine with that. The design and quality are really good too.

5.0,After purchasing these I'm a total HoFish Fan!  They fit beautifully.  The soft cotton pouch shows off my package so well it drives my fiance crazy.  He loves how well they highlight my buttocks.  Even after several washes they lift everything to drive your man insane when he looks at you yet never rides up the crack after a long day.  They hold up so well I never show a plumbers crack even if my pants my slip down a little during a  hard day's work.  So if you want to please your man and feel sexy with or without pants on then I recommend these for you too.
5.0,Absolutely love this sweater. The fuzzy fleece inside is so comfy!!! The sleeves were a little tight for me and I am a bit bustier so a little snug there too but I love this sweater and definitely recommend.

5.0,"Soft and comfortable; fits me just right.<br />Im 6'2"" 200lbs. Good for summer & winter.<br />Ordered 3; green, white & blue. Happy camper.0 AND<br />AAB"
5.0,"I ordered the small size for my 7 year old niece and it worked out great. It's a tad big on her but it has that cute oversized look. I am happy Bc I know it will fit her next year too. She loves the colorful, trippy design. The price is right on these hoodies and the design looks sharp so I would def purchase again."
5.0,"I bought this dress for a family vacation. It did look a tad more darker than I thought it would be but it fit perfectly. I am typically a size 14 in dresses but am pear shaped so I was worried if the dress would fit. However, it fit wonderfully through the hips and thighs. I am planning on ordering more in different colors."
5.0,Very expensive! But made grandson happy!! Fit good!!
5.0,"Because I am not a young one anymore, I am wearing this dress with leggings. I absolutely love it. It is dressy enough for special occasions and I can wear it for simpler times. Just very nice!"

5.0,Beautifully colored fabric and my daughter loves it!
5.0,"Navy one piece is always ""just right"" -- flattering, comfortable and works well for laps in the pool."
5.0,"The sparkle in these earrings cannot be captured with my iPhone, but it's like the stars came down and landed on my ears! They are absolutely stunning! I cannot wait to wear them to our Christmas Party next month! The size is perfect, not too big or too small. The clasp takes a bit to close, so I feel that they will not flip out easily like some hoops can do. The stones are set into the metal, and they seem secure. I am so impressed!<br /><br />I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,"I wanted some red earrings and figured that for the price these would be marginal in quality.  I was wrong.  They are stunning,  and could easily be mistaken for real rubies."
5.0,great fun piece to wear
5.0,Gave these to my wife as christmas gift and she and my daughter loved they way looked. Would recommend as gift to someone who loves earrings.
5.0,This shirt is just like those expensive 511 shirts.  Very nice and functional.
5.0,Wife really did like these and I liked the price
5.0,After reading the reviews I went a size up and I am glad I did! These tanks are super light weight and comfortable. They are not long like other tanks which is good because I am super short. They are not compression which is great too. I am excited to use one for my Spartan Race this weekend. I am 5'0 at 121 lb and a medium fit perfect.
5.0,"Absolutely gorgeous ring. Great Zales ""Elsa"" dupe, Seems to be pretty sturdy with daily wear so far. My Item had become lost and the seller was extremely helpful and had my ring found and on its way in no time. Will purchase more from this company for sure!"
5.0,"loved these so much.  great quality, fabric didn't fall off like others."
5.0,A tad bit small and tight for my average size 11 year old. It was a very pretty forest green. I would size up if you’re child is not teeny tiny for their age
5.0,Lots of compliments. Still testing how sturdy it is.
5.0,I love how easy it makes to slip in and out of my sneakers. It’s so comfy and looks great on my adidas. I wish I had known about these years and years ago!!! I do wish that they make more colors....
5.0,Simple its perfect.
5.0,My secret Santa recipient loved this pair of earrings!
5.0,"Great necklace! I got it for my husband and love is it. He likes his necklaces long, and this one more than long enough. Any ufc fan would love this, and it is high quality."

5.0,Awesome quality.  I only wish they had more characters.  Love these shirts.

5.0,This was a gift for the eye doctor! Very sweet tie. Well made worth the price!
5.0,Perfect and just like picture
5.0,This makes mask wearing a little fun to have a message on it.
5.0,GRANDAUGHTERS LOVE THEM.
5.0,My absolute favorites
5.0,"I am size 8, this tankini fits perfectly, cannot wait to wear for our family trip to a water park in summer."
5.0,Fit my nephew perfect. Cute lil slippers and very durable. He loves them.
5.0,"If you want compression order your normal size to wear casually order up 1 size. I am 6'4"" inches tall and 210 lbs. And I got the large. Great compression and value for the price."
5.0,Beautiful Floral Heart.
5.0,Very good quality product. I ordered medium and the fit was perfect.
5.0,"It says 90% micro modal, and 10% spandex. I don't know what micro modal means, but whatever it is, it feels very comfortable. It's sorta silky. They also retain their form better than cotton underwear by hanes, fruit of the loom, etc. Will never go back to cotton. 5-Stars!"
5.0,But a quarter of the price.
5.0,Love them! I love the designs & details.
5.0,"Leggings are not see through, which is a must. I got a lot of compliments in the v waist. I sewed the open spaces on the bra front closed because it didn't lool good when I moved around. I also took the waist in a little."
5.0,"You can't go wrong for the price and the color selection is out of this world. Every single color I want, they have right here (Ilike my workout clothes to match).<br /><br />I don't use these for my OTF studio workouts. Due to having more of a lightweight feel, I use these for yoga, lounging around and running errands. They haven't bled when washed nor have I experienced any piling whatsoever. I am pleased with my purchase and want to buy 5 more colors!"
5.0,"First, the fit... I'm 5'7&#34; 150 lbs and ordered a medium. It fits just like i would hope... Just a tad big at first, so some room for it to shrink a little in the wash and fit perfectly.  Also fyi, i don't like a t-shirt to be form-fitting to me. I like the shoulder points to be on the tips of my shoulders (and this one is close so as i said, a little room to shrink), and don't like a shirt to be crazy long, but otherwise, i just like a nice comfortable fit. If you like a shirt to be tight, well, adjust accordingly.<br /><br />Next, the shirt itself seems real nice.  I won't say it's the heaviest there is - no idea actually, but i don't spend a fortune on Tee's either.  I just think it's good quality material, and a well made shirt.  It seems to hold a nice &#34;form&#34; to it and i like that.  I can't speak to wear-and-tear as i just got it, but i'm real pleased so far and would definitely buy from the same maker again.<br /><br />Finally, as for the logo, i like it.  It's funny but i'm taking my adult son to a Boston Celtics game (his favorite team) and i'm not really a basketball fan, so i told him i'd show some fan pride in my own way... So yes, i bought a &#34;Celtic&#34; shirt - just not quite the same celtics. And even though i'm having some fun with him over it, have to admit, i never expected to like it so much."
5.0,Looks great in your hair in many styles.
5.0,"Beautiful, just what I wanted."
5.0,I love the print but it fits weird
5.0,Love these.  Fit just as described and works great for ballet flats or other low shoes.
5.0,This cape is a great addition to my winter wardrobe.  It is comfortable and is great to wear with short sleeve dresses when I don't feel like bothering with a coat.
5.0,Made incredibly well. Very good fit. Very stylish. Great value.
5.0,"This is a must have for the Contour Roam camera for hands free use. It is made of comfortable elastic and adjust for multiple sizes. The camera can be position on either side of your head and is pretty stationary. I used this during my trip to Hawaii for bike riding, running, and even swimming. I would definitely recommend this to everyone."
5.0,Most comfortable pjzzzz. Bought them for a planned hospitalization. They were baggy and very comfortable. Washed great and did not shrink.
5.0,"I'm a 40B, 225lb, 5ft9in femme with few curves and this corset isn't just high quality in the construction but it is really flattering. The pattern is printed on the fabric, not actual brocade, but that didn't bother me at all.  There's no boning so it's really comfortable. If you're on the fence, get it. I'm so glad I did."
5.0,Vibrant colors. Nicely made. Good coverage.
5.0,I use it when I am doing IPL hair removal at home and it is really good!
5.0,Great jacket and it was a great price I love it
5.0,Love the look and keeps head and ears warm.
5.0,My daughter Ioves these and looks adorable! Runs a little big but that just means she can wear them longer
5.0,Amazing. I'm not a gal that likes regular. This was just perfect accessory for my fitbit flex 2
5.0,Cute. Really delicate though
5.0,Robe
5.0,"Wore these to a wedding and it was so beautiful. I bought a necklace and bracelet, and this ended up matching them to the TEE... it was so perfect! Almost like they were a set, I couldn't believe it. Good quality product too."
5.0,Oh my God!!!These shoes a definition of perfection.I love them so much😍😍❤️.Fits perfectly too.
5.0,I ordered a size 8 and it fits me perfectly. No one would know that you picked this ring for such a great price because it looks like any ring you would get from a jewelry store. It's not a thin piece of junk. It is quality made and is actually heavier than I expected. Comes in a nice gift box.<br /><br />I received this item in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.
5.0,"The color is awesome, held up time and time again. A great buy for the money!"
5.0,This was a Christmas gift that I bought for my 4 year old granddaughter to give her Mom for Christmas. Her Mom really love this gift. Keychain was package nicely in a little pouch and arrived in a timely manner. Great product for any occasion.
5.0,I love these so much good quality and detail!!! Highly recommend!!
5.0,"Just enough sparkle to jazz up a casual outfit. Love the magnetic closing,easy. Sparkling patriotic."
5.0,"I’m highly allergic to metals. I’ve tried 14 karat gold, silver, nickel free, etc. and my ears would start bleeding within 15 mins wearing any metal earrings.<br />These earrings are not metal and are perfect for people with metal allergies!!!! Highly recommend!!!! Plus the designs are so cute!!! I get excited each day because I pick a new pair to wear lol"
5.0,Wow great polish
5.0,"Love this! Fits an hourglass figure perfectly. There are pockets, so know that before yuh purchase, because pockets on a dresss stick out a little. Go one size up to fit well with the pockets.<br /><br />Very stretchy material with a polyester feel."
5.0,My niece loved the hat
5.0,"A bit fragile but quite long lasting, very very pretty :)gorgeous for the.price."
5.0,"these shoes are great! i am a blues musician and love to wear &#34;retro&#34; style clothing on (and sometimes off) stage. i have many pairs of two tone shoes, and these are a welcome addition to my wardrobe. they fit perfect, they feel good, and most of all......they LOOK good."
5.0,They are great will fit any size as there is a draw cord to tighten as needed. Washes up well!
5.0,Beautiful!  These are exactly as portrayed.
5.0,"I ordered an xl and it fits great. I am tall and the length is perfect for me as well. It has plenty of room. I love the color as well. I will buy other colors since I love this fit. One thing I notice, the sleeves...I have large upper arms and the sleeves are a bit snug. Overall, this set is so soft, made well, has plenty of room for me, good quality material and a good price."
5.0,Super trendy and cute. Definitely durable.
5.0,very nice and the price was great
5.0,"This gambeson is a great buy. It fits well and looks great (I'm 6 feet tall and 180 pounds). I'm looking forward to bringing it to the renaissance fair next season. I bought the brown one, but I may buy the black one too since the product is so excellent and the price is good."
5.0,I ordered the small size and it was larger than I expected. It's really cute and I like that it comes with a shoulder strap and a wrist strap. The price was excellent and I'm very pleased with my purchase.
5.0,"I purchased a 3x and I'm very pleased with the fit and feel.  I'm 5'2, size 18, short torso, and have scoliosis which makes fitting clothes a bit challenging.  I'm a very active person, working out 2x a day and doing hikes on the weekend; I need a strong sports bra. While this is a very nice bra, looks good, feels great, fits well in the band/chest area, nice formed cups, I'm not sure this is my workout bra. But I'll give it a try. If anything, it'll be my work-from-home bra.  For me, I need something a bit more sturdy. Yet, this is a 5-star bra by all other standards. I bought in pink and green."
5.0,"I bought myself this watch because I have always been a fan of ""silver"" and of ""butterflies.""  I was concerned that it might too big because my wrists are fairly small.  I love it.  I showed my daughter and she loved it also, so I bought her one for Valentine's Day.  Another friend noticed my watch and immediately went online and bought one for herself.  In my opinion, it has ""just enough BLING"", isn't too gaudy and it fits wonderfully!"
5.0,"This is a really nice handbag, it is well made and a nice size. I have my full size wallet, glass case, brush, cell phone, chapstick and mints all in this cute little bag. I have used this both crossbody style and over the shoulder when wearing a coat and it sits comfortably either way."
5.0,I love these socks. They keep my feet warm without being too thick. The colors are very subdued and go with more things than I originally expected.
5.0,"The material is silky- like. Wasn’t expecting that, but still super cute."
5.0,"Great product second order, will order again"
5.0,Good fit and light weight! Love them
5.0,"I’ve ordered these twice during Covid. Most likely will order a 3 rd time. Sturdy, great, well made,  the wire across the nose keeps its shape even after countless washes, I always hang dry  & comfortable. Just a really good pair of masks!"
5.0,"Wow..great tights,amazing price for a nice stretchy cotton."
5.0,I have ordered one for my phone and one for my purse. I love them!! I am amazed at how beautiful these are. Photos don't really do them justice. I will probably order more and gift to friends. They would also make great stocking stuffers!
5.0,This bracelet is beautiful and very classy looking. I love it.
5.0,Bought it for my lady. She looks great in it.
5.0,"This is one of my favorite sports bras. Great support, really moves with you and looks good too! I'll be buying another!"
5.0,Beautiful! Already had compliments on them!

5.0,Great works great
5.0,"This dress fit like a glove. Hid my pouch perfectly. I’m 5’1. 145, 36DD. I got a medium. Love it."
5.0,"My daughter is a flower girl in a wedding this August. Dress is beautiful!!! I ordered it in a size larger than her measurements, other reviews said it ran small. Glad I did, size 8 fit perfectly, but not a lot of room to spare. She didn't want to try it on (bit of a tomboy), but when she finally did, she just wanted to spin and twirl. Can't beat the price and got it in 2 days. A necklace and a card were also with the dress as a thank you from the company. Would definitely order from this company again!"
5.0,"This watch is fantastic. Simple, intuitive and to the point. No extra BS.<br /><br />At this price point, I could care less if I beat it to sh*t.  Ordering another will not be a problem."
5.0,Pretty top. Fit is perfect.  Price is great.
5.0,"It fit and looked great but I would go up a size , the arms and bust were a little tight"
5.0,i like it and i will order more next time
5.0,It is the perfect size for my work bag I have a computer and folders that I have to carry around and various  notebooks —  it is sturdy and pretty very nice combination
5.0,Warm as I expected
5.0,"I got this lanyard to hold my car keys and some other little keys and gadgets I had. It's really cute and it holds my stuff pretty good. It seems sturdy and doesn't feel like it will break anytime soon. It is fashionable and really fits any outfit you're wearing, which is a plus, and something I was looking for. Anyway, I would recommend this to anyone considering it. :)"
5.0,So comfy and so stretchy. A cute pink too.
5.0,Put it in my boots this morning and they already feel better<br />Ken
5.0,It seems a tiny bit big for a 38mm but overall I really like it. I didn’t find it hard to remove links. The tool they send worked perfectly. Just make sure you check the arrows and push it out toward the arrows.
5.0,This stringer was made of good quality material and fit as expected. Would definitely buy from this seller again.
5.0,"Light weight, leg portion accommodates my 31.5-32” inch inseam. Feels Slightly too big for me on top but not enough to for a negative rating. Purchased size small. I’m 34A bust, 26.5 to 27” waist, 35.5” Hips. It’s linen so it does crease easy but not as bad as some other linens I've owned. It’s just appropriate. Im happy"
5.0,The magnetic closure is great. I like this bracelet.
5.0,Very beautiful and happy with the pyrchase
5.0,I have ridiculously small wrists.<br />Once I figured out where to remove the links to make it fit it was the perfect fit!<br /><br />The tool that came with it was super easy to use and the vendor even provided me an instructional video on how to remove the excess links.<br /><br />I’m very happy with the color and it’s very lightweight! Will definitely purchase additional colors
5.0,Excellent product!!!! Love these tanks
5.0,The shoe pocket design is amaze. Keep em high and tight
5.0,Love these socks very comfortable.

5.0,Nice Dress for the price...Lovely Fit......
5.0,Cute! As advertised.
5.0,"Great tie, and of a much better quality than ties 10x the price found in men's clothing stores!"
5.0,I have this apple shape which drives me nuts. Well this worked under my dress for my daughter's wedding. Perfect
5.0,This is such a pretty ballerina outfit...The tulle is scratchy so not to crazy about that.... Well made and very pretty!
5.0,My son loves his and he only 5 years old love to cook
5.0,Beautiful top. Excited to give this to my daughter.
5.0,Nice fabric and fits well
5.0,Favorite bag ever!!!!!
5.0,I had a lot of compliments. 4 of my co workers ordered at Amazon after seeing me wear this mini backpack. Color is like light lavander. Very classy.
5.0,"Love how light weight it is, keeps you cool while being covered up"
5.0,Loved working with this seller! Love my order!!
5.0,"I love it. I got it for my girlfriend, we are both into the steampunk scene and this mechanical owl pendant was an awesome gift for her. Much larger than I thought it would be, usually things are so small when you buy off of Amazon but not this. It's perfect."
5.0,"Picked these up for my teen daughter. She runs track and it gets chilly out there in the fall! These offer good coverage, even when bending and stretching and the high waist keeps her backside covered. The royal blue color is perfect for her school colors and looks great on her! The sheer mesh on the pockets adds a bit of visual interest and the pockets are big enough to accommodate her large iPhone. These washed up nicely, I did a cool water wash and hung them to dry. There was no shrinkage, color fading or pilling and all the seams and threads held tight. Overall, I was just thrilled to find a legging offered in her school colors! It was a bonus to us that they are super cute and fit so nicely!"
5.0,"My son has an itty bitty bottom so finding swim trunks that fit has always been a challenge. Because we were in my mom’s pool and not a public pool he went sans swim diaper. He’s five and potty trained but in public I’m afraid he will be too busy having fun to listen to his body.<br /><br />Without a swim diaper these did show a little plumber’s crack, but they didn’t fall down. It was easily rectified by tightening them as he got out of the water over and over.<br /><br />The rash guard is a rash guard. He didn’t wear it in the pool because it bunched with the puddle jumper.<br /><br />The hat wouldn’t have fit him when he was a newborn, much less at five. I don’t know why it was included frankly unless it was to make it a cute little set. Mission successful."
5.0,They may have fit him perfect but he hated them!
5.0,Very comfortable. Doesn’t get hot on my arm and it’s makes the watch face lower profile.
5.0,Great clown costume. You do not have to be a scary clown to use this one.
5.0,This watch is very elegant and beautiful. It goes with anything you wear and it fits quite nicely. I would definitely recommend this watch to any individual who is searching for an affordable timepiece that is somewhat expensive looking. The timing is actually accurate and the watch is easy to set. It arrived on time without any damage whatsoever. All in all this is a lovely timepiece.
5.0,"Very comfortable legging. Light material but not see-through. Love the pocket on the side. As the other reviewers mentioned, it runs slightly larger. I am usually S and occasionally XS and this is loose on me. I highly recommend going one size smaller for a better fit. Overall, nice material and great for the price."
5.0,"This dress fit BEAUTIFULLY! It was well made, comfortable and a show stopper! I will order more!"
5.0,I really like them so far. I just got them yesterday so can’t wait to sport them this week with my outfits!!!
5.0,Fits comfortable.  Lovely bracelet.
5.0,This was a perfect fit for what we needed. My son loves blue and loves his new scripture case.
5.0,great quality and fits like a glove. I will wear this often
5.0,Absolutely love it and it came early!!!
5.0,Protection for my ultra -sensitive skin to avoid mask-acne.
5.0,I purchased this for my 80-year-old mother for Christmas. She loves it! Very comfortable and a nice red color. Fits her perfectly and comes down far enough to her liking. I ordered her a large.
5.0,fits  very comfortable
5.0,It’s a great watch
5.0,"I'm 5'10"", 160 lbs 38D bust line and a large was the perfect fit.  Ordered the deep coral, loved it so much I ordered the emerald green."
5.0,Such a pretty necklace. It doesn’t tarnish and looks super delicate. Love it!!
5.0,"I was very pleasantly surprised that not only did these fit well, they also were not see through.  They are well constructed and the detailing makes takes these a step above plain yoga pants  or leggings.  If these xome in more colors, I will definitely be ordering more!  Well done,"
5.0,I loved the coat in general...but it was way too big. Had to return it. Return was super easy and I am satisfied. Will get a different size.
5.0,"I bought this dress for a bachelorette party and it did the job perfectly! It looked so great while being very comfortable. Fit as expected, and wasn’t super short which is uncommon for me. I got a medium and I’m 5’8 165 pounds very athletic build"
5.0,I bought a pair of jeans this brand in a different style while in California and searched for more and came across these. I’m 5’8” and all legs. They are just long enough. I have curvy hips and smaller waist. These don’t gap! Quality is nice! (They don’t sit high above my hip but are high enough not to show my rump when squatting down or bending forward.)<br /> I loved them so much I had my best friend order a pair too and she loves hers. She’s shorter than me and curvy and they work for her too! We called them the “traveling pants” haha
5.0,These were the most comfortable compression socks I've ever worn!  The fabric was very soft and I almost forgot I had them on as they felt like regular socks.  Price was very reasonable compared to most stores.
5.0,Nice ties. No complaints!
5.0,Perfect! This item was just like it was described. It matched perfectly with my Coach backpack purse. I have no complaints.
5.0,The softest and most comfortable PJs ever!!
5.0,"Beware of reviews telling you to go bigger; you need to measure yourself or have someone do it and buy the size corresponding to that number, or an inch or two smaller if you are trying to waist train.  I went up a size because of the reviews, and it is actually too large.  By which I mean that it fits me now, but I can't really cinch it.  In order to cinch your waist even a little bit (the reason most people want corsets), you have to have a corset small enough to be tightened at the back. So if you measure yourself perfectly, you need to make a purchase that has the capacity for tightening an inch or so. The back has a flap under the drawstrings (against your skin) that is a couple inches long, so that your skin under the drawstrings isn't exposed if the edges of the corset don't touch, which is nice.  This is a great quality buy for the price. But size yourself intelligently!"
5.0,"Cute style, flattering, non itchy lace top.  Slightly difficult to iron with the pleating on the skirt but I get compliments every time I wear it."
5.0,My mother loves it. It’s a beautiful watch
5.0,So cute on! It's hard to keep on the shoulders because the elastic is pretty thick but it may just be me.
5.0,Beautiful dress! Super special find! Who knew I could find a rehearsal dinner dress on Amazon!
5.0,"I LOVE this necklace!! It's so hard buying jewelry online...you just never know what you are really getting. The clasp is nice and snug, the locket doesn't feel cheap at all and neither does the chain, and it came with a nice assortment of lava rocks and felt balls to use for essential oils. I love the look and feel of this necklace! Arrived quickly, nicely packaged, amazingly affordable...all around an excellent buy."
5.0,Bought this as a gift for my husband. The embroidery is beautiful. I bought the realtree hat with the same embroidery for him after I bought this one. Nice fit. definatly recommend the purchase to others.
5.0,Love these!  Sister bought 2pair. Really sassy and so comfortable
5.0,"I purchased this bag for a trip to Cuba. I have broad shoulders and a muscular back, but the bag worked perfectly. It was very comfortable and lightweight to wear all day. It held water bottles, sunscreen, cash, and other necessities very easily. The front pocket was perfect for holding small items. I also liked the snap closure on the handles over the main zipper as this added a layer of security. The material was easy to keep clean and the flamingo pattern is super cute. There is also a hidden pocket on the back of the bag, perfect for passport or ID that you want to be extra secure.<br /><br />After Cuba, I also used this bag for Disneyworld. It was easy to maneuver around on rides and ride comfortably on my back for very long days."
5.0,So far so good! Super cute and convenient way to carry my keys. I added a card holder pocket so could keep my credit card on me too.
5.0,Perfect fit and flattering dress! I love it.
5.0,Looks great on the kids.
5.0,For size 5 it was too biggest
5.0,Very nice shirt. Vibrant colors and comfortable.
5.0,Very nice and fit perfectly. Love material.
5.0,Good quality perfect fit
5.0,"I love these: tagless, long length for layering, comfortable fit, nice fabric. 5’3”,130 pounds and the Medium fits great. Bought more colors because I wear these all the time."
5.0,"I used this on a really sunny day to weed whack my yard.  It felt so nice not having to wear sunglasses, and it also prevented things from flying into my face."
5.0,"This is a typical party or costume wig but in my opinion, it was softer and sturdier than most other costume wigs. The horn's a little loose but that can be easily fixed if it bothers you. Does not shed much. A good purchase overall."
5.0,"Quality knitwear, nice smooth and thin texture, great!"
5.0,My niece really loved this watch. She thought it was beautiful and trendy.
5.0,I got an xl.  That’s what I normally wear - I’m a size 16.  They’re really big on me - even after washing.
5.0,"I got these to keep the dust out of my grandson son's eyes, mouth and nose when they where 4 wheeling. They work great."
5.0,"I’ve worn this less than 10 times, I wash it on delicate and I hang dry it. I take care of my clothing and this is pure junk. I would never buy this again but I’m thankful because I was about to buy it in black. That’s not happening."
5.0,"This was just what I was looking for for my tall, large tummy husband. No short tie or one that sticks out from the back because of him trying to adjust the length. He looks very put together."
5.0,Wears great!
5.0,Well made great product will be ordering more
5.0,"Glasses are great, delivery....awful"
5.0,"Very unique, bought for my son for Xmas. Fits me as well as him and is very well-made."
5.0,Great size. Well made :-)
5.0,"They’re a little tight but they feel great.  I’m not overly fond with the inside of them, but it hasn’t been a problem.  They do help with the swelling and they’re cute!"
5.0,I would like to start with I was amazed on the timing of the delivery.  It should me that would receive between May 31 - June 8th.  Which I was on pins and needles since I needed to wear the dress for my daughter graduation party June 10th.  I arrived yesterday May 22nd; I couldn't believe it I was so excited.  Once I got the dress home I tried it on; I'm normally a Large with DD breast and I'm only 4&#34;11&#34;.  I ordered a XXL because I knew it would still look great on me; and I was correct.  Perfect size glad I went with the largest size you can order; if I went an XL it would have been tight in the breast area.  Love Love the dress but I will like others have mentioned; purchase me a Black under slip to go underneath that hangs to my knees.  The slip is too short and tight fitting that shows all your flaws underneath :( also the nude color slip takes away from the dress.  The Black looks really great underneath in my opinion.  I'm going to wear Red shoes to really make the dress POP.  Its worth the purchase and it's Unique. Can't wait to wear it and receive all the compliments I know I will get.  It hangs long on me and go all the way down to my ankles :)  Makes it feel like a Prom dress.
5.0,Great shirt for the fallout lover in your life and a decent price. The material is very soft and breathable according to the person I gifted it too.
5.0,Good product but I feel it's a bit crowded i recommend
5.0,Do like the firmness It does hold my breast.
5.0,really  a very pretty set of earrings.  i was disappointed in the size.  expected them to be a little bit bigger.
5.0,Excellent quality. Item exactly as described.  Item arrived on time and I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.
5.0,"Love these pants!!  They're almost 100% cotton so they stretch very comfortably and are perfect for yoga or other sports requiring lots of flexibility.  They are very high quality.  They are slightly shorter than I'd expected and also slightly smaller than I'd expected, but still fit just fine."
5.0,"Watched a Tik Tok ( I know I'm a grown man) about someone wearing compression shirts to hide the extra mush and decided to try one.<br /><br />Fits great, comes with 3 tank tops and they look great"
5.0,Love the look and it's an attention getter
5.0,"Love these! They’re super soft, and they just look amazing! I use them for my business at craftsbykylie.com"
5.0,It fit good and comfortable
5.0,Fit perfectly and the color I got (slate blue) looked like it was pictured. A worthy replacement.
5.0,"Wear it all the time great quality, water doesn't damage it, it doesn't scratch, its perfect."
5.0,Super cute and perfect for summer
5.0,"I LOVE this skirt! It feels as soft as a well-worn pair of pajamas. I can put it on in the morning and forget about it. I live (and work) in a tropical environment, and anything that feels heavy on my body gets ripped off the minute I walk into my door. I can be cool in this all day. I wish all of my skirts were this soft. I know some reviews have said the fabric is too thin. I ordered a turquoise & blue multi-color, and I don’t find it see-through at all. After I got it, I went online and ordered a half-dozen more in different colors. I just made sure the fabric said 95% rayon/5% spandex. I noticed that not all “color” choices were made of the same fabric."
5.0,Looking for a burgundy/maroon shirt to match a madras plaid shorts.  This was an excellent match.  Fits very well.
5.0,They launder well and come in very handy.
5.0,Daughter lives this shirt.  Super cute
5.0,Great product good quality long keeps the rain out
5.0,"Nice quality belt.  Great gift for a newly promoted ""key holder""!"
5.0,My second purchase from this company.  Good quality.  Speedy delivery.
5.0,Nice quality and great price
5.0,"Perfect to wear with leggings, not too long or too short. Really nice stretchy fabric that's flattering for any figure. Just wash with cold water and hang dry so it doesn't shrink or lose it's stretchiness.  If you're debating between what size, go with the smaller size."
5.0,"Bought these as gifts (they also have gloves in black with white tips) for my cousins and they loved them. Very easy to use, 1 click to turn on all the lights and very simple to choose your own colors and patterns."
5.0,The fit was perfect for my Pebble watch and love the swirling design.
5.0,"Gets the meaning across, wish they were bigger!"
5.0,"Unfortunately I ordered the wrong size, but the shoes looks well made with good solid rubber with a soft insole."
5.0,"Great purchase, worth money spent and best quality."
5.0,Have purchased Calvin Klein before at a much higher price. Love that they come in a variety pack of 3 different styles. I bought them in white as well for my daughters.
5.0,I was so pleased with this.It works just like they said it would. thanks////// I/m just leaning about diffrant stones. so well be ordring somthing more like this....
5.0,"I ordered this to see if I would like the look of my lip pierced before going out and doing it. Doesn't look bad, exactly what I needed to see how it would look. Easy to get on lips but I had a more difficult time with my nose."
5.0,This item turned out so beautifully!  Thank you so much for doing such a great job.
5.0,Honestly super surprised with all of these pins. They are great.
5.0,"Liked the product, quick shipping"
5.0,"Good design, material, price."
5.0,I just love this pendant and it came with a free chain.  The created emerald is a lovely color and the little diamonds on top finish it off nicely.  The pendant is a nice size.  Noticable without being too big.
5.0,So very pretty and such a reasonable price.
5.0,"The best thing about Stylin' Tape is that there are 3 precut widths per pack. Only one side of the adhesive is exposed so you can place it on your clothes without having it fold over and stick on itself like other versions out there do. The 3 widths are great for a variety of purposes- spaghetti straps, strapless, halter, ripped seams, gaping necklines when you bend over, buttons that popped off. This tape holds well. Have never ruined clothes by using this, or had any sensitivity."
5.0,Perfect fit great color
5.0,fast and easy. thanks
5.0,Soft & warm!  Fits a bit loose just how I like it!
5.0,Great Quality but size up
5.0,This is a great quality shirt.  Fits good. The color is as seen.
5.0,I love these! They are super cute and great quality especially for the price.
5.0,These bunny ears are awesome.  They have wire inside so the ears can conform however you want them to be.  Love that!
5.0,I got it for my baby niece's and it fits perfect.
5.0,"I wore it to work for an office job. Very flattering yet professional. Material is soft. Not see through (problem I tend to struggle with from clothes I order online since I have a bigger bust). For reference I am 5’4” and 120 lbs. High quality, would order from this seller again."
5.0,They’re perfect. Nice material. Good fit.
5.0,I wasn't expecting to like this watch as much as I do. Good quality and looks exactly like what I was looking for.
5.0,Love the fit and how it feels
5.0,"Gorgeous dress. I loved it!! I'm 5'2 got a size small. Fit Great<br />No bra inserts but can easily be added or worn without a bra. The dress was too long even with heels, but it was an easy fix that I hemmed myself"
5.0,Perfect for a casual night out what you see is what you get
5.0,Holds my big sunglasses nicely.
5.0,"THIS WAS A GIFT , AN SHE LOVED IT.  PURPLE STONES ARE HER FAVORITE."
5.0,This little jumper is adorable! Material is good quality and colors are bright.

5.0,Went great with her outfit
5.0,nice brasclet
5.0,Love the hat. Only negative made in China.  Wish it had made in USA on it. Hat is very high quality.
5.0,Golf ⛳
5.0,"I sit at a desk all day and often when I'm done my ankles are very swollen. These socks have turned out to be a great find. I'm not the smallest gal you'll ever meet and I've gotten plus size compression socks before but they were SO tight, and hard to put on, and they kind of hurt to wear. These socks are just the right amount of compression while still being very comfortable. I would have no problem wearing these all day, they are soft and warm and your toes get to be free. When I've worn them at work all day and remove them, my ankles are much less swollen. I think they are the perfect balance of tight and comfy."
5.0,"When you buy Carters, you know you're getting a great product. And we did. Washes up nice and keeps soft."
5.0,Nice!  Perfect anniversary gift for my husband.
5.0,"I like this chain, it works good with my pendants.  I like the shorter 14 inch length, and can wear more than one chain in longer lengths.  16 inch and 18 inch.  I don't know if they make it in 15 inch, if they did, I would like that too."
5.0,I just love my new anklets! They are 10' long and very cute.<br />I've had them on for a few days and  I'm happy with them.
5.0,Great for balance.  Even my non believer husband tried them and can feel a difference. Now the whole family wears them!
5.0,Beautiful bright colors.Can wear dressy or casual.  Fit perfectly and very comfortable.
5.0,"I am 5'-10"" tall and 160 lbs. I usually wear a large pr 32x32 men's U.S. size. Iordered the x-large based on review and description stating the sizes run small and it fits perfectly in my opinion. It's a straight fit and the fabric has a little stretch size so it's perfect for my use, which is kayaking and fishing."
5.0,It was adorable ☺️
5.0,"My granddaughter who loves horses and is an amateur photographer LOVED this camera strap.  At first, I thought it was a little pricey, but when I received it and saw the quality, I was happy with my purchase."
5.0,Perfect under layer for warmth.  Comfortable and pretty. I love it
5.0,"Took a few hours to put together. But so worth it.  Kids love it even a month after we got it going. (13 y old and 4 y old). Great price, safe, steady and  so much fun.<br />Thank you !"
5.0,"Perfect!! Bought when my daughter was 4-5 months old, she is now 7 months old and it still fits perfect. It’s absolutely adorable and keeps the sun off her face and shoulders."
5.0,Holds material away from face.  Makes it easier to breathe.
5.0,"At first I had no idea what I had ordered. I got this product at discounted rate in exchange for a review. Once I received them, my creativity went into full motion. This is a multifunction head & neck wrap can be worn at least 12 different ways. I used them as costume pieces. We have to dress up for the entire week of Halloween so I have planed to wear one as a headband, hairband, scarf and as a wristband. They are very stretchy and claim to be moisture absorbing. I have worn a couple of them already, but was only inside so I cannot comment on the moisture absorbing claim. I did use it for yoga class to keep the hair from my face. You know those little hair wisps that keep tickling your nose. Yea those! Works great keeping those out of your view! I have already washed two of them. They have held up very nicely. I did not put them in the dryer. Just hang to dry. My husband used one over his nose/mouth area when he was mowing the lawn. He said it helped greatly with his allergies. No dust or pollen bothered him this time. He was able to breath normally too. Did not obstruct his breath. We are very pleased with this product. A+"
5.0,It's SOOOO cute!!!! I had to order another it gets so much attention and its very different. I love wearing it in one of my upper ear cartilage piercings. It looks so cool and cute up there!
5.0,"Very soft, fluffy, and comfortable! I got this for my 2-year-old son, who wears 4-5t clothes. It's a little small for my 6 year old daughter who wears size 6-7. But it does have a good stretch to it. I do like that it has a button snap at the top to jeep it closed. I kind of wish it had those extra tie strings on the inside, but the button does the job.  It's not too thick but also not too thin, I do wish it had some other baby shark something on the actual robe itself and not just the hood. The only way you can tell is baby shark is when the hood is up. When the hood is down it just looks like a yellow robe, which some people may not love for a boy. But that's my only complaint. He doesn't have any complaints about it, and where's it all the time. He even wears it outside instead of a light jacket."
5.0,They were very sturdy and attractive shoelaces.
5.0,Great product for the price. Fits my head very nicely.
5.0,"Got so many compliments on these hats. Fit our newborn perfectly, and much cuter than the hospital hats."
5.0,bought these for an old boss - they're great
5.0,"I really like this! I just tried it on once, but it is a great length, and fits well!"
5.0,"Great looking, amazing price."
5.0,"Absolutely perfect and gorgeous! It came in perfect condition, and the pictures are clear. Just be careful with the posters; they’re delicate. I got a small part of it stuck to something else, and the image was ruined slightly. Thankfully, it was only a small part of the poster’s background! The white part blends in, anyway. Highly recommend this for any ARMY, it’s high quality for an unbelievable price."
5.0,I gave it as a gift to a retiring surgeon
5.0,This bag promotes 3-Days but how about you can literally pack a week or more worth of belongs for 2 people. I am a veteran - I carried backpacks! This one is Grade-A rugged! This is your all-purpose travel bag and while it is ideal for hiking and camping - this is the quintessential carry-on luggage for the quick get away - whether it is planes - trains - automobile or foot! This bag doesn't stop giving in compartments. It even has a padded and secure area for computers and/or tablets! My husband and I will share this bag for weekend trips. We also cruise a lot - it is great because it packs well so that you can unpack and use it while out on island ventures! Love this bag! *NOTE: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased feedback.
5.0,They are everything like the picture.  Lots of comments on them.  Very glade I bought them.
5.0,My daughter got such a kick out of the saying on the shirt.
5.0,"Beautiful swimsuit cover up,great quality similar to the one's you find in Dillard's or Target."
5.0,"I bought these when I was pregnant because I had a ton of traveling to do. They worked out really well, helped with my swelling later in the pregnancy and made my legs feel so much better when I went on walks, worked out and ran errands. I wore them a ton during my pregnancy. They offered a good amount of compression without being too difficult to get on. Also they were loose enough that they didn’t hurt my feet. I did notice that I needed to keep my toenails trimmed or it could be slightly uncomfortable, but other than that they were perfect. This was actually my second pair. I already owned the black."
5.0,"I dearly love this ring have worn it several times, and got lots of compliments on it, and it has not turned colors or leave a ring on my finger."
5.0,Yellow Box is my favorite brand of flip flops. I have about eight pair!  These are great for everyday wear. I love them!
5.0,"I really like the shirt, I ordered the XL which is just a tad bit big. It'll work but just a wear."
5.0,Super cute ! Goes great with my purse. Plenty of places to put things.
5.0,Adorable and perfect for the price!
5.0,"I love the color, the length, and fabric of the slip."
5.0,Wonderful scarf! Beautiful design!
5.0,I'm definitely a Vera Bradley fan and love this pattern so much I bought the wallet before I found this tote!  Love the quality and craftsmanship of Vera!  So hard to find too.
5.0,Takes some getting used to. At first I thought my eyeballs were getting sucked out but they don't let water leak into the eyepiece.<br />Went snorkeling and they came through like a champ.
5.0,Exactly as described.  Very pleased with purchase.
5.0,"Really nice dress. I Would buy again in different colors. it is not light weight, absolutely love"
5.0,Just right. Light weight
5.0,They work Great I would buy them again !
5.0,This umbrella has been very durable. It’s easy to fold up and carry. It’s a great size.
5.0,True to size. Good quality.
5.0,"The bracelets arrived quickly and the colors were true to the post. The kids loved the Fortnite images on them and the fact that they were ""glow-in-the-dark"". I like the fact that it contained 21."
5.0,Love the fit. Just be cognizant of you carry small children around. They might pop something out.
5.0,"Love this dress!! It is beautiful and made of quality material. I’m going to wear it in as a cocktail dress. I’m 5’5,160 and the medium fit perfectly."
5.0,"It's fun to have gloves that have a bit of sparkle and feminine styling, and still can stay on when you need to answer your phone. They fit even my huge hands, so if you have tiny hands, you'll have to see."
5.0,My spouse loved the hat. Great quality. Very nicely made. Loves the design. Great and comfortable fit. Would definitely buy again from this company.
5.0,Love everything about this shirt.  Especially since I'm a big fan of the ID Channel
5.0,Love the rompers
5.0,The replacement lenses fit perfectly and seemed to be of good quality and were polarized as promised.  They are not a thick and sturdy as the original Oakley lenses they replaced but are a great product since they are 1/10th the price of an actual Oakley lens replacement.
5.0,After one week of wear I am very happy with this belt. Fits well and looks good.
5.0,"I'm 5'9 and on the heavy side, with a body shape between a figure 8 and an hour glass. I bought an XL in black and white stripes.<br />I LOVE it!<br />The material doesn't feel super high quality, but it's a stretchy dress, so I think a higher quality fabric would have compromised the fit.<br />It's a bit long on me (and nothing is ever long on me) so I'll be wearing some peep toe wedges with it.<br />Honestly, if I tear it or something, I would be glad to buy another one. I've already recommended this dress to a friend."
5.0,Fits great and very comfortable. Very impressed based on the price!
5.0,"Love this fleece jacket.  My new favorite thing in life!  Ordered a small for a more fitted look (I’m 5’2”, 125 lbs).  For a more roomy fit, size up.  But I like the fitted look with this, so sticking with the small.  So comfy!"
5.0,These made the costume come together. I saw several of different colors at the event. I did not have a issue with them.
5.0,It’s perfect stud to wear in second hole above my hoops. Great when your looking for something attractive but understated. Good quality!
5.0,I love the color so much! And it’s so much softer than the regular bands.
5.0,Well built keychain. What you see is what you get get. Love the style and the hannya is very cool.
5.0,"I have a four month old whose a nice 13 pounds, and this fit her perfectly!  I wanted it for Easter photos, which turned out great!  The little puffy tail was pretty flat when it arrived, but I managed to fluff it up some for the photo.  I did have to cuff the hat up, but she wore this around the store as it was a cold day, and nearly everyone stopped me asking where I found the hat!  The little ears just flopped everywhere, and it was so cute!!!  One of the ears has a small pink ribbon around it, and there are crocheted ties in the front of the diaper cover, which I hid by tucking it into the front of the cover, and it really turned out well.  Great buy, but I will say that I'm not sure this would fit a newborn at all.  Like I said my child is four months old, and it fits to the T, but a bigger or smaller child will definitely have issues in wearing it."
5.0,Great shirts. I like em loose so i buy a size up. Feels great no scratch.
5.0,Perfect CUSTOM fit. Leather quality is superb - as is customer service. Don't hesitate; these pants are a FIND.
5.0,"Nice, it fits perfectly. Good quality and covers all the way the corners where the wheels are. Happy with the purchase."
5.0,"Bought it for friends sons birthday and he love it so did all the kids at the party. When it came I opened it to make sure nothing was damaged and my son walked in his eyes out up, I will be getting more just for him."
5.0,Looks great.  Have small wrists and this is perfect.
5.0,"Made from quality cotton, with an enforcement strip along the crotch buttons to keep from stretching.  Very happy with the shipping time and quality of these onesies, not too thin or misshapen in any way."
5.0,"This 2 piece ensemble was a surefire hit when my daughter wore it to the Homecoming Dance.  It fit perfectly. She is very petit (size 3) so I usually order her size xs, but this dress only came in sizes s, m, L. So, I ordered the small and it fit really nicely on her.  Great job."
5.0,I am working St Patrick's day from 5:30 AM to 8 PM. I still wanted to express the day in a tactful way. Thanx
5.0,Received quickly.  Awesome Keychain!

5.0,"Very well made,  beautiful warm fur lining, perfect for extreme cold."
5.0,These little moons are super cute!
5.0,"These are the warmest gloves I have ever had.  Recently we had a very wet, heavy snow.  The gloves get wet on the top layer, but nothing got through to my warm, dry hands.  They dry out quickly with no change to sizing or how they look."
5.0,Given as a gift<br />They were happy
5.0,Good value. Hat fits nicely. Love the distressed look.
5.0,Loved it so did my girlfriend
5.0,Good quality. I am happy with the order.
5.0,"I guess you have to be from a certain generation to really appreciate it or be a fan of 1960s/70s TV, but for me it's one of the funniest things ever!"
5.0,Very well made adorable
5.0,"Great size , holds a lot yet not bulky"
5.0,We gave them out at LGBT PRide and kids were thrilled!
5.0,Used the shoes for hiking in the forest and climbing.  Great traction and very comfortable.
5.0,"My brother hinted around for this hat, so I surprised him with it. He loves it and absolutely adores Bruno Mars!"
5.0,"I love these wonderful hankies!<br />Soft, absorbent, they do not shrink, no side krinkle, what else can I say!  An excellent purchase, considering how difficult it is to make these sort of purchases online.  Purchased both natural (yellowish) & white the quality is the same."
5.0,Loved the necklace picking up mad chicks with this thing
5.0,Great material!! Super comfy. You cant beat having comfy and cute!!! Love this shirt!!! I need every color.
5.0,Great quality masks
5.0,pretty as described
5.0,Stunning color and warm. Great on coats
5.0,"workes very well, a little hard to insert but once i got the hang of how to do it, was fine"
5.0,Stylish. Durable. Holds what I need for the work week.
5.0,This set is so cute and comfortable to wear. I put them together and wear on my middle finger and haven't taken them off.
5.0,"The best swim goggles. Fits a man's rounded face. Does not fog, does not leak."
5.0,Cheap alternative
5.0,"Super cute. The size 2-4 fit my average sized 11 year old. I had friends try it on and if your chest size is less than 33 inches and you weigh less than 120 lbs, it’s perfect for you.<br /><br />Cat ears. Low quality won’t last long but I don’t care."
5.0,"Bought these as a small engagement anniversary gift for the hubby, and he loved them! They’re cute with a touch of personality!"
5.0,"My new favorite shirt. As with all legendary whitetales, order a size under what you normally are. With that in mind, it fits great and is great quality."
5.0,Awesome frock. Excellent quality. Soft. I really didn’t expect this quality for $20. I would buy more if you guys have more designs.
5.0,"It’s definitely rubber and not silicone, but boy does it breathe better and feels wonderful.  Great for a classic dive or even rally feel<br /><br />It definitely is stiffer than similar FKM or NBR rubber straps - but is just as comfortable."
5.0,"ordered for my grandson , love it"
5.0,"This classy tunic is soft, comfortable and flattering if you're just a little thick in the mid-section. Probably real cute on thin women, too.<br />I'm 5'5&#34;, 160lbs, 38B and the large size droaped down in a very appealing manner. I can't wait to wear to a party with leggings or jeans. It is true tunic in length. It falls just a pinch past my buttocks. It could almost be a mini dress....almost.<br />My bra straps could be peeked beside the outer shoulder strap of the shirt. Careful adjustment of the strap can hide them. I think I would choose a coordinated color bra in case they slip. The color (grey) is lovely and classy and is approximated very well on my computer screen. The material is downright luxurious..<br />I love my new top!"
5.0,I'm very satisfied with this blouse it is so comfortable and it's true to size I ordered a medium and it fits just right
5.0,True to fit I love it would order again
5.0,"I wear this for work at least once a week, and it's held up to multiple washing/wearing just beautifully. (Machine wash, line dry) Comfortable and good fit. Would buy again."
5.0,Its made out of good quality fabric
5.0,"I love this skirt! Seriously, I wear it at least three times a week. It can be dressed up or down, the length is perfectly to just under my knee, looks lovely with or without a petticoat, and has a nice comfortable stretch. If you're between sizes, I'd recommend erring on the small side, as it is quite stretchy.<br /><br />I wash and dry it regularly and it has held up fine. It does not like to be ironed though; I once tried ironing it and the iron left a melted iron print on the fabric. I quickly replaced the skirt--it is too essential to do without!"
5.0,I used it everyday. Well worth it. But time will tell if it will hold up. Will update if it does not work out.
5.0,Easy to get on and off. Love the snaps between the legs for easy diaper change or removal.
5.0,The quality of this item is excellent. The materials are durable and looks great.  I like that the ear flaps can be worn in several ways to give warm to the ears. The item is light weight yet keeps out the cold. The design is classic. I like the brim to protect from rain or snow.  I would buy this again.
5.0,Love how it’s big enough but not too big.
5.0,I use them as actual nose rings: perfect size!
5.0,This product really helped me not throw away my purchase of the magnetic watch band.  Not only did the loops fit perfectly but it saved me money. My magnetic watch band is 22mm and I bought the 20mm size and it fit perfectly. I like to have it fit snug so my watch band stays in place.<br /><br />I have small wrists and the band I purchased was a bit big and I thought I would have to throw out the band but all I needed were these rubber loops.
5.0,Like it . Comfort .reasonable price.
5.0,"High quality product, way better than you would imagine for the price."
5.0,"I love this set. It is light and airy, perfect for the summer heat. The colors are beautiful. The headband is not that easy to get to stay on fine hair. I'm thinking of adding a little hot glue to it for traction."
5.0,These are the best baby tights I’ve found! I’d recommend them to anyone!!
5.0,I totally love this dress!!!! 😍 It looks so simple until you make a step and then it opens your right leg and it makes it soooo sexy and flirting!!! And the back - simply WOW!!!! They did a great job! Material is super light and floats as you walk. Amazing!!!
5.0,good nice pins and size
5.0,I’ve been wearing these several times a week for months. They fit well and wash wash well. I also dry them in the dryer.  Have gotten commitments on the pattern.
5.0,Beautiful necklace great product. Would recommend to purchase
5.0,"the quality is great,i don’t see this breaking anytime soon, came with an nice looking dust bag too. not sure if it’s waterproof but i havent got any fading or issues with my skin after sweating with the chain on,definitely gonna buy another one. thanks"
5.0,"I'm 5'10, 195 pounds (muscular build) and ordered an XL and it fits perfect. Not to tight not too baggy. I primarily use these for the gym but could be used for other occasions."
5.0,Dressy and very pretty.
5.0,Good fit - just what I was looking for.
5.0,Very happy! I will like the sleeves to be longer.
5.0,Bought them as a gift for my boyfran and was very pleased on how they looked on him :)
5.0,Great comfortable cool
5.0,This outfit is so cute and looks like the picture but it was a bit small in the pants area but it could be because I have really thick thighs and a big butt
5.0,"I have very sensitive ears and can only wear gold.  Silver earrings will irritate my ears in just a couple of hours.  Gold earrings tend to be priced more than I want to spend (because I am cheap). These were a great, cheap option and I love that they are princess cut!"
5.0,Great quality for the price. Bought it for my husband to wear when we travel and he seems to like it.
5.0,"Bought these for the wife, Jesus<br />Now I'm on thin ice at work for calling off . Once she puts<br /> these on, I knew that I had no chance at not knocking her up<br />She's due in May<br />Thanks pants"
5.0,"Beautiful! This ballet tutu is wonderful! It fits my five year old daughter so perfect with just a tiny bit of room to grow. Make sure to order one or two size larger than what your child normally wears. It's really good quality and the tutu really fluffs up and is very nice and thick. The tutu also has sparkles that are permanently fixed into it, so they don't get everywhere and you don't lose the sparkle. The underneath covers great and doesn't slide up on her. The heart shaped neck is lined with a beautiful velvety ribbon and it's shoulder straps are nice and wide. The back has an adorable braid of the velvet ribbon. She needed this black ballet leotard for ballet and she needs a purple that I'm definitely going to be ordering in this tutu. We absolutely love it and I know everyone at ballet are going to wonder where she got it.<br />I definitely recommend getting this ballet tutu leotard. It's great quality and absolutely beautiful."
5.0,"super comfortable, heavy duty, great for cozy winter nights."
5.0,"Nice, attractive, can dress up or relax."
5.0,"supe cute, fits perfectly and I have a small head so easy to adjust!"
5.0,Really nice little rain coat fits great it’s lined and it’s comfy
5.0,Love my beach hat. Pretty and practical. Soft and easily packed. Comes out of the suitcase like it went in.
5.0,Me encantarom
5.0,One of my very very favorite purses I've got to get more of these
5.0,I love it looks really great
5.0,This pendant is so beautiful! The quality is outstanding!
5.0,"These are identical to the large heart-shaped Dollager sunglasses with gold rims and brown lens, except these do not come with a bag, zippered case, cleaning cloth, or key chain screwdriver repair tool, and this pair is a different color with smoke colored lens and silver colored rims.  These do block all the harmful ultra-violet rays in the lens.  I am happy with this purchase."
5.0,Got a medium I’m 5’4 125 pounds pants are just right but top is small but overall nice
5.0,Love the retro look in white. My daughter loves these sunglasses. Comfortable.
5.0,Works very well! This is the first shoe cleaner I've purchased but it met my expectations
5.0,"This locket is much higher quality then I expected.  I needed one for a pet, and a human- so I decided to order one to see if it would be safe enough for my beloved Gracer, and it exceeded my expectations!!  Very solid, trustworthy and nicer then I ever expected!"
5.0,Great face mask and breathable
5.0,Beautiful necklace. I bought the earrings to match. Looks very expensive.
5.0,I bought this shirt for part of secret santa gift and cant say enough good things. The quality/material/color/fit are perfect.
5.0,Just exactly what I want to thank you very much for your speedy delivery
5.0,"Very pretty and not large.  Got them for my daughters to wear at our wedding and they were perfect.  Simple, pretty, dainty."
5.0,Arrived on time and worked well.
5.0,"Great price, feel sturdy and comfortable and they are beautiful!"
5.0,"These are the best leggings I have ever put on in my life & I own both Victoria’s Secret total knockout & knockout leggings as well as gym shark leggings.<br /><br />They fit true to size; I am 5’8” 182# Olympic lifter & a medium in the above leggings & a medium in these fit perfectly.<br /><br />The reason these are the BEST: they pass all tests. None of my leggings work for any activity. Inevitably they either start ripping at the crouch & aren’t truly “squat proof” or they are, but fall down at the top when I do yoga! I can go straight from lifting to yoga in these. They are also not cottony and annoying to sweat in - some of VS knockout leggings I can only wear in the winter, but not summer due to being cottony & hot/uncomfortable when you sweat. These are perfect for all seasons and activities.<br /><br />The only possible downside is they don’t have pockets, but I actually like that these don’t and have been looking for some without because they look aesthetically better and more seamless on."
5.0,I bought two. One for my bathroom when I go in shower and one for my bedroom when I go to sleep. Great product but my 13 month old found them and of course now they are hers lol
5.0,This was perfect for pictures of my 3 month old grand daughter!
5.0,"Great material, and nice fit!"
5.0,"Love it!!! Super nice, comfy and stylish."
5.0,I love these pants. I wish more colors were in my size!
5.0,So much fun!!!! Great costume
5.0,"This dress, was one of the best purchases I've ever made. It arrived quickly, fit absolutely perfect and I got compliments on it all night"
5.0,"My husband loves this wallet. He said it has plenty of slots for all of his cards, and he enjoys the display window for his ID. The best thing about it is that he loves the security of having the RFID blocking protection. He loves the material and says it's nice and soft and easy to slip in his back pocket of his pants. All in all, this is a great wallet!"
5.0,Like the color and can wear it with a lot of things.
5.0,"My vision is horrible, but LOVE THE WATCH<br /><br />DISNEY THE BEST"
5.0,Watch was exactly as expected and instructions were clear. Still have it today
5.0,Lots of pieces for the price. Croc store sells one single piece for $5
5.0,Pretty colors.  Fit great.
5.0,They're very nice!!!
5.0,My daughter love this outfit! Very cute
5.0,"But I need one size larger, unfortunately.  But will get plenty of use leave open. I am a big boy, I I wish it was 5 or 6 x.<br />Beautiful details and graphics.  Plan to add patches to make it exceptionally."
5.0,"I absolutely love this ear cuff. The size is small, but not too small and the design is beautiful. It is easy to adjust and it is comfortable to wear."
5.0,"Too short for me to use but pretty<br />Well made, no stones falling out. Strong clicker hold"
5.0,I love the fit of this shirt.  It's comfortable and stylish.  I've received many complements.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:944cd9a378ca356b77fe5118b296e267]] I’m very confident about my pregnant body and I was looking for something cute to start taking maternity pictures in and I seen these, super good quality, cute and stretchy although I need a extender due to getting bigger these fit good definitely happy with them."
5.0,"I was skeptical at first because I have tried quite a few shape wear products that have really not help me at all.  This one however makes me look amazing.  I have a baby pouch that no matter how much I work out I just cant get rid of.  This waist clincher works wonders.  Other shapers have been either too tight or they are just to small, this one fits as expected and stays in place. I love the fact that it is adjustable so if you do lose weight you can make it tighter.  Great product at a reasonable price."
5.0,Very comfy. Easy to maintain and put on.
5.0,My grandmother is having trouble with her hands being cold All the Time! We live in the south by the way. She asked for gloves and I found these. She loves them! She can still use her phone with them and she has 7 total pairs so she’ll always have a clean pair.
5.0,My husband gave me these earrings several month ago I absolutely love these earrings I wear them very frequently and they look sophisticated. He payed $199.00 and have no regrets I have accidentally drop them before and that's when I appreciated the resin core. No dent or scratches if they were solid gold they wouldn't be $199. I think they would make a great gift and they are very comfortable and definitely worth the price.
5.0,"I practically live in yoga pants as a yoga and meditation instructor, so I've gone through several different types. These are incredibly good pants for the price point.<br /><br />They fit and move well, are comfortable, are easy to get on and off but still offer a bit of compression and look really nice.<br /><br />The material is quality and the detail down the side is really nice. Just a really nice yoga pant overall."
5.0,Beautiful bought For a gift
5.0,"Excellent quality, soft silky cotton, collar included. If in between sizes, size down."
5.0,Love the fit. I’ve always not loved the texture when seeing them on others and I don’t love it now that I have my own pair but I don’t hate it. Very comfy but haven’t taken them yo the gym or for a run yet
5.0,This leotard was perfect for my girls first dance class. I got both the 2-4 and it fit both my girls perfect (one is a 2T one is a 4T). It’s super cute too. All the other dance moms were asking where I got it. Even the teacher asked!
5.0,I gave this to my friend from Colombia who loves visiting us in New Orleans. SHE LOVED IT
5.0,My son absolutely loves these. They seem to run a little small.
5.0,Cute product!!!
5.0,I will be ordering more of these. The dress is comfortable and flattering.
5.0,"The dress was absolutely gorgeous!! The measurements were just off.  Make sure you get them correct if you choose to go that route.  Otherwise just choose your normal size.  Really, a beautiful dress. I’m really bummed it did not work out for me to wear to a black tie event I was going to.  They were very helpful with me returning it."
5.0,Way better than expected
5.0,I wore these to work. They are very soft and comfortable.
5.0,"Comfy, soft cute shirt for my 2 year old"
5.0,"I use to ride horse, I love it becouse is easy to use with the boot"
5.0,Perfect fit over my glasses. The polarized glass works well and the frames are comfortable. Nice product.
5.0,My daughter asked for a potato sweater and fell in love with this one
5.0,I am in the process of replacing my sterling silver earrings with stainless steel-no need to polish. These are lightweight and look great.
5.0,"Great suit, super cute!"
5.0,"Love this dress. Fits perfectly. I want every color. I get so many compliments. I have a tiny waist and large bust, but this stretches a little and it is amazing!!!"
5.0,Really nice! Not cheap or tacky looking.
5.0,Love these.. super comfy my daughter said!
5.0,El producto tiene muy buena calidad
5.0,Fit as expected and looked great.
5.0,One of the best live albums from the 80s. Had it on cassette and bought the cd recently because.......I'm stuck at home and bored.
5.0,My family is headed to Orlando for theme park vacay and needed something that would keep my glasses on while riding rollercoasters so that  I could actually still see what is going on around me while riding. These definitely fit the bill!
5.0,Purchased an XL. I'm  6ft tall! Love it!!!!
5.0,Love this dress! Got multiple compliments!
5.0,Fabulous earrings! Very cute with silver tone!
5.0,Fasted delivers ever! Got here five days early and material is wonderful!!
5.0,Nice boots and great in winter.  Covers the legs from cold winds.  Looks great.  I wear them with a pancho.
5.0,"It is sturdy and convenient with a little pouch to carry it, so my belongings don’t get wet after using the umbrella. I would recommend people buying it. Price is fair too."
5.0,Good quality. Delicate and classy
5.0,Already responded!  Glasses serve their purpose especially sinc high power lenses are hard to find
5.0,Bought for girlfriend she loves them. Great little gift
5.0,Perfect fit! Super comfy! Fairly breathable
5.0,I purchased these because they were cheap and i wanted to try them out. I was so surprised when they didn’t turn my ears green- ive had them in for a few months now. They’re super cute and for the price it’s a great quality set of earrings.
5.0,"For the price this is amazing! Price and fits just right for me! I’m happy. Capri is just right for me too, since I’m 5ft tall, 130lbs.<br />I ordered a medium.  I usually wear a size 10.. I always expect capris to be too long. But for me this is perfect!! No need to alter. I would recommend it to anyone my size!"
5.0,Love it! I felt like a princess
5.0,Such a sturdy purse!
5.0,"I bought this necklace to match a pair of earings and I absolutely love it! It comes with a thin, box chain and the chain has an extra loop in it about 2 or 3 inches from the end.  I am assuming it is there to make the length of the chain adjustable.  And since I like shorter chains anyways, I think I will find a cute bobble to put on the end so there is something to see other then the dangling chain. Overall, I Love it."
5.0,Worked great.  Kept clothes neat and tidy.
5.0,"This p.j. set is so soft and comfortable I ordered 2 more. The fabric is light but still cozy and the pockets are a bonus. I was worried the material would be too hot for sleeping, but it's surprisingly cool. The colors are not quite as shown: The blue or ""deongaree"" color looks like a royal blue on screen, but it's actually more of a teal or peacock. The rose-red or ""pink"" color looks plum/purple on screen but it's actually brighter - more of a raspberry. I ordered my usual ""small"" size and the fit is perfectly loose and roomy."
5.0,They looked well made but they were a gift so I can’t say much more than that.
5.0,"Very nice & were double sided, would definitely purchase again!!"
5.0,I absolutely love them! Looks just like the real thing!
5.0,"Really love these, better quality them expected! I wish I could submit a photo, but worth it. Would recommend. 👍 Soft too"
5.0,So cute and very comfy!! My daughter loves these.
5.0,These bags are cute and durable. Basic Halloween images make it perfect to give out to staff without scaring or offending anyone. Great bags. Large size. Used as snack/beverage goodie bags for a work event.
5.0,"Love this, I used it as a pool coverup in addition to in the house. I should have paid more attention to size chart. Should have sizes down 2 sizes instead of 1. Still love it, it washes well, hasn’t shrunk."
5.0,nice addition to my Christmas bracelet
5.0,My daughter loves Disney movies so this was the perfect shirt for her. It was good quality and washed really well. I ordered a size 12 but it my opinion it fit more like a size 10.
5.0,Watch is a gem. Looks more expensive than it is. Like!
5.0,Like these tanks!
5.0,very good quality and fit
5.0,This is made really well. There are actual beads strung onto heavy wire to make the shape of the top of this wand. Even if your child plays hard with it you can bend them back into shape.
5.0,Absolutely beautiful. I bought this for a present and now I want one.
5.0,"Lovely patterns, great quality, nice traditional feel,"
5.0,I have a pair of pants from Erica in black that I love and I thought these were same. The reason for my return is they don't have front pockets like my black pair.
5.0,Excellent Quality and Very Soft ! Buy It ! Adorable and Big So Will Fit Nicely !
5.0,Love love love!! I usually wear a medium but I ordered a large and it fits perfectly! I’m a 36DD so I needed a larger size for the girls. This dress is beautiful! So happy about this purchase!
5.0,"Our granddaughter is turning 4 and loved these.  They fit tight enough, come with a cute bag, and the graphics on the glasses is lots of fun for her....  We're off to ClubMed with her and my daughter, she told her mom 3 times not to forget her ""sharkies""."
5.0,I love Ginger Snaps!
5.0,"These are the best masks I've purchased today's date. Very comfortable, appealing solid colors also quick and easy to put on or take off."
5.0,"I bought the black leather gloves with cashmere lining for my boyfriend as a late Christmas gift and he loves them!<br />I'm always kinda ify on buying things online because sometimes the quality isn't always what it's made up to be in the presentation, but the leather was very nice and soft and overall they just look great. I wouldn't say that they are warmer because they're leather, but you don't have to worry about them soaking through because of rain or snow. I think these are a great gift for anyone, and I will probably buy them in the future for others!"
5.0,Fits like a glove! So happy with this dress.
5.0,I love the material and fit of these! They are higher waited and very movable. Would definitely purchase again!

5.0,"My boyfriends family and friends got a real kick out of this shirt, great for &#34;The Office&#34; fans for which the joke became a household phrase."
5.0,This is such a great gift! Great for smaller hands!
5.0,"Love this shirt!!! The bottom is perfect for my hips. The sides scoop up, so the front & back fall where they belong, and don’t bunch up. I’ve recommended this shirt to others, and I’ll definitely order this again!!"
5.0,I love this watch it looks and feels so sturdy. It looks a bit better in person than in the picture. Perfect watch for my clinical rotations.
5.0,Love them..used them as leggings to go w my long shirts.
5.0,"This dress is GORGEOUS! I ordered it to wear to my Husband's work Christmas party at a casino. I was worried the red would clash with my skin tone, I am very pale with blonde hair & blue eyes...but it is amazing! If you are on the line about purchasing, just do it, you will love it.<br />The material and workmanship are top quality and I cannot believe this dress costs so little. I will be purchasing another color for future events. For reference I am 5'6&#34;, 175 lbs and have a 38 DD chest...I ordered an XL and it fits like a glove."
5.0,"I bought a size bigger and these fit just right for me. The tightness is tight and form fitting, but at the same time not to the point where it pulls your hair and hurts your legs. Overall the stretch is fantastic and these are great to wear."
5.0,Its design is very unique. Wearing this turtle necklace will make you look more attractive and everyone around you will be attracted to you.

5.0,"Very good product, everything arrived according to Peru, in the times given, thank you."
5.0,Nice quality. True to size. Will purchase again.
5.0,"I returned from a vacation in Italy this fall, regretting the fact that I bought so many souvenirs for family and friends that I had very little for myself.  With winter weather approaching in New York, I was working on my holiday wish list when a great thought occurred to me - why not find a warm sweatshirt that reminds me of my trip to Italy?  After an extended Google search, I found this shirt, which appeared to have an attractive Italian flag logo.  When I happily found the shirt under my tree on Christmas morning, I discovered that it exceeded my expectations.  It looks great, it fits perfectly, and the fabric is a good heavy-duty one that should hold up for years.  It's much higher quality than I might have gotten in Italy, but for a much lower price than I would normally pay in the souvenir stands.  I'd buy another one of these in a second!"
5.0,"elegant looking and spacious, only downfall is wish the straps were longer."
5.0,"Nice, believable Cubic Zirconia earrings!<br /><br />As a former jeweler in my distant past the CZs look really nice. I got out one of my loupes and everything looked great. This is 18K white gold over sterling silver which is important as more women than you would guess are allergic to the nickel that is a lot of sterling silver. Thus I would judge them to be hypo-allergic. The CZs look like really good ones - the reason that's important (other than they more closely mimic diamonds) is good one will not turn cloudy or yellow over time. I would judge these to be D to E color based on my matched set of stones - clarity looks like it's at least a VS2. Cut looks spot on as well the CZ is a brilliant cut more commonly known as a 'round' cut.<br /><br />I would have preferred gold plated backings over the plastic disc used but then that would have add 3 to 5 dollars to the price.<br /><br />BTW gold plated (or gold overlay, etc.) is usually called vermeil by those in the jewelry trade. Ionic plated is most commonly considered the best as the gold layer is thicker and has a better bond with the silver. I like bigger stones like this in a 'white' setting - either sterling silver, white gold of platinum as I (and many others) feel that enhances the look and very slightly improves the stones color.<br /><br />I received this at a very steep discount for my full, honest and complete review.<br /><br />I would rate this really nice set of CZ earrings a 9.0 to 9.5 out of 10 - the only real 'flaw' is that I would have preferred a different basking but that's a minor thing! - Highly recommended!"
5.0,It works amazing for the 42 would not recommend for the 44. Amazingly sturdy and very pretty!
5.0,"It's a very beautiful watch. Although it's a little lighter than I expected I'm A big guy out 250lb, so the weight will be satisfactory for most people. For the price it's beautiful, and you can't simply expect more. Go for it..."
5.0,This is a beautiful bag !
5.0,"Great Shirt stays, much sturdier and more comfortable than the 12 dollar versions I bought before. These actually stay tightened and are a lot higher quality than my last pair. Spend the extra money, they are worth it."
5.0,"Beautiful dress for a work event I had to go to. Appropriate length, comfortable, breathable fabric. I'm a 40DDD and I didn't have to pin the front area with a safety pin, but I did wear a camisole underneath."
5.0,My boyfriend loves this...its heavyweight plus nice and soft on the inside and has the windbreaker material inside the arms which he says keeps him even warmer. Highly recommend!
5.0,Purse is beautiful. But barely fit my small iPhone
5.0,"The socks were a gift.  However, the recipient liked them very much.  The saying was appropriate for her circumstances."
5.0,"Smart wool liner gloves are so much warmer than the polyester liner gloves that I’ve used in the past. They hold up well and it’s a cute pattern! I wish they were a tad less expensive, but they are so high quality that I would buy them again!"
5.0,"Fit just right and worked for our planned activities.  Wish I could order another pair, but they are sold out."
5.0,"My toddler loves these shoes. They are light, comfortable and pretty."
5.0,"Love these, bought a few more pairs to keep in my jewelry box!"
5.0,Solid with some weight to it. Hasn’t chipped yet after a month and gets used daily.
5.0,Better deal than the same robe at the Bullseye. Arrived on time and was what I expected.
5.0,"im usually a little timid on names of brands i dont know but these joggers are pretty dope, i have a 38-40 waiste 6'1 and 185lbs  and i like my pants/sweatpants to have a mad loose fit but still not fall off my butt and the XL fit perfect with more than enough room"
5.0,Absolutely beautiful rings. I bought them for my parents 40th wedding anniversary surprise party. They love them.
5.0,Great glasses! The polarized lenses are great to reduce glare
5.0,LOVE THESE. So comfy and cute at a great price!
5.0,"By keeping my wrist warm, my hands and fingers don't get as cold."
5.0,Cute and stylish cap. It adjusts to your head size. I removed the two silver rings from the tip of the hat because the noise they made was annoying lol. They were very easy to bend and remove. Nice hat to have in your collection.
5.0,"They're hip, they're cool."
5.0,Fits good as expected. Super cute tank!
5.0,Great gloves highly recommend!
5.0,"Great lounge pants.  Comfy, nice material. Fit as expected."
5.0,"The main reason I bought this wallet is the 2 id card slots; if there were more id card slots, it would have been over the top! I am very satisfied with this product because of the good workmanship and the quality of the leather. I like it that the credit card slots are a bit snug, gives me the assurance that none of my cards will slip/fall off."
5.0,An indispensable sewing tool. It made a believer out of me. Now I can be sure that what I'm trying to line up stays that way until the needle reaches it. It is positively essential for sewing thick quilted layers and bindings. Annie made a believer out of me.
5.0,Beautiful. Bought the earrings to match and have gotten many compliments
5.0,Our music teacher loved it! Thanks.
5.0,It fits well on your septum and isn't to bulky. It does smell like medal when you first get it but you can probably wash it with some hand soup or something. The skulls are so little and cute but still big enough so you can tell that's it's skulls.
5.0,"I'm very pleased with this product. The actual ring is perfect, but the original leather strap was and a little bit too thick, so I purchased some thinner, softer leather which allows the ring to swing about more freely."
5.0,The pin is very beautiful and a lot heavier than expected for the price. It is well made and I have received a lot of compliments on it. The quality is very good and I highly recommend this product.
5.0,"These are great! They are really small when folded and easy to fold back into the little bags, which is why I prefer them over the large fabric bags that are hard to fold/ remember to take into the store. These are so small you can fit a few in a pocket or in a small section of a purse, but are about the size of a regular plastic bag when unfolded! Great value!"
5.0,My girl is tall but this is the perfect size without riding up or hurting her shoulders. Only time will tell how it holds up over the summer!
5.0,My granddaughter loves this necklace.  Kitty charm is adorable! Chain broke after a very short time but the company was very gracious and replaced the chain.  Thank you again.  I would definitely recommend this company.
5.0,I bought these in dark grey and they are one of my favorite pairs of shoes.  I can get away with them for business casual and they work perfectly with any casual outfits.  They've held up to quite a bit of use over the last 4 months and even do well in the rain.  I haven't even bothered to use a water proof coating.  They're also extremely comfortable and fit great (size 5.5).
5.0,I love this belt  the quality is great it’s A1 !!! I will definitely buy again
5.0,Loved dress. Fit great. A tab bit tight under arms hit my arms are larger than normal
5.0,"The swimsuit is perfect suit.<br />The bright yellow and printed flower make me look good and feel bright.<br />I also like the waist height, it’s perfect, not too low or height.<br />Recommend!"
5.0,This wristband arrived as described and it wears nice!
5.0,"Very pretty, suggest removing the links as it comes very large."
5.0,My husband wears hearing aids. The mask constantly pops the hearing aids off of his ears and he has almost lost the hearing aids numerous times. With this beanie having the buttons for the mask it makes it much easier for him as he is not fearing losing his hearing aids.
5.0,"My wife loves them! She wishes they came in yellow, turquoise, and lime green, as well as the five colors already offered!"
5.0,Exactly what I needed and arrived so fast! Thank you
5.0,Love these but they both had to be rebuilt
5.0,"I picked up my first of these while thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail in 2014. After 2000+ miles it's still in great shape, despite some unsightly sweat stains. I've picked up a few more since then simply because they just tick every box for me: Foldable, lightweight, durable, there's a loop inside to hang or attach it to something, it has 50 UPF protection, and it's nice and unassuming looking. Honestly it's tough to find a hiking hat that doesn't look awkward and I don't like baseball or trucker hats, so this military style cap fits the bill perfectly."
5.0,"Beautiful dress, fits me very well"
5.0,Great looking that fit great as long as you go up 1 size in waist. Love them so I got a second pair for a upcoming long trip.
5.0,I love the color the beauty the size to the craftmenship ... It's all just perfect
5.0,Feather light and the titanium doesn’t distort or lose its shape after repeated additions or subtractions of keys. Slightly overpriced but overall still worth the price.
5.0,Used at work. No complaints. Nice to have the Terry cloth headband inside!
5.0,These are high waisted and very flattering. They have just enough fabric to hid my mommy tummy and let me feel comfortable while boating and out on the water. They are a full coverage bottom for me because I have a smaller backside. I carry most of my weight in my belly. I have slimmer legs and rear. I am 5’4 140-145 and I bought a M. It fit perfectly.
5.0,"Perfect top! I am a 34 B and always a medium and the medium fits perfect. It is the right length, not too short. Super soft and doesn't get stretched out, at all. Cold wash and lay flat to dry to keep it in good shape.<br />I have been looking for this top for literally years. I am ordering 3 colors and a few extra black ones for safe keeping."
5.0,Keeps you warm. It’s soft and color exactly what picture shows.
5.0,This belt is very well made. Great value. I was looking for a belt that was not totally black. This fit the bill perfectly.
5.0,Beautiful dress! No effort needed to make a great fashion statement. Lots of compliments. Comfortable & beautiful at the same time. Fits true to size.
5.0,"I tried a pair of these on many years ago in Guam because I saw a $80 pair of flip flops on the shelf at the Navy Exchange surrounded by $20 Reefs and Quiksilvers,  I wanted to try them on and see why they were 4 times the price. My foot slipped into heaven. I didn't buy them then. I wished I had, but, I found them here on Amazon on sale and snagged them up. These &#34;slippers&#34; (as they are called in the pacific islands where these are made in Hawaii) ate the best of the best in quality and comfort. I wore these this past weekend while teaching my daughters how to ride their bicycles up and down the street chasing them, felt like running on clouds."
5.0,"Looming for a dress to wear to fit my 4 month pregnant belly, that would still make me look nice, and found it with this. Very satisfied."
5.0,I love it being  a true hippy this is my new favorite jacket and it's perfectly colored
5.0,Absolutely love. Fits perfect. Nice quality. So cute!
5.0,"Very fine quality and for every day use. For me two things matters most, quality of leather and weight of the bag. The weight is very light and thats what i was looking for. This is my third Tory Burch hand bag.<br />I would recommend this handbag to a friend."
5.0,Got the 35mm and they are perfect. Beautifully crafted and the clasp seems sturdy.
5.0,Wish I had discovered these years ago. Best socks I have ever owned. Super soft. Great trouser socks for work. Feet stay warm and dry (unlike cotton or synthetics).
5.0,Just live its vibrant colors
5.0,"I love this bra. I wanted a sporty swim suit and couldnt find anything remotely affordable until I found this -  I used it as a swimming suit top and basically lived in it for a week during a backpacking trip. Swam, hiked, and slept in it. Super comfortable, dried quickly, and is cute - I got lots of compliments. Runs slightly small in my opinion. More colors please!"
5.0,"Very pleased with product, showed up early and is exactly what I wanted!!"
5.0,This dress is well made. Great for the price comparing to the ones at the bridal stores.<br />It was long and I altered it. Loved the style on the back. Thighten it to fix even better.<br />Well made I ordered 1 size bigger and it worked out perfect.
5.0,They are cute and good.
5.0,Best camo hands down !
5.0,"Great material, daughter loved it!"
5.0,"I'm absolutely IN LOVE with it! Hugs my body perfectly and the dress literally makes me look so hot lol. It's very pretty, I definitely recommend!"
5.0,5hr play time! Nice!
5.0,This anklet is delicate and adds a bit of sparkle.  I do recommend it…
5.0,It came just in time. And it fits my head perfectly nice and keeps my hair secure
5.0,"I have to admit something...I'm still not sure exactly what this necklace is 'supposed' to do for me, but I love it! I know that it's supposed to help improve energy, but products like this tend to work a bit differently with my body. Energy-boosting products have a tendency to provide mood-improving benefits for me, which is an awesome, yet surprising benefit! I haven't noticed a significant increase in energy...in fact, it's finals week, so I'm sleeping a lot less than I should be, so I'm always sleepy, but I'm not experiencing the drastic mood changes that generally come with tiredness for me, which is really nice!<br />I love how easy this necklace is to take off or put on, thanks to the super-simple magnetic clasp that I find myself playing with all the time. I do wish the clasp wasn't so heavy though, as it makes it more likely to end up at the front of my neck, instead of in back where I want it to be...but I do like that I can play with the little metal pieces in the front, putting them together, or spacing them out however I want to. It makes the necklace a bit more versatile, and easy to wear with a lot of different outfits! This necklace is easily suitable for wearing with a t-shirt, but can also be dressed up to suit just about anything that i want to wear. I'm definitely a fan, and have been wearing this every single day since I received it.<br />I received this necklace for the purpose of my review, but my opinions are 100% my own, and based on MY personal use. I was not told what to say, only asked to give an honest review based on my own experience with the product."
5.0,Bought this as a gift and he loves it!
5.0,"I'm a size 36/38<br />I got an xl and it fits nicely.<br />The pants feel fitted, not loose which is what I wanted."
5.0,"This necklace is beautiful! The chain has an antique look and the shimmering mermaid &#34;scales&#34; are gorgeous! I bought this for my granddaughter and loved it so much that I bought one for myself,too! The price is amazing!"
5.0,Love these. They are sturdy well made great quality.
5.0,It's perfect I got a lot of compliments.
5.0,I love the unique style. Very lightweight but sturdy.
5.0,Very comfy pjs! The waistband is a little tight but nothing too uncomfortable or worth returning. Love them!
5.0,"As described and pictured. A bit bigger length wise then I thought, however not enough to prevent use and wear. Comfortable and looks great with my dresses, the width accentuates my waist well and makes it look smaller, and give a great hour glass look. I am 5'9&#34; tall 36dd bust and 29.5&#34; waist."
5.0,"This was given to me as a gift, and I absolutely love it! It can easily fit wrists of many different sizes! It's also very fun, and beautiful!"
5.0,"Loved this!!! Bought it for my husband as a gift and it is way better than the picture! This is a super high quality key chain, sturdy and extremely well made! Very fancy!"
5.0,"I bought these to put in my son's shoes for daycare.  Just like the bottle labels from the same maker, they are fabulous and last forever.  Highly recommended!"
5.0,Ordered the green shirt and the color is exactly what I needed to complete my outfit
5.0,Proudly wear this nice hat.

5.0,I ordered a size up & it fits perfectly!
5.0,"Nice jacket, well made and comfortable"
5.0,I love these!! I have to order some more!
5.0,"This is such a great idea. I keep it in my bike bag... keeps my tire levers, light chargers, screwdrivers, everything! Plenty of room on this thing, too... No more floating crap in the bag."
5.0,This belt will add value and sexiness to your clothes.  But it fits only waists than are medium to large.<br />Great value.
5.0,"Arrived quickly and almost the same as pictured, shows with hummingbird but had butterfly instead.  Not a problem though i like both.  Have had no problems with it accidentally opening.  Love it!!"
5.0,"I really love this bracelet.  I gave one to all my sisters for Christmas, they too, loved it.  I wear mine every day.  Love the Chakra healing benefit<br />Of this piece.  It has a special place in my heart."
5.0,The item arrived a bit later than anticipated however they were of a better quality than expected and the pouch that the items were shipped in was really nice and a quality item as well. This item made the perfect gift for a friend.
5.0,"This jacket is so cute. I’ve already worn it twice. It does not close (fasten) so if that’s what you’re looking, this isn’t the jacket. It’s so cute and chic. Sleeves are kind of exact (i have long arm).<br />Love it nonetheless"
5.0,Beautiful top. Colors are true to the picture. Nice quality.
5.0,I love this dress. Great buy
5.0,Loved the bags for the price. I had a few missing in my order and one came in with permanent ink stain so I messaged Amazon and they took care of it immediately!
5.0,I usually don't write reviews but this necklace was so awesome. My sister really loved it and I was shocked at the amazing quality. Very heavy duty charms and so cute! I will definitely purchase again.
5.0,This dress is so cute! My daughter absolutely loves dinosaurs so this dress was perfect. The collar detail is so dainty and the pattern was cute. The dress fit as expected! Would totally buy again
5.0,Perfect socks for my toddler and they're so stylish as well. The price is great for the amount of socks we received and they're not as tight as so many baby socks tend to be.
5.0,"Loved the top but didn’t realize that it opened in the back…. I would have gotten a size up, but I am keeping it because I am dropping in size and I will have it for next summer."
5.0,These were a gift for my son and he is very pleased with the fit and comfort. The leather is supple and cashmere quite soft.
5.0,"Loved them, would love to have more. Don't know if I will order form Amazon again after what happen with bargain post!"
5.0,Watch looks exactly as displayed however it's not my style I think it was more of an impulse buy. I have a small wrist so it wraps around quite a bit which makes it look odd.
5.0,I've used these for a while and they rock. Great support and comfortable. I highly recommend these for Oly lifts and squatting in general.
5.0,These lenses fit my old style Oakley M frame sunglasses and price was unbeatable and will continue to purchase them as long as I can.
5.0,Absolutely GORGEOUS bracelet...Breathtaking!!
5.0,I love these! I wear them with my hanakokun shirt and get compliments on them all the time. Great quality! Can hold out in windy environments.
5.0,Great value. Great product.
5.0,"This was prefect for my girls 6 month photos. I loved this dress so much I bought two for my twins.<br /><br />I gave them to friends of mine with 3 and 5 month old babies. They also loved them and can't wait to take pictures in it. They were shocked when I told them I got them off Amazon.<br /><br />Th skirt is fluffy, ruffles and is downright adorable, the onesie part fit my 6 month olds very well. About 15-17lbs each.<br /><br />The headband that comes with it has an interchangeable bow. You can attach your own hair clip to it.<br /><br />The only downside is this is a dress for pictures only and one day of wear."
5.0,I love New Era Hats! More so I love Support are troops hats. So this is the best of both worlds Batman and supporting our troops!
5.0,the little socks really complete the outfit.
5.0,Used on my baseball glove.  Works good
5.0,Not expensive and do the job pretty nice
5.0,True to size. Lovely soft material
5.0,This is a good case.  I use for Rx sunglasses when backpacking.  I can hook onto my pack for a quick switch between sunglasses and regular glasses.  Zipper is holding up well.
5.0,great outfit that she loves to wear. shipped quickly. it arrived so fast i couldn't believe it
5.0,These are beautiful..your son will love them
5.0,Great and very sturdy I love it
5.0,Got this for my grandma I love the fact that it looks like an expensive watch and fits a smaller wrist
5.0,I use this for walking during the evening when I sometimes let dark sneak up on me.  It's very obvious for the passing motorist to see me with this light beaming.  It makes me feel safer and visible.  Would recommend.
5.0,Great color and price
5.0,Love these Shorts
5.0,"I really like this dress, fabric is nice, very comfy fun to wear dress!"
5.0,"I bought these compression socks because I have feet issues, because of surgeries and my feet feel much better...See I am on my feet at work for 8hrs on hard surfaces and my feet take a pounding...I have orthopedic inserts that I have to wear inside my shoes, so regular work socks don’t work for me...I am very pleased with these socks, I bought another set...happy feet"
5.0,I recently purchased these earrings for my 7 year old who has very sensitive skin and I was surprisingly pleased. These earrings are the right size and they were easy to put on which has been an issue with other earrings. The quality is good and the backs/post  are sturdy so hopefully my daughter will be able to wear them for a while.
5.0,This top is so comfortable and really stylish also. I received a lot of compliments on this top
5.0,"I absolutely love these and they are exactly what I was looking for. The fur goes throughout the entire shoe, its not just for show. They are way too big though. I wear 9.5 so I just got the L and not the XL and they're still way too big."
5.0,Ran true to size.  I'm 5'6'' and the medium was ideal.  The quality of this suit is great and it will last a couple of summers at least.
5.0,"It's the perfect size and it stacks the cards appropriately. The leather quality seems very nice. I get bored with wallets and like to change them annually since they aren't costly ,so longevity is not an issue with me. If the RFID works it's a plus. But today we all need additional credit monitoring outside of a wallet"
5.0,Love this purse! I love it soooo much that I don't want to use it. It was bought to be used casually but it looks so classy. It's a good quality product and would buy another one if it was available in different colors.
5.0,I bought this to use for my Ms. Frizzle costume and it was perfect! I was actually impressed with how well it was made for what it is as well.
5.0,This is an attractive quarter zip pullover with pockets.  The material is mostly cotton and it has a fleece lining.  Very comfortable and warm.  It fits according to size.  Would recommend!
5.0,The color is awesome! Perfect for work!
5.0,"The colors of this Green/Blue Leaf dress is so VIBRANT! I usually wear a size 10 or 12 in dress size, and am 5' 7"" tall. I bought a Large and it fit perfectly."
5.0,My Grandson wears this everyday.  He enjoys the play of the game.
5.0,Love this product. Very comfortable for jogging
5.0,I was excited about this dress but sadly it didn't fit. The dress was exactly what I thought it would be but didn't seem to fit my petite frame. Arrived quickly and in good condition. I worked with the seller to help me find a dress better suited for my body type which is pretty outstanding for a seller here on Amazon. I am very impressed with Daxvens and highly recommend this seller and their dresses.
5.0,Love a better chain
5.0,"Good quality, can fit everything I need. License is kind of hard to remove though, guess it needs to be worked in. Other than that, great wallet."
5.0,Nice and stretch!  Very comfortable.
5.0,"I'm 5 ft. 5in. tall, 123 pounds....ordered a small and it fits perfectly!! I love the light fabric and the colors are perfect for summer! I had countless compliments when I wore it to church. Everyone wanted to know where I got it! It's super comfortable...I wish I had one of each color/pattern! I will definitely order again!"
5.0,The pair I received are very well made. The color combinations are beautiful.
5.0,Great ear protection and very comfortable.
5.0,"We are in St. Pete Beach, Florida, and this bag has been perfect for my daughter’s shell collection."
5.0,Comfort and pockets
5.0,I love these jeans so much I bought a 2nd pair!
5.0,So cute && stretchy. I thought I wasn’t gone be able to fit it cause I’m a plus size girl but it fit perfect! Love the material too!
5.0,Looks just like what it is. Quality product i even used it to save some one. A crazy dog in the neighborhood was being agressive toward a family and i lassoed it with this lanyard. It held up just fine until the owner showed up.
5.0,So comfy and cute. Nice soft material.
5.0,I purchased them for my twins boys their in love with it
5.0,Comparing other reviews is a must.  Order for your height/weight is a good thing to keep in mind.  It's a nice suit.  I've only tried it on and washed/dried it.
5.0,The Perfect Dress’
5.0,I liked the dress. Perfect for the occasion I needed it for.
5.0,It's a really pretty shirt but the crochet parts feel so weak and tight on the arms that I feel it would rip if I hug someone tightly!! :) but otherwise it's really nice! I got a large and it still feels tight around my arms and I have normal arms!
5.0,Adorable will buy again selection awesome
5.0,"As a loyal Casio customer, I have to confess that this product is my favorite above all. This watch is affordable and serves its purpose, plus more. I wear this watch to tell the date and time, set an alarm, and a timer when needed. Another perk is, this watch is waterproof! My watch has survived countless exposure to water while I am doing house chores. Are you looking for a simple, yet functional watch? This may be the product for you."
5.0,The material is very comfortable.  The jacket is stylish and perfect for the person who doesn't want something ordinary
5.0,I've received many compliments on this scrub top.

5.0,Great value!  My daughters love them!
5.0,Fits well and perfect for cold weather.
5.0,Comfy casual dress!
5.0,Love it! Fits great and quality made.
5.0,"These glasses are perfect! I have a very round face and wide nose bridge so, standard glasses do not fit correctly and often leave indentations on either side of my nose after I remove them. These are perfect, leave no indentations and provide full coverage on the sides (periphery) and underneath the eye. They are not too dark so you can't see and are perfect for bright days. I would buy again in other colors. Highly recommend this product!"
5.0,The ring I ordered was just like the picture. It looks even better in person
5.0,"These earring are really cool. It takes a little practice to get all three pieces to snap together (front piece, behind the ear flower, and backing) but it's worth it!  I tend to miss match the fronts and backs to create diff earring than shown. Definitely enjoy every bit of these."
5.0,Like due to safety concerns with exercise equipment. Fits snugly but goes over knuckles well.
5.0,Gorgeous necklace. Sparkles much more than beads from a craft store.
5.0,Bought for my charm bracelet to always remember earning an Alaskan cruise in my company
5.0,"I ordered this as a Christmas present...but I did open it to make sure it wasn't damaged it wasn't. I was also surprised by the quality its really well made, I'm sure the person I bought it for will love it!"
5.0,"Love them, especially since they have multi shades of blue."
5.0,"I am very happy with this wallet. It holds what I need, yet it is slim in my front pocket. I could see a retailer charging more than I paid for it here on Amazon. The stitching is precise, the design minimalistic but practical."
5.0,"This scarf is so soft! It is well worth the cost to not have the scratchiness of less expensive materials against my face and neck. The colors seem to be a little darker than what they seemed to be on my computer, but are still quite lovely. I will be wearing this often!!"
5.0,"Nice quality, good price"
5.0,"So comfy, better then Ofos and cheaper!<br />Gotta have a pair. It’s well worth the money."
5.0,"But this for my husband, looks even better on him. 🙂 Super high quality you expect from RL, nice colors too."
5.0,They came in a very nice leather case. I looks so fancy. The glasses feel very light on the face. You can tell it is plastic but they do not look cheap at all. This was bought to be used as vacation sunglasses as I do not like to bring expensive shades to the beach. Very stylish without the fancy brand pricetag.
5.0,"I needed something to wear for my bridal shower. I float from a 1x to 3x, so I was keeping my fingers crossed for this! I've been looking everywhere for a dress like this that wasn't chiffon, and this is PERFECTION. It fits perfectly and the length is perfect. It's a great, quality material that's thick enough to not be see through but not so thick it's hot (important in this Florida heat!). I love it so much, I bought two more in different colors."
5.0,I ordered a size small and it fits like a medium but over all it's nice material and im excited to wear it out
5.0,Cleaned my shoes and were left like new
5.0,My five years old loves them
5.0,"Fast shipping, came folded neatly in a plastic bag inside a box with padding. Im 6 ft 150lbs and this fit me perfectly in a large. I love it"
5.0,Bought the next size up figuring they ran small. Seems to run a half to full size smaller.
5.0,Nice quality. Worth the money. Well designed.  Fabric is soft. Can wash and dry on low with no problem.
5.0,She wears them most... thats how I know...
5.0,Perfect fit - great for valentines day
5.0,Lovely family tree necklace
5.0,Bought as a gift for wife and she loved it. Seems to be reasonable quality for price paid.<br /><br />Happy.
5.0,"I love the beanie, love the material, very soft and fits snug but not tight... I was shocked when I put my hand inside the beanie and my hand went all the way through. Not that it was ripped, that's just how it's made - doesn't change my opinion on it. I absolutely love it, love how it fits and looks."
5.0,This is a great piece that I wear all the time. I paid way less for it than most people would guess! I've gotten loads of comments on how great it looks.
5.0,Perfect for Tiger fans and it has pockets! Got a pair for my hubs and myself.
5.0,Fabulous! Love the fitting. Amazing feel
5.0,16 year old loves it!!
5.0,"OKAY, in all honesty I thought it would be an eh okay set but they are metal, nice not bad guys. A good deal if you like these I wear them 2 3 days in a row okay. So alright in my book."
5.0,I love that it’s long enough to fit around my wrist and it’s a good fit.  I’ve gotten compliments on how it looks.
5.0,They looked too small when I pulled them out of the package but fit like a dream. I usually wear size 18 and the XL are just right. I just ordered another pair in the blue. They don't get saggy as the day goes on and are warmer than most leggings I have. I wish they had more colors so I could buy everyone!
5.0,Good quality. Order one size larger. Top and side ties adjust easily to fit. i got an American 14/16. I'm 5'3&#34;and wear a size 10/12 pants/dress and 40D bra. The size the suit fits fine and looks cute.
5.0,"Super cute and well made! He warmed up in it pretty quick but for us that'll be nice for Halloween night in Seattle. It's too short in the torso so I just unsnapped the top crotch button and works fine for a few short occasions.<br />FYI: My little guy is 27months old and 97% for height, 35% for weight."
5.0,I looove the deep green color. I ordered a large and Medium as I am 5'7 and generally wear anywhere from a 6-10 but the medium fit well. (Gave the other away as a gift) the material is a little more forgiving and I had to really iron the wrinks out. Overall super pleases with my order MissMay did not disappoint!
5.0,This dress right here is so cute. I received so many compliments when I wore it to church. And it do have pockets
5.0,I love this nightgown.  It is very comfortable and feminine.  The white color is not too see-through-able.  It did not shrink at all after several washings.  It is cool enough to wear in the summertime.  I am extremely happy with this purchase.
5.0,Bought this as a Christmas gift. A bathrobe was on my nephews' wish list. They LOVED it! Nuff said!
5.0,"I absolutely love this hoodie! I already own it in purple, blue and black! I am a medium, but ordered it in large in case I want to wear something under it & have a comfy, casual look. If they had it in navy blue, I’d purchase it too! And an absolutely great value! You won’t be sorry if you purchase!"
5.0,"Perfect belt for dresses or long shirts. The belt turns a simple, casual dress to an elegant dress. I feel overdressed when I put it in.<br /><br />I also wear it with my pants and jeans."
5.0,Very nice fabric and stitching. Fits well and is comfortable.
5.0,"I love this dress,light and airy.  I am a big chested woman and I ordered the extra extra large.  bit perfectly."
5.0,PERFECT! This was a gift and LOVED!
5.0,Great book to beging with. great discussions are all over the book. for me it is great source of self study
5.0,Love this outfit. In the summer heat it is light and comfortable for my 2 year old and she gets so many compliments on how cute she looks!
5.0,"Good shooting glasses for us old folks. WTF is ""sheerness"" ?"
5.0,"This oversized turtleneck sweater dress is super snuggly and cozy, perfect for winter. Because of the shapeless design, it looks best with leggings or something else with a narrow profile, unless you want to look like a blob, which is also totally fine (winter is a great time to be a shapeless blob—I certainly do it). I took a few photos from different angles so you could get an idea. Nice quality materials and construction, and I’m loving the pockets, whether for warmth or for storing things."
5.0,My step daughter loves this tutu just as cute as the picture and fits perfect
5.0,great color just as expected.
5.0,Great product and easy to clean.
5.0,Pendant was great engraving was a really tiny and chain was kinked up I had to spend about 45 mins to get it straightened out but over all very nice
5.0,The watch is everything I expected. Great deal also.
5.0,"Great quality, fits as expected. The fabric is soft and feels like a thicker t-shirt. Haven't worn it out yet, but I will do so feeling confident that I won't get sunburned through the top."
5.0,Very soft and not see through. I’m A first time buyer of this product and I will definitely purchase again . The quality is there and so far I don’t see nothing wrong with these leggings
5.0,my daughter love them!
5.0,"These sunglasses are really nice! They look much more expensive than they are.<br />I have a hard time finding a good fit for my face when it comes to sunglasses, but these are a good size for me. I love the black chunky frames. They look like a softer, rounder cat eye frame. They are very sturdy and the sun protection/darkness is really good. I am quite happy with this purchase and I definitely recommend these."
5.0,"Love the purse, but had to spray the inside--had that &#34;China&#34; odor."
5.0,I wear these shoes all the time! They go with everything!
5.0,Beautiful.  Came with no instructions.  It took me a while to figure it out.
5.0,"Lovely materialand fit, very nice for the price."
5.0,"Dorky? Yes. Convenient and cost effective? Yes. They work great. End of story. ""A person wears these and you know they're not afraid of anything""."
5.0,"My 5 year old wanted to be lighthead for Halloween, so I purchased this costume. I bought him a size small and it looked big unboxing it but once he tried it on, it fit him perfectly. We are happy with our purchase."
5.0,"Not sure about the other reviews and where they're coming from but my top arrived at my apartment in a mere 3 days from Hong Kong. Was expecting to have to return it because of some mediocre reviews but no, I LOVE IT!<br /><br />I got a medium and am 5&#34;4 and slightly chubby with slightly broad shoulders, no big chest and was pleasantly surprised when the top looked just like the picture when I put it on. Loose as advertised, but not overly so. My boyfriend commented it was cute. The length is just right but the 'weaving' of the black material is just slightly transparent so you must wear it with leggings/tights/etc. It would look fantastic with skinny jeans or something of the sort too! I just think it's very cute and easy to throw on.<br /><br />Comes with a slight smell of fabric dye or something of the sort but will go away in the first wash. Can't comment about shrinking because I haven't washed it yet."
5.0,[[VIDEOID:50abbac0dfde9e2e346d3e59f888341b]] These shirts are cool because the really absorb the sweat. They look nice on my husband too
5.0,Great product nice glasses
5.0,Good value-for-money
5.0,Only one phrase: &#34;I love them...&#34;
5.0,I love these. You can leave them on inside and still see without falling over things because they are too dark. But if you look in the mirror you can see that they are indeed dark and provide the UVB and UVA protection that you need for the sun. Before I had to remove my sunglasses immediately or I couldn't see anything. Also love the bifocal part; I can read while shopping and again no need to remove in the grocery store. And finally the fit is fabulous and as is the way they look. My old sunglasses while they protected my eyes interfered with driving from the distortion in the lenses.
5.0,Bought for my elderly mother with shoulder issues. She said they are comfortable and just what she needs. Sized just right.
5.0,Looks great!! Well worth the money.
5.0,Thank you it Finally arrived And it's beautiful
5.0,Omg! Such a cute faux shearling hat. Go buy it!
5.0,"I love these bags. They fit my wallet, my phone, and miscellaneous stuff. So great."
5.0,My grandson loved these!  His mother said they fit well.
5.0,6 inch inseam means that these are shorter shorts and look great!  Not she sloppy shants that many men wear nowadays. Fine Polo quality.
5.0,super cute and major comfort.
5.0,Beautiful dress best purchase I made this month.
5.0,Great kids shoe for my 3.5 yo...
5.0,Fits perfectly. This was a gift for my 16yr old son and he absolutely loves it!!
5.0,Pro quality at an amazing price
5.0,This is a gift and it arrived on time. It was well packaged. The earrings are pretty not disappointed in the purchase.
5.0,I bought it for my daughter as a gift and it came right on time. She is very happy with it and she is not easy to please. It would be good to send the certificate of authenticity with the product.
5.0,Great summer dress! Cool and comfortable!!
5.0,"Fit as expected, liked the color and style."
5.0,This hat was very comfortable right out of the bag.
5.0,Great key chain!(:
5.0,"Pros: Nice lenses with no distortion or blur, nice leather case, really good looking, comfortable<br /><br />Cons: not the sturdiest glasses<br /><br />Bottom Line: Really nice rimless reading glasses for the price. The anti-glare coating works well without tint. I like these quite a bit and will be buying another pair."
5.0,I like the fit and the style.  Good quality!!!
5.0,"This tie was the best Amazon deal I've ever scored and perfect for my Harry Potter costume! I'm no tie expert, but it doesn't look cheap..it also seems versatile enough to be worn outside of cosplaying.<br /><br />Best. purchase. ever!"
5.0,I love this bracelet. It was exactly what I was looking for. Quality of the beads is excellent and the string it thick. Perfect because I have a toddler who likes to pull on them.
5.0,"The material is light and airy. It's incredibly comfortable and it doesn't move all day. While sitting to work for most of the day, it's nice to have a pair of pants that look professional and feel like pjs."
5.0,The blouse is so pretty. So many compliments on my night out. If you are conservative this blouse isnt for you it shows lots of boobs<br />I love the style and material. ❤🔥
5.0,Great watch arrived early 👌
5.0,Socks are comfortable and fit perfectly
5.0,This are very nice sandals. I love the colors.
5.0,"The shirt isnt like a cotton material? Its a little thin and shiny but the person it was intended for loves it. 4'10 , 70# and size medium was perfect. It was a little delayed but it came shortly after the date .( It wasnt weeks late,just a few days)"
5.0,A perfect pair of shades that blends easy with my skin tone and structure; not right or loose fitting either.
5.0,I bought some to wear as an undershirt. Primarily to block the Sun but still breathable in 100 degree weather. Longevity is still a question as they were just bought. Very comfortable and lightweight. Fit is spot on for my stature.
5.0,Bought this for myself. I was very pleased. It was beautiful and everything the description said it would be.
5.0,Great looking watch. Very light and comfortable. Get many compliments!!!
5.0,"Just what I was looking for! Simple, classic hoop earrings!"
5.0,Soooo flattering and comfortable! I have three pairs! I even wear with a tunic and sandals and the look great!
5.0,"Love this dress!! Sizes runs small, but good quality. Had a little trouble with zipper but after a while it became easier to zip."
5.0,"Bought these for a river raft trip. Didn't want to wear just bathing suit bottom and I didn't want to wear shorts - thought they would be too baggy in the water, so I got these. They were perfect. Good length, like shorts, but fit snug, like bike shorts. Glad I got them. I bought size large. I'm 5'7"" and around 175+/-."
5.0,Love this necklace! Leather is pliable and the snaps are strong. I also ordered one in white.
5.0,I use one all the time I like the variety
5.0,"I love these!!!! They are a steal when compared to the expensive backpacking specific bras. They are mesh, breathable and quick drying just like they pricey backpacking bras. I actually prefer this style, too! So comfy! They are not really sports bras as they don't have much support for running or other bouncy activities, but perfect for walking and hiking."
5.0,this product is easy to clean and no need to wash.
5.0,Much prettier than I expected. They look so delicate and lovely on. Gorgeous turquoise color. I love that they don't slide out of my ears like other threader earrings can because of the hook piece in the middle even though they are a tad heavier than some.
5.0,I have a neuropathy issue that has not been diagnosed fully yet. Z can't take relief meds as they might interfere with accurate diagnosis. These have proven to be be a God send in the mean time. I'd love to be an endorser and be compensated in their shoes and slippers!
5.0,"This is a pretty nice bag.  It is not cheap.  The strap is not detachable, so you don't have much flexibility there.  The zipper for the second pocket is inside the big pocket.  The bag is flat, meaning the it does not extend.  It fits a smaller tablet.  It is a good buy, if you just want a purse to bring to a stadium game.  If you want to use it for storage, I would pass."
5.0,"My wife bought this for me and I love it. It is awesome. Yes there was a smell for a little while but that was not a big deal where it is not under my nose all the time but in my pocket. It does fit in the front pocket as well as in the back pocket. I do not over stuff with credit cards but have all the slots full and even business cards tucked in the hidden inside slots under both sides and it is still not too full to close. As to the not being able to flatten it out issue that someone else had, yes it does not flatten all the way flat because it is designed that way to help keep closed naturally and it does not hurt the functionality of the wallet in the least but instead adds to it.<br />It has 4 credit card slots plus 2 hidden slots in sides that can be for extra 'less used' credit cards like I do or business cards which I also do, 1 Picture ID/Drivers license slot, Bill fold with separation in middle and separate Zippered fold for receipts or checks or loose change or something you need to secure what ever that may be. Cards and License are easy enough to take in and out but not to loose either so they don't<br /> just fall out (and they will loosen up some with use for those who have any issue with snugness). Of all of the wallets that I have ever had so far THIS ONE IS MY FAVORITE. NICE WALLET! I am glad my wife took her time to look at them all and chose this one. Price is right @ $9.99 (though I asked her not to spend more than $4 on a wallet for me, but I am glad she did in this case) and it has all I need. Very functional and even has the RFID block. She bought me the brown color one and the leather is nice quality though some may not like it because of variation in color from what the pictures show on amazon but I think it is better in person than the pictures show, the pictures make it look slick and shiny but it is actually more of a dull/flat deep/rich brown nice leather color with natural leathery soft yet tough/smoothness to the touch and ability to get natural scuffings/scratches which I prefer. It is a guys wallet, for guys who don't want to look like Petunias and who like genuine natural leather that doesn't look over processed or coated with plastic or whatever. I have been using this for about a month now and still think it is the best. GREAT Wallet Simpac."
5.0,Very comfortable and nice looking tshirt
5.0,Love it!! My favorite color is pink! Nice light weight! Fit perfect
5.0,"great clear bag for work.  hopefully, it last longer than my last one from another company that was more expensive.  The plastic is soft and it gives."
5.0,I wasn't sure if I'd like this or if my parents would wear them but they're perfect and fit inside any facemask.  We even purchased the smaller sizes for the kids and now they don't come home with wet face masks anymore.  Definitely more comfortable wearing a mask for longer periods of time.
5.0,"I like these earrings because the clasp is ""hidden"".  They are perfect for a small to medium sized child and I bought them for my Granddaughter.  I love the ""twist"" look, very nice."
5.0,Great shoes for my granddaughter.  I've bought several pairs of these shoes for her and they not only fit well but are very cute.  A bit pricey but worth the price.  Wear well and are comfortable.
5.0,"I paired this with fitted jeans, a navy slim fit sport coat, white pocket square, and all white Pharrell Adidas. I will say the shirt made the outfit. Walked into Starbucks on my way into work and was complemented on the shirt. It's linen, so break out the iron. Love the style and quality. Will definitely recommend. If you are ""slim fit"", go down 1 size. I usually wear medium, so I could have gone with the small for a fitted look. The medium still fits, just classic fit."
5.0,"Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my 15 year old, and she is going to love it! It is so cute!"
5.0,"I've been looking for a two-piece for a while and most haven't worked out. When I pulled this out of the package, I thought it was going to be another 0, but holy crudmuffins! When I put it on! It looks amazing!<br />It's a little small in the cup for me (38DD), but holds the ladies up, has an ADORABLE neckline and the high wasted bottoms are actually high wasted AND my but looks great! It's what I've been looking for!<br />Just add a floppy hat! I'm ready to go!"
5.0,"I got this as a gift for my father who rides bikes. It has small reflective strips and a warm inner lining. Great vest. Went with small for the size guide which seems to run a smidge big, but it is an outer layer so works well"
5.0,"They are very fitted, but very comfortable. I have a job that requires me to move fast and be able to bend and stretch. I love these pants because it moves with me and still manages to keep me looking professional ."
5.0,a great bargain.  very comfortable .  played a lot of tennis in these.  soft and light. wow what a deal..
5.0,"Beautiful dress!  Fits well, I'm a size 14 and ordered the extra large.  I love the feminine feel and length of this. The fabric is thin and soft, and it rests comfortably against the skin."
5.0,They can help with too much pressure on your nose.
5.0,"Great product, I like the colors. I use this to work out and keep the sweat off my face and it works very good. It's comfortable."
5.0,Had one of these when I was a kid in the 80s Very similar (though I think this is slightly larger). Very happy.
5.0,I love these. I was super excited that my husband bought them for me. I only wish I had a choice of different sizes because I have a rather small wrist.
5.0,"Super cute, fits well"
5.0,Fabulous. Now I have two - it's that great.  Coach currently doesn't make this embossed model.
5.0,THIS IS ADORABLE AND MY GRANDAUGHTER LOVED IT.  THE COLORS ARE BRIGHT COLORFUL.
5.0,"Fits nice, a little thinner then i expected but its a good jacket"
5.0,"I love this dress, I just need to wear a bra and couldn't figure that out before our event so I returned it.  I may be purchasing again when I find a solution."
5.0,"These are exactly what I was looking for.  I was wearing sunglasses over my prescription glasses when driving until I remembered these exist. Unfortunately I left them in my pocket and washed them. Needless to say they did not hold up well. I didn’t hesitate to buy a replacement. As long as you don’t put them in the washer, you’ll love them."
5.0,"Super comodas,me encantaron...🤩🤩🤩 buena calidad."
5.0,Look just like the picture...
5.0,"It runs a bit small, but that is perfect for me. The arms are long and so is the torso. Beautiful color."
5.0,Very Nice watch band. Pretty and goes well with my watch. Easy to install. I've gotten lots of compliments. The chains are kind of annoying but otherwise a great buy. Would purchase in gold except for the chains.
5.0,bought for my mother who has moved into a nursing home easy off and on- good quality- washable-
5.0,"I bought this for my son for Christmas, I dont know yet how it fits him or the length, however, I looked at the shirt and it seems ok.....another t shirt....ya know"

5.0,My new favorite dress. I received so many compliments when I wore this dress. I want to order them all! The fit was perfect and very flattering.

5.0,gave as a gift to a teenager with size 4 feet. They don't have a true heel so they worked as knee socks which was perfect!

5.0,Better quality than expected for the price. The small fits easily over my size large Bilt riding jacket.
5.0,Great for keeping track.
5.0,My daughter loves her new robe and loves how she can dress up her babies to match her. Very fun design and vibrant colors! The material is very soft. It’s a little big for her but still works and hopefully will be used longer.
5.0,Fantastic septum rings. Perfect fit.
5.0,It was purrfect  for my cat loving friend.  Light weight for spring. Great for that last minute or surprise gift.
5.0,soft - over the head shoulder hold can be used around the waist it said- has enough zipper pockets and other pockets I purchased the black.
5.0,Super functional. Zippers seem a bit low quality but they are working perfectly so far.
5.0,My daughter likes it. Better than the tops that the school issued. It has stretch to it and length is good. No worries about it becoming untucked. I ordered up. Shes between sizes so i went with the small and its perfect.
5.0,These have held up well over time.
5.0,"Sensual, comfortable recommend this product will make his wife melt when I see it."

5.0,I wanted a decent looking Venetian Style Mask. It fits my nose and eyes well enough and is comfortable. The mask has some nice detail and seems durable. This was a purchase worth the $10.19 I paid for. I'll probably use this for many years to come.
5.0,a bit on the pricey side .. yet i am always cold .. so it is worth it
5.0,Beautiful fit and feel.

You look through the mouth/nostrils to see. I find it fairly easy to breath with is on my head. The mask fits my husband, son, and I very easily and comfortably. The shipping on this was super fast, it came in a compacted box but unfolded nicely and looks great! I can't wait to have so much more fun with this! I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
5.0,"Beautiful.  Looks just like the picture. Beware though, it is completely transparent in most places. You will have to wear a shirt/cami under it. Beautiful shirt though.  Cheap? Yes. But I am happy with it for the price."

5.0,This dress fit perfectly & was of great quality. I got a ton of compliments on this dress.
5.0,"I read every review on this dress/tunic prior to ordering.  I noticed that a lot of comments stated that it was &#34;big&#34;.  I am 5'4&#34;, 169 pounds and wear a 34 DD bra and since I prefer something more fitted, I ordered a medium and it fit absolutely perfect!  Probably a little short because of it's uneven hem to be a dress so I wear it with leggings and boots.  I also noticed that there were multiple complaints about the garment being too tight in the arms but I did not experience that problem even when sizing down.<br />This tunic/dress is absolutely perfect for winter and for festive wear!<br />Can't forget to thank the seller for the fast shipping as well!!"
5.0,"The jacket was to small for my wife.  We gave it to our daughter.  We ordered a large but it fit like a medium.  That being said, the quality and styling were spot on.  It is a very beautiful jacket.  I may order a larger size for my wife.  Very traditional looking.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount so that I woud post an honest review."
5.0,My British Witt loves her new purse. Well made great design.
5.0,gave them to granddaughters for their rooms
5.0,comfy pjs. Soft. Pretty color. Fun to lounge around in. Fits well with the elastic waste. Length was perfect fit.
5.0,Very simple and accurate time piece.
5.0,"Cute shirt, good quality and fit well. However shirt may run on the smaller side for most so it's probably best to order a size up."
5.0,Discreta y queda muy bien.
5.0,This is a beautiful keychain. It was clear to read and had a really nice quality feel. I wish I had taken a picture before I gave it to my sister for her graduation so I could add it here. The message is what really makes it meaningful but the overall look and feel was gorgeous.
5.0,"I bought this outfit pretty much for the same reason everyone else did, the Texas Renaissance Festival! I got the dress very quickly and was immediately surprised with the quality. I was expecting materials that were cheap enough to be see-through and seams that may rip when pulling the corset tighter, however, neither of those things happened! The Brick Red color was a perfect choice, although I may get the lighter green one next year since the dress was such a hit. I did see one other girl with the same color, but I expected that. I’m 5’2 and ended up cutting the white dress 5inches to fall a little higher than my combat boots. This was definitely the right choice because it was a little muddy and the outer b-red layer drug through the dirt a bit. The dress also did really well in the washer, however I didn’t dry the outer layer, based on my own fears. Anyway, GET THE OUTFIT!! You won’t regret it, especially for the price!"
5.0,The minion sleepers are just as expected...perfect fit and well made!
5.0,My fiancee love's this necklace. Part of his dragon collection.
5.0,"This dress is just gorgeous. I ordered a small, but I ended up returning and getting an extra small- I'm 5'4, 120 lbs and 34D and the extra small fits perfectly!! I got a petticoat to wear under it and it's just amazing on."
5.0,The colors are so vibrant and beautiful. I can't wait to give to my mom
5.0,love it! it looks very nice on me

5.0,"I bought these for my wife. She loves them, and so do I. Great color, not too shiny and flashy. The shape is what is most interested, as it should be. Great size, really small but crisp lines and high quality. Worth the price!"

5.0,"I absolutely love these earrings. They perfectly match a necklace I was given. Dainty, shimmer and simple. Highly recommend."
5.0,"For the price, these are incredible.  I am ordering a second pair before these disappear (and i'd be ordering several extras had I not just recently acquired several Oakley and Arnett pairs).  These fit great, look nice and feel/look a lot better than a $12 pair of glasses.<br /><br />The polarization is very nice on these, and helps a lot for my fishing. Overall, very very good."
5.0,Exact what I was looking for.
5.0,Without a doubt this is the best polishing cloth around! It cleans well and lasts much longer than others I've had. Shipped quickly and arrived on schedule.
5.0,For the price this is super cute. I have actually snagged it pretty hard on a few things and thought right away it would break but it didnt.Worth every penny
5.0,Most versatile dress - elegant too

5.0,"I absolutely adore this wallet! It fits everything that i need, and is extremely cute. All of my friends keep asking where i got it from."
5.0,My grandaughters LOVED these very plush robes. Great color and quality and fit. Definately recommend them to buy for your little darlings
5.0,Great product but mine ran a little smaller than says.

5.0,I just wish they had a brighter colors. Fit perfectly.

5.0,Just nice fit for lounging!  And outside!!
5.0,"This is one of the classic design and color that everyone should have in their swimsuit repertoire.  Even though it's a bit on the smaller size, but overall a great buy."
5.0,"I love it!!! Super cute, light weight and so comfy. It was a bit loose around the ribs but once I added a belt to it the dress fit perfectly. I'm 5'6&#34; with 38C bra size so I order the size large and it was the right size. The dress is a bit short on the bottom as it doesn't hit the ground so my feet show but that's not a huge issue though I would prefer the dress to hit just above the ground. The price is great! I'm planning on getting another color. My fianc&eacute; loves the dress on me."
5.0,"The side ruffles didn’t make me look bulkier around the hips, and added a unique fluttery style I enjoy.  I got the black with red one.  It’s nice with a fitted black tank top, for example.  Light satin material.  A fun and very different different looking inexpensive skirt for summer, and the length and pattern I got will work in fall too."
5.0,Great color.<br />Great misty spray nozzle<br />Chalk stickers<br />Very pleased
5.0,Ordered medium for my grandson and it fit perfectly.  Machine wash and dryed without one bit of shrinkage.
5.0,"Love it! Great for the gym, soccer, and open water swims! My ring finger is a 7 and I prefer the large size.  It doesn't slip or move around and its not as tight as the medium.  I tend to swell when working out so the medium gets really tight."
5.0,They fit great and are so soft
5.0,"Love this wallet. It's slim, light weight, washable, durable and can have in your back pocket when your driving. long distances."
5.0,"Well worth the money, and product is as good (if not better than) as advertised!"
5.0,"The boots are really easy to get on and off.  My 16-month old is able to walk as though she were wearing sneakers and she really seems to like them!<br /><br />After the first winter storm of the year, I am compelled to update my review and give these boots 5-stars!! My daughter has spent a lot of time playing in the snow. (And it’s the wet, heavy kind.) I was surprised that the boots kept her feet dry and warm.  (Keep in mind she’s only spending 30-60 minutes outside at a time and temps have been in the upper 20s to low 30s but nonetheless they have worked out well for us.)"
5.0,Material is great and fits as expected! Ordered a small. It is not lined and no pockets.
5.0,Worked really well to hold bottom of curtain panels.  Did exactly what I needed them to do.
5.0,"Super soft and comfy. Great fit and stylish, too. I got compliments from day one.<br /><br />I don’t know that these are “winter” pants if you live above the mid south cause I’m definitely wearing them in the 70s here in KY."
5.0,Sarah Silks is our Daughters favorite!  It is a Waldorf kids fav!
5.0,Great well made masks !

5.0,Amazing...my daughter loves....
5.0,Wow! Best leggings I have ever owned!  I based my decision to buy on the reviews I read because im always scared to order clothing online but im going to order one in every color. They are so comfortable and the fabric is very good quality.  If you are unsure I would say just buy them its so worth it.
5.0,"I love this cardigan! The material wasn't as soft as I hoped, but it's still great. Back part goes below my butt and the sleeves goes down to the mid part of my hand."
5.0,This ring is great! The blue inner part is awesome and smooth. The ring is actually pretty heavy but not too heavy. It is a perfect wedding band.
5.0,Just got to wear them during my Hawaii n vacation and I love them. Very flattering
5.0,"As described & easy to slip on and off. Really love the high quality soles. I wear them outside ALL THE TIME. In the picture they look big, but I knew they would be b/c I am a size 7 in women's shoes and these are men's sizes. The picture of the soles are AFTER I already wore them outside. They arrived brand new."
5.0,Bought the white one with the pink holes. Love it! Soft and pliable. Very comfy.

5.0,very nice for work and going out on a date

5.0,"I usually order petite, but then length on this item  was perfect. Slightly longer than petite, but works well."
5.0,I embellished it and wore to the office ugly Christmas attire party
5.0,These are my favorite grocery bags ever. I constantly get compliments on how cute they are. They are extremely durable as well. I have put really heavy and sharper edge items in these bags and somehow they dont rip and are sturdy. I recommend them to everyone I know.
5.0,Amazing it is 2 for the price of one.
5.0,It’s just so so cute & versatile. Dress it up or down. Just watch out when you are reaching for more dip :). The sleeves do drape as pictured.

5.0,"Item is exactly as described. Arrives in a timely manner, well packaged. Love the saying on it. Would make a great gift. Do recommend."
5.0,Fast delivery and very nice!
5.0,"Such a great purchase at a great price. The only thing I'd change would be adding another layer of ""tulle"" at the skirt, it's a little too see through for my liking."
5.0,This dress is really really cute! I might buy in other colors. I am 5'6 and 130 pounds and the medium was perfect.
5.0,"Worked well for my application- I had my cartilage pierced 22 gauge or so, but I want my helix to heal with a 20 gauge hoop instead. I have had good experience in the past with this company, and so has my mom. In my other ear I have a 16 gauge hoop and I have had no problems. I have had it for almost a year an no issues or irritation has occurred... and I have eczema and sensitive skin."
5.0,I like the feel of the material  and how it fits.
5.0,"Very comfortable.  These socks are labeled “L” and “R”, which isn’t shown in the photos.  They are the only socks I’ll wear.  Glad I found them here!"
5.0,I ordered a 3xl and it fits like a large witch is perfect for me because I order for my daughter who is a large and I ordered a 3xl by mistake but fits her perfectly and she loves it
5.0,This is going to be a perfect gift for my 82 year old veteran grandpa.:) color is beautiful and lettering is not blurred like other reviews. Im very happy with this mask.
5.0,What can I say? The kids like stance socks.
5.0,Bought this for football game and it works just fine love it
5.0,My husband loves his hat and shirt.
5.0,A very pretty dress. I bought a size bigger because I knew I would wash it and shrink it in the dryer. It dried well and now is smaller but will be more fitted. This dress is unique. I do think I would call it ivory instead of white. I may by the black one.
5.0,"The buttons came quickly (that was helpful), and my tailor is installing them and also refurbishing the coat as I write (I bought the Harris Tweed jacket 35 years ago, and it remains one of my favorites for trips to colder climates). These buttons were dark brown, but since the coat is a purplish-charcoal, the ensemble works just fine. And since the coat is 2-button, with 3-button sleeves, I have a spares if I should lose one (which is what prompted replacement)."
5.0,This Yorkie looks just like my fur baby Ducky!  Love wearing it♥
5.0,Like the fit and keeps feer warm
5.0,VERY CUTE  Quality is very good.
5.0,I bought these earrings for myself bc my ears are double pierced. They are perfect to wear at the top & loops at the bottom & 3 different looks to switch out. Good quality.

5.0,Great product. Very happy with purchase.
5.0,This was a hit for the Halloween party. Tad see through in waist. Fit was as described
5.0,Very comfortable and not constricting.
5.0,I plan on ordering more! They fit my wrist great and the magnetic clip is SOSOSOSOSOSO much easier than a clasp. I recommend to all of my mommas but even if you aren't these are great accessories!
5.0,Purchased one in gray and one in red. the spacing between the vertical lines are not the same between the two colors. I prefer a wider spacing so the gray one is my favorite.
5.0,Ordered blue got black fit excellent just not the right color
5.0,Very elegant clutch for evening wear.
5.0,"a gift for my husband and a great fit.  he loves the understated color and design and gets lots of compliments.  It is well made, machine washable and if you do a short fluff dryer cycle, there is no need to iron it.  He says it's comfortable and intends to buy some more on his own.  I'll likely give him another as a gift!"
5.0,Very nice but heavier.
5.0,Really nice and you can't go wrong with stainless steel. No color changes or ring around the neck. Sturdy and well worth it!
5.0,They are nice glasses. I believe they are sized more for men.
5.0,"I received this jacket as a gift for my 10th birthday and I love it! It is a medium size; unfortunately size small and extra small were out of stock. It isn't 100% waterproof, but it is very rain resistant. The one I got is a little big, but you easily shorten it. hanging by the zipper is a drawstring for the hood and at the bottom are two large pockets. Overall, this jacket is very realistic and good quality, and totally worth the money. I highly recommend it!"
5.0,It rolls at little but it’s perfect
5.0,Pretty bracelet and a good cause<br />Will make a beautiful gist as well😊
5.0,So light and comfortable- I took the laces out and wow they popped. Outstanding value for money
5.0,rolltide
5.0,So far this socks are great. They are the perfect thickness but keep your feet cool as well. They are also very comfortable no matter which shoes I have on. I am planning to buy another set.
5.0,Unique look. Lightweight and Breathable. Great for any pilot style chronograph watch.
5.0,Clasps seem strong. Great for the price-
5.0,Love this shirt not as breathable as I expected. It is like a good T-shirt over most of it. The black breaths a bit but fits well
5.0,MY MOM LOVE'S IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0,"Awesome, stay put, thick enough, not see through...very happy"

5.0,I ordered this dress from my fiance Jeff's account.  I absolutely love this dress!!!!!!!!!! I ordered one in a Medium and it was to large so ordered this one in a small and it fits perfectly!! The top is stretchy and comfy and the bottom is not so it can be worn dressed up with heels or dressed down with sandals.  I have now ordered two more in different patterns and can't wait to get them in.  The pockets on the side are perfect and not bulky you don't even know they are there.  Great buy I recommend!!!!

5.0,Para andar cómoda en la casa o para salir al mercado
5.0,Very nice set. And looks cool
5.0,Good over the glasses fit
5.0,very easy to use works well
5.0,"I've been looking for a bra like this for a long time!  It's the perfect &#34;almost&#34; bra to wear under anything where you want a little bit of support.  I'm a slim lady with natural DD breasts and most half camis (this isn't really a bra) don't have a wide enough portion to cover me.  This one does the trick!  I removed the padding because it gave me a weird shape, and now the fit is almost perfect."
5.0,Beautiful solid necklace for that special ballerina!
5.0,"I loved this headband.  It's for me but I had a tester try it on first, see photo."
5.0,"I tend to wear medium/large and the large in this was definitely too big.  I am 5'5'' 160lbs, pear shaped. small bust."
5.0,I thought I was buying a cedar shoe stretcher. What I received was cedar wood shoe shaper. They are made of high quality materials and I like them very much. The cedar makes my work shoes smell great!
5.0,Might be my fave! Just love the way this bracelet looks and feels!
5.0,"I wish I could wear this every day of the year! Well, I could but people might think I'm a bit loony haha! Nobody can stop me from wearing it around my house though!!<br />Its so long and fluffy and just adorable. Exactly what I was looking for in a tail to be a black cat for Halloween!! I love the length, I'm almost 5'3&#34; and it almost touches the ground when i'm wearing it.  The two loops at the base of the tail keep it secure and doesn't look like all those cheap cat/animal tails."
5.0,Great comfy T-shirt dress can be dressed up or down. Great for travel. Soft cotton fabric. Bought more in other colours💙🖤🧡
5.0,Me agrada que queda perfectamente.
5.0,Good quality product and a nice selection. Progressive lenses take some getting used to and they just weren’t for me. Nothing wrong with the glasses just a personal preference.

5.0,The glasses are great it's like one size fits all.
5.0,"The first pair of AKASO Men's Alkai Sport Polarized Sunglasses we received were warped, we contacted the seller & they quickly sent us another pair. The seller kept us posted on the replacement. The second pair was perfect, we ordered the white frame pair. These sunglasses are awesome! The lenses cut out glare but yet give a bright & clear view. Will definitely recommend."
5.0,Bag is awesome to travel
5.0,Good color and durable.
5.0,"It’s really well made and the material is heavier than some other bee clothing I previously bought, and yet, it still breathes. I got the suit to have an extra so I could teach bees as part of a homeschool curriculum. The suit fits me and it also worked fine for my 12 year old student. Will be buying another."
5.0,I like the fact I can wear over my reading glasses!!!
5.0,The blouse fot well when tried and the color and fit was as expected. Much better than what I expected
5.0,"Truly waterproof!  They run a bit large, but these will definitely keep you dry.  The reflective strips are great and makes me more visible when riding my bike at night."
5.0,"I love this dress... I love Zattcas! This was my first dress I bought from them years ago. Since then I have purchased two more. They are my go-to for events... I wear them all the time! They fit so nice, are comfortable and beautiful! I was 5 months pregnant in this photo but have worn many times not pregnant and you just get a bit more length.<br /><br />** I will say after a few years and quite a few washes, this dress does have some pilling all over it. It is still very much worth the price."
5.0,Beautiful suit.  I am 5 ft 4&#34; and weigh 125 lbs.  I ordered a size 8 and it fits perfectly.  I have a cesarean scar on my lower abdomen that sometimes show through on form fitting suits.  The draped front on this suit hides it completely.
5.0,First of all I was surprised at the color and quality of this sweatshirt. I get complements on the color every time I wear it. So glad I ordered this.
5.0,Love them!  They wash up nice as well and keep their shape!
5.0,"Bought this as a gift for my granddaughter,i am pretty sure she will love."

5.0,"Very flattering, good quality and should travel well."
5.0,Very good for the price. Clear optics. Good for driving. No scratches like store bought glasses for the same price.
5.0,"Really high quality leggings. I wanted to wait until I had worn them a few months until I left a review. I wear these all the time!! They are so comfortable and have a great, slimming waistband that doesn't dig into my floof when I sit down or when I am feeling a little heavier. They are my go to pants as soon as they come out of the wash. I will definitely be getting another pair in the near future."
5.0,"These are sleek and cose to your head, I can wear them but my 10 year old daughter wears them and they fit her. Very cute but practical with the polarized lenses."
5.0,I loved these shoulder pads so much I ordered a second pair. They’re the perfect size!  Love them!
5.0,Very good quality hat. Colors are really nice. Looks like the sellers image. Very satisfied.
5.0,"i'm 6'2&#34; 191 lbs - active often and was looking for a tight fit for an undershirt, specifically allowing my undershirt to show when i wear a sweater (so like neck high) - guys, for $10 you gotta be kidding me!! these are great! not only was the fit and collar right where i wanted to be, guys these are longer than your average!!! so you tall guys with those shirts that just never seem to be long enough get these!!<br /><br />only thing that scares me is the quality - it seems as tho when i wash it, after a while it may stretch and not be as form fitting.<br /><br />but for $10 and getting 6 shirts you really can't go wrong."
5.0,"I bought the larger size and was still surprised that it seemed kinda small. But honestly it has been really comfortable to clip on my belt loop compared to every other key management device ive used. This is strong, simple and will probably be the last carbabiner you will ever have to buy, granted you arent prone to losing things. Also taking account for its fairly small size, people with sausage fingers might have a tough time with this."
5.0,"Great fit, style and function.  I can read at the beach or by the pool now."
5.0,"Best retainer ever!! It is so discreet, I have to make sure it hasn't fallen out from time to time! It is also very durable, much better than other retainers I've had."

5.0,Excellent price very good quality. No complain very satisfied.
5.0,Now everybody in the family has one
5.0,"Good comfortable fit, well constructed, easy on and off, both full glove and mitten.  I love the mitten &#34;holder&#34; to keep them intact.  They are  warm and good looking to boot."

5.0,"Most comfortable sandals I ever owned. Yes they look a little old fashioned, but when I have a lot of walking to do, who cares."
5.0,"This is a very beautiful top on.  I needed to order up 1 size to give me more length.  I also gut the v neck stitch out. Once I cut that out I added a black cami and it fit perfect. The v neck was stitched too high for larger breasts. I wore this with black jeans as a casual look and once with business slacks for a work event and I received so many complements.  It runs a little short, hits right at your hips.  Well made and looks beautiful - a must have for your  winter wardrobe."
5.0,A little long but fit really well. Material was great!
5.0,🤵

5.0,A lifesaver!!
5.0,I was thrilled to receive these earrings. I love anything camera. These are just the right size for me and are quite beautiful. The only thing I might change is to have one pair a black camera to make them a little different. They look very similar but I will gladly wear either pair.
5.0,I wore this once and got it today. I've been getting compliments. The chain is made of durable material. Heavy not lightweight.
5.0,Loved it very beautiful and just what i was looking for very dainty.
5.0,Love these glasses. Large and stylish. Very cool.
5.0,"I really like these. They keep my shirt tucked in all day, so there's no more need for re-tucking or worrying that my shirttails are hanging out. On the day I started wearing them, several coworkers complimented me on my outfit (which I've worn before), saying that I looked sharp. They really make a difference. As a bonus, they also keep your socks up.<br /><br />I had a problem with one of the clips losing its grip, but when I reached out to Buttons & Pleats they immediately sent me a replacement pair. Overall, great customer service and useful product."
5.0,"My husband loved these, wears them often! A Christmas gift!"
5.0,loved it so cute. the bf went gaga over it I'm a size 40 bust that equals a 38 DD and fit me great I'll up not too revealing but enough for a geat tease loved the top print. I posted few picture so you can see how it fit I think snug to my curves well I'm at 35-inch waist  and was happy both it and thong fit so well

5.0,Cute little dress.
5.0,"As mentioned by other reviewers, the hair on this mask sheds.  What they failed to mention is that it also has fleas and smells like the primate cage at a 3rd world zoo.  Very realistic."

5.0,Beautiful design. Love the ring. Sizing is perfect
5.0,&#34;I love these and want to order more colors. At last a a truly round toe shoe bed that doesn't squish my toes together. Very comfortable and super cute! True to US sizing.&#34;

5.0,Excellent product for the right price.
5.0,"Love the length, very flattering. Comfy sweater, not too hot or bulky. Nice fabric. Good purchase"
5.0,Absolutely love it! It is small but that is what I was looking for my piercing. Fits perfect!  The only thing that I had issues with was the first time I tried to take the all off it was super hard but haven't had any issues since!
5.0,I love this necklace. I originally thought I'd use it for Fall but it's cute and light enough to wear now in summer. I like the multiple strands of hearts that hang down very nicely. There are multiple strands so you have to kind of sort them a bit if you don't store it hanging but it's worth it. It dresses up any outfit and in summer goes perfect with any sort of neckline or top and has that &#34;bohemian&#34; feel to it and when it's on you can pair it with some bangles and your jewelry accessorizing is complete.<br />I was given a discount on this item to review it but believe me I tell the truth about the items I review and I really like this one and recommend it.
5.0,This is one awesome ring.  It gets noticed.  My 3 sons and I all wear this ring as a promise to always be there for each other and remind us that we are not alone when we are miles apart.<br /><br />Solid ring.  Fast shipping and delivery (even having to go through customs).<br /><br />Dec 2017 - Over a year later and wearing it daily.  Looks and feels like the 1st day I put it on....  Awesome deal!
5.0,"I bought these because I like khakis. These are great. I am 6'2"" and 250. These are just the right length. The pants are nice in cool weather. They keep you warm. They stretch perfectly. Will buy again."

5.0,Adorable just as expected
5.0,Adorable and soft! Great quality and my ten year old loved it!
5.0,"Got these fast.  So far I am enjoying them a lot, at first the soles were a bit rough on the feet but after a few days of wear they are extremely comfortable now.  My previous sandals i also got on amazon, they were mizuno and were nice but didnt last long, the bottoms didnt have hard rubber just neoprene type material.  I ended up walking a hole in them after about 3 months or so of use.  These are very solid and have a good rubber sole on them.  I live in an area in TX where there is a river that is the local hang out/attraction so I will be getting a lot of use out of these.  I can also see them good for some hiking as well, they have great traction and are made for wet use so crossing streams etc. should not be any issue.  Any changes update will follow but as of right now extremely pleased!!"
5.0,My face is round and wide. This one is perfect Fit. Comfortable. Stylish. Always my favorite.
5.0,Love this bag! It is a bit bigger than I thought but holds everything I need. The quality is great and the service was good.

5.0,This dress is so comfy!  I got non-stop compliments. Best thing-dress has pockets!!!!
5.0,"I was looking for a pair of sunglasses for the beach. Last year I lost a pair of Maui Jim's to the ocean and didn't want to do that this year. I bought this and was pleasantly surprised. If you were questioning if you should get these, the question is yes!"
5.0,Works well.!
5.0,Nice designer necklace. Only thing can’t get wet or will tarnish quickly
5.0,"I loved this ear cuff. I thought it was perfect. Unfortunately my house burnt down a few days after they came in the mail, so i wasnt able to wear it out amywhere to see if they stay put, but as far as fashion goes, they are adorable."

It fits pretty much true to size - I chose a Small (am 5'1"" and 112 lbs) and it looks on me like pictured on model w/ just enough roominess so that I can wear a sweater or two light layers underneath. Perfect Autumn jacket. May get another color in it."

5.0,I purchased these for my 14 year old daughter who LOVES Doctor Who. They are nice and heavy and don't look cheap at all. She really likes them. I would recommend for anyone who wants to show their Doctor Who fandom off.
5.0,I love the fact that theyre are comfortable after a month and a half with them and don't really get dirty quick.
5.0,Nice belt. Works great with the multiple positions you get a perfect fit.
5.0,"Altho it was a bit crushed upon arrival, it bounced back into shape by the next day!  I have gotten so many compliments!  My hair is getting ruined by being in the hot sun all day (just moved to sunny CA)!  So need to keep it covered when outside. It keeps my head cool, as it is straw, while it is protecting it. Stays in when windy, as well.  I even rody my bike with it on yesterday.  Great buy!!"
5.0,"I live in a desert, and work in a kitchen.  Swamp ass is a real concern, so I figured I would give these bamboo boxers a try.  Yeah, good call.  Do they keep me from sweating?  No, of course not.  But everything stays where it's supposed to, nothing rides up and they definitely don't smell as bad as my old Jockeys.  They cool designs are just a bonus."

5.0,I was surprised with the quality. I am planning on buying more.
5.0,"My son-in-law works outside on diesel trucks. When it's cold this is VERY much needed - keeps him from being quite so cold!  That and thermal underwear save him -- even the few days each year that is truly cold in Houston, TX!!  Excellent price for this also."

5.0,"Buying swimsuits online is a little scary for me. I like to be able to try things on, but I decided to take a chance on this as it looked really cute.<br /><br />The result...This is my new favorite swim top!!!<br /><br />I love:<br />- It’s flattering. Extremely flattering. The top ties around the neck and the back so you have control on how tight you want it.<br />-The cups are sturdy and fit nicely without gaps. There is also a very small amount of padding which looks great.<br />-I love they are sold separately. My body requires two different sizes for swim suits.<br />-For reference, I’m a 34D and the medium fits PERFECT.<br /><br />There’s truly nothing I don’t love about this top. Highly recommended!"
5.0,"I've read several negative comments others have left and just want to say that this case is obviously more of an accessory, not something to protect your phone from breaking when dropped or to prevent water damage. If that's what you are looking for then cute/fun cases are not the way to go.  I absolutely love this phone case! Super cute and I get compliments on it almost daily!"

5.0,The watch is the BOMB!!!

5.0,Polka dot is the forever classic that is why I bought this dress. The fabric is thicker than I expected and  you can not see anything through the dress which is awesome. I would recommend this dress to everybody.
5.0,WORKS WELL. KEEPS SUN OFF

5.0,I bought this for a friend. It was very pretty. She hung it from her rearview mirror.
5.0,This really got me started on taking care of myself
5.0,I have extreme sensitive ears. These do not irritate me at all.  And I feel confident wearing all my diamond earrings knowing they are secure.  I bought some for each set and a back up just in case! Why did I wait so long to buy them.
5.0,"Great quality, perfect for fall."
5.0,A really nice belt for the price. Looks great.
5.0,Nice big bag. Love the color!
5.0,"Great fit, comfortable. Very cute!"
5.0,I usually wear a small but was afraid of a tight fit so bought a medium and was glad I went w/ it. This top is very nice and dressy. I was expecting it to be made out of 't-shirt' material but it's made out of a nice sooth slinky knit....and it even came w/ a little necklace. I love that the rhinestones are on both front and back. I would def buy it again and now I want one in all of the colors. Just wish it came in red and blue....(this top has gone up in price $2 though. :-()

5.0,"execelente, the size is what I expected, super comfortable, my daughter is happy ...."
5.0,"My mom has been wearing them for a week because she’s getting older and with winter, she needs good socks to keep her feet warm. So far the socks have been met with praise in keeping her feet warm and not smelling. The only (minor) gripe is that the colors aren’t that great, but it can be easily overlooked when the socks are this cheap."
5.0,"Loved this bag! Great buy and would definitely buy again. The “wet” compartment is perfect for bathing suits or gym clothes. The shoe compartment at the bottom even fits my boots. It’s the right size for a take a long bag - not too big but spacious enough for all you’re gonna need.<br /><br />Only thing is that I wish it had a long strap to carry it across the body.<br />But overall a durable, cute and super functional bag."
5.0,These work great to prevent injuries from running or speed walking they are also really cute!! Would recommend I received these in exchange for honest Review
5.0,"These were perfect for what I wanted.  I recommend using two straps per bag, one lengthwise and one widthwise.  Having two different colors makes my bag REALLY easy to spot on the luggage carousel.<br />Others have said that their straps are stolen by baggage handlers, but I think they just didn't tighten them enough. You want to adjust them so the buckles are under your bags' handles and pull them seriously tight."
5.0,renewed an old clock and was so good that I do not shoot it anymore
5.0,"Great price and quality, I was impressed!"
5.0,A very high quality bag that i use when I am on the road. The rain just rolled off the bag.
5.0,"Nice quality, perfect color!"
5.0,"Prettier that I expected! I was afraid these earring  may appear dark - with the photo shown, but they are bright silver with just a tad of the oxidized look in the detailing of the feather. Bright and shiny, they hang near my chin and show through my hair. So happy!"

5.0,"The shirt is good quality, the picture of the golden girls is good but it was larger than expected. So I’m using it as a sleep shirt"
5.0,"So far it's been a good, functional watch. It's also really fun to wear. Many complements such as ""Dude! That watch is FIRE"". I bought it because I thought it looked like a costume watch that I would wear somewhat ironically. It turned out to be much better than that. I'm very happy with it. I'm thinking about buying other variations. Bling is back."
5.0,"My daughter loves music and she plays the guitar.  In addition, she loves God and enjoys going to church.  This necklace is perfect for her.  It came earlier than expected.  The guitar is stainless steel and the leather cord is durable and a good material.  She loves it."
5.0,"This fits true to size. It's absolutely adorable. It has snaps on the bottom too, which is super convenient for changes. Great quality."
5.0,I love this watch. I'm a big guy and this watch has an athletic presence. I plan to get a couple other colors.

5.0,Very nice and looks great on her
5.0,I started working out at the gym this year and the racer back bras gave me horrible neck pain.. I was refered to these bras. The way the racer back on these don’t come all the way up behind my neck keeps the pain away.. The bra type closures allow for a great fit and continuous support.. Favorite sports bra EVER!
5.0,Perfect for my Oktoberfest parties
5.0,"I have ordered 2 pairs so far. They both feel amazing. The material is the quality of LuluLemons, which I have a large collection of their products. I was so surprised to find these joggers are just as high quality for way less price."
5.0,"Hello bandanas! These are exactly what I was hoping to get: the perfect size I wanted to make a jagged-edge skirt, the perfect weight for these hot Arizona summers, the perfect colors I had in mind, and all at a great price! I don't know what all the complaining is about...nowhere is &#34;Made in China&#34; printed on them, and the small amount of lettering is 1/2&#34; tall, not detrimental (in the slightest!) to the overall design, and can HARDLY be considered offensive or really even that obvious. Some people just love to complain."
5.0,Comfortable and really do not slip
5.0,Bought this for a friend's wedding and this is SO pretty! I have dark skin and a fair bit of booty and hips and it fit SO well. More than 6 people commented on my dress and how it was made for me. It's bright and colourful and just looks like a dream!
5.0,Just like the picture it looks great
5.0,"Perfect purchase, I'm completely satisfied.  I had ordered a necklace that only the pendant came and was very unhappy because it was a gift and no chain I had would fit the pendant.  Good price, great quality, elegant look, and great for pendants it's hard to find an actual necklace for!  Saved the day.  A+++"

5.0,We got this for Grandma's birthday and she immediately took her other purse and emptied it our into this one. She was so excited that is was small and could hold multiple things.
5.0,"This matched perfectly with my grandson's sweatshirt. On Christmas Day, he put this on and the sweatshirt and did not want to get out of them. He even slept in this mask as a hair wrap, to keep his style neat."
5.0,"I wanted an alternative to the default silicone strap, and got this. Pretty much works as advertised. Includes tools for adjusting and strap, and seems to be durable. So I would definitely recommend."
5.0,The Quality is Very good. I would prefer if it was half cm longer.  But I am dude though. Buying this instead of buying the moto Light metal you Save Money.  I would Say about 30 bucks .<br />Satisfied

5.0,Exaclty what I was looking for! Product as described well made... sized it easily myself thank you
5.0,"This is a must have!! If you’re considering buying, don’t even hesitate. Buy buy buy. I bought one pair and immediately bought 6 more the day I got them. I want to throw all my other leggings away and let me just say, i am NEVER buying Lulu lemons again because THESE are lulus for a fraction of the price. I’ve tried so many “dupes” and never liked them but these are insane. They are so silky smooth and so strong on the stomach they suck me in all day and never roll or fall down, no matter how much i stand and sit down and workout and i feel so skinny in them. I would spent thousands of dollars on every color in the world on these if I could. They fit to your normal size!"
5.0,"I have an iPhone XS Max. I wanted something that I could put my phone, some cards, cash and receipts into. I ordered a cell phone folio, that when delivered, really couldn’t hold my cards and everything so I returned it to Amazon. I ordered another one that held the cards but was very bulky and wouldn’t close properly and returned that one. I then ordered a mans cluch with a 2 zippered pocket arrangement and that one was just too big. I ended up returning that one also. I was ready to give up and then decided to give this one a try. It was perfect and just the right size. It holds everything I need and it’s also very classy. Seems well constructed with good stitching. It holds my phone safely within one of the folds. This clutch/ wallet is what I was looking for all along."
5.0,"Absolutely darling. Cite, good for and great material"
5.0,"I assumed it came with one since it is shown in a couple of the pictures. However, I do see that no where in the information given does it actually say it has one.<br /><br />That aside, I do love the bag. The bag came new. It was a very good color. I have switched over to it and love the size and way it looks. Keeps everything organized. I also like the zipper closure. Very nice and not too expensive."
5.0,This is a well made shirt.  The colors are rich and the fabric is very soft.
5.0,"I have lost quite a bit of weight and had no black pants that fit, I was going to a function that i really needed some so i ordered these and they were exacty what i needed!!"

5.0,"the ring is beautiful and the 3 stones are impressive, guys you can feel proud when your lady shows this to all her friends.<br />my girl did not want me to spending a fortune on a ring but i wanted to feel good about it when she shows it off.<br />the moissanite stone is a great compromise,rarer than diamond and will even passes the uninformed jeweler's testing. i did tell my lady to be safe.<br />she loves it and said yes yes yes."

Fits well, doesn't slip down your nose when talking, light weight plus flexible, works with any mask, and it's held in place with the bracket loops, you don't have to tape in place. I had to buy more to keep some in my car and at work."

5.0,"I like this bracelet a lot.<br /><br />I like this more as a gift among many gifts and not a standalone gift for mom.<br /><br />This is for a woman with a smaller wrist.  Additionally, it's supposed to dangle, so bear that in mind for the person you're getting this for.<br /><br />This is beautiful, nonetheless.<br /><br />Bracelet provided for review by the seller."
5.0,"Excellent! Not too much wax, just right. This is a wonderful product and so far is holding up well."

Material looks a bit cheap and is sewn a little haphazardly. But let’s be honest: this top is made for photos and will be worn in a dark club during New York fashion week when no one can see me anyway. Hopefully this helps. xx

5.0,"I got this product for my son since he will be online for school and sitting in front of the computer for several hours.  It came with a case,  cleaning rag, blue light and blue card.  We tested it out and was amazed on how well it works.  My kid has been wearing it and it is very comfortable.  Very nice sturdy and nice looking.  He looks like Harry Potter, lol"
5.0,Very warm and comfortable in fact sometimes I sleep in it. The mask that comes with it is also one of the most comfortable I've ever worn and it tucks away nicely under the hat creating even more warmth thus maybe a little too much for spring but for the cold months I love it. I would get one in every color of the rainbow if I could because the price is certainly right and arrived quickly.
5.0,"Love the hat... quality, look, feel... the hat is bomb and it's Well worth buying. ❤️ ❤️ 😍 😍 !"
5.0,"PERFECT!! Plenty of room for all of my things plus my phone. Zippers work great, no snagging. Lots of little hidey places which I love. I have used this for over a month and it is holding up perfectly as expected. I would buy this again."
5.0,"Well made, fits great. High quality"
5.0,I love this ring because it is believable that i could actually afford a diamond ring like this one and no one would think twice. The ring shines and sparkle beautifully. I've received more compliments than i anticipated. This ring is believable for the average working couple who's on a budget. Let's be real most of us on Amazon looking for a nice deal for our buck well this ring you can't go wrong for the price and on Amazon an upgrade is ssoooo easy to do when we're ready. Just think at these prices an upgrade can be done yearly. If you like change like i do this is an ideal way to purchase wedding rings. Spending 800-1000 on rings you stuck with the same look for years the average working Joe I'm speaking of. That same money i can change up at anytime and not feel guilty about money. The rings are beautiful and came so fast.
5.0,This was easy to use

5.0,Very lovely & you can't beat the price.
5.0,This is a very made warm hat for the price.  Almost as good as draping a cat on my head.
5.0,Comfy pullover soft inside. As expected. Would buy again.
5.0,Grandson loved the socks
5.0,Great sunglasses you really can't beat them especially for the price. They look awesome on me and they fit my face perfectly.

5.0,I have purchased several of these pants it different colors and they all fit great! I stand just under 5'6' and am kind of rubenesque(fat). One of my girlfriends stands just under 5'2&#34; and is a size 2 and these fit her as well.

5.0,Beautiful watch.<br /><br />I really like the quality and value of Nixon watches.  They're really well made and have great style.<br /><br />This is my third Nixon.<br /><br />This watch is nice because it has a plum face that sets it off.<br /><br />I highly recommend!

5.0,Súper Nice. Confortibles.
5.0,"Husband loves this sweater. Fits great, looks great and it’s really soft. He also says the hood fits perfect and doesn’t weigh his head down."
5.0,"So far so good- have done 2-3 day trips with the bag and it's light weight and holds what I need. Pretty comfortable, but a waist strap might make it a little more comfortable. New to hiking/backpacking, so for the price and my experience level, it has been excellent!"
5.0,purchased for my wife.  Everything was perfect.
5.0,Vibrant colors good quality shirt
5.0,Glasses are very attractive and they fit just right!  The tint is just right for me! I will probably order another pair for myself.

5.0,My son absolutely loves these!! He is 9
5.0,Sorry I forgot to leave a review.  LOVE these earrings!  They are perfect!!
5.0,"This is a great ribbed sweater tank that is great worn on its own or layered over a blouse. I paired mine over a cream silk blouse recently for a business conference & I received a lot of compliments. I'm 5'5"" & 135 lbs: I ordered size Medium. I am busty so I sometimes take a small in Women's clothing & sometimes a Medium. (I could have worn either size but the Medium does work nicely for layering.) This tank washed up beautifully with no fading whatsoever (I always use a lingerie bag, cold water & I line dry it).  The dark green color is nicely saturated & it is a very versatile color. I also really like the length as tops that are too long make me just look frumpy.....  I'll be back for this item in another color soon!"
5.0,Really cute light weight stretchy material. I love it
5.0,"Great value, looks good, and can take a beating in the gym."
5.0,I absolutely love this product!!!  I have bought several pairs over the last couple of years.<br />(Losing a few and gauging up)

5.0,I purchased these slippers to wear around the house. I added crushed gold strips to them because I like a lil bling.

5.0,Gorg!! Your feet will be the envy of the beach!!
5.0,Love the fit and love the the quality!  Excellent buy!
5.0,The right size for the poolside towels etc.
5.0,"They were beautiful and a perfect gift, for all those potato stans. I was initially worried that they would be too big, but no and now they have brought joy. A sweet potato for a sweet potato."
5.0,"Great value set of earrings, the quality of every one of them feels great. I believe it is a great set to add to your jewelry collections."
5.0,"As others have already noted, these boyshorts run very small. However, I still selected ""Fit as expected"" because the seller makes it very clear that these are Asian size and they provide an accurate size chart that tells you what size to order, given your American size and your measurements. I normally wear size M and have a 30"" waist. I ordered the XXL, since that is what the chart recommends, and the shorts did fit (gave me a little bit of muffin top but that's okay since my waist is a little thicker than what they recommend in the size chart, and it was just a little muffin top). They also feel very nice and seem to be of a good quality, which surprised me. The only reason I am returning them is because I wanted to wear them as exercise shorts, rather than underwear. I was hoping that they would be long enough that I could wear them as shorts, but they are a bit too short and look more like underwear. That's not really a criticism, though, because they are meant to be underwear anyways."
5.0,It's exactly what I was expecting ... I'm happy with it
5.0,It was perfect i love strips on the apron
5.0,Good quality for its price. My daughter loves it 😍
5.0,I Love this shirt. The material is well worth h the money. I highly recommend this item.
5.0,"I'm small around the band but have larger breasts, so finding bras that fit is never easy. These fit well, are supportive and comfortable. So far have washed well, I don't put them in the dryer, but wash them in the machine with a regular load. Great value, I bought the six pack, very happy with the deal."
5.0,"I have put these to the test. After suffering through several pairs of waders that could not handle my hips and butt and all the squatting I have to do it was a relief to find some that understand the curves of a woman’s body. I have hiked, waded, and sampled in these without ever feeling like they were restricting my movement. Blackberry? No problem. Navigating over and under large woody debris? These can perform squats so deep that any yogi would be amazed. Got them heavy boobs? These make room for them.<br />Waders designed by women for women. No need to fit into a man’s size standard"
5.0,my 6yo son loves this little watch + he learned how to read the dial
5.0,Comfortable fit and great sun protection. Wore them for a week of bonefishing in the Bahamas.
5.0,"I have a smallish waist & big thighs 🤷🏻‍♀️ and finding tights is always difficult for me, But these fit perfectly! Tummy control and super stretchy around the legs! Love these. Going to purchase more."

5.0,Keeps food cold on way back from grocery store in extreme heat!!!
5.0,"Thank you simple flavor for making this timeless,classic and great dress. I just got this, arrived before the expected schedule. The fit is great.  Please check the size chart, measure your size, get a size up. This dress is by far the best I ever put on."
5.0,"Only slightly yellow but greatly functional. My eyes have literally been hurting, I mean really painful. I had been trying every eye drop I could find to minimize the pain. These glasses were the one thing that actually did. I'm on the computer far more than I care to admit. I had pain and sleeping difficulty. Both have eased tremendously after receiving these. They fit my big head just fine and look great."
5.0,I liked it. Daughter thought the seam was too irritating. Would work well for a girl that isn't bothered by that sort of thing. Very cute dress. I would have made her wear it but it came 24 hours late and the event we needed it for was over.
5.0,The size was PERFECT for my nose. They closed nicely and I’ve been using them everyday without them opening or changing colors. I’d highly recommend.

5.0,This is a great product that has helped relieve pain from my plantar fasciitis. My only complaint is that I bought my true shoe size and my feet hung off the end. I then ordered a 1/2 size larger and they fit perfect.

5.0,Amazing wallet I absolutely love it.
5.0,Excellent quality band and very expensive looking
5.0,Muy bueno relación precio beneficio
5.0,This dress is amazing!! I bought this for a bridemaids dress and I was very skeptical because of the price. After reading the reviews and looking a customer's pictures of the dress I decided to order it since I knew I could easily return it with no hassle. The dress arrived when expected and I had no issue with the packaging. The dress fit like a glove but definitely had room to sit and dance and even a little room if you gained some weight. Definitely would recommend the dress!!
5.0,I'm in love with this top.. I say top<br />Because I'm 5'11&#34; and this would be a fairy short dress on me! I did order a size up as suggested by previous reviews and I will need to wear a white tank under it. But it's so cute and I will definetely be sporting it with some leggings and boots this fall!
5.0,Excellent product! It may seem pricey but you get what you pay for!! They're a quality pair of pants....they're my 3rd pair to purchase
5.0,Surprising good quality for the price.  Very pleased with these and will order more.
5.0,Worth it!! Very cute and my husband loves this dress on me.
5.0,"A very nice bag and terrific value. The quality is great, and just as others have said, it is the perfect size, not too big, but sure holds a lot. I think this bag will be a great pop of color during the winter months , but also a really nice spring color with light colored casual shoes .The color is a nice shade of coral which is much more neutral than a bright pink so I was pleasantly surprised with the color. The leather is good quality and the strap perfect contrast. Overall very satisfied with this purchase"
5.0,"love the colors but a little small, gave them to my wife"
5.0,"Great fit, great look, very fast delivery!"
5.0,I love this bracelet. It is very well made and fits comfortably. I hope that they make more with different gemstones other than garnet. It's a beautiful piece.

5.0,Way longer than I expected!

5.0,"This is not a very thick silicone gloves but they are very soft materials. Although they are a little bulky, my hands are size medium to large so work pretty well. I like the fact that they are more durable than the typical gloves as long as you get used to its bulkiness."
5.0,wife loved them on me..
5.0,Love making a statement without everyone knowing!!
5.0,Ok this mask was amazing! It was very simple to download and start using the associated app. Lights are good. Many mask lighting options with a wide variety. Excellent product!

5.0,Earrings are gorgeous and very sparkly look real. They are sturdy earrings and even though the backings are not 14kt they are suitable for the earrings keep them from drooping. Love Love Love
5.0,These shows are fantastic. They are super soft and very flexible. My son loves wearing them and they are his go to pair. He doesn’t complain that they hurt his feet which is a big deal because most shoes do. They were pretty true to size as well. I love them as a mom because they are so light weight. When you pick them up they feel like air they are so light.
5.0,This body chain is very nice. The size is perfect.Looks and fits like picture.
5.0,useful way to minimize the waist
5.0,Bestform has to be one of my favorite bras.  They are very comfortable and last a long time.  This is actually my second purchase of this style.  They don't stretch out like some others I have had in the past.  Would highly recommend them
5.0,Got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and he absolutely loves the color and print.
5.0,Perfect! exactly what I expected and more.
5.0,This coat is the best rain coat I have ever bought. Love the style and fits wonderfully.
5.0,These have a little weight to them and are so beautiful.
5.0,"My most favorite jacket for my toddler! I loved how cute yet handsome and grown he looked in it. He was always warm and always happy. Washes well, too! Just take the faux fur off."
5.0,"these Cufflinks are contemporary in design, The engraved letter on a mother-of-pearl background is stunningly beautiful. It personalizes the whole self and added confidence."
5.0,I like the quality and the fit.  As for use I use the sweat shirts for everyday wear.
5.0,"Great! Bought them for my flag football team (haha), when I opened them they seemed small but stretch a ton and don't move too much during a game. We have 3 different index size cards with 6 drawn out plays each. I was very impressed. Definitely worth the buy!"
5.0,"Common, you know this is the best base level watch. They last years and they are tough. Only downside is that the band is almost impossible to change out."
5.0,Bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He is an avid fisherman and this shirt is absolutely perfect!  It is light weight and made of good material.
5.0,My mother love's it
5.0,Really comfy! I found them cheaper at Walmart after I ordered though.
5.0,"To think I almost returned these thinking I had one too many black boot!  These boots are deliciously comfortable and well made. The boot strap is removable, should someone want a more traditional look.  I usually wear a 6.5 or 7 and the 6.5 fits perfectly.  This is my second pair of Coclico shoes -- it certainly won't be my last."
5.0,"Great suit, the material is thick."
5.0,Super cute hat made from 100% paper. Bought 7 for a girls weekend trip and everyone loved them. Comes in cute bag we ended up reusing for bathing suits.

5.0,"They’re all very pretty, look just like pic. Excellent value!"
5.0,"My band broke off a few months after having the watch which was a huge disappointment (the screws came loose), especially since I couldn't find my original receipt.  It appears this is a common occurrence with these watches, so while it's crappy I had to replace it,  the replacement band was easy to put on and has lasted longer than the original."
5.0,"Perfect size and color. It works as an every day watch, but also coordinates nicely for a night out.<br />The blue is a vibrant noticeable tone and silver adds a nice touch.<br />Received several compliments and I find myself wearing it almost every day."
5.0,This is by far my favorite cartilage earring.  Its beautiful and I can sleep comfortably on it.  Two thumbs way up.
5.0,My kids love these type of goggles!  They fit all ages from 3 up to 12 in our family.  I love that they I clip in the back to get them on and off easily and they are very comfortable.
5.0,"A supremely beautiful ring! The deep reddish purple hue inside adds a depth to this gorgeous ring that brings a smile to your face as you reach to put it on. The sizing is spot on, the rose flower cutouts make this a special piece of jewelry I've gotten many compliments on already. If you haven't tried stainless steel,  you simply don't know what you're missing. The seller was fantastic, shipping it right away and having it arrive more quickly than I thought it would (always a nice surprise) in great condition, nicely padded and wrapped. Great ring, great price, stellar service -- win, win, win!"

5.0,quick delivery on this product. It is exactly what I thought it would be. I'll wear it with pride.
5.0,Comfy cozy fit
5.0,"When I purchased these socks, there were no reviews but I figured I’d chance it. What a delight when they arrived. Vibrant, perfect stretch, not too tight around my cankles, and are just plain cool to look at. Great buy."
5.0,"Just as described! cool item, Jason is my Fav!! Its very sturdy & I get a lot of compliments on it."
5.0,"For the price point, I think this sweater is great. It is not a heavy knit, but it is soft and cozy and drapes well. The neckline is high enough so that one isn't too exposed in cold weather. The slight bishop sleeve updates this fairisle classic style and the colors are deep and rich."
5.0,"These arrived on time, and I absolutely love them! Super comfortable and cute. Id definitely recommend them to anyone."
5.0,mind you I did not realize this was coming all the way from China. Usually I try and buy state side and with the shipping delays I was tempted to cancel this order but it was worth the wait. I am in love with this.
5.0,"Llegaron súper bien tal como yo los esperaba me encantó las gafas, y debo admitir que llego antes de tiempo"
5.0,Got this to add to a costume for Halloween . Turned out to be better quality than expected so wear it on other occasions as well.
5.0,I love this as a gift 4 our niece!
5.0,This jacket is really nice. The quality and weight is good. I am very picky about the feel of material on my skin and was very happy to find that the feel and stretch of it is very comfortable.
5.0,Amazing shoe- too narrow. Doesn't come in wide width!! :(
5.0,"Fits perfectly and thicker fabric than so many others, Seems durable. Looks like i can swap out the headband for any other colour/pattern if i want."
5.0,"Super soft, has pockets."
5.0,Very nice quality and very pretty
5.0,"Looked great, fabric wonderful"
5.0,"Really love the comfort and look of these shoes.  Shoes with block heels are the most comfortable, in my opinion.  It’s also the perfect height.  Great purchase."
5.0,"I'm 5'3, 130 lbs, and the M is fitted on me. I usually wear XS-M in other brands, so I would say this shirt runs small. Sleeves and length are cut like petite sizing. I like the higher neck in the back for extra sun protection. Very breathable material as the ""pores"" are big."
5.0,Got this item as a gift for a friend and both of us were very happy with it. All of the items that she had in various places in her purse were easily and neatly able to be stored in the new wallet and there was still room and slots remaining.
5.0,This is such a great dress for the price. I bought for a holiday party and I love it. I would size down as it runs big. I usually wear a M/L and could have gotten away with a small. The medium is pretty roomy for me but still looks great. Definitely recommend!
5.0,I love it!! This necklace is so pretty and elegant and a great something small to wear out.
5.0,Que la tela no es gruesa es muy fino
5.0,"I'm 5'10"" 175lbs and it's perfect. Long enough for flats or heels.  I bought another one in a different print."
5.0,"Better than expected! Super comfy and flattering (mom gut post three kids ;)) I’m 5’6, 165. I bought a large and have room—probably could have even purchased a med. I would definitely recommend this! I want to buy more colors—so easy to throw on and still look put together ."
5.0,"These are super soft and well-made. The X-SM is a perfect fit for me (5'2&#34;, 105 lbs, average chest), but they're just a little longer than I need. If I tuck it into jeans, it almost gets to my crotch. Since I use them for undershirts in the winter, I'd prefer a tiny bit shorter."
5.0,"Looks better than the picture, but it took a long time to receive it.  Very dressy and glam.  Better for going out than going to work."
5.0,"This is a beautiful black velvet choker as it has that nice and mysterious vintage look to it. The material feels very nice as it is soft and gentle against the skin. It does not irritate or bother my neck at all when I wear it as the choker is smooth and soft as mentioned before. The choker is indeed black and looks as described as it looks just like the picture shown on here. It is also very comfortable to wear as well. It is also easy to put on as it is adjustable so you can wear it tighter or loose depending on your preference. I particularly like the way it looks on me as it looks very stylish and it elongates my neck. I can wear easily match it with anything due to the color as it is versatile. I honestly feel like it completes a look or an outfit. You can easily wear this as a casual look or a more sophisticated  occasion as you can dress up or down with this simple yet fine piece. You can easily stand out when wearing this as it looks great and what I like about it the most is the fact that I can add a pin to it in the middle and change up the look if I want to as it is easy to adjust a pin to it as well. Overall, it is of high quality and I purchased it at a discount in exchange for my honest and fair review.Vintage and elegant is how i would describe this lovely choker."
5.0,"My daughter looks adorable in this dress! She gets a lot of compliments when she wears it. She also has the matching headband, which takes her look to the next level. It is easy to care for too. Which is fantastic!"
5.0,This was for a gift for a coworker/friend who is a flamingo fanatic. She LOVED this item!
5.0,My granddaughter age 10 picked this out. She loves it
5.0,Fast delivery and I love them. The size is perfect for me yet still lightweight.
5.0,Great hat. Good quality and very warm. Will order another one. Just wish they had more colors
5.0,Doesn't really look like pajamas it looks like an outfit. Very cute
5.0,"Most of these tungsten rings are 10x to 30x as expensive as this one and they don't look or feel any better. I have had mine for 2 months now and it is very durable and has a good weight to it. Very solid feel... you can tell it is there! If you want a light-weight ring this is not your ring. I liked it so much I actually bought another one as a spare, just like it in case I lost the original for some reason! You will not be sorry!"
5.0,Nice product.  My 2.5 yr is doing great with them.
5.0,Really nice quality ring. Exactly as pictured. Fits true to size.

5.0,"Loved the material, So soft and cozy. I bought this for my sister for Christmas. We are on the short side, I'm a few inches taller at 5"". The length was great! Now to order mine!"
5.0,"I was very satisfied with this product, they are high quality, great price, you can’t find a better plug at that price in any store"
5.0,"I like this style a lot, just wish there were more colors to choose from."
5.0,Outstanding workmanship on my new USAF Viet Nam Veterans Be local.
5.0,Grear price & fit! Soft material! Just a tad bit long to wear under a dress but it works if you pull them up more. Perfect fit!  I wear a Medium because of my hips and buns 😁 but it worked great
5.0,"This watch band is absolutely  Perfect, I am going to order another one for a spare with my next social security check."
5.0,I made a bracelet for my niece and this was the &#34;centerpiece&#34;...ADORABLE!

5.0,I love this flannel!! I read the reviews so I got it one size up.
5.0,"Soft, comfy, flowing and long enough (I’m 6’ tall).<br />I got them to wear on a 2 month trip to India.<br />Also bought them in a pattern... the pattern pants were not as long/not as soft, but enjoyed them anyway."
5.0,Lots of nose rings and nice color choices
5.0,Use the chart size is not accurate
5.0,"Wore this dress for New Years, loved it"
5.0,The socks are well made and interesting.
5.0,"Great wristband, very  cool and the clasp is sturdy and does not come off easily.  I wear mine all the time in the water, shower 24/7."
5.0,This dress is perfect!!  I'm very self conscience of my butt and thighs and this dress falls perfectly. Im 5&#34;7 and typically wear a 10/12 in US women's sizes and I ordered a large. This dress hits right below my knee. I bought this to wear for my wedding rehearsal and this is the best dress I have ever bought online. The quality of the material is thick so can be worn all year long. I will definitely be ordering this dress in other colors.
5.0,It was perfect ! Looks just like the picture and is true to size
5.0,I love these. Feel great and thinking about getting another pair. Im a size small/medium and they fit great.
5.0,"Took the handbag to Africa, received many complementstudents on the style and the functionality was very easy to acco,polish.  Amazon shipped in 2 days, TravelSmith couldn't ship it in 4 weeks."
5.0,This watchband is stylish and easy to change.  The colors are bright and are an excellent accessory to many outfits.  I also love the width of the band!
5.0,"had 2 pairs of boots, one with worn heels and 1 with cracked soles. so, bought one set of these soles to fix both boots. after reading other reviews, i purchased Barge rubber cement to adhere them, and clamped them overnight. i am wearing the ones with the repaired sole today, and they are doing great! more comfortable, still flexible, as good or better than when they were new. the soles were not hard to cut with a sharp scissors. will purchase again if i ever have the need , and will recommend!"
5.0,This shirt is gorgeous.  It fits perfectly.
5.0,So beautiful! Great quality piece!
5.0,It’s like Elton John meets fashionable alien
5.0,Very flattering. If you’re self conscious about things fitting tightly to on your breasts you should order a size larger.
5.0,Super cute but transparent
5.0,"My husband used this gloves to work since January2019, this gloves lasted from 2019 until now January 2022, I ordered another pair today..... he said there are really warm and he is so happy with the size, highly recommended.<br />Mi esposo compro estos guantes para trabajo en enero de el 2019 los usa cada invierno y le duraron hasta ahora enero 2022, hoy ordene otro par, el esta muy contento con el resultado son guantes muy buenos para bajas temperaturas y el esta feliz porque al tener manos grandes necesita un size grande y estos guantes tienen sizes hasta XXL."
5.0,It was perfect - nothing to dislike
5.0,"This little crossbody bag is rather nice. Really better than anticipated. The red color is a deep red; very pretty. No special identifying features, but it doesn't look cheap either. Just looks like an understated little purse. The material is soft- it is a synthetic leather. The zipper, snaps, and compartments have a sturdy, durable look and feel to them. Good stitching.<br /><br />This little bag is indeed small but has useful organization to it. Under the magnetic closure flap is a deep open pocket. Next to this is a zippered compartment that subdivides into three more pockets. The center one is kind of a tight fit, but it seems useful if wanting to use it, or it stays out of the way if you just want to leave it empty. The outside has one vertical zippered compartment.<br /><br />I'd say it would be great for hands free days. You just want to wander around a store, or go for a walk, something that you want the basics, but don't have pockets or want to use pockets to load up. It fits my Pixel4XL w/wallet case fine. It is roomy enough for some basic every day carry goodies, like a packet of tissue, lip balm, travel hand cream, some bank cards, money, little memo pad, pen, etc. I can already see using this as a purse to use in night outs, going to restaurant, etc. Where I want to have something on me, but I don't want to carry an actual purse, or just my phone.<br /><br />Additionally, I like that the bag lays flat. It has a very slim profile. It expands as it gets filled up, but flat when nearly empty."
5.0,Beautiful.  Excellent quality.  Love it.
5.0,Came on time. Really nice but tarnishes quickly.
5.0,This cap is very suitable and at a very good price. Thank you.
5.0,Bought this for my 27yo daughter. She loves it! She said it is cozy and soft.
5.0,"I am in love with these earrings so easy to put on and they stay closed, I don't take my jewelry off very often."
5.0,Something awesome!
5.0,Very warm maybe to warm. Never felt water
5.0,"I ordered two by mistake and was going to send one back, but it is such a perfect purse I kept both of them!"
5.0,gooooood (:
5.0,Bought these for my leather boots which had only 2 eyelets on each side. They fit perfectly as my original ones.
5.0,I use this hat as a work hat and...It is Perfect!
5.0,This scarf feels fabulous against the skin. It is so soft and breathable.The edges are nicely finished which indicates quality.  I am very pleased with this purchase..
5.0,"New watch band very user friendly , just what I needed."
5.0,Love it.  Cute
5.0,"Very pretty, my daughter loved it."
5.0,"Great sunglasses for the price, and I love how they fit my face. Very fashionable! :)"
5.0,"This is an elegant watch that looks great, wears well and functions as a reliable automatic. I purchased it about a month ago, after being very pleased with my Zodiac Sea Wolf 53 Comp. This Sea Dragon watch is much more stylish and has small features that the Sea Wolf does not (small Zodiac logo on crown, window on the back). The face is copper, brown, rose-gold depending on the how light hits it. I really like the leather band with the metal clasp, although it takes a little practice to become adept at closing it quickly. I think the clasp system will preserve the leather better than a conventional closure. Highly recommend."
5.0,"I definitely recommend this product! The buttons make it perfect. If you’re choosing between this one and another, get this one!!"
5.0,"I am 5’7, 147lbs and wearing a size medium. It fit perfectly and it looks way more expensive than it is. Amazing quality and so beautiful. Highly recommend anyone purchase this dress! Lightweight and comfortable."
5.0,"Good belt, Looks great quality material.. functions well."
5.0,A small but very cute purse. I love this for when I’m shopping. I was very surprised at how much stuff I’m able to put in this purse since it’s small. I wanted something small and the bonus was me being able to put more items in it than I expected to.
5.0,The dress fits amazingly. I definitely recommend sizing up depending on the look your going for. It’s a super soft cotton fabric that feels great and fresh perfect for the heat.
5.0,"It fit as anticipated.  Quality seems good (time will tell for sure), and it arrived promptly."
5.0,"Super cute and WARM. My little man was toasty as all get out after about 20min outside. The only &#34;down-fall&#34; is that the hood doesn't stay up super well, plan on still using a hat."
5.0,Adorable novelty item to buy
5.0,Omg my daughter loves the set
5.0,This is an amazing dress!  It’s very comfortable and it looks great!  I can dress it up or I can dress it down for a casual look. I would recommend this to anyone!  Great value

5.0,"Great comfort and qquality is supreme.!!!!!😇😇😇<br />Surprised at the ""better than HOTEL quality"" this is the only one!!!<br />A tinge just a tinge small. Not too much though. It's one size fits most, I'd guess size 20 wms. 👍👍👍👍👍"
5.0,Great dress for the price. Very comfy and material looks more expensive.
5.0,The fabric is great! The fit is perfect I get a lot of compliments on this top.

5.0,Love this swimsuit fits perfect
5.0,Very pleased with this purchase! Everything I expected. Also like the little box it came in so I don't have to find one.
5.0,I saw a friend of mine with this super cute cat bag some months before I finally decided I had to have it.  It's cute and quite roomy.  It is an actual Betsey Johnson bag.  Enjoy!
5.0,Fab just large---at least she can grow into them!
5.0,Nice glasses but way too big for me. But it says men's. I don't know how much men will love the Rose gold though
5.0,"I bought this for one of my teenage sons for Christmas. He is picky, so I had not seen him wear it. Then about a month ago I saw it on him. And I've seen it on him almost every day since! He wears it all the time. He snuggles into it and pulls the face mask up and naps sometimes LOL! But he washes it and wears it constantly. The hoodie still looks like brand new. This boy put his clothes through a work out ever day, so I am confident that this was made very well. He says he would like to have another one. I plan to buy him one!"
5.0,Awesome slouchie! Very pleased.
5.0,Great shirt and got a lot of compliments.
5.0,"Nice size pin, bigger than what I looks"
5.0,I feel like the  fit is fine.  My daughter loves this shirt. However after one wash the colors are extremely faded on the picture.  I wouldn’t buy again. I am going to try another amount us shirt for my daughter.
5.0,"I love owls, my grandmother collect them and when she passed on they saved all her hours and my daughter gifts them to me for holidays and this is such a perfect belly ring for anyone who loves owls and bling I wish I could add some pictures to show you how sparkly it is…"
5.0,I love these gloves!!! They are super super soft and so comfortable.  I highly recommend them and you cant beat this price for such good quality gloves.  So worth the purchase.
5.0,Socks were soft and true to the picture shown . I would buy again .
5.0,Exactly as noted in description. Came super fast!!
5.0,"COSTUME FYE, BRUH! Imma be flexin’ at conventions!"
5.0,"The dress is too cute! My daughter loves it! It's the perfect length.  The only con would be that the armhole cutouts are a bit large. When she wears it, she has to wear a small shawl over it you can see her bra on the sides when she raises her arms slightly (because cutouts are rather large)."
5.0,Thick... warm... fit hubby's huge melon.
5.0,I love this skirt! It's super comfortable and has just enough stretch to the material that it tucks in my waist without being too restrictive. I also live the retro look.
5.0,Love the way they fit. Great for running and working out.
5.0,"These do exactly what you want, compress your legs without being too tight. Easy on and off."
5.0,The sweater is wonderful. It's way too large but thetas my fault for ordering a large.
5.0,"Very unique , teen kids loved it."
5.0,"Great hoops, exactly what I was looking for. Very light and love the way they link in."

5.0,Almost no one got the reference! I love it
5.0,favorite product
5.0,The band is exactly as shown. It is going to be a perfect addition for my Grinch night.
5.0,"As an inexpensive gift, it was received with joy!"
5.0,I love it YOU won't be disappointed!
5.0,"Soft and beautiful,  but not big enough for my phone."
5.0,"My father-in-law loved this hat we gave to him for Father's Day!!!  Loves his Allis Chalmers tractors, too!!!"
5.0,"Very stylish and beautiful in its simplicity. I've received a lot of compliments for it. Designed in a way that keeps keys in one direction rather than pointing all over the place in your pocket. Easy to add on other key rings of keys. Only con (though could be a pro) is how hard it is to add keys to the super stiff/tight key ring that comes with it.<br />Will definitely buy again. Also would make a nice, simple gift."
5.0,The person that received this liked it so much that the lining was great and it was very comfortable to wear nice to look at and receive numerous compliments on the sweater patchwork good stitching good just a nice product
5.0,I’m short 5’ so this is perfect length<br />Accurate Capri size for average height
5.0,Good quality for the money. Seems to reduce glare.  Nice case included.
5.0,"Very well made, love it."
5.0,These sunglasses clip well over my glasses and keep out the glare. Of course when I'm headed directly into the sun at eye level I still have trouble seeing and I don't have an answer for that.
5.0,"This is a very nice accessory, It compliments almost any outfit. very well made soft and smooth on the skin. This is after all a 100% silk, Have no hesitation in making this purchase you will be totally satisfied with the quality of the scarf."
5.0,Loved it! The crown did leave a dent on my forehead but it was because of the weight. Useful tip: use bobby pins to help secure it to your hair so that your not trying to squeeze the headband around your head with just the ribbon. It will not work and you'll be left the dent :/
5.0,"Like the color, love the material they are not tight on your feet or ankles,love them. I already ordered more."
5.0,"My 10 year old grandson is a soccer player and a fan of Real Madrid, especially Ronaldo Christiano.  We got this as part of his birthday gift and he said he can't wait to wear it.  He wants to get a winter coat to match the hat and scarf set.  Our son said if our grandson doesn't wear it, he said he will!!  He loved it too.  He is a soccer coach and I'm actually considering getting a set for him also but in a different color.  The selection of colors was great and would definitely buy another one.<br />We are very satisfied with this purchase."
5.0,"I was worried these wouldn't stay on the back of my heel but the small rubber inserts on the inside of the heel make them stay in place all day.  No adjusting necessary - I'm impressed, having never worn socks this low before.  Just bought another pack the other day."
5.0,Wife liked it. I'm not crazy about the fabric but it's cute and casual. Bought it oversized just in case.
5.0,"Suit is well made and is very flattering. I usually wear a size 10-12 in pants, Medium or Large Top depending (bust 38D) and a size 12 in swimsuit. 5'5"" and currently at175lbs. The  fits well except for these wonky pads sewn into the breast area of the swimsuit giving the appearance of cones over your boobs . They aren't removable per se.... but l intend to make a mall slit in the lining to remove them! I ordered a Large 12-14 and the fit was perfect in all areas."
5.0,This dress is awesome for the price. I am glad I took a chance and bought it. I love the lace.
5.0,Great little undershirt
5.0,These are the ankle socks my sister wanted. So glad I have Amazon to use to do my shopping
5.0,"This is my go to umbrella for my walk from the parking garage to my work building. I have to walk down a very busy street where just the cars going by you creates strong breezes. This umbrella, so far, as held up and kept me dry from the rain and no issues with it wanting to flip inside out. The vents definitely help and make it easier to carry in the wind. A great size, easy to open and close and very sturdy. Exactly what I need in the Boston rain!"
5.0,very good quality and very cute!!
5.0,"This purse works well for me. It's a great size - small enough to fit into my desk drawer at work yet large enough to hold my e-reader and a few other things when I travel. Love the color, too. I like the fact it has a long strap that can be used (or not), and the flower (which can be removed) adds a sweet touch. Thanks!"
5.0,"So easy to set. At first directions looked intimidating , however when I realized I’d set time in a car& digital items before , I looked again& said ez Oz, I can do this , it WAS easy! Backlit dial is awesome, I have tiny wrist, that’s why I buy kids watch . This fits perfectly, love the color, Lt blue!"
5.0,"Have not worn as of yet , but tried on and it fits perfectly. Love the color."
5.0,Awesome and comfy!
5.0,"Carolyn here. I can't say enough good about this one. I tried it on again the other night and was surprised at how comfortable it is! The breast pads make my boobs look bigger than they really are, but my boobs are small, so I won't complain. It looks like a gogo dress. The skirt comes to about mid-thigh and the built in bottom underneath fits like boyshorts."
5.0,These earrings are so cute and very durable. Now I’m collecting pears for every season.
5.0,good value for the price.
5.0,Smaller than I thought but they're both nice. Very minimalist. Nice overall
5.0,"Nice for a casual skirt.  These are some of the things I like about the skirt. It fits me well. A-line skirt, not tight and clinging to your body. I like the pockets, belt loops all in the right position. Belt loop at the back and side and front of the skirt... so the belt can stay in position on your waist. Lightweight fabric which has a little stretch. I like the fact that the elastic at the back is stitched down a bit and not left to roll around in the waistband. Length is perfect for me. I also like the fact that it has a faux front- it does not button open the entire front. The front is stitched closed and not a full open skirt. I think it would have ripped with constant pressure if the front were not stitched down.<br /><br />What I will like to see: With the same quality fabric no inferior quality fabric, red, green, yellow, pink, blue skirts.<br /><br />The price point for the skirt. The current price I will accept because it has as I say a few details to benefit me: pockets, belt loops, faux open front, elastic back, etc. Thanks for a nice skirt."
5.0,"I got this product for my daughter, who is 5'3"" tall, 30"" waist, and 35"" hip.  The size small fits perfectly.  The fabric is soft and comfortable. The build quality is excellent."
5.0,Good solid hanger. Works for my PC w heavy plates
5.0,I ordered these to wear at work...ended up wearing them when doing errands due to how well they fit and cover the wrists.
5.0,light weight fits all of your stuff and very pretty accents of gold
5.0,"Bought it for a wedding. I have large stomach but nowhere else, so its hard for me to fine comfortable clothes. this fit perfectly and was very comfortable. I did make the mistake of wearing pantyhose and no slip and the skirt part would ride up on my thighs, but that was my own fault."
5.0,Awesome but is slightly different than photo.
5.0,Fit in all the right places
5.0,VERY BRIGHT..  :)  But that's what he wanted!

5.0,Comfortable summer throw on dress. Washes well. Recommend for hot summer days!
5.0,My husband loves this watch. Very sleek.
5.0,What a beautiful sweatshirt!  Due to the type of fabric I would rate it as somewhat small meaning it would be best to order the next largest size.  My grandson loved it!
5.0,These are such great quality and turned out to be even better than I expected! Can’t believe they are so great for that price. I absolutely love them!
5.0,Beautiful! Love it.
5.0,My wife absolutely loves this dress and she looks amazing in it. Fits perfect and is really made well
5.0,"Still going strong after a month of everyday use. I wash dishes, clean, work out, and do everything f with this on and so far so good.<br />Love the lightweight and sleek looking design. I have a very small wrist and this fit perfect"
5.0,Outstanding fit and comfort.
5.0,"Cinches the waist without being uncomfortable. Seems to run true to the size chart, if not slightly larger. The overall construction is high quality - made from superior materials. It is made of latex, which can make you sweat - resulting in waist reduction. Even comfortable enough to sleep in. Received at a discount for my honest review."
5.0,"I'm 5'4&#34; 130lbs. Fits pretty much exactly as pictured. The waistband is tight, might be uncomfortable if you are larger than a US size 8 or so. I got the pink color which is really more of a soft champagne color, it's gorgeous. I wore it to a work meeting today and got tons of compliments. I will definitely be ordering the real color as well. Great value, nice material."
5.0,Love these camisole tops perfect for me
5.0,Better than the pictures<br />Awesome

5.0,"It's really thin, and holds just the right amount of stuff for me.<br /><br />Definitely recommend."
5.0,Exactly what I expected to replace my 20 year old one.
5.0,"These boots are great!  Very high quality and hand made.  Great for a re enactor, someone looking for some excellent hiking boots or work boots or even as their primary footwear.  As made from high quality leather, they do require a little breaking in.  But what boots don't?  Since I received them and started wearing them I have gotten a lot of compliments especially from the ladies ; )  I would definitely recommend buying these boots, no complaints what soever.  Top notch boots."
5.0,Worked perfect. Need to keep the original pins and slots from old one though. Pretty soft and better than original. We will see how long they will last.
5.0,This is definitely a cute key chain I got it for my coworker since she loves butterflies.. it is durable too..
5.0,"Nice piece, saving for future use."

5.0,I love these workout shorts. I didnt pay attention to them fully as they have like an inner liner shorts but they are very comfortable. They are almost like wearing swim shorts to a certain extent. They are very lightweight and breezy. They are excellent airflow and I can't say enough good about these.
5.0,Nice. Exactly what I needed.
5.0,Fits perfectly and I wear it all the time! Love it!!
5.0,These glasses look nice and do not hurt my nose like others do while wearing.

5.0,"Bonitas zapatillas, tener cuidado, se ensucian rápido."
5.0,"Suppppeer soft very lounge stay at home set I would not leave my house in this set it’s very sexy tooo sexy I couldn’t add a picture… anywhooo material isn’t like workout to hold you in and would be slightly see threw if deep squatting, still love it for the price and quality"
5.0,As expected. Very Useful.

5.0,Bought it as a gift for someone and they are happy
5.0,I love my checkbook cover. The color is beautiful & It is so well made. I think I will be using it for a very long time.
5.0,"This runs very small. I’m normally a size 6 and ordered 2 sizes up based on the reviews. The sz 10 just fits without any room to spare. There is no stretch or give at all in the material, but it’s a beautiful upholstery type of material."
5.0,These are great Slippers. You talk about having no more sore feet. I wish I could wear them at work!!!!
5.0,"Love them they are small at 93mm had on my scx10ii jeep i mean if it was scale they be a 36"" tire much better for 1/12"

5.0,Perfect rack every time.
5.0,"love this dress, fits perfect! size is right on! the material is so soft, very comfy to wear out to a nice dinner party or dinner for 2!"
5.0,"I have purchased several of these cases in various prints for myself and as gifts.  The cases are stiff enough to protect your glasses or sunglasses without being heavy and weighing down you bag.  Do they protect as much as a metal case? Probably not if something heavy fell on top of them, but for average use they are great!!"
5.0,"Great fit, nice quality, quick delivery and I love that it’s prime."
5.0,Love my Coach glasses!

5.0,Nice fitting and comfortable right out of the packaging.
5.0,This watch was very much what I expected. Its classy looking and fits well!
5.0,"So far so good. Does what it's supposed to do. My watch is keeping accurate time and it's good to know I can pick up and use without having to reset things (I know, kind of a first-world problem). In any case, it's inexpensive and does what it's supposed to do. My only con is that it doesn't really suggest or tell you about the settings. I realize all watched are different but there must be some standard? No idea."
5.0,"This necklace is beautiful! It's dainty and light weight. Exactly what I was looking for at a great price! I love the design and how shiny it is. I did decide to put the pendant on a different chain, but that was just a personal preference. The chain is fine, just not the style I wanted with the pendant."
5.0,"Love these and will buy more!! They fit great and I use them for working out, pajamas, and layering under other clothes when needed."
5.0,Zapatos muy cómodos

5.0,Great quality.  True to size.  Very soft..My girl loved them.
5.0,"Comfortable,  Washes well.  Have purchased 3 of them."
5.0,"It's so cute and is feeding my bell sleeves obsession I've been having lately. It's a lil more cropped than expected but probably because I have like... a longer stomach if that makes sense? Lol, but nothing like a high waisted skirt, shorts or pants to help even out the ratio. I opted for a skirt, as you can see in the pics, that I also bought for something else but looked way better together."
5.0,Very good quality wallet.  My son LOVES IT!
5.0,"Loved the dress and it fit great.  will wear it again and again.  found ordering from amazon makes everything easier.  try not to look at other sites cause I have been disappointed with delays, quality, or not showing up at all."
5.0,Nice size and comfortable tho wear every day.  Quick shipping.
5.0,My husband loves this shirt and I would certainly buy another one for him. He loves his G-23 and he wants more...like all men that love guns he cannot get enough. Great shirt and worth the price.
5.0,My son loves this perfect siz hes 5
5.0,These glasses are so fun for Halloween or a Halloween party.
5.0,WAY TOO TIGHT
5.0,Soooo soft! I sleep in this and I love it. You'll love the fabric! Fast sheeping!
5.0,"very soft dress , little heavy, only issue was the waist area was too big. I should have gotten a large"
5.0,Size ran small.  Dont think these are the ideal product for busty women. I returned them.  Smooth transaction tho.
5.0,"The item arrived on time and it is AMAZING. It fits as expected, the material is soft and the lettering looks amazing. I am super happy with my purchase."
5.0,They are earrings so I will either keep and wear them and they aren’t too big or small for a child to wear.
5.0,Beautiful gift! My aunt loved it!
5.0,I purchased five shirts and very surprised by the excellent fit and comfortableness.
5.0,Loved it. Cover all my hair when cooking.
5.0,Beautiful! I typically wear a 9 however these boots I fit in an 8.5.
5.0,I am so happy that I got this dress. I love the floral pattern. I'm going to wear this for my twins first birthday party. It's going to fit the theme so well. I'm going with the BoHo style and I think this dress looks definitely BoHo.
5.0,Its very pretty! I love it! Has a nice flimover the whole thing that holds the necklace (think its go keep it safe) but i like it
5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE!’ I ordered an extra pair just Incase I lost my first pair!👍🏼👍🏼 Perfect fit!
5.0,"We're currently using for dress up storage, my two year old is obsessed, she keeps asking to watch let it go now!! I love it because it's pretty damn big for being so small. And the compartments on the front are wonderful for little hair ties socks and combs. It has a cup holder so I don't have to worry about leaving hers in the car during road trips. It seems to be really well made and sturdy. Rolls nice and smooth. The only thing I would change would be the front compartments, they're a little difficult to snap but it gets done. Definitely worth the cost, but I got mine free in exchange for an honest review"
5.0,"This dress is so comfortable and soft. Not see through, which is a huge plus for me. Great price & shipping. Thank you."
5.0,Just as the add shows...priced right also!
5.0,Loved it fit me perfect
5.0,The band is Casio made in Thailand. It fit perfect for my GW-M5610. It was kind of a pain to get the spring bars to align properly. If you aren’t used to doing it I would highly suggest going to your local watch store and having them swap it out for you. My local watch store does not charge to get bands replaced.
5.0,"I'll admit I was disappointed when I found out that Eddie Bauer discontinued my old jeans. Generally, I like to wear looser jeans because my legs are built like an ox... meaty and muscular... and most jeans don't fit me well.<br /><br />At first, I was skeptical about how form-fitting these jeans were on me, but I quickly got used to them. They have a good amount of give in the fabric and are breathable enough that I can enjoy wearing something that is relatively form-fitting to me.<br /><br />I ended up buying 3 pairs of these and they are my new go-to jeans."
5.0,Wish it was a little thicker but good but overall.
5.0,A Nice Beautiful Piece I Approve Of It And I Wear A lot Of Chains If Your A Big 50 Cent Fan Why Not Its A Great Buy Well Made 10 Stars For The Price Thank You Love It
5.0,"I bought this to go w/ a similar necklace & a purple outfit  I’d just bought.  I was a little less than excited about the brassy appearance of the metal in the photo,  but decided to get it anyway.  I’m so lad I did!  It’s beautiful. As is pretty much ALWAYS the case when buying jewelry on Amazon, it is much smaller than the photo would cause you to believe…HOWEVER, in this case, it was a welcome surprise.  It’s not so tiny that it’s pointless to wear it, as is sometimes the case—it’s the perfect size.  Looks very elegant.  Much more sparkle than anticipated-I love it!  Can’t wait to wear it & I think I’m going to buy another."
5.0,"Soft, thick, fabric that helps hide the love handles. The pockets are an extra plus to provide some Illusion of curves 😂. I'm 5ft tall, 150lbs and ordered a size Medium. I do have a big butt so the back comfortably could have been longer but it's cute!"
5.0,The product seems quality made.  It survived through a wind and rain storm without any damage and still looks new.
5.0,These are beautiful. I wish they came in sterling silver in navy blue. I have had several good comments on them.
5.0,"I was looking for winter gloves to wear during my commute. Love these! They fit as expected, are so soft inside and work really well on touch screens."
5.0,Stylish yet comfortable. Breathable so it is also shear. Be mindful of what underwear you wear.
5.0,It fits great...and great quality for the price.  I was hoping it would be wrinkle free...but it does have to be touched up with an iron....
5.0,A great hat that gives great respect for the bearer.
5.0,"Love these lenses! They work well for smaller faces, are polarized, and the plastic nubs that sit on the bridge of the nose are super comfortable. You don't get those weird marks on your nose. I got a pinkish purple color and it looks great!"
5.0,The top is a little loose and I'm a 38dd. But when I bend over it feels like I'm hanging out. But it covers my belly perfectly! Highly recommend!
5.0,Beautiful.. One of my favorite top.<br />So comfortable
5.0,I love this purse for the money! It is the perfect size!
5.0,Works perfect on my bucket bag looks classy very well made.
5.0,"Fits accurately, light weight, sturdy where it needs to be but flexes well too. I liked my first pair so I bought a second pair. Pricey but u get what u pay for"
5.0,It's a beautiful piece of jewelry. Very pleased!
5.0,My son is obsessed with Dr. Who.  I got this for him for Christmas and he wears it everyday.
5.0,"Floral print rayon material with solid blue lace. Bell sleeves, slit in the back bottom. Lace running down the back as well as the décolletage area and in the upper part of the bell sleeves. The lace is see through. The material does not have any give. True to size, this is a medium. Soft material. Very well made. Quality Tunic. I hope this has helped. Thank You"
5.0,"I love the color, and the band is comfortable. Nothing against the product, but with what I do in a day with my job it gets dirty quick, and makes it look dingy. I hand washed it with no problem, but will just have to use it when not at work."
5.0,i Think y’all have it wrong lol. Your supposed to go down a size so it could fit as a Compression shirt but if you want it baggy obviously go up lol. But it fits as expected I’m a XL and I went and got a LRG and the shirt fits as expected. Definitely would buy again.
5.0,"3yr old Sons favorite color is yellow and he desperately requested yellow “soft” pants aka not jeans! So found these and he loves them, even stained up the knees on his first wear but doesn’t stop him from wearing them as often as he can!! He’s about 35lbs & I’d say on the skinnier side. Fits 3T skinny jeans cat & jack brand from target, and 2T shorts (3T falls down). Wears 4T T-shirt’s for reference."
5.0,Got what was expected!
5.0,Loved this bathing suit! Was a little nervous buying this because I normally don't wear two pieces or high waisted clothing. This fit perfectly and looked great. After looking at the reviews I ordered a size M and it fit perfectly.
5.0,I love the flower design. Its beautiful and I want to buy it again.
5.0,In love with this dress! It’s a little big and long but so comfy!
5.0,Its really nice...I like it a lot !
5.0,Needed PJ's for travel and wanted to make sure all my goods were covered !!
5.0,They relieve eye fatigue Great. The shipment arrived Really fast. They’re comfortable and stylish. I love them!
5.0,I absolutely love this bag.  Very sturdy and lightweight.  It's the perfect length for my 5ft 3inch height.
5.0,Grandma loved them!!
5.0,Ordered it for a friend size 22 and the fit was perfect.  The length was also good. It does not drag
5.0,"Fun to wear, brings smiles when I'm out and about.  Always receive compliments on the mask."
5.0,"Better than I expected. Quality matetials: thick and firm plastic that I heated and formed to face, strap is well made."
5.0,Great Seller and products.
5.0,"I like these a lot for special events and I’m going to wear a Pretty pant suit. I’m that type of person who will never wear my high heels or platform shoes with naked feet! It’s Uncomfortable for me, & my feet feel odd! I’m not used to it. I feel better with that smooth & soft feeling on my feet. I’m glad I found them. Thanks"
5.0,Great product to have for plain bifocals. I cannot afford bifocal sunglasses but these work with my plain bifocals.
5.0,"This is very nice. Appears to be well made. Large clasp. I prefer smaller beads, but the oval shape balances out the larger size, at least for me. The only thing I don't like is that the stringing on the one I received is dark turquoise making it kind of thick looking. Pictured here the stringing is white. But that doesn't affect the apparent good quality."
5.0,"I really love it and highly recommend! I use it in my cartilage and it's very cute. I have my nose pierced as well but haven't tried it as a nose ring yet. It may not fit there as its pretty think, but I'm very happy using it in my cartilage anyways. Very nice product."
5.0,Christmassy and colorful.  Beautiful enamel and red/green sparkle for Pandora bracelet.
5.0,Can't love this dress enough!  Fits great even on a size 14!
5.0,TOO CUTE JUST AS PICTURED
5.0,"I have been looking for gloves that keeps my hands warm for long walks/hikes.  These gloves are perfect for that, I have bought many gloves in the past and many of them were more expensive, but these have proven to be the best gloves for keeping my hands warm.  I haven't tried the Touch Screen, so I can't say how well that works.  The gloves are thick, so I don't know how you would be able to type on a smartphone, but that's not why I bought them."
5.0,"Nice product, exact size,  good quality"
5.0,True to size.  Vary soft.  Just what I wanted .
5.0,"Nice shiny n well built, gift to son n army. He loved it"
5.0,"Seriously adorable, love this!"
5.0,My husband loves these shoes and he is not a flip flop wearer.
5.0,"This is a cute dress/top. I think the print and the material. It has two high splits on the side which makes it a little more hoochie if you choose to wear it as a dress but it does technical cover your but, so it is whatever you feel comfortable with. Personally I plan to wear it with leggings.<br /><br />The material is that stretchy and semi shiny material that is really comfortable. It looks as pictured, but it's more of a shiny material in person. Overall I really like the dress and think it looks cute. It's somethingn great to throw on for the weekend. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my review. My opinions are my own. I hope you found this review helpful."
5.0,"I love this top.  It is a comfortable fabric, soft, and fits well.  I love the puffy sleeves.<br />Already received compliments on it today at work!"
5.0,"For the price, this is a great accessory.  I have only had it a few days, but so far, it is keeping time and has a deceivingly high-end look."
5.0,I bought this for my best friend who HATES burpees and she loves it and wears often to the gym!
5.0,Quality made nice price too
5.0,Elegant dress for casual events
5.0,"I bought these jeans many years ago from flicks in my hometown for a crazy ridiculous price, because they fit amazing in the store and felt amazing. That's a rare combo. I was then 5'2 and 125 lbs. I got really sick and went down to 115 lbs. These still fit nicely. I got pregnant. I was able to wear them throughout my whole pregnancy.. 2.5 years later I now weigh 164lbs. I'm still 5'2 and these pants are still my favorite. They've been washed a lot. They still look brand new. I highly recommend these pants. I'm currently searching the internet for every color and best prices."
5.0,"Great fit, super comfortable and it's bleach resistant which is just what I needed for work!!"
5.0,"My Mother wore this when we placed wreaths at a local veterans cemetery on ""Wreath's Across America"" weekend.  The pin is lovely and the message beautiful."
5.0,Fits great! Stays in place. Quality customer service!
5.0,Fits perfect and can rock with any look. Stylish and easily manage.
5.0,It fits wonderfully! The materials good and it’s relatively high quality! :) 10/10
5.0,Loved the softness and feel of the shawl. Colors were vibrant. Would buy again
5.0,"Great bracelet. I bought to go with a Cleopatra costume for Halloween, but love it so much, I think it will be getting many more uses!"
5.0,"This hat was a lot of fun. Used it when the preschoolers came for Halloween.  It does shed a lot, but wasn't a big deal.  It got lots of compliments.  Would recommend for a warm winter hat that's also lots of fun.  As a one piece, you get a warm hat & mittens that has a button closure and a zipper pocket for your valuables."
5.0,"Great high quality band.  I have been wearing the band for about 2 weeks with no problems,  it looks great with a brushed aluminum and stainless steel mix.  It really makes the watch look sharp.  My only critical statement is the links are a little stiff when you try to move them,  but I don't notice this with the watched donned."
5.0,Love these gloves.  First pair of gloves that actually keeps my fingers warm.
5.0,I wear between a large and xl depending on the cut. I nervously ordered the large since it was the only size left 😩 but it exceeded my thoughts 😁.  The dress is a little stretchy. It’s not too short or too long.. the length is just right. I didn’t know the back was out but it’s not a big deal.
5.0,"The dress is 100%viscose material. It’s flowy, ruffled at the bottom and it twirls nicely. The details have a genius placement it complements the body. I bought an xs. Free people brand seem to run a bit bigger in sizes ( noticed after having multiple dresses. I’m typically small or even medium but if it comes to this brand it’s typically xs especially because viscos material stretches."
5.0,Love this hat and wide brim I plan to embellish it a bit. Looks great on
5.0,"I bought this being very skeptical about buying lingerie off the internet.  However I am pleasantly surprised!  This fit great, is sexy as hell and well made.  As a plus size girl, finding cute sexy lingerie that doesn't look like it's made for an 80 year old is hard to do.  The only down side is that it smelled a little funny but a hand wash made it perfect.  Would and will buy again!"
5.0,I bought this dress and LOVED the color and style. Tried it on my 5'3 body and it was 7 inches too long. Had it hemmed and it was a big hit!
5.0,So comfortable. Love these shoes!

5.0,very cute for the price. And they haven't bend as easy as other glasses that i have.
5.0,"Bought it as a gift for a friend, she loves it."
5.0,"Great item for the price, I usually where a size 12-14 and I ordered the XL.  My bust is pretty large so I don't think the L would have worked for me but if you are not top heavy and wear a 12-14 you could probably do the Lrg.  Material has a good stretch and color was as pictured.  Worked great for me!"
5.0,Received this band as a gift and it is beautiful. It matches my Vera Bradley bag perfectly. The colors are not as vibrant as it appears in the photos but I preferred that. Fits perfectly on my Apple watch 38mm

5.0,"Love these socks. I work in an ER, 12 hour shifts and they never fall down. Comfort level is fantastic!"
5.0,"Perhaps I can’t use it because it came large size and I wear S/M, I didn’t return it because item is cute and I can give it to someone."

5.0,"This is my husbands 2 nd pair of Doc Martin’s, first ones lasted 12 years.  He’s worn these new ones a couple weeks now and really likes them.  The size fit true and he likes that their not a heavy boot.  The bottoms have a good grip and that’s always a good find especially in Alaska."
5.0,The material is good they fit nicely

5.0,My wife had yoga socks with non skid soles but the socks slipped and twisted just when stability was needed in her Pilates workout.  These Meaiguo socks are working very well.
5.0,unique keychain great quality
5.0,"The bracelet is pretty much as shown when you buy it. Sadly, the USPS didn't deliver the bracelet until several days after Christmas so we didn't have a gift for one of our guests. That had absolutely was the fault of the Post Office; they routed the package wrong. However, I'm sure when this person gets the bracelet, she will love it!  I'd like one for myself!"

Looks sturdy and is a quality one, both inside and outside. I'm very happy with this purchase and would like to do other purchases from this seller in the future. I wish free shipping was available from this seller too."
5.0,Great fit for my LO
5.0,I love my new watch band... stretches to fit wrist and it made well

5.0,Classy looking and sturdy colorful polarized.
5.0,Perfect for wedding I was a bridesmaid in
5.0,I have had this watch for only a few days but so far I love it. It came in an attractive box and It has the look of a much more expensive watch and keeps good time. It is very easy to set and has a great looking band. I have had bad luck with watches in the past but so far this one seems like a winner.
5.0,Granddaughter loves the key chain
5.0,Gifted this to my boyfriend. We had to remove a few links as it was too big on his wrist but it’s a very slick watch
5.0,"nicely made, classy, sturdy"
5.0,I wore this to my Daughter Navy Bootcamp graduation!!Such a wonderful dress- Love the pockets!! Timeless!!
5.0,"Absolutely LOVE this dress! The color is bold and bright, and it fits just as expected. It does wrinkle easy, but easily fixed with a steamer."
5.0,The fit was pretty good. Overall good quality at a great price.
5.0,I got this wallet because the red ribbon keeps me from leaving anywhere without a card I use for work. I've had it for 2 months now. Others at my work liked it so much they've also purchased it. The wallet is compact and still as functional as a more traditional folding wallet.
5.0,very easy to use. I didn't use the glass dome and it came out perfect
5.0,nice quality fabric
5.0,I bought this for my cousin. She said it is a little big but super comfortable.  She said the material is soft and she absolutely loves it
5.0,Finally found boots my daughter can wear.
5.0,Kind of pricey for a keychain that doesn't even open beer bottles but my gf likes it and thats all that matters
5.0,"Used these for my sister's wedding for all the littles. Well-made, easy to use and fit multiple sizes from 3 years old up to eight is what she had in her wedding."
5.0,Lo único malo es que se afloja
5.0,My daughter loved it and its comfortable too!
5.0,For well and looked great only bad thing was the faux fur shedded but that was not a big deal!
5.0,Great quality and great price for my groom at our wedding. The colors were perfect. This is not a cheap quality tie.
5.0,I purchased this for riding my bike and keeping the wind out of my ears. It worked great. The band is tacked down at the bottom to keep it thinner while the top expands out to cover the ears and forehead. They were snug and stayed put but not too tight to cause a headache.
5.0,"We received 4 packs as described. 3 packs were all the same style, but they are a good value so we just gave some to a friend who is a fan. They are a soft cotton feel. They pilled a little in the wash, but it still looks ok."
5.0,"Good quality. I have a beige one I bought in 2010, the new one is heavier fabric and doesn’t form as well. But it will age with use"
5.0,I purchased the ring for my husband in honor of Veteran's Day.  The ring was absolutely beautiful.  He absolutely loves it!
5.0,I am in love with this dress. It is really beautiful and the material is so soft. It is one of the most comfortable dresses I have ever worn! I sized up from my normal size and am happy with how it fits.
5.0,"Even better than I had hoped.  The bottom is higher on the belly than shown which I am happy about, but if you want something lower than belly button this is not for you.  I am a size 12, but I bought a 14 because of most suits running small and it is perfect.  Finding swim suits that I am comfortable in, is a challenge.  I have a belly that I try to hide.  This is much better than I had thought it was going to be.  I absolutely love it!"
5.0,Exactly what we were looking for - a shirt with French cuffs for wearing cufflinks.  The ones that came with it weren't bad too.
5.0,"It glows as you wear it. Not sure if it's heat activated or what. At first I was disappointed because I couldn't find a button to push to turn it on, but wore it anyway because it's pretty.<br /><br />When I went into a darkened area a little while later and noticed it was glowing. It's so pretty."
5.0,Beautiful and very stylish!
5.0,Very nice well made case.. thank you
5.0,I ordered a Medium and it was a perfect fit!!! I got so many compliments... it was comfortable and super sexy...
5.0,"Looks great, fit as expected, but runs maybe a little small."
5.0,"Bought them as a Xmas present for m'lady; she doesn't like driving at night but has to drive home from work. She reports that they work really well, after a moment to get used to the change. Haven't tried 'em yet myself. Flip up's convenient, and she wears prescriptions so they're a necessity as well."
5.0,Very handy and nice size  Also attractive. Would like to have more color choices in the future
5.0,"2nd shirt from them just as good as the first, well made officially licensed and so far color has not faded and it goes with a lot"
5.0,The grid paper have half inch squares so these looked to me to be just over 1/2” wide and about 3/4 - 1” tall.  They are pretty in a Retro way.  I love colors that go with the my wife’s outfit.
5.0,more than price
5.0,Excellent gift.  Exactly what I wanted.
5.0,"A real Ray Ban, sturdy and picture was exactly as case."
5.0,I think that's the bigger size that you have and still wont fit me. ;-(
5.0,Ove
5.0,It's so hard to find clothes that fit perfectly my mail. But this was a great find! Thanks!
5.0,These are great. Needed a way to attach poop bag holder to an extendable leash and thought these would work. And they do. Perfectly. A friend saw them on our table and said he needed to separate some keys. We have so many for so little $$$ we said 'take as many as you want'. I'm sure we will find other fun uses too
5.0,"This product has a lot of unexpected detail for it's $16 price. It seems nowadays people expect an exorbitant amount of quality, detail, features, etc for a low price. If you are listing pros & cons on this product and it's price wasn't included on the pros side of your review, you are obviously not expecting anyone to take your review seriously. Go into your local Halloween costume store with $6-$8 to spend and I am 100% sure you aren't walking out with anything with the amount of detail that this product has. Amazon has a lot of customers that are looking for high quality products for under $20. Good luck with that. Can't buy Dom Perignom with Boones Farm wallet"
5.0,This was a Christmas gift for my oldest daughter and it was hit.
5.0,This bracelet is gorgeous. I wear it as an anklet and get tons of compliments. It's very sturdy and the gemstones are so pretty and bright.
5.0,"I like the dress, it is really good on my daughter and it fits perfectly."
5.0,got this as a christmas gift for my Father. very pleased with size and quality. highly recommended
5.0,Very good quality and I haven't had the opportunity to use more than one. I was a cheap girl before and never wanted to spend alot on navel piercings but now I realize you get what you pay for! This set is quality and I've never had one piece detach from the ring and become lost so that is a plus!
5.0,love this shirt! is very comfy and soft. will be proudly wearing this for a long time! GO BRAVES!
5.0,Ordered a Large.<br />Kinda snug at arms but my arms big.<br />I weigh 188 and 5’8<br /><br />I got so many compliments!!!!! I need it in every color
5.0,I liked everything about this hoodie for my grandson. Evidently someone at his school liked it too cause they snatched when he put it down. No worries I bought another!
5.0,Nice Shoe!
5.0,Love this color...product arrived quickly.
5.0,The will do fine thank you
5.0,"Used this to rewind time so I could see Endgame over and over for free.<br /><br />(In all seriousness - this is a well-built replica. If the price hasn't scared you away, you'll be pleased with the purchase.)"
5.0,My musician nephew loved this!
5.0,"This shirt is absolutely gorgeous! It fits perfect, the fabric is flattering and very nice. I love all the unique details, from the neckline to the little flare in the cuff @ the wrist. This has easily become my favorite top!"
5.0,It's nice having the size range to be able to pick exactly the size needed.  Chains are not bulky or overweight/oversize like most other brand extenders.
5.0,"Myra bags are outstanding. I have a duffle, this weekender and a small wallet crossbody. Talk about a wonderful travel set. Bags are sturdy and well constructed. I am a vintage farm house rustic kind of gal, so these fit right in with my style. I’m addicted."
5.0,great price for six five pairs of warm cozy socks.
5.0,Fantastic item
5.0,"I never post reviews but this piece deserves it! This cute little piece is entirely worth the price if you're questioning it's quality. The material is nice and comfortable. The straps are very adjustable and although the bottoms will ride up (my butt is on the bigger side), the material on the bottom is still comfortable, light, and stretchy! I was worried how it would look as I am an A cup but oh my gosh it's so cute on the top for small boobs too! I love this so much and it's so worth the price."
5.0,"This is one of my favorite products EVER.  You can squeeze so much stuff into a small space and keep it organized and easy to find.  I use this size in my skinny nightstand drawers.  They don't pull out all the way, and rather than digging around hoping to find something in the back, I just have three of these stacked up.  One for my makeup, one for my usb cords (too many of them) and one for pens/pencils/scissors/tape.  That still leaves over 3&#34; of space at the front of my drawer for two rows of vitamins.  After a year of use, and stretching some of the bands quite far, there has been no slack or stretching out of the elastic so far.  I've even used the small ones inside my purse (easy to find everything, but the rubber stitching in the elastics does sometimes make it a little harder to pull it out, it wants to drag on the leather opening of the purse).<br /><br />Some people complain in reviews that you can't fit much on it.  That seems true, at first.  There's a little bit of a learning curve.  You'll think &#34;darn, I can't get any more than a few things on here&#34; and you'll spend a lot of time rearranging things.  The longer or bigger an item is, the more it will get in the way of other items fitting in.  But with some practice and rearranging, you'll find a place for everything, and if you're good about putting stuff away on it, everything will have its place, and you'll get used to putting it all back exactly where it needs to go.  Right now on my 8x12 grid it, I have two of those headphone splitters (to use a headphone jack with two headphones), a sewing machine cord, an HDMI camera cord (annoyingly, it takes up a lot of room, because its so thick it will only curl in a circle, not a folded shape), an ipod usb cord, a thumb drive, the little plug tip for my Macbook, the box part of my Canon battery charger, a Canon battery, my fitbit charging station (the larger old style), a usb plug with a stupidly large L shaped plug end, the wire part of the Canon battery charger, and two other long usb cords.  It's not as perfectly neat as the Grid-It pictures, but it's fairly neat, and everything is easy to see and find. You can hold it and shake it vigorously, and nothing falls out, especially once you figure out how to best pack it all in.<br /><br />Mine doesn't have the nylon zippered pocket in the back, so I'm eager to buy some of these new ones with the pocket.  I suspect they'll only be good enough to store a pamphlet or a few folded papers, but that's fine by me.  I honestly can't tell you how much I love these things.  The smaller ones are really too small to do much (maybe fit in a purse), but the 8x12 sizes and up are just amazing.  If you're disorganized, an RVer, or live in a small space or a space with little storage, these are a must-have.  I promise, they're worth every penny.  I'm a really disorganized person, and this is a dream for me. I'd buy fifty more, if I could.<br /><br />My one criticism is that sometimes I feel like there are too many of the larger spans of elastic, and not enough of the smaller (1 to 1.5&#34;) spans. If you're storing big stuff (4&#34; across or more), why do you need so many?  You can only fit a few of those on there before you run out of room, whereas you can fit tons of small things and quite a few medium sized things.  Seems like sometimes all the best sized elastic spans are right under the only places to put the big stuff."
5.0,"I purchased this 3 piece bag set in white. Shipment took about 3 weeks. I've only used it about a few weeks and will update my review at a later time.<br /><br />PROS<br />- Sturdy craftsmanship. The largest bag has good body to it. The base and the sides stand straight, the handles are substantial and the strap looks like it will last a good few years. Again, will update at a later time. The two remaining bags have less body and are just meant to function as two lightweight bags to hold items in. I would use them with care if I want them to last longer.<br />- Reasonably sized. The largest bag is a size between a shoulder bag and a crossbody. The medium sized bag fits perfectly on one side of the division inside the larger bag. And the smallest is large enough to hold two pads and two tampons. Conversely you can use the smallest to hold all your go-to makeup. It would easily fit a concealer stick, face powder disc, and a lipstick or lipgloss with space for more. If used together, they would take up most of the space in the largest bag, with room for smaller items like sunglasses, a cellphone and maybe a small bottle of water. However, I find that there are enough internal divisions in the largest bag to warrant it being used on its own, allowing me to save the other two for other uses altogether. Really depends on what you are looking for.<br />- Amazing customer service (I had a problem with the smallest bag and I contacted the company upon receipt. They responded within 24 hours, and resolved the problem immediately).<br /><br />NEUTRAL<br />- The wristband on the smallest bag is attached via a lobster clasp. I'd advise you not to use this as a wristlet, because the lobster clasp *appears* a little weak. Mine broke upon receipt of the item. Again, I called customer service and they resolved this right away. Just be careful in case you're going out and think this wristlet will suffice, you might lose it altogether.<br /><br />Overall, amazing bag set and customer service. Highly recommend!"
5.0,"My son loved them, super cute design."
5.0,great with leggings !  nice material .. a little stretch to prevent having to iron.  So far so good.
5.0,I ordered these as a gift for a friend.  She loves them!
5.0,Very well made. I received compliments on this hat every time I wear it.
5.0,Quality product and nice design.
5.0,perfect length necklace. lots of compliments on tree of life thank you
5.0,"Soft, warm, the gloves are a good fit. Would purchase again."
5.0,I try to reduce my animal footprint  (no I am not a vegan) and one of the things that I am trying to cut down is my use of leather.<br />Plastic belts tend to look cheap so I was excited to find this cork belt.<br />I have been really impressed so far. It is wearing as I would expect a leather belt to wear and I am not seeing any signs of premature aging.<br />Terrific product
5.0,"I just wanted a little crossbody purse that didn't cost too much which would fit my iPhone 7 Plus with a shockproof case on it. And it does! If I had fewer keys on my keyring, it would easily fit my keys. It could fit a really small, flat wallet, but not mine, if the phone is in there. It is a perfect ""extra"" purse for taking a walk around the neighborhood."
5.0,"I bought one of these for a friend as a present.  She raved about it so much, I ordered one for myself.  I ordered the gray, because I have gray hair.  It is surprisingly flattering, and VERY warm!"
5.0,Ran a lil small but it’s nice
5.0,"Update : 2nd Review Date : 12/17/2020.<br /><br />First, its been quiet a ride with this watch over the past year.<br /><br />Pros<br />1. Saying that this is a rugged watch would be an understatement and an insult to this beast.<br /><br />2. I witnessed the time change automatically when travelling. It worked for me and was pretty cool! :)<br /><br />3. The compass works like a charm, there is always one situation every year where you need that one tool to make the day. Unlike hummingbirds, we suck at directions. I had memorized the compass degree to my house incase I know what heading to use when lost,and I used the compass to drive back home.<br /><br />4. I have been using the (2 Pack) Zshion Casio PRW-3500/PRW-3100/PRW-3000/PRW-2500 Screen Protector and has saved the screen of this watch, and I love it. So do get that screen protector.<br /><br />Cons<br />1. Timer does not suit my needs, but works in certain situations : let me explain.<br />Before this watch I used a casio SGW-100, and it has a timer that can be set and it can go off every 5 minutes, which I loved, which worked great for doing little chores around the house or going for a small walk. it worked great into implimenting small habits when timed. The PRW 3500 does not have that function which is the biggest con for me.<br /><br />2. If you are a one watch kind of person, then your other watches will suffer. I have tried to use this watch to almost every occasion except an interview. So Yeah, my other watches are R.I.P.  which means, times to sell:)<br /><br />3. Uncomfortable in certain situations : Recently I have started taking notes on my laptop, and the watch becomes a hindrance as it not only raises my left wrist when typing, but also when I move hands, the watch bands hit the edges of the laptop and my wrist gets bumped. It is annoying but I just take the watch off and admire its ruggedness right next to the laptop. (No product is perfect, I would highly recommend this watch, despite the cons I have noticed because it does the basic things really well, that I have documented in my previous review from last year).<br /><br />All in all, I would highly recommend this watch as a MUST, just like you carry your drivers ID and cash.<br /><br />I am posting more photos, and hope they do justice to this beast of a watch,<br /><br />Thank you for reading this far, Hope this helps you.<br /><br />Happy holidays and many fun days with this watch!<br />See you next year,<br /><br />Stay safe (W6W : wear a mask, 6 feet apart, wash hands)<br /><br />Fez.<br />----------<br />First Review<br /><br />I dont want to sound biased, but over the years I have learned, don't save the best for the last. I should have just purchased this watch when I saw it rather than spend money on other watches.<br /><br />Pros for me :<br />1. Simplicity at its finest.<br />2. Excellent Size, big digital screen with big numbers.<br />2. Rugged watch.<br />4. Pre-calibrated compass, stop watch and timer : all features that I use every day!<br />5. No battery changes<br />6. Atomic Time : Love the science behind that concept itself, which means that clock will adjust the time according to the time zone you are in. I have yet to experience this :)<br /><br />Thank you for reading."
5.0,"They're legit Aviators that block out the sunlight like a arc wielding mask and have that reflective surface for people looking at you, so you will look like a bonafide bad ass everywhere you go!"

5.0,shoes seem like they will hold up well.  We sized them at the store but they didnt have the style he wanted so bought here.  Were able to get our team colors.  Son loves them.
5.0,This would have been such a cute dress if it fit. 😕 I needed an XL in order for it to fit like the portrait portrayed.
5.0,Great Quality socks! My boyfriend is in Law School and has to wear suits regularly and enjoys getting to wear his obnoxious patterned socks! He has wide feet and they stretch great to accommodate his feet without the pattern looking weird. They are incredibly soft and he says they are incredibly breathable.
5.0,Very cute dress. Material has some stretch to it.
5.0,Very beautiful and very high quality. My wife loves it a lot. I strongly recommend this brand.
5.0,Super cute sun dress. Comfortable. Roomy. Flattering. Works well on curvy body. It’s longer on me because I’m short. Ankle length but still works.

5.0,"I love this  dress…I purchased the black.  I usually wear a XL, but I ordered 2XL since I didn’t want it tight and wanted it very flowy.  The material is not too thin or too thick. I wore with black tights, black knee high boots, and all silver jewelry. I got so many compliments.  I will definitely be ordering in different colors."
5.0,"I am in security and sit in a booth with no overhang, this helped protect my left arm from the sun."
5.0,"It fits perfect and the material is not see through. It’s actually a great material, the inner layer is very soft. I am 5’2” 108 lbs 36DD, a small size fitted perfect. Ordering more colors"
5.0,"The blue color is brilliant! It's well cut and is of course the funniest thing on a shirt ever! I've been laughing over this for 2 years when I purchased the same slogan/picture for a boyfriend and finally decided I had to have one myself. Based upon reviews, I went with a medium. I'm generally a small or medium and do prefer work-out garb a little larger, which is why I went with the medium. I wish I'd gone small as it is larger than I like/too much cleavage esp if bending over. So I'm hoping that this will actually shrink with the first wash and come out perfect, but I haven't washed it yet. I guess that means it's a true medium so don't listen to the reviews that say otherwise!"
5.0,It works!!!
5.0,I loved the purse. But way to small
5.0,I ordered this dress in o-neck-coral to wear as a guest to a wedding. The color is a beautiful shade and the fit is very comfortable. The fabric is much softer than I expected and it is very flattering on. I am 5'1 137lbs and I ordered the medium. The length hits right below the knee. This dress looks much more expensive than it is and I would absolutely consider ordering one in another color.
5.0,Wow! What an absolutely hardcore  Christmas sweater! So awesome 😍<br />Very well made and sturdy. My son received many compliments. Arrived very fast too! Excellent Christmas gift for my older son! 👍 🎄 Thank you!
5.0,"When product was broke, stem was broken off one earring and post bent on another earring, seller immediately replaced item.<br /><br />none of replacement earrings broken. No stems broken. Stems solid, sturdy, good on all 6 pairs of earrings. no posts bent on any earrings in replacement pair.<br /><br />return received soon after returning item and acknowledged. return very easy and efficient.<br /><br />These 6 pairs of earrings are unique, cool, and awesome!<br /><br />Very happy with earrings now and with good customer service."
5.0,i love this bracelet.  it is beautiful in the sun!
5.0,"These socks were purchased as a gift.  The product was very thick and the nonskid strips covered the bottom and appear well made.  These were purchased for an elderly gentleman, and I feel safe in him wearing them."
5.0,"Looks good and fits great. I'm a generous size 14. Based on the reviews saying the dress runs small, I got the 4XL and it fits loosely just the way I wanted. I wear leggings, boots and a belt with it."
5.0,"Great, love the weight of it!"
5.0,"I don't usually wear jewelry but as I am getting older I am finding that I want to. After purchasing and trying this on, it fits well, and attracts some attention. I was a little surprised to hear that some don't even know what a biohazard symbol is or means. But regardless it definitely is worth buying!"
5.0,Nothing wrong with it.
5.0,"Just received the Silky Embroidered Brocade Jewelry organizer and I love it! I bought 8 of them total, to give to my bridesmaids as gifts. I will be putting a bracelet and earrings inside for them as well. I know they will definitely get use out of the product and will just love it.<br /><br />Picture is very true to the actual product. Love the green color, is a little smaller than I expected, but will be perfect for traveling. The ring holder is great and I cant wait to try it out!"
5.0,"I bought this watch for my niece for her high school graduation gift. She loves butterflies and bling so this was perfect for her. She got lots of checks and cash for graduation which is certainly nice but mine was one of the few wearable gifts. She opened it, put it on and loves it. I really like it also and might get a similar watch from bling.com soon. It will need a few links taken out to fit her better but my bro can do that easily. I am really hoping now that the butterflies don't fall off like in other reviews. And I hope it keeps on ticking!"
5.0,Fits just perfect very comfy love this
5.0,my husband loves this shirt

The chain is delicate and dainty. Pearl symbolizes love, happiness and success ...we wish an abundance of each to this sweet young lady and to our son also."
5.0,Fits just like picture! The material is soft and so pretty.
5.0,"Love this skirt for going out, hiking or running errands.  Great for travel.. does not wrinkle.  I wear a small usually …but ordered a large in this because ran small.  Would order again"

5.0,Absolutely love this sweater. Soft not scratchy. True to size.
5.0,"Nice,warm and soft. Brought for pj day at school. And my child loved them"
5.0,"These are wonderful!! So comfortable, soft, and stylish! You get the look of jeans with the comfort of pajama pants! It doesn't get much better than this folks! I will warn you though, when you first get them (The ones with color from a dye, not the white ones) they have a strong chemical smell but if you just wash them a couple of times with either vinegar or oxi clean the smell goes away. They truly are worth the money and they are true to size. If they happen to be a little big, no worries! There is a draw string hidden on the inside that you can tie. They even look nice if you roll them up if you want to change the length a little. So glad I bought these! I liked them so well that I now own 3 pairs!"
5.0,"Ordered a small but still slightly too big. However, they are still very functional and comfortable."
5.0,I LOVE this bag! It’s roomy & well made with many compartments. I’ve gotten quite a few compliments on it as well. I love things that are whimsical & this definitely hits a high note in satisfactory purchases. The graphics on it are PHENOMENAL!!!

5.0,I ordered a medium. I’m 5’3 and weight 145lbs .the black and cheetah shirt is super cute.
5.0,"Great headband! I ran in a relay marathon so I needed a headband that would keep my hair out of my face and my earbuds in my ears, and to keep my ears warm. This headband worked perfectly! It stayed in place through my entire 6 mile run, wasn't too tight or too loose. Definitely recommend."
5.0,My sister loves them! Thanks
5.0,I love the dress!! It's a tiny bit big on me but I'm petite with a h sized bust and I really small waist. So getting the xl fits me really well with only little bit of too much room. But I love the dress and will continue to wear it with my heels!
5.0,"I love the Verdusa brand of dresses. They are so comfortable, they look great, and you look put together when you wear them.I bought this in two colors."
5.0,Just<br />Like it says.  Perfect
5.0,"These glasses fit me so well!  I'm more on the the petite size at 5'2"" and these are perfect - not too big or wide.  I put my prescription lenses in them and they are still lightweight, very stylish too!  Highly recommend."
5.0,Classy and comfy.<br />I recommend it.
5.0,Needed two springs for my Cub Cadet LT1046. These were a lot cheaper price than OEM and fit good.
5.0,"Love, love, love this purse!!"
5.0,Perfect and love them!!!!  I have to hide them from my 18 year old daughter.  :)
5.0,"There cycling pants are great. I love the texture and how they feel. I ordered a Medium based on the size chart provided but I feel I should have gone with a Large. Maybe I have thicker thighs but they feel a bit tighter than normal. If they were to shrink just a little bit, I wouldn't be able.to fit in them anymore. Other than that, I love them."
5.0,Love them just got them and put them on so sexy on me ... all my gay friends are gonna  be jealous I can’t wait<br /><br />Jay leyva

5.0,A great price for the perfect Tea Party Baby shower. Very well made. I purchased the 3XL based on the size chart. I usually wear a 14W or 16 W. Well made and comfortable.
5.0,"Great product! I was a little worried because I didn't know if they were going to be pure silver, as my ears are pretty sensitive to cheap metal, but no issues so far. They are comfortable to wear to sleep too, so I don't even need to remove them. Perfect for my double pierced lobes."
5.0,Perfect for my Veteran status.
5.0,Makes my black-and-white snakeskin boots really stand out. And the shiny little handcuffs are a good conversation piece. I could not be any happier with them.
5.0,These are great sunglasses. Much better quality than previous versions. They really do cut down on glare. They don't hurt my broken nose and they don't give me a headache. My only tiny quibble is they don't fit inthe sunglasses holder that is built in to my car.
5.0,Thums up!!!!!
5.0,Works well for kids... my son was ecstatic to receive these!

5.0,"A little snug (46-48&#34; chest), but for the price, it can't be beat."
5.0,"Got this for my son who was going snowmobiling in the Upper Peninsula in Michigan. The weather was cold and he was concerned with being warm enough to enjoy riding.  It did the trick, he said it was really warm. 🙂"
5.0,Mask is comfy & provides excellent coverage. I’ve already received compliments on it. I ordered 2 more!
5.0,It's regal. Affordable couture!
5.0,"I wear these for work, because I like functionality to also be fashionable. These protect my shins while using my weedeater so I don't have to wear long pants in the summer. They're surprisingly not hot in summer, but are also warm in the winter. Breathable material. Great color. Arch support is awesome!"
5.0,Teen
5.0,This was a gift for a family member and she loves it. The pendant is about the size of a quarter and not overly heavy. I have never seen her without it.

5.0,Very well made my husband loves it
5.0,Fast delivery and good product
5.0,Very cute earrings to wear with matching sweater!

5.0,Item is light weight. item runs a tad small compared to cotton polos.
5.0,❤️❤️ Love this dress. Nice and summery!  The large size fits me well. I am 167lbs height 5’6” bust 38ddd

5.0,Wonderful with simple black dress.  Pure artwork  Even earrings worn alone are winners.
5.0,I returned the watch did not like it. So I sent back the band it fit good and was a good band but would not the other watch I got.
5.0,"Can't wait to wear it this summer. Fav color, very cute and looks great with sneakers"

5.0,"I wear these constantly. A great, classic look (even on a teeny head!). Would buy this again in a heartbeat!"
5.0,Beautiful haven't stopped wearing them
5.0,Gorgeous gold bangle!!! Love the color of the 14 kt gold.  It is very pretty alone or add more because the price is worth it.
5.0,Nicely made and looks beautiful.  As with all my ear cuffs I had to spend some time experimenting with some different bends to get this to stay on my ear.  Not sure if others have this issue or if its just my ears!
5.0,Very light jacket
5.0,"I'm changing my review! These tops are worth the wait. The company was great at communicating a delay.  I now have different colors, worn all Summer. Easy to wash. Prefer line dry.  They're lite, comfortable and casual."
5.0,Super comfortable. I love how it fits at the bottom and is more flowie on top. I wish it was a little more off the shoulder but other than that it's awesome.
5.0,"We are jewelry designers, and use these in all our galleries to display our work. Plus, I have one for my extensive (well, yeah!) collection. Great size, holds lots of pairs. Good looking. Affordable."
5.0,Easily one of my favorite dresses now.  Fits great and the fabric is so comfortable!
5.0,Working watch.  Wasn't expecting that.
5.0,Comfortable for running and walking. Very good for the price. Bought 2 more pair after trying these.
5.0,I bought this as a last minute costume for a party...only had three days to find something and Mr. and Mrs. Smith was suggested for my boyfriend and I.  This dress is perfect for it.  The slit is high enough that I could wear a lacy garter with a pocket for my &#34;gun&#34; but low enough that I did not feel exposed.  The material is buttery soft but also clingy.  I did not realize this until it came in but the straps are also adjustable--YAY!  I am a 34E so I can NOT wear this as low as the model and was planning to hem the straps so I was very pleased by this.  It is unfortunate that I don't have anywhere else to wear this since its such a comfortable dress.
5.0,Well made and just the right size I love them!
5.0,Perfect! Amazing product!
5.0,Cool street wear pink pants. Very long in length and I have long legs. But they look great.
5.0,"These are very good sleeves. The only issue I had was that they repel water pretty effectively. To stay cool, I typically wet the arm bands down, which has a great effect.<br /><br />These stretch very easily, and quite a bit. I wear L/XL in other brands. These come out of the package too short to cover my fore-arms. However, as I pull them on, they easily cover my whole arm without forcing it at all. They simply stretch a lot, then go back to their original shape when I remove them.<br /><br />Initially, when I tried them on indoors, I was concerned that they felt a bit warm. However, using them eliminated that concern altogether. These were very cool compared to my back, under a light moisture-wicking shirt. I was able to wet these down by dowsing in water for a while before putting them on. Then, they worked even better.<br /><br />They provide a very light compression. For sun-covering and cooling, I'd certainly buy these again."
5.0,"I am 5'3"" and this dress hits me right at my ankles (an unusual find for someone my height) I wear on average a size 14 and this dress fit perfect and is not see thru. Loved it for patriotic day at school and will have many opportunities to wear it."
5.0,"Im 5’2 weigh 150lb and wear a D cup in bra size, so I got the Large. The swimsuit has padding and has great support in the breast area. I love it! ❤️"
5.0,I purchased this as a birthday gift for my little sister. She loved it!
5.0,"I love them, they're really cute and the acrylic material doesn't bother my sensitive ears. They are flared! So don't be upset or surprised if they're a little difficult to get in. That is just part of the design in this style of plugs."
5.0,Worked well to compress the veins in the lower legs.
5.0,This is a very nice case. I love the microfiber cloth. Highly recommended.
5.0,Absolutely love this bag!  Thought it would be a tad bigger but still holds everything I need!  Just love it!  The perfect shade of brown.
5.0,Looks great over the red corset
5.0,"I love the colors! I get a lot of compliments on them. I have some high-end funky dress shoes so I change out the laces every few days to refresh them and people love it. I'm a pretty conservative dresser, so the splash of color on my feet really comes off well."
5.0,This is well made and went perfectly with my Mad Hatter outfit. I couldn't be happier with it.
5.0,real silver where it every day
5.0,Nice pair of sunglasses for kids good quality for the price.
5.0,A replacement band for my Samsung gear s3 smartwatch. Fits perfectly. I really like it!
5.0,Comfortable and great colors
5.0,These slippers are very comfortable and warm. I wear a size 6.5 -7 shoe so that's the size I got. They fit very snuggly and almost too small. I would suggest going up a size.
5.0,The Miss Elaine robes and nightgowns are an exquisite line of clothing. This robe fits true to size. All details from the sewing to the extra added trims are beautiful. You will feel like royalty wearing this and it would make a wonderful gift. Well worth the cost.
5.0,"I got this dress in the blue and light pink in an effort to build my dress wardrobe. I tried them on today and I feel so comfortable and confident in them! I've never been one to wear dresses, but I'm wanting to start wearing more so I took a chance on these. The fabric feels soft yet sturdy, and the style of the dress is flattering and modest on my body. It covers everything I need it to cover and the length is perfect. If this dress came in other patterns besides what's offered, I would definitely buy more!"
5.0,cool hat that Yankees were on 4th. a must for true yankee fans. don't wear in Boston
5.0,I got these in the mail today and I love them! I understand they are made of wood and they won't all look the same so mine are a bit darker then the picture shown and the part that goes through the ear is the same color(the picture shows a ivory color) but none of these differences bothered me I think they're beautiful! Also they have a great polished finish on all pieces... I read a review with mentioning the possibility of splinters with these ... I don't see that happening
5.0,Feels like a t-shirt
5.0,"Easy to get to money, ID, and credit cards. Phone fits well inside. Very pretty, and easy to carry."
5.0,"Love this hat. Decent sound, good fit, cute style. Great product, great price."
5.0,True to size. Like it
5.0,"The water bottle earrings.  Was definitely light weight ,cute and durable and worth the money."
5.0,The bracelet was for my goddaughter for her baptism - was beautiful!
5.0,I can't really say anything about a show that I buy repeatedly other than I like them. It is a converse so ya know. Nothing new about them.
5.0,I just love these cute little earrings.
5.0,Wish I could buy all pairs in different color..very comfortable and look just like above.
5.0,Gave this to my mom on her birthday and she absolutely loved it. It’s simple but beautiful and the color is stunning. Highly recommend this bracelet and the price is awesome❣️
5.0,you can cut to any size
5.0,"I’m a skeptical amazon customer so i analyze the product fully before i get it, this being such a low price i thought it was going to be cheap but it’s pretty good quality, i bought it for my sister and i"
5.0,"Love this band! It’s casual/dressy, and super secure (that magnet is not coming undone). I was a little worried initially about the color not matching up with my Apple Watch base (rose gold) but it matches perfectly although the band isn’t straight from apple. This is a great product and you’d never know that I didn’t buy it from the Apple store, get this one and save yourself some money!!"
5.0,Much prettier than the picture. Pleasantly surprised. Love it!
5.0,This item is absolutely stunning. The quality is rich and most importantly my grandaughter looked like a Princess in it...I will buy again
5.0,I needed a light weight shrug to wear over sleeveless nightgowns . This is just the right weight and pretty too.
5.0,"Really pretty for such a great price...I'm about 5 ft so it wasn't short at all, right to the knee....looks like a much more expensive dress."
5.0,"I got this as a first birthday present for my little niece, it was nice quality, not flimsy. Had many size holes so she can wear it now till she’s grown. Engraving was beautiful, not cheaply done. They loved it!!"
5.0,It feels awesome. Also it's a little longer on the bottom which is great for talking in when you don't want it to show. This would be a spectacular if it had a thumb hole. On the long sleeve. But I will definitely buy it again.
5.0,"Slightly large but so comfy. Great top, looks exactly like the pic. I get compliments on this top all the time.  Did shrink up a little after I’ve washed it a couple times so now it’s almost true to size but I bet I could of bought a size smaller."
5.0,This among several Dallas Cowboys items is was a birthday gift for my son in June. He has enjoyed these footwear items.
5.0,Very pretty bracelet.  Would buy again.
5.0,Awesome product.  Would buy again.
5.0,Looks great and easy to adjust. Very comfortable. Easy to install.
5.0,Odd and plush. Do the job I hope.
5.0,Zapato muy cómodo
5.0,"I ordered these because I only have straight legged slacks and love the flared bottom look. These are crazy comfortable but are the perfect work casual look. I love the material these are made of. So soft! I'm about 125 lbs and 5'5"". I ordered the size small and they fit like a glove. I can dress these up for a more professional look or dress these down a bit more for a more business casual look. These slacks are the perfect addition to my work wardrobe!"
5.0,My son started playing youth baseball and needed a new cup.<br />He says it fits comfortably and it's saved him a few times already.
5.0,I bought this for my boyfriend and it looked so nice and he absolutely loved it. The packaging needed a little work so i put it in an old ring box and you couldn't even tell
5.0,Light and stylish! Like it very much!
5.0,"I've had this watch for three years, wearing it often in the kitchen or garden. I have found it unobtrusive and completely reliable and have even grown to appreciate what I see as its minimalist charm."
5.0,Fit my son perfectly!  He loves them and says they’re very comfortable
5.0,Good quality very well made
5.0,I bought for my daughter she loves them
5.0,"Gorgeous, trendy, comfy.  I need more pairs!!"
5.0,They are gorgeous and will be great when I do finally wear them.  I wish I would have gotten a size smaller because the strap doesn't hug my ankle as expected.  So I can say they run a little big considering there are no half sizes.
5.0,I love my waist trainer 😍😍😍thank u wonder beauty for this amazing product
5.0,Fits perfect nicely made very comfortable
5.0,My 4-year-old grandson is going skiing later this week.....he'll take these with him!  Soooo cute.  I know he'll love them.  This will be his first ski trip....he'll do his lessons and hopefully love it like the rest of the family!
5.0,I love these nose rings. I wish they would’ve come in a better package but that has no effect on the actual nose rings.
5.0,These earrings so so cute and such great quality! Ordering them in more Colors as we speak!
5.0,"Very pretty, runs standard size"
5.0,"Everyone asks me where I got these! Love them. They are the only no show socks that have stayed on with my loafers/flats.  Sometimes the lace by the toe gets a small hole, but I wear them everyday. Ordered 3 sets already!"
5.0,"Looks very classy, great size and I think it will fit a lot in it! Love the baby bag that comes with it, great buy!! Got another one for my Ma I like it so much!"
5.0,"While it’s not anchle lenght, it is very strechy, and really looks good! I’m wider at hips so I was a bit worried, it looks really nice and flattering! Versatile also!"
5.0,Good quality & bright colors
5.0,Fits great. I'm sad it won't let me submit a pic 😢
5.0,This replaced a broken buckle. Arrived on time and fit exactly as stated
5.0,"Excellent quality product with high quality material. Fit me perfectly, and is very comfortable to wear. It's hotter than Hades at the moment - first day of summer was yesterday, so it will be a while before I'll have any reason to wear this hoodie, but I can't wait for fall to come around with some cool weather that I can wear my hoodie out... If you're a Smith and Wesson fan/owner, you need to get yourself one of these! :)"
5.0,I love this. I did buy it a size bigger and it fits perfectly.
5.0,The fit & comfort plus ease of this front zipper makes this one of my new go to items. Originally purchase for pre and post op surgery it is surprisingly way more than I had hoped for. I do plan to purchase again.
5.0,"I love this dress. It's great material, stretchy and comfortable"
5.0,Love this top!! nice and easy! great for our Florida weather!!
5.0,I'm a girl that carries a small purse so the bulky case my glasses came with was no good. Especially if i want to take a pair of sunglasses and a pair of readers with me. My sunglasses are enormous but fit in here with room to spare. My readers have clip ons that i can store in the case with the glasses and a microfiber cloth for cleaning. These soft neoprene cases are just great.
5.0,"lots of room awesome bag, lots of pockets and storage room. best bag ive ever bought"
5.0,I bought these for my fianc&eacute; and he loves them he wears them everywhere he goes!! They are way comfortable! I expected them to come within 2 weeks we received them in three days way speedy shipping without paying extra!!!
5.0,"I simply LOVE this wallet, just what i was looking for ..."
5.0,"I used my glasses this morning, it was dark and raining.  I put the glasses on and they definitely made things better, took the glare off on coming headlights , it also felt like I wasn't wearing glasses they are so light. I would recommend to anyone that has a hard time with night driving and driving in the rain.They also come beautifully packaged too! I will be getting another pair for my husband for Christmas."
5.0,"Yes, it's worth it's high price. Actually warmer than dual layer smartwool beanie. Not too hot in mild cold. Comfy and light. Takes no space in my pocket. I've ordered the second one in black, the grey one is already appropriated by my family :)"
5.0,Bought as a gift. She loves it.
5.0,EYE love it!<br />seriously though.
5.0,"I love every second of this bag! It's so cool, functional, and a great size"
5.0,"I ordered 2 sizes larger than I normally wear, because I like to layer my clothing. I can't believe how soft and nice these sweaters are. I ordered the black one and the Navy blue one. Both of them are true in color, at this price I will be ordering more."
5.0,"I was glad to find these on Amazon, though if you're buying more than one pair, it sometimes makes sense to buy it directly off the Intimissimi site as they often run Buy 2 get one free sales. But wherever you purchase them, I imagine, it's worth the money. I gave up on Victoria's Secret and the like, long ago. I have panties leftover from the 90s that are still in good shape, but VS and most Dept. Store brands rarely last a full year -- falling apart in the washing machine and losing their shape. These, however, are fabulous. They last, they fit and they're as comfortable as they are flattering. Seamless, too, so their practically invisible with even the snuggest skirts and pants. My new go-to thongs, and in the long run they really do save you money."
5.0,I bought this for my friend.. She loved it! It fits perfect.. The material is not hard and uncomfortable.. It's exactly the same as the picture!
5.0,Very Cute and Fits Well
5.0,"The quality of both the apron itself and the printing were both way better than I expected for the price!!!<br />Wifey loved it. All territorial and such. Lol<br />Thanks, the kid loved her reaction!"
5.0,"My girlfriend loved this gift since we only have one child, its great for a mother/child gift"
5.0,I really like these. I only wish they were a little thicker or had more tummy control. I will probably order another pair when the weather gets warmer.
5.0,"It's lightweight the band is not stiff It's flexible. You would need a smaller wrist for this watch. It has just what I need the day, time and date. Now at work I can just look at my watch, instead of trying to figure out what day on the week it is and also I do not have to look at the computer to get the time. This watch is great for everyday use."
5.0,I have 4 of these in different colors/prints.  Love them all!  They wash great and are so soft to wear to bed.  I  plan on buying more.  My experience is they hold there shape and color through years of washing.  Would recommend.
5.0,This is a lovely shawl! The fur is soft and does not have a plastic feel at all! The whole thing is luxurious. I would suggest having something on hand to pin it with because where the sewn in hook is located is a bit on the high side for my taste.
5.0,The colors are sharp on this sweatshirt.  The size is perfect and doesn't run small like I see other places.  The navy is beautiful too and not faded.  It is a gift and one that I know will be liked !
5.0,Loved it. It's beautiful and fits perfectly. The pleats were bigger than expected but still a great skirt!
5.0,Little big on my daughter but she's petite and I don't mind a bit. These are the SOFTEST socks I've ever bought for my daughter for fall/winter. I looked at many different brands and pairs before deciding on these and I am so glad I did. I wish they were available in more colors. Other than that they are perfect. Will buy more!
5.0,my friend loved them
5.0,BEATIFUL as the picture!
5.0,Bought for my husband he wears everyday a great buy
5.0,Love this crossbody. The side zip which makes the pouch wider was very helpful. I love the look of the bag and it held all that I needed and more.
5.0,"Love the shirt!  Very comfortable!  Not to big not to small, just right!"
5.0,"As with all Filson products, this one is top notch. High quality and superior detail"
5.0,Beautiful!!! my daughter is delighted with the earrings
5.0,What a great invention!  I can keep all the cards and cash I need in this slim little pouch.  This is by far the best wallet I have ever owned.
5.0,"bought as a gift for my mother! she loves them, thanks so much &#60;3"
5.0,"Okay, this is A VERY nice set! It wouldn't hurt to size down for the ideal fit, but the quality of this is a very pleasant surprise. Again, I will quickly emphasize that the size ordered is slightly bigger than I would expect (see picture to reference fit), but the fabric is thicker than I expected and the seams/stitching is very neatly done.  Also, the bell-bottoms are TOO cute, flaring out just enough. I got the pale blue and maroon set and I'm very happy with this purchase."
5.0,"The chrome wrist band gives the Superman Logo, and the dark blue back ground behind it the perfect effect that I was looking for in this watch! Many people have noticed it, and think it looks pretty nice! I am asked where I got it? I let them know I found it on Amazon.com!"
5.0,Awesome dress. Worked great for being pregnant in the winter and still wanting to be cute. It works great not pregnant also! Win win!
5.0,Great fit. Durable material but still comfortable. Where it all day and it doesn't cause any discomfort or those weird red lines like other hats. It has the clamp style fastener in the back instead of the button which I think is more comfortable and holds the size better. All around great product. I wear mine every day.[[ASIN:B071KK61L8 You're Too Close Embroidered Dad Hat 100% Cotton Baseball Cap For Men And Women]]
5.0,"I was a little scared to buy this after reading some of the reviews, but I was actually pleasantly surprised. The material is actually a pretty sturdy, comfortable knit. The neckline is so modest and comfortable. I’m 5ft 3in and about 100 pounds, and the length of the dress hit me about the middle of my kneess. The dress fit me perfectly! The color is also so lovely and flattering. Overall this is a great dress for such a great price."
5.0,These little guys are awesome. Always make sure the clips are closer as opposed to farther apart. They seem to work better that way.
5.0,Very well  made!!! Perfect for old fashion Sunday at my church!!
5.0,Love this dress it's so pretty and comfortable!😍
5.0,"Very pretty, classy and easy to use"
5.0,They are so CUTE. The size is great not to tight or loose.  They have not faded at all. I will order some more.  I am so please.
5.0,Very  elegant piece of jewelry.
5.0,If you know how to choose asian size you are good!
5.0,Very nice looks just like the picture
5.0,El producto es exelente...pero me pareces que la caja se merece una presentación mejor para estar a la altura del producto...
5.0,"Great suit, great price! Exactly what I was looking for"
5.0,SUPER CUTE! The material is well made and the length and color are perfect.  Looks great on me. Thanks!
5.0,"Pretty little socks, very comfortable and can not be seen when wearing my shoes. Love them and will be ordering more! Highly recommend!!"
5.0,Excellent and cute face mask. Covers a lot of your face. Which to me is a good thing.
5.0,Haven't worn it yet since my hiking season hasn't started yet but love the fabric.
5.0,Many complements whenever I wear this item. Looks very regal & high quality
5.0,Love this stuff! Easy to use and made my beat up converse look brand new.
5.0,The ties were a gift and the recipient loved the colors.
5.0,"This is a very comfortable hat, and I look forward to owning and using it for a long time.  The color is also great as I was looking for something a little different from all the others on the shelf."
5.0,Perfect sized Dopp/toiletry bag.  Very nice red interior lining.  The exterior construction appears and feel to be of great build quality.  I work 24 hour shifts and needed a new bag for all of my necessities.  This fits the bill perfectly.
5.0,It is absolutely lovely. I really enjoy it.
5.0,Fit as expected. Loved the fabric.
5.0,Great shorts run a little small.
5.0,Bought for a gift  Well received
5.0,"The package arrived quickly, and the shoes look of good quality. Very cute shoes and light functions are in working condition. So far so good!"
5.0,I was so glad to find pants that have a usable tie on them. My grandson is tiny and he needs this type of fastening.
5.0,"I wore this dress for my baby shower and it was perfect! I hate ordering clothing online especially now being pregnant and all but to solve that problem I measured myself and compared it to the measurements they have in the description for each size.<br />In other reviews people are stating the dress is too baggy and big, it is a looser fitting dress obviously. I think to avoid going to big just simply measure.<br />However, the dress is seriously soft and I loved the way it fit. And who doesn’t love a dress that has pockets!?"
5.0,The belt is high quality material and craftsmanship. Money well spent and the packaging is cool too.
5.0,"Oh my, this is a beautiful charm. Brings a smile. Not overly large. Looks great on my bracelet!!<br />Adds glimmer and color :-)"
5.0,Love these  Made well and not too thin
5.0,I love the new masks. They are really lightweight. They are kinda big so I pin it in the back. But amazing none the less!
5.0,LOVE IT!!  Beautiful gift box with prayer card!
5.0,looks like honda made it......
5.0,Exactly what I’ve been looking for. I’m growing out of the skinny Jean stage but every bell bottom or boot cut jean is too long for my legs. But this has far surpassed my expectations. They hug you in all the right places while allowing me to slightly switch up my style. Highly recommend.
5.0,I use this product to go to church
5.0,"Like this product so far, although I have not worn or washed.<br /><br />Update:  wonderful customer service with this company I had an issue and the company got back to me very quickly and resolve the issue I would highly recommend the product and also the company"
5.0,"I just want everyone to know that even though my coat didn't fit, the seller called me all the way from China TWICE to make sure that I was happy. PLEASE! Before you write a negative review, be sure to also include the positive parts, like the seller refunded me my money and/or sent me a free return label, etc. This seller called me all the way from China TWICE to make sure that I received my refund. I loved the jacket, it didn't fit, but the color and the lightweight fabric would have been great for summer. The price was 18.99, a very fair price for this coat."
5.0,"Perfect for travel. My 10 year old used it on our summer trip to an amusement park and beach. She fit her ipad, snacks, water bottle, sunscreen, money and souvenirs. It was still small enough to carry around comfortably."
5.0,"Cute, quality made."
5.0,"I can find no fault with this rhodium-plated brass Cuban chain men's bracelet.<br /><br />Apparently, rhodium offers some scratch resistance, and it sure is shiny!<br /><br />The bracelet also has a nice heft to it -- not too much, but enough to feel substantial.<br /><br />I had some trouble putting the bracelet on the first time, until I discovered that you can push the latch closure into the ""eye"" at the other end of the chain. In other words, you don't have to hold the latch open with its teensy tiny lever to ""achieve closure.""<br /><br />The ""one size fits all"" is a little large on my wrist -- I think my wrist is about 7-1/2 inches, but it's not a big problem.<br /><br />Last but not least, the manufacturer includes a drawstring storage pouch, which is handy. All for under twenty bucks!<br /><br />So I give this Cuban link bracelet two wrists up, and I think you will too."
5.0,These earrings are beautiful! Exactly what I wanted.
5.0,I love the way it fits. Can be tucked in or left out. The arms are perfect. Love this shirt. I wear it at the office and at home.
5.0,Bought it for my little brother he loved it
5.0,Excellent condition & all different kinds and designs!
5.0,yessssss
5.0,Keeps your head and neck warm
5.0,"Bought this for an international carry-on. It fit under seats of Delta, United and Easy Jet flights. Very light weight and easy to maneuver. I’ve stared using it for monthly work travel rather than a shoulder laptop bag (my back & shoulders love it!). The trolley sleeve makes it easy to maneuver with larger suitcases (carry on and checked bag), so I don’t have to drag two pieces of wheeled luggage. The pull-up handle could be a little sturdier, but after a year of use 1-2 times a month, it hasn’t shown any wear, so it must be ok! My 13” laptop fits nicely in the sleeve, but you have to tuck the laptop sleeve into the bae of the main compartment to make it fit."
5.0,"Sweet bands. I like junk brand bands bc of their designs, but these work just as well!"
5.0,"Love this hat, and everyone keeps asking me where I got it from. Material is heavy and sturdy. Stitching is perfect. Colors pop. It’s my go to hat now."
5.0,"I bought a mens large and medium, and 4t. All fit perfect, are soft, and warm. I only wish they had one in baby sizes!  We are wearing them to a christmas party and I know we will look great, and be cozy, warm, and comfortable!  Plus, will be great for Christmas morning."
5.0,well made and very cute arrived way before expected will definitely purchase from them again
5.0,I love these briefs.
5.0,"Fits great, looks nice, super comfy"
5.0,Cute charmes I've been putting them on keychains iv been making there sturdy very cute
5.0,Works like a charm !
5.0,"What's to dislike, nothing.  Would make a great gift, but I needed it b4 FATHER'S Day.  Fit is great, fast shipping and affordable, highly recommend."
5.0,I am very pleased with this scooter - a bit heavier then expected and I had ordered the litho battery and was shipped the other but Living Well took care of me without cause.  So very happy and quite fast for a scooter
5.0,Got this for after my shoulder surgery and it's a lifesaver. Really soft and the snaps are easy to do with my non-dominant hand. Wish they were a little cheaper so I could afford two
5.0,sexy and nice
5.0,My daughter loves them. They are comfortable and cute.
5.0,Great sizing and great quality!
5.0,"it's beautiful, it's big, the materials are solid if I have an issue it's that it could use more pockets but I like the design and the feel too much to care about that."
5.0,these work great.  a well thought out product.
5.0,"Large shoulder bag, great for winter. Fits nicely on my shoulder even with a winter jacket."
5.0,Looks great in got both goes and sliver
5.0,This is adorable! Comfy and warm.
5.0,"I got this necklace wayy sooner than I expected, which was awesome! I thought I had to wait at least 3 werks but it arrived in 8 days! The key was slightly smaller than I thought, but I'm glad it wasnt too big and clunky. It doesn't come off the leather chain part because the ends are big, which is good. I didn't get a pouch, but it was attached to a cardboard picture of Attack on Titan background, so it looked new and good! The key is about an inch and a half long and rests near my collarbone, but if you want a longer chain I suggest buying it separately. Overall loved this product and I'm very happy with it!"
5.0,Very good to work with
5.0,I am in constant need of black or red polo shirts. I own a Cafe and we wear them as our uniform tops. I decided to get the Utopia Wear men's XL polo. Here's what I like about it.<br /><br />*100 % cotton<br />*soft<br />*nice stay put collar<br />*covers with out being to long<br />*ample arm size<br />*nice pearl buttons<br />*machine wash<br />* great price<br /><br />I wear a polo shirt nearly everyday. This is a particularly nice shirt. It a soft cotton such speaks to the high quality materials. I love that it's a rich midnight black. I have some lessor quality shirts that I have ordered online they came in blue gray. I am comfortable wearing it and can do my job beautifully in it. That's worth the money. I do recommend this great polo for everyone.<br /><br />I purchased this for a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review. All the opinions expressed here are solely my own.
5.0,"Nyesha Lovez Jersey Bling!, Got my earrings today and they are fab! They also send me earrings for free that are hot! I love Jersey Blingz Company, I for sure recommend, customer service is beyond great! xoxoxo<br /><br />Nyesha Valentin........."
5.0,Super cute. Nice fit. A little loose. I overestimated my size.
5.0,"One for Mom and one for me.  It's great!  Takes some getting used to, but does the job!  Not very pretty...other colors would have been nice."
5.0,Looks so great! Looks identical to his fossil watch. Bought it for a gift for my bf and he wears it all the time. Highly recommended
5.0,"I LOVE my shirt. It fits great, looks cute with jeans or leggings, and is super comfy ☺️"
5.0,"This dress is very comfortable.  The colors are vibrant, the workmanship is good.  I sized up so the dress is flowy rather than clingy.  I adore the convenience of pockets."
5.0,Love the color will order more.
5.0,"Don't let the words &quot;Danish death metal band&quot; in the album description intimidate you. This is by far better than any Nordic clone band that sounds like a 3rd quality copy of In Flames. As far as I saw in a picture these guys seem adult enough not to wear stupid clown masks, facepaint and carry axes to be a death metal band.<br />The music is also awesome. Has the feel of early Pantera and Metallica but is in the same league as Dark Tranquillity. In fact if you like DT or early In Flames don't miss WS. There is only one bad thing that can be said: the album is too short but then you can always replay."
5.0,"I bought these, paid for them, for my mom. She has wears 38 EU shoe, and the socks fit her well. The material weave feels &#34;snuggle-ly soft & warm, and toes can breathe&#34;. The print is cute, colours bright, and seams well sewn up. So, win-win as a light weight cooler weather sock."
5.0,I bought 2 of these the colored one for my daughter and the black & white for my son I love them❣ cant wait to see there face when they open them!
5.0,I got this for the purpose of turning it into a kilt pin. Now I have had some brothers asking me if i could make one for them.
5.0,Very true to size. Durable and comfortable
5.0,This is my favorite G-shock so far. I was hesitant about the negative display but it is decently easy to read. The led back and side lights have fantastic illumination in low light. The Bluetooth connection makes using features so much easier. I have an older model that has so many features I constantly have to look up the manual. With Bluetooth and the app the features are simple to use. The solar charging and accuracy are a great plus. The company I ordered through Amazon was outstanding in service. The watch came from Japan because I couldn’t get the green model locally. This is a cool price and upgrade. Great value for the price.
5.0,Beautiful just wrong letter
5.0,"I know packaging doesn't effect performance but these come packaged like a 200 dollar pair of glasses. It makes you feel good about the product and the people who make it. I have now had these for a year and have had no issues with them. I use them for cycling where not having a frame around the bottom helps when you are looking behind you. I find them comfortable while wearing a helmet when straps can sometimes cause issues, but I realize comfort is a very personal thing. They are the most inexpensive glasses I own and I really can't tell a difference. They are solid and perform as expected and that's good enough for me."
5.0,Super cute and they fit well. I am a size 9 womens. Adds a bit of flare to any outfit.
5.0,It is very comfortable and beautiful.
5.0,Somewhat too small.  I will have to slim down a little.  I should have purchased a 36&#34;
5.0,My son wears an XL and this hoodie fits on just right the quality and fabrics are really nice. The color maroon looks very nice as well Would definitely recommend this product
5.0,"This bra is EVERYTHING! I have a bra from Forlest that’s almost exactly the same, including the jelly gel…the “almost” is bc there’s one very important difference between the two, and that’s the accuracy of the band sizing.<br /><br />I’ve learned the hard way that it’s risky to order bras online, so when I saw that this was so similar to the Forlest (which was my favorite up until this I put this one on), that took some of the risk away as I already knew (or at least was pretty sure) the sizing would be similar. The Forlest ended up being a bit too tight in the band, to the extent that it became uncomfortable after wearing it all day, but I didn’t care, I was still in lust with it.<br /><br />With this one, that problem is obliterated – the band measurements are 100% more accurate and it fits perfectly, there is ZERO pinching and/or discomfort! I actually wear this on the last row of hooks (the smallest the band goes), and it’s perfect.<br /><br />It’s very heavy duty, there’s no daintiness or sexiness about it at all, which is a good thing (at least for me). It’s got wide everything…straps, band, side panels, 4-hook wide back panel and closure, etc. - this bra isn’t messing around! As with the Forlest, the jelly gel is my favorite part of this bra, it gives you tons of support AND it feels amazing. I’m 5’3 and 130 lbs, and right now I’m between a 38 or 40 DD…I got this in the 38DD. If I’d gone with the 40, it would’ve been too big, but luckily that wasn’t an issue!<br /><br />The cups fit perfectly, the side panels adequately smooth the underarm area, and the straps are very comfortable in that they don’t dig in to my shoulders at all. One thing, though…just like the Forlest bra, for some reason the straps make the tops of my shoulders sweat, but only the tiny spot that’s covered by the straps. Super weird!!<br /><br />The outer material is smooth and soft, feels great on your skin and is very high quality. It’s also very well made.<br /><br />The jelly gel is great for boobs that are starting to sag (or are already sagging), it gives you some shape on the top half in addition to hoisting them back up to where they’re supposed to be. Overall, as long as you don’t mind the sweaty straps, I’d absolutely highly recommend this bra!"
5.0,"Wonderfully soft, especially after washing. So pretty and feminine!"
5.0,perfect fit.  Pretty standard sizing. The blue is a bit darker than the picture but it is exactly what i was hoping for.
5.0,They are light and very comfortable too wear like them so much i hav bought 3 more pair and will buy again and again and they  got here fast on the shipping
5.0,These are unique and look really cute on!
5.0,"Great lightweight hat that's super comfortable, stays in place and goes with just about everything"
5.0,"Perfect dress, very comfortable!"
5.0,Cute! Good quality & price. Arrived 9n time. A lil tighter than i expected but still fit alright.
5.0,"Love Love Love this dress. It fit perfectly and looked great. The belt was pretty loose, so I cut off the buckle and did a little fixing but I am very happy overall."
5.0,"I like the idea of 3 cleaning cloths. One for my husband, one for me, and one to share or save. Works well."
5.0,Love this back and works great
5.0,"I paid about $11 for this belt. It is double sided, Brown and Black, has a nice buckle which allows the belt to be cut down in size for a perfect fit. It comes in a very nice presentation box, so it makes a very nice gift. To top it off, they give you a punch to make additional holes in the belt. Very good value."
5.0,i totally am satisfied with this item
5.0,"Light and warm vest. I love how versatile this product is, since you can store it on its own pocket and use it as a travel pillow. Totally recommend this vest."
5.0,"I bought this set as a little present for myself....I love studs and the yellow ball studs feel great and are just the right size...with it comes a matching bracelet, necklace and ring...they look terrific together and also look great by themselves!<br />I have had many compliments on them separately and together!  You can't lose on this one...."
5.0,"The sweater is absolutely beautiful! I ordered my normal size and it was small. Fortunately. It fit my sister, so she has it and loves it. The quality is excellent and the color is rich and vibrant."
5.0,very nice item. this flat in London is now retired but I have a lot of items I collect and do like them. so this was a good find for me. thank you.
5.0,I love a slim wallet and this one fits the bill without limiting a reasonable number of cards. Before adding cards this wallet measures only 1/2 inches thick.  Its semi smooth surface resists scratches and should be easy to clean.  The Two-sided ID window is a plus.  Plenty wide enough to show ID without removing.  The RFID feature is is pretty normal now and this wallet comes with this protection.  The stitching is perfect as is the quality of the leather.  The gift box is nothing to write home about but it's okay.  Easy 5 Star.
5.0,"These things were perfect for my toddler! Nice and warm, easy to put on, and cheap enough that I didn’t care that they got destroyed! Wish they came in larger kid sizes for this great price!"
5.0,I love 90 degree leggings.. I practically live in them. They are so comfortable and move really well with you.
5.0,My 4 year old girl loves Sofia and these were perfect for her feet. Well made for the price. She wore them to school and to bed. They stayed up with no issue. Washed them and did not get shrunk.
5.0,i bought this about a  year ago and its still holding up. its cute simple and lightweight. Perfect everyday cardigan i was looking for. I would recommend this product.
5.0,They were as described but was too small
5.0,"I love this but it is somewhat a bit smaller than I expected. It still fits adequately and I  am keeping, a going to order other colors, wondered if the unexpected % card would work if I order several at once! 5/5&#34; and 185 lbs."
5.0,My son love's it it is solo cool to have different color
5.0,"I am extremely pleased with this wonderful piece of jewelry.  It is solid and of a good weight, not light weight or cheap as in an aluminum based alloy, it is instead pleasingly hefty. And instead of having a cheap jump ring at the top, it has a really nicely crafted and shaped turn ring at the top, that hangs it beautifully on any chain that I wear it on. For the money I really couldn't believe what I had received. A lot of jewelry on the internet is cheaply made and can be disappointing. But this piece is of excellent quality. Thank you So Much, Amazon, and especially Toucan, who retailed it."
5.0,absolutely adorable<br />great value<br />would definitely purchase again
5.0,Get tons of compliments on them every time.
5.0,So far so good my child likes them
5.0,Indeed..... will buy more!
5.0,I bought this for my 12 yr old some as his first watch. He loved it! He is also in Boy Scouts and this time piece fits in with his uniform. Overall He is very happy with his first watch and so am I!
5.0,Great quality thick fabric and very flattering fit. I usually order an XS but ordered a small based on the review and could have probably done XS. The fit is slightly loose but comfy and I won’t be running in this bra anyway. I took the pads out because I’m flat chested and want to be that way. That being said the padding wasn’t very thick and it was natural looking. I got the purple order another color and try the XS but again the small fits good. I’m 105 lbs and 34A
5.0,"Love it, think that was a little bigger<br />But reslly nice"
5.0,Ok...love love this dress!  Bought this for my five year olds piano recital.  The dress is beautiful and price can't be beat!  Had no issues with the dress!  Fit was perfect and received lots of compliments.
5.0,It is a very nice quality shirt..... very soft and very very cute.
5.0,clean well made use it daily people ask all the time about it love it
5.0,"Great value for the money, does exactly what I purchased it for. Runs a little tiny bit large in the neck area. Lightweight and very comfortable for working out."
5.0,"Neckline was a little more narrow than I pictured, but the dress is the exact color and good quality."
5.0,My daughter used it for ComicCon... XS worked well for her (12 yrs).
5.0,This is well-made and perfectly suited the 1960's costume I needed it for.
5.0,"Beautiful, charming. I love it."
5.0,Charms fall off.
5.0,"Very fast delivery & love color, beyond expectation"
5.0,"This is such a great dress! At this moment I can not think of one thing that I dislike about this dress. The material is perfect for the design, not too light but not heavy, with lots of movement. The fabric is not see through although it is thin. It drapes so perfectly over your body in such a feminine way. I'm an almost perfect hourglass and it was so flattering to my figure! My measurements are 36&#34;-26&#34;-40&#34;. I'm 5'4&#34; tall and I ordered a size small and the fit was phenomenal! It touches the floor without heels on but that's how I personally prefer it as I think this dress would look best with a good heel! I got so many compliments on it and everyone wanted to know where I got this great dress! I stitched up the slit in the middle for modestly but that in no way took away from the movement of the dress. One stitch was all that was needed. I love this dress and highly recommend it, especially if you're a curvy girl!!"
5.0,"My boys love these, perfect to hang on their backpack!"
5.0,Comfortable fitting and cute.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:5f3ed12de750970086739983af370751]] Loved it
5.0,There nothing to dislike I love the carterpy<br />They could come in a bundle that would be<br />a fair price three pair for $11paying $11 for one pair is costly Thanks amazon
5.0,"Absolutely am happy with the shipping time, Sooner then thought, and the picture is super clear!!"
5.0,Excellent ear warmers.  Comfortable and warm.

5.0,Super cute yet very simple<br />Very thoughtful gift
5.0,Love this. So pretty and comfortable.
5.0,I love it. It comes with a tool that makes it easy if you have to take a link out. It took me a little bit to find the right size band for my watch. It was worth trying those other bands to get to this one.
5.0,This is a beautiful rosary
5.0,I received this Coil Set very quickly and i Love them! I can hardly wait to use them in my (non-beard) Braids to the heavy metal concerts I'll be attending next month and in the future!

5.0,This was a gift for my mother and she loves it! 🙌
5.0,"Great price for great quality hats! Stretch well (won’t be tight on baby’s head) and love the colors. My only complaint is that the 0-36month size is definitely too big for my 3 month old, had to roll it basically in half to fit his little head - probably will fit a toddler better. Definitely will be keeping for when our little one gets bigger!"
5.0,Loved the big bear!
5.0,I LOVE these pants! So comfortable and light!
5.0,Fit well.  Just as described.

5.0,Están muy bonitos para un regalito.
5.0,Ordered these to go with my Halloween dress. (It was black and white and had a spider web print on it). The tights fit perfectly and were very opaque. Definitely would order these again in other colors.
5.0,The winning Christmas gift!! 7 yr old thought it was best gift ever!!!
5.0,Glasses are nice for the price!
5.0,Get  many compliments.
5.0,"This dress is every bit as cute in person. The quality is fantastic. I bought it for a friend, and she said it fits like a glove. It's her new favorite dress. The color is pretty much right on what it shows in the listing photo, which is always nice. The listing photo makes it look like it might be a bit sheer, but it really isn't. The bow can go in the front or the back, as shown in the photo below. I can't even get over how cute this dress is. It would look adorable with flats, or low heels. Pair it with an apron for a perfect 50's housewife ensemble. It would be great for everyday wear, or even for a retro or pinup photo shoot.<br /><br />I received a discount code for this dress in exchange for my honest review."
5.0,SO THESE SOCKS ARE SUPER WARM. I WEAR THEM EVERY NIGHT WHEN I AM GOING TO SLEEP
5.0,"LOVE these dresses. I own a few in the different designs. All the sizes have been consistent! I'm 5'5, 155 pounds and got a medium and it fits perfectly. Not tight at all. I like to pair them with a waist belt right where the 2 fabrics meet otherwise it looks a little awkward."
5.0,Simple & clean design - great daily go-to
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful! My favorite color is purple, match that  with my love of turquoise and I have the perfect ring<br />Fits perfectly & very pretty"
5.0,Fits well seem good quality
5.0,This hoodie was for my granddaughter. She loves the fit and brightness of the tie dye. The fabric is very soft.
5.0,Love the size...its HUGE  and looks gorgeous on a hat or pin
5.0,These socks are amazing.  I'll be ordering more.  Everyone loves them and asks where I got them!
5.0,I received them on time and they are very pretty.<br />I like them very much. What a great deal.
5.0,✌👍👍👍👍
5.0,Does the job safe and secure
5.0,My 8yo is a fan of this anime and asked me to purchase this T-shirt for him. The material is soft and washes nicely.
5.0,My daughter loves this. It is a great material.
5.0,So glad our grand daughter taught us how to buy on Amazon.com.  We shop at home now and love the convenience and the selections.
5.0,This bracelet is beautiful!!!  I absolutely love it.  It is wide just so you know.  But just gorgeous!
5.0,They really help on dreary rainy days
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it!<br /><br />The ring is a nice thickness. It's sturdy enough to hold up to daily wear and tear at his full time retail job, as a manager, moving shelving and merchandise daily.<br />It's been several weeks and there seem to be no visible scratches so +1 star!<br /><br />I believe the sizing may run just a tiny bit small? Maybe I simply ordered the wrong size. Who knows.<br /><br />Overall this was a great purchase. Thank you for such a wonderful men's ring!"
5.0,Perfect fit and super comfy and soft.
5.0,"It's perfect, just like the picture."
5.0,"These goggles are excellent! Very comfortable, protective, and can be used while wearing glasses!!"
5.0,"I'm a woman and was looking for a good lookin leather bag the wasn't too expensive to transition from a large backpack I used daily to the bare minimum. This bag has lot's of storage and is roomy for its size. The bag was damaged, but I contacted the seller and they sent another out. It is a great bag and looks great!"
5.0,Llego el mismo que pedi
5.0,"I love this product, I have 0 complaints !!"
5.0,"6 lanyards with 6 different colors. Easy to put on mask strings. Less stress on the ears, especially working more than a 12 hour shift. Also easy for everyday needs and hangs on neck so you don’t forget. I was very satisfied especially with adjustable tightness to relieve stress on ears."
5.0,"Having used several pouches in the past, I have a lot to compare this with, and this sheep leather pouch is the best I've ever used.<br /><br />I've had it for about four months now, so I've seen how it stands up to being broken in, and it's still as soft but resilient as ever. The feeling of a tobacco pouch is really important to me, because I'm going to be handling it several times a day, and this pouch is a joy to touch.<br /><br />The magnetic clasp was a welcome feature, as it makes one-handed deployment of this pouch a snap. Incidentally, my old tobacco pouch had snaps, making it easy to get snagged on the way out of pockets and difficult to open when your hands weren't as free as they could be.<br /><br />It's not as large as some pouches I've used, so you have to be mindful with your packing. I've found a full pouch lasts me between a day and a day and a half before needing to be refilled. I'm actually pretty okay with this, because it means I'm always smoking fresh tobacco."
5.0,Cure on!
5.0,"A nice heavy chain. Does not have the white shine of silver, but it’s also a chain I don’t worry about losing. I wear it about 3 times a week."
5.0,Fits great my niece is 18 and 5ft even 98-100 pounds fits her perfectly nice halter top comes to her belly button.Pants come to her ankles. Fast delivery and item was as described.
5.0,Great lightweight tee shirt. Wicks perspiration right away. Fits great and I will be buying more of them.
5.0,I've gotten lots of compliments on this dress.
5.0,"Absolutely perfect! Fianc&eacute; slipped it right on with no trouble at all, and it glimmers like a genuine engagement ring! ' Doesn't leave green residue, and not a single diamond has popped out just yet! Definitely worth the buy!"
5.0,"I ordered a small and I am 5'7, 145lb. I probably should have gotten a medium but it will work. I am on the last or second to last hole. The belts are nice for the price."
5.0,"I LOVE this piece.  It is now my new everyday wear. It weighs enough that it feels like a great quality piece but not so bulky that I don’t feel comfortable typing on my keyboard.  It is slightly bendable to ensure a solid fit but doesn’t feel like it’s going to break anytime soon.  I love it!<br />I’ve received MANY complements.  It can be dressed up or down.  Since I’m primarily a silver wearer, this goes perfectly with all my other everyday jewelry.  I would not hesitate to buy this again.<br />I have opted to test products as a hobby and thus, received this product at a reduced price in order to fully test the product offered. I have not been paid to leave a review but simply received a discount to test the product for flaws or issues.  This review is of my own words and using my firsthand experience with the product. If I like it, I like it, if I don’t, that is reflected in my reviews.  I have written this review as if I paid full price for the product and is not biased due to the discount. If you appreciated my review, please click “yes”, that it was helpful!"
5.0,This dress is so pretty and is made of awesome material. Thicker than I expected... I'm 5'6 and it's pretty short from the front. It's a high/low dress. I will definitely have to wear leggings with it. It's warmer than I excepted due to the material... Not for festival wear.
5.0,Very dainty. Beautiful.
5.0,"I gave these socks as a gift and, as far as I know,  he likes them."
5.0,I love my watch! It goes with everything and I wear it ALL the time.  I have bathed with it several times and it works perfectly.  I want to find it in the other colors!
5.0,"The only reason I'm not rating it a 5 on sturdiness is because I haven't had it for long, but it really is a nice leather cord and looks great with the pendant I'm using. Would absolutely recommend"
5.0,Beautiful and well designed
5.0,"My sister loves them a nice assortment, don't let the photo fool you the box is about 2 inches by 4 inches so far from the over sized picture shown."
5.0,I love love love this dress!! It fits perfect and is super cute. Runs very true to size. The pockets make it my favorite!
5.0,"I got this for a friend for his pirate outfit, looked great with it. It was a little more ripped than the picture but it looked great!"
5.0,A perfect way to display discreet Penn State pride - it was a gifts for my mom!
5.0,Use mainly when out in public dealing with unknown circumstances.
5.0,"VERY CUTE PIN AND PERFECT FOR PRE-CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY OR CHRISTMAS SEASON GIFTING.  SUITABLE FOR GIFTING IN QUANTITY AS FAVORS, AS TOKEN GIFTS/THANKS, FOR THOSE AT HOLIDAY GATHERINGS/FESTIVITIES/PARTIES/FUNCTIONS, AS STOCKING STUFFERS, AS DECORATIONS.  BECAUSE OF THE PIN/SMALL PARTS I WILL ONLY BE GIVING THE PINS TO ADULTS/OLDER CHILDREN. ALSO, THIS VENDOR HAS BEEN RESPONSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE."
5.0,"These sunglasses saved my life working as a lifeguard, sitting facing the glaring sun for hours at a time. Colors seem more vibrant with these on and they really seem to protect my eyes. They may be a little larger than normal aviator designs, but I kind of like that. They haven't gotten too scratched, either, after having them for around 5 months they look almost brand new. For the price, I'd definitely recommend this pair."
5.0,Gorgeous color. Good fit.
5.0,"This sweatshirt has quickly become my favorite for morning workouts. It’s warm, but very breathable so you don’t get the overheating that comes with other fabrics. I wear it to walk the dogs and it has kept me comfortable in the 62 degree mornings.<br /><br />I have only washed it once (on delicate and line dried) but it washed well and didn’t lose comfort or color.<br /><br />The cut is very flattering and looks nice with leggings or wide leg pants. I’m 5,4” with a shorter torso and it hits right at my belly button. Depending on the leggings, it either covers my belly or shows 1/4” or less of my belly."
5.0,"This was an anniversary gift, as soon as I got it I loved it.It feels very sturdy, all I would do is replace the chain since that's the only part that feels thin and prone to break.Other than that I love it."
5.0,Es muy linda...
5.0,"I really like this suit.  Fits as expected, everything stayed where it was supposed to while playing in the ocean with kids!  Other reviews mention that the white stripes are actually vents/see-through, but they're really not see-through.  They look like stripes and are cute."
5.0,"Great basic tees. I am a 38D and ordered size XL. They fit very well. Soft material, slightly stretchy. Colors are nice. I will order again."
5.0,"Love, love love this handbag!"
5.0,These are by far the best yoga pants I've bought. So comfortable fits just right it hugs my curve right. I weight 180lbd 5feet tall and got a size large and fits just right
5.0,Quality as desired and expected. Delivered on time.
5.0,Great piece and well construction. Color is vibrant
5.0,"I wore this in Wisconsin with leggings and a turtleneck underneath.  It was a lot of fun.  Very comfortable, highly recommend."
5.0,"I actually purchased three, in total.  First two were gifts and the third was for me.  It's nicely weighted yet delicate. 1m really happy with it"
5.0,"I love this dress, bought this for an upcoming cruise. It is a bit short on the back area but that can be fixed with some short tights. I am 135 lbs and 5'1 I usually wear size 4. I bought this in a small as referenced on the chart they provided and it fits perfect. The bust area is a bit tight but I usually always have this problem since I wear a D cup. Overall I would recommend and it was shipped earlier than expected. :)"
5.0,Very solid construction. Truly love the tools being provided to make the adjustments with the links. Lightweight construction.
5.0,Fits perfectly. Very comfortable! I love it!
5.0,High quality and good fit. Nice colors too.
5.0,"Got this as a dupe for the fjallraven kanken mini backpacks as well as a carrier for my magic stuff! It's a nice size. For MTG stuff, it can easily hold two, up to four deck boxes and the side pocket fits a playmat! I couldn't ask for more! For more normal uses, it can fit a 24oz hydro flask and 9.7 inch iPad. The hydro flask is a little tight if you put it in the outer pockets but fits spaciously in the main compartment. The material is sturdy and the inside is lined! The straps are adjustable and comfortable and the handle is such a cute yet useful touch. This could definitely be a day bag with all your essentials + more or a light backpack for college (like when you just need a tablet or small notebooks). The material is also good enough quality to handle patches. I sewed two onto the bag and the material took to the needle + thread well. Removing the default HotStyle patch it came was very easy but left small holes where it was threaded. It's only really noticeable in certain lighting and up close. I highly recommend adding patches or pins to this bag as it makes it so cute and personalized! Note, the upper part of the bag has padding, so it can be hard to sew through it. But this just means the quality of the bag is really nice. I highly recommend this mini backpack!"
5.0,Love these pants. Perfect fit. Worth every penny.
5.0,Have had no problems and definitely worth the $10
5.0,Everything fit Perfect. Just what i need as a BIG guy
5.0,Love the fabric and the two pockets
5.0,I hung this outside my bathroom window during my Halloween party and it scared everyone who saw it.
5.0,"Comfortable for scoliosis brace. Breathable, no wrinkles. Bought xl to prevent too much compression for women’s size medium"
5.0,Great product for a great price. Can’t find these at other retailers so happy I found them on amazon.
5.0,This product worked exactly as advertised. Very pleased with fit.
5.0,"Necklace is exquisitely beautiful, I love it, will order again from seller."
5.0,"I love a wide leg pant, and these are so great! It's a flattering fit for every type. They are also incredibly comfortable.  I usually wear a L/XL or 14 in US sizing, and I went with the XXL, and that was a good move. Go by your measurements, not by your standard sizing.<br /><br />These are great! I hope they make a black version at some point! Love these!"
5.0,"Wow what a surprise! This sherpa pullover is so soft and warm, and unlike some others that made me look clumsy, this one is very stylish, I like the zipper and the drawstrings, they help to adjust the look, not to mention it's so comfy. Also I must add that the packaging is pretty nice, it comes in a vacuum bag.<br />I am looking forward to wearing it in the upcoming cold days!<br /><br />Nov. 14 update:<br />Now that it's gotten colder I'm wearing it right now, it feels like paradise, so warm and I feel like I could sink into its plushness. I don't want to take it off, I'm wearing it to sleep!"
5.0,"Impressed by the quality, the presentation and the ease to adjust.<br />My husband absolutely loves his."
5.0,Amazing earing. Simple yet elegant.
5.0,Beautiful pendant! I get compliments every time I wear it!
5.0,"If wear medium but a large. Waist and inseam runs small.<br /><br />Once I had the right size, perfect<br /><br />Heavy Flannel soft and warm"
5.0,Love it nice and big and plenty of pockets.
5.0,Would purchase this dress again.
5.0,great protection and prompt delivery  I immediately ordered another box !
5.0,"I gave it as gift to my sister, she loved it."
5.0,I ordered work shirts before very durable shirts
5.0,"Good quality. I've had this cap a couple of years now, and it's held up well. Leave the styrofoam in the horns to keep the shape! The cap is comfortable, but muffles sound and is not really breathable due to the material. I'll probably poke a couple more holes over the ears to hear better. For reference, I wear a medium women's hat, and don't have thick hair and the cap fits fine. FYI the horns are tall - I have to duck through doorways in them."
5.0,"Well made, nice pattern and colors, fits well and very comfortable. Got a lot of compliments from coworkers."
5.0,nice and warm! good shipping
5.0,"For reference I'm 5'5 and 127lbs athletic figure. I wear a size small in tops and size 26 in jeans. I wore this today in 50° weather with a tee underneath and it kept me warm from and to the car during errands.  The arm length is perfect, the pocket placement falls nicely below my hip, and the colors are great. I received a compliment  and its not even noon. :)"
5.0,Item sent promptly and good quality
5.0,"Absolutely incredible piece! For it being low cost, I was surprised!"
5.0,"Great Hat, looks like it cost $100 love it!  brought this item 09/2015 still wearing it 03/2016."
5.0,"Material is nice, doesn’t stretch and it does wrinkle some. The color was perfect and super comfy fit."
5.0,"These gloves are high quality, super war, and comfy. They are not good for riding a motorcycle. Like marshmallows on the grips. For the snow, and daily wear in the cold they are awesome.  Haven't tried the touchscreen yet."
5.0,"It was what I expected, the person receiving it also loved it. It was the symbol he was proud to wear."
5.0,I'm getting what I'm dreaming of!
5.0,Beautiful! Soft and fits great!
5.0,Lightweight material.
5.0,"I got this for my school aged daughter to wear to her class Christmas party and it was a hit.  She loves it and couldn't wait to wear it.  It's definitely a novelty item in the vein of the whole ""ugly sweater"" kind of thing, but it's not a sweater.  The material isn't as thick or plush as a sweater but is a little thinner.  Not as thin as a t-shirt, but more like a very lightweight sweatshirt material.  It's very colorful and the cat is pretty awesome.  It's longer than a regular shirt but shorter than a dress, so my daughter wore it over tights.  I would say it runs just a little on the smallish side compared to other items she has in the same size, but probably not enough to size up unless you're between sizes.  Overall we're happy with it - fun, zany, and my daughter loves it."
5.0,"So far so good. Got these on daily special for a very low price. i'm happy that i did. First of all got them on time. They look great and fit perfect, I'm a size nine and very comfortable. Color is very nice. They look very well made so hopefully will last me a long time."
5.0,OH! how i wish these came just one size larger. I am so in love with these shoes but they were just to small for me.
5.0,These are great pjs. Fit as usual. Material is soft and comfortable for summer nights. And it washes well! I wear them around the yard in the morning watering my gardens and don’t have to care if the neighbors catch me!  Would recommend to purchase!
5.0,Go by the recommendation on size they fit exactly like they say love how this doesn't punch you up and how it fits around the butt.
5.0,Great size! They are lightweight but feel very durable. Very pleased with the quality for the price.
5.0,It’s a one or two time wear for the season but still a cute outfit
5.0,Legging as described.  Nice pale blue color.
5.0,"Besides been a little wide around the neck, it fit and looks great."
5.0,I love it it’s really cute.
5.0,Great quality. Really soft. Good logo as well.
5.0,"The size, quality, color, and detail were all wonderful. We used them to make bookmarks for a bible study."
5.0,"I was looking for a light changing towel and took a chance on this poncho. It’s a soft and light towel material, perfect for the summer. I love the colors and it was nice and roomy to change in."
5.0,Work for my day job as a receptionist. People seem to like the extra jewelry.
5.0,"I love this skort. Fits great. It's comfortable and is great for pickleball, tennis or just wearing for shopping. Love it !!!!"
5.0,Love my new af1's. I recieved them today 5 days before scheduled delivery. I would like to check out more products but cant seem to find a direct link to you guys
5.0,Only wish they offered it in blue!
5.0,"Love it! It's cute, soft, and warm"
5.0,Really liked it. Just the kind of sports bra I was looking for. I am a small 38D headed to a 36. I purchased a 36D and it fit as expected. Nice support.
5.0,"This dress is adorable, very cute, very comfortable. My measurements are 38 33 39, &#34;B&#34; cup. 5'7&#34; 140 lbs.  I ordered the small. It fits me perfect. Not too baggy.  I think I could also wear the medium and have it a little more loose, but I'm happy with the small. It falls just at my ankles. Soft material, a little stretchy and well sewn pockets. Looks better than the picture."
5.0,"One size fits most, looks great, nice bag."
5.0,My 5 year old daughter loves it and wears it all the time!!! Even when it is not time to go to bed!
5.0,My son loves you sandals and it is the only thing he will wear until it starts getting cold
5.0,Great Product and it looks Amazing for the money !!!
5.0,Love the blouse.bought a bigger size in a different colour.
5.0,It’s nice looks just like the picture!!
5.0,Good quality and nice looking. It looks just like the picture.
5.0,"The only socks on Amazon that really are wide (as of now).  My diabetic toes cannot stand to have any pressure at all put on them by a sock, and all other socks I've tried are simply not wide enough at the toes to do the job. They are a little big elsewhere, but at least I can wear them. Supposedly I'm a shoe size 10 1/2 EEE, but I usually have to buy a full size larger."
5.0,I love the handbag the handles are just right and it fit wonderful. I love it. Thank you.
5.0,Perfect for a child’s face. Very pretty and Saturday.
5.0,"These socks are just fun, nice to wear around the house on a chilly night. I love mine. However, I gave a coordinated pair to both my son and future daughter-in-law (late 20's) and they both disliked them. If you plan to give them as gifts, make sure they will be appreciated!"
5.0,I feel like ariana grande in this jackets
5.0,I love this dress. I bought a larger size so it would be flowy. It is comfortable.
5.0,"This is my third time purchasing this watch. Simple, no fuss, gets the job done. Small face but great visibility. You get day, date, time, and seconds. Other modes include alarm and timer. Not the greatest backlight but good enough, you can see everything you need, and at $10 I really can't complain. The strap usually goes out around the two year mark for me but it's cheaper just to buy another one than to replace the strap.<br /><br />My only complaint is this time around I received my product from the third party seller ""DirectWatchGroup"". The screen cracked within a month and the band broke off after 6 months. Great watch but make sure to stay away from that seller."
5.0,I was really surprised how cute this jacket was for the price! My granddaughter loves it!
5.0,Was exactly as they said it would be. :)
5.0,Love it.Thank you❤️
5.0,Muy lindo y buen tamaño me encanto
5.0,I my self don’t know much about that stuff. My wife was very pleased with the product.
5.0,The color matches perfectly to my robe and keep my feet snuggled & warm!
5.0,Super cute tank. It’s exactly how pictured with length and all.
5.0,Good quality and soft but my opinion it fits bigger than expected.
5.0,Great quality of short for the price!!
5.0,I actually bought this for myself vs my husband. It was a fluke and due to size was super cheap. Plus it would be too big for him so it's my comfy pull over
5.0,i am very satisfied
5.0,This bag is the perfect size and great material. I love that you can adjust the length of the straps.
5.0,"Shirt fits well, NOW FIRE THOSE CANNONS AND RAISE THE RED FLAG!!"
5.0,! Preciosos!!
5.0,"really liked the feel of this, and could be put on and off easily very comfortable"
5.0,Awesome fit! Love that they don’t ride up my butt!
5.0,"Son más faciles de usar que los imperdibles, hay que tener cuidado con los dientes porque hincan, pero tbn es difícil que se suelten."
5.0,"I tried many kinds of shoe inserts before for my fallen arch, sadly, they're nearly useless for my painful foot, until i ordered these insoles for plantar fasciitis. One major difference between the high arch insoles and other common shoe inserts is that there's a high arch to support your foot so that you can feel more comfortable than others."
5.0,Bought this as a gift for my sister. She loved it and decided she wanted another in a different color.
5.0,Very cute and comfortable bought for church can see wearing out with friends or to a nice event
5.0,was a gift daughter loves them
5.0,"Great for the price. Easily adjustable, and has all features shown, only difference is ears are closer together than what is pictured."
5.0,Runs a little small so I ordered 2 sizes bigger and it fit perfect
5.0,One of my favorite pair! Right about to order another one
5.0,"Love these shorts! Fit true to size! They are short, but super cute."
5.0,Great colors.  Light weight.
5.0,"I was skeptical about the sizing considering i have large breast ,but I ordered a XL and it fit perfectly. It also matched up perfect with my fresh prince jordans because it had the #23 on the front."
5.0,I love them they fit great.  they are not heavy and look great .
5.0,Cute and my granddaughter likes them a lot.  Safe for toddler walking on tile floors.
5.0,"I purchased two of these for a trip to Europe. They were incredibly useful. I wore them around my neck, and across my shoulders depending on situation. I probably wore one of these scarves almost every day for a month. Couldn't be happier. Quality is decent, they do snag but can easily be fixed. The extra large size makes it easy to hide any food stains or other imperfections. I may buy other colors in the future."
5.0,"As advertised! Beautiful, they don’t fall out when washing the face. Will order again cuz I lost them!"
5.0,"It’s great for all day use, even in the dark to stay in the “shade”."
5.0,worked well for our project.. just perfect size and easy to place photo front and back
5.0,"Love this dress!  Really cute on, not too tight in the sleeve.  Stretchy, soft fabric.  Good length with leggings, would be a bit short without them (I'm 5'7"" and ordered a large)."
5.0,I play golf and not only do these glasses protect my eyes they make it easierto find my ball. If they could help my game they would be even better.
5.0,"I bought this bag after reading other reviews, and I love it.  I carried it all over Asia.  It's large enough to carry overnight items and a change of clothes, but light and flexible enough to be used for an everyday tote.  I used it as a tote and as a backpack, depending on how much I was carrying.  It's a little expensive, but attractive, very strong, lightweight, and useful- I would completely recommend it."
5.0,"These shorts are amazing! They fit well, have good stretch and are affordable! Ordering a second pair!"
5.0,Absolutely adorable onesie I purchased for a friend! Great quality and fun baby gift.
5.0,My son loves minions and this perfect to put in his birthday box of goodies to surprise him with his trip to universal studios
5.0,Well made full leather bag. Size is bigger that expected.
5.0,This is a great purse.  It holds a ton and looks great full or not too full.  It sits on my shoulder nicely and rides well on my computer roller bag.
5.0,Love the teal!! Fits perfectly!
5.0,"Adorable set of glasses!!<br />They fit my 4 and 2 year old perfectly and looked soooo cute!!<br />The price can’t be beat for quality and style. Very happy with this combo.<br />The sunglasses also came with their own cloth cases, perfect to travel with and transport safely. We just keep ours in the car!"
5.0,"Love these and they hold you in while not being uncomfortable at all. Very lightweight, no ribs etc. I want to find these in other colors!"
5.0,bought a lot of dresses this year most more expensive than this one and prettier too.  however this one is pretty and it fits me. the others are too long and too big. one was too small. i kind of feel like goldylocks and found the one that was just right.  its also fully lined and not too hot. its a very humid 87 degrees here today and i feel great.
5.0,Cute & comfortable. Fits well.
5.0,Bought this for all my cards and love it!
5.0,"Nice leather cord bracelet. I have a reasonably sized wrist for a man, so it fits me perfectly. If you have a chubbier wrist, this bracelet might not be for you. One thing to keep in mind is that when closing the bracelet, I found out it's best to pull it away from your wrist and snap it close. If not, the skin of your wrist could get pinched and it does sting when it is caught. Despite this, I think this is a nicely made bracelet that will last."
5.0,No tag which is great but hard to tell front from back when putting it on
5.0,Beautiful! My sisters loved them!
5.0,"I love this dress so much! I got so many compliments (even from my mom, who is hard to please). The embroidered flowers are super cute, and artfully made. The dress was a little stiff when it arrived, but that was fixed with a quick steam."
5.0,So far so good. I did wash a couple dogs in it and it kept me dry. That was the whole reason I purchased it. The material is totally not going to last me very long but thats ok. I didn't expect it to last very long for the price. I just needed to order something that would get me through the first few weeks of grooming until I could afford a nicer one. It shipped fast and got her fast!
5.0,Great movie!
5.0,Fits perfectly under airline seat!
5.0,Loved shirt for my granddaughter. She loves cocomelon.

5.0,"So sparkly and looks very expensive. I am thrilled with this purchase and can't wait to wear this on my wedding day. Will order from this company again as they were quick to answer my question, as well as fast shipping."
5.0,"I love the Lindsay Phillips Switchflops, and have several of these snaps and straps. It's like having multiple pairs of shoes without the expense. This snap is particularly pretty, and I'm very happy with it. And, they sell on Amazon for much less than in local stores!"
5.0,Bought this for my daughter. She loves it. It’s comfortable and easy to put on.

5.0,Super comfortable and beautiful. Worth it!
5.0,Very good fit. Pleased with this product.<br />Comfortable and light weight.<br />Love the style.

5.0,"I love these visors. Quite a few years ago, my sister and I purchased these in a store. I loved them at that time and have never been able to find them again. I wore out all of the visors purchased years ago and am delighted to find them on Amazon. They are extremely comfortable and effective in blocking the sun from my eyes. Thank you Amazon."

5.0,"Love,love,love this tank!!!<br />Super comfy and looks great on!  Price is awesome!<br />Ordered 3 in black and 2 in white"
5.0,Great utility watch. Have worn it on two very long hikes and in my workshop where I don't want to harm my expensive dress watch. This is my second one after the bracelet broke after many years of use.
5.0,Had them for almost a month now. They fit perfect. Very comfortable. Sometimes I forget I'm even wearing them. If I need to run out real quick I can do so without having to switch to my shoes. Anytime I need new slippers. These will be my go to now.
5.0,"perfect fit, washes nicely. Looks very cute with leggings, tunic and boots!"
5.0,"I got this pair of glasses for a gift about 5 years ago and LOVED them they eventually got broke and so when I found these I was SUPER excited! They are great shades, came flawless in great packaging too! Highly recommend these!!"
5.0,This glass are great for everyday driving at night and for skiing day or night would buy again
5.0,Exacto a la descripción.
5.0,They are so cute. Super shiny and rounded corners.
5.0,This is a great product all 110%
5.0,"I use this to carry stuff to the gym where I work out and swim. I find it large enough to carry a gym towel, pool towel, goggles & sandals, swim trunks, bath towel & toiletries, skin lotion, music player, and everything else I need. I like the separate compartment for wet items. The zippers, stitching & fabric seem to be sturdy and have held up so far."
5.0,Well made...very sexy. Delivery time EXCELLENT!<br />Thanks!!
5.0,They work.  My eyes don’t hurt anymore!!o
5.0,Beautiful Watch!  It was a great gift
5.0,I love the variety of colors. It holds up good. Great quality material
5.0,"I love this! I'm 132lbs and a 34b/32c. I ordered the small based on other reviews and it's a perfect fit! The bottoms are slimming in the right places and covers the backside well, and the top accentuates the right places and is fairly modest for a two piece. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
5.0,These are my all time favorite biker shorts I have like 4 colors!! Highly recommend!!
5.0,I have worn this ring now for awhile without taking it off. It still looks good. needed an adjustable ring because of swelling due to arthritis. Happy I gave it a try.
5.0,We love these socks!  They are perfect for my almost 2 year old who refuses to wear tights.  They come just above her knees.  The colors are great and don't fade in the wash.  They have held up well to many washes.
5.0,It's so cute on my grandson
5.0,Great buy  ...  perfect
5.0,"Fits the Gotcha perfectly, and I love the colors"
5.0,Fabric is nice!!. . So cute w/Ugg’s for this upcoming fall/winter months.
5.0,these are just the right size gem.  The bend is not quite enough to stay in.  they tend to slip out too often.  they need to be bent into a 90 degree angle.
5.0,"I love these tanks.  I am 5'4"", 145 lbs, 34B and the M is perfect for me.  It is snug but not overly tight.  The fabric is great - not too thick, not too thin.  The length is perfect for me and they don't ride up.  The red is a little darker than I expected but I still like it just fine.  I do recommend these."
5.0,I would get this shirt if I were you! I got both colors and would have gotten more if they were available. The shirt is very flattering. No complaints. One of my favorite shirts!
5.0,One of my favorite pair of shades!  I constantly get compliments on them!
5.0,Omg I love this dress. It hangs perfectly on my curves and I got a million compliments. I ordered black and the tan color.<br /><br />I wear a size 14 and got the XL in tan and L in black. This stretches so it depends on the look you’re going for.
5.0,I bought this for my 14 year old daughter for golf practice. It was cute and kept her cool. She wears it on and off the course.
5.0,It is pretty and durable
5.0,"I bought sets of bracelets and chains for my favorite daughters. For a present! And this gift turned out very good: silver jewelry is beautiful. And the chain and bracelet can be worn as a separate decoration. And you can wear them at least for a sporting event, at least for a party. Great product! I recommend."
5.0,Love these! I wear them often. Super cute
5.0,"Amazing! Delivery was fast, fits perfectly, the material is also very good and comfortable! I would definitely recommend this seller!"
5.0,"This is a great piece. You can dress it up or down and use it from day to night. The material is on a thinner side, but in dark colors it is not see-through. The fabric is soft, the skirt is flowy and the collar area is open enough to allow the use of nice jewelry. I highly recommend this item!"
5.0,Surprised at quality for the price. Will be buying the same style in black / steel two tone.
5.0,One for me and one for a gift!
5.0,Gave this as a gift to a young girl. Very cute set!
5.0,"So cute, get compliments from everyone!"
5.0,"My coworker purchased theses pants and bragged how good they were, better than 5.11, so I purchased a few. I concur that they hold up better then 5.11 and are durable. They haven’t faded."
5.0,So far these compression stockings have been wonderful.
5.0,"I absolutely love these pants! I am usually in leggings most of the time and have gotten used to how comfortable they are, so I’ve been searching for Jean looking leggings with the comfort of leggings. I’m<br />Usually a size 6 and got the small/medium. They are a perfect fit. I think if you’re a size 4, you might want to go smaller, but possibly when washed and dried the small/medium would work. They are tight enough and loose enough at the waist to stay up but not squeeze my belly and create a muffin top. The pockets and zipper and quality of material make them<br />Appear almost like real jeans. The waist part sits right above my belly button. They’re perfect! I just ordered a few more pairs!"
5.0,"I am 5'3"" 130lbs and ordered a Medium in this sweater. It fits true to size and the color is better in person. I've washed it and it did not shrink or pill. It's a medium weight sweater perfect for year-round wear and great for travel. I would definitely recommend it!"
5.0,"Kalon 4) Pack All Black. I am loving these tank tops! It’s very hard for me to find narrow strapped tank tops that aren’t too low in the chest area and the armpits that fit me well since I’m petite... and these are the winner!!! These maintain their stretch though out the day, launder well and so far are holding up nicely. The only color combo that I haven’t purchased yet is the navy/white and greys. But I really don’t need all thoughts greys?? That may be my next purchase. Although, you have a nice color selection, I wish you offered an “eggplant”, “true red”, “dark rich coffee brown” and a rich amethyst purple! Keep up the great work!"
5.0,Shipped fast. Work perfect. Phone is secure and no fear of it falling out.
5.0,"i giggle a little bit every time i wear them because i am used to wearing smoother tanks tops and pulling them down.  but it's not a tank top and there's no having to pull it down because it rode up.  but these unders really do produce the same result!  i do wish the smoother came down just a little in the front but i am appreciative of the fact that there is a change in the material because you don't get sportsbra effect on your bum - that part looks normal.  and there's not a crazy thick seam at the switch that's obvious under clothes.  all in all i am super pleased with these shapers.  they are comfortable - i look and feel better in them, and yet they arent so tight that i feel like my insides are realigning.  i think they are a pretty perfect smoothing option."
5.0,"What I liked was: screw down crown (and of course case back), water resist to 200 m, synthetic sapphire crystal, GMT feature (I’ll likely never use it, but it’s still cool) stainless steel, screws for bracelet adjustment, lume is pretty good, and I can’t think of anything else. What don’t I like? Can’t think of anything there. I just think that this product is way more than the sum of its parts. Hope it lasts as long as it looks like it will."
5.0,"ORIGINAL<br />Had to return - not for a 6'5&#34; frame<br /><br />UPDATED<br />I originally ordered an XL (i'm 6'5&#34; medium build) - the company sent me an XXXL, which fit perfectly<br />Very good customer service"
5.0,Worth the money good fit and good bill.
5.0,This is a half sleeve style  novel and chic  red elegant  feel very suitable for mature women
5.0,my new favorite suit! covers all my bulges!
5.0,My Mom loved this gift!!!
5.0,"It works, although I would like a longer one to wear like a long sarong. Was only able to wear as a skirt or short dress. 5’4” 120#. Also pretty expensive"
5.0,Great love it 👌🏼
5.0,"Shipping was fast, size was true to fit and flattering. Customer service seems great, will be ordering more!"
5.0,"This swim suit is so different and cute! I love the ice cream cones and can’t wait for pool weather and get a picture of my daughter in this eating an ice cream cone too! The tu tu lace at the bottom is a great touch. The style is so cute. The material is nice and perfect for swimsuit. The swimsuit came exactly as expected and the print, color and material were great. The size seems pretty accurate when comparing it to other swim suits of this size in my daughters closet."
5.0,"very well made , i got as a Christmas gift from my daughter and i love them!!"
5.0,My son loves these he has 3 pairs and would enjoy more to lounge around in each day.
5.0,My daughter got so many compliments on this costume & is still wearing it in December! Haha
5.0,"I'm waste 34 and I went for size 8, which fits perfectly. Fabric is not very elastic. I'm 5'1"" and the hem reaches right above the knees."
5.0,For such a cheap buy i love this...  the chain was the complaint i read on here and yes the chain was a little cheap but it works for me as i had a chain that attached to my hip bag that i use... It's got style and class... Oh and works
5.0,Liked the colors!!
5.0,very surprised with how light weight and stylish these were. ordered them as a present and have multiple people asking me where I got them from.
5.0,I am very satisfied  with the HUAY flip up sunglasses.

5.0,Great socks. Exactly as I expected. Not too binding at top but stays in place. Very happy.
5.0,Great looking watch for the money.

5.0,This is so freaking adorable! I love it. It seems very well made. Lucky its push start as it is a little heavy.
5.0,Great hat and even better service! Thank you!
5.0,Very nice school shoes.  My four years old granddaughter looks adorable in them on her way going to school.<br />Gaia
5.0,"Taking it on my girlfriends trip to Mexico.  I have a small head, so I love that it has an adjusting band inside."
5.0,"Sturdy, classy and beautiful! Personally use them for a cosplay but would happily wear them for anything. They're not heavy and are comfortable"
5.0,Great fit. I found the length not too short as some reviews suggested. Made from good material. The detail on front made the dress flattering.
5.0,"Love my snowflake pendant! It is a tad larger than I normally would wear but other than that, it sparkles and glitters like real diamonds. very well made. It has nice size CZ stones, not those little worthless diamond chips. I would much rather wear this stunning &#34;fake&#34; one than those cheap little real ones. Worth the money for what you get."
5.0,I like the weight of the Russell hoodie. Comfortable and warm. This is a replacement for one that had seen better days.
5.0,Bought for my daughter she is 5’7 $150 I bought a medium
5.0,My son's pediatrician told us that we needed to get flip flops that had arch support for our son. He seems to like these a lot. Hopefully they will get lots of use this spring and summer. I will update if they don't hold up to an eleven-year-old's shenanigans!
5.0,"This bracelet is beautiful and well made. The wood beads and silver accent beads are strung on a heavy duty, durable cord.<br /><br />It took me a little while to figure out how to wrap it and tighten it to fit. It would be nice if instructions were included to make it a little simpler. I'm sure most think it would be self-explanatory, but when the bracelet is one long loop that wraps three or four times around your wrist and has sliding beads to adjust it, it can be a little confusing.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
5.0,Fits great! My son loves it 😊
5.0,Comfortable fit and great value
5.0,will buy more later
5.0,"Fits well, great material, highly recommend!"

5.0,Both my son and daughter love it.  We had bought a different one and it was elastic rubber and was not confortable at all.  So happy we bought this brand.

5.0,They run a little big in size.but my son's. Wear's it all the time.he was really excited .it's a go getter.😀
5.0,Worked just as intended. Thankyou.

5.0,"I love these compression stockings! I have tried other brands but these are the most comfortable. After a 12 hr shift on my feet, my legs feel great."
5.0,"Just wanted to let folks know that the design is printed, not embroidered, on these handkerchiefs. I prefer that, but I don't want anyone to be disappointed."
5.0,"I like the design and colors, very comfortable as well."
5.0,Cute socks wish they were thicker thou but thanks for getting them to me in time for halloween
5.0,Loved for vacation
5.0,"I really loved this watch: good, nice and good price. It didn't fit me so well though, my bad, I didn't measure my wrist."
5.0,Absolutely love them.  Very delicate and finely detailed!!
5.0,I love this shirt.. I actually bought 6 (2 different sizes) and they work out great! I bought them to make my own t-shirts for my kids bday with iron on vinyl and it worked out great! Not to mention the price is amazing!
5.0,"Great quality, stepson loves it. Good print quality, good material. Heavy, but that's not a bad thing. It's what a hoodie should be."
5.0,"The quality of this dress is very good, the fit was great. I'm 5'2 with measurements 36C, 30waist and 40 hips and the medium was perfect. It has some stretch to it. The length was also good for me as i didn't want it dragging behind me it fell behind just barely touching the floor without heels......for a taller person it may be short in length depending on how you prefer to wear it...."
5.0,"This mask fits well, I added a nose piece (Amazon DIY), and the pocket allows room for extra protection.  I’ve gotten a lot of compliments."
5.0,"I thought, due to the price, that this belt would be made out of cardboard. But, thankfully, it was exactly as shown - leather and nothing but. I bought both the brown and the black. Very nice looking and very adjustable because of all of the double holes."
5.0,My teenager loved it. It fit him very well.
5.0,Great deal for the set!
5.0,Belt is Awesome!!!! I love this belt and would recommend this belt to anyone.
5.0,had too order 2 sizes up but i love it
5.0,Good price!!
5.0,the honey badger dont care! love it. bought this as a birthday gift for a friend. good quality. pretty stoked about it!
5.0,"I absolutely adore this skirt, I bit the bullet getting it since lost reviews were from people smaller than me. But I ended up getting an extra large, and it was amazing. I loveeeeee this skirt so much."
5.0,"While these would make a wonderful gift, I bought them for myself. I am a nurse and tend to lose earrings sometimes, so I don't wear anything overly expensive to work. I do like to wear colorful pretty things though, it helps the patients to feel more comfortable I think also. These absolutely fit the bill. They are good quality and the color is beautiful! My new go to for work!"
5.0,"I'm 6 foot tall, 185lbs, athletic build, and an XL was form fitting around my chest, just a tad loose around the mid section, and tight near the bottom, which to me is how I wanted it.  I usually wear Larges but I can only imagine how tight that would have fitted!  Get a size up!<br />Very cool design.<br />The sleeves were about an inch or two too short for the length of arms."
5.0,It is a little long but the material is fab!
5.0,Very comfortable and easy to put on. Dresses up my  garmin.
5.0,I took the patches off..
5.0,It fit good and is very comfortable
5.0,"Again I ordered a size up in this so it would be a loose fit but it is almost too big so if I ordered again I would order my normal size. Having said that though I really like this shirt. Airy, loose, and can be dressed up or down depending on the look you want. It was a bit see through but honestly not that bad and the material was very soft and not cheap looking at all."
5.0,Awesome band very comfortable and very durable
5.0,Looks  just  like  a  picture.
5.0,Like that I don't have to bend over anymore!!!!
5.0,I have a big head and this fits comfortably. Warm and looks nice
5.0,"Love these slippers.  After standing on my feet in my work shoes all day, it's great to put these on at home. Looks good also."
5.0,"First I'm not a runner - I've not run or jogged since they made me in the Marines and I have been out of the Marines for 52 years.  I do, however, have some real shoe fitting problems.  My left foot in shorter and thicker than my right plus I have hallux rigidus of the right big toe which means I need a deeper and wider toe box for my right foot.  This leads to some fit problems.  These laces allow a tight but comfortable fit that eliminates most of the slippage when walking which in turn reduces blisters.  I wish I had found these 3 or 4 years ago because I would have saved myself a lot of money buying shoes that didn't work out and a lot of discomfort.  The Oldhill brand holds better then Lace Locks and are a lot cheaper."
5.0,"I love this shirt so much! I bought 2 others just like this in sleeveless and one without the pockets! Great quality, fits as I expected with wiggle room because it is loose fitting!"
5.0,Ordered to replace band that finally broke after a year of daily use. Came on time and undamaged. Easy to change bands.
5.0,Bought this suit a couple of days before my vacation in Mexico and I am so glad I did. So comfortable and fits nicely.
5.0,When I have to take a different medication my eye sight changes. Thank God I have<br />These glasses.
5.0,"Big size, yet comfortable. Feels/looks more high end than price paid. Would buy again!"
5.0,I bought a XL because I have the same brand and style in short sleeve version which fits great and love it<br /> This however is too big for my taste. Almost sloppy looking BUT it’s ok for layering and gym on cold days
5.0,This is extremely nice. Looks very expensive. Have gotten several great comments about it.
5.0,Huge! Strong! And fun patterned fabric.  I got this as an additional bag for vacation linens and I was shocked by how much it could hold.
5.0,"This is a 35mm diameter, 50 meter water resistant, Japan domestic market (JDM) stainless steel watch assembled in the Philippines with a Japanese-made quartz movement. Its all stainless steel case has integral fixed lugs, not pin bars, so it comes with a very comfortable NATO-style 18mm one-piece strap. The lack of pin bars makes it very sturdy, but the tradeoff is that you can't use a two-piece strap. The watch came with a price tag of 13,800 yen, which translates into 140 US dollars, making this quite a bargain. It's worth every penny of the approximately $40 I paid for it."
5.0,"Our 10 year old grandaughter is into her 3rd year of tap dancing. She out grew her last pair. I took a chance and ordered a size 9; however they were too small. I sent the pair back and within a few days another pair, size 10 arrived. Service was excellent! I really love purchasing through Amazon. Service and quality are outstanding."
5.0,Absolutely love these underwear. They fit perfectly.
5.0,"I love it!, it’s lined and super cozy!"
5.0,"This shirts feels soft and silky on the skin. I bought them to sublimate for my sons, but ended up wearing several before even attempting my sublimation experiment"
5.0,"The quality of this belt is stunning. The stitching is sturdy and the smell is wonderful! I know that sounds weird, but genuine leather smells so good, to me. I gave this to my husband but honestly, I may steal it a time or two because it is so nice that I think I can combine it with some of my outfits. The color is true to the picture; it is a chocolate brown color and the buckle is a dark silver. So worth it! Definitely get it."
5.0,Bought this to wear while pregnant. Loved it!! Now I wear it up to one month postpartum. Super soft. Love how the sleeves are long enough to cover biceps.
5.0,"No idea what to expect, but I love this shirt. Looks great, fits perfectly, nice material and has been through a few washes now.  Will be looking for more from this seller!"
5.0,I added scissor clips and created a mask holder.  Very happy with it
5.0,i love this dress. its so cute and fun. the skirt is a pretty thick material so its not see through at all unlike some of the other versions i've seen on amazon. i specifically chose this one because it said it had a full length liner underneath. i'm not a fan of maxi dresses that have short liners in them. i just don't like that look. this one didn't have that problem. it fit perfectly on me and i can wear 3 inch heels and it would be right above the ground. very comfortable material and just a cute design all around. it did come a bit wrinkled but nothing a steam iron can't fix. i am a little concerned about washing it though... not sure if the green will bleed all over the crochet top...
5.0,"My necklace is a lot lighter than the picture, but still lovely."
5.0,Came on time. Feels nice. And honestly i love it
5.0,"Bought the blue lenses.  Just what I was looking for ... fits great even though I have a larger head.  The overall size, shape, and fit of the frames was perfect, and I love the fact that the frame is metal and hinged.  Blocks out the sun and glare very well without darkening at all.  I should note that the glasses come with a nice - and big! - hard shell case - I didn't know this and thus unnecessarily ordered a case separately.  A standard case will not fit these (too small for them)."
5.0,"This bag is fantastic for traveling any distance or for sports, gym, dance class, etc. The variety of pockets make it so easy to organize everything so well! The separate pocket for the shoes creates a clean space to store them away from clothes and other things in the main compartment - which is huge for me! It has short handles or a long strap for convenience. The material is very wipeable and stain resistant if anything should spill on it. Such a great multipurpose bag!!!"
5.0,Been wearing these constantly for two years and they are still going strong. Too bad Olukai discontinued the Pa'a. I don’t think they make a men’s sandal with adjustable straps any longer. Too bad.
5.0,Fit as descibed
5.0,"Good Quality Wool Hat. Hand washed in cool water with Woolite, air dry. Seems to fit a little snug, but I'm sure it will break in after a while. Looks just like the hat issued to me in the service."
5.0,I love these earrings my sister ordered them and she gave me the last pair! I have a lot of scar tissue in my ears so my ears are very thick and I have been unable to find post earrings that are long enough to fit plus I have sensitive ears. I was going to let my ears close but decided to give them a try! I am so glad I did now I can finally wear earrings! Order these! You wont regret it!
5.0,"I received the case way before the expected delivery date which is always awesome! I love this case. The colors are bright and it looks awesome on my phone. I have no issues charging, the speakers and volume buttons are still accessible. Just a great case!"
5.0,Good quality but slightly smaller than expected
5.0,Such a cute casual shirt. Fits great. I like the length of the ties!
5.0,"Bought these in red. To me they appear true to color as advertised, I know that can be an issue with online purchases. I ordered a size 8. Shoes are very weird for me so ordering online is always hit or miss. They do have a small gap in the back. But it doesn't seem to effect anything with my walking or comfort. I bought them for a wedding so I haven't worn them for length of time. But since I don't wear heels often and mostly sneakers or flip flops, they seem to be comfy so far. I will purchase an insert for to help with slipping inside and also for comfort. But so far I like them a lot!!!<br />UPDATE: purchased some foot pads. Wore these to a wedding and kept them on pretty much the entire time. They were shockingly more comfy than I figured. And I got tons of compliments!!!! Will be ordering again. Oh and they make me VERY tall lol"
5.0,I wear these everyday. Have washed them many times and they hold up well. Great for hot summer days. These are a great bargain compared to ones I have purchased in a retail store for 3x as much money.
5.0,"Me gustó un diseño muy sexy, no sabía que era tan ceñido pero me quedo excelente."
5.0,Sparkling beauty.
5.0,Hi-low long sleeve work to White Party. Add a tee or camisole to complete ensemble.
5.0,Love 'em!  I walk/run frequently in the evening and these help to make me much more visible to vehicles...and they are a fun accessory for evening line dance classes!
5.0,"I was hesitant to purchase these, even at the ridiculously low price, because there was only 1 review at the time. I am so glad I went ahead and bought them.<br /><br />They are just beautiful. Much larger than I thought they would be, sturdy, and so elegant."
5.0,"I am a personal trainer and wear the watch daily.  It has been about two weeks and no scratches or fading.  The watch keeps its time throughout the day while I’m wearing it.<br /><br />CON: The only con is my watch stopped working at night (after sleeping).  Easy fix, I place it in a watch winder at night.  Problem solved."
5.0,Perfect!!  Holds this stomach in nice and tight...LOL
5.0,Wore it for an event and got a zillion compliments  imam 5’5 and 115 and was perfect
5.0,"it was too small for a large lady, size 14"
5.0,As advertised shipping was fast
5.0,"This is a beautiful cami top. Very nice. It fits in all the right places, hides all the right things, while accentuating all the right things!<br /><br />this is soft and comfortable and great for summer. I'm always too hot in the summer and this is great. I feel sexy and cute in this shirt. Especially, since it is longer on the sides as opposed to the front and back.<br /><br />This is a great cami. I recommend it to everyone. I should get more of them in different colors.<br /><br />My one downfall is I hate ironing and it does get a bit wrinkled from the wash. I'll have to try to get them out of the dryer sooner rather than later. Amazing shirt and I love it."
5.0,"I love this dress ,"
5.0,"Wonderful value! Not a ""granny pantie,"" Comfortable  and well fitted"
5.0,Comfortable to wear for football Friday’s!!!
5.0,"I love it! The colors are fabulous, it is soft and warm, but not too bulky and drapes perfectly. Super cute and functional, I can't wait to take it in my next plane flight!"
5.0,"Beautiful earrings!! I bought these for a gala event and they looked great with my long, fancy dress. They are classy with just the right amount of sparkle."
5.0,Hubby loves the comfort of band. Stays in place.
5.0,My macaw Big Red bit me on Saturday [breeding season]. The bleeding wouldn't stop and I had 3 stitches.  they had me admitted for IV antibiotics and surgery because it's infected. I purchased these gloves AFTER being bit. Never again! These gloves are great!!
5.0,The watch didn’t work at first and then it did very stylish and nice
5.0,My girl loves this one!
5.0,I like a waxed cap for cooler weather and this does the job.  The leather bill is a nice touch.  It was smashed up in the soft packaging so has some wrinkles in the waxed cotton that I hope will come out eventually.soft
5.0,Better quality than the original fit bit band
5.0,Nice quality...but would rather have Illini
5.0,"Looks as pictured, fits well and has pockets!  I am a full size US 10, the large works perfect.  At 5' 5&#34;, it is long enough to wear with heels, but it also wears well with my flip flops."
5.0,"I like the dark mirror tint which is perfect for hot weather. Build quality is good. I also like the hard plastic case and the soft case. Makes it very easy to carry around and not worried about breakage. Overall, a great buy!"
5.0,Love that with a simple twist they can be tightened or loosened when switching between techniques fast!!
5.0,These pants are amazing. They fit great and breathe very well so there's very limited sweating in that area. I haven't washed them yet to see if they'll shrink on me but they have a little bit of alastic on them so they'll stretch out a bit.
5.0,Great fit and nice pair of jeans at a reasonable price.  A good buy.
5.0,Smart looking and comfortable too!
5.0,just make sure you get the right size!
5.0,My daughter in law loves Kate spade
5.0,Love this umbrella!!!
5.0,Love these Have 3 Pair and also bought my daughter a pair!! Can wear with anything!!
5.0,"The size seems a bit small, but am still able to wear these sandals and they are comfortable. It should be noted that I only wear them in the house, but they could be used elsewhere. The arch support works and they are not sloppy on my feet. Easy to clean if needed-rinse off. Have not had these long, so cant speak to durability, but so far am very happy."
5.0,What more do you want?
5.0,My wife loves this. We often take our dogs walking in the Wet Mountains of Colorado on cold days. It keeps you warm in freezing weather and is much better than a scarf. It also works well in the wind.
5.0,Totally a quality piece!
5.0,Couldn’t believe the price on these earrings. They were good quality and a fun gift to give at an Ax throwing event!!
5.0,"I love this bag it was just what I was looking for. Great size, wonderful sturdy fabric and outside color. My only negative is that I would rather have a lighter colored lining (usually I won't buy a bag with a dark lining since it's difficult to find things in the bag)."
5.0,Really nice wife was happy.
5.0,Great belt. Well built and durable.
5.0,"My 16 yr old grandson saw mine and asked where I got it and he asked if they had more so I picked about 8 rings w/the ruby and had him pick out the one he wanted,and this is the one he picked and he loves it, he now thinks his grandpa is greater than before. Only trouble the 10 yr old wants one now. And it does look beautiful. thanks Amazon for making me look good!! Dave"
5.0,"It's fine, it is a keychain, looks like it should worked as it should.  Product arrived on time and in good condition."
5.0,Nice cover for the torso. Small and thin.
5.0,They are the perfect thickness. They are the most comfortable socks I’ve ever worn with boots. They don’t slide down (at the calf) or bunch up when I move my toes. They knew you warm without overheating.
5.0,A big party was all black
5.0,Pros:<br />Nice stitching and the quality<br />Fits true to size<br />Very stretchy and comfortable<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cannot think of any !!!
5.0,So I’m 5’3 and wanted to wear it rolled or pulled similar to a capri pant & it would not stay to save my life. But the set is as pictured & very comfy. This summertime pajamas
5.0,These earrings are beautiful! Great quality and super comfortable! I really like the fact that I can wear them in the shower and when I'm sleeping. Very happy with my purchase!
5.0,"I LOOOVEEEE these pants. I often use them when doing shoots for my Instagram page @sisi_era with many different outfits. They can be dressed up or down, and the style accentuates my waist while also making me look tall. 10/10 I recommend!"
5.0,good stretch to make it fit
5.0,Great quality. Very durable material.
5.0,My teenage daughter loves the material and added leggings for a cute look.
5.0,This might be my favorite skirt. It fits perfect by going by size chart. It's made really good & I love it.
5.0,All the right characters and colors.
5.0,"Hat fits as expected, and is very high quality. Front portion holds it's structure better than other hats of this style that I have owned. Mesh is very soft as well. Highly recommend."
5.0,It was exactly what I was looking for!<br />I made a GOT macrame plant hanger and used the dragons in place of beads! Turned out pretty cool
5.0,"I got one of these for travel in Europe and it became my go-to top during an epic heat wave. It's very light weight but not see through. It's also really easy to wash by hand and dries super quickly. When I returned I got two more. These tops are quite form fitting. If you want a little ease, make sure to go up a size."
5.0,Cute & sturdy to protect my ridiculously expensive glasses.
5.0,"I got these pants for my wife, who practices yoga and loves this type of design. She thought the material and fit of these pants were very nice, and even though she took a size smaller than she usually wears,  it still fit her and was very comfortable. The color is exactly as it is in the photo. It is not thin fabric but it is not heavy either, it gives a very casual look and they are ideal for practicing yoga or stretching."
5.0,I like these a lot. They look great and are comfortable to wear
5.0,Loved this! This cover up was lightweight and the style of the sleeves was very flowy and wavy...Absolutely in love with this cover up its beautifully made with great quality material...fits perfectly so go by the size chart.. This is a amazing peice to pair with just any kinda swimsuit..!! The back of the cover up has a knitted design in center like as a backbone design which is the main attractive feature of this coverup... I wore it with my black swimsuit and blue swimsuit and it looks great with both of them!!! Its roomy and airy and material is still not very see through like most other of the coverups.
5.0,"Best thing for the beach, especially on windy sunny days. It keeps you warm, but not too warm, protects from the sun a bit and definitely has a flow, flirty look to them. Goes great with white or jean shorts, capris and pants!"
5.0,This is a nice wallet but just not big enough for my needs.
5.0,Horn rimmed half frame polarized sunglasses. Plastic frame with wire rim. Color Fire for lens. These are polarized to protect eyes from sun damage. Super cute and fashionable. Purchased these for my daughter. She either losses glasses or scratches them up. Tend to not spend a lot of money on things of this nature cause something always happens. She is always wanting what is hip and install for the latest season and these are perfect and inexpensive. They also came with a mesh bag for storage and cleaning cloth.<br /><br />Received at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review of the product.
5.0,"Looks great ,nice sizes, I will enjoy."
5.0,The cosplay is great. It consists of 2 shirts and a pair of shorts. The blue shirt that goes under the top shirt has not tag so either side can be front or back. The top shirt is actually a lite shade of purple that could look white in the right lighting.
5.0,Nice necklace. I gave as a gift and my friend was pleased. ;)
5.0,"The shipping did take a tad longer than I would have liked, but I'm just impatient. The bag is perfect. I ordered it to use as a hospital bag when I deliver my daughter and it was bigger than I expected. I did get a small &#34;chemically&#34; smell, but even being pregnant, it was not overwhelming or noticeable a few minutes out of the box. Definitely will be ordering more"
5.0,"Excellent product, highly recommend."
5.0,Just what I needed. Cleaned the foot part of my Birkenstock's. I wish I had this when I cleaned a saddle I was selling. I will use this frequently in the future for any suede items. Works well.
5.0,"Honestly. These pants are AMAZING. I got two pairs and I love them. I’m 5’9 and 280 and typically wear a size 18 and they fit with lots of extra room! They go right down to my ankles, though I do with they were maybe 1 to 2 inches longer, because when I sit down they ride up my calf just a little bit. But other than that I have absolutely nothing bad to say about these pants. They’re great quality and nice and airy!"
5.0,BEST DRESS I EVER GOT!!!<br />Got lots of compliments about it and it fits PERFECT!!!!!
5.0,This is the most comfortable thing I've ever put on. I wear it around the house and sometimes even sleep in it.
5.0,"I started getting plantar fasciitis with lots of heal pain. Since wearing these around the house, that pain has completely disappeared. Hoping the manufacturer keeps making these as the one that goes between the toes is not comfortable for me. Love these shoes."
5.0,"These are great. Used them for party favors and stuffing easter eggs. Nice variety so kids can trade, etc."
5.0,"The skirt and elastic bands fit perfectly, and it looks super cute! I love this skirt and I'm really happy with it :)"
5.0,THESE SUNGLASSES LOOK GREAT ON MY BIG MELON HEAD !!
5.0,a lot larger than I expected but I love it!
5.0,This dress is very comfortable and hides any flaws you might have. The ruching is in just the right place. I normally take a 6 or 8 but ordered a large in this dress and it was a good fit. I don’t like anything too tight. This is a more flattering dress than the other ruched dresses on Amazon. I wish there were more colors. I would order them all.
5.0,I had comments from women in the department store. Great look without being overstated.
5.0,My son has a big head and it fit. But it also has an adjustable strap to fit smaller heads.
5.0,Fit perfectly and does not seep water
5.0,Just what I needed to carry essentials and not have a heavy purse hanging off my shoulder!  great quality for the price and I love the color as well. Extremely happy with this purchase.
5.0,Very easy to wear very attractive
5.0,Looks great and seems like it's made out of good material as well.
5.0,"Thanku for about the only cool DILF hat out there. So, so happy arrived earlier than promised. I LOVE this hat. Reminds me of my 90’s buckle cool fit. Awesome! If you have other DILF products, message me. LOVE"
5.0,Very well made shirt goes with several different colors of pants.
5.0,"Looks nice, strong heavy chain."
5.0,Got this for my wife. She said it really is great at cleaning her silver jewelry.<br />It's easy to bring when we travel.
5.0,The shire arrived on time and was acceptable quality. I would order from this seller again. Everything was as expected =)
5.0,"I bought these as a Christmas gift, the look super comfy and cannot wait for my boyfriend to receive them."
5.0,Love them!  Good fit and nice style!  Fun to wear!
5.0,I now can wear it when visiting Bears and packers fans
5.0,My hands/fingers got overly cold years ago. Since then my fingers/hands get extremely cold quickly and hurt. These gloves keep from happening without being to thick and restricting movement.
5.0,I like the magnetic closure.  I do not think large sunglasses would fit in this case.
5.0,"Wish I had thought to invent these, they work wonders! My 2 mo olds socks wouldn't stay on before these."
5.0,Hesitated at first but glad I didn’t. Looks great. Solid. Makes the 420269 look great. Recommended.
5.0,"I love that this dress has pockets, when I ordered I didn't realize it.  It's super soft and comfy!"
5.0,Used the mask for work.
5.0,My son loves it. He said it is very comfortable and he enjoys wearing them.  it was a nice Christmas present.
5.0,"Nice face masker, very comfortabele."
5.0,Good price nice looking
5.0,Soft and fits as expected. Colors are really nice. Dress it up or dress it down.
5.0,Very happy with the shirt.
5.0,"Great product, and stylish. Exactly what they advertise. I wear them every night."
5.0,"Beautiful dress, great price, fits great!!"
5.0,"I love these dresses so much. I have three of them and I'm fixing to order two more. They are great to just throw on when I want to dress up but have no idea what I want to wear. I am 5 6 and weigh between 140 and 145 on average. I am a medium, I bought the medium. I love how it fits. I bought only the dresses with the black tops on them. I have noticed they are a little see through so I have to wear a sports bra underneath it. It doesn't bother me though. The bottom is a little bit thicker not see through and also not hot. Overall as you can tell I would totally buy this again. Matter of fact I'm fixing to buy two more."
5.0,Beautiful. Elegant light purple stone.
5.0,"Needed a band quickly. Only expected to wear it for a couple of weeks until I had access to my bands that I have paid a lot more for (was visiting my mother when my band broke). I LOVE this band. Costs way less and is my new favorite. Very durable, comfortable and stylish. Wish there were more colors to buy."
5.0,Super soft biker shorts! They are comfortable and was great for walking and for wearing casually. The coral color is super cute! They are a true to size fit.
5.0,"This belt is very well made. Leather quality is as good as I was expecting at the price point. It is recommended by the manufacturer to get one size up and I concur. Fits right, looks great and would recomend/buy again. Thank you CrookhornDavis"
5.0,Absolutely thrilled with these assymetric earrings
5.0,Worth buying these bags if you have a girl. They are just going to LOVE these bags. Go for it
5.0,great glasses- i love them!  better quality than expected given the inexpensive price.  i have already given the glasses away and am ordering two more pairs in different colors.
5.0,My son loved this shirt .. great color
5.0,"Cute top, runs a tad big but I like the fit. Would buy again."
5.0,I cannot handle how cute this Christmas dress is! I want to start wearing it now and it is 10/30!
5.0,"So pleased with this purchase , really , really happy got 7 extra charms. Will definitely order again."
5.0,Best $20 i spent in awhile!
5.0,Love these will order more!
5.0,Arrived on time. Good material. Good seller.
5.0,Great Jean joggers
5.0,Stylish...lots of compliments
5.0,Hahahaha ... These socks are terrific! I hope the receiver of the gift likes them too. The colors and graphics are great. If you are a Wolverine fan these socks are for you!
5.0,I absolutely love the material of this shirt! Fit as expected. Cute and vibrant colors.
5.0,I'm very satisfied and the product looks great! Thank you.
5.0,A gift for my granddaughter...
5.0,This ring is so cute and a decent price. I love it
5.0,I bought that bracelet in memory of my beautiful Julia who crossed the bridge 3 weeks ago<br />Wearing it make me feel closer to her
5.0,LOVE! So pretty and well crafted. I wear it all the time.
5.0,"As someone with a smaller wrist, who nevertheless likes the rugged look of a military style watch, I find it very difficult to find a high quality, robust and yet enough flexible wrist band for my semi rugged military style watches.  I have tried several other brands, none of them are of this quality and are usually way too long for my wrist. This one fits perfectly and, at about $15, it fits the bill perfectly as well.  The extra leather strip around the holes offer extra reinforcement and allow for a very secure fit as well. Overall, a great product!"
5.0,"Love the style, fits comfortably."
5.0,"This is one of the best casual dresses i have bought on Amazon. It fits perfect, great color and simply beautiful."
5.0,looks very well made.
5.0,little bit on the smaller size but boy are they soft amd comfortable. its made with a super combed cotton or something. feels very nice on my ass and the fellas
5.0,"Okay, maybe 2 per day because we know that my kid is going to throw up on me at some point today and I may not get laundry done this week. This is super comfy. Pockets are deep and seem to be sturdy. Warm if I have a chill. Not too warm if all the kids are snuggled. Great buy, you won't regret it."
5.0,This is a great hat and perfect for children!  Thanks for listing it!
5.0,They do run big I could even go down to a small possibly from a large that I ordered
5.0,Love these peds. The do not slip down. You can not see them with you shoes on.
5.0,I just reordered these for the third time. In addition to being stylish and flattering these glasses feature scratch resistant lenses. The optical quality is excellent. I especially like the color of the lenses - they are superior for both bright and hazy conditions. I am UV sensitive and these beat my prescription sunglasses. I like the cord that lets me take them off so I can keep them handy without without losing them. The carrying case is useful for storage in the car when they aren’t in use. These are well with the price.
5.0,Little girl loved them so much we got her the silver also.  One very happy little girl!
5.0,I’m stopped all the time by supporters of Ukraine
5.0,"It looks just like the picture, and is great quality.  My daughter loves it!"
5.0,The product arrived quickly and was as expected. A great value!
5.0,"Ordered this dress in red a few weeks ago. My tomboy 12 year old that hates wearing dresses but I make her wear a dress for church. She liked the red on so much I ordered another color.<br /><br />The material is soft, the cut is flattering, the length was just right. It was fun for her to twirl too."
5.0,Exactly as described. Love the thin arms and carrying case
5.0,"Great quality, just as shown and advertised.  Would buy again and would recommend!"
5.0,"Perfect...I got these to wear when I need to shower at the gym. Quick dry, light weight, good fit"
5.0,I bought this pin for a birthday gift. I ordered it on Friday and got it on Monday. It was a nice size and looked like an expensive piece of jewelry. I would wear it.
5.0,Great bag! I use it as a diaper bag for my 18 month old. There is plenty of room for what we need to carry. It’s a sturdy bag and it appears as if the material would wipe off well.
5.0,I love it perfect came exactly as pictured and came very fast after I order will be ordering more 💖
5.0,The latch is very sturdy. I was tired of buying the multi key rings that the spring goes out after 3 months. This is perfect
5.0,"All cotton, nice relaxed fit!"
5.0,A Christmas gift much appreciated
5.0,These bands are GREAT! Blue and teal are my favorites to wear because the bands interlock on each other where as the red is like a standard watch band but they’re all comfortable and perfect for swimming and exercising.
5.0,"Gave my son these for his birthday, very happy with the quality."
5.0,"This dress is the perfect blend of comfort and style. I live in FL so being comfortable over the course of a busy and often times hot work day is important. This dress is light weight so no worries there. The colors are vibrant making the look a lot of fun to accessorize. You can dress it up or down depending on your day. It washes up great with minimal wrinkling from dryer to hanger. That's a big plus for me as I hate to iron. I found the size to be as expected so no surprises there. I do get compliments on the cute dress no matter if it's work or a weekend look with matching flats or tennis shoes and minimal jewelry. Bottom line for me - the dress is comfortable, versatile, easy maintenance and budget friendly. I have already ordered the wine colored one and added it to my closet! Will probably add others to possibly match with leggings for cooler weather."
5.0,Make your heels jealous.
5.0,"I was surprised at absence of my skin's allergic reaction. Usually I cannot wear plated jewelry. This little necklace looks great, feels great, and wears great.<br /><br />Update 8/29/2018: I was too lazy to take it off at night because it's pretty comfortable to sleep in. However one morning I woke up and realized that it broke. The chain is quite thin.  Not chain's fault but my fat neck's. I don't know how much it will cost me to fix the chain at the jeweler. I guess it will be more expensive than buying a new one. So I'm buying a new one ;-)"
5.0,Cute.  The beads are little smaller then my liking.  Still like them!
5.0,GOOD SHOES I LIKE IT
5.0,I have been using this glasses for months now and I love it. I use it on days when I don't feel like dressing up or putting on makeup. And I love how pitch dark it is so that no one can see how crappy I really look. Haha! I will love to make another purchase!
5.0,"Wonderful , high quality worksmenship.  Looks like a very expensive bifold pocket wallet. I will be buying more. I only bought 5 and love them so!"
5.0,"They are beautiful earrings that you can use as a gift or for yourself, they are super beautiful.<br />Love it."
5.0,I have purchased three different styles of the clear bags.  They are great!
5.0,"I was looking for a simple solution to replace my money clip that held cash and various cards. I saw this product on Amazon and liked its size, simplicity and appearance.  I figured it was worth a shot for $15.<br /><br />Well, I received it a few days ago and already love it.  It's simple and classy looking.  It holds about 7 cards and some cash. It does not bulge in my front pocket like the money clip it replaced.<br /><br />Time will tell if it holds up to daily use, but the leather and stitching appear well made."
5.0,It’s a really nice belt
5.0,So dainty n pretty
5.0,"Its exactly as they say , i had look at the size and measured my laptop before buying<br />It came and it fits perfectly loving my new purse as well ! Perfect for my birthday trip thank y0u"
5.0,Very sturdy head band. Very cute.
5.0,"This helmet is great!! Very stylish as well!! I have received many compliments.  A little toasty on the noggan on summer days though,  still doesn't keep me from protecting myself, on the road bike or mountain bike. Another great product from bern!!"
5.0,Absolutely Beautiful! I purchased these to go over my N95 mask. I needed some variety. They are very comfortable and well made. I will likely pin the corners to my shoulders instead of tying behind my neck to keep them looking full.
5.0,I love this bag. Hold more than you think
5.0,The material is so breathable! I was pleasantly surprised by this purchase!
5.0,"I love this bag, even though it's smaller than I expected."
5.0,I loved these and especially for a great price!!
5.0,Used this dress for my baby shower and received so many compliments. I’m 35 weeks. The arms were a bit snug but not uncomfortable. The seams didn’t pop up and I was easily able to steam the wrinkles out of the dress. So happy with this purchase.
5.0,"Hugged every curve. I'm 149 lbs 5ft 3 , very hippy...I ordered a medium...bust 36...waist...33...hips..44. Hope this measurement helps someone to decide what size to buy...material nice, stretchy and thick..The only thing i didn't like was the length...way too long for my liking...will update when i wear this somewhere ."
5.0,Cutest head bands! Great quality! My daughters wore them all day while jumping in a bounce house and it they ever slid off.
5.0,"Very good product! I used to be a big fan of lanyards but the lanyard would always catch onto something and be pulled straight away from my pocket. With this, my key is always at my side at the belt loop. The only thing I can find negative about this, is that it doesn't fit a ton of keys with it's own attachment. Also it's hard to insert keys; but with that said, your keys wont easily fall through. It will be secure. Just dont be a janitor of keys and you will be fine."
5.0,"it is so cute. nice material also. has a hole for ponytail in the back, with a little elastic band.<br />it fits my 4 year old, and i think it will fit her a few more years maybe."
5.0,"I bought a bunch of these and wear them everyday. I love these socks. They feel like a fresh brand new pair every time I put them on.  I like the low cut, quality feel, and quality look."
5.0,"The sizing is in UK for whatever reason, so just up the US size by one. They broke in quickly and kept sick dry in the rain. My only complaint is the shoelace is a little thin but that's an easy fix."
5.0,"Very pretty bracelet! It is a little smaller/narrower than I thought it would be, but it still looked nice on my wide wrist. I love that the size is adjustable!"
5.0,Matched the necklace great.
5.0,"I am a CNA-i wash my hands A LOT when I'm working and I don't like having a germ trap attached to my wrist. I liked the idea of having a watch to take vitals with hanging from my neck. This little watch was just what i needed. VERY affordable, and very handy hanging from a chain along with my name tag. It is also quite attractive and professional-looking (I've received a lot of compliments on it). I even wear it when I go out sometimes just because i like the look of it hanging from my long, silver chain.<br />There is only one problem that i have had with it and that is the little ""clips"" that attach to the watch itself don't hold it very tight and have slipped off a couple of times. I actually put a tiny drop of Gorilla Glue on each clip and it created a spot for the clips to rotate and not pop off. This thing gets some abuse and whenever I need to I can replace the gorilla glue and it works great! I would (and have) recommend this to someone in the health profession who needs a cheap, accurate, and professional-looking watch and anyone else who likes a different sort of time keeper.<br />For 5 bucks shipped you can't really beat the price and the quality is awesome too."
5.0,"Usually a large, purchased xlarge and they fit parfect."
5.0,Great quality and fast delivery!!
5.0,"Love it, Thank You."
5.0,Loved it its very flattering I'm 5 feet 145 pounds with a big butt. Definitely will be buying more colors.
5.0,Best belt I've ever purchased.  So far it is the most durable.  I bought it a little large and once I realized I could cut it down to my right size fit without damaging the belt or causing any cosmetic problems I was sold. I'm a bigger guy but always seem to have bad wear and tear on my belts but so far after a few months this one still looks brand new.
5.0,"They are a gift for grandson. But, know he will like them."
5.0,"Great feel and look, helps keep keys organized, does require retightning from time to time."
5.0,I ordered this for a wedding . The dress is beautiful and the detail is beautifully. I am 5”0 and 130lbs. The arms were a little longer but nothing unusual as I am short. I did have to return it as it was too long on me and not enough time to hem it for the wedding. But I highly recommend this product. The material is beautiful and the dress itself is elegant. It is not see through thick material and very unique.
5.0,I have received so many compliments on these earrings...and they were less than $8!!! They are gorgeous and definitely make an outfit complete and classier!
5.0,Lightweight and inexpensive. Perfect for an outer layer when running to the gym.
5.0,I got these for my Mom because she is always complaining about being cold during the winter.  These are light weight enough that it is easy for her to wear them under her normal clothes and she is very happy with how warm they keep her.  This stuff is expensive but nothing is too good for Mom.
5.0,"True to size. Very stretchy and comfortable. Squat proof, but no real compression."
5.0,Cute dangly 🥰
5.0,Awesome long lasting tights
5.0,Sister n law loves it

5.0,Fit perfectly to complete my Harley Quinn costume. Fast delivery. Arrived in time for Halloween. Great price.

5.0,Loved the suspenders attached
5.0,This swimsuit arrived earlier than expected and the fit/ quality is amazing! The price was unbeatable as well!
5.0,Convo piece!
5.0,"Like so many other families, I have a little mine craft fan at my house as well.  He flipped at seeing this and I have to wait until he falls asleep to get it from him.  It is well made and true to fit."
5.0,"Love these shoes, just what I ordered."
5.0,"I have a lot of sterling silver rings (it compliments my Casper-like skin tone) and I really like this particular one. It's extremely well cast; all the fine detail work stands up to close scrutiny. Genuine sterling silver, not plated copper or the like. My only complaint might be that this is one of those hollow-backed rings with no cuts at all, so it can turn the top of your finger into a little terrarium after several hours on a warm day. But that's typical of all rings of this type, so it is what it is. Not something to subtract a star over. The middle-eastern tree of life motif is quite beautiful, at least in my opinion. If you like the style, you'll probably like the ring."
5.0,They are so comfortable I love them
5.0,"Adorable and so comfy. I'm 5'7&#34; and about 130lbs, and it fits me perfect."
5.0,one broke

5.0,Love em they fit perfectly!!!:)
5.0,"Really great sandals. Beware they run just at tad small. I am a size 13, and a 13 just barely does the trick of n these."
5.0,"This bag is very cute, I brought it for my daughter and she loves it."
5.0,I love these gloves.  They fit very well and are very comfortable.  They are also very stylish.  A good buy.  I wish they come in carmel color.
5.0,Great product well made nice materials shipped and received quickly
5.0,Got tons if compliments. No one would believe how much it costs!
5.0,Bought this necklace for my fiance for Christmas and she has not taken it off yet. She loves it! Beautiful piece of jewelry and the price just seals the deal.
5.0,It looks so beautiful and real! I absolutely love it!!!!!
5.0,This denim jacket is soooo cute! I love it! I ordered a medium and it's a little tight in the arms. (I have slightly bigger arms for my frame). But other than that it's great!
5.0,"Beautiful fall colors. Not too thin for starting school in classroom. My grandson is 10, loves them. Easy care no wrinkles easy to move in."
5.0,I love the color and the size is just right for things you need...
5.0,Very breathable!!
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:98fcfc324f143e14e8a6cd2c87c6b3be]] Sanxiner's leather rose wristlet is perfect to carry your essentials! First of all, the pattern gives a young feminine style that can be casual or dressy. Most wristlets have one large zipper compartment with a small side zippered compartment inside. This wristlet is a good organizer with an outside zippered pocket and a long zippered pocket that divides the overall compartment. Plus, you have the small side inside pocket. I can fit a small wallet, lip gloss and a compact, my iPhone 5s with Otterbox and ladies' toiletries. This is perfect for when I run into a store and do not want to carry my large purse. Unfortunately, I have a habit of leaving my purse in grocery cart when I walk to retrieve an item from the store shelf. Just in those few seconds someone could take my purse. The wristlet allows me to focus on my shopping without forgetting about my purse. Thanks for watching!"
5.0,Lightweight and very comfortable!  The material is soft.  It's a fairly wide headband but can be doubled over if you don't want such a wide headband.
5.0,"I get so many compliments on this bag.  I do not carry my laptop in in regulary but I have and it does fit.  I normally have it full of papers and file folders.  After reading other reviews about the strap coming off due to weight, I decided not to hang my bag to store it when I get to work.  I just set it on the floor.  So, the only time the strap gets used is when I am carrying it around.  That pretty much consists of me walking to the car and back.<br /><br />I would purchase again.  This bag is beautifully made and seems like it will last me a long time.  The bag is also at an exceptional price."
5.0,Just a tad bit tighter than expected..could have been little more sparkly....looked GREAT
5.0,Gorgeous 😍 fit was beautiful wore with a pair of sneakers and a jeans jacket received so many compliments
5.0,"My husband loves his banana republic shirts that we have bought off of Amazon. That company just seems to get it right every time.  The cut, the color, the fabric and the wicking action are perfect!  I'm satisfied with this purchase and would purchase from the seller again."
5.0,Really cute - love it with leggings.  Very comfortable.  True to size.
5.0,very nice..lots of room
5.0,Love the underwear.  Very comfortable.
5.0,They fit perfect and took away all the glare while driving
5.0,Shipped quickly and it is beautiful!
5.0,"This is one of the most flattering robes I have ever had. But it's not for short people! I am 5' 8&#34; and the length on the size Small was perfect for me. It reached a bit higher than the floor (with flat shoes). The material is so comfortable and lightweight and does not wrinkle when you wash it or fold it. It is a tad see-through, but I imagine it only being a problem on the lighter colors. I got the black with floral print and it is not see-through enough to make a difference. The robe also washes beautifully: I wash on cold cycle and hang on a hanger to dry."
5.0,The aprons were great!  Sturdy and very functional.
5.0,They totally block blue laser. The only thing I don’t like is that my glasses don’t fit inside. I have to wear my glasses outside of them. I wish they were larger.
5.0,This was great! Such a variety for every style! Perfect for a gift or to keep for yourself!
5.0,I bought these for my husband. He is on his feet all day at work and these have been great!  They are excellent quality!

5.0,Great product for the price.Easy to adjust and install.
5.0,"These really work, and how delighted my 4 year old was when he looked down at his feet and said &#34; oh I have little doggies&#34;. I had not shown the animal feature at first because I was afraid he might think them silly, but he loves them and has also commented in these recent snow storm and his rigorous playing in the snow &#34; look mommy the doggies kept my feet nice and dry&#34; ! You just cant beat that! I would like the makes to add some non slip feature on the soles because they would make superior slippers as well!"
5.0,Cute dress. Comfortable and can be dressed up or more causal.
5.0,Quick shipping and delivery
5.0,Fits my 4 year old great. She loved it.
5.0,"Fit perfectly, very nice for price. Pleasantly surprised how well it fits. Am 4'9 very difficult to find clothes that don't require significant alterations. Probably going to get another in a different design"
5.0,"Love this shirt, it's super cute. True to size it fit great."
5.0,I ordered these shirts to run in and at this price point you can't beat it. Material is good. Fit is good. Excellent shirt for overall fitness activities.
5.0,Beautiful pearls. My wife loves them.

5.0,So much better than socks. will buy again
5.0,Great quality!  No odors or discrepancies.
5.0,Super adorable it was also fast delivery
5.0,This is a well made and beautifully designed bag. I love that it is an authorized Frida Kahlo product. I was gifted the design in black and I absolutely love it. It is perfect for someone like me who looses everything in “name brand” bags/purses. I love the size and how well it goes with just about any outfit.
5.0,Seems to be longer lasting than other plastic replacement bands. Very happy with this band.
5.0,"Super cute, super soft headbands. My little one is 9 months, but has a very large head. These fit great and do not leave marks on her head."
5.0,"My daughter needed something that looked like a hospital gown for an acting monologue.  I didn't want to spend a lot, so I purchased this.  I expected it to be thin and scratchy, but since she would only be wearing it for a short time I didn't care.  I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived.  The quality is nice, and the fabric is comfortable. So much so that she will wear it around the house. I ordered a large, and it fit my 12-year-old daughter perfectly (granted she is small for her age)."
5.0,"Truly impressed with this wallet!!! Easy access to everything you need, compact and comfortable. I've bought a few, and will buy more in the future! Only thing is the stich around the top of ID and card holder tears to often and to soon...."
5.0,Nice shirt good delivery
5.0,Love the fit and comfort.  Should differently buy up one size when purchasing.
5.0,Little big but she will grow into it. She absolutely loves this .
5.0,Very pretty. Choose a size higher if you are a plus size. I did fits great love the materal!
5.0,have had it about a year and still has that leather smell. hmmm
5.0,Purchased for a gag gift.  Was the hit of the party.

5.0,"for the price, it was a great buy. we wore this for my brothers wedding and it looked really nice! quality is pretty good as well"
5.0,"This is the second garment ordered from Yesno and they're reliable and prompt.  I  purchased the red floral pullover coat in a Large A180 Cr4. It's lovely! You can trust it's 100% cotton fabric, the sewing is solidly done, it's warm, unique, and fantastic quality!  The fit is on the large side as seen on the model and that's what I expected, I'm very satisfied with this purchase. Bravo!"
5.0,Excelente diseño y acabado
5.0,These arrived packaged very well. My daughter painted the headband part because it doesn’t hide well on her light hair and the looked great on her. She paired them with a flower headband for a “fairy” look at a local Ren Fest.
5.0,"I bought this necklace as a gift, and it turned out to be awesome for the price. The rope that holds the pendant can actually be tightened or loosened to either be a long necklace or a choker style necklace. I thought it was great!"
5.0,Very pretty. Genuine wood and leather.
5.0,"Great bracelet for young boys, pre-teens. Nice surfer type look.  Gave them as Christmas presents to three boys and they all liked them very much.  Great deal."
5.0,cool shoes- sporty and comfortable
5.0,Good key chain now I feel safer while I'm out and about
5.0,"I wish I could give more than 5 stars. Seriously, this suit is beautiful and flattering. I will say I ordered up 1-2 sizes because I don't like an uncomfortably tight swimsuit. I am usually between a size 10-12, but I ordered a size 14 and it is a perfect fit! For reference, I am 5'4"" and about 175-180lbs. I will be ordering another color!"
5.0,I absolutely love it and felt beautiful for my courthouse wedding but it was a little shorter than I thought still very pretty and elegant though
5.0,I bought two pair. and they look great.  I could have spent more at Dillard's but these fit perfect especially with my big calves.
5.0,Ordered this for my sister; she’s about 128lbs and 5’5. She loves it!
5.0,"Will see after some use how great they are.<br />If no update in this review, that means that they are holding up just fine."
5.0,Very comfortable and slimming!
5.0,Love it.  I cut the pins off the back and glued a magnet to the back.
5.0,"I ordered these because I like the look of aviator glasses but cannot wear the metal frames and bendable nose pads...my face destroys them. These are perfect being entirely plastic, I dont have to worry about them being crooked or bent out of shape when I need them and they look like classic aviators."
5.0,These caps are really comfortable and very good looking. I love it..
5.0,"Nice bracelet! I liked it so much, I ordered each color. It's comfortable and even though there's volume to it, I forget that I have it on. The magnet is very strong. It has a nice sparkle to it. I love it."
5.0,Looks great love how it’s adjustable for my big head and covers all my hair
5.0,BOUGHT FOR MY AUNT AND SHE LOVES IT. GOOD QUALITY!
5.0,"This scarf is reasonably priced for a kente graduation scarf. The material is a little lighter than expected, however, it serves its purpose and looks wonderful on a graduation gown. I would recommend purchasing this as it is a great value and stands out when worn."
5.0,I’m 21 weeks pregnant and this has room for me to grow while still keeping me warm
5.0,"This is not just a cheap costume piece.  It has a nice weight to it and it looks very nice.  It is slightly form fitting in the waist but not tight, flowing on the ends and it drapes well when sitting.  The size fits well.  A good buy for sure."
5.0,"These are amazing! Great size, cool tint, and overall great look! EXACTLY like the picture!😄"
5.0,Excellent product...!  Price was great.
5.0,I love this necklace. I love the cut and feel of the stones.
5.0,Plastic blades...stickers are just as expected and headband fits great
5.0,"This bag is beautiful, high quality and with a very nice price tag. I would definitely recommend it."
5.0,I bought these for my daughter and she loved them.  She found expensive ones at a boutique and was just as happy with these.  Great buy for your money.
5.0,Fast delivery. The laces are just what I was looking for. I will be ordering another pair in a different color for my other shoes. So glad you carry these!
5.0,Wore these fishing today.  Love how light they are and so comfortable. Really stopped the glare off the watee.
5.0,"Order this early for Halloween. First, it is exactly as pictured, which is rare. Great colors. I read alot of reviews on the sizing, but I purchased this immediately post partum and still had about 1.5 months until I needed it. I am 5'7"" and normally 135. So I purchased a small, I am still not back to 135, currently 155-160 but I am keeping the small because A- it looks just fine besides the lighter colors in the tighter places and B- I will loose the weight eventually. ;-) Hope the pics help. Paired with white out contacts, blue wig and will do some crazy makeup the day of."
5.0,I love this brand. As they release more colors I will buy kore and more. Great quality that stands up to commercial washing and the fit is perfection. The long sleeve for winter and incredible too. The length hits low enough to cover but not too low to hang out. Right below the hip bone on me.
5.0,Every business traveler needs on of these
5.0,"After several months of using this band everyday, I must say I still think it’s my favorite band yet. As long as you get the right size it will stay place on your wrist and not slide around pinching hairs. The only con is that there is a bit of fading in the finish on the bottom where it rubs against my laptop."
5.0,"New favorite! Great fit, soft, stretchy, super cute."
5.0,Is a beautiful piece of blessing art. The item was delivered on time!!!!
5.0,If it's excellent nice loose fitting love the material.
5.0,This is absolutely beautiful.  It was more than I expected.
5.0,"Awesome product.<br />I have purchased literally hundreds of lanyards over the years and this is my favorite.<br />The small string on the bottom is easy to attach to ID packs, smart phone cases' (mine is attached to the bottom speaker punch-out on my case).<br />I am very active and my phone would constantly slide out of my shirt pocket and now I don't care because the lanyard keeps it form hitting the ground!<br />The neck adjustment is a great help.  Keep it shorter if it's in my shirt pocket or full-length if it's in my front pants pocket if I'm wearing a pocket less shirt.<br />Only improvement I would suggest is the quick release could be a bit easier to ""quick release"".<br />I am stopped every day and asked where I got it!  AMAZON!!!<br />Love it!"
5.0,"Love these shorts! A little bit high waisted which I like. I'm 5'6 & 135lbs, I ordered a size large and they fit as expected. Not top quality material, but Its no big deal, because theyre still comfy and for the price theyre great."
5.0,Fits a little narrow so I'm glad I got a bigger size.
5.0,Perfect for my Granddaughter!  She can wear these to the beach or on the deck so she will not get splinters!  Very lightweight.
5.0,"Very high quality sunglasses!  Great finish and fit, A+ product."
5.0,"These shoes are exactly what they look like, very shiny;  but they have some kind of smell like oil and you need to let them sit and air out because its really strong.  The fit was just a fraction big, but thats good, they slide on/off easily, such a great deal for the price.  Id recommend.  if you want nice looking dress shoes and dont want to spend $$, get these.  Some shoe person could possibly tell you more about the pros and cons, but I got what the photo showed."
5.0,"This cloth is the best I've ever used. I cleaned all my jewelry, some of which was pretty tarnished, in minutes! Love this cloth. Will never use any other cloth again!"
5.0,Gorgeous dress! The split is not as open as you can see on picture.
5.0,This is great for anyone that has to carry around a bunch of keys. Facilities folks at a University etc.
5.0,Lots of great comments on it. Now to find an led harness.
5.0,"I purchased this as a back support instead of a corset or tummy trimmer belt.  Lumbar back supports tend to be a bit short on their height, and in order to get really good support, they should be taller.  This corset cincher is a bit taller than most lumbar supports.  Also important for a back support is breathability.  Most back supports are made from neoprene, which means that they make you very hot and sweaty when wearing them.  Neoprene tends to roll over when you wear it at the waist, so the neoprene style belts tend to get shorter as you wear them as they begin to scrunch up or roll.  This belt is more breathable than the neoprene belts, and it has soft plastic stays at the sides to help keep it from rolling down.  It is not as stretchy as the neoprene supports, but it doesn't roll down as much as they do, so that is a good thing.  You will need to order your waist size (using their chart) in order to get a good fit.  This is not one of those one size fits most type of products.  I have had similar back braces in the past, and the non-neoprene ones (like this one) last and tend to be taller (which is the main reason that I purchase them).  I would recommend this as an affordable back brace for anyone who needs a bit of lower (lumbar) back support."
5.0,"Lite weight, can actually  breathe"
5.0,Super cute. Great summer dress.
5.0,"I got these for my husband, a machinist on the naval submarine needs silicone for safety. The ring doesn’t look silicone from normally conversation-distance, I love it. He loves it, they are true to size."
5.0,"This skirt is really great! I'm 5""3 and 136 pounds and I ordered a medium! A small may have been too tight but I do think I could have gotten it zipped! the skirt is light, flowy, and easy to wear! I ordered the red one that has the bandana print"
5.0,"These shirts are so tremendous. Very well made. Good quality fabric. The fit is perfect. If any one is looking for a good work shirt, this is it."
5.0,"Some people complained about these, but I loved them.  Nice fabric, good fit, wash and dry well.  Wish I could order more."
5.0,Love the color and the softness!
5.0,"Omg! Love this dress. I have a hard time finding dresses that hang well, and I'm usually disapointed with the product.  I'm 5' 3&#34;, 125 lbs, ordered a large,  fits perfectly for me. The a-line style is very flattering.  May have to order another color. Happy me!!!"
5.0,"Good socks, comfortable and my legs feel better after wearing them all day. It's a feat to put them on, but comes with instructions which helps a lot."
5.0,I. Love this!!! Built like a coresset with wires at top. Fits smooth under clothes.Flattens stomach and slims sides<br /><br />I am a size 4 pant Nd ordered Medium and it fits perfect
5.0,Fits great i purchased 24 months.
5.0,I bought a size 20 and they fit great
5.0,I am a cancer survivor and this is just great
5.0,Looks good tied.  Only improvement would be to have the sizing labeled on at holes.
5.0,My son and his teammates loves these necklaces to unify their team! Great quality and price compared to the stores!
5.0,GrandKids love them!!! Great fit on 2 and 4 year-olds.
5.0,The fabric and the way it looked on me
5.0,Love the heat these have and very lightweight and durable.  Bought 3 of these for me and sons. Only issue is xl is tight on me and they don't make a 2x.
5.0,"So soft, this is a fantastic buy! I've had my eye on the designer look alike version of this for months and am so glad I went with this option vs. the option that is 3x as much. If you're on the fence, just buy it - you won't regret!"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:3d0cb81b27006de91cd7e79c86c242cc]] Got the white one and the brown one to match so my daughter and her best friend could wear on twin day. They were so cute!! Love this sweater
5.0,Love this item very good quality and I love the style
5.0,"Great purchase, dark tint keeps the sun out of my eyes. I drive a convertible so I need something that really blocks the sunlight."
5.0,We all looked so cute in our hats!
5.0,Love them.  Very nice.
5.0,"This case is portable, mobile and stores a lot items when DJing!"
5.0,"Color was true to the picture, super soft and giving. Slightly see through, by only when you look at it on the hanger! Very curve hugging haha just shows me I need to lose a few pounds before I wear it! Bought for a Halloween costume and planning to wear this on the regular!"
5.0,"It is really minimal and I love everything about it, but the adjustment button broke after about 1 month of usage."
5.0,The jeans are exactly as described. Great fit. Great feel.<br />Thanks!!
5.0,Daughter loves it. Keeps all my granddaughters animals in it.
5.0,"Love the fabric, love the pockets that have zippers!"
5.0,A small issue with a snap was handled promptly and very satisfactory.
5.0,"Nice gloves. Comfortable. Leather is supple and lining is soft.<br /><br />The size runs a bit small, I measured my hands carefully and consulted the sizing chart in the photos above before ordering size L, but they were too tight and too short in the fingers. I exchanged for a size XL, and they fit nicely."
5.0,The printing on the shirt is clear and looks really nice. Thanks for a great T-shirt.
5.0,Is perfec
5.0,"SO COMFORTABLE!!!! I wish there were solid colors, I'd order more of them. This is my new home outfit. Material is soft, feels wonderful. I'm also a 3/4X and it fits fine, there's plenty of room in it. My boyfriend calls me a Tetris ghost because of the flowiness and stripes. GET USED TO TETRIS GHOST, buddy."
5.0,"Best birthday party favor ever!!!!!! The kids loved this finger light, and I will be buying again for next year birthday party."
5.0,Perfect size and weight for my 5 year old with sensitive ears.
5.0,"Easy to open and close, and the outside has a really soft, almost velvety feel to it.  The cleaning cloth that comes with it is huge compared to my others, but it's a bit rough and I'm not sure I'll use it.  I end up using my shirt to clean my glasses more often than not, anyway."
5.0,Fits great. Looks great.  It's doesn't have the same coverage as shapewear but it does improve you outline a bit and a little help is better than none. The quality is good.
5.0,It was the perfect watch for my 9 year old daughter. She loves penguins and her favorite color is purple. It fits her perfectly!
5.0,Exactly what I needed to finish a diaper bag for a gift.

5.0,"I’m a sucker for One Piece merch especially this one, stylish and truly functional"
5.0,"Loved it and so did my daughter. Colors are vibrant, fabric is soft and snuggly. Adorable. There was a rip when it arrived, but the seller contacted me back right away to make it right and is sending a replacement with no hassle."
5.0,Well to be honest I purchased this shirt to use as a belt :) works good with me!

5.0,"They came in a damaged package, they are all bent up and broke :("
5.0,"For years I've looked for a simple card-holder without bells and whistles,  one that would do it's job without fuss.  The Hibate Leather Credit Card Holder/Wallet does that perfectly,  The leather, stitching and overall finish is of high quality, equal (and even superior) to many other wallets I've looked at for considerably more money."
5.0,This shirt has easily become my new favorite article of clothing.<br /><br />It fits accurately to size.<br />Fabric is very comfortable and lightweight. The embroidery is very well done.
5.0,For work in the sun

5.0,These glasses are extra and they are so cool looking and on top i got a second diffrent pair that are unique to very pleased with my purchase
5.0,I like the quality and I like it that wen your wearing pants r a long skirt u don't have to put those long knee highs on.I didn't know they had a lace footie stocking made on to them but that's ok they will still look good and benefit me I think everyone should a least try them to see a good price to.
5.0,"Solid, durable, and just absolutely awesome!"
5.0,This is great to carry with you for small trips and it keeps your info safe. My friends loves the color
5.0,Bought the size 6 for my 5 year old. Straps aren't adjustable and they're a bit too long and the legs are a bit short. Neither is a big deal as the romper is well made and so super cute on my daughter. It came with a long ribbon of fabric in the same design as the romper and I've been using that to tie the straps. Daughter loves it!<br />EDIT: My husband accidentally put it in the washing machine and it's fraying. The legs are even shorter. Really too bad as it's adorable but the sewing is terrible.
5.0,Ordered these for work (I’m a dancer in Vegas) they were super soft and fit amazing (even though I don’t have much booty these make my butt look great!! And all the guys love the denim jorts (Jean shorts) lol will definitely buy more!!
5.0,Love this cover up. It fit very nicely. What I love most is the material and quality. It is SO soft and flowy. The quality and design makes it look very elegant. I am about 5'8 and it came just to my knees in front and longer in the back
5.0,"Husband loved them . Soft, comfortable and fun."
5.0,Great product and company!!!
5.0,Read above!
5.0,I love  this jacket ... I luv  northface ..<br />Will purchase from u again
5.0,"Very comfy flip flops, excellent quality/price ratio. The only thing is they wear small. I wear a 9 and ordered initially size 9. I had to return them and ordered a size 10. They delivered a size 11 and surprisingly they fit well. Never worn a size 11 before lol ;) other than that, I recommend them!"
5.0,So much yes!
5.0,Very well made! So happy I added this to our baby registry. Our baby is 6 months and these are just perfect. Love the double zipper!- makes changing when it’s cold so much easier. And the fabric is just SO butter soft.
5.0,My first grader loves it.  Seems fairly sturdy as well.  Pleasantly surprised about how well attached the handles seem.
5.0,"I don’t have a photo, and even if I did I’m selfish. Trust me though, you’ll wanna touch the butt. If you have the butt in question, you’ll love the fit and the pockets."
5.0,"I bought this while in my final trimester but I'm slender framed pre pregnancy so it fit great with my belly, but super perfect without.  Nice fabric and has some give to it so it hugs my curves just right. I ordered a medium so it would huh my curves and Im glad I did.  I can dress it up or dress it down"
5.0,Belt is real sharp!! Would tell anyone that it is great in price and high quality product
5.0,"Great value, comfortable, fit is good, supportive, and no lumpy, folded or lost cup pads after washing."
5.0,Cute bag. Exactly what I’ve been searching for. A light weight crossbody bag with handles. Roomie enough for me to put more stuff in it for when I’m out with kids. And it’s small enough that it doesn’t get in my way.
5.0,"So cute, especially for the price.  I got so many compliments and I felt like it was very flattering for a pear shape.  The top looks like cotton and the bottom is a sturdy, thicker polyester type material.  I wore it to a backyard wedding and got several compliments for the unique pattern."
5.0,Love it! It's so sturdy. It is small but not too small yet roomy enough for all the necessities. It's great for a day trip and more. Recommend!
5.0,"Love this thing! Super comfy, warm, and pretty looking!  It is a bit large on me, which I’m fine with given it’s a wrap. (I’m 5’2, 130 lbs)"
5.0,"I love the style.  Very different.  It runs a bit big and sometimes small. I'm 5/6  weight 147 I took a large, it was very roomy.  I later ordered a medium, was somewhat tight."
5.0,Order was received in a timely manner .
5.0,"Awesome, even arrived earlier than expected. The picture is very nice.... and I have many others from other sites this one is superior."
5.0,My girls love them. It's testing season at school and they've got the ready with lavender.
5.0,"It is a little bugger than I anticipated, but it is well constructed and I really like how it looks.<br />The beads are all wood and the clamp is metal."
5.0,Muy bonito todo...
5.0,Amazingly thick and he says very comfortable. They cost a bit more and seems like they will last quite some time before wearing out.
5.0,"Cute tank but be wary of the &quot;one size fits all&quot; they use to describe it. I typically wear a juniors small and this tank fits like a juniors small. Form fitting for sure. The print is nice, I actually own a framed copy of the multicolored skull already. I've only hand washed it a few times so far but it seems to be holding up."
5.0,"Nice material, pattern is as pictured and shipping was quick."
5.0,He loved em
5.0,"I LOVE this diffuser necklace!!!  I wear it every day, without fail.It is made of sturdy stainless steel that is, at the same time, pretty enough to wear to dressy occasions. The pads fit perfectly into the space provided.  The magnetic closure stays securely closed.  I get many comliments on the fragrance others share from this diffuser necklace.  Pick your favorite pattern without hesitation."
5.0,My Grandkids loved them.
5.0,"Really nice<br />Makes it for work, meeting and other formal take out."
5.0,"This is a great product, easy to use and clean."
5.0,Wonderful dress from my favorite source.
5.0,"Beautiful, even on a plus size arm"
5.0,"I purchased these for my daughter, and they fit as expected.  She loves that they're Paw Patrol.  She doesn't used the strap in the back; she slides her foot into the shoe leaving the strap on the top of her foot, so I cut this off.  No issues with this shoe."
5.0,"Perfect dress for my teenage daughter, who's very picky!<br />She loved this dress. It fits perfectly fine and looks really really good on her. She was so happy after getting this dress.  Loved this dress!"
5.0,"Great, well made boots. Just as nice as bogs. VERY VERY GOOD VALUE. Don't hesitate buying these!!"
5.0,Very well made. Not too dark too
5.0,"My name means ""the bee"" so I was looking for a nice pendant to wear that was too over the top big. This necklace is just what I wanted. It's not made out of any fancy material but it looks good to me. It hasn't turned green and doesn't irritate my skin."
5.0,"I love this ring.  The color of the moonstone is excellent, better then it shows in the picture."
5.0,"These earrings are wonderful.  They stand out with the gorgeous stones and the design.  I am so happy that I found this company.  If I wasn't on a budget I would buy lots more.  And, the company itself is wonderful!"
5.0,The gloves were indeed extra large.  the work for what i needed them for.
5.0,There is nothing I dislike about this product.
5.0,Love it<br /><br />Quality excellent multiple  choices<br /><br />Purchased many to give away...
5.0,Great sweatshirt!!!!
5.0,My husband like the phone case
5.0,Have other sandals like these and they are great they fit as they should love them ...
5.0,This shoe was so beautiful. I wore them to my birthday dinner in Vegas. They are a head turner for sure. But they hurt my feet so bad I had to change right after dinner.
5.0,I bought this for my daughter and she just loves it! It is very comfortable and easy to use. She likes it better than the ones she picked out for herself!
5.0,Absolutely love this bag!! It has great versitility!
5.0,Very soft and stretchy yet springs into shape wonderfully.  This goes for all 5 different pairs that I bought.
5.0,"I love this top. It fits true to size. I usually wear XL. I purchased XXL because I was afraid that it was going to run small. I should've got XL. I kept it because it's a great top, just a little big."
5.0,am in love with this dress
5.0,"I tend to be really picky about sunglasses. I don't like wire rimmed and most women's sunglasses sit on my cheeks rather than my nose. I am not trendy in the least, being a 38 year old mom of 6 kids. I just want something cute, fun, and that fits me well. These fit the bill! They're also lightweight don't slide down my nose, and are really comfy on my ears. Fantastic find for me! Going to order another pair for back-up... ;)"
5.0,Grand daughter like this item
5.0,Loved the suit!! Son wore it to his 8th grade dance!
5.0,I like it - it is a nice necklace looks good with tons of outfits!

5.0,Really nice and the material is very good
5.0,Good wuay
5.0,"It's cute. Thought that it would be a bit thicker, but it is still a cute shirt and fits well."
5.0,perfect cover up! flattering without being too revealing. super soft material and great fit.
5.0,They keep up well with my very active 2 year old!
5.0,"I got size 7-8 for my 2.5 year old and they fit him well.. They are slightly on the small side, but with the elastic heal, they stay on well and give him room to grow.  He loves them and they keep his feet warm. He is able to kick them off easily but needs a little help putting them on."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:4e0892f29f3957ac642b0d6f957c8c99]] Great price, fast delivery. Second time ordering these, only all black this time. They are awesome."
5.0,"Prompt shipping, as described"
5.0,Great for storing extra glasses in one place
5.0,Love be this top!!! Fun can wear w jeans or for a dresser look wear with sexy leggings
5.0,I love this sweater.  Soft and comfortable.  May order it in another color because I like it so much.
5.0,this is exactly what I wanted. I was afraid it would be cheap looking but it is not. I like the feel of the material. I will wear it to run in during the holidays and I like that the fabric is not to thick.
5.0,Very nice and generous size.  I highly recommend this product!  I'm very impressed rollers work real smooth! Thank you for the GREAT price 😍
5.0,My wife loves Del Rossa  products. She was thrilled with  the 3 robes/shirts and as usual fits her perfectly and made well.
5.0,"Love these so much! they are so comfy for my 18 month old. 2nd pair for us, we have pink and purple.<br />My only problem is that it gets dirty super quick. A quick wash with the laundry is helpful but doesn’t stay clean very long."
5.0,Love this super cutie shirt
5.0,"Irish eyes are indeed smiling over this lovely little charm. As described, fits my Pandora bracelet. Celebrates my travel history."
5.0,These are my favorite earrings.
5.0,I love the pattern and colors of these hankies.
5.0,Loved it and so did everyone else. I got so many compliments.
5.0,Great fit and fantastic value.
5.0,"it suits my purpose but there are no instructions for how to actually attach the band, you just have to kind of figure it out.  There are instructions for removing a link but they are only pictures on the outside of the box."
5.0,"As I write this review, it's hard to give it a rating because I always factor in the price point for an item like this and they're currently unavailable.  What I'm reviewing is 18 of the Silver Bangles, as opposed to the gold or the mixed set.<br /><br />I personally love this type of bangle because they're lightweight and they dress up your outfit a bit.  You can wear quite a few without adding a lot of weight to your arm.  I may sound like I'm 5 years old when I say this, but I like the little tinkling noise they make.  The bangles are quite pretty with some engraving that catches the light a little and gives a bit of shimmer.<br /><br />I have fairly small wrists and hands - I wear a Small glove, for example - and they're a good size for me.  I measured the circumference, which is approximately 8.5 inches - and the opening of the circle that forms the bracelet, which is approximately 2.75 inches.  They do not fall off my hands, as can be the case with some bracelets.<br /><br />Being somewhat short and needing petite sleeve length clothes and coats, I wouldn't wear all 18 at one time, but a taller or larger person might.  I think 6 at a time is about my limit, so if you buy these bracelets and find 18 to be more than you need, you can always share.  I haven't worn them enough to know if they hold their shape, but they seem to be as sturdy as any I've seen - and I think they'd be durable for normal use.<br /><br />The bracelets came in a little fabric bag that I'm guessing is burlap that has a drawstring.  I think these bracelets are the type of jewelry that is classic and timeless, but also ageless and women of all ages would wear them (they would be too large for children).  Depending on the cost when they're available, they'd be an excellent stocking stuffer for an older teen, young adult or even Grandma."
5.0,"Really nice staff, cheap and good looking!"
5.0,"Love this bracelet, it’s a softer leather, not stiff, and the magnetic dovetail clasp stays on well."
5.0,This top was so pretty and cute. I need to size down to a medium. I am 34C. It’s so dainty and pretty
5.0,"My sister sent me this. A hug from me to you, to show I care, to see you through, Just hold me tight & keep me near.<br /> A hug to show I’m always here."
5.0,Good quality shirt feels soft and durable
5.0,Beautiful and well made. Great value and looks great. Fits well.
5.0,Fit perfectly!  Love them!
5.0,"Very cute, just like the picture"
5.0,Don’t know but Wife loves it!
5.0,I get tons of compliments on this bracelet. It is much prettier in real life than on the screen.
5.0,Loved the fit. They look great. My Son loves them. Great price1p0
5.0,These are very dark glasses. Love them for the very sunny days.
5.0,These earrings are very nice in size and colors. I can match with my tops. Love them. Thank you.
5.0,Got it for my grandson who doesn't like loud noises.  Loves his headphones.
5.0,"Cute, casual skirt. Has a bit of stretch, so it suitable for curves"
5.0,Looks good for a cheap piece of jewelry.
5.0,Beautiful dress I got a lot of compliments for friends I can’t believe I paid $30 for this dress
5.0,"I liked the design and it's comfortable, and has a filter pocket."
5.0,Its so beautiful
5.0,Great fit.  Color was just as I expected.  Very pleased with the selection. Actually ordered another color.
5.0,The material is soft  and moves with your body. It's very flattering  and extremely comfortable.
5.0,Had the small band break on one after about 3 months of wearing it. Everything else works well. Lots of compliments on designs and colors.
5.0,"I bought this scarf for my son. I was hoping he would like it but was even more surprised when he fell in love with it. Not only was the scarf beautiful to look at, it was also so soft and well made and extremely long so he could wrap it around himself really well in the cold weather. This scarf is worth twice the price I paid you for it. Thank you so much."
5.0,They are great and work well for me out in the sun with my over sensitive eyes
5.0,I live my watch band it’s comfortable and looks like the picture
5.0,Cute shirt for the price.
5.0,Great price. Nice quality. Acrylic but &#34;wool like&#34;.
5.0,Loved this saying. Great keychain!
5.0,Looks exactly like the advertised charm and it looks amazing on my bracelet.
5.0,Nice then they looked. Great quality.
5.0,Everyone at my office loved it! It’s so cute and comfy and has pockets!
5.0,I've only bought the red pair and my oh my...they look FIERY and STUNNING! They are roughly 1.2 inches from the bottom to the top-most part of the hook. The spirals provide an added touch to these beauties.
5.0,"Honestly love this! I got this case as a replacement to the one that came with my glasses. The old one was barely glued together and the lining was constantly detaching from the hard shell. This bothered me so I got one of these.<br /><br />So far it's been a fantastic case. Love the colors, lining, giant cleaning cloth, and little repair tool. Always carry it with me now."
5.0,"I got these on Amazon because I saw them in a Running Shop but they were way expensive. I often get joint pain in my hips or knees when I run. I save these leggings for races (so I won’t wear them out) and I never hurt. They do fit really tight, but I think they’re supposed to."
5.0,Very cute. My two year old wore it on her cousins bday party and we received tons of compliments. Fabric doesn’t feel cheap. Looks as good as the advertised picture
5.0,"Note: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.<br /><br />I was contacted by the seller to review this shirt for them and I love it. Now, these shirts are more for athletic built people because they are tight to the body, however I use it as an undershirt. It keeps sweat away from my dress shirts or regular t-shirts. If you have a thin body or athletic-built body, this shirt would look great on you. It's stylish and the v-neck gives it a great touch. I would recommend this shirt to anyone to wear it as regular shirt or undershirt.<br /><br />If for some reason my opinion changes about this shirt, I will come back and update my review."
5.0,"This is awesome! I can't believe how well this cloth cleans, and it is so easy! I have old silver necklaces that I love, but have not worn in many years.  They really shine now, and it probably took me five minutes to clean each. Honestly, a great purchase."
5.0,"I haven't worn it a lot yet, but it's great so far.  A little stiff, like others have said, but I think it will soften up over time.  I love the color!  My wrists are pretty small (not quite 6&#34;) and this actually works. I usually have a hard time finding bracelets and watches that fit, so I'm very pleased."
5.0,My granddaughter is 2 and 1/2 snd has wide feet.  This 8 fits perfectly.
5.0,"This strap is good quality, and has the perfect vintage appearance that goes well with traditional or older watches. Leather is flexible and not too stiff. It doesn't give the impression of being fake leather like a lot of straps do.<br /><br />The only thing I would mention is that the buckle is quite beefy, and I imagine would look better with straps of 20mm or more. I'm using an 18mm strap on a 35mm diameter watch that is also very thin, so the buckle seems oversized. Nevertheless, I'm giving it 5 stars because the quality is very good and I can easily replace the buckle."
5.0,"The main thing I love about this is that it was super soft and comfortable. Fit true to size. Even a little roomy, which I like in sweaters/jackets. The design on the front looks like it will survive many washes too. Nice quality."
5.0,Encantada de la compra a mi esposo le gusto mucho !!!😃
5.0,very comfy and excellent hourglass fit
5.0,"This is high quality, at a reasonable price. I use these for craft jewelry and repair of necklaces that have broken."
5.0,Favorite wallet
5.0,Very comfortable long sleeve polo and I get tons of compliments on it. Will buy more.
5.0,"I bought this for my grandsons mother, she loves it."
5.0,They're nice and warm without making it hard to hold things while wearing them.
5.0,Fun hose to wear.
5.0,"I am 5''4&#34; tall and weigh about 120 pounds. I typically wear a US size 2 or a small/ medium in similar styles at retailers like Victoria's Secret, Kohls or JCPenney. I ordered the &#34;Bestlife Ladies Sexy Lingerie Tempting Sling Dress For Sleepwear&#34; in a size medium. It fits me very well. The bust is a halter style, which is adjustable. It fits snug in the chest and flairs open below. The babydoll is on the shorter side, hitting around the hips. The set includes a matching pair of boyshort style panties. Together, this is a cute set to wear to bed. The see through nature of the top makes it a difficult sell for wearing around the house, but this is great for feeling sexy at bedtime.<br /><br />The material is soft synthetic blend. It is very easy to care for. I can wash and dry this garment with like colors on normal settings. The hems and lace detailing are well constructed and smooth and comfortable against the skin. The lace is not itchy. I definitely recommend the &#34;Bestlife Ladies Sexy Lingerie Tempting Sling Dress For Sleepwear&#34; as a gift for yourself or the lady in your life. This is one of my most comfortable babydolls. I wish it was available in multiple colors. It is very competitively priced. Similar items at Victoria's Secret retail for $40+ and then you are charged shipping fees when ordering through their website. This item is $15 with shipping. It ships from overseas, which takes roughly 2 weeks. Overall, the price and quality are unbeatable.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful. If so, I'd appreciate you clicking the &#34;helpful&#34; button!"
5.0,"The dress is very light and cool for the summer. The pattern is pretty and helps camouflage my muffin top and it's true to size. Great dress, thanks!"

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:9a7920cb7e70be9a405c169f397a1477]] I’m a 8.5 women’s and was going to purchase the 7-8.5 but thankfully I sized up to 8.5-9 because the fit perfectly. They are very soft, I thought it was going to be hard plastic but it’s kind of like foam. The color is very nice and I’m happy with my purchase!"
5.0,"I was pleased to find that these fit as expected and so comfortably. They washed well, although the frayed edges got tangled up and don't look so combed and perfect now. I like that they are a modest length without being to my knees and not super short like some daisy duke style cutoffs I have seen. They have a good stretch to them and while I usually don't buy clothing that has been distressed already, these don't bother me too bad. I was also excited to find that the pockets are a decent size. While still not as deep as men's pant pockets, these are a good size and are actually functional."
5.0,This is very cute bi love wearing it.
5.0,I wore this dress for my bridal shower and was absolutely loved it! I received so many compliments on it and the quality was really great
5.0,Fits perfectly and the material is thick and good
5.0,"We bought it for our daughter to wear to her birthday party. And since then she's worn it 15 more times. It fits great, is incredibly adorable and worth every penny."
5.0,Happy with order !
5.0,These are nice and sturdy!  The large is bigger than I expected and sort of heavy.  Probably not to wear all day.
5.0,I just wish the padding was a little wider
5.0,"This casual shirt fit perfectly. Not only does it look great, it's also lightweight and breathable. Perfect for a warm spring day or summer night. It paired nicely with linen pants and jean shorts."
5.0,"My 17 year old autistic daughter is extremely hard to buy clothes for. She has to like the texture and material and the seams have to not be scratchy. I was afraid when they arrived and I noticed that they were pants but when she opened them on Christmas day, she was so excited and she wears them at least twice a week."
5.0,"Very pretty, comfortable, well made."
5.0,Carter's clothes are great and fit our little guy perfectly. They seem to run a bit thinner than other brands which works great for us as our guy is long and skinny. Shorter or chubbier little ones may not fit as well.<br /><br />This outfit is super cute and the usual Carter's quality - soft and holds up nicely.
5.0,This was the PERFECT outfit for my little princess for a harvest Festival!!! She was so comfortable and everyone complimented her on how adorable her outfit was
5.0,"Cheap, still super cute. Obviously not real turquoise beads thAt cheap. Still it's a way cute necklace, exactly in the picture and I've had plenty of compliments on it as well."
5.0,Love this dress! Super flattering and comfy!
5.0,"These are great! Especially for the price, can’t beat it"
5.0,"I wash these on cold and dry these on medium and they don't shrink. And I really appreciate that because I purchased some similar to these and they are like baby socks now. I will have to look to see if I am past the return window, but I am busy with work and other obligations, etc.<br /><br />They do however slip down into my shoe during wear, which is not okay. And I consider socks that slip down into my shoe of poor quality, but maybe it's the way some shoes are made and you have to wear a different texture of sock. But these certainly are very cute and feminine and I love the colors."
5.0,The item is a Christmas gift.  The appear to be very soft.
5.0,"Love it, never take it off."
5.0,"I have a boyish figure so dresses like this make me nervous. I was pleasantly surprised that it framed me well to make me have a little figure, but wasn't tight on my stomach. I am 5'2&#34; and it was a perfect length--I it wore to church on Easter. The color is bright and happy. The only con is that is a liiiiittle see-through, but not enough to be a major concern"
5.0,"Love these, very worth the money"
5.0,Good i like it
5.0,"The linen material feels very comfortable against my skin which is sensitive. It also breaths well, which is good because I get hot and sweat at night."
5.0,The keychain was a hit at my daughters team party.  The girl loved it.  It is rather large but sturdy!
5.0,Love this so much!! My husbands going to enjoy me in this. Fits so comfortably and definitely runs true to size. I'm a small or medium and ordered a medium to be safe and fits perfectly. I'm athletically built. Well made material. Has lots of give. You can move in this. Thanks!
5.0,"Very expensive looking purse, well made.  Pockets for every thing with secure closures.  love that I can carry it with the handles or over my shoulder.  Have had many compliments on it."
5.0,"Soft, comfortable, cute - these socks are terrific. I bought these to wear to Pride, but my husband ended up wearing them. They stretched well for his larger ankles, and were soft and comfortable all day. The colors are bright and they seem woven well. We will be buying more fun MySocks in the future!"
5.0,"I grabbed these for a quick gag. The price is right for a cheap, fun prank item. The packaging is really cute. The soft, fuzzy sleeves for these slip off. They handcuffs are lightweight metal, so I'd imagine that a good, hard yank could pull open some links on the chain. Which is a good thing if you're experimenting or get pranked and want to get out of them quickly.<br />Cool item at a good price. Happy with these."
5.0,"Oliver Peoples makes great glasses if you can find a style you like. They're very well made and come in more of the smaller sizes than most brands. They're quite expensive in the eyeglass shops here, so finding them at a significant discount on Amazon is very helpful.  I am grateful.  This seller is excellent.  When I goofed up and ordered them one week too early for my insurance benefit, I was able to return them and reorder them.  They even sent the replacement pair from their main store in ITALY in 4 days with no extra charge.  It doesn't get any better than this!"
5.0,"This item arrived sooner than expected and looked as described. I read the reviews and sizing information and ordered a large. I should have ordered a medium. I would like the fit to be a bit more snug. Otherwise, I am happy with this item."
5.0,I love this scarf! It's hard to tell by the pictures but it is a thin material but still warm. It can be warn with dressy clothes or with jeans. It is exactly what I was looking for!
5.0,Love these so comfy and you can not see Thur them.<br />Going to see how they hold up as I have only had them on twice.
5.0,I love them. Perfect for a trip to Italy! Very light on my face!
5.0,lovethem
5.0,"Product is easy to apply.  When I rub it in, I see an immediate improvement in the suppleness of the leather, and a real improvement in water protection.  Mink oil remains my choice for preserving my expensive work and hiking boots. Really good stuff.<br /><br /> Red Wing must have changed the formula a little bit since the last time I purchased because the Mink Oil has a different smell.  Not a bad smell, just different than before."
5.0,"True to size, good threading, and have been worn several times without issues. A nice way to dress up an outfit when you have gauged ears!"
5.0,This product is all that I would have expected.  Very pleased with its quality.  Also pleased with how quickly I received this item.  Would buy from them again. Hope it works to protect all those who wear it!
5.0,Fits perfect!!!  Love the material. Soft and stretchy.  Has a slit in the back that lets you walk without the dress being too tight. I bought a medium.  I am 5'2&#34; 129 pds 36C 30 inch waist and it fits perfect.  Just enough room that it isn't too tight but def not too small.  Will def buy this dress again.
5.0,First time I’ve seen one. Love it
5.0,"I have plantar fasciitis and previously moved around my house in bare feet. While I have been putting orthotics in my shoes for work and exercise, I never thought I needed arch support to simply do light chores, stand while preparing dinner, etc. until a friend suggested it. I bought these slippers and now I refuse to go barefoot. My feet feel so much better. These slippers offer support while still being very comfortable. My only caveat is the fleece inside the slippers makes them very warm, but I do not have a better suggestion for a lining. Overall, I would very much recommend."
5.0,Boyfriend loves it. This is his go-to watch. Very cheap and durable.
5.0,Looks as cute as apple pie. She loves it. Don’t hardly know what to do with the head wrap though
5.0,Had to look everywhere to find a slim belt for certain shorts/pants.  This one works great and is washable.
5.0,These bands came in nice colors and fit my Apple Watch perfectly.  They are as they are described.  Will be buying more colors to go with different outfits.  Good price for package of three.
5.0,Its perfect. Exactly what I expected from the website. I'm not skinny and it fits my arm well. It looks super expensive.
5.0,"Pretty dress, nice color, thicker material than expected made it feel expensive.<br /><br />In the end it didn’t quite fit me as needed but it’s worth a try if you’re looking for a nice, affordable, classy dress."
5.0,Like product. My granddaughter very happy to have.
5.0,FITS FINE
5.0,"Comfortable, just roomy enough."
5.0,"Nice shirt almost 100% cotton.  I'm 5'4&#34;,140 pounds and I ordered an XL (I wear M in normal sized clothes).  It's nice and long and not snug around the muffin top area so it's pretty perfect I think."
5.0,Comfortable and good face coverage. I wanted this color for “nude” skin tone and it’s perfect. Enough room to put the plastic cup underneath to give air circulation and so that you won’t mess up your lipstick/gloss. It’s very soft and comfortable behind the ears.
5.0,My boyfriend looks especially hot in this bee outfit. The stinger is my favorite part.
5.0,Extremely cute. They’re more for style than sun protection in my opinion but they do help. Either way I’d buy again
5.0,I love this sweatshirt. It is SUPER soft and fits exactly as I was hoping. I am going to order more of these.
5.0,Nice item priced at less than $20. Looks very classy in shoes.
5.0,The material feel great and the fit is accurate.im 5'6 210 lbs
5.0,Did not perform well at all would not buy it again
5.0,I’ve struggled with some face coverings being too thick and are hard for me to breath through. I’m asthmatic and the thicker masks are a challenge. This works well and I get sufficient airflow through the fabric.
5.0,My wife loved every little piece.
5.0,Love Vera and hate they have discontinued this style.  Great bag and perfect for overnight.
5.0,"I got these in blue for my mother. She can't stop raving about how comfortable they are! :^)<br /><br />They are soft microfiber on the outside, sheep shearling on the inside except the soles, which have a wonderful support system. Arch support too.<br /><br />The toes are square. She has diabetes and says these are great for her feet!"
5.0,So feminine and delicate! Works with almost every outfit!
5.0,"La encargué para una amiga, le quedó muy bien y dice que son cómodas"
5.0,"Great eyeglass case - best I have ever owned, and I have purchased many over the years - protective, easy to open,<br />stylish - would definitely purchase from this company again!"
5.0,"These sunglasses are great! They fit well, look nice and really work well."
5.0,"Love, love, love this hat!!  It fit perfectly and is so pretty!  Actually what it looks like online. I will order another hat soon,  probably for Easter!"
5.0,Wore this dress for my graduation. It fit wonderfully! It’s a bit see-through but nude underwear would definitely fix the problem. I happened to have white bathing suit bottoms with black polka dots so it looked like part of the dress. Worked perfectly and was so cute!!
5.0,My 9 year old wanted this I was surprised at the quality she had a great Halloween using this. I would buy it again the hair was nice and smooth and we opened the eyes a little more and she worked it.
5.0,Great quality and workmanship.. For personal use.
5.0,Much better quality than I had expected for the price. This dress is very well made and is made of a thick material that deals well. Not thin or chintzy at all. Very impressed!
5.0,"I am using it on my Leica Camera, and it is absolutely fantastic! The leather quality is simply firm and thick where it needs some time to break in. The metal ring is nice and sturdy, it fits nicely on to the lugs. The lugs are also protected by leather that is assembled with the rings.<br />I am very much satisfied with this product, and will highly recommend anyone with small to medium size camera."
5.0,"a little tight, but warmer than I expected - good price, and excellent"
5.0,"The packaging was nice, fit was good and would buy again."
5.0,My favorite ever rash guard.  Love the length of the shirt
5.0,"Excellent fabric and construction, as expected from Lands End.  Color is well-set and does not run at all, even though a fairly saturated deep shade of violet.  I'm 5'3"", 180lbs, very short-waisted with long arms.  The large is an acceptable fit for me.  The ""relaxed fit"" style is a little too big in the armhole seams and in  the sleeve length for me, and the torso is a little too wide.  I've laundered and dried on perm press, my usual settings, but I did not achieve the slight shrinkage I would've liked.  But this is still very wearable for casual days, will be in good shape for a long time, and at $9.97 sale price, a fantastic bargain for a Lands End garment!  5 Stars :)"
5.0,"Thick and wonderful. A little shorter than is ideal from my size 9 foot. They do pill a bit, but the plushness is worth it."
5.0,"I use these for reader inserts for my Native Sunglasses.  I don't need to purchase prescription sunglasses.  Added a set to a pair of cheap sunglasses I use for rafting, skiing, and hiking.  No issues reading maps or GPS and not worried about losing damaging them.  Haven't had any issue with them coming off."
5.0,"I was searching for a dress for MONTHS and am so happy I found this one. Really cute dress. Love the scallop detailing on the wrists and the bottom. Conservative, but still fun and cute to wear"
5.0,They hold a lot of bags and do the job.
5.0,My baby looked so beautiful. I had to size up because my baby girl is on the chunky side. But it’s worth the money and so cute. The quality is great as well. I washed it once but let it air dry and it looks the same.
5.0,Bought this for my teen nephew after a chest surgery. Easy to help put on. Requires limited movement of wearer and snaps are soft and comfortable f9r him to wear. Washes nicely.
5.0,Nice but I cannot figure out how to wear it...
5.0,Great watch. It has a good weight to it. Looks really nice. I was pleasantly surprised. I may buy another one.
5.0,I like alot it's really nice my fav is the fast shipment
5.0,"very soft and cute!! i wear them around the house all the dang time! super warm so it might be a hassle if you get sweaty paws in bed, but they’re perfect!"
5.0,Nice lite weight but yet covers.. love
5.0,"Great, well-made shirt! Can't wait for Halloween to wear!"
5.0,"Love this band, very comfortable and is true navy!"

5.0,Pick this up for my grandbaby she absolutely loves it she loves to play dress up
5.0,Awessome
5.0,Very nice quality! I was on the fence about ordering a larger size but seriously listen to the reviews. I went up one size which works but we definitely could have went up 2 sizes. The jacket seems to be a little smaller than the pants. My son is 5’9 and about 175 and wears a 30X32 in jeans and a medium in shirts.. we did the 38. Pants fit well.. jacket slightly snug.
5.0,"This vest is heaven sent! I got it for my husband so he can wear it while he rides his motorcycle when it’s freezing and he was completely blown away with the 100% difference it made!<br />So far he’s used it every day (4days A little over 12 hours total) On low and high heat probably four hours of high heat And with the battery pack we have 5V/2.1A he still has 25% of his battery left!<br />Best purchase we could have ever bought, already told multiple people about it who also purchased so don’t hesitate!<br />It does run true to size but like a lot of the reviews say it’s supposed to be snug on you to keep the heat in so wear under your hoodie or jacket and you won’t be disappointed!!"
5.0,Its really cute an made better then i figured it would be
5.0,I found this sweater way better quality than brick and department stores at a similar price. No wonder they are having problems staying open.
5.0,Love the affordable umbrella. Barbara
5.0,Just what l wanted....
5.0,This is a great quality and fits well.
5.0,The top was a bit small for my breasts. My bra would show a little from the bottom. Wish the top was little bigger. The bottom was perfect length.  The size was right on. It’s super comfy.
5.0,I get compliments on these often
5.0,"Fit as expected, slightly thinner then my last pair of Convertible cargo pants. Shipping was as always with Amazon Prime great."
5.0,Comfortable and would recommend.  Fast shipping
5.0,"Really cute! Very good quality, comes in a blue velvet pouch, good for a gift! The chain and inital are really shiny and sparkly! The chain is shorter, about 16 or 17 inches! Really impressed with the quality!"
5.0,My wrist kept getting irritated with orginal band the Samsung active watch came with. Found this one and it doesn't get irritated anymore.
5.0,"I bought these for my MIL costume for Halloween. 1st set arrived broken, the 2nd set was perfect and she loves them. Cute for a costume, very costume jewelry looking."
5.0,Cute and versatile with different outfits!

5.0,What a great design.  Wonder why it took so long to be invented.
5.0,Color and fit are perfect.  Soft fabric is nice and cool for summet sleeping
5.0,I LOVE these jeans they are so comfertable and very true to size.  I was worried because I am very picky about pants but these jeans are amazing!
5.0,"Love them!  Fit amazing!  Can't go wrong with cat eye sunglasses, very retro."
5.0,"Great case,just what I was looking for in a eyeglass case. The cloth that comes with it is also very handy and made very well."
5.0,Great comfortable shoes good gift item

5.0,BEST robe for the price
5.0,"My husband bought this for me, and ALL I can say is BUY IT."

5.0,"Item arrived as shown, on time.  Given as a gift, will keep you posted!"
5.0,Super cute. Bought for gifts and kept a couple for myself. Get product. Even better price.
5.0,"Purchased to wear around the house postpartum (C-section). Beautiful print, lightweight, and the v-neck is deep enough to easily nurse my baby."
5.0,"Ordered this for my mom for Mother’s Day. Dress arrived on time. Fabric is super soft and drapes nicely, is not see thru. Print is gorgeous. Fit was spot on. Only negative, though easily fixed, is very open neckline. Due to surgical scars and personal choice, she will only wear dress with a shell underneath. Very pleased with this dress for the price."
5.0,"great deal ,nice looking, nice fitting,nice price,I got a great pair of sun glasses.I just have to remember where i put them .."
5.0,My son loves the shirt. Very comfy and hasn't lost color after several washes.
5.0,Bought it for my husband's Halloween costume.  It arrived quickly and was perfect for what I needed it for.  Not cheap feeling so it can be used again and again.
5.0,"It looked great straight out of the package. After we hung it for a few days, the shape completely straightened out from being flattened during shipping.  This is a generous piece, as thick as we hoped. My only remark is, please measure the length by where the hair of the fur end not the attachment piece part. We forseen this due to other reviews and ordered longer. It fit perfect."
5.0,Myself for Christmas
5.0,I love these earrings!<br />They are  the perfect size. I have several piercings in each ear and they are very clean and simple looking!!! LOVE!
5.0,"I love this little dress. Even though it says it is a body con dress, it doesn't cling to the body like others do.  it lays nicely and I don't have to wear shape wear underneath.  I like it so much I bought another one in gray."
5.0,So cute! Great fit!
5.0,I love everything about this product 😍😍😍
5.0,"Good value for money -- quality fabric, durable and fits like expected."
5.0,I am a size 34c and this fit perfectly. This is such a comfy top. Going to get the matching panties
5.0,Very comfortable...but make a lot of noise in the house
5.0,"I was skeptical, I have alot of silver chains, rings, gold chains and havent been satisfied with the liquid products on the market for they can be very harsh. This polishing cloth is OUTSTANDING, Really glad I found it and bought. PERFECT"

5.0,BEST CHOICE FOR TRAVELING
5.0,Nanny loves her new aocks! So cute!
5.0,"Love this bag I’ve gotten so May compliments on it also the quality is really nice ,"
5.0,It’s perfect for a traveling teacher; from class to class. Didn’t realize or remember “teacher” would be printed on it (in gold) but it’s a welcomed accent.
5.0,"Just got these for Christmas and love them so far.  Very comfortable.  Very warm.  Easy to slide feet into, but fit snug and do not try to fall off going up and down stairs like many slip on slippers tend to do."
5.0,Very well made. Great price
5.0,Nice.  Just what I wanted.
5.0,"The plugs are perfect. I ordered them in a size two then zero, and I loved them both times. They are shorter than other plugs I've ordered, making that weird overhang obsolete."
5.0,Cute and lightweight. Perfect for spring days that are rainy and somewhat humid.
5.0,Loved it. Just what I needed for my cruise to Hawaii.
5.0,I paired it with a Vostok Metro watch that the band had let loose on.  Looks better than the original.

5.0,These are cute earrings to wear all year or just for Halloween. Cute little cats. Thick plastic or acrylic and light weight. I love them
5.0,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday, and he LOVES IT!<br />If you want a thick, heavy, and thirsty robe that is sure to keep you toasty warm- this is the one for you. I only wish I had ordered one for myself. You can see and feel the superior quality of this robe.<br />Do make sure that you follow the manufacturer's instructions and wash it before the first use because otherwise you will probably be covered with little black bits of terry all over! We found that out when he excitedly tried it on. I popped it into the washer with cold water, and it came out still looking great. I highly recommend this purchase."
5.0,I really like this bra. It fits comfortably and doesn’t dig in anywhere. The cups fit well and the straps adjust to where I needed them to be.
5.0,Love these pants great for intense strength training
5.0,I wear multiple earrings simultaneously. I just ordered another pair of earring backs because I have not lost an earring with the first set.
5.0,looks rich nice material.
5.0,"Beautiful dress, very well made. This would be very comfortable to wear for an event. The little jacket is an extremely light weight, sheer shrug."
5.0,"I love ur this watch.  The chain fastens on my belt loop, and the watch fits perfectly in my front pocket.  It is an attractive watch."
5.0,Cutest outfit ever!
5.0,"This was one of the best bargains I have come across in a while.  I might buy more.<br />This nightgown is one that can be worn long before bedtime. It is soft, flowy, pretty and almost looks like a dress. It is a bit larger than expected, but in a nightgown, that is a plus."
5.0,"Modest, flattering, well made, thick enough material, and the cross-over front works great for  breastfeeding."
5.0,"Nice, tough wallet."

5.0,Great scarf at a great price.
5.0,Bought this item. Got it discounted<br />Lemme tell you these studs are really strong quality.<br />They do not rust.  I practically left them in my ears for 2 weeks and they came off normally.<br />I 100% recommend them. Plus they make good gifts
5.0,"I am 5""3"", 125 pounds. It is a little long since I am short, but it will be easy to hem. I think this is going to be perfect for my sons wedding. Love the material. Looks like great quality. Like the slit in front. I think it will make it easier to walk, but does not look sleezy."
5.0,"Great buy, looks really nice. Better than  what I expected."
5.0,Me encanto demasiado Pedí talla s y peso 145lbs
5.0,Has lots of space for your cards and your money.
5.0,Love it!! Fit great!!
5.0,They are what they are.  Glad they are available on Amazon.
5.0,Warm and Comfortable. The size is good and it fits as I expected. I went ahead and ordered another one.
5.0,"It was 30° outside when I decided to wear this Bodycon sweater. Man o' man, it keeps you warm. I was sweating with it on in the house. I wore the sweater dress with a pair fleece leggings. Very nice and comfortable. It does hold static cling. After driving, you have to pull it back down. Maybe it won't do that if you were bare legged. Despite that, I love it."
5.0,"LOVE these leggings!!! They are comfortable, durable and fit perfect!<br />I will definitely be buying more colors."
5.0,I love the control it provides!
5.0,"I wish they had ladies sizes.  These are basically men's sized, but as long as you know that it is fine.  They re comfortable and give a nice variety to the solid black or white (or the goofy wild colors) you typically get in toe socks.  These are great."
5.0,"For the price, I was astounded by these earrings.  Good buy and they look lovely.  I especially like the rose gold set."
5.0,Very Nice Shirts. Just a little big.
5.0,Wife enjoys wearing this.  She got a medium and is about 170lbs 5’9” and it seems to fit as she wants it to.  Ok quality for what we paid.
5.0,Very pretty. Looks better in person. Love that you get them in both gold and silver
5.0,We like the glasses and will use at night to help from the lights. They go over your glasses good.

5.0,Really like this item & wear it from time to time.
5.0,Enabling developing countries indigenous citizens to earn an income to support their families. I love my bracelets! They are beautiful and easy to slip on and off my hands. I like the idea that I'm helping others by purchasing these items so they can support themselves.<br /><br />Five stars!!!!
5.0,My husband loves these socks and he is very picky about proper fitting socks!  They are well made and warm. He originally bought them to wear cutting wood and other outdoor chores but decided that they were too nice and dressy so now will wear them for work/leisure!
5.0,Awesome sturdy shoes. They are easy for my son to get on and off since they don't have laces that tie. Love that they are sturdy enough for a hike but get for everyday as well.
5.0,My niece really like this
5.0,"This is a great case and wallet. The removable phone is a plus for when I just need the phone and nothing else. My only complaint is that when you insert your credit cards, etc, it becomes difficult to snap close. If there were just a little more space to allow for the space cards takes up, it would be ideal. Still happy though."
5.0,"This is so cute, I want it in all colors now. It fits so nicely and hangs on my body perfectly."
5.0,"People do not have a clue that this is not a pricey designer watch that it looks like. Everyone who sees it, asks me to look at it.  It is perfect for every day and the polka dots add that extra something that gives it a wow factor.  Very affordable and definitely luxury looking.  Love it."
5.0,"I bought these for my five-year-old granddaughter, the one that's always losing and breaking things just by looking at them! Slap bracelets are indestructible and she can wear a different one for each outfit. We love them!  I don't remember exactly how many days it took from ordering until delivery, but they came before I even thought to check order status."
5.0,"I gave this as a gift and she absolutely loved it! My friend is a Slytherin, so this was perfect for her!"
5.0,"Hands down, my favorite pair ever. Ordering more now. Soft, flattering, stretchy, and flattering."
5.0,Cute outfit for our daughter

5.0,For the price of this shirt it fits amazingly and is great quality. It definitely has a unique look about it and gets attention.
5.0,Es linda no cabía de color
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:23207f98a1d69df6b90a231baf5936c2]] Very comfortable. Work great and easy to put on. With the other bands I have had, my wrist broke out. No such problem with these. They are durable and pretty. I'm really very impressed. They are even reasonably priced."
5.0,Yes ! Love it ! Ordered an XL to be on the safe side and glad I did. I'm a 36DD and it's slightly snug but not tight . Might order another
5.0,It's so Beautiful I am truly happy with my purchase.
5.0,Para trabajar.
5.0,Perfect little travel bag.  I fit all of my daily cosmetics and have room to spare.
5.0,These are too cute!!!!!!
5.0,"I think I finally found a glasses strap that will be REAL easy to use/wear . I've tried a bunch of different things ,trying to keep my glasses in place .Most just are too much trouble to use  on a regular basis . I liked my old elastic strap , the same type as this is , but they kept coming off and I eventually lost it . The one-piece rubber stretch type are too short or something ; way too tight and hard to put on .They do work , not for me. Now these are really something . Really well made  . and so cheap ,. My last one I think I paid 7 bucks or so for it . With these ,;5 for the same price . I got 3 packs [ of 5 ] , they were so cheap.! I didn't expect such well made  product . And the buckle ; man, talk about easy to use . . That and the comfort , the quality , too  much . Fantastic product , or device , whatever you call it . Glad , real glad I ordered them . Great thing ;  thanks"
5.0,I got this shirt for my husband along with a Blu-ray set of the movies. He loved it! It fits him well and thus far has held up to regular washing and drying.
5.0,I bought 1 set to try them. Worked well. I stand 12 hours a day for work. These are comfortable and not too tight so easy to wear and had no ankle swelling when I wore them. Thank you. I bought a second pair because they worked well for me.
5.0,Perfect for my sons 6th birthday and he still plays with them weeks later. Everyone loved them.
5.0,I ordered a XXL just to be sure it wouldn't be too tight. It fits great!! Probably could've ordered a xl. I will be ordering another one!
5.0,"I live in Florida and originally bought these for when I visit family overseas. Thanks to everything happening in the world right now my Christmas trip has been indefinitely postponed. Temps dropped in to the 60’s this weekend so what better time to try these on (save your judgement).. aaaand I’ve had these on all day long and refuse to take them off. They feel like I live a much better life than I actually do. I feel like I should be hand-fed fine foods and waited on. Pure luxury. Softest socks I’ve ever owned. And I will wear these even in Florida. But these. Don’t hesitate, just do it and thank me later."
5.0,Loved the style! Super cute and sexy one shoulder!
5.0,Im 5'7 170 pounds and fits great I ordered the large size and it even held up after a wash didn't shrink. I like that the tee is just long enough to go past the hips cute with shorts or some pants I defiantly wouldn't wear alone. I normally don't care for this type of fabric but its not snug i really like it. Wish they had some more styles other than all the black and white ones or id order more.
5.0,This bag is pretty amazing! I love it and it seems very durable.
5.0,"A perfect top for work pants or jeans, with blazer or sweatshirt.....wear it anywhere."
5.0,"Great jack, fits well and stands out. Looks perfect with a some dark jeans."
5.0,Most hats are one size fits all... if you ever found it difficult getting a hat that fits. Look no further. It's fits comfortably; the fleece lining makes it warmer; its stylish and at a great price!
5.0,Fits my 3 yr old with her pull ups. I got her a size 6 lol she has been wanting this kind since her cousin has been using them
5.0,I love these pants- want another 1/2 doz. they fit great. a tad small but Great!  they wrinkle horribly but after steaming they are back to sleek !  It didn't take too long to arrive.  If you like pockets -You'll love them too !
5.0,"love it love it. will recommended for the price. very quick , fast and professional on the shipping thank you"
5.0,This is my second purchase of this brand of head bands.  I love them!  I am a gardener and I sweat profusely at the front and back of my head and these are perfect for my issue.  I like the color pack cause I can coordinate them to my tee shirts!
5.0,They keep my glasses safe!
5.0,"These are the best reusable masks I have had so far!<br />They are comfortable, they are adjustable. They fit well.  They wash well. I feel protected when I wear them. They are priced right for their quality."
5.0,"Fabric has a nice weight (not too thin). I'm of the bigger-bosomed variety so a lot of shirts make me look preggers, but this one cuts in nicely at the waist without being too snug. Love the neckline and sleeve length; very flattering, and perfect for showing off a pretty necklace or bracelets!"
5.0,Camo Green was a smaller and tighter than the  casmo blue.  Husbam said Camo Blue fit much better and was comfortable to wear.  Delivery was very prompt.
5.0,They’re a good face mask lanyard looks classy and super stylish
5.0,"This is so me. It is comfortable, and  hooks good. I cut the sleves up to look shreded. Cute..."
5.0,"These are soft, comfie, have pockets and smoothes out muffin top. Well worth the money."
5.0,Wife loves this necklace. Hasn’t taken it off since we received it and it’s still shiny & looks brand new. Design is beautiful!
5.0,Who says girls can't like dinosaurs?  This is a fun teaching method. I appreciate that each is identified on the shirt & the color combinations are very good.
5.0,This dress went beyond my expectation. The material is lovely and it flows.  You can dress this up with heels and a necklace or dress it down with flats. I'm thoroughly happy with my purchase!
5.0,Used these for my son's nerf party. It was a hardcore battle thanks to the adult males but these held up great
5.0,Fits perfect to size. Looks super cute on my 9 year old granddaughter.
5.0,As prictured

5.0,Hubby loves it!! Thank you!!!
5.0,"Awesome fit, quality, comfort, style, value. They couldn't be any better, unless they did the dishes while you slept."
5.0,Excellent price😀🎸 Quality hat! What a steal
5.0,Perfect fitted hoodie. Comfortable and affordable
5.0,"These are very comfortable, cute and funny. Purchased for womens size 7-8 feet. Don't know yet how they will hold up to future washings."

5.0,Very cute and love the variety!
5.0,Look these sunglasses
5.0,My wife loves all things Turtle...I first saw this pendant in a Hawai'i Magazine email ad. ( I think) She saw it too. She liked it.  I found it on Amazon. I was able to have it delivered in 2 days. She loved it. The Pendant lived up to what she thought it was.  A nice little gift that did not set me back to much.  Real Gold and Silver. Sterling silver that is...
5.0,It was early delivery during the holiday season and it is perfect. Match the description perfectly!
5.0,My daughter loves them she says they are comfortable. Only thing is even after washing them they left the pink stuff all on the carpets.
5.0,Love them!  And they come with the neck strap.
5.0,"The jewelry came even faster then it said it would. All of the pieces look just like the pictures. Very pretty and looks like very good quality metal. I'll update later if I encounter any issues, but so far I'm very pleased."
5.0,The necklace is beautiful!  The pic doesn't do it justice. The movement and shine are gorgeous
5.0,This top is super soft and stretchy.  The fit is perfect and is very flattering.  I will definitely be ordering more.
5.0,Nice watch! Works great
5.0,Fits perfectly and looks great!!
5.0,The perfect fit. These are top top of the line cleats for a great price!!
5.0,"These are amazing. I wore the silver one with a black dress and it was a hit! Everyone loved it. This is not retraining at all and I am not on the skinniest side, therefore I had to stretch it a bit. These look so elegant."
5.0,"Pay attention to sizing chart! I usually wear a size 8(M), but the size 8-10 is an XL. The XL fit perfectly. I'm a 5'1&#34; mother of three with a pudgy belly. I have some curves and this suit hugged/flattered them without being too tight and covered my belly well.<br />This is a super cute suit. I like that the material isn't heavy. Things to note. The bottoms are attached and look like boy shorts.  You can't just pull the bottoms down like a 2-piece if you need the bathroom. I'm sure the top will &#34;float&#34; if a wave hits, but you will still be covered.<br />I only wish it came in more colors, like red, since I also bought the 2piece one (which is equally as cute)."
5.0,I like it loads it feels and looks like the read deal.
5.0,looks great doesn’t look cheap
5.0,"wow! this dress is beyond my expectations. it fits like a glove and i love how i feel in it. I received  many compliments and my hubby loved the look. It is a sexy and classy dress. i’m going to order the rose dress. I am 5ft 136lb anr I ordered a size 6, perfect fit with a little wiggle room, love it."
5.0,"It took me forever to decide on the color of Sweaty Band that I wanted, and I'm super happy with this one! It's absolutely gorgeous, and best of all there are so many colors on it that it should go with most solid workout clothes - from gray to blue and purple all the way to neon yellow or orange.<br />I have very fine hair that I wear in a tight ponytail when I exercise, so I've found that on me this hairband slips a tiny bit, but that should not be an issue for anyone with hair that isn't baby fine."
5.0,super cute tankini! my daughter loved it!
5.0,"This is the first bow tie I've ever bought. Not sure if it is the tie, or if people are just stunned to see me wearing one, but I have been getting a lot of compliments over it. It is well made and looks great."
5.0,"Very nice, looks better in person. Im happy with this buy thanx."
5.0,Beautiful. Many compliments
5.0,Wonderfully comfortable and soft workout T shirt!
5.0,"I haven't worn them yet. But, I can't wait to do so on my birthday. Simply gorgeous. Colors are vivid."
5.0,This outfit is really cute! And fits as expected. Looks great on my red-headed granddaughter.
5.0,I love these zodiac key chain bezels.
5.0,I love this product! Feels and looks great
5.0,Love it! Well made and holds everything I need in style
5.0,My daughter and I have matching pairs and she loves hers just as much as I love mine.ot was worth every penny. Plan on buying more for her and myself.
5.0,"Had a pair for 10 years, really durable and comfortable; bit expensive though."
5.0,Amazing dress perfect for my conference!
5.0,Beautiful!  Exactly what I hoped It’d be!
5.0,Good quality came fast
5.0,"I am an EXO fan, so I love everything EXO & Chan Yeol!!"
5.0,It looks so good in your ear but the cross huts your ear so it isn’t very comfortable wearing it
5.0,"One of my favorites! 5'1, 125lbs, 36DD, and it fit perfectly with a Large. So they may run a bit small - i just followed the sizing chart and I always order up a size to accommodate the chest."
5.0,I like this it’s really good for protection
5.0,"Super soft distressed leather. I bought a pair for me and for my daughter and she had them on with rolled up jeans , super cute! I love Frye boots for the quality, and they are going to last. I got these for $110 and that is a deal!!!"
5.0,I've ordered four hats from this seller and all were perfect with crisp clear graphics. Shipping was faster than expected. I'll be ordering hat number five shortly. Highly recommend this seller.
5.0,"This product was just what I wanted but, by the time it got to me , I didn't need it any more.  Looked very well made, quality looked good, good fit."
5.0,I love this shirt! Nice fit in the shoulders and chest and loose around the waist. Great quality. Thin but not to thin!
5.0,Light was bright and worked fine
5.0,"This dress is flattering and size small fits perfectly (5'5&#34;, 136#)"
5.0,"I am 5 feet 130lbs and a small was perfect. The length was great for my height, the elastic part of the joggers hits right at my ankle. The waist sits at a good spot which makes it flattering. I wasn’t expecting it to fit this well, I’m very pleased with this jumpsuit."
5.0,"I get so many compliments on this top and questions about where I got it. I’ve worn it to golf for Memorial Day, flag dedication day, and 4th of July. I normally wear M and that’s what I ordered."
5.0,"Cozy, yet not bulky fit.  Absolutely love the feel of this sweatshirt!  Sliming design! Pockets are a plus!"
5.0,"Great helmet ,"
5.0,"My daughter is VERY picky about how clothes feel. No diagnosed sensory problem, but it’s a possibility. I constantly buy things she says she’ll wear when trying on in the store, but she changes her mind after I’ve washed them!!! Same has been true with training bras. This is the ONLY kind she will wear. They have no itchy tags or seams and are very soft, seamless fabric.  They’re also very breathable and quick drying. She doesn’t need a training bra yet, but is old enough that both of us are more comfortable that she has something to cover her chest when wearing certain tank tops, dresses, rompers, etc. These are perfect. In fact, I think I’ll order another 2 right now!!!"
5.0,Everyone ask where did you get that it's so nice.
5.0,Worked perfect for the sons wedfing
5.0,"Nice quality, style and fit. Glad I purchased."
5.0,Really beautiful. Will make a nice gift.
5.0,"I love theses sick. I go camping every year, and I wanted long socks. Perfect for camp"
5.0,I am a mother and bought this dress for my 14 yr. old daughter and she looked fabulous in it. The medium fit her perfectly. My daughter is an athletic build about 145lbs and 5'3 with a large C small D chest. I hope this helps someone to find their size. She usually wears a medium so this dress was true to size.  We also purchased the petticoat to go under it and it just made it that much better.
5.0,Anyone that likes Disney will love this
5.0,Christmas pjs for my grandson
5.0,It's a very pretty shoe has a nice style model for the likes of any person and its combination of colors very nice.
5.0,This product was exactly what I needed to clean up some tarnished gold ox plated costume jewelry. I didn't take pictures but it brought new life to some cheap pieces I wasn't ready to throw out. Recommend this cloth for sure.
5.0,"Since the pandemic, I've started wearing bouffant caps at work and when they got in short supply, I ordered this. At the time I ordered this, I had butt length braids and this cap was large enough to wrap them up and hold them in without being tight or uncomfortable. I was seriously impressed because I don't have a small head either. So of course its going to work if someone has a lot of hair or thick hair. At the time of this review, I'm back to my very thick hair and of course its still as stylish. I plan to order more just in case."
5.0,"I purchased this tank top for 5 dollars and it is one of my favorite items in my closet. It works well with a cardigan, tights, or just on its own. I love it."
5.0,"Very nice packaging and card, pretty necklace."
5.0,"This hat worked out perfectly for my costume! It’s a lightweight knitted material that’s pretty comfortable to wear for long periods of time. This is advertised as a witch hat but I used it for my scarecrow costume. I tied some twine around the top and it is just what I was looking for! It fits well and isn’t oversized like most costume hats. I’m very happy with it, it’s great quality for the price."
5.0,Very nice key ring.The leather looks to be good quality. I'm happy with my purchase.
5.0,Estos zapatos fuero  un regalo para mi madre y dice que son bonitos en diseño y cómodos
5.0,1x and 2x are very close. I have them both. Love the fabric. The only thing I don't like is the edges of the shorts don't have a hem so they fray after 1-2 washes.
5.0,"I received this several weeks early and I love it. I only got it to wear with my wedding dress, so it’ll just be a one time wear for me, then I’ll probably end up giving to one of my daughters or I’ll stow it away in my hopechest as a keepsake from that special day!"
5.0,Bought the  orange & black in medium however wanted a looser fit went with large ... I love the style made well and ordered the other 2 colors .. I am a very satisfied with products 😁
5.0,"They’re comfy, stretchy, FIT me, and that’s awesome, bc most of my weight is in my belly. I look like I have an ass, too, which is a nice unexpected bonus. Goes great with my post-apocalypse Halloween costume or just a regular day. Very pleased with the fit and comfort."
5.0,Was very happy with quality and appearance!
5.0,The sale and look
5.0,The best sweatshirt dress!! I tried to find so many and this is the best!!! I plan on buying more 😍😍
5.0,Purchased for my teenage nephew. Loves not having to take his gloves off to use his phone.
5.0,This is the third pair of the same glasses that I have bought-  The first ones broke several years ago but nowI have an extra pair.  I love these glasses!
5.0,"Love, love, love!!  I purchased these for a steampunk theamed party.  They look so great and are so comfortable that I will be wearing them often when I want to give my outfit an extra kick.  I highly recommend these!"
5.0,Great price for this charming set.
5.0,Great quality on this shirt
5.0,The only thing that could make this dress better is if it had pockets. The dress is super cute and flattering on and the fabric while thick enough to not be see through is still able to be worn comfortably when it’s hot.
5.0,"I loooove this dress. So elegant, fits wonderfully. Definitely get it"
5.0,"So, I've always been skeptical about buying super cheap watches, with this one you can never go wrong. It's obviously not great quality, it will eventually wear off since putting the strap on is not so easy, but for the price, this is a great watch. Looks great with any smart or business casual, plus has great aesthetic. I don't have any complaints at all."
5.0,I really like these. They fit perfect! They are nice for light everyday compression. Varicose veins run in my family so I’m hoping they help prevent them. I don’t do too many strenuous things. Walking is about it. If you have medical issues or exercise heavily I’d go for a higher compression for sure. They are easy to hand wash. I’d like to see some darker colors.
5.0,"I really like this Swimsuit a lot because it has the uplift in it plus the underwire bra also and I need that, great looking on also."
5.0,I absolutely love this purse. It is just the right size. It's not to small or too big. The color is gorgeous. I like to carry small at times but am a diabetic and need my insulin pens. A wallet is not big enough and a purse can be too big. This is perfect in that it fits everything I need and organized my credit cards in the front. I'm very happy with my purchase. I wish it came in black because I'd order another one.
5.0,My everyday earring....especially for the work place. Nice and discreet.
5.0,Keeps my glasses exactly where I need them.  Soft and comfortable around my neck.  Hope they last a long time!!
5.0,Like the durability! And my grand daughter loves the ‘ruffle’ sleeves as she calls them! Lol!!
5.0,"I'm a 34F which means sports bras usually never fit me. Even ones that come in sizes normally don't come in my size, but finally I've found one. Now I'm stocking up because I'm in love and so happy to finally be able to wear sports bras. They also definitely fit true to size."
5.0,Great gift for myself and my bridesmaids
5.0,"Looks great and washes well. I'm 5'7"", 130lbs and a size SMALL was perfect."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:f98f58df47ada272ba7237e9b905e46]] The PJ Paul Jones Short Sleeve Plaid is the very best checkerboard polo. The video is intended to show the perfect fit, classic styling and impeccable workmanship. As you can see, PJ Paul Jones is unsurpassed for vintage 1960s apparel that’s made with authenticity, good taste and highest quality. I like that.<br /><br />I highly recommend PJ Paul Jones’ excellent Short Sleeve Plaid polo to everyone."
5.0,These are by far the best nursing bras! I struggle bad with blocked ducts and Mastitis! These are supportive but not restrictive causing blocks. They are super soft as well. Well worth the price. They also help provide good shape under clothes. I wear a 34C/D normal bra. I ordered a medium and it’s tight but fits the way I would like. The small was way too small.
5.0,Love it!  Good quality.  Roomy.  Zippers strong.  Stitching strong.
5.0,So for around 6 dollars these glasses were a steal but I'm in love they're so cute and I get tons of compliments I usually spend way too much on sunglasses and I haven't touched my chanel or Dior since getting these.
5.0,Great product. Wish it wasn’t sewer closed and had a hook
5.0,These are great! I have purchased them twice! They hold up really well and are the perfect length! Makes mask making super easy.
5.0,Primarily for the  hot tub
5.0,[[VIDEOID:447dd0f9d0e6665972a772751ecdee65]] I absolutely love this product.. I don’t like when the water enters my ear while swimming and the plugs works fabulous!!!’ It also comes with nose plug and an extra pair of ear plugs !!!! Definitely worth buying it :) ♥️
5.0,I bought this for my friend for her 28th birthday and the only thing she doesn't like about it is her mother keeps trying to take it from her
5.0,Perfect buy!! Hubby loved it!!
5.0,"My 13 year old bought these with his own money, I couldn't bring myself to spend my money on something so hideous. He loves them and they fit well. He is 5'10&#34; with a 28-29 waist and a small fit perfect. He even added some purple sharpie to his white adidas to match, now he is ready for the next episode of Barney."
5.0,It was a great value.
5.0,I have a few sets of boot heaters but none of them with a timer. I tried them a few times and they work great and you can't beat the price.
5.0,Love the bracelet. Not too much. Not too little
5.0,Bought these for my still stylish 86 year old mom and she loves them. Great comfort and not slippery bottoms!
5.0,Not as heavy duty as LL Bean but sturdy enough and a great value.
5.0,Bought these for my mother...She LOVES them!
5.0,These were a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and she loves them
5.0,"My rings fit perfectly, and my fingers are a size 8. I got these rings a week later, so I got them WAY earlier than I was suppose to. Highly recommended."
5.0,"my daughter loves it, very beautiful."
5.0,Has alot of space for everything
5.0,"These are my hinges to the door of my bunny cage. I have a Flemish giant so it's a huge cage. The edges of the grids are 1/8"" thick. It went over that twice (to connect cage to door) per space. They didn't stay snug, but they only opened (bent out of shape) 1 to 2 mm. If they can stand up to what I used them for, there's no craft too rough for them. Definitely recommend, whether you're making  keychains or bunny cages. Tough & such a pretty matte black."
5.0,Very soft on inside. Stitching shows through after a while though.
5.0,"This garment is beautiful, and surprisingly high-quality for the price. The color is as vibrant as the picture. I cannot believe how affordable it is. I wish I could buy it in more colors. This is one of the best deals on Amazon."
5.0,"It is a nice flattering shirt. The material is nice and soft, the print is well made. Definitely worth it."
5.0,"Got this for my wife and she just loved them. The coral color is just what she likes, and the quality is very good."
5.0,This was a gift for a saggitarian friend. It came fast and well packaged. And is prettier than you think.
5.0,True to colour and very well made.
5.0,They work great and I expect them to last a long time.
5.0,Bought for my grandson...he lives them..good quality material
5.0,I love that this mask represents my flag. I also love the filter slot i tested this mask It is great I bought filters great value for lifelong mask
5.0,"This is my third watch band on my 3HR. My last one was a cheap MoKo band which was OK, but I like the ANCOOL better. It has a nice smooth feel, almost a satin feel."
5.0,It's super warm
5.0,"Love the shirt. I like my t-shirts loose, so size up if you do too. If not go with your usual size"
5.0,Super comftable and classy
5.0,I like that your info is covered.
5.0,Loved it but just doesn’t look right on me! I refuse to give a bad review..<br />Great quality and case is perfect
5.0,Comfy and super cute
5.0,I love this top.  Very comfortable and the fabric is soft.  The color was as expect/as shown.  I will be purchasing more colors.
5.0,I purchased the Tiger Love Wish Pearl for my sister and she loves it! It was packaged nicely too!
5.0,Gave it as a gift to a friends son. He seems to love them. Is rough an them as a 12 year old boy and they seem to be holding up well. They look to be good quality
5.0,Demasiado bonito el relog y de buena calidad
5.0,"Dress is very nice and fit perfect on hour glass figure ,material is stretchy and not transparent i love this dress,i have it in all colors.It is a gem ....."
5.0,My daughter likes this one. It’s very soft and warm.
5.0,I like this band more than the original.  Comes with everything you need.  Easy
5.0,"I'm actually using the bag part to hold a small case of pills and my hearing aid batteries.  Works great, plenty of room."
5.0,"I bought several nylon backpacks on Amazon prior to my trip last month, to determine which size or brand that I would like. A few will be returned.<br /><br />The 33L HEXIN is quite comfortable to wear. I like carrying it as an extra shopping bag inside the 22L New Outlander that I also bought. I am 5'4&#34; and a bit short-waisted, so standard backpacks are all too long on me. The 22L is shorter and a better length for me, but I used the 33L HEXIN many times on my two-week trip to Europe last month as my daypack.<br /><br />The side pockets easily held my 12oz or 16oz stainless steel water bottle, or my sunglasses, although the pockets are quite wide on the 33L and the 12oz tended to fall on its side inside the pocket. It seems quite well-made with perfectly functioning zippers and no fraying on seams. It carried all of my usual &#34;purse&#34; items as well as an extra shirt, socks, snacks, pill organizer, with room to add a few souvenirs. Even though I weighed it down pretty well the straps were still comfortable on my shoulders.<br /><br />The other brands of similar backpacks were not as comfortable on me, and one had annoyingly loud material (I think that was the MCIRCO 20L). The Outlander (22L purple) and Hexin (33L purple) seemed to both be made by the same company since they fit similarly and had the same style and print on the fabric. So, I am keeping them both! The 33L HEXIN served as my flight carry-on, and the smaller (22L) New Outlander as my purse. Both sizes fold back neatly into a little pouch, but frankly, I can't see me ever putting them away. They are so lightweight that they take up practically no space. As few times on our trip I did fold the 33L pack into its pouch and carried it inside the 22L pack (so that I would have an extra shopping bag with me), but after a few times I just rolled it and placed it at the bottom of the pack in use.<br /><br />I also bought an Outlander (33L) in Black for my husband to carry, but he didn't mind the dark purple color. He may have objected if I had wanted him to carry a pink or red one, but the purple is pretty subtle. Both of the larger 33L packs came in handy for sorting our clothes during the trip. One day we even loaded both 33L backpacks with stuff we should not have brought with us (can you say &#34;overpacked&#34;?) and walked to the Amsterdam Post Office to mail home a box of our &#34;stuff&#34; (yeah, we'll just call it stuff, to be nice here). These packs are SO SO handy. I got the impression, at the PO, that mailing home dirty clothes was not uncommon. Doh.<br /><br />Yes this nylon pack is a bit flimsy, but it's so strong and holds so much! For the price, I totally recommend either the HEXIN or the New Outlander for price and durability. Buy one in each size. Keep both, or give one away to a friend! Can't go wrong with this product.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was not given anything free to try. I paid for this product. I like this product and recommend it. (No one ever sends me anything for free. Boo hoo)"
5.0,Very comfortable and worth the money.
5.0,For a once in a while kind of ring it's perfect! I'm sure with time it will turn black but for what I paid! No big deal!!

5.0,"A very small, dainty little infinity hoop. The mechanism is easy to open and close, but seems a little frail because of the size."
5.0,This is a great swimsuit for heavier woman. Bought this one to replace the one just like it I bought last year.  I have to get a size smaller this year as I lost weight.
5.0,This bag is a great size and good weight. Love the design. I may order another.
5.0,"Love the colors.  These Blue Spruce mismatched socks are fun to wear.  Looking at my feet, while wearing them, puts a smile on my face.  I have had no problems with washing them.  I used warm water, regular cycle then hung them to dry.  They look just like new."
5.0,I love these little boots. I wear them around the house and they keep my feet nice and toasty. They are easy on and off.<br />I use them to walk around the garage too and they are great. They seem to be holding up very nicely too. I have had them<br />awhile and they are still warm and fuzzy and great to keep my toes warm for the winter.

5.0,Very comfortable with just the right amount of compression. Nice deep side pockets which hold phone and keys securely. Size medium fit me perfectly. Highly recommend!
5.0,"I can not say enough about the quality of this product, I was so impressed when I took it out of the package. This dress does run a little smaller in size. I also had to return one of the dresses, as I ordered 3, couldn't believe how easy that was. If I ever need another dress for a special occasion I will definitely be looking on AndyBridal first. The only draw back is the amount of time to receive the product, but the quality is worth the wait."
5.0,Nice and beautifull with a good material.
5.0,Comes with tons of stuff! And the quality is as expected for party supplies.
5.0,I’ve had the band for several months. Looks good and the wear and tear is good. Working in non traditional office environment does a lot of damage on watches BUT… this band is still holding up. Also matches my iwatch color exactly.
5.0,"When I first bought these I literally lived in them. They are so comfortable, soft and warm. Still loving them 3 years later"
5.0,Thank you. My daughter loved the colors and couldn't wait to take her eyeglasses to school and show off her colorful eyeglasses nylon bands.
5.0,I loved everything about the cap including the packaging. The moment i saw the packaging i could tell they great pride in their products and cared . From the personalized message with the real small flower attached to the product itself it was great. I would def recommend!
5.0,"I love this purse, it is so comfortable,pretty and shiny. And I can put all the things I need to put in there."
5.0,"They are so much sturdier than I expected!! I'm hoping they'll last longer than my last pair that were similar but I bought those at Party City!  Most people haven't even noticed that they're different, but they feel like a better quality plastic, more durable! I get so many compliments! They're a fun addition to anyone's look!"
5.0,"This is an amazing jersey that is exactly like the one Clark W Griswold wore in Christmas Vacation!  If you have someone that loves that movie, this makes a perfect gift."

5.0,My granddaughter loves this bag&#34;
5.0,Bought my daughter this shirt for a Pokémon themed party fit perfect!
5.0,"My son has SPD and possibly autism and these have helped wonders. They don’t completely block out the noise. But they do it enough that we are able to go to church, stores and doctors appointments without him melting down, freaking out or crying because it too loud. They’ve been such a blessing for my son and me."
5.0,Funeral
5.0,Good quality Fit perfectly  !

5.0,"This item projects a cartoon symbol. This is a great item the symbol projected is multiple colors & very clear. I'm an adult, & this is cool."
5.0,"I like this product, no dislike"
5.0,I'm very pleased with these sleeves. There were so many other sleeves out there that looked great but had semi-bad reviews. They feel like socks. When I took them out the package they literally looked as if it would only fit my forearm but nope...they actually stretch pretty friggin well--&#62; up to my arm pit. I really like them and I just hope that when I wash them they won't mess up or something.  GET THESE.  Oh by the way...I'm 5'7 feet tall and pretty skinny. These sleeves also come in clutch for skinny people. Big people don't need to worry either as they stretch better than socks. They stay in place.
5.0,The brushed metal looks really good and it has a nice weighted feel to it. Fits Seiko Solar Chronograph perfectly.
5.0,"Very pretty...just as pictured. Nice lightweight material...not too silky so it won't slip around. Like the navy background, dots are perfect tan color."
5.0,Comfortable and great price!
5.0,So pretty for the money!!!  AND don't have to take and get it sized!  Many compliments!!!
5.0,Perfect boho!  Great value for money!
5.0,The best belt I had ever!
5.0,Love this. So warm!
5.0,"My job requires me to walk about 3 miles a day and climb up and down stairs carrying tools and equipment. it was incredibly irritating having to stop often to &#34;adjust&#34; my underwear every time it would ride up. I've tried different brands from your typical inexpensive Walmart brands to the more expensive designer underwear that chiseled models advertise on tv and always had the same results I'd get up a flight of stairs and adjust. Not fun when you're carrying tools and equipment. These are not your typical boxer briefs they are a blend of cotton and elastic I think. They looked like spandex when they first arrived so I was a bit squeptical at first but after wearing them for a few weeks I am a believer. They are super soft and surprisingly comfortable, they offer great support for my boys and most importantly they DO NOT ride up! Send these people your money if you're looking for good underwear."
5.0,"Great value...dress fits well, the material is very good for the price. Buy it"
5.0,long and warm for cold nights

5.0,"I love them, you can use them daily ;)"
5.0,Huge hit for christmas
5.0,"So stinkin cuuute. I’m 5’2” 110 lb and I got the XS. Fits perfectly. The cutout allows the skin to show, but at the same time, because the straps are thick, it doesn’t draw too much attention. It’s sexy and cute at the same time. The backside is a thong cut, so that certainly is helpful when wearing a pair of skin tight leggings on a night out."
5.0,Looks exactly like it is supposed to. Fits my head perfectly. I’m so happy I bought this!!! Well done!
5.0,fit my thin 10 year old just fine!
5.0,I got this to replace a Shemagh that I wear when hiking or for colder weather.  It has the same general look when wearing it.. but this item is very soft and all you have to do is slip it over your head and go.  If you're going for the Shemagh look but want something a little softer and more user friendly.. than you need to check this out!
5.0,"Definitely a unique hat, wore it for my trip to Disney World and a few people complimented and asked where I got it from."
5.0,"It was a gift for my sister as she received the eyeglass case, change purse and pill box from my children for Xmas as they buy everything from Amazon anyway she loves, loves it !!! She used to have a Scotty dog that why we purchased it! Thank you for always carrying merchandise for people who are hard to shop for LOL"

5.0,It is a pretty dress. It fits so welll. Good material. Well done. I love it!
5.0,These needles are strong enough for stitching yarn projects. The needle eye is. Big enough to thread with varius sizes of yarn or string.
5.0,"Fits awesome, no leg creep."
5.0,"Feels a TINY bit snug in the sleeves, but looks great on! I will probably be buying this dress in other colors.  The fabric is stretchy enough to be comfortable and heavy enough that I'm not going to be very worried when the wind blows.  Great dress for a great price!"
5.0,"These are the perfect work pants or if needed, for play. They are the perfect length for me with 3inch heels. Love the material and fit. I’m normally a 10, but bought a 12 (because they’re more of a trouser) and it’s great. The pants sit perfectly on my hips and have just enough stretch!!  Buy these pants!"
5.0,"Very nice, pretty"
5.0,very light and perfect for hot climate

5.0,"Bought this purse as a gift. It looks just like on the pictures and comes with a nice dust cover to keep the bag clean and in good condition when not in use. Fits a small laptop or tablet, as well as plenty of other things. Looks great as a laptop bag and adds a professional look."
5.0,"I have a similar nightgown from a different brand, and this one fits almost the same. I am 5’6” and about 140 pounds. I typically wear a US size 6-8, but decided to order this in a size Large, which the listing calls a size US 4. I know that I would not fit into a size 4, but my other brand of nightgown is a large so I went for it. I’m so glad I did because it fits perfectly.<br /><br />This chemise is beautiful! At under $7.00 with free shipping, I am going to order more. The satin underlay fabric is smooth and shiny, and the chiffon overlay is very well matched and soft as well. I ordered the color “Rose Red,” and it is exactly what I expected based on the pictures in the product listing. The seams and hem are straight and secure. I really like the longer length on this because it’s sexy yet still covers my rear end. The chiffon part helps to camouflage my tummy bulge and the sheer lace band under the breast adds allure. This is definitely one of my favorites.<br /><br />This was a full price, personal purchase."
5.0,"Update, August 27, 2016<br /><br />I still have these and they are still like new. I just busted a cheap plastic pair and decided to buy another pair of the grey, as I did not know they had the amber color. I will be purchasing one of each, as these have done me well. I keep my expensive Maui Jims in my vehicles and they do not leave them. These are for around the house, including working. I don't care if they break or get scratched, yet they are good enough quality to enjoy without worry. I will update again if I have issue with the new ones.<br /><br />June 20, 2015<br /><br />I have a pair of Maui Jim Ka'anapalis out for bridge repair and needed something inexpensive and polarized to hold me over. I have a large head and most glasses don't sit well on me. I have usually had to stick to large aviator glasses. My wife has a large pair of Maui Jims, but the lenses curve upward at the temples and don't look quite right on me. She has one of those heads and faces that make anything look good though.  Anyway, investing in a pair of glasses without trying them on is not ideal when you are spending around $200 for a pair.<br /><br />I got these yesterday and was quite pleased. They are large, look decent, appear to be sturdy, are relatively lightweight and protect my eyes well. I have been using a CHEAP pair of non-polarized glasses and these made me feel like I am wearing Maui Jims again. Don't get me wrong, these don't come close, but for around $12 you can't go wrong. I purchased the dark grey, as that is what I usually get. The lens quality is much better than I expected at this price."
5.0,"Using this bag for work...co-workers been asking where I got it from....I wish it was a little bigger though....other than that, Im very pleased with it."

5.0,"Very soft, light, flowy and vibrant! I've purchased several shirts and pants from the seller, and I love every single one of them. I specifically like the material. It doesn't have the nasty chemical smell, no excessive dye comes out when I wash it the first time, and it feels so comfortable. I live in LA, sometimes it's hard to dress for fall weather. It's a bit chilly in the morning and evening, and flaming hot in the afternoon. This material feels perfect for such weather. The color of this dress is so cool!! It's so unique, yet it looks natural. Definitely would recommend it!!"

5.0,"The title says it all.<br />I got these shoes back in June and I have worn them almost everyday since.<br />They slip on easily.<br />They weigh next to nothing.<br />They are as comfortable to walk around in as a sock or slipper, yet they are sturdy enough to run around in.<br />... and they are great to drive in!<br /><br />The only time I had any trouble with them was when running downhill over stony ground - you feel every pebble.<br /><br />I will be getting an all weather pair for the wet/cold autumn and winter months."
5.0,"I have a 750 gold (18K) ring that was scratched to the point of losing its natural shine.  With the polishing cloth, gave it a gentle rub, then a buff, and the ring turned into a mirror.

5.0,"I didn't think that I would really use these, but they were a lightening deal, so I thought I'd give them a try.  Oh my gosh, what a wonderful purchase.  We recently went to Bar Harbor for a week, so I packed using these cubes.  I fit six pairs of capris in one, eight shirts in another, shoes in one,  undies, etc in another.  My suitcase was so organized.  It made packing and unpacking a dream,  We travel a lot, so I will use these wherever we go."

5.0,"I was skeptical about this jacket but wanted something a little dressy yet warm to go over a dress. This jacket showed up and I was amazed. It is really cute, soft and warm. The fit was perfect. The only thing I had to do was reinforce the buttons which was no big deal. I got many compliments on it. I think the collar and style make it more appealing. Very unexpected for under $10. I have not washed it yet but plan to on gentle with very light fluff dry."
5.0,Very cute.  My granddaughter had her professional portraits taken in this outfit.  The silver accents were even more adorable in the photos.
5.0,"I actually really love this scarf.  There are so many different ways to tie this blanket scarf, and you can always untie it and use it like a small blanket if you are cold.  It looks just like the photo, and is good quality.  I think I will be ordering more this fall."

5.0,Really nice fit but longer in length than expected overall great . Lots of compliments
5.0,Great ring for anyone who works outside.
5.0,"First, this is a unique statement necklace.  The charm hangs down well below the length of traditional chains.  You can see the beads and intricate wire-wrapping on both sides of the charm.  As such, you don't have to worry about putting it on backward.<br /><br />The chain is long enough that I can just slide the necklace right over my head.  I have arthritis in my hands and love that I don't have to fuss over a clasp.  The chain is a shiny silver.  I have been wearing this necklace for days.  Other jewelry pieces I have bought have broken within a day.  This one has not.<br /><br />It's perfectly giftable.  I noticed that some reviewers received their necklaces in gift boxes.  Mine came in a small, gift bag. It's a similar color as my necklace.  I'm not sure if all the necklaces are color coordinated with the package, or if it's a coincidence that mine is.<br /><br />I now have two Tree Of Life necklaces and am glad I added this one to my collection.<br /><br />I received a small discount in exchange for my honest review.  However, I believe my friends and family depend on my honest opinion to make purchase decisions and never recommend products I don't use.  If you know someone that collects Tree of Life Jewelry, this necklace would be a unique addition to their collection."
5.0,granddaughter uses at the beach
5.0,"Beautiful brooch, it was a gorgeous accent piece."

5.0,Love the shirt.  It’s very colorful with a smart design.  People have commented on it.
5.0,"Earrings were well packaged and delighted the recipient, a 34 year old career woman.  They did not have the clear bead shown on the bottom of the green dangle.  When I ordered the earrings, the photo also did not show the clear bead and that was my preference.  Perhaps the design has changed slightly since my order."
5.0,Love it! Awesome hat
5.0,Nice color and warm.
5.0,My son loves the outfit. It's very comfortable and nice material.

5.0,"these are great man. I like mine really tight, so ordered 2 sizes less than normal and they fit perfectly. i wear them under my tshirts and theyre great for wicking sweat in the summer too"
5.0,"No gaping armholes! It’s hard to find a dress or tank that doesn’t have huge armhole cutouts; this dress did not disappoint. The top is thicker so there was no worry of my bra showing through, and the bottom was light and airy so it’s perfect for those hot summer days. Plus, pockets!"
5.0,"Super soft and comfortable.... So much so (this is going to sound odd) but when I got a really bad sunburn, all I could think about was putting this shirt on, because it's that soft and comfortable. It's only downside is that it wrinkles very easily and it's not the easiest shirt to iron... So much so that I usually throw it in the dryron (dryer and iron combined) as my husband calls it, with a few ice cubes or use Downy Wrinkle Releaser. I have to carry a travel size one when I wear it because my seat belt will cause wrinkles in it, even for a short period of time... But it's so worth the hassle!"
5.0,"It's cute,  it's true to size and quality description. Arrived much faster than anticipated. I would recommend it."
5.0,Love this dress and the fit. I’m a size 8 and 5’10” and the large fit great. Long enough to touch the floor even!
5.0,We wanted to love this but the underdress fit oddly on my daughter's curves and was noticeable. The neckline is absolutely as low as pictured which didn't make it mom approved for a 15 year old at a school dance.  Pity because the dress is nicely made and looks great otherwise! A definite value for the right age/ event.
5.0,"I love this shirt. It fits as expected and the material is soft. I love the sleeves, I feel like they add style but they aren't too sheer."
5.0,I am so happy with this product. The company delivered socks on time and had a sweet thank you note and a small mesh washing-machine bag so we can keep baby’s socks together and not lose them when we wash. Nice touch.
5.0,Correct sizing
5.0,I would love to see a smaller version of these or even a stud because these are very pretty and well made for the price.

5.0,Great cardigan for the price! Good value and fit as expected.
5.0,Didn’t help my skateboard ability.
5.0,Super comfy socks. I love the comfort and breathability of bamboo.
5.0,"This is a super easy top to wear. The material is comfortable, I love the sleeve detail, and the lace at the neck is a really nice touch. These little details make it a nice upgrade from a plain black t-shirt. The length is also perfect on my long torso. I’m wearing a size small. I’d buy it again!"
5.0,Worked great on my cover that was 1/8 of a size too big. Nice and soft too.
5.0,"For the price , it's super cool ! Style is unique. Love them."
5.0,hi quality. wish i had ordered brighter colors. good sock.fits great

5.0,"Fits true to sizing chart. I'm 5'5&#34;, 174 and curvy. This skirt looks great on me. I need to purchase several blouses to wear with it."
5.0,"The material is so soft. The lenght of the socks are good for the boots. Since I have a wide calf, it doesn't fit up to my knee line. The colors are nude. I like them. It really keeps warm. I spent the day with it, never felt uncomfortable."
5.0,Very cute pattern with shimmer that stays on it. Fit true to size and is very soft.
5.0,Adorable! Adorable! Adorable!
5.0,My husband absolutely loved this! Its a very good quality necklace and worth the money spent!!!
5.0,"This is as near to the perfect summer dress as you can get. It is totally comfortable, light enough without being see-through, modest enough for professional settings, and most importantly, it has pockets!!!! This is a cotton dress with just enough spandex for give. It does seem to be a tad on the small size, but having recently gained a few pounds, I'm not entirely sure whether it's me or the dress.  It's a three season item, that can be dressed up or down.  Nothing is fake -- the buttons, the pockets, all real.  After a couple of washes, it still looks and fits exactly the same as it did when it arrived. Plus, I get compliments on it every time I wear it."
5.0,"I liked the style, price, size, shape, and color."
5.0,Love this bag. It's perfect. I highly recommend.
5.0,Soooo cute and very sparkly!!!  Love them

5.0,"Good CCW belt.  Good price, well made looks good.  Made in USA always a plus."

5.0,"I bought this for my husband, he really likes them... they are not to warm and seem to fit good"
5.0,This is a gorgeous peace!!! It worth every single dollar!!  It's very well done and crafted... I'm in love with it!!! It looks classy and expensive!!!! I will definitively recommend it!!!
5.0,If you are going to spend $300 on a pair of classic Redwings you better purchase this product to condition and protect them. Worth every penny.
5.0,"I love this shirt, only down fall is the sleeves are a bit too long."

5.0,Excellent quality and great for iron ons. Fit great and are a great price.
5.0,"I  absolutely love the warmth and comfort of the Eddie Bauer Pro-Lined Pants. They were the perfect purchase for a Minnesota Winter.<br /><br />I  live in Minneapolis and our winters get cold. In the past five years, the temperatures have dipped down into the negative 40-50s with Wind Chill and I ‘ve been forced to double and sometimes triple layer my legs with tights, pants and snow pants. I  am a frequent hiker and biker in the winter months and so I am outside for long periods of time - sometimes for up to 6 hours at a time. I  needed a warm pair of pants.<br /><br />I  bought these with that in mind. I  was tired of the time it took to put on and take off multiple layers and I  wanted a pair of pants that would let me ditch the tights. These do.<br /><br />There are many qualities of these pants that I  like. Most importantly the warmth. The outside layer of the pant is made of a durable shell that’s flexible. They remind me of a regular pair of quality hiking pants that doesn’t bunch up. The inside it formed of a soft fleece. It’s sewn tightly onto the shell of the pants so the two don’t separate when putting them and the fleece is incredibly warm. A week after purchasing these pants, I  went on a 2 hour hike in -20 degree weather around Tamarack Nature Center in a suburb of Minneapolis, and my legs stayed warm the entire hike.<br /><br />They also were incredibly comfortable. The fleece hugs your legs without being itchy and without trapping your body heat. They don’t feel soggy (like previous lined pants I ‘ve owned) after hiking for a bit which means there must be good ventilation somehow. I  wear these pants multiple days of the week. They fit perfectly for my 32w 32in and I  would say they are true to size with a slight athletic fit without being tight.<br /><br />One downside of this pair of pants - like all lined pants - is they do stink up quickly. While they do a good job of wicking away moisture, there is some buildup and they do tend to smell if they are worn multiple days without a wash. Keep that in mind.<br /><br />Otherwise, I ‘m incredibly happy with the comfort, warmth and style of these pants. I  plan to purchase another pair soon!"
5.0,These were very cute and were perfect for my new grandbaby's room!
5.0,Comfy and adorable. What more can you ask for?
5.0,Just as described and feels great to wear!
5.0,Everyone loves these. Can't ever go wrong.
5.0,"Although these Hamilton earrings are very tiny, they do make a BIG statement upon wearing them.  They show the most common and uncommon logo for the phenmenal play of the same name which Lin-Manuel Miranda brought  to everyone's attention not only on Broadway but it can be streamed on television as well.  It presents when our country was new and our fight as colonists to free ourselves from England and King George.  Its main focus is on Alexander Hamilton who became our first Treasury Secretary and presents highlights which encompasses a good part of his life and his untimely death.  When I wear these simple pair of earrings, they are, like Hamilton, inspiring."
5.0,"I never have been able to find a real warm pair of gloves that still give you a bit if dexterity when needed.<br />This style does that, but these ones do it the best. The finger flap is long and goes well over the fingers all the way to the palm and folds back easily. the thick material is very insulative, even with a bit wet."
5.0,I'm always a bit leery on what to expect. This hoodie exceeded my expectations. Got the size large as I am about 165 lbs and it fit great. The graphics are very nicely set on it. Highly recommend... A+
5.0,great quality. great price. no sissapointments here. nice size. great deal
5.0,It was perfect I would re come d this site to others<br /><br />The delivery was extremely fast it was packaged well.<br /><br />I bought gloves for the rest of dance group and they loved them as well
5.0,"I'm impressed with this plush bucket bag. It appears to be as good as, if not better, than any high quality designer handbag. The workmanship is superior. I love the design. So adorable. Especially, with the novel label, ""The Bucket"".<br /><br />It has a quaint plush mini handle for carrying on the arm, and alternatively, an adjustable cross body strap. The drawstring can be adjusted so it's easy to access valuables, or keep them secure. It has two small open pockets inside for phone, and keys.<br />It also has 4 metal buttons on the bottom to help it stand independently.<br /><br />The soft material is gorgeous. I just wanna hug this bucket bag! It's a superb handbag for an excellent price."
5.0,I love these mittens be they are warm and waterproof.
5.0,"Sturdy keychain, came in a nice velvet pouch. inside it was packaged like typical necklaces or earrings are. Engraving looks very nice, my giftee loved it."
5.0,These were just like the picture
5.0,I love Nike to the core but these under armour boots feel the greatest. The Nike<br />Boot is a little flat and no cushion but the under armour have found the best in comfort and look. I wear these in law enforcement / on my feet all day .  Da bomb
5.0,"In the past I've had bad luck with companies that produce wooden watches. Several times I've ordered one, only for it to arrive shoddily made and not really worth what I paid for it. What a JOY to have opened the box containing this watch and have my expectations far exceeded! The watch arrived in perfect condition. No cracks or breakage anywhere. The band was a soft supple leather with excellent stitching and an exceptionally comfortable fit. The face of the watch is large and easy to read and the entire watch feels lightweight and just a natural extension of your arm. It stays secure to your wrist - no sliding around. It is easy to set and looks amazing with both casual and dress clothes. I truly could not have been more pleased with this item and would recommend this to anyone who wants beautiful workmanship and quality for a great price. It did take a bit longer to arrive because of how far away the shipping facility is from the US, but it really and truly was worth the wait. Just factor that into your timing, since it took about 2 1/2 weeks for it to arrive. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
5.0,Beautiful piece. Came on time. Great quality. Girlfriend loved it.
5.0,"Good quality, I like them. These are wonderful for my second hole. They go so well with dangling earrings. They are also a very classic look if you wear one larger and one smaller stud together."

5.0,Fits as expected. I love it.
5.0,This case is nice and stylish. Keeps my glasses protected.
5.0,"Really cute! The lace cut-out is a bit revealy, but I wear a matching bralette underneath for coverage. Overall, nice shirt and is exactly as pictured above."
5.0,Love these. 8mm size is perfect.
5.0,"This is the kind of hat you wear for practicality not for looking nice, so of course, the design cleverly allows for maximum portability and easy adjustment. Is it flattering? No. But it will protect you from the sun, take up very little space, and do exactly what it supposed to do. The bow in the back can be tightened if you need it to be smaller loosened if you need it to be bigger, and it is very well constructed, so you know will last a long time and not fall apart."
5.0,Very silky.  Cute scarf and a nice price!  Great to tie on my purse as I wanted a patriotic look.  The scarf is square and not very large but it is ideal for what I needed.  Perfect!

5.0,"If you are looking for a 5.11 style pants but for a cheap price, these are it.  They are well constructed and durable and don't break the bank.  They arrived on time and the sizing was perfect.  I would recommend this product and will purchasing these in the future.  Thanks."
5.0,It fits perfect! I wish it<br />Would’ve brought the little dust cloth.
5.0,They're super fun and cute! Diamonds have yet to fall out and they're durable and bendable.
5.0,"Exactly as described, plus no duplicates. I used these for a work staff project where we created our own badge holders. These worked because the back is flat compared to others that are sold for Croc charms and have the little stubs."
5.0,My husband wears a size 8 fitted baseball cap and the xxxl fit his head perfectly. It is shipped in a plastic bag but our hat did not come wrinkled and it was easy to shape.

5.0,This shirt is good for workouts and gym.
5.0,"This belt is a quite a game changer in my case.  I was just going to get a belt buckle and leave everything as is, but after finding a belt that resembles the movie version I had to get it.  Also the pouches I used before for my DP costume sucked; this belt remedied that problem."
5.0,"Al comienzo pense que era muy holgado, pero despues que comienzas hacer ejercicio se va perfeccionando a como en verdad quieres que te quede."
5.0,"This is the perfect pretty breezy summer dress! Easy to get on and wear all day, dressy enough to wear to weddings, yet casual enough to just wear around home on a hot day. You could also wear it over a bathing suit to the beach. My man loved it on me too 😁"

5.0,This is my second pair from a different company I suppose.<br /><br />The boots I'm wearing I've had for 2 weeks and I like them so much I bought another.<br /><br />Next I will buy a pair of black ones.<br /><br />I'm part of an amputee group and I recommended these there and a bunch of amputees bought themselves pairs.<br /><br />Us amputees are always looking for lightweight alternatives to shoes and boots.<br /><br />These boots are perfect for us.
5.0,Very quality I love it 😍 very beautiful
5.0,"Very cute and comfortable..I got an XL and it was little snug, go up a size for a looser fit. Definitely ordering more."
5.0,So cute ! Besides how long it took to get here I love it.
5.0,"i was gifted the grey version. it's soft and flexible, but doesnt feel flimsy. the band is skinnier, so it's more dainty and feminine than the thicker bands. I'm very happy with it and the grey color matches everything."
5.0,"She really likes these, she was surprised I picked them out, being I am am a dude with little fashion sense"
5.0,I bought this skirt in black.  I was concerned about those that said you can see right through it.  You cannot are through this skirt at all. No lines. Nothing.  Maybe they ordered too small. I have to say it’s beautiful. Fit is great - I ordered a small. I wear a size 4 pants normally.  It does show a very slight bulge in my belly which is not that big but the wrap tie covers that.  I just ordered it in blue.  Beautiful and made well.
5.0,Was very happy with my purchase probably the best one...I researched a lot of cheerleader costumes in a one piece

5.0,"Great size, I originally gave this a two but it's a mouse pad, not a wall mount picture... the colors aren't as vibrant as the photo, but it's a mouse pad, it has one job. since it does it's job fantastically, 5 stars it is."
5.0,"These slippers are so comfortable and warm, I cannot recommend them enough. I have wood floors in my apartment which get cold in winter. These slippers keep my feet warm and comfortable, but don't slip on our wood flooring. The fit seems perfect for my feet, so I'm a very happy customer."
5.0,"high quality Pandora charm, seller very fast shipper!"
5.0,We will definitely be looking at other dresses from this site.  My daughter loves it and it is so comfortable on her.
5.0,"Arrived on time, but it did take a while.  Nice and feminine. I bought a large which fits perfectly on my 5'4"", 40DD body.  The bodice fits loose but not too loose; in other words, it's not bodycon and that's my preference for tops. I recommend."
5.0,No problems. Fits well and is very comfortable
5.0,"Needed it for breast cancer month. Came well packaged, and exceeded my expectations! Will continue shopping here for more earrings"
5.0,Great product.Great price.
5.0,"While I didn’t use them for the whole grooming did use them for a nursing home chihuahua retrieval.  Poor little girl only knows and trusts 1 person, so she’s impossible to care for.  I gave her my thumb and index finger last time (it took 2 weeks to heal up).  This time, with the gloves, she got her bite and relaxed and I didn’t even have a bruise!  Great padding, tough suede exterior, I even used them for a pottery firing."
5.0,I’m only 5’3”. I was worried it would be too long but they fit great!  Love them!
5.0,Comfortable and classy.
5.0,Great coverage on a pair of suede shoes. Very pleased with the result.
5.0,Llego antes de lo esperado

5.0,"Bought for teenage daughter, she loves them and says they’re comfy, and fit well."
5.0,"It can be difficult to find ballet tights that hold up well with active dancing and stretching in ballet. The last two ballet tights my daughter has used tore within the first few ballet lessons, which has led to frustration for her. When we saw these pop up on Amazon Vine we decided that it would be worth a try. When our daughter tried these on she said that it was very soft and comfortable. She then went to her lesson and came out without any tears in the tights. Months later and these tights are still, incredibly, still without tears in them. This has become our go to brand for her ballet tights."
5.0,Gonna be great for early season hunts....
5.0,"Awesome! fits great, washes great, looks great, stay in place! love love love these. I'm ordering 2 more"
5.0,We bought these for my 11 & 12 year olds to carry at Disney World. They worked out great!
5.0,LIKE IT!
5.0,The fit is nice and the quality of the shirt is great. I think that I'm going to order another one of it in a different color.
5.0,This adorable dress is versatile and can be worn alone or with a belt.  Nice soft material!  It is roomy and very comfortable.  Great product for the price!  The navy blue color was exactly what I was hoping for and would consider buying in another color.  Great for all seasons.
5.0,"I bought this item, and its perfect for the summer. [and its got three pockets as well, for wallet, cell phone...]"
5.0,"I liked that they are small, but not too small, and have beautiful stones inlaid in the silver."
5.0,I am 5'4  weigh 116 and this fits me perfectly. I love it so much I ordered other color .
5.0,They are good and I like them
5.0,Fits just right even after washed. This is my 3rd pack purchased.  Would recommend
5.0,They are wonderful! Simply delightful to wear.<br /> Love them.
5.0,"These gloves are soft, warm and very stylish. I have had no issue when using my phone with them on. I purchased large and they fit pretty snug, which I think helps with dexterity."
5.0,Super cute and comfy. My son loves them!
5.0,"Love the material. Warm, but breathable. Just what I needed for working outside. ."
5.0,"My bought this for a gift for my dad. He's a bushcrafter and he wanted a hat for his patches. I figured this would be great, since it would also be some what water resistant. He loves it!"
5.0,I'll keep this short and sweet. I love my timepieces and this is definitely one of my new favorites. Excellently crafted and the band quality far exceeded my expectation. It really was a very pleasant surprise. If you buy this watch I'm sure you'll enjoy it immensely. Hope this review helped. Cheers!
5.0,"The Fox River ragg wool and leather gloves are very high quality. They are long as well, which means that if you want to pull them up all the way, they will easily cover your wrist. Also, they run true to size, not like the cheap wool gloves you find in a lot of retail and discount stores. Size large really is large, which is why I am giving my large pair to my son, who has big hands, and ordering a medium size pair for myself. The old adage, ""you get what you pay for"" is true with this product. They are not inexpensive, but they are worth the price, in my opinion. I have had many pairs of ragg wool gloves in the past, but they always ended up with holes at the tips of the fingers. The way these gloves are knit, in my view, should prevent this happening prematurely, if at all. I highly recommend this item."
5.0,"This is a very high quality belt. When my son opened the nice package he asked, &#34;wow, how much was this!&#34; I had to inform him that it was very reasonable. Its classic and solid. I would definitely buy this again. Shipping was as expected."
5.0,Purchased during NYS Covid-19 outbreak to make ear savers. Added buttons and gave to my daughter who is an OT to share with other medical staff.
5.0,Fits exactly like I wanted it to
5.0,"Lo compre para mi sobrina y le encanto, es elegante de buen material creo que resistira mucho tiempo"
5.0,Can't wait to wear this to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter!!!
5.0,"Great product, would definitely buy again."
5.0,I thought these were a little pricey but honestly worth the money. These are comfy and fit my feet very well. I have wide feet do this is a big plus. I definitely want more pairs!
5.0,"These are simple and classy. Love them. One earring of one pair arrived with a stone separated from earring, and they replaced immediately, so I am still giving 5 stars."
5.0,I’ve wanted a set of these for a long time. I love them! My kids think I’m silly and my four year old granddaughter thinks they’re great!
5.0,"Need to stock up for cooking soups, casseroles, stews ect."
5.0,These arrived at my door before expected and was exactly like explained.
5.0,It was a very nice product
5.0,"These tights are great! I really love the ombre pattern. They have great tummy control while still being comfortable. They also fit great. I'd love to have these in all colors, and a capri version would be great too. These are perfect for relaxing, exercising, running errands, or just sitting around the house. Basically I love them and I want to live in them all day every day! They have held up well after several washings and did not shrink."
5.0,Perfect fit!  Will purchase more… from Santa!
5.0,I purchased a size 9 in these shoes for my father and he liked them!  They fit properly and were comfortable.
5.0,"Love the style, fabric thick and stretches, well made, looks very expensive, hard to believe I paid so little, best of all it is flattering.  Usually wear a size 8, but I bought this in large and am glad I did.  I'm 5'2 34D with waist measuring 29 and hips 37."
5.0,the sides are a little odd but everything else was beautiful!
5.0,Dainty and exquisite necklace--- just what I wanted !
5.0,Perfect dize
5.0,Very comfortable. Fit nicely
5.0,"So far so good. I wore the socks the first week and they were very comfortable. But I wanted to have them washed in the washing machine before writing a review. I did so, so I am wearing them for the second week after washing them. They feel like the first week. I am going to order another set."
5.0,The best wallets!
5.0,"I've been wearing these socks for everyday since 2013. They wear very well under cowboy boots and paddock boots without slipping down or rubbing. I'm thrilled to find them here in a 3-pack! They wash and dry repeatedly without getting thin in the toes or heels like so many other socks. I give them as gifts and I highly recommend them.<br /><br />One note: they are sized in men's, so women should order size Medium. Large is for really big clod-hoppers!"
5.0,Really pretty for the price -- ordered it for a b day gift! just love it!
5.0,These are way too big for my face/head. The mask comes up under my eye lashes! Way too big. Fits a little better on family with bigger heads but still comes up too high.
5.0,"OMG!! It's so soft and flowly  I absolutely love the way it feels. I ordered this in an XL should have gotten the L it was bigger than I wanted. I am 5ft 3in  185 lbs a L would have been a better fit, have not worn or washed it yet so not sure if or how much it would shrink."
5.0,True to size. Beautiful dress. Wore it for Valentine's day!
5.0,"This is very pretty. Good product, served its purpose."
5.0,Very well made! looks expensive!
5.0,"These socks are so comfortable.  My feet feel like they are wrapped in cotton batting....so soft.  They are easy to put on and take off.  I have told several of my co workers and they are going to order a pair.  I ordered one pair to try them and when I got home from work after wearing them that day, I ordered (2) 2 packs.  They come in the most fun and colorful patterns.  Haven't washed them yet but I don't anticipate any problems!"
5.0,Lovely dress it came very quickly like two days and I love this dress it feels soft and has bounce to it. It's true to size I ordered my regular size and it fits nicely. It isn't see through and I've washed it several times I allowed it to air dry the first wash didn't really like the outcome so I put it in the dryer on another occasion it didn't shrink at all.  It's holding up great I've had it for a couple months now. Great buy so happy I recommend this dress ladies buy it.
5.0,"Ring is just as beautiful as the photos. Great quality, amazing packaging and absolutely gorgeous.<br /><br />SWAROVSKI always presents such beautiful products, and this was no exception."
5.0,"I use this every day I work. It's the perfect size for my painful arthritic body, it's big enough to hold everything I need and small enough not to cause pain when I carry it."
5.0,"Great product, nice feel, pretty color.<br />My son's favorite so far."
5.0,"Beautiful necklace, sturdy and sweet"
5.0,Exactly as described. Good fit very comfortable. Just like oem.
5.0,"Super soft and holds a great amount of items which makes it a great item for strolling a park, the beach, hiking, etc. I highly recommend the Scarleton bags."
5.0,"If you're a cat lover you will really enjoy this unique cat purse. You can't go wrong with a Laurel Burch design. I purchased this purse as a birthday gift for a friend, but I like it so much I am keeping it. I will order another one in a different color for my friend. It is a little larger than I expected, which I like. It holds all the essentials. You won't be disappointed."
5.0,"great look,goof fit love the ring"
5.0,I am very pleased with the Collar Bars I received.  I got one Gold & one Silver to wear with different suits.  Thank You

5.0,"gift for eldery person, great for someone who spends the majority of time in bed"
5.0,"Comfortable and beautiful, love Cobian🤘"
5.0,"Love this item. I was a little worried the zippers were going to be defective because they were half open and half closed but so far so good. I will keep an eye on them however once I use it on our vacation next week and should I have any issues, I’ll update!  But it seems like a great bag with really good capacity. I was really happy with it when I opened up the box. The material was different than I was expecting (in a good way), so, I suggest this item for sure."
5.0,My daughter was so happy receiving it for her birthday. Great quality
5.0,It's comfortable feels good on my skin being short it comes to my knees
5.0,"I wear this as a toe ring (all day every day...for a year) and it is lovely- a year later it is scratched, as one would expect anything that I own to be, but that's on me...not on the ring...haha! I have several rings that i've bought from other vendors and the silver rubs off to a gross underneath metal. NOT THIS ONE! Solid still after a year!! Thank you!!"
5.0,"Look very nice, lightweight,, slightly too tight on my head. (Perhaps I have a fat head?) 🤷🏼‍♀️"
5.0,"Nice sheath, fits the need I had. Currently using this on a Global brand knife. Would recommend this for a narrower blade knife. Not the strongest plastic material, but would be good enough protection for a drawer or knife roll. Very easy to use."
5.0,So pretty when it glows the glow is a green shade and it is a great piece.
5.0,Simple and nice looking shades. Happy with the purchase.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:edf9faf29f69d32fe89e727bd38adac]] They are cute and perfect for the earrings that I made.
5.0,Fit so well and is extremely comfortable and looks great under my clothes. I purchased another the next day.
5.0,it's a beautiful dress. I like it!
5.0,"This garment will work for fall, spring, and cold summer mornings. I need something heavier for winter."
5.0,Just right for my Christmas skate arrangement
5.0,This is a true xl. Must buy. Exactly as pictured!!!
5.0,"Cheap, fits well, and wasn't uncomfortable to wear."
5.0,This belt is a must have for those who care to shape up their  bodies. I am super pleased with it👌😀
5.0,"Bought for tanning salon use. Fits nice. Good material, has helps up well to daily washing."
5.0,great buy~
5.0,"These are great, everyday wear salwars.  The cotton is very lightweight, which I like.  I would recommend hanging these to dry immediately out of the washer, if you want to avoid ironing.  I don't know if I'd put them in the dryer, unless you have a really low dryer setting, as these are pure cotton.  As far as the sizing, I've ordered 3 pair, and all fit.  However, I did choose to order one size up (because I don't like a snug fit)."
5.0,"First off, as I said this top looks hot, as in sexy and casual. It's snug, and definitely hugs your curves. It's comfortable and surprisingly warm, too. The khaki/cream color is nice and neutral, and should go with just about anything casual. This plus a pair of nice jeans and you have a look going.<br /><br />That said, the one problem is that the buttons are REALLY tight in the holes. It takes a fair bit of effort to make them fit. I do not recommend this top to anyone who has problems with their fingers (such as arthritis) because you'll have a hard time buttoning up.<br /><br />Bottom line: A nice, sexy-but-modest henley that you and your significant other will enjoy. Five Stars."
5.0,My granddaughter loved the dress. She lost 10 pounds so the dress was a little big but she was gonna wear a belt with it. She still loved it.
5.0,"Loved this dress and color! I was nervous about tangerine, but it actually was gorgeous. Stretchy, comfortable, and fit snug in the right spots. True to size."
5.0,The buckle was larger than I expected - that's a good thing. Very high quality and it even comes with a hole punch tool in case the sizing is a little off (or you're like me and are fatter than you thought.)
5.0,"June 1, 2016<br /><br />Disclosure: I received the Rioriva Men's Dress Socks Mid Calf Crew Tube Socks for Business Grey Black Navy for free from the seller, in exchange for a fair and HONEST review. Also, please note that I ordered this product through my husband's account, as he's currently the one with access to Amazon Prime.<br /><br />Note: This is the specific set of socks I'm reviewing: [[ASIN:B01DNQM33E RioRiva Men's Dress Socks Mid Calf Crew Tube Socks for Business Grey Black Navy,BSK13 - Pack of 4,One Size]]<br /><br />-----<br />Why I Ordered This Product=&gt;<br /><br />As I've said in a review for another pair of socks manufactured by this company, I've had quite a few of my nice dress socks get eaten during laundry time, so I'm looking to replace them. I had the opportunity to replace them with the product under review, at the moment.<br /><br />-----<br />What I'm Looking For, In Products, Like This=&gt;<br /><br />These socks should, of course, come in the quantity promised. But beyond quantity, I expect the socks to be a good and comfortable fit, either with or without wearing my Mary Jane shoes. Because these are supposed to be nice dress socks worn when I'm dressed up (or, at least, when I need to wear my dress shoes), I expect the socks to look elegant. Beyond good looks, however, I expect the fabric, while thin enough to be comfortable while wearing dress shoes, to have a good quality weave and construction, keeping the inevitable wear and tear away for quite a long time (I've had socks wear out on me within a few months to a year).<br /><br />-----<br />How This Product Meets My Needs=&gt;<br /><br />I was delighted that this product is a four-pack, as this allows me to replace my lost socks much more quickly. And while I'm usually not a fan of prints, I found that the prints on these socks are nicely understated, adding to the elegance of them. The fabric has a good, tight weave, so while it isn't thick--it shouldn't be, as they're meant for dress shoes--they feel strong and durable, staving off wear and tear for quite a while. Finally, the socks are a comfortable fit, both with and without my shoes, and I'll enjoy putting them on, each and every time.<br /><br />-----<br />Final Rating=&gt;<br /><br />I have zero complaints, and I'm completely satisfied with the product I received. Hence, I see no reason not to give this product five stars out of five.<br /><br />-----<br />Summary (Pros)=&gt;<br /><br />1) This product comes in a pack of four pairs of the same sock design<br />2) The prints are understated, giving it elegance<br />3) The socks have a good, tight weave, and the stitching is solid, making them capable of resisting wear and tear<br />4) The socks are a comfortable fit, with and without my dress shoes, and I'll enjoy wearing them, each and every time<br /><br />Summary (Cons)=&gt;<br /><br />1) None that I'm able to see, at the moment"
5.0,Easy to use and colorful.
5.0,Got three pack as it said. Feels not bad when lying on hands.
5.0,"I would get them in all of the colors. I am 5'4"" and about 140. Purchased them in MEDIUM and they fit great. They are super comfortable."

5.0,very cute dress..hubby loves it..perfect for a wedding not too short..the zippers gets caught but overall great product for the price.

5.0,These are great pants and I'll probably order more for working outside in
5.0,Real cute and very comfortable
5.0,"I am so happy I found this ring on a “today’s deal.” It is so pretty and I love the way it looks. I love my wedding ring but I always feel like I am going to hit it on something and knock a stone out. With this ring, I haven’t felt that way. So far it hasn’t snagged on anything nor have I worried about knocking a stone out. Especially for the price. If I were to knock a stone out, I wouldn’t be up uoset. The ring even has a nice sparkle to it from the sunlight. It didn’t come in a nice box though. Just in a felt, “drawstring” bag."
5.0,Shirt fits well and is a comfortable material. Love the deisgn!
5.0,My boyfriend loves my dress. It looks great on me. Very comfortable and looks great! Fits as expected. Washes very well! I would buy it again.

5.0,Just what I expected and got it in time!
5.0,"This tie looked even better than the photos.  It came wrapped in a close-fitting plastic sheath.  I expected to have to get it to the dry cleaners to make it suitable to wear.  To my complete surprise, it came out of the wrapping without a single wrinkle or crease.  It ties like really good silk.  Although I have a ton of ties, if I need any new ones, I'll look here first!"
5.0,"Light weight in comparison to all other rack and rolls we had seen in the past. My daughter has 7 costumes and they fit perfectly, although there was not enough room for her dance sneakers. I like the color but wish they would have offered other options."
5.0,I love it! Most comfortable flattering dress!
5.0,Two thumbs up👍🏻👍🏻 Wallet’s perfect for cards to keep safe and not scratch. Perfect birthday gift for men too.

5.0,"This was a very cute costume.  I liked that it had the suit, mask and backpack!  They used the backpack to collect Halloween candy and my son was even complimented on his costume!"
5.0,This long sleeve top is great for the winter. It's soft and keeps you warm as you hang out at home or even with a cozy jacket when going outdoors. The fact that it has pockets on the side it great. Especially when going for a walk with my dog and I have a pocket for my keys.
5.0,A lot nicer and better quality than I thought it would be for the money.
5.0,Awesome pin!! It is a bigger pin like one review said and that is why I wanted it. I love it! I also received it really fast.

5.0,Love this dress it a perfect fit for my weight and height.
5.0,I just got them and they are great.  Are they are a tiny bit thinner than Oakley lenses but not much.  They have nice packaging and have a warranty.  I will have to see about polarization but I will check.  they worked great driving in the snow today and have nice finish.  Great price!!!
5.0,Very durable and nice! Wore it for a friends wedding
5.0,I'm a 9.5 in shoes but a 10 was perfect and roomy enough for thick socks !! Would buy again ! There was no unpleasant chemical smell either ! And felt pretty sturdy !
5.0,These are the only headbands that stay on my head!
5.0,"This is the most beautiful belt, but had to return it. I had already owned that same belt in my grosgrain collection. The picture color on my computer looked a little different. The store was the best in processing my return.  I will shop with them again and again. Customer service is top of their list. I purchaesed their other belts. Mailing was very fast and excellent service. Thank you!!!"
5.0,Sent this to my Dad for Father's Day and he loved it! Said the style was really nice and goes with most of his outfits.
5.0,A little larger then expected but still a good deal.
5.0,"I had pulled my achilles, and while thank god I didn't tear it it did have me off my feet for a few weeks. Once I was able to start putting some weight on my foot again I purchased these to help aid in the healing and to make sure I didn't re-aggravate it. It fit perfect, and worked like a charm. I even continued to use it for awhile when I started jogging again and I couldn't be happier with this product."
5.0,"This was a bit stiff out of the box, but after first use it softened perfectly! Love it!"
5.0,"Adorable outfit. My daughter loves it, and it's very warm and cozy inside. She gets complimented at preschool every time she wears it. Highly recommend. Ordered the size she normally wears and it fit perfectly."

5.0,Yes it does.looks great.
5.0,"Good fit, durable, comfortable"
5.0,Perfect great for wearing under skirts
5.0,Nice quality at an affordable rate.
5.0,"This product is made of high quality materials.  Other than it arriving with the box destroyed and it looked like it had been repackaged and taped up the contents were new, individually wrapped, and undamaged.  Setup was easy, It only needs the supplied Allen wrench to assemble.  This umbrella opens and closes effortlessly and it can be tilted at many angles as well as the base can rotate 365 degrees as needed.  I am very impressed so far.  For this price point, this is the one to get!.  It appears that the cover can be replaced as it wears out as it is connected to the frame as snaps and velcro."
5.0,Great cute lot of comments
5.0,living in nd you gotta protect from the cold this works awesome even in negative temps witch we have a lot of here
5.0,"I'm all about wanting NO BOUNCE and trying this on -- I think it will do the trick.  PS. Fits true for me, a 38-C"
5.0,My grandson loved it and had to show it off in his kindergarten class!  He is a slim boy and getting an adjustable belt that will keep his pants up and his bum tucked in was a relief.  It was an added bonus that is was a Batman belt.
5.0,Beautiful watch band definitely want to buy other colors! The only con I would say is that it sometimes snags on certain tops of my mine so definitely be careful with that.
5.0,I love all of them and have no complaints so far. I got mine in 00G and they just arrived today. They’re exactly what I expected and they fit nicely.
5.0,"This jogging suit fits ok now I ordered a large, the pants fit great but my top is a little tight because I have large breast, so I would order a size larger if you have larger….."
5.0,item was delivered perfect.
5.0,Great Product!  Very cute gift.
5.0,I was skeptical about buying this dress but I was attracted by the style it was shipped to my home on time and it fits great my little niece looks cute highly recommend the quality is so hard to find cloth online in American size not chinese this dress is American size highly recommend it 👌🏻
5.0,Even lovelier than in the photo. I get lots of comments and compliments - as I work in neuroscience.
5.0,Purchased as a gift. The quality is very good. The writing is a bit small but the sentiment is beautiful. My cousin loved it.
5.0,These Compression socks seemed to help with a swollen feet issue for a relative when diuretics and other medical treatments did not.
5.0,Love this bag! Made with sturdy material and I use it all the time.
5.0,"I followed the side guide and it fits really beautifully, I’m a a rhinestone artist so I rhinestone cosplay and these garments work beautifully for what I do! I would say if you want more mobility go a size up but if you want it to fit to size order your true size."
5.0,Love it !<br />Thanks much 👍🏻
5.0,I bought these for my wife. She loves them.
5.0,Got one for me in purplish color and one for my husband in gray. This is a great goggle for the price.  All other goggles I tried on- including some that were hundreds of dollars- made it feel like my nose was being plugged. This particular model has a modified nose foam piece that looks like it's been cut out a bit.  We went on a skiing trip with these in the mountains and had blue sky every day and liked the tint just fine- no problems and no fog.  But them!
5.0,Fits perfect and fells great
5.0,Loved this dress!! Got a lot of compliments on it. I'm 250 lbs 6 ft. Y'all i ordered a 2x.
5.0,Warm and comfortable.  Layered over grey turtleneck and was great!
5.0,I love this necklace and I get so many compliments on it! Love that it is adjustable do I can wear it with different necklines.
5.0,"These arrived looking much better than I thought they might.  A nice quality of silver, very light weight.  I am glad I purchased them and already received compliments when I wore them."
5.0,"Works very well, I think it is a very useful article for the winter season, I recommend it."
5.0,These gloves fit my hands perfectly. They were very comfortable and soft. They protect my hands from the cold weather very well while I walk my dogs. Very happy with the purchase!
5.0,"Its a great soft meshy materially. Loved the color. However, top and bottoms comes in one size. Cant customize if your top is big and your bottom is small. However, it's lingerie and bottoms are option."
5.0,Amazing buy. Well made super nice great price no complaints.
5.0,LOVE! This allowed me to get super cute newborn pictures and was just as pictured!
5.0,I am allergic to Nickel and was expecting to only wear this necklace for a couple of hours. I wore it all day with no irritation. The links are not as flimsy as expected. It's a great statement necklace.
5.0,"Looks expensive and classy. Can't beat the price. Had to hem it because it is very very long but that, as well as the slight looseness (I ordered a size up just to be on the safe side), was a welcomed flexibility to have the dress tailored correctly. The pricetag allows for the extra splurge and it makes all the difference."
5.0,"This product fit great and looked amazing. Unfortunately, due to COVID our Halloween plans changed but the costume would have been perfect."
5.0,"I really appreciate the design of shoulders. It breaks down dullness of a dark sweater and makes it charming and appealing. And the design of its sleeves is very special as well, which look like morning glories. I think it's very appropriate for dating or hanging out! My friends even asked me where I got this and wanted to get the same one! lol"
5.0,"This is such a beautiful and elegant  blouse love the tie and if you don’t want to do the tie bottoms hold the tie, a must buy and the price was well worth it, wish they had other colors!!"
5.0,My Mother just adored the pearls. Well made product. I have cultured pearls not fresh water and hers were just as beautiful as mine. So needless to say I am very pleased as is my Mom. I will tell everyone about your site. Thank-you.
5.0,nice product but definitely runs on the small size . I reordered an XL this time .. 5 stars because nice cotton material and for the price very good buy.
5.0,"The shape of this bra for small wide set breasts is amazing. It would be flattering on anyone, but if you are a size A this bra gives you a nice NATURAL shape. No strange cone like things sticking off your chest. My only criticism, is that I don't like the synthetic material. I wish there was a cotton option. Otherwise these bars are pretty much perfect."
5.0,"These are surprisingly good quality for the price. They are also really cute and fit my face perfectly, they are just the right size!"
5.0,Sold these fast! My customers loved these!
5.0,"This sweater classy and edgy. Lace up is in style and this sweater meets the mark!<br /><br />Like all Glamaker items, this sweater does not disappoint. This sweater is as decribed and fits perfectly.<br /><br />This set sweater is a chunky knit blend and is well made.

5.0,perfect looks just like original
5.0,My my is it gorgeous! B
5.0,This band feels great.  What was best was how easy it was to take out links with the tools provided.
5.0,"I ordered these keychains off another site a while back and they were in really bad condition. The charms kept falling off, etc. I decided to get replacements and found these, and they are perfect. Very good condition, the charms are on there pretty good and thick chain to where it won't just fall off."
5.0,"I think this product is worth it. It arrived on time, carefully packaged and not damaged. I had no issues with the stole and enjoyed the way it felt and looked in my graduation photos."

5.0,Walking & biking
5.0,"I love those pant but, they were a little to big for me but my daughter could wear them well, so I gave them to her for Mother’s Day she say she like them. So it work out well fitted her well but she say they were a little to long. So she will take then to a cleaners to get a little taper at bottom of pants and a little in the stomach areas. Next time I order<br />Pants I need a medium or large it depends on the Material if it stretchy or not.<br />  Thank You, DJ<br />  Customer,"
5.0,"I am 5'2&#34; and wear size 6; ordered XL because I wanted to be able to wear it as a dress - and that's exactly what it fits like, pretty loose but drapes very nicely, not at all bag-like. Since I am short and got XL the hem comes down to about 2&#34; above the knee for me. It's very cute as a dress but can certainly be worn with tights/ slim pants as a tunic too. Very happy with the purchase."
5.0,"It’s exactly as advertised, well made and really nice look. My son looked great with it on!"
5.0,I have a large rib cage and the zipper fit just enough. I wear a 36 C and have athletic/average build.
5.0,Exceed expectations but a little on the weighty side......now to put to the durability test.
5.0,I'm a 36C and bought a Medium - fits perfectly and I can actually wear it for sports since it has pretty good support.  I machine washed and line dried it and it's withstood several rugby practices.
5.0,"It's tiny! It is shorter than my panties, so it's not for public viewing!"

5.0,Very handy and useful.
5.0,"This is a beautiful, uniquely made wrap/shawl.  The knit pattern is what you'd expect to see in a much more expensive wrap. The design makes it possible to wear in different configurations.  The fit and color are both as expected.  It would make a terrific gift!"
5.0,"I love my dress, got too much compliments"

I've had several people ask me about it and I love that It always leads to a conversation about my love of travel.  I seriously love it and have only taken it off to shower. Im even thinking of buying another one to hang on my rear view mirror in my car!"
5.0,A great pair of eye protective glasses. Use the screwdriver provided and remove the nose pads for a tighter fit. Helping people in need is always a great thing.
5.0,Super cute! Great length.
5.0,Really cute and fit perfectly
5.0,Super nice for a lanyard and worth the price.
5.0,🙂 nice
5.0,Order this dress right now and you will not be disappointed!  I received so many compliments and It was well made using nice material. It really is one of those dresses that would flatter all figures. I did have to sew the top a little to lessen the cleavage because it was a family wedding. I picked the blue one and it was a very pretty color. It’s important to note: I have a baby so I needed to be bending down and picking him up a lot. It was great for that and super comfortable.
5.0,It is a high quality shawl. It will definitely keep you war. The color is very soft.
5.0,"I bought as a gift for my sister and she loved it. Thank you for getting it here in time for her birthday, and for a great product."

5.0,Really nice boot & beautiful on!
5.0,"Love it! I needed a tutu to complete my Zumba Glow party costume, and this was perfect! It's short, but worn over leggings or booty shorts it's just fine."
5.0,"Very very pretty, I love them!!"
5.0,"I order this as a now for now outfit bec the one I planned didnt work out..and let me tell you. My baby said I look stunning.<br />I'm 5""11 175 lbs I order a medium and it for perfectly"
5.0,Perfect little gift for my boyfriend! He loves naruto and now he jokingly wears the headband and carries the coin wallet. Very pleased with the gift!

5.0,"These ear rings are lightweight,  very comfortable  would make a great gift. If you like dainty earrings that you never have to remove and go with everything,  theses are for you"
5.0,"I'll be honest I know nothing about Pokemon or even who this character is. I bought them as a reward for my 11 year old with autism. I like that the material is soft so he doesn't mind wearing it around his neck or complain about it being scratching, the latch is sturdy  and hasn't broken perfect for keeping his house key and his school ID on it there is also a little string that works as a little back up too! He loves Eevee so it works out perfectly he has a backup just in case he loses one or in the case it breaks but for the quality I think they will last for a while"
5.0,Nice top you will have to wear something under it as it’s see through. I wouldn’t size up like I did its big.
5.0,Go Giants!
5.0,Bought to give as a gift and the recipient LOVES this purse. Well made and met my expectations.

5.0,Love em. Seem to really help. Used them for plantar fasciitis
5.0,Exactly what I wanted! My 6 year old loved it!
5.0,"This is not a nursing bra, I don't know why it says that on the box or in the description, unless you consider a really stretchy soft comfortable wireless bra to be a nursing bra. That being said, it's smooth and seamless, I have been sleeping in it and it's perfect coverage and the back is nice and high and completely smooth out any of those bulges that were sticking out with regular bra straps pinching my fat out! I normally wear 36B, and I got a medium and it's perfect. I think it's possible that it may stretch out over time with continued use, but I guess I'm not surprised seeing as how I haven't wanted to take it off since I put it on!"
5.0,These are lovely.  Large! They touch my shoulders sometimes when I'm sitting and I tip them off no problem.  They aren't too big.  They are just the &#34;right&#34; big.  And well made and sturdy and not heavy.  Super cute.
5.0,"Got it for a gift, but it looks nice"
5.0,"I should have ordered the next size down; however I love the garment and it wears very well.  The colors are gorgeous and make me feel good.  Absolutely perfect as far as I'm concerned, even if they are just a tad too large."
5.0,Great Christmas gift for my Nephew. He loves his new watch.
5.0,"I have ordered-and returned- MANY bridal sashes in the last month.  I have learned to pay close attention to the description and measurements.  Many, if you read closely are the exact pattern;  some larger, some smaller, with or without pearls.  This one is truly a different pattern from the rest. And it is beautiful.  I was surprised at the itty-bitty packaging it comes in (size of a small ring box, no joke).  This is a thinner belt with all rhinestone pattern with the ribbons attached at the ends of the rhinestones.  It is a beautiful pattern. And I was happy to finally find a pattern/size/style that looked good with the intricate wedding dress."
5.0,Only negative would be that the beads are not movable.  Lover loved the feeling!
5.0,"Let me first say, I love PattyBoutik. The shirts are always very comfortable, stylish and easy to maintain.  I ordered this Cut Out Keyhole tank in size M for my mother-in-law.  I have the black one and she loved it so much that I got her the blue one for her birthday. She gets tons of compliments."
5.0,"I love wheel house socks, both the quality of the socks and the designs are excellent"
5.0,"I am 5' 3&#34; and weigh 125-130 lbs. I ordered a small and it is a great product, no rips, no tears. But the small on me is fitted and to the skin, but not too tight. I will be ordering another in different colors, but I will probably go up to a medium so I have a little extra space."
5.0,Got this for my daughter birthday and it came very well made. Don't know how it handles in the wash but it came packaged very well and came sooner than expected.  She is going to be stocked!  Thanks
5.0,"Really liked the quality, the batter pack lasted well butthe sizing was way off. I ordered a large in kens and it fit like a small."
5.0,A very beautiful piece and at a very good price!<br />A lady will be very happy to receive this!
5.0,Nice heavy material. Lots of glam for when I'm dancing. Color is just as bright as in the picture. Great addition to my dance costume.
5.0,I love them. Variety not too expensive and comfortable.
5.0,Very nice and perfect size.
5.0,Top fits great bottoms are to big for me as im a large bottom ordered 2xl.  Feels great fabric.  Adjustable top. See through.
5.0,"Really nice, sturdy bag. Several pockets inside and one outside that are handy."
5.0,"I'm 5'7"" approx. 135lb wearing size S. Fabric is stretchy with a nice weight. Love it."
5.0,"Beautiful Pendant . Purchased The Earrings From This Seller, But Earrings Were Listed Seperately  Not As A Set. From This Seller. Beautiful! Love  Earrings And Pendant! Love My Erring And Pendant Set."
5.0,"These are very comfortable for working on your feet a lot. We got size 12, but they seem to run a little big; however, this gives extra room for the toes. Also, my husband has a bolt in one ankle, so he just doesn't tie that one up all the way and that works fine for him. He is very happy with these boots!"
5.0,Best product yet
5.0,A wonderful necklace I had ordered for our third child to share in our wedding anniversary.  I had purchased the same necklace for my other two children at a local store but they did not have the required third one.  It was a perfect match.  I received it ahead of schedule and in wonderful condition.  All is very much appreciated.
5.0,"I LOVE this bathing suit.  For me, the sizing was perfect.  I take a medium in shirts and a 10 in pants, but need to hide a bit of a belly so I ordered the XL and it fit perfectly.  It covers what I want to cover without looking frumpy.  I tried it on and my husband looked at me like I was wearing a bikini, so I would say that it's still sexy.  They are a nice solid material, don't feel cheap at all and you just can't go wrong for the price.  I did order this in the black and white stripe in a Large and it was too tight, so I'll be exchanging that plus I want the black polka dot one if it comes back in stock in my size."
5.0,I had a blast in this at the ren fair. It looked really good
5.0,Perfect watch band for my tiny wrist.  Plus I am not allergic so that was a pleasant surprise as I have issues with most metals.
5.0,The sizing is spot on and is exactly what is advertised. It was a little bit long on me but I have a shorter torso.
5.0,Very comfortable.  A little long for me but I just “wrinkle “ them at the ankles.
5.0,Was very impressed with the dress in all. Very pretty and exactly what I ordered.
5.0,Great designs and material and got here super fast.
5.0,These panties are very comfortable and sexy. Would be great in latex.

5.0,Great witch dress. Perfect for Halloween party.
5.0,"Muy cómodo, impermeable , protege del frío (nieve), excelente compra."
5.0,Favorite sunglasses I've ever owned!
5.0,Perfect! Just as the picture. Not a pair less nor a pair more or pair different than the ones shown on picture.
5.0,"This hat is everything everyone before me has written.  It is the perfect hat for me.  A little pricey, but so worth every penny."
5.0,I love this shirt is perfect good  quality<br />Follow me on Instagram @dee_benice ✌
5.0,Very nice band with magnetic buckle makes it strongly clipped and very easy to remove with one hand. Gives a more fashionable appearance when worn on your wrist.
5.0,Material is a good thickness and fit well.  I am 5'6&#34; and weigh 120 and got the medium.  They are loose in the waist so I probably should have gotten a small but it's not bad enough to exchange them.  They are cute.
5.0,Material is soft colors are bright. I ordered a size larger than I wear and it fits perfectly!
5.0,"Bought this this summer for the coming winter months.  I bought an XL to fit over bulky sweaters. It is lightweight and fuzzy in the best way possible. Will be a great benefit on the upcoming windy, snowy days. Very pleased with this purchase."
5.0,Was very happy with my purchase. Wear this so much
5.0,This bag is great. As described. Serves it's purpose
5.0,It’s a great way to have your current sobriety chip with you.  Easy to insert the chip and good looking/good quality manufacturing.  Highly recommend this product!

5.0,So cute and great Quilty !! Looks exactly like the picture
5.0,Great hats.  Good value.  Always get compliments when I wear them.  Also good for bad hair days.
5.0,This product is sized very well and my 5 year old loves it. It keeps her warm during these cold days and it's long enough to be worn as a dress with leggings. It's cute and super comfortable and I wish they had more designs of it :)
5.0,Very cute. I get compliments
5.0,"Got the eyeglass strap holders for my husband, and all I can say is that he loves them.  Best thing he has ever gotten."
5.0,"I typically wear a US size 6 (34-27-38); based on the provided sizing measurements, I ordered an XS.  It fit just right!  It's fitted comfortably at the bust and is very loose and flowy after.  I tried it on with a skinny belt at the waist and my boyfriend liked that look more, but both ways are super cute!  It is a pretty heavy fabric and there's a lot of it.  I will have to remember to not hang this by the straps to dry as I'm afraid that would stretch them out.  I live in a warm climate, so this dress can be worn year-round.  Can't beat an affordable, cute, and casual little black dress!"
5.0,Bought these for my husband. He is 6 foot 3 inches and they are a little short for his liking but he still loves them. Great color and great fit.
5.0,"This is beautiful, a very good quality. Couldnt be happier."
5.0,Para manejar en sentido contrario al sol y para la reflexión de todos los cristales de todos los carros muy buenas gafas
5.0,Comfortable & come fairly quick. Fair price as well.
5.0,Bought it for my daughter and she loves it.&#34;
5.0,These key chains are larger than I thought! Wonderful! Lol.<br />I thought they were the small ones that attach to a chain like charms. But they are regular sized key chains.... over an inch wide (give or take).<br />They arrived fairly quickly.
5.0,"Shipping was suuuuper quick! I was expecting this to be too big since I’m 4”11 and 100 lbs, but it fit perfect. Not too tight and not loose at all with a Small.<br /><br />It wasn’t see through so that was a plus, felt comfortably stretchy, and the material didn’t feel flimsy. Love!"
5.0,How comfortable they are. Colors are beautiful
5.0,A great product. Just what I was looking for!
5.0,"It's so cute! and looks great on! It's a little short. I'm 5'4 and weigh 130 lbs, i ordered a Large and i barely fit in it length wise. and the butt area is a little see-through. I didnt realize that it came with padding built into the bra area which is a huge plus!"
5.0,"I absolutely love this shirt.  It fits perfectly and is a really great quality shirt.  Not too thin, great collar, and I rep C-town proudly here in SoCal!!  Fits exactly as you would expect."
5.0,"These mini hoop earrings are so comfortable! I'm definitely getting more. We all lose earrings, and it's nice to have a comfy affordable pair in for the days you're doing outdoor activities and wanting to wear earrings but not risk losing your expensive pair!"
5.0,Great buy for the price; for the trendy at heart.<br />Purchased with a smile; can be worn on a night out with a sexy outfit or dressed down with a nice top jeans and heals.<br />You can't go wrong with this purchase.
5.0,I received so many compliments on this dress.  It's a unique size that can pull off a casual and business sexy look at the same time.  It hugs the curves and accentuates the breasts in a very classy way.  You can go wrong with this dress.
5.0,"My son loves this mask! It is stylish, starts conversations and is well made. It is not too thick so he can breathe easily. My daughter wants one now!"
5.0,My niece loves wolves.  This necklace is so adorable.  She opened it yesterday at a family Christmas gift exchange and loved it.  It is a little bolder than the necklace I got her last year and she loved it. Great purchase!
5.0,"Admirably gorgeous, elegantly beautiful both in the white and yellow colors."
5.0,Love them. Keep me warm and so cute!!
5.0,"For the price the value was great. Shipping was fast and paying minimally extra from this seller was worth it to have in time.  Perfect for the Derby, size was adequate, larger then a fascinator without the weight of a hat and the headband helped keep it in place without too much pressure. My dress was a light cream and the weight was a good match- slightly lighter in color but approate- not a true white."
5.0,"I bought these gloves to use for tough mudder, they worked great for that and now I use them around the house moving stuff or yard work. They do not seem affected at all by the abuse I have put them through."
5.0,"I love these gloves.  They are warm, you can use your fingers and then flip over the mitten too for total coverage to make snowballs.  Definitely would recommend."
5.0,Very pretty. It was smaller than I thought. I hope it lasts.

5.0,"The color is very pretty. However, I haven't worn them yet so, I can't comment on their comfort. Hopefully, they'll be comfortable for long term wear!"
5.0,I really like the look and feel of this replacement band. For the price it looks just as good as an Apple Watch band. I replaced the standard silicone straps on my TicWatch E. I like the way this band looks.
5.0,Good quality shirt bought as gift. Unsure of fit yet
5.0,My grandma loves it

5.0,Fits just right for the sequoia.
5.0,this sweater fits perfectly and feels amazing.
5.0,New favorite hat!
5.0,"The sunglasses always look better than the picture in real life, and hold up to wear and tear. I like them!"

5.0,The hats were a hit with our granddaughter!☺
5.0,Bought these as a replacement for my invicta subaqua 1384. Theyre not as soft as the original band but just as comfortable. Seem to be of decent quality. Happy with my purschase.
5.0,It appears to have all the items listed.  I think my daughter will like it
5.0,"I was not happy with the ""fabric label"" sewn into the hem of the scarf - it showed when worn and when I tried to remove it the stitching on the hem was compromised."
5.0,Beautiful! Well made. You will be noticed. Not for the faint of heart.I felt like I was going to a Royal Wedding.
5.0,Exactly what I wanted. Best description and fits great.
5.0,"I really like how comfortable this tunic is. It is very soft and lightweight and doesn't wrinkle easily. I ordered mine in a chocolate brown color and I really like the color. The color did not fade or bleed when I washed it. I did order mine in a size or two larger since that's what the other reviews were recommending, but I wish I wouldn't have. I think for me, my right size would have been the right size. I do really like the style of it and the comfort though, so for me it's ok for now. When I order again in another color, I will order the size I think I need. I received this tunic at a discounted price in exchange for my use of it and my honest review."
5.0,"Cute, comfortable, and way better than most cosplay costumes. Would recommend. I’m 4’11 and about 130 lbs.m for reference."

5.0,"My favorite glasses by far.  Unfortunately for me, this is the 3rd pair I've purchased because I've lost 2 of them in the lake. The positive is that they are so comfortable and the shade on them so nice that I forget I'm wearing them when I jump in the lake. Love them!"

5.0,very nice product fast service

5.0,I love this shirt. It fit as expected and love the pink
5.0,I just tried these out yesterday.  I am very pleased.  Great lens quality as far as cutting glare and keeping things sharp.  I always use polarized glasses and these fit the bill perfectly.  I am ordering another set for the other car.
5.0,"It's a nice shirt, just order one size up."
5.0,I love it. Very  happy.
5.0,Love these little earrings. I have very sensitive skin and they never bother me. I leave them in all the time.

5.0,Will add substantial length to your hair and thickness. I loved it.
5.0,"My sister and i bought this for our mother for a special birthday. In the area of Japan she is from, they wear red for the 88th birthday. The general description says red is for 60, but my sister knew what to get. I would recommend you verify the correct color for the person's celebration year as there are regional variances. Our mother was excited to get it, and was surprised we could find this in the US."
5.0,"FAST SHIPPING, VERY CUTE"
5.0,"This dress is beautiful. It is fattering to my figure. I felt beautiful wearing it and received a lot of compliments. I am 59 years old 5'8"" tall and weigh 135 lbs. I bought a Meduim 3/4 sleeve black dress and it was just right."
5.0,"Love it,especially the color"
5.0,Literally my favorite cozies! So soft and comfy. Got xl and was too big. Get true to size.
5.0,"I’m wearing the size small, it’s stretchy and soft. I love the print. Great for untuck or tucked, the length is perfect"
5.0,I love these. They are super comfy. Sadly my cat loved them too and chewed one of them to oblivion. Luckily they are affordable enough to replace. I'll just have to hide the new pair!
5.0,My oldest daghter loves them she wears them everywere. The product is of good quality especially for the price paid for the item. She loves the fact they look like she got her ears pierced (when in reality she didn't). She also loves the color and the design.
5.0,My daughter really likes them thank you
5.0,Love them :-)
5.0,Love this dress. Came back to buy another one in a different color. The slits on the side are too high for my liking. They hit just lower than my butt. I sewed them up to just around the knee and everything still looks good. The white is obviously see through but nothing a slip can’t fix. I was expecting that. I’m 5’9” and as pictured it looks like it is about floor length but on me it is about mid calf.
5.0,"I love this  dress. I wear a size 10 jeans and need a large in this dress. I have a full size butt and I almost could wear an XL..in this dress but it would be too big in other areas. I have to watch it as walking can cause the dress to raise a little. These are beautiful and comfortable dresses , I just got a big butt🤣🤣"
5.0,Super cute swim suit!!! Material is soft and stretchy and the straps are adjustable!!! My daughter is 6 and weighs about 51lbs and is about 3 feet 4 inches tall so I went with the size 8-9 years since I've read that this runs a little small and the bathing suit fits her great and will most likely fit her for the next 3 years or so!
5.0,The enamel stays on and doesn’t chip easily. Love it
5.0,"These are a super value, well made."
5.0,Dusty denim & camo with patriotic touch! Just sharp enough to dress up with & unique classic country style charm.
5.0,So adorable & functional!!!
5.0,Great fit. Lightweight and breathable.
5.0,I was a bit concerned when I purchased the headband that it would be too tight (I have a big head) or that the elastic would be itchy.  I was wrong--it was PERFECT.  And the ostrich feather detail was just beautiful.
5.0,Love this iwatch band. The colors are beautiful and it fits perfectly. It’s even better than the picture and description. I ordered another one in another color right away!
5.0,Great buy! I love the charm and it fits well with my other charms.
5.0,So great I got alot of complaints. I will be buying more from this store

5.0,i like these earrings
5.0,I'm very pleased with my purchase
5.0,"Love this phone case, fits my LG V20 phone perfect and is beautiful! I do wish the buttons for the sound on the side were a little more pliable, its hard to do a screen shot. But other than that great product and would recommend it!"
5.0,"even more beautiful in person.  Light weight, easy to wear."
5.0,"Got this for a Halloween costume, looks even prettier in person"
5.0,"This piece was above and beyond my expectations!  It is larger than depicted, which is what I was hoping for and very, very detailed.  Is has a nice weight to it as well.  I was delighted to see this great breed available in a peice of jewry that honors it intelligence and bravery.  Thank you!"
5.0,The skirt was perfect. Not to poofy or over the top. The only thing I will say is it is slightly see-through. So you cannot wear dark under garments. But it did not require a slip for me with the white shirt I was wearing.  I got a ton of compliments. I ordered a small and I am 5'4&#34; 125 pounds.
5.0,"Beautiful face shield. I ordered pink, the box says pink but it is clearly red."
5.0,"You can use these for whatever you want. They fit perfect. Go well with leggings, pajama shorts or boy shorts to lounge in and or as a crop top with jeans."

5.0,"I love the color contrasts on the Rascal Raccoon.  The deep black eyes and button nose against the Silver and the inlayed golden crystals on his head flowing into the gold on the back side of his head.  He also has black stripes on the back along with a tip of tail.  I can mix him with my other black or gold charms.  This is a very weighty charm and a &#34;Must Have&#34;,  So cute."
5.0,"Cute earrings. I can't say if the color will last because it is a new purchase. It also comes with a jewelry cloth, so hopefully if they tarnish that will correct it. They look just like they do online."
5.0,Very easy to change out.
5.0,Super cute & my 4 year old loves them! He wont take them off.
5.0,"Bought this for my grand daughter. She LOVES it and hates to take it off!  She’s ten, lol. Going to buy her another one so it can be laundered more often!"
5.0,Was very skeptical at first about buying anything that is what size fits all I have more of an athletic build so things have to fit over my thighs and butt. At first glance I thought Yup I made another mistake but girl once I actually put them on they were perfect. Trust me they will fit to your body
5.0,Best little wallet ever!! Makes my purse so much lighter. I was carrying a clutch type wallet. Very nice but heavy. This wallet will also work better in my smaller handbags. Enough room for everything I had in my other wallet. I will use this forever.
5.0,Excellent.  Works great.  Thanks.
5.0,So soft !
5.0,This is a great pair of pajamas. I wanted to up my loungewear game since I’ve been at home so much and these are perfect. They are so soft and comfortable to lounge in and sleep in. I bought a size medium and they fit me perfectly.
5.0,"Wow, this jacket is great for hanging out at home.  We keep our bedroom cool for sleep, and it really comes in handy for just something to put over your arms and shoulders. Saw something like this on TV, and didn't want to pay $90. for it. Glad I found one on Amazon just like the $90 one. Great buy, nice and fluffy soft warm. Size is true. Would buy it again without hesitation."
5.0,"I have a hard time buying sunglasses, mostly because I struggle trying to find a pair that looks good on my face and will actually block out the sun. I found these bad boys and wanted to give them a try since 1) I love pink, 2) cat eye glasses tend to look the best on me, 3) the last pair I bought weren't that great at blocking out the sun.<br /><br />These look great on my face and are INVALUABLE in blocking out the sun, especially during dawn and dusk. I live in an area that has lots of hills, mountains, and trees, so the sun can pop out of nowhere and fry your retinas pretty quickly, so having a good pair of sunglasses are definitely a necessity. They're really comfortable on my face, too. I have a wider face, so I was a little concerned that it would squish me, but I was pleasantly surprised. I absolutely recommend these!"
5.0,"Wife loved them, perfect size and look great. Happy wife!"
5.0,"This exceed my expectations! I love the bracelet, I have had compliments on it already and I just put it on 10 minutes after I got it (it was mailed to my work). Co-workers even commented that it they didn't know any better they would think that I got it from Brighton. I highly recommend!"
5.0,"I bought these for my grandson and they r wonderful the colors r bright , fit extremely well and they look great in him, would definitely buy these again"
5.0,"they leave bits of fuzz EVERYWHERE. I sat on the side of my bed, and my sheets are covered in fuzz. My bathroom rugs are covered in fuzz. But, guess what...I'm wearing the pants right now as I type this review. They are THAT comfy."
5.0,Love these shoes!!! I wear them for work.They are so incredibly comfortable!!
5.0,"For reference, I am 35 years old, 5'7"", size 10/12 bottom, M top, 34D bra. The medium fit perfectly. The quality and fit is spot on and what I have come to expect from this brand. Reasonably priced and as good or better than other brands!"
5.0,"I bought this dress as a back up for a wedding because I wasn't happy with my first choice.  I loved this dress- it was so inexpensive I didn't expect to like it as much as I did.  I got several compliments on it, and was so comfortable all through the day, and dancing into the night."
5.0,Love it. fits perfect.
5.0,"I was very hesitant to order thus dress because the price was so low and I didn't expect much from it. Based on the reviews, I took a chance on it. It's amazing!! Yes, it's not the quality of a $300 dress. So, it may not last as long as others that I own. However, it's extremely figure flattering and comfortable. It's very important to follow the company's size charts. I am 5'7&#34; and a curvy size 12 or L in Anne Klein, Calvin Klein, and Lauren dresses. I ordered this in the  XXL which is their size 12. The tag reads as such. It's a perfect fit. I may have been able to go down a size, but it would have been tight. The color blocking hides and figure flaws. I wish it was available in more colors. It's truly a steal."
5.0,"I have had this for a few months. Its perfect for shoes, small towell and water bottle. The extra pockets are perfect for my keys and wallet. I use it for my Spin class. It’s worked out great. Just the right size."
5.0,This dress is perfect. I'm 5 ft 6 inches tall and weigh 158 and the fit of the size Large couldn't be better. Very happy with the great and fast service.
5.0,"This mask is beautiful!! Comfortable, like that it’s has a insert for the filter. I get a lot of complements on this mask."
5.0,Love this jacket. So comfy and good quality! Highly recommend it

5.0,"Great, thanks! Love these."
5.0,"Bought this as a teacher gift along with a &#34;thank you for helping me grow&#34; note. Big hit. She loved it... and it's great quality, nice and big."
5.0,ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!!!!! GORGEOUS WITH MY FLORAL TUBE MAXI DRESS I'M SO IN LOVE
5.0,"Very nice look, make and style."
5.0,I love this item. It is lovely in person
5.0,"Works perfectly, why did I wait so long to buy."
5.0,Feel good bracelet
5.0,Easy and confortable
5.0,You get what you pay for material wise .. but it looks super cute on just as it’s pictured.. I’m a 32 dd and the small fits without smothering my boobs so it’s worth the five stars for that alone
5.0,I Love my night gown..I have ordered 3.  So easy to throw in the washer and fits great and affordable..I may order a couple more...very well made.
5.0,Absolutely love this dress.  Fits perfectly and great quality.  I am 120lbs in weight and 5ft 2inches tall.  I ordered the medium in size.

5.0,"When i took it out of the pack I wasn't quite sure of about the top. But after trying them on, it was really a nice fit and very flattering to my shape."
5.0,"its very nice material, nice design. but I order the XL and it was to tight. I gave it to my 17 year son. then i order an XXL and still fits super tight. and that is the biggest size.  I gave that one to my other son that is 20. I have a 44 chest and 30 waist.185pds. I dont have a belly and i work out. so measure yourself before buying. the material does not expand much.It comes from china so it takes about a month to get it. Nice shirt again but it only fits skinny people. not bodybuilders."
5.0,she loved it for her birthday...she has always loved new moons
5.0,"I searched online for some accessories for my Halloween costume, these didn't have any reviews but I decided to give them a chance anyway. They are foam based, but a good thickness of foam, with straps that have velcro sewn on them so they can fit different sized wrists/heads. They fit nicely and I feel like are great quality to wear for Halloween or a fun cosplay."
5.0,"Cute, soft and, sturdy!"
5.0,very pleased with the look of this dress. very chic and versatile! highly recommend for business or black attire events
5.0,"I've only worn this once, but I'm very pleased. It's leather. It's easy to adjust to any precise size since you don't use holes. It's very unique."
5.0,Everything was how I expect!
5.0,Well made. 9 Roomy pockets-enough for a clip pocket knife and my hand to fit. Seem to be tough but not so thick as to be too hot in the summer. Very good deal for the price.
5.0,Ordered this costume for 6th grade boy to wear during a talent show skit.  It came on time and as expected.  Fits him with lots of room to grow.  You add batteries to a little fan that hooks inside the costume so it inflates.  So far it has stayed inflated whenever he’s used the costume.  We are happy with the purchase.
5.0,"Sunglasses were exactly as pictured, and the service was prompt."
5.0,Love it perfect color that I want!<br />Thanks Amazon.
5.0,"This gorgeous and colorful scarf is soft, good quality silk. I am quite happy with this purchase. I'm going to search this seller for larger rectangular scarves because they just are easier to style. I like to wear scarves most of the time so my collection grows and this is a nice addition."
5.0,This is a great shirt love it!!! Fits perfect
5.0,Ok. As expected!
5.0,Perfect size to clip on to your keys or handbag!<br /><br />It goes well with my work bag and can vwra filed with whatever sanitizer though prefer.
5.0,"these socks surprised us. we got black to go with his kilt  and boots. reading the amazon ad made me think that these socks would be a relatively thick absorbent cotton sock suitable for boots and tennis shoes. when we got them we were disappointed to find that they felt very thin, like dress socks. he put them on and went to do some handy man work for an old friend. after 8 hours of working, running around after dogs, carting boxes, pulling items from the back of storage and repacking his feet get super sweaty they were still comfortable even all sweaty and when he pulled them off to dry a bit before heading home they dried from completely soaked in about 30 minutes, that was impressive and when he put them back on he was super pleased to find that unlike his other cotton socks these werent all stiff crinkly and crunchy which was another in a nice line of experience with these socks he said his feet felt really good even though the insoles we'd just gotten him hurt his feet and he had no insoles in his shoes. and he just keeps saying how very comfortable they are which makes me very happy.  well done RioRiva! i'm glad that i had the chance to get these great socks at a discount in return for taking the time to come here and leave an honest review. you can go to my page to check the honesty of my reviews and be assured that if the product does not deserve a high rating it will not get one from me, and if i give a high rating and the longevity of the product does not live up to that rating, i will change that rating and update the review to show these changes. i hope that my reviews are helpful, if so please let me and amazon know by clicking or tapping yes when prompted."
5.0,"Adorable jacket, easily embroidered for customization"
5.0,"Absolutely love it! It's long enough to where I don't have to bend down to pass my badge through the security box, and it's very cute and stylish."
5.0,Love the dress.fit very nice.it feels good on my body.geometric is cute.. this is a 2x
5.0,Excellent assistive device to get shoes on when you cant reach your feet. It has given me the opportunity to wear my sneakers again which have better support than the slde into shoes that i have been wearing.
5.0,"It is a really good product! I love it so much!<br /><br />Really good protect for my iphone, and when you touch it, you will love it!"
5.0,Came in great little packaging. Looked great dangling.
5.0,"Best belt ever! Comfortable, elegant, and stylish."
5.0,"Perfect, ive had before and finally found them again"
5.0,We don't use these for zippers but instead put them on my fourteen month old's diaper bag but pushing then through the straps (it's a 31 bag) we wanted people to be ableto see them but don't want the baby playing with them. Worked great! At the very least it starts the conversation and helps people take you seriously.
5.0,Very flattering and I feel like it's a much-needed tank in your arsenal. Super cute but isn't super tight in any area so you won't feel insecure.
5.0,Nice and snug like momma likes them.
5.0,"Quick delivery, and right the first time, unlike other vendors who can't tell light grey from black. Perfect fit, nice packaging and extra pins that I wasn't expecting. I will likely be back for more. 😁"
5.0,"Comfy! Stay put! Light! No ride! Bought a pkg at Costco to try, loved them so much I ordered 2 more off of Amazon! I have a large butt, so it's almost impossible to find panties that don't move or go up my butt! Lol! Love love love these!"

5.0,"This is a nice coat, I got to wear it one day after receiving it in a winter downpour. The temp was 35  degrees F and with the lining I was very comfortable, not cold or sweating. I have always like the Aussie style coats but oiled canvas ones are just too heavy for this 76 year old."
5.0,"They are pretty cool and cute sunglasses with good price.  I don't like too dark color, this one could meet my request."
5.0,We all love a good dupe right? These are so cute. I got so many compliments. I wore than doing the day and inside a club fits both environments lol

5.0,"I love this mask so much I have 2 of them. Not only does it look cool, it has filters, so that's a plus. Thicker than the standard cloth mask, I feel way more confident about being out when using this mask versus some other ones. The nose area conforms to fit tight thus keeping my glasses from getting as fogged up, so that's a big win for me."
5.0,It's just beautiful. I've gotten many compliments already. Great value.
5.0,These are very pretty and the perfect size.  They are not too big and not too small.
5.0,"Wife loves it, nice snug but not too tight dress."

5.0,"This was a bonus gift, if you will, having received a coupon after ordering a different item from this company. A wonderful add-on to my ever-growning elephant jewelry collection. The hand-carving is simple but very easy to spot what the charm is supposed to be."
5.0,It's looks good and comfortable to wear.  No trouble putting it on my Fitbit.  Just make sure you buy the correct one.

5.0,"I have only worn it 5 hours but the comfort is like any other ring. It is exactly as pictured in the description. The fit is perfect, so go with whatever your normal size is.<br />Can not speak to tarnishing or greenfingers yet, but it looks lovely on the hand! I will update this if any issues occur."
5.0,Great fabric and super cute! I am about 5'4 and it hits a bit above my knee so perfect lengths for me. Love it!
5.0,"These earrings are so light and comfortable, I had to check to be sure I hadn't lost them.  This is the second pair of earrings from the Clip Earring Shop I've bought and they are the most comfortable earrings ever.  I am definitely going to purchase more."

5.0,Super comfy and my cell phone fits perfectly when I’m moving around!
5.0,I get so many compliments. The fabrication is 100% nylon. Thin but not see thru. I wore this top so much this summer dressed up or down. This top has a nice tie detail on both sides. You can loosen or tighten it up if you want more of a cinched hour glass waist.
5.0,The bras are so beautiful. The front lace gives off a sexy look . The bras color so pretty. The fit is wonderful. I am full figure. I wear a 40d I recommend this product. I will order again

5.0,Ordered this for my 20 year old son's apartment and he loves it. It's funny and youthful without being childish.
5.0,"Great comfortable pants that aren't see through. The size is perfect and the material is a great bright white linen! Wish they came in more colors, I would buy them all!"
5.0,"I love this bag. It is very well made and can hold a ton of stuff. It's truly a &#34;weekender&#34; in the sense that I can get an entire weekend worth of clothes and essentials in it. Yet, I can still fit it under the seat in front of me on a plane. I actually used it for a recent vacation with a small roller that I put in the overhead compartment and also used this as my &#34;carry on.&#34; It's a tad big for that, but if it's not completely full it works well. The bag is also very sturdy since the bottom is reinforced. I would definitely purchase another one."
5.0,now my wife can drive at night
5.0,"This is very comfortable and lightweight, and looks great even after you wash it!  It’s nice to have the breathable material in the heat!!!"
5.0,"I am 5’10, pants size 17 and curvy. I was very skeptical about this purchased, because some clothes run small from overseas merchandiser’s. I order a 2xl to play it safe because material is not stretchy. Ladies, BUY IT!!!! Lol It was perfect with my birthday outfit. I can be sexy and keep it classy. I had a cute white blazer and white bra to cover my nipples plus some cute skinny jeans. I receive so many compliments."
5.0,"My sons play this game where one is Thanos and he snaps the other’s meal away during dinner. So, how could I resist this as a gift. The quality is really good. It’s soft and flexible. The stones light up. The details is really good. It’s just cool."

5.0,"Definitely love this dress, the length was longer than expected but I'm 5'1&#34; so nothing some high heels won't fix. :)"
5.0,My girlfriend loved it for couple reasons. She loved it because it fitted perfectly fine.

5.0,Husband needed shorts orders two pairs fits great.
5.0,These fit perfect. I’m pleased with my purchase.

5.0,This shirt is a favorite of my husbands. So much so he basked me to buy the other colors for Christmas. Breathable yet warm without being too bulky.

5.0,"A nice durable well made strap that leaves ample room to be tucked in when put around my six and three-quarter inch wrist. The buckles are smooth and well finished and sewed in, not glued.

5.0,Super comfortable and easy to dress up or down
5.0,"these were a perfect slipper for me to wear after recent surgery.  The bottom is pretty sturdy and inflexible which is what I needed to scoot around the house and ""drag"" my non weight bearing foot.  now wearing after surgery and still like.  toweling means you can simply wash them when needed,"
5.0,This tunic dress is so comfy and beautiful at a great price. I will be buying more in the future.
5.0,Adorable! looks cute on the bureau.
5.0,"It is fitted around the waist and is pretty big at the top but I think that is the look they are going for. I liked it a lot. Received lots of compliments. Not a sweater, ribbed like a beater undershirt, but a nicer, heavier material."
5.0,"Great little swimsuit and very flattering. One of the buttons did pop off while I was trying it on, but easy enough to sew it back on. Would definitely recommend."
5.0,Excellent quality mask. Was easy to paint and had a cushion for your  forehead

5.0,Three Thumbs Up !<br />It is a really nice bow tie.
5.0,"Works great for costume and stayed on well! I was worried about then not staying on my ears well, but they did just fine! Not irritating either."
5.0,Super cute key chain. Perfect size. Must have for any Office fan.
5.0,I am normally a 32J so I ordered a 70J and hot dang does this bra fit perfectly! I ordered one from panache and it was super tight and I had to wash it and wear it a lot before it got comfy but this is now my favorite bra. So soft and comfortable 10/10 I am recommending to all my fellow busty friends. I was worried that it might not fit perfectly but it’s so comfy and keeps everything in place. Love it!
5.0,They fit size 8 wide and do not fall off!
5.0,"I LOVE this dress. I wear a size 16W, and the sizing chart was right on. The length was perfect for me (I hate how every dress is above the knee), and the cut was really complementary on my plus sized frame. The fabric felt great too and was nice and billowy. Just loved everything about this dress."
5.0,Loved these they are perfect in every way
5.0,"Nice colors.  Modest, comfortable style and design."
5.0,"These came as a free offer with another pair that I ordered. Funny thing is, I like these even better than the pair I ordered! Packaged nicely as well with a hard and soft case. Great job on these glasses and to the seller."
5.0,"I am 5'5&quot; and generally wear a size 10, so I purchased the medium.  The skirt did fit, though it is very form fitting, so I would probably order the large next time.  (I'm a bit more conservative so that is really my preference.) Length was good, and I could easily wear heels with it.  It is very comfortable to wear as well.  The color and design are well represented in the picture (yellow flower), and I'm very happy with it.  I just need to figure out the right top to go with it given my belly doesn't look anything like the model pictured. :-)  I like that it provides a very feminine silhouette while not being showy.  I do expect that I'll pick up at least 1 other design of this skirt in the near future."
5.0,"Fits good, very comfortable"
5.0,Great clock for young kids! Lights up well.
5.0,Bought these for my grandson and he totally loved them!

5.0,"Cute dress.  Nice material.  Order larger than usual and it was a little too tight, but, wearable."

5.0,Stays up without sliding down when I walk like 2 other brands I bought. Paid more for this than another brand but it is worth it. This is of higher quality and more firm.
5.0,These are what I feel I needed. They are warm but do not make my feet too hot under my bedding.
5.0,Great gift quality made
5.0,It is a comfortable shirt. the shirt has a round neck to it. The picture shows the lady wearing a necklace so it is more simplistic but has some style to it. the color is pretty close to the picture also. the cuffs on the sleeves are a little snug but everything else fits as expected. It does have some room in the top if you need a little extra room. It is a three quarter sleeve on me.  I am happy with the purchase. the product for free or at a discount.
5.0,"These are a fun style. They are wide enough for my face to be comfortable and are lightweight so that don't slide down. The lenses are clear and not too dark. These are used primarily for driving so I can't comment about wearing them outdoors. For driving, they have been great for our southwest sunshine."
5.0,ABSOLUTELY LOVE!!!!!
5.0,This wallet is awesome.  There is a place for everything and even has a see through part for your ID cards.  There are two money compartments so you can keep your larger bills in one area and smaller in the other.  Lets you have an idea of how much money you have at a glance.  I love them so much that I got one for my Son for Christmas.

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:3b81d77a5087928cc97a3ba1183ab67a]] I'm 5'3 and 120 lbs. I bought S. It looks good on me. True to size and good quality. The fabric is soft. If you want an oversize style just one size up. The only fly in the ointment is that the sleeves are a little short for me. Overall, I love it."
5.0,This material is super soft n comfy. I would buy again.
5.0,The statement on this sweatshirt just cracks me up every time I see it.  Husband found it humorous too--and 20 year-old son particularly liked it!  Great quality.  Delivery was exactly as expected.

5.0,Loved the color and quality if the shirt
5.0,"These are absolutely beautiful! The material is not stretchy, however the elastic waist is. Sheer, with sewn in shorts to cover my bits.  Definitely something that I could wear to work, a nice dinner, or dressed down with a shirt for social engagements."
5.0,"I purchased two sets of these earrings and I am so pleased with them. They are very small and dainty, so very nice. I wrapped one as a Christmas gift, and kept one set for myself. Very worth the purchase. I must stress that these earrings are very small and dainty."

I want to order all the colors for other events I have coming up!  I washed on the handwash cycle of my washer and hung to dry and it held up great!
5.0,I love these! I hate actual slippers. Not sure why but they just don't suit me. These have the grips on the bottom and are cozy. However they run big. They end up being slouchy socks on me and don't stay up like pictured and I have big calves. I love them though.
5.0,It’s pretty but mine is crooked. Still wear it tho.

5.0,I'm a little worried about the string but it can always be replaced. I absolutely love it
5.0,"Super comfy leggings! They feel just like another, more expensive popular brand. I already have two pairs and plan on buying more."
5.0,"I, as the mother, like the leggings for the versatility they offer. My daughter loved them for their confort. They run a little larger, but this is preferable as I want her to be able to grow into them (vs. out of them) over the course of the school year."
5.0,"Finally, clip on sunglasses with some class! Even my young daughter has bought a pair of what she previously deemed to be a very dorky item."
5.0,"I love the shape, color and lightness of this bag. The adjustable strap is great."

5.0,"Well made, good deep colors. Excellent, embroidery with no loose or broken threads. Overall very sharp looking."
5.0,"These socks are super soft and the quality is amazing! I am a 6 1/2 shoe size and they fit perfect - I can't stand when there is extra room at the toe or heel and that's not a problem with these! The toe seam is smooth and there are no bumps on the edges that are sometimes uncomfortable on other socks. The band at the top holds them up well, and the thickness is just enough to be quality and plush and keep my feet warm, but not so thick that my feet can't breathe. Love them!"
5.0,Warm as anything! Great for skiing in Wisconsin!
5.0,I love these items. Different choices and they are easy to put on. Thank you.

5.0,I can't tell you how many times I have to give my reading glasses to my husband when we go out or are in the house and he doesn't want to get his out of the bedroom!! These are perfect for the both of us. The color is flattering on both of us.<br />they are very comfortable. The price is amazing and I will be buying more!
5.0,Everything was perfect a perfect size and color
5.0,Super cute keychains! I bought them as a gift for my friend but I just had to take one for myself they are adorable
5.0,"These are one of those little things in life you don’t give much thought to that you really need. Everyone could use a set of these. It is pretty safe to say just about everyone has some type of glasses. Sunglasses, reading glasses, prescription glasses or safety glasses.<br /><br />I don’t wear prescription glasses but I can say since I picked these up I have been a lot better at wearing safety glasses in my home shop. Simply put the safety glasses in the pouch and hang them near your work area, or stuff your sunglasses in one and put in glove box and not worry about them getting scratched up.<br /><br />Once you start protecting whichever type of glasses you have you will most likely start using them more since they will be in better shape. You can also use the microfiber to clean them. The pack comes with enough that you can share.<br /><br />So protect the glasses that protect your eyes."

5.0,"love love love these booties! they look more expensive than my other really expensive pair. they are well made, super light and comfy. Rubber sole is a plus!"
5.0,"The bottle is a nice, compact size and easy to apply.  I used them on ski goggles and they kept my field of view clear.  I didn't see a need to reapply.  I can't think of a downside to this product.  I can't comment on its effectiveness on eyeglasses because I wear contact lenses.  But overall I am happy with the product and I liked the small compact nature of the bottle."
5.0,Love the pockets and mesh sides

Usually, anywhere from 6 to 8 miles a day.  And I know first hand how critically important it is to have on a decent pair of socks … they have to be think enough to provide good cushion, they have to be smooth and comfortable to wear, they have to fit well and they have to keep your feet both cool and dry.<br /><br />A 7 plus miles walk earlier today showed that the ‘Forcool Merino Wool Socks’ come out with marks in every one of those categories.<br /><br />After the end of my walk, my feet felt fine.  No hotspots, no spots where blisters might form … both feet were both cool and comfortable.  Very nice.<br /><br />I normally wear around a size 7 in shoes and the size medium socks I received are a perfect fit.  It is so nice to be able to wear a pair of socks that actually fit correctly and not have to settle for a sock that will fit anywhere from a size 6 to a size 12.  Kudos to Forcool for not putting out a ‘one-size-fits-all’ type sock since those type socks never fit anyone really well.<br /><br />There are numerous spots on the socks (highlighted in orange circles on the pair I have) where extra cushion has been added to the socks.  The areas include the skin, above the heel and on the bottom of the sock on the bottom of the foot and near the arch of the foot.  This extra cushion, especially in those areas where your socks will really press against your shoes/boots, is a really nice extra to have in order to ensure the socks are comfortable to wear.<br /><br />These socks come up almost to my knees but, of course, depending on your legs they might not come up as high but they should, at least come up to your mid-calf if not higher.  They are the just-right tightness around my calves so they stay firmly in place without being so tight they are uncomfortable.<br /><br />The ‘Forcool’ socks are thick; easily thicker than dress socks and thicker that most other walking socks on the market.  No need to double-up with these socks.  They might not be quite as thick as some higher-end hiking socks I’ve used in the past but they are more than thick enough to be comfortable.<br /><br />Bottom line …. These are really nice socks that are worth your consideration."
5.0,I got these for my sister and these are gorgeous! She’s told me she gets lots of compliments all the time. They feel sturdy and look a lot more expensive than they are.
5.0,I've been asked if they're raybans! These rock!
5.0,They look really cool.
5.0,"I am extremely happy with my dress! The shop contacted me before shipping to confirm measurements and mine were a little off, so they made it to fit and it arrived super quickly! I love the dress and I cannot wait to wear it!"
5.0,Like this cloth very much but you should offer more than one cloth per package.
5.0,Thank you so much. A+ service - quick delivery and perfect item.
5.0,Beautifully finished and heavy pendant. Very good quality. This is the second one I've bought - one for my daughter and one for myself.
5.0,Great belt and good quality
5.0,Super cute “first backpack”. Nice and lightweight for a toddler to carry.
5.0,"It barely covers my butt! It's cute and fits everywhere else but it's too short in length. I ordered an xl and I'm a medium top and a 29"" waist. If o had ordered a medium it wouldnt fit."
5.0,Cute top. I purchased for a friend. She’s about 5’3” maybe 158lb. I got her a large and it fit well. Long enough for tights but looks cute with her skinny jeans.
5.0,Adjustable & fit really well.  My daughter & I loved them
5.0,"I've had this dress for a few months, washed it several times and still love it! I try to hang dry it but I slipped up and put in the dryer once or twice. It did shrink some, but it's still comfortable just not as flattering around my middle. I usually wear an 8 or a 10 in dress size and got the medium. I have a distinctive belly that I'm trying to hide and I might get the large next time for that. The pockets are great, they hold my samsung galaxy S6 with the case on, no problem. All in all a super comfortable, useful dress that I mostly wear around the house on hot days :)"
5.0,"Fits somewhat small...if you have a big head on your shoulders, this hat is not for you."
5.0,Perfect for my son's wedding.  Beautiful and elegant.
5.0,The metal does scratch rather easily. The links are large. For my wrist it was either too tight or too loose on me. The links are easy to change. It came with a handy tool to change them out. It’s heavy and study though which I do appreciate
5.0,Perfect lapel pin for family's very Irish wedding. So glad there were three so my sons and husband matched.
5.0,Beautiful and good fabric quality. I bought two sizes up after reading the reviews and it went very well.
5.0,"They do work, cuts down the glare, but you need to tone down your Advertising video, they don't do that."
5.0,Bought this as a surprise for my daughter.  I introduced her to Dr. Who in the 1980's but she did not become a fan the new BBC America series hit the air.
5.0,It matches everything that is said in description
5.0,Good quality and great value $$$
5.0,I really like the way this tank fits and flows. It is lined and so is not see through. It did have quite prominate crease marks in it from shipping that did not come out with first wash but have since relaxed. It seems to be good quality and I would buy more colors if available.
5.0,"I ordered  larger than my regular size for fear of the Chinese size so it is large, but apart from that is a really nice dress. Very comfy and great for the summer time."
5.0,Just like the picture. Love this dress
5.0,Shipping was very fast! Pin looks exactly like it does in the picture!
5.0,Smoking hot material is polyester gives a little stretch but holds the girls in.  Probably not going to work for larger breastfed women without a few stitches.
5.0,So far so good. I haven't used them for extended periods of time yet but they seem to do what I need them to do.
5.0,I love this cardigan. Bought it in 3 colors!! I’m 5’7 and 125lbs. The small fits perfectly. Looks great open and buttoned. Will probably buy in black next. It’s super soft!
5.0,Perfect and it is fine the product.
5.0,This item was great will buy again
5.0,Love the band.  I actually needed a small but I could not find one from prime members at this great price. The large still fits comfortably. I definitely recommend this product. I also bought the red.
5.0,This ring was really pretty in the beginning but it started to turn my finger green.
5.0,Exactly what my wife was looking for.
5.0,This shirt fits very well.  I have a full hour glass figure and I think it accentuates my curves in all the right places.
5.0,Dress fits to size. Good material. Happy with it.
5.0,my wife loved them a lot thank you
5.0,"I love this bathing suit. It covers everything without looking too covered. I got it in the small and was a bit worried since Asian sizes are smaller than American. I am 5'3&#34;, 110lbs, 30B, 32/24/34. It fit really well everywhere which I was very happy with. A bit roomy in the chest but not noticeable and it strained a bit to get the thing on and over my butt since it's a one piece and it has to be pulled up. I'll have to be careful putting and taking it off so it doesn't rip or stretch too much as my butt should probably be in a medium but that size wouldn't fit anywhere else.<br /><br />The straps also are detachable but I wouldn't be able to hold it up without them, but it gives multiple strap options.<br /><br />I am very very happy and only spent $8, but it looks like the $30 or $40 ones."
5.0,I am very happy with purchase.
5.0,These shoes fit as other vionic shoes fit.
5.0,seems nice and warm have not used it yet
5.0,Length to ankle. I love it!!!
5.0,Nice lightweight surgical cap with buttons. I wear with two level three masks and an op-d- op face shield. My ears are very happy with this cap.
5.0,"I love it! Perfect for traveling (which is why I bought it), but also for when I don’t need all the usual ‘junk’ I carry in my everyday purse. I bought purple and I think I’ll get another one in a different color. Love it!"
5.0,These are beautiful fit good look just like the picture
5.0,"These exceeded my expectations.  I liked them so much that I will be ordering a couple more in different colors, and I'm returning a pair of Briggs I ordered from another vendor here on Amazon.  I'm 5'4&#34; and weigh 135 lbs. and ordered a size 8.  They fit perfectly. The material is not too thin.  I can wear them with 1.5 inch heels and above--a little long for flats."
5.0,"You put it on like a pin (for some reason I though it was made with clips to clip onto the clothes). It definitely adds a hint of beauty, turning a cardigan easily into an item of compliments. So many of my coworkers loved it and stopped me to ask where I got it from."
5.0,Got this for my husband for his birthday and we both love it. Subtle but with a little trendy pop of color.
5.0,Love these  nose rings.
5.0,I like iit..Wear it all the time. Quality plus..worth the money..
5.0,"Very cute! The fit is great, very soft."
5.0,I love my AKA necklace. Perfect gift for any member.
5.0,Good quality and look good
5.0,Purchased this as a gender reveal for grandma. She loved it!
5.0,Very comfortable.  Best runnings shorts I have ever bought.  Will be buying more.
5.0,"Look cool and they fit perfect. Also, they are pretty durable."
5.0,"This dress is amazing for the price, there weren’t any reviews so I thought I’d leave one. No, it doesn’t come four sizes too small. It’s also not a thin material. It’s perfect and definitely a good buy. Long enough to be classy but the neckline is sexy, great for large breasted women! It will cling to all your midsection imperfections but I plan on wearing this with a corset or a body shaper."
5.0,User friendly
5.0,Loved these for my daughter they are identical to my Tom’s adult vs of this shoe!
5.0,We love this! It’s been used for our two year old since she was around 8 months old.
5.0,"I love the bikini, fits perfect."
5.0,"The actual color is much lighter than what’s on the app, but I do like it, worth the money, just that maybe a smaller size would have fitted me more."
5.0,Such a beautiful and flattering scarf! The stitches came out but the seller offered to replace it! Wonderful customer service!
5.0,This is the first WWE shirt that I got out of many that the fabric actually feels great not as rough as usual.<br />Hopefully this an upgrade that they are sticking with.
5.0,Somewhat flimsy but are more then worth the bargain
5.0,Nice material<br />Serve its purpose well<br />Roomy enough
5.0,Love this swimsuit...if they had a variety of colors I would buy again.
5.0,"Arrived quickly, packaging not damaged. Really pretty earrings, especially for the low price."
5.0,"My son loves these. I ordered down one size as suggested by some reviews, but they're a little short on him. I will order another set that is true to size for him."
5.0,We sing at church.  That's why we needed the masks.
5.0,These heart earrings are very beautiful!  I am very happy with them.  You should buy them.
5.0,work great for feeding & watering the ducks & chicken
5.0,"This is exactly what I wanted for halloween. I chose the “Boy” option because the adult pair would have been very, very large on my hands. I personally like the 8” pair I got, and I would recommend that for most. They seem to be durable and we’re packaged very securely in bubble rap and then in a tight compact box. 10/10!"
5.0,"Great dress. It’s just like the photos and product description. I received many compliments. Oh, and IT HAS POCKETS!!"
5.0,"Cool shades, they also were very good quality for the price I paid."
5.0,"Soft, cozy, fits well. Exactly what I needed for my caveman nightclub costume."
5.0,"LOVE this top. Super sexy but simple. It was too small for me, but didn't want to return it, so I gave it to a friend. She loves it too"
5.0,"These glasses fit perfectly, the medium size is a perfect fit I couldn't decide if I would need large but decided with a medium which was a really good pick highly recommend for cosplays or cute outfits. Only problem I have is the cleaning but it's easy to solve with just water."
5.0,It’s a warm hat. Music is a major bonus!!
5.0,"This kimono is lightweight, and great coverage for those who are uncomfortable wearing just a tank top (hides upper arm flab). I bought 2, and love them."
5.0,"This dress is very comfortable. The material has a breathable quality to it, with a nice fit, and feel. Light and flouncy movement to the material. The orange color has a perfect summer to fall aesthetic and has garnered many compliments during outings!"
5.0,These are absolutely adorable!! Made perfectly for that best friend that has been in your life for umpteen years!!
5.0,"I love these for day time and while driving! Everything looks like ""golden hour"" and they cut the harsh glare of the LA sun."
5.0,Cute.  Good for the price.  Get what you paid for.
5.0,Loved the dress. Wore it to my nieces wedding. Got lots of complaments on the dress.
5.0,Titanium key chains are light and very strong. You cannot go wrong. They look nice too! Great product and great price.
5.0,Good lip ring need to order more
5.0,"Very nice suit, well made and soft, luxurious feel. Will last my son a year at least and hopefully will purchase more like this in other colors."
5.0,"Very comfy, lightweight, pjs. Really like the pockets on bottom front!"
5.0,Works Great and it payed for itself with my winnings. I have three of these that I carry around with me inside of a phanny pack under my shirt with my vape supplies.<br />Thanks.
5.0,"I got it during a deal and consider it a favorite purchase. The colors are so vibrant and the cut is flattering, plus pockets!! Hoping it washes well over time because I love how comfortable it is while looking so nice."
5.0,"These dresses are beautiful!!!! I wear an 18 unfortunately 😢 and the XXLG was the perfect fit. They aren’t the most flattering on my belly though which I prefer to hide. The material is very smooth. So I either need to suck it in while walking around or just lose weight like I want to do. If I let it all hang out, I look pregnant so I could just go with that....😂.  Anyways, if you are thin or pregnant, you will LOVE it and look AMAZING! I’m not either of those things and still love it. I got the floral styles, both Navy backgrounds by the way, but one is the light pink top and the other the greenish (more like baby blue) top. They both come to my ankles and I’m 5’9”. I’m debating whether to just return them and buckling down to lose weight, then reordering in a smaller size when the time comes or just hang onto them. My fat problems aren’t the dresses fault though. They are beautiful!"
5.0,The quality was good and my granddaughter really loved the necklace.
5.0,"Well made, lovely belt."
5.0,Had an issue with the first one because cars wouldn't come out easily. Contacted seller and they were amazing about sending out another. My Mom loves it! Perfect gift 😍
5.0,"Nice Holiday item for my wife.  Great looking and very well made for the price.  It has some weight to it and appears quite durable.  I give it a full five stars, as I think you are getting such a nice item for the price."
5.0,Very satisfied and excellent packaging. Would definitely buy again. Already have one buying second one
5.0,"Neckline is too tight, fabric is thick and absolutely beautiful My daughter love it."
5.0,My husband has a lot of trouble with walking too much because of a bad lower back. The moment he put these shoes on they were like&quot;walking on a cloud!&quot; I am thrilled with these shoes. (And they look really cool!)
5.0,This product is great but with one flaw I'm an older woman and my breasts aren't perkie so I needed to take a little off the top  cup near the chest area otherwise it's great it works well with the underarm piece
5.0,So comfortable! Highly recommend buying
5.0,The product was as described and arrived quickly.
5.0,Love it and the fit
5.0,I got so many compliments on this dress! LOVED the way it fit and felt!
5.0,"This material looks like a cotton shirt but it doesn't shrink and it wears very cool. The printing is nice and crisp. I really like these types of shirts because they don't shrink. It wears a bit big on me, I wear an XL typically and could probably have gotten away with a L."
5.0,I  was pleasantly surprised in the level of detail especially considering the cost.
5.0,Perfect replacement strap! It unwound effortlessly from shipment and did not retain any bends. Was ready to clip onto my purse immediately!
5.0,This is a great shoe for people who have plantar fasciitis
5.0,No problems !!  Have ordered these before.  Great service.
5.0,I'm 5'7 and I order one size up because I was worried about the sleeve and dress length being too short (which is a problem I always have with buying dresses) and its perfect! the top part fits really comfortably and the material is thicker than I though it would be which is great!<br />The waist is a little big (because I ordered a size up) but the belt fixes that! instead of the waits looking too big the belt just makes the skirt of the dress more fluffy! And the belt is removable so you can change it out for a different one if you want. Overall its really cute and can be a casual day out dress or simple fancy dress. i love it!
5.0,"Bought as a Christmas gift,  my husband loves them and wears them every day. They are sturdy and we'll made. They look great and elevates his sleepy presence around the house to someone more sophisticated."
5.0,Looking forward to using. Have poison ivy & feel these will be great!
5.0,Extremely happy with this purchase - love the fact I can match my shoes to the clothing I wear!
5.0,Perfect for 6th grade Roman wax museum she is tall
5.0,"I order this for my daughter's 40th Birthday, Mother/Daughter her birth stones This will remind her that I all always be with her."
5.0,Beautiful earrings.  Great price.
5.0,"Excelent..I was afraid for the size. I bought L..I am 5 '5, 160 pounds..perfecto me quedo.y calienta"
5.0,"wish they were bigger,other then that ok."
5.0,Love Tue product. Very comfortable
5.0,Gave this to my daughter for her graduation. Had it engraved with the date and her degree. A lovely addition to her charm bracelet!
5.0,"This is a beautiful watch, I do not think it is available any longer and I am glad I got one before they were sold out. The movement is smooth and the watch over all is one of the most attractive watches I have ever owned."
5.0,Very cute and not too big
5.0,My best purchase ever
5.0,"Very strong. Nice look, and very professional look"
5.0,I was very happy with my purchase. It fits perfect and is clearly a very well made product. Durable and soft.
5.0,Flawless. true to size. Beautiful
5.0,"Bought these for my boyfriend and now he lives in them! Perfect fit, super comfortable and breathable. He's 6'1 and the length is perfect. He loves the pockets. Highly recommend!"
5.0,Got mines for church. The top material is soft and of good quality.... the bottom material is a bit stiff but a good iron does the trick. Its comfortable and very attractive. I got a small I'm 130lb. The top part is a little too big but no one notice :)
5.0,Worked perfectly for what I needed it for!
5.0,Perfect for any demonic Halloweek look. Can’t wear em while driving because they smoosh against the ceiling
5.0,"Perfect red color and fit.  I like the front of my jeans to at least come over my tummy and this fit in all the right places and covered my tummy as I wanted.  The stretchy material allows you to move and be comfortable, not too tight."
5.0,Absolutely loved it. I purchased it as a surprise for my daughter and it had the result as I was looking for. She felt like a princess carrying it. The problem was it stated it would hold a cell phone and she has the smallest phone on the market and it would not fit. Even still she and apple purse were the hit of the prom.
5.0,excellent would buy again
5.0,"Love this band, feels so comfortable.  The ""only complant"" is this band tends to stretch at the opening after being taken off and put back on after continuing use."
5.0,Very simple but very cute. Was almost exactly what I was looking for. I like the little pearls and the rose gold is a beautiful color but it does look a little cheaper than what I was hoping for. I can't complain for the price though. It doesn't look as though the pearls will fall off and the clip seems to be good quality so I do think the bracelet will last quite some time. Overall I'm pleased.
5.0,"Perfect. Beautiful red, the shirt it so nice for work. Love it."
5.0,Amazed at the quality for how inexpensive these are!!!
5.0,Super comfy material. Love the flow.
5.0,"I normally wear a 10, I ordered an 11 - they fit perfect. Very cute. Like them a lot."
5.0,Really was looking for a great beach bag and I found it !!! Its classy perfec for the beach
5.0,Fit nicely. I have a large bust. The xl fit well
5.0,"The anti-fog function is very practical, finally no need to always wipe the safety glasses with a cloth. This feature makes safety glasses truly safe!"
5.0,"Metal Masters shipping was insanely fast. I was blown away with how quickly my order was filled, shipped and received!<br />This ring is lovely. The quality and comfort is incredible. I absolutely love the design on this ring. The only down-side I have to say is that I, personally, underestimated how big & wide this ring would look on my tiny finger. I wear a size 5 and the ring was true to size - no issues there at all. I wasn't wanting to get a big flashy ring to wear as a wedding band, just something simple - I failed getting this ring :-) It is not simple at all, it is stunning and definitely eye-catching. I'll just have to get used to that {big smile}.<br />This would make a great right hand ring, especially on someone with smaller hands/fingers.<br />I wish I had known I needed more of a 5-6mm ring, but this one is so pretty that I'll definitely get used to the 7mm width. And, again, the comfort is excellent!"
5.0,great quality and bright and happy
5.0,"I've used this for 3+ years and it hasn't suffered so much as a bend or a scuff to the finish.<br />I bought this because I typically pull doors open by the ring, and often would break regular key rings.<br />This is not only durable but the quickly release feature makes it incredibly easy to get keys on an off without risking it happening accidentally.<br /><br />Top Recommendation."
5.0,Very useful. Keeps out all the unneeded UV rays. Good fit on the eyes as well.
5.0,Loved this! Me & friends used it for cheetah girls Halloween outfits & they were perfect. We knew it would get to hot in the club so we went for shorts. Came in all the colors we needed. I think I will actually be order a couple more color sets for myself
5.0,A big hit everywhere I go. Fun to have different options of led lights too. Highly recommend to others.
5.0,I love the fit and the material
5.0,My 16-month-old daughter wears this while she rides her toy airplane but also just everywhere because it's so comfortable. Perfect!!
5.0,"It’s a great price for a great watch, tells date, month, has an awesome alarm perfect for everyday use as well as an active one 10/10"
5.0,"Over this multi pack. Great material, comfortable, not sweaty. Great price."
5.0,"So, I originally measured my daughter, and the size small was the exact fit.  I ordered the small originally.  When it arrived, I realized I should have ordered the medium.  It was very tailored (meaning tight) she barely had any room to breath or raise her arms.  I returned the small and ordered the medium, which was a much more roomy fit across the chest and shoulders.  The waist looks great...its all very tailored so keep in mind your measurements and whether or not you like breathing :)"
5.0,Beautiful little thing.<br />Nicely done and perfect proportion with my real pandora charms.<br />I recommend  the diller to everyone  and I will be happy to buy more items from him
5.0,Great for those who work on their feet all day.
5.0,"This is a nice dress for the price.  Not a light floaty material as I had hoped.  After reading the reviews, I did go 2 sizes up to XXL, as the top does seem like it runs smaller, that worked well."
5.0,I like the comfort ot these gloves and the durability. I work in a freezer daily that is. -25 degrees and with these gloves I don't have to add hand warmers in each glove to keep my hands warm.
5.0,"Hubby's birthday. Long time devoted John Lord fan with no tee! Perfect gift, good fit and has washed up well - no shrinking, unraveling, or stretched out neck."
5.0,"THESE NETS ARE PERFECT FOR BUTTERFLIES, POLLYWOGS & FISH ETC. EXCELLENT PRICE AND SUPER FAST SHIPPING!"
5.0,Issa hat
5.0,"I have received it on time and the box was easy to open. The watch is nice and good quality for the price, it is working good without problem."
5.0,"Love this dress, bought 4 in different colors for the summer. Very flattering, and is a throw on and go dress. Highly recommend!"
5.0,"Bought this watch for my husband.  It looks very stylish, is comfortable to wear, and he loves it."
5.0,"Old ladies glasses, my 86 year old Aunt loved them"
5.0,The outfit was very soft and my granddaughter looked cute as a bug’s ear in it!!
5.0,"Freacken love these pants.!! I have been looking everywhere for this type of material & these type of leggings sence my fav leggings I had finally ripped & I am soooo happy that these FINALLY ARE IT.!!!! Get them I promise u just get them you'll love them. I'm 5""5 185lbs & the plus size fit perfect maybe a tinybitt loose....I actually might get the one size next time instead of plus size I order them BECAUSE I WILL BE ORDERING MORE.!! Very very VERY HAPPY.!!"
5.0,For my brother with skin cancer
5.0,"This gown is sized right and very comfortable. The fabric is light weight which is what I wanted. It is not the gown that you would probably want on a COLD winter’s night...but, great for the other three seasons. I bought a second gown in red...I would buy more if there were some pastel colors offered!"
5.0,"I got the LG, and I am 5'5&#34;, 133 lbs and they are skin tight.  Great quality, but get a larger size."
5.0,"So far so good. I bought two of these: brown and black. The buckle attachment was very simple, and the tightening and unbuckling mechanism works great and feels sturdy. The buckles look great. The only thing that might be a slight bother to some is that the belts are relatively narrow, that is, the width (not the thickness) is a bit small and leaves a bit of room in my belt loops; I'd have liked these belts a smidgen wider. This is a very minor complaint though, as overall I like the belts very much."
5.0,I bought this for my elderly dad because he kept on losing all of his wallet and important papers. He can just throw it over his shoulder and go knowing that everything he needs is inside.
5.0,"I bought these for my daughter and they fit very good, nice pants for a excellent price"
5.0,"Love it, nice ring"
5.0,My son loves Bluey and when he got his pj's he never wanted to take them off the shorts were a little long but I did get the outfit in a larger size. Love it!
5.0,Good quality. It fits perfectly.
5.0,Love this sweater! Great quality. Recommend to others!
5.0,This product is very easy to open and close so it's great for a daith piercing.
5.0,Beautiful and so chic❤
5.0,Basic black leotard for ballet class.  Fits 10 year old as expected.
5.0,"The strap is very comfortable around my neck, makes access to the camera easy and quick. The only concern is making sure the screw in device is tight so the camera is safely attached to the strap."
5.0,"The reviews are right, these are probably the nicest, softest, most comfortable workout pants ever!  I ordered them in white for a Halloween costume & they were totally opaque, couldn't see through them at all, which is what I was going for. I will order more, for actually working out in!"
5.0,These are so comfortable I ordered a second set
5.0,Great sunglasses to wear in the sun. Super dark if you have light colored eyes. Very cute design with the crossed pistols on the side.
5.0,This backpack was exactly what I hoped it would be.
5.0,It's the perfect head cover for my prayers/chanting.<br />It's beautiful!!!
