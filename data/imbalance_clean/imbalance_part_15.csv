4.0,Me gusta su diseño y calidad pero su tamaño es demasiado grande
4.0,The compliments was through the roof the material was a lil to thick but I loved this outfit at 1st I laughed when it came but when its on and I’m dressed up it’s an amazing outfit and I loved it !
4.0,Well made exaclty as described
4.0,I’ve only worn it once but it was comfortable. At first it felt like it was too close to my armpits but I either got used to it or it got better during the day. I wanted mine loose to wear as an undershirt so I didn’t get it to fit closely. So far so good.
4.0,"Fit as expected. I enjoy them very much. Unsure how many washes they will survive. There are loose threads, but nothing that threatens the structure of the garment. Very comfortable!"
4.0,Standand RL quality.
4.0,Such a good price.  Came prime just in time for the Dodger game.  Blue looks good with the Jersey.
4.0,"Cute, but a little tight on sleeves."
4.0,"Hard to put on. But once they’re on, they work great."
4.0,"The bag is perfect in every way except there was a powerful odor like gasoline, we had to wash the bag. Even then the odor is still there, altho dissipating as time goes on. If not for that the bag would be a five star."
4.0,"All fit and wear well except the black ban, It keeps detaching from the fitbit"
4.0,Super cute toy would recommend and it appears to be safe for a 9 yr.old.
4.0,Nice Fabric. A little short but its a party dress.Great for an ALL WHITE PARTY.
4.0,"It was a bit too small, but she looked adorable in it."
4.0,"Amazing top for the price, incredibly soft and comfortable, but beware of this top's length! Size-wise it feels true to size, but it's definitely more on the &#34;shirt&#34; side of a t-shirt dress. I have bought a few in different colors to wear with leggings, and I love them all!"
4.0,"This looks like it would be adorable on any baby -- why is it labeled &#34;girls&#34;?  Stupid marketing, to try to cut one's potential customer base in half."
4.0,A smidgen too small
4.0,"It has a different 'look' then my other bathing suits, I will need to 'take up' a little material just under arm pit, it gathers there just a little.  But with that small 'fix' I really like the suit."
4.0,This cap is very nice. It's a great casual piece that I enjoy wearing to protect my hair and keep it under<br /><br />I first saw one when a good friend had one to wear due to chemo hair loss. It doesn't seem limited to just chemo patients.
4.0,"not the best quality, the plastic was a little flimsy."
4.0,The pin changing tool was a godsend.  The band is fine though a little shorter than I expected.  If you have big wrists you might be in trouble.
4.0,Not a bad shirt but not t-shirt material. More of a terry cloth.
4.0,"The socks themselves are super cute, but are  smaller than expected. They are stretchy like most other socks so my five-month old average-built daughter can wear them. Now, the biggest caveat and the reason for my two-star rating: the threads come off and get all tangled up when washed as in the picture.<br />====<br />I have added two stars from my previous review: I was contacted by the seller and was offered a new replacement. I did NOT take the offer since the socks are still wearable, but was pleased with the offer of their customer service all the same. Just beware that the threads can be tangled when washed."
4.0,I really like this suit! I like how it fits so far. I haven't worn it and gotten it wet yet because it's for an upcoming vacay but I'm comfortable in it and can't wait to wear.
4.0,"The blue is murano quality glass,clear and less crackle than pictuured. They sparkle and are very unique.  They are not too long and look good with both long and short hair."
4.0,"it does fit as the picture shows but on me, i do not like how it looks. if i was thin like the model. i would love them. they are a great price. the material is great and so is the price. if i looked like the model, i would keep them. they are stretchy making it easy to cover a long torso. i need to order a loose fit nylon top if they exist."
4.0,"I generally wear a size 14. I ordered the 14plus (3x) size due to recommendations. It fits fine (a tad roomy). I love the skirt, but the coloring on the shirt doesn’t quite look good. I will either remove the top or just wear a sweater over it. The skirt is beautiful and perfect for fall!"
4.0,"I love the hoodie but I've had it for almost a month and from wearing it about once or twice a week it is already developing tiny dust balls all over . If you are willing to find ways to get rid of the dust balls and maintain that brand new look like I'm going to do , then this is a really good deal ."
4.0,"Very good bikini. Has held up really well, my boobs fit in it a little funny and the bottom looks goofy unzipped but I've gotten a lot of compliments on it and would definitely purchase again. As far as the boob situation I just slightly bent the underwire in the top and that helped a lot. Would purchase again especially for the price!"
4.0,This a true to size dress! I'm 5'3 and 120 lbs. I ordered small and it fits perfectly.<br />I like this dress because is perfect for lunch or dinner not too formal or too casual. So if you want to look formal I would go with a pair of nice black heels. For casual flat sandals or wedges.<br />This a bodycon type of dress that makes you look very curvy.<br />I love the beautiful flower design and the fusion of the two colors.<br />This dress was a sample and I'm only sharing my experience with the product.
4.0,"This is my second pair. I gave one away to a friend, they work great ."
4.0,"This is a nice material, though it could be a bit thicker to improve its durability. The neck velcros in the back and there is a pair of snaps at the bottom that can fold into a catch pouch. It's not incredibly waterproof, so any liquid spills will soak through if enough is spilt. This can be tossed into the laundry like any other fabric, just no bleach and I wouldn't but it in the dryer on high. So far, no stains on this or shirts under this."
4.0,"Cute, love the belt. Warm enough for Michigan winters!"
4.0,"It's just a little long for short waisted people, but very cute, so I'm just removing the ruffle!"
4.0,Love these socks goes great with my fit
4.0,"The frames are excellent, light weight and very comfortable. The lenses are so so. I think they degrade my vision a bit. Also the axis of polarization is off about 20 degrees. So they aren't as good at blocking glare as they should be."
4.0,"Love it as an undershirt or a lightweight tank on hot days.  Straps are wide enough to wear a racerback bra & long enough to tuck in.  A great deal for the price.  They do not shink with washing and drying, but do stretch out during wear - to be expected with this lightweight 100% cotton."
4.0,Really pretty scarf. The fabric is not smooth or terribly soft but is not what I expected.
4.0,"I am happy with this. However,  it is a little small for my big head. But, it fits well enough to wear for a bit. I also, by the way, glued a piece of material on the inside to protect my nose which rubbed up against the metal rivets."
4.0,I like this.  I am 5'10 and have a hard time getting things long enough. This one actually works.
4.0,Works as expected. Came with color guide to tell us the meaning of each color. True to size. Bought this for my daughter who wanted a mood ring for Christmas.
4.0,Runs true to size. Wish I got a medium 😕
4.0,very soft and comfortable and plenty long for a tall person
4.0,"Well made.  The strap is easily adjusted and comfortable.  They are quite large and those with smaller faces may find they are too big.  A small amount of light leakage at the bottom, but in most rooms this is not noticeable at night.  A good value for the money."
4.0,its  came  broken  but its  pretty  thanks
4.0,I wanted warmer socks for the winter that we weren’t too thick and these are perfect. Shrink a lot after washing but they stretch a lot and still fit
4.0,"Love them, they are so comfy and the color is stunning. Need to get another pair for my niece."
4.0,"I have 43&#34; hips and bought an XL, could have purchased the large.  They are a little roomy, but still very comfortable.  Would purchase again."
4.0,"Size, color and quality as advertised."
4.0,They were really small
4.0,"Inside lining is flimsy, and items fall out easily.  Otherwise, I like it."
4.0,"This suit is super cute! It barely fit my 10 month old and she’s of average size. The straps were too long even at their shortest adjustment, yet the suit was very low hanging. Unfortunately it will not fit this summer. I’d definitely size up! Absolutely adorable otherwise."
4.0,"It will definitely work for my purposes which is costuming.  The price was great.  It feels like a cheap material, and I'm not sure how long it will hold up, but the look is great and it should do fine for a costume.  The color and actual look is spot on."
4.0,"I was very careful with this one because I broke 2 others attaching the flowers.  The elastic line was a bit weak (because I'm not THAT strong!)  Happily, this was just what my client wanted and because it was wide, it was a sturdy support but the pearl was a nice dressy touch that matched my client's jewelry."
4.0,as expected.  on time delivery
4.0,"This is a very soft shirt, but size up as it seems small"
4.0,"This was bought as a gift, with the recipient being the person to originally show me this necklace.<br /><br />The item arrived quickly even though it was ordered late into the holiday season and wasn't expected to arrive until mid-January.  The necklace was beautiful, though, and looked exactly like the photos.<br /><br />My only &#34;complaint&#34; about the piece is that the chain looks as if it would be tighter/shorter around the neck than I would personally like.  That's why they have extenders, though, I guess.<br />I haven't heard any complaints about it from the recipient, however."
4.0,"Slightly large, but get the job done"
4.0,"3 Masks arrived as pictured, and there are nose wires. Not ideal for children under 12 runs more on the adult sizing but it’s better than nothing. No filter and just the outside layer with black print and a white inside layer - not too much protection but again, better than nothing. I’m disappointed I live in Hawaii and I received the masks within a week of ordering but now that I have this set I figured it won’t hurt to buy another. I try to buy it again but now it requires “special handling” and can’t be shipped! Beats the hell out of me why but at least I have a set."
4.0,Watch came in earlier than expect. It looked exactly like what I'd ordered. Everything was absolutely great aside from trying to change the time but thankfully it has instructions on how to do so inside the watch carrier it comes in. Over all great product for a reasonable price.
4.0,"Bought these in multiple sizes for a bachelorette party to add our initials to the pockets. We wanted an oversized feel. I am 5’2’’ and weight about 135 and this was a good fit, just a little longer than I would have liked. Did not like how it looked buttoned. Overall great quality and worth the cost."
4.0,a few pieces i've received have been somewhat cheaply made. I have had to tighten the links so it won't fall apart.
4.0,"Nothing special, but the value was good, liked that there were four.  The kids bring their PE clothes home in them.  I would’ve liked to use them for swimming, but would have been better if one side of the bag was solid, so the wetness wouldn’t get your back wet.  But for the value, they’ll get use.  Just not multi purpose use.  Gym clothes, practice clothes, etc."
4.0,"This type is great for the waist belt of a day pack, but would NOT be heavy enough for the hip belt of a full-size back pack."
4.0,"This was perfect for our passports honeymoon. I wish it had more room for cards, though."
4.0,"Did not fit size recommendation.  Reasonable price , but a measuring indicator would help. Successfully returned."
4.0,vinieron con los cables de las luces desconectados  y el control remoto no funciona correctamente hay que colocarlo muy cerca... pero en lineas generales son muy comodas y agradables a la vista y alumbran bastante bien despues de repararlas.
4.0,Christmas gifts were perfect she loves it.
4.0,"The bag is very pretty. I wish it didn’t have white handles, because they will get dirty."
4.0,I got the large size! I’m 5’3 and about 165. These are very cute pants. The only thing I didn’t like was how low the slit was. I got them hemmed so it was a little higher and now they’re perfect! (Pictures are after and before the hemming)
4.0,I love the material. So soft.
4.0,"I've worn these for half my pregnancy and they are very comfortable...including the soft straps - which I notice some others do not have. I would give 5 stars but after four months of pregnancy the lighter colors don't really seem to come clean anymore. Other than that I would still be wearing them.  Never broke, comfortable, soft. What more can you ask."
4.0,"I chose this style specifically because it says and shows a picture of padded straps AND padded BACK.  The back is NOT padded on ANY of the colors, but the straps do have a little.  The bottoms aren't reinforced but I knew that already.  That being said, that's really my biggest complaint because they are very affordable and so they're well-made for the price.  There's a couple of spots in corners where you can tell it wasn't made to last forever, but overall the seams look correct and the material is better than all of my tote bags.  The colors/patterns are actually really good looking, I wouldn't be embarrassed to carry any of these around, they look legit.  I would say that these will be pretty close to perfect for elementary and MAYBE middle school, but Definitely not High School, I just don't see it standing up to the heavy books.<br /><br /> I tried to find something just like one step up from these but it's either cheap things or a regular priced one, there's not anything in-between.  If there was something just like 10% more expensive but it's cause they put the padded back and a stronger bottom, this would be wonderful!  Just cause they're for donation doesn't mean it should be uncomfortable or cheap.  I would happily pay more to have the back padded for the comfort of the children."
4.0,Priced reasonably
4.0,Not true to size. Order one size larger.
4.0,The product looks silicone but it a hard plastic
4.0,I love it but after a few days of being left in it's box it had turned a rusty gold color. I don't mind though and I think it's still sweet looking
4.0,"Watch is Light weight, doesn’t sweat on wrist and the  light is dull so  it’s hard to see the time when it’s dark."
4.0,"She likes them, but too much of the same colors.was hoping for a better mix I'm kinda disappointed but gratedul"
4.0,"It is a little different way of locking clasp. But the more i use the clasp, I realize the item is more convenient than I used to. Not so extravagant, it fit to me."
4.0,"I bought this as a bday gift for my 7yr old son whose a ghost buster fanatic. He loved it! Only downside is that the batteries included inside the device were dead, so I had to replace with my own."
4.0,"it doesn't fit like a regular bra so the size is not the same...But other than that, it was good quality product."
4.0,Beautiful shoes but unfortunately too narrow.  They are in the process of being returned.  SORRY!
4.0,"This product was the perfect size to fit in a college backpack and had all of the gadgets needed to be organized.  It is a fun way to keep supplies right at hand.  The  price was less expensive than stores in the mall.  The only drawback is it is missing the loop to hang it up by, on the back."
4.0,"As many reviews point out, small angel wings.  I followed a recommendation and bought additional feathers and thank God I did.  The wings came out as expected.  I used them for my office winter decorations, and with the extra feathers added it came out beautiful."
4.0,"The size is amazing for those who have larger heads.<br /><br />The only issue I had was that the coloring of the mask was faded and not as vibrant as I would have hoped.<br /><br />Right now it is being used as decoration more than the use of protection.<br /><br />If you want fan merchandise, it is amazing but definitely not for use."
4.0,"I knew these would be kinda funky when I purchased them. I bought them for disney boundinng or cosplayig aurora (sleeping beauty). They look weird unless I'm in the full outfit, but very cute for what I intended."
4.0,The swim suit is great is just it did not fit me. it is short on me and i am 5'0.
4.0,"This is another chinese fashion watch, but knowing that, it's really nice. One thing to note is the lug size, which is 22mm. This watch is much larger in person."
4.0,These shirts extremely soft very comfortable very stretching. I have washed them several times the color stayed true the stitching isn't unraveling. They wick moisture very quickly. I like how lightweight and breathable this shirt is. I can't say enough good things about these if I need more this is the ones I'm going to buy.
4.0,Really cute but also really big I don't think the size is true so if I were u I'd order a size smaller then what you expect
4.0,"Appearance is gorgeous! If it is wore with delicate clothes, clothes surface could result a little damaged because is a little rough, has relieve."
4.0,"Overall, the glasses serve their purpose, but I must fit my real glasses into the slotted frames before putting them on. They are lighter weight than I expected."
4.0,"I’m normally a size 14-16, depending on if the material is stretchy. I ordered an xlg and it fits me perfectly. My bust is 44 in. and the xlg is just right. It’s not tight, and I have plenty of movement."
4.0,"I was expecting a harder bottom but I will not complain for how cheap they were. Fit nice and comfortable, shipped fast even in a shoe box!"
4.0,"I usually wear smalls in tops. I ordered a medium just in case, as I'd rather it be too big then too small. I'm glad I did cause the medium fits me perfectly. I'm 5ft 6. 135lbs. It is shorter in the arms then I like."
4.0,LOVE the quality of the shirt (so soft and smooth) and the printing is top quality. Only 4 stars because I usually order an XL so I have some under arm room (I have a huge chest 38DDD) and this was so tight I can't even move my arms. I'll give it to my younger sister and order the two larger sizes and hope one fits. Otherwise this product is very high quality and lovely.
4.0,"There are 2 different tops being sold under one item.  When you scroll through size & color, look carefully - one top has short sleeves, the other has 3/4 sleeves & the two styles are different in other ways.  The top pictured here is extremely long in the back (knee length) & short in the front.  The other top is more balanced front & back.  Fabric is nice & top is good value for the money, but I'm not a fan of the short front & very long back.  Just be sure you know which top you are ordering."
4.0,"I'm 5'5 and 125 pounds, very small upper body. I ordered the smallest size which is a bit tight up my torso and around my shoulders. I still like it, just be aware that the torso part is short in length. I also have to add that my torso is average size. However, the quality is great and shipping arrives sooner than expected. I'm satisfied."
4.0,"Fit as expected,  material is nice and  soft, color appeared softer on the site. That is a very bright color! Will be worn under a sweater or jacket."
4.0,The rhinestone hoop is way too large. So I only wear it at home. Great if your looking for that bull look.
4.0,"I bought these booties for twin grandchildren, they 2 months old, for fitting is little smaller than babies feet. But the are so cute"
4.0,"Would have given 4 stars , howevever sizing is off, based on size chart I bought XL. However this size fits baggy. I am typically a M or 8. I will reorder the L"
4.0,This bag was great for my trip thru Italy.  Could carry so much. Very comfortable to use
4.0,Even thought it was a bit large it works fine.
4.0,"As a huge Jack Skellington fan, I was excited to find these when I was looking for new slippers. They are very comfortable and whimsical."
4.0,The cap is attractive and does what it supposed to do.  The only thing that bothered me was it was a little too tight making it just a little uncomfortable to sleep in.
4.0,"I usually find these waffle shirts too hot but, this one is thin and perfect for me. Comfortable and easy to wash. True to size. I want to get more colors."
4.0,Not the best but decent one ... gifted for uncle and he is happy with it
4.0,"not my style, but my system likes it"
4.0,"I'm a 36B and I got this in medium. It's a little snug, but very cute. It almost reminds me of a bathing suit top with the way it hooks in the back."
4.0,Fit was a bit longer than expected but great for the price
4.0,It's nice. It's more golden than it seems on the photo. Wore it with a pink print dress and it stood out.
4.0,We bought these for a photoshoot and loved how fun they look...also it makes everything look beautiful in a light pink hue!
4.0,I love this watch.  I looks so fashion forward.
4.0,They are adorable and easy to just throw in the wash!
4.0,Absolutely adorable! My daughter will love it!!!
4.0,I purchased for the blonde wrestler mustache it was a little bit smaller than I expected but it did the job for the costume. Adhesive stayed on very well and did not cause any irritation!<br />Now I have extra mustaches to wear under my mask when I’m feeling silly
4.0,"Great very comfortable shirt. I'm a guy, so it obviously fit a bit smaller than I'd have liked due to my average height, but it still looks great on me and well-fitted. Very comfortable material and pretty much works with any other piece of wardrobe. If you're smaller, it should fit as shown in pictures."
4.0,A bit larger than I expected but very nice
4.0,"This is a great product; however, it is important to note the measurements are wrong in the pictures. It is about 3” deep, 8” wide, and 4” tall. Each compartment itself is about 2”x3”. Other than that no issues!"
4.0,"The largest earrings of the set are a bit big for my tastes, but still pretty. I use the three smallest pairs. Backs stay on well so far - worn about 5 times. No irritation, itchiness, or redness when wearing these earrings."
4.0,This was purchased as a gift. Recipient's wrist is quite small and bracelet is not quite adjustable enough. She wears it but is worried it will fall off and get lost.  Maybe this could be made in two sizes? extra small/small and medium/large
4.0,"Arrived sooner than expected, love the feel & style. Not as long as I expected but still fit good."
4.0,It’s cute. I thought it would be a little softer but it’s decent. Not the best quality but it looks cute and is cozy.
4.0,"I wanted something somewhat understated to express my love of Kpop tastefully. I essentially wanted something I can wear without drawing attention to it. The charm is a bit bigger than the picture indicates (it might be because of the angle of the picture), so it's a little more obvious than I originally wanted. The silver plating is also quite obvious so I don't suspect it will keep its luster long."
4.0,"Nice colors and I like that it has filters that come with it. However the mask was bought as a gift and it was big, even on me and I have a fairly large face. The straps on the sides are fine, its just the length and width of the mask itself."
4.0,"Okay I'm only giving it four stars because I received these all bent, they are still usable of course, and you can just bend them back straight when you use them.<br />I haven't put them in yet but I've used these kinds before in school so I know they will do the trick of fooling anyone or just keeping your piercings from getting ripped out. (: this product is cheap and I'd recommend these to anyone."
4.0,"I think that this is a beautiful ring, better than what I was looking for. Size 6 is right for me! Thank you! Just 1 more thing I really need a size 5. I've bought this ring twice already and I can't get the size right. I need to try a size 5."
4.0,"They stick well and we’re HILARIOUS for our mustache night. Sadly, I did not wear the colored ones (which I wanted to wear) as the hair was falling off in nose/mouth. But the black ones were wonderful!"
4.0,Love the colors and material. The size S is for me too big and bulgy looking. For home and garden ideal!
4.0,Good quality but not leather more of a suede still a nice band
4.0,"Very pretty, and easy to remove links."
4.0,The dress is great quality BUT isn't long enough. When I buy a maxi dress I don't want to be able to see my ankles and this dress shows the whole ankle.
4.0,Love the boot. Buy a half size bigger.  They are a little narrow.
4.0,I like the dress but the waist is a little larger than I was expecting.  If I sized down I feel like the bust would be too tight.  Love that it has pockets abd the fabric is light.
4.0,"It's fun to wear, easy to throw on, and a great color. The fabric is a little heavy for my taste, but it's a well-made garment and I enjoy wearing it."
4.0,"I've only had this a couple weeks, but so far it's been durable and effective.  And it keeps my keys from scratching my phone!"
4.0,"Jacket fits like a medium and and I ordered an XXXL. I gave it to my significant other, fit him perfectly."
4.0,"Really cute, I got an extra large knowing a lot of clothes that come from China run small. it's a bit tight."
4.0,"I am satisfied with my purchase.  The socks go over the knee for my very slim ten year old.  But she loves them.  I would have liked them to be a bit thicker, although they really are not ""sport"" socks after all.  Hence, they are not like Adidas soccer socks (which my daughter is used to) but satisfactory for everyday wear."
4.0,"Pretty but a little smaller than expected. Have to be careful that they don't fall off, especially when pulling off a top over your head. I have one earlobe that is a little larger so feels a little tight but you can loosen or tighten them. Can also wear them as ear crawlers or hanging down. Price was good."
4.0,Like the dress got the wrong color 😔😔
4.0,Preasant for brothers
4.0,"I purchased these as a bag filler for a summer gathering. The colors are bright and the frames fit an adult size head. The plastic frames are light weight and should fit most guest comfortably. These make great party favors and look as though they will last your guest a few wears. I wouldn’t buy them for daily wear. The plastic frames appear to delicate for continued use. Overall, these glasses make a great party gift and can be used to add to the festivity of your party."
4.0,"These worked wonderfully for my Crowley costume. They're pretty light weight and the aviator bar was fairly easy to remove. The lenses aren't super dark but they work well for indoors! They feel cheap, but are worth the $15 if you're careful with them"
4.0,The material on the arms isn’t amazing but it’s overall a cute shirt. I get a lot of compliments on it and it is comfortable
4.0,"No me quedaron, las pedí en talla 7 y me mandaron talla 8 aunque si están bonitas."
4.0,Loved!  Brilliant color and pattern pants. THANK YOU!
4.0,Trolly works fine for a suitcase or fairly large box.  Bunge cord could be longer.
4.0,"Socks work pretty good, except they ""roll"" and that is uncomfortable.  Launder easily and nicely"
4.0,"Nice shirts that fit well. The cut is flattering on my daughter and she likes that they are soft, stretchy and comfortable.  They did shrink after the first wash but I expected that from 100% cotton. While they are not the best made shirt ever they are a good value for a decent shirt that will last a season or two."
4.0,"These are the coolest sunglasses! Lightweight, fun, and great for sun protection. My only nitpick is that there's no contouring over the nose. The flat look kinda reminds me of 3D glasses from the movies. Other than that these are wonderful."
4.0,"Superior design to regular ponchos because there is elastic around the wrists which keeps rain off your sleeves. The plastic is very thin, but should be expected as it is intended for one time use only."
4.0,"A solid strap - great value - I ordered another one, easy to install and use, looks great, alligator style leather."
4.0,The clothes fit everywhere besides the elastic is way to tight.
4.0,"Don't waste your money.  While the product is super cute, very glitzy and blingy, it arrived with at least six stones that had become dislodged.  I super glued the rhinestones back in (and also glued at least 4 of my fingers together in the process), but then after about 7 or 8 uses, now it looks like the elastic band is holding together by a thread.  I really wanted to like this bracelet, and as I matter of fact, I received a lot of compliments on it on the few occasions that I did wear it.  Now I can only wear it sparingly, as I feel the elastic is going to give way any day now:(<br /><br />UPDATE 5/16/17 - The owner saw my review and sent me a new bracelet at no charge.  The new bracelet still arrived with 2 stones that were dislodged during shipping, but they were easily replaced.  The elastic appears to be in much better shape on this one than on the first one and my daughter was able to wear it to prom without losing any additional stones this past weekend.  It truly is a very stunning and impressive piece of jewelry."
4.0,This is a nice dress!...It does run one size too large and about 4&#34; too long. It needs to be hemmed.. that's why I gave it 4 stars. I bought a size medium for my daughter and it was too large on her. She's 5' and wears a size 8. The fabric also spandex. I bought the same dress a second time (small) because we love the dress so much.  The small one fits her much better. I still have to hemmed it a few inches.  I ended up keeping the first dress for myself and I typically wear size 14.
4.0,I really like this dress but I just found that the small was still a little too big for me but I still wear it and it looks really good!
4.0,"This is such a wonderful dress - and is slightly stretchy.  I am normally and size 4 with a small busy and ordered a 4 and it fits perfect.  I would suggest sizing up if your busy is larger because this fits me like a glove.<br /><br />Looks and feels like an expensive sheath dress.  Only suggestion to the designer and seamstress is to improve the stitching around the neckline.  It is large and will be viewed the most as it is around your neckline.  A less noticeable, tight stitch would be more appropriate.<br /><br />I ordered two other colors.  Conservative yet sexy - isn't that what all women want to have for the business environment?  I love it."
4.0,These boots are glittery and fun. The quality of the boots seems good for the cost.
4.0,"Smaller than anticipated but brother liked it. When I heard him read it to Mom, I got teary eyed. Love that guy...<br />Came with two different chains in a pretty box. Instructions on the timepiece were included."
4.0,Its a good belt. Looks great and is a pretty color.  Good for work outfits and anything outside of work as well :)
4.0,Was pleasantly surprised at this dress - was impressed at the quality for the price.  Fit as expected.
4.0,[[ASIN:B074XPR7JM Lecxci Women's Large Soft Leather Multi-purpose Crossbody Handbag Shoulder Travel Bags Purses for Women (Brown)]] This purse is LARGE! It reminds me of a small overnight bag. It can hold a medium size book & tablet. It is well made. The only thing I don't like about it is that the lining is black. I have vision issues & have difficulty finding things that are black or are located in a black bag. I was hoping the lining would be light colored since I ordered a brown bag.
4.0,Strong gloves and the XL were the perfect size that fit my husband and sons hands well without ripping and were not tight.  The price was a little high but they worked well.  If you do not mind spending the extra money (as there are less expensive gloves out there) I recommend these.
4.0,My son loves it!!  He has a bit of a larger head than most 7 year olds.  It is very snug but still fits.
4.0,"Frankly, this looked strange and dumpy on me as-is. Maybe I'm too old to pull off the style, or maybe my brain can't accept a cold shoulder in cold-weather clothing, but either way, it looked idiotic on me. Then I cut off the sleeves & it was perfect, great layered with long sleeves and tights in winter, and nice on its own as a transitional-season garment. It's heavy enough to be cozy, but light enough not to feel like a sweatshirt. I like the color, too. I typically go for neutrals, and this blue mixes will in a neutral palette."
4.0,Love the earrings. The earring box is wonderful. The pearls are in excellent condition and are definitely the proper size that I ordered. I am very happy so far.
4.0,"I bought these for a Halloween costume, but they are much nicer than I thought they would be. Now I have some gloves for the winter."
4.0,I was looking for a belly ring that would be nice and low profile since I have a smaller piercing. There are a ton that are much longer but not many that are short like this one (and tasteful). Seems to be good quality too.
4.0,I really like lia sophia jewelry.  I ordered this necklace for a friend because she admired mine so much.  My friend said it was the perfect length for her neck.
4.0,Super Cute shorts BUT runs really small.<br />I am usually size 4 (28) and ordered Large on this shorts but it was still too small for me.
4.0,This is such a pretty suit! I was worried about purchasing on amazon but it all worked out! Super happy with this cute and cheap suit!
4.0,Warm boots but alittle small. And very narrow
4.0,This purse is totally gold. I thought it was going to be more beige/mushroom. Returning because of color.
4.0,"It fits a tiny big, nothing that a thicker pair of socks couldn’t fix. It was more the bridge/instep was big and I wish it was more fitted, but honestly for what I paid they’re perfect for jeans!"
4.0,"The cut-out design allows you to adjust to nearly any size from small to XXL. Quality is pretty good too. The buckle,  however, is a single fixed prong. Just needs a bit of practice."
4.0,"Light material , great for summer"
4.0,I do really like these yoga pants.  I'm 5'6 230lbs and these fit really comfortably ...i ended up buying another pair.  I didn't give it five stars because I find myself having to pull up the yoga pants every now and then as they had a tendency to fall but maybe it's because I'm super active... I did a lot of kickboxing and Crossfit so there's lots of moving for long periods of time... but I love the side pockets where I can put my phone in and my keys and the comfort.
4.0,I truly doubt this is real gold but I like the way it looks.
4.0,"Comfortable, but looks more like a nighty than a dress."
4.0,Good quality strap...very long
4.0,"I got these very cheaply- $42!  And they are just great. They are groovy looking and VERY comfortable. I think they run a little big, but I kept my 8.5 and added insoles because I'm lazy about shipping. They are super easy to get on and off and the toe area inside the shoe is very roomy. I get lots of compliments on them."
4.0,"I wasnt expecting much for an under $20 watch.  However I was pleasantly surprised with quick shipping, nice packaging, and an overall decent product.  Tells time, looks good, pretty rugged so far, and even comes with a replacement battery.  My only complaints are:  The glow in the dark doesnt work very well and the wrist band feels like it was starched with concrete."
4.0,"These are a nice pair of clip on flip up sunglasses.  The lens dimensions are correct as stated in the product description, not smaller as some other reviews indicated (at least on the delivery I got).  Very good value with two pair for the price that other offers cost for a single pair.  The brown lenses are fairly dark, but are complimented nicely with the yellow lenses for overcast days and night driving.  Best clip ons I have found."
4.0,It’s a bit small but I like it. Kinda see through but it is breathable and stretchy with adjustable straps.
4.0,This is a gracious piece of jewely
4.0,"The large black clip doesn't look good at all. It has a matte finish with a spot that looks worn and trashy. The small black clip looks nice and uniform with a slight sheen. The silver clips both look fine.<br /><br />UPDATE: Customer Service read my review and sent me a new, clean set. However, after trying to use both sets of clips, they are very tight. Too tight to clip anything in them, so you have to bend them open a little. You just have to be very careful you don't bend them too much or else they will be useless."
4.0,Just a heads up that this is not a solid piece. It's like strands sewn together in a grid pattern. I love it but am going to have to back it for winter to keep out the breeze. It is very soft and cozy otherwise.
4.0,Four stars for having polyester in fabric blend
4.0,"LOVE this top, but runs a little large."
4.0,"I got the black scarf (not a loop, even though the description says it is) with pumpkins, and it's super cute.  I thought it looked really nice, but disliked the material - it's a slick polyester.  Overall, totally worth it for the one day a year that I'll wear it...."
4.0,"Love the look of this dress. I’m 6ft tall and the large comes down to my knees. Only complaint is that the material looks a little bit costume like, it’s a shiny synthetic blend."
4.0,Didnt give it 5 stars because they slip up and i have to pull them back down into place often unless i tuck them in which im not crazy about doing.  They slide up less when tucked in
4.0,"Gigantic.  Order down a size or possibly even two.  Otherwise, the material is cozy and comfortable.  I kept the really large one in the hopes that it shrinks some when I wash it, and I ordered a smaller size as well.<br /><br />Update Oct. 20, 2015:  I ordered a smaller size (different print) and it's still a little on the large size, but in line with what would be expected for a slightly oversized night shirt.  Definitely order a size down."
4.0,"They're great for staying dry, but they're a little too slippery on the sidewalk."
4.0,This is a great bra and it fits pretty snug. Your boobies are going nowhere! lol
4.0,I owned one before for years but it eventually became dysfunctional. The buttons no longer worked. This version seems lighter. The buttons easier to use. It functions in the same way as my previous one except the light function is inadequate. It only illuminates half of the screen and is essentially useless that's why only 4 stars. On my previous one the light function was the first function to fail (after a couple of years) so I'm used to no light.
4.0,I found the fabric to be too heavy for current weather. 75 degrees. Also the collar was cut too high for this size.
4.0,Not exactly oversized on me
4.0,"For the price, the quality is amazing. A nice solid piece of jewelry. Just received a few days ago, so can’t speak for security of stones or wear on the finish but my daughter loves it and hasn’t taken it off. Looks very pretty."
4.0,"As pictured.  Expensive, given what they are."
4.0,"These came in handy when you’re trying to cover up and be modest. I really liked the material and how they fit. I am unsure with why they said one size fits all- that is NOT true. If you’re cup size is bigger than a C, you will not fit into these."
4.0,I was very surprised by the quality.  Much better than I was expecting
4.0,"This blouse is well fitting and well made, with doubled fabric front. The pseudo pussy bow style is very nice for casual outing with dressy jeans or for office with dressy trousers or skirts. Very happy with the purchase and quality of the product."
4.0,Fits well. The string being flexible is a small drawback.
4.0,"After reading other reviews, I ordered a medium instead of a small but now I kind of wish I had ordered small. The top is loose, which I do like, but it's a bit too loose around the neckline with the X straps. I'm afraid of having a wardrobe malfunction. I still like the shirt though so I will just wear it with the X straps in the back (love that the shirt is reversible--the other side is just a plain V neck). I am 5'5&#34;, 125, B34"
4.0,"Good material, nice and heavy. It was beautiful, but unflattering for my shape which is curvy."
4.0,Very cute boots.  My only problem with then was the fact that the first time she wore them the insole came out of the right boot.
4.0,arrived earlier than expected. fits alright (although a little tight on the arms) and the price is alright. the fabric is a little bit thin (than i expected). but overall i still like it.
4.0,"Love the style of the dress. The material was basic, there was no hem just fabric straight cut with scissors. But for the price I didn't expect the greatest quality. But be warned.. though the material itself is light the full skirt makes it very bottom heavy. If you keep it on a hanger in the closet the top will get stretched out from the weight."
4.0,Nice shirt. Love the blue color!
4.0,Absolutely gorgeous crystal and it is sterling silver.<br /><br />I bought the matching ear rings from EleQueen for my GF first. They became her favorite piece. She wears them all the time now. Every day.<br /><br />So I wanted to buy the matching necklace for her.<br /><br />The chain that connects the crystal to the heart beat piece is too long IMO. It would be better without than short chain.<br /><br />But a Jeweler should be able to adjust that for you with ease.
4.0,"I bought this dress for a Christmas party, wore it with a black 3/4 sleeve sweater and boots. I'm 5'1 158lbs Medium fit just fine.. My only complaint, i wish the buttons on the front were black and not light brown, which made no sense - theres no brown in the fabric pattern.  The zipper under the arm was unnecessary, poked me, and was cold - the sweater helped. Glad I ordered it, fun to wear."
4.0,"These are essential pieces to anyone's survival or hiking gear. They do what you need them to do, and for a great price point. We'll buy more for various survival kit builds/options."
4.0,"Jasmine Men's Active Stretch Winter Baselayer Thermal Underwear Long Johns Undergarments came nicely packed without any damage.This thermal underwear is made of up of quality material and it is soft and comfortable to wear under your pants or jeans. It has got soft fleece inside and it is really comfortable and warm. Length wise it is a little bit longer, but it is okay."
4.0,Fit small. Had to return for larger size. Beautiful hoody.
4.0,These feel good very grippy but definitely for wuick heat transfer. I use these to remove things from a heat press. I wouldn't use them for cooking purposes at all. I probably can hold about 350 degrees in my hand for 2 min tops with these. And they let the heat in fast. I would only use these for wuick transfers of items. Also there is only heat protection on the palm and fingers. The top of your hand is just cloath. I wouldn't want to try to dest thevheat resistance of that.
4.0,Love the frame color but wished the glass frame was s little less big. The lens are clean and crisp
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:13bd5e2c2e42e369ded3e16ef14f37de]] i bought this outfit for halloween and to use for cosplay and it’s great!! im 5’2 and 125lbs so i got a size large, it was a little big on the waist and neck but overall fit pretty well. i didn’t have time to style the wig but it didn’t even need it!! i would recommend this is you’re thinking of cosplaying her :) check out @misamisa_cos to see how the cosplay fits"
4.0,Es bonito..<br />Lo malo fué que llegó sin factura
4.0,"Good slipers but they run small.  I wear an 8 1/2 and ordered a 9.  They are a little small but they stretch so that's OK.  Overall nicely made, but not as warm as I had hoped."
4.0,"So cute nice soft cotton, love"
4.0,"Cute & comfy dress. It was pretty wrinkled out of the bag, but steamed up well. Not a dress that will be completely wrinkle free though. Material is a little stiff, but also thin, so I wore a slip under it, as I think it would be a little see through with light behind you. The sleeves are pretty full, so I preferred them rolled up with buttoned flap. It is strictly a casual dress, but think you could use it for a cover up as well. I like the dress, especially since it is so comfortable. If you are between sizes, definitely size down, as it is very full.  I got the Army Green, so I could wear anytime of year. I would recommend, if the style is to your liking. Fairly priced @ 26.99 (with 10% off coupon) at time of review."
4.0,nice exactly as I wanted it to be seen in the picture is what sent<br />oh and I recommend good quality
4.0,Great water proof function. Sizes are about 2 sizes to small.
4.0,nice large but leather was not as plush as I had hoped and cell phone compartment is for old school larger phones. However the wife loved it so no problem very well priced.
4.0,Love them but the size was big - usually wear a 38 and these I can pull off easily without unsnapping them.
4.0,"I fall short of the 5 star review because of color only. I have bought this for an up coming international hike and need something roomy but easily traveled with. I can't say anything about durability yet. Seems  though the green pictured is more like lime. The actual product I received labeled &#34;light green&#34; is really military army green. I was looking for brightness but well it's ok. I can deal with it. Believe me if this falls short, I will update to reflect such. If in 3 weeks from today there is nothing updated then it's great."
4.0,"Great looking hat, though it fits a bit larger than the average hat would."
4.0,"Fit well for layering. I am just under five feet and they are a little long, I just roll them at waistline. Sheer enough to not be too hot under another top. I plan on buying more as there are so many colors! Fairly priced and feminine looking."
4.0,Great product.  So far so good.
4.0,"These work best on cloudy slightly drizzly days. Not good for sunny days, as they amplify the yellow light to an uncomfortable level."
4.0,"Whoever said these are small did not get the same product that I did.  I have a huge head.  Most hats do not go up to size 7-7/8.  These fit just fine with room to spare.<br /><br />But there are five in the phot, 6 in the description.  I don’t know what’s going on, but I got five."
4.0,"Very beautiful.  I only gave it 4 stars because the chain is very thin.  My daughter broke the chain on the second day.  However, the loop for the ""tree"" is large enough to slide on to an alternate necklace if needed.  It is rather a small design with dainty chain which is why I would recommend it for a young adult."
4.0,Cute dress but material is pretty thin and see through in a lighted spot. Overall really cute on though.
4.0,"Fits a little 'short' but, I am also quite tall and this is normal 'fit' for me!"
4.0,Beautiful dress but it's too short for me. If you want the long flowing look as shown in the advertisement this dress is not for you unless youre under 5'4
4.0,"Love the quality and fits nicely, I thought it might be short because of what other reviews said but it hits my knee."
4.0,"THIS A NICE DRESS TRUE TO COLOR AND SIZE, I BOUGHT THIS DRESS FOR MY DAUGHTER'S FRIEND BIRTHDAY AND SHE WAS EXTREMELY EXCITED"
4.0,"I bought a pair of these for my kids this summer and they were the goggles that they constantly fought over! The size adjusts quite easily and holds well. So I bought 4 more pairs to put in their stocking this Christmas! My only complaint is that the lens will scratch easily, but it does not seem to bother them."
4.0,"This Columbia jacket really did the trick for me in Italy a couple of weeks ago.  It's very comfortable and stylish on.  Did not feel like the Michelin man in it.  However, I wish I hadn't needed it until now, as the price is WAY down from what I paid.  Great jacket though!"
4.0,"I had the idea to purchase these for finger protection when I go out to shoot my longbow. They work very well and dont get in the way really. I use one at a time, so I do have spares for back-up."
4.0,Super comfortable but very light. Does nothing for the cold weather. Holds cold very well so if it's windy you're going to feel it. But being super light weight is great to be worn for spring and summer.
4.0,"4 stars for construction and manufacturer attention to details; and super fast arrival.<br />The shaft opening is advertised as 13"". My calves measure 13"" around. The boots I received are 15"".  I laced them up as tight as I could, and the boots were still too loose. My foot area was tight from heel-to-toe and the width was fine; but the shaft and ankle area was too loose.<br />I ordered a size larger than what I normally wear due to all the other reviews that said these 'run a little small', and based on what the size chart suggested. My calves are too skinny for these, and my foot is too flat. The arches are really high, and the shaft is really large. These are made for someone much heavier than me.<br />No matter what I did with the laces, they would not come out at the top, on top. There needs to be one less or one more eyelet or cleat. The laces are super long, at least one foot longer than anyone could possibly need.<br />I guess I need to order a size smaller."
4.0,Easy to inflate. Packs easily. Small and convenient.
4.0,Absolutely love this tank! Fit is great. I'm not one to wear cropped tops but this is just long enough to not show skin. Hits right above the hip in the front. The details on the back are super cute (ignore my yard work induced sun burn lol) I gave it 4 stars because it is a little on the sheer side and not really like you can wear a bra with it. I have pasties on but I'm going to have to ask the BF how much he can see out in the sunlight before I decide to really venture out of the house in this one or return it.
4.0,"I like this invisible strapless self adhesive Backless Silicone Push-up Bra. First off, I was very excited about trying out this unconventional bra. I wear 36B for normal bra, but as I read other people's review I thought this bra runs small. So I ordered size C cup. This fit me very nice. I hope the sticky inside won't fade out after few times usage. The main issue I was concern is this bra won't give you any push-up support. It basically just cover your ladies and push them to the center a bit. You shouldn't expect any push-up effect since unlike the normal bra this one has no strap to pull up. Also, the one I received does not have a plastic pouch....<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product at a promotional discount from the seller in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

4.0,"It arrived quickly in the mail, size was snug but I think since the ring is chunky in a good way, causes it to be slightly tight- but not too tight, it fits.  The color was Great, looks even better on!  The stones catch both natural & indoor light well, however the stones don't seem to be tightly set, noticed the main center created mistic rainbow stone is slightly loose?..  I have worn it alot & no color change in the silver plate yet, for the price decent peice of costume jelery.  Really like the over all setting & color, the purple smaller created amethist stones flatter the center stone."
4.0,"The Due East Apparel Women's Medium Support Mesh Cover Sports Bra is probably one of the best looking sports bra I have ever tried. It looks amazing even though I was sent the incorrect size. However, I am not going to let that detract from the my review of this product because I really like the quality and look. I have a large chest and It would be fine for yoga and low impact exercise, but not supportive enough for running. I ordered a size medium and was sent a size small and was somehow able to stuff myself into it. For reference I am 116 lbs  and 36DD. The size small looked like a push-up bra and I was spilling out of it. A medium would have been perfect. The wide elastic band fit my frame perfectly and If I were a B or C cup  it would have been fine.<br /><br />Pro tip: The crossover straps will be challenging if you try to pull it on over your head so step into it and pull it up as you would for shape wear. The inner pads are placed awkwardly and seem unnecessary. You can pull them out and the bra will look amazing."
4.0,"i am a medium usually (8-10) and so i ordered a medium even tho these are mens and when i first tried them, they were HUUUGE. however, they shrunk in the wash to exactly the size i was looking for!!!!!!! girls, follow your size. :)"
4.0,"I bought this shirt for my friend's son for his birthday, obviously.  It is made of quality cotton and did not shrink in the wash, nor did any of the image fade or peel off. I was very happy with that!<br /><br />The shirt, in black, did not fade and the stitching is good with no uneven seams or loose threads. Overall, this shirt is very nice and will last!<br /><br />The only issue I had, which is super minor, is that the image/transfer has a slight smell to it. It is almost like a rubber (latex?) smell and faded somewhat in the first wash, but not entirely. I anticipate that it will be completely gone with the 2nd or 3rd washings.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review!"
4.0,So seeing that this came to me I'm going to go ahead and fill it out but my wife says that she feels the purses a little bit bulky. But she did say it was a good quality for the price.
4.0,These were priced great. I wanted them for my 4/5 year-old pre schoolers. They would not stay on some of their noses.
4.0,Very thin material. good quality and stylish.
4.0,It is very comfortable I do find the material could be a little scratchy but it doesn't bother me too much unless you have very sensitive skin it's easy for just throwing on real fast so running quick errands
4.0,works and fits well but could use a little more structure so you're not getting the fabric in your mouth
4.0,"These pants are great. They look great and the quality is great, however, they are super long. For reference, I weigh about 170 lbs and I am 5'7. I ordered a size 10 and they fit around the waist fine, they are a little snug around the bottom but not so much that I feel the need to return them. (I need to lose some butt anyway.) But the legs are just so long. They force me to have to wear heals with them."
4.0,"smaller than we thought, but ok."
4.0,Giving it a 4 star. Metal and nice but not accurate to the originals because of the chain. Fix the chain and let us all know how to swap and I’ll change to a 5 Star.
4.0,"I've done photography with polarizers, these do not seem to be polarized.  Even so, they are nice enough that I raised my rating by one star, and am going to get another pair."
4.0,"The sleeves are a little long, bit overall the fit is as expected. It's not a really heavy sweater, but cozy on a chilly day. I love it."
4.0,keep making same product
4.0,Looks good and works
4.0,Love the pendant.  Very pretty colors.  Chain could be sturdier.
4.0,"Vey pretty dress. Didn’t fit, medium too small but gave it to my granddaughter"
4.0,I like 👍🏽
4.0,This shirt is super soft and comfy! The one thing I don't particularly like is that it is more fitted in the chest/bust area than the pictures show. It's kind of tight up there and then it flares out a bit at the bottom. It is a cute shirt and I will continue to wear it! I did get lots of compliments on it!
4.0,I like the design but its a bit big on me.  Being shorter than 6 feet will make this seem large on you.
4.0,I usually think I have a big head but I was able to tie a knot in this even though reviews said it was small.
4.0,"The waistband disclaimers were appropriate. I have fairly thick thighs and calves but the material stretches right over. My only complaint is the length. There was no indication of options for different lengths. Tight don't look great when there is an extra 2 inches of material bunched up on your leg.  I am 5'5&#34; and wear 30&#34;, 30&#34; typically for reference."
4.0,Love the size n look. Quality wasn’t the greatest but not bad for the price
4.0,"Cute style but didn’t care for the fabric and flowers were bigger/brighter than I needed to be wearing. I returned this, but only because I’m larger and it wasn’t a good look ON ME."
4.0,"I first ordered this in a Large (I'm a 38D and had read the reviews saying it was stretchy and ran big), but I still felt it was a little tight across my chest. I returned the L and ordered the XL in three colors (the pink floral, light blue floral, and navy blue with poppy-like blooms). All are the same, soft material, and all have that flattering racerback. I would have kept all of them (but.. overkill!), except for the fact that (1) they really are very long (I'm 5' 6.5"" and they brush the ground if I'm barefoot) and (2) they have some extra fabric under the arm hole that sort of flops around oddly. The dark blue floral did this the least (just luck of the draw), and it seemed less obvious on the darker color, so that's the one I kept. I will see if I need to alter it after I wash it... kind of hoping it shrinks just the right way so I don't have to bother! Other than that, I've now seen 4 samples of this dress and they are really cute, soft, easy summer dresses that arrived NOT wrinkled--I could've worn them out on a date straight out of the bag. In fact, if washing solves the issues of length and gapping under the arm, or if I lose weight and fit in the L, I would buy more without hesitation. Cute!"
4.0,pretty cool case .. bought it couple weeks ago and lost my phone with it on !! wish i could get my money back .. did not even have it for a full month
4.0,Fit was  just perfect! They're amazing for driving. I drive a mail truck all day and these work great!
4.0,The shirts are comfortable but they definitely are not a tight compression shirt. It is more of a drifit shirt that is close to the body.
4.0,works great. fits the tracker well.  the slot that you push the excess length into has a catch on top that makes it harder to push into or tack out of. (not the hole around the tracker).  Worth the money. Buy one of these because the one that came with your tracker will wear out and break in about 2 years.
4.0,VERY GOOD PRODUCT!!!
4.0,"It's a nice weekender, not necessarily my style but suits it's purpose. Very affordable, it's not painful if misplaced."
4.0,"Cute and comfortable but what a PAIN IN THE BUTT to get on. Once it's in though, no problems. It sometimes jingles when I move my head but it's quite comfortable and cute!"
4.0,It looks great but not high quality - strap will sometimes just open
4.0,I love this dress! Fit as expected & feels as comfortable as a well worn T-Shirt.
4.0,Hard to get wrinkles it but otherwise good quality for the price.
4.0,Work fine with prescription glasses. very clear lenses.
4.0,"These socks do what they say, stay up while you move in sneakers or a dressy shoe. But I wore them with low top leather booties and the heel detached after just steps and slipped under my foot, hello blisters.  They run a bit on the  smaller size, I got the regular size and they're tight in the toe area, I wear a 7.5.  Another reason to ding this sock one star, they're really thin.  I can see my toenail polish color clearly through the black fabric and I worry they may not hold up.  I washed and dried a few pairs of them and of course one tiny sock went missing."
4.0,"I got these for my one year old granddaughter. We hike a lot with the grandkids and wanted to make sure she had some eye protection. They are too big for her, but luckily she has a 5 year old sister who can use them. The sunglasses are good quality, nice material and durable. They are flexible and soft plastic so comfortable. Overall a good product, just a bit big for one year old, but good for toddler."
4.0,Purple color is more lavender. I bought for the color but this color will work too. Better quality than expected for the price. Sturdier than expected.
4.0,My little dancer says these are comfy and she likes the pass through toes
4.0,These seem to run bigger than the Jeffersons. Also wider. Not the cutest style for baby girls.
4.0,"I knew going into the purchase that it wouldn't be perfect and that modifications would need to be made. The nose was bent in shipping (as expected), but a few heat tool treatments has made it wearable. There is a ledge that lines the interior of the mask that scraped my cheek and forehead pretty badly. I went to a craft store and bought some adhesive felt and attached to the top edge and top of the ledge and I haven't had any scraping since. Is the mask perfect? No, but as inexpensive as the mask itself and the modifications I've made are I'd say it's worth it."
4.0,This is a great belt for the money! It fits well and is good looking. I have bought some one size fits all belts that leave too long of a tail so the shorter options this belt provides helps it fit properly. The only negative is that the buckle is a little heavy.
4.0,"I think they are fantastic, great looking slipper."
4.0,"Make sure you size up at least one if not two sizes. I'm usually a large and ordered a xxl. It fit really nice, but is longer in the front than I expected. The color is great and so is the fabric."
4.0,"Not bad at all, especially for the price. They are pretty small on your feet, so make sure you get the right size. I’m a size 9 shoes"
4.0,"Absolutely adorable and fits perfectly! The only complaints I have are that the shirt could use one more button toward the bottom, but what the hell, I can always wear a tank top underneath!"
4.0,smaller than I thought it was going to be.
4.0,"This coat is super cute and does its job in the rain. Sometimes I like to wear it on day where there's a nice breeze; however, this jacket is not made for cold weather. Normally I would wear an extra large, but as a girl with big boobs, getting a 2XL was a smart choice for it to zip up and still be comfortable."
4.0,This is a pretty cover up that will look nice with most of my bathing suits.
4.0,It’s an average cardigan. I feel it runs a little small. The stitching and fabric is not high quality but not terrible either. I will probably keep wearing it until I find a navy blue cardigan I like better. The longer length is nice.
4.0,We love snoozies but they are hard to find. These smelled funky when we received them so had to wash immediately.
4.0,"This cut of Momo Baby shoes is best for my son.  They are cute, comfortable and you can dress them up or down.  The wide toe area is the best feature.  The only downside is they are only available in whole sizes."
4.0,I would really love a full length lanyard like this !!
4.0,"I did like the shirt it was pretty and was flattering. However, it was a little small on myself. I would definitely size up."
4.0,"Nice quality, deep cap. Could be a tad bigger (I have a big head) but fits comfortable."
4.0,"Agree with the other reviewers… I ordered the five ask, because the 4X wasn't available. I typically wear a large/XL for coat size, so this arrived and was a little big, especially around the middle-- I did sew it to modify and create a waist in the jacket, and like it much better than when it was out of the box."
4.0,great watch but the strap is very small for a men's watch and the two best notches are either too loose or too tight
4.0,"The fit is fine, normal sizing. The fabric was a bit lighter than I thought it would be. Not like sweat shirt fabric like I thought. Pockets are great,color is a little lighter that picture (red). I like it!"
4.0,The plastic on the inside kept it from being a true size. It is very pretty.
4.0,This shirt was smaller than expected it also was not as clear of a picture as it showed.  The quality was very poor.
4.0,"Because it's advertised as flannel, I was expecting a brushed fabric, sorry to the touch.<br /><br />What I got is clearly a rugged, well-made fabric and shirt but it's definitely not flannel. More of a barn-jacket style twill.<br /><br />The single pocket is a tiny breast pocket on the left side just big enough to hold a business card or credit card/key card; the side vents are deep and mean that the back doesn't ride up as you lean forward to bike, or lift your small child, etc.<br /><br />The underarm area has mesh gussets that somehow are totally invisible during normal wear and also totally breathable.<br /><br />The left cuff has a very small bit of reflective piping that I didn't notice at first, but on experimentation, it seems to light up."
4.0,Nice sturdy cases for your specks
4.0,"I love these earrings. I bought the brushed gold to go with a necklace. The long wire keeps me from losing them. However, they are fragile. I dropped one and the wire broke off. Humble Chic sent me a new pair immediately. 5 stars for great customer service."
4.0,Good comfortable glove just wish the were better suited for working and riding
4.0,I like the bright colors and design but runs a bit small
4.0,"Even though its ALOT smaller than my other watches... I still like it.  Bought this for work, (medical Field ).<br />I would recommend it to others.<br />includes:<br />-Date<br />-Alarm<br />& chirps every hour<br />-light that only lights the am/pm and hour of the watch in the dark but you can still read see the full time. Sorta<br />Simple, yet does the job!"
4.0,Nice picture and material would give 5 stars but I noticed it runs abit small definitely would order a size up ......
4.0,"Small but sleek and discreet, the canvas of Brooklyn slim wallet feels like a small piece of luxury. The wallet holds about 7 cards easily and allows movement for the cards to be retrieved quickly. It's small enough to fit into a front or back pocket. It smells amazing as genuine leather always Does! It's the perfect companion for travel or camping as its light weight and compact. The only issue I had was the ribbon came out after 2 ties of taking my cards out, but it really only affected the appearance minimally. The cards still come out by squeezing the bottom. I was given a coupon code to provide honest unbiased feedback and all opinion is 100% my own."
4.0,"Love the sundress. It is somewhat snug through the bust but  is otherwise a good fit, length. So cool for hot days ; no slip needed.  My new favorite summer attire; have one in each color available."
4.0,"I received this bra through the Amazon Vine Voice program.<br /><br />It is true to size. Seems comfortable, the quality is pretty good, and the padding is supportive. I didn't notice anything to critique. Since I just received it, I need to wear it more. Right now, it seems fine :)"
4.0,Fits better than I expected. Like the look and feel of the fabric is soft. This is a well made quality garment. Exceeded my expectations.
4.0,I didn’t read the material description. They are very light weight pants. I thought they’d be flannel but they are a lightweight cotton. They are comfortable and fit great. I’m 5’7 & 130 and bought a small. I have no intention of even trying on the top. Not a fan of cropped tops… I bought for the bottoms.
4.0,they are pretty but my first reaction was they were smaller than i thought they would be.  With that said they are nice.
4.0,"Don't use it often, but when I do, it works to perfection.  The adjustments are precise, and the ability to use this and the strap at the same time works very well."
4.0,"I expected this to be open and flowy from the photos.  However, the seams from the armpits down past the hips not only keep it from moving much but made it snug around the hips (I am size 8, for reference, and ordered the one size fits most).  Bummed it didn't work out."
4.0,"I wasn't sure if it made me sweat until I took it off.. was very pleased because it is very hard for me to sweat.  I also like that it is very comfortable even though it pulls my body in to form, even my side boobs..lol, so breathing was not restrictive at all.  I don't believe it will last very long because it is sort of a thin material but I do like it."
4.0,"I really loved this skirt! just got it in yesterday and I can't wait for fall to wear it. I am a size 12 with a large stomach and the XXX-L fit me well, except it is a little tight over my derriere. However, it hides my stomach, and I feel great in it! For a 65-year old, I think it's a winner."
4.0,"These yoga pants have a nice, firm feel to them, with some compression from the fabric.  I like that rather than them being too stretchy.  They are comfortable and they stay where they are supposed to.  What I don't like so much is the print on the blue part.  I thought it was just a generic blue design and didn't realize how much the letters stood out.  I'd much prefer just a generic blue design.  I don't need people trying to read my legs.<br /><br />I got a medium and it fits well.  I wear either a medium or a large, depending on how the sizing runs, and I think these would fit most people who wear a medium as well as those who are somewhere between a medium and a large."
4.0,This bodysuit is very well made and looks great but it does fit a little small. I ordered this for my son and measured him to make sure it would fit. Once we got it we found it fit a little too snug especially in the crotch area.
4.0,"Old Gold  and not yellow!!! That  was my main concern. The brim is a little wider than I would like, and the top is a little high. Those are my issues. But the workmen-ship is great and the colors are perfect !!!"
4.0,"I'm typically a M/L, so buying this was a little bit of a risk, but I wanted a larger top and this one fit well, although it definitely runs small. So buy up a size or two and love your purchase!"
4.0,"Pretty dress, heavy material.  If you have a larger chest you will have a difficult time.  I’m a 38dd and typically a size 10, ordered a large and its too small in the chest."
4.0,I normally wear a 14 in a swimsuit (Sunset brand) and this suit is a bit large. I am returning this suit and will order a smaller size. This one was a XL and I will try a L.
4.0,"I love the necklass, the only thing I didn't realize when I ordered was that the face of it is white. I thought it was going to be all silver, otherwise I would have  give it five stars ."
4.0,We chose bigger size on purpose. Fit perfectly!
4.0,They will work as directed!.<br />Extremely comfortable to wear just lounging @ home
4.0,Fabric is soft and comfortable. Cheetah print is cute. Garment washes well. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that I wish it had pockets.
4.0,Glasses were broke when I opened the box! Went to dollar store and got some sunglasses. But everything else was good! He was so handsome!!! I give it a 4 star bc I had to spend a $1 lol
4.0,"I bought a medium size and it was too small at my opinion! I suggest everyone to buy a Large size to be more comfortable ! The quality is not bad even if the rubber band is a bit broken just after about 2 weeks . I think it's not a bad purchase , probably I'll buy it again instead of paying 25$ or more for other brands .. but the quality is almost the same and they're good for gigs the same :)"
4.0,"They keep my legs warm , they wore just fine. After wearing it for a little they felt like they would fall down a bit so that was kind of frustrating. I'm a small woman so its probably just me."
4.0,Really keep the glare from the Sun out of your eye
4.0,The horses head was not securely fixed onto the shaft.
4.0,Receive quickly!<br />Comfortable and thin material
4.0,"I bought it for my niece as birthday gift. It looks really beautiful. The chain is too long, so it needs to be adjusted. But it's not a big problem. When my niece wore it for the 1st time, the butterfly on the watch dropped off. We have to fix it."
4.0,"This is a nice chain. I wear it daily. Some of the color is fading on the clasp but other than that, no complaints."
4.0,Pretty and fun but the first one I received said something about containing lead.  Kinda worried me so I googled it and found that the amount in it is so minimal that it would not hurt anything
4.0,"I really love this dress. It is so comfortable! The only problem is that with wear, and I’ve probably warn it 5 times, the sleeves have started to separate from the dress. I will have to sew them and see if that helps. It is a little disappointing, but over all it is a great dress. Just watch out for the seams."
4.0,"Soooooo pretty, I was surprised how pretty it was.  My only issue was the inside was a bit small.  I have an iphone 6 and it was a tight fit.  But sooo  pretty..."
4.0,"The top fits slightly on the smaller side, but other than that there's no major complaints. Looks great and is quite comfortable. The material isn't super thin either, which is a plus."
4.0,"Pros:<br />My much worn hunter boots look much better. It got rid of most of the white powdery look- Perhaps a second buff will entirely remove the white and scratches.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Did not remove black scuff marks.<br />The print on the product label is extremely small, and is black on a dark gray background. I have 20/20 and was unable to read the directions.<br /><br />Warning:<br />I laid out a large bag before cleaning my boots. It was way too blustery cold to clean them outside. I briefly considered spraying them down on the shower floor;  thankful I didn’t or I might not be here today. Ha!<br />While there was no visible overspray, the wood floor near the bag is now extremely slick. I took a very hard fall, and I’m still in a lot of pain days later. Even the cats go sliding as they walk past. We have not been able to remove the slick spot yet, so I have blocked off the area from being walked on.<br /><br />I don’t normally write reviews but thought letting others know what happened to me was important. It could have been so much worse."
4.0,"It is definitely a very sturdy bag, but not intended for tall women. I'm 5'11 and the long strap, fully extended lands the purse just under my armpit. I can't reach anything inside without taking it off first. This is frustrating because I bought it as a diaper bag and I like wearing it during changes in public restrooms because it's difficult to find a place to put it."
4.0,I like how small it is...but i should have gone with a 20g(if thats smaller than the 18g). No complaints really..fast service.
4.0,"White parts are a bit see thru, otherwise its very comfortable and has yet to lose its form/color."
4.0,"Cute dress, but fabric does feel a little cheap and thin. I took mine to be altered to a more a-line shape. Long enough to be worn at work. I usually wear mine with a black slip to avoid any wardrobe malfunctions due to the fabric. I am 5'4, 135lbs with a 35 in bust. I bought a S."
4.0,I like it but it’s see through
4.0,Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase. The touchscreen ability is very good. Good value for the pay.
4.0,I thought it would be bigger but that was my own fault in misreading metric measurements.  It's a beautiful​ bag!
4.0,"Beautiful little dress, although it’s rather short, so my Little has to wear it more like a tunic length top. Fabric isn’t as pretty after one wash."
4.0,"Well, I have some good and bad points.  It seems well made, but the bottoms, especially, are like a size Small;  I had bought size Large to be comfortable though I am smaller.  Also, they say to machine wash but line dry.  I wonder if that is so it won't shrink even smaller?  The good points are: They are cute, they were a good price at least when I bought them, and they do breathe in hot weather, so you might just want to see if they are still priced well, clear more space to line dry them, and size down!  Oh, yes, it is a shame I have to say this, but I am not an affiliate for any company."
4.0,"This sweater is really cute, I have two of them.  I would give it a 5 but I am worried it’s going to get ruined eventually because the knit is not tight.  I can see it getting pulls."
4.0,"I originally bought this swimsuit in a small (I weigh around 115 lbs and am a 34 A cup) and the small was way too small. I ended up returning it but didn't buy the medium because it was double the price for a size up. But, the swim suit was very cute if bought in the right size! The top fit perfectly but the bottoms were way too tight. Other than the size issue, the suit itself is very pretty and doesn't look cheaply made."
4.0,"I ordered the Lapiz Lazuli......I like the macrame string throughout the bracelet, easy to tighten up without it breaking or snapping, and also I have felt alot more grounded since I started wearing it, I feel an overwhelming calm when things are very stressful around me."
4.0,Love the dress but it was a little smaller than expected & very stiff material.
4.0,Fit right just ok ring
4.0,Shrank a little after washing. Still fit. Did not put them in the dryer.
4.0,The necklace is really cute.  I purchased it as a gift.  The con is that it was much smaller than I anticipated.
4.0,Uno con desperfecto pero bien
4.0,Well made watch with features that a young boy likes.  Sturdy case and band.
4.0,These are cheap but cute earrings. I’d give them more money and a higher rating to pick my earrings. Overall can’t beat the value. Perfect for my beach vacation. I didn’t care if I lost them. And they looked cute.
4.0,"Great hat on its own, and decent sound from the speakers. No one nearby could tell I was listening to music. Charges quickly. It would’ve been 5 stars if it didn’t have a blinking blue light on the side - I wanted to wear it to bed, but the blinking light was so bright, it lit up the room."
4.0,"They work great. Only thing is that they are actually a little too big for me (especially the socks). I am a 7.5US and because they are a little big, my feet slide a bit driving the seams between my toes. So it hurts a bit sometimes when doing poses like downward dog. The same thing happens with the gloves. However, overall I would say I'm really satisfied with this purchase."
4.0,Stretchy!
4.0,Quick shipping great quality
4.0,I love the color palette! The socks are not the thickest ones but they thicker than the ones at Forever 21. The only down side is that one pair arrived ripped at the ankle. Kinda disappointing.
4.0,The print is really pretty in person. I would like it to be a little longer. But overall it serves it's purpose.
4.0,Colors match my coat perfectly!
4.0,Fit as expected. I'm 5'9&#34; 165-170lb. Not as long as I would like. Would buy again
4.0,Gorgeous. Though I ordered 3-- and I understand they wouldn't be identical as they claim to be hand carved but -- they are very very different.  One has gorgeous lines in the stone the other two are dull. But individually they're okay.
4.0,The fit was as expected but I have had problems keeping them from sliding when I run.  I usually don't dry my yoga/running garments but may try to see if the material will tighten up.  I love the look and the length was perfect.
4.0,"a decent quality material, nice colors."
4.0,Very warm hat but on the cheaper side. My toddler gently just pulled off the pompom. Also if you have a big head it won’t cover your ears.
4.0,"Product seems great. Dog owners: Take this as a warning. This oil and anything it touches becomes Magically Delicious and if your dogs are food motivated like mine, they will go to any length to devour anything that smells like it. Smh about to order more."
4.0,"I received tons of compliments on this dress!! I love all the colors, perfect for the Spring/Summer. I'm 5'2 208lbs. I ordered the Large, which fits my body. However, I made a few adjustments. My upper arms are big, so the sleeves are a little tight on me. The chest area of this dress is a little big, I used safety pins to clothes the gap. Will I keep this dress? YES! This dress looks amazing on me!"
4.0,"Like it, workout"
4.0,"Simple but nice<br /><br />Updates, it's still getting used almost daily and looks good, functions well."
4.0,"This wallet is very cute and the perfect size! 4 stars because some of the card holding slots are a super tight fit, but I would not consider them a deal breaker."
4.0,"This is really soft, and very thin (not a cheap thin, but just a lightweight shirt). It looks great with a cami underneath, and/or with a jean vest over it. The color is a really pretty mauve/taupe. Hard to describe...looks like the picture. It can be worn tied (looks best that way), or not (it will sort of hang down in front to a ""v"" shape. Washed/dried without issue. A great spring/fall shirt."
4.0,"I normally wear a size 4-6 and this fit me great, just slightly snug which is fine. Unfortunately I am 5’2” and these were way too long. I had to hem them at least 5 inches, but they are very comfortable and very flattering. I love high wasted bells and they are awesome."
4.0,"Love the look of the bracelet. The clasp is a little challenging for me, but overall satisfied."
4.0,Just a bit too long for my extra small daughter.
4.0,"Everything was perfect, except for one of the black ones."
4.0,"I have a older arcade belt and this was a second one I ordered for a trip. Had to return, because although the color photo appears to show a heathery gray, it was actually a dark basically black color."
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for my Mother and she liked it so well, she cried. I didn't see it as it went directly to her, but she said she was wearing it when she called to thank me. I wanted something in a neutral color that she could wear with a lot of things. This is the perfect length to wrap around the neck and be warm and cozy on a cold day."
4.0,"I followed the reviews and got a size medium. Im 5’8 135lbs. I personally don’t like long dresses and loved it for its shortness that can be adjusted and it wasnt too see through so I put spandex with it. I got compliments all night at my family reunion. The material is surprisingly good, but still don’t dry it in drier"
4.0,They are so cute. And she loves them
4.0,Fits great.  Beautiful hat
4.0,My girlfriend says it's Soft material. Doesn't dig into the sides and comfortable to wear on hikes. This same item could probably be found at Target for double the price or on the Wish app at half cost.
4.0,Good Father’s Day gift it’s a little big for husband wrist but still wearable.
4.0,"It's a cute, soft, comfy every day t-shirt. Bought XL. Fit but not tight."
4.0,"Quality material, about the right size."
4.0,Received our backpack in the mail today and LOVED IT!! The only negative is that the pencil holder loop is detached and frayed on the corner. :(
4.0,It's a nice hoodie. It is too small to wear over anything thicker than a t-shirt.
4.0,"Really nice sturdy band,  nice shine but ran small"
4.0,My father seemed pleased with the socks.He looks forward to using them.
4.0,"The color looks nice, thanks to the 18k real gold plated. It is layered on top of stainless steel. Let’s see how long that’ll last. It’s shiny and looks expensive from a distance. You can tell it’s budget-friendly jewelry when you touch it and see it up close. It’s a flat link chain style (Figaro). The jump ring is good. The lobster claw has a very minor gap. Not bad compared to others. So far it feels durable. It comes in a black pouch. I didn’t realize 4mm was so wide but my mom’s pendant actually fits through. This chain will not be wasted! Overall, it’s not bad for $5. Don’t really have any complaints. View it as a necklace that’s easily replaceable and not a long term investment."
4.0,Usually I get annoyed easily being wrapped up and my waist trainer movement but this isn't that bad. My only issue is that the strap across my back rolls up
4.0,"This jumper is very comfortable and I love that I do not have to press it.  I can pull it out of my closet and throw it on.  I am 5’3” and about 110.  The small fit well, it is slightly big on me but not horrible. The length hits me about 2-3” above ankles so looks cute with some wedges or straps heels."
4.0,I LOVE the style however the material is way too heavy.  With the thick elastic band and heavy material it is too uncomfortable.  I sent back.
4.0,It was just what my daughter wanted for prom. We also found a bracelet to match on here
4.0,True to size. Soft fabric. Perfect casual dress.
4.0,Excellent clarity.
4.0,"Beautiful coat, lovely design. I say yes. Perfect for rainy day or little chilly."
4.0,Color not what I expected but quality is good!
4.0,"The necklace is much nicer than in the photo.  The only downside is the chain is a bit flimsy, but can easily be replaced with something better. My daughter really loves it."
4.0,The material isn't too thin. I wore it to Zumba and it was enough support. I did order XX large and I am a 36C. If I went any smaller they wouldn't have fit so size up 2 sizes. Overall they are great for $6 a bra(I brought the 3 pack)
4.0,"These skirts fit according to size.  The fabric is comparable to t-shirt fabric but will probably work well with a slip so they don't cling.  They seem to be ok for the price.  Good, basic skirts."
4.0,Pretty watch.  Still have to figure out how to take out band links.  But then it will be fine.
4.0,"Its definitely more blue than green, but this workout set is SO cute! Its super stretchy and does not give camel toe. I'm always worried about that with tight workout shorts! The shorts also don't ride up when running/walking! The only reason I didn't give it the full five stars is because the top was a little big. It showed a  little bit of side-boob so I wore another sports bra underneath. Other than that, love this outfit! Wore it for the first time today and got a ton of compliments."
4.0,"So cute, quality is great. Rating it four stars because they haven't been used yet and I don't know how well they will last after a couple of wears. But as of now, they look great!"
4.0,Fit a little small but thankfully I read the review and ordered a size up.  Really cute and good quality for the price.
4.0,"inexpensive, but good enough for light travel"
4.0,These earrings arrived quickly and were really lovely and well made but smaller than I needed.  I would have liked the malachite stones to be bigger so they would be more apparent.  The silver was substantial and looked more expensive than they were.
4.0,Love this sweatshirt; it does run small so add a size for a good fit or add two if you want it baggy. I'm Typically a x-small or small & the medium fit me well. Not too tight or too baggy.
4.0,"The lense frames are slightly bent inwards so it's difficult to have a comfortable fit on my face. I also have a skinny head and these seem to fit a bit tight on the ears. I tried them while using on my computer and they do seem to take off the strain on my eyes. The lenses do have a slight yellowish color to when looking through them but on the outside they look very clear. That's not a problem for me at all. Overall, they look really good with minor issues. The fit on my head is the only issue I have right now."
4.0,"Worked well for my husband, but the satin ribbons require a very tight tie so it doesn't slip off."
4.0,"Cute shirt, fitted as expected. I was thinking it was more of a sweater type fabric but it’s more like a standard long sleeve shirt but it’ll serve the same function and it’s comfortable. I’m 5’4 and 140 lbs and the small fit fine"
4.0,Product itself isn't half bad but did not worked out for me! Perhaps my wrist is bit broad! Still shines!
4.0,"I bought this to use as a multi-use costume for the next couple of years. I was a witch this year. I am very pleased with how well made it is. The black fabric does have a bit of a sheen to it, so it's obviously not trying to be too realistic.<br /><br />I am 5'8"" and about 180lbs with most of my weight in my stomach. I'm also a 34G bra size. The large fit me just fine, the hem was touching the tops of my feet in slip on flats. The bust was a bit snug on me but not at all uncomfortable. The hood was actually quite large and did slip off a lot. Perhaps some pins to keep it in place."
4.0,"Great and versatile pattern. Top down knitting is much faster than knitting and assembling pieces.  Learning how to read the gauge charts takes a little time, but  once that is done it’s great to just photocopy the page, highlight the size, and knit!"
4.0,I got this as a gift for a friend and it fit perfectly
4.0,I purchased the dress to wear to the beach but it was too tight and they don’t carry anything larger than an xl. ☹️
4.0,Love the price point for these goggles. They fit comfortably on my face and look nice. They are a cheaper made pair but they are good enough for the casual rider. You get what you pay for with the brand name.
4.0,The only issue I have is the decoration came loose on the right shoe.
4.0,The length was a little shorter than expected.
4.0,I loved the pendant. It was a gift. I just hoped if the chain was a little better. It is a very low quality.
4.0,Fits well.  Washes great.
4.0,"Bought these for my 9 year old as she was having issues with other ones being itchy. I was hoping these being ""seemless"" that she wouldn't have that issue with them. The bottom part however isn't completely seamless, there is a sewn seam along the bottom inside. They are a very soft fabric that makes them more comfortable but she is still bothered by the seam along the inside. The fit is good, not too tight or anything. She is wearing them in the meantime but we are still searching for comfortable, non itchy training bras."
4.0,The dress looks exactly like photo. I ordered a large and it fits perfectly. I'm 5'3 and it is just above my knees. I wear 38ddd bra size.
4.0,The belt arrived quickly and seems to be a good quality. I like it so far.  I have worn it 3 times.  With that said and based on past experience it takes a good year to determine of a belt is really good or not.
4.0,good looking toe ring ... gave as gift still being worn years later
4.0,"I would give these a 4.5 if I could. They fit as expected and the material allows good ventilation, even though you can see the sweat (not such a big deal for me since the color I bought was the light gray). The 1/2 star off is because after some 3 uses the stitching on one of the legs started to come apart. They are very comfortable for running and yoga."
4.0,Great for kids who can't or dont have ears pierced. They are magnetic so even a brush will knock them off your ear. Then you risk losing thwm however I say it's worth it for a kid to have fun at home or feel special for a day.
4.0,"They are comfortable, thick and warm. The pill quickly but the cost is reasonable enough."
4.0,Good product but slow shipping
4.0,"This cute one piece jumpsuit came in just as described. Light weight, stretchable, and breathable. It is not see-through. Sizing was based on sizing chart and I found it to be very accurate. Pockets are an added bonus. This definitely can be dressed with a cardigan."
4.0,got these for my son when he goes bike riding.  Said it helps but still gets a little sore when riding in the woods
4.0,I replaced the wide silicone straps that had broken on 2 pairs of my daughter's swim goggles. I wasn't even sure if they were meant to be &#34;replaceable&#34;. My daughter claims they are comfortable and I love that they are adjustable. The spring clips hold tight and the end caps keep the tips nice and neat.
4.0,It is the perfect shade of purple. I really like the product. The top fits perfectly. The bottom is too large. I don't ever see myself wearing the product as sleep wear because I prefer natural fabric against my skin to absorbed perspiration. I bought the product for an event and it is going to  work well after I make alterations to the bottom.
4.0,Pretty shirt fit snug around the torso
4.0,"These sunglasses are so cute and fun for little kids, I got them as party favors/ pinata stuffers for my daughter's 5 year old birthday party. I did give them 4 stars instead of five because the animal prints are actually stickers stuck to the front of the sunglasses, not printed on like the ones I had as a kid. So, they look a bit cheap. All of mine were mostly stuck on well, there was one pair where the sticker front was a bit off center, so the sticker was a bit off the edge of the lens. But for my use it isn't a huge deal.<br />Value wise, I think you get comparable to similar sunglasses from party stores or similar. You might find cheaper sets at a dollar store or something, but they likely don't have the cute cartoon front.<br />Overall my daughter likes them and they're a huge hit with her friends at the party, I would get them again next year to add to our pinata again. It's fun for the kids to get something other than just candy when they hit it open, and these don't get wrecked when they hit the ground.<br />I did receive these at a discount for my honest review, but all opinions are my own."
4.0,"It was a little large and I have a large head. But otherwise, it is fine."
4.0,"Item received as shown in picture i love everything about the workout set: the material, the style and fit were on point. Would recommend and i would totally purchase other colors"
4.0,This bag is great I take it with me when I go fishing. I've dropped it in both ocean and river and as long as it was closed it floated and everything inside stayed dry
4.0,"Great bra to wear everyday, and fits true to size. However, after about 6 months i noticed the bra starting to wear down and be really loose. Definitely not the best quality bra but it does the job."
4.0,"Very pretty dress, just wish it was a little longer. It is an average length dress, I am just tall :/ Got the product sooner than expected! Pretty colors! Sheer, silky like material that is very soft!"
4.0,So much softer and nicer than I thought! Order true to size
4.0,"This looks great on and off of my beautiful wife. No, I will not post a picture. It seems well made and she has it after one season, so it seems good."
4.0,Very nice suit. Was just what i wanted. It was just a little undersized. Order one size larger and you should have no problems
4.0,"I ordered this in white. Overall, I'm satisfied with the order. The belt secures in the front on two separate hooks and feels fairly secure. The color seemed a bit off on this, though. The white is definitely off-white, which is fine, but if you're purchasing to wear with something white, that will stick out.<br /><br />I have a 24"" waist and this seemed to fit me well. Anyone smaller than me might have a problem, but it's very stretchy, so the product description saying it'll fit up to 29"" seems about right to me."
4.0,i thought they were both going to be the same size or else i would have just bought 2 sets
4.0,Longer than I hoped but great price and cute dress. I think it will be cuter when it is cooler paired with a denim jacket.
4.0,"I bought these to wear to my second trip to Hawaii. I wanted something comfortable because I knew that &#34;slippers&#34; is all I'd be wearing while I was there. These are fairly comfortable except the arch support seems to be too much. I don't know if its the bottle cap opener on the bottom, but still after I wore them for 3 months before even going they seemed too still in the arch. It sort of hurt my foot. I owned rainbow sandals that I liked way more than these.."
4.0,"Sending it back for a larger size. I normally wear a large, but this shirt I will need an xxlarge. But I'm buying again cause it's way cute!"
4.0,"Love this nice fit, top is more off whit than pure whit other than that nice dress"
4.0,"Fits smaller than expected for an XL but it's stretchy material and very soft. Launders well, I hang dry it because I don't want it to shrink. It's very cute and I would buy it again."
4.0,It was a nice item for a gift. Just not lush as my English friend would say.
4.0,"We ordered these for Christmas gifts for our daughter-in-law, daughter, and granddaughter. The necklaces are small and delicate, modest and fragile-looking but very attractive. After visiting South Dakota we wanted to share our discovery of the Black Hills Jewelry. Each necklace has an insert of the details and history of the Discovery of Black Hills Jewelry. The heart hangs to the side and is very delicate yet eye catching."
4.0,"I love it! :D The bar is a little bit short, which makes it difficult to open it when I want to take it out."
4.0,"They are great little swim shoes, just sent the wrong color. Recommend other than that!"
4.0,I really like this suit- very comfortable and cute! I’m a US size 6 and a medium was a great fit! Not too snug or too loose- a nice lounge fit.
4.0,"These undies are alright, but they definitely run very small. I'm 5ft 3in and weigh 83lbs.  I ordered medium thinking they should fit ok,  but boy oh boy they are too small. I will wear them tho they are snug cuz I don't want to go through the hassel of returning them. After all it's underwear and I washed them before I tried them on. Had I been able to see them before I would have gotten a larger size.<br /><br />I am going to try one more time and buy the large. They will either fit just right or they'll be too big. After looking at them again I've decided that for the money the quality is very nice.<br />So here I go again,  and I'll let you know how it goes ☺ 💃"
4.0,"Purchased red for Christmas time.  Love how easy it is to wear and adjust.  The magnet is a little thick and has to be maneuvered a bit to put through the clasp, but not a bigger.  So far, no snagging or loosening on its own."
4.0,"Summary Points:<br />* I did not have the tearing up/crying reaction as seen in videos (I only mention this if you are buying these for someone and don't get that reaction. Don't be disappointed; I still like mine). I will add to the point that you should have the person try them for 2 weeks before deciding if they like them or not. My first thought was &#34;I see colors differently, but we'll see if it's worth it.&#34;<br />* What stood out to me when wearing them was the green of the traffic signal lights. Certain reds on cars and buildings also caught my attention.<br />* I only bought them because of work; otherwise I wouldn't find them necessary. I work in the telecom industry and have to distinguish colors on cables up to 600 pair (Total of 10 different colors with lots of varying combinations). I looked to see if I could pass a colorblindness test online; I can't.<br />* Quality is ok. For the price, I expected more, but the case is seems high quality at least.<br />* Make sure you research how they work. They will not work for all people; I was lucky.<br />* Would be nice if my insurance would cover them (VSP does not cover them)"
4.0,"My daughter love this dress, the fabric feels very nice and washes well. Color is what was shown, the only reason I drop a star is because some of the word is spelled wrong. Overall nice dress, it seems to run a size smaller so might want to get a size larger."
4.0,Smells awful and feels short in shoulders but that may be due to pockets being high overall very warm and cozy perfect length and thicknesses
4.0,Beautiful earrings! Packaged nicely! No problems ...
4.0,Too big. Ordered a small and had to return
4.0,If I lost a few pounds I could wear it. It’s kinda see through. My belly button is definitely noticeable
4.0,This dress is flowy and comfortable.  I love that it has pockets.  It is not fitted (I am wearing a small).  I really like it with an elastic belt to bring it in at the waist.  The straps are adjustable.  It does fine in the washer and dryer on low heat.
4.0,"Comfortable, nice fit, no pinching, actually forget you even have them on. Invisible under my high waisted leggings."
4.0,Nice looking but very thin material.
4.0,The dress is very pretty. It is lined and the fabric is thick enough with the lining to be cozy. I like the style . They sent the wrong size so I will be returning it. I am very grateful for free returns.
4.0,"It wasn’t bad just not for grown women...21 year olds, have at it!"
4.0,very nice replacement band. only thing is i ordered lilac & received blue.
4.0,"Jeans are fine, probably should have ordered next size up"
4.0,Nice rings for price
4.0,"I wear a 38G or 38DDD... I ordered a large so it would be a bit tighter for support... Not very supportive but super comfortable, I can see wearing this around the house or to run quick errands or go for walks around the neighborhood, possibly even yoga... High impact running or other exercises might be out, colors are great and are vibrant as pictured has adjustable straps and again are very comfortable and easy to get on and off."
4.0,This shirt is so cute!!! I can't wait to wear it. The only negative thing  is the material is thin.
4.0,It fit just as expected.  It was light and perfect for  summer.  Only issue with product is it had a strong smell. Wash before you wear it.
4.0,Its cute but not for my (says my boyfriend lol) he doesn't like it because I'm too sexy apparently lol. But its loose in the top even with my push up bra but my butt was busting at the seams... for that reason I have to return it
4.0,"The pants look as described and appear well made. I followed their size chart found with the photos, but they ended up being way too big. I ordered the XXL, because their size chart indicated this as a match for my size. They are long; I'm 5'7"" tall -inseam 31""- and the XXL definitely covered my feet and then some. The weight of the lace bell-bottoms tend to pull the pants downward -they need to fit snug but not tight to stay up properly. Other reviewers stated these pants have a 'lot of stretch' to them. Believe the reviews!<br />My advice is to order at least one size down from their measurements' recommendations. I am reordering these in a size large. Would have been 5+ stars if the sizing wasn't so off.<br /><br />Update 2 weeks later:<br />Received the exchange; they fit so much better! From XXL down to size L."
4.0,"This umbrella is very pretty. The fabric is nice and the design is beautiful. But, the umbrella itself is not very sturdy causing some difficulty when trying to open."
4.0,These sunglasses are a great shade. Not too dark to wear in lower lighting. Versatile and comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Would recommend to others!
4.0,"My husband loves these, and the 36 x 32 I ordered fit him perfect!  These jeans have some stretch and he says they are very comfortable.  We both like jeans that have the ripped distressed look.  These jeans have a zipper front, button close at the waist, and 6 belt loops.  With regard to the rips, there are patches on the inside of the pants behind the rips so they don’t get any bigger.  I measured the jeans with a standard sewing tape, and the waist measures 35/5”, the inseam is 31”, front rise is 10.5”, and leg opening is 13.5” around.<br /><br />For the most part these are great jeans.  They look good and offer comfort.  However, there was one thing that stood out with regard to the construction.  The stitching on the seam below the fly is not sewn properly and looks like it may rip apart at some point.  It appears weak and I included a photo showing this.  Other than that, we both really like the jeans and I’m just hoping that the seam holds up for a bit."
4.0,Did'nt look at size was smaller than I thought.
4.0,Thought the bag was bigger other than that it was very nice. It was a gift for our daughter and she loved it. Happy with the purchase
4.0,But the medium shrunk to a small so we returned it and are trying the large.
4.0,"These are beautiful earrings, but the pictures are quite misleading. The gemstones look very purple in the pictures and the description even says amethyst, but they are magenta color. They are definitely more reddish/purplish pink than a true purple. They're also quite small earrings, but I do have to say they're very beautiful and elegant! Hopefully they won't tarnish!"
4.0,Feels great and fit great. Felt sturdy enough to save for next year.
4.0,Fit good needs pockets
4.0,I received this from my husband as a Christmas gift. Not sure it helps that much - I still dig it my bag for keys. A good gift for the woman who has everything.
4.0,Band is bad and be careful of scratches But overall its a sexy watch
4.0,"arrived as promised within a week or so, good quality but short for me as I am 5.10"
4.0,Fabric is thick and waterproof.
4.0,looks great~
4.0,I really like this dress very comfortable.
4.0,Somewhat cut wide in busy area but looks great and washes nicely
4.0,"Nice look, and good quality, but getting a small kid to understand the locking and unlocking of the zipper is difficult. The natural response is for the child is to pull hard against the tie and damage the zipper. I lost one of the ties on the first day."
4.0,"This mask is super comfortable and fits my face well. The material does muffle the voice and makes it a bit hard for others to understand me, but I don’t mind it. Unfortunately, I lost mine, but I loved it so much I just had to buy another to replace it!"
4.0,The foot fit is perfect and my granddaughters are happy they were too tight in the calf for me.  Such a fun idea!
4.0,"Made my Grandson happy, but I question the quality. It is short and wide, not the length one might expect of a quality garment."
4.0,The cap is a bit large for my head. I need a tighter fit. I also wish that it was adjustable.
4.0,"I have sensitive skin and had no allergy issues with this product over a whole year of consistent use. It has gone missing now and I will only likely not purchase again due to the fact that for me the prongs, that hold the gem in, would get caught on too many things."
4.0,"I was very happy with this dress.  However, I have a very short torso and the top seems even shorter.  I think if you have a large bust that this dress may not work for you."
4.0,I was in a hurry to get some hiking/warm boots for a last minute trip to Alaska.  I wasn't expecting much especially at this price point but I was pleasantly surprised.  Pretty decent for the price.
4.0,WAY SMALL SIZING. The 4T looked more like a 2T. I returned the 4T and ordered a size 7 for my four year old and it fits perfect.
4.0,I am 5'0 165lbs.. these shorts do not have any stretch at all and does not accentuate curves that well.. however I like the overall appearance of these shorts ..
4.0,Cute and fit great!
4.0,"Really love the look of these shoes, but they fit slightly bigger than my other 4 UK/6 US sized Converse.  I have wide feet so this came as somewhat of a surprise.  Very comfortable but they look a little big on me.  Converse shoes are unisex, and I'm used to getting slightly tight shoes as the canvas will stretch out over time anyway.  Regardless, they're an iconic shoe and pretty easy to pair with anything in my wardrobe."
4.0,These do the job but don't exactly hold the shoes on your feet very snug. I wouldn't run in shoes that were held on by these.
4.0,"Nice looking and well made solid construction. Hat includes a different replacement fan blade of fabric to use with smaller, curious folks with fingers. It seems to move just as much air as the hard plastic fan. It provides a cool light breeze to my brow in full sun."
4.0,Keeps my legs from swelling up.
4.0,"Dress fits really well, and seems pretty comfortable. It looks a bit funny on me, but not terrible. I'm still happy with the way it fits and the way it looks, things are never quite as nice as they look online once you get them in the mail. Looking forward to wearing it out on date night.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I got a great discount on this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. This discount has in no way affected my written review."
4.0,Perhaps a little too tight for my fat hands.  XL is what I purchased and the finger length is good but a bit snug around the palm.  I use them for surf fishing and they are warm and hopefully will last longer than my last pair with the Kevlar.  Only time and stripers will tell.
4.0,Black scarf with  beige polka dots can be worn with many outfits and look either regal or  casual.  Great buy!  Black is always<br />a  smart choice when you want only a few scarves to store.
4.0,I like it Nice shirt. I will wear thissummer to concert maybe with leggings or jeans shorts<br />Material ok too
4.0,"I am actually pleasantly surprised with how this shirt fit. To start with I’m 5 foot and 180 lbs. and I ordered a large, it was a little tight around the bust area(I don’t have a lot to work with there) and slightly tight around the shoulders( I do have naturally broad shoulders ). But besides that the shirt wasn’t extremely uncomfortable to wear, I would suggest going one size up from what you normally wear but I do plan on losing more weight so I will not be exchanging the shirts. I bought them in both black and white."
4.0,They look good and fit snaps tight but they need to be an inch longer just a bit too short otherwise they're great
4.0,"Very well made sunglasses, exceeded expectations, I was not sure what to expect when I ordered, not a brand I was familiar with. This is usually, something I have to try on in the store to see if I like it. Once they arrived, I realized it was a great choice. Everything came exactly as the picture described, a decent case, the glasses, a cleaning cloth. The packaging was quick and secure. Frame seem to be well made with no pinching on the nose. I would recommend these for anyone. I even picked up a pair for my son.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this item at a promotional discount price for the purpose of evaluation in order to form my own honest and unbiased opinion and review. I am in no way connected or related to the seller."
4.0,Love the color and think it is a great buy for the money.  I'll wear it with a sheer top over it.
4.0,The product is wonderful but runs very small. I'm 411 and 120 lb and I would have to order an L or maybe an XL
4.0,"I didn't like how the top rolled up in material, it stayed off the shoulder which was good."
4.0,The size was too small for the person that I bought it for. I kept is for myself and I love it. Beautiful colors and material.
4.0,This is a great product but I wish they made it in a long oval as well.
4.0,Fit well and cute on my granddaughter
4.0,"It is a beautiful dress. The color was more of a navy blue color than a sapphire blue. The size was a little small, but I could've made it work. I returned it based on the color and not anything else. Great dress for the price though!"
4.0,"2nd order.  Still like these mask for exercising, but they are a little thicker then the last set."
4.0,Fit perfect easy to attach.
4.0,It is sturdy and durable!
4.0,Ring is what I expected but the size wasnt quite right. I measured my finger physically in a store the same day I bought the ring and the one I received feels a bit too large. If my hands are wet it feels like it will fall off if I am not careful.<br /><br />The build quality of the ring is good and it hasn't shown any signs of scratching. Considering its supposed to be Tungsten Carbide this ring should never scratch.
4.0,I bought this for my brothers baby who is a bit of a chunk 😊 I did read the rest of the reviews on size but this thing is still way to huge! I only took one star off because it is still incredibly cute and a great bargain.
4.0,"Great value for the price.  Tactical looking watch, nice display with good functions."
4.0,These jeans fit great. I wish the waist were a little more fitted since it is slightly stretchy. My jeans had a bleached mark at the bottom of the left leg.
4.0,"Es exactamente igual a la foto. Bien material y cumple el cuadro de tallas. En mi hijo de 15 años quedó ajustado:  Estatura : 190 cm, 75 kilos de peso. Cintura 75 cm, Cadera 98 cm."
4.0,"Adorable dress.  The fit was as expected.  I did order a size up from what the recommended size was based on the size chart and that seemed to be a good move.  I always do that when there are buttons on the front of a dress through to avoid gaps when it's buttoned.  I love the color and the buttons are super cute little hearts!  The belt is not attached so you can choose to tie it in front, or in back or just remove it and not wear it at all (or add your own belt if you so choose).  The belt can also make a cute matching hair accessory.  I love the hidden side zipper.  My only complaint is that I wish it were just a few inches longer.  I'm 5'8&#34; and prefer skirts and dresses go just below the knee, this one goes just above. I plan to wear it more with tights and a black cardigan in the fall and winter.  The fabric feels very nice, though thin.  It was wrinkled upon arrival, but hanging it up helped to smooth it out.<br /><br />All in all I am happy with the purchase and I would order from Anni Coco again.<br /><br />I did receive this at a discount for my review, however that does not change my thoughts."
4.0,Loved the skirt. Fits well and looks great on my curvy figure. I had to remove one star because I had to fix the zipper. Too cute to return!
4.0,I like it overall. Thought the diamonds would be a bit smaller but overall it's a nice ring.
4.0,"easy to use, a little thin but secure."
4.0,My grandson is 2 and he can walk in them with no problem. They are lightweight and he seems to be comfortable
4.0,The earrings are very attractive. You can them wear at occasions. I love them. Certain attention required. They 've got loose easily.
4.0,A little big but comfortable!
4.0,fits great thank you
4.0,The bangle is a lot bigger than I thought it would be. It fits snug around my upper arm. Otherwise good quality. I only use the bangle and removed the tassel.
4.0,"My baby is 6 months old and has been wearing these socks for a few months. These are very soft and warm. The toe-heel length is fine, but the fabric above the ankle seems a little too short."
4.0,"First I have ordered 8.5 based on my original size. But, it was too small. Then, I ordered 9.5, which totally fits! It came in its original box! The shoes are cute, and it feels comfortable."
4.0,"The necklace charm is nice quality and matched exactly to the picture. Only giving four stars because this was a gift, so I can’t speak to how well the chain and clasp operates."
4.0,Cute. Not much else to say. Thought they would be a bit bigger.
4.0,THESE ARE VERY NICE. CAN ALSO GO OUTDOORS WITH THEM. THEY FIT WELL AND DO NOT LOSE THEIR SHAPE.
4.0,"I like them, nice and soft"
4.0,Very comfortable. Band a tad loose. The cup also had a usual issue of being empty at the top. Straps stay up. Wish the fit was better.
4.0,"Other than that it's a pretty cool shirt, durable."
4.0,"Almost as the real thing! They catch on my belt, metal water bottle but good for the money."
4.0,It’s much bigger than I expected and I find myself not wearing it. It’s soft but just too much fabric.
4.0,This purse came a mnth early. Was pleasantly surprised and it's beautiful. Going to rock it on my wedding day.
4.0,This is a nice tunic style top. The fabric is a lightweight knit with stretch. The cutouts on the sleeve are a fun design detail. I found the fit to run a full size small. You can choose your normal size for a bodycon fit.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
4.0,Siempre pida una talla más
4.0,"Welcome to comfort! This sweater reminds me of a warm and favorite blanket- Just without the look of wearing bed linens when you enjoy its creature comforts!! Such a cozy softness is in the buttery chenille.. It truly feels delicious! This shows quality in both its design and construction.<br /><br />This is a nice crop length- not short, it’s slightly tapered.. This top gives you a proper amount of coverage to fall into place at the waist without causing excess bulk thru the mid section.. Ha! who wouldn’t love that!? Sleeve length is ample- mine hit just below the wrist bone- note: sleeve edges are finished but they are not cuffed<br />Neckline is made with a ribbed collar edge to help keep its shape and eliminate it from becoming stretched out! (see photo of neck up close)<br /><br />Although this isn’t a thick pile or chunkier sweater.. it will bring plenty of heat! Definitely an option to use in winter wardrobe (one that can even be layered.) TBH, the only specific I didn’t care for is the cable knitring on the front side. I realize this is just a personal preference but, I prefer the sleeker line. Cable knit has a “rippling effect” and I don’t need help in that dept.! Especially down the front of the sweater.. not a dealbreaker- but, something to be aware of.<br /><br />Overall, The soft comfort is a welcomed addition to my fall and winter options! Hoping this info can help your decision- stay safe.<br /><br />(For reference: ordered L and I’m a 40 something yr. old, 5’2”, 153, 38C, 30x28- if this helps to choose sizing!)"
4.0,"cute and cozy, but I ordered in baby size and toddler size and they were all the same size."
4.0,"Me agrado, pero me gustaría un poco más ajustada"
4.0,"It looks like a reasonable cut for any age, but it felt like it is more for a teenager than an adult female.  It fits ok and is reasonably made for the price, but I'm not likely to ever wear it."
4.0,This sweater is lightweight and very comfortable. It fits as I expected. However it doesn't really look like the picture. Still pretty cute.
4.0,I bought this just to wear at home because I'm too tall to wear this as a dress. It's mediocre fabric that is somewhat see through. Good for hanging out in but nothing formal. I'm happy with it for my intended use.
4.0,"Very well made and looks like silver.  I t looks great on but due to individuals different ear shapes, I had to make it a bit tighter to keep it from slipping off.  I would recommend this regardless.  I enjoy ear cuffs but don't need more holes in my head than I already have.:)!"
4.0,"I love this jacket. It's comfortable and exactly what I was hoping for in fit. At first, I worried the image printed on the back is a little low, but when the hood is down it makes sense. It doesn't look awkward."
4.0,Fit correctly true to siz them these since high school.. They r super soft an comfy so no complaint love these
4.0,"Very Pretty! A little larger than expected, but isn't it usually the other way around? I think it would look very flattering on a girl's / ladies hair pulled back on a more formal occasion. Since I don't attend many of those anymore, I believe I'll save it for a younger ladies gift.  It's just as pretty as pictured."
4.0,"At this price this watch is awesome! Looks great, keeps time,  good deal."
4.0,as expected  sturdy  has lasted a couple of years with great wear!
4.0,I love the overalls but they were a little big on me I ordered a small and I am 5'3 140 lbs I could have sized down forsure.
4.0,Overall I really liked this bathing suit.. the only thing about it I didn’t like was that the boob area is a but large while the rest of it is a little tight. It does have adjustable straps.. would definitely recommend ordering a size up.
4.0,Loved the dress fit perfectly also looks just like photo going to be perfect for the wedding I'm going to
4.0,Was a little bit. Have to wait to grow in.
4.0,Kid loves the glasses
4.0,It's cute. The color isn't as noticable as I expected and I thought it would be a bit smaller (closer to my nose) but overall I am pleased with it. My boyfriend and my mom think it is cute. It's a tiny bit hard to hook into place but I think that's good because at least it is unlikely it won't come undone and fall out.
4.0,I bought two of these. One purple and one teal. I am happy with the purchase. I have not tested the RFDI blocking yet.
4.0,"The masks work fine and the value is worth it but I bought these for my kids. They fit them but were a little small but not by much, the wife and I couldn't wear them but they were good for the kids."
4.0,The shoes are comfortable but i am given it a 4 because the back strap does not do anything to hold your feet in.
4.0,"The clip on the keychain feels cheep, although the tag is very nice."
4.0,The top of it is suuuuper cute! Not sure how I feel about the asymmetrical waist... it feels a little loose at the waist too which doesn’t help. I’ll see if I can take it in a bit because everything else about the dress is great and fits perfectly!
4.0,"Great tunic but I must confess snug around my hips.  That said, I need to lose weight and have a big butt so alot of things fit snug there.  I'm a solid 14 in pants."
4.0,"I use this thing all the time.  especially at work when i have no pockets but don't want to carry a purse when i run out.  It is ok.  People can tell where the hidden pocket is as it bulks out when you have anything more than cash or a card in there.  If lets say you put an id or passport, it's easy to tall.  Also this need to be a bit long.  I feel like i am choking when i double this up so i just leave it dangling."
4.0,This is a cut mask it cuts my eyes
4.0,"I really like this handbag.  I find it to be of a good quality and affordable.<br /><br />The gold detailing is very nice and adds a touch of elegance.  The bag has nice gold colored feet on the bottom, which keeps it from getting dirty on the bottom.  The gold/black lock dangle is a nice accessory that adds more style to the bag.  It comes detached from the bag, so you can leave it off or add it onto the gold hook<br />.<br />The bag comes with a crossbody strap; however, I do not use the strap because I find that a bag this size is not ideal to be worn in that manner.<br /><br />The bag comes with 3 zippered pockets, 2 of which are visible when looking down at the purse.  There is a side zippered pocket that spans the width and length of the purse and a center zippered portion.  Both of which have the golden zipper detail.<br /><br />The side zippered portion extends from the top of the purse to the bottom of the purse.<br /><br />The middle zippered portion serves to divide the larger purse area into 2 large sections, however, it does not reach all the way down to the bottom of the purse.  It is more of a flapping pocket that is attached to the top to middle of the center of the purse.  So items are very likely to move from side to side within the purse.<br /><br />Also, the bag does not have an overall closure.  So anything that isn't kept in a zippered pocket can potentially fall out.  However, the tightness of the purse opening has prevented my larger items from falling from the opened purse.<br /><br />The lining of the purse features the typical cellphone pockets one side and the small zippered pocket on the other side..<br /><br />The bag does not expand very wide as you can see in the picture.  I cannot put a lot of things in this bag and still expect it to keep its nice structured shape.<br /><br />The structure of this bag is a large plus in my book.  In my opinion the structure of the bag helps it to look very quality and professional.<br /><br />I purchased this bag at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  All opinions expressed are honest and mine."
4.0,"It’s a comfy shirt and is mostly well made, but the fabric in the picture looks like sturdy linen and the actual product is VERY sheer cotton. It’s fabulous for summertime but definitely be aware that ***it is completely see-through***"
4.0,Cute outfit but I wish the bra had a bit of elastic in the straps
4.0,"Irregular/flawed. Stitching line not straight.<br />XL fit like a medium.<br />Fabric is very soft and heavy enough not to completely see through.<br />This does otherwise appear, surprisingly, to be an official The Office licensed merch. It is missing the NBC tag, which furthers my belief it is an irregular discard. So for $6, it's just fine, and perfect for a collector."
4.0,Well made socks but were a little heavier than I expected.
4.0,"Launders well, but the sweatshirt waist is short-waisted."
4.0,The style of this ring is super cute and it has an adjustable band. I wish the round design part was smaller though. It's a little bulkier than what I normally wear.
4.0,It's perfect only problem I had was it came 4 days after the day it said it would be here other than that I recommend it
4.0,"I like mostly everything about this bag. It is lightweight, durable, nice color, perfect size, and has a lot of pockets. The only problem is that when the shoulder strap is set at shortest length, it doesn't stay flat. But that's a small item compared to all the things I like."
4.0,Looks good but hopefully they hold up well over time! Good value so far though.
4.0,Cute dress...but I’m not Irish and didn’t see myself wearing it more than once...
4.0,It’s worth the money big? Yes but who I’m I to complain ✨
4.0,Nice set of keychains. I especially like the fact that they have two rings on them so that I can designate one for office and one for home.  Very handy.
4.0,I only tried it on and not yet been swimming in it. I ordered a size too big and it fits nicely. Makes me look a little slimmer. I'm 5'7 and 168 pounds.<br />Love it so far.
4.0,"I love them , beautiful color, will order another pair."
4.0,"I've had my nose done for along time but haven't had any nose rings. So when I saw this cute heart shape one I said why not start wearing a nose ring again. This set comes with 40 nose rings, is heart shaped and comes in purple, white, black, pink, clear, red, blue and green. The size is 2mm, 20 gage acrylic bone screw.<br />I got my order quickly and all the pieces are there. Some are a bit longer than others but they are plastic so i can always file it down or cut them. They are very bright, the colors are great. I have been wearing one everyday since I got them. I've never had plastic nose rings before but they seem to be just as good as the metal ones. They are super cute and I love them. Recommend!"
4.0,Beautiful but very tight at the neck. So couldn’t use it for the wedding intended
4.0,"I love my leopard leggings, but they run big! I am normally a large, but I needed a medium for sure. Quality is perfect!"
4.0,Good material.. I am 5.7 and 160.. I should order a medium.. although it works nice during pilates class.
4.0,Very cute. Bigger than I expected.
4.0,bought as a gift for my dad it was alittle big but he likes it
4.0,"The shades are incredible dark. Actually makes it hard to see through when driving. All in all though, very fun and sexy pair of oversize shades. Very happy with my purchase. Great price."
4.0,I really liked the sweater and the way it fit but it did take a long time to receive.  I finally rec'd it about 4 months after I ordered it.
4.0,Perfect fit and looks true to picture shown. Very flattering
4.0,"These Big Head sunglasses are aptly named, theyre SPACIOUS! (I need glasses that are at least 6"" wide, and these fit the bill!)<br /><br />They're lightweight, and mostly comfy, except that the behind-the-ear ""hooks"" are placed a little too short for me -- they pin the glasses too my face, which makes them a little uncomfy, but in a way i think i'll get used to."
4.0,Fits as expected and comfortable. I was sure to measure my head rather than go just based on my usual fitted hit size. Only complaint is that the material making up the top of the isn't symmetrical causing it not to lay quite the same way on both sides. A little tugging after putting it on my head allowed me to balance it out. For the price it's well worth it.<br />[[ASIN:B016V1DS28 KBETHOS W-317 Men's Ivy Hat Collection Herringbone 2 - BLK - L-XL]]
4.0,Very elegant for everyday office use.  The center stone setting is safe even when you are constantly working on files/folders of documents and looks real with its size and sparkles.
4.0,Nice light watch that keeps time quite well!
4.0,The only problem...the button placement is at the cheek/sideburns area and not at the tip of the ears. I have to remove the buttons and reattach where a mask would fit over the ears.
4.0,Very nice seems to be well made .. packaging was over the top
4.0,Good size. I had to get an organizer insert or my things would be in a pile. Nice shape and easy to carry. I guess I wish it was pleather. The cloth is okay but not as classy as a leather look. Pretty color.
4.0,Nice glove but only good to about 25 degrees f. Fit runs a little small.
4.0,I bought these for our 10U hockey team for their bags since we are a travel team. I added decals to them with a hockey stick and the players number. When they arrived they arrived fast with prime shipping. There was 1 that was cracked when i opened the package. The durability is good for the price they arent the most expensive or well produced item but overall I did like them. They are handy as well as easy to use. Definitely will purchase again when needed.
4.0,I LOVE them. They're very comfortable. The size did run small so I ordered a size larger and they fir perfectly.
4.0,"Looks nice. The interlocking circles are actually 1 piece, attached to each other, not separate circles. I like that you can adjust the length of your necklace cause there's 3 eyes for the hook."
4.0,"The ship out of country so they do take a while. Original set was lost and the seller shipped me another pair without any issue-i was very pleased.<br />Very cute earrings. The star is actually hooked to the earring back, they sent with double eating back. So you can place the chain in front or begging the ear lobe."
4.0,"Beautiful top!. However, It did not fit me very well. I am 4’11” and the top part hung too low. I was disappointed but not because of the top appearance; I have this problem with most tops but can usually alter them. Very elegant and beautiful top."
4.0,This is a cute hat that is packable.  This is for trips to the beach rather than walking around town. Getting the creases out is kinda difficult.<br />Not a fashion hat imo.<br />Great for gardening and chillaxing in your backyard.
4.0,"I like the purse, but, the color is a bit of a fire engine red, I would have liked it a little deeper color... but, will keep!"
4.0,They worked awesome! Snapped right in.
4.0,They are cute. My daughter loves them. Only down fall not properly package so the case was cracked.
4.0,don't like how it fits.
4.0,"For sizing reference,  I'm 5'7"" and 127lbs.<br /><br />There is a sleeveless version of this shirt that I bought on Amazon a while back and liked a lot. The only issue I had with it was that I got it a large when I should have ordered a small. Not a big issue because I can wear it as a vest over a small jacket or long sleeve shirt and it still fits.<br /><br />I used what I learned from that purchase to get the correct size (small) of this short sleeve version which I wanted because it would work better with arm warmers. The shirt itself has good ventilation and is very light. My one complaint is that the pockets on the back are a little small. This was not the case on my sleeveless one so I wonder if the pockets get smaller when you size down? Still happy with the purchase though, solid overall."
4.0,"It's nice looking and is very sturdy and should last a real long time. It's a great match for the S3 Frontier. My only negatives are that because of the thickness and stiffness of the woven band, it doesn't feel that great against the wrist bone after wearing it for a while. The stiff weave against that wrist bone can cause some irritation after a while and you can't get it to fit as snug as a leather strap. It can shift around a little. Also wish it was a quick change band. It's harder to release the pin because of the lack of flex if you want to swap it out with another. When I received it, it had the wrong pin tool with it. I notified V and received a response the same day and the correct tool a few days later. So points for excellent service."
4.0,"This romper fits well, once washed. The material is stretchy and comfortable, but not forgiving. I ordered a small and it fits as expected, but I'm on the slimmer side. The quality is okay - it is what is expected of an online brand that is cheaper than it's competitors like Romperjack and Romphim. Otherwise, I will be purchasing two more of this for my upcoming spring break vacation!"
4.0,"very well made and ok to 15 degrees, I hope they hold up, to new to tell yet.."
4.0,"Very high waist, very low leggings, would fit perfect if I was 9ft tall"
4.0,Runs a little short but nice and fits large 38 G cups
4.0,Great shoe!!! My nephew loves them.
4.0,"Love the lightweight feel and the regal flow of this gorgeous royal blue duster. However, the sleeves are incredibly baggy and misshapen. I would recommend a size smaller than you normally wear, for a natural (not fitted) fit"
4.0,I bought this in an XL for a friend. It fits more like a medium/large. So I had to keep it (Darn).  Love it though. I get tons of compliments.  But I would order a size or two larger.
4.0,What do you say about laces???
4.0,Purchased two for two of my daughter's. One daughter is tall wearing a size 6 women's and the other is petite wearing a size 0. I purchased a medium and large as it says to size up. Well my petite daughter is wearing the large and my granddaughter is wearing the medium. Worked out that someone could wear them.
4.0,This dress is very pretty and fit very well.  I was very surprised to discover that the back bodice of the dress did not have the  same lace and trim as the front.  That should have been shown with the description. As such I would not wear the dress w/o the jacket and for that reason I'm giving this a 4 star rather than 5 star rating.  My return was well handled and very promptly credited.  I would order from this company again but would ask to see all views before doing so.
4.0,"I only wear the shorts, the top is too small on me. I wish you could choose the  size separate"
4.0,Cute skirt just need to order a size up. Runs small
4.0,Fit well and is comfortable.
4.0,These work great for my little leaguer!  Durable and comfortable on the field.
4.0,Beautiful but fabric should be more thick so it’s not see through
4.0,Hard to see. Otherwise has a very smart look.
4.0,This is a very nice belt. The belt itself is thick material and seems to be well made. It is very nice looking it looks good with jeans and also when you are dressed up. It fits well the buckle is nice and thick also looks great. I have no complaints about this belt. I really like it.<br />I received this at a discounted price for my honest review
4.0,"I use this as a night hat actually b/c my head gets cold at night and I want to listen to music/tv before bed on my ipad.  Works great!  Sound is crisp, even with the speakers off of my ears by a little so I can lay on my side.  Wish it was made of less scratchy material."
4.0,Very nice to have scarf to represent all our different  cultures .
4.0,If only the motorbike Silhouette was larger I would have given it 5 stars... it was tiny.
4.0,"These pants are amazing. But I am 5’9” and they ran a little short to my liking. They hit right above my tennis shoes while wearing. While this may not be a problem for some, being tall, I like my pants to hit at my shoes if they are considered full length and not Capri or crop, etc."
4.0,Somewhat flimsy but it's just a costume.
4.0,"Good product. The neck should extend farther, then it would be ideal, and have gotten the 5th star."
4.0,"I would say this a great daily wear backpack. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because I expected a brighter white stripe, it was slightly dull white. And I would have liked external bottle pockets. But it definitely fits in my 17oz swell bottle inside. So it’s overall a great bag with good padded straps."
4.0,"I got this for my sister for Christmas, because she loves hoodies.  She also loves cats, so I figured that she would think that the cat ears were cool.  What I didn't realize was that this was a ""crop hoodie"", which means that it's almost like a belly shirt hoodie.  That's my fault for not properly reading the description, so I won't give it a bad rating for that, but just don't make the same mistake that I did.<br /><br />It fits about as expected for a crop hoodie, but it's very thin (it almost feels cheap).  The image of the ""Dirt"" album is cool, but it's not the greatest quality.  If you're specifically looking for an Alice in Chains crop hoodie, then this should be fine, but if you're looking for a regular hoodie, make sure to read that description!"
4.0,Frame was a bit flimsy and lenses kept popping out. But other than that they were amazing fit the frame of my face and they don't slip off of my face
4.0,"These are a nice light weight summer sock. I would’ve given 5 stars, but one pair in the pack was super constricting and stringy and uncomfortable. The other pairs are very soft and comfortable."
4.0,"They're typical masks. Not thick, not thin. I mainly ordered them because of the colors."
4.0,Not material expected but is a good buy
4.0,It’s very pretty. It is a thin material but it’s soft.
4.0,The mesh bracelet catches on a lot of my clothing so I'm  careful what to wear it with but it looks nice and is easy to put on.  I like the little crystal details on the ends too.
4.0,Good headbands- ride up a bit in the back but overall good for the price. Would buy again
4.0,"Best hood on a winter coat ever. Loved everything else about it, except had defective zipper. I contacted customer service and they reimbursed the cost to have a new zipper put in!! I love the warmth, fit, length, Hood, color, style...and great customer service! Thank you"
4.0,Nice...wife was happy. Photos didnt show the interior of purse so was nervous. Strap could use more holes
4.0,"I wish it came in 5X.  The 4X fits snugly, and as I am on the weight loss track, will be okay, but really wanted the color in 5x, come on Joe's, help a fat hippie out here!  The color is as advertised, quality good."
4.0,"Top fits great, bottom a little loose, not a tight fit for us small women."
4.0,"Cute colors, fit me great!  Most yoga socks are too small for my size 10 foot - so yay for me!  The little gripper dots on the bottom do come off pretty quickly - so they won't continue to be grippy for a very long time.  One tip - wash and drip dry - will help to keep the gripper dots longer."
4.0,"Haven't had very cold weather yet, but for temps in the 30's and 40's these gloves work fine for warmth and can use the iPhone touch screen with no problem."
4.0,It's a shirt. Fits about right. Seems like decent quality. And it's a shirt.
4.0,I like these except the heel.. they ride up a bit but I do like the way they look and feel.
4.0,"I love this suit and I get a lot of compliments on it! It fits well, stays snug to my body. The material is the same as a wetsuit, so on hot days, the suit holds heat."
4.0,"bottoms fit a little larger than expected. buttons were not sewn tight so I had to adjust them upon purchase because I didn't want them to fall off. Otherwise, a very comfortable bottom!"
4.0,"Would have been 5 stars, but the color ran in the wash. Skirt color bled into bodice. A real shame because it is a gorgeous dress and very comfortable to wear."
4.0,"The hat is cute and looks like the pictures. However it fits a little snug, which is fine for me; but anyone blessed with a larger head or a lot of hair should look elsewhere. The ribbon slides up constantly, but that can be fixed with a little glue.<br />Overall it's good for the price, but if you can spend a little more, I'd suggest doing so in order to find something higher quality."
4.0,Great dress for a nice night out :)
4.0,"Inexpensive polarized sunglasses, after I wore them I purchased a  second pair of amber  color ."
4.0,"It is a nice jacket, bought if for our son in law. My complaint is the amount of time it took to receive the jacket after order. Additionally the zipper seems cumbersome at the bottom. Hopefully this will break in over time."
4.0,Top a little small but wearable.  Bottoms fit great except to long.
4.0,"A very, very pretty blouse!!<br />Loved the unique color and feel of the material. It felt very soft, but can cling to the skin so I’d definitely recommend using a dryer sheet to prevent that from happening. It also fit a little snug around the chest.. so if you’re let’s say.. a larger Medium, I’d go ahead and order a Large.<br />Other than that, I loved it!!"
4.0,"Very cute crop top, especially with my high waisted pants. If you like a looser fit like I do, definitely size up. It's also not super sheer like I feared it might be."
4.0,"I tried it on once I got it and it is Asian sized so buy bigger.  Tried it on a few days ago and the string came off the top, which would be an issue for most but I'll just put a stitch in it and it'll be fine."
4.0,The colors are super vivid which I love. It was thinner than I was expecting but still worked ok. There’s not a lot of stretch in the fabric
4.0,"I love runes and was excited to get this. Mine does not quite look as pictured though. First off, the brownish coloring is going to have a little more red in it than it looks in the pictures. The ring is really just a rough piece of metal and just does not look as good to me up close as pictured. Also, I can hardly see the runes on mine. In the picture and in one of the review pictures, the runes look almost like they are inked black or at least stand out well enough for a picture. Mine look very slightly etched in, and there is definitely no ink to show them off. I like the ring; I just think mine would cause some to get a little agitated at the look. I had to take off a star just because I am having to use a flashlight and magnifying glass just to see the runes well."
4.0,Nice top.  Great for layering.
4.0,"Very cute dress!  I took 1 star off because the ruffles were sewn up which made the ruffles pointed upwards which give the dress a &#34;foo-foo&#34; look which I didn't quite like.  After I took off stitching so the ruffles could be ironed down, it was much more to my preference.  I'm typically a large (size: 38-31-41) and I'm curvy.  I got the Large and it was comfy with some room to spare but it still looked cute on me (It's a casual dress but I still got compliments on this dress).  The sizing does tend to be on the roomier side.  The name &#34;Mud Pie Mommy&#34; sounds very maternal but the name of this dress is very deceiving.  This dress can be dressed up a bit for a summer outing (with a nice wedge heel) or dressed down with white tennis sneakers and still look cute on.  Highly recommend it if you are curvy like me."
4.0,Oversized but i love it the material is sooo soft. I wouldn’t recommend putting it in the dryer though or ironing it ruined the material the ironed burned it even on low and the dryer deteriorated the integrity of the material its made little balls on the blouse.
4.0,My husband was pleased with his replacement band. Only sorry that the original band lasted only for one year before tearing apart.
4.0,"perfect fit,good quality.."
4.0,"love it , shows a little stomach & i've had it for a while now! Very satisfied!!"
4.0,"5’4…I was looking for a dinner dress for a beach dinner party.  I wanted a full length dress, but not one that dragged on the ground. This is the perfect length for me at 5’4. It sits at or above my ankle.  Did not have to wear a bra with it. The straps are adjustable. The small ruffles at the top help it to not show too much cleavage. The bottom is a bit shear- so in sunlight  you may be able to see your silhouette. But not see through.  Buy it!"
4.0,This outfit came just as cute as the picture and washed  with no problems!! My daughter loves them!
4.0,"The lettering is a little off, as shown in the photos. I read that the pom would fall off easily, but mine has stayed intact quite well. No loose threads, perfect fit."
4.0,"I am a typical size 4, but this skirt runs a little small. Has elastic and a zipper, but would suggest going a size up."
4.0,"Luv the shirt color and graphic...some puckering around the graphic after machine drying.  Hoping it will even out after next wash, then ""hang dry"".  I usually wear medium, but ""small"" was available and glad I ordered it...runs a half size up.  Wore on the 4th of July and received nice compliments."
4.0,"These are nice for my jewelry making. I gave 4 stars out of 5 because a couple of the lobster clasps came off and had to be put back on. Not a big deal, but just enough to lower it."
4.0,I’m 5’2 and weigh 130.  Length is perfect but it’s very tight. I ordered the adult medium.  I feel like if I sit or bent over it’s going to rip. 😞 very hot to wear. I don’t have to worry about being cold in Ohio. Feel very nice on the skin and even the out side. Face mask has a zipper on the back so watch you hair. The eyes are also hard. Great pick! I should have gotten a large. Pants run from 4 to 5 shirts are a medium. I hope this is helpful to ladies that has a hard time on size without trying it on first.
4.0,"cute and comfy, use reviews as a guide to select size."
4.0,Good quality leather belt for the money
4.0,Like This Bra For My Dress!  Want To Keep It!  I Like The Extender!
4.0,Fit perfectly out of the box and looks great.  Would have given 5 stars if the actual material were a bit heavier so that it didn't bend and crease quite so easily.  A little care is needed when handling the hat.  Definitely NOT a hat you can just toss into the suitcase or backpack.
4.0,Quality is very good but size of pants too big
4.0,"Good watch, just a bit too small for mens wrist"
4.0,This came in small. I have a bigger top then bottom. With the zippers there really isn't much room for stretch. After buying a medium that was too small I order an extra large and large. I took the extra large top and large bottom and gave the extra large bottom and large top to my 17 year old daughter. It was cheap enough to buy 2 and in the end it worked out perfectly. It is a pretty bikini
4.0,Product shrinks after washing
4.0,"Got this in a 2xl for my 5'5"" 175lbs 9year old daughter (yes I KNOW) who absolutely loves Demons Slayer. The fit was just right. The quality was amazing. The only hiccup was that the leggings were missing. We remedied that with normal black leggings and my baby girl didn't miss a beat."
4.0,Abit tight in the chest but a lovely top!
4.0,"Thin material, nice color. True to size, I got an XL but looks and fits like a L."
4.0,"Really cute dress, seller is easy to work with. I'm an 8/10 and ordered a medium because I didn't want it to look like a really baggy dress. I'm 5'3&#34; and it fit perfectly. It is sheer."
4.0,The fit is much too small for a Large. The color is beautiful though.
4.0,"The best is nice, i wear it as an under layer under my coat when I’m working in below freezing weather. The ability to plug in any usb battery pack is great. My only complaint is watch the size. I ordered the largest size xl or xxl whichever it is, and it fits like a men’s medium I normally wear a medium or large so it is snug and its the largest size."
4.0,"These are great quality, no complaints"
4.0,Running Belt iPhone 6/6 Plus & Android Holder...<br />Very nice material. I am so surprised when I fine out the pocket it stretch out big enough for my iPhone 6 plus.<br />But the belt wait can't not stretch out for big and tall people..! Like my husband (:-<br />I just order another set so I can gift to my relative because is fair price.
4.0,Imma curvy girl and I was worried  the large wouldnt fit me properly but it does and im ecstatic!! Im def gonna order the blue one now because they're super cute and my bf loves it
4.0,"I would have given 5 stars, but it did not give the hair tie as shown. Otherwise, a great hat."
4.0,"This dress is a beautiful purple but it is cheaply made.  There are threads all over it that need to be cut and the embroidery is on a separate piece of material that is tacked on to the dress in only a few places.  I have not ironed it yet but without ironing the dress, the tacked on piece hangs loose and the edges are cut roughly.<br />My granddaughter loves the fullness of the dress and wants to keep it."
4.0,I kept the shirt it may shrink some after washing but I did like the graphics very much.
4.0,"Worked for what I needed it for...a race in Disney Paris.  I have &#34;real&#34; sparkle skirt from another company and this one was no different.  I don't think anyone could tell a difference, myself included.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone."
4.0,It’s nice good quality
4.0,"i wear this necklace for everyday,  is lite and beautiful"
4.0,We did an engagement ring hunt for my future daughter-in-law's party.  It was a hit!
4.0,He loved it and for the price it is decent quality.
4.0,"I love the idea of these & have worn them many times since getting them but...they are small & get uncomfortable after a while.  They also ""ride up"""
4.0,"It’s warm, adds a great layer, and is so soft. Would definitely buy again at less than $15. Perfect for fall, can tie in a knot or let hang on its own. Versatile and works well with a Tshirt or  one piece."
4.0,"These fit perfectly well and they are so comfortable. I was purchasing some slippers as gifts for family members and saw these. The product looked great and the price was so cheap so I my expectations weren't crazy but I obviously want to enjoy the purchases I do make when I do. I went through some reviews before they arrived still hoping that I wouldn't be disappointed, but they were pretty reassuring. The slippers packaging was new and the slippers weren't smashed either(sometimes this material will flatten). The had paper in each of the slippers to prevent this. I was very appreciative for this. I had no issues putting them on and they felt great. I wear them around in the morning and the evening and I hope to get as much use out of them as possible."
4.0,Fair quality but as expected for the price.
4.0,"This dress looks great for parties or dates. Thick stretch material hugs the figure tightly and shows all the curves. M size fits more like S on me. So it’s better to take a size up. Because of the sizing it looks pretty short. On the front it looks great because of wrap effect, but on the back it’s very short. This creates a problem when walking as the material in the back rides up, making it look even shorter. I almost feel like I’m naked as a result."
4.0,Light weight and great sun filtering daark grey polarized. Don't leave home without them.
4.0,The material is a bit odd but overall I love the shirt
4.0,"Love these shoes! I had a hard time getting the heel strap tight enough, but don't let that stop you from purchasing these. I did a creative fix and they look great."
4.0,Such a soft peachy color! Got lots of compliments on it. True to size and very comfy
4.0,Perfect for the price! Love them! Bought two sets!
4.0,"I felt like this purchase was a gamble when I made it, but it was a gamble that paid off.  Yes, lovely ladies with curves — the sizing is accurate!  I have enjoyed these cropped pants very much.  I have machine washed them approximately 20 times since my purchase and they are holding up surprisingly well.  The lace is 100% unchanged and looks great.  There is some very slight pilling and fading (see pic), but nothing to complain about.  I consider it natural wear and tear. I found the cropped pants to be comfy and flattering.  If you’re on the fence, I would recommend these pants.  I don’t think you’ll regret it."
4.0,fits very tight and is long spected to be tall
4.0,"I volunteer as a theater Usher, so these masks were great for me to use. I kept 3 and gave 2 away to fellow ushers - at that price, I can afford to! HOWEVER, I would recommend these masks only for someone who is already at least double- or triple-vaxxed.  More to protect yourself than to protect other people from you. (But they are ""Wicked"" cute!"
4.0,Im in love with them! Fits great! But what I dont like is that it takes forever to put it on and out!!! The lace are hard to manage so it takes me like 5 min each foot to put them on!! I was thinking that this is why some shoes have a zipper on it as well.
4.0,Loved the dress. Great buy !! May get another color
4.0,I can wear it but it feels tight but it does what it says.  The face mask part was deeply creased but leaving it in the sun helped.  I'm thinking of attaching the face mask to a baseball hat with velcro but laziness may kick in.  My friend borrowed it and it made her feel dizzy but all the creases had been removed at that time.  Wouldn't buy it again but I bought for the panic 19 face covering.
4.0,"I bought the 3T size of this sweater, in both the red and yellow colors. Disappointed that the sweaters are NOT fleece-lined like the description says. The sizing seems to be inconsistent between colors; as you can see in the picture, the red sweater is about an inch longer than the yellow one. However, overall they seem to be in the ""true to size"" range since they are both large on my son who currently wears 2T tops in Carter's. He is 34"" tall and 28 lbs."
4.0,"I'm 5'1 and found the length perfect.  I'm also a pear with a small waist and a big booty.  Plenty of room to move comfortably for light exercise.  The cloth might be too thick for some.  My thighs stick out a little, but nothing I can't live with.  There is enough flair to make be feel confident.  Shorts stay in place."
4.0,So far so good. Seem a bit chinsey but only got them last week and just now tried them onso time will tell. The price is definitely right though.
4.0,Have received compliments on this each time I’ve worn it. Comfortable & very pretty. The reviews are accurate - cut is revealing in front and on the longer side - easy to modify for a more conservative meeting.
4.0,Good quality product for the money
4.0,The fit is lose and it hangs well. Good cut for the apple shap.
4.0,"I love the pockets, for phone, glasses, pens etc. Inside material seems kind of cheap, but the rest is great."
4.0,"Perfect, had it in for a few months and it has not discolored, although the bar is a little long which is why I only gave it 4/5 stars."
4.0,"I'm usually an American small, so I ordered a medium as the reviews said they run small, but it turned out to be too large! Probably in the range of an American medium. It's ok for my purposes though, as I got it to tuck in to skirts, and tucked in it's not so noticeable - only the shoulders that look a bit wide.<br /><br />Fairly good quality for the price too!"
4.0,"The grommet wasn't crimped tight, which was good because it was too small for my umbrella.  I slid the lightweight canvas off the grommet and stretched the center hole onto the point of my umbrella pole.<br />There is no integrated tie, so you'll need to bungee it closed if you have any wind.<br />Otherwise, the color is great, it went on easy, and it looks great on day one."
4.0,Love the colors and can't wait to put on my handbags!
4.0,Thin material but still very nice. You would be surprised how nice it looks
4.0,My son found these exceptionally easy to put on by himself (Pro). The con is that it doesn't appear to fit as snug as I would like for cold and snowy winters because the snow can fall inside the upper part of the boot pretty easy. (Con)
4.0,Very good with relation to its price
4.0,Exactly like the VS suit I used to have but is much too small for my girls now. Wish the top came in an XXL (I'm a 36DD) but the XL will have to do because I really like the design! I do have some spillage though so big boobed chickas beware it runs small!
4.0,"The dress arrived on time and in excellent to condition. I am 5'4, 158 lbs, 27 in waist, 36D bust, & 42 in hips. The medium (8-10) fit well. The material is stretchy and has some give. I will purchase again in other colors."
4.0,Cute and arrived on time.
4.0,"Cute, but a little boxy. I’m 5’3”, 165 lbs, I got the Large, fits great. I like clothing that isn’t super form fitting and this was great for that, but a little boxy."
4.0,I am a heavy sweater when working out and this mesh sides and back were wonderful.  I fell in love with it immediately.  Great support and shape......at first.  Just one wash and the straps would start falling off the shoulders and the material felt alittle more flimsy.  I was truly disappointed.  I do like it so much though on the first wearing that I am going to try a size smaller and then see how it holds up after washing.
4.0,"I'm size 7, ordered size 8 and still find it small. Will order size 9 instead and return this.<br />Shoes are pretty, but not very comfortable to walk in."
4.0,"Well made and fits as expected, but doesn't look as good on me as I had hoped (but that's just me and might look amazing on someone else)."
4.0,I like this dress - fits well.  The material is fine and I appreciated the fabric care guidelines.
4.0,Super adorable but it was too small in the chest for me and I had to return. :(
4.0,"Beautiful dress, better quality than I honestly was expecting. My only complaint is that it's a little tighter in the abdomen than I would like. Not so much that I can't still make it work, but just a little less tight would've made me more comfortable. But otherwise a great choice for any semi-formal occasion!"
4.0,"Fabric looks good quality better than expected, the issue is that it is not high waisted, and presses my upper booty, sadly had to return...and yes i sized up because i read reviews that say it runs small. I gave 4 starts because fabric is awesome."
4.0,Looks like sturdy shoes. But the metal buckle comes off easily in a few days. The seller was nice enough to replace it. The second one came off too. The metal buckle is just stitched weakly to the shoe and was ripped off of it after three days of use making it practically useless.
4.0,"Haven't had a real COLD opportunity to wear them, but they seem good!"
4.0,"Fit well, not the greatest material but pretty good"
4.0,Runs small and thw material sticks to you
4.0,Fit well but didn't come with zipper pockets or gold drawstring beads. Overall cute pants.
4.0,Bought this for a 20s theme party and it was the perfect addition to my outfit. And the best part... it never got loose or lose its shape the entire time I wore it! Great buy for the price!
4.0,I’m 5’9” weigh 160lbs ( not some skinny thing!) ha I bought an extra large and it fits a teeny bit on the smaller side.  But I still like it a lot.  Very comfortable!<br />Ordering another one!
4.0,"I bought this belt for a gift to my son. From what I've seen it's very nice. Nice box, paper wrapped around the belt. It also has a tool to make a hole in the belt. I like it."
4.0,"Very cute, but not as large as it appears in this photo - fine because it was for a child, who it fit perfectly. Ears don't stand up like they do in the picture. Still, perfect for our purposes."
4.0,Very nice exapecially for the money
4.0,"It is crazy that the battery is rated to last seven years, but the strap cracks in two or three years, but the  cost of replacing the watch band alone is about the same as buying a whole new watch. We live in a disposable society. The watch is perfect with a chronometer, stopwatch, and it is good for swimming. Can’t beat the watch But I wish that the watchband lasted as long as the battery.  I now have 3 of these watches that are still running, but only this new one has a band that I can wear."
4.0,My sister loves it haven't seen her wear it yet though
4.0,Fits perfectly. My waist is a 30 so it’s adjustable. Not great for water. Will start to rust.
4.0,I wear these when playing games on my tablet. I think they block blue light well.  I like the  frame colors and they fit well.They are rather large (wide) so a bit on the heavy side. If I wore them all the time that would be a problem. All in all I am happy with my purchase.
4.0,Looks good like picture
4.0,Fit great and will be fun to wear
4.0,Very good glasses. Can be worn at night to drive.
4.0,Evening at home
4.0,"My hands are pretty big so rings never fit me so i’m not really and that they didn’t fit, i got a really nice note from them, and the rings are good quality"
4.0,"Definitely go up a size in this dress. I'm 5'4 160lbs with a 34i chest and a 29inch waist. It is difficult to dress my body type and so, depending on the fabric, I am between a 6/8/10. Based on other reviews, I got the large and it fits pretty well. Tje bottom isn't skin tight but I didn't notice that it's the same in the picture so it's true to the depiction. Fine item for the price but definitely shoves my boobs down -- not the best for a larger chest. The colors are beautiful though!"
4.0,"Cute! But, a smidge short so it’s awkward. It doesn’t quite cover my booty. My booty is big tho. I still wear it with cute leggings, but it would look better over those leggings a smidge longer."
4.0,Awsome. Thank you.😎
4.0,"I bought cheap glasses because I keep losing them, or scratching them, don't really take care of them. These have lasted me for about 6 months now, not a single scratch!! they feel very light and cheap material, but they've hold up pretty good!! they only thing is, when looking at my phone, the screen looks really weird when wearing the glasses, I have to take them off if I wanna text."
4.0,"By the end of the day one corner was hanging on by a few threads. That being said, it's still very comfortable and warm."
4.0,"I purchased this for Opening Day at the Del Mar races. It looks great with my dress. It's a great size, too. I like that the little lace veil can be pushed forward for more coverage over the right eye, or pushed back so that it's just integrated with the design. Be aware that the hat is designed to be a fascinator on the right side of the head -- in the picture it looks like the left. Not a big deal, but something to note!"
4.0,Great color and super soft material.  I'm 5 ft 4 and I had to get it hemmed... was a little too long even in heels.
4.0,I bought this skirt for my daughter's unicorn party --- she turned 8 years old. It's great quality and she loved it.
4.0,Pros:<br />-flexible<br />-seams are well sewn and material seems good quality<br />-easy to take on and off with or without socks<br />Cons:<br />-runs large<br /><br />I ordered these in silver in a size 2 and another color in size 1. My daughter is almost six months old so I wasn't sure what size would be best. These do however run big. Even the size one is a bit too big for my daughters feet right now. I did take photos to compare he size one versus size 2.<br /><br />I like that this material is sturdy and formed well but also has some flexibility to it. They are easy to bend and even when smushed in packaging they hold shape well. The bottom is stamped with their logo &amp; the plain moccasin style doesn't have a hard sole- I know there are some sandals by this company with hard soles of that's what you are looking for.<br /><br />Review by P. Thomas<br />I received this product for a discount in exchange for the promise to give an honest review after I have thoroughly tested the product. This is my honest opinion of the item and is not influenced by any discount. I do not give good reviews just because I received a discount- you can look on my reviewer page to see I give a wide range of 1-5  star reviews.  Use the &quot;helpful&quot; button if you liked my review.
4.0,Great bag but thin shoulder straps make it less attractive....otherwise nice bag great color
4.0,"Definitely requires a slip to be worn underneath, otherwise the dress is lovely."
4.0,a lot larger than I expected but it does the job!
4.0,"Cute, but a little more roomy than needed. Decided to keep it"
4.0,"The sizing for these shorts turned out to be European sizing, but was marked as a size M with no additional information. I am satisfied with the purchase only because this is a very rare item and I will find a use for it!"
4.0,Its small enough for what I'll need for.  It's not bulky and wont be too heavy but only thing the strap is extremely long.  I'm petite and thin so I'll probably have to sew the extra strap together so its not just hanging down. I bought the blue one so i'm not sure if it was men and women's only.  I'm not a girly girl so I didnt like the other one.
4.0,"Fits great, flowy, soft fabric"
4.0,"The fabric feels cheap and it is very lightweight (only one layer of fabric), but the drape is really nice and I like the design"
4.0,"I got this hat at no charge for writing a product review. It's a cute, very lightweight hat. I found it to run a little small (but I have a big head) so I gave it to my mother. She was thrilled to have received a cute sun hat just in time for her vacation. She wore it the whole trip and said it was cool on her head and kept the sun out of her face. It is very lightweight and will definitely &#34;flop&#34; around in winds. I got it in black and it looked super cute with her black bathing suit"
4.0,"Sexy and comfortable, fits great"
4.0,"Before my 4 year old lost hers, both my 4 year old and 7 year old used them temporarily.  I don't condone the use of masks, but it's required many places right now, so these being very light duty fabric does not bother me.  However, I think these would be better suited for 10-12 year olds.  My 7 year old daughter has a chubby face, and she still had slight problems with them falling."
4.0,The upper chest area has an issue where it likes to try and pull part... rather annoying but over all still a great dress for the price.
4.0,"These are great winter boots. Really warm but not too restrictive. For those with smaller ankle/shins, there is a drawstring to help snug the boot up, though it isnt really the best mechanism as it can scrunch up the tongue. Your mileage will vary with the upper part of the boot based on your leg thickness. However, I recommend. I walked days on end in the low teens and my feet were always warm and comfortable. No wear in necessary."
4.0,Super cute earrings! They are of good quality. The tortoise looks really nice.
4.0,I ordered this flannel robe because I was hoping for a thinner weight flannel.  It is very comfortable and fits loose the way I like it.  I think it will the way I like if I wash it a few times.
4.0,"The sleeves was too short for my finance arm length on the 17.5 shirt, I had to return."
4.0,I bought these to wear post surgery. They were not tight enough so I had to run around last min to find something else. But now that my surgery is in the past I find myself grabbing these to wear under dresses.<br />These are tighter around the waist and not very tight on the legs. Maybe it’s the sizing because I’m small but FYI.
4.0,Helps a lot when packing
4.0,They are a little small but okay.
4.0,These shorts are super cute but always seem to be wrinkled so I can't give them 5 stars.
4.0,ok thank you
4.0,"I ordered a medium in this and the first few times, I needed assistance in getting it to hook in the middle section.<br />I'm 6', 168 pounds with a 28 inch waist. I found that the trainer stretches with time and before I knew it, I needed to be on the smallest hook closure. I now feel I should have ordered a small and worked down with that.<br />The quality is good and I've had no popping of hooks or issues with the bones."
4.0,"I saw another review that said this cosplay was a nice base and I couldn’t agree more. Obviously everyone’s body is different so different alterations might be needed but nothing super extreme. I’m short (5’1”) so I made the skirt a bit shorter. I don’t have huge breasts so I also had to fix the top straps to be shorter. (Honestly I just used a stapler to make alterations, too lazy to sew)The gloves were also huge on me but I have tiny hands. I just folded down the extra fabric and tucked it in. I’m not sure if the zipper on mine was a little wonky or if it’s just a cheap zipper but it was a tad hard to zip and unzip. The socks will NOT stay up, I tried fashion tape and that helped for most of the day but eventually gave up too. I have bigger thighs for my size so that could’ve made the situation worse too."
4.0,Solid was what I expected
4.0,Pretty leather bracelet for pretty much any age
4.0,Fit is great & fabric is great - I have a couple of these in different colors and was VERY happy with them - But with this one - I was looking for a white-ish sweater the one I received looked nothing like the pictured &#34; Ivory&#34; it was really LOTS darker and kind of tanish/oatmeal colored but the return was easy & the refund was fast - thanks
4.0,Runs a little small for the sizing. Shirt is good weight and seams to be of good quality.
4.0,Nice loose fit. I like the cap sleeves and breezy fabric.
4.0,Six-year old grandson loves Dogman books and loved the shirt!
4.0,"Overall a great sweater. The small fits like a medium, which isn’t too bad as I wanted it a little oversized. I like the way it was knitted, three different textures. Definitely good quality."
4.0,It was given as a present and she loved it! I will warn that the chain is VERY thin and seems like it wil break but it is pretty strong. Very beautiful product!
4.0,"Like this dress upon first sight.  The material is nice and easy, with a lining. It flows nicely when on, and will be perfect to roll up in a suit case for vacation.<br />The arm holes are large and my bra showed under my arms.  I had to re-sew it a bit at the top of my shoulders and was impressed at how well made this little dress was.  The black is a little light in color.  I only noticed this because when I paired it with a black sweater, I can tell the difference.  Decided to pair it with a white sweater instead."
4.0,Very comfortable cotton sweater and it looks good. Size fitted well.
4.0,I loved this pirat costume:)<br />The only thing is that It's not for a cold weather like<br />Chicago:(Anyway I put underneath the costume  an extra pair of pants and a sweather and me and my 2 year old son went for a trick-or-treat:)It was so much fun.<br />Overall It's a beautiful costume and I would recommend It for little pirats:)
4.0,"Nice and warm, but a little tight across the instep.  I'm hoping they'll stretch a little."
4.0,Really like these boots. I didnt get exactly what I ordered but it was close enough. I ordered the Dr. Martens Men's Bonny Waxy Canvas Chukka Boot and got the washed finish. The washed is like a pair of jeans. These are a great casual boot. very stiff but will break in nicely as all docs do.
4.0,"These were pretty and the jewels were nicely placed on the bangles. However, these run super small! I could not get them on, but had my husband cut a slit in each of them so I could stretch them out over my wrist. It worked ok but just a warning that they are more like child sized than adult. I loved them with my costume."
4.0,"I liked the texture and design, thankfully  ordered one size up, I would recommend order two sizes up if you want more room."
4.0,I’m 5’10” and weigh 195 lbs with a 42” chest. A large fits great for me. They’ve been through several washes with no issues.
4.0,Super nice. Awesome material. I bought it for a gift but too short for my nice. 5.7’ not my type or I would definitely keep it. I will return the product.
4.0,"super cute.. would have been 5 star if vinal was a bit softer,little stiff,not in a structured way though"
4.0,"It’s small, dainty, very light weight. It’s great for a women’s watch or a kid."
4.0,Perfect bag for my daughter. The strap is a good length and it fits everything she needs.
4.0,"looks pretty nice, but the quality is alright...for the money it's still a good buy if you just need to wear a couple times..."
4.0,One pair needed to be fixed
4.0,"I really like this shirt. I got an XL and it’s a little snug. I would’ve preferred it a little big but other than that, it’s super cute. Just order a size up than your usual size if you are going to get it."
4.0,SO long as you order a size up (as per the size chart) it fits great.
4.0,"Decorative, comfortable, not for anyone of size -- I am not a large person and have to wear it on the largest snap. The rings will not hold up under significant play but otherwise, pleased with purchase."
4.0,"When I received them, one of the earrings would not catch.  Luckily I was able to bend it until it worked but it still doesn't catch as good as the other one.  They are very pretty!"
4.0,Its an okay badge wallet. I didn't really use the strap as it just looked and felt awkward but the actual wallet is pretty nice and sturdy.
4.0,"I ordered three in different colors and they are bright and very pretty.  The fit is as advertised.  The material is a little thin which works for me because I am hot-natured, but if you want something heavier you may want to look for a different material."
4.0,wears great looks great also
4.0,This was a very nice watch for the price. My dad really loved this gift.
4.0,Cute! The colors are really bright! It was a little more orange than I would have preferred but it's cute!
4.0,Just what was expected!  Cute pillow!
4.0,Love this purse.  Nice and roomy.  Some if the stitching was loose though and had to be cut free.
4.0,"Bought this for wife, she loved it!"
4.0,"I got this case for my brand new MacBook Pro. I really liked the idea of having a messenger bag designed exactly for my laptop.<br /><br />But I think it might have a design flaw. The Incase laptop compartment inside the bag has a nice soft lining, but has rough edges at the bottom. I'm kind of afraid it might scratch the edges off my new computer.<br /><br />Meanwhile, there is also an iPad compartment, where the MacBook Pro actually fits well, without that rough bottom edge that I was talking about, but that compartment doesn't have the same soft lining! It's just the same material as the outside of the bag!<br /><br />I wish they had the soft lining in the iPad sleeve so I can just put my MacBook Pro in there and I would feel okay to actually carry the bag around. Or maybe I got an ""irregular"" one? Idk for sure.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a great bag. It has compartments inside the front zipper pocket for pens, cables, and another pocket that fits my charger very well. I store my USB dock in there."
4.0,"It's tad thin so it falls out alot, but its very pretty."
4.0,The shirt is way bigger then I expected. Medium would have been way better.
4.0,Loved it but it arrived all crumpled.
4.0,"I'm 5'3, straps are short as they go. Dress drags on the floor. Other than that, it's ok"
4.0,"I gave this outfit a 4 because I order a size medium but the hands was a bit tight so i had to redesign the outfit, also the thread was pulling out so has to re stitch other wise its a good out fit love the colours,"
4.0,Totally liked the look of this! But unfortunately it broke within a day of wearing. I did reorder another set. Hoping to get more wear out of it.
4.0,They are nice colors and easy easy to switch the Fitbit tracker into. The only drawback for me is that it's a one-size-fits-all product and I have rather small wrists so I have had to cut off the floppy end  which seems to be working
4.0,Great sweatshirt. Soft good quality- runs small! Go up one size.
4.0,"It looks great and its pretty comfortable, but the fabric isn't what I expected. It's also gets a bit hot, but it's still a great hoodie."
4.0,Works well on my uke. The fabric is a bit rough.
4.0,Nice quality tunic length raglan
4.0,"Pretty and classic. It would be even better in a very thin cotton, the chiffon looks good but is 0% absorbant so is really a cover up purely for beauty rather than any purpose."
4.0,"Gorgeous product and it made the wife smile straight out of the box, and THEN the light hit it, and the smile was brighter than even the gems!"
4.0,WAS TOO BIG FOR ME I RETURNED IT AND GOT THE SMALLER ONE
4.0,"Well, the design and quality is good, is just to small I bought some other brands and fits perfect but next time probably I’ll buy in a bigger size"
4.0,Was suprised at how cute these were irl. Great price.
4.0,Buy one size bigger due to the dress shrinking when washed.
4.0,Fits well and looks really nice
4.0,"Nice charm,  added it to a bracelet I made."
4.0,Really Nice! I tried to get prescription for them but very expensive. I wish i had the eyes for them.
4.0,"This is a good little pocket watch and is just what I was looking for.  Something small and fairly cheap that I could keep in my pocket since I don't like wearing a watch.  The Japanese movement keeps really accurate time, and is still within a second after a week. It's well made and nice looking. I have no complaints."
4.0,"I am a barefoot contessa (not really a contessa it's just a saying!), and when I can remember to put these on, it's the next best thing to being barefooted."
4.0,Fits a little snug but not too tight. Pockets also a bit snug. They are a decent pair of running shorts though
4.0,"I bought the skirts in my usual size, because I found the company's size chart for this item.  I've attached the actual size chart for these skirts, since many buyers had issues with the fit, not knowing the waist widths.  I really like the weighty fabric and rich colors.  I washed the skirts on cold in my washing machine, then very gently dried them in my dryer, with no discernible problem. The 38"" length is ok for me (just past my ankles), while the waist has a very tight, narrow elastic band. When I'm slimmer, the fit will be more comfortable, but then the length may be close to the ground."
4.0,Happy with credit card holder.  A lot stronger than first one I had
4.0,"Very nice case, I wished it had the ability to rotate the tablet. I can set the tablet horizontally but not vertically."
4.0,"Love the color, super cute.  Sleves too long, pants way too long.  Not a good fit for petite woman.  That is the only reason i did not give 5 stars.  Im 4ft 11 in, 120lbs., 34DDD"
4.0,Beautiful the pendant was a bit big but worth the price.
4.0,It's sized a bit tighter than expected so buy a size or two bigger unless you like snug.
4.0,Sandals are cute. They rub a tiny bit but maybe I just need to get use to them. They are pretty comfortable. Sizing is true to size. I wish they ran the same as all their sandals cuz I ordered half size bigger since I had just bought a different pair that had ran small so now These are a tad big. But it’s okay.
4.0,I liked it but it came off the second d.ay I had it. never felt it so it was gone
4.0,I love the color of this dress. The sage color is just such a pretty color for summer and I can’t wait to wear it. The material isn’t thick or thin which is good because it’s not see through. It’s a nice flowy material perfect for warm weather. I like the top ruffle design and shoulder ties. I found that it fit true to size for me as it wasn’t too big or tight. If you’d like it more snug then size down but if not then get your usual size.
4.0,Top is black but bottom is more dark blue :/
4.0,I liked it but it was too long for me
4.0,Great color and material. Only complaint is that the waist is a little bigger so the size I ordered is slightly too big
4.0,Exact fit & very comfortable
4.0,"This does a good job of drying my steel toed work boots and keeping them a bit fresher but it seems to shut down for a cool down cycle fairly often. Sometimes only after 20 minutes when the timer goes up to 2 hours. Also there is no display, just a sticker that says 42°F"
4.0,I like this top.  It was inexpensive and cute for another outfit.
4.0,This was so cute on my daughter. She wore it for Dr. Seuss week when dressing as Thing 2.
4.0,"It fit as expected for a $17 sweater. The sleeves are rather short but overall, it’s a nice sweater for the price."
4.0,Love my dress! I bought the navy blue. True to size (i am a bigger girl and it fit spot on).<br />Only complaint is how big the bosom is.... I am a 44DD Chest and it is STILL too big. I safety pin it or wear an undershirt/cami with it and it's fine.<br />I will probably purchase again in another color. I love it that much!!
4.0,This item is nice quality and very long. The only thing is the torso part is rather short if that makes sense. Because it’s a one piece the breast part is low so I put a cami under it and it’s perfect. But if you prefer your breast out this will be perfect!
4.0,"This is a very nice skirt, fits perfect and well made."
4.0,"This is a simple and efficient case. It is easy to maintain and has good protection with the internal part a silicon sleeve that will avoid scratching the phone, which has happened with other more &#34;durable&#34; cases that did not have good internal support that allowed the phone to get scratched from shifting inside a case. This was one of the $100 plus cases that will go unmentioned. That said, this is not frills and does not have a clip, which I prefer. I did not like that the back looks textured to not slide, but it is really a hard surface which translates that it slides well into my pocket, but also slides on hard surfaces like a car dash. I would buy this again, especially for the price."
4.0,"Very pretty color, if your bigger chested 36c the top will smother your chest. The bottoms fit so lovely!"
4.0,"Very pretty, I am pretty small, so it could have been a bit smaller for me."
4.0,Love the way these hug my feet and legs. Only complaint wish they were a little longer
4.0,my wife loves this shirt and wears it often.
4.0,They are good quality but they do not float or keep sunglasses from sinking
4.0,Like the dress. Material is 'ok not the best... I'd give four star on this one!!!
4.0,"I love my wifes butt. When she said it was sore after Mtbing, I took action to protect it. She loves these for long trail rides. Guys, take care of your girls butt!"
4.0,Great look... But feel to wide..
4.0,Cap is ok
4.0,These are so cute and good quality a little big on my ears though
4.0,and runs about 1/2 size smaller
4.0,"I'm a 5'8"" slim (147lb.) athletic man. I purchased a size SMALL. T-shirt is essentially comfortable soft cotton, and NOT thin like a cheap undershirt.  Its substantial, a bit stretchy and durable enough.<br />PROS: with 2 warm water washes and tumble drying, it has shrunk some though not excessively and no color fading / the neck hole is right up to the neck, so if you have a wide body-builder neck you might not like that / the arms are not wide but are slim against my biceps / the fit around my toned chest is just about right, so, again, if you're a body builder ...<br />CONS: The body of the shirt (below the chest) is not slim but is blousy / the tails are really lengthy, especially the back part (covers my butt cheeks).<br />I recommend .. with caveats."
4.0,"This beach cover up is absolutely adorable!! It is thin and lightweight, and lovely. My only complaint is that it is very sheer, so you can see right through if wearing something like a blue bathing suit. I wish it were a bit less see through, but otherwise it is great."
4.0,"I had to shave the connections a bit to make it fit, and one side of the band was sort of upside down printing-wise, but these are minor things and it was still a cute band for the holidays."
4.0,Great shirt...would buy again.
4.0,Talla s
4.0,"As it was sold as a business style, I expected it to be a looser fit; it was skin tight, and if you have no bulges, it would be beautiful. But any fat at all, and it shows. It claims to be a flattering top, but that is only if you need no flattering. It was also much more low cut than it seems in the picture, not business like. I'm giving it a 4 because it was nice in every other way, and if you are looking for a clingy style, it is well made."
4.0,"These sunglasses are affordable priced, fun and fashionable. They are cheaply made and not the most comfortable though. Based off the price though I’d order them again and they’re comfortable enough. I lose and break sunnies often so this is the perfect price and quality for me."
4.0,"somewhat large... fits like a night shirt, arms are too roomy for slightly oversized shirt...."
4.0,I was a little disappointed in the soles. Not much Cushing there. I will have to see what kind of Inserts to buy.
4.0,Great looking shirt but runs small.  Buy 1 size up.  Would be nice if it came in size tall.
4.0,Very durable and nice product.
4.0,"I was looking for these in the stores and had a hard time finding them. The price for these was hard to beat. My only observation is that they don't all seem to fit the same. They're all marked XL, but one seems to be smaller. Even if I only wear 2 out of 3, it was a good value."
4.0,"It’s exactly as described, fits well."
4.0,"The thought of this necklace stems from Matthew 17:20;  It deals with faith.  I bought one for myself, my roommate and her daughter.<br />The plating has worn off of the chain in 3 months, so I assume the heart will lose its plating as well, but the message it represents is still there."
4.0,Beautiful dress. You'll need black underwear and bra because it's a little see through in places like the bust. Pleased with the dress for the cost.
4.0,"the product is fine, but it's really large. i have other 1/2&#34; rings that are smaller. this is too long to even be tucked in my nose."
4.0,Just what I wanted and at a great price.  Quality is very good and the 3 inch length gives me quite a few options.
4.0,IT WAS  WHAT I EXPECTED
4.0,"This is a cute bra, but it doesn't work for support. I wear it with a strapless bra underneath."
4.0,Not the highest quality pajamas… I do like that the shoulder straps on the tank are adjustable. All & all l decent product for the price
4.0,"Socks are extremely well crafted, but I wear a men's size 12 shoe, and they are just a bit snug."
4.0,I love the bag but the zipper on the front pocket already broke.  It may be just a bad zipper.  Everything else is perfect.
4.0,I received several complements on this shirt. I am usually  a 14/16. I ordered an XL and it fit great! The material is a little stiff but I'm hoping it will soften up after several washes.
4.0,Ordered this and have used it and enjoy the comfort of the shirt but size is a bit tight for what I ordered. Still a decent quality for the price.
4.0,Bought this as a Christmas gift for a coworker. It’s a little shorter than I like but she said she likes it. The material seemed good and it was a pretty color.
4.0,"This is an amazing wrap dress, l really like it when l tried it on, gives me the hourglass shape. I m 5f 7inches, 34C and 110lbs and l bought the small fit perfectly for me. It will be a nice dress for a date night. I used a black camisol for the chest, which was perfect!! Will buy in order colors...hopefully!"
4.0,Love the shirt except for the fit around the stomach area. Not loose fitting.
4.0,Really nice! My girls love them! And they look great on them as well.
4.0,"These socks fit and feel great. I've been experimenting with a number of different athletic socks for cross country training and hiking. I tend to over pronate and run on the tips of my toes, which often causes blisters on the inner-front part of my foot. The difference in these socks and regular cotton socks is definitely stark. They fit well and look great too.<br /><br />My one minor complaint is that they don't breath as much as I thought they would. I sweat heavily during exercise and my feet are usually soaked after 2 miles in cotton socks. These were a bit better, but I expected the material to be even lighter than it was. Even so, it's still a good deal and a nice pair of socks."
4.0,"Fabric not suitable for hot weather outdoor,  feel like burning"
4.0,This dress is very cute but has no stretch. It's very tight across my chest- I'm only a 36b and ordered the large. The tightness acros5the chest extends through the shoulder area making it a little hard to move
4.0,"I like the eggplant color, and it was so easy to swap bands on the watch.  The raised pattern has worn a bit, but not significantly.  I like the belts on the band, they have tabs to keep it secure, I was worried the tabs would break, but after a year we are still going strong :-)"
4.0,was a gift to a co-worker and she seemed to like them.  They arrived about 7-10 days sooner than I expected too.
4.0,I bought these for my boys for Easter and they went very well !
4.0,Kept my arms warm enough but they did begin to sag a little. Still good for the price.
4.0,Kinda bummed when I found it was not bleached but it’s like made into the material instead of being even printed. The splatter goes onto the back of the shirt completely (big pet peeve). Not too tight not too loose! Great with leggings and a cardigan for Spooky Time!  I bought a small and I’m a 32D size small normally.
4.0,Love the suit just too big. Need to return
4.0,"Good universal fit and matches my GMC truck.  Not a fitted hat, but an acceptable adjustable one."
4.0,Nice dress but the white is see through.
4.0,Beautifully made. A bit heavier than I like but very pretty.
4.0,"Love my Mala beads! I use them when I do my meditations. Great product. Beautifuly made. Head a problem with shipping, so relieved it later then scheduled. Other then that I highly recommend."
4.0,It is a very lovely dress.  I wore it to my 50th family reunion at the Clinton Library.  The dress made me out do myself!
4.0,"Not spending $20 per pair at the cobbler anymore! Woohoo! Well, unless I cant get the peg out because I walked on it too long :( my bad."
4.0,"I got these because my toddler has a bit of a junky trunk. Her buns don’t really fit her age appropriate size well. These ran small, and when they were washed—smaller. Size up with these. They’re worth it. Good quality."
4.0,"Very warm, great  price. I love the feature of being able to cover my fingers if I like, but they do have a slight shedding problem"
4.0,"I ordered a M. I am 5'7"", 158lbs, size 8-10. The dress is cute and flowy but I would have sized down to a small. I am keeping the dress because it is very cute and I think the small would be too short. Definitely size one or two down. I took it in about 5"" from each side."
4.0,"I had ordered two different 5 packs, after searching a specific brand butter-soft sock. One set is soft, but not as soft as what I was looking for. The second set is rough, and not very heavy."
4.0,"I received this as a gift from the misses at Christmas.  Seems like the real deal to me.  However, I wish the length was a bit shorter or longer so I could wear this wrapped around my wrist.  Maybe I will just have to build up my forearms when I am not meditating."
4.0,The dress is very pretty but size up! I am a true 12 large so I ordered a large. Too tight in the bust. Returned.
4.0,We live in Florida and don't frequently have a need for gloves. We had a couple of cold days this year and ordered these for quick delivery.<br /><br />They did the job! They were not particularly soft or comfortable and would not be the warmest in REALLY cold temperatures but they worked well for the couple days of cold weather we received.<br /><br />Appreciate that they came in a pack so we could quickly swap out when one pair got dirty! Good value!
4.0,"Cute outfit, it was just longer than I expected."
4.0,"Fabric is very thin, had to buy another dress to wear underneath. I normally wear a medium but had to get in extra large"
4.0,Fit as expected. wish it was slightly longer. Good tank.
4.0,I bought these because I needed another pair of shorts for summer. They fit great & are very comfortable. My major problem is they are too expensive.
4.0,The tank runs a little large so if you like things form fitting you should size down. It’s soft and has vibrant color. Great piece for casual summer wear.
4.0,"I like the feel, texture and fit of these panties. My only complaint is that they bleed onto white material. I wear with a white terrycloth robe and the color rubs off on that. Rubs off on my skin, also. I discovered this when I started noticing my white toilet seat was changing colors! Other than that, they are perfect."
4.0,Brilliant color
4.0,"NIce gloves....Broke the string the FIRST DAY :( so I am sure we will lose one....Otherwise, size is great for toddler. Just bummed the string broke ASAP."
4.0,It is a very nice dress.i bought it for my niece and  she likes it very much!!!!!
4.0,"Took one for the team and thought I'd send it back if I didn't like it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- gorgeous color<br />- pretty stretchy everywhere but the bottom hem which doesn't bother me. Gives it a more ""bubbly"" slouchy look<br />- much softer than I anticipated. Might still be a little itchy if dampness like sweat comes into play<br />- I've got long arms and the sleeves are a really nice length.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- the knit seems kinda delicate? I have two dogs and for sure this is a work-only article of clothing. Seems like it'd be very easy to snag if you're in the right situation.<br />- a little on the thin side if you wanted something for the warmth. This could be a pro depending on who and where you are.<br />- ""pinching"" the material to adjust how it looks will leave an obvious little peak in the fabric of pulled by a thumb and index finger. Easy enough to smooth out though.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />It's a decent, lightweight sweater. Love the color and the overall shape of it from the sleeves to the neckline."
4.0,Very nice shirt fit well!!!.
4.0,"I got the small and the fit is a bit small, I would order a size up. I got the white and it is a bit see through but the material is very light weight and great for hot weather. A great polo for golf or casual wear."
4.0,Nice looking sandals but they run small making them uncomfortable.
4.0,I bought this shirt for comic con in NYC. I'm taking a photo op with Matt Smith. Nice shirt but you would need to get it at least 2 sizes up from your regular size.
4.0,"Bought this for my Daughter, she likes it, it is just how it is described in the add, it come with a nice chain as well"
4.0,I usually wear a 10 in shoes. I don't have a very wide foot but I have larger ankle and calf. I should of gotten a 9. I don't like returning things so I regifted them.
4.0,"Too short for me, not small... sleeves were long enough but didn't go down to where I like it shirts to be. Was nice enough to give to my sis in law....she loved it!"
4.0,Some were scratch and hard to read.  Made keychains and bracelet gifts for wedding guests.
4.0,Successful repair completed!
4.0,Decent quality material and stitching but not real leather
4.0,Much smaller than I thought but cute.
4.0,Comfy easy wear pants for working at home.
4.0,A little tight but will most likely loosen up over time.
4.0,This is a great diaper bag for running errands or a quick trip. Plenty of space for the essentials and some extras.
4.0,Hilariously fun for theme party. I wear a Large so ordered 2XL. Still had to get neck hem altered so I could wear it without choking.
4.0,Great size for a trip to dance lessons
4.0,This is an outstanding product that I continue to purchase when I have worn out the old one.
4.0,Looks great. Shrank a little more than expected
4.0,"I was at wit's end, as my child never seemed to come back from daycare with both gloves.  I bought this set and was happy.  Set includes various sets/colors (as shown) which can mix with others as they go missing, and was easily washed.  Not super high quality, but this was expected for the low price."
4.0,O.k. fit a little larger than expected for a medium. I prefer mine a little more form fitting. Overall would recommend.
4.0,"Nice glasses with clear lenses. One really cool thing is they come with a padded lens protector so when I stuck the glasses in my backpack I didn't have to worry about scratching them. I used this for my readers when I was wearing the Vuarnets. Didn't really like the blue stripe, otherwise 5 stars."
4.0,"Great look, great value..the only reason it didn't get a 5 star is because the latch is so small....but, I will say that the latch stayed in the back of the neck and did not venture to the front of the neck as necklace latches tend to do...18 inch chain is a good length and it is a good looking chain...it's a keeper !"
4.0,"In pictures fanciful, but in fact very normal"
4.0,My son loved this hoodie.  Fits good.
4.0,"I bought this as a gender announcement for our second child. I don’t think he’ll be able to wear it as a newborn as it is a little big, but will be perfect when he gets between two and three months old."
4.0,this bracelet is very nice i opened the box and put it on...colors are nice...worth the money..
4.0,The fit was fine it is just a little bit short in length.
4.0,"I am very pleased with my necklace the elephant, but the necklace, chain, doesn't have a clasp to put it on. Nice chain.  I have to put It on over my head. There is a place where one should go.  It would be nice if it had one.  That's why i rated it a four. I don't recall if the description mentioned a clasp, if not it should.  If it was in the description i got a defected item.  It would have been a solid chain, but I'm keeping it cause i don't like returning things and its not terrible."
4.0,Really like the bag. It had a couple of stains on it but they're small and on the back side so you can't see them. My only gripe is that I wish there were pockets inside. I'll get plenty of use out of it though.
4.0,"I like these. I typically wear a size large in most undershirts but I took the advice of an earlier review and purchased a size larger. They are still snug but the fit feels about right. If you want even more loose fitting, I'd suggest going two sizes larger They are relative long and I've found they stay tucked in nicely."
4.0,This is a must have for kids! So many mittens and gloves gone missing over the winters. This works best for an older toddler as it weighs down the coat for our 21 month old and she doesn’t like it pulling on her sleeves but it keep everything from getting lost!<br />We have been using these same clips for years (it’s been through her older brother and sister) and no tarnishing or rusting!
4.0,Wore it all summer and felt comfortable in it. Did not feel cheap at all! Such a great deal!
4.0,"It's fine, but I need more support"
4.0,I got these pants for a 70's party and they are cute but super long. Honestly a little high on price in my opinion. I would put them more around $30.
4.0,Very nice. Not quite as vibrant in color as I had hoped.  All in all pretty good
4.0,My 1st pair of these clamps were phenomenal. They was working fine and I lift heavy weights majority of the time then someone stole them. Then I bought a second pair. The first time I lift with then one broke off. I'm pretty sure that it was because I had it in my car when it was cold out for a while. For the most part I would buy them again.
4.0,"Está más corto de lo que yo esperaba, no traía su tarjeta de garantía de mossnita ni indicaba en ninguna parte el peso durabilidad o garantía de la pieza, por lo demás, todo bien."
4.0,"Ok so the current review of this watch seems fake, or at the very least bias.  I didn't buy the watch from Amazon but I did buy this exact watch, and I shop on amazon a lot and really appreciate customer reviews.  So, with that out of the way I have been wearing this watch daily now for 3 weeks.  I own several watches and have a decent background in owning decent watches.  The quality of this watch is on par with a Invicta, also like the lower end Sieko's or Citizen's.  Everything about the watch is very nice for the price, real good value for what you are getting.<br /><br />The watch wears really well, it's light and sleek.  I barely notice I have it on, but it's not so light that it feels cheap or anything.  In the daily wearing it's been getting bumped around a bit and so far the outside materials seems to be holding up well.  The band is stiff when you get it, but the leather seems to be breaking in nicely.<br /><br />I paid $90 for the watch and feel just fine about what I paid.  They are currently selling it for $79 on here and that is a even better deal.<br /><br />Overall I am getting it 4 stars, I would give it 5 but the back case does feel a slightly bit cheap.  But I am just trying to find something wrong with it by complaining about that though.  It is well worth buying if you are looking for a lightweight, great looking, quality watch!  I will update this post if I do run into problems with it later on.  :)"
4.0,I loved this dress. If you have a small tummy like me I'd order a darker color.
4.0,"I really love this dress. I got it a size big (usually a 20, ordered a 22) and it fit great everywhere (stomach, arms, etc) except the chest area. I had to get double sided tape to get it to stay closed, so to speak.<br />I paired it with a purple belt and everyone loved it."
4.0,"Soft, comfortable, and pockets! What more could you ask for? That a medium wouldn’t fit like a XXL. I mean really, I’m not that short (5’4”), but the pockets were to my knees.<br />What a disappointment!"
4.0,"Too small, ordered 2x too long for my body."
4.0,"The earrings look great and were packaged well, but, I was planning on giving them as a gift and they came in separate individual clear plastic bags wrapped in bubble wrap, but no box or even a little bag to hold them.  If you're buying these for yourself, they are lovely, but if you're buying them as a gift for someone else, you'll want to get a small box to hold the earrings as well.  I unexpectedly ended up having to scrounge one up for Christmas since these were a gift for someone."
4.0,That's all I know. It was sent as a gift and the receiver liked it a lot.
4.0,After shoulder surgery usually have one arm immobilized so difficult snaps are not desirable.  A couple on my shirt were difficult.
4.0,I like them but too big and slid down my nose.  I gave them to my husband.
4.0,Higher waist than I expected so it looks a little bit like a maternity dress but very soft and nice.
4.0,"It was great but a little to small for me. The strap was a little complicated, but after you figure it out it is easy. Great bathing suit, just not for me."
4.0,"I like this shirt, even if it's a bit snugger than I expected. It's comfortable to wear and the colors are nicer than in the picture. All in all, I'm glad I got the shirt."
4.0,"Very nice, quick shipment, thank you."
4.0,"I should have expected it, I guess, but the diamond was really tiny. Hardly noticeable"
4.0,"The dress design was expected and very elegant. I only returned it because I expected a thicker fabric-like material with a slight stretch. I am not sure how to explain the material. It is not thin or sheer at all, but it is lighter and stretchier than I thought I would get for the price. This material is still fine, just not what I wanted. If you do not mind the material, this dress is very cute and accurately shown. Get it!"
4.0,"This dress is a lovely design. As most formal wear it runs a bit small so you must follow your measurements for sure in order to determine your size. I chose to return this dress and go with another option because it was a bit too fitting in the bust area and didn’t have any give. I didn’t want to feel uncomfortable during my event so it was best to go with something else. But it’s not a bad dress, it just wasn’t for me. You can tell the detail out into the dress was well thought out."
4.0,"a little see through but very cute, i just wore a bandau and dark blue spanks underneath"
4.0,"This bag is made very well, definitely looks and feels more expensive.  My only issue was that the strap wasn’t long enough so I had to figure out a way to extend it, not the easiest thing with the type of strap this bag has but we’ll worth it! :)"
4.0,Cute for a fun event. Not a fancy one.
4.0,This is super comfy. I ordered one in black but the top is a little see-through so I have to wear a tank underneath it. Otherwise it’s great.
4.0,Too small for everyday wear as per my wife but she likes it and I like how it looks on her.
4.0,I really like these but they keep dying on me.  Lifetime is not good but while it works it is perfect<br />The app is super easy to use and wristband can go long periods between charges.
4.0,"I Like it, pretty cool!"
4.0,I liked that I could nurse while wearing this dress.
4.0,"The rings are pretty malleable, and I accidentally warped them putting them in, but for the price I expected as much.<br />Exactly what I was looking for."
4.0,Nice but if you are 5'2 it's probably too long for you
4.0,"Used it yesterday on my ride and when it stays on and in place it works well. If not careful on where you place your foot on your pegs or your foot pedals when resting and then you go back to shift, the shield moves forward and you can’t get it under the peg. So, you are too focused on trying to get your foot under the peg you are not concentrating on the riding. Could get a bit dangerous. Thankfully, it has a snap to hold on to your shoelace (must have laces for this to work) or else it would come off and bye bye to your nice shoe protector. Improvement would be to make it less thick so as not to interfere when shifting. It’s a hard item to work with because of small area where it covers. Leather is gorgeous and it looks cool on the shoe."
4.0,"I likes art of layers in mask, but did not like the gas at sides"
4.0,"Love this shirt, it’s so soft. It’s perfect but then length could be a good 2 or 3 inches longer. I’m only 5’ 2” so I couldn’t imagine how short it is on taller people."
4.0,"It fits well, i just wish the tie on the top was a little shorter, and the top its self was a little longer."
4.0,Bags are great
4.0,Gloves fit well and it was easy wearing them while cycling
4.0,"I just got this watch yesterday and I love it. I'm a nurse so I have to wear a watch. I don't want to wear my good one at work. I don't like anything snug because I get sweaty under the face of the watch. This watch is exactly what I need. No clasp, stretches to put on. It is so lightweight I can barely tell I have it on. It has a nice large face with second hand that I need. All that at this price!! I only gave it a four because I want to see if I have any problems with it right away."
4.0,"muy bonita me encanto mucho! solo q la piedra esta demasiado pequeña, pero aún así es linda!"
4.0,Great variety cute bracelets. They were a hit for stocking stuffers for the girls and boys. Just wished there were some macrame ones included also but still good for the price.
4.0,"Overall I love the dress. However, there was a rip on the delicate fabric which is why I deducted a star. Luckily it’s under the arm so it will be easy to hide, but I’m not sure how to stitch it since the fabric is more delicate and not easy to fix. Looking at the garment it appears that you shouldn’t wash it in the washer and will either need to wash it by hand or get it dry cleaned. Overall, I do want to buy this dress in more of the other colors it comes in."
4.0,"Battery was dead when I got it, but It's a nice piece."
4.0,"very good, fast shipping"
4.0,I ordered a large floor length dress. I loved it I was comfortable I spent 6 hrs in the dress it was comfortable the entire time.
4.0,"The socks are comfortable and made from a high quality material, however, some of the photos are misleading as the sock is a deep navy blue and not black. This is something that should be pointed out in the description. Nice packaging and product otherwise."
4.0,I ordered a size up they run small. Not very high waisted. They are comfortable to wear and workout in. Overall happy with this purchase.
4.0,It does it job and it looks cool!!
4.0,"Stitching really close together in part of it, harder to read"
4.0,Stretchy t shirt material made my maternity pics perfect! Definitely wrinkles easily but it’s super soft and comfortable
4.0,"Ok. These pants are cute, stylish, and comfortable! I will say the sizing is really weird tho. I ordered these in the black, and the light blue, I normally wear a medium. Which I ordered the blue in (and I thought the black too)…They fit perfectly. But the black they sent me in an XL which also fit perfectly. So either the black runs smaller than the blue or they mislabeled the black pants 🤷🏾‍♀️"
4.0,It fits perfectly.<br />Seems to be strong enough
4.0,"Super cute and very flattering, love that it has pockets. A bit see through, but not that bad with nude colored undergarments :)"
4.0,These have been great for helping with sensory issues with crossing the midline. Great for kids on the spectrum!
4.0,I get a lot of compliments on this bag. I love how it keeps it's shape and keeps the contents in place and easy to find. This is a great summer bag.
4.0,"This is a nice faux leather skinny belt set.  The set includes leopard print, royal blue, black, hot pink and nude.  The belts have 6 prong holes and the buckle is your standard frame-style with prong.  I am a bigger girl (12/14) and the belts work for me.  I am getting a ton of use out of them.  The order arrived quickly, but my nude belt was broken.  I contacted Bundle Monster who sent me a replacement in just a few days.  These belts are intended for looks only, and are not very durable.  You can't beat the price.  They will make any outfit pop, and give a polished professional look in just seconds."
4.0,They are great but not in size
4.0,Basic cardigan fits nicely.
4.0,"Very nice shoes.  Bought them for my daughter's Halloween Dorothy costume.  They are not dress up shoes, they are real, quality shoes.  The &#34;sparkle&#34; is perfect and no loose glitter or sequins, the sparkle is built into the fabric on the shoes.  Very nice, with a quality buckle.  Took off one star for the sizing, which I still don't understand.  Ordered a 3 first and received a shoe that had a 2 marked on the bottom with a sticker on the inside that read UK2, US3.  They were too big, so I returned it and ordered a 2.  Well, I received the same exact size.  Not sure if this was a mistake or not.  We had already tired another brand which didn't work out, so after several tries, decided just to keep them and will put some kind of insert or double socks to make up for the size.  Overall, happy!"
4.0,I bought the earrings for myself. I love them and wear them all the time.
4.0,I love the color!! casual comfy dress
4.0,"Looks as Pretty as the picture, I did not realize that 1.5 was thinner than I wanted.  Keeping it, love the sparkle."
4.0,They are good but easily get scratched up
4.0,I ordered two in different colors.  The black one came just shy of mid thigh.  The purple one is at the top of thigh.  Altogether about 3-4 inches different in length.  They are very comfortable and soft.
4.0,"The fabric is lush. The sole is sturdy and the base is plush. It really help keep my feet warm and cozy. I'm a size 51/2 and it's a tad big, but nothing I can't get over. I do like my things to fit well though. So, if you're feet are any smaller, you may have a problem."
4.0,"Vest arrived on time and is very nice. The color will go with anything. It felt a little clingy when i tried it on, but that could have been due to the type of shirt I was wearing. This is just one of 4 I have ordered and I like them all."
4.0,"Nice, casual look. Can be sexy or sporty, depending on what you wear (or don't wear) underneath."
4.0,Worked great for protecting a hiking backpack when checking in luggage. Held up well and folded easily.
4.0,"The skirt arrived a day late but it fit nicely. I’ 5’8 and 178lbs. I usually wear a size 10 but I was afraid it would be too short, so I ordered a size up and it’s the perfect length. Only two small complaints: there’s a small slit on one side that I didn’t notice in the picture, which makes it less tight in the back of the legs, and it had a bit of a plastic smell when I got it (which is probably due to the packaging). Other than that, I like it a lot."
4.0,"Arrived quickly. Lenses are definitely large, as stated in the description."
4.0,A quality tee shirt with good graphics. A roomy large.
4.0,"To answer my own question, yeah... If you make it! This pic contains a band worn for about 2 months (bottom) and brand new (top). The beautiful pattern wasn't created to keep up with you everyday. That's probably why it has such a fantastic price tag attached to it! As for my modification, I did better the 1st time around... Apparently the Versa is slightly larger than the Samsung, the band had to be cut in addition to using smaller pins."
4.0,Perfect bag stuffer for friends
4.0,Very cute dress. Well made. The material is a little thin so I will wear a sip under. Love the dress though!
4.0,"the shirt is adorable, but definitely not long-sleeved. honestly it looks cuter with the sleeves pushed up to the elbow anyway, so it works great for me, but just a word of warning."
4.0,"Receive this item at a heavy discount so that I could try it out, review it and give my feedback. This is a new hobby of mine and hopefully I'm able to provide useful information to other Amazon customers so that they can make informed decisions about their purchases.<br /><br />I like this headband, but I wasn't expecting it to have so much material. I have very long hair, and even with all the hair I have, I felt like this headband didn't contain it well. I tried a few different configurations, but I didn't have success with the 12 configurations shown.<br /><br />That being said, it's a cute headband. I've tried it out on two runs, and it did a decent job of keeping my hair out of my face and absorbing sweat. When I tried to fold it to make it smaller,  it was too thick. Maybe I'll figure out something that works better. All in all, I'd say it's a good headband, but you're unlikely to get 12 different ways to wear it."
4.0,"This pack is the perfect size for short hikes.  For long hikes, I prefer a bigger pack, but this one hold enough water, gear and snacks for 1/2 day treks.  I had no problems with fit or with the mouthpiece leaking."
4.0,"I bought this dress for graduation, and it fit as expected."
4.0,"These shoes are very pretty. My daughter will be wearing them in a wedding this September. They fit her perfect and look so cute. The sparkles seem to come off easy, so I don’t know how long they would last for every day wear, but for what we’re using them for they work perfect."
4.0,Ole' lady says they are tight cause her ass is fat.
4.0,Great look.  Fit was a bit large.
4.0,"Not the design I was expecting but it's still okay. I'm lucky both masks fit me well. My head circumference is 22 inches and my eyes 3 1/2 inches wide, or about 1 1/4 apart. The female mask is made of metal, and bent in a couple places. The elastic is a bit tight. For some reason the male mask has a silk ribbon tie instead of elastic, with one sidecl shorter than the other. I found it hard to tie, and I'm guessing it's not long enough for my husband's head. It's made of plastic, too. I took off one star because of the ribbon, but both masks look well made."
4.0,perfect material it hugs all my curves.
4.0,"Thank You, they have a good weight to them and am hoping for good emf protection."
4.0,It’s long in the back.  The fabric is light.  This most likely will be used at the beach instead of a night out.  Unless I find a navy dark body suit.
4.0,"I've been a Swiftie from the very first day I heard Taylor's voice over 13 years ago, and as a female INTJ (according to Myers-Briggs personality typology) this necklace seemed absolutely perfect for me. I do think the metal plate is too large, yet depending on the light it can still be hard to read. I would prefer if it came in the letters-only format, but it's still worth having and I'm definitely wearing it to The Eras tour. The quality is fine so don't hesitate to get one for yourself or the Swiftie in your life- just make sure to find out which style/phrase would mean the most to them.<br />Also, I checked and as of January 2023, Taylor does not offer any necklaces like this on her online store, so I don't think this is stealing business from Taylor or I wouldn't support it."
4.0,Dulls fast
4.0,My daughter loves it! I thought that the quality could of been better...
4.0,I love the look of this band after the first band was damaged the company reached out and sent me a new one. I love the look and it’s a very pretty band. Thank you
4.0,It is shiny.
4.0,"These are great and fit my oakleys perfect. THe only thing I would say is that when I dropped my sunglasses (very clumsy), one of the lenses did fall out and I had to pop them back in. That never happened with the original oakleys lenses, possibly because they are a bit heavier. Great buy"
4.0,"Looks great! However, I ordered a 12 month for my son and it was too small. I would order an 18 month if your child usually wears 12 month clothing."
4.0,"I was highly surprised at the quality of this suit. I did order one size up for this to accommodate my chest size. I wasn't expecting the bikini top to fit even with sizing up, but I didn't want to go to large because I was scared the bottoms would then be too big. To my surprise the suit totally fits! I do wish there was a bit more support in the top, but I have criss crossed the straps in the back and that has helped. It appears you can adjust the straps to make them tighter but I had no luck getting them to move so I didn't want to force them. The cover up tank fits a little loose, but it is perfect for me to wear as a cover up. Definitely better than I expected I half thought I would have to return it because some part of it wouldn't fit. The color is a little different than is shown, but not much. I can see this being one of my favorite suits this year. Perfect for the pool, beach or water parks!"
4.0,"Wish it held more, but good quality. Lots of pockets."
4.0,These shoes are very cute.The school uniform is black or white shoes they allow her to be unique in a uniform world.
4.0,Great fit. As described. Good materials.
4.0,Too big for my face but looks great on my daughter lol. Came on time and is made good.
4.0,"Purchased in white<br /><br />I'm 120 lbs and normally wear size small or medium. The medium fit perfectly fine but I found the plunging neckline to be too revealing. Although it's possible to wear a regular nude bra without it showing, the v neck is so low it may expose the gore/middle of your bra if you lean over. (See attached photo showing how low the front is compared to the back)<br /><br />Quality was much better than I expected for the price point. I'd say the quality is comparable to dresses found at discount retail stores like Ross or Marshalls.<br /><br />The dress is very short in length but I found that to be bonus because I am only 5'2&#34;"
4.0,I like the openness of this
4.0,I really like this dress.  I didn't expected it to fit as well as it did on me.  I am thinking about ordering another color in the same style.
4.0,Super cute but a bit big I wish there was more of a cinch at the waist
4.0,"The material was fine except they run small. Gave to daughter. I ordered a large, but....."
4.0,My child is tall so I have to always order a size up. It is almost floor length and she’s just over 5’ tall. I ordered the 12/13 year old size. It’s not as full as the picture shows but a hoop skirt underneath would accomplish that but it would take an inch or two off the length.
4.0,Item is smaller than advertised.
4.0,fits well. made with quality
4.0,Fit a little big but overall it had good support
4.0,The hat is way to small
4.0,"Decent quality for the low cost-- fits comfortably on the wrist, band is composed of pliable material that seems as if it might last for awhile."
4.0,"I ordered 2 of these as Christmas gifts. Two nice gift boxes arrived but 1 was empty. I immediately contacted seller's customer service & they promptly sent another bracelet. They are very pretty, nicely made & seem to be comfortable. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is that they are very light in color, nearer white than silver."
4.0,The customer service is excellent! Order at least 2 size up and you will be fine. Nice dress
4.0,"These are more like tights but still work well for wearing underneath longer shirts, dresses or skirts."
4.0,My daughter in law loved it.  The face was too big for my small wrist.
4.0,"This is an amazing dress. It’s a flattering, unique silhouette with a forgiving fit if you happen to order the wrong size.<br /><br />This being said, this manufacturer is a bit inconsistent. The brighter polka dot prints and solid color options are made with a thick weird polyester fabric and it’s uncomfortable. The lighter shades of patterned and floral options are great though!<br /><br />When purchased in the right option, this dress is my go-to for both weekends, and days at the office- compliments galore!"
4.0,Product is exactly what I expected. Price is right and color is exactly what I wanted. My outfit is complete now.
4.0,Its pretty and comfortable but runs big.
4.0,"If they didn't have pockets I'd give 5 stars. The pockets make them just a little more puffy. But overall they fit good and are what I was looking for. Now I'm going to really nitpick here on the grey ones it says red flower- c'mon, it's pink :) I won't purchase them again just because of the pockets. Sorry."
4.0,Very small. The listing should of had a size posted.
4.0,Have gotten several compliment's on these earrings.  The only thing that I'm not real crazy about is the hoops bend easily.
4.0,"This dress was a great length about to my daughter's calfs, cute color for the fall and winter. My only issue is that the sleeves were not even, one was an inch or so too long. It was an easy enough thing to hide but still frustrating. Bought this for family pictures, so did not end up having time to return before the pictures. My daughter still wears and loves the dress."
4.0,"A bit on the thin side, but the price I paid, it is very good."
4.0,"The straps are a bit tricky coming out of the washing machine. Other than that, it's good"
4.0,These are really cute for working out. I am usually a small and they fit but run a bit small. I could have sized up to a medium for a mort comfortable fit. They are very stretchy and don’t feel restrictive. Also thick material and not see through. I think they are flattering and make my legs look slender.
4.0,"I've been searching high & low for a crossbody of this size - not too small, not too big.  I've been carrying the same rectangular crossbody for years, it is comfortable, but it is too small, & I'm bored with it.  Little did I know how hard it would be to find a replacement.  I like a zip top for quick/ easy access.  The flap top is not my preference.  The reason I went with this one - is that there is a zip pocket behind the flap.  This was the game changing feature for me.  I can put lesser used items in the front flap pocket.  I do wish it was a little wider than it is tall (but this isn't so tall that your stuff gets lost in the bottom).  This bag is a little slouchier than I expected - because the leather is quite soft.  I ordered the metallic olive & it is an absolutely gorgeous color.  The brushed gold/ brass hardware is top quality, & the crossbody strap is thick enough (I hate pencil thin crossbody straps).  The only thing that I have to say negative about this bag is I can see in a few tiny spots on the front of the bag, where the metallic olive color has 'chipped' off.  I'm hoping this chipping doesn't continue - because if it does, it will ruin the bag.  I'm worried about where I set it down (for the chipping reason) which bothers me a little because I don't want to feel like I have to 'protect' this bag.  I have dogs & am an active person, so my bags see mileage & the great outdoors.  Hopefully this holds up, but I have some doubts.  Otherwise, this is a beautiful bag with great storage/ features.  I'm impressed with the style/ quality of Latico's bags."
4.0,"Love love love this shirt, but it runs small. Sadly... I have to return it."
4.0,The material is nice. Got a size medium and was slightly bigger than I expected but it's good!
4.0,Lovely bag for someone who wants a bag a bit smaller than a tote haha. I am so used to big bags and wanted to try carrying something smaller for my shoulders sake. Fail! 4 star is for me otherwise it would be a 5star.
4.0,"This has the shape I like. Has structure in the front panel but not some big trucker maga hat looking thing. So much better than these wrinkly looking dad hat things that are so popular on here for some reason..<br />Not too big, but not too small. Nice rounded shape. Took one star off because they put their logo on the side of the hat. Really don't care for that."
4.0,"Nice product. I had been looking at Bottega, but $1000 is a bit much for wallet. I love this design and that it can hold so many cards. Color is a bit duller than expected, but I still like it a lot. Very soft feel. Good quality and craftsmanship. I did not pay attention that this one wasn't a wristlet. I would have liked it better if it was."
4.0,It is a good swimming goggle.
4.0,"Finger lights are great. They stay of your fingers, they do not bother you and they are really bright. I really love this item and recommend."
4.0,My 12 year old very thin granddaughter loves the sweater but it's pretty short in the length of the sweater itself and sleeve length. I guess I should have got a size larger but she is very slim. She'll wear it because she loves it but she'll outgrow it in a few months.
4.0,"I would have given this product 5 stars if they had been honest about the size; they are small!  Size 8 means size 8, not that it fits an eight year old!!!  Size 8 is for a 6 year old."
4.0,"These socks are great under Toms and other slip ons, the only down side is be careful about the washing machine.  If they go through with a load not in a seperate laundry bag the elastic all breaks making them useless."
4.0,Slight glare.
4.0,"The price is AMAZING! The fit is good, they are tight like leggings instead of loose like joggers. The only drawback is they attract lint and hair really bad!"
4.0,"If I had to reorder, I would not select the reading glasses with bifocals."
4.0,How do I go about returning It ? It was really cute but to small and now Idk what to do with It
4.0,This is a really cool zip up hoodie.  It's a little thin but quality is good.
4.0,Item is as expected. Took a long time to get here but it was advertised that way.
4.0,This is a really cute dress - for me it fit as expected since it’s obvious it’s going to be a tight body-con. It is a little see through so you’d definitely need nude or underwear to match the color you’re getting. I’m 5’2 and 6 months pregnant though and I ordered a medium and it fits great! I have larger hips and it wasn’t too snug. I wore it with a long black kimono.
4.0,very cute. as shown. my only complaint is that it is loose around the under armpit area and shows your bra
4.0,I like these slippers
4.0,This bag was a little more charcoal than black. It's a good sized bag and I can fit quite a lot in it. The inner and outer pockets are quite handy.
4.0,"Really nice pair of glasses. I only wear brown polarized lenses, so they are not as easy to find in pairs I like. The tint is slightly lighter than I hoped, but still provides sufficient sun protection. Very good experience with this sale."
4.0,"Smaller than I expected, maybe I have a giant head, but I don't think so. Needs to be on the last clasp to fit my noggin."
4.0,I bought larger than my normal size so it fits as I expected it would.
4.0,"Great quality; however, the clasp and chain are very small and the clasp is on the left so it is very hard to put on. That is my only complaint. The piece itself is beautiful."
4.0,"The item is comfortable. Slightly sheer. I ordered a beige color and it arrived definitely was more of an off-white than a beige. Overall, not bad for the price. I have a long torso so I sized up to a medium versus a small. I would say it does run slightly small so the medium fit perfect. Not sure if I’m going to keep it in this color or not yet but it’s definitely a cute casual piece."
4.0,"Read the reviews, and got a bigger size... wish I got an XL, I usually wear a M. Other than that super soft and cute"
4.0,"It's nice and warm, great color also, same as shown so you can were this color of blue with almost any of your blue outfits."
4.0,I’m only 5’8” but would prefer a longer inseam
4.0,"Due to its light color, the pink band does get dirty quite quickly. Otherwise a great watch!"
4.0,These are adorable but the seems started coming out pretty early on. I was surprised by the quality but would still recommend!
4.0,Really good sound from the headphones and the mic works well too.  The hat is a bit small for an adult male.
4.0,"These undies were exactly what I wanted, and even though they're a tiny bit snug, they do feel comfortable."
4.0,The dress is flattering and very nice on. I would buy another but a size down. It runs a bit larger.
4.0,I like this shirt a lot although not liking the special wash dry instructions as this is a workout shirt. Noticed that it shrinks if it’s dried with regular heat.
4.0,My wife loved the gift I love it!
4.0,"These are just the right height and comfortable but hard to get on if you have on sock maybe I needed to size up, these rain boots are light weight."
4.0,"Very cute, tight but definitely a cute dress"
4.0,"I received this scarf as a gift 2 years ago and purchased one to give as a gift last year. The one I recently purchased doesn’t have the same feel as the others; it is thinner and there is less depth to the color.<br />It still serves its purpose: scarf, blanket, travel pillow, beach blanket, baby swaddle, kids’ fort, etc. I do not travel without it."
4.0,"My first reaction when I opened the box this bag came in was, &#34;Wow, that's much smaller that I though.&#34;  However I discovered this is a nice size bag for a quick casual weekend trip.  I originally purchased this bag for just that sort of trip.  One that didn't require me to bring a several changes of clothing (jeans, chinos, polos, etc).  This bag was perfect for that.  Later I found another bag (Marc New York) that similar in style and structure that was a bit larger and nicely priced so I bought that one.  Now when I go away - depending on the trip - I use the larger bag for clothes and I use this bag for shoes, power cords, toiletries and so forth.<br /><br />If you're flying this bag conveniently fits under seats in airplanes.  Also, If you're staying at someone's house, as I was when I initially bought this bag, this bag take up very little space in a closet yet handsome enough to leave laying on the floor or from a door knob (obviously when you've emptied the contents) as I did.  Lastly, in a sea of tactical black nylon backpacks and duffel bags, this bag, with its vintage look add a bit of class to your stature as you stroll through an airport."
4.0,"Adorable, but I thought by the term fleece is misleading.  See photo for actual thickness and texture of blanket."
4.0,"Solid ring and comfortable to wear. The color is a very deep red, almost black until seen in the sunlight."
4.0,Small size for 5.1” 128 lbs fits great.  Nice top but when machine washed & dried out once - it changed drastically into an old looking top.  My advice is hand wash & do not use machine drier - it’ll ruin the material.
4.0,I'm able to fit everything I need and keep it organized.
4.0,For the price its a good deal...my grandson didn't like it due to it tying around his chin so he kept taking it off!!! If the child will leave it on it works!!!!
4.0,Ran a little on the small side compared to our other medium jerseys.. maybe size up if your kid is on the edge of that size.
4.0,"Be warned! Shorts are very short. Like 80's gym class short! Other than that, quality decent. Material relatively comfortable."
4.0,Excellent ! As advertised.
4.0,Exactly as pictured. Fairly heavy though and may slip off your head if not secured. Also have a really bad chemical smell. But will work well for cosplay.
4.0,These would be great for little kids. My son is in 4th grade and these are a bit small for him. Still useable and he loves the design. They were just smaller than I anticipated.
4.0,"I got married wearing this kippah. I chose this, because the white fabric and the embroidery of &#34;tree of life&#34; branches fit the occasion. A guest even asked me if this was a family heirloom, which I think reflects its quality. I'm giving this kippah 4 stars instead of 5, because I wish this was made of finer, longer-lasting materials. This seems to be made of the same stuff you'll find handed out at bar and bat mitzvahs, save for the embroidered on top. Since I only wore it one day this did not compromise its value, though I wouldn't feel confident it would last long if I was wearing this regularly. That said, who knows, it's now in the back of a drawer, waiting; eventually it might just become a family heirloom."
4.0,It fit me perfect. I just didnt like the color. I got the blue and i thought it was darker cause it seems darker in the picture. But its actually lighter blue. Like saphirre blue.
4.0,I bought these twice. Very comfortable and I received them quickly.?They were individually wrapped. I gave this a 4 because I wish they were cheaper.?
4.0,"These boots are definitely wearable, but they need to be stretched quite a bit to be comfortable. HOWEVER - I still love them. The color is nice and light, the material is soft, and the heel is the perfect height. They are a little tight on my calf as well but again, not unwearable."
4.0,"I was a little skeptical about this outfit but it was actually good quality! Like something I would get handmade at a boutique store. Ran a little big but still happy with this purchase, especially for the price"
4.0,Fits fine but I have a big head. So I'm pleased. I'm also bald and the hat does a great job of keeping the sweat out of my eyes. Would have given it 5 stars if the fabric had been a little heavier but that is not a big problem. Wash's good. Little shrinkage but stretches back out no problem. Going to order another one or two. Wish it came in a couple of colors.... may dye the next one.
4.0,"I love the shirts but based on the sizing chart I got them XL and probably needed a L, either way I wear them all the time!  Will be buying more."
4.0,Used for burlesque show! It was cute and I got loads of compliments! Only gripe is there aren't enough feathers. They were pretty sparse. I just hotglued some more on and it was all good!
4.0,"I'm  5'11"" and 185 lbs. Ordered a large and it's form fitting. Fits perfect and lightweight."
4.0,"Very cute, material was great. However, it was too small. I returned it and ordered the next size up. The color is so vibrant and beautiful! This is my 3rd time ordering a dress from Sunnow, and they never disappoint!"
4.0,They fit great and look great o me
4.0,My new fav shirt
4.0,the top is a lil large on me but the bottoms are fine. the fit is just that with a little room. I do have a belly so Im sure if i didnt it would fit a little better. I am 213lbs 5'3&#34; and I ordered the XL or the XXL I cant remember or see the size I ordered.
4.0,"This tool works well with 24 gauge metal with a fold-formed piece riveted to the top.  22- or 20-gauge metal is too thick to bend easily with this tool, unless there is just the one layer to the piece.  I bent the flat end trying to bend a heavier-gauge  bracelet.  But for the proper gauge metal, it give a fast, smooth, symmetrical bend."
4.0,"The positives: The cut, styling and length of this apron makes it appropriate for 1800's-early 1900's historical outfits/cosplay. The gathering is ample and gives a very attractive feminine fit - shaped at the waist, blousing out at the hips.  The fabric is soft and comfortable, and the color is even. The price is outstanding. It has handy pockets at the side seams.  The width of the apron at the waist is very ample - more that 32 inches - and the ties are long enough to tie in back or wrap around front.<br /><br />The negatives: The fabric is a little thin.  Especially with this light colored version, patterned shirts show through the bib which is only one layer thick.  The color is a little darker than I expected - darker than standard muslin. One side pocket had a hole in it where the fabric fell short of the serging.  The apron is so wide at the waist that I have to overlap it in back and tie the strings in the front, which actually looks quite cute."
4.0,Great product and excellent seller
4.0,"Comfy and has pockets. All that needs to be said. 5'4&#34;, 27 waist, ordered a small."
4.0,I'm 5 ft tall and the XL is too short in the arms. I like it so much that I'm going to exchange it. And the shipment came much faster than they estimated. That was a wonderful surprise!
4.0,"It's harder to loop the pony tail holder around it than I expected, but I find it very useful. It just takes a few moments to get it right"
4.0,Quite pretty however quailty of material would have meant more.
4.0,"very useful, good quality"
4.0,"i wear 9.5, bought a 10, fits more like a 9 but still works well. Dries very quickly, great for shower room"
4.0,Very nice and reasonably priced
4.0,"Brim on hat is extra long. Nice to keep sun out of your face, but catcher the wind to easy in my jeep."
4.0,"Very pretty,  Fits good, ,  just wish it had a lining."
4.0,"I must say, when the silicone watches arrived, I was ready to send them back. They were not what I expected. First, there are NO instructions. That threw me off. You have to go to the item description on amazon, scroll down, and the seller left instructions on how to operate the watches. Once you figure it out, the watches are  easy to set and program. Second, they did not fit. Again, I had to get my scissors handy and cut the band to fit my wrist. Overall, for all the watches, this is a good price. I searched eBay and they run around $3-5, per watch. So far, I am happy I did not send them back. I was looking for something  for work and they work perfectly. I did notice when it is sunny outside, you have to shield the watch to see the time."
4.0,"I really like this cap, but there is no elastic anywhere on it. As a result it is a little hard to get all of your hair into when putting it on. Once it's on, it is comfortable."
4.0,Looks nice and feel warm.  Only thing is hard to put on and take off for 6 years old ...
4.0,"These waders first out of the box seemed to be of good quality. Although I haven't had them out on a hot day, they are breathable and should be good for summer days when I don’t want to wear my neoprene waders. These waders came with a quick repair kit. Not a necessity but very nice to have if the need arises. There is a good sized zipper pouch in the front as well as a “hoodie” style pocket. The booties are neoprene and comfortable on the feet. They also came with cuffs built in which I like because it kept sand a gravel out of my boots and I don’t need to buy more / attach separate cuffs. The only negative with these waders is I thought they were relatively baggy. I think they may run that way. I got XXL and am 6’5” 235 lbs. I exchanged them for XL and they fit perfectly. All in all these waders are lightweight and are built with quality materials. They should last for quite a long time."
4.0,Fun glasses for that hip person in your life.
4.0,"Great first impression out of the box!  Very light weight. The lenses are excellent.  The fit was a little tight on the bridge of my nose, but with a minor adjustment, they fit comfortably as expected.  Excellent value for the price of &#60;$12. Reserved one star due to being a little sceptical about long term durability."
4.0,I love these earings I got so much compliment I will definitely wear them again.
4.0,"The navy is a beautiful pattern and moves gracefully as you do.<br />Post-pregnancy, I sometimes wear small and sometimes medium. I'm 5'2', 120 lbs, small chested. Based on reviews, I sized up and ordered a large. I love it! It is a little too long for me but skims the floor with wedges. It wraps perfectly (especially for breastfeeding) and it would easily accommodate a camisole for more<br />coverage. It is cool and comfortable and disguises the lingering baby weight around my middle. Great price for a lovely product!"
4.0,"Great buckle! I used one to make an awesome low profile belt for everyday use as well as hiking. The two slots needed to be enlarged a little as I was working with tubular webbing.  Flat webbing works great with this buckle un-modified. The buckles are slightly bent which helps keep the webbing from slipping, but they are aluminum so a light wack with a hammer flattens them, if you are using them to make a belt like I did.<br /><br />Wish I could find some to fit 1.5"" webbing."
4.0,"Super cute bag! However, the band snapped with the second wear. The company fully refunded my money so I am content."
4.0,Very flattering. Finally a dress I feel good about that I'm not drowning in. After having a baby a year ago I haven't been able to wear anything like I used to. I was so subconscious about my weight I was just buying huge dresses that looked like moo moos. I figured out pretty quick to get stuff that's a little form fitting so I don't look like I'm wearing a balloon! This gives me a waist while still hiding my tummy. I will say not for people with large chests.
4.0,"After reading some reviews and checking the size chart, I went with a large in the &quot;linen&quot;. I'm 5'3&quot; 36 chest, 28&quot;waist  and I was swimming in the large. The medium is big too, but I'm keeping it. The print is adorable and I just love this shirt. Also very comfortable."
4.0,"I bought these to go running in, but when I run they slide down so I am constantly having to pick them up and fix them. I bought a medium (I think), I'm 5'3 and 150. Love the pocket option for my phone, that will not come out when I run. If I  were just hanging around the house maybe these would be perfect."
4.0,"Make sure to use the size chart shown on the shirt photos (the last picture), and not the Amazon sizing chart link. I took a gamble and chose Medium - my usual size with Amazon clothing --  instead of Small, as it would have been the closest choice if I went for the other chart on the photos. It still worked great, but I would have preferred a snug fit.  This long-sleeve hoodie shirt is great for cool temperatures; it keeps you warm and comfortable enough for a 60-70 degree F temperature weather. I don't mind cold temperatures, and this shirt works well for me since I can still feel the coolness but stay comfortable enough not to feel very cold.  I was expecting to receive an olive color shirt as shown in the photos, but the shirt was actually more on the greener spectrum than olive. So, just be aware of the color discrepancies."
4.0,"Fits as it looks on the photo.  Material is very light and breathable, which is ideal for working out."
4.0,very cute but a little smaller than I expected
4.0,I used it on a pair of silver earrings and it works as described with little chance of spillage like there was with the jar of liquid cleaner that I dropped and ruined a set of new towels with before. Also there isn't that horrible awful smell that you have with the other liquid silver cleaner. I think there may be a little smell but not much. I used it on a pair of relatively flat drop earrings and it worked beautifully. I'm not sure how it would work on more intricate silver pieces with any depth to them though? We'll see how long the cleaning lasts now.
4.0,"It's good quality and looks really cute, but it was too big for our newborn.  At only a week old and just barely over 7 pounds, it was far too loose fitting for her to wear."
4.0,"This item fits great EXCEPT it's a little low around the arms for me. I throw a white cami under it, and it's perfect! To be fair, I am a size 28/30, so it could be just be because I had to order such a large size!"
4.0,The earrings were adorable but the tassel ones were just ok
4.0,"Was as expected, but the zipper was dysfunctional."
4.0,"It is a beautiful hat. Great quality, I love that it is bendable in the tip of the hat... I can shape it however I wish. Can't wait to wear it on vacation!"
4.0,They Seem to be more short wasted then the pictures lead one to believe - esp. in  the back.
4.0,Love it!!!! 4 stars because I ordered a 2 pack but only got 1.<br /><br />Amazing fit though. Seriously..!
4.0,"Great luggage set. I received all 3 pieces in great condition. The lock on the side worked well. I ended up returning it because the color white in the photo is not accurate to the picture. To be fair, they did describe it as &#34;Ivory white&#34; it is more of a creamy beige color. I think I may reorder the set in black once it's back in stock."
4.0,Order a size bigger just to be safe ans it fitted prefect.. only issue is the label on the dress was seeable so had to be carefully removed
4.0,"Nice dress.  Nice fabric. Unfortunately, I couldn't use it as it was small."
4.0,"SO comfy and cute on. Only issue is it is almost completely see-through, so needs a full body white slip. But worth it. Fits perfectly size M (true to my size) with room for growth."
4.0,Cheap and good quality
4.0,Bag is just the right size to carry the essentials when going out.
4.0,Had these from Costco and was happy to find on Amazon! Just what I wanted.
4.0,Great for the price. I really like the design.  Really like they send a nice case to protect them when not in use.
4.0,"This product is a must for anyone who has suede shoes.  Clean them, then protect against dirt and water to keep them properly."
4.0,good outfit
4.0,"I’m only giving this a 4 Star because they are great sunglasses BUT, I ordered twice BOTH times I ordered the red and gold and BOTH times I got Pink and gold. I ended up keeping the pink ones because like I said they are nice sunglasses and the second pair I gave away as a gift. It’s just upsetting that I never got the red ones that I wanted so bad."
4.0,All right in the colors and all. just the size cart was wrong.A small was 30-32.I might try to get a Medium see if it will fit better.
4.0,It's not excellent quality but looks beautiful and I have received many compliments wearing it!
4.0,The band (not sure if it is leather or not) is quite thick but still conforms well after wearing a bit.  It is a nice looking watch and it keep time.  What more could you ask.
4.0,Light weight stylish bracelet. Adjusts well to desired length. Looks like solid gold for a fraction of the money 🤑
4.0,"No major complaints, just be forewarned that you will need to air them out due to smell."
4.0,"A lot of reviews state that the material is &#34;costumy&#34; but they don't really explain what type of costumy it is. It is a shiny polyester material. I am a 32DD cup size and was worried about ordering a small. A lot of crop tops are too tight around my chest, and too loose around my waist. This particular item fit very well, not too tight, not too loose. Also keep in mind that it seems as though this shirt is shipped from different warehouses and possibly manufacturers depending on what size you order. The small size supported Amazon prime, but some other sizes don't."
4.0,Very cute shirt…reeked terribly of vinegar!
4.0,"Great quality, runs just a bit on the smaller side but still stretchy enough to be fine.  Seems well made and thick.  Overall very impressed as these seem like more expensive leggings- they remind me of my Zellas which cost a lot more!"
4.0,The bathing suits are supper cute but do purchase them a size bigger. Very stylish!!
4.0,"Super cute, but doesn't look like the picture that is shown.  It looks more like the cocoon sweater"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:c2a5b3769afb86021c4c0722a1456aac]] Picked these up for a tenth of what the oakleys were going for!  Pretty nice sunglasses, not sure if I like the air vents on top and that it doesn't really snap in place. If you twist the frames a little bit, the lens kind of pops out of place.  They also included these weird glasses that I popped out as well that I didn't see in the initial product offering. I'm not sure what the purpose of it is but it came off easily.  I would have given it five stars if the lens didn't just sit in a groove.  I do like that they're very similar to the oakleys. I would never pay $150 for something I can leave behind anywhere.  They are polarized very nicely and there are no blind spots while cycling.  The carrying case is very very good. I would expect to pay 5 to $10 just for that.  All in all, I think the price they are selling given the quality is fair."
4.0,First try on sticks good. 2nd time will probably require tight shirt or dress to hold in place. Love it though going to wear at my wedding.
4.0,This dress was so cute but it was WAY too big and I had to return it. Consider ordering a size smaller! Wish it had fit!
4.0,"had a hard time opening the latches on these, one actually got stuck and they are easy to bend. Once I was able to get them in my ears though I got many compliments on them. They are very nice earrings. Not heavy, not bulky. I think they are just right and live up to their description."
4.0,Bought for Halloween.
4.0,"This is a cute little summer bag. It is on the small side. I don't think it will hold up to rough use, but it would be great for lunch or shopping."
4.0,"For the price, this is a good case. It fits my IPhone 7 perfectly. The buttons are way easier to push than some of the other cases I’ve ordered on here. I haven’t dropped the phone (yet), but the edges are raised and it seems pretty durable. My only complaint is that the material of the phone is not ideal. It’s got that smooth, rubber-like texture that attracts scratches and marks. I’ve only had the case 2 days and it’s already all marked up. Other than that, good case!"
4.0,I love these!!!! They are tight at first but they stretch easy. I get so many compliments on these. The shipping is a bit slow but that was to be expected.
4.0,exactly what it shows
4.0,They are nice. My sons liked theirs… well the sentiment for sure!
4.0,This was a gift for my sister who does not have a lot of cards and doesn't carry a lot of cash. Love the zipper coin section
4.0,Kept warm snd dry longer thsn expected. Vslue for price
4.0,"Nice, thick material, fits well and is super cute. Stains easily. Otherwise, good bang for your buck."
4.0,It’s cute for what it is but I really prefer mud cloth itself instead of a print of that material. But like I said it’s cute and the price isn’t bad.
4.0,"Pretty but a little large, not as fitted as the one made by Johnny (MBJ WT737)."
4.0,First & foremost the jacket runs extremely small. I usually wear a size small for the most part. I’m 5’11” about 150 pounds. But I’m extremely particular about my clothes & how they fit me. They didn’t have this in a small and I figured order a size up anyway cause of it being foreign. I order a medium receive it and it’s ripped. Return order another and was Way to short. Return again. Ordered a large. And I’m honestly still not all the way happy with the way it fits. I almost feel like I could of got an XL but then the sleeves prolly would have been to long for my liking. Other then that my only complaint would be the color difference. It’s not tan like it looks in the pics. It’s more of a brown. The material is also much different then it looks. But it’s still a good color and all around a decent jacket but I’ve yet to wear it. If I have any complaints after I wear it I’ll update.
4.0,Thicker fabric than I was expecting but great shirt otherwise!
4.0,NOT AS BULKY AS MY OTHER
4.0,"I ordered a medium but it was still shorter than a crop top. Still super cute but not as pictured<br /><br />5’6 150lbs - med , should<br />Have ordered the large if it would have been a little longer.<br /><br />I have washed it - did not shrink"
4.0,"Super super cute! But the ends wear the brown thread is, cuts the width of the cuff down for size. Too bad to, because I am a wide calf person and they don't fit. Too small because of the way they were made."
4.0,Feels great and has held up to daily use. Fitment was easy to adjust.
4.0,Pretty - was happy with this purchase.
4.0,Great for a 20s party. Needed heals otherwise it drug on the ground too much
4.0,"Nice shirt. I like the ruffle at the end of the sleeve. It fits true to size, so you can order your regular size.<br />Smells pretty bad and has to be washed before it can be worn.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This review reflects my own and unbiased opinion. I am not affiliated with the seller nor do I get any privileges or discounts for writing this review."
4.0,Beautiful bras...very sticky...just wish there were use and care instructions this was my wifes first one.
4.0,Great quality but runs large.
4.0,"They look wonderful, my only complaint is that the back don't stay on tight enough. I almost lost one when taking off my winter coat. I'm going to have to replace the back's with those little clear rubber ones. As I don't want to lose them. They perfectly match a Betsey Johnson necklace I own."
4.0,Great for the price but I can tell these are going to fall apart easily. Cheaply made but you get what you pay for.
4.0,no issues on my door
4.0,A little big but it works
4.0,"This product is beautiful, but after a few weeks, the paint starts to rub off."
4.0,Just too bad they lost in their tournament game before I even got to wear it!
4.0,"They aren't kidding when they say over sized lol. These are quite large, but they get the job done! They seem to be decent quality as well, given my toddlers have &#34;played&#34; with them a few times over the past 3 weeks and they are still in tact."
4.0,The sunglasses look really nice and is block the sun and light from hurting your eyes. But it’s only for people with smaller head shapes because they wouldn’t fit me. But they fit my dad nicely👍🏼
4.0,Nice fitted jacket. Don't let the light weight fool you. It is very warm!!
4.0,Decent quality for a toddler. My baby loved it.
4.0,"I am 5&#34;6' 130lbs,  I ordered a XXXL because all the reviews said to go larger, it fits fine but a little tight in the shoulders. I should have went one more X. Other than that it's just what I expected, well made, and thick. Perfect for cooler weather when wanting to wear a dress."
4.0,Kept me warmer
4.0,"Really cute and I do love it, but my rings are too large to stay on without sliding over the butterfly and falling off. I wear a 10/10.5 womens ring, so I do just have abnormally thick fingers. I just took the chain off, put the ring in the butterfly, and put the chain back on."
4.0,Love the color n fit perfect for my lil girl
4.0,"Sturdy and just enough pockets for me! Just wish I would have picked another color. Don't like the Camel. Looks cheap to me. I should have done the Coffee or Black. For the price, a good deal."
4.0,small bot fine for my daughter.
4.0,"Very soft and comfortable. Pretty stretchy which is fine for the causal use I give it. Loose fitting, not much shape, but that’s what I expected for the size I bought (xl)"
4.0,"I ordered color #3, the olive green floral. After reading the reviews, I sized up which was not at all necessary. This particular color must fit true to size more than the others. I normally wear a L/XL(for a more forgiving fit to my midsection,) so I ordered an XXL, especially worried about the sleeves being too tiny as most reviewers mentioned. All around it was just too roomy, so I have to return. Shame because otherwise it is a REALLY cute shirt, and surprisingly well made with thicker fabric."
4.0,Very nice but needed a better clasp for the necklace.
4.0,"Cuter in person!  Runs a little smaller than usual shoe size, but they're leather, so I'm confident they'll stretch out a bit."
4.0,Stands a bit tighter than other Polo small sizes.
4.0,"Not very breathable, so my hands have a tendency to get sweaty. Very warm though."
4.0,Good material and Professional looking without being overstated. I gave it 4 stars because having put my 15&#34; lap top in with my purse etc it was quite heavy. Overall good buy.
4.0,they seem to help achy feet
4.0,Order for my husband.  Love the hat but wish it was fitted.
4.0,"I've begun to notice after the third order that a lot of this jewelry is geared for adolescents or small in nature.<br /><br />Now with that said, this is still a nice item.<br /><br />Packaged in a green pull-top box with a felt-lined foam pad and a cleaning cloth<br /><br />Made in China"
4.0,My son loves this sweater. Super comfy and has room for him to grow.
4.0,"This costume is so cute, it would be perfect for a babies first Halloween especially since it’s thick and warm. The fake plush fur has some padding under it for warmth, and it gives the costume a filled-out look. I thought it would be more like a onesie than a costume, so it unfortunately won’t get much use since it won’t fit by next Halloween. I didn’t expect it to essentially be a gutted stuffed animal. It IS adorable, we just don’t have any costume events coming up. It would work for a trick or treat outfit or photoshoot, but my plans of having a cute fox onesie for a daily use for my baby won’t work with this. The material would be too cumbersome and difficult to clean on a regular basis."
4.0,Soy de Montevideo- Uruguay. Cumple con las expectativas
4.0,Purchased this as a gift for my mother-in-laws birthday and she love it.
4.0,bter than i thought it would be. the stones are a little shaggy but it is a very attractive necklace.
4.0,"I like the bag the only thing wrong with it other than the strap being hard to straighten out was the strap loop.<br />There are supposed to be two strap loops, on each side for the strap to latch onto and there was only one.<br />So I can't use the strap at all, I like the color I like the size.<br />I did end up contacting the seller. They were very helpful.<br />They said they would ship a replacement to me."
4.0,The hat is a good hat with a comfortable fit. I bought it to work in when I’m outside in the heat and unfortunately it traps too much heat therefore it’ll be downgraded to cooler days. All in all it’s a good hat
4.0,"For some reason it makes me look more busty than I truly am. This may be a bonus for some, but it makes me feel a little self conscious. 😳"
4.0,Love this nose ring. Super cute. I have gotten quite a few compliments. It is a little difficult to put in at first and if u have a new piercing I wouldn't suggest it. Overall I think it's a great product.
4.0,"Love these shoes on my 2 year old son. No blisters, perfect fit."
4.0,"Good quality & style, but a bit smaller than expected. The bra cup is padded, the material is lightweight and stretchy, and the colors are vibrant."
4.0,Love it.  Thanks
4.0,I am a small but these only come in a s/m so they run big but are do able! material is great.
4.0,"I bought this for a wedding in August. 2019. When it came, I was worried at first it was going to be a bit too much. But I think it will be perfect with my dress."
4.0,"It's a very neat looking pair of sunglasses, you don't see your prescription lenses under the glasses & it has good glare protection"
4.0,"These are very nice skinny jeans. They are true to size, feel comfortable, and look nice. The fabric is a little thinner than I expected, but it's okay. These are actually good for the transitory weather between summer and fall. I am happy with these and highly recommend."
4.0,"got this for my husband as part of his birthday present. it fits his blaze perfect and was fairly easy enough to change the size of if you follow the directions. the only thing is every once in a while you need to make sure that all the pins stay in place otherwise it will fall off. he doesn't wear it when he works out, he keeps with the usual band that came with it for that (he's a runner and weight lifter)"
4.0,"my daughter doesn't like it on her, somehow dress is cute."
4.0,"A very nice watch , my husband love the quality."
4.0,"When fabric stretches , the colors fade but good shirt anyway"
4.0,I really enjoyed this shirt! It fit well.
4.0,"A little snug, but nonetheless some great thigh highs."
4.0,"Well-made sandal with a bottle opener as a bonus. Ran a little small, would think about ordering up a size."
4.0,Feet hurt due to working on ladders causing fasciitis.  Needed something to walk in that help.  So far these are pretty good.
4.0,"Overall, it looks nice and the quality seems good for the price. Only problem is the awkward length. I'm 5'7 and it's at my ankles... And will likely get shorter after washing. Debating whether I should return."
4.0,"This swim top really does provide the perfect coverage. It does have a significant amount of padding, when jumping in the pool, it did take longer to dry off in the sun than normal. It is constructed well and did wash well in cooler water by hand."
4.0,"The hat is great and it was delivered on time and packed perfectly.  However, I ordered a MED size based on the reviewers comments that it was sized large.  I wear between a 7 1/8 and 7 1/4 so my experiece says go with the larger of the 2 if you are in between sizes.  It is a great hat and I will reorder a Large when it is in stock."
4.0,"The buttons were sewn, so we have to manually cut those open. Other than that, it's really good for the price. If you're about 4'11""-5' and about 100lbs the small will fit perfectly."
4.0,Kind of confusing to put on but looks just like the picture
4.0,"90 Degree by Reflex is one of my favorite brands for yoga pants/capris.  This is a beautiful color I received! The 4 * is only because I was unsure what the material would be, some of the pants are a slippery smooth and some are more like cotton, I prefer that cotton likes ones which these weren't.  Still great!"
4.0,I like how this t-shirt looks on me.  The size chart is very accurate.  I love the print.
4.0,"Nice outfit but ordered two sizes up for 9 year old grandson (size 14). The only down side is that it has a plastic zipper which broke after second wear. Plan to replace with better zipper. Otherwise, it's a very warm and nice looking suit."
4.0,ok but large like the feel of the belt
4.0,"Loved the bright colors and the fabric  softness. Overall, it was a good purchase."
4.0,Really cute and stay on well enough but they’re a little difficult to get on. Overall I’m definitely happy with them!
4.0,This is a beautiful dress! My only complaint is that the armpits are made very small. I would order already one size bigger if not 2 especially if u want the fit like the picture! I bought for myself but my daughter fell in love and it fits her comfortably so I gave it too her. I really really LOVE this dress it's fun and the slits make it airy even on a hot day allows air to flow and keep u cool. But this would even be great for fall with a jean jacket and boots! I will be ordering another one for myself it's really light fabric and a wear anywhere kind of dress.
4.0,"Had a blast wearing this costume it was easy to move about in.  As a larger person i bought the 4X and my only problem was it was only a c cup so i had nipple issues all night as I am a bigger cup size.  Second night i wore the dress I put a black lace shirt on with it and it was great.  Lent it to a friend and he look amazing in it to.  Its a great hit at any party, good quality fabrics that will last a few years.  I can see this dress keeping will in my costume collection for years to come."
4.0,"Having grown up with Karate Kid, and now engrossed in Cobra Kai, I wanted a CK logo shirt.  This one is very nice and I love the logo.  Unfortunately, mine ran small, especially the length of the shirt (hem could be longer).  I like my shirts un-tucked to come down below my belt line.  This one kind of sat at my waist.  I ordered a 2XL and am 6'2"" for reference."
4.0,"I purchased this in August as a gift and we just opened it and the matching purse was missing. Can it be replaced, just the purse,love the coat."
4.0,I like the prints and the style. I just wish it was a little wider at the bottom and that it was a cooler fabric since I live in the tropics..
4.0,"I like this wallet, but it's a little bigger than I had pictured.  It seems functional and I think I will get used to it.  Pretty pink color and doesn't look cheap.  I would recommend this product."
4.0,"Cute, but the strap does not stay put."
4.0,"I'm always a little nervous buying clothing online, but this one was beautiful! Fit as expected. I'm 5'9 and about 225 and ordered a 2XL. Fit great! The material is a little scratchy but in good weather I don't think this would be a bother. Came with a sash that fit well and the length hit just right so that I still felt modest wearing it. Love how this makes my apple shape still look curvy! Would recommend, especially for cooler weather. :-)"
4.0,Ordered one size larger and it fit really good.
4.0,The art looks good . cane in the mail with a dent though
4.0,Mask was very cute for my work costume party. Clearly I was a black cat. Only concern was the wire in the nose… it kept popping up and making the mask slide off my nose.
4.0,Super cute! Looks just like the picture! Quality was pretty good. Better than I expected for a cheap purse like this. It does have a weird smell though. I’m hoping that goes away though
4.0,"The only thing that bothered me about the figure is that the black tubes on the sword are removable (or cheap construction?), and one of her hair pieces is lose. It's not falling out everytime i move her, i just find it irritating that the hair is not securely attached.<br /><br />Other than that no complainants."
4.0,"I bought one of these a few months back. Working as a dishwasher in a restaurant and needed something that would keep me dry so I can fully concentrate on my work. Tried this and after a little adjustment on the tie on the neck, was just right for me. My only gripe is that after 3 months (depending on how you use it), the PVC material will dry out especially if its been exposed to chemicals such as bleach or other cleaning agents. This will leave holes or cracks on the apron. Nonetheless, since the apron is so affordable, I think replacing it every few months or so is not something to worry about. Gave it 4 stars all in all. Totally recommend."
4.0,This was a great fit jus wish is was a little longer. Im 5”10.5 with long torso and longer legs it came down to top of my calf
4.0,pretty sheer scarf
4.0,I bought this as an Xmas gift for my Niece-in-law whom is a nurse. It’s very cute and I think she’d like it!!
4.0,The dress was nice but not what I was expecting. The length is very short
4.0,"I like the material and the padding, not too much just enough to sit comfortably on my stationary bike.  The waist band is narrower than I was expecting.  I am used to a wider one but it works."
4.0,I will definitely up-size for any future orders because the material doesn’t have the same ‘give’ that cotton boxers do. I have no way of ‘scientifically’ checking the Radiation protection and so am relying on those positive reviews that do.
4.0,Very pretty colors. Super soft. Does run a bit small tho
4.0,Nice suit just a bit small.
4.0,Colors are bright
4.0,"They don't look exactly like the picture, but they are cute. The package I received came with ten--two of each color."
4.0,very cute dresses I was pleased
4.0,"Absolutely beautiful, but chain is 16"", and not 18"" as advertised. Too short for person for who this was to be a gift."
4.0,True to size dress. I’m a size 14 but opted for size XL since I wanted a looser fit. The dress doesn’t have stretch. It is lined. The only thing I noticed was the sleeves weren’t the same length. Might be a factory defect? But it’s not that noticeable.
4.0,"Like the hat and the fit, seems to be well made.  Brim got beaten up and flattened a little in shipping.  I wish the print colors were brighter.  4 Star rating because it was not delivered when first stated, colors a little duller than I would have preferred."
4.0,"Very cute, but way too big. I am 5'4 and about 127 pounds, bigger on the bottom, and pretty small on the top. I usually wear a small. This tank in small fit me like a large. Bummed."
4.0,But still awesome. Has room to grow
4.0,"They advise ordering a size larger than normal; I ordered a size larger then returned for a xxl and still to small, but now I've worn them and can't return."
4.0,Its cute but the quality is like the price
4.0,"Information stated that there were ankle bungees.  Incorrect. No ankle bungees on product recieved.  The bottom of the pants were small cuffs, not regular size with ankle bungees.  I am sure that the company feels that with the discounted price they can say anything, but they were not honest!  Not honest about the ankle bungees!!!"
4.0,delicate silver chain with little stars spaced about an inch apart - adorable and works either by itself or with other jewelry.  My daughter loves it
4.0,love the variety of lengths
4.0,Very good quality and very firm support. I bought my normal size and they are somewhat difficult to get on and off. If you need the firm support these will do the job and seem like they will last a long time.
4.0,Very good my girl friend loves its but do be careful the inner string can come undon and break but over all very good
4.0,I was pleasantly surprised when I received these.  They were much nicer than I expected and a much heavier weight.  I feel a bit ignorant though because I could not find the plastic covering that goes over what you insert.  I sent the seller a message and the next afternoon they responded. Then I felt really ignorant because I had not figured out that the top screws off to add the picture.  I'm leaving this review just in case I am not the only person that has a brain cramp when they receive these!  I ordered 2 pairs to do gifts for 2 people.  I only had the one night (the day of delivery) to complete one of the pairs so I had to return it.  I kept the other pair as I had a couple of extra days for that set and it turned out great.
4.0,Great small backpack for  everything. Quite spacious inside. Love using it when I go hiking or apple picking(any picking). I even use it when I run errands as it a lot of space. I can put about 3-4 normal sized water bottle with room to spare.<br />Recommend<br />Its cute too!
4.0,Just received it today and it's a great sling bag for the cost. Just what I needed for walking and short trips.
4.0,"This is a remembrance of our brothers who have fallen in the line of duty. As well as, a symbol of our support for fellow officers. Honor and respect for those who wear the badge humbly.<br />Just a side note; The back clamp needs to be reinforced. It does wear out rather quick, as in the first day of wearing it for me. Otherwise great pin."
4.0,"The fabric on this mask, although cute (covered in dogs!), is quite thin.  It's 2 layers, but the layers are thin.  I prefer quilter's cotton for weave and stability to keep the mask from touching my mouth, but this mask functions ok.  There is a piece of metal on the nose to help mold it to your face.  The straps are adjustable, which is handy because the fabric portion of the mask is quite large.  I have a fairly wide face so it's not a huge issue for me, but I would imagine it would be an issue if you have a narrow face.  I washed the mask in color-safe detergent and the dyes in the fabric bled a bit (see last photo).  I don't mind because it almost looks like it was meant to be splotchy, but I think it's important to mention.<br /><br />I also really appreciate that the company has donated to Best Friends and that the mask has the orange Best Friends logo.  I have the utmost respect and admiration for the organization.  Note: The bandana is actually a bandana-style mask (for humans).  However, I thought it was a matching bandana for your dog so now my dog and I match :)"
4.0,Super nice dress very nice material but it came in dirty :( that’s the only reason I gave it one less star.<br />I’m 5’0” and 153 pounds a little on the chubbier side and I got a MED it was perfect. I got the burgundy and it’s boarder line plum/fuchsia in color 😒
4.0,"cute, but wish I had ordered a size up :(. I am 5'1 and this dress is almost too short, which never happens to me!"
4.0,Beautiful chain but too short
4.0,"They are heavy wool gloves with fingertips meant for working electronic touch screens and touch pads, just like it says on the package. I tested this with a touch pad (not touch screen) on a laptop and an iPad mini, and that aspect of it seems to work just fine, although it does make my fingers feel clumsy when trying to touch options that are close together. They seem to be knitted to the same fabric weight as heavy boot socks. The fabric does feel a little harsh, although I can tolerate it on my hands, especially when I've been moisturizing with hand cream. I don't think I'd be too happy wearing this fabric on more sensitive areas like my back, though. I should note that I have small, slender hands and these gloves are big and loose on me; I am not complaining as I do size up in anticipation that a thing will shrink, but someone else may say something different. I am in Florida and it seems like it will meet my needs as far as winter gloves go; the main reason I was specifically going for gloves with high wool content is because I do go north for things like funerals and I want to have real winter clothes for those occasions. So on rare occasions we get really cold in Florida, as well as needing to be outside for maybe an hour at a time in real wintry conditions in New England and the Great Lakes regions. As to whether this will satisfy people who actually live in those areas and want to be outdoors for hours at a time, it's not for me to say."
4.0,I gave this to my son to give to his dad on Father Day and he said that he loved it
4.0,"Very happy with this purchase . Honestly , you never know what you’re going to get when you order online , but this shirt is very cute and comfy . Order a size up if you want to have it off the shoulder a little bit .."
4.0,"I am only giving 4 stars because all the reviews said this color and style was not see through, well it is! So I just have to wear black panties and its fine. I went on a very long hike with these the first day they arrived and I have to say they were extremely comfortable and light. Kept my legs cools and did not get too hot at all, even though it was about 80 degrees outside without any shade cover! I highly recommend these! I am 5'10&#34; and weigh 154 lbs and am in between sizes around 8-10 but I got a large and glad I did because they fit perfectly, if I would have listened to the size chart recommendations I would have gotten a medium and they probably would be too tight. I think I am going to get another pair while they are on sale!"
4.0,The colors are great for matching with various outfits.  I was surprised by the quality when considering they came directly from China.  They are not a good fit for a small wrist.  If I wear the watch at my wrist the stem of the watch presses into my skin.  I have  to wear the watch higher up on the forearm.  If you have an average to large wrist--these should work fine as they have plenty of wristband adjustment holes.
4.0,"Good quality, fit isn't as good as it is shown."
4.0,Bought for my best friend who loves elephants. They are super cute. I didn’t expect them to last forever because they are not plated or anything but I expected to get more than a week in before my wrist turned green. Cute little gift would probably be perfect for preteens/ teens.
4.0,Little small but will work
4.0,Really cute but definitely runs a bit big.
4.0,A little too tight but they fit my daughter perfectly
4.0,"A pretty decent pant, but the capri fit is a bit bizarre. I think it's just because I have thick thighs. Comfortable and fairly modest, although you might want to wear something underneath if you're going out in public. Good for yoga, which is what I bought them for."
4.0,"I love the look of it, and I definitely love how easy it is to put on/off for the shower. And since I have a very small wrist, it does actually fit.<br />I however do NOT love how it comes off in a flash, the magnetic bit attack my metal buttons, or how the finish is fading much faster than expected after 3 months use. Granted, I wear my watch everyday, you can obviously see the dull silver popping from behind the gold finish on the band.<br /><br />ie: Just don't wear metal things or wear it outside a lot and it will be fine."
4.0,They fit a bit tight but they are really soft and comfortable!!!😊😊
4.0,"The day I put these on, my foot pain from  fasciitis was gone. I do have a problem with the heel part not being quite high enough and sometimes backing up, I walk out of the shoes.... I will buy another pr but a diff style. The material on top and side is inclined to bend according to how you walk but still comfy. I also have lymphedema of legs and feet."
4.0,"So, I picked up these boots for my Amethyst (Stephen Universe) cosplay, since finding the exact pair from the show was probing difficult.  I have a wide foot, and normally wear a size 9W, so went up a size in hopes that they would fit, and they did.  I wear them with thin socks, as with boot socks they would be too tight on my foot.  I like that they have the option of wearing the sides halfway folded down, and the inside has a Burberry Brit-esque plaid on the inside, but the lining is a thin foam, and I don't feel as though it will last very long if the boots are worn this way most of the time.  The sole feels like it would be a bit slippery on ice, but since I'm in the South, this isn't an issue for me.  The breaking in process wasn't terrible, but I felt that the heel rubbed a bit more than other pairs of boots that I own.<br /><br />I don't plan on wearing these from day to day, so for a cosplay only pair, they will do well for me!  Don't expect Doc quality for these and you'll be fine."
4.0,My 9 year old love his jersey nice quality...
4.0,I thought this belt would be a lot thinner but overall it is a good belt for the price. It was way to long but they enclosed a tool that can make it shorter which is a plus.
4.0,nice but def can tell its costume jewelry
4.0,"This top is made of 95% cotton and 5% spandex.  It has some nice stretch to it, but it’s not overly stretchy.  Nice and soft.  Not as thick as some sweatshirts, but nice for layering or a “moderate” thickness top.<br /><br />I have the size XL.  It measures 28.5” from the top of the shoulder to the bottom. The sleeves measure 20” from where they attach at the shoulder to the end.  The cuffs are a wide 5” across.  24”. .  .23.5”. . . 24” across going down.  There are 2.5” slits on each side at the bottom.<br /><br />This top is Made in China and being sold by a Chinese company on Amazon.  At the current price of twenty-four bucks, it’s a bit expensive for Made in China, but a nice top operall."
4.0,I like my new sunglasses but the only reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of five is because of the color. I had ordered the black shades but received them in brown which was alright and they're pretty but not the color I had wanted. I'll keep them because they look and feel great on and the color looks good with my complexion.
4.0,Nice cat eye shape sunglasses. Complaints the face. Makes me feel like a movie star. I got the red frames with the grey polarized lenses. The lenses have a fun red-orange flash mirror coating on them. The frame is a very light weight metal with adjustable nose pads. Comes with a nice hard case and cleaning cloth.
4.0,"This necklace matches the earrings and ring I had purchased a while ago. I had waited for this to come back in stock to complete this lovely set.  My only concern is that I wish the chain wasn’t so delicate, however.  It gets tangled pretty easily."
4.0,"Wow! Works well. Some serious power control. Okay, had to peel it off, but it works."
4.0,"Was a bit too big and long on me. I'm 5'1 and about 105 pounds. The sleeves went down to my elbows, and the dress was a little too long, as well as the waist not fitting correctly. However, I went to the tailors and they made some corrections to the length. I then rolled up the sleeves (it actually looked prettier like that!) and used some safety pins to get the dress situated above my waist. It looked gorgeous! The bows kept getting floppy though; oh well."
4.0,"It is a beautiful stone, but unfortunately I can not wear it because the post is just a bit too long and, for some reason, it comes out very easily. Would love to wear it because it's so pretty!"
4.0,I stand a lot and have pain in my heels as a result. These shoes provide relief with a soft squishy sole. I could use a bit more arch support but overall I am happy with this shoe.
4.0,"They fit perfectly except for the straps. Definitely made for someone taller I think. If I pulled it down to fit my shoulders, my bra would show on my sides. Also, the material is pretty thin so a nude bra is a must."
4.0,Love it! It made me look like I have a butt and a smaller waste!
4.0,Love the dress a bit to big. Bust 36c waist 32 would have love if it was fitted.
4.0,"very good quality, however even though I measured my laptop it is a very tight fit and zipping it up is hard."
4.0,I could have ordered a size smaller but it is very nice on. :)
4.0,"Like the style, just a bit snug, the size I order usually always fits nicely."
4.0,Love the dress just mad it tore a little putting it on and the lining underneath is shorter than the actual dress so it looks funny when it rises lol
4.0,"I like this RFID protected women's clutch wallet. It seems to be made very well with straight seams and hardware that works.<br /><br />Closed I measured it as 7 3/8&#34; long x 3 3/4&#34; wide x 1&#34; at its thickest point.<br /><br />It has 10 credit card slots (4 of them are in the side of one of the cash slots). It also has an ID slot that is covered with see-through plastic. There are 4 long slots that you can put cash, receipts, notes or whatever in. If your phone is slim enough, it'll probably fit in one of the slots.  Then there is a zippered compartment in the center of the wallet that will hold a small amount of change or a flash drive or a spare key.<br /><br />The Amazon page says this is made of leather but it doesn't say what kind of leather. It has an attractive pebbled finish. There is a very strong odor to the wallet, even after it's been out of its box for a while.  I don't know whether it's the leather or a preservative for the leather or some other chemical but it's enough to give me a headache.<br /><br />The wallet closes with a strong snap on the front.<br /><br />It comes packaged in a black velvet &#34;envelope&#34; that then goes into an attractive black presentation box with Dante written in silver on the front.<br /><br />I received this wallet in exchange for my honest review. I really like it - except for the strong odor."
4.0,"So cute, bright, vibrant. i am happy with them, the ONLY complaint i have is they aren't like most open toed shoes..it's like the toe strap area is not positioned right or something. a lot of toe shows. usually just three toes or so show through in shoes like these (and not the whole toe eaither) but these almost show my pinky toes even, and almost the whole toes. Still cute, just not used to that aspect of it. However, i don't let that stop me from wearing them, they are a fun accent piece."
4.0,"perfect for shower, pool. good fit"
4.0,fits well ok quality
4.0,"The dress was very pretty and well made. I didn't end up needing the dress, and customer service was helpful and prompt."
4.0,It’s good material. I like it
4.0,Product was too big for the size ordered but it was a very nice dress.
4.0,"still working on fitting, only used once so far, but I think it will help me to breathe better in the mask"
4.0,No me agrado el color tan subido de tono
4.0,Just received in mail. Fit is very good I ordered a 46 and usually fit into 10 street shoes. These have toe room and are not to wide.<br />Will try them on the stationary bike tomorrow.
4.0,Nice. Great buy and will keep it for any upcoming event. Unisex style.
4.0,"It's a beautiful dress. I love the color, fabric and texture of dress. It is smaller then expected, luckily only need for pictures."
4.0,Nice summer dress for the price
4.0,This is a handsome heavy watch.  The bezel does not turn.  The watch band has pins.  The pins have slots as though they are screws but they are not.  They are pins.  Overall an apparently good value.
4.0,Haven't wore it to work yet but great for at home so far.
4.0,"I was shocked when this arrived a couple days after I ordered it --- it came from Ireland!  I guess I didn't realize when I ordered it,  or I probably would have chosen another vendor --- but not to worry,  it was speedy just like all my prime purchases.  It was a gift for my father,  it is a little scratchy for him around the neck,  so he wears it with collar shirts primarily.  Beautiful sweater for the price.  Nice that it has pockets."
4.0,"Purchased two robes about 9 months ago, we have been using them at saunas and pools. Quality is very good, they finally starting to show signs of wear / tear (strings coming off). The thickness is nice and the hood is excellent, especially for the out door saunas in Europe."
4.0,Nice and will work for the top I have ordered it for.
4.0,Nice suit.  Had to replace because the fabric does not hold up. But the suit fits good.
4.0,I wish the length was a few inches longer
4.0,"Necklace is  smaller in person & the pink is very, very pale.  Am a little disappointed, but all in all, I do like it!"
4.0,So cute for my fencing son.
4.0,I have a large head and this hat fit! I wish it came in additional colors.
4.0,Arrived on time and looks just like the pic
4.0,"Love this dress!  It is super cute for summer outings.  One thing that should be noted is the button closure at chest.  It is fairly revealing, and it’s not something you can really wear another tank top under..  I have several of this dress in various patterns, and I have sewn up the button area to close fully and be less revealing in chest area.  Otherwise, a good buy.  Material is silky and flowy, and perfect for summer weather.  I got so many compliments too."
4.0,"Cute glasses, very big but nice looking, fashionable! They come without a case, just in a tiny plastic bag. My were a little discolored but for the price you pay its ok."
4.0,These are well made mask. I’ve washed mine many times and they hold up well.  The reason I only gave it a four was because they are a little small. So get one size larger than you usually wear.
4.0,Very sexy and great fit. The only downside is the string down the back tales away from the heart shape.
4.0,Alright super small but cute
4.0,Looks expensive enough I actually Cary it on my Stella McCarthy bag
4.0,"Hands stay warm, but can be difficult using touch screen"
4.0,"I am pleased with this dress. I love the color, the fit is very nice. I'm sure I will get a lot of wear out of it. Thank you."
4.0,"I am in total agreement with all of the posted reveiws.I ordered 1 size up (2xl) and the shirt fits great and is an awesome design but it is definitely off on the color and definitely a lightweight t-shirt.I personally think this shirt is the coolest design of all on pepsistuff,,but you know..."
4.0,"Beautiful face to the watch. I can see replacing the pleather strap at some point, but for now it looks good. I've read from other reviews of this brand that the strap eventually starts to break, but we've not encountered that. The only complaint is that the watch does require constant winding. It's still a beautiful timepiece and a great value. My boyfriend loved it for our early Valentine's Day."
4.0,"This is my 4th purchase of this dress just as lovely as the others. However, sadly I’m sending this one back the pattern and the color are more pastel then show in the picture- not a fine of this one. Great dress love this companies product. Great customer service, I had to exchange once trying to find my true size, but I’m a 5x, I like a smoother finish, with this fabric and length it just looks better. Love the maxi look!!"
4.0,"It is quite feminine and soft looking and I like it fine, with a very affordable price."
4.0,I really like this purse. I thought it was going to be bigger though.
4.0,Looks n feel very classy
4.0,"I loved the shirt, material and color. I was a bit dissapointed that it ran a touch small. I gave it to my daughter who loved it!<br />Get a size larger and you will love it!"
4.0,It's okay it just gets untied easily but other than that it's okay
4.0,The arm's lace are long
4.0,"Love the swim suit. Im a 40 DD and thick on my back side as well. It was a little tight around the arms and at times but not often, the bottom of the top would rise showing a little under boob. I still love the suit and got a alot of compliments on it. Quality was great as well. The zipper didn't come loose at all and everything stayed intact."
4.0,Looks just like online. Tribal inspired and all. Can't wait to wear it with a turtleneck. The ropes are black and blue so you will have your choice. I just wished the stones were smaller. Would add a richness to it. Can't wait to wear it with jeans tomorrow!
4.0,"I ordered 2 bras 1 red and 1 silver. The silver had fit but the red was too large. The seller exhibited awesome customer service by sending me another red bra that was a size smaller without having to charge me or having to send back the other bra. After wearing both bras for some time, I can confidently say they are of good quality, not flimsy, awesome color. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase."
4.0,"I got this shirt oversized for sleeping, and it fits great. It's comfortable, washes well, and the design is as shown in the listing."
4.0,Ear adjustable tabs hurt
4.0,Soft simple and pretty
4.0,"This is a really cute, comfy tunic dress. It fits well, is soft, and has a nice, vibrant color. It also lays nicely, and the sleeves are a comfortable tightness -- loose enough to push up a bit if needed, but tight enough to stay put.<br /><br />The pocket is what knocks a star off. I thought it would be cute, and I will say that it does give the tunic a casual feel. I have quite a few tunics that are easy to dress up, so I was happy to have a more casual looking one. But, having put it on, I'm not sure the pocket really is the best option.<br /><br />Overall, though, it's a cute tunic dress."
4.0,"I like the design. It matches the picture. However, thefabric is a little bit thin."
4.0,"When I opened these leggings, I saw that they all had an L sticker on them. I thought I had chosen XL, but I tried them on anyway. They fit good enough and are only sliiiiiiiightly tighter around my upper thighs. I checked my order to find that the size I chose was meant to fit L-XXL but I don't see how an XXL person could fit into those comfortably. I'm going on a trip to NYC this weekend and wanted warm leggings since I tend to break out in cold weather. They are very comfortable, soft, and warm but I wish I could have chosen a more specific size in the end."
4.0,"Good size, feels very sturdy, lots of space for everything I need."
4.0,"It is very nice but a bit short though, this is an extra large band that should be for big hands..... Also the buckle is a bit loose, but to be fare, all in all it looks very nice!!"
4.0,"Comfortable and fit their purpose, a little smaller than I expected."
4.0,I’m typically a size us xs but I sized up to a size m because this dress is straight from China. The bust area is very small but if you wear a bra that matches the color of the dress it will be ok. I also had to cut 7 inches from the bottom to be able to walk around in this dress. It’s not a prefect dress but it is the only one in this trendy style that is readily available online and quite affordable.
4.0,"Very nice ring , ordered a size 8 , but runs a little small order 1 size larger"
4.0,"Really flattering cut and print. The dress ended up being a bit big I'm places although I followed the sizing guide, but I will just have it altered because it is very comfortable and flattering, plus you can't beat the price!"
4.0,"These worked great for a strapless dress I had. I am a 40 DDD and these gave me a nice lift and look for being as well endowed as I am.  I was wearing a tighter dress and it looked and felt good. I tried them the next day with a lose dress and it was hot so I had some struggle with them slipping down. I don't think it was super noticable but the boob sweat was real. So for a cute date night, strapless number do it, for a concert or somewhere super hot I personally feel more comfortable in a bra."
4.0,"It is pretty nice for the price. I noticed a sewing error which was easily fixed in a minute with my hands, no sewing machine. Definitely worth keeping."
4.0,Worn it to a graduation.love it
4.0,looks okay but band doesn't have enough holes to make it easier to fit someone without a large wrist circumference
4.0,"Great costume for the price! I originally wanted to DIY or put the costume together with individual pieces but it seemed pretty difficult. The bodysuit is very accurate to the WandaVision show but doesn’t do anything for the figure. It’s VERY thin and stretchy, so I’ll have to wear shape wear under for a more comfortable fit. The boot covers are 0/5. They’re so tight even on my chicken legs. Gloves, head piece and cape are great! Like any other costume piece you can find.<br /><br />Fit is like the chart says, and definitely large for the letter sizes they are representing. Size down 1-2 if you’re able to. I’m 5’4” and about 120lbs and an XS fit me, just very lose in the tummy (because of the fabric type)."
4.0,"I found these when my kids were little.  They are worth it.  The juice box fits inside and allows the kid to drink without squirting himself and everything around him.  There is a little area where the straw can be clipped into until ready to use....I would load the holders with juice boxes before heading out.<br />They are made of durable plastic that is easy to wipe clean.  I have put mine on the top rack of my dishwasher without problems; only the imprinting has faded.  They snap closed easily and stay closed.<br />Everytime we used one in public, people would BEG to know where we got our juice box holders."
4.0,"I really love this phone case. It is great looking and has multiple slots for IDs, credit cards, etc. I have been using it for several months now and the only reason it is not 5 stars is the leather is starting to crack at the crease where it folds on the top and bottom of the case. I am also pretty hard on it and wrap it around 180 degrees (instead of just open) so that might be adding to the wear of it. Overall, extremely happy with the product for the price."
4.0,"I'm not sure I'm a huge fan of the fabric that was used. It's not loose like I thought it was going to be but it's not exactly tight. It just sort of hangs there. I can still see my tum a little. I love pineapples and this is perfect. It will be nice in the summer. If I can get over my lil belly hanging all out. lol.<br /><br />The fabric is different than I'm used to. The color is beautiful. It's comfortable to wear. I like this well enough but if I had seen it in the store first, I may have passed it up for something different."
4.0,loved them they fall off easily though but i used a dab on lash glue and it’s good to go
4.0,"This is a cute and trendy sweater that is very versatile, can go with so many things. Fits true to size and has a good feel to it."
4.0,They are cute and served its purpose. Lucky for me I have small feet (Women’s 6.5) so they fit as pictured. Don’t think they would work for people with bigger feet because the socks are so tiny and doesn’t stretch a whole lot.
4.0,"I jusr received this today and I must say I really like it.<br /><br />First of all, delivery was very fast. over a week before the scheduled delivery date here on Amazon.<br /><br />I like the design and the red is soo pretty. I do however wosh tgat the red enamel would've been a little neater but its not conpletely horrible. Its a decent looking jewel perfect for what I paid."
4.0,This outfit was extremely cute! I did feel like the material was a little cheap feeling and maybe a bit see through but it turns out great for photos!
4.0,"I like the bag, but is too small, I really need one just a bit larger."
4.0,Fitted sweatshirt. Buy a size bigger
4.0,"I was very impressed with the quality of this skirt. It is a tiny bit on the long side, but overall the fit of the skirt is true to size."
4.0,"Very comfortable, nice thick fabric, but I only bought it because I needed an orange dress, very long though"
4.0,"I bought 2 skirts,red and purple in XL. I am 5'7&#34;,225pounds. Even they are same size and style they fit totally different. Red skirt fit perfect. Love everything about this outfit, length, pattern, comfortable, not tight in the waist. Purple was not upto my expectations and very tight in the waist, so it's going back.Quality is average, but for $20 the red skirt is a great deal."
4.0,Good value for money nicely made
4.0,"I really like how this jacket fits and looks.  The fabric is so soft and thick.  The only thing I dislike about this coat is the pockets.  They are so flimsy.  So what I did, is completely sew them shut. then added a hidden pocket on the inside.  Reading the reviews, it seems that everyone else feels the same about the flimsy pockets.  I hope this company will make the pockets bigger and a thicker material.  It seems weird that the jacket is made so well, then they add those cheap pockets."
4.0,Nice belt for the price I paid.  Very fast delivery!
4.0,I constantly get compliments when I wear this skit out. It creates a flattering silhouette and was affordable.
4.0,"The skirt is so beautiful! Lovely black lace over a solid black lining.  However, it runs a bit small.  My daughter-in-law is super thin and it is a bit snug on her. If you buy, you may want to go up a size. But it's so pretty that she was happy to be a tad bit uncomfortable to wear it on date night."
4.0,Ordered to have while my real LV band is coming. When I opened it I was completely disappointed. The GG is VERY light u can’t barely see it. And the animals on it cover them half the time. But then when I went on to write my review I realized it was $20. For $20 it’s fine. Just know before you buy it’s not at all bright like pics but it’s at least material and not the dumb plastic kind that makes u sweat so much.
4.0,"Color advertised as BLUE, but definitely purple. Fit was as expected. Extremely comfortable, lightweight and stretchy."
4.0,"I love this dress. I love the length and fit, very nautical and summery."
4.0,It's not my type
4.0,As directed
4.0,"Too excited for this! Love smiley, but something that could be made from home. Reminds me of a shirt sleeve. That stretches well. Quality is ok for (sale) price."
4.0,"Higher quality than most.  I don't know why they make a point of putting &#34;Womens&#34; everywhere.  I'm a man, and I like it."
4.0,"Let me start this by saying I'm a 6'0"" tall, size 18, busty female. With that all said, this costume fits tight in the 20-22, but it will work. My boyfriend says it's supposed to be tight in the chest, but it is the type of tight where the button comes undone (wear a camisole underneath!). It fits my hips and waist great - true to a size 18, as most costumes run one-to-two sizes small. The material is sheer and thin, so make sure to wear something underneath. As for the length, it is SHORT on me, very very short. I bought cheerleader shorts in anticipation of it being this short, so it works well. Just make sure you're comfortable showing off your bust and lots of leg, and you'll be good! The belt itself is cheap, but what are you going to do for a Halloween costume. It is large enough (as in, they didn't just put the belt from the small size in the bag) and looks good with the costume. I just hope this will stay somewhat buttoned through the night of my party since it isn't as secure as one would like. Maybe if I lose a few pounds before Halloween, I'll be okay...2 weeks, only bread and water?! Yeah, right."
4.0,"I really like this dress, like the design.<br />So having this dress now for a while, I finally wore it to a  party,  It fits well and I got a lot of positive reviews 😍, couple people ask if they could have it."
4.0,"Great Value!<br />For those that hate swim suit shopping...I am one of you.  I am a little self-conscious and this swimsuit is so flattering, that I bought it in a second color!!  The back is actually a modest (when compared to contemporary bikinis) bottom.  Not granny coverage, but a nice compromise that flares out a bit at the sides.<br /><br />While it seems like it might be a little revealing on the bottom, it actually frames a woman's shape nicely.  For those that are smaller, I am a 36 A and the medium size gave me a nice shape (the cups are well formed).  A larger bust would also look fantastic in this, since it gives extra support with the black straps."
4.0,For a Tea Party
4.0,"Pros: lovely bright red (orange base) color, the knit is really lovely, the slight rouching, on the sleeves is a nice touch. I’m 5’2, 125 and ordered small. It fit great, slouchy, perfect for throwing over tanks and tees.<br />Cons: the yarn itself is a synthetic and feels like that. It’s also not very warm. If you’re petite the looseness of the cut can also feel a bit boxy."
4.0,"This is a very attractive and protective eyeglasses case. It's too bad it only comes in purple. It's a little large, but I managed to get it in my purse. It was nice to have the eyeglass cleaning cloth along with it."
4.0,"Nice pants. The material feels great. They seem to be well made. But they run a bit smaller than I expected and the way they are cut is not flattering if you are curvy. They accentuate any pooch belly you might have, and make it look worse than it needs to. Disappointing, because otherwise I love them."
4.0,"They look really  good and are great  in size for me. I'm  not sure, however, about  the quality  and it's  not that i already tried them on, it's  just not enough  time for this. They feel a little on the weak size, but  I think that if properly  worn and looked after,  they make an excellent  pair that is inexpensive and yet good looking"
4.0,"Great novelty, fair quality"
4.0,"Beautiful dress. I got scared and ordered a large, even though I wear a medium. Its true to size. I should've gotten a medium. Stretchy material. Print looks just as pictured. Cant wait to wear."
4.0,"It fits good , but the shirt is small if you have large breast. A fun outfit great for ankle boots with heels or sneakers because the legs are long but gathered. I say yes to the sweats!!!"
4.0,its great but it's quite long on me and i'm 5' 7 &#34;. i wear a nude slip underneath as its quite open
4.0,"Looks good on. The dress has some stretch which is helpful for individual types. there is a small trim piece on the outside of the dress over the seams at the hips area that does not show up well in the pictures, and this does not stretch as well as the rest of the dress so there is some pulling here. I am usually a Large-Xl body type, and the XL is snug. the stretch helps, but if there was no stretch, this would not fit. It is long. I'm 5'7'' and wearing heals it still probably touches the floor all the way around."
4.0,I use these as a bib on my Great Dane to catch his drool.  They work great and look good too.
4.0,Grate price fitts good I am 205 pd 5'11 made for me A3
4.0,"Just in case the listing isn’t clear enough, you get 10 unique pieces— not a set of 10 pairs. These are marketed for men, thus not sold in pairs, and I’m good with that since I prefer to wear my jewelry all mismatched.  Most of these 10 are about the same length; some variety would have been nice. They have a decent heft, actually a bit too much for me as I prefer my earrings to be as lightweight as possible. These pinch me a little bit too. And feel a little cumbersome (and noisy, too much jangling for me). But I have 7 ear piercings so can experiment to see what’s most comfy in which spot.<br /><br />I knew good and well when I ordered these that I’ve never been a fan of this style of fastener. But I thought I’d give them another chance. Nope, still not a fan. If the curved post part doesn’t perfectly align into the hollow piece, then there’s way too much fiddling involved to get them closed (and remained truly clasped). It’s doubly hard if you have long fingernails like I do. With as many ear piercings as I have—the novelty of this has long worn off—I don’t like to waste so much time with the process. Your mileage and your patience may vary… but the build quality on these, while decent, isn’t so stellar that the fasteners on all 10 are perfect. Some attach very tightly, some are a bit loose, etc. To remove them, you must grab the whole ring and pull it apart.<br /><br />We’ll have to take the manufacturer’s word for it that these are stainless. I have reactions to sterling silver, rather than cheapo metals, so while I don’t anticipate a problem here, neither the product description nor the bag they arrive in makes mention of WHICH kind of stainless this is. And as there is more than one kind of stainless, it would make me feel more confident if they offered the exact type. Quality body jewelry includes this info. At this price point no one is probably going to care, but just saying. Some reviewers have hyped these in a way that rather confuses me.<br /><br />For sheer quantity vs price point, I can recommend these if you don’t mind the jangly factor (which I admit I’m extra sensitive to), slight heaviness and the somewhat fiddly clasps."
4.0,They said the size was 2x no way that was large but the item was very nice just could not fit
4.0,Very nice necklace! Shopping came on time as well. Only thing I’d say is that the end of the chain is heavier than the pendant itself so it’s kind of annoying having to show just the pendant while wearing it.
4.0,Service & delivery was good. Even he small size fits large. It's like everyone is over weight and in poor shape. Too bad!
4.0,Nice watch for its price.
4.0,"Fabric is nice, not too heavy. My pockets kept popping out but it's fine"
4.0,"Absolutely love the function of this watch! The alarms work great and has been helping to discreetly provide reminders to my son, just as advertised. But after only 3 weeks the band has broken and we will need to find somewhere to get a replacement band. So what started off as already an expensive children’s watch is costing me even more. Pretty disappointed! Would call customer service if I could find the box with the instructions. Anyone able to provide those?"
4.0,"This isn’t a sweater like I expected, it’s a thinner fabric that would work great for layering. I’d size down one because although I’m traditionally an XL this was a little baggy on my arms and too long on my arms. A large would have fit perfect."
4.0,"I bought the pink color in a size small and I'm 5'4' and it fits loose which is what I like. I love the way it fits, but I can't get the creases out of it, because of the way it was folded and shipped. I've only worn it once and got a lot of compliments. I haven't washed it yet, so hopefully the creases will come out."
4.0,"I got this watch to replace a Timex Sports Watch.  I have been through two Timex watches that claimed to be water ""resistant"" to 100 m, but both crapped out swimming on the surface of a pool.  So far, the Casio remains water tight.  The radio controlled time reset function didn't work at first, but after about three days it started working and has worked ever since.  My only complaint is the stiffness of the buttons.  It is especially frustrating with the stopwatch function as I actually use it.  Because the buttons are recessed, I have to use a pen to press the buttons and their stiffness compromises the accuracy of what I'm timing."
4.0,These leggings run one size smaller than normal Junior leggings. But they are super comfy and I love the style!
4.0,Since I let my hair grow out I needed something to keep my CPAP mask headgear from sliding around at night.  This is large enough to pull over my head and keep the headgear in place all night.
4.0,"These are nice quality and very adjustable. Fit my 20 month old very well for attending a race. He seamed very comfortable in them. Just right fit of the ear cups over his ears. Band is large enough to fit me, but cups are a bit too small for adult ears. Good sound attenuation."
4.0,Thin material and is actually a tank top that you have to tie into a knot.
4.0,"I originally ordered this jacket in a Ladies Medium (they are out of the petite sizes).  Way too big.  So I reordered it in a small.  Fit was better, although a bit snug with a heavy sweater/sweatshirt.  But the length is just too long for my small 5'3"" frame.  It feels restrictive and is difficult to sit in.  But the coat is beautiful, warm, and well made.  Love that the lining zips out and is in a beautiful contrasting color."
4.0,"it runs one size big and it's very cute for the price. I am giving it to my daughter and ordered again, one size smaller for myself. can't wait ;)"
4.0,Good on her
4.0,"This is the third time I have purchased this shoe, which is unusual for me.  It is comfortable and supportive at the same time.  It resists water and is very non slick when walking or hiking.  It is difficult to find a good and comfortable hiking shoe but this is the one for me.  I highly recommend."
4.0,"These were nice spiral earrings, although they were much smaller than expected! I thought that they would hang below the ear a little but they are more like long studs.  I really liked them though and did receive a few compliments on them!"
4.0,"I bought this bag because I own the HotStyle 12-L Bestie bag and love it.  I got this one so I'd have a smaller work-bag I could leave in my locker at my second job and avoid shuffling everything to and fro.  This 8-liter bag is excellent for that purpose.  It easily fits my Tab S7 & definitely also work for the S7+.  In fact, if the bag was just an inch taller, it'd fit my 13"" chromebook.<br /><br />The side pockets will fit standard 16- or 20-oz soda/water bottles but nothing larger.  I've got a small umbrella tucked in one and a bottle in the other.<br /><br />My only quibble is that I thought the material would be the same as the 12-liter bag and it isn't.  This one is a heavy canvas material.  It's fine, but I liked the other material because I could easily wipe it down with sani-wipes and that's important since I use it in the hospital.  Additionally, as an FYI, the larger bag had a very slight orange tint that left the bag ""sunny"".  This one is a straight-yellow - closer to the color of a Wet Floor sign.  It's also fine, but not as pretty to my eye."
4.0,I bought this as a gift. He loves it. The fabric has just the right amount of manly-softness and isn't tight under the arms. The print has also stood up to multiple washes.
4.0,"Really nice platform shoes, excelent I love them. Easy to walk with thanks to the large platform."
4.0,"It's not high quality material, but good as expected for this cost.  The color is rich and after a couple of washings so far it has not faded.  Very satisfied with this purchase."
4.0,Cute colors soft nice quality
4.0,Works as it’s supposed to. I bought these for my super skinny daughter’s pants that don’t have an adjustable waist. The only issue I’ve encountered is putting the belts through 18 month pant loops as the loops are smaller than the belt in some parts. I also had to air these out for a week before allowing them near my daughter. They still have a smell but it’s more tolerable now. I’m just thankful that they will grow with my child.
4.0,Neck is made more for an adult
4.0,A nice 2 piece set. If youre between a small and a medium the medium bottoms will give you a bit more room.
4.0,"A few loose threads that I snipped off at arrival, but otherwise really nice for the price. No color bleeding or fading so far, no shrinking, and no pilling. I have received a lot of compliments on this shirt and people are always surprised that it is an Amazon purchase."
4.0,"It’s comfortable and casual but the open shoulders add a little style to it. Not the biggest fan of the material, but overall it’s a nice top."
4.0,Liked it. Just appeared larger in the picture
4.0,I bought these for my niece. She loves them and wears them everywhere and they’re adorable. I only gave 4 stars because they scuffed so easily from her first wearing of them. Both toes of the boots have scuff marks. Perhaps they could be polished? I’m not sure. But she does get compliments about them a lot.
4.0,Wish it was a little longer but otherwise love it!
4.0,"I've been needing to upgrade my tanks because my closet mainly consists of them from Old Navy. These are a great fit! I ordered true to size, and I'm happy for the most part. They are a little longer than I'd like, but they cover the bum and provide good coverage. High quality material. You can't beat a four-pack for this price. I recommend!"
4.0,"I was looking for a black swimsuit that was just a little sexy while still being appropriate to wear to the family pool. This fits the bill perfectly!<br />For reference I am 5’2”, 130 lbs, 34DD and the medium fits nicely although there is a little spillage in the top."
4.0,love these ear rings. i thought they would have more weight to them when i put them on. but they where so comfy and light weight. makes it so much more easier. i by far love these.
4.0,They are definitely comfy but they did run a bit bigger. I am not sure if that’s what it wasn’t as flattering. I would still recommend for comfort because of how soft they were! I am also usually a large/XL which is what I ordered. I am 5’2 and weigh 170lbs
4.0,Face mask wontbstay on at all. Instantly lost. Cute tho
4.0,"Runs small, so it ended up being a tight fit. It’s really wrinkle prone, but the design is nice and I got a lot of compliments on it. Only the two pockets but a good buy for the price."
4.0,The product fit well. I’m 5ft 9 and roughly 214lb. It was long enough to go below my ankles. I gave it a 4 star because it is slightly see through on the skirt part and the main part I liked was the tied belt and the material for the belt is a lot thinner than in the pic.
4.0,Looks good and has held up over the past few months. I also have it in pink for my daughter and she likes hers too.
4.0,I wanted this one because it wasn't too big and it seems to be a pretty nice size and I love the over the shoulder strap.
4.0,"I wear a size 9, and these fit perfectly. Very pretty, very sparkly sandal. Looks to be sturdy.  The strap between the toes does hurt your toes, but  hey! We're girls. We have to bear a little pain to be beautiful, don't we?.  :)"
4.0,I was having issues with shin splints but needed to keep training for a long distance charity walk in 100 days.  Used these on a long training walk the day after I got them and the results were great.  My legs were not as tired and no pain.
4.0,Based on the side chart I ordered a size larger than normal. It came way too big. The colors are really pretty though and it’s easy enough to take in at the sides.
4.0,I really love this I just wish I could make it the size I need. This will be great for if I need to go out and look a bit more classy than my plain black rubber band but it unfortunately doesn't fit right. It's either too tight and I have to wear it in the wrong spot or it's too loose and the watch moves all around. I'm sure this will fit some perfectly though and I would highly recommend it!
4.0,Would prefer a mirror lense but really a great buy!
4.0,"Fits really well,material is ok."
4.0,"There were a little small, but I loved them so much I'll order another pair, just 2 sizes bigger this time."
4.0,"I got this set for my four year old daughter.  She normally wears size 5T or sometimes the next size up.  She is tall and very slim.  I believe I ordered this gown in the 5-6T size.  It's just a little big on her but that's what I wanted so that she can grow into it and have more time to enjoy it.<br /><br />The gown itself seems to be well made.  Everything is symmetrical & there are no missing parts or snags.  I've washed it twice, so far, on gentle and hung it up to dry.  So far, so good.<br /><br />The jewelry is very cute but also obviously very cheap.  There is a tiara that you must assemble.  It comes in two pieces.  Ours seems to stay together but we have one from another play set that is popping apart every 5 minutes (really annoying).  It's probably just the luck of the draw.  The other jewelry is make up of plastic, pearlescent beads and seashells.  The necklace also has two bells on it.  One bell is white and ithe other is red, which I think is odd since nothing else in the set is red.  You get a necklace, a bracelet, a finger ring, and a set of earrings.  Lastly, there is a scepter/wand that's actually pretty sturdy compared to others we've had in the past.<br /><br />Overall, this set is great.  My daughter seems to really enjoy it & has worn it everyday for the last few days.  It looks super cute on her.  It's very detailed for such an inexpensive set.<br /><br />Sorry for the lack of pictures.  This is my second attempt at a review on this product.  Amazon rejected my first review for some unexplained reason.  I would love to include a photo but since I did so in my first review, I can only guess that something in the photo was somehow inappropriate, although I can't image what.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for reading.  My apologies for the rant."
4.0,"I read that the sizes would be a little small but, as a kimono, I still expected it to be loose. The largest size is loose and fits me (size 18-20) well as a cover up. I especially like this fabric pattern. Wish it was slightly larger but only to perhaps wrap one side around to the other (like a robe)."
4.0,Soft material flattering
4.0,"Very comfortable, my only complaint would be that the decal faded pretty badly after a single washing."
4.0,Very comfortable and soft.  Enjoying the shirt
4.0,Nice weight fabric. However striped are printed on.
4.0,Love this dress but it was to small. I might have to wear something under it like a minimizer. Order a size up.
4.0,Darker than pictured.
4.0,"The bracelet itself was a great quality. However, because there are no micro adjustments it unfortunately it was either too tight or too loose for my wrist. Nothing wrong with the bracelet just didn't fit me. Had to return it."
4.0,"I liked the weight and the size. It's not 50L, more like 40, but that's what I was looking for. I wish it had a hip belt, not to carry weight as you can't put much weight in tbis (20 lbs I'd say), but for stability."
4.0,Attractive hat and very warm!  It is about an inch too big.
4.0,The dress is very nice but fits to large
4.0,"The product is not bad at all, what I did not like about it was the style of the shirt. It has that middle school gym short type material with holes in it and the picture makes it look like a dri-fit smooth type material. They are pretty good quality"
4.0,Its a little small but beautiful
4.0,"The waist​ is a little large, but overall very comfortable!"
4.0,"I love it! Colors are just as pictured,very good quality. It did have a strong odor,may have been from being packaged up,and leather? It has gone now,so that's good. My only wish is that straps were a little longer to wear over shoulder without shoulder strap. I am using the shoulder strap and the handles get in the way.Also I prefer a outside pocket for easy access on certain things,maybe on the next one as I plan to order another."
4.0,These sleeves fit well with or without using the thumb hole.  I’ve tried other sleeves that don’t fit well or make my arms itch.  The only problem I have is that it’s shipped from overseas and took a awhile to get here.  Would buy again.
4.0,Sized a bit small but nice
4.0,"My head is 21.65”. The small was just a bit snug, but I decided for the cost it should fit perfect, so back it went.  The medium was way too big. Cute hat though."
4.0,Beautiful. Not quite the quality I was expecting. One piece fell out quickly. I love the look though. Wish they made a size down lower than 6.
4.0,"These masks are VERY thin. I’m surprised the string stays on them. I was hoping they would be a bit thicker, but for the price I can’t really complain too much."
4.0,"I love the look of this dress, been trying to tone up to look better in it. Only thing, I'm a bit smaller chested so the cut out around the arms is very slightly loose."
4.0,Loved the purple witch hat.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it's a bit small.  Okay for a teenager but looks a bit childish on a woman's head.  I wore it anyway but I wish it was just a tad bit bigger.
4.0,It's a sweatshirt...nice...not overly heavy...not cheap...good strong material.
4.0,"Looked great on my boyfriend.  He said it was very comfortable.  Rec'd many compliments.  PITA to iron when it arrived.  Haven't washed it yet so not sure how much it will wrinkle (that's why 4 stars).  But with that said, I would purchase again"
4.0,I loved this dress but I had to return it because it was a bit too long. I ordered and XL and it was a little too big too. Other than that I loved everything else about it. I might order a smaller size
4.0,Cute. Good quality and great price
4.0,Love this neclace...I always like Honolulu jewelry
4.0,I really like this hat. I’m not 100% sold that it’s vintage stock but it’s a sick “vintage style” hat for sure. I work at big mountain in Montana and my fellow Colleagues are jealous for sure.
4.0,A little big around my neck but still looks very nice I've gotten several compliments on this beautiful necklace
4.0,"Fits my head weird, not comfortable"
4.0,"I was very excited when I purchased this suit. I haven't worn a true bikini in years after having two kids and typical mommy problem areas. This suit seemed like the perfect solution to hide my flabby tummy. I typically wear a size 6 and I ordered a size large. The suit fit very well. However, the reason I have it 4 starts instead of 5 is that there is no support in the top. I am a size 34D and felt like the bottom of my breast was going to fall out of the suit. If the top had more support, I would definitely give the suit 5 stars. I bought the red polka dot pattern and it is fun and timeless pattern that will not go out of style. I probably won't wear this suit very often this summer because I would be too self conscious that the suit would leave me in an indecent exposure. However, if it is just me and the family at home I will probably wear it.<br /><br />I received this product discounted in exchange for my unbiased review....All opinions are my own"
4.0,"This is definitely a cold weather suite of ""thick"" well woven apparel. I've worn the hat and gloves for the last three mornings for my morning walks and felt absolutely warm and comfortable. I was extremely impressed with my ability to type on my cellphone while wearing the gloves. Likewise, the neck scarf is comfortable-not too tight, but soft and protective. I can't wait to put it to the ultimate test on the slope this weekend at Lake Tahoe."
4.0,A little difficult breathing (good thing for the purpose) but otherwise excellent look and feel for the school boy.
4.0,Fit good but the cuffs around the bottom of the legs are very tight. So tight that she had to alter it. And she is 5ft 8 125....tall and thin with long thin legs. Someone with bigger or thicker legs will have an issue.
4.0,I was a little scared to get this with the reviews that I read. But I actually like it. It's not the most expensive jewelry I have but it is not the cheapest either. I like the length and how it falls. Not sure how it will hold up with long term wear but for right now it looks nice when I wear it.<br />[[ASIN:B00SH9BD0W Pooqdo(TM) New Women Bang Bang Multilayer Pendant Chain Statement Necklace (Silver)]]
4.0,I get these for my cats.  They love to play with them and carry them around the house.
4.0,"I had to have them tailored after buying them, but that's just because I have very small wrists. Worth the price and work well for covering my tattoos at work!"
4.0,"They are light weight and the lenses seem nice.<br /><br />Included case is great!<br /><br />The frames feel a  bit cheap and flimsy, not sure how well they will hold up.<br />But hey, not bad bad for the price!"
4.0,"I love that these have pockets! I bought a medium, which is just a little snug on my thighs, I might have been able to get away with buying a large, but hopefully wearing them will help them stretch out a little and relax on my thighs. Overall I love them!"
4.0,For $10 its pretty good. Scared our kids just fine 🤣
4.0,"Fits super cute, only problem is it gapes a little at the v neck and shows some bra. Could be because I’m 34B and I just need a little more on top"
4.0,"This is a very cute, lightweight dress. For me, the neckline is a bit too low, but I feel the cross-hatching lines mask my cleavage just enough. I dont find the dress short, but I'm not quite 5'3&#34;, so keep that in mind when deciding for your body. The dress did have a bit of a smell to it when it arrived, but it aired out completely in 24 hours. If they had a bigger variety of patterns I'd buy it again."
4.0,"These gloves are pretty good! They are warm and having my fingers free is great, especially when using a camera on trips or typing. They do slip down your arm as you wear them, but they are pretty good."
4.0,Love the pillow except the little holes in the back to let the air out.
4.0,My order got to me in 8 days and they even put an extra chain for the necklaces in the package! Super cute my boyfriend loves it (: definitely worth the money spent!
4.0,"As per the headline; fabric is rather thin (this can be a plus though! You can’t feel it’s on), and it’s tight waisted (but all Dani’s Choice are). If you order your regular size, your waist will be accentuated, and will look sexy, but don’t count on eating a big meal in this thing, lol. If you want to relax, order a size bigger."
4.0,nice leather quality but not very practical - you have to unzip each time you want access to the key - too bad the Lincoln symbol on the outside doesn't line up with the lock button on the fob ... then that would be helpful - otherwise i like it
4.0,"Cute, oversized frames with a little cheetah print in tortoise shell/pink! Great price and better quality than the cheap glasses you find at the stores by the beach.. They do a good job of keeping the sun out of my eyes and look cute too!"
4.0,"This dress fits well, is a great material and almost looks exactly like the picture! giving only 4 because I had to return it. I am a more athletic build and my arms were to snug."
4.0,Well made and seem to knock out all the harmful noise.  I just don't have anything to compare them to.
4.0,its ok.  I received this item at a discount for my honest review.
4.0,"I love how this watch looks and I get a ton of compliments on it, but the buttons on the side are placed in a way that they always get pushed and the mode changes when your wrists bend.  Great watch otherwise for the price!"
4.0,They are very nice. My 10 year old granddaughter likes them. One of the clasps came off so I will have to fix it. But over all they are nice. I got a second one in case she gets invited to a birthday party. Will make a nice gift too.
4.0,"I bought this for my mom, she loved it, said it's warm, fits perfect and wears it all the time, I would buy again, worth it."
4.0,Just to tight.
4.0,"Cute dress, but I think this style of dress doesn't look that great on DD+ gals ;P At least it didn't to me."
4.0,The product fit too large and didn’t keep anything supported.
4.0,"Bought as a gaiter for spring and fall weather. Slinky, breathable, well made, no raw edges. Tad tight but otherwise, comfy. If you want for winter? This is NOT the garment for you."
4.0,"This is a beautiful, beautiful scarf! However, be advised with fair warning, there is some differences in color from the actual product to the picture. There picture makes it seem all gauzy and two colors, the reality is a little difference. The main piece of the scarf is one color, a darker, blue and gray type shade of color. The fringe or border is silvery and navy and just a couple shades lighter than navy blue on the fringe. It's very pretty, and super soft on its own, but be advised it is different than the picture, unfortunately it may be the picture is lifted and the scarves are cheaper, but still nice imitations of the actual picture. It is not the gauzy, expensive looking product that you see above. However, no fear, I think it is a beautiful scarf, like I said before it is surprisingly very soft and supple, and it is packaged very well, they definitely take care of the product with the packaging it comes in! Another nice thing about this product is that in its packing, a lovely gift bag is included if you want to make this scarf the next birthday or Christmas present that comes from your heart. My bag was gold, with white and silver butterflies, very pretty, and not as cheesy looking as I probably made it sound. Another thing about this is that you get a free gift with your order! Mine was a draw string beaded bracelet which I've already been wearing out frequently. I would have paid just for the cute, free bracelet they included! Now for the one negative, the label is all in chinese, or japanese, an eastern language of sorts. You are on your own as to washing the product! Or if you or you have a friend that are able to read the label. However I think most of us are safe as we generally don't wash scarves at all, or very rarely.<br />*I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest feedback."
4.0,"the bracelet is beautiful, it's a bit sensitive though...It breaks easily...we broke it once, but Forzieri changed it for free...the customer service was good..."
4.0,looks like the pictures
4.0,Very well made. Im normally anywhere from a size 4-6 with an athletic build and I ordered a Medium. They were somewhat large on my waist so i returned them but im not bery curvy. But other than that I liked these shorts.
4.0,"This is one of my favorite bags from Kipling! I love the extra wide cushy guitar strap! It is very comfortable!  I purchased in pink, blue, black, and white! The pink and white bags come with a grey and white strap, and the black and blue bags came with a black and white strap. Hope Kipling brings this bag back in new colors with the guitar strap! Would love a back zipper pocket! Love the side pockets (big enough for an umbrella or water bottle)!"
4.0,I have been growing my bangs out for the last few months. I've been at the stage where they're not quite long enough to tuck behind my ear for a while. I've started wearing headbands when I'm on the treadmill so I don't have to keep messing with them. I was using the cheap stretchy ones but they would get sweaty very quickly. These have the wicking ability which keeps me feeling dry. They're also easy to wash! I am very happy with them.
4.0,Just too big. I’m 5’7 and weigh 160. I ordered a large.
4.0,These are nice but they are very small but perfect for my 3 year old granddaughter.
4.0,"If you can pull it off, wear it with the right outfit and rock it on a night out or at a brunch gathering. Its truly classic and not too much. I love it."
4.0,It's not what I expected.
4.0,"I purchased the ring as a gift it fit the person perfect, great quality, and excellent price, ive bought many rings from moking and I will continue to buy more."
4.0,Good quality. Placed on key rings for family and none have had issues with the quality so far.
4.0,"My bridesmaids loved their totes. Perfect size and fit their beach towels, water bottle and so much more. I used heat transfer Vinyl to personalize their names, and they all applied very well. (12 total)<br />I removed 1 star because the bags do shed. Some of my girls wore leggings on our flights back to the states and used their bags as a carry on and their black leggings were filled with shedding from the bags. But they still loved them"
4.0,It fit perfect but not for the heat
4.0,"Very nice looking with any outfit where the color worked, and easy enough to wash and drip dry on a plastic hanger. A classic style that shouldn't look dated in the years to come."
4.0,"I bought these cute baby shoes at a discounted price and as a gift for a friend and her new baby girl.  They are perfect for a new baby.  They are so soft and cute.  With the lace, sparkles, and pink bow...they are they perfect accessory for any outfit.  the bottoms are soft, so they move well with the movement of their feet.  I would definitely buy these again!"
4.0,"I love this bag, especually how long the strap is. It's a perfect size and is well-made.  However,  I had to take off one star because it smells so weird.  With time the smell has decreased but it's a little off putting."
4.0,"This pair of earrings is very unique in shape and hang perfectly.  They're gorgeous, I just wish they were a little bit wider, but that's just a personal preference.  They are shiny and quite eye catching!"
4.0,this is a handy collection of watchband springs. I put one in a watch for myself and it seems pretty sturdy..
4.0,"The fit was ok. I bought it a few sizes bigger to ensure it fit my hips. I did fit my hips, but it was too big in other areas. I do like the look. I will just need to do alterations for a perfect fit."
4.0,"Not bad at all for the price. Bags aren't big but I am single and live a lone, so their small size is fine with me.  Do like that I can put a couple in my purse, so I never realize that when I'm at the check-out, that I forgot my bags.  Big reason I chose these is that they said they are washable.  But, haven't washed any yet, to I don't know.<br /><br />WILL say that for the price, they are a bargain.  Used them for the past few days when I shopped for groceries, and I left with NO plastic bags, so I feel good about the fact that I am helping the environment"
4.0,"I bought these for my 2 y/o daughter and they are too cute. The only reason I didn’t rate it as perfect is because I expected the material to be suede-like, but it feels like a foam texture. Very warm and cute as well."
4.0,"This product was shipped quickly and was adequately described in the description. It arrived exactly as I anticipated. My daughter happens to have too small of a head for it to work effectively, but I would definately try to buy something from them again. It is not a toddler size cord which is what i need and cannot seem to find."
4.0,"I have a big head. I wear a 2XL motorcycle helmet. Other hats look ridiculously small on my melon. This hat is enormous.I have the adjustment band set as small as it will go and it's like I need someone to sew in a dart in the back to take up all the extra material. I love the brim. It's no longer than other hats, but is about 1&#34; wider, making it great at keeping the sun out of my sensitive green eyes."
4.0,"Arrived on time. Grandson did not like the way that they felt, preferred another brand that was given to him."
4.0,I like that its small for me to put my things in. I like it.
4.0,"This is a great sandal. My last pair lasted me many years before giving out. I ordered another pair. They fit as expected and the sole is comfortable. However, the strap on the right shoe is much tighter than the strap on the left on the pair I received. They still fit but this is slightly annoying. Would be an enthusiastic 5 stars if both feet had the same straps."
4.0,"The Kalon 4-Pack in black and grays - they are super soft and comfortable.  Based on reviews I ordered a medium - glad I did as a large would have been way too big. I almost returned these but I haven't been a small since high school.  The are the perfect length but the arm opening are a bit roomy.  I plan to wash and dry them and see what happens. If the issue remains, I can zip them up with my sewing machine!"
4.0,Difficult to put on initially
4.0,Its good quality to be store bought. Its flexible and easy to wear. The torso is a bit short and its a tight fit for a size four. (Yes I know its made to be tight). If you are a size 6 I recommend a size up. I've worn it and love it! Worth the cost.
4.0,My daughter loves these headbands.  Four stars because I wish they were a big wider.  She still has bangs and they just don't keep her bangs out of her face unless she has her hair in a pony tail which sort of defeats the purpose.
4.0,it is very nice and i love the color.  I look forward to ordering more of your products.
4.0,Love this blouse. Feels wonderful on and sexy!
4.0,Nice and thick material. But it didnt last that long. My son is in the swim team so he swims 5 days a week
4.0,I like the breathable material that the product is made of. Wish there were other colors or designs.
4.0,"I'm 5' and 107lb and this dress is definitely loose on me. I'm used to wearing loose clothes so I didn't really mind, mainly because I use it to go to the beach or very casual outings. Aside from that, its pretty cute and comfortable."
4.0,"The pattern/color I got is very cute. The shoe runs a little large. I'm a 8.5 and this fits more like a 9. Since I want to wear more in spring/summer I don't intend to wear a sock or a thick sock. If I were to order again for a sockless wear, I'd order an 8. Took a little bit to get used to the high arch support, but like it now. It doesn't address my heel pain issue necessarily, but still are pretty darn comfy."
4.0,I like my &#34;green&#34; pendant; its' to bring harmony within and heal.  I now wear it under my shirt because so many people would touch it.
4.0,"Perfect party favors, nice colors and the 1st graders loved them."
4.0,so far so good. let's see how well they hold up over time....
4.0,"I'm 5ft, 179 lbs D cup and the xl fits more like a medium to large. The bottoms don't look the best on me so I have some on from a different family suit listing I purchased here on Amazon. But the trunks fit my son and my bf. My son is wearing between 18 and 24 month clothing and I ordered the 2t. And my bf is about 5'4 190 lbs and I typically wears a large in mens. I ordered a large in mens. I will say that these trunks are lined inside (like brief style) but are traditional womens swimsuit material not swim trunk material."
4.0,4 stars bc it was a little lose around the bottom. Other than that I like it
4.0,I bought this for myself and a friend as a gift. It holds many phones (nothing larger than a Galaxy Blaze though) and a few cards and some money. Clear ID holder on the outside too.The shoulder strap is removable so you can wear this as a purse or clip it to your belt or larger purse. Plenty of styles to choose from.<br /><br />The manufacturer should consider making a large version too for e-readers.
4.0,Loved the pattern and material. But size didn't match what it said in description
4.0,Good caussual top.
4.0,Stuff clings to.
4.0,Love this bag. It's well made. But it is large. Much larger than I had anticipated it to be. The concealed carry pocket works nicely.
4.0,"The little doohickey that screws on to the end of the cable loosens itself eventually. You need to tighten it periodically. Otherwise, you will lose it and your keys all fall off.  That’s what happened to mine. Now the keychain is useless for want of that missing doohickey. Maybe a little drop of threadlock would keep it in place."
4.0,On first impression I was a bit unimpressed with this outfit. The material is really stiff and seems like it would be scratchy on. The fit on the other hand was great- it’s not too small or too big. I’m a little worried about washing it- hoping cold cycle and low heat won’t shrink it too badly or it would end up being too small. I’m also hoping that washing it might soften up the material a bit. This seems more like a pajama set than a going out set but that’s fine either way. My daughter loves it so that’s all that matters!
4.0,"Very pretty, and great colors. Just what I wanted."
4.0,It fit really well and looked just like the pictures. The only thing I didn't love was the material gets caught on things very easily and the dress became pully pretty quickly. Overall it was worth the money but I wouldn't wear this to an outdoor event or somewhere where it could get caught on things easily
4.0,I like this new 2021 floral pattern.. fit very nice & has pockets.
4.0,My kid wears it daily!
4.0,"This dress fits perfectly.  I'm 5'8"", about 130-135, bust size... well 32F. I bought a size medium. I would've given it a 5 stars it the material was less see through; it's a stretchy material. Otherwise, I love this dress."
4.0,"This dress is SUPER comfortable; I love the fabric. However, it is quite thin/clingy and unforgiving. For example, I’m wearing a thong in these pictures, and you can see (where I put a yellow mark) where it digs into my love handles (and you can see that I don’t really have serious love handles). Ideally, I’d wear my Spanx with this. But it’s so comfortable and such a perfect summer dress that I’ll prob just wear it and suck in/be self-conscious the whole time I’m wearing it lol.<br />ALSO- I am 5’1” and this is a PERFECT length on me! I thought this was a midi dress, but looking again I see it is actually labeled maxi. So it will definitely be short for others!<br /><br />I am 5’1” and 110lbs and I’m wearing the smallest size (I forget if it was S or XS)."
4.0,"They're beautiful, but a bit more complicated to wear than I had originally anticipated. I work in surgery and use headbands as an alternative to scrub crops in the warmer months. They do what I need them to do, once I get the fabric all straightened out, if not I get a splitting headache."
4.0,These earrings are pretty much as pictured. Some are cuter than others but I think i would’ve been happier with the option to purchase select ones vs all the styles as some of them I likely won’t wears
4.0,"Little small on the wrist, but it looks nice and shiny"
4.0,"Neat hat. Great fit for my fivehead! Had a small thread blemish on top &amp; a very light/small stain on the front but after few times out fishing, dressed as a Mob Boss on Halloween , etc it will blend."
4.0,Cheap material. Almost transparent. Still cute though and can still fit me
4.0,"Okay quality, not bad for price.  Be advised though that color listed as Rose-Red is really a true hot pink  !!!!!!!!!  If I had known this, I would not have ordered this color.  Also, takes several weeks for delivery from China (and no paperwork).  Otherwise, the hat fits well and looks good on the head."
4.0,"Runs large.  I am 5'4"", 140 lbs, 36C and it was too big.  Cute shirt, just not flattering on me"
4.0,its a nice casual dress that can be made a little more elegant with the correct accessories.
4.0,Smaller than I thought it would be but hugs your curves nicely and was a good purchase for the price.
4.0,"I gave these shorts four stars due to the fact that they did not fit as expected and aren’t true to size, so definitely size up when ordering. I ordered the XL for my husband and they are definitely not XL. Unfortunately they fit like a medium. They are great quality shorts and the compression within the shorts works as it should. The material is very nice as well!"
4.0,Has a great clasp. The slider to keep the band loop secure is loose and moves often so loop occasionally gets caught on things.
4.0,Its very nice but doesn't come with battery
4.0,"Really like this shirt, but beware it does shrink a lot when drying, so definitely only dry for like 10 mins and then air dry."
4.0,This is a good product. The only issue I had was with the shoe brush. It sheds when I use it. The microfiber buffing cloths are of good quality. I would definitely recommend this product.
4.0,"Material-3 out of 5:<br />The white material is semi-transparent and it feels like a semi stretchy artificial fabric that doesn't breath well.<br /><br />Fit-4 out of 5:<br /> I am 5'4"" and 125LBS. For me, this shirt is a bit large. I am looking for something that cuts closer to my waist line.<br /><br />Construction 3 out of 5:<br />In some areas, the stripes do not line up on the seams and other areas they do. But, it is proportioned the way it should be. Elbow patches are on elbows and shoulders patches are on sholders.<br /><br />Overall appearance 5 out of 5:<br />Minus stripe seams not aligning everywhere, this shirt is exactly as depicted by the manufacture."
4.0,Love the seed!  It's very pretty.  My only complaint was that the chain turned my neck green about two hours after I put it on.  I purchased a new chain an dput the dandelion seed on there.  Moving the &#34;WISH&#34; emblem was a bit harder as it's actually attached to the chain but I did get it on the new one.
4.0,"These are adorable!!! Purchased these for my son's Red Egg & Ginger party and they were a huge hit, everyone was taking pictures of them! The only thing is they're quite wide (to accommodate the tigers face/stitching) so there's gaps on the sides of his feet, definitely not a snug fitting shoe but not a big deal if your baby isn't walking yet. I ordered the 6-12 months for my large 4 mo old and there's still room to grow. They stayed on ok with the red tie straps but did have to re-tie them a couple times, again, not a big deal. These were perfect for our special occasion and so glad we ordered them!"
4.0,"This set came in a pack of 6 pairs of earrings. They are cute to hold. They are little and comfortable when worn. They are made of stainless steel. Each one has a  different pattern and is unique from the other one. I presume that since its made of stainless steel, it would last a longer time and won’t rust or discolor. A different pattern could be chosen every-time to wear as per one’s mood and desire."
4.0,Very comfortable and love the stretch quality. Looking forward to wearing them often for yoga and other exercise.
4.0,"Cute hat! Fits a little small, doesn't come all the way down on sides like a normal hat, seems to be cut small. But son loves it!"
4.0,These pants aren’t bad. They are stretchy and perfect for a casual get together. Would be nicer with thicker material. Other than that they get the job done !
4.0,"light weight, comfortable but tend to ride up with wear"
4.0,"The mint color is spot on and the fabric is fine, but it is a little shorter than I expected. I have a long torso and it hits at about my belly button. Still cute though"
4.0,"Pros: Shirt is super soft and looks good. However it does shrink quite even on low heat. I'm 5'10"" 180 athletic build and got a L. It shrunk to fit pretty snug so I suggest getting a size up especially if you're on the border between sizes.<br /><br />Con: shirt is VERY thin. I got the bottom caught in a zipper and after gently removing it I still ended up with a small hole in the shirt."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:5c68abf1ad7f46a6dece2c01872a7ee]] Summary: Decent quality down jacket with stuff sack - after converting sizing, the medium I received was about half a size larger than expected.<br /><br />Quality of the jacket was good - very smooth, light nylon shell with an adequate amount of fill.<br /><br />I wear a size medium jacket - I have a Patagonia down vest and hooded down jacket, as well as a medium Marmot technical shell.  This was an Asian 2XL, considered comparable to a US medium, and it fit just a touch larger than expected.  The chest was larger by perhaps 2-3&#34;, the sleeves fit very well and the body was a touch long.  No elastic on the waist, so you will get a draft there.  I am 5'11&#34;, 175 lbs, and wear a 16-34 dress shirt.<br /><br />Free/discounted sample provided for evaluation. My goal is an honest and informative review. If you have any questions or comments, please let me know!"
4.0,So cute.  Runs small.  Will return but will definitely order the next size up.
4.0,I liked the way the socks fit; however your claim that these socks are easy on  & off is not true for me.  I have rheumatoid arthritis & I had great difficulty getting the socks on and off!
4.0,"I got these leggins to use with my new high boots. I was excited when I got them, and ordered a 3XL just to make sure they fit. I finally wore them this morning. The quality feels good, and the length is just where it should be. The only drawback is that the fit does seem tight and a little small. I had to work them up to get over my butt, which I don't think is too big. I wear a size 16-18 depending on the item, and getting a 3XL seems like it should be just fine.<br /><br />I was able to work them up and get them worked out a bit to where they fit a little better now. However, when I sit down at work, I can feel them slide down the back a bit. They just don't want to stay up since they are definitely a little bit small for the back,and won't come up all the way. I did not think these would be like low rise leggings at all.<br /><br />So, here is my litle breakdown.<br /><br />Pros: Good quality material, good length, nice color (they don't seem faded at all and seem like they will stand up to a good amount of washings)<br /><br />Cons: These seem to run small. Be sure to get a couple sizes up from what you think you'd need.<br /><br />All in all, a good product, jjust make sure you buy big when you do."
4.0,Arrived early.  Fit on the head perfectly.  Only one thing we had to add our own jewels on the blank areas on the tiara.
4.0,"Very pretty color. Very pretty on except the straps are too long and the v neck line is a bit too deep for me. 121lbs, 5’3”, i got a small."
4.0,hold everything in as expected
4.0,"Not long enough, I thought it would be longer … it’s more wide than longer"
4.0,Fit as I expected. Cuter with a belt around the waste so it’s not as big around that area. All together it’s a very simple and cute dress. Would definitely buy another that’s similar.
4.0,This is nice and light perfect for a upscale event..
4.0,Love that it just snaps on!<br />Only negative is that because it's magnetic it sticks to all metal crap I get close too!
4.0,"I really like this purse. the leather is genuine and soft. The only small complaint that I have is that the shoulder strap is not leather, but fabric and what feels like imitation leather stitched on top of the fabric. Other than that, I am very well pleased (especially the price!) and plan to purchase some for my daughters for Christmas."
4.0,"Have received many compliments on this lovely, inexpensive scarf."
4.0,"Bought this for my wife and said that its ok, but the nose tip is a little too big."
4.0,nice good product
4.0,My granddaughters loved it!
4.0,The fit great and work pretty well!
4.0,Product would be perfect if the straps for the back pack option could be removed!
4.0,I love bedstu and love the look of these boots. Ordered them for when I ride on the motorcycle with my guy this fall. Fit a little tight on the ankle and foot area and not the most comfy but I will make do cause I love the look of them. Had a chemical smell when opened from the dyes I guess. Love the way the sole looks on them as well. Order a size up!
4.0,We bought this for costume jewelry and have received many compliments much to our surprise considering the price.  Good value.
4.0,It's really nice and light weight and it's lined for cooler weather. The material is well made and holds up.<br />The size is true but if you're going to wear it for Cowboy Action Shooting I would go up one size for holsters.
4.0,"Love this bracelet, but losing trust in Uno de 50 as I’ve written them several times to replace earring backs that fell off, even lost one I loved because of it.  They respond, but no follow through."
4.0,"Looks good, fits in all the right places.  I notice that the front is piling a bit since it rubs against the front of my desk at work.  But, I like how it looks and feels."
4.0,This is a great addition to my winter nightgowns.
4.0,I'm 5'6&#34; 130lbs and ordered and medium - fits perfectly. Material is thin but light and perfect for Florida heat! Would totally order again.
4.0,It not as pretty as it looks in the picture but is still a nice necklace. The quality is good.
4.0,The quality and size is great. But the color is way off. It's got more of a purple vibe then tan/cream which I didn't like
4.0,"Hi, my wife likes this outfit. I ordered a 2X because of shrinkage. I am glad I did it shrank to a xtra large size after washing and drying.<br />one bad thing is the colors ran making the white pulls a puke pink color. That was disappointing."
4.0,"A little tight behind the ears but I needed a narrow band for summer hair control, it will do the job.  It took about 3 weeks to get them but they tell you that."
4.0,"These are very nice, comfortable and warm.  It took awhile for them to get here, but they are worth the price."
4.0,It was really pretty and looked like good quality but runs really small
4.0,"It tends to pop open for some reason, but still worth it"
4.0,I wanted a lightweight robe because I get hot and this is what I got. Snaps tend to come undone with a little stress so I choose a larger size. I am satisfied with this robe.
4.0,Great addition to my collection of big Sterling Silver rings. Very happy with my purchase!
4.0,Cute but very...very large. Had to wear as a dress with leggings.
4.0,Great pair of yoga pants for the money!<br />They fit great!! I have 5 pairs in different colors!!  Will buy more.
4.0,I love the shorts but its probably not the best fit for me. It certainly has a skinny jeans waistline cut.
4.0,"I've gone through three pairs of these frames since I have twin toddlers and before that was just clumsy. They hold up pretty well and look great, but y only complaint is that for me the right arm (leg?) eventually falls off. I'd say they last for about 2 years at a time and maybe I'd change it up, but my lenses are expensive and it's so easy to just pop on over to the store and have them change them out."
4.0,"I thought the look of this shirt was cute so decided to get it in yellow, in the hopes that it would be more like the green in main picture, but it's more of a yellow-ish avocado. It actually doesn't even look like the yellow in the other pictures. No bigs for me since I didn't pay for it, but if I had I would have been annoyed. I wasn't sure about the design with the waffle knit, and to be honest, I'm still not, but it still looks cute. I think it would drape better if it didn't have that though. The small seems to be true to size and fits me well. It's comfortable and washes well. I'm actually surprised at how inexpensive this is and if they ever get this in green or purple, I'd definitely get those as well."
4.0,"Fit nicely, compared to the sizing."
4.0,"Too big n hardly see I am 5'6"" that shark look like 5'9 or something n I liked n saving for stage drama .."
4.0,Very comfortable and great fit. I've ordered another in a different color.
4.0,Really liked just a little too small
4.0,Product is a little on the bigger side.
4.0,I bought this for a Christmas cantata which I am in.  Haven’t wore it yet.
4.0,It is pretty and comfortable. My only complaint is that it is a wrinkles mess after wearing for 5 minutes. True to size
4.0,It was a gift for a friend and she loved them!!!
4.0,Four stare because we haven’t tried it yet<br />but it’s looks great!
4.0,"This is a very nice piece, looks good and the blue bead is an eye catcher.<br />I should have asked how big it is as this bracelet is very small in size. It was too small for the woman I bought it for. This is perfect for a smaller woman's wrist or teen.<br />If a larger size is offered I would buy it."
4.0,"I like the different colors.  However, are smaller then what I thought but still works.  It does take some patience when switching bands but worth it for stylish colors."
4.0,They are very pretty. Sturdy. They do make noise so beware. I love them.
4.0,"Kids sizes were small, I would go up 2 sizes."
4.0,"Bueno el precio es para mi caro por que la tela es descartable,las tallas y el diseño son bien,también sta todo barba, gorro etc. para fiesta navideña."
4.0,It was good but I would have liked it a little bigger.
4.0,Love the sweater - good construction - great color - had to reorder in a larger sizes because they are not true to size - I wear a xlarge and had to reorder in a 3x to have the sweater fit comfortably.
4.0,Good quality and fast delivery great buy
4.0,"Overall we are pleased with these markers for their size and color selection, but I am still waiting to find markers that my kids don't use up in the first 2 weeks we own them.  I am starting to think that my kids must just color excessively compared to average kids.  I am amazed at how often we buy new markers.  Still I gave a fairly high rating because the colors and washable factor was so good.  I just wished they lasted longer or could refilled somehow."
4.0,"my husband loves his and purchased this one for me,"
4.0,"I am glad I purchased this purse. It came on time, it is sturdy, looks good and I get compliments when other ladies see it. I'm looking forward to getting more colors of this purse. Thank you"
4.0,This product was made out of good quality material but I found out that the size does not run true to American sizes I usually wear a 12 to a size 14 I ended up sending the first one back and was hoping that the second one would fit which was a XXl and it still didn't fit me I hate to say it but I gave up after that.<br />Judy
4.0,"Mine are a *little* big because I need a 9.5, but had to settle for a 10. They are wonderful! It is a little hard to get used to walking in the platform, but it's really sturdy and the color is great. I love them."
4.0,I love the Jacquard fabric and the print. The picture shown is as I received it. The body fits fine and the buttons close nicely over my front (which is 38DDD). The arms are a bit less forgiving however and I am concerned that once I launder this item it will shrink. I will also not be able to wear a long sleeve shirt underneath as I do with other similar Mordenmiss items I've purchased. I would suggest dry-cleaning only. It is a wonderful garment with a nice hearty fabric. I would order an XXL next time for the arm size.
4.0,Very cute bracelet. My daughter loves it.
4.0,This jacket is the best I’ve seen for a m65 repo.  It’s almost as good as the original military issue ones from the 60 and 70s. The only thing I don’t like is the zip away hood. It’s completely useless and fits my head terrible. Other than the hood it’s perfect and fits great. I use this jacket as a fall early spring jacket and I don’t think we the liner. However with the liner it will work for winter and keep you warm. Everything is a bit stiff at first but breaks in nicely. Quality product.
4.0,"The dress is very figure flattering and fits well. My only complaint is that it only has a hem stitch and not an actual hem on the bottom. The seam on the side of the skirt also wasn't stitched together, so it had a three inch hole in the side, but that was easy to fix with a needle and thread. I really like the dress but quality control really needs to do a better job checking the seams and stitching."
4.0,cool. Male friend loved it
4.0,I bought this dress for a party. It’s very nice but I just need to lose a couple of inches around my stomach to feel completely comfortable. I’m 5’0 and 190lbs. I ordered a large. If I would’ve went up a size it would’ve been too big. Overall it’s a beautiful dress
4.0,Just what I was looking for. 5 inches extension.  Most only had 3 INCH ones. It's great because it fits over my head. So I don't have to bother with the clasp. Only downside.  One end of the clasp is smaller. Hard to connect to necklace if you have shaky hands or not 20/20 vision
4.0,"I love love ❤ this little piece for 10 bucks I'm 5'3 187lbs im a brown girl so im built likeva short thick brown pearl 😘 I brought this in blk mine came with 3 1/2 length sleeve "" luv ""size medium fits perfect😍 can wear it with slides heels or sneakers which i plan to do all 3,hope u like your purchase"
4.0,"beautiful watch, but very big on the wrist"
4.0,"I wanted to add a little something-something to my ear combo for everyday wear. This pack gives exactly what I was looking for. You can pair these with other earrings to give that edgy look to your ears-while still being feminine. The hooks can sometimes slide off, so just make sure they are secure."
4.0,The dress fit well and way very flattering.
4.0,"Great books, they are pretty comfortable. Wish I had a little bit more padding on the inside so you could wear them all day"
4.0,"Pretty decent,  I'd buy again."
4.0,not for very large wrists....if you are above six feet highly doubt it would fit.
4.0,The shirt is nice overall but I was hoping for a more tapered and tight fit around the waist area.  Probably more than ok for most but I'm very lean and look best in tapered shirts.
4.0,Good plus size dress
4.0,"The color of this gym bag is advertised as pink, but is a coral color. Definitely not pink. It works fine for my needs. I’m using it for a gym bag. It’s not too large, like my old gym bag, and I like that it has a plastic coated pocket for damp items. It is a great place to put my gym towel after I work out. I also like that it has two separate compartments, plus The zippered compartment underneath for shoes. Besides the color being inaccurate, I am happy with my purchase."
4.0,Got the XXL because I was scared for the XL would be small ...<br />Ended up too large and too long ... But the linen is of great quality...
4.0,"I'll admit, I bought this sheerly because the pseudo-transformers look matches the black and glass style of my computer build. But does it work? Indeed it does. I literally just got it so I can't speak to its durability but it does all the usual mouse stuff. The removal of a star is for there being zero instructions. The pictures above are a bit confusing. One shows the center arrow buttons marked<br />dpi + and the other fire. The second shows the top as dpi + and the bottom dpi -. Still not sure but not having difficulty. If you want a mouse to do some sort of competative gaming this might not work for you since theres really no way to tell what dpi your set too. Forget finding software online either, this company seems to have no web prescence at all. Works as a basic mouse, looks cool to me, no instructions and no corporate contact."
4.0,"Fit perfectly after cutting out the inner lining. Before doing that, it was way too tight. Super cute dress and color is great! Perfect for my disco themed function."
4.0,It was pretty much what I expected and worked for what I need (a Glinda the good witch costume) but it was a little big. The size chart showed me at an extra large (I'm 5'9 185 lbs) but if I had it to do again I'd get a large. The color was pretty and length was good.
4.0,Suits the purpose
4.0,Lots of compliments. Fits nicely. No pockets :(
4.0,"These sandals are very comfortable compared to leather or pleather sandals because the straps do not bother my feet. They don’t chaffe and they stretch nicely when I’m walking.<br />They are very cute with the style of the crisscrossed bands as well, I’ve received a lot of compliments."
4.0,"Though it wasn't the easiest to put together ( very small parts and my boyfriend has very large hands lol), it turned out great and he is so happy to be wearing his favorite watch again :)"
4.0,So far I'm loving these. Wood is very lightweight. I did think they were larger based off some reviews bcuz I like big earrings. I changed all the hardware bcuz its hard to find them in silver.
4.0,Worked as expected for costume. Looked nice.
4.0,"This swimsuit is VERY cute. The fabric is nice quality, the entire piece is lined. Contrary to the reviews it does NOT run small, it is NOT short waisted. I ordered an XL, based on the size chart and the reviews. IT IS HUGE. As in I would need to gain 40 pounds for it to fit me huge. I'm losing patience ordering clothing on Amazon, due to people leaving reviews about the sizing being off. Every time I've listened to that complaint, I've ended up with an item that needed to be returned because it was too big. I'm returning this one and ordering a size medium."
4.0,"other brands of med boxers fit great but got these in med and way to small! Got them in large they fit fine, a lil snug."
4.0,"Very cute dress, but the armpits are huge. Will need to get that tailored, unfortunately it has a zipper in the armpit so it will cost more. Material is not bad. Don't order up sizes. You will want to get a black belt or something for your waist as it does not tailor to a waist line at all."
4.0,I was so excited to get this dress and it fits really well. BUT the zipper got easily stuck and I couldn't zip it even while it was hanging on a hanger. I'm returning it but hope the next one I order is perfect.
4.0,"Finally, I found a small sized umbrella for traveling. One less star because it was hard to open when I started to use it."
4.0,Bracelets were just like the picture/description.
4.0,"Great fit and very comfortable. I dont like that you can completely see the pads through the bra :( other than that, nice buy"
4.0,They look and feel great! But when jumping around these tend to slide down. My other gym pants don't do this
4.0,"The length, fit and material of these shorts are awesome.  I am 5'10, about 200 lbs and a Large fit me great.  It's in the name and description but wasn't really expecting the liner.. and still on the fence with them.  With gym shorts, I tend to use them a few times before washing them, with the liner in this thing, they can obviously get a little funky after one wear so thats not going to work.  Other than that, they are great shorts and really good for riding a bike, spin or anything you use shorts for.<br /><br />**Almost forgot got the red, white and blue ones also and they turned a few items they were washed with pink from bleeding in the wash... not cool, so be advised."
4.0,"So warm! A see bit long but fit in my boots just fine. Wear wonderfully under my skirts, perfect for winter weather."
4.0,it's really nice and perfect for my cruella costume
4.0,i like the earrings. I thought the raven was bigger. I had to use a magnifying glass to see it.
4.0,"I like the dress.  Bought a medium and I wear a sz 6 dress and fits like a sz 6 dress or US small. Touches upper part of knees in lenghth and I am 5.3, 34C bra sz , 27 to to 28 in waist, and !30 lbs.  The orange shows the type of material used as being light colored and didn't look expensive.  But you get what you pay for! Otherwise I like the dress and will fit every occasion. I am thinking of buying the raspberry."
4.0,"I have so much trouble with me feet and being a woman, I'll try any summer shoes to help them, even men's sized shoes.  I should have tried a full size smaller, but made the mistake in the size I chose.  Too big.  I did try them on and had I gotten the proper size, I probably would have liked wearing them regularly."
4.0,"I normally wear a size Medium and these are a tight medium.  The large size would have been a better choice for me.  Order a size up from what you normally wear.  These fit pretty tight, kind of like a compression short.  I don't think I will be having any creep up or down in these.  The quality is nice, they feel nice, they look good.<br /><br />I will be wearing these but do wish that I had ordered a size bigger."
4.0,As expected but only because I read reviews and ordered larger.  This runs small definitely.
4.0,My grand daughter loves them. They are very cute.
4.0,Arms slightly tight but otherwise fits well.
4.0,Saw on YouTube and wanted to see if the claims of wearing for days without smelling was true.  It is true.  Wore for 14 days.  Took off at night. No smell the following day.
4.0,"Bought a medium. I have ordered from this brand before, good stretch. Love this company. Pretty Green in person. I wish it was more of a midi length but I will order more from them."
4.0,My son loves it. it is well made and cute
4.0,"Very cheap material. Thin and could probably break easily. But for the price, it's not that bad! Plus it comes with 8 chokers! If you're expecting fantastic quality then you should know better than to buy jewelry of any kind for this price. I like them and they serve their purpose."
4.0,"Very nice quality - its a little big but you can tighten it with the band - however, it does change the look of the hat.  The value is very good."
4.0,Perfect. Cute but a littel Long for my baby ofrece 2 yearsold . I order 2t
4.0,Great glasses very stylish really protects your eyes from the sun!
4.0,"I bought my wife two of the Fitbit branded stainless steel bands at $100 each. Both broke. This band looks almost identical, but the clips are metal, not plastic! This band is great and because it has a brushed finish, it doesn't show scratches like her old ones. Awsome!"
4.0,These are real colorful and true to the product colors. They are simple and a little smaller sized so they are great for everyday use. They do require some fluffing due to the packaging.
4.0,The 2 chains as a purchase were a great length and the quality of the chains were great.  It keeps me in remembrance of who is my of resource? GOD Almighty my provider.
4.0,They are cute but I was missing one of them
4.0,It’s very lightweight
4.0,"Super pretty, easy on/off but feels very secure on my wrist. The magnet enclosure on the back where the Fitbit Flex 2 resides seems to be a very strong magnet but not so hard to open that I couldn't get the Fitbit in there. This is fairly loose on my wrist, but so far, it has the same step count as my phone, so it appears to be working. I really like the rose gold, although I am concerned about how it will last in the long term. The silicon/rubber strap that came with my Fitbit was causing a rash on my wrist, so I'm trying this, although I'll need to switch to the old strap when I work in my garden or head to the pool. Will update periodically; hope it is a good purchase long-term!"
4.0,I would buy two inches more the nextime I will for my size 28 so in the future i will buy 29 or 30 great clothe to wear :)
4.0,The pants fit great and the quality was amazing 😉
4.0,"Bought as a gift, it's pretty, it was well liked. Not the greatest if quality but it is cute and versatile"
4.0,Very nice very very long
4.0,"The earrings are pretty, nothing special though. I was expecting more for this price. If buying this as a gift you might need to purchase a different box too because it comes in a cheap, ugly box. They are smaller than expected, in the description photos they look bigger."
4.0,It’s a decent bag but the material feels really cheap
4.0,"My daughter loved these- she is 11 and though she was super cool when she put these on but she didn’t wear out in public, lol"
4.0,"Some of the colors are a bit redundant, and the hinge quality is all over the board (some barely open enough to reach over an average- thickness tie), but for the money I'm very happy."
4.0,"I purchased 2 of these as gifts. Interesting concept: teen girls loved opening the shell to find their pearls, match the pearl colors to the assigned meanings, and placing them into their necklaces. Quality of the necklaces could have been much better, but was commensurate with the price point. I hope this review was helpful to you.."
4.0,These were probably the cutest ones of all the ones I've ordered from amazon. I just wish they would have been slightly smaller - they were too big and just didn't quite look right on me. They seemed well made though!
4.0,"Very neat shirt, good quality, bought for an exchange student living in mn over christmas. Its not a fitted shirt. Runs more like a mans cut. Very happy with it!"
4.0,"This is the cutest, the only exception is the pearl button was very loose. So I removed it."
4.0,"better materials than expected, fits great"
4.0,"The dress was a perfect addition to my granddaughters dress up clothes. It was a little long, but I ordered it a size larger so she could wear it longer."
4.0,"Cute shirt! A little wide on my skinny 2 year old, but material is good. Washes well!"
4.0,"My gf loved it, so thays all that mattered, but the silver wears out fast."
4.0,"Got here sooner than expected. Very cute and looks just like pictured! Soft material, thin but nice. I ordered a size 1-2 for my 19 month old who is only a little bigger for her age and it doesn't fit well. Very hard to get off and on and not long enough. I ordered a 2-3 and hoping that fits better. This is not a 2 piece shirt and skirt set as advertised. The &#34;shirt&#34; and &#34;skirt&#34; are sewn together making it more a dress. Still looks nice though."
4.0,"I bought my 21 year old daughter in college these in medium by her request.  Initially, she was sad because she thought they would be smaller.  However, when she put her makeup on and put them on, she was surprisingly happy.  She gets many compliments.  Recommend this product highly although she thinks that they have a slight prescription to them because she wears contacts under them and she cannot see as clearly as she would if she were wearing contacts alone."
4.0,nicely made would buy again
4.0,"It’s a good watch heavy, good band, and good quality."
4.0,One of the best sandles I've ever worn just a little pricey.
4.0,"Beautiful dress! If only it fit :( I'm a women's size 12/14, 40DD, 5'3 and following the size chart I should have fit into a Large. Being skeptical, I ordered up to an XL anyway and the XL does not fit. The back will not zip.<br /><br />The silky material and sheen of this dress is what makes it so beautiful. From the front view I could tell it would be so flattering on any body type because of the tie, which can be worn in the front or the back. The way the skirt pleats together is so pretty and flows beautifully. This would have been perfect for the dinner I wanted to wear this to for work.<br /><br />Deducted one star because of the size chart being inaccurate."
4.0,The fabric is soft and very nice. Good for a walk on a snow day.
4.0,This belt added just enough bling to my outfit for a wedding.
4.0,Disappointed it did not come with a clear pouch for card key..we plan to use it on a Disney vaca in the future.
4.0,"Very comfortable because the band under the bust is not really tight like with some other products.  I also really like the straps on the back - nice detail.  The front scoop neck is a bit low - if you're really busty it doesn't provide high coverage.  It's not too revealing, but also doesn't cover everything up if that's a concern."
4.0,"I ordered four pair of hiking pants for an upcoming trip. Using the appropriate size charts I got as close as possible to my normal pant size of 36W x 34L, which resulted in two pair of these sized 34, one pair size L, and one pair size M. All four pair fit but these and the L are a bit tighter around the waist and hips than the Medium. Fortunately the length is good. Definitely use the size charts when ordering! These are a little tight on the hips specifically, which may be restricting when scrambling over rocks. They seem to be of good quality so hopefully they will be durable enough to withstand the hikes that we will be on in the coming weeks. I'll try to update after if I remember. Based on my initial impression, I would probably not order these again but, I will keep them for this trip."
4.0,"This coat is excellent quality. It's lined throughout with velcro cuffs to adjust, zippered pockets, and some gathering on the hood which I love because the hood actually stays on. The fit is pretty slim though. Our daughter is big for her age so I sized up but it's tight on her & the sleeves are miles too long. I'm keeping it because I'm hoping it will fit later after a growing spurt. We bought size 9/10 which is what we normally buy."
4.0,Pretty light and good build.
4.0,"I bought 5 different styles of SweatyRocks pants--all fit a bit different. This review is for the Black, Full Length, Side Cutout Leggings, in One Size (see attached photo of me wearing them)<br /><br />I'm 5'9&#34; 143 lbs, 36-29-37 measurements. I'm right at the max height and weight for these to fit. Anyone 150+lbs (and tall) or with measurements bigger than mine, will struggle to get these on, if at all! If long legged, like myself, they will be a lil short. Lastly, the material attracts hair, lint, ect. like crazy--so carry a lint brush with you!<br /><br />Overall, if you normally wear a Woman's size Medium, size 6 or under, these should fit. I don't mind the length (tad short) but I do mind being covered in puppy hair & mediocre fabric.<br /><br />But.. I love the unique cutout look, rather than basic, plain leggings! Overall, I look great (& slim) in these. For the low price, my expectations were met. And I only took off 1 Star for the cons. I'll be buying more of these unique, stylish leggings :)"
4.0,This watch is Beautiful but did not come with any extra links so it fit too tight for my wrist.
4.0,Beautiful dress. Was a little big but not unwearable. Got here super fast.
4.0,It was great for the price but still didn’t fit her little head lol
4.0,"This is a nice key ring. The logo looks nice, it is solid and feels like a quality product. I wonder if the connector between the logo and the ring will hold up over time, but for now I am very pleased with it. The box (pictured) that it came in was smushed, the inside lining is a cheap plastic, but neither of those things affect the key ring, but might bother you if you were giving this as a gift. The label on the back is labeled with both Toyota and Infiniti in the title, which is odd. Overall, as a keychain I am pleased, and feels like a good value."
4.0,"Okay so the description is wrong about this being an earring but clearly the photo shows its a ring.  So I knew exactly what I was getting when I ordered this. A Ring.  It’s a larger ring, smaller then I have seen lately in most “fashion” magazines and articles about “statement” pieces.  The band is decent in width and pretty easy to adjust in size.  I don’t suspect this will be retailing for a ton of money because this is 100% costume jewelry, or something that is only worn as an accessory to a specific outfit.  The metal is well cast, the elephant  is recognizable and the turquoise background has nice coloring.  Really this ring is all about personal preference, if you only like simple standard classic cuts then a funky ring with an elephant is’t going to be your thing.  I took off a star because to adjust this band it opens at the top, directly under the top of the ring, and if you are like me and tend to twist your bands when working, this can scratch your finger if you are pressing to hard, I corrected the issue by filing the opening edge but I shouldn’t have to do that. This may leave tarnish marks on some people, but for me it hasn’t."
4.0,It was a gift but my mom loves them.
4.0,Beautiful dress!  Fit was perfect.  4 stars only because it’s a bit on the sheer side.
4.0,I like it.  It fit perfectly and will be easy to accessorize.
4.0,Nice. Will probably be ordering again soon.
4.0,It was cute but just too big on.
4.0,"So I ordered charcoal and black in 34 Long since I am 5/8 1/2 and 120 lbs. I must say, FINALLY some long enough pants that fit well. However, the charcoal colored pair felt and fit differently. They were more papery and wrinkle-prone(and tight in the wrong areas), so I'll return them but I will keep the black because they are AMAZING. Both pairs fit slightly smaller than I expected but it's cool, and they definitely enhance the butt area (even for me) so keep that in mind. The black pair especially seem perfect for work and I'll be washing them in cold. THANKS"
4.0,Well built and good quality for the price.  Would have given 5 stars but for the excessive shipping cost.
4.0,Love this shirt. Fits great and very soft. Haven't washed yet do not sure if shrinks
4.0,Very nice. I am very happy with it. I recommend it.
4.0,"Fit of the shirt is good, but the hood is gigantic. It is unwearable due to it swallowing your entire head. I wear the shirt without the hood which is great but sort of sad because I bought it for the reason of having a hood."
4.0,was the exact color i needed
4.0,"I got this  for my grand daughter  and she is very excited and loves it.  Mermaids and Frozen  are her  favorites.  I would not  really call this  a swimsuit.  More  a dress up and pretend outfit. But  she is having so much fun  playing in it.  It would  make an adorable  Halloween  costume.  It  is not made the best.  The shorts and tail are very thin , Not sure how long they will stay shiny.  But  it is worth  the money to me  to see my grand daughter having fun and the big smile on her face.<br />I received this at a discount  for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"Coat looks to be of well stitched quality. However, the feltish lining is a lint magnet! Will need to use a lint brush from time to time.  Oh and the jacket has a paperish crinkly noise when moving around in it even though the material of the outer shell doesn't look and feel cheap."
4.0,"I usually like to use strap buttons on all my acoustic instruments but didn't have time to put them on my new Kala 8 string ukulele for a performance so I purchased this by it's reviews. When I try to use it just around my neck, even at the shortest setting, this strap is still too long and my Uke hangs by my belly. I then looped it around my neck and right shoulder and now it's good to go. It's  a bit of a hassle putting on and taking off, but when it's on it stays on. Uke hangs OK and the plastic hook on the sound hole doesn't scratch my glossy Uke and it stays on... Just got to remember that it's not a regular strap and I still have to use my right forearm to hold my Uke up... Good enough!"
4.0,"I bought this stainless Steel bracelet for my 46mm Galaxy Watch & it looks & feels great. It came in all silver & one that's silver & black center links. It also came with extra pins & a tool to remove the pins from the bracket to get a perfect fit. I love the all silver one the best & I can switch them up if I want. It's easy to take on & off, but when it's on it""s not coming off unless u pull the tabs."
4.0,Love the material and design but it doesn’t stay on because it’s a shallow cap.
4.0,"Great crossbody satchel, ordered and took on road trip!  It was great but I wish it had a zipped pocket on back of satchel, I was constantly in my purse for phone and the purse is deep."
4.0,Really nice watch band. Tool that it comes with to remove the links didn't work so well and is kind of cheap but the watch band itself is nice and works great!
4.0,"Product description was accurate and helpful. The jewelry is of good quality and as described. However, after cleaning in rubbing alcohol the stone seems to have lost its color. If it weren't for that, I would have given 5 stars."
4.0,"I loved the design and fabric of these briefs.  Unfortunately, the usual size six I always get was a bit too small - didn't come up to my waist.  So I returned them (thank you for the free return!) and ordered a size seven, because I liked everything else about them."
4.0,"Nice fabric, good color. My husband normally wears a large. I ordered a large, the company sent an XL, and the shirts are still VERY tight. Order at least 2 sizes larger to get a form fitting but not skin tight fit."
4.0,"I ordinarily wear a size 7-1/2 hat and the RAB Shadow Beanie fits great. It is very warm for a relatively lightweight beanie. It covers the ears well, without the annoying habit of creeping up while you're doing something active. Well made, comfortable on your head, and warm. My hair is medium length, I cannot vouch for how it acts with longer hair."
4.0,Too large... we gonna keep it for later.
4.0,"Good for running during the summer months. Love the side pocket, holds my iPhone in place. If you’re looking for high compression, I think they run a little big, I wear a size S and feel an XS would be a better fit. A good but nonetheless!!"
4.0,"Loved the fit, and the material is nice (not cheap). The only complaint  is the top is not an accurate cup size, it's a little small. But totally still cute and wearable."
4.0,"I love the flowy look of this dress. The length is perfect to wear with over the knee boots if you are petite. I'm 5 ft and 101 lbs. I added a black Gucci dupe belt, tights and black Dream Pair over the knee boot and it is a great outfit!"
4.0,"i LOVE the weight of the robe. Not too heavy and not too light. Great robe. However, with the sizing Med/Lg. That is off. It would be better, in my opinion, to have a straight Med size and another in size Large. But  otherwise  the robe is fine. If I bought the smaller size it would probably not close on the bottom. thank you"
4.0,Fits well everywhere except across the breast area.
4.0,Se pueden competir es genial
4.0,"Most were great, a couple were “backwards”, but that was easily remedied! Very cute designs- they were part of gift baskets and the recipients loved them!"
4.0,"Very cute but fits rather large, especially in the arms. Too long for a small! I wish there was a smaller size...I want it to be more fitted"
4.0,Amazing !!!!!
4.0,"love wearing them all day,  thank you"
4.0,"Very pretty, great seller!!"
4.0,"Beautiful bra, slightly small, definitely did not shape well though"
4.0,"I bought the ""blue"" design. The color IS NOT true to picture. I was hoping for the ""darker heather blue"" stripes pictured, and but it's actually a Baby Blue stripe(s). If you're in between sizes, go up one size. I wear Large and went up one size to XL, and it fits well. Good luck!"
4.0,"The mask was a bit small but still workable.<br />The instructions sucked!<br />They were printed on a tiny leaf-let that a fire-ant couldn't read.<br />Even after reading it important usage facts were omitted such as how to connect it via Bluetooth and how to use any feature other than adding text.<br />Its a good product, but I saw many reviews by others who became frustrated with it due to horribly written instructions.<br />By the way, you have to turn on location before you can connect via Bluetooth to allow your phone to control the mask. You also can use the phone app to change other graphics and doodle by swiping left or right on the character screen on the app.  The instructions really didn't explain anything useful."
4.0,Bigger than expected. I ordered a small. I'm 5'3&#34; 120 lbs. it's a bit bigger. I know it's supposed to be loose fitting but it's still bigger than I thought. I'm gonna wash it and see if it shrinks. It's super cute though. I wear it with leggings and boots.
4.0,The skirt is beautiful and the material is also but it is way too large.
4.0,They are a good fit good tummy tuck
4.0,"They stay on, but you’ll need to adjust them when they bunch up at the end of your glasses’ arms. I bought them to ease discomfort from my glasses rubbing on the back of my ear, and they work! Though, if I have my hair pulled back, they’re quite visible on my glasses. But I guess that’s ok."
4.0,"I've bought these mask twice for me, and once for my wife. I particularly like the bands that don't have to go any where above your ears. I wear glasses and an walkie talkie earpiece at work which doesn't leave room for around the ears bands. The only draw back on these is that the metal piece for tighter fit around the nose to prevent glass fogging doesn't hold up for as long as I would like it to be."
4.0,I ordered the large in Grey. Nice shirt. Long in the back. The buttons were a bit difficult due to the hole to fit them in was too small. After washing and drying like normal it shrank. Fits better but now not baggy like i like it. Will need to iron this top too
4.0,"These are nice medal buttons; however, they are kind of small."
4.0,"I’ve fallen for the “worlds smallest dot helmet” before. This fits much better, sits a little tiny bit  higher than I’d like but it’s no where near as bad as some other ::cough:: biker beanie helmets.com ::cough:: that claim to be the “smallest” .<br /><br />I have one last brand to try but I think this one is about as good fitting as a helmet can fit and still have SOME protection and still meet DOT."
4.0,"The charges were a gift and she loves them. However, they are not as appealing as pictured. I should've taken a picture before gifting them."
4.0,Not for the large chested. The rest of the dress fit great
4.0,"I normally wear an XL for looser stylings and ordered this in XXL to make sure it was extra flowy. Unfortunately, it's still a bit clingier than I was hoping. Arms and chest area are ok. The hip/length is smaller."
4.0,"Like others I found the ear cuff painful and the entire piece would not stay on if I moved my head at all. So after reading other reviews I made careful adjustments to the cuff. Third try was the charm, I can put it on and wear it without pain. Best of all it stays in place during my normal activities. It drew many comments at first and now friends look to see if I have my ""pet"" with me. I still would not wear it dancing but Snap is now a welcome addition to my ear wardrobe."
4.0,They are difficult to put in and fasten.
4.0,"I could get my foot in the shoe in my normal size, but it wasn't exactly &#34;slide on&#34;. I had to actually bend down and pull the shoe up rather forcefully to get it over my heel. There's no give in the top opening of the shoe. That being said it is VERY soft and comfortable once on. I was just looking for something more of an easy on and off shoe. I'll be returning but I would still recommend if that doesn't bother you."
4.0,Very very nice case overall. Seems very protective and I just don’t even worry about it when I drop it. A little bigger than I thought and a bit chunky.
4.0,Nice style for a goodt price.
4.0,A 2X fits someone 5'2&#34; and 150 lbs with no breasts. Choose your size wisely. It's less mossy in color and very bright apple like a green apple.
4.0,I t is just the right size and the cross body strap is just right.
4.0,Good product. Runs very small. Could not wear but very soft material.
4.0,Fits well but not as thick as expected. They look more like tights than leggings.
4.0,"These were okay. Not super heavy. They kind of feel cheap, which is what I expected for the price."
4.0,Great thick material not see-through at all
4.0,"I like the dress I need to take it in, it was bigger than i expected"
4.0,"I have a keychain being made for me but it's in Slovakia and will take another month or two before I get it. I bought this Bigfoot one to hold my keychain needs until then and figured I would either give it to a friend or just put him up on a shelf. I only gave 4 stars because it is smaller than expected and I think for the price, Bigfoot could be more detailed. The keychain I'm having made was two dollars more than this one but has a lot more detail in it and is also made of pewter. Still, it's not bad."
4.0,They don't stay on all the time but are better than all the rest!  Arrived promptly too.
4.0,There's definitely a good variety of colors and they're adjustable which is nice. Only thing I'd say is the beads look a little bigger in person than in the picture and not as shiny. Still love them though
4.0,"It's a decent bracelet, but the fastener is a little awkward, and it is exceptionally small. I have relatively thin wrists, it's just so tight."
4.0,It's cute. It's runs a bit small. I got a bigger size and then it became a bit to big in the bust. But it's still cute and snug enough to wear.
4.0,"I LOVE THESE!! i got them so quick and i'm already so in love with them! one of them did come broken and i just grabbed a pair of pliers and fixed it so no big deal. also, one of them came with one of the clasps not working properly, but again no big deal it still works! i did end up taking off the extra rings because i personally don't like them. but overall, i really recommend these for the price!"
4.0,They have some nice features I like the zippers and the leather pieces around the pull string  But I do wish the material was a little thicker
4.0,"The hoop end wasn't completely hidden in my nose, but for the most part it looks really nice and was exactly what I expected it to be."
4.0,Too hot where I’m from so will where it in December
4.0,"These have just the right amount of compression for me. They do run a little long though. It goes just above my knee and the foot part goes up to the middle of my toes, covering my pinky toe. For reference, I wear a 30 inch inseam and size 9 shoe."
4.0,"Jersey feels really cheap, snags easily, per the size guide it was rather large but my son loves it and it was decently priced so I can’t really complain."
4.0,good slippers for the price.
4.0,Very pretty necklace.  Nice packaging.  Perfect gift
4.0,"This is a great cheap way to have different bow colors instead of spending a lot more money for fancy bows. The fact that is ribbon material isnt the best, cloth would definitely be much better (but i guess thats what you pay for). It's a pretty nice sized bow for a baby- I'll have to see how it fits on my little girl. The colors are pretty good too and match the picture."
4.0,Vibrant and soft
4.0,Love the tshirt but i amazon sent the wrong size.
4.0,LOVE THIS NECKLACE..
4.0,"The masks are made very well and the filters fit perfectly in the pockets. My order did not arrive on the date expected, but it was only a day behind."
4.0,"Jacket is made of good quality material. Will last a long time in my closet, everyone needs a classic trench and I like that it has buttons and a belt. Perfect for rainy or chilly weather but need a little something extra snazzy on.<br /><br />My only critique is the color Khaki, looks more like a dark cream/ivory.<br />Not to say I don’t like it , in my opinion, it doesn’t scream Khaki. I took 1 star off for that. Great jacket otherwise, I would order 1 in every color if I could!"
4.0,"Runs large, and short not for tall people"
4.0,Very cute and soft material. The only problem is the item did not hold up in the washing machine and the material “ pilled ” after a couple of washes.
4.0,"The pin looks great and would have given 5 stars, however the pin is a lot more flimsy than pins that I own."
4.0,"Seems to be made for long torsos, because in order to tie the neck tight enough to keep the top secure, the hem under the bra cups come up too high, almost over my bust - but removing the bra pads helped that a bit.  Flattering shape with the curvy style and ruching."
4.0,"These were a great addition to the costume, and a nice size. Ended up pinning them to the hat which worked out really well.  Fun!  :)"
4.0,Super cute and fun. Only 4 stars because of them being a bit heavy.
4.0,"This has been very helpful for getting my 7 year old daughter to her virtual school meetings on time. Her teacher made an overly complex daily schedule for 2nd graders and my daughter was often late to or missing meetings altogether. Now we set alarms for a few minutes before each meeting and when it goes off she knows she needs to transition right away to her meeting.<br /><br />It’s nice having a fairly low-tech solution for this. Other things we considered were regular alarm clocks or smart devices, but they were either not enough functionality or way too much, required plugging in, and doesn’t help if she is outside playing. I’m very happy to have a simple and effective solution to this.<br /><br />The reminder watch lets me set up to 12 alarms throughout the day, which is plenty. There is a feature that turns off all alarms, which is helpful for weekends. Then you can turn them back on again and all the alarm times you had previously set are reinstated."
4.0,I've ordered before and liked how they fit compared to many returns from other companies...it's so difficult to get sizes right on line.
4.0,Color is a little darker from picture but overall got a lot of compliments on it. Very comfortable because it has a little stretch to it.
4.0,To clingy in stomach area.
4.0,"Brief introduction: SUASI Womens Sunglasses  Reflective Thick frame Aviator<br />Features at a Glance:<br />o Aviator Frames<br />o Mirror Shine Lenses<br />o Thick rimmed Frame<br /><br />Pros:<br />o Cute Aviator Design<br />o Mirror Reflective Lenses add a little trend<br />o Come with Carrier Bag and Cleaning Wipe<br />o Thick lenses are an update to the typically waif like Aviator frames<br /><br />Cons:<br />Sadly these lenses arrived with one of the hinges loose.  They were not broken but was a little loose, nothing a little glass repair kit can’t handle. Otherwise a pretty solid pair of frames.<br />Note: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion of the products’ quality and performance.<br />My Opinion: I have always been a huge fan of the Aviator frame. When I saw these glasses took that design a step further I was excited. The thicker frame made these  glasses much sturdier than your typical Aviator frame.  I also love the Mirror reflective shine, which gives these glasses a trendy feel with the classic look.  I know these glasses will be a perfect addition to my summer fun!"
4.0,These are beautiful. They are definitely a good deal
4.0,"Very cute, but very thin material. My daughter loves it though!"
4.0,loves it- just what he wanted- took a little while to get here though
4.0,"Pros: Perfect in bust and hips, sexy<br /><br />Cons: just look at the pics! TOOOOO baggy in the tummy.<br /><br />I have many, many pieces from PB and I swear the quality and sizes have changed over the years.  I’ve ALWAYS worn a medium. What is going on with these too-loose-in-the-stomach thing is ridiculous. It looks like a pregnant woman stretched out my dress. I have since ordered a small which I’m thinking is going to be too small but may fit in the stomach. Love the style of the dress so I’m willing to try. Wish me luck!!!<br /><br />5’9” 37-28-41"
4.0,"My only complaint is the waist is not as fitted as the picture indicates, but it is still very cute and very warm!"
4.0,"Buyers should bear in mind that the Fitbit Charge 2 for which this band was designed is by now an obsolete piece of tech. If yours still works or if you can find a new one, then this band is sleek, comfortable and highly recommended. Despite what other reviewers may have observed, this should (1) not be submerged in water and (2) is not interchangeable with any other Fitbit model. Good value, looks great. Enjoy."
4.0,A little big but my face is small so it kept covering my eyes. Pretty mask!
4.0,"The watch came as expected. Brand new, super cute! However, the packaging could've been better. This was bought as a gift and the box came dented at one of the corner. It would've made the perfect gift if it was packaged better."
4.0,I liked the dress. It was for a dinner party
4.0,"BEST LEGGINGS EVER. gonna buy more in others colors. Very flattering and doesn't fall down. The band might roll a little during working out but it's not bad at all<br /><br />Update 7/18: I've bought a few more leggings in other colors (black camo and navy marl) and I've noticed their leggings are not consistent and slightly different from one another. For example, my blue ombre ones are quite big and stretchy while the black camo is very tight and restrictive( I'm scared to squat and rip them). My gray marl leggings are very squat proof while my navy marl ones are completely see through. Im sad to say I have to return some of these leggings, the navy marl leggings fit like a dream and are so cute but so so sheer, I wouldn't be able to wear them out in public"
4.0,"This is a nice nighty. It is soft and seems well made, but slightly thin. What I mean by that is I have several other night gowns that are a thicker satin, but I paid more for them and it is NOT a deal breaker. This is a nice, soft satin and doesn't feel like a costume satin like some of the other items I have purchased from Amazon. I am 5' 10&#34; and it falls just below mid thigh on me. I purchased the yellow and it is a light yellow and fits true to size. I will definitely be buying a couple of more in different colors."
4.0,Definitely order a size up. For reference: I am 5'6&#34; 115 lbs and wear a size 4 pant.  I ordered a Medium and they fit snug/just how I like them.  I normally wear a small in yoga/compression pants but definitely needed a medium in these.<br />Other than that they are super cute and very comfortable!!!  Wish I could find them in a variety of colors!
4.0,Love this dress - fits great! Has a little stretch. I wear size 8 and the medium fits like a glove. My one complaint are the flowers - they are not completely sewn on to the dress. May have to do that myself.
4.0,I hate to say this . but way too bigg. I have a huge head too . also caused me to have headaches.  not sure why till I took them off.
4.0,Cute dress but much more of a peachy yellow color than champagne. Had to return it as the color was not what I expected.
4.0,"They're quite beautiful.  Although some people here said that they received bent coins, mine were ideal in quality.  The only criticism is one of design -- maybe the coins should be a bit bigger to make them more impressive.  Otherwise, they certainly look high quality."
4.0,altho the leather is a bit soft. hopefully it will last.
4.0,"So let me start buy saying the dress is a really nice fit. It curves and falls in all the right places. Falling just to my knees, it's a flattering style and length. The sleeves are proportionate and the dress doesn't shrink when washed and dried.<br />Now.. this dress is crazy staticy. I ended up wearing a dress style girdle underneath, just to keep the dress from clinging to my butt. Also, a few strings keep falling loose, I simply cut them each time. So far it hasn't posed a threat to the construction quality of the dress.<br />I really like the dress and as long as you're not crazy picky ((seams threads come lose sometimes) then I think you will like it too!"
4.0,"Works just like described, and is as waterproof as they say. I have gone in lakes, swimming pools, rivers, washed my hands at work, etc.<br /><br />The buttons are easily pressed, so when taking gloves off, or just using my hands I sometimes bump the alarm button without realizing it and wake up rudely at 7 AM to my alarm!<br /><br />The strap is beginning to have a slight coloration after I have worn it now for 4-5 months constantly.<br /><br />Honestly, you can't go wrong with the price, if you want a fancy watch then go pay a fancy price. I like the color (I have the blue) and the size is nice. I can easily see the numbers, and the backlight is perfect (if a little short of duration)."
4.0,"VESSOS Women's Short Batwing Sleeve Striped Chiffon Spliced T Shirt Tops Blouse is just ok. The sleeves aren’t actually the batwing style and just hang loose at the side. The quality of the blouse does seem good given the price and it is wash and wear which is always a plus as taking the time to iron every morning is a hassle I try to avoid as much as possible. The style isn’t overly flattering but it is comfortable so I am content with the balance. The fabric is soft and not see-through which I have run into on other blouses I have ordered from online. I ordered a large based on the sizing chart and found it was too big and wish I would have gone with my usual medium or even a small. This isn’t my favorite blouse but it is not even close to the worst I have ever bought online. Overall it's not a bad blouse, just more plain looking once on than I would like. The size being too big may be one of the factors in my indifference to the blouse.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"I have a 41"" waist and the XL fits fine. The blue is a beautiful color. It loses one star for me because the material isn't listed and it's not cotton like the seller's other skirts. It's 60/35/5 polyester/rayon/spandex. See pic."
4.0,I wore these for work and I felt Better than before I wore these
4.0,"Ran a little big.  The arm opening drapes and I ended up having to pin it.  Very pretty, otherwise.  I got lots of compliments wearing it."
4.0,Works fine....was not able to insert all screws exactly ... but i made it fit
4.0,Very cute.  I love it as an addition to my wardrobe.
4.0,"I have been wearing compression sleeves for several years and these, by far, are the best ones I've purchased (and the cheapest)! I've bought $50 sleeves, $30 & $40 sleeves and these are the most comfortable, most durable and the most beneficial. I'll be buying more in the future too. I don't think I'll ever spend the money on &#34;better&#34; ones. In my opinion, other brands are not better, just more expensive. I'm very happy with these."
4.0,"Very cute, however it's a little big. I'm 5'9 170 and got a small"
4.0,Very nice mugs. Great size. One of the 8 came cracked.  I didn't want to have to send them back so just kept it as a set of 7.  Otherwise very pleased with the product.
4.0,"I liked the manufacturing quality and the look. Even liked the folding feature although I did not use the full fold that much. What I didn't like is that the fit gradually loosened up, to the point that they would fall off my face when I moved my head down.  One one of the drops they eventually broke.  I used them for three years, am faced with a decision - yes, will probably order a replacement pair. Looking at the broken ones, I probably could have had the frames periodically adjusted to tighten them up."
4.0,"These are exactly what I wanted for my 1 year old! I got them tried them on her, then washed them. 2 of the pom poms fell off in the washer. I removed 1 star for this reason. I was able to sew them back on so it isn't a huge deal breaker for me. However I know it might be an issue to others! My daughter loves these! And she hates bows head bands and hats! But she will wear these beanies all day long!"
4.0,RE SEW THE BUTTONS. I'm telling you. the second you graze anything even lightly they will go flying. I've been wearing these to work and they are SUPER comfortable. I wear my fro and feel like a disco diva and its great. Also the waist band hem I snapped the thread in my putting them on. the fabric stretch but the thread is not. :/
4.0,"Color is actually a dark khaki, not the light khaki as shown.  The brim is a very good size for a rain hat.  Because of the reversible nature, it is rather heavy - best for cooler rainy days."
4.0,"Ever wanna soak in a hot-tub while twirling your stache? These are the glasses for you. Ever want to lean your arms back, pop your collar, show a little chest hair, and give a sexy wink at a girl passing by? These are the glasses for you."
4.0,"In Before Times, when I was a frequent traveler, I always traveled with a wrap in my bag because we all know that planes and trains are freezing! This one would have been a good choice - it is soft and I like the reversible color scheme. Because it's heavier, it would take up more room in your bag than you may have to spare. I also felt like it fit in a gray area between scarf and shawl - it's a little too wide for a scarf but a little narrower than I'd like for a wrap or shawl. I'm not a fan of fringe but realize that's a personal choice. But overall I like it and think it would work well on a trip or in a cold office."
4.0,"This scarf is surprisingly beautiful, even more so than the photo.  It is soft and easy to wear. I find I like these types of scarves as it can be worn as a shawl."
4.0,It's very pretty but huge!
4.0,Loved this dress...fits as expected!
4.0,I like this top a lot. It's cute for going out. You can dress it up or down and for a ladies with bigger breasts you can wear it without a bra and the material is thick enough that you can wear it comfortable.
4.0,"The quality is pretty good. It fits the Huawei watch perfectly. I have large wrists, but not freakishly large. Yet the watch band barely fit without taking any links out. Also, I found the included tool to be worthless and used a small screwdriver for installation."
4.0,"Looked like good quality.  Description states that &#34;garter set included&#34;...and it's not.  That's another $20, so we returned it.  Overall price isn't bad, if you're also a smaller size.  Ordered the largest size and it was a bit smaller than a name brand corset we have of the same 36-37&#34; description."
4.0,I wanted a sanitizer dispenser to hang off my pocketbook so I wouldn't have to reach into my pocketbook.  I think this makes for a more sanitary dispenser.  I wish it held more sanitizer but I also didn't want something really bulky that was going to get in the way.<br /><br />So far the bottle is leakproof.  The holder is made of a neoprene material.  Not my favorite patterns but it's more for practicality than for looks.  Bottle sits securely in the holder though.
4.0,"The quality is impressive for the price. I had a Michael Kors watch with the same slim band and I loved it. I do not mind that there is no instructions because it's very simple to adjust it to your size, if anything a YouTube video can help you. It is true that the color of the apple watch and the band do not match but it is not as noticeable only if you focus on it too much.<br /><br />Hope this helps :)"
4.0,"Thinner and shorter than I expected, but nice."
4.0,"Super cute! Runs a tad small... But if you have a couple of extra links or a tiny neck, it's perfect!"
4.0,I was looking for a good gym bag that wasn't too big and bulky...and this is the perfect size.  My colleague saw it and ordered the same one.  It has many pockets and fits all your stuff.  I highly recommend.
4.0,These are beautiful and great quality but a bit narrow in the tie strap area.
4.0,"I LOVED this suit but was too big for me and the smallest size was a 2X, so I had to return."
4.0,"I bought a set of these in July (a slightly older version with ear slits instead of loops). They are very comfortable and easy to wear, and look good in the bandana print. However I worried that the stretch material (I think polyester/spandex?) was too thin to provide much filtering. I sewed in an inner sleeve of cotton material (think like a t-shirt sleeve) so that I have the printed, very stretchy gaiter on the outside holding an inner cotton layer to my face. I'm very happy with what I wound up with and I'd like to see the manufacturer consider dual-layer gaiters with these two different materials."
4.0,beautiful! VERY soft and nice...beautiful!! haven't used it yet...not sure when I will use but it has very pretty color and quality and feels so nice to touch!!
4.0,Really works great. I had a tiffany necklace that was tarnished and used this cloth to polish it and it looks shiny and new after. Definitely recommend. Great value.
4.0,"These boots fit rather well and are not at all uncomfortable. I know pleaser can sometimes run small, but I took a chance with these and selected my shoe size. They actually fit my feet with no issues. They look a little big around the middle, but great price and they still look great."
4.0,Nice shirt...good thickness of fabric and great quality workmanship!<br />MADE IN USA!
4.0,It doesn’t fit the face well but it was gorgeous for my wedding! You have to adjust it a lot to fit but then it hurts the ears if it’s on for longer than 30 min.
4.0,The only reason I cannot walk for more than an hour in these shoes is I am not use to heels. I wish they came in 1 -1 1/2 inch heels. I’d buy them again. I had these in red and then bought them in black. I wear them for Halloween or Christmas parties. I have a friend who walks in heels and can walk in these for 3 hours no problem.
4.0,I gave has a 🎁 gift
4.0,"I like my new Golden State Warriors headband.  I use it for running and it works great.  The colors look good.  I was expecting the logo to be bigger, but one inch is good enough."
4.0,"I returned this because it was too big. I liked it enough to try and get it in a different size, but my spouse wasn't a fan. So maybe later.<br /><br />I subtracted one star because one side of the ruffle fabric it is not the same color and texture as the other. It made the dress look cheap."
4.0,Thank you for grandson
4.0,Absolutely loved it! Fit as expected and good quality. Got many compliments!
4.0,"I ordered the xl, and it was a little baggy around the stomach, but for the most part it fit good."
4.0,This mask is perfect for those Dr. Fauci fans! It was a fun gift for a special party. Best if double masks is used.
4.0,Very nice heavy shirt. Tight around the shoulders. Not a linebacker but makes me feel like i am
4.0,"Length was a little long, but I’m shorter (5’5”) but I just rolled them up a bit it and it was fine. It is see through, but I cut the tag out and wore with a nude thong and it was fine, you couldn’t see through to me butt or anything like that, but I was hoping for thicker fabric"
4.0,"These run very large. I normally take an XL, so I ordered a large because Alfred Dunner runs big. The large is too big too."
4.0,"My husband works with concrete & jack hammers. He likes that he could change out the band's to clean inside them after work, the 3 color option for the price, & the design. He disliked that the outer ring stretched quickly. He wears a size 10 wedding band & that's what we bought but we would reorder a size 9.5 if available."
4.0,"First, these pants are sized pretty small, so if you're on the edge of sizes, order a larger size. I'm 6'2"" 200lbs, and I normally wear Large or Large-Tall.. In these pants, I need XL, because the Large pants are ridiculously short and a little too slim.<br /><br />The pants are well made, and feel great. I bought them because I want a lightweight pair of sweats. (I get hot, so typical sweats are way too warm and heavy) They fit this bill.<br /><br />The hip pockets are ridiculously shallow, and suitable only for resting your hands occasionally. My cellphone is not even close to fitting, neither will my wallet, and I wouldn't put car keys in the top pocket for fear they would slip out if I sat down. Which means everything has to go in the cargo pockets. This is probably better for the look of the pants, because the thin fabric would show ugly bulges if you put anything in the top pockets, however, it's a bit atypical. I wish the top pockets were deeper."
4.0,The picture quality is great but the pendant on he necklace looks cheaply made . Over all it's still really pretty
4.0,"Fit well, but very thin fabric."
4.0,"Soft, overall breathable material. Sweat dries quickly. Prone to wrinkles.<br />I got a M; 5'2.5, 130lbs. Professional, not exceptionally form fitting shirt. Has a silky appearance."
4.0,This is a nice satchel.  The color seems a little darker than than the picture but I like the style of it.  I would love it if it were just a little bigger.
4.0,This is so adorable. Many people ask me if this is kate spade. The only reason I took 1 star off is that the way it is attched to the key chain looks like it will not hold up very long. However for the money it's great.
4.0,"I bought it in beige and used it for a day wedding and it was very nice .  It has a strong clip it could be firmly attached to my hairdo by the stylist but he has tu use additions pins to put it in that right position , the pins kind of ruin the fabric and I don’t think I can use it again but for the price it was more than ok"
4.0,just as pictured and cute packaging
4.0,its very comfortable and really warm
4.0,"This is well weighted, comfortable."
4.0,"I purchased these keychains for our new apartment and within a week, one of the keychains had fallen off.  The keychain had only 1 key and 1 car key on it and were usually kept in the car dash or on a desk - not roughly tumbled around.  To reiterate the other reviewer, they're nice and feel very solid but the rings tend to open easily so you might lose the hexagon."
4.0,Pants fit and the hoodie did not
4.0,"If you’re looking for a sporty look, this one is it. Size wise, I bought a medium based on 5’3” and 130 lb (I have wide hips and a big butt; however, my breasts are small-b cup). The size fit well. The top seemed a little loose but then it was fine after making some adjustments on the straps. The top did seem to have some slight stitching issues, but it isn’t very noticeable while on. I wore this for my beach honeymoon vacation and it did well during the pool and a long walk on the beach"
4.0,Runs a size small but is still super cute!
4.0,"Nice band, leather could be more supple."
4.0,"Im 5’5 165lbs and got a large,it was a little loose in the waist but still cute"
4.0,A little small.. shirt is more fitted than expected.
4.0,"Very solid material, although it is a bit bulky for a keychain, but that's personal preference."
4.0,"The 2X Plus size fits a size 18-20 (bra size 42G). The bodice closes all the way.  The skirt is incredibly long, so it does require hemming, but that also means you can order it without worrying that it'll end up being too short.  I appreciate this very much, because I'm 5'11&#34; and lots of skirts are made too short for me.  Also, you can run some vertical stitches up the skirt and gather it up to the correct length, for a piratey ruched look.  Either way, the skirt probably won't work for anyone as-is  You're going to need to sew a bit.  Personally, I like the flexibility - you can take something in or up pretty easily, but it's a lot harder to add material if a seller scrimps on the length.<br /><br />The thing I like the least about this costume is the under-shirt.  Firstly, it's not a chemise, it only goes to the waist.  It's made out of a poly-cotton blend that is somewhat scratchy and uncomfortable.  On the plus side, it'll probably stay white because it's so synthetic, no stain will stick to it. If you just need a one-time costume for a party or something, the shirt is fine.  However, if you're going to be spending a lot of time in garb for medieval recreation or LARPing, you'll get itchy & you'll want a better undergarment.  The workmanship of the bodice is worth the price of the whole ensemble, in my opinion, so it's still money well-spent, even though the shirt is sort of a throw-away.<br /><br />The other materials seem to have a higher cotton content, so they're more comfortable.  The skirt material is a lightweight broadcloth, so if it's at all chilly, you're going to want some kind of under-skirt.  I'd just plan to replace the included under-shirt with an actual full-length chemise, made from a softer fabric and you'll be good to go.<br /><br />I recommend this outfit, especially for tall people, and I would order more of these if they made colors without fleur-de-lis. Overall, I'm quite happy with the purchase."
4.0,"Well made, soft leather, nice to look at and well constructed. Great color, really like it, wish it were little larger ."
4.0,"I typically wear a small or medium in tops depending on the stretch of the fabric. I sized up for this and ordered a large and it fit perfectly. The tweaks I mentioned are simple, just a few pieces of double sided garment tape under the chiffon panels to hold them in place and you good to go!"
4.0,"The stones are very nice, but if you have large wrists it may be tight."
4.0,"Good sizing fit as expected,love the color ."
4.0,"Paint chips off after a while, turn your finger green after a while. Wish it was just a black I'm cute. Love the weight and the fit if they could just figure out how to keep the paint from chipping"
4.0,Granddaughter loves the wig but says it's a little itchy. Didn't take long for the top layer hair to get frizzy.
4.0,"fabric is a little rough, but good shirt."
4.0,Very nice case. Seemed durable and offered plenty of protection for my 10yr old daughters eyeglasses. Although I did think it would’ve been a brighter more neon color pink.  She loves anything pink. I guess maybe I did not look at the picture close enough. Still a fine product.
4.0,Good product for the price. Fit as expected. I recommend the product to someone who wants an affordable suits for a graduation or first communion.
4.0,"I was assuming it was going to be 100%...it's not.  It's 100% polyester.  Additionally, get your lint roller ready...you will need it.  I usually want let anything polyester touch me, but this robe is warm and comfortable, if you remove the tag at the neck."
4.0,"They are a bit short but I still love these shoes, and I got lots of compliments on them!"
4.0,definitely get a size down as the hip area is wide unless you have ample hips.
4.0,good quality but I think just a little too long & tight on my leg.
4.0,Everything was good but it smelled like medicine
4.0,"It's as pretty as it looks in the picture. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the material feels kinda cheap... Doesn't look cheap tho so as long as nobody touches it I should be fine haha it's great for the price.<br />Ps: totally came in more packaging don't worry, i was just so excited I opened it as soon as I got it 😂"
4.0,This is an excellent product that performs as described.  I use it on the otherwise iffy shoulder straps<br />of my LeSportsac bags.  The only reason that I did not indicate 5 stars is that it is a bit pricey for jusr<br />a strap pad.
4.0,"I think this is a very pretty dress.  My daughter is turning two next week and I ordered the 2/3.  It was enormous on her, too long and too wide.  I wish it came in 18 months.  I will save it for her and hopefully it will fit next year.  It definitely needs to be steamed but if you are looking for a poofy, full skirt, this is perfect."
4.0,"The dress is gorgeous and the material is nice, however it was too loose around the chest and waist area. I am 5'1 and 120 pounds and got an XS. The length was perfect with heels"
4.0,"These are nice, fits my pregnant body."
4.0,"I loved the Necklace Bigger than I expected ,But there was some Kind of glue All over the Crystals I had to really RUB to get it off and I wore IT tonight . But still never got all the glue Off of it . Will take it off the Discolored Chain and wear it on a Choker WIRE ."
4.0,"It's a doo-rag. Nothing special. Thin fabric, not real denim. The seams on mine was crooked, making the flag off center. But not enough to return. For the price, I wouldn't buy again."
4.0,it is lovely if you like large jewelry
4.0,"It is cool, but a little bulkier than we like. I wish I would have gotten the clear bands as well... But good product!"
4.0,Nice boot. Purchased siZe too large
4.0,"This bra is EXTREMELY comfortable. It has alot more give than I am normally used to. Big ""C"" cup and above ladies will love the way it feels and then if they are like me (slightly obcessed with keeping their girls up high) they will worry that there isn't enough support. I would recommend this as the bra you put on with your sweats or jammies when you come home after work. It's so comfortable and soft, like little pillows for tired breasts."
4.0,The color is great.  Love the material. The material is soft and silky. It is great for the warm summer months.
4.0,It’s beautiful I loved it but I didn’t give it a five star because my daughter wears 6-6x and that’s the size I ordered her and it was a bit tight.
4.0,"It has pockets!! The green color is pretty and flattering. For me, it ran it a little big I ordered a medium and it was too big, but a small fits perfectly."
4.0,Dress is the shade of red that I was looking for - a true Christmas type red - and the style is flattering.  I have received many compliments.  Most would want to wear a shaper under this.
4.0,"Nice bag, perfect size to take for overnight.  I gave it to my grandson to use as his weekend camping bag, or overnights at grammys.  I love the color, more of an apricot than orange.  Also, the shoulder strap is detachable if you don't want to use it.  All in all it's a nice attractive, light weight bag."
4.0,"Great fit and really a cute outfit, as we had a transportation theme. The tie did fall apart pretty quickly but we were able to put it back together. Overall cute outfit."
4.0,"I really like this bathing suit.  Of course, the quality isn't one of a $150 suit, BUT its still very good looking and sexy.  I have a 36 DD chest.  I have side cleavage, which I really don't care about, but if it bothers you, don't get this!!  I would prefer more support for the breasts and the pads do nothing, but its a swimsuit, not a bra.  It fits great in the butt. and front area.  The tie backs help to adjust the chest area.  I think the design is better in person.  I do feel like I'm wearing a bikini, but at least I have some coverage, which is the best of both worlds!"
4.0,"I like the dress a lot. It's nice material and not too thin. The flowers are beautiful in color and look just like the pictures. I give it a 4 star because I ordered it in pink and received white. I was torn between the two colors before ordering, so  I'll keep it instead of returning it because the white is beautiful too."
4.0,Pretty. Need a tank top underneath
4.0,"Cute and what I was wanting, but it is a little large on me. I am a 36 B and needed it a little tighter around the back.  I will probably make some adjustments to the strap to make it fit around my bust more snug.  It has a clasp like a bathing suit would so it is easy to take off and put on.  I was expecting to have to pull it on over my head and have to try and weave my way through all the caging, but nope! simple back closure makes it so much easier.  I have not had any issues with the caging coming apart, but I have only worn it a few times.  Since it is a little larger, it doesn't have to stretch much so I am guessing it will snap if you put too much tension on the straps... Overall, it is cute and I get compliments on it!"
4.0,"El detalle está muy bien y la calidad, solo que la gema tiene la mitad clara y la otra mitad oscura. Yo la quería oscura completa"
4.0,The kids will love this and so will their mom and dad for safety<br /> The lights last a long time I only wish that hey flashed
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:daa9d0a27fe9acbc1b77ed1075526f54]] [[VIDEOID:3e48501ae539666dc2479fe92cb7e1ba]] [[VIDEOID:92a6fefeb7576ee4815d8dee11815e92]] This Lingerie Mini Dress I ordered in the Purple in a size Large for my daughter but I should have probably ordered her the XL. According to the size chart, this should have fit for her size but unfortunately it was a bit small. With that being said, I am removing a star for the sizing issue. Now while she was able to get this on, it was too snug for her around her stomach and mid-section. Her breasts fit ok and the length was what I believe it was supposed to be even though she is a taller girl standing at 5’ 9” tall. We all know that us women are all different shapes and carry our weight differently. My daughter normally wears a size Large (or a 12-14) but this didn’t work for her. On the hand, depending on someone else is proportioned, it may work for them. I however would personally recommend ordering a size up. With something like this, it couldn’t hurt.<br /><br />As for the material and the mini dress lingerie itself, it’s super pretty and the rose pattern in the lace is adorable. The “straps” even though this says strapless, are lace and can be worn as straps or worn down further on the arms and not on the shoulders. It just depends what you feel you like and looks nice. There is a little bit of elasticity in the straps. There is not much stretch in the lace to the dress part though. I also do want to mention, the color in the stock photo is more true to the color you get than what my video is showing. I’m not sure why my video is making it look more like a light lavender/lilac color but it is almost more of a pinkish color like the stock photo.<br /><br />I checked this over very well and did not find any holes or flaws in the lace at all. I have purchased similar items before and sometimes there is a hole in the lace but nothing found with this one. This comes with a G-string/thong type panty also to wear underneath. Now that did fit my daughter as expected. There is a cute satin bow that is attached in the center of the breast area with an “peep hole” which I think really adds to this and makes it real sexy to see the cleavage there. Wearing this for your man will definitely grab his attention.<br />I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review."
4.0,Estan buenos
4.0,Love it and it shipped fast.
4.0,The size of the ears and ring width is much larger than expected. Fits well around the finger but it is not something I would recommend to wear casually due to the size.
4.0,"Only tried for a little bit, but it seems to work as advertised."
4.0,"I've ordered several of these yoga pants in black and love them.  I am 5'11&#34; with a 36 inch inseam and these are the best yoga pants out there that will fit.  They fold down and sit nice at the waist.  I've also ordered one pair in grey and one (maybe two) in white.  The fit and material varies between colors.  Black is my standard, good length and best material.  I hardly wear the gray pair, the material is stiffer, the feel a bit tighter and they are a tad too short.  The white ones I wear for Kundalini yoga, it is nearly impossible to find white yoga pants at all, much less long enough.  The fabric is thinner and softer than the black and wears through (not stitching just the cloth) quicker.  I work at home and wear the black ones regularly in the winter (in the NW), so this could be the issue, but I do tend to order a new pair a couple times per year as the stitching in the thighs wears out and rips open eventually."
4.0,It has static really bad. The top is pretty and fit is great.
4.0,Cheap material but looks nice
4.0,Good but runs a size larger
4.0,"I ordered this in the green color for a masquerade ball, and after ordering the medium initially (based on the sizing recommendations), decided that I wanted to try a small instead.  The small fit better around the chest area, as the medium was loose and gaped open, while the small fit much better.  I will say that while the small fits around the waist and hips, the inside liner was definitely tighter and shorter and I'm not sure how it will be to wear for an evening, especially while dancing.  The style and color is really great and the fabric is nice and thick, hiding any imperfections which I appreciate.  It does stretch a bit, so if you're debating sizes, I would size down, especially if you're smaller in the chest.  The length was good for me.  For reference, I am 5' 3 1/2"", 125 lbs and 32C bust, and carry most of my weight in my bottom half."
4.0,"I bought this to replace my husband's last wallet.  The previous one grew very loose and his cards kept falling out.<br />The first month or so the cards were hard to get out, but now it's great, no more stuck or sliding out cards."
4.0,"This is a lovely, light-weight cotton dress for a young girl.  It will be nice to wear in warmer weather.  The pastel colors look wonderful together and it will make a great casual dress for any young girl to wear."
4.0,"Don't think I would necessarily buy these for a gift. They don't wow right from the box and the backs look a little cheap. Look fine on though, price point is low."
4.0,I like the earrings how ever I have some the same size and shape. I will keep them incase I lose one of the others.
4.0,"Love these pajamas. Stretchy, soft and comfortable. My son loves them."
4.0,My favorite socks for the hospital and running thick on the bottom and light and breathable on the top. The best. 4-stars just for expense. My wife freaks out every time I spend 50+ just on a few pairs of  SOCKS!
4.0,I like these glasses very much for iPad work.  They are very clear and comfortable. A little too big for my face but that does not affect their function.
4.0,I loved the fit - had to get this hemmed as I am 5’1 and it went a little past my knee. Otherwise looked great for my Christmas party and would recommend.
4.0,I tried it on and hated it. Then before I did a review I realized I forgot to move the shoulder part over. Now I see it’s good. It’s running a little large tho. I’ll get another one in a different color a size smaller.
4.0,"Nice watch, but needed something a little bit more contrasty when it came to the face of the watch and the hourly markings. I thought the fact difficult to read. It's a nice watch, however, so gave it four-stars."
4.0,fits well and is warm
4.0,Nice shorts but they run small
4.0,"It fit my bag exactly perfectly. I have what I think is a medium size and it fit. It is meant to be an inside lining, so it does not need to be highly durable. It suits my purpose as it adds extra pockets."
4.0,Wish fabric was alittle heavier but over all my boys loved it
4.0,"I really like the corseted back, but I had no idea it would be SO short.  I'm 5'4&#34;, and it stops at the top of my thigh.  Absolutely have to wear leggings under this."
4.0,Love the ear rings but they pinch - have had to remove the hinge.
4.0,"classic style and comfortable<br />remind me of my must have office attire in the 90's<br /><br />sizing is spot on 4me, bought 7m<br />am wearing 6.5 - 7 medium in this kind of shoes style"
4.0,Doesn't make me itch.
4.0,"I really love the quote and design on this tank top. I actually purchased this as a gift for a friend, and I am really hoping it will fit. I ordered a large, but the actual shirt to me does not look like a large. It looks more like a medium or even a small. It is wide enough, but very short. We will see, hopefully it works!"
4.0,"As a grandma to 6 beautiful grandchildren, I cannot imagine any grandmother who would not be thrilled with any gift a grandchild gives her!  That being said. I think this bracelet is a lovely and touching gift. It comes with a nice card explaining the attributes of the bracelet and of a grandmother. I found it comfortable to wear and it is adjustable. This bracelet is a unique and thoughtful gift for a grandmother."
4.0,Wife really likes this because of its unique design.
4.0,"Nice and soft, wicking and a good fit. But they do start fuzzing and balling after the first use. However, of the three brands I bought, it is the only brand that I went back to buy more."
4.0,Comfortable with ear plugs. Does the job!
4.0,Good quality but I had to get a size bigger than I do in other brands.
4.0,"This summery, flowy shirt is just right for summer. It's 75% polyester and 25% cotton, so it breathes and has a nice feel against the skin.<br /><br />The henley collar is cute with nice stitching and buttons, the sleeves and shirt itself are loose and breezy. It's perfect with jeans or shorts on a summer day.<br /><br />It washes and dries just fine in a regular load, without shrinking."
4.0,It’s great and fits as expected. It’s thinner than I anticipated but still warm.
4.0,"Nice look but heavy on my nose and bigger oval than I wanted. Too big on my small face.<br />Update: Go figure...<br />I saved these since I do like the look.<br />After relocation to AZ, the bigger oval and deep dark tint have saved these Oregon eyes.<br />So worth the wait..."
4.0,I haven’t had them long enough to comment on durability but they seem strong. I wish they folded differently so you didn’t have to take the base out to store them flat.
4.0,The tightening band isn't the right material for it to stay tight so it will get loose and come off of u don't tie the end after you tighten it. Other then that I Love them!
4.0,The cutest “chanclas” ever. My niece love them. The only problem is that after a few times wearing them the elastic band in the back is not as tight as it used to be. It can be difficult for little girls(my niece is 3 years old)
4.0,"The fabric is not what I expected, it's slightly thin and slinky feeling, which is not a bad thing. Just wasnt expected."
4.0,"I like this for some of my solid dresses. I can tell its not the greatest quality, but serves a purpose."
4.0,Gorgeous earrings!  They would get a five but a little on the heavy side.
4.0,"I'm 5'3&#34; ~120lbs and this fit me pretty well. Sleeves were a good length and not too tight which seems to be a common problem. The fabric is also super soft and warm. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because it is slightly different than pictured which is to be expected w/ the price. Differences I've noticed are really in the material (which is still a decent weight) and color, slightly more blue in person."
4.0,"I'm not a fan of the cut but it seems like a good, quality tank. Definitely need to order a size or two larger."
4.0,Nice looking and you are able to shorten the clasp so that it fits your wrist.
4.0,"Needed a set of sunglasses that lived in my car. Got these and they have been great. Lightweight and dark. No regrets, and also they don’t back the bank if I accidentally lose them"
4.0,"The top fit fine; if anything, the bottoms were 1"" too tight. I'm 5'2"" 110lbs 36B, got a small. Colour not as shiny as expected."
4.0,Great teacher gift!
4.0,"The description and photos are quite accurate... Having just used these for a 5-day bike trip, they worked fine... The only improvement I'd offer is this:  You can see that there are 'tabs' on 2 of the 4 fingers that are quite helpful in pulling the gloves off... It would be better if these were added to the other 2 fingers and the thumb"
4.0,"Order a size up—it shrinks 3-4 inches when washed, as happens with cheaper polyester.  However, that does mean it is soft and lightweight.  Cute fit and airy in the south."
4.0,I thought it was a great Valintine gift but my bride didn't like the fit it looked good to me
4.0,This was a beautiful dress but the size was large. Great quality material.
4.0,"Pretty rings but not real silver. Though I can't fathom why people here are basing this determination on the presence of tarnish. Real silver definitely DOES tarnish. These, however, fade. This indicates that they're in fact NOT real silver. But for $3, I'm certainly not complaining."
4.0,"I love this set!  I don't have any turquoise jewelry as it's not my favorite stone but I had to try this set because I love butterflies.  The chain that comes with the necklace is not my taste  but I wore the set anyway and I really like it.  I will probably change out the chain at some point but I've worn the set twice so far and have gotten many compliments.  The earrings are bigger than what I expected but that's ok because it goes well with the pendant on the necklace.  Yes it's costume jewelry but for the price, I didn't mind.  Shipping is slow but came much sooner than I expected.  Overall, I'm happy with this purchase and would have given a 5 star rating but I wasn't impressed with the necklace chain."
4.0,The dress is beautiful and fit like it should in the true to size sizing. The problem is the deep v neck dip. It goes all the way down past the breasts and is so wide that you can see more of your breasts than I like and your bra is showing too. I am not sure if I can wear this dress without being very self conscious.
4.0,"Under Armour runs a bit smaller than other brands, but we knew that going in so I ordered up a 1/2 size. My daughter loves these basketball shoes, The last UA bball shoes we had held up for 2 yrs of play and then handed down to lil sis.  I hope these last just as long!"
4.0,"The bag does what is intended.  Fits under allegiant seats and holds about two days worth of stuff for me. That includes regular clothing, running clothes, shoes, pjs, toiletries, snacks, chargers, and tablet.  While I like the large zipper opening when packing, it is not very practical when on the plane.  I really wish there was a zipper that went across the top for easier access.  And I do wish there was a water bottle pouch.  Those are minor preferences.  Bag seems durable.  Been on two trips so far and everything still like new."
4.0,unusual shape
4.0,"I have had this watch for 7 or 8 years.  I wear it as my normal &#34;day&#34; watch for all activities...everything from fishing to swimming to shooting to flying and working on my airplane.  If I'm doing yard work, household repair work, hammering, plumbing, whatever....this watch is on my wrist.  It takes a total beating and has never ONCE failed or cost me a single penny except for when I have to change the battery every couple of years.  The bezel is scratched and dented here and there, but the crystal is absolutely perfect (I can't believe it considering what this watch goes through).  The stainless band is in excellent shape as well.  It is easy to read, offers great utility and is very accurate.<br /><br />I have a Breitling Navitimer World which is a beautiful watch.  I wear it for &#34;going out&#34; and for work (office job).  I love it but doesn't hold a candle to the Chase Durer for utility and functionality...one factory overhaul of the Breitling (recommended what...every 5 years at $750 +/-) will make you a Chase Durer believer.<br /><br />I would give the Fighter Command an easy 5-star rating...but I do think the styling could be improved somewhat without impacting the functionality.  The watch looks great (better in person than in pictures) but not as stylish as say, well....the Navitimer.  I guess that is why the Navitimer costs 10x the Fighter Command?<br /><br />For me, the Fighter Command has been a great watch and I recommend it!"
4.0,"I ordered this to match a dress my nearly two year old owns and have received compliments on it when wearing it separately from her.  The style is cute, but somewhat loose.  I ordered a Large and am a size 14 (although sometimes 12 or 16 depending on the brand-- 5 foot 6, 200 lbs), with most of my weight being in my arms, breasts, hips and butt, although I have a bit of a post-mommy belly and altogether, it looks good.  I feel the need to wear a cardigan with it to cover up my profile however, as while straight on, I look busty and cute, if I turn sideways, it looks like I have more of a stomach than I do due to where the striped pattern falls and the red skirt begins.  I'm not sure that I love it, but I like it-- it serves its purpose of matching my daughter and is okay for work since it covers my cleavage (curvy girls, you know what I'm talking about).  But I am buying it again because I made the mistake of washing it in hot water, which turned the white part pink (and every other white thing pink in my wash), which is unfortunate.  Many of us who have had to deal with bed bugs in the past have a habit of washing things in hot water moving forward but you can't do that with this dress.  So if you are worried about preventing or getting rid of bed bugs and you want this dress, you may want to invest in a heat box or a freezer that can continuously maintain 0 degrees Farenheit for four days or more (and make sure you have room to store the dress there).  Fortunately we have a separate deep freezer that does this and my electronic freezer thermometer has confirmed it can maintain 0 degrees nonstop, so this is not an issue.  I will just spot clean, dry clean or clean the new dress I order in cold water moving forward (and throw it in the freezer for four days if our kids' daycare has another bed bug outbreak after collecting the kids). I hope this helps!"
4.0,top tends to roll down
4.0,Fits ok!
4.0,Nice gift for a nine year old girl.
4.0,Did not gave a 5 star because it's a bit long. Bought the dress for a friend. She had seeing it asked if I buy it for her. She love it.
4.0,No me agrado el brazalete es muy básico débil
4.0,The robe is a bit roomy but that's what I expected from a &#34;one size fits all&#34; robe (I'm a size 6).  I just use the belt to tie it to fit and it's fine.  The waffle material keeps it from clinging unattractively to the body when wet. It is light and fairly thin which is what I wanted but not so thin that it's see through in the white color I ordered.  The short length is exactly what I wanted for warm summer days getting ready after a shower or at the gym for walking to/from the outdoor pool and jacuzzi.
4.0,Every day wear.  Would like to see the pieces that the stapes run through a little heaver.  They are really cute.
4.0,Comfortable but the stitching comes apart easily and starts to my long starts to run.
4.0,I like this but it's not as fitted as I wanted. Mostly through the lower area. It flares slightly so I'm going to have it taken in I a little.
4.0,"I purchased the olive green.  Not real fond of the how the buttons lay, almost be better if there just weren't any.  They're so small spaced so far apart, they seem awkward to me, but I'm gonna get passed that.  The olive isn't see through, I like that, it's good weight, not light, so if you want something really cool, this isn't thin.  It's a keeper"
4.0,"Request to producer: make an extra long/extra tall version, please.<br /><br />Seriously LOVE these pants. So soft, very light for summer, they are at least partially natural fabric so great for current skin sensitivities, and stretchy.<br />I little thin so I'm trying not to be self-conscious about bumps that show through, but they are such comfortable maternity pants. They will probably be stretched out to pajama-only size by the end of this, but I will probably buy a replacement pair once I'm back to regular body shape.<br />They are just a little short so I don't put them thru the dryer - allow to hang dry hoping to stretch for a bit more length. (I'm 5'10). They can be long enough if you don't mind wearing the crotch really low, but that looks weird on my body."
4.0,"The skirt is pretty and well made, only complaint is that the under liner isn’t very lose and it’s a bit stiff so it doesn’t flow like the rest of the skirt so when sitting it looks like two separate pieces. Will do fine for my newborn photo shoot when my baby is born. I’m 6 months pregnant, 5ft 3 and 165 pounds in the pic wearing a medium"
4.0,"So far I like them.  They fit.  Boots are not too heavy. I was going to list the size I bought and my boot size etc., but don't remember what I bought and Amazon can't tell me.  So the waders get 4 stars until I can actually use them, after which I will update this review, but Amazon gets 1 star for not keeping the information.<br />Update.  Went surf fishing and the waders kept me warm and dry.  The boots did compress from the weight of the water, but I just walked slowly and kicked my heels to the back of the boot and my toes didn't get squashed."
4.0,Good quality skirt. I first ordered a size L and was way too big if i kost weight it would just fall off my body. I reordered size M and it fits OK since it has stretch. But the button hole areas are stretched out too and your skin might show through the gaps between each button. I will keep it but there is too much discrepancies between size M and L
4.0,"A little snug, but super cute!"
4.0,Wore this for a bachelorette in Nashville that I attended and loved it. You'll just have to wear nude underwear and sticky bra works best!
4.0,Fun way to wear owls.
4.0,Great shoe! Order a size up
4.0,Surpringly nice looking necklace.  Good to give as gifts as I intend to do.
4.0,A little hard to get on but my daughter loves to help cook and they keep her clean.
4.0,"I’m 5’1 and got an XS and the dress itself is such a nice fabric and is so flattering! Not sheer at all, well made and so comfy but the slit comes up SO high. Good for clubs or a bachelorette party but not a wedding guest dress!"
4.0,fit as expected except lower arm opening was a little tight. Hope it stretches a bit after a wash.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:c083c1e3bca8f753fe6afe0171ed17fe]] For something I bought back in 2019 it was about 7$. I wanted a multi color ring and it's just that, package is nothing special they wrap it in plastic, put it in a bag (don't know the material) and put it inside a fancy box inside a package (like most jewelry)<br /><br />The ring came in the right size I requested (which other sellers for some reason have a problem doing )<br /><br />After using it daily for at least a year and a half and just having it as an accessory to occasionally outfits (I started wearing more black and chrome things) it never turned green, faded or corroded after wearing it in the shower a bunch of times. So I can say this is a reliable ring which I can confirm now<br /><br />As for shipping, Amazon doesn't ship this so you could be waiting up to a week or two which is the only downside<br /><br />Other than that if this fits what you're looking appearance wise, I say get it! If you're patient or course:)"
4.0,The pockets are great and it fits as expected. I'm 5'2&#34; and it's a little long. Overall a good buy. I will be buying another one in a different pattern.
4.0,"Bought it for my 9year Old niece, it was perfect material and size for her!"
4.0,I can't change the day. The button is stuck.
4.0,I like that the mask is cool looking & glows in the dark.
4.0,"It's a little loose in the chest region. I'm a 32C and the fit had some gapping. There are no darts in the cups, so the fit would be great on petite chests."
4.0,I like the way they connect into the glasses...it allows for different widths of ear pieces...but they are too bulky for me...not as streamline as I’d hoped. Also the string might not be long enough if you use them in winter with bulky clothes and bulky necklines.
4.0,Good quality. Too long on my average torso. Had to return.
4.0,It is very soft and comfortable. It is little bit tight on thigh area. It doesn’t stretch. The material is soft.
4.0,I ordered this a size up and it was perfect! The material was a little scratchy but a great dress for a great price!
4.0,The only complaint I had about this wallet was that I had to really dig into it in order to grab bills within it.  I used it as my international travel wallet.  It would be nice if there was a tiny external pocket or something.
4.0,We use his as a costume for our family game night. We enjoy using it and have lots of laughs when someone puts it on when it is their turn to use it
4.0,So I got the set the chain and bracelet the chain was nice and looks great but I ordered the set and didn’t get the bracelet
4.0,Get a size bigger<br />I'm 5 feet and 120lbs small chest and a small was extreamly tight on me
4.0,"Don't expect to be able to do anything with your hands, like pick things up. They look cool though."
4.0,"Not crazy about the 3 hooks but it fits well, looks good and is VERY comfy!"
4.0,The small was bigger/not as tight as I would have liked.
4.0,Lovely black flows dress
4.0,"They look just like the photos. A little high of a heel though. I am already pretty tall so these make me taller than my boyfriend. I recommend some form of support with them, my toes keep sliding down and it can hurt if you're walking a lot."
4.0,"The watch looks great, I like it even more in person! It’s comfortable even though my wrist is on the smaller side and boney. Every now and then one of the lug corners might dig in a little bit, easy to readjust and be comfy again. The case is also super light, (like Casio MQ243B light) so you don’t have to wear it tight at all to keep it where you want on your wrist. It’s definitely a watch you could forget you have on, the rounded raised bumpers near the face and relative thinness mean most jackets and long sleeve shirts don’t get stuck an bunch up over the watch either. The strap continues to get softer and more and more comfortable, although does have some quite sharp edges still around the keeper. Again, mostly something that can be worked around by just readjusting the case position on the strap, but definitely something I notice and have to work around. I haven’t tried any softening yet, a hand wash or maybe a little super fine sand paper might be able to take care of those few sharp bits. The case it’s self being the material and construction method it is ends up with a few… not white ‘sharp’ but certainly ‘precise’ edges. Again generally though they’re never felt. Not an issue at all.<br /><br />I love the white face, I could have gone with a DX3 with black face and white hands, but I wanted this one. In the day time it’s perfectly fine to read. In darkness the lume holds up well and is generally easy to read as well, even the hour markers. In dim settings however, the watch is very hard to read if the line isn’t freshly charged and glowing bright. When too dim for lume to stand out, and bright enough you’d be able to see hands with more black on them, these lumed hands are hard to pick out against the white background. My old Casio MQ342B had a white face but all black hands that gave enough contrast in low light/dim to make it easy. I think they tried to balance lume on the hands and black outlines but the end result is occasionally hard to tel time that makes me stop and adjust my eyes or find a bit of brighter light.<br />Cloudy nights with streetlights on are about the dimness levels that are often hard to read on this watch.<br /><br />The lume holds up pretty well all night! It also picks up a charge pretty easy. Having a light on in a room and going to a dark setting I can even pick out the hour markers quite easily. The 12 o’clock marker is a triangle rather than the other squares, but the markers are so small you’d never see the shape difference in the dark with the lume. Under a UV light, strangely the hands are definitely a blue lume and the hour markers are a green. I’m not sure what this means, but it seems to suggest the hands and hour markers and second hand are a different brand or color of lume. The hour markers/second hand are much smaller, they may require a more active lume to keep up with the hands. In bright sunlight the blue lume changes the hand tint just enough to make it stand out against the face a little which is an added bonus. Overall the lume picks up charge easy, holds it pretty well over night, and is definitely brighter/easier to charge than my timex for sure. Not sure it’s quite lumi-bright levels of performance but it’s not a fair comparison either. My seiko had massive applications of lume and these are much smaller surface areas. Long story short, should get you through the night no problem!<br /><br />Bonus, the strap is 20mm width and pretty comfy! I swap l it straps between this and my seiko and love the style/comfort variety. Remember this does not have spring bars though — pass through straps only if that matters to you.<br /><br />For $75, I’m not really sure it’s value packed if you look just at the watch spec sheet or the hard to read in dim settings. If you look at their strap prices to add this canvas to your collection, figure this is a solid sturdy, light and comfy best up watch I can see how they priced it as they did. Personally with my budget - I’d wait to find it on sale. I’m quite happy with this at $55. For $65 knows my I could use the strap on other watches I think I’d probably be just as happy."
4.0,"Comfortable while driving, walking or biking. And can't go wrong for a nice pair of polarized glasses for the price."
4.0,Fits a little large then I expected
4.0,"Lightweight to wear with shorts for around the yard. Comfortable, and cute design."
4.0,"Update. I’ve added a star. The large size fits much better and is more comfy on the waist and back side. Customer support is very good and responsive.<br /><br />Nice looking leggings. I’m 160lb and wear a size 10 in pants and I’m about 5’3”, curvy. I listened to the other reviews and ordered a size down (medium) from my normal size (large). It was very snug and flattened my butt in an unflattering way. Also, felt like the crotch was short so the the leggings wore lower in the back and not so much high waist. Otherwise, no camel toe and they are compressive but didn’t look great on me."
4.0,The produce was very good !
4.0,"Pros:<br />-cute and look just as pictured<br />-well made<br />-soft material for side and nice sturdy sole<br />Could Use Improvement:<br />-these run really big<br /><br />The moccasin sandals are absolutely adorable- there is no denying that, BUT THEY RUN REALLY BIG. this is the third or fourth pair of moccasins I have ordered from Amazon and all of them have the same large sizing. Mind you my daughter have very small feet for her age and height... But the 0-6 month sizing or 110 is comparable to a size 12momth shout at old navy.<br /><br />For these cost these are very well made. The material that touches the babies food is so soft and I like the bottom is sturdy but not rock hard- it is perfect for a baby learning to walk. I just wish the sizing on these didn't run so large. My daughter will have at least a few more months before she can wear the newborn size- & she is 6 months old.<br /><br />Review by P. Thomas- I received this product for a discount. This is my honest opinion of the item and is not influenced by any discount. I don't  give good reviews just because I received an hour a discount- you can look on my reviewer page to see I give a wide range of 1-5  star reviews.  I am NOT paid to leave reviews. Thank you!"
4.0,"They are great, the only reason why I didnt keep them is that I looked bad in these. My body isnt for it, but otherwise if you know you look good in these type of pants- that would be a good buy. Quality is pretty nice.<br />I wished I looked better, but well, life ;)"
4.0,I love the softness it is a good buy. I wore it in the hospital and it was warm to be a light fabric
4.0,"Nice quality, but the hat shape is something I'm personally not fond of."
4.0,The material was not what I expected its a bit shiny and feels like spandex. I was looking for a cotton dress but it fits nice. You can dress it up how you want from casual to formal.
4.0,Definitely much smaller than I was expecting but still good quality. Order a size up
4.0,Got this for work and it's perfect!
4.0,Beautiful. As shown in the pics.
4.0,Looks cheaper than I hoped but I got what I paid for.  Like the set for a Halloween set during the month of October.
4.0,This dress is very cute but it does fit smaller than what it says. I recommend going two sizes bigger at least. The color is gorgeous!
4.0,"I didn't like the seam of the v-neck coming across my bust where it did.  This would bother me when I wore it, so I returned the dress,"
4.0,I love the idea behind this and it was cute. Material was fine. Only issue was the sleeves were super long and the legs were too short
4.0,"wore for the first time yesterday, received a few compliments."
4.0,Nice looking.  Complicated to set up. Back light and digital display too small and hard to read. However for the price and its looks 4 stars. Problem developed since I wrote above review.  The minute hand tip and marking is too small and gets very lost in the back ground making it very difficult to see it and there by telling time is difficult. I had to purchase a new watch. It was past my return eligable date but nothing really could be done. If the white paint were a little longer or the hand that would solve the problem.
4.0,"That some of the dial that are in place for show and not actually working.  I prefer to have one dial that works, instead of 2 out 3 that don't.  I believe that with the one dial the watch still would be fashionable."
4.0,I really like this top. Purchased black in XL. Very lightweight I live in Arizona and in July it is HOT this top works out really well. I'd just add that there is no stretch to the material and the top of the shoulder is a tad binding at times but not that big a deal. I noticed this while sweeping up the front yard. Other than that live this top. Thinking about purchasing in another color just deciding which color.
4.0,"Good fit and flattering, but the material is every bit as thin as you'd expect on a cheap dress."
4.0,Love the case only thing that stinks about it my watch will get an “air bubble” under the case and then I can’t use the watch till it fixes the air bubble which is either me taking it off and just blowing or just leaving it till I can try again
4.0,Appropriate quality for the price and it fit as expected. All in all a good purchase.
4.0,"4 stars only because this one is really tight on my head and I cannot wear it for extended periods of time but great product, it really stays on and in place"
4.0,"Got this for my wife and here is her review:<br /><br />""Love this sweater! Perfect fit and the sleeves are super cute with the cuffs.  The color matches the pictures. It's very soft and will be great for winter. Holes are definitely bigger than pictures so an undershirt is needed. Otherwise, I really like it! Would definitely recommend it and might have to go purchase other colors!"""
4.0,"I love these kurtas, wear them around the house over PJs or summer clothes to keep cat fur off! They do like to snuggle :) I have just about every pattern by now. The side slits go up pretty high, so shorts or leggings are a must. The 5th star would be for pockets, of which there are none."
4.0,"I bought three Galaxy Eyeglasses Cases because they came with hinges for opening the case. I thought the hinges would keep the top portion in place, so the case wouldn't roll back, which it did. However, there is a solution to this disappointment:put a little weight on the bottom portion of the case to keep the case level when it's standing open. I like to reach for my open case to extract my reading glasses."
4.0,grate for &#34;Bride Robe&#34;DIY!!!
4.0,"Love this short and great length. Not the biggest fan of the material (clingy), but overall it's a great shirt for either jeans or leggings."
4.0,"I really didn't know what to expect after reading the reviews - this is a terrific dress! 5'8&#34; and normally a 12, I ordered the Large -- but think I need a Medium. It is a little big in the bust line, but nothing that the dry cleaner can't fix with a 1/2 tuck at the shoulders if the Medium doesn't work.  I actually like the pop of caramel in the gray fabric. It is a nice, lightweight chiffon with a sheen, and will be perfect for a late summer wedding.  Very flattering and elegant, flowing dress."
4.0,Disappointed that I purchased the multicolor and I received dinosaurs.
4.0,"The material and embroidery are very good quality. It fits well through the shoulders and at the hips. Bought as a gift for a woman 5'6"" with a US-size-14 wardrobe."
4.0,"I went by the size chart and reviews and ordered an XL, which was too big.  I am 6ft 164 lbs.  The dress was stunning though and I would definitely order a size down."
4.0,It was great.  Just what my daughter needed for holloween.
4.0,The material is a bit thin but it's still a nice top.  The bottom fit a bit strange but it is long enough to wear with leggings.
4.0,slightly narrow through hips.  should be fuller for the style
4.0,These are cute Halloween/Fall earrings. Some are cuter than others but can't pass up the great deal.
4.0,The watch is very well made and the picture is very accurate. The only reason that this isn't 5 stars is because the band seems very cheap and is uncomfortable for extended wear.
4.0,My kid loved it but it's a little on the thin side as far as the material is concerned.
4.0,Don't know how to put them on really as the top doesn't stay on well. Pretty though. Fun to wear.
4.0,"basic, comfy, nice"
4.0,Pretty casual dress.
4.0,Quedan muy bien
4.0,"I was flying Allegiant because I found an incredibly cheap flight for Thanksgiving. Having never flown a budget airline before, I did a lot of research on best ways to cut costs. I knew I had to fit everything I needed for 8 days in this bag, and it worked! I had to do some super tricky roll-folding and think about my wardrobe very specifically, but it can be done. The bag worked perfectly and I wasn't questioned at all upon entering the flight. It fits very snuggly under the seat in front of you. I had no trouble with the handles or the strap (as others have mentioned). It seemed to have been well-made."
4.0,Nice quality but my son doesn't like them.  Too bad.  Yes they run very very small but we sized up before purchasing. Read the description!
4.0,"Very nice for the price, shipped fast..."
4.0,Great shirt! I ordered a large but the fit was small and tighter than expected.
4.0,Somewhat small but maybe that just me because of my flat foot =p<br />Otherwise they are great
4.0,Great value for what I paid but the glass is not snapping in
4.0,"This is a cute bracelet. I ordered it for my teen daughter who is a big nature lover. It's styled like the Pandora bracelets. It took me quite a while to figure out how to open this bracelet. There is a bead labeled Pandora that opens up. It keeps the open end in place. The directions were emailed separately and there are instructions with photos on the item description. If you are not careful when opening that bead up, the beads may fall off of the chain rope bracelet. It is a nice size, but it didn't fit my wrists. I am a plus sized mom and my wrist measures at 7.5 inches. This bracelet fits up to 6.5 inches. It does fit my daughter though. Most of the beads make sense and go along with the nature theme. However, one of the beads is a money bag with a dollar sign which is a little odd to have with a frog, apple, snake, and leaf. The beads can come off, so I will probably take that one off and add something else. Overall, it is cute. Just make sure that you pay attention to the measurements.<br /><br />*I received this for free in exchange for my honest & unbiased review. My thoughts & opinions are my own."
4.0,Loved the concept and showed them to all my friends. Easy to wear. A great idea
4.0,"This hoodie is a nerdgasm in cloth. I ordered a size too big but that was due to the fact that only xxl and small were available.  It is a comfortable hoodie to swim in since I usually fit in a large comfortably.<br /><br />It has a heavy duty zipper with a rather large zipper attachment.  It is roughly the size of a quarter but not annoying or in the way. I think it makes the zipper feel more durable.  At least you can find it rather easily.<br /><br />The hoodie material is nothing special.  A 70/30 cotton/polyester blend for the body with a 97/3 cotton/spandex for the light purple ribbing (at the cuffs and waist).  Likely the kind that you can buy anywhere for fifteen to twenty bucks.  This is probably the only reason to take off a star.  I would have loved it to be more of a polyester than cotton blend.  The hood itself is lined which is a nice feature in general.<br /><br />The decals at the top of the shoulders (the lines on the topmost part)and pockets are sewn in. Wonderful little thing so you will never have to worry about it cracking. The Illidan markings are the usual kind of graphic and will crack eventually (might I suggest air drying though it is a bit tougher with hoodies).  Wonderful glaive designs at the pockets though you may catch some strings from the embroidery itself when you put you hands into the pockets.<br /><br />Finally, the thumbholes are rather small. I have small hands for a woman and sticking my thumbs through these holes was uncomfortable if kept in for too long. It feels like you can stretch them out with constant use, however."
4.0,Seem to fit comfortably. I like the style. Was looking for cool summer socks. These work.
4.0,Looks a bit cheap but still cute and stylish enough to gift
4.0,Got as a gift for my 11 year old niece and she loved it. Strong and pretty well worth the price.
4.0,The work really good when doing things on the computer
4.0,These Bracelet watches are great!! I needed a watch with a second hand for my Fundamentals nursing class (BSN Program) and these watches are an easy on and off from the wrist. The numbers on this watch are easily read and clearly written. The batteries were already included in the watch and delivery was fast. They were packaged with care and arrived in tact.<br />Price wise: Cheap and totally worth it! I bought a pair. Black and White.
4.0,Good quality but they run small.
4.0,A little too stiff right out of the box. Otherwise a good belt.
4.0,"So far great sound and love the longer length. The near 4+ foot long cord makes it so much easier to listen to audio books on my tablet.  When I NEED TO drive or want to just lay back and rest for awhile as I listen to an audio tape, I can place my tablet in a much safer position than with the normal 3 foot corded earphones.  GOOD job Amazon"
4.0,"I purchased this belt to replace my aging Kirkland black belt that I had become so attached to. The bad news is it’s not the same belt. The good news is, this belt is well made and it will do the job. In summary, it’s a well made attractive belt...but not as nice as the Kirkland belts of a few years ago."
4.0,"A little tight through torso area. Nice fabric, very soft. Will keep."
4.0,Nice case just a bit narrow.
4.0,It's a nice ring
4.0,Love the fit. Very flattering for people with curves and rolls.<br /><br />Be aware this is a hand wash only top!
4.0,"I wanted something a little longer that reached mid-thigh, but still satisfied nonetheless.<br />It covers the knees completely, and stays up without cutting off your circulation.<br />Opaque and good quality!"
4.0,"Loved, but way too sloppy wide for me, and the heel was way to tall, really cute though, but sent back"
4.0,"I can't fully review these as I purchased them as a gift for someone.  As far as I know, my daughter is quite happy with them.  They arrived on time and were as described."
4.0,I love the watch it was a gift! But after a month of wear on of the spring bars is loose and the band frequently falls off.
4.0,I'm a big fan of this jumpsuit (no pun intended). I just runs a little large.
4.0,"Bought this scarf as a gift for my mom. It's nice and wide so it can be folded, wrapped, warn as a shawl, etc."
4.0,Tons of compliments. Only wish there were openings for a belt to help it stay on. Occasionally I would notice it slid off under my shirt.
4.0,"Great under scrub pants while outside, driving in cold car, or cold drafts indoors. Slouch placement well over lower calf/ankles without falling over heel or down into shoes; not tight fitting so best with shoes, doesn't fit tightly to heel/feet as athletic/dance wear would prefer. Cleans easily, pet hair comes off in dryer well."
4.0,Good value for desired color = hope will last for a bonded leather belt.
4.0,Really soft and pretty.
4.0,The only reason is not getting 5 starts is b/c the back zippers cut me up within 15 honestly of wearing them... on off my heels was bleeding.... after I put band aids on the back I was good to go... so put band aids on and your experience will be great.... also all the shoes I order in this brand fits perfect... true to size
4.0,"These earrings are cute!  Their arrival took so long that I had forgotten I ordered them.  Other than that, they are really cute. My daughter loves them."
4.0,"I love the color! I feel it’s true to size except the chest area might be a little bit smaller than what I was hoping for. I kept “pooping out...” Overall, great fit!"
4.0,"These things are huge on my tiny hands. My fingertips barely reach the knuckles.<br />My other complaint is that they are way greener than the listing image makes them look. I needed something more gray, so I will probably end up painting these myself."
4.0,"You can see through the shirt and get a good view of any colorful undergarments, but since I purchased it to wear under scrubs/ uniform it doesn't matter to me. It's comfortable and I can push up the sleeves when needed. The overall size fit as expected. The only problem I had with these was that it isn't a true crew neck like it is shown in the picture. The neckline is a quite a bit lower an wider (style is between crew and scoop). Unlike crew neck, cross bra straps are not covered with this top."
4.0,Love this item.Material is kind of thin perfect for spring and summer weather.I used as a tunic and a dress.Also nice if you are top heavy like me.
4.0,Fits great and works as expected.
4.0,"This is a very cute bag, a little smaller than I anticipated, but it's helped me cut back on all of the stuff I carry."
4.0,Worked as intended. Rain and sweat made them fall apart pretty easy. But the visuals were awesome!
4.0,Great looking band.  Easy to remove links. Only problem is that my wrist is between sizes. Remove 2 links and its too tight. Remove only 1 and it's too loose.
4.0,Very comfortable. I received lots of compliments. I dressed the jumpsuit up with a white blazer.
4.0,"A little too thin, so you will have to definitely wear an undergarment of some kind. I used leggings and a camisole. But it is really cute for beachy, or sunny day/outdoor parties."
4.0,"The earnings are pretty as shown in the picture.  However, one of the earrings broke the first day when I received.  The pearl in the center fell of.  I had to use super clue to clue it back.  Just hope the earring is stronger and has better quality."
4.0,"I really liked these. They are comfortable enough to wear to bed or for casual trips out. I originally bought these to use while recovering from surgery, and still use them. I wouldn't recommend them for anything more than moderate activity."
4.0,These shorts are a great fit and a nice length. The material is a little stiff at fit but I hope they soften up after a few washes.
4.0,"Not a pretty sweater, but keeps you warm"
4.0,These fit good & are great when Ur having a day of play & need to pick up & go ! EZ access
4.0,Beautiful envelope and cheap
4.0,Its beautiful and good for its price but the quality isn’t great. Several gems were off so I will be sticking them to secure it till my event. We purchased 8 sets of these.
4.0,Too short for tall ladies.
4.0,"These didn't work out like I hoped. When at home I frequently like to pull my hair off my face.  I usually have a fan blowing everywhere like it cold, but not my hair blowing in my face (hence a hat or full hair band).  This was not big enough to cover my full head of hair and head. I guess if I hair very short to no hair it might fit better.  The fabric felt nice and soft so would be comforting had they worked for me.<br /><br />."
4.0,"Glasses are  smaller than I thought, I don't know why I imagined them bigger.  They are pretty light, you almost don't notice them.  Image clarity is Superb.  As someone stated before, you can almost glare direct at the sun, and not be bothered by reflection.  Not 5 stars due to small size, but that is the only complain."
4.0,Its Big for my hubby but quality is good .I did received this product in exchange for a review.
4.0,These are really nice. They’re not broken or scratches in any way. I am going to buy another set because the size I am is actually to small so I’m going get the bigger. For reference I ordered the 1/2”/ 12mm but am going to order the 9/16” / 14mm.
4.0,Bought it a size too big on purpose for him to grow into. Love<br />the snaps between the legs for easy diaper changing. Does look a little cheaply made but comfortable and decent for the price.
4.0,"These are comfortable, inexpensive, light weight pants great for summer everyday wear. I wear them for house work and yet they are nice enough to wear out to run an errand. They wash easily and don’t require ironing."
4.0,I guess it's just your sense of style I wanted these type of leggings so bad but they just don't look right one me and they're a bit long for me.
4.0,Ita comfortable but not high impact.
4.0,I find dull but they liked it Gift
4.0,I like it however they were a little bigger than i thot
4.0,I gave this product 4 stars only because it is not good for wire frame glasses. Works great with my plastic glasses. I like the product it works great with my plastic frames. So if you are going to use it on plastic frames I recommend this product. But if you are going to use this product on wire frame glasses you will not be happy.
4.0,"They were tight at the end of the shorts. the threading made them very uncomfortable, I simply loosened the threading to my comfort."
4.0,It fit perfectly and didn't shrink in the dryer. I absolutely love it!
4.0,"I sleep in these to relieve my restless leg symptoms. They're pretty great, but I wish they went down as far as the mid foot to prevent swelling at the ankles."
4.0,I absolutely did love this. But couldn’t wear it all night it was a little tight for me personally and when taking off I had a mark on my head. Other then that great purchase.
4.0,Fits and feels wonderful. No need for stretching or breaking-in due to no leather. Comfortable to wear. Would recommend
4.0,doubled zipper loosens the coat at the bottom letting you drive without feeling stuffed.
4.0,"REVISED - after this review seller contacted me and couldn't have been more accommodating and willing to help.  Shipped another necklace out right away after description and explanation as to what happened to original necklace.  Purchased as a gift so recipient was very happy to have a replacement, she wears it daily.<br /><br />Cute but not good quality, broke after 2 days of wearing.  Contacted seller and no response.  Not recommended."
4.0,These were terrific to protect my hands whenI temporarily had to use a walker and then crutches. Outstanding for this use!
4.0,"It's okay for what it is, but the visilbility through it isn't as good as I wish it was. Bought it to be used by a streamer in front of a green screen, but it is too difficult for him to see through it well enough to do anything very well, which defeats the purpose.  It is funny for short-term stunts, but not for a long time when you need use of your vision for tasks or safety."
4.0,Nice hat!;) I'm satisfied for its quality and price
4.0,unusual and fun
4.0,"Looks nice, the battery lasted me about 1.5 years"
4.0,My niece liked her shirt. Just slightly big on her. Looks cute on her.
4.0,Not impressed with the stiff material
4.0,"These are really cute, but they’re kind of small on my feet. I wear a size 8 and these are a little bit short on the heel and tight around the toes, but I can ignore the feeling. The cuteness makes up for the fit."
4.0,"Loose fitting, the belt is necessary despite my measurements matching theirs exactly. Very comfortable, nice and light fabric, great for warm, humid hiking."
4.0,I like this set with some of my tan clothes and with a black set.  It really stands out.
4.0,The necklace part is a little irritating but the pendant is good
4.0,"Fits and looks great on my small wrist. Seems well made. Will update durability rating after I wear it for a while. Only thing is connectors are plastic, not metal as in description.<br />4/25/21 update- my grey band is still doing well-no stretching or fraying. It fits even better when I switch the sides and put metal clasp on right vs left.  I ordered another in red. Fit is also great  I forgot to take it off when showering and it dried really fast with no fading or color bleeding.  Happy with this purchase  would buy again."
4.0,"Item is definitely from China, as it came with a product insert card completely in Chinese, and there was a strong plastic smell when first opened. It's obviously not a super high quality product, but the amount of storage is amazing and it looks nice."
4.0,Good cheap watch I've abused it and it still works . Easy to read at glance nice light
4.0,The color and size are perfect for the rose with blue strap. The watch is elegant without being too flashy and the size of the Roman numerals is great. Mom really liked it. I hope it lasts a long time but I'm waiting to see. They do have an advertised free product if you review your first item but they told me they could not send it. I would not waste my time!
4.0,"Earrings are pretty and are holding there color currently. I did have to get a replacement as one of the posts was bent originally. The sellers were fantastic to work with. I like the earrings and unless they furnish, I would recommend them."
4.0,Item was as expected. It was shipped out and received in a timely fashion. My 6yr old grandaughter loved it
4.0,Super sparkly just how I wanted it. Fits good while I'm walking. Only down side is that the glitter strip that's on the band is already lifting and I haven't even worn it a full week.
4.0,In photo is much better
4.0,Grandkids have had a blast with the finger lights
4.0,The colors are very nice. This suit runs big .It has elastic on sides you can't wear belt unless you add belt loops.
4.0,Nice material but I had to buy one size up than I usually wear
4.0,"I love this dress.  It has nice little pockets to hold small items.  It's comfortable, and well made."
4.0,Happy with my purchase. Receiving compliments on these already. I just worry about the bar in the back wearing out.  You have to slightly bend the bar to get off and pinch it back tight when wearing again.
4.0,Great choice fits well
4.0,For great and is very comfortable
4.0,"The lenses are a little dark for night driving if there are no overhead streetlights or headlights from traffic. With lots of lights, they are great. Clear and sharp. Very comfortable to wear."
4.0,info said inside pocket ther are nonne
4.0,It gets loose when used with a thick tie... Still it's a good quality tie bar.
4.0,Very cute t shirt
4.0,Love the quality just slightly larger than I expected
4.0,The first one I ordered was chipped.  The second one was good.
4.0,Thin but not see through. Perfect for that casual easy to wear dress on a hot summer day to go to store and look decent. I like it!
4.0,"Very nice, will buy again."
4.0,"We bought this for my son to give to his girlfriend for Christmas. They’re 11, so as far as quality goes, it’s about that level. It’s a cute bracelet, but it’s pretty chintzy. The charms are huge and unevenly spaced. It’s no Pandora, but for $16, there’s not much to complain about."
4.0,"This is cute, but not what I was expecting. It's more formal than I thought. The material is like a chiffon (double-lined). I was expecting something more like a casual crepe-like fabric, suitable for wearing to work. It was also much shorter than I had hoped, so it definitely wouldn't have been appropriate for work. I would consider ordering it in a larger size/different color for a wedding or something, just not what I was looking for."
4.0,I did ask a question which was never asnwered.It fit great except around my boobs where it was a bit snug.I'm a 38dd and the question I asked was did it  stretch a little or leave some breathing room around the chest?Other than that it's great.The material is fantastic.It's not that cheap thin material.I might post another pic when I figure out what I'm going to do with it.I would have left 5 stars if my question had gotten answered before I ordered or I would have went a size up.
4.0,"but fit my x-small daughter. she wears a 00., but it was a weird shape."
4.0,"I purchased these for my 10 month old. I was concerned about the size; however, the socks fit but still give him plenty of growing space. The socks have been great at preventing slippage on our wood floors, which is the reason I purchased them. I am happy with the purchase and would recommend them."
4.0,The dress generally fit as expected and matched product description. However it was a bit too short for me (5'9&#34;) and fit in a way that the fabric would move up as you danced or walked around making it too risky for my bridal shower and returning it for that reason.
4.0,really nice bag
4.0,The fabric feels like costume fabric but the look is good. Bought it as part of a costume but would not wear for everyday use. Runs large.
4.0,Rings are cute! Love the way they change color with my moods! Packaging was fine.
4.0,Top falls in when not wearing the hat
4.0,"for the price its fine!<br />for the price WAY better than i expected... i got it for the style not the price, i would have paid 3x more for sterling silver but can not find it...<br />every cute, a bit on the a little too shiny side, but i'm sure when i actually wear it it will blend fine"
4.0,Looks nice but runs small. Ordered a size larger and gave the smaller one to my child.
4.0,"I’m 5’11” and 253lbs I ordered a large as that’s what I wear in Walmart leggings, and in academy sports leggings. They were a little tight in the thighs. Next time I order I’ll get an XL. The material is great, even with them being a little tight they still aren’t see through. They are incredibly soft and comfortable. I will order again."
4.0,"So, I opted for the combination pair, with the black lenses, and the orange reflective ones. Both frames fit my face decently, similar to most Ray Ban style glasses.<br /><br />However, as you'll see in the photo, there's a major difference in hinge design between the reflective lens frames, and the black lens frames.<br /><br />The reflective lenses are on the left, with the triple stack hinge design, while the black lenses are on the right with the single stack design.<br /><br />The black frames, the single stack hinge, out of the box are looser to fold the arms in, and feel ""broken in"" without needing to play with folding them at all.<br />The reflective lenses I needed to take apart and liberally apply some lithium grease into to make them fold normally without sticking with the hinge pins screwed in tightly.<br /><br />After greasing both frame hinge types, the black lenses are now feeling loose, and I feel like I shouldn't have lubricated them. The reflective type ones feel normal though.<br /><br />I'll post updates as needed, but I feel like the triple stack hinge design will last longer."
4.0,Nice dress just doesn’t fit
4.0,Material is great and looks good....after I got it tailored.  Pants were waaaaay too baggy.  The sleeves are like wizards sleeves.  If you can get both cut to size the rest looks great.  Also had to get the shoulder portions sewn at the back so they wouldnt slide down my shoulders so much.
4.0,"Haven't used it  yet, but like the look and ease of use."
4.0,"Good quality, nice length, large was a bit to big though , I’m 5”11 160 lbs"
4.0,"These are a beautiful, sumptuous boot, but just NOT roomy enough for my little sturdy size 6 (sometimes 5.5) foot. I ordered a 6.5 and I could barely get my foot in. I'm returning them and the hunt continues. They don't run small in the length at all... it's the height... made for very thin/slender feet."
4.0,They work but after a few wears they will start to fall apart
4.0,It is a beautiful dress and fits well.
4.0,Runs small but nice fabric
4.0,Cute bag tons of compliments only down fall it came with a big scratch on the front and I had to tighten one of the clamps on the chain since it kept coming apart
4.0,"Literally so cute and sexy! Some parts, like the bra, the material with get bunched and the black lining will show, but it’s alright. Love it"
4.0,Super cute but very lightweight. Has stretch to it too. Bought a small and it fits perfect
4.0,"I loved the product, very realistic"
4.0,Granddaughter very happy with outfit
4.0,"The material seems thick and durable, however the holes on the strap does not fit size, thus making the watch feel a bit loose or tight on my wrist. I guess I need to lose or gain some weight for it to fit perfectly."
4.0,wife lost her original and this suffices.  good quality/price.
4.0,"Its easy to clean and great in rainy weather. As long I remembered to zip the purse close, my items will stay dry"
4.0,"The engraving was beautifully done. It is in metal so it should last very long. The only issue was the buckle/strap which held the tag. I travel 20 days out of a month, so I needed a durable tag holder. It unbuckled/fell after the second trip. After a month, it was no longer on my bag. It fell off at an airport, so I find myself having to order another tag. This time, I’ll likely use a different holder, not the one that came with the tag. Again, the tag itself is well made."
4.0,"I like the design, would have liked a dark gray hat"
4.0,Not exactly what I expected from the picture. It’s a lot wider then it seems. That being said it looks cute with a lacy bralette and a belt and also with a tight white cap sleeve shirt under to wear to work with a belt. And even better it’s crazy comfy for wearing around the house. It’s a 3 in 1 deal.
4.0,Muy bien gracias
4.0,"I love this!! I gave it 4 stars bc the quality is what you expect, not great. With that being said, i LOVE THIS OUTFIT. The skirt is so flattering and the top is cute too! I ordered medium and it looks like it fits tighter than it does, which means i can breathe and eat in this skirt. I have other tops with this neckline and it always is off on one side like it falls or looks weird, but this one i feel secure and comfy in. I have a 28” in waist, medium was perfect."
4.0,"Bought for my daughter, just what she wanted"
4.0,Great card holder. Very sleek and beautiful. Holds my slightly over sized cards from Moo.com !
4.0,"I really wanted to like this bag, but unfortunately I had to return it.  It seemed reasonably light, which also comes with concerns a out durability.  I was looking for a small bag for an overseas flight that could hold my flight essentials and not be uncomfortable in front of me. The bag seems well made and the size was perfect.  The problems in my opinion were that it was much lighter than the bag I was replacing, but I felt it would fall short on durability.  Given the price, I would have kept it, but the second problem was a deal breaker for me. I thought that there was a major design flaw in not having some type of admin panel for pens, chargers, cables or go to items.  That is an absolute requirement for me, but more importantly the bag is marketed as an urban sling.  I don’t know what they were thinking on this.  It is also interesting that this company makes so many of these bags in different sizes and for different uses, that they didn’t consider this."
4.0,FITS WELL NICE SOFT MATERIAL I LIKE IT!
4.0,I like the whole mask  It meets my needs
4.0,"I love this bikini. It is pretty simple, no crazy straps etc.  And seems to keep everything in pretty good, but I have only tried it on, not worn it swimming yet. I got a size S and I am 5'6, 123 lbs and I like how it fits me. Pretty cheeky bottoms. The only downside I'd say is that they put white on the inside and that does show a bit as you move. If they had  used the same color inside as out I would have given it 5 stars.<br />I took the orange one on vacay with me, and it stayed in place really well, even when swimming/aqua gym. I love how the bright orange shows off my tan! If the inside had not been white it would be 5 stars!"
4.0,"Would have gave 5 stars but the graphics of the dress was not completely 100%the same . Design was slightly different, not really a big deal breaker still a nice dress. Also it's not as bright white as in the picture, it's more off white. I'm only so picky cause I'm a photographer and bought it for a shoot, when selecting wardrobe it needs to be 100% exact"
4.0,"The item keeps you warm; however, it smells like plastic. Remove the inside brim of the hat (its hard to wash without destroying the plastic brim inside.)"
4.0,"Good materials except for the gold ribbon, it is itchy and my daughter did not like it. I wish they would use a softer type."
4.0,good fit and nice socks
4.0,"I brought the sweatshirt for my daughter. I like the tie dye colors. The sweatshirt is good quality material, nice and heavy for the fall and winter months."
4.0,"It’s ok, nice hat but net doesn’t stay down"
4.0,looks pretty good. seems to be of a fair quality. but runs a little too big for the size claimed.
4.0,"I love the dress but mine had a huge rip across the front when I opened it up. Other than having to return it, it's beautiful!"
4.0,"When I originally got the Gear Fit I wondered why Samsung didn't issue them with a normal clasp like this. However, the original equipment band lasted about a year before it started popping off easily. That's when I took a chance on this. Have had it for about 2 months now and don't really have anything negative worth reporting at this point. I'd recommend this band."
4.0,Nice glasses. I love the color the fit is a little tight for my face frame. I have a round facebut overall good. I notice a little difference when I started wearing them at work. I don't get as much headaches as before staring at a screen all day. Overall they are good
4.0,Perfect fit<br /><br />However Some of the threads started to come out already.
4.0,"I read several reviews but didn't see any that mentioned the weight of the buckle. I bought a similar belt from a different company and its buckle was somewhat lighter (almost exactly 1 oz. lighter - the weight of five quarters). I have enough trouble keeping my pants up with keys, cell phone, multi-tool, coins, etc. so I'd prefer not to have the extra weight. On the plus side, the buckle is beautiful & seems to be very well made (I'm an engineer). The belt looks to be higher quality than another similar belt I bought that cost about the same. One more minor quibble, when the belt is on and under some tension (e.g.: sitting down), it can be harder to release the catch. I had a lot of trouble at first but it seems ok now. It helps to pull on the tail to relieve the pressure. It also helps to push the lever in the correct direction - I had to practice a bit, even though I'm an engineer! :-)"
4.0,"I loved the bracelets, they looked just as the picture showed. The rhinestones are bright and the golden coat shiny."
4.0,Little tight but the lining on the inside that is soft and has extra around the ears is great!
4.0,"Very nicely made, warm knit beanie hat."
4.0,It's cute enough but it did not match my wedding dress so I am using another Berricle piece I bought.
4.0,"This is a terrific band for my new Apple watch.  So much easier to put on and take off than what I had before.  The only slight drawback is that it is quite challenging to adjust the band for length if it does not fit precisely.  I am a very handy 75 year old with 20-20 vision, and it took me a little over an hour, and some very careful work, to take three pieces out of my band to shorten it.  I would hesitate to try this by yourself if you do not have the right tools (a very pointed, narrow, and stiff tool as well as a set of tweezers).  However, now that it's adjusted, I really like it."
4.0,"Beautiful shoes, however my daughter wears 4-4.5 anf they were too snug! We got the heel version to wear with her dress!"
4.0,Totally happy with this hat!!
4.0,"great color , just a tad too big"
4.0,"Neutral tank top, good coverage and very high neckline compared to others I have owned. There is no way to determine which side is front or back except trying it both ways. Other than that, its great."
4.0,"Scored these on prime day and they're great now that I have them broken in, but I wish I had gone up a half size because the heel is ALMOST too short."
4.0,"Gorgeous, wonderful quality but runs a size large."
4.0,Nice mask good quality but sometimes hard to breath in. I do like the adjustable nose piece.
4.0,"No cinch to help it stay in place. Once modified, it fits well and is comfortable."
4.0,The crown came loose. I could not use it
4.0,"After reading the reviews, I was sure to order up a size, as they mentioned the skirt fits tight. They were right. A large is tight, but not see-through.  The length is just what I was looking for."
4.0,"Seems like a nice sweatshirt. I ordered a x large which I normally wear, but it was way to big!"
4.0,They work well - using as a photographer - but are a wee bit too snug (though usable).  There's a lose odd stretchy thread in the mitten part that you can't cut since it would unravel and it's a bit annoying.  Otherwise a good pair working well for me.
4.0,"Dress fit as pictured on model for me....slightly above the knees and was true to size. The material isn't stretchy but I didn't have an issue with that, even with bigger arms. There were a lot of loose strings on my dress, but I just snipped them off and wore it anyway! It was too cute to return!"
4.0,"by far my favorite ring that i own! it was hard to adjust, but after you get it the way you want it’s amazing"
4.0,"I discovered Freebirds at the end of last year and this is my 5th shoe I have purchased from this brand.  Sizing-wise, Freebirds are inconsistent for me.  I normally wear a 9, but have found that with Freebirds, sometimes a 9 fits, other times I have to go to a 10 (usually a 10 if the toe is really pointy).  The 9 fit perfectly in this style.  The red color is a little darker than pictured, more of a maroon, but I like it and I definitely wanted something other than brown or black.  As the other reviewers noted, there was a weird substance that was on the heel of my order, but not on the leather itself.  However, IT'S NOT GLUE - I think it is a shellac that they are using to color the heel, that just isn't applied evenly.  I scraped some off, and it had a red tint.  I ended up scraping/lightly sanding the heel only to remove the excess.  I do agree that for the normal price that the quality would be unacceptable, however I got these for a really great price, so was willing to spend 5 minutes to clean them up."
4.0,"I was told years ago that I could not have children. I am now 44yrs old and never cared to have children. I simply thought this looked like a cute bracelet; so I bought this bracelet in January of 2020; and, in January 2021, I found out I was pregnant. I just realized that this bracelet that I’ve been wearing everyday (along with 2 others similar to it - same brand) was called “birthing.”<br />The good thing is, my boyfriend (Who is 45 and has two children) and I are over the moon happy! Our little girl is due in August 2021...<br />I’m sure it could all be just a coincidence; but I choose to believe the bracelet had something to do with our conception of our baby girl!"
4.0,Love it! just wish the handles were longer.
4.0,it looks great and is lightweight but definitely bigger than expected
4.0,Purchased as a gift and it looks good..
4.0,"**UPDATE**<br />As of 1/4/22” I purposely tried shrinking my daughters hoodie as it’s large size seems to aggravate her now. It didn’t shrink 😅 (a good thing if that’s something you’re worried about). She’s super bummed about the small not fitting her properly for a “child/kids” size 🥺 so now I HAVE to make it right by her (since it was a Christmas present) and find another affordable option, as waiting for this seller to correct the sizing or offering a XS option now won’t be a option at this point. Being since it’s been worn multiple times and has been washed, I’ll store it away for her in hopes by the time she gets bigger, she’ll still like Pokémon<br />———————<br />Pros - The graphics/printing on theses hoodies are amazing 🤩 I wasn’t expecting such clean and bright colors at this price! I love the fact that the ends of the drawstrings are metallic, this keeps my daughter from chewing on them and making them fray like other knotted ended draw strings.<br />The ears on the hood itself are adoreable even though they tend to lay flat than stay pointed up. The word “Pokémon” is in bold, original font and legible on both arms. Really hoping they come out with other characters so I can get myself one (yes, I’m a 35yr old mother that still loves this nostalgic series I grew up watching and collecting)<br /><br />Cons- the sizing runs a bit big for my average sized 7yr old daughter. I ordered her the small size, but it seems to swallow her. This hoodie is at least 5” too long in the arms and down her waist. I plan on updating my review once I get it washed to see if it shrinks, or if the colors fade drastically or not.<br />I tried the hoodie on as it seemed to be a perfect fit for me besides the arm length. The arms are too short, but fits everywhere else great (I’m 5’2” at 109lbs, yes, a small and petite adult lol)<br />It’s a pretty thin fabric, I believe it’s polyester, so it’s a bit thin (but keeps us warm in temps below 50 degrees), which is a win as both my daughter and I usually get hot in most other fabrics.<br /><br />Overall, this hoodie is great! Its totally worth the price for the quality of it, just, the measurements are off by at least a full size (think “teen” sizes when/if ordering) I hope to buy more if they fix this issue, make the ears a bit sturdier, and add other starters or characters like Charazard, Eevee, Totodile, ect)"
4.0,Grate Value.  Very Comfortable.
4.0,Cute sunglasses. They are more for style than anything and are what I expected.
4.0,"This shirt fits pretty good, the larger the size the better, pretty comfy!!"
4.0,These are basic work gloves that do the job. They shrink slightly when washed but not enough to effect wear
4.0,"I gave them as gifts for people at work.  They needed to have the end strings cleaned up.  Otherwise, they're cute."
4.0,"Thin, but probably good for sand."
4.0,Cute very flat but comfy
4.0,I really like this coat. It’s warm and arrived in a timely manner. It did arrive very wrinkled. I ran a cool iron over it and this resolved that issue. I did not like the fur on the hood. It was scraggly looking. It is removable so I took it off and like it much better. Arm length is great. I ordered an XL. I’m 5’7” and 180#. It fit perfect. I also like the longer length. Color is as pictured.
4.0,"Help you being able to breath, have to use double side tape to keep it against the mask"
4.0,Band is extremely too short. It’s not a comfortable fit bc you can’t have it too loose for going toward the end and you can’t have it tight bc it’s very uncomfortable.<br /><br />Love the clear pink look. Got compliments at the doctors office.
4.0,nice earrings .
4.0,I really like this too except for the button loops are white and not dyed to match the color of the top so they are visible.  The top otherwise is gorgeous
4.0,"I love this robe and the fact that it absorbs the water rather than deflecting it. It fits just fine. My only complaint is that after about 5 months, the seams in the arm holes have split from the bodice.  Only a few stitches to fix it but I didn't expect it."
4.0,"I found this set of wheel covers for my 2002 Camry to be more than adequate. They lack the Toyota emblem and the dummy lug nuts make it necessary to remove the wheel cover in order to remove the wheel. However, considering the fact that you can buy a set of four of these for far less than the cost of just one original equipment cover they are a good buy."
4.0,I love this shirt but order up a size if you are between sizes. It runs tight at the hips
4.0,"VERY dark sunglasses, but they looks slick."
4.0,It's a pretty see-through. I ended up wearing white shorts under.
4.0,I believe I could have ordered a size smaller as it’s a bit roomy.  I’m 5’9” and around 200lbs.  Very cute and I love it has pockets.
4.0,"I would like it if the seams weren't so thick.  That is always a problem with lined leather gloves.  Otherwise, they are very nice."
4.0,"Bought this dress in M, L and XL (for 34C/size8).  Length was just below knee.  M fit chest, shoulders slightly too wide, slightly too snug on hips.  Nothing obscene but the material is too thin and sheer (can see the undergarment, of any color) to be too form fitting anywhere.  I would've kept the dress if it were double-layered (only the cowl is) as it would've solved the sheerness issue because the navy is gorgeous and the material soft and comfy.<br />CONS:<br />-slightly sheer<br />-slightly clingy<br />-the ruching at the waist is odd as it is assymetrically only on one side (right).<br />-the XL in grey had a weird detail which looks like a mistake.  The RIGHT shoulder has a vertical 3&#34; seam about 1.5&#34; in from the shoulder.  Not present on the left side and not present in the M (navy) and L (grey). *shrug* &#62; Have uploaded photos of the area."
4.0,I absolutely love the dress the first time I wore it. Once I washed it (I followed the washing directions)  there was shrinkage and color fading
4.0,This was a nice necklace with a beautiful detailed flower.  Will look nice with a dress or suit.  About one inch across.
4.0,These are nice glasses!
4.0,The black ones fit better than the grey -the black is a sleeker fabric than the grey. Wish they had come in pack of 2 black.
4.0,Its really cute and my bot loves it. It on the bigger side for him so he is able to remove it easily. The band is also very loose but we like it.
4.0,Item is comfortable no bone sticking out. Does run a bit large however. I would suggest ordering one size down
4.0,"Great for the price, the band feels like it's made of plastic."
4.0,it was tricky to put on i wish the straps were wider but over all a cute and sexy crop
4.0,I got so many compliments on this dress. Slip underneath could be a little longer
4.0,"It's a good product for the price. I would recommend this product if you want something to protect your sunglasses against scratches and light compression. It's not a very stiff case, so it won't protect the glasses from being crushed."
4.0,Nice dress but is too large
4.0,The holographic color is great. There are a couple spots that have small scratches but you don’t notice unless you look up close. Will be wearing to a music festival!
4.0,"We already have the light blue one and love it so decided to get the black one too.<br />It fit greats, is made of comfy material and is nice and poofy like the blue one. But I’m marking it one star down because it doesn’t have the three little rhinestones which was quite a disappointment to my sparkle loving 4 year old."
4.0,I really like this simple dress. It does run big. I got a medium and it’s loose and a little long. I really like it so I’m going to buy it in a smaller size.
4.0,very attractive bracelet
4.0,Maybe needed a large
4.0,"Love this top, through it is a little short in the front. Wish the material was thicker as I feel I need to wear a tank under it."
4.0,My Dad loves these.  They are warm and comfortable.  I get him a new pair every year. This year’s purchased arrived on schedule and the quality is consistent year to year.
4.0,"This dress is very flattering and beautiful but it was so see through 😩 I purchased it in the purple and could see everything. Additionally, as someone who is 5’2”, this was definitely very long (hit my ankles). The material it is made of is very delicate and arrived with snags. I would definitely re-order in a darker color thought because it was very flattering!"
4.0,"Somehow I missed that this belt was elastic, but I was pleasantly surprised with this belt.  I like the woven design so you aren't limited to the preset notches.  With the elastic, you can stretch it a little bit more to ensure your pants stay put.  I like it.  It seems sturdy and not likely to stretch out any time soon."
4.0,it is cute but the flower earring is big on your ear for 11 year olds but it very cute and pretty
4.0,I would say it’s just ok. I am a 42D and I’ve been looking for a tube top type bra to fit my band width. It’s been a bit challenging but I was able to slide this on snuggly.<br /><br />It does have those strange cups in it which would be great if they were bigger but it just does not like right.<br />I hope maybe with a too over it that you won’t be able to tell. If you can I will attempt to take them out which actually I found they do have a convenient opening inside where the cups are so you can take them out. Which is a good idea when washing so that makes me like this a little bit better.<br /><br />Not a has tube top. Fits me at a 42D so I am happy about that. And definitely much more comfortable than a strapless bra.
4.0,"My 6 year old recently started playing T ball, so I got these for her. They are a little on the big side for a girl her age/size. Would do fine on a teenager or fully grown woman, as these are intended. As of now we aren't really comfortable with her wearing them, due to being worried about them ripping out of her ears."
4.0,"Snug fitting, great for actual swimming, doing laps."
4.0,Love the shirt however runs small
4.0,These fit greatb and my son is a fan of anything Adidas. I love the material and he can wear it in colder weather as well.
4.0,"These are very nice cuff links.  They were a little lack luster and needed a polish, but I appreciate they shipped them in separate plastic zip lock bags  so they wouldn't get scratched.  Also it came with a nice black velvet gift bag to put them in.<br /><br />These are unique and I think would make a nice gift for a stylish man.<br /><br />I purchased these at a discount in exchange for a review."
4.0,Just about what i expected. Look goog and will do the job.
4.0,"Looks alright, feels a bit cheap but what can ya do right? Also the title of this is wrong. There is no Kanji on the sweater. It is all Katakana."
4.0,The extra button and the neck is a little odd. Luckily my hair hides it. I thought it was a mistake but looks just like the photo.
4.0,A little pricey for cheap quality but they’re cute
4.0,"I ordered a Medium and I'm 5'6&#34;, 150lbs. I could have definitely gone with a Small. The length hit past my knees. The scalloped edging was very nicely done and the off the shoulder look is really in style. I bought this intending to wear it at a themed party reminiscent of Dapper Days and it fit a lot of the characteristics I was looking for in that it was a little bit retro but classic.<br />The fabric was a little too heavy for me to wear comfortably. However, someone in a climate any cooler than South Florida (most areas) would not be bothered by this."
4.0,Great price and fit! It was perfect for me to wear over leggings.
4.0,"Not bad, getting what you paid for. Armpit area too loose tho, too much extra fabric."
4.0,"The shorts are super cute and lightweight. However, they are a bit snug. I bought an XL and it's a little tighter around the waist than I would prefer. But I still wear them!"
4.0,"Bracelet is great, but the tie/knot isn't really secure. Nervous it'll fall off? It is for a friend so I'm not sure if it is insecure when on."
4.0,Good value easy to break out of though
4.0,Very cute but extremely long.
4.0,NO FURTHER COMMENT
4.0,"It seems like a fine product, but it's really very heavy and warm.  If you're expecting a lightweight linen coat, this is not what you're looking for."
4.0,"I’m torn. I’m not sure I like it, though my friends say it’s cute. I’ll keep it, may wear to the beach. Not so long, which I like. Doesn’t sweep the ground. Shoulders stay put for the most part."
4.0,"I'm a size 5 in pants and small in tops. I ordered a medium. The top fits great, shorts were a bit smaller than expected. Fabric is different, something I've never worn before. Overall its a good product"
4.0,"Pretty dress. Very thin fabric material, and not ideal for bustier gals like myself. Very light for summer."
4.0,"The material is really good quality. I weigh about 132 lb and I am 5'3. I ordered a small and it fits really well but it's a little too fitted for work. And because it has pockets, and it's too fitted, the pockets look a little awkward. I think if I ordered a medium it would be really nice. Also it's important if you have really muscular or bigger thighs that you order a size. I also wish the waistband was a little thicker so that it provided a little bit more of a tummy control."
4.0,the pendent is a beautiful work of art. It twinkles just right. The only problem is the chain is thin and broke after her hair got pulled out from under it. Yes we would probably another pendent but also purchase a new chain.
4.0,Nice dress as presented in the photo. Note that the materiel is thin like a tee shirt not like a stretch material. I ordered a size up and it is a bit large. I could have ordered my regular size (6/8) and it would have had a more tailored/fitted look. I will do that next time.
4.0,"These pants are very soft and comfortable.  Although they look like flannel, they really aren't flannel, but a lightweight cotton material.  Ordered despite being larger than actual size, which was perfect for my 19yo daughter, who likes her clothing oversized. Being 5'4"", the leg length was actually perfect, goes right to her foot.  This would definitely be an issue for me, being a long torso'd 5'7"", everything ""normal"" sized is too short for me."
4.0,"It's cute and comfortable. I'm only 5', so all these type shirts or tanks are really long on me, but I just tie one side and it looks cute. It's like t-shirt material. I like it!"
4.0,"Its a carmal color dots- But its a nice scarf- Well worth the price- & long wait for arrival- Its a nice size to wear with a jacket of head scarf- Other than the &#34;I thought were white dots&#34; I have no other complaints-Yes, I highly recommend for style- well made & budget friendly-"
4.0,"I bought the navy/mustard pattern and it looks just like the picture. Love it. It runs small, but I read the other reviews and ordered a size up, which is a tad loose but fine. It is LONG. Perfect long. I am 5'8&#34; and it hits the floor, even if I wear it high on my waist. The fabric is thin, very lightweight but not see through. Love this skirt!"
4.0,A bit see through but other than that great! Got size medium
4.0,"Beautiful!  A little larger than I usually wear, but are very nice!  The czs are beautiful and the setting is well made."
4.0,"I love this bracelet, but I have a very difficult time closing it.  The difficult part is keeping the clasp open while I'm trying to close it.  It keeps slipping.  Other than that, the bracelet itself is beautiful and the color matches many of my outfits."
4.0,The shirt didn’t have any stretch so it was a bit tight and the skirt fringe was too long so I had to cut it so my daughter didn’t trip on it. Otherwise it was perfect for the theme and we received many compliments on the outfit.
4.0,"I was disappointed in the size, but other than that they are ok"
4.0,"I wish the o-ring was dantier but it definitely makes a statement. Good quality leather and construction. As others have said, the tighter of the two settings is a bit tight but it's not uncomfortable to wear around for me.  Recommended for sexy punk/fetish wear."
4.0,"Product is as described , nice pin."
4.0,"Love the style and comfort, but the fabric starts to pill fairly soon after several washes.  Doesn't look so new anymore, but I still like it.  XL is a fairly close fit for me, 44&#34; bust, 34&#34; waist, 43&#34; hips."
4.0,Beautiful a little smaller that I thought but beautiful
4.0,Works very nicely with boat top dress to make it seem a little more dressy
4.0,"These were so cute. Material was a good quality.  I had to return because I ordered true to size (as many reviews suggested) and they would have fit, but on the tighter side.  I prefer my pajamas slightly looser for comfort. I also regularly wear extra small or small."
4.0,The dress is cute but the fit was a little to snug for me.  I'm passing it along to a friend.
4.0,"Comfortable, soft and super light weight! My wife got it for just a trial and it turns out to be super good. It’s runs a little big but she’s is happy with this! Good for hikes and the best part is - it has pockets!"
4.0,Did its job.
4.0,They are going to do well on a trip.  Pretty versatile.  Goes with dressy garments as well as casual.  Simple but well made.
4.0,"This is a nice hat, its just a bit small for my head. (Size 7 5/8) I did manage to get the last two snap-back buttons on though. I think it'll be fine once I break it in."
4.0,"This top is super comfy, I'm in love with this fabric!!! I will say I have a long torso and had hoped that it would be longer but this is a problem that I'm used to. My only real complaint is that I'm busty and this shirt shows about a third of each tit in the armpit side. My bra will definitely be showing but I really only got it for comfort reasons so this doesn't matter to me."
4.0,"This dress is beautiful and really comfortable, but had a slight loser fit than expected... I paired it with a belt to give it a little more shape and it's the perfect summer dress, very flattering! I'm 5ft 7in about 145, I bought a medium, but maybe could've gone with a small."
4.0,"The fabric is a bit see-through in certain lights and angles, but the design is cute and I still wear them all the time."
4.0,"It's a cute sweater, not see through but thinner fabric than I expected. It runs large and it's a boxy style so I suggest ordering a size down. I ordered a L and its still a bit big. It is also cropped which the photo doesn't represent. Not worth $25, but I'll keep it. It will be nice with jeans."
4.0,good quality.<br />pretty close to carhartt for half the price
4.0,Great fabric content and stays up without being too tight.
4.0,I purchased this item for my daughters to wear under their soccer jerseys on the odd day that it is too cold in Florida.  Very thin (see through) and runs a bit big.
4.0,Well constructed but the picture has faded a lot in a year but still a nice shirt
4.0,"Although a medium was purchased, it fits a little large, but not too bad.  Purchased for cosplay and it's intended use would be to cover bulky clothing which is beneficial on normal usage!"
4.0,"I like the way this looks on, it's a nice coat with a nice cut.<br />It has a good weight to it, perfect for spring nights.<br />I am a 10/12 and ordered the large but it fits big so I suggest to order one size down."
4.0,I love this dress it does run a bit small but I was still able to wear it comfortablyou.
4.0,"Not as quality as I had hoped, but still wear it for working out"
4.0,Beautiful and bright. I was pleasantly surprised at how pretty this bracelet is. Very pleased with this purchase!
4.0,Cute and fits my small head well.
4.0,very high quality wish you made a bigger size I usually wear Xlg
4.0,"Fun lightweight summer or spring top. It is a little see through so I would recommend something underneath it.  A little tight when trying to put it on like it has no give and it tends to ride up when wearing it.  Also, the seam was coming apart on one side when I received the top but I was able to easily fix it because of where it was coming apart."
4.0,Just like picture.. Nice material not thin looks good🙂
4.0,"I really like the fabric and fit of these pants.  They are very comfortable and I'm pleased with the quality.  One reviewer mentioned ""not as good as ones from Costco"" - well these arrived with Costco tags on them, so it's safe to assume they are one and the same.  Living in the desert, I'm also happy with the SPF factor, as I wear these for walking/hiking.  Would order again."
4.0,I sized up for my 6YO but the top barely covers her stomach.  My older child I also sized up and the top is as long as I expected
4.0,"These are super cute and thin, but mine fell off my face one time and the screw popped out. So now I can't wear them anymore."
4.0,"This set is actually really great, very similar to the Set Active or Free People seamless sets. The colors are BAD though- they should get more colors!"
4.0,I love these earrings but I wish the backs were more substantial
4.0,"I didn’t get these as extensions as much as I got them to avoid hearing my seat belt alarm when I wasn’t wearing my seat belt. They work perfectly for that, but they do seem a little thin compared to the vehicle’s seat belt buckle. When I actually wear my seat belt, I wonder if these are as strong as they should be, or if I should remove them when I’m wearing my seat belt. But, they do keep the alarm quiet when I’m not wearing my seat belt."
4.0,"Very comfortable and is great for the winter. However, it is still very long. I bought a small and while it fits my form, length-wise it reaches my knees. I wear it as a dress, which works fine, I get complemented on it a lot."
4.0,"I'm glad I ordered a medium, because the arms are tight as mentioned. I'm normally a women's size small. I did notice that the fit is a little bigger than I want in the body, but it drapes nicely so I don't mind. The shirt is flown and comfortable, yet different and unique. I hope it washes well--if it doesn't I'll come back here and update. Overall I'm very pleased with this shirt for the price."
4.0,"The American flag ones are harder to see through than the camo ones. Overall, a nice, fun product for the price!"
4.0,Light weight material. Easy to dress up or wear casually.
4.0,Keeps me warm and ears protected in coldest of days. Only wish it was fold able for easy storage when not in use.
4.0,Good quality just doesn’t fit quite like I would have hoped
4.0,"Could be a little easier to put on, but still a great buy."
4.0,Cleans pretty decently!
4.0,"My grandson likes them, and says they are true to size.  The quality is average, but then again, they were fairly inexpensive.  I would recommend them.  The colors are a little darker than they look online."
4.0,Material is very light and it’s not very well made but I think it will hold up. Very cute.
4.0,I love this dress! I am 5'10 and 150 lbs so decided to go with the large. It was a little loose at the waist where the upper part and lower part of the dress meet but it's easily fix able with a belt. Would highly recommend this dress; the quality of the fabric was much better than I anticipated. All around a good purchase.
4.0,Son was not comfortable in these
4.0,They are really cute and comfortable
4.0,Pretty good one brass loop already came off where rope runs through but other then that is what I wanted.<br />Wish it lasted little longer but I did pack it full and went on a 6 hour hike.<br />It's still usable so will abuse it more lol
4.0,"Nice belt. A little too light for my tastes, but still pretty good quality."
4.0,comfortable to wear.
4.0,"Good fit, comfortable, good quality and the price was right.  I really like these sandals."
4.0,The bottom isn't as skimpy as many have said.  I think it's an adorable suit!  Especially for the price!
4.0,Thought this was cute but just a little small.
4.0,"I bought these for gym work outs. Nothing special. Very stretchy but if you stretch real far, it becomes see through.  I work out with a workout bra anyway, so not a big deal for me."
4.0,Very large Sunglasses!  They are a bit larger than I expected but nice!
4.0,even though it's small it looks good
4.0,"Very nice, my wife lives it."
4.0,Soft material. They were ok. True to size
4.0,This is a really cute outfit -- my husband especially liked it!<br />I deducted one star because the elastic on the pants is very tight and runs small.<br />I put on a 9 months size on my 2.5 month old baby.  My baby weights about 13 lbs and the waistline is very very tight.
4.0,"I bought this to shoot a recent wedding. It was handy for keeping both camera on my body to switch between. I definitely felt like my cameras weren’t going to fall because of the back up cable! It took a little messing with to get it set up correctly, but that’s to be expected. The padding was comfortable."
4.0,These work great for small alterations. It does bunch a bit on the side but not super noticeable with the multiple color options. They are a great quality also! Only negative is they can’t be removed once placed or it is extremely hard to remove.
4.0,"Cute socks, nice and soft. And come in a nice little box. Very nice socks. Pretty thin however wich makes me wonder how long they will last but that also makes them very breathable. Size was perfect. I think ill get some more later on!"
4.0,"I sprayed both sides of my glasses with this and my glasses didn't fog up all day, even when going from 30F temperatures to 60-70F temperatures multiple times. The bottle is pretty tiny for $15, but a little goes a long way- you really only need 1 spray per side. Another thing to keep in mind is that the spray does leave a residue so you may need to clean your glasses at the end of the day."
4.0,"Gives you and easy way of holding your squars in place, worked for me."
4.0,"I have a small head, they fall off so I took them to the eye doctor to see if he could bend the arms so they wouldn’t. He did and I love them"
4.0,"pretty but not high quality tree pictures but, perfect inexpensive gift for a young girl"
4.0,"Simple enough for everyday wear, and it rests nicely on my collarbone"
4.0,Perfect.  I use these to help keep my hands/joints warm when my arthritis flares. Works well and just what I wanted and needed without covering my fingertips.
4.0,Nice dress but doesn’t have any stretch ..so size up ..not to light or too heavy ..
4.0,Smaller than I expected but cute.
4.0,"I tried these on and loved them. They seem really supportive, and a good amount of compression. However, it's strange that the Amazon ad says it's a women's product, but the product's tag says it's a men's product. Additionally the stitching on the bottom of the leg is coming off a little bit. I'm not sure if I'll try to exchange these or just trim the thread since it's not that bad."
4.0,I followed the recommendations size . It fight to loose
4.0,They run small but the quality is good
4.0,Beautiful. Looks as advertised. Goes well with the matching pendant.
4.0,"This dress is adorable, but it's HUGE on me. I'm an 8/10 in size. I waited too long to return it, so I might take it to a seamstress to see if it can be altered."
4.0,"Good size, has worn well.  I have no idea if the RFID blocking works."
4.0,Snug fit. Great elastic waistband. Lined mesh works well also
4.0,"I loved almost everything about this shirt -- the fit was nice and slim, and it looks sleek and can be dressed up or down. The only thing was that it smelled a little chemically and was a kind of weird synthetic texture that felt kind of odd to me. Definitely recommend this product style-wise, though!"
4.0,"I have wider hips and thighs so the bottom creeps up a bit, I probably could have worn an XL too, but may the top may have been too big."
4.0,Convenient and stores most of my cards
4.0,Way longer than expected.  Went over my knees. Returned.
4.0,Just a typical t shirt
4.0,Very pretty but way too big for me to use as a key ring.  I am giving it to someone who likes big key rings to find her keys.  I hope the bead work stay intact. This is lovely to look at but a bit impractical to use.
4.0,"The shorts were nice, but do run a bit smaller."
4.0,"I was in search of a replacement scarf I had received a few years ago that I love.  This scarf is similar but the color is a little more peach than I had hoped.  It is also not quite as thick as my other one.  It is not that it is bad quality or a bad color, just not what I was looking for. Here is a picture of my scarf and the new one."
4.0,Todo bien. pero deben de agregar más agujeros para respirar
4.0,Put inside teenage granddaughters Easter baskets. They loved them.
4.0,"Really cute. I like it because it's a band style, which means there's nothing poking off of it, which can be really annoying. The black and silver design is nice because it's not necessarily masculine or feminine. My only complaint is that the actual design itself is sort of sloppy and doesn't really look like an actual heart beat."
4.0,"Based on the photos, I was hoping it'd be long enough to be a dress. It was not. It's tunic length to maybe mid hip.  I disliked how see through it was."
4.0,Work very well for noise reduction but they are a little tight.
4.0,The gold hardware makes these boots really stand out. They came in a nice box and fit perfect.
4.0,"There is a thin, tough, plastic-like cover over the design. I like that it helps protect the surface but it also makes the design harder to see."
4.0,Love the color but the shorts are made large<br />The top is okay if I bought these again I would order a large not XL
4.0,[[VIDEOID:76301165e55f7d21919a41828254d1b8]] Received correct item after returning incorrect item.<br /><br />My grandson loves it!!
4.0,"Stunning! Can be dressed up with tights, a sweater and some dressy heels or down with a wide boat neck 3/4 length sleeve top and sandals! Really beautiful and the sequins stay on very sturdily! Looks so lovely from afar as well as close up! Very elegant! Great for work parties especially Christmas and New Year's!  It definitely runs small normally I wear a medium but this is snug and quite oftens times I wear a small. Definitely recommend sizing up!"
4.0,"Came scuffed up, but works perfectly! Completely canceled out blue laser light"
4.0,"Nice for the price. Earrings posts are thick, I can't wear the earrings until I fix that issue."
4.0,"Perfect for the work event!  Very fitted, comfy and just the right amount of sexy."
4.0,"This is an early review, having just worn these once. They look great, feel great, and are very warm. I bought a size 10.5 even though I'm a size 10 to make a little room for thicker socks. They were true to size. I don't even think I'll need thicker socks with these bad boys though. Initially, very pleased.. I'll update this review accordingly if they don't hold up well in the future.<br /><br />Okay, it's been a few weeks since getting them, and they are holding up well. However, the inner faux fur has been matted down, so they are not as plush, comfortable, nor warm as before. I had to insert some ""Little Hotties"" thermal shoe insoles to get them to be warm again. They also helped with the fit, taking up the extra space previously occupied by the formerly plush fur. Adjusted from five to four stars."
4.0,This is great for the price.  I plan to use it as a costume to be April O'Neil. It is flattering and forgiving at the same time since I have not lost my post baby weight yet.
4.0,My sife loves the bag.
4.0,Stay on. Breathable fabric. Good belcro. Just wish they would stretch a little more so its more comfortable for my babies chubby legs.
4.0,They are small for sure. But that's what I expected. Barely covers the essentials with lots of cheek hanging out! Very sexy. Craftsmanship and material appear to be decent. Well worth the money.
4.0,"Super cute! Arrived on time in good condition. My only complaint is the bunny on the front is very hard and tough. Im not sure if it is an issue yet because i havent put it on her yet. Will update once i have.<br /><br />Eta: bunny wasnt much of an issue, and my lo was super cute!"
4.0,Bought it for my nephews star wars gifts for his star wars birthday party.  He loves it and uses it to keep his toys in.
4.0,Treated my boots with Otter Wax Oil several days ago. Seems to work well - time will tell. The treatment sig significantly darken my teak brown boots.
4.0,"Very pretty bag. My daughter hasn't used it yet because it's a Christmas gift, but I know she'll love it. This is a purse for a child between age 6-9. It has beautiful beading, but the strap doesn't seem very sturdy."
4.0,I liked the shirt but I could have went down a size.
4.0,"I love the pendant and that’s why I bought it. The pendant came with a stainless chain, I didn’t really care about it because I already had a gold chain for the pendant. I still wore it as I received it, but few days later the necklace started to show dark stains."
4.0,Super cute just too narrow and small
4.0,I received the cap but not the mask.
4.0,"Very pleased with this pajama set, very comfortable and soft."
4.0,"You get what you pay for with these of course, they’re incredibly cheap although they are REALLY cute. The concept is something i love, and we adore matching jewelry whether it’s cheesy or not lol. However, they are still cheap, and after prolonged wear they get looser and looser due to the way they’re tightened, and the metal bits do show a bit of color change as well. As long as you take them off more often than we do and take care of them, they’d probably last way longer but when we have matching things like this we tend to never take them off. Anyway, very cute, comfortable as expected, Anddd possibly short term but cheap enough that you could just replace them with another set if you choose to. We just might!"
4.0,I usually wear large.. but the large in this dress is larger than than I expected.. May be a medium would have been fine for me.. But still a lovely dress and soft too..
4.0,"Love these!! Great addition to my Cosplay!<br />However, they are HEAVY, so be prepared. They also give the classic pressure behind the ears that headbands usually give, but they tried to design the tips curved outward to alleviate some of the pain. It helps!<br />Again, they are awesome, and I recommend buying them. Just be prepared."
4.0,This is a good product. It didn't go over my knees though
4.0,"I'm 5' 10"" and 200 lbs and large fits perfect in the waist and length. Pockets could be a little deeper but overall a nice pair of sweatpants. Going to buy another pair."
4.0,I ordered a 1910 liberty nickel but i got two very worn nickels a 1902 and 1903 liberty head nickel but they are nice for there age and very worn condition i am happy with my purchase
4.0,"I really like this dress! Quality is good, with heavy material and stitching is nice! I read reviews and sized up two sizes to an XXL. Its a little big around the waist and the belt doesn't fit as snug as I would like, but Im glad I sized up because I don't think the top (bust) would of fit or around the arms.I bought a little petticoat to go under and Im glad I did. It gives it just a little bit more flare around the bottom. I highly recommend this dress!"
4.0,Love that it has socks attached. The quality is thick and very warm.
4.0,"This sweater is very nice and I love the material but, for a men’s large, it was too small."
4.0,"The good things:<br />The watches are gorgeous, far beyond what I expected, really.  I was planning on cutting the straps off of them and putting beadwork instead, but the straps are actually really durable and decently nice looking, so I think I may remove them and use them for fastening other things.  The watches do look exactly like they were shown looking in the pics.<br /><br />The bad things:<br />There were a few problems.  The red one arrived broken.  It's ticking and ticking, like I got it in the mail.  Even with the dial pulled out and stoppered with a plastic bit.  The dial also can't be used to set it.  So the time will always be inaccurate and eventually the battery will run out.<br /><br />They gave me two aqua-colored watches, so I'm missing the hot pink one.  For me, this actually works out, since I liked the aqua color better, really, but they didn't give me all of the watches in the picture."
4.0,"I loved the way these pants fit me. I do wish they had come in a petite size, as I had to have the pants cut off and him because I am a little on the short side. But other than the links, I love the way they feel."
4.0,I like this belt and I’m gonna get other colors 🤗
4.0,"It's not tiny, but the small is a little smaller than what I expected.  It still fit.  Delivery took longer than the rest of the random items I ordered."
4.0,I could find a lot of reasons to fault this shirt if I were going to use it for anything besides a night shirt. On the other hand they are the best dang night shirt I had ever worn.
4.0,"Item arrived as described, although a bit tight for fit. I recommend ordering a size larger. I will probably order another in a larger size in a while."
4.0,"It’s north face, it’s a bit expensive but you get what you pay for:)"
4.0,Giving four stars only because I thought it was black.
4.0,This was a gift and she loved it Thank you.
4.0,"It’s a little bigger than I thought it’d be, but looks exactly like in the picture. Feels cheap but It’s expected based on price. Overall it’s a good necklace."
4.0,Nice color but a little short and small for me
4.0,This dress is beautiful and soft and seems to be pretty well made.  for me it is a little on the shorter side. Im 5'7&#34; and with flats its a few inches off the ground. I ordered a large because I'm very busty. It fits but the sleeves are pretty baggy so i roll/fold them up for more of a half sleeve look.
4.0,"I got the yellow macaron cat, very cute but a bit heavy and came missing the tail :("
4.0,"works fairly well.  Not great, but good!"
4.0,"I bought this for my girlfriend,  and it looks amazing! I know its a man made stone but everyone else thinks I paid a fortune for it!"
4.0,Product fit perfect and was on time as promised.
4.0,Great at holding in leaks
4.0,It was smaller than expected. I would recommend sizing up to get the loose look. It is very low cut but cute.
4.0,Very thin material and a little large.
4.0,Pretty good. I have a fuller chest and this gave support workout creating a uniboob under my clothes. Can definitely use on most exercise machines like stepper and elliptical without fear. Haven't  really run in it myself but think it could hold up fairly well. Hard to find something that is as supportive for a full chest that is under $40. This is a good find.<br /><br />Please let amazon know if this review was helpful.
4.0,"I love the design on this checkbook cover, but it is better suited as a datebook cover.  It lacks the notched out flap to hold your place in the check register and there is no wallet insert for duplicate checks - you have to buy that seperately. It's a perfect design so that I KNOW which checkbook is my business account (Purrfect Solutions, LLC)"
4.0,"I love the breathable modal fabric and the XL size fits me perfectly with my 42 in hip measurement. I have to say, it's refreshing that they put that soft hem around the edges of the leg openings. So many panties put lace or tight elastic there, so the softness is wonderful.<br /><br />I'm taking away a star from perfect because this cut makes me feel like an old lady.  I really hope they start to offer different styles like boyshorts. A nice wide lace waistband would help make them feel prettier, too."
4.0,"looked just as pictured, has held up pretty good over time too. gave it to my gf about a year ago and still looks good"
4.0,"Cute. Got the Dark Red & it's a vibrant &#34;American Beauty&#34; Rose red. Am 5'6, 170lbs, 40D & I got the Large. Should've gone a size up but reviews suggested otherwise. Is just tight enough in the tatas that I think twice about wearing it. Can be belted & blouses to give a bit of a dressier look & that's nice. Otherwise the A-line is not entirely flattering. Is lined & pretty well made buuuut...just don't like it enough to buy in another color."
4.0,Great band. Color does faded/ rub off. But otherwise good product
4.0,"My daughter loved receiving this shirt for her birthday, however the picture's color is a bit off and the shirt itself is slim so it won't last long. I'd size up."
4.0,"The screw wouldn't hold at all. The coin was just rattling around loose in the holder when I first received this money clip. I had to put the thing in a clamp/vise until the superglue I used to secure it dried. It's actually holding together very well. I'm happy with it, now. But it wasn't the quality of workmanship I was expecting."
4.0,Fits perfectly whether it's on the hips or waist line. Very comfortable. Love it!!!!
4.0,"Very light and durable. I am not crazy about the shape of the frames in front, but this doesn't affect the quality of the glasses."
4.0,This is so cute and comfortable. I am only giving it four stars because the hood makes it annoying for running because it blows into my face in the wind. But I could see this being perfect for indoor workouts and I also love it for wearing casually.
4.0,Cool but the chain is pretty cheap it broke easily...but my daughter doesn't care she uses it for a good luck charm.
4.0,Nice quality. Runs a but small
4.0,"I love these pants! They are so adorably classy and stylish. Great price and I recommend highly. I would've given a 5 star but they were slightly small in the waist and I bought a Large, though i usually wear a Medium. Other than that they were perfect!"
4.0,"I knew the name makes it more appealing but after erasing them for a while and taking them off I can still see the world in a reddish tint. No thanks, I'll stick to black lenses."
4.0,Great material and nice length for my 5'4.5 height. I have only worn once. Will see how it holds up.
4.0,a little wide but super cute. This is style you just have to have and it is good for any occasion. The price was great!!
4.0,"got it for halloween, worked out ok"
4.0,My son loves space rockets and this keychain is very well made and cute. But we had to replace the batteries (the batteries that came with the rocket did not work).
4.0,My smaller dog does not play much with this toy. May be more interested if he didn't have other toys.
4.0,Pantyhose material. Good for a costume but wouldn’t recommend for all day wear.
4.0,"I ordered the 12-18 month mittens for my nearly two year old.  She is small, so these fit great.  We will probably be able to wear them next year as well.  The mittens come off pretty easily if put on over the jacket.  When I put them on her first, then put on the jacket, they stay on great.  Seem to be warm and I like that the palm side is waterproof so she can play in the snow.  Overall, I would buy them again."
4.0,"I had to replace the battery when I got it, because it kept losing time. It is better now, but still don't keep great time. Otherwise, I  love it's design!"
4.0,"This hat is a bit stiff and high for my taste, but it appears strong and will likely last a long time."
4.0,"I like the length and fit. I am 5’ 6 1/2”, about 150 lbs. the jacket is just right, not too snug or loose. I will likely wear it with jeans and a button down blouse, for work or dinner out."
4.0,"Fits nice but it was too long for me, I needed something shorter in the back."
4.0,A little small for my head but good quality.
4.0,This dress is super cute. I went based off measurements since there were no reviews yet when I purchased so I had no guidance. The dress runs a little smaller then I was hoping with little stretch. The length is perfect though. I am keeping the dress for when I eventually lose 5 to 10 lbs. I weigh about 185 and am 5'0.
4.0,Nice pair of leggings. Daughter really likes them. Super comfortable.
4.0,Nice slim wallet with lots of slots for cards. Don't really notice it in my back pocket like my old wallet.<br />Still trying to organize it to suit my daily use. Two photo pockets hold my driver license and my work ID card.  Still tough to fit dollar bills into pocket since it is barely longer than the bills!
4.0,Nice gloves for the winter season! I did scotch guard them to make sure they are waterproof but they seem like a good solid glove
4.0,Overall it was good value for the money however some of the trays could have been better inspected by the QA team before sold as first quality product.
4.0,"The sunglasses are in great condition, no cosmetic wear, and they came with a small cloth bag to store them in. However, the image is not consistent with the product. I was looking for the specific pair shown, but that is not what I received. The lenses on the ones depicted are pretty cool: they're reflective, have a neat blue tint to them, and they give everything you look at a nice warm tone. I know this because I already own a pair of them. The pair I received have standard black lenses. They give everything more of a bleak tone, not nearly as nice. I very much prefer the other lenses and wish the picture of the product matched the actual product in every detail."
4.0,"Nice a pretty, just what I was looking for"
4.0,"Its nice and made well but its a little smaller than what is shown on the model. It fits me, but if I were to wear it like the model, there isn't really any extra length to get that slight 'slouch' look. I don't have a large head but it is s little bigger than an 'Asian' size.<br /><br />But its a very nice hat overall."
4.0,"I bought this for travel, I really like It! It holds a good amount of cargo and is very light weight. I wish there were instructions to show how to take it from small pack to backpack. It took me a few min to figure out, but instructions would help!"
4.0,"Earrings were larger then expected, but they are easy to wear and love the color of the hearts"
4.0,"Update, have Received my package."
4.0,The fabric is too fancy and you can see throw.
4.0,"I got these sandals because I was looking for something that looks nice but comfortable for my feet. I live in the Florida Panhandle, and sandals are the most often used footwear for most of the year. These sandals help with high-arch issues, and I believe they are just a tad too high for me. I have somewhat high arches and love that added support, but these are designed for extremely high arches.<br /><br />They are relatively comfortable regardless and seem to be very well made. They have outstanding cushion support in the ball of the foot and heel area. My only real complaint is that they aren't the most comfortable for me, but for those of you that have high arches, these will probably be great! I recommend these sandals!"
4.0,I love these capris! I wear them for hot yoga as well as running and around the house. I have them in xs and small sizes and I wear both but the xs fits a little better. I am 5'4&#34; 120 lbs. The material is stretchy and soft. Very comfortable. I take off one star because they are pretty thick which can get hot.
4.0,"The shirt is super cute, but very small in the arms and stomach area. I’m usually between a small/medium size and had to get a large."
4.0,Very cute top. The shoulder cut outs fit me perfectly. I bought this because of the flowering as I have a flower tattoo on my right shoulder and it looks awesome in this top!
4.0,"Well made.  The instructions for measuring to fit over glasses worked well.  These block the sun very well - on sides as well as front, and there is a slight rim over the top as well.<br />Wish they had come in plain black, but the black pearl actually as sort of black/purple/blue/clear tortoise shell simulation) is atractive and works with most of my clothing.<br />Was surprised to find that these are blue-blockers as well as polarized.  The lenses are not blue, they are grey.  For most people the blue-blocking would be an added bonus; for me it is not.<br />Very convenient to use - better than switching out prescription sunglasses for me.<br />Bulky to carry along, but the soft-sided carrying case can be clipped onto belt or backpack."
4.0,"I ordered a pair of these for my 6 and 3 year old daughters in March.  They have been great.  My 6 year old wears then consistently while swimming.  My 3 year old . . . not as much.  I'd have given it 5 stars, but the back of my 6 year old's has already ripped out and summer isn't even over yet.  For the price, I do find that disappointing.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer this morning and they replied with an offer to replace for $10. I am pleased with that."
4.0,"The outfit is a little big on my kid, but the adjustable strap for the trunks will allow him to grow into it. The hat was too small, but my kid might just have a bug head. Overall it works. He has a different hat he can use. He looked hilarious in this one!"
4.0,"Returned, peplum enhanced waistline. I did not like the look. Product was fine for the price."
4.0,Great for summer evenings.  Just enough for a breeze.
4.0,"I am terrified to wash this one! It is really cute and I got a lot of compliments on it so far. I would wash it inside out and line dry because the decal on the front is very delicate. They even put some tissue on it before shipping to help protect it, that got stuck and was difficult to pull off of the front! The only downside is the fabric is pretty scratchy and not very comfortable but can't complain too much."
4.0,"I love the romper. It fits nice at the top, the shirts are more spandex like biker shorts, I ended up putting black shorts on over them and it worked fine."
4.0,"Very flexible, soft material that's perfect to sleep in and won't just fall out. Only issue for me is that my lobes are on the thinner side so the tunnels actually extend past the edge of my lobe on the bottom. Not a big issue though, still looks good."
4.0,Pretty but I don't have hips and they flare on the sides. Had to return.
4.0,"Very cute. Fits well everywhere, except is a little tight across the back of my shoulders when I move. I live in Houston, so weather never gets super cold, so perfect coat for weather here. It was a good buy for the price."
4.0,This is great for leggings I am 5'3 and 128 I ordered a small.  I could have ordered an extra small but I like things a little loose.  The material is nice and not see thru.  You can wear it in the winter time with boots or in spring with sandals very versatile. The sleeves come to my elbows and they are gathered giving it a cute feminine look. I only gave this product 4 stars because the stitching was sloppy see my photos.  I would purchase from this company again because the top is cute and perfect with leggings.
4.0,great stuff I use it for alot of things hold fast and strong will order as soon as I need
4.0,"I love the design of these. The beads each have two spring-loaded bearings that make it a little easier to remove the jewelry - no snap ring pliers required. The only issue I had was with the 16g CBRs - they were made as well as can be but at 1.2mm, the ring is just too flimsy for this purpose. I replaced all of the CBRs with 12g, 3/8"" Dia. rings. You can also use circular barbells(horseshoes)."
4.0,"Me encanta, esta hermoso."
4.0,Fit perfect its ok looking ring.
4.0,Very comfortable  hadn't tried Vionic before but will definitely try them again !
4.0,My first pair fell apart (screws came out) so I ordered another pair.  So far so good.  They look nice.
4.0,"But I don't think you will get a lot of circulation support. The socks are light and they don't make your feet sweat. They aren't binding at all. If you like to wear socks, these are great for everyday wear."
4.0,The pattern was wonderful and looked awesome however it was too small for my husband and the material was super thin. It was more the weight of a t-shirt but had a sweatshirt feel inside. Definitely not your typical sweatshirt weight. Unfortunately we had to retun since it didn't fit.
4.0,"These are great! They fit perfectly and I would definitely buy again. One issue though, that is more of a personal issue is that the one with all the little diamonds is way too chunky for my face; it looked smaller in the picture. Other than this minor issue, this product was exactly what I wanted, and I will be wearing all of these, even the one I complained about lol."
4.0,This is a decent looking jogging suit but be aware that they run very small. My child is a normal size 12 year old so I ordered an 11/12. It wasnt just a little small it was very small more like for a 7 year old. I just ordered 2 sizes up which is 15/16. Hopefully that will work.
4.0,The accessories were too big and there should have been an instruction sheet as to placement. The costume was also too large in areas
4.0,"It’s a very nice dress nice fabric covered zipper.  It even allowed for my large arms, but I have 42 DD breast and it doesn’t fit comfortably in the cups. If there had been another size option I would’ve purchased it."
4.0,Really cute jacket. I sized up but still a little tight in the arms.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:6aa9c42c344a68b40398b9be137597ea]] I am a medium. I got a large. ( bc my belly big n didnt want to snug. But I shd hv gotten a small
4.0,"I thought this was going to be a helpful gift to my sister-in-law, a big skier.  It was not quite what I imagined, though that is more my fault than anyone else's.  She said she liked it alot but you may have to keep in mind that this requires a &#34;coordinated look,&#34; something my sister's style sense doesn't adhere to.  If you know someone who likes to wear the same color all at once, and who would not be involved actively in a winter sport, this is a nice item."
4.0,This is a pretty top. Received many compliments first time I wore it. Ideal to wear tank top under as it is a little see-through. Pairs well with blue jeans for casual nice or black work slacks for office professional attire.
4.0,Comfy keeps everything in place
4.0,"Super cute and has plenty of space to hold a ton of cards and even some cash. The only downside is that sometimes cards get stuck below the pockets and it’s extremely hard to pull them out. Other than that, great purchase!"
4.0,"I was worried about the fit when I ordered, but it's adjustable and looks great. Just be careful when out and about. Not sure how strong the chain is."
4.0,missing carbon filters
4.0,Nice pair too runs big thou even at the lower part it’s not fitted and sexy I ordered a extra large 220lbs
4.0,Super cute and fun! Doesn’t fall off your head which is nice
4.0,Stylish statement without saying a word!
4.0,"These are cute but I felt that they were too big for my face so I returned them, still good quality from Quay"
4.0,"This just arrived this morning and so far it looks fine.  It's a halloween/dress up outfit, so it's not the greatest quality ever made.  However my two year old loves it.  I bought the 3T size because I read other reviews saying the size runs small.  I also wanted the outfit big enough that I can put a long sleeve shirt and pants underneath for when we go trick or treating.  I plan to run it thru the was before having her wear it.  I'll update the review if that should ruin it..."
4.0,Like all Zoot products this Jersey was well made. But the sizing was a bit off. I'm medium build and wear a large in the tri shirts and figured a large in the top as well but would rather have it more fitted and returned it with Hope's that medium would restock. The discounts Amazon provides every so often too made it 25% cheaper during the time I purchased it so that was all the incentive i needed to purchase. The three pockets in the back are the usual Jersey size. Was hoping for a zippered pocket but nada. Sadly we will have to try this again!
4.0,My wife liked the suit but it was way too small. The suit wouldn't even fit over her hips (which are not that big even after three kids). Disappointed that it didn't fit. Would advise anyone interested in buying this suit to take measurements then check the chart and possibly going up one size for ensuring the right fit.
4.0,A nice skirt for the price
4.0,"Loved the fit and style of this costume.  However, before the night was over the seams under and on my arm began to separate.  Worth the $9.99 that I paid for it."
4.0,"Cute wallet/ mini purse, zipper is somewhat difficult to zip once things are put in."
4.0,Larger than expected but I still love them
4.0,This necklace is lovely. The beading is very nice. The clasp and connectors feel cheap and will need to be treated delicately.
4.0,"I love this dress! My bridesmaids will be wearing this in my wedding next month! It came in a little earlier than the expected which was nice. The top is nice because you can tighten it to however tight you want it, but there is an inner skirt that is a little tight. My sister usually wears a size 6-8 and the 10 fit her, but she couldn't sit down in it! So we had to order her a size 12 and it fits well!"
4.0,Love this tank! It is super comfortable and goes perfecting with my oversized sweater and leggings.
4.0,Not super high quality fabric but fit well and very comfortable.  Don’t know that that’ll last forever bcs the fabric is not very heavy but am enjoying them very much. Reasonably priced for the quality. Would buy them again. There is elastic inside the waistband that prevents them from needing to be pulled up all the time - but doesn’t look like an elastic waistband
4.0,"Usually you get one pair of statement earrings for this price. They’re good for what you pay for. I was opening the packs and 1 metal piece that goes through your ear fell out so I just glued it back into the earring. Other than that, everything is great so far."
4.0,"The chokers all fit perfectly. I love that I have 6 different styles to choose from and that they are all black. I can choose which ever one is right for the dress that I will be wearing on date night. The fit around my neck is just right, I barely even know that I am wearing them. I used to wear chokers as a teenager so it is nice to be able to have some again for a night out on the town. I am very happy with my purchase.<br />I purchased this item at a discounted price for my honest review."
4.0,"This is a very fun boho style bracelet to wear but it does tend to roll around my wrist a bit more than I prefer, so I won't wear it to work any longer.  It is very shiny and the details very fine"
4.0,"After reading a review stating that the purchaser was on the smaller size and a size L was too small, I ordered a L, considering myself a size M at 5'7"" and 145. The sweater itself is nice. I bought it for work, as it could pass for professional in the photos. In reality, the lining is so prominent that it looks more like a hoodie within a hoodie. The hood is oversized, and the sweater is huge on me. It is warm, however. and fairly heavy. Over all, a solid item to keep warm, but size down to avoid looking 2 sizes larger on top."
4.0,The hat is nice. It has that dye-died look like you have worn it for years.<br />It is well made and fits well.<br />The only issue I had was the chemical order.<br />I washed it well in warm water and it is gone now.
4.0,"I love these jeans! I'm 5'10"", 190 lbs, usually wear a size 12. They were long enough, great fit all over except a bit tight in the waist (I'm a 31 so I was surprised this felt like a 29 or 30). Good quality and good price."
4.0,"I was worried it wouldn’t fit right but it fit perfectly! I love it and it’s just as I expected it to be. It even came in a couple days early,10/10 recommend"
4.0,Loved the glasses.  It has helped my night vision somewhat...especially when it is raining
4.0,So far is protecting our deck from the sun pretty good.
4.0,Comfortable to wear and keeps glares from being bothersome while driving.
4.0,It's very pretty. A bit more delicate than I thought it would be and the length is shorter than I thought but I am very happy with it. I'm just afraid of breaking the chain. The wings of the birds are brushed silver and the bodies are polished. All in all it's my favorite necklace because of the symbolism alone.
4.0,"Purchased this back in 2016. Sadly, it finally gave up on me in 2020. I notice it starts fading and I changed the battery but it doesn’t display anything anymore. What I didn’t like was the strap. Every time I put it on it irritates my wrist for a long time. It’s a great reliable watch though I wish I could change up the straps to a leather one. Nonetheless I can’t complain. It’s great casual watch.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Neat stopwatch<br />Tells the day and date<br />Small and reliable<br />Cool colors<br />Last long time<br /><br />Con:<br />Strap is irritable"
4.0,I really like the look of these but after being an XL in most of my other athletic pants I found myself swimming in these. I would size down but they are super cute bike shorts!
4.0,"This shirt is actually a true 3XL size and good quality.  Unfortunately I ordered a 3X because all the previous shirts I've ordered from other places at 2X ( which is my size ) were more like a large or 1X at best.  So this is too large for me, but I kept it anyway, and my wife wears it as a night shirt."
4.0,My husband ordered this for him but it was way too feminine for him. I wear it and do like it.
4.0,"The bracelet is pretty, but bigger than I thought. The bracelet arrived broken, but the company was VERY good about replacing it."
4.0,Super warm and cute slippers. I am about to order my second pair as the sole is coming off the set I got in 2015.
4.0,Has a very good weight. Looks to be good quality as well. It has features of watches that cost 10x more.
4.0,I haven't worn it yet.  It is pretty though....a bit smaller than I expected (size of stones/jewels) but it's OK...I can see where you may need to add another necklace with it to get more of an impact.  Hope the stones don't fall out as others here have stated.
4.0,It's not a material I was expecting but it fits quite nicely and I will definitely wear it.
4.0,Product fit very large for the size..however the colors of the shirt are bright and vibrant.
4.0,"Love the watch, only 4 stars since it feels really cheap the belt, but is comfortable! Definitely recommend it!"
4.0,Awesome item but it doesnt clean easy
4.0,"Works real well when a hat is a little big, but its a little difficult to remove the piece from the sticky side."
4.0,A little small but it will work. Pretty dress
4.0,it would have been nice to have instructions as well as what each black piece does!! Also 2 would have been better so I could have stretched my heels at the same.time. I can't rate the stretch yet until I check it in a day or two. Work on instructions and at least a pair and not JUST A SINGLE ONE!
4.0,Liked the fit and feel.
4.0,"I’d give five stars if they were all cut the same. These are my favorite tanks right now, but the grey one is tailored shorter than the black and white. Stretchy, durable, washes well....awesome. But, even though I love the fabric of the grey, it’s very irritating that it rides up."
4.0,"Do not trust the washing instructions! I was going to use a low heat iron to iron the pleats and the skirt started the melt. The skirt material is super nice and slightly heavy material, but the nylon/spandex in it does not like to be ironed. The packaging I had already thrown away as it was a gift so I couldn't return, thankfully I think I can hid the slightly melted spot, left an iron print, inside a pleat."
4.0,"I must say, these are simple and work<br />great for me. The first thing that caught my attention was the anti-slip feature. I no longer have to worry about slipping in the shower and possibly injuring myself. It gives me peace of mind knowing that I have a reliable and safe pair of slippers for the bathroom.<br /><br />The quick drainage holes at the bottom of the soles are also a great feature. I don't have to worry about standing in a puddle of water for too long because the water drains out quickly. The shoes dry pretty fast too, which is convenient.<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied with these. They are functional and get the job done. They are also quite affordable, which is a plus. If you're looking for a reliable and anti-slip pair of shoes for the bathroom, I would definitely recommend these."
4.0,"The dress was as pictured, pretty.. the fit was slightly larger than expected. I'm considering returning for a smaller size."
4.0,Very nice - but a little more fancy than I wanted for every day.
4.0,One of the rings I bought was not strong enough to stay clasped and I lost it. Very sad 😞. Could you send me a new one that is stronger. All my other sines have never had this problem. And I thing it was defective.
4.0,"The dress was way to big, had to return it ."
4.0,"This is great, i love the way it fits me however the material is a bit odd, it reminds me of a swimsuit material? But aside from that, it fits well and seems to be alright quality for the price, i wore it to an anime festival and got a lot of compliments!"
4.0,Good cap but could have been better without the elastic band.
4.0,Dress was fantastic but arrived with a black mark on the fabric so I returned. Light and airy fabric and fit was perfect. Detail on bodice is really pretty and makes this dress look more expensive than it really is.
4.0,So much thicker and heavier than I thought it would be.
4.0,"For my wife, this dress was too small in the hip area, pear-shaped, usual size 18. Otherwise, she would kept it."
4.0,Item was too small. Exchanging for a larger size. Otherwise great value for the price. This but not paper likein the way some costumes are.
4.0,The fabric was great and was of high quality! It is on the thick size so this would be best work in spring or autumn. There is definitely some stretch and it feels very comfortable on the skin. I ordered my regular size (medium) and the skirt was way past my knees and the sleeves were loose. Maybe order a size down unless you have a large chest. You can get the rest tailored.
4.0,"The boot is beautifully made and the rainbow trim is very pretty.  However, it was way too big for the recipient and had to be returned.  The return was very easy for the gift recipient."
4.0,Daughter loves the shoe.  Nice shoes for the price.
4.0,Pants were too long for me.
4.0,"I love the style of this shirt, but would probably go up a size if i ordered again. Only because it’s tight on my chest (36DD). Otherwise, fits great."
4.0,"These were made out of a thinner material than I expected. The elastic is thick and has a good stretch, which is good because it is tighter than I expected too. I can't wear them to sleep, but I didn't buy them for that, I bought them for when I do hair masks, so that is okay."
4.0,"these fit great and stretched my ears as intended, i would suggest looking for a (1ga taper) because going from the 2ga to the 0ga taper (included in the kit) was so brutal and ive suffered minor ear ripping because of it but i suppose i should have stayed at 2's longer then 3 weeks before jumping like that, but long story short they are (now) fine and not hurting and i intend to most likely go to the 00 included in the kit in the next month or two so i can get some awesome tunnels, look up pinwheel flesh tunnels they are so sick!<br />thank you :)"
4.0,They are what they are I don't know what else to say. It stays on my wrist and doesn't fall off.👍 they came promptly
4.0,Dress runs a lot larger than expected.
4.0,"The description says that I would get 20 completely random pins for each bag ,however I bought 2 bags and they were the exactly same pins in each bag"
4.0,"I'm a 0/12 in Torrid, L/12, 14 in Old Navy. 38H bra size and the X-large fit. I just wanted a suit to tan in the back yard, but I can't be nude as our hilly neighborhood allows everyone to see into each other's yards. I didn't want to spend $$$ on a tanning suit. So I took  chance on this and it fits perfectly. Surprisingly fits my chest. My butt hangs out a bit, but that's ok. Positively surprised."
4.0,"Very comfortable. I would like them better only if they didn't flare so much at the calves, but I do have skinny legs & the flare keeps the capris from looking too tight."
4.0,"I have two other shirts by this brand in a small so I ordered this one. It was huge! Also, way too long. Although I like my t-shirts long this one came almost mid-thigh. It seemed good quality like the other shirts and the color purple was pretty but I had to send it back. A price point of $17.00 to $19.00 would be better for this shirt. For reference I am 5’ - 100lbs."
4.0,"Love the hat n style.  I do have a large head, fits but is snug."
4.0,My daughter loves her seahorses
4.0,Xl was too short and I’m only 5’ 10” at 210 lbs. thick material is a little heavy for a t shirt
4.0,"The buckles are weird, but with slight modifications, worked perfectly for my daughters."
4.0,Fits me perfect the pants are a little long for my daughter but she is short but other than that they fit great!
4.0,great product. Quality seems to be very good but we have only had it a short time.
4.0,Very neat concept for kids boots.
4.0,This is a good gift to give at any time.  I do think it should be given to someone who is a little as I'm small boned and it was to large for me
4.0,"My son says this is supposed to say &#34;trust me, I'm the Dr&#34; instead. NOt sure but it's a nice quality shirt and he wears it anyway."
4.0,"The one thing that struck me first about this headband was the !00% satisfaction guarantee that the company offered. It makes me feel as if I am making a risk free purchase. With that said, I really like this headband. It is certainly made of quality material that is both breathable and very absorbent but not too thick or bulky for winter or summer use. The elasticity is wonderful because it won’t easily lose shape and still give you the stretch you need if you have a larger head (like mine) but it has the elasticity to fit small heads securely as well.<br /><br />This is a great camping accessory for holding your hair and not allowing the sweat of the day to drip in your face. The width is perfect and is hard to find with most headbands on the market. My pics will show you that this head band is a little wider the half the length of a standard letter sized envelope pictured next to it, along with the knotted feature of this headband. I wear mine with the knot in the back so I can have the extra coverage around the front my hair and my ears. The little gold “Z” emblem does give it a slightly expensive look so I could see me wearing this with a nice knit skirt and pumps on a bad hair day.<br /><br /> I give it 4 stars (subtracting 1) only because the second online picture should show that it is knotted on one side which I would think if worn in the front would take this headband from unisex as advertised to a more feminine look on a man. However, if worn in the back, where mostly hidden, it is not very noticeable and a man could easily get quality wear from this headband. It is a great headband overall.<br />I received this at a discount price in exchange for my honest review and I have not been paid in any way to express my unbiased opinion"
4.0,Nice hat. The rivet that holds the size adjuster in back digs into your head a little bit
4.0,Exactly what i needed for my day trip to the mountains. Didn’t give it a complete 5 stars bc I had trouble with getting the usb cord to work. Possible user error lol . Great bag overall
4.0,"I wore this dress in green to my little brother’s wedding. It was cute & comfortable. Unfortunately, it was only available in large, so it was a tad too loose. The button clasp broke upon first wear; it’s not good quality but it’s good for a one-time wear."
4.0,I wanted an Alex & Ani but they do not have a dance charm. This is same good quality but gold a slight different shade.
4.0,Fit was as expected. We haven’t washed it yet. We purchased this for a white party during our vacation. Appears to be well-constructed. Slightly see through. I preferred The look of the shirt without the collar. It seemed to lay nicer around the neck.
4.0,Fits a little snug up top but very loose at the bottom
4.0,Good buy and cute.
4.0,"As with the other reviews, ran a little small in the arms for layering, but will be perfect for cool summer nights. I am 5’7”, 160#, US 12-14 and glad I got a Large. Love the funnel-neck like collar, pockets and the hem is high-low—mid thigh in the front to just above my knee in the back.<br />Washing—not thrilled with the air dry instructions, but for the price and features good trade off."
4.0,Nice for cheap jewelry
4.0,Great sentiment for the graduate
4.0,Purchased for my god son - he loves it.
4.0,"Love it!  It is warm and I love the hood and all of the pockets.  What reduced it from 5 to 4 stars for me is the length of the ties at the bottom.  They hang too low and catch on things, so I have to work to tie them up just right."
4.0,Bought this for my husband and he really likes it. The material was different from what I expected and the white inset is attached. He plans to remove the onset and just wear with a white tshirt.
4.0,"I would have liked it to be a it looser but the small still fits me. I am 5'3&#34; and about 135 pounds. I really do like this shirt though, it looks awesome!"
4.0,"I like the design and simplicity of the watch and hope that the water resistance feature will be improved upon, to avoid fogging of the screen while using the watch outdoors during soccer practice."
4.0,Runs small - size up 1.<br />Looks super cute though!!
4.0,Great for a night out. Love the price if I lose it no harm done. I'll just order another. Clear  Nail polish def wks. On the stones.
4.0,My granddaughters love them but they are big.
4.0,These are comfortable and stylish gloves. I bought these to keep my hands warm on the cold days I'm outside with my dogs. The touchscreen capability is hit or miss but I don't use it that often anyway. Fit well.
4.0,Kind of like a wetsuit and you probably good use it for a warm water dive. While working out it definitely makes you sweat more. You have to monitor your body temp as you could overheat in it. Drinking water becomes more important. Overall I like and have been using it.
4.0,Good for migraines
4.0,Super cute. Shrink in dryer a little so maybe just lay flat to dry but overall we are happy!
4.0,Laces look good!
4.0,"It came a little small, but I almost expected that from the other reviews. We decided to keep it anyways. It's just a little short in the sleeves and my daughter doesn't mind that. Works great!"
4.0,"Super cute. I realized it was trying to mock Chanel though. I only use the real deal, so gave it to a friend who could care less. She just liked it."
4.0,was too tall for me and folds over
4.0,Cute and casual. Tight around the hips if you have any. Makes your butt a little flat due to tight hip spread. Order a size or two larger if you get these.
4.0,Completely missing the sliver pair which is a bummer as that was the pair I mainly ordered for but otherwise the others are fine and shipping was on time
4.0,Are very prety just a little small. I plan to give them for christmas presents.
4.0,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
4.0,"They are not a 5 star item. One popped off of my son's shoe because the center circle broke. But otherwise, they are great. Thankfully they provide quite a few so we had extra."
4.0,"I had a bit of trouble adjusting it for my upper ear, because it's a bit large. But with some persistence and gentle molding, I got it to fit. I'm sure it would fit perfectly over the cartilage part of my ear, but I want to wear it with an ear cuff that sits there already. I do like the way it looks and while it is a bit &#34;crude&#34;, it doesn't have any sharp edges and I like that it has some dimension to it.<br /><br />When I first ordered this earcuff, it got lost in the mail, but the instant I emailed the seller, it was replaced and I received the new one quickly. I think this speaks well for the seller.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars due to the fit issue, which will be a problem for some people. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars."
4.0,"I love the bracelets, just not the selection which is just luck of the draw. My daughter and I give them as inspirational gifts as we tell them about the women from Nepal who make these beauties by hand."
4.0,Liked everything about this product.  Even made the TV clearer
4.0,"Loved the fabric so soft. Shirt is roomy, but the shorts were a little short in the crotch guessing more of a junior fit"
4.0,Its worth buying.
4.0,"I’m pretty indifferent about this purchase.  Ordered a 36C (my true size) and I feel the 36 measurement is too small, and the C cup is a little big.  I had to put an extender in the band just to get it to fit, at least until it stretches out.<br /><br />That being said, it’s a pretty bra, and it stays in place sooooo much better than the Maidenform bandeau strapless bras.  It also has convertible, removable straps, making it much more flexible in usage.  I’d buy this bra over a bandeau any day.  Still holding out for a great strapless that fits like a glove, stays in place no matter how much I move, and doesn’t cost $75!"
4.0,"I may have received a used item. There were deodorant stains on the armpits of my dress.<br /><br />The dress has a lot of stretch and the color is great. The stitching in the dress was below average quality as you will see in the photos. The seams however, are sturdy and it seems like they will hold up with excessive stretch."
4.0,The item was cute but we took the advice of the Amazon description that the item fit small so we ordered one size up. Big (no pun intended) mistake.  The next size up was huge. Should've ordered the medium like we intended.
4.0,"bottoms fit me great, the top was a little big but it may only be because i was scared to order a small because the bottoms would be too small in me. it fits fine though i love it and it is very comfy!"
4.0,"Beware these are not Nylon / Spandex as product info describes.  These are polyester / cotton blend ripstop (0% elastane).  But all in all, a good pair of shorts.  Functional for medium duty builds and DIY applications.  Not fitted to leg, they kind of fan out over thighs a little bit, but that makes them arguably more comfortable.  I’m a tight size 34, really a size 35, so I ordered a 36 and glad I did (because there’s no stretch and they might shrink marginally in wash."
4.0,My daughter was Poppy with these leggings for Halloween. They fit pretty well and are well made. They were a tiny bit big in the waist and length she is normally a size 6 or 7 so if your little one is small they might be a little big in the waist or too long. They worked super well for her costume though and she can wear them again!
4.0,"Works great at sun protection. The strap gets on my daughter's nerves, and she hates for me to fasten it, so I would prefer it without that, but that's just my preference."
4.0,Delicate ring. Nice looking. Adjustable.
4.0,I loved it it's just a little small other than that it's very nice.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:3e054decb92a0d1a24b7a0308eed6167]] Short summary:<br />This XXL-size vest fits well, but only because I wear medium-size shirts. There is a size mis-match to this vest.<br />Has USB-charging cable attached to one of the two pockets.<br />A power bank (not included) can only have a maximum width of 3-1/4 to 3-3/8, otherwise, it will not fit into the pocket. If a power bank does not fit into the pocket, then I will need to carry it in my hands while wearing the vest.<br /><br />More details:<br /><br />This heated vest, with USB-charging cable attached to the left pocket, is XXL-size.<br />I wear medium size shirts/sweaters. This vest fits me well.<br />note: I have family members who wear large-size shirts/sweaters. This vest is a tight fit on them.<br /><br />To use this, I:<br /><br />1. Attach the USB plug (which is attached to the vest) into my own power bank.<br /><br />2. Press and hold down the power button (located on front of the vest, at upper-left side) for about 3 seconds.<br /><br />3. The button then lights up red.<br />note: once button lights up red, pressing it again will get the button a white color. pressing it a 3rd time gives it a blue color. Then, it repeats (i.e. red ---> white ---> blue)<br /><br />note #2: the red option gives 70-75 degrees Celsius<br />the white button gives 60-65 degrees Celsius<br />the blue button gives 40-45 degrees Celsius<br /><br />4. When I am done wearing the vest, I hold down the power button, and after about 3 seconds, it turns off.<br /><br />When I select the red option, I can feel the vest becoming warm in about 3-5 minutes.<br /><br />The vest has two pockets. One pocket has the attached USB charging cable.<br />Besides the sizing, the other issue to note is that this vest has small pockets. I measure a pocket to be 4-3/4 inches deep, and 3-3/8 inches wide. I have small-size hands, and can barely fit my entire hand inside the pocket.<br /><br />I have multiple power banks, of various widths. The widest width power bank that will fit inside the pocket has a width of 3-1/4 inches.<br /><br />The inside of the vest is smooth to the touch.<br /><br />There is a 1-page instruction manual. It includes washing instructions: can hand-wash or machine-wash; air dry; do not ""kneed or beat"".<br /><br />I followed the wash instructions. After it was dried, I attached my power bank, and the vest worked.<br /><br />Overall, this heating vest works for me - the size fits, I have power banks that fit into the pocket, and the vest heats up as expected."
4.0,The Lord is coming
4.0,Dress is cute for toddler. Quality of material seems a bit cheap. Hopefully it will be ok when washed.
4.0,"Visor is great for keeping sun from eyes! Cap part small, but fits, lightweight.  Love color.."
4.0,Perfect way to stay warm during the cold weather
4.0,Best bang for your buck. Simplistic needs gives you day/date/time/timer/alarms.  My only wish about this would be a brighter light for night viewing.
4.0,"Pictured exactly as shown, but is thinner like a t-shirt, instead of a warm hoodie.  Gave as a Christmas gift and it looks good."
4.0,"The workmanship is fine, but the fabric is a bit less substantial than I wanted, but a good summer-weight. I also would have needed to add a stitch or two to keep the bodice wrap closed. Other dresses I purchased didn't need this so I returned. The fit was pretty on-point, but a little looser than I was looking for: I'm 5' 6"" 135 lbs and purchased a Medium."
4.0,Perfect size for my needs....love the easy pouch in front for phone...
4.0,I bought this for my 19 year old Granddaughter she does like it but I was a little disappointed the stones are so small really cant see them
4.0,This was a great piece.  I have worn it quite a bit since I have received it.
4.0,The hats a nice fit and feel good when I put them on my head.
4.0,"My husband usually doesn't wear ties, but he decided to start wearing one to worship services occasionally. These look nice on him. Before these, the last time I'd seen him in a tie was on our wedding day, over 14 years ago. So, I don't have a great deal of comparison to go by, but we like these. He got the chance to try out two different sets. They both have the pink striped tie in them. It's on the sparkly side. The white stripes have silver thread intwined in them, so that adds the glittery look to it. It's definitely one that stands out. One tie has a breast cancer logo on it and the last one is light blue/grey, with dark blue and light grey dot-like squares on it. That one is much more traditional in look. So far, we've been pleased with these."
4.0,Just lovely!! Great value and a nice size.
4.0,"These are comfortable and come in attractive colors.  I use them for around open air events and for exercise.  However, they appear too thin to provide a lot of protection against COVID and I would wear something more substantial if I were entering into a COVID-risk environment."
4.0,If you are looking at a rubber ring to buy it this is a great deal for you. For the cost you get a variety of different colors all with the same quality of work.
4.0,So cute you get too I really love them fits so comfortable
4.0,"Love this, except.the pockets add<br /> ""extra"" to my hips that I dont need!!"
4.0,However color was waaay tooo bright for my liking.
4.0,it look good and this belt buckle is strong
4.0,"I like it. It's ok. It serves it's purpose.  It's very slim. For me that is a good thing because I don't like to carry around big bulky purses. I originally got this thinking my husband could use it but he determined it was too small for him. He doesn't keep a thick wallet but this was way smaller. For me it works perfect because I can just slip in a couple cards or cash that I plan to use for the day and can just slide it in my pocked before heading into the store. I've never been a purse lady. I lose stuff easily.<br /><br />I was expecting it to be a little bit higher quality upon initially seeing it but then once I used it multiple times and really gave it a chance it's proved to be very efficient. Perfect for what I need it for. I love that it is RFID blocking as it provides just a little more comfort for me to not have to worry about the headache of dealing with CC fraud. Banks these days are really good about helping in these types of situations but just dealing with it all is a hassle.<br /><br />It's got 3 card slots on 1 side, license slot on the other and a zipper pouch that opens slightly to allow you to stuff in cash, a check, change a loose key or pictures inside. It's small but it's functional. It seems well made. Mine arrived in a nice black gift box. I am satisfied and I would recommend it to people looking for a small and slim wallet.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this free in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"Nice suit. I am 135#, 36C and petite.  The size 12 was perfect.  As a blonde, these colors are beautiful. I swim 3x a week, so will see how it holds up."
4.0,"fits really lovely. I read other reviews and went with an XL even though I wear a M/L.  a tad bit long, almost like a tunic but still very nice. received many compliments on it from coworkers who rarely comment on my attire"
4.0,"Were a little more flat on my face than expected, but still a fun pair of sunglasses."
4.0,I like the strap it’s very nice and good quality. However the only reason imm giving this a 4 stars Is because I picked a size that I normally get it’s too big for me. So I can’t wear.
4.0,"This is a good cotton bra. Not exactly sexy but it is serviceable and well made -  so far. Not a lot of support,  but it works well in the dark colors. (White and grey I sent back because too see through and nipples showed..) I am 5’6” 120 lbs  and usually wear 34C bra. Got the small because medium was too droopy. I wash on cold, delicate in machine and hang to dry. Undies can last for a  much longer time if you are careful with them (no dryer!) These are pretty pricey and I hope they last. Perfect during the  pandemic when staying home, but  I also wear out and about. I don’t think they would work that well for big-breasted people. Calida is still a good company though I don’t think their products are now made in Germany. Hanro and Calida make great undies and sleep ware."
4.0,Over all this is a really cute and sparkly nose stud.  The only problem is that the bar (before it twists) is too long and hits my septum bone and cant completely go into my nose :(
4.0,So these are the most adorable masks I own only reason I gave 4 stars is they’re definitely a bit big on my face and they’re not adjustable otherwise they’re perfect
4.0,I was very please with this item.  It was a gift for my precious niece. It arrived intact and it was packaged well. The face is a little bigger than I expected but overall I am very pleased.
4.0,The dress is gorgeous but I hated the fabric! It feels like Lycra it’s fits perfect tho and is super sexy
4.0,I love the dress however the zipper is a little cheaply made but still works great and looks great!!!!
4.0,BOUGHT FOR A GIFT AND IT WAS TRUE TO SIZE AND PICTURE.GOOD QUALITY
4.0,"I've bought a few pair of sneakers, and these are the best by far. I did order a size 10 1/2 but it looks like they sent an 11. But still comfy and great for running."
4.0,The setting on this ring is beautiful and the overall look is good.  I have to say I don't think the stone is genuine lapis though because it looks too perfect with no imperfections whatsoever and it looks a little plastic.  If that doesn't bother you (no imperfections) than I would say get it because it is basically a pretty ring.  I'm enjoying wearing it often.
4.0,"I'm not one to wear sunglasses, especially when driving.  But these sunglasses changed my mind.  They fit perfectly and didn't hurt my eyes while wearing.  I love the tortoise pattern on the sunglasses, which made them look more classic."
4.0,Fit was true to size. Has adjustable Velcro straps in the waste and if you need the waste smaller or larger. Lengthen is good. Over all very impressed with the fit. Have not tested them outside yet so don't know how warm or dry they will keep me.
4.0,"It worked perfect for what I needed. I do not care for the feeling of the material though. I used it for a costume so it was fine, but I would never wear it out regularly because it feels and looks like a costume"
4.0,I love the looks and The way it fits me. For me great investment
4.0,My wife loves owls and these socks are perfect.
4.0,They alright kinda expensive
4.0,"Bought these leggings on a recommendation of an influencer that I follow on Instagram who claimed they were a “lululemon dupe” which they really are not except in the high waisted style in my opinion.<br /> The fabric is stretchy and smooth to the touch. I ordered my regular size and felt I probably could’ve sized down when I put them on but they still fit well. As the day proceeded they seemed to get looser. By the end I of the day they kept folding over at the top and I had to continually pull them up which was annoying.<br /> They print is attractive and they look very nice on with the a really nice length. For reference, I am 5’2, thin in the waist and thick in the bottom, 160 pounds. I ordered a large. I wonder if the medium would stay on lol"
4.0,I love the fabric but I’m sending it back the color is not burgundy really and it was to big. I order a small in Black to replace this
4.0,"We got these for numbering the suitcases when our theater group travels. The tags with the numbers themselves really seem to be plastic; not un-sturdy but plastic. The key rings are metal. The description seemed to imply the number tags would be metal too. Still, pleased with the purchase, hopefully they are small enough that baggage handling won't disturb them!"
4.0,These are good socks.  After washing the look small for my size 11 feet but stretch and fit fine.  They do not leave a mark on my calf so are comfortable.
4.0,can't use blue or white so returned need all black now for mostly black shoes.
4.0,These fit true to size and the fit provides a nice full coverage bottom.  The top is high wasted so it comes above my belly button.  They do have quite a bit of compression so if you are trying to hide a little mom-pooch they definitely do that.  The cotton is soft and I find these comfortable for everyday wear.
4.0,This top is really cute and feels like a shirt material so pretty good quality! It does fit but it is a bit smaller than expected so if I sized up one I feel like it would fit a little more better. This top is still one of my favorite items in my closet at the moment!
4.0,Great<br />I inadvertently ordere 2 of 1 and was unable to remove so I will return<br /><br />Also happened with books
4.0,This dress's cloor is not the same as picture... It looks more black.But cute dress though!!
4.0,"I got every thing to fit in, have to adjust drawstrings occasionally. I'm not large so this size wont fit everyone."
4.0,I like them but they are just too big fpr me amd my girls. They remind me of Granny earrings you know the ones😉. I don't hold the company accountable or am saying the quality is bad. They are nice. Just too big for us.
4.0,I'm 5 ft 4 in and it hangs just below my knees. I am size 10 and have lots of room. The back of cover-up is see thru and solid black. Very pretty cover-up but not for you if you like the shorter ones.
4.0,"I really loved the style, color, and fit of this dress. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the quality could be better."
4.0,"I just got the bottle,reading from all the reviews already made me trust the product."
4.0,Nice fit good product.
4.0,"Good looking bag!  Nice and roomy.  Rivets that hold the rings for the shoulder strap fell out less than 30 minutes after I received the bag; I hadn't even put items in it yet.  Both of them!  With the rivets gone, it renders the shoulder strap useless.  The strap was a selling point for me.  I am going to go to the hardware store and get a couple of bolts with nuts to repair it.  If that doesn't do the trick, I am sending it back."
4.0,Comfy and cute fits well over a big bust
4.0,"Cute and flattering IF you get the right size. I had gotten a large and had to send back for an XL. Im 5'0 and 150lbs, curvy, 34D. The XL fits me well. The bikini top back is more of a bra style than a traditional tie around the neck, but does tie around the back. Found that kinda weird and it rides up the back a little. I found if you take the pads out it fits better."
4.0,exactly as it appeared
4.0,These are quite nice and for the money very good. They were bought for a young Lady to be some of her first earrings they need to be gold - I can not see anything on these to say they are or are not Gold. (Other than the Blurb on Amazon) The quality of the masks under an eye magnifier is a little rough. As I said for the money - they look good and I am sure they will be the Christmas present they should be.  Very Nice.
4.0,Nice swimsuit runs very small
4.0,Nice material. Just a little tight around bust area. Colors are just as pictured. Nice dress for the price.
4.0,"These shorts were good quality, a nice chambray material that felt comfortable and the length was just right. The price was great also.  I wear size 10 and ordered the large and it was a bit roomy for me, I could have gone with a medium.  I would like them even more if they had back pockets."
4.0,"Nice sunglasses, did not like the bag, I thought they had a case to keep them!"
4.0,"Fine except the construction is kinda sloppy. Not floofy, therefore not very warm."
4.0,"LOVE these shorts around the house. They are extremely comfy and cute, however they are extremely short so only wear them indoors haha! Also, air dry them because they will shrink even more in the dryer. Besides the length, I love these shorts!"
4.0,this dress runs small so get it a size bigger if you want it to fit
4.0,I would have given this 5* but I had to repair it when it arrived. One of the o rings were loose. Otherwise I love it!
4.0,Good design but high price
4.0,Runs big but cute shirt!
4.0,"I got the item really fast. The Kaku-Obi was packaged well and new as described.<br />It is cotton but slides a little more than I expected. But overall, I am quite satisfied.<br />Thank you."
4.0,My granddaughter loved them.  Gave them to her for Christmas and they were a good fit.  I would recommend them.
4.0,"These are light weight comfortable earrings, squishy not solid. True to color. I would recommend. Especially if needed for employment."
4.0,"I didn’t care for the bubble sleeve. It doesn’t really look like it has them in the photo. However, nice sweater. Love the color. Size was great."
4.0,"This is a spectacular piece for special occasions, like costume parties. It is surprisingly heavy and close to the throat, so not comfortable to wear for very long, but it sure looks great with my Triple-Moon Witch dress. Doesn't lay on my neck well. The spring hinge at the back is clever and seems to be pretty sturdy; the sculpting is very realistic, and the faceted marquise ""jewel"" eyes sparkle nicely. Needs to be paired with gold snake earrings. Since this is a comparatively inexpensive piece, one can forgive it a lot, because it really does look dramatic."
4.0,Besides adjusting the size of the wristband; I really like this watch... Adjusting the wristband size is VERY difficult..... I would recommend using a crank pin pusher to take links out..... Amazon has them for less than $7..... I should get one now.
4.0,Thank the lord it's a snapback but i've never had to adjust a hat where on the strap theres only three holes punched!! Avg head size 7-3/8 `-7 1/2<br />Overall I'm happy with the purchase!! I didn't have to leave my home to get a authentic &#34;Roots of Fight&#34; hat for GREAT price! Only thing that could be a worry is if you have a good sized head you'll notice when you have to adjust it; the sizing.
4.0,Looks right and feels right when hitting the gun to get nice like the shirt and tight all over to enjoy the summer...👍🏾
4.0,Alot of bang for the buck. Many zippered pouches and a strong strap. Dove grey color is lovely. Feels suede-like. Price is more reasonable than in the store
4.0,"Ok I got this for my boyfriend and myself and I have to say I love it, but after a while of regular wear they start to get scuffed up. Don't get me wrong I love it and so does he but I wish the plating would stay better"
4.0,A lil big and the bust is even lower then it looks in the picture. That said work with a cute undershirt.
4.0,"I love Jordan Craig clothing and I own a LOT of it.  From jeans to track suits, to coats, I have a lot of Jordan Craig in my closet.  I also own the coat in this style.  I wear an XL and that normally fits just the way I like which is not baggy and somewhat looking like I had the item made for me.  The Denali coat fits me that way and I get a billion compliments whenever I wear it.  This vest, however, runs just slightly on the large side and therefore, it doesn't fit in the same flattering way that all of my other JC items do.  I still like it, but if I could trade it for a Large, I would do that in a heartbeat.  I am 5'11"" 215.  Hope that helps you today."
4.0,"Bought for my daughters whose Speedo goggles would fog up after one short swim season.  (Speed styles were probably the brand's low-end styles that i bought at department stores). These are very different feeling than the Speed style - they are lightweight, don't squeeze your head (or leave marks on the face) but perform just as well as anything else on the market! My daughters (ages 5, 10, 13) all tried them and like them, however they prefer the snorkel style that covers their nose. Once they convert back to this style, i will be buying more of them for sure!"
4.0,Just the right fit. Was expecting it to be a bit bigger.
4.0,"I really do like this dress A LOT but it falls right in the middle of my knee so the length is unflattering for me.  I imagine if I were to walk around and sit and do all those human things it would  slide up above my knee and I wish to hide those bad girls.  I am barely 5'4&#34; and I weigh between 125 and 130 depending on what day it is haha.  I am kind of top heavy.  The dress also accentuated my boyish waist line, the sides of my waist do not curve in dangit  so the dress went straight down on the sides..  Turning sideways in the mirror it looked great.  I love the material, very stretchy but good and fitted across the top and arms, not see through, very very cute. I wish it were two inches longer and I'd keep it despite showing off my strait waist."
4.0,"I like it. I just hope hubby does, too. He hasn't had a ratchet belt before. Could be interesting."
4.0,Lens/vision is great. Only drawback is they feel a little tight.
4.0,Very cute dress. Sizing runs a bit big. The blue color isn’t as dark in person but it’s pretty.
4.0,hard to get pin in
4.0,Not mini but not medium smaller than i expected but love it great quality will rock it daily...
4.0,Great top..thin material.love it would mostly buy more
4.0,"My son loves The Haunted Mask. This was a perfect surprise for him. He loves the mask, but wishes the mouth would open with the teeth as it does on the movie. Also, runs a bit tight on an adult."
4.0,Great eyeglasses. Thanks.-
4.0,"I like the dress, just a little loose at the top (chest). I ordered a size medium (I'm a 34B), will order more."
4.0,4 stars only because we needed a size 10.5. Bought a 10 it was too small.... tried an 11 and it was too big. Super cute and well made shoes though. Can’t wait until the size 11 fits.
4.0,awesome gloves. very protective from smashing fingers and such. hard to get off if you get something oily on them but still great gloves.
4.0,Daughter absolutely loves it.
4.0,"good fit, good color, good price"
4.0,it should be warm for winter
4.0,"I’m 5’3, 120 and these fit perfectly. I love that they are as bright and vivid as the picture, and I’m really happy with them. I imagine they will soften over time. My only wish would be that they would have had a liner sewed into them as the material is thin and you can your body, entire silhouette and undergarments, through them when in the sun."
4.0,I like the fact that the face of the watch  is easy to read; what I liked least was trying to get it adjusted to fit my wrist.  The instructions about using the included little tool were not too clear.  I finally figured it out and got it adjusted.
4.0,Thin but that's to be expected. Perfect for indoors or warm weather . They are very cute!
4.0,Love them but seam gets caught in zipper
4.0,"Nice!  Got these for my groomsmen and they loved them.  A couple pairs had some cosmetic blemishes, but for the price, not bad!"
4.0,I love the fit of a small.  I have a 34 inch back and 29 inch waist.  I A medium Would fit better.  I prefer to fit shape and not gather or bunch.  High Quality!  I am very pleased.
4.0,The fabric and color are fine
4.0,Good looking helmet. The cushion inside softened up due to my big face. Just got a little looser on the fit. Over all it’s a great helmet.
4.0,Smaller than I expected. But it really fits my thin wrist.
4.0,They are perfect for reading/working/and watching tv. Only problem I have is putting them on my head when I don't need them gets the nose pads caught in my hair.
4.0,I loved the dress but had to return because it was too large.
4.0,Great band. Only reason I am giving it 4 is because I really thought it was a bit wider. But love the print enough to ignore it!
4.0,"A little cheap looking, but for the price you can't complain.  All other items from this seller were fine.  Shipping was timely."
4.0,"it was little small, but cute."
4.0,Good quality .... very nice texture
4.0,"Looks good as promised. Been six months, no issues yet :)"
4.0,"I bought yellow with white polka dots to be Gabby Gabby from Toy Story 4 at the office Halloween party. I needed something a kid could wear, not overly sexy.<br /><br /> I didn't realize it has a seam across the back right on top of my butt. If you scroll down through the entire product description there is one picture of the back of the dress that says ""Ruffle layered decor, with a back button closure"" and shows the seam across the back. It's fine, it still fit, I was just not expecting it because there was no seem across the front waist.<br /><br />It's a synthetic material, but I don't agree with the negative reviews that it feels like a shower curtain or anything like that. It's just a regular synthetic material. The reason I got this and not the official Gabby Gabby costume was first of all, the price. Secondly so I could wear it again as a regular dress, because I only need the costume one time. It definitely can be worn as a regular dress. I'll probably wear a half slip (skirt slip). It's not really see-through, but just because it's a light color I'd prefer a slip to cover my crotch/legs just in case. I wear large in US size and bought a large, & it fits the same, I didn't have to size up."
4.0,It long and easy to break
4.0,"Mom son will love these..(fingers crossed)  ""I hope he will. Made with grade A cotton mix...it looks good and I love the color."
4.0,"necklace heart is large and may look better on a longer chain, but it is nice"
4.0,It was to small for my husband. So I would say it is for a female or a child size.
4.0,"The top part of the dress needed to be an inch longer. It was not an empire waist nor did it reach a natural waistline. It fit as expected, was cute and comfortable. The combo of black and white bottom may bleed in the wash due to material."
4.0,"Nice fade. Very big. They weren’t comfortable on my face. This style carried an oversized John Lennon vibe. Very cool, just not on me. Easy return."
4.0,I really like them. I get lots of comments from my customers...favorite pair.
4.0,"It seems to run a bit smaller than expected, but very good for the price.  Well made.  I'm pleased with my purchase."
4.0,I have received many compliments on this ear cuff. The cuff itself is comfortable. Mine did arrive with one of the metal chains broken. Thankfully my boyfriend linked it back to the top.
4.0,Good quality at a great value.
4.0,"The blue was xlarge and the black is a large, I kept the black. I love the ease of wearing it and the zipper front is easier to deal with than other rompers that button at the back. I do wish the fabric was more matte instead of shiny but it holds up in hot weather without wrinkling! I’m about 5’5” 200lbs so rompers are hard to find."
4.0,"SMALL but works as listed!<br /><br />The old classic has some basic features that comes standard on a phone but hey, its all on the wrist!"
4.0,"Not a bad band, scratches pretty easy but overall a great purchase."
4.0,"solid sunglasses at this price.  Not heavy duty, but will last if you are careful."
4.0,Needed a hat with the neck coverage. This one is cute and I love the color
4.0,Fits perfectly and it was shipped in a timely manner. I love how it hugs my curves and I just love how comfortable the dress is. The only problem I had was that I had to keep pulling up my dress because it would show my bra.
4.0,Too big for my nose piercings but very well made.
4.0,"I like it so far, it is small and nice on my neck."
4.0,"The top fit perfectly but the bottom was extremely long for me, but that's maybe just because I'm short. It's still a beautiful piece of clothing, and I got it altered. I love it now"
4.0,Boots are cute and fit well. Easy to get on. Exactly what I ordered.
4.0,"These are fun watches, but unfortunately, not all of the watches were in working order...but it makes a cute bracelet."
4.0,"The Attache' Instant Button Attacher has worked well in attaching buttons to the front and sleeves of casual shirts. The negative is the plastic ends of the fasteners (I used two fasteners/button inserted diagonally) protrude on the inside of the thin shirt fabric and scratch the skin. To overcome this issue, I covered the plastic ends on the inside with a mend and repair pressure sensitive nylon patch that adheres to the shirt fabric (can be purchased at a fabric store or fabric department or online) which I cut into a square. Then, I cut another square slightly larger to place over the first patch to give some thickness. The double patch stopped the scratchy skin problem and also is not visible to the eye. You can also trim the plastic ends on the outside of the buttons with fingernail clippers so that the tips of the fastener ends do not protrude over the button's rim. Thus, with a little ingenuity, it has performed well for my use. I would recommend it to a friend."
4.0,"The quality seems pretty nice, but it takes too long to arrive.  I wanted this for Christmas, and something this small really shouldn't take that long."
4.0,"This is a cute and very soft scarf! The grey/black/red plaid is classic and goes with so many different styles. The edges are frayed; however, it is discreetly finished so the fraying cannot continue. It is a little thin for my personal preference but it does work well for layering or traveling with."
4.0,"I am pleased with the material, fit and quality of this sleeveless top. The armholes are a bit large. I wore a tank top underneath."
4.0,Pretty! But lightweight- personally I add another medical mask underneath for a layer of support.  Attractive designs and easy wash! :)
4.0,"It's very comfortable and looks nice. But I wish it could be smaller since it's so stretchy. I'm normally a S, but this XS was very lose for me all around. I tied the bow on the tightest, but it still has room to move around. But the ultimate concern is the front. The edge of the V is very loose."
4.0,Large drags the floor
4.0,"It’s a long sleeve T-shirt , it’s okay, runs large around neckline and very long. Design is nice , I might keep. It’s big but comfortable"
4.0,The outfit was really cute but it was a little big. My daughter is a little on the small size for her age but it worked out great!
4.0,"The product appears to be well made and durable. I had a hard time keeping it in the hitch; in fairness, I tried to install during extreme cold weather. I hope that when it worms up the hitch plug will stay in the hitch."
4.0,Very Fashionable!
4.0,It's very nice. Thick for sure. Looks great but not the most comfortable... Nice ring though!
4.0,This is a really cool necklace. My only issue with it is that the image quality is not the best and is a little grainy. Other than that it's great. I don't really wear it because I don't wear jewelry but I will at some point.
4.0,Ok. My mother in law is HARD to shop for. Super hard. She has a very eccentric style. This is so beautiful and in her very favorite color. I am so glad I bought it. Pictures don’t even do justice to how pretty it is.
4.0,"Good quality, but a little snug."
4.0,"Great fit, the price was great and the suit is very colorful. A bit see-through so had to cover up a bit, which was disappointing (the reason for four stars). Great quality (no rips or tears after a full night of trick-or-treating). Fast shipping and quality packaging."
4.0,"It isn't super warm, the fabric is quite thin. I love the color (royal/cobalt blue). I like my sweatshirts thick and roomy, I would probably go 1 size up, my usual size fits just right."
4.0,Great skirt! A little pricey for what it is and it folds up in the wash but really cute.
4.0,"FOR THE PRICE, NOT TOO BAD. THANK YOU."
4.0,These fit perfectly in my tragus but were really hard to twist on due to the screw being small. I needed to get help lol.
4.0,I love the fabric however the stretch makes it a little lower than I would prefer personally. It does adjust but I have it on the smallest it can go and my camera hangs below my waist.
4.0,"Cute top! I just wish the front wasn't so blank, but a long necklace will make it look perfect."
4.0,More of a silky texture than I was expecting. But still beautiful and comfy. A little long and I am 5'6&#34;.
4.0,Looks great but too hard to open if you have a lot of bills
4.0,"Looks nice, the clasp was sticking and was poorly made, I was able to change it out for one I had since I make other types of jewelry. Otherwise this looks nice."
4.0,This hat is excellent quality.  The material is a fine finish twill with good body to help the hat hold it's shape.  The liner is a nice and unexpected touch.  It launders well and is holding up to daily wear very well.  I will get another to wax for a wet weather version
4.0,Beautiful ear cuff. The clip on part on upper ear hard to stay on. Tends to slide off easily.
4.0,"Decent for the price. As soon as I put on I saw a hole in the back where the zipper ends. I read other reviews that had the same problem, but for the price I just sewed it up and hope it lasts. Not the best, but not the worse just to wear and hand out candy. I wanted something simple and found this. It will serve its purpose."
4.0,"I read other reviews about the difficulty of securing it in the back.  Am I missing something?  I have had NO issues with this.  I keep the top one fastened at all times, pull it over my head, and then fasten the bottom one.  It's like any other bra!  It fits great and does a good job of holding the girls down during my workout!"
4.0,Warm and looks pretty good. Arrived in good condition and worth the price in my opinion.
4.0,"These casual socks are comfortable and stylish. They fit as expected and it was 8 pair of socks, just as advertised. The only strike I may have against them is durability, not sure how long they'll last. But for the price it's hard to complain."
4.0,You can cut your size
4.0,"Small in the shoulder and upper arm area, a little uncomfortable...BUT, I do have very square shoulders. I bought an xl, and wear 38 C bra."
4.0,I’ve been a fan of the Loke jacket for a while.  The jacket I received has the zipper installed on the left side vs the right.  Throws me off.  It is a Men’s jacket.  My only complaint but worth docking the overall ranking one star
4.0,Great price fit as I expected
4.0,These are one little cute princess shoes. This was a surprise gift for a friend. These Baby Toddler shoes are of a very good quality. My friend loved the crochet work on it and the two little bows on it are adorable. I think these are great shoes to have for a baby or a toddler because<br />1. They are very comfortable.<br />2. They are made of very soft and flexible crochet work. Because they are so soft they are great for a baby.<br />3. They have soft sole and has bamboo work.<br />4. The florescent pink is a nice contrast with the bamboo color.<br /><br />There is really only 1 thing I don't like about these shoes. They do not give any good support to the feet so it can probably be worn for short time or for parties and stuff. These are not shoes I would take the girls to the park with. For that you are better off with a pair of sturdy sneakers.<br /> If you want good support from shoes these are probably not the ones you want. But if you want shoes that seem to be very comfortable to wear and that also look very nice and is of great quality these are shoes to consider.Full Disclosure: I received this item for a discount/free for my honest unbiased review after using and inspecting the product. All opinions are 100% my own and have not been influenced by the seller. I receive no compensation for my review and always give my review completely honest and unbiased opinion of each product.
4.0,So thick and cozy! Got this for my sweater-hating kid and it keeps her warm. I'll buy again in different colors!
4.0,"Great product, came as advertised. I am 6 ft and I ordered a large it was a little short for me, my advice is to purchase a size larger."
4.0,Looks exactly as the photos shown. I ordered a size small and the bra band was verrry tight. It doesn't clasp. It's simply an elastic band all around your torso so it'll stretch when you put it on but it's pretty tight so it can be a bit uncomfortable. There is nothing behind the lace part so keep in mind it is see-through. One thing I noticed is that the fringe edges of the lace kind of curl inward so the lace part doesn't lay entirely flat onto your skin. Very cute and scandalous.
4.0,They are large and work as advertised.
4.0,Fit very well I have a problem finding shoes.
4.0,"It's a nice little pin. The colors are very bright and it's pretty striking on display. The only issue I have is how thin it is. Much thinner and much lighter than, say, a pin from one of the Disney parks. Not that it's a huge issue, given the low price, but it's something to bear in mind before purchase."
4.0,"Works for minimal reading.  I cut them in half and can use in 2 pair to read prices, fine print,  etc. They do throw your depth perception off. So be aware.<br />My vision is different in each eye, so they are not ""readers"" for me. But do fine for driving, etc. following cateract surgery."
4.0,"I have recently discovered activewear made of a polyamide blend, and it's an awesome material for work out clothing! Other websites sell comparable sports bras for $40-50/each so this is a great buy! Can be worn as a sports bra with great support, or even as a crop top with high waisted leggings. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it does fit a bit small. Per the sizing recommendations/bra size (I am a 36D), I was in between a Large and XL. I ordered the XL, and have some side boob that won't stay in the top. Not sure if this would work for someone on the larger end of what Seller states would fit an XL.  Overall a great purchase! Will definitely purchase more from this brand!"
4.0,Use these for house sandals - super comfortable - like walking on a cloud - would have given a 5 except for if your feet sweat you come out of the sandal through the toe area.
4.0,"The material is a bit thin, but perfect for warmer months.  I wear a size 12-14, but they were out of XL, so I ordered Large.  The Large fits, but is a bit snug.  XL would have been perfect, but it hangs so well.  I am very pleased with this dress."
4.0,It's a nice jacket especially if it's worn in spring or fall. It's good for dressing in layers for cold weather. It has 2 side pockets and 1 on the chest area....thumbholes on the sleeves. Would buy again..
4.0,It's a bit longer than I expected so I have to be careful when using the restroom in the middle of the night.  But it could be because I'm on the short side.  The material is soft and comfortable.
4.0,It made in China and shipped from there. Took a few weeks to get here but quicker then the estimate shipping date. The ears came in one piece not damaged. The quality of them are the greatest but worked perfectly for the inside joke we had going. Long story short a “grouchy” 91year old man was a trooper and sported them around the small town.
4.0,"Gave these to my brother for Christmas. The heel portion is too wide and they slip off his feet. Otherwise, they are nice slippers"
4.0,Fits me just right exactly what i expected to look and feel like
4.0,"I thought the idea of a ""mens capri"" was a little weird, but it was my way of getting around my work's dress code that doesn't allow shorts but allows women to wear capris, so why cant I?  I know they are labelled as ""hiking pants"" but they are very comfortable and look moderately professional when paired with a summer button-down.  Things I love: elastic waistband but still has belt loops, zippered pockets, comfortably cool.  One thing that is not my favorite:  They do have a little bit of that athletic pant plastic scratchy sound when I walk."
4.0,Love this jacket<br />Was just as I expected<br />Great buy
4.0,A little small. Probably best for a size 10/12 or smaller. I liked the color variety though so I wish hey had worked out.
4.0,Quality is somewhat suspect. The fit was good and while riding a atv they did stay fog free. Not sure how long they will last. I would recomended them due to the price.
4.0,"Well made and cute. A little large for our 9mo head, but she'll grow into them."
4.0,"It's small and cute,  but the only thing I don't like is that my cards sometimes get pushed down the card slots and it's hard to get  them out. I wish the card slots weren't as deep so that cards can slide in and out."
4.0,"Está muy bonita,.. pero esperé que sea un poco más grande,.."
4.0,We had to request a replacement due to broken clasp.  But the item is nice.
4.0,Cute jogger set a bit smaller than I expected but still super cute.<br />Nice material.
4.0,Love these sunglasses. Needed polarized. Optometrist charges ten times as much for polarized.
4.0,it is great<br />I like them and I tought 3 of them
4.0,"This is a cute necklace, but the chain feels as though it could break at any moment.  It’s very flimsy.  I’ll wear it, but I do  fear it may turn my neck green when I do."
4.0,Makes you look and feel better
4.0,"Very cute, but narrow in the back. If there was a little more coverage there it would be perfect."
4.0,Worked great fit perfect
4.0,Nice looking item! I like it so far. Came on time and fits well. I would recommend it to anyone who likes this type of style.
4.0,Tie is easy to put on and look great.
4.0,Shirt is cute and fabric seems like good quality but it's a little tight
4.0,I love the colors. The are bright and vibrant. I purchased this for my newborn granddaughter; the size is bigger than I expected. Hope she will be able to wear it during the Fall season.
4.0,Good amount of compression and comfortable fit. Good value for cost.
4.0,"super comfy and stretchy, fit perfect"
4.0,"They run a bit big. Comfortable, but pockets also more loose than anticipated for phone. Still a good price for working out"
4.0,Was expecting a bit larger tags
4.0,Me and my husband found these to be very comfortable to wear.<br />The drawstring is a nice feature since most face mask are too big for me.<br />The only issue we have is they fog up my husband's glasses regardless of how he has tried to wear it.
4.0,I read reviews for this costume before I purchased it and I knew the top would be tight so I ordered up a size and I actually was not able to wear the top. I just used a plain white t-shirt underneath. The skirt was also pretty see through so I wore gym shorts under. The shoulder straps of the skirt were huge since I ordered up a size and I just used safety pins to get them to fit. For the price this costume was worth it and I was not disappointed at all.
4.0,Good product. Works well on my four hats.
4.0,The dress is very pretty but runs very small.  I ordered the XL after reading the reviews and feel like I should have gotten the XXL for some additional room. Also it is super short. I'm only 5'3 and it's above my knee.  But overall it's is a super cute dress and a quality purchase.
4.0,"Right out of the package it had an awful smell. I washed it and it’s very soft, but sheds bad."
4.0,Very good pair of sunglasses! Never hand a bamboo pair before. Will probably buy again. I would say if you have an iPhone X it will mess with your eyes with the type of screen with the polarized lenses.
4.0,"The pattern is really cute. I like the pocket detail. It does fit big on me. I’m 5’5, 135 and a small is pretty big. It has more of a boat neck so my bra straps peek out. I think an XS would work better for me. Otherwise, it’s a cute top."
4.0,The color and the shape are nice<br />Could of used a stronger frame tho
4.0,Bracelet is small
4.0,The clutch works well.  The credit card slots are snug but the cards fit.  There are only 8 card slots so if you have more than 8 cards you would have to use one of the bill slots (there are two).  There is also a zippered change pouch.  A cell phone will NOT fit in this clutch.  Overall it is what I wanted and works well for me.
4.0,I think it is way worth the money! My boyfriend loves to wear them. The only thing is don’t expect them to be salon quality Durags. They are a little thin but definitely cannot tell when on.
4.0,Loved all the pockets and all the space it had for such a small package. Just had an issue with one of the zippers.
4.0,"Got this for a concert! I paired it with a pair of cowgirl boots, but could easily be worn with sandals or a nice pair of wedges/heels. It is kind of short, if I were to bend down I would have definitely flashed someone, so I wore it with a pair of spanxs underneath. But other than that it is super cute! Just was hoping for it to be a bit longer."
4.0,have not had cold weather yet to see how warm they are
4.0,"Just left a review about the purple sleeves, same brand. These do work better than the sleeves. However, I ordered the same size in these as I did the sleeves, and these are smaller and hurt putting them on. However, they don't hurt after i get them on, so I call it a win. I cannot go a size bigger because they would be too big then. They really do help."
4.0,nice quality - solid buckle - easy to cut/fit
4.0,"I bought these hoping to find a long pair of athletic pants and they are just that. Nice and long. Good fit in the waist. The only reason I couldn't give these a 5 star rating is b/c the fabric is very thin. Much thinner than the fabric Adidas uses. If that's not a problem for you, then these should suit you just fine. Reasonably priced!"
4.0,"Very nice - my silicone bands give me pressure spots now and then, so I have to switch wrists on the Blaze to avoid skin irritation. This band breathes and doesn't cause pressure spots. Only downside is that the strap holder wore out really quickly."
4.0,Very comfortable.. looks good!!
4.0,"Kids like playing with this stuff. well made, heavier then you would expect but doesn't feel cheap."
4.0,Not as sturdy as heavier glasses but the light weight is very comfortable.  Clarity is good.
4.0,Over all a decent jacket. Shoulders fit small so as long as you don't need full arm movement it's great. Got a lot of compliments.
4.0,"I bought these a while ago and they're pretty nice. I've been using it as a fake septum piercing but the only thing is that after using it for maybe two weeks, the clip won't stay closed unless you force it so that's kind of annoying. But besides that, it's pretty good."
4.0,I love all these colors this is like the fourth band I have purchased so I can color coordinate my scrubs. Great price & great product.
4.0,Lo máximo
4.0,"A little slippage but I definitely like the non slip bit in the back, and looked for it specifically before purchasing these socks. They fit well."
4.0,Bought for a gift but recipient said it runs large and would prefer I return it.  The blouse itself was very nice.
4.0,Everything except the bust fit. I even ordered a size too large.
4.0,Not Bad!
4.0,These bras are super comfortable and the price is great. The only reason why I didn’t give it 5-stars is because the pink one bleeds. Unfortunately I didn’t know until it bled on my clothes in the wash. I would avoid buying that one. They also run a size small. I’m usually size small and I got medium.
4.0,Wish it was 100% cotton
4.0,A solid heavy duty necklace!
4.0,I got this for our nanny and she loved it and thought it was adorable. Not sure of quality as I don’t wear it and didn’t open it but it does come in a cute velvety type bag.
4.0,"I bought this larger becsuse I'm a 38DDD and its hard finding tops that fit. It is just a tiny bit big in the girls, but I can tack in in a tiny bit and it will fit better.  Very nice heavy duty material and sturdy hooks and adjusters"
4.0,It's beautiful for this price
4.0,Very small relative to the size indicated.
4.0,My sister love it!
4.0,"Very cute shoes. A few issues though, the ankle straps are way too big, I have to figure out a way to secure them. I wish they were elasticized that would help. The insoles are a rough material so it's hard on bare feet. And definitely order a full size up! But they are adorable so worth it for me."
4.0,"The mask were sexy at best! Although the Mask stayed in place, I wish it had elastic versus tie! Planned on replacing with elastic and ran out of time!  I added a few black rhinestones a d perfect!"
4.0,"Product does help you organize items much better than if you didn't have it.  Backings are sturdy enough for pockets to not fall into the center.  Reason I'm giving this product a four is because of a few reasons.  One being that one pocket appears to be too tight for business cards, which is the purpose I used that particular slot for.  The main con is that the rounded length of the product did not fully cover the inside of my purse.  I would suggest to somehow update it to have adjustable length (2-3 inches) using small buttons (preferred) or velcro at the ends to help further secure the shape of the product while giving it length flexibility and overall coverage.  Overall, a good product to have if you carry nearly everything in your purse.  Yes, you know you who are.  :)"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:59756c2faa131eb8e018c353945394da]] This Myobe Sweater Dress is very pretty. However, I will say that it's more of a long sweater than a dress. The only way I see this working on someone as a dress is if you are a shorter person. Otherwise, it won't cover your butt (unless you like it hanging out and showing LOL.) My daughter is 5' 9&quot; tall and this was not long enough to be a dress by any means.<br /><br />I ordered her an XL and she is a size 12-14 and it fit her for a beautiful sweater. It was not tight around her chest or arms and fit nicely. Ordered the white which is a very bright white. The listing makes the white (as listed) look cream, which it is not. The knit pattern is very pretty and well done. There were no flaws or loose stitches or anything like that. The knit and sweater is a thinner material so I would recommend also wearing a lighter top or a camisole under it. This is made very well. Overall, a very nice sweater &quot;dress&quot; that I would recommend for a sweater.<br />I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review."
4.0,"I really like i! My friends asked me where I get such merchandise and I say amazon! A kpop wallet is what I really need! Only problem is my fingers get stuck, but that's my problem! Lol! but I'd recommend to buy."
4.0,Just as described. Not tiny like some overseas jewelery.
4.0,"Very nicely made. The Star was way bigger than I had thought it was going to be, which I didn’t like. However, that doesn’t change that this is very pretty, made well and the person I bought it for loved it."
4.0,I am happy with the pj set.
4.0,"Measured according to directions and still came too big. It’s a weird material, soft but weird, my husband was not a fan. We did decide to keep tho as my son can grow into it and not likely to grow out of his sensory issues. Will have to see how it works when he grows into it."
4.0,The cashmere lining gives instant warmth then donning these gloves!  Only time will tell as to the wear-ability and length these gloves will last.  The price was reasonable.
4.0,"I heeded a recommendation to order a half size smaller, and voila the sandals were a great fit, however I find that the straps are a bit too long and leave no allowance for take-up.  My experience is that leather streatches with age.  We shall see.  Other than that, everything performs as expected.  A fine product."
4.0,"Pretty, but the colors were not flattering on me.  Returned."
4.0,Sizing seems accurate
4.0,"Got this for the wifey. Looks nice, easy to install/uninstall and is secure. She likes it but a little uncomfortable. She just started wearing it so it could just be because she's not used to it yet."
4.0,the earrings were a gift for a friend and she seemed very pleased with them.
4.0,Grey shirt I love it will probably get another one
4.0,"Tela de calidad. Bonito. Pero algo ajustado se rompió el cierre, pero en la sastrería lo cambiaron"
4.0,Comfy but take note that the material is thin. Noticeable around the pocket area. You can see pockets through the material.
4.0,This jacket is perfect for hiking in cool weather with a slight drizzle. Size was right.
4.0,"Not as comfortable as regular, correctly sized, UV protection, sleeves. Not sure if they are of compression quality. Was not something I needed."
4.0,Love it but my neck is not long enough to work with it. But good product.
4.0,Runs a little small. Other than that it is a good quality product.
4.0,I give it 4 because  it's. It bad but it's a little big for my head
4.0,"But VERY LARGE, even though adjustable, it’s huge"
4.0,The cards don't have much of a coating on them.
4.0,SIZES NOT CONSISTENT. Got this in white as well and it was toddler size (not really but close) but the black fit perfectly.
4.0,"I'm 5'4'', 125 lbs, 36B. I would have kept it if it wasn't so wide in the shoulders and it didn't bunch up at the armpits. If you are brood in the shoulders or more busty you will probably love it. The  sweater itself is longer than most, cozy and classy looking."
4.0,"Very stretchy to fit my legs and booty (I'm about 150, 5'2&#34;) so a little on the thicker side. No problems getting these on BUT they are very thin. Good for working out, or doing yoga or housework."
4.0,These are sooo cute.. looks so good on my 6 year old’ ear but she can’t tolerate them very long..
4.0,Gift for a friend and they liked them all.
4.0,I gotta XL it's beautiful but my butt too big
4.0,"A bit thinner than those I purchased previously from another brand, but does the job."
4.0,"North Dakota winters can be brutal, this coat is longer and very warm.  It does run a little large."
4.0,"Haven't worn yet, did launder in warm perma press cycle seemed to hold it's size and shape, cotton is soft."
4.0,The fit is good and the comfort is good
4.0,I love this look and feel of this sweater! My only complaints are that there’s no tag to tell which direction is front (which I guess doesn’t matter) and that it snagged on its first wear 😭 but I still love it.
4.0,"Great watch, looked just like the pictures"
4.0,THe pearls are a nice size for a triple necklace.  Not too big or small.  It lays on the neck nicely.  The color is good and nice sheen.  I would have liked the pearls to be rounder.  I was hoping it would look more like cultured than fresh water pearls.  I think the price could have been less but I am happy with them and will keep them.
4.0,Shipping took about a week longer than expected. But very warm nice jacket.
4.0,"Here’s some pictures for an idea of how it fits. The zipper is nearly impossible to pull up because of bunched up fabric along the waist line. It needed 3 people. This dress should be worn with something under the dress to give it volume. The back of the dress drapes instead of hugging in making you look chunkier than you are. It was a good value for the price. Stitching is a little spotty and the fabric is thin, but with minor adjustments it worked well for what we wanted."
4.0,Nice material and useful
4.0,"This just came in and the fit is great. I ordered a small in the wine color, I'm just shy of 5'4 and you will have to wear heels due to the length or get it altered for flats.  I was going back and forth on giving the rating a 3 or 4 due to the color. The photo shows a dark deep rich wine color.  What I received was a watered down version of that. Much lighter red. I was disappointed with the color, but across the board, it's very cute and comfortable. I will probably reorder another color. Crossing my fingers it's accurate next time. I would recommend to the seller to put up consistent photos. The photos are not a good representation of what I received."
4.0,"Strong scent that took over a week to get rid of, otherwise a nice tote that works well with a laptop and books."
4.0,"These masks are super cute and seem to be good quality. Unfortunately, they are too big for a toddler's face. Some of the straps on the side are longer than others so they have to be twisted to shorten them even on older kids faces. So assembly is a little inconsistent."
4.0,"I bought an entire lot of these blouses to flesh out my Winter Wardobe, and to my dismay, this was the only blouse out of Six that fit right, looked right and I absolutely love it. I had to send the others back because although they were all the same size and came from the same manufacturer, none of them fit right and looked absolutely awful. This was the one gem out of that mess. Buyer Beware, these come from where? China, of course, and their Quality Control leave much to be desired. Best to order several styles and colors and choose what you like and send the rest back. That’s the only way to guarantee you will get the garment described and pictured online. I took one star off, not because of this particular blouse, but because I’m sick of badly made items coming out of China. I would actually purchase again if I could be guaranteed the same quality & fit, but I’m not going to waste my time."
4.0,"I received so many compliments wearing this dress to a recent event.  Fits perfect, its slimming and provides the belt for coverage in the perfect area. The material is not great for a hot day, as its not breathable and it does snag easily so be careful washing it."
4.0,First impressions these things look like crocs but like a croc ate about 10 crocs they are thick at least the sole of the shoe is and they are not as comfortable as crocs they arent uncomfortable but they have a stiff plastic feeling to them. They do have some flexiblity to them and they arent too hard to get around in its just they def look like they will be something that will last over time which isnt a bad thing it just they take some getting used to when using. They feel like platforms if that makes sense but I can def say they are great when you have teenagers who treat their bathroom like a splash pad this makes it so you dont have to worry about slipping or getting any water on your feet. Overall I got that for that exact purpose and that is the purpose it is serving and its doing well at.
4.0,They are rather small though but not bad. They are rather comfortable to wear especially in comparison with other clip-on systems .
4.0,"Loved theses goggles. Crystal clear. No fogging. And didn't hurt my face. Caveat....I only wore them for about 30 minutes. But so far, so good<br /><br />update...they only stayed fog free for 2 workouts.  Although they are crystal clear above water, they are very blurry under water...which I guess, doesn't make much difference in an underwater swim.  Still, very comfortable and do not leak!"
4.0,The beige and black look like plastic
4.0,"I just got this bag and really like it. It's roomy and has a lot of pockets which I love. The only reason I gave 4 stars, instead of 5, was because I wasn't sure what the inside would look like. I actually really like the inside of the one I received, so it works. It's kind of like a black and yellow leopard type print."
4.0,These are several inches smaller in size than the write up.
4.0,It arrived sooner that expected. My mom says It itches a little at the beggining but she's getting used to it. It is true to size!
4.0,This is a very nice button-down shirt. My husband loves it. IT looks very nice on him. The price is great for this shirt. It is worth it.
4.0,Was expecting better fabric
4.0,Buy them u will love them and u can where with dresses or jeans
4.0,"Got this dress in the mail today...so excited! It was ok when I first tried it on. Then I took it off, ironed it, put it on again, and it looked so much better!! The longer I wore it, the more I fell in love with it. I'm a little short of 5'5&#34; 120lb 34a and the S falls a little beneath my knee. The washing tips are contradictory. Hand wash just to be on the safe side."
4.0,Bigger that I tought but nice quality
4.0,"My kid loves it - wore it yesterday and wanted to wear it again today!  It's a little big but she's right between toddler sizes and kid's sizes so that was expected, plus as fast as she's growing it'll fit before baby comes!"
4.0,"Very nice color and feel. Washed it and remained the same, no shrinking, and color is still intact. Perfect to wear as a scarf around neck or as a shall. Bought it for a trip to SFO during October."
4.0,Smaller than I could use but they are good for my teenage daughter
4.0,Cool shirt a little too short
4.0,Very cute suit.  I got the largest size and it's still a bit tight on top especially.
4.0,"Fits great, true to size. Not suitable for warm weather. When I put it on it itches when you sweat. But perfect for cool temperatures."
4.0,The fit was nice but it wasn't really high-waisted. I wanted it to go over my belly button.
4.0,"Okay okay, these boots are poor quality, but! I'm not all that mad about it. I still love then, I can walk in them, they fit well, and they are VERY VERY COMFY!! so even if the quality is poor I still love them. They are cheep and comfortable."
4.0,"Iittle to high, little tight on the arms"
4.0,love this thin sweater but length is short looks fat. wish little more longer.<br />5 3&#34; ordered M .
4.0,I normall wouldn’t get a 24 but for 9 dollars figured if they were big it’s no lose. But they fit a little tight actually. And the metal piece digs into you when you bend over. But overall nice fit. I’m 5’8” and about 250.
4.0,"The fabric is not high quality and neither is the sewing. It fits very well, and from s distance looks very good."
4.0,"Cute and comfortable, but the material is very thin"
4.0,This is a beautiful belt but runs small!
4.0,Nice lightweight jacket. Received a lot of compliments.
4.0,"I was looking for a stylish, inexpensive pair of black cubic zirconia, i hit the jackpot here. I actually wore these  to a party, looked great, receive a few compliments."
4.0,"Very nice! The package had a XL sticker on it so I was nervous that it would be too big since I ordered a medium. But assuming a medium is a large in Japan it fitted pretty snug. If you have large chest, you might order a size up."
4.0,cute yoga shorts. i felt comfy in them. easy to put on. dont know how long they would last
4.0,"a bit see through, wear black panties"
4.0,"Very pretty necklace. While the description says they are freshwater pearls, they look more like beads. But the multi strand effect is very nice and the friend I bought it for was delighted."
4.0,It's a pretty dress especially for the cheap price but be warned if you are looking for the ombre-ish look like the main picture has it isn't like that AT ALL. That picture has a shadow or something going on in it. Also it has a lot more pink-ish color in it than I could see in the photos. Not bad just good to know. It's pretty sheer and will require something under it. The length is SHORT! Like I'm maybe 5'2 and it's not to my ankles. I haven't washed it yet and I'm worried after reading the other reviews!
4.0,"Daughter loves them. Cute and sparkly, just what she wanted."
4.0,"They come in a zippered hard case, carabiner clip included and soft cleaning cloth. I bought these for playing pickle ball. Removing one star because there is a small dizzy spot."
4.0,I had to trade up one size
4.0,Very thin. It’s like a peach skin material. But surprisingly not see-through. Very flattering though!
4.0,Nice sturdy tag!  Not sure how to erase it if it needs changing though.
4.0,I like the fabric is soft and fresh.
4.0,I purchased this dress in an xxl It fit just right maybe just a tad bit snug on the chest area but over all it was great. I'm 5'4 and 200lbs if I was any taller this dress would have been REALLY short but it fit just right. I paired it with some sparkle heels and I wore it to a wedding.
4.0,Such a beautiful dress! My only complaint is that the underskirt is really short.
4.0,"This is a great buy!  The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars was i wanted the fit to be a bit more fitted.  However, for most I think they would love the fit.  The material on the inside is very soft and the fit is flattering.  I would def buy again."
4.0,I wear this for working out at the gym. I like that it has a big pocket but I think the pocket should be long vertically for holding a cell phone. I also wonder whether it would be good to have the skirt so down about halfway on the sides because if I'm using exercise equipment basically the skirt rides up while I'm working out and it looks like I'm just wearing leggings until I pull it down again
4.0,"I'm glad I picked this as something for myself because I would be a little embarrassed if I bought this as a gift. In the picture it looks really cute. But in real life, the gold finishes look a little cheap. I would honestly rather have just had the tortoise shell band without any accents."
4.0,The colors are as vivid as the pictures. The mask is nice overall. I took a star off because I wasn’t crazy about the fit but I’m not wearing it for long periods of time either.
4.0,"Super cute, looks great on bracelets"
4.0,the back dose not fit well but the same way as for a lot of dresses like that. Probably it is my problem not the dresses.
4.0,"This is a pair of Pearl earrings. Beautiful & larger than pictured, I’m pleased with the workmanship."
4.0,"The earring are cute and my girls love them but I don't believe they are nickel free.  both girl ears started itching about 20mins after putting them on.  It would be nice if the creator made and nickel free once, because lots of people are allergy nickel"
4.0,"The 7/8 length makes these a good full length option for petite women.  While I wish there was a petite option (I’m 5’2”), these work and a great option for the price."
4.0,"I ordered one size up from my regular size and it fit great all but the length. I am 5 ft 9 and this swimsuit just wasn't long enough for me. It fit perfect all but the length wasn't as long as I wanted it to be.<br /><br />The swimsuit is very beautiful and well made. The crochet in the front is beautiful and the whole reason I wanted this swimsuit. The crisscross tie pattern in the back is a great idea to make it more like a tank top but with added support without worrying about the straps falling down.<br /><br />I really wish this swimsuit had fit right so I could add it to my collection, but sadly it did not. If you are tall I recommend ordering this 2 sizes up for extra room for length so it will fit correctly.<br /><br />Other than length this is a fabulous swimsuit and well made. I would recommend this swimsuit.<br /><br />I washed this like normal as soon as I reviewed it and it washed nicely with no tears or pulls. The crochet held up great in the washer.<br /><br />I received this for free. My review is honest and unbiased. My review is my own opinion."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:e3a3a11a2c880ccd5ca1f4a6ef28006d]] Was pleasantly surprised with the results from Sneakerases Soak! I followed the instructions and was floored by the amount of cleaning this product produced! As you can see from the before video? The sneaker was quite soiled with a large stain on the toe portion. I let soak, then followed up the next day with (as directed) rinsing off in all the dirt/staining removed as shown in the after pictures. No scrubbing, only rinsed and produced very visible results! I used the little sponge included on the sole of the sneaker but honestly? No needed extra except for a light wipe-over.<br /><br />My only reason for giving four (4) stars instead of five (5) was I found the warning portion in the use of gloves when touching, etc. (As shown on the label in the picture) I just didn't feel secure in total experience with the severe caution printed.<br />But you can see for yourself the remarkable cleaning provided by the soak! Impressive to say the least and from a skeptic like myself? The proof is in the results, no arguing with the conclusion in clean the soak created!"
4.0,But the flower was ripped i fixed it
4.0,"Material is great, lots of room and pockets inside. It is also thin you can slip it inside big purse."
4.0,Very very flexible
4.0,The sole of the shoe didn't fit my arch!
4.0,"I love them, but fear the seems won't hold up."
4.0,"I like these pants for work. They dry quickly, light and easy to move around in. Also comfortable when driving."
4.0,"After reading the reviews I went with an XL.  It fits me well.  The arms could be a little longer, but I have longer than avg arms so I'm used to that.  I typically wear XL hoodies and jackets so I would say it's true to size.  If you want a baggier fit I'd go up a size.  I'm 5'7"" 160 lbs and smaller chest.  It is very soft though and I've got a ton of compliments on how cute it is.  The material is sort of thin but I just layer under it and it's fine."
4.0,Great leotard for kids... durable and cute... best combination.
4.0,"I toke it as gift, it look like good quality"
4.0,Wow fits great nice big ring. Love the make and colors.
4.0,"Love this shirt, perfect fit, soft material,  got a lot of compliments"
4.0,Love this dress  !! Fits a bit tight but color is beautiful. A lot more darker red than the bright red shown but love it otherwise. Plan to buy more in different color.
4.0,"This refused to stay on smooth, glossy, clean , oil painted wall.. plans changed. I tried it on mirror and on one window pane. Now, it refuses to come off. It’s definitely for glass.<br />I like how it makes the place look better. Now, people get to be encouraged while they look at themselves."
4.0,Bought for my granddaughter. Nice material and fits well.
4.0,Very delicate but eloquent necklace. I was very pleased with my purchase and have been complemented several times since I put it on!  I cannot wear it every day because it doesn’t match all my outfits but love it when I wear tan or turquoise!!
4.0,"Bought these glasses for my youngest son and was surprised at how small they actually are.  They do fit him, but I doubt for very long."
4.0,Light weight. I get lots of compliments on the color. Good polarization. Good price for polarized lenses.
4.0,This money clip is quite nice. It's modern looking and very minimalist. The carbon fiber is really cool looking and makes the clip stand out.<br /><br /> I have 3 credit cards in it and they are very easy to get in and out. I have $9 in cash on the outside and I have to say if I were carrying it around all day I would worry that it might come out. I've only removed the strap twice but it already seems to have lost some elasticity so the cash isn't very secure. I wouldn't carry it everyday but it would certainly be nice for certain occasions or on days where an entire wallet is either unnecessary or too cumbersome. 4 stars only because I feel like practicality is lacking with the cash not being secure.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product for free in exchange for this honest review.
4.0,they look pretty for the price. I normally use the P size but this one I bought the M size and its fits well.
4.0,"For this price the dress is super cute and fits well. The only down side for me is fabric, it has syntetic  smell but to be fair most more expensive dresses you buy at the department store will have same cheap fabric and way bigger price tag. All in all I do love the dress...great buy"
4.0,Fit good & the polarized sunglasses lenses are very clear with no distortion. Would be a 5 star if had spring hinges.  Bifocal is just out of straight ahead View.
4.0,I usually wear a medium but ordered a large because I wanted it to be a little relaxed.... it was the right choice! I feel like a medium would have been too form fitting
4.0,"I ordered a medium (I'm 5'4&#34; and a size 6) I had to take it in, in the waist and bring the length up 9&#34; to have it lay just above the knee.Otherwise, very cute and nicely made! I used it for a Halloween costume, (see photo) but will use it as an outfit as well :)"
4.0,"Very large hole in tiny bead, but had enough features to be recognizable and served its purpose."
4.0,"Not aperfect oem product, hinge comes loose while moving wrist during activities."
4.0,"These are very cute for my eight-year-old.  However, we did decide to cut off the back elastic strap and wear just as a flip flop, she said it pushed into her toes and hurt when the back strap was on.  Probably depends on your feet.  These are cute though as plain flip flops for a dressier occasion in hot weather."
4.0,"Looks great, but runs a little small."
4.0,Had a pair of these before good boot for every day wear but not causal wear
4.0,"The top was too small and they don't carry an A6. The overall quality looks good though. Just posting so other people my size won't waste their time. If you have a 46-48"" chest I think it would work for you, but that's about it."
4.0,The product material seems to be of good quality. The length and legs were perfect but the waist fit really large.
4.0,"This is what I consider a practical ""English style"" hat. It has a high brim that doesn't obscure my vision, the brim is deep enough to effectively provide shade, it comes down far enough in back to not look abbreviated, and it's fitted enough to stay in place. It's a bigger hat than what I normally consider a driving cap.<br /><br />This one has adjustment straps on both sides (you have to adjust both sides for a symmetrical look). It fit fine on my XL-hat-sized head, and I didn't even let it out all the way. This should fit a lot of people who find normal hats too small. As pictured on me.<br /><br />Style-wise, it's not going to go with a lot of American casual clothes, unless you're rocking the urban-hipster look. Here in horse-loving Maryland, it would certainly work to wear to the races. to English-themed events, or with button-down collared shirts.<br /><br />Recommended for a newsboy-style cap."
4.0,"Really cool design, but obviously cut for more slender body types."
4.0,Look nice and professional with  good fabric
4.0,"I liked it , I am 4'11 127pounds ,  I tried it on as soon as I got the package  , I put a safety pin on the chest area , I didn't know how to tie the knot because is kind of long"
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised to love this dress. The fabric is sturdy but has stretch to it. The bow threw me off. I thought it was a sewn-in-place, fixed bow. But it's actually two strips of fabric, one sewn at either side seam that you have to tie yourself. The strips are rather short, which is good for a front bow. But I can't get it to look nice enough to keep it tied in the front so I tie it in the back. This annoys me but even so the dress looks lovely.<br /><br />The cut is gorgeous. The neckline is high but I don't feel terribly smothered. I thought I'd need a XXL but could only get the blue in XL so I took the chance and it fits great. I think XXL would fit a bit better in the bust but would be too big in the waist.<br /><br />The arm holes are a little high, but not uncomfortable or tight. The hemline comes above my knees but a little short in the back (because of my large rear). I should clarify. I'm just under 5'10"" and weigh 215-220 lbs. My waist measures 36"" and I'm wearing a 40C bra but I'm actually heavily abusing it and need to move up a cup size or lose some weight.<br /><br />The print is beautiful."
4.0,"Cute print, smaller sized than expected"
4.0,These glasses are a little big (wide) for my face. Otherwise work great as far as a bifocal/sun protection.
4.0,Great material. It looks exactly like the picture
4.0,"I wanted to keep this so bad but with the extra link, it was too big, without it, it was too tight... Right in the middle so I can't use... There was nothing to remove, 1 extra link came in the package for extension. A little heavier side but I like the feel of weight. Too bad I had to return."
4.0,I loved the material and arrived sooner the expected. Size does run big I ordered 0-6 m and this size fits a 1 year old
4.0,Fit perfect and still has wiggle room. Will make a perfect costume for Halloween! Thank you for the fast shipping as well.
4.0,It was bought as a gift.  She loves it.
4.0,I love this dress. Perfect dress to just throw on! It’s just a tad bit sheer.
4.0,"The charms are exactly as described but with all my purchases, I count the quantity. I was missing 3 charms. It may sound a tad anal but if the description says 100 thats what i expect to be in my package."
4.0,This bag is as described.<br />Very spacious lunch bag..this is my favorite piece.. provides lots of space when packing my daughters snack and lunch for school.
4.0,Like these shorts fit good & comfy
4.0,not as shiny as I'd  like
4.0,"I liked the color, it was consistent with the picture and a deep wine color I wanted. It is very comfy and a soft material, I would make a good lounge/casual dress. I wear it to church. Everything turned out as expected with the dress. The only thing I worry about is if it will last long because although the stitching is typical the material seems a little thin and its the same material used for the pockets. I couldn't put anything too heavy in the pockets as I worried it wouldn't hold and rip but that didn't really bother me too much as I didn't buy the dress for the pockets. I bought a M and Im 5'7&#34; and 133lbs and its about 5 inches past the knee. It was a good fit for me, fit exactly as shown in the picture."
4.0,I got the hot pink velvet dress and it’s lovely and flirty. Looks expensive but it wasn’t. However it’s super short in the back- I have a slight booty. I would only wear this around dates I trust. Easy for my booty to slip out. May want to wear Booty shirts underneath. Overall satisfied with the dress! Great value for $13
4.0,"The mask was a hit anywhere I took it. Went to festivals, Halloween party and people gave me a lot of props for it. And for the price I got it for, it’s definitely worth it."
4.0,"These socks fit well in my low cut shoes, mostly dressy booties that are more comfortable with a thin light weight sock.  They slip a little bit so I find that I might need to adjust them once during the day, but I think that's not bad considering the cut."
4.0,"It said not to remove the needle, but it came out by it self . I finally got it back in and it seems to be working."
4.0,"Bought as a gift,  they were very happy with it."
4.0,Stems too long but really pretty. Don't plan to sleep with these on!
4.0,I had expected the Red Bull to be an embroderied cloth logo.  It is actually an iron on patch.  But it is decent quality and is worth what I paid for the cap.  The cap itself is very good quality.
4.0,"Perfect fit, comfy, and super cute. I'm normally a size M, but I bought an XL. I have it in Grey and Green and always get compliments."
4.0,I bought these for my 9 year old. She's plays the piano so I thought these were perfect. She loves them and they look beautiful on her.
4.0,This is a very good quality. But it ran smaller than I was expecting.
4.0,I was actually pleased. The Blaze fit wonderfully. I love having an option to switch up the bands.
4.0,Cute dress but I could have sized down. I have hips and butt so I didn't want it to fit to tight around that area. It was the halter part of the dress that was to big under the arms. The length and everything else was fine.
4.0,I liked the fit the style & the color I still have this skirt.
4.0,"These are nice pants, and fit as expected in general, just were extremely long.  I am 5' 6'' and ordered the regular length and I am stepping all over them."
4.0,Would go 1/2 to one full size larger. But great value for the $$$
4.0,I ordered a larger size.  It has a strange fit at the top but maybe because I don't have broader shoulders.  I like it.
4.0,Large and light with many pockets. it is what I was looking for.
4.0,Looks decent esp comparing the price of authentic jersey and this but cant knock the price
4.0,Love this dress I was happy with the material and the length
4.0,Es un vestido para disfrutarlo Durant el verano.
4.0,"Perfect for wide temple glasses, was too big for my Serengeti sunglasses, with a little clear nail polish works good. Note, its stretch fabric."
4.0,Super cute just took a long time to get delivered still give it 2 thumbs up
4.0,"Very heavy if planning on hanging on a badge reel, but good quality"
4.0,I love this shirt! It is so soft and comfortable. It shows just the right amount of cleavage (for me... if it's too much it can be worn with a cami underneath)
4.0,"These are comfy enough, but the back of the show is cut low and a tad (on my foot) long, so in walking I step out of them. Will put a heel pad in. Otbhewise nice comfortable flats."
4.0,Pretty suit and did the job for my vacation. I am usually a 4-6. After recent pregnancy usually 6-8. If I wasn't in a pinch on time I would have returned my 6-8 I ordered and sized up. A little tight in the shoulders and waist.
4.0,Fast shipping!! Soft fabric!!
4.0,"Great material, somewhat snug on my thighs."
4.0,All in all work quite well in cold weather when staying at home.
4.0,It's neat.
4.0,Bought them for a good friend who loves turtles and loves purple. She loves them! One less star bc they came a day late. Otherwise satisfied.
4.0,Get pretty
4.0,Daughter was excited about it
4.0,A little smaller than I expected but still very sturdy and useful. My only complain is the position of the zipper makes things easy to fall off. (I use it as a pencil case). The colors on the picture look more like white and black but it is silver and black.
4.0,"I'm 5'9, 147lbs, 36D and order a medium. There's a little bit of wiggle room in the midsection and chest area that causes the material to sit out a bit otherwise fits great! Dry cleaning and a little pinning should solve that. Only downside is a bit of sloppy stitching in the front. Will update after use this weekend. Can't beat it for the price! Will buy again."
4.0,"The only problem I had is the legs were too long and I had to have them shortened by 6 inches, I now take about a 24 inch leg. A problem when we grow old."
4.0,Great quality and a beautiful little dress.
4.0,Nice pocket for air tag.
4.0,Great wool hybrid socks for the price. They're not as heavy as a lot of other wool socks but seem to be very capable for working out.
4.0,Order a size down if you want it to hug your body
4.0,The feel is very nice. Heavier material so feels nice on your wrist. Only complaint is that it kind of pinches the hairs on your wrist so makes it uncomfortable sometimes. Other than that they look great.
4.0,"I loved the size of these glasses - they were just what I was looking for. Unfortunately, when I put them on, the tint on the lenses was just too ""red"" for my taste. The irony of looking through rose colored glasses :)"
4.0,these are not true to color but other than that they work well
4.0,"Very cute and true to size. I ordered the yellow, which I love, but the lining is pretty thin and only nude colored undergarments are appropriate to wear underneath. Without a nude bra, you could see my nipples through the fabric."
4.0,This is a very nice and comfortable hoodie sweater. I love the way it fits. I gave it 4 stars because I didnt like having to cut out the pockets. The pockets came sewn together so you have to use either scissors or seam rippers to open the pockets for use. Doing this caused ripped thread shreds which isnt bad because they are on the insides of the pockets so you cant seem them.
4.0,Small but I'm adjusting to it. Tired of carrying a big purse around.
4.0,These are so cute and stylish. I find them to be comfortable but they are a little hard to get on and off. They are a bit snug and narrow
4.0,"Super cute, just be careful with them."
4.0,Arrived on time and was good quality.
4.0,I ordered the same earrings.. Just from a different site.. Unfortunately these do not blink like the others did. Other than that I'm happy with them.
4.0,"I have purchased 3 colors of this top! It is so comfortable, colors great, fits loose (the way I like it) and the material feels great!"
4.0,"The dress is absolutely beautiful and I received many compliments on it.  However, the dress was very long even with heels and I am 5'4''.  Lots of material at the bottom, I had to pick up the dress to walk."
4.0,works well for my son to wear to his job at the movie theater. standard glove with standard fit. don't put them in the dryer. lay them out to dry or they will shrink up a bit. not too expensive so we buy a new pair every 3 months to keep them fresh and new looking.
4.0,This is a sexy but elegant piece.  I love it!
4.0,"I'm very pleased with this strap, especially at the price point. The only thing I wasn't a fan of is the leather cinch loop; it's just glued together. I added some red contrast stitching for peace of mind and to make it look a tad better, so it was an easy fix. It feels sturdy enough that I don't mind using it daily with my favorite Canonet rangefinder."
4.0,"The neck was too high. The whole thing fit, but the collar was just too high."
4.0,"I've had many bands for my Apple Watch, expensive branded ones that do not fit properly. At last, a stretchy band that can be easily adjusted to fit my wrist! It is colorful, comfortable and fun! The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because it snags and fibers will stick up. However, I use a lighter to gently melt those fibers - burning off a thread - and all is well."
4.0,Nice but smaller than my expectations
4.0,"Wrinkles like a t-shirt, but very comfortable."
4.0,"I bought this so i could wake up for class because i have been slacking. The first night i used this i had to be up by 9 am for class and had called asleep at 5am due to homework. In the morning the beeping and vibrating started and it was so annoying but i had forgot that i did the jumping jack wake up so i couldn’t turn it off with 5 taps. Then the zapping starting, my roommates had dared me to put it at 5 times and unfortunately i did, when i tried to use the app to turn it off thinking i could get past the jumping jacks i was shocked when the app told me to jump! To sum up i got out of bed, did my jumping jacks, and finally made it to class! I only give it a 4/5 bc i was so angry for class this morning, but i would also give it a 12/10 bc this is the first thing to get me to class all year!!!!"
4.0,"Only down side is that while wearing the shoulder strap the weight the bag can hold can be a bit uncomfortable, and the cheap plastic attatchments squeak with every step. But the zippers and compartments are well thought out and overall I'm happy with it. I will probably eventually put a custom shoulder strap on it."
4.0,"I got my Lil boy this set for his 3rd birthday. Paired with black Adidas with white stripes, he was too cute. My boy is small, so the shirt was big...I wish it came in a smaller size, but he was still cute! My son is currently about 40 lbs and 3 ft tall, and his birthday was in September so he has grown a little bit since then."
4.0,I wish the material was a better quality but you get what you pay for. It still is a cute purse and I get complements about it when I am wearing it!
4.0,They are super soft. I love the material. I bought as a gift for my sister in laws and they were perfect! Definitely worth more then what I paid!
4.0,This dress was extremely small. Be careful of the sizing if  purchase!
4.0,LOVE the earrings!  The only disappointment is in all the pictures they appears more black in color but they are more just silvery colored like the bottom picture of them on the ears of the woman.  Nice for the price.  Keeping them.
4.0,Ordered this product for my daughter.  Spins well and the color is prettier in person than pictured.  The only con would be that it does make a slight noise when it spins that bothers her but I still think it serves its purpose for the price.
4.0,My niece likes it.
4.0,"This dress is cute and my daughter loved it! I only gave four stars because I used the sizing and it was smaller than it should've been according to that. If we would've had time I would have exchanged for a larger size. It still fit her though, looks good and is made well. For reference, she is just growing out of 4T."
4.0,These are cool and the kids loved them. Only thing that could have been better was the rubber bands that keep them on their fingers easily come off. They can be put back on but it's a hassle that shouldn't have to be dealt with.
4.0,Cute just way to big
4.0,I bought this for my friend.  She loved it!
4.0,"Very nice shirt, and it looks as described online"
4.0,Very stretchy get one size down
4.0,"The marketing for this sweatshirt says cropped. I don’t know why. The photo doesn’t show a cropped sweatshirt. The sweatshirt I received isn’t cropped. It looks and fits EXACTLY like the marketing photos. Exactly like the photos!! So not cropped.<br />It is lightweight. Not a medium or heavy sweatshirt material. It’s thin. It’s what I expected based on the photos and the description but it’s important to note. This is not typical weight for a “sweatshirt “. The inside of the fabric is lightly fleeced so it’s soft. The construction is well done. No loose threads, no missed seams, no wonky lines. It’s well made.<br />It’s perfect to wear with jeans, leggings, yoga pants, whatever.<br />I actually really do like this lightweight sweatshirt. I really like that it has a kangaroo pocket like a hoodie, but doesn’t have a hood!! I have long hair, so sometimes the hood part of the hoodie makes me nuts, but I want the kangaroo pocket so I wear the hoodie. This sweatshirt is the best of both worlds for me!!"
4.0,Works well for me.  If you need a body pillow for sleep (like me) this great for travel.
4.0,The style was very pretty and my cousin liked it.  But: the stone was obviously dyed and not as large or graceful in proportion as the picture showed.
4.0,Thicker material then I expected. Comfortable.
4.0,Nice sheer sleeveless under shirt with good shaping. Very cool to wear in the hot days of summer.  Give these a try - XL is my normal size and XL with these undershirts fit well.
4.0,"I ordered a size larger and the fit was ok.  The sleeves are a bit snug, but still fit.  The fabric is great.  Certainly could pack this dress very easily.  You could wear it as a casual outfit or you add some jewelry and wear it as a dressy dress.  The length is good.  You wouldn't need a slip with the dress either.  I would recommend the dress, but I would up your size.<br />It does run a bit small."
4.0,These are beautiful..not of the very best quality....but wearable
4.0,"The pants fits me perfect, but the shirt is a little bit small. Overall, the uniform is great!"
4.0,"These were the largest size offered and are a bit small, however, they are great. My feet felt much better as soon as I put them on. They are very much worth a try."
4.0,"Perfect fit. My daughter love it, thanks"
4.0,"Cute and comfy...material is a little thinner than I expected, but over all, I like it."
4.0,Product seems well constructed.  I am using it for microsoft surface accessory bag instead of a makeup bag.  Zipper sticks a little bit.  Next time I might buy a bigger version as its pretty small but it is a nice little bag.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:f713f710060f7d87b5c23af1a9571da4]] Runs big I’m wearing small and I wear size 3 on pants decent material and well made. Love it ! if only it would had been a smaller fit.
4.0,"The length was nice; the fabric is soft.  It has minimal elastic with the drawstring, so unlike sweatpants, you must untie the string each time you take them off."
4.0,The gripper could be a little tighter
4.0,They were beautiful! The strands lay exactly how I wanted them to.  Hey I’m giving it only four stars because the clasps are not put together correctly. I had to re-adjust the pearl strands to the correct hole so that the pearls draped properly.
4.0,"This front pocket wallet is of decent quality and the vibrant blue is great for the summer months. The wallet is a slim profile design and holds a couple of credit cards, bills and some coins. I found the coin slots to be a bit difficult to use but the leather is new and still stiff so hopefully that will improve as the leather softens, I like the slim, minimalist looks of this wallet, which works equally as well for women in pants or in a small evening bag."
4.0,"Work well with the dress, good buy for the price."
4.0,"Cute dress, slit is a little high and chest area is out there.  Wish the slit was a little lower."
4.0,"The ankle strap could have a little more length to it/ a couple of extra notches, but overall these heels are perfect!"
4.0,Cute pajama pants. I wear them around the house. I usually wear a Med or Large and these are like an XL.
4.0,"I bought this for my wife, the bb Z10 fits perfectly, no complains about the case or its construction, my wife has just said that it adds some weight to the very light Z10, would buy it again."
4.0,"I would give this product a 5 star review except the bottom was not stitched and kept unraveling. I had to stitch the bottom myself to keep from completely losing the poncho and having a pile of yarn. Since receiving this, I have received many jokes and compliments. However, after trying it, the jokes stop as it is warm and easy to move in."
4.0,Nice waffle material...doesn't absorb well.  Very strong closure but it runs large
4.0,"The set looks exactly like the picture.<br />This hat is comfortable, good quality, light and soft material and the fabric stretch very well. Fits a little big.<br />The scarf is very nice and stylish, quality is good, the material soft and lightweight and It keeps warm. I can wrap it twice and still have room to fluff it up, doesn't scratch or irritate my skin."
4.0,The bag design is definitely made for tools not so much for traveling. The bag layout is kind of a triangle instead of boxy or round.
4.0,"It’s a lovely dress—fits well, falls nicely, and is made of soft fabric. I might buy another one in another color. Follow the sizing guidelines. (I had to go up 2 sizes from my normal size.) I’m giving it 4 stars because a button is missing. Luckily it’s a pretty basic button and I should be able to find a substitute."
4.0,Great purse- but the handle was a weird leather substitute that didn't' match the color of the bag.
4.0,"The actual mask material is very sheer, even see through. The filters are the only part that make this mask protective. Neoprene material is so much better."
4.0,"Great Bargain!  The fabric is not the most heavy / thick in the world, but under a jacket and cummerbund who needs warmth?  It fit a little &#34;blousy&#34; but that is far better than one of those slim cut shirts.  Highly recommend it for value"
4.0,The costume fit great and worked well! It was kinda cheap material but everything worked fine. Definitely a good / fun Halloween costume!
4.0,"Asian sizing. Bought for my mom who is 5'3&#34; 140lb size XL, she wears med/large normally and would need an xxl. Nice shimmer to it to dress up trousers or jeans!"
4.0,Looks like the original. Feels a bit firmer and not as comfortable but still great for the price.
4.0,Really cute.  Perfect for a gag gift.  Not practical for real use.
4.0,"It's overall a good product. Even though I ordered the correct size, I think because I'm a 32 this bra is too big for me. It still fits, just a bit uncomfortable. Definitely takes some time to get used to and I don't wear it that often because, like I said, it is too big and is thus not super comfortable. But, it is good on special occasions when you want to wear THAT dress/top whatever."
4.0,Love it good quality fits great true to size
4.0,Good socks but over priced.
4.0,Good pair of pjs.. But the sizes run larger than they should..
4.0,"I bought this as a fashion piece and all-in-all I love it. The color is perfectly represented on here and the piece is lightweight and flexible. It seems almost a bit flimsy but so far it's held up nicely. I like that it's not heavy on my neck. I get a lot of compliments on it.<br /><br />If you were using it for other purposes, I don't think it would hold up. ;) Much more of a fashion piece."
4.0,"I do like this product.  I do wear glasses, these do not fit over my glasses. wished they would go over my glasses or develop a product to clip onto glasses.  I go to work early morning and the road I travel on has a lot of neon lights coming towards me and these glasses help 100%.  I can even spot the deer sooner than I could without them.  Thank you so much."
4.0,Didn’t like the buttons
4.0,The plaid on the boot is plastic which I didn't expect and looks kind of cheap to me but still very cute!
4.0,cute and snug and doesn't hurt like original band
4.0,"It's not at all the color I picked, which was like a light teal. It's actually a really light blue, but that doesn't bother me too much. Beyond that, the quality is actually quite nice. The material is more like a running shirt material, which I like quite a bit."
4.0,"Beautiful piece of jewelry, but hangs really low.  Hard to fit a smaller head."
4.0,I like the necklace.  The chain is cheaply made and broke to easily.
4.0,"Does not look/fit like the pic but is a nice dress, I have gotten a lot of compliments"
4.0,"Gorgeous, but fragile. Piece broke off in the package. Planned on deconstructing it for a headpiece anyway."
4.0,detail is not as good as it shows on the photo.
4.0,It was cute to wear at an event.
4.0,"Best dress but not true to size, runs small"
4.0,Some of the rhinestones were falling off when I took it out of the bag but overall pretty dress
4.0,"Was going to order per the size chart but, as recommended, I sized up for a relaxed fit. Still a bit too snug in the proper chest area. Shirt is fitted and flattering. Linen feel of fabric is nice (will likely need ironing after every wash). Brown color leans a teeny bit more toward brown-orange but still a really nice neutral color. Will still keep and wear cami underneath and, if available in my size, would buy other colors."
4.0,This looks cute but way too big as a small. But getting it fix was easy.  As a reference I am 5’5” and 106 pounds
4.0,This is a nice sturdy cap but it isn't as &#34;stone washed&#34; of a look as I thought.  It is almost a &#34;painted stonewash&#34; look rather than a canvas hat that has been &#34;worn.&#34;  Overall okay
4.0,Perfect Fit into my Oakley Half Jacket 2.0. Would have given 5 stars but the quality when looking through can tend to make certain device unable to read or extra dark when you have them one. Also you get that chameleon affect when looking through tented window or device like your phone or touch screen in your car. Would i buy them again plain and simple yes. While they are not Oakley the are an acceptable low cost affordable solution.
4.0,The price was right and the bracelet is beautiful. I really like it. I will recommended it to a friend
4.0,This outfit was very cute however the elastic on the bottom was too tight and almost restricted breathing. I removed the elastic and rehemed the shirt and it was perfect.
4.0,"Good fit, I have big thighs so the skirt kept coming up, but the dress made my curves look great.<br />This is also great to wear if you’re dressing up as snooki 😉"
4.0,Looked a lot more real than most.
4.0,Pretty ring. Definitely worth the price.
4.0,Nice fun scarf.  I wish the edges were finished a little better.
4.0,Good quality .size good fitting
4.0,The shirt fits great other than the length of the sleeves. They are a little long for me but I just roll them. Material is breathable. Nice for fall weather.
4.0,"Good quality. The bust and shoulders run a little small but not enough that I needed to size up, rest fits great."
4.0,"Beautiful but too small, i am 5'2 and they are too short"
4.0,Love this coat. Only thing that I could say is wrong is that they do run small. other then that I get many compliments about it
4.0,good item. and excellent choice.
4.0,slacks are as expected and very nice.
4.0,This was not very expensive and it is very pretty for the cost. I am worry the latch for the watch cover may not be very reliable.
4.0,I like the sunglasses. They do have a little weight to them that is reason for 4 stars. The lenses are fair they are great when sun is very bright. Like the oversized style.
4.0,It is more see see through than the pictures let on
4.0,Very pretty ring !
4.0,Very pretty but very thin fabric.
4.0,Nice watch. I work in construction and this watch stays clean after a long day of work.
4.0,my daughter loves these shoes but they did take some breaking in. the tongue rubbed my daughters skin raw so had to put bandaids for the first three or four times and now the bottoms are wearing out but she wears them almost every day since she got them.
4.0,Perfect fit. Super cute
4.0,"This dress fit exactly as expected given the size chart.  The neckline is a little more modest than I expected, but that's fine.  The fabric is quite thick, so I imagine it won't work well past spring weather, but that's fine!  The color is a bit more vibrant blue, but very close to the ad image."
4.0,Like the way it wraps and fits.
4.0,"So I was ready to give this a perfect review when I tried it on in the morning, but overtime, it kept bunching up on the bottom. I followed the size guide, but it's cut really long so if you're on the petite side, round down. I'm just not sure what that will mean width wise though. I like its thickness and darkness overall. It had minor streaks, but it didn't bother me. I would recommend."
4.0,This is actually a pretty good size.  Good for every day use.  Don't need to open the lock to put it on.  Looks pretty and was a nice price.
4.0,"Super soft and the material is fairly thick, so it doesn't feel cheap or rip easy."
4.0,Colors are so beautiful and quality is great. I'm not worried about straps wearing down. Love all the compartments as well. Only complaint is that it seems to stain easily- dirt doesn't come off with soap and water perhaps because it's waterproof?  I'll try a magic eraser soon and update this review. Otherwise we adore the set.
4.0,"Tried one pair, felt good. Purchased for a trip to Lisbon, plan to do a lot of walking up and down cobblestone streets. Will report back after the trip."
4.0,"This is very pretty and dainty, and the young woman I bought it for loved it. I gave it four stars because the chain is very delicate and I'm hoping it won't break."
4.0,I’ve received lots of compliments. Good quality
4.0,"These fit slightly small compared to the same size shoes and sneakers my son wears in the same size (size 8 toddler), BUT, they do fit him ok and should be fine for the summer. He also has wide feet and they slip on nicely and stay on without being too tight.  He's only worn them twice and they seem to be holding up fine so far.  They wear more like a sneaker which I think makes it easier for him to run around in.  I'd buy them again but go up a half size next time."
4.0,"Really pretty but for someone that wears an 8” bracelet, it’s too short and the end won’t stay under the loop."
4.0,Pockets too small
4.0,"Dress was too large, but the accessories were good"
4.0,Soft and compfortable material yet seems like good quality. Daughter loves it.
4.0,"This was a gift for my tween niece, and she loves it. I didn't try to put a photo in it, since I figured that was up to her to do, so I can't tell you if it's easy or not. I can say it's fairly easy to open and seems durable enough. It also certainly has the bling factor most girls (and women) enjoy."
4.0,These are very cute and comfortable!! I like the design and that they are platform bottoms they give me a few inches in height!! Made durable and sturdy!! Perfect for spring and summer! Great gift idea!
4.0,I liked that they went over my glass and I will be using them when I go to work.
4.0,Good replacement if you don't want to buy oakley replacement.
4.0,Wanted a slim wallet and decided to try this one. I love the color (yellow) and it's well made. My only issue is that the card  section is a tad small so I had to force some of my cards in.
4.0,"After 11 years of riding, I ended up crash testing these gloves on their first time out. I low sided my motorcycle when serving away from a vehicle that suddenly came into my lane, but I ended up mostly sliding from 35 mph to a stop on my stomach. I had my hands down the entire time, and the gloves did heir job. The palm completely ripped out of one, but didn’t leave a scratch on my hand. The other hand held up pretty nicely. Prior to crashing them, I found these to be some of the most comfortable gloves I’ve ever worn. The carbon fiber knuckle guard floats allowing your hands to bend without feeling constricting. They are good warm weather gloves as they breath easily. The Velcro fasteners also give you a good secure feeling. If you’re looking for a light weight glove that provides decent protection, I think these are a really good value. They won’t protect you like leather or like a much more expensive pair would, but they are fine for what you pay for them."
4.0,"Good quality shoe tree, love the cedar!"
4.0,I the material is mid weight. I love the fact it has pockets. I like the pattern. It runs big in crotch area and hip area . I got size small and still big.
4.0,Cute! Small but perfect for my SS charm bracelet!
4.0,Fits well really cute on I ordered the black and the green one happy with both
4.0,"The material is kind of thin, but the dress fits well and is pretty. I really like it!"
4.0,"I have a little belly fat, but this fit perfectly!  And it doesn't show my fat or other imperfections!"
4.0,Beautiful piece of jewelry fits perfect and looks adorable........ where’s my dad
4.0,"A little large, but overall as expected. Good quality."
4.0,It's nice and roomy. If your like me and have to carry several things to work it's nice to do it all in one bag.
4.0,"I love the product, but I only received 4 of the 6 colors pictured. I got them for a first grade class, and I would’ve appreciated more variety."
4.0,"Need a very small wrist to wear this, otherwise it is very pretty and looks great on my young Grandaughter."
4.0,"Mine fit as expected, it doesn't cover anything though. It is short, but pretty much looks like the picture. It also came long before it said it would. I really like it though, it's cute."
4.0,"I purchased this for my 4 year old daughter who wears between a 3t-4t clothing. They seem to run small, because it just fits her and I am still going to have to try to stretch it out before my friend's wedding in October."
4.0,Really cute suit. Material makes me feel hotter in the sun than other suits. Flattering cut.
4.0,"Love my mask as it has beautiful pictures of Bowie! The mask fits well I only have one issue and that’s the ear elastic tends to cause the mask to come off, so I’m constantly putting it back on. It does have the adjustable elastic to put over the ears but no matter if  I tighten or loosen it I cannot get it to stay put. So if you don’t mind a bit of adjusting it’s a good mask."
4.0,"This is my second time buying this wallet after 6 years of use. Its been through everything from sweat or being in water,stuffing it with cards/cash. Its made of tuff leather and the coin is classy. Definitely a kick ass product. Highly recommend this compared to others"
4.0,I bought this for a gift so hope she likes it.<br />This is the September birth stone and seemed like a nice gift idea.
4.0,"They look sleeker in the picture.  In reality, they are cheaper looking and not so glossy;  I like them because they give good arch support."
4.0,I got a size 40 because of the reviews and how everyone says they run small but a 40 is just a little big on me. I'm not sure if I lost weight or what and I'm not sure if a 38 would have fit and not as high waisted as I would have liked. But they are super cute and veryyyyy well made. Thinking about ordering another pair from them because I saw other ones that I really liked!
4.0,Love this shades. Simply stylish
4.0,Pretty nice for the price
4.0,"She loved it, Go Canes"
4.0,"Nice, dark lens color. Fairly good quality. 4 stars only because they feel slightly cheap around the ear pieces. Will buy again though!"
4.0,"These are nice laces and the color is as expected, but they are too long for my sneaker-boots (i.e. below ankle)."
4.0,"THe materials and all is good, but it’s too small to fit more than one credit card for example."
4.0,"Nice little dauber.  This will be my first time using a dauber, but I think it will do the job I expect of it."
4.0,can't  beat it for the price.  Looks great !
4.0,Nice new addition to my wardrobe!
4.0,"Oh, how I wish I were three inches taller!! These pants were the softest fabric EVER, but unfortunately a tad too long. On the tight side in my waist, too baggy in the limbs (I'm 5'2"" 110lbs). If you're tall and lean, get them - they feel like heaven!"
4.0,"I love these shoes! They're comfortable, cute, and I get plenty of compliments on them. My only regret is not getting them sooner! It's been 5 days since this review, and I must edit... These shoes SQUEAK VERY LOUDLY! I can't wear them anymore!"
4.0,Beautiful. Excellent gift quality.
4.0,"I don't love this blzaer because of the material, it's a very shiny and stretchy material that doesn't scream professional to me.  It fits fine but it's not a piece I would be able to wear to work.  It's more casual."
4.0,Nice design. Fits as I expected. Easy access when using toilet.
4.0,"This is a very well designed bag, although I think all &#34;limited edition&#34; bags might be test bags to see if the style will sell.  This is NOT made of the usual durable Baggalini fabric.  It's thinner and doesn't come through the wash as well.<br /><br />As for design, it's the perfect size for me, but there are so many pockets that sometimes I become frustrated trying to find something I've put in it.  I carry it every day and just hope it will hold up like all my other Baggalini bags."
4.0,"I'm 6'3&#34; and 163 pounds and X-Large fits perfectly. I was initially worried about getting it in X-Large because of my height and that it might be baggy because I'm like a twig, but I'm so glad this isn't the case and I'm not going as Tentpool. Another thing that's really cool about this is that the pistol I'm using fit right into the holster and continues to do so. Also love the various pouches on the belt and that each of them are functional. My only complaint is that the shoulder strap and second belt don't really sit at my waist and buckle about as low as my stomach. But other than that, great costume!"
4.0,Was only able to be work until my son was 6 months old
4.0,"I adore these little skulls; I only wished they were a brighter silver. They are more dull, in person. I used my size 4.5 ring for size reference. I used my own earring backs, because the ones that come with the earrings are a bit small for the size and weight of the earrings. I’ve decided to keep them, because they’re unique and fit my style."
4.0,Was just ok. But too small than I expected..
4.0,"This earrings are so cool, great for any one piece fan. I got these for Christmas from my girlfriend. I love these earrings but I guess I'm allergic to them cause if I wear them longer then 3 days it hurts my ears. But it don't turn ur green."
4.0,These worked great on ny daughter's white zip up jacket for Halloween. They stuck and stayed on all night. Haven't washed so can't speak to longevity. But did the job I purchased it for
4.0,I love these sandals and tried and tried to wear them but they have left blisters and scabs on my right ankle.  I feel so bad that I missed the return window.  I do love them but bleeding and scabs is no fun.
4.0,Colors are great. The twisty part is a little big. Can't beat the price though.
4.0,It looked just like picture. Very nice piece of jewelry.
4.0,Fits great. Great length
4.0,The material is nice and soft. Like the way it wraps around. the color is not like it is in the picture. the &#34;yellow or amber&#34; is more of a peach color.
4.0,"This seems good quality that is visible and functions well. A little bit small in my normal medium size. Delivery took longer than most Amazon products because it came out of China. Overall, a pretty good jersey."
4.0,"I bought both design for my girls who wear 4T and 6T, but had to return both for next bigger size. It fits just right, but touch short in length. Since my girls are big fans of Frozen II and they'll be wearing this multiple times, I've decided to go for bigger size. The quality is just as seen on the photos, and overall I'm happy with the product. Just beaware to grab next size up, unless you're planning on using it only once for Halloween."
4.0,"6’00” 180lbs.  Large fits perfect, maybe a little long for some but I don’t mind.  The bottom hem lands just below the top of my front pockets. Like these as undershirts.  Extremely comfortable.  Nice clean, sharp collar, not going to bacon on me. Very cool in the heat.  Only drawback: I had to cut out the sleeve hem.  It chaffed my underarms.  Probably just me as there was nothing wrong with the seams."
4.0,A good value for the price.
4.0,"I needed a lightweight sweater for my freezing office and this fit the bill. It is the perfect length, goes over the booty area and the 3/4 sleeve length is perfect. You really can't beat the price either. I will probably order some more colors."
4.0,Funciona genial sobre los lentes con fórmula. Económico y efectivo
4.0,"Very pretty dress, it was just too small."
4.0,Very retro and unique. A little tight on the sides of my face but not too uncomfortable.
4.0,He hasn’t wore
4.0,love these earring would definitely purchase again.  the do change color after a while but just the part the goes in your ear.  the part that goes in you ear is a little thicker then my normally earring so it took some time to get used to.
4.0,Haven't washed yet but love these. I'm 5'8&#34; and weigh 267 lbs. They fit great!
4.0,It is convenient for coverage and support but the glue doesn't last that long and it starts to take a different shape when it wears off.
4.0,"The fit for me is perfect. The fabric is very thin and cheap, and only a single layer of fabric. I might wear a short slip with it for the skirt. However, it was cheap so what do you expect? I already wore it and it's cute. I got the extra small, and I'm 5'6"", 29 inch waist, 39 inch hip. It's not too short. It probably won't last long, but it's a cute dress for summer, and I'm overall happy with it. Though you can see the fabric in the review photos is cheap. I put a safety pin to hold the top from gaping open also. You could also sew a small stitch to keep it closed, just like any wrap dress that happens."
4.0,Such a gorgeous dress for the bargin I got it for. The dress fit pretty nice over all. I did hem it a little in the hip area because that was the part that fit a little strange but now It fits great. The color is flattering. Some of the sequins did fall off but nothing noticable on the dress. Over all great for the price!
4.0,have to be careful if using socks on carpet.  work great on wood or tile. stay in place quite well.
4.0,The band becomes unhooked at times.
4.0,"The cloth ones make the waist band too large, the stretch ones work fine, but break too easily."
4.0,"This product only gets 4 stars because it's a little bug in the shoulders yet a little snug in the chest, YET It still looks great!<br /><br />As a consumer I haven't purchased a leather jacket in about 10 years. Purchasing a leather jacket online was a bit nerve racking but I took the risk. As it is fall, I wanted something that could be alil edgy but classic depending on the rest of my outfit & myou footwear. I saw this jacket & the one with the fur collar (both really cute) i settled on this and since it's arrival I immediately knew I had the right decision. I am 5 feet 5 inches tall, 1o0 pounds, 36D with most of my weight in my hips butt area. The jacket zips up and is comfy. The jacket does raise up alil around my butt but that is to be expected. Lol!<br /><br />What i appreciate from this seller is when I checked my previous orders and noticed the jacket price decreased from $179 to $155 they gave me the difference upon my request! So on that note they'll definitely get my business again if I want to purchase another jacket for myself or someone else!<br /><br />Thanks again! 🤓"
4.0,My fave color and I like the style of the bracelet.  I have a white one and I wear them both together.
4.0,Does a much better job of holding piercing open than the plastic I was using before. That being said I ordered it in a 16g and I think it is a bit small.
4.0,"They work really well for sunglasses, but they look like really cheap wood print"
4.0,"This item is very heavy and beautifully detailed. It might be too heavy to actually wear, however. I gave it to my musician boyfriend who is using it as an item in his miniature guitar collection."
4.0,"I love this band! Super pretty and I recieve many compliments. The reason for 4 stars it is somewhat difficult to resize it by yourself as it comes with a tooth for taking out individual bars, it took me a moment to figure it out. There was some frustration. But that could just be me!"
4.0,They adorable and sturdy but fit a little too snug. Hoping they will stretch a bit.
4.0,"Upon arrival, I hurriedly opened my package, to happily find that they do look the same as the picture, and that they felt very plush. I bought these as a gift to my best friend. Upon further examination however, I did find that not all the socks were the same size, while some look as if they would fit a mans foot of the size 10 or possibly 11, others of them fit my foot perfectly, and my shoe size is an 8 1/2 in womens. As you can see the size difference in the pictures I included.<br />I would recommend this for anyone who may want to split the pack with someone else with smaller feet, as they are very comfortable, and although I was worried that because of such a high amount of coolmax in them that they wouldn't be very warm, I was very much mistaken. They manage to keep even my toes (which are very easily cold) very toasty and warm. I also very much like the look, and overall do think they are wonderful socks. And will be splitting them with some of the men in my life."
4.0,I returned this item because I ordered up (XL) when there was no need; ample room. The fabric was very soft.  I will<br />reorder a large as this top will be convenient for my chemo treatments.
4.0,"Good quality, I choose too big for me but I can fix it. I like it"
4.0,"Michele Yip Women's Bohemian Embroidery Floral Tunic Shift Blouse Flowy Mini Dress<br />like most material, thin but cute"
4.0,wore a few weeks to loosen up.part was just what I ordered and fit was great. had very good insoles would order again shipping was fast.
4.0,They look good and fit well.  Only drawback is that they wrinkle easily.
4.0,This is a good product with a nice fit good size for ears  and eyebrow a bit to narrow for the nose but you can bend them to widen the hoop and bend it back into place if you like to live dangerously.
4.0,"The color and look of the sequins is great. If you move your hand over it the color changes from green to black. The strap and zipper are not the best though. I ripped the strap while trying to unzip it after a few wears. Will have to sew it back together. I would recommend holding the pack with one hand and unzipping with the other, rather than using one hand to unzip."
4.0,"Very adorable and cute!  But, runs so small!  I give this 4 stars.  It is extremely cute.  But the Elsa one runs small.  My 6 year old has an average size head but it's obviously small on her.  She loves it anyway.  I hope it lasts awhile...."
4.0,"Nice appearance. Semi-cheap feel with texture and weight, but overall good buy."
4.0,I purchased as a gift but may keep it myself!  More than I really expected!
4.0,"The only things wrong is the ball on top isn’t attached very well. Otherwise, it’s great. My son loved it!"
4.0,"Ordered a Medium/XXL-their size. I am about 5'8, and weight about 160. Have not actually wore the shirt yet but it's a good quality material, and it looked really nice when I tried it. The only bad thing is that it was a little loose from the waist (I like it a little tight), and the sleeves were about an inch short."
4.0,This was bought for a theater production. It’s cute. Vintage look.
4.0,"Comfy sandals, but straps across top of feet are baggy, not snug fit.  I decided to keep them because the inside soles are cushiony."
4.0,Glass is good for the price but the case provided is not useful it's very small for the glass
4.0,"It's a pre-fab costume. It is what it is. Lol! It fits great from the waist down but swallows me up top. But I have a pear shape body so I expected that. Just a little alteration and it will be fine. The skirt is a little see through so I'll be wearing white shorts underneath. The headdress is a little wrinkled and floppy from how it was folded in shipping, but I think a little glue and a stiff paper backing will solve that - I'm afraid to try ironing it for fear of melting the polyester fabric. There are no washing instructions anywhere on the garment or the packaging so you have to use your best judgment there. All in all, it's what I expected. I'm a huge She-ra fan so I'm excited to wear it trick-or-treating with my family!"
4.0,"I enjoy the necklace. It’s very cute and my kids names look really nice on the hearts.  There are a few dislikes about it.  The hearts feel flimsy, there’s no way to keep the hearts in the correct position.  I would reorder"
4.0,Only good 👍
4.0,I would of liked it just a little longer
4.0,"Fit perfectly when i got it, shrunk a lotafter first wash"
4.0,"The shirt wears and washes well. I have gotten a few compliments on it. It’s dressier than a simple plain T-shirt. I usually wear it with a pair of black yoga pants, but I think you could dress it up nicer if you wanted. I was going for casual but wanted to look like I put a little effort into trying to dress cute. I’m a 38c pear shape. The medium fits well."
4.0,"When I opened the classic style box I was immediately impressed with just the look of the watch.  I asked my nephew how much did he think I spent on it and he said ""a couple hundred dollars?""  He said he wanted one.  I gave this a 4-star because the leather band is very stiff and a very very slight problem with its positioning.  But, all in you cant beat the price for such a nice looking piece."
4.0,"I am 5’2” and weigh 115 lbs. I lift weights regularly so my arms are trim and toned. The armies of the size small I found too small. It is wearable but about 2 seconds away from uncomfortable. However the rest fits perfectly, in a peasant blouse type of style. The material is excellent, the trim beautiful and looks handsewn, although I’m sure it isn’t. It has pockets - great idea! - and it washes well. Despite the armholes size small was the right size for me as a medium would have engulfed me."
4.0,It's a great product when you first buy it but the quality deteriorates over a year or so. It's not Oragami Owl but it's beautiful and can be passed off as expensive. The item does tarnish and the &#34;diamond&#34; will fall out no matter how careful you are.
4.0,A tiny bit faded in color but perfect otherwise.
4.0,"I was expecting the necklace to be a deeper shade of green, instead it is a light shade of green.  Very Pretty Necklace.  Fast Shipping.  Received ahead of schedule."
4.0,"It's good, if not great, for the price.  Im several months in with them and 3 of them have already loosened at one end but 9 more remain.  At this rate I'll probably lose the all by end of this year. :P They legit though"
4.0,"The pants are good quality , but they are supposed to be short, but way too long"
4.0,I liked this top. Definitely size up if you have a bigger chest/shoulder area. I wear a 36DD & can usually fit a large top but I had to exchange for an XL and it fit fine.
4.0,"This Apron is Cute ! I rated a 4 star only because I wish the tie strings were a little longer but over all this is a great apron ! the fabric is lightweight ( Poly/Cotton combo) , it repels liquids ,it washes nicely and so lightweight there really is no need to put it in the dryer  , and it resists wrinkles too lol , the pockets are great and the dogs are cute as well  :)<br />I have other Aprons that I don't like as much as this one and their tie strings are longer . I received this Apron as part of a promotion and I really didn't know what to expect . I really was pleasantly surprised !! I really like the fact they have a 30 Day money back guarantee .That for one tells me they stand behind their product ! They offer a variety of colors and they also offer a unique bonus A Downloadable PDF Copy of the Master Chef Guide Book &#34;Untold  secrets of Master Chefs Kitchen&#34; how great is that ?  I would recommend this apron :)"
4.0,Had them before & wanted more.. happy with the product.
4.0,I like this one a lot. The material is like a swimsuit and the comfort is unbeatable. I recommend if u like to be free when you're clothed 😜
4.0,"I like this band very much, but it is a bit of a struggle to open. That's probably a  blessing in disguise, since I don't worry about losing my flex2."
4.0,For is looser than I’d wanted - I went according to size chart and probably should have sized down
4.0,"I'm just returning to work in a school setting after the pandemic started, so I'm in need of fabric face masks. It is shaped to fit around the nose. Just be aware that these masks do not have the firm nose (something that models over the nose) and the fabric you can see through. Of course, I wear disposable masks underneath for extra protection. You can add a filter to these masks if you have them. The size medium fits me well as an average-sized female.  The ear loops are ties, which is OK for me because I use a headband to hold the mask.  But, I doubt the ties are comfortable if used on the ears. Washed and dried well with my regular laundry, no special care needed.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!"
4.0,This &#34;small duffel&#34; is significantly larger than the old style small duffel!  Bought it as a replacement for an older version that I had for many years and use to carry workout clothes back & forth from a fitness club. It will hold a lot (more than I need) but I find that it is almost too roomy & large for me.  It's a snugger fit in the lockers that I use and just bulkier to manage.  Love the pattern!
4.0,It was an OK sweater not quite as baggy as I expected the sleeves were fitted not loose but still nice.
4.0,"Nice, but chain is short and numerals are not upright so its difficult to see the time. Very pretty though and the chain is very nice also, just too short. And I love ladybugs so it had my name on it."
4.0,Stand tall and proud in this garment
4.0,beautiful but the clasp is so tiny it is difficult to open
4.0,Very cute shoes. They do not offer a lot of support and shouldn't be worn for gym days or for playing sports. But for every day school shoes they are super cute. My son loves them.
4.0,I like to wear this around town while running errands. It's also nice to wear for a casual dinner.
4.0,Though 2 of the circles came off during the route to my home. I love the product after my husband fixed the o-rings that fell off in transition. I would purchase from this seller again.
4.0,"They get plenty warm. unfortunately, the button gets pushed quite often by the strap over the back of the hand. I'm thinking of cutting the strap off. Maybe that will help?"
4.0,I ordered two necklaces and one is beautiful with vibrant colors. The second is very dull and cloudy looking.
4.0,Cute and fits me including my 8 yr old. The stitching can undone on one ear after wash and dry.
4.0,"Great little shell jacket.  Has been super handy since it has rained almost every day since i bought it. Whether in the bleachers while the kids play sports or in and out of the truck at work, it was a great purchase."
4.0,Nice watch<br />The stretch part the band could use 1or2 more links
4.0,Nicely made. Not cheap looking at all.  My daughter loved it for Mother's Day.
4.0,"Thus far, love the sizes and quality to it. Will be using them for the first time in March, hoping they are strong enough for airport handling."
4.0,My granddaughter wear them all the time!
4.0,Love these shirts but very see though
4.0,Nice!! Strong
4.0,"You may need someone to help you get into the sports bra. It is very cute but a little snug. Of course, I was trying to put this on over a tank top and a front hook bra. It may fit fine when I just try it on and have my husband help me with the straps."
4.0,"I loved the color and the fit. However, it's difficult to get the wrinkles out after washing it. I tried to take it out of the dryer while it's still damp. I was hoping that I didn't have to iron it."
4.0,Super cute. Slightly tight for me across the busy.
4.0,"I'm pretty pleased with this costume. Because I'm only 5'2&#34; & apple-shaped, I have minimal luck with these full-body costumes because either the top or lower component does not fit. I knew that I would have to buy a Large because of the sweatshirt (I have a 38D bust, & it fit well). As expected the skirt & tights were a bit long, but it's easier to manipulate parts of the costume that are too big/long than small/short. I have long, black hair, so I didn't even bother with the wig. The candy detail on the wig is nice, but the wig itself is a bit ridiculous-looking & bulky. I was impressed with the overall detail of the costume."
4.0,"Super cute cases! One of mine was damaged and dented in on the top which makes it not close which is unfortunate. Otherwise, I think they are great. I gave it 3 stars for sturdiness and durability because they came a bit damaged."
4.0,Very pretty and well made but WAY too big.
4.0,A little thin and it is cut way too low. The cut was easily adjusted with a saftey pin. You could also add a few stitches to make it permanent. Cute and nice material.
4.0,"I am 5' 2&#34; and 130 lbs. These were very long and needed to be cut and hemmed. Otherwise, they fit well."
4.0,I bought this for a Halloween costume and found it to be high quality especially since I soent around $10. The opening mechinisim is smooth and was easy for my daughter to open on her own.
4.0,"Very light weight, a bit smaller than expected, need to be ironed, but fit reasonably well, go over my cast, which is why I got them."
4.0,"I got them for my girlfriend for Christmas. She likes them so much I ended up buyOmg another pair for her mother as a present as well. They love how soft and comfy the inside of the gloves are. They also look really nice, and the color seems to match a lot of her outfits...which I was told is a very important thing to consider. They didn’t get 5 starts because we are starting to be concerned about long term durability. The yarn is getting a little frayed and an inside seem is starting to come undone, but nothing major and I doubt anyone had noticed except her. She wears them everyday, so Wewr and test is expected anyway. Even if they don’t last until next winter, $10 is a steal! Highly recommend, great winter gift or stocking stuffer."
4.0,Thin material good fit
4.0,"This ""dress"" was just too short for my 5'4"" frame.  I gave it to my daughter.  She loved it."
4.0,"They sit great, feel very comfy while on but I just wish they were maybe an inch longer."
4.0,Very warm! Have a really good grip on the floor and confortable to use in heavy winter. They do get scratched easily but are great for the use they intend
4.0,"I love the color and design, but my petite frame means the legs are too long. I'm going to order down a size and hope it resolves the issue. Very comfortable! Perfect for summer nights!"
4.0,"They are waterproof, put under a running faucet.<br />Not cold enough yet to see how warm they'll keep my hands, but going to Chicago soon so thats when I get to test them."
4.0,I enjoyed my burgundy one so much that I just had to get another one as a backup.
4.0,"This is a wonderful dress with fabric that feels a bit on the heavy side, but drapes beautifully. It nicely covers up any bulges while having enough stretch to make it really comfortable. I took one star off for these, easily fixed, problems: The label is stitched with nylon threading and it is absolutely itchy, took that out and that was that. The armholes were a bit on the large side, so I will adjust that myself and finally I will need to adjust the placement of the buttons. I am usually a 36B/C, but the bust area needs a bit more adjusting for it not to pull in the size large. I think that too is a minor adjustment and with the price it was, I could even spare a few $$$ and have that done by a taylor. Looking forward to getting lots of wear out of it!"
4.0,Its effective! Satisfied for sure and would recommend.
4.0,"Sonja 3/4 sleeve ribbed knit tunic top.  I ordered a large and it fits like a large.  I am 5'4, 115lbs, and a 34D chest.  I should have ordered a medium as the large us just a bit to big on me through the waist area. The top is a very pretty oatmeal color and is a true tunic style top. This looks great with leggings and skinny jeans.  I like the vneck with the buttons and the 3/4 slitted sleeves. The top is a medium weight knit and soft and comfortable.  Quality made shirt with a nice fit."
4.0,Very very blingy but fun to wear and will be great around the holidays
4.0,I like it and am happy with my purchase.
4.0,"Loved it, loved the length , would have like the fabric to be a little thicker but I would buy in another style."
4.0,Wife uses to keep her scooter key attached to her wrist
4.0,It fits perfectly if you’re under 5’7” maybe but I’m 5’8” and it is a bit snug vertically. Still wearable and cute
4.0,"They are so pretty but the stone is all jagged and uneven which is odd, I’m sure it’s supposed to look like a legit stone however. Just not for me."
4.0,I liked the vest but was sent the wrong size twice! So I'm just returning it..I need a womens size large & was sent 3XL
4.0,"My approval and disapproval of this item varies.<br />It works as intended,  keeps your face warm and snug, and the strap that tightens works great as well.<br />Only downside is that the coloring is wayyyyyyyyy off. It seems more pastel than dark colors. It doesn't match my Jacket or my Ruck ( Both Flecktarn)."
4.0,Nice pendant on an adjustable leather necklace.  Pendant is made of solid heavy material.  Like the design of the dogs/wolves.
4.0,"These were perfect for a medevial themed wedding I attended. Were so easy to slip on and off. Gave 4 starts because after wearing them a few times, the rubber loosened up too much and they were at tight-fitting. Would be good if you ears were bigger."
4.0,The dress is super soft & matched the description perfectly!
4.0,The stone itself is more clear than luminescent but it grew on me and I didn't want to exchange for a new one. I get s lot of compliments on this ring!
4.0,"Following the size chart, I originally ordered size medium for my husband. They fit him around the waist, but he said they were too restrictive when moving. Customer service was friendly and helpful, so I returned the mediums to replace with large. They are more roomy and comfortable."
4.0,"I really like this dress and the way it looks! However, I ordered the army green color and it looks more like brown. I’m kinda bummed since I was really looking forward to an olive green type dress. I’m considering returning for a different color."
4.0,Nice quality. Look just like the picture.
4.0,"Cute, but definitely order a size up."
4.0,"Had to exchange for bigger size, but I love the lightweightfabric and cheerful bright color. I usually wear a 12, but the 14 in these fit much better. I'm 5'7&#34; athletic build. Not too short, not too long."
4.0,"This is a nice bathing suit, but just not for my body type.  I may have needed to order one size smaller, but I fear it won't fit me in the chest if I do that.  Also, it does not quite provide enough support in that area.  I would say that it's more for younger 'perkier' ladies, if you know what I mean."
4.0,"Lovely earrings. Just as described. I gave 4 stars due to how they were packaged to ship. They were fastened to a cardboard and placed in a cellophane bag. The earrings came with bent posts, they had been crushed in shipping. I considered returning them but I was able to sorta fix them without breaking the post off. I would suggest they be shipped in a carton."
4.0,Producto bueno. Satisfecho con la compra
4.0,"Very cute and lightweight. Not sure how long they’ll last due to the quality, but given the low price I’m ok with only getting a few trips out of them!"
4.0,I always struggle to find sunglasses that look good on my wide face so I’m glad I came across these beauties! They are so comfortable and actually fit properly and look attractive on me. I love the mirrored lenses and the rose gold frame. They are pretty light weight and only included a dust bag rather than an actual case which is a bummer. The quality seems just ok but they’ve held up to daily wear so far no issues. Overall I’m happy with them.
4.0,Medium was a little bit bigger than expected but fit fine. Love these pants.
4.0,Super kawaii!
4.0,"The fit for this is great. It's light, so I would say it's more of a Spring/Fall hoodie if you want to wear it every day. For casual cosplay it is kind of perfect. My only reason for not giving it a 5 was the fact that part of the zipper was stained red when I got it, which was kind of upsetting."
4.0,"This maxi dress is so soft, and I like how simplistic it is.  It also hit right at my ankles (I'm 5'2''), so I was very pleased with that as well.  The only slight negative was that the straps were a bit loose on my shoulders."
4.0,Lightweight jacket.  Cute style.
4.0,A bit large in the waist and too long but I took it in and hemmed the skirt.  The color is gorgeous.  Haven't worn it as of this review but I expect to get many compliments.  I love it.
4.0,"reviews are very true.  I'm 140lbs, 5'4, and wear a medium.  I purchased the XL based on reviews of it running small - so true!  Four stars because I thought the feathers were black, note - they are navy blue.  Not too thin, but some may prefer an under shirt as well."
4.0,"The only problem is the attached belt is too high.  Which is very strange because I am petite with short torso, and it's higher than my waist.  I wonder if I got an odd one."
4.0,I am a chub monster in the thigh region so I have issues with them staying up. They rest about two inches above my knees on their own. They'll probably fit perfectly for anyone smaller than a women's 14 pants size
4.0,"I loved these leggings but the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I started to wear them. When I got down to the last one of the 3, it could not fit. The tag was torn off so there was no size but just from the looks of it , it was way smaller than the previous two that I wore already. It's a totally different size like an ex small. I can't get through to customer service so I hope I can get some form of resolve from here on.  Other than this issue I would have bought these leggings again."
4.0,"Not quite long enough.  Your picture shows long ones, mine were much shorter and needed about 1 1/2 inches longer in length."
4.0,Great forvworking outdoors
4.0,Very warm but they're a little stiff. They look great.
4.0,Love these but run a full size too big! Returned for a smaller size and they are perfect! Very cute!
4.0,Looks adorable! Comfy and got many compliments while traveling.
4.0,Cute shorts. They are great for swimming. The only issue I had with them is that they were a bit tight around my legs. I have thick legs though so I don’t think it’s an issue with how they’re made.
4.0,Like the sturdiness of the fabric.<br />Nice summer wear.
4.0,"Like it!!! It's stitched silicone rubber, so you can get it wet. The clasp has held up well. Casual, but stylish. Would buiy again"
4.0,Bought to use as wind chill garmet under a motorcycle jacket.  Am very comfortable in under 50 weather at 50plus mph.
4.0,"The skirt is long for my average height 2 year old.  Other than that, completely adorable."
4.0,The wallet is pretty and durable. It could use extra pockets for cards but other than that it has lots of space for coin and paper money.
4.0,"These are quality socks! I didn't go 5 stars because they could be a bit longer up the calf. If they were 1-2 inches longer then I'd say its the best &#34;bang for the buck&#34; in the sock game. With that said, I am very pleased, will be ordering more and also giving a few set boxes out to friends for presents!"
4.0,"I bought a size up, and it fits Ok. Comfy, and doesn’t make the rubbing noise other inexpensive hiking pants do (which I hate). Good for hiking in the heat. The waist is a bit too high. Not the most flattering, but does the job."
4.0,They were reasonably priced for the look and feel of the boot. A little hard to put on but after all it's laces.
4.0,"Nice quality sweater, but really short. I am 5'7"" and it showed my belly button, which for me does not work.  I am wearing a sweater to be warm and cozy. Sizing up would not have worked. It would probably work for someone smaller in stature."
4.0,I love this shirt.very stylish and well made however runs on the smaller side!!!
4.0,"This dress turned out beautiful for my daughter to attend a prom-like social event last night!!!! It fit well, zipper strong and length appropriate!!"
4.0,I ordered only this dress and I received it.<br />I have not ordered anything else.
4.0,Been looking for a unique colorblock sweater and I finally found the one! I think it looks great and is very stylish. Perfect for work and school!
4.0,If you're a half size definitely size up. I wear a size 6-61/2 and I purchased a 7. Fit tight but fit. Definitely don't get an 8 unless you've got wide feet. The strings come out of the eyelets when taking them off so you'll have to relace them about halfway up every time. But not a big deal. They aren't horrible when it comes to comfort but you'll definitely have to get used to them and break them in if you're like me and you don't wear heels alot. Looks great with any costume. And the box it comes in is very pretty. Overall I'm very happy
4.0,"Pretty necklace overall, but the chain is WAYYYYYYY too long... I had to buy a separate shorter chain as this one hangs all the way down to the center of my chest. The chain it comes with is about twice as long as a standard necklace chain. I love the pendant part but do wish it came with a shorter chain, or at least one short and one long chain, instead of just the long chain."
4.0,it came the same colors as in the picture
4.0,Decent quality looks cute
4.0,"comfortable, acceptable looking, I like the three pockets, just what I wanted."
4.0,Definitely kind of small but I do like it! I bought in black and pink 💕 was looking for new bathing suits as I just gave birth nine and a half months ago and these were budget friendly and they look great. The pads are super tiny though so they look a little awkward to me but I also have D cups and ordered a small 🤣
4.0,Ok they do work but the fitting instructions are terrible! You have to screw in from the inside of eyelet.
4.0,Nice product packed in nice purple pouch
4.0,"I bought this wallet for my 14 year old for Christmas, and he's very happy with it.  He often carries change, so I got this one because of the zippered compartment.  The leather is nice and it's good quality.  The zipper does add a considerable amount of bulk though, and I wish there were more card slots.  For someone his age though, it fits the bill."
4.0,"First off, follow P.E.'s size chart. They said my fat *** needed a 2XL. I bought a 2XL. A 2XL fits perfectly, even with padded slide shorts under it.<br /><br />Pants are lighter weight than I expected. I don't recall what brand and model of pants I had when I last played paintball nearly a decade ago, but I recall how they felt. These P.E. Program pants are lighter, more comfortable, and have more stretchy panels to keep you moving freely. Haven't played in them just yet, so I'm not certain on how well they breathe, but there has to be a trade off somewhere. If they are durable and keep me mobile then I don't mind if they run a little warm.<br /><br />Zip, velcro, and button/snap fly for ease of entry and exit. Two velcro cinch straps on the sides of the waist to snug them to your waist. Elastic bands / pull strings at the ankles to keep them out from under your shoes. Awesomely, there are little velcro straps at the ankles too to hold the length of elastic cord you pull so it's not flopping around and getting snagged on things.<br /><br />No padding in the hips, butt, or groin, but that's what slide shorts are for. There is padding in the knees, but for its thickness it's too soft to really save you. It's low density foam so it's very soft and flexible. If you are in a bunker and decide to kneel down it'll cushion your knee. If you are running, diving, and hitting a rock or root or obstacle with your knee you're likely bruising and potentially breaking your knee caps. I don't know if any pant actually provides enough padding for that kind of use, and that's why stand-alone knee pad products exist. If you're walking around in the woods and just hiding behind stuff...probably good enough. If you're aggressive and diving around the speedball course, maybe good since those don't get setup in the woods or on a parking lot. For anyone getting aggressive in the woods, plan accordingly."
4.0,Really cute suit. Fit perfectly. I'm 5'8&#34; and 130 lbs so based on the previous reviews I ordered a large. Only thing I didn't care for were the insert cups. They sorta started moving to the center to create a weird uni-boob. Just removed them.
4.0,"The watch is everything I thought it would be, nice.  My only concern is the watch mechanicsm.the stem feel cheap and flemsly. It feels cheap and as if it will break easily.  Si far,,  it  has NOT"
4.0,"I was advised by my cardiologist to wear support stockings  or support socks, and these are easier to put on and feel good on my legs.  I wear size 8 1/2 shoe and I bought the small /medium size."
4.0,"Bought it for my wife and she really liked it. She said it even looked better than in the picture. It is a very good quality, sturdy purse. She said she liked it even better than some of her other conceal carry purses. The only thing is her gun will not fit in the conceal carry compartment and she carries a small compact Kimber 3.5 inch barrel, which she was really disappointed about. It is a very small gun and fits in all the other conceal carry purses she has bought....which is a lot. Women can never have too many purses. That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. Other than that she was very happy with it.I have to say that I was given a discount on this product to do an honest review and it is an honest opinion."
4.0,This is sexy dress with the plunging neck line!
4.0,I personally don't like the tongue for the young age group.
4.0,"top fit perfectly, bottom's are a little small"
4.0,"Cute fit, fabric was nice breathable material the only issue I had is that the bottoms didn’t quite fit like they were suppose to and they are not ankle length like I thought they would be. But the top is my absolute favorite when worn I paired it with a pair of jeans and it gave what it was suppose to give!!!!"
4.0,"This belt is way longer than my husband needed, but it was easy to drill extra holes to make it fit.  Since it is solid leather without any beveling, you could easily trim the pointed end shorter too, if you wanted to.  The leather seems legit rather than some bonded crud that's going to fall apart in 3 months.  I took off one star for the way the buckle is attached to the belt.  There are four stitches of red and tan thread holding it together.  They look cheesy and could be a weak point in an otherwise very sturdy belt.  I'd have rather seen some rivets there.  Other than that, its a perfectly fine belt for jeans or casual pants."
4.0,"Was a very cute dress, but it took so long to come that it did not fit my step-daughter by the time it arrived. It was good quality material though, and was super cute."
4.0,looked like a maternity shirt gave it to a prego friend but i did like it and it was comfortable
4.0,"Excellent size and good quality,<br /><br />Very nice for everyday<br /><br />No problems in shipping and very safe seller"
4.0,"Really comfy top, fit as expected. Double hoodie is a little weird as the solid inner hoodie is smaller than the outer hoodie. Kinda funky to get right."
4.0,"It gets tangled with my other earring.<br />It’s light, easy to adjust and cool. Looks like I have 3 holes but really I have two as shown on picture.. I like it also because it’s simple and delicate."
4.0,"I honestly didn't have high hopes for this dress due to the low pricing, but it was a pleasant surprise to say the least. The material was a really good The colors are true to what I saw on the site as well. I will say, as far as sizing goes, the guide was correct. However, if someone is extremely large chested (as in our case) you may want to size more according to chest measurements. The bow does come off as well. Purchased for my step daughter's senior photos and it was perfect."
4.0,"I was looking for a present for a teenage guy for Christmas, and i stumbled upon this necklace. It seemed like the perfect present for him, considering his current obsession with martial arts. I still havent given him the present, so im not sure how much he'll like it. I am only giving it a 4/5 stars because i havent seen his reaction when he sees it. But overall, it looks well-made, leather feels nice, and, i hope he likes it"
4.0,Good size for a 3year old!
4.0,Very quick shipping. Thank you! It's darker than it appears in the pic but no biggie. A little box would have been nice. It's a gift. But I'm sure the person getting this will enjoy it.
4.0,If you have a slight big belly then it fits tight there (hugs belly)
4.0,cute but not tight enough to fit my head nicely and I have a big head.
4.0,"My first one just broke, I'm going to buy another one. I wear/wore this while surfing and playing soccer. It just broke two days ago while surfing. Apparently &#34;water resistant&#34; wasn't good enough for the past week's swell or I wasn't a good enough surfer.<br /><br />Still, I like the watch. It's light, fairly durable, does what I need it to do."
4.0,I love this ring! I wear it quite often.  I got it in rose gold plate and it looks real.  My only problem is that it irritates my admittedly very sensitive skin.  The czs rub against my other fingers.  I'm probably just not cut out to wear rings with stones all the way around.
4.0,"Granddaughter was looking for these, so glad I checked out it."
4.0,Worked great while making and International flight. Legs didn't swell at all.
4.0,"I was so happy to find this style of hat, because it's perfect for my face. This manufacturer runs a little large, so I need to pay attention to the shape a lot through the day."
4.0,"This is exactly as described. It's felt, the measurements are as stated and the color looks EXACTLY as the photo suggests, but still, I just don't know how I feel about it. Before I purchased it, I read where some say that it is ""bulky"" and I agree. It's not that it's heavy or anything is technically ""wrong"" with it, but IDK it's just that having it there seems to block something about the inside. Maybe I'll have to get used to it. I have purchased the nylon type handbag organizers before. I didn't feel that way about those, but I decided to try these, though more expensive, because I thought they'd give the bag  more shape/structure. Well, it does but something just feels ""off"" about it. I think it's just that it's so tall inside my bag in particular (Speedy 40), and that it has outside pockets which are not easily accessible unless you remove the entire insert, which isn't easily don't when stuffed with your items. I think it's that or the fact the felt is an unattractive material when you place it inside of a luxury handbag. Maybe that's what throws things off. IDK...just giving ""my"" honest opinion. YMMV<br />Thanks for reading my review. I hope this helps."
4.0,Good looking and comfortable hat. Found the same hat for 8 bucks less with free shipping on EBay.
4.0,"After reading reviews this jersey runs small, I usually wear a large / or xl. I decided to go up a size for 2xl however was out of stock. Wound up with a 3xl which fits a bit loose.  A 2xl would have worked nicely."
4.0,But very nice quality fabric and nice print.
4.0,"Cute shirt, my only issue was the pocket was crooked on the shirt. I was able to overlook this because it’s so comfy and cute!"
4.0,"Breathable soft socks. Love the material. Buy them bigger, one size bigger to fit right, definitely. They might shrink washing them with warm water besides the fact that come a bit smaller than what is expected."
4.0,They are pretty cute
4.0,"Yes it is a good one, i love it"
4.0,"The neck is larger than expected and the material is thin. Otherwise, the fit and style are ok."
4.0,The boots are comfortable. Good price. I have to polish them up really good for work
4.0,I am a person who does not carry a purse and getting it into and out of my back pocket can sometimes be a bit of a struggle depending on what I am wearing.  If I carried a purse I will give it a five .
4.0,"These run tall. I'm 5'5 and they come up a little over my knees, which is not comfortable in compression and not advised to have wrinkles because it changes the compression. I just wore them baggy on the feet so I could adjust them. Other than that, they are comfortable and work well for wearing all day at work, then running in after. I wear compression for medical reasons and I have a large scar on one calf. Having the socks come up over the scar is okay, but the wrinkling behind my knee where part of the scar is, didn't work great for me, but I put up with it which is the case sometimes when one has a specific issue."
4.0,"For an average person like me, the description of 0.66 gr. doesn't really give an accurate description on size of the product. They are 1/2&#34; in diameter total size. They are smaller than I thought. But really pretty. The diamond-cut on the hoops really make the earrings shine."
4.0,"I gave them to a coworker , they were to strong for my eyes"
4.0,I found these to be good quality and comfortable. 3 swim sessions with them so far.
4.0,The slit up the leg was higher than I expected but it fit great!
4.0,I bought this robe as a gift for my friend. The photo was as expected if not better it was a very plush and soft robe and fits as expected. She was a size medium to large which fit her just great. I got it for her so she would be warm and comfortable while working at her desk. Would highly recommend this as a gift.
4.0,"Not sure what the red tab does, looks ok ."
4.0,Very odd material and heavy dress but I do like it.  It is difficult to get on so I reordered the next size larger hoping it will be easier to get on.  It is very stretchy.
4.0,"Me gusta, muy buena presentación, hermoso estuche. Lo unico, no es delgado cómo esperaba."
4.0,Yes sir
4.0,"This dress looks very nice on. I wore it for homecoming, and it fit nicely, the bottom was comfortable, and the length perfect. My only complaint is where the seams are on the mesh is very uncomfortable on the skin, it's very itchy. Other than that, good product. The pockets are a nice touch, and the zipper is well made compared to other dresses I have tried."
4.0,"I ordered the cap sleeve and got the tank style dress. Did not really mind so I kept it. It fits nice without being too tight.  I possible could have gone a size down because the dress has some stretch, but was more comfortable with not having a super tight dress."
4.0,The bottom fit a size bigger. But I like the top .
4.0,Ordered L but fits like a XXL! Way too big. I normally wear M shirts but like nightgowns loose so ordered a L. Beware extremely large. Nice fabric though!
4.0,"Product arrived and looked nearly identical to the online image, the only difference being that online it looks like one red fabric is used, but the actual bag utilizes three different reds (Bright red on the sides, and a mix of brick and burgundy to make up the center rose). The shape is also a little bit different and is much bigger in real life. Good purchase for a costume bag."
4.0,"I really loved this romper, it was decent quality for the price, was roomy and comfortable, very flattering overall BUT I did end up returning it only because I have a long torso and as much as I wanted to overlook it, it was noticeably ill fitting in my midsection once I was moving around.  I still gave it 4 stars, it's really cute for those of you with shorter torsos."
4.0,My daughter just received the robe and said it is the softest thing that she's ever worn.  Absolutely loves the hood.  Washed it to see if the fuzzy shedding would stop or else would have given it 5 stars.  Fit is perfect!
4.0,"Beautiful dress, Happy costumer, Very Thankful !!"
4.0,"This is a nice hat and the screen is detachable and good quality. It was just sadly, too large for my head."
4.0,"The bag in the online picture appeared bigger than it's actual size when it arrived.  Although I had thought it would be bigger, the quality of the bag is well-made and I decided to keep the item as it's nice."
4.0,I really loved this blouse it's  great for a petite person to wear with  leggings I was pleasantly surprised by the sheer side panel it added a dressier touch
4.0,Nice Material and fits perfect.  The band in the bottom is a little snug but has loosen with washings.
4.0,"Great product. I wish i could have found one with a better design, but this is a great knit cap. Perfect size."
4.0,"I'm glad these have compression but they are a little tight. Be sure and measure your body and buy appropriately. I ordered what I would normally wear and they were a little too small. I'm making them work. Not a lot of stretch in these and maybe that's why they are had to get on but the compression is exactly what I need. I wish there were compression legging that came if cool artistic patterns, don't you?"
4.0,Date changes thought day and gets slow sometimes by a few seconds but greater other wise
4.0,The weaving look belt is shipped with a black bag make it a great gift. My dad is usually wear size S or M and this belt runs a little bit long for him. But it is easy to adjust the length so it is not a big problem. I think it probably will fit better for men with size M to L.<br />The belt is thick and looks quite durable. The weaving pattern is delicate. It may not be a good belt for business suit because of the weaving pattern. But it fits jeans and short very well. Overall we are satisfied with this belt.
4.0,Good boxers one pair broke right along the seem of the right side but other then that they are good boxers
4.0,"This ring fit well, but I thought the opal was set a little high, so it snags easily. The ""opal"" was really just glittery plastic and the silver was discolored in some spots. I paid more for shipping than the product so I wasn't expecting anything super high in quality. Cute, but cheap. It arrived weeks before I expected it."
4.0,These ar very cute but didn't fit me well
4.0,"I love the astetic,  however they aren't the most durable."
4.0,"It’s a nice microfleece pyjama.  However the top is rather small for a size 8. It’s a bit short on my 7 yr old, but the pants are long."
4.0,It was perfect !! I had to pin closed at V because too low but other than that loved dress!! I’m 5’5 and 196 large booty lol  and 36 DD Brest . It was flattering and comfortable!!!
4.0,"A very classy looking, thin, dress watch at an incredibly low price.  It even comes with a spare battery and a tool for adjusting the clasp of the metal mesh band."
4.0,A fun necklace.
4.0,"These are much better than another pair I purchased from a different company for slightly cheaper. The hinges are the spring back style which I really like especially since they are slightly small on my head. They are super reflective and the tint is at the right level to be able to see things inside while still blocking out plenty of light outside.<br /><br />My only issue is that the lenses are a bit too reflective on the inside so you get &#34;reverse&#34; glare of the lenses from things behind you. Other than that these are great sunglasses at this price point. I have not worn them long so I'll update if I have any additional comments.<br /><br />If you're looking for sunglasses on the cheap, I would recommend these for sure."
4.0,This is a cute little necklace for the purpose I bought it for. A costume.
4.0,I read the previous reviews and decided to buy a medium since they said the shirt is oversized and roomy. I love that it’s oversized. But I’m taking off a star because it’s REALLY long. It’s almost a tunic on me and that’s not what I wanted. To be fair I’m 5’2” but it’s still pretty darn long. Maybe on a much taller woman it would look right. Medium weight fabric. Decal looks great!
4.0,"I bought 2 sizes to try on based on previous reviews.  My toddler is 3 1/2 and in the 30% for weight and 50% for height.  She fit into the 2-4 size perfectly but with no room to spare, I can see it would not last 6 months.  The 4-6 size also fits, just slightly looser, particularly around the leg openings, but she will wear shorts over it anyway.  She isn't even 4 y/o yet so I'm not sure this will last her until she's 6 y/o.  I do like the sky blue, it is a bit of a brighter blue than the powder blue shown in the picture."
4.0,Oh I love this watch! Great bargain for price
4.0,Sun visor works well for recess duty which is when I wear it.  It fits comfortably.
4.0,"I wanted a dress for a wedding that didn't look cheap but also didnt cost a fortune and this was it! I've only tried it on for a few minutes and the length is perfect but the bust is a little big. I'm 5'4"", 36C, and recently had a baby so wanted something that covered my mom pooch. The waist line on this is perfect! Just wish I had more time to get it taken in around the chest since it puckers."
4.0,it was pretty tight.. we've been trying to stretch it out... its working slowly...
4.0,A little thicker than what I needed but the quality is great!
4.0,"Sometimes I have to readjust the gloves for my phone to respond, but they're warm and let me use my phone in the cold. I doubt this could be avoided but I'm still not at my top typing speed and have to fumble a little when I use them."
4.0,Excellent gift for someone into Dias de Los muertos
4.0,"colors are great, love it"
4.0,"Heads up on sizing: I weigh 120# and I bought size XXL and before and after washing, they fit loose and comfortably - so these pants run VERY SMALL, which if you know that and order the correct size, is fine. If you weight is a thinner built 125-140#, get XXL.<br />Material: very well made, great quality cotton, not flimsy. These will last years. I will definitely be buying more."
4.0,"I really love this dress! As soon as I took it out of the package I thought it was beautiful. The material was so soft and it felt great on. Im 5'5&#34; and get nervous about online dress sizes so I went a xl when typically I'm about a large, but can get away with mediums. This dress seems to run big because the xl was too big on me.  I'm exchanging for a large to fit nicely around my waist. I bought the light purple color and the brown. The light purple is a beautiful almost mauve purple. The brown is a bit more as pictured but ended up not looking great on me as far as color. It was for some reason longer than I anticipated, it comes to around my calf, which for me is a comfortable length. I'm considering a peticote to make the skirt look fuller. Its really a nice comfortable dress where I can feel a little sexy without feeling revealing. Great dress"
4.0,"Love this it's very comfortable and unique. Unfortunately, although it's adjustable, even at it's tightest, it's still a bit big. I just wish it was a bit smaller."
4.0,"Very cute, but way too big. I bought a 2/3 for my 2 year old. It's so big, it probably won't fit her until she's 4 maybe 5. I can't wait for her to fit into it, because it is super cute."
4.0,"I got these leggings because they were a crazy good price, and the reviews seemed pretty positive. I ordered a size medium, I’m 5’6”, 145lbs, with a 32” waist. I chose the white camo style, which has pockets, and I’m intending to wear them to work. Sticking my phone in my waistband creeps me out so the pockets were a must.<br /><br />I tried them on immediately, and they feel relatively soft, but not “buttery” like some, they just feel like regular athletic leggings you’d get at Walmart or Target.<br />The pattern is printed on, so it does lighten up a bit when the fabric stretches, but it’s not to the extent that it looks odd. They stay up well through squatting down and twisting and turning. They aren’t see through that I can tell, but I also got the white camo, and I’m not a very tan person, so who knows! Lastly, these leggings provide a decent level of compression. They smooth out my legs, and fit very well. The waistband reaches to the top of my belly button.<br /><br />I’d absolutely recommend these leggings, the pocket fits my iPhone XR with ease, and they look great."
4.0,"I have bought carter's brand clothes for my son since before he was born and most of them are the perfect size, but this shirt runs small!!"
4.0,not as pretty as the other ones I ordered
4.0,"It is a cotton dress that shrunk with first washing. Very comfortable, but slightly different after washing."
4.0,It can be a challenge to get this on. I have received many compliments and also had many people ask where I got mine from because they too are tired of their worn out luggage due to mishandling.
4.0,"Super cute! It was just a bit too small but I thought it was very cute. I needed a suit quickly so I returned it, otherwise I would have done an exchange for a larger size. If you are between sizes go up."
4.0,"I bought this for my nursing crew for christmas<br /> Awesome lights, only 1 out of the bunch didn't  work."
4.0,Kool tee..love the color of the shirt.
4.0,I wear these to yoga. My only complaints are that the tie in the front is fake and the seam around the elastic came undone after one wash.
4.0,"I do like the style, and it holds everything I need it to hold, just wish it had a longer shoulder strap."
4.0,the Jew break off
4.0,"The dye is only on one side. The other side has heavy bleed through, but definitely not designed for both sides to show.  Very pretty. And the silk, while not the best is ok for the price.<br />I got this to cover my hair while I sleep and it does the job."
4.0,"Love the length. OK With leggens. It's a unique T Shirt.  Only negative is, though the top fits, my arms are thick including my wrists, there is not much stretch allowance in that area."
4.0,Very soft and well done. It is for mild weather.
4.0,"I ordered slightly larger sock size then I normally get, and after just one wash they shrunk a bit but still not too small, just more snug.  Other then that nice socks."
4.0,"It fits, but with me being 6'1, I would have liked it a bit longer.  But it falls well, so it's a keeper."
4.0,"It's a very comfortable fabric, and it's very well made, but after a couple of washings it's definitely smaller than it was to the point where it's just a touch too small (in the shoulders, sleeves, and length)."
4.0,Not the best quality tie bar but it looks damn cool
4.0,Nice.  Good price and just what i was looking for.
4.0,Nice shoe but front strap way too big.
4.0,"Perfect for hot weather! I wear this like a jacket over a t-shirt, then I put my leather vest on top of it. Much cooler than my armored textile jacket. Not sure you could see patches onto this jacket so keep that in mind. Minimalist style protection with max comfort and peace of mind."
4.0,"Very cute, heavy weigh to them only one came broken but I can hot glue it back many compliments"
4.0,"More of a swimsuit material rather than cotton, which doesn’t bother me. I echo other reviewers in saying it does run small. My daughter 2.5yo, 31lb, 38” tall, usually a solid 3T. With her height it’s hard to find a leotard long enough that’s not too baggy. This is the closest I’ve come. I’m thankful I ordered the size 4-6 because it basically fits perfectly with a little room to grow!"
4.0,A but large for a lady.  But very soft.
4.0,These sleeves are a little tight if you don't have super thin arms. My arms are normal size and these sleeves are right.
4.0,the booties were decent for the price.  I think I could have worn a half size smaller.
4.0,It looks exactly as pictured; great headband option for more warmth and coverage while wearing my hair up.
4.0,It's a lot longer than I thought it would be. The fabric is also really heavy.
4.0,it is a nine leo but the top of it sits a bit low and kinda looks funny and it was a bit small. Other than that it was great!
4.0,This has become my go too shoes.<br />Surprisingly this fits really well compared to a pair I previously bought.<br />No issues.
4.0,Great looking shirt and feels nice and soft.  Seems a bit small compared to other items I have of the same size that fit great.  Trying to slim down so will hang on to the shirt as I'm sure I'll be in it before winter is over.
4.0,They are OK. The posts are not real long though. Definitely for youth or adults with small ear lobs. And the backs screw on.
4.0,"I really like this windbreaker jacket. It's water resistant (though a real rain will soak it), and it's light-weight. It's comfortable to run in, even though it doesn't have those vents (though I wish it did). It also looks good like the picture. So, if you need something to run in on a chilly night (I'd say anything below 60 degrees and above 48 degress farenheit), this is a good, affordable go-to."
4.0,"Material isn't anything super special or soft, and doesn't hang as well as something more expensive, but it's fine for the price. Buttons are a cute touch. It is plenty long to wear over leggings, even on my 5'10&#34; 2015' 24wk pregnant frame, however the arms are a bit short since I am tall. Also I really don't like how the irregular hem looks, but that's how I bought it so oh well. Worth the money for lounging around the house in comfy clothes, and I will be able to nurse in it over the top, which was very important to me. Shipped relatively quickly for a China buy too!"
4.0,"Warm, looks great! The zippers feel a little cheap compared to the vest quality."
4.0,I did order up one size so it fit well but is actually one size larger than I usually do. It is a pretty top.
4.0,"Item arrived as described, seems like it may have issues in the field due to design and material quality. Will have to test in multiple weather conditions. But overall happy as a range set."
4.0,Very pretty.Good value. It is a Christmas gift soI will update my review once it has been worn.
4.0,Love the color. The fabric and stretch is nice. The length is good. The only thing I would change is a wider waist band. The one used is only an inch or so and it twists.
4.0,"It looked just like it does online, decemt material. Its really short so its a good idea to wear spandex shorts under it.<br /><br />My boobs were a little too big for the top portion. I wish there were some sort of padding so built in bra, but i still plan on wearing it for my trip to Las Vegas!"
4.0,"I like the type of material. It seems durable. It is also very pretty, and can be worn with several outfits, and on a variety of occasions."
4.0,It fit but it rolls up from the belly up to the chest...think pantyhose rolling on ur belly? Yeah under ur boobs...not a good feeling. But still my daughters r skinny n love the bras...so withthe right body type they r great bras!
4.0,My daughter loves it so I'm happy
4.0,The color was pretty accurate and the quality is pretty good. I would definitely buy it in an assortment of colors!
4.0,I gave rating a 4 because the Xxl seemed to have really been a XXL but when it came to the medium the medium seemed like a small but dress was good overall
4.0,"Not fe, lightweight sweater, great looking, fits as expected, the front tail part of sweater a little longer than I expected but fits well."
4.0,"Beautiful color and feel, however a bit small. My daughter is very thin, with a small frame and it was a bit small."
4.0,Cute and comfortable - fits as expected
4.0,"Too big to my surprise, but my daughter will grow. Super cute though"
4.0,"The earrings are pretty and just as described, but the packaging for them smelled of cigarettes. Not good."
4.0,Colorful and comfortable.
4.0,"Runs a little big. Not as flattering as other yoga style pants, but comfortable."
4.0,"Great looking, no slippage, but 4 stars because they don’t reduce the sun-brightness to a comfortable level. This is my 3rd pair of goodr’s and I’ve loved the other two, but find myself still squinting while in the sun while wearing."
4.0,My son was asking for his hoodie for a few months so we finally decided it would be ok to pay for shipping and wait over a month for it.  Its a good hoodie and he got a compliment on it from a GIRL!! so....worth it.  im washing it inside out and not putting it in the dryer to extend the life of the ink/silkscreen.
4.0,"The earrings are very pretty and good quality.... only negative is they clamp very tight, I can only wear for a few hours at a time."
4.0,Super cute.  Get lits of compliments and the material is soft.
4.0,Not the best quality Jersey
4.0,Cute shirt wish it was a little bigger. It is a nice fitting shirt.
4.0,Nice gloves. A little small for adults. Fits kids and smaller hands great.
4.0,"the quality of this bathing suit is amazing, however there are pads in the chest area that look weird looking. luckily they can be removed. the pads are circular. personally i removed them. looked better without the circular pads."
4.0,"I like this shirt a lot. It has very long sleeves which I actually love because it makes me feel more comfy. I'm always afraid shirts from these places are asian sizes and the sleeves will bee too short. Not so with this shirt. It fits a little baggy, although I did size up one, and even though it does have a band at the bottom that is tighter, I didn't find it was too tight. I am 5'6'' and am a small and I got a medium. Maybe sizing up is a good idea. Very comfy again, and can be a cute night shirt as well as part of a sporty outfit. The quality is good for what it costs."
4.0,Wish that bigger space for card
4.0,"Purchased a 2xl, some reviews said get one size larger. 6'2&#34; at 200lbs, 34&#34;-35&#34; sleeve length, 47&#34; chest. An XL would have fit, sleeve length good, shirt body length good. Good for over other clothing or lots of room by itself.  Made in China, good construction, not heavy, but not real light. Washed once in hot water, cold rinse, no shrinkage or fuzz balls, line dry, don't know about dryer. Would buy another if needed."
4.0,To short for my liking but it looks like a nice robe
4.0,"Although very cute, the backs were a little bent. Maybe better packaging. Thanks!"
4.0,"Its a gorgeous cinch belt, but I did have some problems getting the ends to interlock properly."
4.0,This was purchased as a gift for my grandmother.  It's nice and soft and she loves it.
4.0,I am pleased with the earrings.  They fit well and look sparkly and nice.
4.0,"I really like these leggings. They compress at the waist and are very opaque. However, they do have a strong chemical smell, rinse them before washing."
4.0,"The bracelet is nice, however I ordered a sliver/white and received a black instead,  this the reason for 4 stars."
4.0,I like the design and the fabric of the dress. Just that I am very small in size so the off-shoulder is a little big for me. Otherwise it is a very pretty and well-tailored dress.
4.0,"I'm 5' 8&#34;, 155 lbs.  Was worried about the jacket due to everyone saying it's sized small, but medium fit me quite well. I dig it."
4.0,Tiny cheap lightweight watch good for sport
4.0,A bit small but they felt great during a treadmill workout.
4.0,I really like these sunglasses. They fit well and are great quality for the price
4.0,I am still impressed with these belts but my ownership is -still- brief. We will see over more time how they hold up.
4.0,"The leggings seemed nice, but they we very tight on my daughter. She normally wears a size 10-12. We ended up returning them."
4.0,The print is great but the tshirts material is kinda thin.
4.0,"These are lightweight, easy to breath through, and comfortable.  It seems to take adjusting every time to get the fit right. Cute but also look a little cheap."
4.0,"This is actually a really nice watch for the price. The band doesn't feel too cheap, it's sturdy. The clasp is excellent, I love that part because Im not afraid it's going to break or come lose after wearing it over time. The face is pretty big and it's nice to see the inner-workings. My only criticism is 3 things. 1 - the hands are reflective, not glow in the dark.. Would have been nice. 2 - since it's self winding, it keeps itself going, unless you don't wear it for a day and then you'll have to reset the time, or wind it in the morning or night after it's sat all day or all night. and 3 - There isn't a date display. Would've liked to have had that too. I bought a watch so that I wouldn't have to look at my phone to check the time, but now I have to look at my phone to check the date and I have the time on my wrist so that was a little disappointing. I should have paid closer attention to that. That one is on me, not the manufactuer. Brass tax: It's a great watch for the price, and I really do enjoy it."
4.0,"These are good jeans made of light weight denim.  They're good for wearing in the warmer months of the year.  The sewing is very good and they went through the regular laundry cycle just fine.  I didn't notice any fading or shrinking when I took them out of the dryer.  The pocket on the right front did seem to feel thicker  - like the inside pocket was bunched up but it wasn't.  I'm not really sure what was causing that.  Other than that, I think these are very good jeans."
4.0,"Product was on time. Elastic ,thin , not for warmth. Good camo pattern. Only thing is the strong material smell , definitely wash it before use."
4.0,Quality was as expected. Shipping was a little slow
4.0,Christmas gift for my Sister and she loves it.
4.0,The shoes are very comfortable for my son but the Velcro on the strap has started to rub off where it loops over.
4.0,These are cheap flimsy sunglasses that would be perfect to be used at an event like a party.  They are very inexpensive and you definitely get what you are paying for.
4.0,"This backpack is fantastic quality and just as cute as the picture! It is a little bigger than I expected. An older elementary child would have no problem with this set. I added a photo of the backpack with a 3 ring binder in it to show how much space is still left above it. The zippers glide so easily. I was worried my daughter would have trouble with sticking zippers, but i know that won't be a problem with this. I gave 4 stars because the &#34;lunch bag&#34; is not really made for lunches. It isn't insulated and is quite big. It would be a better dance equipment bag for a young child. That being said, I plan to add an ice pack and make it work, because it is ADORABLE."
4.0,This dress would be perfect if it was just a few inches longer!!
4.0,"From the pictures I thought these hats had a top and they don't so your scalp is exposed. I love them because I do really like headbands with sunblocking visors too. But I thought it would be more scalp protection from the sun. Great product, very lightweight, good quality and very stylish"
4.0,"I bought this bracelet for my self over a year ago and pleased to say I'm still wearing it! I don't wear it every day but probably wear it a couple times a week. It's been wet but still looks great. All of the rhinestones are still attached and the strings have not frayed at all.  I really don't like the strings hanging off of it, but I just twist them around band until they are tight and out of the way. I love anything with crosses on it and was so happy to find this. I would not hesitate at all to buy again."
4.0,Wasn't exactly white. Bought for the burial of a loved one and it fit her great. I was a little disappointed that it really wasn't white.
4.0,"I liked them alright. They were just a tiny bit too big for my liking. I'm petite (5'1&#34; 113 lbs) so they also fit long on my legs, as well. The material is great. They're completely opaque and not so thin that panty lines would show a lot. I'd have kept them if they weren't a little long and big on me. Would recommend to someone taller, though!"
4.0,This blouse fits well and is a pretty design.
4.0,"Love these, covers as intended. Great material and comfortable"
4.0,Very Good to help prevent spread of covid-19 new if worn with pm 2.5 filter. Keep clean and wear as instructed
4.0,Love this top for the price! Order a size or two up tho. I'm 5'6 140lbs DD and I normally wear a medium or large. I got a large and it fits but I would like it better if it was a little longer. Should've got the xl. You have to lace it up yourself. Still really happy with it.
4.0,Enjoy the style & fit.
4.0,"I wear a 7.5 and the mediums were a bit small for me... so I ordered the large (although they are tad bit large - they fit nice with a thick sock... they make great slippers... but can be worn out side due to sturdy soles... I would not take a long walk in them, but good for short trips...<br />Best for lounging around the house..."
4.0,This is a okay pj set not the best the material is not the softest and not the worst but it is okay not really what I expected.
4.0,"Looks a little more matte IRL, but for the price you can't beat it."
4.0,It was lightweight and exactly what I was looking for but unfortunately it was too small for me. I prefer my scarves to be looser around my neck and these for just too snug for my liking. If you don’t mind them snug then you would like these though.
4.0,it was small for me but i gave it away
4.0,The chain is cheesy and was no where near a lenth of a 6'4' man!  Goes good with my Harley gear!
4.0,addresses the need for easy costume!
4.0,"I got the xxl usually wear a large, but I wanted it to fit loosely"
4.0,Bought this for my 1 year old that wears 18-24 months and the dress was massive. I am going to keep it though because it’s so cute.
4.0,"it was a little big, my boyfriend typically wears a large but it was long on him but he rolled the sleeves up a bit and it looked great. looks just like the picture. and the buttons are snap! so that was cool. all around liked the product and it arrived on valentines day like planned :-)"
4.0,"It's not bad. I'd watched a bunch of YouTube videos, in order to do pirate make-up justice. They'd recommended trimming this type of product and using a type of adhesive to stick it on. I bought the adhesive, but the day of the costume party getting ready took so long that I didn't have time to fool with my date's makeup too. So he wore this as is. The mustache came off right away, because he wanted to have a drink and it was in the way. Sooner or later a pirate is going to have some rum-infused pirate punch. The little tiny piece fell off during starters, but he wore the the bottom braids for some serious dancing before it came loose. So it does stick rather well.  It also looks nicer than expected on. I'd recommend it."
4.0,Fits wallet perfectly.
4.0,"I've been looking for a tennis bracelet with stones bigger than 2-3mm, and also available in my wrist size 6.  This bracelet was perfect for that.  The stones are nice also. However I'm giving it four out of five stars because I had to fix the clasp a little so it would close properly."
4.0,Good little hat
4.0,"First, the color is nice but it is more clear blush than a solid color.  I love that it brings a little screwdriver keychain to tighten. These are large and I have a large head so that is saying a lot.  They top my eyebrows and go all the way down to the bottom of my nose.  But for the price more + than -"
4.0,"I’m a DD and got an XL, and it’s pretty tight, but not supportive. It had padding that came with it that was super thick and even after I took it out my boobs are still kinda spilling out of the sides. It’s  still super cute and I’ll wear it! but definitely not good for any running, jumping anything like that lol bc like I said, not supportive."
4.0,"I ordered 2 box, one of them was dirty, but everything worked perfectly."
4.0,"This item shipped quickly and came in the most darling, pink bags. The earrings are what you'd expect to get at Target or Wal-Mart. They shipped quickly and are cute but not ""forever"" jewelry. What I would expect for the price and an added bonus of pretty packaging. I will use the pretty pink bags for other things."
4.0,Have used once so very nice so far.
4.0,This dress is super cute and classy. I read reviews before hand because I am very busty and another reviewer said that she could not wear a bra with the dress. She has the same chest size I did and it worked just fine. If you’re of the 34DDD variety you know not wearing a bra doesn’t happen lol. But holy smokes I wore this baby without a bra and the girls were where they were supposed to be high and tight!
4.0,Arrived on time. Quality great. length perfect.<br />Colour bright n bold.<br /><br />I definitely would recommend this dress. Perfect fit. Very pleased with my purchase.
4.0,"These are very nice quality, comfortable and quite pretty, but be aware that they are very petite.  Fine for a woman looking for something very delicate & not flashy or ostentatious.  Also small enough for a teen or pre-teen."
4.0,"Love the look, only reason for 4 stars is that it isn’t as good of quality as the outside is become worn like it may spilt at the side seams."
4.0,"A pretty dress but was too long, the bustling is too wide and the A line too."
4.0,It's a nice shrug. Khaki Green color is good. Runs a bit small.
4.0,"This bracelet fits my small wrist. The sizing snaps are not uncomfortable or bothersome. It appears to be genuine leather, per sniff test. Eye-catching as i get compliments each time i wear it, strangers stop me at the grocery store every time, no joke. 4 stars + not 5 as the  design piece sits a bit skewed on my wrist. I am hoping the leather will conform over time to my wrist so i am not always turning/centering it."
4.0,"It's a little bulky, but works great for my band replacement/"
4.0,Love it and so many compliments
4.0,"these pants are very well made and styled well ~ but the sizing was way off ~ going by sellers sizing go down a size or two ~ we ordered by careful recommended measurements and item was 6 inches too big, BUT they are very very nice pants...  it is difficult to return this item due to shipping so good to get sizing right ~ the seller was helpful to us and in the end we are happy...  do get the size right .. the pants are well made and complicatedly  seamed so you will not be able to tailor yourself ~ professional help was required ~ but now my daughter loves them ~ many compliments ~ wore them for a semi formal event"
4.0,"I previously posted a negative review for this ear cuff but have since been offered a replacement. I am now happy to say that I am very satisfied with not only this product, but also this company. Would buy again."
4.0,Very cute top! But I got a size medium and it fits like an extra large..
4.0,Look good when it hard to buy item anywhere else
4.0,"Penny's commend on aug, 2016 are spot on and now offer my input on sizing. Dress looks on me the same as it did her....including length and color/color comments. I ordered L. I am 160#, 5'9&#34;, 38 DDDD, size 6 or 8 bottoms. Size was perfect for me and is stretchy. Even though winter now, TX winter that is, can still see it with ankle boots and motorcycle jacket. Arrive quickly and was well packaged."
4.0,These shoes are SUPER cute and there were so many prints to choose from. I think the width is just a tiny bit wide - but with socks they fit ok. I anxious to see how they wear over time and if they hold up - I will definitely be ordering other prints!
4.0,She loves it.great shirt.she likes it all that matters and price was great
4.0,Shipping is LONG like longer than most things over seas but the hat itself is cute and perfect for my  purpose.
4.0,"I like this sweater, Its not the softest but It’s definitely warm and it looks cute with anything. It arrived fast and fits good I got a xl for that oversized look..."
4.0,"Super cute, thick bottoms<br /><br />The sole is flat though so not the most comfy, very soft though and I’ve had them for over a year and the “fur” is still nice"
4.0,"Before ordering I read some reviews and the main rub was shipping... my hat came in a adequate box and wasn't smashed at all.  Perhaps I got lucky or maybe the shipping folks have gotten better??? Quality is good for the price.  I ordered the L/XL size and it leaves a little extra room for my head but not bad, when wearing a fitted baseball hat I am a tight 7 3/8 or loose 7 1/2.  The brim has a somewhat poorly hidden seam in the front/off center which wisdom would say to put the seam in the back but, again, it's a $16 hat."
4.0,"These pants were a little more snug than I would have liked, but overall I do like them. They have a nice stretch to them, and they look good on. I will be wearing these all summer. These are great to wear under a dress, or on their own."
4.0,Very nice package. LOTS of different items. Okay quality too. Good to make anklets!
4.0,"Ordered for husband and son. They do run small, but looked nice in our photos."
4.0,"Overall, these are nice jeans. They are a slim fit, but do to the bit of give in the fabric, they don't feel constraining or difficult to put on. The build quality is good, and the material is soft and comfortable even with just a few washes.  The size (34 waist, 34 length) is true.<br /><br />The cons are that the rise is a bit short so they ride rather low (at least for my preference). The zipper, while of good quality, is very short as well which can be a bit cumbersome.  The cons drop my rating to 4 stars, but these remain a decent pair of skinny jeans that are not constraining while maintaining a slim profile and fit."
4.0,"We actually needed them to be a larger, and it worked out, I ordered a small and my sister ordered a large and both were longer on the legs than what the picture shows, but since we needed them that way it turned out ok."
4.0,"Crisp, pretty, wear with anything.  It's been a go to in my closet all summer with shorts and jeans."
4.0,The bracelet broke pretty easily but it was an easy fix to tie back on.
4.0,"I love the shirt. It's well made and the material isn't too thin like most women's clothes. My only complaint is how big it is. It wouldn't be so bad if the sleeves weren't so long! I'm 5'7 and the sleeves go at least 4 inches passed my wrist. I bought a large which is my normal size in women's. I know the fit is supposed to be a bit baggy, but I could probably get away with wearing it as a dress. It fits in the body like a 2xl, but the shoulders and sleeve width fit like a large. I'm keeping it because the boyfriend says i look comfy. So if you want it to fit as shown...get a size smaller than normal."
4.0,Really snug and comfortable
4.0,decent price for this jegging. they run a little small and this is a jegging with a screen print. There is no actual deconstruction of the product.
4.0,"I like the style, color, and they block the sun well. The bifocals are more noticeably than I like so not going to wear them as a fashion statement."
4.0,The mask was a crowd pleaser. Only downfall is the thickness where the battery is. Felt like it weighed my face down so I don’t wear it as often. May just wear it for holidays.
4.0,"This fit my wife as expected,  it is see thru, not expected..."
4.0,"Love this comfy dress.  One issue is that white strips have a few tiny black spots.  Not enough to hinder sending it back from my perspective, but something others may see worse on same purchase.  Overall, great and comfy."
4.0,The band was much better than I expected! The picture doesn't do it justice!
4.0,Like the true red color.  Easy to put on<br />Hasn't lost its color.  I hope this does bring me good luck!
4.0,These socks are very comfortable. They offer support to my ankle and foot arch. I have arthritis of my foot and ankle. The socks have been very helpful.
4.0,"I o my fave it 4 stars because the pants size really small and I’ve had to return them 3 times before getting it right. I’m usually a Small/medium and I’ve had to go with extra large. Once I got the right size I was happy with the way they fit. It is a very fine fabric, kind of a light track suit fabric. It looks great on"
4.0,"I'm glad I carefully read reviews which stated these leotards run small.  I ordered the size 6-8 for my daughter who just turned four.  It fits her perfectly.  (I ordered the 8-10 for my just-turned-six year old.  It, too, fits just right.)  The quality seems excellent."
4.0,the watch looks elegant and for the price it's a great value.  band not as polished as Skagen's but it's good.
4.0,It was too small and the color was different than what I bought.
4.0,Very cute but I have to send it back! I ordered a large based on reviews and I need a medium! I normally wear a medium! Hopefully I don’t get the medium and it’s too small! 😬
4.0,The fit is good on these glasses if you have a smaller head/face.  But the finish is shiny Black and the lenses are black as well no color in the lenses.  The style of the frames is more feminine. But they are good driving glasses for the money.
4.0,"Good, but I feel like it was just kind of rough around the edges. A little bit of wear and tear and it smooths out though.<br /><br />I've seen better quality but for the price it looks fantastic."
4.0,Super cute fit! However I am 5’10 and it was practically a shirt on me. Way to short!! I got the green. It’s not too thick! Cute if you are short !
4.0,"I LOVE this dress! I did have to return as it was too large. Unfortunatly it was a lightning deal, so the re-order cost me an extra $5 and they didn't have the smaller size in the red bottom, so I got the black bottom. Still cute as heck. Would buy again and would recommend to a friend."
4.0,"It is a little big for me (i am 5'3).., but it is a good quality apron, i use it for paiting, (Acrylic paint can damage your cloth) and it is great."
4.0,Hard to get on a key.
4.0,"I am completely impressed with the quality, weight, and the fact that they are truly NICKLE FREE! I have purchased SO MANY earrings that claim to not irritate ears and are nickle free and that isn't the case. These earrings are decent quality costume jewelry and there are many options in the pack. I think the only con about them is that some of the earrings are a smaller and slightly varied version of another pair. Not a deal breaker because of the price. It has kicked up my wardrobe and I have received many positive compliments when I wear them. I highly recommend this purchase for sensitive ears or not. You will not be disappointed!"
4.0,I bought this dress to use for a costume to dress as Magenta from Rocky Horror and it was perfect. It was very comfortable and the material is quite soft. I am on the petite side so it ran a little long on me but I planned on altering it any way so it was fine.
4.0,"Great product! The only tricky thing to it was taking the tape off.  Sounds easy, but it doesn't just peel right off."
4.0,nice small loops
4.0,"Socks were nice, but they were a bit stretchy and would move under my feet when trying to do balancing poses in yoga."
4.0,"Really nice bracelet, understated but really cool. The instructions included a list of medical benefits of the bracelet provides which are utterly absurd and unscientific, but I don't really care.  I really liked that it came with a pin removal tool to resize it, but unfortunately the tool broke right as I was finishing putting the pins back in so I can't resize it again if needed."
4.0,I adore the green color I got but the dress is so long. I’m 5’2” and the dress with TWO petticoats underneth still hits me mid calf and it just looks odd. The neckline is very flattering but loose on my shoulders and chest. I have a gap between the back of my neck and the top of the zipper. I’m scared to go down a size since I measured and this was supposed to be the size I would wear. I’m going to see if a tailor can make it shorter and maybe take in the bust line a bit. For a $30 dress I think I got what I paid for. Would probably be 5 stars if it wasn’t so long
4.0,Nice and comfortable. The size is right for me.  I wear size M or 8.  I order size M and it was perfect fit.
4.0,"This top fit as expected. I receive many compliments on it. It is a soft, comfy material."
4.0,This item is great for the silicon eyelets and plugs.<br />You shouldn't wear tapers as jewelry FYI and shouldn't stretch with them because they can leave  scarring. If you're get this for stretching I'd go with stainless steel over this. But for the jewelry aspect it came in handy. I lost my earing backing so I put these in. The plugs them selves have a dent for the o-rings so you don't lose them as easily. I like that. Plus the silicon eyelets feel great. Over all good product. But I wouldn't stretch using these. Thank you.
4.0,"The outfit was cute and decently made. As far as sizing, I ordered the M/L and it was very tight and short. I’m 5’9 150lbs."
4.0,"I like this product.  I purchased a large.  I am 5' 5&#34;, 147 lbs.  Fits just right.  Tight, but comfortable, the way it's supposed to be.  Nice and stretchy.  However, there is a bit of bulge below my lower belly.  I can live with that though.  It would be good to have better coverage for the lower belly.  That is the only reason for the 1 less star.  I like that it comes in a zipper bag.  If you fold the shapewear well enough, you can get it back in there again just fine so that it is good for traveling.  I think this product is great and a good buy.  I think it is advantageous to have this product if you think you don't look your best in a certain outfit and want to look more streamlined.  A bonus with this body shaper is that it makes you want to eat smaller portions and that is what we should be doing anyway because it is good for you and your metabolism.  :-)"
4.0,Cute and Cool.
4.0,The gloves are comfortable and quite warm for the price.  If I'd paid the list price though I'd want my hands to be warmer.
4.0,kind of too big and it is very warm
4.0,"I loved the pics and pattern and the dress, but it was much too large in the front stomach area & not as fitted as I had hoped.  I am more narrow so it fit my body like a maternity swing dress.  I wound up returning it.  Cute dress though!"
4.0,"Got this windbreaker/light jacket for my son as fall set in. The jacket is lightweight without looking cheapy; the fabric has a nice feel to it. It is well made. I like that the hood can be stored away. It looks smart on a young man. Unfortunately, we didn't quite have a fall this year. Was warm throughout October and then, almost overnight, snow! So, didn't quite get to wear it too much before the thicker jacket had to come out! Still, really glad we got this, and I would recommend it! Keeping it for the spring!"
4.0,"I had ordered an extra large and it was defective but I didn't send it back, I figured I'd have the hem altered to be the same length all the way around but I never did and it was a little tight in the bust. I ordered the extra extra large and while the hem is made correctly it is way to big on me. This is my 3rd dress like this the first one I fluffed in the dryer to get the wrinkles out and it shrunk so bad I couldn't wear it. Then the next one the hem was too long on one side, it didn't match the other side at all and the bust was a little too tight. So I ordered the xxlarge and it is way to big. I tried to shrink it but this time it didn't work, so I will have it altered so that I can wear it."
4.0,I like the blouse it's just too small
4.0,"I sized up one size, because I wanted a little extra room since I have a larger bust, and wanted it to be long enough to wear as a tunic with leggings. I would say it definitely fits the way it does on the model in the photos! I love that you can cinch the waist to fit how you want it to, and because the fabric is so thin and lightweight/drapey, it does not add unflattering bulk/bunching.<br /><br />Overall, I love the feel of the material. It's lightweight and should work year-round for someone like me who tends to be too warm most of the time.<br /><br />Bonus: The buttons each have a tiny rhinestone in them. You can see it if you look closely at the photos, but it was not something I noticed 'til it came in person. The chest pockets are faux pockets - just a decorative flap - which I was happy with since it's not a pocket I would use anyway - and again, doesn't add extra bulk to the chest.<br /><br />I did notice a lot of loose strings, so hoping the quality will hold up over time. I plan on washing in cold water on delicate cycle in a garment bag, and hanging to dry. It did say ""color bleeds"" - so I would be careful what you wash it with."
4.0,"I would give this product 5 stars, but I get way too hot in it. I LOVE the material it is super soft and it feels like I’m in a cloud—until my body starts warming up the cloud and it feels like I’m in a soft, wooly oven. Would recommend 100% for any snowy winter night, but would only wear the pants for cold nights—definitely not advisable to wear in the summer!"
4.0,Toddler loves them!
4.0,Perfectly geeky socks featuring the best bounty hunter in the galaxy
4.0,they're super cute and totally worth the money! my only complaint is that a bit of the color chipped off but you can barely tell :)
4.0,I liked the fact that you can wear it as Lounge wear or outside
4.0,the Leggings I recerived is not I have ordered. the color is wrong. But it doesnt matter. the quality is fine and comfy.
4.0,I would give it 5 stars but the bust is quite small. I have d cup and the zipper barely goes up on xl size dress. Pockets are huge. Will be losing more weight to try to fit into this dress.
4.0,"Super cute, great quality, but it's huge!!"
4.0,"nice, fit its purpose"
4.0,"I wouldn't call it a gown, it's a bit short for that. But it is a lovely and girly night shirt. I love the cut and how flattering it is. It's also soft and super comfortable. I'm considering ordering another in a different color but I think I will size down once this time. It holds up well after several washings. I'm very pleased."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:7d1091abe51ac174d46c2b93fecd7eb]] This product was a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it. She wears them all the time. It makes her feel chic. I would recommend 10/10
4.0,"Great costume.<br />My son wears a medium in men’s we ordered XL and it fit great! Good quality material, value."
4.0,"These are nice! I deff wear them but they aren’t the first set I grab for which is why I gave it four stars. They kind of feel like a soft nurse scrubs texture. It’s not scratchy but it’s not super soft like I was expecting for pajamas. I like that’s its one color and no crazy prints, however I am not a fan of v-necks and didn’t realize when that when I bought them. But like I said, I still wear them!"
4.0,Good value.  Just as shown.
4.0,I like the glasses.  I just cannot seem to find a pair that really blocks out the glare.
4.0,Not the highest quality and had a few hanging threads to cut but it does look nice on and fit perfectly.
4.0,"The necklace was everything I expected, it was a bit small, but still fit! And it can be used for Packer fans!"
4.0,"Big Digimon fan and the graphic on the shirt is pretty nice, the material is comfortable but but it feels like it runs just a tad small. Course it could just be I gained a bit. Overall it's a nice shirt and if your a fan I'd say go for it."
4.0,Good gloves. Use them for my 30 minute commute. Ride in 36 degrees with them. My commute is on a highway with speeds averaging 80 MPH. My fingers started to get cold at the end of my ride. Would of been 5 stars if my fingers weren’t cold.  Overall good gloves though.
4.0,"Comfortable, but the collar is kind of thick/heavy and makes me hot at night. I wish the collar was smaller. I am in between a small/medium in most things and I went with small. 5'5&#34; 130lb. It fits perfect (not too tight)."
4.0,"Fits very comfortably, no problems as at this point in time. If and when problems do arise, it will be addressed at such time. This is the first time that I have bought this product so I can't make a just comparison at this present time. Thank you."
4.0,product met my expectations & seems to be holding up well-would buy the same product agai if I need another one
4.0,product is as expected
4.0,Inspiration for graduate to keep their keys on.
4.0,It's very useful and easy to use the only thing I dont like is the knife. It's small and can be easily lost al ssf o difficult to get it out. It's a nice fit and the light is bright.
4.0,"This bracelet is adorable and I received a lot of compliments, however one of the straps broke off after just a few wears. I guess expected for the price."
4.0,Newborn size was big on my 6 lbs 10 oz newborn. She was able to fit in this onesie around one month.
4.0,"She seemed to love it  It looked cute, not quite worth $20 I bought a cape to go with it and that worked out real cute."
4.0,It's super cute but smaller than expected. Returned and ordered bigger one. Now love it.
4.0,Alittle tight and I ordered my size
4.0,"Slightly small on my head, seems to perhaps be made for smaller heads or females. Still it fits well enough to wear and I like it, and of course, Beretta."
4.0,love it! just keep an eye out for boob slippage
4.0,"First off this hat is SERIOUS sun protection. Brim is listed at about 4.7&#34; but is closer to 5 .5&#34; which protects not just your head but a good deal of your upper body.  With the adjustable sizin it fits me and I have a rather small head.<br /><br />Snaps are provided to allow the sides of the brim to be filed up like most boogie hats, but the brim is very  large so it looks a bit odd (to me) if you try this.<br /><br />My complaint is that I ordered light gray but got a beige hat -- which wasn't even listed as an option at the time I ordered.  And in the heading  for my review it says I ordered the green one!"
4.0,If I was to order again I would order a size larger. Decided to go and get shoes from a Runners store where I could get my feet measured to get the right size.
4.0,"The chain is very pretty, Looks exactly like the picture. I wore it for a lil while.<br /><br />Con the chain gets tangled up fast and now I can't get it untangled I only wore it once.<br /><br />And now it's unwearable.<br /><br />So it is a lovely chain, but. Beware of the tangles. I say buy it it you know how to untangle it when it knot's up."
4.0,"Very absorbent.  A tad wide, but otherwise very comfortable."
4.0,"I don't know why, but the necklace I received was not as pictured.  The two smaller stones and the earrings are the color pictured.  However, the large stone is a much darker blue.  I am keeping it, though, because it is still very pretty."
4.0,Cute shirt. Good fit.
4.0,great product for the price.  quality was of a medium grade
4.0,About as expected. Thin material but comfy
4.0,"I love it ,but after wearing it it turned color's ."
4.0,These are not the color pictured but brighter. Soft and comfy.
4.0,"this is a great shirt, wish there more of them on the market"
4.0,Great gloves but run small I normally bye large gloves I ordered a XL and there still tight.
4.0,super cute but coming from a small girl it doesnt fit super tight like I expected
4.0,"Absolutely beautiful manually wound watch. Has a window on the back so you can see the inner workings and gears. Bought this as a birthday present for my husband, and he loves it. It's very weighty in the hand, definitely not cheap.<br />According to the page, shipping can take up to 6 weeks as it ships from China, but I got it in only 2.<br />The only complaint, according to my husband, is that it loses a minute or so every day."
4.0,Kind of sad that it was made in China!
4.0,"The dress is stretchy but abit short than expected. The quality is not that great, feels like it would loss it's shape after 1 or 2 wash. Overall it is ok and i will wear this just at home."
4.0,I feel these should of been a little tighter around  the waist.  The band seemed a little stretched  not sure if  I'm sending  them back  I  might try another x small  5'2  105 lbs
4.0,"They appear to be good compression socks, my wife likes them. There is NO way these fit men sizes that they indicate, I have purchased others that do fit."
4.0,Work great but sizing is off a bit!
4.0,Just looking for something fun for a stocking stuffer for my mom.  This fit the bill.
4.0,"Comfortable, but make sure to wash on gentle."
4.0,"I got it in burgundy, really an eye catcher. I thought this was more turquoise, but it is more of a green. Like the design. Inexpensively made, good costume."
4.0,I wear a 44d bra. This fits like a 42c bra. The support of the bra held you up fine but the size is not accurate. It's very pretty but It's made small.
4.0,"Love!!!!! Purchased capri light gray and capri dark gray. Fits perfect and very flattering. Waist band fits very nicely and not loose as some of the other comments have stated.<br />Light gray is NOT squat proof, but will work well for an upper body day. Dark gray is squat proof! Good quality, thick material. Will definitely be purchasing other colors<br /><br />**Update: So bc I’m obsessed with these I ordered 2 more pants- long dark blue and black Capri. Black Capri fit lovely again as my previous purchases had and is squat proof. But I’m dropping a start bc the long blue did not fit well and were very unflattering.<br />I’m 5’3, 126lb. The waist band was loose and went higher up then the Capri waist band. Didn’t hug me the same way the capris hugged me. Decided to return the long dark blue pants BUT I am ordering two more of the capris :)"
4.0,Product is to small need to size up when purchasing
4.0,Fell off quite k..
4.0,"on the smaller side, but it's built well and looks pretty"
4.0,The description was true to the product.  To improve the product the limbs could be longer and go 360 around the tree. Also it would be nice if taller.
4.0,It is a good everyday dress for summer.  I wear with a cropped jacket.
4.0,"I had been shopping for a colorless stud, smaller than 1c, (to stay within budget)and found very few options. These are a fabulous buy. The screwback setting will help secure them for everyday wear. Some 4 prong settings with round diamonds provide the illusion of squareness. This setting does a nice job of mimicing the round shape of the round diamond. I gave them a 4 stars because their brilliance is less than some other cuts. If you are going for ""flashy"" dinner party brilliance these may not be your best pick, if you can spend more. These were shipped timely via US Postal and came with a signed appraisal,...again, GREAT value."
4.0,"Nug.... If you wear a large, get a xl but other than that, very warm"
4.0,"Fit was good, print is good, but order early if it's a gift!"
4.0,"I ordered these shirts to wear as undershirts for work. I usually war Under Armor but it's a bit expensive so I decided to poke around for something cheaper. I always set my expectations low when ordering budget stuff but this was a great deal. The fabric feels thick and soft, pretty close to Under Armor actually. That's a huge deal to me because I've had compression shirts where the fabric is kinda scratchy or really thin and flimsy (stretching out quickly). This has a very nice feel on my skin and its thick enough to last a while. I didn't run into any problems with it being loose anywhere and or riding up over my belly.<br /><br />I'm 5'6, 150, with a 38C chest and a 32 inch waist. The Large fits perfectly; covering just below my hips. I would definitely buy these again. I ordered the 3 pack of black ones and it was a little more than 30 bucks which is a steal when you consider the price of higher end brands.<br /><br />I'll update over time to report on durability.<br /><br />8/20/19 - Update: I have 3 of these shirts and I wear them one day every week before washing them. They continue to impress me. I don't tumble dry them (although I have once) but I do throw them in with everything else and they continue to hold their shape and elasticity. After 3 months of regular use I figured they would be starting to go by now but they're still holding up very well. I'll probably be ordering more very soon."
4.0,"I enjoyed this “Chinese Traditional Style” button up shirt.  Fabric is very lightweight, cotton/linen.  I would say that the fit is true to size, maybe running slightly on the larger side.  I ordered an XL and it fit me, but was a little too loose so I put it in the dryer.  In fairness, the label did say tumble dry low, which is what I did, but it shrank drastically.  I should have known better, it’s linen, but just a heads up.<br />Besides the fact that it shrank in the dryer, I still do like this shirt very much.  The texture of the material is what you’d expect from linen; not soft like a cotton shirt, but still quite comfortable. Because it is so lightweight, even though it is long sleeves this is something that I would wear both in the summer and winter.  I also think in general it looks quite nice and could be worn in variety of settings and occasions.  I did actually receive at least one compliment on it when wearing it.  It may go without saying, but it definitely requires ironing and is prone to wrinkles.<br />In general, nice shirt - lightweight material, runs true to size, and stylish (or at least I think so).  Just definitely do not put in the dryer… hang dry only!"
4.0,These socks are really cute but they have to be hand washed which is somewhat of an inconvenience.
4.0,They are earings
4.0,"Very pretty, though the leaf charm was a lot smaller than I had expected, but I still love it. Nice quality; this may be the first adjustable bracelet I've gotten where the adjuster actually worked :)<br />Arrived almost a week early, which was a plus."
4.0,The thickness of these gloves was greater than usual for this type of  stretch knit material.  The inside had a soft and suede like feeling.  I was expecting a thinner glove and was pleasantly surprised.  I can actually wear them outside in very cold weather instead of warmer autumn weather.  So I will get some use out of them later this year.  I'm pleased with this purchase and the price was reasonable.  The only criticism I have is that on the outside of one fingertip there was a little clump of yarn sticking out that should have been inside the glove.  I got out my sewing tools and was able to maneuver it to the inside and now it looks perfect.  It was worth the effort and the wait which was over two weeks.  I recommend this item to others.
4.0,Bought this as a gift for my husband. He is olive skinned with gray/black hair and it looks very nice on him. It will look even better when he gets tanned.
4.0,Cute & fun dresses! Flattering on different body types.
4.0,Beautiful but to long
4.0,"Fit him really nicely, the fabric is soft and comfortable. Seems that it will have wrinkles later on but no, it's actually really good."
4.0,Very cute but runs small. I tried size 12-18 months and 18-24 months and both were too small for a 24 lb 10 mo girl.
4.0,"These are really nice for the price, though just a tad larger for an XS than I’m used to.<br /><br />Overall, they are really nice and flattering."
4.0,"This is a great light weight dress that's comfortable. It's not cotton, so it's not the softest, but it doesn't wrinkle and it lays well. I like long sundresses and this is to the floor. Perfect for me. I'm 5'5."
4.0,Much longer & bigger than I expected
4.0,The color is very pretty! I ordered an XL because I was worried it would be too small. I am 5’7” and 163 lbs. This shirt looks like a 2 X. It’s huge! I probably need a medium. Hopefully this helps others. The color is beautiful and the quality is great. Just runs really big.
4.0,"This is a very cute outfit I got for my new grandson, and it has snaps which my daughter prefers to have on the baby, and snps are not easy, these days to find. It is very well made and as a Carter's product, it has a wonderful quality feel to it. The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating is because it was not fleece, as advertised. My daughter does like it, and we are going to keep it, as he is a growing boy, and definitely with be using it!"
4.0,"Meh. Cute, but it sheds."
4.0,"Good fit except the waist is a little tight for Medium. OK, maybe it's not the pants."
4.0,"Super cute & well made...for me it's a bit big (tiny melon  syndrome), but i make it work since its so cute."
4.0,Super cute dress but WAY too long for my petite 5'3&#34; frame. I can usually get away with wearing a pair of three or four inch wedges to even out the length challenges I have with most maxi dress but even with my tallest pair of wedges this dress was too long. I'd recommend this dress to women at least 5'6&#34;+ unless you are willing to get it tailored.
4.0,Nice product - not too sheer but not very stretchy either.  They run VERY small.  Be sure to order the next size up..
4.0,Adorable and great price but this brand runs extremely small. Order 1-2 sizes up. I recommend 2 if your bigger in the busy
4.0,These are very comfortable. I did order a size up based on other reviews and glad that I did. I wear between a 10-12 and purchased the XL.
4.0,Like the product.  Use to hold pants down on the motorcycle.
4.0,Good Belt  Good price  nothing really special about the belt but happy with it.  I especially like the belt hole maker that was included.  Have already used it on another belt.
4.0,"Luv the colors & style. Runs a lil' small & a bit long if you want to wear flat sandals, but ok w/heels."
4.0,"Pants fit fine, the arms part on the top very tight.  Did not order too small for my physique."
4.0,The only reason why this gets 4stars instead of 5 is because it did not come with the belt as advertised but other than that I loved the pants. Not super high quality material but great for the price. I am 6ft tall and the length was perfect and I’m hippy as well 44” and it was flattering for my shape. So far it has held up well with a few washes.
4.0,I haven't had my baby yet but it looks kinda large for a new born. But its really cute
4.0,"Very nice material with wide straps.  Fits perfect, I am a 38D"
4.0,They slip around some but the THO protection is on point (pun intended)
4.0,Fits well. The fabric is softer than the highly stretchable jockey brand I'm used too.
4.0,thank u my son liked it...
4.0,Great concert and stadium bag! Holds more than it appears. Helps you get through security quick!
4.0,"I like this hat a lot, unfortunately it is a little big so it will slide to the side if I do a lot in the hat. However, for the price and the mental benefit, it is still worth it. If I was a better seamstress I would sew it to shorten the length of the straps under the chin."
4.0,"Haven’t had a chance to use it yet, but it’s so cute!!!"
4.0,Fits greet & looks really cute!
4.0,"My wife really likes this sweatshirt.  It has a good length, and is true to size.  The fabric is nice and thin, but has a thicker sleeve at the end that she likes.  Perfect for lounging around the house (and for Zoom calls)."
4.0,The bracelet it cute but is hard to put on by yourself other than that is a nice piece
4.0,"Decent quality. Doesn't pinch often.  Locking mechanism has held up, and hasn't popped open on me.  The two halves don't quite line up when they lock into place, but not a big deal for such an affordable band. Perfect fit for Pebble Time. Have found some pins starting to slide out on their own, but only a little, and can be pressed back in by hand."
4.0,"I ordered this for around seven dollars, in a size 38D. It arrived earlier than I expected, which was great. I tried it on and it's really cool, just made on the small side. I even ordered a number up just to make sure and my breast fit in it fine it's just the top kinda creates this wear fat thing. I didn't buy it to wear for very long though so considering the price and speedy delivery and all the spikes were intact and the straps adjustable, I really like  it and would recommend it, just be wary that it's kinda on the small side."
4.0,its nice and all . Its just very light . I dont know. like it wont last but looks great.
4.0,Item was great for the price. It runs a little small.
4.0,"I needed a way to measure the feet of my 7 kids. Knowing that anything I purchase would end up destroyed at some point (7 kids could destroy a titanium block) I took a shot at this one. Low price and works well, I'm very happy. And when the kids &#34;accidentally&#34; melt it with an arc welder they build from the coffee maker and some cereal bars it will be cheap enough to replace."
4.0,"I absolutely love leg warmers and take any opportunity to expand my collection. These are a medium-weight yarn knitted into a cable knit pattern. The color is slightly different than the advertised picture. The picture on Amazon shows them to be almost a navy or royal blue, the pair I received is closer to purple but still quite dark. They they fit well by themselves or over skinny jeans with boots. I have worn them both like a leg warmer and also like a boot topper both looked absolutely wonderful. They're heavy enough to keep my legs warm but not so heavy that they look excessive or make my legs too warm. My only feedback would be to have the color of the item being more closely match to the color being advertised simply because some people are buying items for a specific outfit."
4.0,"the icons on it never peal off, or scratch, as far as having this for a few years. However the sewing technique used makes it so it overlaps oddly but its unoticable."
4.0,Really Great Quality
4.0,"Nice gloves, nice color and material. Would of kept if they fit. Gloves were to tight and fingers were to long. Keeping and will give as a gift."
4.0,Gorgeous!  Well made and has become my &#34;go-to&#34; necklace.
4.0,"Socks fit well and definitely provided comfort. They were quick drying but I advise not putting in dryer. They do shrink some and now they're snug, but still good quality socks."
4.0,Fits really well around wrist or ankle. My daughter loved it
4.0,Was an okay buy. Easily adjustable. Lightweight. Colour fades quickly though
4.0,"Heart symbol, Not glowing in the dark, but she still likes it."
4.0,This was not what I was expecting however the colors are bright and the fit is as expected  it’s not thick and chunky as I thought it is very thin and would work well with a long sleeve tee under it it is very pretty tho and customer service is wonderful I appreciate them reaching out to make sure I was happy with their product
4.0,"Great watch for the price. The light isn’t great and I really wish it was completely water proof, but can’t argue with the value for money. Great buy!"
4.0,This is a hat that can be crushed without worry that it won't spring back into shape. Cute design and good shade provider. Highly recommend.
4.0,"Fabric was a bit odd/not what expected, but I still like the shirt and it looks super cute! A little bit thin as well"
4.0,"I'm 5 3 112 pounds. I ordered size (M)  It's very cute and looks just like it looks in the picture. I did have one problem. After adjusting the waist and shoulder straps, well, good luck if you want to get in and out of it quickly."
4.0,The pattern is so cute! But as many of the other review reported it was a little tight even though I bought my &#34;usual&#34; size.
4.0,"I wish it was a little bigger but, I loved the butterfly design."
4.0,Fits really nice. A little too long but comfy summer dress.
4.0,It is ok and is working
4.0,My calves are huge but was able to slide over after few tries n great compliments
4.0,It's a cute chain...im surprised it fit me so well because I'm skinny.  I tried it on after I ate and it was a bit snugged but I think it will fit also if I have no food in my belly...it's cute! Probably will have to clean it really good after getting out of the water obviously so it doesn't rust.
4.0,I love this set very well made. And looks awesome.<br />I would buy again.
4.0,I'm 5'8&#34; 220 and usually at least an XL. I got a size 12 and it's definitely too big. I like it and I'll still wear it but it's gapey in the chest area.
4.0,Quality seems OK.  Fit is good and this was a good value compared to other tri-blend shirts.  Shirt does feel a bit thin though...
4.0,Soccer team used these for Breast Cancer awareness - looked good and fit the cleats as described.
4.0,"I love this purse! The only thing I would change is that it doesn't open fully. Other than that, super cute purse!"
4.0,My granddaughter will love this for Christmas
4.0,I like everything about this purse but it had a horrible fishy smell at first- which is the 4 stars.  I put a bounce dryer sheet inside and let it sit for 5 days.  I can faintly still smell it but I think that will go away with usage.  Only time will tell.<br /><br />The purse itself is well made. The hand straps and shoulder strap are definitely thick enough to hold the weight.  It is nicely lined with pockets.  The size is comparable to my other hobo style bags. I can fit my iPad case in it easily with room for everything but the kitchen sink that I seem to carry.
4.0,"Rey thin material which is ok because I live in a warm climate, but pulls apart a little across the chest."
4.0,After reading other reviews I ordered up a size. Top is a bit snug. The bottom is perfect. Fabric is soft. I hope they wash well.
4.0,This is a gift and I hope they like it.  Good quality.
4.0,"It's a good sweater, but somewhat small,"
4.0,Ok just a O K
4.0,"Love the bag, not quite big enough for a weekender."
4.0,"This corset feels like a really good quality for waist training, and much less expensive than a lot of the big brands. It doesn't feel cheap at all and looks really good too. Sizing is on point as well. I love it, but would suggest anyone do research on waist training before attempting cuz it can be dangerous. Otherwise if it's just for fashion and you're not actually planning on sizing Down with it, go up a size, cuz the back can look a little messy and won't close all the way since it's designed to shrink you down to the point where the backs eventually meet."
4.0,Great item! Apart from the rubber backs - highly recommend.
4.0,"Order a size larger than you actually are. I ordered a 2x and am normally a XL. I found them a little short though. If you have a longer trunk, these will be a little short on you. You cannot, “Praise Jesus” in them without your ands showing."
4.0,"Nice light fabric. Runs small. I wear a 6/8, ordered a medium and it is form fitting, a little too much so for sleepwear."
4.0,I bought it for the price and the fabric as I didn't want a bulky and plush robe.  . I like it.
4.0,Hospital night shift approved!
4.0,everything its ok.
4.0,This tank didn't run as small as some of the other reviews suggested. I normally wear a medium so I ordered the large and it's a bit too big.
4.0,Beautiful garment but size run two sizes smaller than stated.
4.0,"The insulation in these bibs is nice and cozy for warmth, though at times too warm and so the side zipper/button combo comes in handy for venting. The concern one should carry while wearing them in the rain is the zipper areas, water can easily enter the bottom of the front most zipper area and the side pockets zipper area, especially when/if sitting down. Also keep in mind the high vis will get dirty quickly depending on usage & not all stains are removable."
4.0,"color, construction and design much to my liking!"
4.0,I am very picky about the way that bags are made and Kale products are well made bags with sophisticated design.<br /><br />This is a leather bag and that makes it a little heavy for me for an everyday bag.
4.0,I love these pants. Great material and quality but whether or not I’m going to get the right size delivered is another question haha.<br />Ordered 2 smalls in 2 different colors but one was larger than the other so I had to return that one
4.0,"These are so cute and I love them, but I had to drop a star because it's too easy for my baby/toddler to pull them off. Or if we're taking her out of the carseat and her foot hits something the shoe gets pulled off too easily."
4.0,"Cute little belt, came in quickly and so far seems well made."
4.0,"Really nice shoes, the sizing  is a little small which I was expecting so I ordered a 1.5 for my son who normally wears a 1 and they fit just fine for now, won't fit much longer though I should have ordered a 2. The shoes being a little big is better than a little small. I do love the shoes though very cute and the zipper makes them easy to get on and off."
4.0,"Perfecto para usar diariamente, tela suave y elástica, solo que la camisa no queda como en la foto, es un poco larga, pero la ajuste a mi gusto recogiendo bajo el brasier"
4.0,"Really cute swimming suit, but it runs a big"
4.0,Not really for people with big heads or thick necks. I was barely able to get it on and even then it was very constrictive. Had to get velcro extensions at a store. Still its solidly built and looks and feels good. If you have an average to smaller size head/neck this could work for you.
4.0,Slighlty maternity looking but comfortable and fits alright
4.0,"The two that I ordered came early. Only thing wrong with them is the length, they are really long. But I don't really care considering their price."
4.0,"I was shocked to see that it had arrived 2 weeks earlier, it was nicely wrapped! I think my only problem is that you cant distinguish the front from the back, and the top rim of the dress is lop sided (but I noticed that it was worn backwards) so the back is crooked. but it is cute and cant wait to wear it for my Luka cosplay!"
4.0,what can i say? they do the job
4.0,On the small size. Good for the price
4.0,Runs a little large. For the most part the design is accurate except that there's no orange stripe down the middle. Very soft.
4.0,El diseño está bonito pero en la foto se ve que queda largo y algo corto pero lo demás está bonito
4.0,"2 were broken, so I just glued them to something else. No real complaints for the money"
4.0,Great Nightmare before Christmas sweater. It does run a little big so I had to reorder a smaller size. Now it fits perfectly
4.0,I returned this item because I found another dress I liked better. It's not super high quality but it's fun and cute. I used the size chart and ordered an XXL. I wear a sz 12. It was way too large.
4.0,"I like these gloves but they are for cool weather at best.  I'm either a L or XL in gloves.  I should have bought the XL, but the L are okay, they are very tight, but do stretch a little.  Also they do not come up the wrist very far, which is okay for cool days, but nothing approaching cold.  They are good for what they are, but don't expect too much."
4.0,"Old school hockey game, not built like the one I had but close."
4.0,"I didn't give this 5 stars only because the sizes definitely are off, but if you know to order up, you really cant beat this suit. The zipper isn't the best. A 2T fits my 17 month old perfect (she's about 22lbs). Seriously, for the price though what do you expect? I will probably buy more because kids clothes they go through so fast anyway.  It's a good deal."
4.0,Love this watch but that extra band doesn't stay put. There are two little clasp things to help keep the extra band flush against the wrist but they slide around. So I'm constantly having to fix it. Kind of a pain by the watch itself (and for the price) is beautiful. Love wearing it and gets lots of compliments
4.0,"My daughter loves dogs, so she was thrilled with the dress.  She is 6 years old, 50 inches tall, and an average, athletic build.  The 8/9 is a tad big on her, but not so big that she can't wear it.  The material is slinky and stretchy.  I haven't washed it yet, but I don't think it will shrink."
4.0,"(Wife's review) This is a finely detailed, beautiful sparkling bangle. It is not &#34;antiqued&#34; but if you want that look you can do it yourself. I would love to wear it- BUT the first time I did, it snagged a thread in my (stretch denim) jeans. It was not a defect- the design of the dragon's scales has a sharp tip, all along the spine, and this is what pulled the thread as my arm swung and brushed against my leg. I also found it too small and had to bend it to put my medium sized hand into it. I think the metal wouldn't take much bending back and forth before it would weaken. I wish it were larger so it would fit on my upper arm, but I would be happy to wear it at all. It now sits like a crown on my unicorn's head. :-)<br /><br />It is very inexpensive, so the risk is small and I am not sorry I bought it. The silver is worth something, and it is beautiful art. Think of it like that and you'll be happy. If you want a bracelet, good luck with that- YMMV."
4.0,Would have given 5 stars but they're a little bit smaller than I pictured. Still great product though.
4.0,Stylish sunglasses.  Look good.  Light on my face.
4.0,Bra is pretty but sizing is slightly small. I wear a DD and feel like they might pop out. :)
4.0,Product looks fine and works great.  Just isn't really leather as described but still a good product.
4.0,"I was expecting the size to be a little big. Although, the picture quality and the resolution is great. The corner side came a little crooked but still its okay. I like it very much. Perfect for BTS fan like me :)"
4.0,Great alternative and very comfortable.
4.0,"it should specify which size to choose when you order it, i didn’t know there was a large or medium until i read the back of the box. It’s kinda tight so i hope it doesn’t rip or anything. Packaging could be better. The hood came kinda messed up but hopefully the more i wear it, it’ll expand."
4.0,Product purchase served its purpose - part of a halloween costume.
4.0,Neckchain pennant
4.0,Loved the costume. I received so many compliments throughout the night. The skirt is very well made. The tank top on the other hand is not the same quality. The ruffles ripped within an hour of having it on. I made it work though. Threw on some pearls and you couldn’t tell.
4.0,"It’s cute, I wasn’t expecting it to be polyester but it still looks cute on my daughter"
4.0,Short on length
4.0,Pretty good. The color is a bit off for my skin tone so you can still easily see them. But just as described
4.0,"&#34;Leather&#34; seems a little cheap to me, but I gave this and the matching purse as a gift to my sister. She absolutely loved it. It is very pretty."
4.0,Cute but does not cover my ears
4.0,"I like these pants, they were just way too small. I always get x-large in different brands, and they fit loose so I was surprised these were so tight. I'm 6ft tall so I like bigger/longer pants."
4.0,"Found out about this brand through Tik Tok. I’m usually strictly a Nike or Lulu gal, but we’re in quarantine and I’m bored so i went for these Seasum leggings.<br /><br />I ordered a size up (M) from my normal size (S) based off the reviews. However I do think i could fit into a small. With that being said, I also do think the M works fine, are flattering and squat proof. These pants are SUPER high waisted. I had to fold mine down about an inch. For reference I am 5’6”, 135lbs, 26in waist and a little wider in the hip/thigh area. I wear a size 6 in lulu’s & size S in nike.<br /><br />I got compliments on these pants and i will most likely order them again in another color!"
4.0,Durable and fun!
4.0,Use for mountain biking and love the fact that you can change the lenses depending on weather or scenery.<br />Lenses are easy to change if going from sunny to shaded locations and the hard case makes it easy to throw in the truck/car to take along.
4.0,v cool
4.0,These are such freakin cool shoes. Really love them. Only drawback for me is they seem to rub the sides of each foot. No way I’d be able to walk long distances in these but it won’t stop me from wearing them. The cool factor is too hard to resist
4.0,Bought these due to night driving issues with glare from lights and new headlights cause star like blinding light. They work very well on most lights and give a clearer vision of the road lines etc. the halogen lights are still blinding but better then without the glasses.
4.0,Great compliment to a Vampiress costume.
4.0,"Love the floral print and the handkerchief hem. So many colors in the skirt, it would go with anything. Slightly thinner than I wanted but I think it’ll be ok without a slip. Will check in sunlight if ever the sun comes back out‼️😎😜"
4.0,Comfort ? Omg extremely!!! But they come bigger I didn’t want to return them so that I took them up on my sewing machine
4.0,Gave as a gift to my hair stylist ... cute & she liked it.
4.0,my son loved them.  They fit as expected
4.0,Stretches out after a while and gets a little harder to keep it up over the nose
4.0,Like it. Its fits a little tight but I wear it often. Great fit but for every day I would order it one # up
4.0,Me quedó un poco flojo
4.0,Very nice shine and clarity
4.0,Cool gear. Will buy more
4.0,"I expected these to be too large, as they were listed as a woman's size, for my 11 year old daughter. I was pleasantly surprised, they fit her perfect.  Which worked out great for us!  If you are a normal sized woman these may be too small.  They fit preteens."
4.0,"They do help for night driving, but they are not perfect as others I have tried are even less effective. I like these the best except for the hinge as it doesn’t let the glasses come down all the way to fit up to my glasses. They just don’t come down all the way as they should. Other than that they are fine and the price seems reasonable."
4.0,Only issue is the chest cover was too big on one side and sewed over too far on the other side. Very flowy.
4.0,"The shirt is very cute, and im happy i ordered it. I purchased a small, and it fits just right. Im about 5'2&quot; and around 113-115lbs. Shirt looks as it does in picture, but no belt. Would give it 5 stars, however, the shirt is a tad itchy."
4.0,"The night light /projector was smaller in size than expected, but it is a good gift idea. I like that it can run on batteries or be plugged in with a USB cord."
4.0,I needed XL - came more like a medium/large. Gave to my 15 year old daughter.
4.0,"It's hard to find sparkly barrettes that aren't over the top.  This one is fun and beautiful, but doesn't look like it belongs in a jewelry case.  Just right.  The metal part is matte finish, not shiny.  I also like that it's not symmetrical.  More arty looking."
4.0,"Broke from the chain and is heavier than expecting, but is holding up well otherwise."
4.0,Nice fit but unravels at the seams.  I would order these again but maybe not wear them so much.
4.0,"This umbrella is small like I wanted, but it is cute and sturdier thank I was expecting. The case is a plus and it is lined. However, I took 1 star away because it is hard to open and close."
4.0,"Great,cuts down the glare"
4.0,Love the colors of these light weight sweaters.  I have the royal blue and light tan color. Would definitely recommend purchasing.
4.0,"Really cute dress. Was hoping it was 100% button down but it only buttons down a little less than halfway, and the rest of the buttons are just sewn on for decoration. Other than that it's a super cute dress and I'm pleased with the purchase."
4.0,"Very nice earrings, match to everything, but a little smaller than I expected."
4.0,It is exactly as described! Very comfy!
4.0,Love this apron
4.0,"Cute, but they turn a bit on the foot. I would buy again."
4.0,"It was too small for my head, but would fit others"
4.0,I love this new color! Very pretty but it is only about 75% squat proof
4.0,Great shoe for such a great price.
4.0,It was pretty. Little short on body.
4.0,"good material.... cute dress.... sizes are somewhat as expected. i order a large just to be save, it was a little roomy however was able to adjust it.<br />good buy!"
4.0,"I am changing my review from 3 to 4 stars after adjusting the way I was wearing these bra's. I had the straps pulled too tight, and the underwire was digging in under my arms. After loosening the straps and lowering the bra a bit, it was much more comfortable. There is still a tiny bit of discomfort after several hours of wear, but I suspect that's just the nature of underwire bra's. If there's some way to completely eliminate this, I would be happy to give these 5 stars. I'm not going to give up wearing them. They're just too nice!"
4.0,too slippery when I walked on tile but super sexy and fit well
4.0,Good bag..good quality.
4.0,My daughter ❤them great product fit perfectly
4.0,I  bought this jacket for my husband. He loved it except for the zipper broke the first time he wore it (wouldn't zip up). I was able to return the jacket and get a refund. I have ordered a second one; hoping there are no issues with it.
4.0,these are all so cute! i haven’t lost a charm from one yet and i’ve had them for a while. my only issue is that it turns copper after a while of wearing them but it’s not that noticeable.
4.0,"I absolutely can't wear a sandal that goes between my toes, and it is incredibly hard to find anything flat and cute for summer that I can wear. After looking high and low at various department and shoe stores I had pretty much given up so I was very happy to find these. I always wear a 9, and these fit true to size. They are very flat though, as you can see from the picture. I was worried they would not be comfortable for all day since I usually prefer an arch support, but actually they are quite comfortable. Also note that the strap across the toes is not stretchy, so if your foot is wide at the front it might be a problem.  My only complaint/wish is that the front strap would be better just a little bit farther back since it goes right across the bottom of my toes and totally covers up my little toe."
4.0,"The watch is outstanding. The bracelet, though, is either too long or two tight. The older, longer clasp, with more holes, is needed."
4.0,"quality good, just like picture, delivered promptly.."
4.0,"Very good looking glasses, I must admit they are probably not for me since my head is to oval. I recommend it to any other head shape that isn't oval, because they do stick out oddly, but this is not the glasses fault since they do look great and are pretty dark, perfect to cover yourself from the sun."
4.0,Pleasantly surprised. I really like it.
4.0,The cover up is soft & air flows through it.
4.0,Gift for someone but it looks good
4.0,"My wife asked me to order this dress for her. She liked the soft fabric and thought the dress was comfortable and a good fit for summer. She liked the pockets, but didn't like the length of the sleeves (too long). She decided the cut of the dress, especially the sleeves, wasn't ideal for her, but our daughter looks good in it. The dress itself is well made, but perhaps the styling isn't right for everyone."
4.0,A good buy my wife loved them
4.0,I read the reviews and ordered a size larger which was the right thing for this costume.  The vest seems to be small but maybe  I am just too busty.
4.0,"This was for a friend and she loves it, wears it all the time"
4.0,This is a really cute necklace. I like that you can change the pieces inside. I would purchase this necklace again.
4.0,"This is a pretty good dupe, it doesn’t look 100% authentic but it might look better once the leather has aged and got some color to it. Wax on sides of the leather is my main issue it’s a bit more red than it should be. Looks good still and length of strap is really nice!"
4.0,I bought the xl. I am 5'4&#34; and between 180-190 lbs. These fit great! They are a little see through so you definitely have to wear a long shirt/tunic with them!
4.0,"The quality & fit were good, the fabric part did not look good. Love ❤️Jack Wolfskin products. Sent this one back only due to fabric not flattering to my old 60 face."
4.0,These were pretty good. Had to clear the hole in some but it was not a big deal.
4.0,The mask is nice and it not hard to breath in
4.0,My mom really liked this shirt. It fit her so pretty!
4.0,"The costume looks great! The material however is well…it’s a Halloween costume lol it’s not super comfy but comfier than most plastic costumes. When I got it, the white parts were dirty like it had been dropped or something. I’m 5”5, 155 lbs with DDD cups & a butt. I got a medium & It was snug as a rug! And a little cheeky which I like. I decided to not exchange for a large ultimately because of the way the material is. A large may be too baggy. All in all, I’m satisfied with the product! I’m just nitpicking"
4.0,The dress is nice!  not cheap thin material.  I am 5'6 about 124 'lbs sporty body type and the medium fits pretty lose (probably could have done a small)
4.0,I would say the color of the rose is are more a magenta pink shade. Alligator clamp don’t work for thicker hair. The mesh is not long but was enough
4.0,"I was skeptical when I bought this seeing that it was shipping from China. I needed a replacement rubber strap for one of my Tag Heuer watches.  I cant see spending on $300.00 + for a strap and deployment clasp from Tag.  I got this one and I have to say it really nice, and it fits perfectly. The deployment clasp is advertised as stainless steel, but I beg to differ. Its more like a coated metal / plastic.  For $30.00 it solved my problem. The only issue is that its a very thin band. I was hoping for a little more thickness, I am not sure show it will hold up over time. All in all, I would definitely buy again."
4.0,"I purchased this watch as a opposite to another watch. I own a Tag Heur formula 1 in black (very similar model) and wanted a white version, which was no longer available. I decided to try this brand, as they are nearly identical and I really enjoy this style of Watch . OVERALL it's ok. No, the stones do not have the brilliance of the other brand, however this watch was literally 6 % the cost of the other brand. As a stand-alone product, for the price it is fine. I certainly would not recommend comparing it to a higher end product. Would I purchase the watch again? Yes absolutely. I am going to order it in white and rose gold I believe."
4.0,Cheap material but then again it’s a cheap dress. Fabric is too stiff even after washing. Cute model and style with drawstring in the middle to adjust the arm sleeves. Not bad for the price other than the stiff material.
4.0,Worked great for after reconstruction surgery. Has a good fit
4.0,"Love these glasses!!! They are fashionable, comfortable, wide framed and dark enough to keep out the brightest sun!"
4.0,Very cute. Fit nice. Would only recommend wearing these ones if you’re not going to be too active or chatty. They’re a little hard to breathe in because they’re thick. But they’re pretty!
4.0,"This item is a lighter blue than what the image shows. Overall, it is a sturdy, well made belt. There is decent weight to the buckle which doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. The strap is VERY long and must be cut to desired length. It tends to sit lower in the front as well, unless that corrects itself after cutting. Be very careful when cutting the belt to fit!! I cut too much of the strap and then it didn't fit. I had to get creative to make it work, but it's not the same.  Never the less, it is a decent belt for the money and unique from anything you'll find at the department stores."
4.0,We ordered an XL but received a XXL. Decided to keep anyway. The sweatshirt is very nice--good quality and well made. My son loves it.
4.0,"After reading others reviews, I ordered a large for my 13 year old daughter. She normally wears a small in junior and adult sizes and the large fit perfect."
4.0,Light and comfortable. A bit on the narrow side (I'm normally average width.)
4.0,"Love this cute dress that is light and a very flattering cut on the body. The only negative I have is the top V portion is larger than I need (36C) and creates some gapping. For the price, I love it."
4.0,Great Watch Winder only 4 stars because it looks great works fine .But  won't hold my 52 MM automatics. They sit against  each other. This is why only four stars.
4.0,"I ordered an xx-large because all reviews said it ran small. I over did it ordering to big, but that's my fault. I will have it altered. Besides that, it looks just like the picture."
4.0,Size was the 4-6 and it was huge on my above average sized 4.5 yo. A little pricey for the quality of it.
4.0,I used these charms on my bangle bracelets. Customers love them. I have been using them for a while and customers do not have a problem with them changing.
4.0,"These charms are well made and a great value. I love that the size is exactly as listed and that they have the letter on both sides. There are no sharp edges and the pieces are all consistent. What I DON'T like is the random distribution of letters. I bought these with a specific project in mind and I needed 2 ""K""s but there was only one. A few only included one of a letter and then 6 or 7 of others. The letter ""W"" was completely missing. I was initially going to give a lower rating but the listing is for a random mix. I just wish the seller was a bit better about the distribution of the letter mix."
4.0,"The overwhelming majority of the combinations in this edition have been culled from past issues of Chess Informant -- i.e., from grandmaster praxis of the last four decades. The combinations are not easy and I think a player should be at least Class A (i.e. USCF 1800+) to be able to use the book -- though I think the target readership is probably at least expert (USCF 2000+). For pedagogical purposes the first edition which came out in 1980 was far superior. This edition is designed as training material for the advanced player.<br /><br />The classification pattern has reverted to one similar to the first edition (i.e., themes of deflection, pinning, double attack, clearance, interference, decoy, blockade, demolition of pawn structure, annihilation of defence) with the important caveat that at the GM level these don't have much meaning as the combinations typically rely on a number of themes and the classification can be arbitrary.<br /><br />The quality of the binding is good as is the quality of the paper. 3,001 combinations and their solutions take up 659 pages.<br /><br />To reiterate, if you're a strong player looking for some training material to hone your already formidable tactical skill, this book might be appropriate. Weaker players would probably be advised to stay away."
4.0,"Very pretty set but short chain. I had to give it away because it was too short for my neck. Beautiful though, hate that I couldn't keep it."
4.0,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this item, but I am happy with my purchase. I am 5'2"" 153lbs and I ordered a large, but could have probably comfortably ordered a medium instead. It is very high on my waist. The skirt is made well and is lined, the material is soft, breathable, and stretchy. It moves with you so it is good for everyday casual comfortable, but also has a nicer look to it and can be worn for work or a special event. Overall very happy and will likely purchase more in different colors and prints. It's not the most flattering in the tummy area if you are like me and have had children and struggle with mommy tummy."
4.0,"This boxers are great, the quality is nice!"
4.0,It's  very comfortable and cute. I like the material It's so soft. I gave it 4 stars because the top a bit too short but I already knew it from the picture but I like the pants style so much so I ordered it anyway.
4.0,The square glass did not fit
4.0,The quality made the item look and feel nice. Perfect for a gift
4.0,"Pretty ties, patterns look too similar."
4.0,it does what it has to do yet it is lacking. i hate it that it does not have any instructions yet it works well when i figured out how to use it.
4.0,"Nice, but not quite what I was looking for."
4.0,"Great size, I use it every time I got to the beach.  Knocked off a star because one of the metal rings for the handle pass through came loose right away.  Doesn't affect the function."
4.0,"The only reason a I am not giving them 5 stars is because the wings went in the same direction, not how is shown in the picture. it's very easy to fix them thou, I just used a plier and voila! I absolutely adore the earrings! Nice and sturdy..!!! :D very happy with my purchase."
4.0,Great fit and cute !
4.0,"Feel fantastic. A little long in the leg. I'm slightly taller than average, so I could see the length being an issue for some. Also, no pockets, which is the only thing preventing me from giving it a five star review."
4.0,Love this vest. fits well
4.0,I like it a lot but I cant read the face in the dark...
4.0,"Just what I expected. Fits well, material quality is acceptable and it keeps me warm."
4.0,"This is a great watch, it gives you everything you need, and nothing else. I mean, why would you need a watch that tells you the time, and has 36 alarms, and tells you where the moon is in the sky?<br /><br />The watch is very light-weight, and very unnoticeable. You could slap it on, and forget it was even on. The lightness comes at a small cost due to the durability of the strap, its mostly fine, but the points where it attaches to the watch, seem a little thin, or ""could be thicker"".<br /><br />The watch keeps a good time, losing maybe 20 seconds every 4 months or so? Which is fine, since its pretty simple to re-adjust the time.<br /><br />The watch is really cheap, sorta like a disposable watch, you won't worry if you lose it since its so easy to replace, and it'll last you a fourth of a life time if you treat it right.<br /><br />Though its a reliable watch, its very few bells and whistles like the light, is poorer quality, but gets the job done. Its a simple, LED or such on the left of the watch, but it gets straight to the point, it lets you see what time it is at night, or in the dark. Unless you fancy the entire thing lighting up like a flashlight then you'll be fine.<br /><br />It says its water resistance, but I wouldn't trust it.<br /><br />Overall, buy it. Unless you are expecting a solid gold 24k watch with diamond studded numbers, and it tells you when all the planets align."
4.0,"So far so good.  A bit tight fitting it onto the frame and I managed  to pop a couple of  stitches in doing that; probably my fault but it does mean that there is no real slack. Otherwise, it seems to be well made and the price was right.  It seems to be a good deal."
4.0,"I actually love this bracelet, but when receiving it I almost did not know if it was the real thing.  The band would bleed black if it got wet and a couple of stones looked pretty rough.  If it were not for this, I would have rated with five stars.  I suppose anything as old as these stones, may show a little rough.  The energy from wearing this though is extremely high, making me forget about those little things."
4.0,Gift. Was liked and appreciated
4.0,It is very pretty but I was expecting a solid piece for the all silver one. It is hollow and it doesn't look as appealing. The pearl one is very pretty too. Nice set that comes in a drawstring bag with a cleaning cloth to shine them up.
4.0,"This fit me fine around the waist, but a smidgen tight around the knees.  But, it's cute and I am sure I will find times to wear it."
4.0,Warm and great for ice fishing
4.0,"VERY FLOWING...BUT VERY LIGHTWEIGHT.<br />MORE FOR SUMMER EVENINGS OR A SUMMER WEDDING....THIN, SILKY,  AND QUALITY SEWING.<br />BRIGHT COLORS ARE ATTRACTIVE.<br />ORDERED IT XLARGER TO CREATE A WIDER LEG LOOK..."
4.0,"The material feels cheap and not stretchy. I bought the size medium for extra length and glad I did. I'm 4'11 and 112lbs, I normally wear size small. I cannot bend over in this dress because my butt will show through the holes which is why I gave a 4 star rating. It is as pictured and I love the color. I bought the bright pink which is not see through (I'm wearing black spandex underneath.)"
4.0,"My friends and I decided to get these to match for Halloween and these were the cheapest. For the price it's really good, tho the button up shirt was a bit tight around my chest. The skirt was also a bit short but I believe that's more part of the costume. I would say size up just in case as I am usually a medium but I had to get a large, the large fit fairly well it was only the button up i struggled with."
4.0,Pretty mask. More for a women. Mask was small fitting and hard. Not very comfortable.
4.0,"Very nice quality. Pockets.  These are not ""stretchy"".  I always wear a medium, which usually runs a little large on me, since I am 5'2.  I needed to get a large, to have them fit a little bit looser and be comfortable for lounging and sleeping.<br /><br />Overall a lot of bang for the buck."
4.0,It fits and it's comfortable.
4.0,Very cute hat.  This was a Christmas gift and she loved it.  It was thick and soft.  Makes a great gift and is warm for the colder weather.
4.0,"Fits very small. I am usually a 38C from Victoria's Secret and the 38C size for this bra is a lot smaller than that. But this is a well made bra, the quality is great! The seller responded quickly to my return/refund request and was able to resolve my issue promptly."
4.0,"The tank tops run a little wide but after washing and drying them they fit perfectly now. I normally wear a small in women's and ordered a small, after washing and drying it shrunk to fit perfectly. My fiancé wears a mens large and same thing easy fix. We can't wait to wear them on our Disney honeymoon!"
4.0,Soft material and I like that it has a soft lining.  Fit as expected.  Color as expected.
4.0,so happy thank you
4.0,I bought some sports bras that came without pads. These are perfect. The little gel line at the bottom makes it feel supportive without giving me too much push up. it's not something I notice like you do with traditional push up bras
4.0,"My favorite daily shapewear. It’s got some decent control and doesn’t show any seams under your clothes. I often wear it with the top part visible under low cut tops or open cardigans. My one complaint is the crotch. I’m not sure what happens exactly, but frequently throughout the day it will pinch me down there, which is very unpleasant and requires some immediate adjusting, which can’t always be done discreetly. The snaps do make it easy to quickly go to the bathroom, though."
4.0,"If this shirt wasn’t a little bit too large for me, I would have given it 5 Stars. I normally wear a men’s medium but this fits me more like a large. It looks great and it washes and dries well. For once, I was hoping something would shrink in the dryer on high heat but this didn’t :( But when buying clothing, that’s a good thing. Since it wasn’t as form fitting as I wished, I wore it with a thermal shirt underneath and a vest over the top. It worked fine for that. When I wore it just by itself, the material is really soft and feels good against the skin. The seams and hems are sewn nicely and there weren’t loose threads popping out anywhere before or after washing."
4.0,"Runs small, but nice hoodie."
4.0,"Super cute costume.  If you have a large bust, it may not close properly but still a great costume."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:5ae85f5fc28c17844820425ffe83471f]] *Revision* The Regetta Jewelers 50mm Hoops are very glitzy and great to dress up your outfit! These are actually my second pair and a revision of my first review. The first pair were damaged and with excellent customer care I was sent new ones. The hoops are durable and the CZs are clear and bright, but the clasps are a bit loose and can come completely off with a tug. One of the hoops is a bit warped and will not lay flat. When I close the clasp, the bar is actually angled to lock in to the prongs. Overall, it's a good value for the earrings. Thank you for watching! These earrings were purchased at a discount in return for this honest review."
4.0,"wouldn't call it something I'd wear in winter , but it's great for a fun fall night.<br />light weight warm ish. great for cool weather"
4.0,"The sleeve part around the wrists stretch too large and doesn’t reconstrict. By the end of a workday, the sleeves are really floppy."
4.0,"Just got these in the mail today and am very pleased. Amazon suggested size XL but I went with XXL and it fit super comfy. I tried them on as soon as they arrived and they seemed sheer, but after a wash and partial dry the fabric seems to have fluffed and it less sheer."
4.0,Correct
4.0,Love these pajamas so soft and comfy my favorite set ever
4.0,"Abit smaller than I expected, but a great earring."
4.0,My 6 year old son picked these and he loves them. However they wear down quickly. They look a year old but are only a few months old. But I guess that’s what we get with the bargain price.
4.0,"Its a real jersey like material soft feel, but it seems like the material that turns to cotton ball. Its really cute...tho"
4.0,It is a little tight but I have a big head.
4.0,Good value for a leather bag.
4.0,"I got these for a 3 year old, so the ""stickers"" are a little big, but she likes them & that's what matters! Good item!"
4.0,"These earrings are tiny, but beautiful and delicate.  I wanted earrings to wear with jeans when I wasn't dressing up.  These are perfect.  My hair is short, so they can be seen.  If you have long hair, you may want something larger.  But this company packages its products well, ships them in a timely manner, and describes them perfectly.  Also, the prices are a plus."
4.0,Definitely run small but very cute
4.0,It is very detailed. It is unusual to find this item as not many manufacture items on this subject.  I intend to ad a chain and replace the string.
4.0,Had to buy extra weight for the base; the umbrella would tip over without them.
4.0,"Bought this one size larger than my measurements indicated, since all the brand reviews said their products fit small, thinking I could always take it in a bit if it ended up being true to size. Turns out I probably should have ordered either my actual size or one smaller. I even had my seamstress redo my measurements to double check. But overall the dress is gorgeous a decently made for the price."
4.0,I love this sweater. It's a great length and size. It's really baggy but that's what makes it so great with leggings/ tights. The splashes of color make it easy to mix and match colors and patterns. The only complaint I have is the seams were really weak. Had to sew a few spots. Wash in cold water on delecate cycle. Air dry. I stretch the length back out in mine before hanging.
4.0,I did 4⭐️ as itnis a nice quality top. I was excited to get this but wow it is a tight large :(  my daughter who is a size 4 and 32C it was snug in her as well. I will gift it for Christmas to my sister.  Just size up if you don’t want it snug showing back fat
4.0,"I Like the pendant, it's what I had in mind but still wish it was a little bigger. The engraving on the back is a nice touch."
4.0,"These are comfortable pants/leggings. I love them. They were a little long, but that's ok."
4.0,"Try to order a size bigger if you can.  I'm a very comfortable 2x with most retailers, but I ordered a 3x and it still fits somewhat small.  Color looked just like it did in the pic but won't stay off-shoulder if you move your arms more than an inch.  I'd recommend ordering 2 or even 3 sizes bigger of you want it off-shoulder all the time.  Still pretty cute, though!"
4.0,"It's good, wish it was a little heavier"
4.0,"This Cardigan sweater has an appealing stylish design, is comfortable and fits as expected for the ordered XL. The sweater zips up well, and the collar can be folded down or left up. The weight is not light, I would consider this on the heavier weight side of sweaters I have, but still feels comfortable. One thing that was unexpected is the sweater lacks pockets, lacking the two you would normally have on the sides, so there is nothing to slip your hands into. Also to note there is no pocket on the inside to store anything. If this had pockets would have been perfect. I highly recommend this sweater, but please keep in mind it lacks pockets."
4.0,I wonder if it is an authentic Seiko watchband. It is little different than the one that comes with the watch. But this works. The leather feels great and the quality is very good.
4.0,Only gave 4 stars because I am an athletic 58 water guide and my softer midsection still shows too much even with a large. Otherwise the quality is great. I usually wear a stretch medium or large non stretchy. 5 foot 120 lbs 36 D bra. longer legs and arms.  I can't go larger or the shoulders would be too wide. Giving it to one of my younger Guidesses. She will love it with her flat athletic tummy.
4.0,Very pretty. Just like in pics.
4.0,This set of three heart necklaces arrived quickly. I loved that there were three different sizes of hearts on each necklace. It would be a great gift to give a couple of family members or friends while keeping one for yourself.
4.0,"When the earrings arrived the studs were bent down so I had to straighten them out.  Easy fix and still great.  Bought a matching OWL shirt haha, Cool mom here!"
4.0,This style has a wider shoulder strap that is a little more comfortable it also has alot more padding around the underwire.
4.0,Velcro not “snap back”
4.0,VERY gold but it's still cute. You got what you pay for. I bought these for my 6 bridesmaids.
4.0,Cute dress. But material looks inexpensive. Fits well.
4.0,luckily many had mentioned the size issue - so really think big=smaller else material a bit light but a nice cover up for the beach and sunny days
4.0,"Cheap, novelty glasses. Pretty cool for themes and such. The flag pattern on the lenses really does obstruct your vision more than you would think."
4.0,this came very quick and exactly as the picture shows. even came with a clear retainer. super cute just gotta figure out how to put it in now lol thnx!
4.0,"This company should really consider making this product in larger sized, their sales would go through the roof!!  Awesome material, but runs small enough to have you a bit scared."
4.0,"Gave away to kids, who love them."
4.0,Cute design. Cool as long as you don't put it inside of your case cover. I like it.its very helpful when I'm using my tablet
4.0,"I’ve been using Ryka water shoes 5 days a week, this particular shoe did not feel near as comfortable for the same shoe-different color. I do like the easy on & off of Ryka shoes, the toggle string and having a small arch support!"
4.0,"I like it ok, its flares out a little at the hip but I do not have large hips and I’m sort. Good quality, I ordered xxl"
4.0,"These boxers are really cute and very comfortable. Since I got them last week, I have had to wash and dry the two with trains over night because he will pull them out of the laundry basket and put them on.<br />My 3 year old son has a small waist (he can still fit in most 18m shorts!) so after reading the reviews, I bought the medium size. It fit perfectly but I don't see him wearing it very long. I think they are more like brief than boxers. They are short, slim fitted and don't have wide legs. My son prefers these because it is easier for him to fit them under his trousers.<br />Shipping was good. I received them a week early.<br />We'll see how they hold up after several washings. So far, I like them and will buy more."
4.0,"I got this one as a gift, and all I remember is that it was what I expected to get."
4.0,"The color and design of this skirt is exactly what I was looking for…but it is too short on me for the mermaid look I was going for. For reference, I am 5’9, I wear a US size 10 pants and medium in shirts. The back is fine, but the front of the skirt stops at about two inches above my ankles. Also, the top of the skirt is a little loose on me. I probably could have gone with a medium to get the fitted look because I am going to have to add a couple layers of fabric to the bottom of the skirt anyway. All in all though, I am happy with the skirt which is why I gave it 4 stars. I just wish I could have known the exact length of the front of the skirt before I placed the order."
4.0,It fit my sister great! Looked very comfortable.
4.0,"They fit really well and are comfortable. The leather is good quality, strong, and soft. The gloves are also warm and look great. I have one issue. The bow popped right off day one."
4.0,These shower shoes are a good value. Solidly built and at a fair price.
4.0,Hides my stomach (3 kids). I like that I can wear different lengths and pull down over my hips if I want. Be prepared for all the extra material to float up around your chest when you get into the pool though. That looks a little weird but you get used to it. I bought a small and am 5'3 and 120.
4.0,A little tight but I am a big guy.
4.0,"Totally worth the, what? $7 something I paid for it?  It's cute, keeps time and is a neat design.<br />Tired of having to take out my phone all the time, I'm currently doing the research for a 'good' watch, one that will stand up to anything and not be disposable.  For &#60;$10, this cutie will keep me on time while I work on finding that investment watch.<br />also: Burning Man.<br />The leather is painted dark brown, the paint rubs off, if you work at it, which I am.  The leather thong broke, serendipitiously, to just the right length, as I was rubbing the paint off.  I'll replace the leather thong with ribbon, or new leather thong and a rivet, when this one's done, as the hardware (watch body and simple clasp) will easily work with anything. No problem.<br />  Some reviews say the leather smells strongly.  I have a catastrophically sensitive nose, and yes, the leather does have a scent, but it seems to me to be a fairly ordinary 'new painted leather' scent, and not an over the top, 'wtf did they even do to this, is it going to kill me?' chemical smell."
4.0,"It is cute, could really be a lot bigger. Will probably add to a bracelet."
4.0,Wore it in my Bday. Everyone loved it. Ordered a L.
4.0,"very good , but need more time to wear them"
4.0,Great fit soft worth the money would buy again
4.0,A beautiful piece. Hopefully my husband will love it.
4.0,Very pretty and I get compliments whenever I wear it
4.0,Nice buy my yellow paint was a little chipped in top. I got this for a decoration on my computer desk
4.0,Was a bit smaller than expected. Love the clasp. Well made
4.0,"Looks great clear vision. But don’t drop them, lens will scratch easy."
4.0,Wallet is nice but not wide enough for all the things I wanted to put into it.
4.0,Best underwear gear.
4.0,Beautiful skirt and fabric. Doesn’t stretch because of the zipper and clasp but otherwise really lovely. Could use size bigger but then the hips would be too big.
4.0,"Overall, this is a beautiful dress, but not ideal for curvy women. The glitter is so pretty in person (I ordered the royal blue and was so excited when I opened the package) and the fabric is stretchy. However, I disliked the fit. This dress can become very exposing for curvy women like myself. I ordered a size up from what I saw from other reviews (I'm postpartum so still not down to pre-preg weight, still kinda winging it...) to account for my hips and booty but still had to hold closed the slit all night so my booty wouldn't be exposed. Also, please be conscious that the fabric becomes see through with a flash on your camera.<br /><br />For reference, I'm 5'8"", measurements are 42-34-49 wearing an XL"
4.0,Giving four stars because material is rough.
4.0,"Not bad for the price. As many have noticed, this ring is too wide to wear comfortabley. I'm not sure what they say either. Not in English. Cool fidget toys."
4.0,I loved this top but the large was too small.  So I gave it to my daughter and I will order the Xtra large.  I'm 5' 5.6&#34; 145lbs...  it's nicely made.  The lace on the sleeve is very pretty and well stitched.
4.0,"Runs a bit small, but it's cute and padded, which is a plus."
4.0,So these liners did what I needed them to do and that was to provide something between my feet and the shoe to prevent my feet from smelling because I do have quite stinky feet. However what I do not like about these is that they have little grippy things on the ball of the foot and when I wear my heels with them they tend to kind of pinched my feet almost creating blisters. I don't have this problem with my flats as much but with my heels I do. The only reason I did not give it the five stars is because of the the grippies on the ball of the foot. Now with that being said I still wear them on a regular basis because they do what I need them to do.
4.0,"I’m 5ft and around 120lbs, with a petite slight build body type. 32C in bra size and normally a small in clothes. The small was a great fit. My only concern is how sheer the material is."
4.0,Tad bit small but great price.
4.0,"Comfortable dress, I'm 4'11&#34; so of course it's long but it is very flattering for 136 lbs 36b chest..  I will probably find someone to hem the dress nothing I'm not used to have done at my height.  I will suggest a slip but I'm 52 & a bit old fashioned when it comes to these things."
4.0,Great little backpack. Small but holds a lot with ample inside pockets and a padded partition. Only down side is the straps do not adjust and it's difficult to get on and off of stripped to your back as the strap length is made for children. Works just fine slinging over one shoulder.
4.0,Cute shirt BUT the arms are a printed plaid…. not actual flannel…looks cheaper in person
4.0,They're pretty big actually.. But these r perfect beach glasses.. A great mirrored reflection and produces lots of shade for the eyes. Can't beat it for $10..
4.0,So happy the dress came! Looks nice and flattering on me. I love the material. Feels nice.
4.0,"i use them when i go for a jog. they work. not as nice as Oakleys, but hey thats why they are cheaper right"
4.0,"Cute!  Love the boxes they come in, they're perfect for gift giving."
4.0,Good quality although it's a little see through in the light & the band around the waist isn't flattering.
4.0,"Sizing is definitely confusing, I usually wear a small or medium and  I ordered a Large and I am 5'9&#34; and about 140 lbs It does fit for the body, I'm just not a fan of the sleeves. When rolled up and using the button on the sleeve, they hit my arm completely weird and above the elbow! Not what I had in mind, and when unrolled they are slightly short for me. I just wear the sleeves down and tugged them up a little on my forearms to make it work."
4.0,This is a beautiful necklace. From the photos I was thinking the fought diamonds were going to be a darker charcoal Grey instead they were a light Grey but it is still a beautiful necklace! Very unique
4.0,Love this for the money... really cute and functional... note; the handle is a thin rope...
4.0,"Well, beautiful but you can only wear it without a bra.  I don't recommend it for those with big breasts like me."
4.0,Good quality handbag.  Just wish it was just a tad bit bigger.
4.0,"Comfy. Was not expecting elastic on the sides at the bottom, but it doesn't pull very much."
4.0,Elegant shirt. Satisfied with order
4.0,"It's a pretty good mask. It's a bit harder to see out of than the one that comes with the costume, but the quality is much better. Also, the hood comes with these tacky dangling pieces of cloth, but you can just hide them in the hood. Overall, great if you want more movie quality, with very minor complaints."
4.0,"Are you a up-and-coming mad scientist, steam revivalist, or just plain looney? Then these face hole sun light protectors are for you! With a nifty, flip-up shading portion, these glasses make you look like you just walked out of the Bikini Atoll test site, complete with glowing skin!<br /><br />Only slight complaint which seems to be recurring, they're just a tad small in the width dimension, but otherwise do their job without complaining!"
4.0,"Somewhat lightweight.  We'll see how they do with my existing shoes.  Other than that, the size is fine, the grip on the ankle is fine and they seem comfortable."
4.0,"The metal part was truly amazing and impressive looking, but the velvet choker part was too weak to sustain the weight of the metal. I swapped it out with a stiffer ribbon. It's worth the buy if only for the rhinestone parts."
4.0,Comfortable but I suspect its effectiveness is limited. I have another singers mask that works much better.
4.0,"Super cute! The 0-3 Month Fit my 3 Month old perfectly. 4 Stars for me, just because the skirt was a tad tight on my baby but I would definitely purchase from this company again! ❤️"
4.0,Working great for shoes and boots...
4.0,Nice thick well<br />Made cotton leggings
4.0,"This was a stocking stuffer. Reasonably priced but it is kind of heavy. And he has to remove a few links to make it fit. The lights are quite bright, just fyi. But overall it's nice. :)"
4.0,It's pretty! I like it a lot
4.0,I like this necktie  a lot.  I receive many compliments when I wear it.
4.0,"I love the harem style with the ankle bands to keep the pants close to the leg at the bottom.  These are soft, silky and so comfortable that I often use them for pajama pants.  The only reason I did not give them a 5-star rating is that the fabric used is not a good quality cotton, it pills and does not have that nice fresh look after several wearings and washing.  They are still comfortable for pajamas, however."
4.0,Very nice for this price. If there were more colors I would buy another one.
4.0,"This shirt is really cute. The only issue I have with it is the shoulder pads. It kinda makes me feel like I am kicking it 80's style. Usually, if an item has shoulder pads they are just attached my 2 little stitches. These are sewn all the way in, so they can't be easily removed. I haven't tried because I am scared I will mess up the shirt."
4.0,fits as expected except sleeve fills tight
4.0,"Good quality for the price, but very long. Had to sand them all down with a dremel or you can see it sticking out your nostril."
4.0,Bought for my daughter..she adores them
4.0,This is a really cute apron. Not sure why they use a cartoony picture on Amazon because the actual apron looks a lot better than that picture. I've been wearing it when I'm baking cookies and I think it helps everyone be in a little better mood for Christmas. It’s festive and fun.
4.0,"Wearing them as this is written. When I first got them, I was worried they were too childish. The style hasn't really blossomed here in South Florida. Plus, these r confetti stars in the back of the earring. I had imagined it to be a drawing on the back glass ball by looking at the pictures. But everybody complemented them; even my boyfriend who called the new fashion trend ""Keloid-tooking"". I love them and wear them often with my hair ip. The back is not too large; the flower front is gorgeous."
4.0,The cardigan is a pretty grey with a nice soft feel. It would be perfect on me if I were taller. I’m 5’2 and it looks too long for my body. It almost touches the back of my knees. For someone taller than me it would go really well with leggings and boots.
4.0,Sport your support for the Kawi people
4.0,"It's bigger than I expected and its sturdy, but the inside material is made a little cheap. So far so good:)"
4.0,"Feels cheap, but are stylish and nice."
4.0,"Really cute and my six year old loves it.  I ordered a large for her since she wears 7/8, and it gives her a little growing room."
4.0,I have a square shape to my face so I like getting circular lenses to balance out my face. I got these hoping they would be oversized enough to fit my face shape and they were a tad bit toooo oversized lol. But overall I have them already so im keeping them. They look exactly as shown in the picture but be aware the lenses and frame are bigger than two inches for each eye.
4.0,They are well made shoe tress. The size XL trees are 1/4 in to small they fit loose in the shoe had to add a piece of towl to tightening them up to work properly.
4.0,"I'm giving this organizer 4 stars only because of the high price, otherwise it is exactly as advertised. In"
4.0,Really nice 5'9 193lb and DD 36 bust and this thing fit like really nice once it got it on. The top keep bunching up so it took a few times. But other then that once once it fit well and nice for around the house
4.0,"Fits perfectly, comfortable, and nice quality. I bought them in 3 colors."
4.0,they are nice. . .large. . .but nice
4.0,"The color is beautiful but, the sleeves of the arm lenghts are stort. Im tall, about 5&#34;6. So, my arms and torso are long. So, the dress lenght was a little shorter than I pictured it. Two inches above my knee's."
4.0,I wear this bracelet as an anklet. It’s really cute and I am super proud to wear it because I love my nephew so much. The string is a little thin but it’s petite so I love it.
4.0,"Nice bracelet, a little sharp on the edges. One of my favorite quotes."
4.0,These fit my husband's size 14 feet and prevented swelling on a long road trip
4.0,"Like the quality and detail. The case is well designed and well made<br />Unfortunately, the compartments are on the small side: will hold small reading glasses, but not larger frame sunglasses."
4.0,Beautiful earrings. Came on time and great price. Would definitely recommend and would love more!
4.0,"I am not sure it is the correct size!<br />I ordered 12 US which is 29-30 in European measurement. What i received is size 26. It is too small for my 5 year old son.<br />Overall , the shoes are nice."
4.0,"It’s very cute. The top actually has bra cups that are nice, not removable. The strings on the bottoms are a little iffy. If you pull them too tight I feel like they might tear. The bottoms are a little more cheeky than I’d like but they’re still cute! I’m 5’3 and 155lbs, a large fit great."
4.0,Kids liked them able to see well and comfortable.
4.0,It doesn't look exactly as the picture but very nice and complementing.
4.0,"I love these shoes! But my gosh they are the hardest shoe to ever put on! My 3yo daughter can’t put them on and dad & I both struggle. It’s as if the opening isn’t wide enough, or stretchy enough to get a foot in. It takes a lot of effort. My daughter actually has small feet too! Which is a shame because otherwise I swear these are the best shoes because of the arch support fit my two left feet daughter."
4.0,"This dress is really pretty, the hips are a bit snug if you have curves but the material was semi-stretchy. When I received the dress one of the belt loops were not sewn so that was kind of a bummer but it was an easy enough fix. The material is thinner so I did wear a body suit slip under it to make sure it wasn’t see through. I had to steam it bc it had very deep wrinkles in it. I am 5’11” and 190lbs and it came right below my knees! I bought a large."
4.0,Cute but sleeves are short
4.0,Rhinestones on one side needed to be glued back on.  Over all fit is good.  Cute kitty wiskers included have not yet been used.
4.0,My daughter has made some great paracord bracelets with these. The price was right. They're clearly not intended for paracord bracelets because one side is designed for an adjustable strap. You can see that in the picture provided. I'm not complaining. I got what I ordered.
4.0,Without the top piece in it is virtually invisible. Perfect for work or anywhere you can't wear visible piercings.
4.0,my niece enjoyed it
4.0,Love this bracelet.  Color is stunning.  I already have one for myself but I bought this color for someone else.  The bracelet is so classy.  The materials and glass do not look cheap.  Great bracelet for the price.
4.0,I like this top. I bought asian large size. I am size 4-6 US. Good casual top.
4.0,The wallet is as bright as the picture shows. The only down side is it came with this burn mark.
4.0,Large and seems durable! Exactly what it says🤗<br />I look forward to using it in 10 days on my trip!
4.0,"Overall this dress was nice. I thought the material would have been a bit thicker but other than that, it was good."
4.0,fuzzy and nice.  but  pretty short
4.0,"Be sure to look at the size chart for this particular item. I got the size that was an inch or two larger than my bust 44'), and it was a bit tight."
4.0,"My only complaint is that the vneck area kept flipping outwards, showing the raw seam.  I wish it would lay flatter"
4.0,"My husband loves the idea of a watch that clips on to his belt loop, but he is kind of rough on them (or I should say our two kids are - they like to pull on them, etc).  So, I saw this on and thought what a great Christmas present.  It was delivered on time and as soon as I opened it, I thought - Wow! that is big!<br /><br />The watch is light for its size, but it is big.  It looks very sturdy and it had all of the features we wanted, but it is just too big.  I only write this review and took a picture (which I am hopeful to submit) so that people can see its size.  There were no dimensions when I bought the watch, so could not tell how big it was.<br /><br />Also, the black things around the face of the dial is flexible rubber - not hard plastic.<br /><br />We liked the watch and all it could do, but it was just too big."
4.0,I like the fit. It is comfortable and easy to wear. The color is versatile to wear with anything. I like the style.
4.0,"Great band, looks fantastic!<br />A bit cumbersome to take off and put on again."
4.0,It's great to have the variety of colors to match with any tie I own. Probably could even mix a couple colors together. Nice and silky smooth too. I would have given 5 stars if these were real handkerchief size but they are so small I will have to buy a pocket square holder so they don't sink to the bottom of my jacket pocket. It's gonna cost me another $20.
4.0,I liked the overall fit but for some reason up at the top around the shoulders it always wanted to hang off of my shoulder it wasn't fitting properly so I had to pin and modify it so it would fit other than that it was pretty nice I think it could have been a little bit cheaper in price but all in all I'm pretty happy with it.
4.0,Thin and airy 👍
4.0,"This item was hard to find. I use these for earrings. loops are much more comfortable than posts. Its a good utility item, it might not hold up to years of use. I like them. And I'm satisfied with these."
4.0,"Perfect lightweight pullover, fits perfectly according to size chart. No fading after a few washes either."
4.0,"These were very nice fit, fit well. However, I ordered wine and received red."
4.0,"A little tight, good quality, recommend ordering 1 size up"
4.0,Love the dress. Disappointed that it looks more flow like in the photos. Very strong cotton kind of heavy material.  It will not spin like you think it may in the pic when you go dancing.
4.0,"They're great tights. Very comfortable, not thin, on par with an expensive set I got a while back. The only issue? Even with the sizing chart, they were a tad too small. I can still wear them- though I wholeheartedly believe it'd be so much better if they were a little larger. I say follow the size chart, but then order a size bigger, if you can."
4.0,"Great to get on, not over the head. New parents: don't buy newborn size! It's ok if it's big: start with 0-3 month sizes"
4.0,"Sturdy but stained some khaki shorts. Seems to be sturdy, I don't like how the belt is tacked to the buckle, I wish it was riveted or sewn instead. Dropping the stars to 4 stars because of the buckle attachment using a fine cord at 4 points that could give under extreme pressure and because of staining fabric. It is a really pretty color with a line down the center and false stitch marks along the edges. It did scratch from one use, see picture.  True to size.  The width of the leather may be tight on some jeans."
4.0,I like them lens are a hard to change but so far so good
4.0,"I LOVE this dress! It fits as expected. I am 5'7 and wear a size 14 pant. This dress felt comfortable. It is light and breathable. The stitching looks like it was done well. My only issue with the dress was that one of the buttons came off. But it was an easy fix. Before wearing it, you might want to re-enforce the buttons with some more thread. They are only held on by a few strands."
4.0,These were amazing. The only thing I had a problem with was that the loop and the was to big so it looked fake
4.0,I like it ..eventhough it is smaller than i expect ..it is great for . everyday .. I  like it more when i wore my accessories and bracelets with it make it look more fashinable
4.0,Was as expected following size chart helped to find proper fit.
4.0,"Little smaller than expected and it's a clasp instead of a zipper, but it gets the job done! Happy overall (:"
4.0,Ok. They are a little too dark
4.0,A little bit shorter stocking than traditional compression stockings I've had but not too much compression.
4.0,"There is no way to adjust the strapping in the center of the suit but overall, I’m happy with the way the product feels and fits"
4.0,"Although this is a nice ring, the detail is not as deep as portrayed in the picture. The picture makes the work look carved and it's not. It's no different tan any other etched band.<br />I'm sure I'll use it but I am so disappointed."
4.0,"The dress fits very well, is comfortable, and flies all the way to the floor. The fabric is not too thin either."
4.0,Lots of compliments in this dress. Love the fabric!
4.0,Certainly not the best quality you will ever see but quite a selection and not the worst quality. Very good bang for your buck for everyday use.
4.0,"I am always looking for good body jewelry that will not break me out with my sensitive skin.  This is harder to find than you think but I have been relatively pleased with this product.  I wish they were about a half centimeter longer as they just barely hook into my nose.  I like that they come in several colors which I can match to my other jewelry.  It is hard to find a set that has several colors, most just come in one to two colors so four colors is a nice set.  I was offered this product in exchange for my honest review.  I hope you have found my review to be helpful and would appreciate if you would indicate so by clicking the helpful link."
4.0,Isela para personas de mediano tamaño
4.0,"The quality is not very good, I don’t think they’ll last long. Also 3 of 8 boxers in the pack were the wrong size! I ordered 14, and two of them were size 10, and one - size 12."
4.0,Flattering suit (hard to find that!) and fairly comfortable.  It started out a bit tight and stiff but no doubt will loosen up with wearing and washing.
4.0,"This is very cute and just what I was looking for, however make sure to measure your neck before buying. I did not and found it was a few links short and had to add some so it would fit. Otherwise it is a cute piece of costume jewelry!"
4.0,Love the purse it just will not stay closed.  Kinda a bummer.  I love this brand so was surprised with the way it keeps falling open.  Hoping I can find a way to have it fixed so I can use it more.
4.0,"Good, practical, gloves for mildly cold weather."
4.0,"These are cute - soft material, very comfy.  I usually wear an 8/10 - Medium but I sized up to a large and glad I did.  Although they state ""high wasted"" - these are not as they come right to my belly button.  I am only 5'4 so it's not like I'm tall.  The large fit kind of like a medium.  I think if I would go up to XL they may be too big.  Overall very cute and fun for Halloween."
4.0,"Purchased for Halloween costume. Fits 6 yr old sons hands well, just right he says. There is room and give in the hands and fits up to elbow."
4.0,Fit was good and very comfortable. Not each color fits the same. Blue fit perfectly black were a bit tight and same with the tan
4.0,Good fit. Washes great.
4.0,"These glasses are fabulous! I live in a desert and can't abide tiny &#34;fashionable&#34; lenses (will fashion help you when you have eye cancer? No. Don't be stupid. Get real glasses), so finding these giant Marlo Thomas-esque glasses was a delight. The frames sit closely to my face--no glare bouncing off the corners into my eyes or &#34;light spots&#34; around the edges--and they're dark enough that my bicycle commute can be made without squinting or turning my head away from the sidewalk ahead. They even come with a carrying case to prevent lens damage!<br /><br />People who've worn very good polarized glasses may put these on and be disappointed. There is polarization, but colors do not appear richer or brighter with the glasses on--they filter out sun, but my experience was that they don't do much to cut through haze or solar washout. If you're looking for a fancy pair to go to the Grand Canyon or the Painted Desert, go ahead and buy the ridiculous $200 ones, because these won't do what you're looking for. But if you're in the desert, and looking for a way to keep the sun from destroying your eyes at every turn, these are an extremely solid choice.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: In accordance with Amazon.com policy, I fully disclose that I received this product at a reduced cost in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I stand behind this review as being truthful and based on my real experience with the product."
4.0,"I actually bought it for myself since I liked the image and thought it would look nice on me. Although the color and material is great, the size it a little bigger than I expected and the sleeves are too long. I don’t think I’ll be wearing it outside, maybe for walks or hikes over tights. Otherwise it’s too baggy for me"
4.0,It was shorter than others that I have ordered in the past. Still cute and functional just shorter torso.
4.0,The fabric was nice on my skin and the robe itself is very sexy. Wanted to show skin but not too much skin for my wedding night and leave something to eye. I gave it 4 stars because the one size fit is nice but was a little long for me only being 5&#34;0.
4.0,"This dress was pretty and I loved the color, but it was also too small. Again, I used the chart provided as a guide to choose my size."
4.0,The part that goes into the ear is too thick.
4.0,I am happy with this product. Fits pretty good though small in the toes.
4.0,"This was my fault. It was a nice skirt but I didn’t pay attention to sizing. I ordered an XXL because I’m 5’3” and 210-215lbs...so I thought that would be okay but I also have a lot of ass..so it was just way too short. The material was good..didn’t really care for the packaging. All in all, great buy, but not for me. I’ll tell you now, if you have some booty...don’t bother or buy the longer one and wear it high waisted. Unless you wanna flaunt them cheeks then hey girl heyyyyy, get it. The return was stupid easy. And got my refund the exact same day!"
4.0,Takes time getting used to but sure do give your feet a workout.
4.0,"I really love this romper and I can't wait to wear it. It is very comfortable and is very flattering. I am 5'2"" and 144 pounds and ordered a medium. I have a rounder middle, so sometimes rompers can be unflattering, but because of the wider legs, this one accentuates your waist and makes it look smaller than your hips. Great summer outfit - Can be dressed up with heels or down with flats or flops. The only downside was that the material wrinkles easily, but you can fix that with a steamer. Hope that helps!"
4.0,Worked as expected. Good sound quality. Compact enough to fit within a breadboard.
4.0,What nice sweatshirt! Fit perfectly. I spilled red wine on it and it came right out!
4.0,This is the second time I've ordered these foot cushions and will definitely order again. I use them in my ballroom dance shoes to cushion my feet and to keep my feet from slipping in the shoe. I like the softness and can clean with a damp cloth when needed. I'm pleased.
4.0,It's just fine.
4.0,I like the nose ring but I can’t get it in !
4.0,Product is durable
4.0,This boot is cute and comfortable; the fit is comfortable. Not snug not loose. I feel happy with it. The company is committed to its customers.
4.0,Package was damaged but glasses are nice for the price.
4.0,Love this hat! My 2 year old gets tons of compliments on this hat and it fits better than any other hat we've tried (and we've tried a lot). The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is the nubs on the snap have disintegrated after a few months of regular wear.
4.0,They’re cut just a smidge small but will do
4.0,"It is nice, but too long and too large for me."
4.0,"It's actually a fairly nice watch.  Doesn't look cheap at all.  My only gripe is the description utilizing the phrase &#34;Moon Phase&#34; because I was expecting it to be an actual phase of the moon dial, but it's actually just a Sun/Moon 24 hour movement."
4.0,"First note that this is for the watch that has the notches in the band, the Peeble Steel. Second know that the band includes spring pins but you will need to use your screw pins from the original band. Third, you'll need a very small screw driver because the pins are removed by screwing the pins out, not by pressure release.<br /><br />The band is comfortable. It has a wide range of sizing variation. The silicone material doesn't not get hot or itchy. I worried about trapped moisture causing irritation but so far I haven't experienced any. The band does collect a little lint but it isn't too terrible.<br /><br />The thing that bothers me the most is that the band sticks out and catches often. There is two rings to hold the end down but it slides back up allowing the end to flap around. I have a small wrist and I use the second notch so if used on a larger wrist it probably wouldn't do this.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good band at a good price and it looks okay. It doesn't have the same classy look as the leather but it is easier to clean and more waterproof, two things important to me as a nurse that has to wash often. My original leather band got water logged and wore out after one year."
4.0,I can't really say until Christmas I bought them for him.  This is what he wanted..
4.0,Wish they were slightly looser on top.  Otherwise they work great for the shoes were a regular thin trouser sock wont work.
4.0,Bought them for my 6 year old and they are extremely small. He still wears them but they are made for a toddler.
4.0,Bonito pero queda grande hay que comprar un zice menos
4.0,It fit me but was quite tight but I think it;; stretch a bit. Med.might have been too large. I am always a sm. size 4 or 6.
4.0,I love it its simple and stylish as described
4.0,Ordered two. One came in broken.
4.0,I love it it’s beautiful
4.0,Hold all the things that need held.
4.0,"Ok. I don't LOVE  this dress, but I love this dress. The fit was better than expected (I don't usually hold very high expectations for dresses whether I buy online or attempt to shop in store in person). That being said... it takes a little finesse to get your fit right with the tie piece. I read another review that said she switched the tie to be in the back along with switching the key hole front to be the back and I may try that because the tie to the side just feels a little awkward no matter what I do. The material is soft and so smooth, has just enough stretch and is very comfortable. It is a tad shinier than I expected, but not enough to be a dealbreaker. The color in the print is more of a pink than a tan, so that was a bit unexpected based on how it looked on my monitor but I actually like it that way and I'm not a huge fan of pink. The length is just right - hits right at the top of the knee on me.<br />All in all I really like this dress. I plan on wearing it on it's own, but also with a suit style of jacket and a silky cardigan- it looks great any of these ways."
4.0,I ordered the kid's size but they're too big even for an adult. They don't stay up on our faces. I'd hate to see how big the adult sized ones are.
4.0,"This dress is really cute, nicer material than I thought. My only issue with it is that being a wrap dress, it's more likely to fly open in moderate-strong winds. Just beware of wearing it in a beachy setting. I also had issues with the front becoming loose and too much cleavage, but I think I have had that issue with other wraps so I don't think it's the fault of this one. I got a lot of compliments wearing it though, it's very pretty."
4.0,I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He is 6ft and weighs 120 lbs. it's very warm and the inside is kinda like a thermal material. My boyfriend says that it fits him well however it does look a little tight in the arms and in the chest. He lifts a lot (if that tells you anything) and I ordered him a large. This is a great basic sweatshirt
4.0,"The arms are long enough, however, the curve starts before the ears and gives a look that make it seem to short. There lot of length behind the ears. The colour could be brighter as well"
4.0,"I was so pleasantly surprised with the quality of this band considering how inexpensive it is. I ordered the camel color with the space gray clasp and it compliments my space gray watch perfectly. I have a tiny wrist and this watch fit great with a few holes extra! I love the look and feel of the genuine leather. The only reason I did not give this band five stars is because I’m pretty sure the clasp is not metal. It feels more like plastic. But, it still looks very nice. I’ll be ordering more colors for sure!"
4.0,"Item received on time. Upon opening, I tried out the flower and diamond ""drop"" earrings in my rook piercing. Super cute, but boy was it hard to get them in due to screwing the ball back on. One secured, I wore each of them on separate occasions. Neither were particularly comfortable for me though, due to the protruding decorative end. They might work out great in a different piercing though.<br /><br />I wanted to try out the two curved barbells, separately, in my daith piercing. Again, very difficult to get that sucker screwed back on the end. I think a slightly longer piece would have worked out better as it was next to impossible for me to secure either curved barbell on my daith Piercing, but they work well in my rook, when I have 45 mins to screw around with changing it out.<br /><br />The seamless moon ring was quite easy to get in (my right daith is pierced so I just flipped it upside down to get it to look correct in my piercing). After a night or so of sleeping on it, any initial soreness went away. After a few weeks it was brought to my attention that my piercing and jewelry were both green! Sure enough, the moon ring had begun to tarnish and turn green, along with my daith piercing.<br />This has ONLY happened with that particular piece, as I wear the ""diamond"" stud curved barbell in my left rook 24/7 with absolutely NO ISSUES. I'm guessing the moon jewelry isn't made out of the same durable material.<br /><br />If you don't mind religious cleaning of that specific piece, go for it! It's still a great set at a great price. I just ordered a different ring to wear in my daith, so no real biggie there."
4.0,"My wife recommended these. The green color version is nice. They have a light polarized coating. These shipped with a hard and soft case. There was a screw tool & kit as well as a cloth to clean. I use these as my driving glasses, and get many compliments on them."
4.0,Looks great but a bit big for my neck lol
4.0,"It's kinda fun wearing it when you work in a lab. it's not a discrete accessory, but not too big"
4.0,"These are soooo soft and comfy. I was concerned the length wouldn't be long enough as I am 5'10"" with long legs but they sit right at my ankle so perfect for me. I bought the plus sized (being180 ish pounds) and they are super high waist and fit good with a little extra room to spare."
4.0,Fit as described. My husband wears it at work with no issue.
4.0,"The product is top notch as far as quality but it is 2 sizes to small. ORDER LARGER or you will not be able to wear it!  Otherwise, it is simply gorgeous and the material is soft."
4.0,Nice sneakers for school
4.0,"Great price for a really cute pj set. I love the pants and the button up top. The shorts are a little long, but that wasn't a big deal. It's a comfortable fit at a great price. It's not Victoria Secret Quality, but they are very nice!"
4.0,"Hat is great, but a little small around the ears."
4.0,Fit perfectly and wasn't too heavy.
4.0,I use it as a pool cover up instead of a top!
4.0,"Sleeves are a little baggy, but we got a lot of compliments on it at Halloween!"
4.0,"great bag for the price. if you are a larger person like myself, the bag does not adjust as much as you would like. I am not complaining, it fits me snug but I really like this bag. can hold my laptop as well as my school stuff."
4.0,Love this because it is super loose and comfy - but I'm petite and it was 10 inches too long and the sleeves have to be rolled up multiple times. I'm using it for lounge wear and I love it.
4.0,Perfect! True to size …. I’m a Medium
4.0,"Smaller than I thought. I ordered for my daith, ended up working perfect. Can not tell detail because it is small"
4.0,"I wanted shorts to hold my phone but these pockets are too small. They are comfortable but i wish the inside shorts were tighter, seem cheaply made. Good if you just want to hold Chapstick and have a comfy pair of shorts though."
4.0,I bought this pair back in 2013 - and they have never failed me. Bought them to the beach and even went in the water with them. My favorite pair of summer sunnies!
4.0,This bracelet is just what I expected for the price.  It's adjustable strap is perfect for my small arm. I would recommend this item to anyone.
4.0,"Not Yellow.A mustard beige in actuality.It fit as expected.<br />Easily ironed.<br />Does not wrinkle easily,or at all.<br />Great high-waisted skirt.<br />Below the knee length.<br />Only 4 stars because the color was not as pictured."
4.0,This product was very nice only thing I didnt pick the right size for my daughter and she grew out of it quickly.
4.0,Very nice add on for a gift it came a little later than expected but it was light weight and true to color
4.0,Cute freshwater pearls!<br />Love these. Authentic - the backing and post aren’t the best quality but for the price - these are really cute.<br /><br />They are bigger than I thought they would be and I’m fine with that.<br /><br />Packaged very nicely and would make a great gift also.
4.0,"Necklace is very nice, good quality for the price. The box it came in is super cheesy though. Makes the gift look cheaper than it is. I would recommend putting the necklace in a different box if giving as a gift."
4.0,Some of the backings were mismatched.
4.0,I loved it 😍 the only thing I didn't like was the opening in the chest area. I had to pin it up to make it look decent at the wedding. I would definitely recommend this dress!
4.0,"This bracelet is absolutely beautiful and so well made. I really like it. But it's way too small and fits only average sized wrist with comfort. My hubs wrist is thicker than average. Although he was able to fasten it, it was way too tight for comfort. But for smaller wrists I totally recommend. It's a bada$$ bracelet, very stylish and has bad boy vibe to it."
4.0,"Cute.  Somewhat snug.  It's hard to determine an exact size to order when you're &#34;between&#34; two sizes on the size chart provided.  If you are also between two sizes, I suggest that you go up. Otherwise it's very nice."
4.0,"I am 5’7”, 225, mostly legs, I wear a 40 DD. The dress got nice depending on where you are wearing it. The color was accurate. The sleeves were snug"
4.0,I am reading a lot of people who say this thing is not loud at all.  Mine is deafening!  I would have given it 5 starts except  I think it's too big.  Definitely loud enough though!
4.0,To old lady looking
4.0,Very beautiful watch and definitely love it so far but……is this a scam or something? Look at other reviews and pictures why is my authenticity card not filled out completely and why do i have a lower number 148/1000 than older purchases that have a review of this same watch? Some as old as a few years ago have a higher number 🤔 it doesn’t add up
4.0,These were fun to wear to a 4th of July party.  They look nice and are comfortable.  I’ll wear them again next year.
4.0,"The fit is good, the hat is warm and the knit is perfect"
4.0,Not very happy with the fit but it is a good product
4.0,"It's a nice garment. Looks great and fits nicely. Problem is the hemp stitching material is so thin and delicate, it's almost see through, and some of the stitching is already stretching to the point of looking like holes will soon form. So it's not something I can wear regularly, unfortunately. But for special occasions only I suppose"
4.0,These leggings are flattering!! However I was expecting them to be a bit more solid and not so sheer. You will certainly need to wear similar color underwear. The company does ship the leggings with a sticker that says 60-75% coverage. Overall I am satisfied and would purchase another pair for leisure wear.
4.0,absolutely loves it
4.0,"This is a good shirt overall, good quality, design, fresh fabric, and nice color, the size is a little big though."
4.0,"So far so good, sturdy enough to keep my sunglasses safe and lightweight at the same time. The zipper works fine now but feels a little cheap. Will update if/when the zipper breaks."
4.0,Very cute but not so easy to get on by yourself lol. It has a necklace latch. But i do like it.
4.0,"The Sport-Tek hats do what I expected- they wick away moisture well enough on hot, humid days.<br />They are floppy but have enough structure in the front to stay sturdy and I like the mesh material.<br />They do look sharp also with vivid colors. I ordered this red/black cap and a green/slate cap.<br />I would a Sport-Tek cap again if I need another cap."
4.0,Very good skirt. Unfortunately it is very small for its size.
4.0,These are awesome but run HUGE I sized down from a 9.5 to 9 and was swimming in them<br />Size down
4.0,"I LOVE this swimsuit! I sized up one size, I probably could have ordered my original size! So comfy and so many compliments!!!"
4.0,"Cute dress.  It is made surprisingly well.  It is longer than expected, I’m 5’8” and it came right above my knee.  The neckline is not as low as the pics and was a too modest for me.  If you are looking for a modest knee length dress, this one’s for you!"
4.0,Like the shirt should've gotten a large expected Asian fit but I get lots of compliments women love it.
4.0,Ordered 4t for my grandson who is between 3-4t and it fits great.  Wants to wear it every day so it’s been washed 4 times in a week. No noticeable shrinkage or fading.  It was a bit pricey but quality is good.
4.0,"My Sister and I love the sunglasses. Only one drawback was that 2 of the 4 ordered came unassembled and I had to be very careful in snapping the parts together. T'was like whoever originally packed them in their black bags was in a rush and just stuck them in there. Methinks the Pickers who put my order together could have not noticed (maybe) how the bag rattled and felt loose compared to the completed ones. Otherwise, they are comfortable, light and definitely gave my eyes comfort in the bright sun. Love the flip up lens!"
4.0,"It was too small to be an XL. I gave it to my 13 year old who is 5'4"" and weighs 100lbs and it fits nicely on her. The fabric is sturdy and soft. I just wish it fit me!"
4.0,This item was breathtaking and was a wonderful gift.
4.0,It works fine im back to loving my vita
4.0,Great color and material. They would be perfect if they were just an inch shorter
4.0,Like it but size is not accurate.
4.0,"Cute dress, I was worried about the size chart but actually gives me a little bit of room. Would recommend. To get the full effect I bought a petticoat and it looks adorable."
4.0,Did run a little shorter than I would have liked but still works. Sewn well.
4.0,Un poco delicado mi hija lo llevó al parque y se le rompió la tela de arriba se mancha muy fácil
4.0,Great quality! Very pleased. Just seems to be a bit large for a 4t
4.0,The dress looks better on than it does coming from the package. Probably better than the image on Amazon.  Only not a 5 because the style is a little shorter than I usually wear.
4.0,"I love this ring. I receive a lot of compliments. I notice people have complained on Amazon about the ring tarnishing. However, you have to keep in mind it is costume jewelry and not authentic gold/silver metal. I have applied clear finger nail polish to avoid or delay the discoloring from the ring. I wear the ring on my pinky finger. It’s classy and trendy."
4.0,This robe is heavier than most chenille robes.  When you close the robe the pockets are hidden or in the front of the robe which makes them useless.
4.0,"Once on colors are no longer as vibrant, however they work for our need which was Fox in Socks Day, celebrating Dr. Seuss!!!"
4.0,"I like the fit, but I ordered up a few sized based on other reviews. I use these as an under-layer to keep warm when playing softball at night. The sleeve length is decent, and the shirt length is ok...when staying still. Unfortunately, it rolls up pretty consistently when I'm running around. Would have been nice to have an extra inch or two in torso length, or more sturdy fabric, but I think it might stay put better on a leaner figure.<br /><br />I think they're a good value though, for the cost when compared to similar items. I usually wear Women's Size 8, Medium and I like it fitted but not unflattering tight. The largest size (XL) fits without being too constricting but I don't think I would wear it alone without a layer underneath to smooth things out."
4.0,"Love the pattern, colors and fit.<br />Material is cool and forgiving."
4.0,I do like this shirt however will have to layer it over a cami because back is printed as trim and see through.<br />That said shirt is loose fitting flowy and comfortable.<br />I'm happy with it.
4.0,"These are cute and dainty! Like others said they’re a little flimsy and bend easily, but I think that can be expected with thin and dainty jewelry. Just be careful with them. I have very sensitive ears and these irritate them a bit. Not awful like some but I have earrings that don’t bother me at all. I like the endless design, haven’t had any issues with them falling off. Packaging is super cute!"
4.0,Wanted a thin top but not low on quality at all. Would not trade it.
4.0,"Love the product,  I gave 4 star, coz the zipper gives you little problem at time."
4.0,"I really like these scrubs, soft and the shirt is quite comfortable, but they are made weird. I read the reviews and ordered a size larger as recommended, but the cut in the thigh area is quite odd and the pants are definitely smaller than posted. The shirt is perfect."
4.0,"Bought as a gift.. very comfortable and fits smaller wrists. (I would not recommend for kids with small wrists, however they could definitely grow into it).. Elastic ""scrunchie"" band is strong. It is very cute & casual!<br /><br />The frame does not fit the Fitbit Blaze, but they just subbed in the frame from the original Blaze.. There is also some scratching on the part of the band that clicks into the frame but it's not noticeable.. these two things are the reasons I gave 4 stars and not 5."
4.0,Not what I thought by any means but still decent sunglasses.
4.0,Good quality but size ran small
4.0,"I love it,  but as other reviews I found it to be too long on the sleeves to the point of annoyance.<br />Would I buy again, not this particular item. But others undoubtedly.besides that. Texture, material everything very good"
4.0,"nice shirt.  Would fit better on ladies who have a larger chest.  It's big up top on me, but I still like it!"
4.0,i did not realize how much of a pain in the butt ear pins were. pretty but i didn't like them
4.0,Love the cats.  Good colors.
4.0,"The jacket seems nice, but snug fitting. I wear size large, the conversion for this jacket was xxxlarge for size medium. I took my chances and ordered the jacket, it was indeed too small"
4.0,Love it! It's very soft! Fit is just right and true to size. Very pretty!
4.0,"These pants are as pictured and very cute. However, my particular pair came with an odd scratch down the middle of one leg the entire length of the pant. At first I thought it was just a fold crease unfortunately after closer inspection I discovered it is not. But I want to wear these pants soon and don't have time to wait for a replacement so I just hope it's not THAT noticeable! Fingers crossed."
4.0,not quite like the picture. totally see through.
4.0,Fits good and is comfortable so far.
4.0,"I am 5'2, 118 lbs. and was worried about length but they are just right. They are comfortable but pockets get bunched up a bit inside- especially after washing. I thought this would drive me crazy sleeping but after smoothing down they are ok! I just bought another pair..."
4.0,I've used many different shooting muffs and these are for people ears on the smaller side of things.  They do work well to muffle noise and seem to be well made.
4.0,Got this for my son who is a watch buff and he likes it very much.
4.0,Everyone keeps leaving bad reviews about the zip ties  when it literally says that’s what it’s made of in the product description. You get what you pay for
4.0,great fit and great work blouse.
4.0,"Overall, this is a good Medusa wig but it's taken a bit of modification to get it just right.<br /><br />The wig is too large, even with my hair down or adding an additional wig. To fix this, I sewed it together behind the ears.<br /><br />The edges of the wig are not colored and it takes away from the overall effect of the wig. Thankfully, this is a quick fix if you happen to have any olive green nail polish on hand."
4.0,Can't wait to wear it.  It's very comfortable.
4.0,"These studs are beautiful, I love the marbled turquoise ball, however they were much larger in size than I expected! About 8mm studs."
4.0,Theses are very pretty.
4.0,Order UP!  The Women’s medium are very tight on my 6th grade daughter.  The style is great and I love that they are longer than most shorts that we can find.
4.0,"It's a very cute hat. Mine was not very well put together and I had to fix some threads, but for the price I'll deal with it. Didn't feel like returning it. A friend of mine bought the same hat (different color), and it also look very good on her."
4.0,"I liked the workmanship, just not on my hand, so I returned it. It still is a very nice, well made ring."
4.0,Not a bad skirt but definitely needs to be ironed and the color is not accurately depicted. The gray is quite strange and doesn’t match very much.
4.0,This is a tee...not a sweater
4.0,"I get compliments every time I wear this. Can be paired with jeans, or dress it up with a black skirt!"
4.0,"I have to say that I bought this wallet exclusively for the RFID blocking feature, but was pleasantly surprised when I saw the wallet, it looks amazing very high quality, it's well presented on a very nice case; the presentation is perfect if you buy this as a gift to have it deliver directly to that person, they will love it.<br /><br />The wallet is extra roomy, tons of space and more than enough card slots, I also like the ID flop; I don't have to remove my drivers license anymore to should ID, the flop is visible on both side so you can carry two different ID forms in one slot. The card slots are also roomy and I am able to fit 2-3 cards in one slot, and it's secure but loose enough were I don't struggle to remove my cards when needed.<br /><br />The material looks great, looks and feels like real leather, but only the test of time will speak on its durability.<br /><br />The only con, I would point out is that I expected the wallet to be less bulky and a lot slimmer, than it actually is, it's more in the big side. I when I wear dress pants, the big square shape on my back pocket is clearly noticeable from a far, there is no way to hide it. (But something gotta give, either lots of space or a smaller/ slimmer more discreet wallet; depends on your preference)<br /><br />I would recommend this wallet for guys that need a more spacious wallet with lots of card slots.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount or free, in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion about this product.

4.0,I paid $80/pair for a pair of clip-on sun galsses which were customised for my regular eye glasses. I broked two of them within a year. Finally I got these ones. They are cheap and good quality. I enjoy them.
4.0,These shoes are adorable.  The fact that the ankle strap can't be tightened stopped me from giving this product five stars.  I've been stopped in the street by strangers several times complimenting me on these shoes.  A lady can't feel bad while wearing red shoes!! (I bought these in black too)
4.0,"These are nice! They are lightweight and my hubby loves them. He wear a 44 but i got the 5x, they were perfect!"
4.0,Love the fit and style.  Very comfortable and easy to care for.
4.0,"I usually wear a size 9.5-10 and I ordered a 10 and they fit great.  My plan was to wear them around the house a little for a few days to break them in, but they felt very comfortable as soon as I put them on, so I've just been wearing them everywhere.<br /><br />The arch support could be better.  I'm planning to try adding inserts.  I think I should have enough room to add a thin orthotic without causing fit problems, especially since I would have additional room if I loosen the laces some.<br /><br />I can use the zipper without needing to touch the laces, which is nice.<br /><br />The overall quality is good and matches what I'd expect from boots in this price range."
4.0,The color is pretty but is a little bit small
4.0,This is definitely the prettiest viser I have ever owned and blocked out the sun just fine .the only critical thing I have to say about it is when I hand washed it the material in the front came a little undone.
4.0,It is a little smaller of what i expect
4.0,Great quality but too big! Order a side smaller!
4.0,Fits very nice and is stretchy material
4.0,"i thought this skirt would be clingy since that was what i was most worried about, but the fabric is actually really nice without being too flowy or too stiff. its got some visible stitching in the front, which isn't a problem for me but is worth noting. definitely reccomend!"
4.0,Very soft and comfy - doesn't pull or create little fabric balls - the elastic waist is a little snug until you wear them for awhile but I guess that's to be expected when it's OSFA. They also slide down a bit after awhile and you have to jack them back up.
4.0,This was for my 16 year old son and he tells me that they are a good pear of earring and has been wearing them since the day they showed up. They look good and the lock work great.
4.0,"I love thsee leggngs. I already owned 3 pairs. But I give 4 stars. Because I ordered my 4th one in striped twice but they kept me sending them in plaid. I gave up. I hope they fix it. Anyway, I love their products."
4.0,Runs small on chest area and waist
4.0,"Quality is OK, not great but OK. Dress run very small, I usually wear medium and the XL fitted perfectly. I use it for the beach over the swimsuit and is perfect for that. Fabric is a little see-trough.<br />Disclaimer: I received the product with a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. Since I received the product at a discount I do not cover value for your money in the reviews. Nevertheless, I choose the products I review based on my Personal and Family needs."
4.0,Like this sweatshirt
4.0,"I ordered this belt without exact measurements.<br />The belt is too small, but awesome to look at.<br /><br />Great product. Hopefully when I get an extra $20 I can order another one in the right size.<br /><br />Bucky wilson<br />[...]"
4.0,"The metal tarnishes after about a month or two of wear, and the crystals begin falling out very quickly. While not exactly hard to buy new crystals and seal them back in, whatever glue had been used was particularly cheap. Nonetheless, it was very well done in terms of the actual design."
4.0,"These shoes are very lightweight, vibrant and overall look sleek and sophisticated. They don't sound very sophisticated though- every step I take can be heard echoing though my office building. The pointed toe box is not comfortable either."
4.0,It works in Minnesota in January.
4.0,"It’s a very nice top, I ordered a XXL , snug fit."
4.0,wanted a different collard
4.0,Very nice mask. Strongly made and not a cheep plastic mask.
4.0,"I ordered 2 of these and both color look great.  My passport is a bit tight going in, but I think that will ease some with use.  It's certainly not going to fall out.  Other compartments are great.  I would recommend this."
4.0,Strap was broken but I was able to fix it. I sized up only because I wanted it to be longer and it was fine
4.0,"Really nice, pushes my small B size boobs to have a cleavage. Really sticky wont slip down easily, would size up tho."
4.0,Took a while for me to get them but I love them.
4.0,Nice solid crystal. Good chord. Tied well. The only issue I have with it is that the crystal is tied in a little crooked so it sits on an angle. There's nothing wrong with that it just bothers me that it isn't straight. Otherwise fine crystal I think it's real. I don't feel very connected with it but it's from amazon so idk what else to expect
4.0,"Love them. The filter on glasses could be a bit crisper, but these are great and stylish for the price"
4.0,"I was given a pocket angel and have given it as a gift.  The recipient was very touched by the gift and its intent.<br />I liked the plastic envelope and card attached to the stone.  My only reservation is the white label placed on the plastic<br />envelope, was hard to remove and remained tacky.  It is helpful to keep the stone in the plastic bag and in your purse or pocket.<br />but not with the sticky area!.<br />Otherwise, very pleased with 4+ stars."
4.0,The inseem is long.
4.0,"I'm 5ft 9in, size 24W-26W, exaggerated hourglass shape with a big booty, so I ordered the 4x. I wanted something comfy but not so baggy that I couldn't wear them out of the house. Size is perfect and long enough, even after washing and drying. At my height, sometimes I'm stuck between regular and tall, but these are just right -- they touch the floor behind my heels in bare feet, so they'd be fine with sneakers too. Pockets are well-made and big enough for a phone. Material is much thicker than yoga pants, but not quite as heavy as traditional sweatpants.The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is that the drawstring frayed a little at the ends after one wash -- you may want to seal the ends with glue or heat, but it's also plenty long enough to trim several times. I like them a lot."
4.0,I love this shop. They always have the latest styles and I have never been dissappointed. This sweater is lightweight and fits as expected. Only negative is the material is acrylic and should be hand washed. Washed it on the hand wash cycle on my machine and I came fine...but lay flat to dry
4.0,"Good quality skirt. I am usually a small but sized up to a medium after reading the reviews. Medium was far too big so I'm exchanging it for a small, hopefully this one will fit better."
4.0,"I’d say the L is 6/8 and the XL 8/10 for waist and chest. If you are >36C then I’d go with the XL. I do think the max size offered of XL is going to top out at a 10. Both seem broad enough in the shoulder for a L/10 or XL/12 approximate. Apron runs about a size or even two smaller. Had to really rig it just right to get it to fit. Once all assembled, it was quite cute (and not risqué) for Alice in Wonderland Halloween costume.  There is a slip of tulle underneath but it doesn’t do much. I happened to have a petticoat from another costume and that really makes this especially fun and whimsical. Aside from sizing being odd/off, this costume is a good $25 purchase/value. White tights and black shoes and you’re set."
4.0,This is actually pretty much what is pictured. I ordered a large due to all of the reviews that say it runs small. It is very very long on me. Much longer than it fits model in photo. Other that that i like it.
4.0,Esta bonito solo q muy largo la parte larga lo esperaba más corto
4.0,"Does what it's advertised to do, but uncomfortable and wayyyy overpriced. It should be sub $100 for the features it offers. Would I buy it again, yes, but only because there is no other similar product out there and I am a very heavy sleeper."
4.0,I love being able to have my readers ready when I need to read something!  Good product!
4.0,"I love this cover up! It isn't a color I would ordinarily choose but I actually like it alot. I also didn't initially realize there were the white stripes on the back and sides, which add a sportier flare.<br /><br />I typically wear a 10/12 or L and I actually got a M since it was described as oversized and this fits perfect. It isn't tight across the chest at all or at the armpits. I'm glad I got a M, I would likely be swimming in a L!<br /><br />There is lining underneath until above the knees then the orange semi-sheer is full length. I love the length instead of a typical short cover up. Definitely will be using!"
4.0,"Missed a star because the new Hi Tec sizes are labelled exactly one size small for US men<br />I wear US size 13 and ordered 14.<br /><br />Guess what?<br /><br />The labelled US Size 14 in these is actually  EU 47. EU 47 is size 13. Perfect fit<br /><br />I initially bought US 13s and ended up giving them to my son who wears size 12.<br /><br />That being understood the boot's rolling gait system is great.<br /><br />I even bought a low top version  (also in 14 size) to take to England.  Walked the Yorkshire Dales, Lake District, Whitby, and London with ease.<br />Bonus - Bowled 2 strikes in a row in Leeds at a cousin's birthday celebration."
4.0,"I have a very narrow foot, so I had to put pads in them."
4.0,"price is good. she wears it all the time, she not be worn in water, but she does it anyway. it will turn , but was not expensive"
4.0,Great for the priec
4.0,"I love this shirt and especially for the price.  After reading the reviews, I decided to size up and I’m glad I did because the arms are tight.  I typically wear a medium and ordered a large; for reference I am 5’6” 145 with an athletic build.  I may bring in the body a little as that seems true to size.  All in all I’d recommend the shirt; I get tons of compliments on it."
4.0,It's a gift of course. I think my daughter will love. Lots of compartments to keep you organized.
4.0,The charm is about the size of a quarter and looks a little bigger and less subtle than I had imagined. Otherwise no complaints.
4.0,Not as flexible as some but nice quality. Good price.
4.0,"Size L. Wife is 5 feet, 140 lbs. and 38DD.  She says it fits good, but is &#34;too sexy.&#34; Huh?  Looked fine to me!. I think it is because of the halter style, shows a bit more cleavage than she would like. I would have ordinarily got a Medium for her, but after reading the reviews, went with Large.  Fit was good."
4.0,Really good quality but cup was super small. For get about it if you are cup c and above. Chinese sizes.
4.0,"Definitely a good product, but the pouch was too small for me.<br />I ordered the medium; the rest of the item fits me perfectly."
4.0,"I really like this purse holder, the only reason it didn't get a 5 star is that it doesn't stay in it's circle when not in use.  Then again, it does come with a little purse/pouch to put it in.  It's pretty!!"
4.0,I shouldnt wear these kind of 5hings because I'm always doing something with water. I've already ruined mine. But it was very pretty. Will order one again in the future
4.0,"Good value with the rings. Nothing fancy, but they work as advertised. Size fitting exactly as advertised."
4.0,I wanted this for my husband who hates bulky scarves.  He loves how versatile it is.  Plus it makes him look like Yandel in the Moviendo Caderas video.
4.0,economically does exactly what its meant to. great for using under helmets for cold weatther sports. wash before using because flame retardant his disagreable chemical smell
4.0,Looks just as shown in photo. I would've gone smaller in size.  Great with a pair of jeans or slacks.
4.0,This is a comfortable shirt & the length is nice. It’s a little baggy so not the most flattering fit but maybe if I’d sized down it would have fit better? Overall a nice shirt tho.
4.0,"Exactly what I was looking for!  Beautiful, clear picture with festive colors.  People will look at me and see happiness - not a mask.<br /><br />Well-made.  Sturdy construction will withstand washing.  It has already been washed three times and the colors are still vibrant.<br /><br />Adjustable ear-loops help to ensure comfort throughout the day.  Nose and chin darts ensure a comfortable air pocket in front of your face.  No sucking material!  I use this with a bracket for extra comfort.  The mask is large enough to cover the entire bracket.<br /><br />The two shortcomings I have found are that the chin is not quite as snug as I would like to be comfortable that my breath is not escaping my mask; and, it is not one-size-fits-all.  It fits me, but not my husband.<br /><br />I am hopeful that this is the only Christmas when wearing a mask will be necessary.  But since I do have to wear one, I am happy to have something festive to help me spread some cheer.<br /><br />I am considering buying additional designs and I would definitely recommend this product to others."
4.0,"Daughter hated it, but it appears well made."
4.0,"Great for the price, a little too heavy."
4.0,I had to replace the zipper.
4.0,"The only downside is that the beads get caught in the mesh and snags. Otherwise, great dress."
4.0,Runs a little small. I wear a size 12 shoe and that are a little small. They still fit but they are tight. Otherwise they are excellent!
4.0,No le sirve el size a mi esposa
4.0,They are pretty earrings.
4.0,"I like everything about it, except one thing: I have very slim arms, and the bracelet doesn't tie tight enough around my arm. As a result, it is loose and that get somewhat annoying."
4.0,"A little smaller than I prefer, but otherwise I love it"
4.0,Cute Nice blue
4.0,Didnt realize it had a football on it too. My husband only likes the Pens... but hes ok with the shirt.
4.0,Everything was fine.  Thanks<br />Wish it had a pocket...
4.0,"These are NOT compression at all. They are kind of see through as well. I cover them up with a thicker tank top when I am at the gym. For the price, I would say these are a good buy."
4.0,My 11 yr. old granddaughter loved it!
4.0,"the item was what I expected, nothing wrong at all.  I got a size large as suggested because I have a wide foot.  I couldn't get my toes in let alone my foot.  if they had a wide size I would by the slipper again.  I actually returned this item."
4.0,The magnification on this item is fantastic. You can really see the detail of a specimine clearly and without any problem.
4.0,They fit perfectly. Soft and comfortable
4.0,Looks very rich and presents well. The value appears to be much much more than the cost.
4.0,They are hard to clasp but after u get it they are the perfect size!
4.0,"I don’t have a Buick but it does hold my Honda Fob well, as well as 4 keys in case, two keys out side. NO problem with the electronic reader finding a single, and it helps me find my keys right away. In pants pocket a little bulky but if I ware a jacket or sportcoat it works well."
4.0,Fits perfect and it can be use for other occasions.
4.0,Would've been perfect except was too long for me. Measure before you buy!
4.0,Is see through. Unlike what everyone writes. Got my normal size and is very comfortable.Fits like a glove but had to return because of show of my undies.
4.0,"The Matty Collector version will probably always be the best version of the PKE meter but this one isn't too bad considering the price. The lights and motorized wings work well. I just wish it didn't have that constant, noisy background sound going on. Makes it sound cheap."
4.0,I suggest getting a half size to a size larger than needed. I bought a half size larger for my son and the shoes were still snug.
4.0,Watch is attractive and useful but needs instructions for setting. I got the time set but the date won't set. The band fit my wrist and the magnetic clasp works really well.
4.0,"These shorts are nice and fit my husband perfectly, he normally wears a large and the large fit true to size. They are a bit wrinkled and light which is to be expected with linen clothing. But these are great for summer/vacation."
4.0,"This dress is great. I love that you tie the shoulders so it really can fit up top just how you need it too. It’s a very loose dress, but in a comfortable flowy way. It would be flattering on many body types."
4.0,Colors are enhanced in advertising picture.
4.0,I use these as work shirts. I prefer these over cotton shirts when working outdoors. They are comfortable with some stretch and dry quickly. They definitely run large but i did have one shirt from this brand that was smaller than the rest
4.0,These are extremely comfortable bras! The only real gripe I have is that the straps in the back seem to be spread wider then I am used to. I thought I would get used to it over time but I haven't so they tend to slip off my shoulders a bit- even so I'd still buy them again for the comfort.
4.0,"somewhat accptable for the price,but you get what you pay for"
4.0,"Fits very well. I really like this dress, it's streches and had a nice feel."
4.0,"I love this top; it's lightweight, comfortable, and flattering, and it goes so well with everything from jeans to the cutest summer skirts...it's constructed from a silky material that drapes beautifully, resulting in a stylish, figure-enhancing effect. Does a fabulous job of concealing flaws. My only reservation is that it's almost (though not quite) sheer...something that's easily addressed by pairing it with a camisole or tank. Great!!<br /><br />I received this product at discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"Fine boot, well made with lots of toe room. However, said in the discription that the boot was steel toe but it is not. Need steel toe for work so I had to return them."
4.0,Looks good. Well made.
4.0,Super comfortable. High gloss is easy to maintain. My only gripe is that it isn’t waterproof.
4.0,"I've had this for a couple weeks and it's great. My only thing, I seem to remember that the illumination would light the whole face of the clock very clearly when I used to have these as a kid. This one seems to light about half of the screen very well, but you can make out the right side of the screen just enough. Otherwise, I really like this watch. And I will likely buy another one in the near future."
4.0,"Good to wear all day at home. Not too tight, maybe I chose the wrong size. The leg part sits a little low on my leg, again, maybe I chose the wrong size. But if I put it higher it feels ok and it does it's job."
4.0,"These are really really nice sunglasses for what you pay, the design is oh so slightly off on them but nothing you would totally notice. My first pair came with a scratch and I contacted the seller and they sent me a brand new pair fast shipping with no other questions. New pair received today and they are spotless! Really great customer service and I would definitely recommend these to my friends :)"
4.0,Very pretty top fits very small in the arms
4.0,Watch looks even better in person than I expected. My only issues are that it was difficult to remove the links. Definitely would buy again.
4.0,This was a gift and no receipt or card indicating who the gift was from. He said it was soft.
4.0,I need the product
4.0,"Beautiful, but smaller than I was expecting.  However, they did say &#34;stud&#34; in the description. I ordered on 9/3, they shipped on 9/4 and I received on 9/5. They had a lot of beautiful pieces; I'll definitely be ordering more."
4.0,I love this necklace. Simple and classic. Worth it. I wore it to my Husbands funeral and received many compliments. I haven’t taken it off since the funeral a month ago with no problems
4.0,"these glasses are great, but they are a tad bit bigger than anticipated"
4.0,Nice quality. Had to send back and exchange for a bigger size. Not TTS
4.0,Just fit a little smaller than I thought it would
4.0,"This suit has underwire, it fits, but sometimes it raises up and you have to keep adjusting it.  I have only worn it one time.  The shorts ride up just a little after getting wet.  Overall, I like it."
4.0,The colors are not as appealing in person as they are in the pictures online...but they still look good.<br />And some of the earings were very hard to twist apart the first time but they seem to get easier the more you use them.
4.0,I didn't  like the color it was mustard yellow so I returned it.
4.0,Thinner and shorter than expected.  Although not see thru I have found it flimsy.  I am in a wheelchair and it covers my lap when sitting. I use a blanket to cover also so no one can see my side or front bits.  It sounds like I don’t like it but I really do and have ordered it in another color.
4.0,Looks great and he said the fit feels good.
4.0,La tela no me gusto mucho pero el color me encanta y ademas me queda comodo holgado.
4.0,"Trachten makes a beautiful Dirndl that I would be happy to wear amongst my German friends. The embroidery is well done and the seams are sturdy, as is the material. It comes in three pieces that fit well together, and the outfit is comfortable to wear. I have not tried to dry clean it yet.<br /><br />The only thing I wish was a little better is the zipper - it does not come completely to the top in front, and there is a rubber flower hanging off of it, which detracts slightly from the overall quality feel of the dirndl. I suppose I could cut it off, but then I feel as if there would be more attention drawn to the black zipper in the middle of the closure at the bust.<br /><br />I would suggest if possible that you do follow the measurement guide and use that to decide on size, as the fit of the pieces together makes a difference in how it looks. I ordered a little bigger than I usually wear (as suggested by another reviewer), and it does look a bit larger in front due to this.<br /><br />Overall, very happy with the purchase."
4.0,"So my first order got lost, so I contacted the company. They were GREAT about it. They sent a new one to my new address with no hassle! The top itself is VERY cute, a little different from the picture but still very cute! The material is thin, but I like the layered look anyways. I would buy from them again."
4.0,"I think these will work very well when it cools off just a little bit. Even as light weight as they are, they are too hot for our near 100° weather. Shared with both my daughters, and they really like them too."
4.0,"Surprisingly very comfortable. I plan to order more perhaps one size larger to sleep in, that's just a personal choice."
4.0,Perfect for tournament season and arrived promptly
4.0,"Soft fabric,  Just as pictured.<br />UPDATE:  April 2018 - A THE LACE FABRIC IS SHREDDING BADLYt.  Too bad cuz its pretty and has a nice feel."
4.0,"These were for my five year old granddaughter.  She loves her boots!  She had pink ones before. These do crack some after a year but that's to be expected.  They were just a little big, but we kept them cause kids grow too fast."
4.0,"Second bracelet like this. First had rust with snaps around 8 months. This has different metal so have hopes for longer wear. Fits well, looks nice. Words stamped on and not different colors. Also band much lighter than picture"
4.0,"I can't complain for the price.  It fits my Seiko SRN045P2 for a fraction of the price I would have had to pay for a Seiko equivalent.<br /><br />I'm knocking it two stars because:<br />1. It was dirty.  There was this black grease scattered throughout the band near the pins, though it was easily cleanable.<br />2. Lack of attention to detail.  If you look at one of the photos below, you'll notice that one of the pins jut out because it's too long.<br /><br />But I'm giving it a star back because:<br />1. Included a watch spring bar tool to remove the spring bars.<br />2. Included two spring bars.<br /><br />The above would have cost me an extra $10 or so had they not been included.  This band is a good bang for the buck."
4.0,Amazing deal and just like described
4.0,Nice hoody. Wore all winter and was plenty warm.
4.0,"very light, it withstood the first trip. Unsure if it will last. Better that the original version"
4.0,"I love this sweater! It’s soft, fits nicely, and has a feminine look. The price is right too! The only thing I wish is that it had buttons instead of eyes and hooks. The hooks get caught on other areas of the sweater or other things. Regardless, I would recommend it."
4.0,"I purchased these for my son to play baseball.  The frames are so durable that my son was hit right above the eye by a baseball and they did not break!  He ended up with stitches from the frames cutting him, but the glasses protected his head.  The lenses could be more durable tho.  They have a few scratches, but look good overall."
4.0,Order one size up but with regard to the design it’s good and the fitting is good if you get the right size. The fabric is soft. Nice. I like it
4.0,Surprisingly perfect fit. I loved it so much that I reordered it in other colors.
4.0,Soft cotton material shirt. Comfy to wear.
4.0,These are larger frame than I thought they would be but I will still use them. They raise and lower well. Over all product at this time is good.
4.0,Nice dress. It just did not look good on me.
4.0,The magnet is very strong so holds all day however it is definitely noticeable that it’s a magnet and not a real septum piercing due to the stiffness when on. It doesn’t lie naturally.
4.0,"I thought I was getting a dress with a thicker material, but my fault for not reading what material it is. It was almost a shiny material. Fit was accurate and it was still cute. Just be sure you know it’s much thinner and definitely hugs your body."
4.0,This is good price for the product value. It has fancy look and i love it. It look so beautiful on me.
4.0,Good bag...I thought it was bigger but overall good purchase.
4.0,"I really like this for the money. There's only ONE negative: the pants are slightly see-through. This means, either wear white long johns under them, or else everyone will see your leg and other outlines."
4.0,I liked the fact that it had a place to put your paper money into and I disliked the most the fact that it did not have an change purse area
4.0,"IT'S FITS FINE, JUST LOVE HOODED SWEATSHIRTS"
4.0,The color is darker than I thought.  Other than that it’s fine.
4.0,"I bought these as an alternative to expensive frames at my local optical boutique.  They are cute, comfortable and above all, very affordable.  Unfortunately I never really got to use them - as I took them in to the opticians to fill my prescription and they LOST them.  Never found them.  They ended up letting me pick any frames in the store for free - so I ended up with $400 Tory Burch frames for the cost of these Cavalli ones.  I guess it all worked out in the end."
4.0,"I like my bike cover, but I still have trouble getting it on right.  The problem may be that it is due to my bike being a &#34;Revive&#34; bike and is not standard in shape."
4.0,Nicer than expected...cold-shoulder style was a surprise.
4.0,Pretty shoes.  Fits well. Pairs well with skinny jeans or dress/skirt
4.0,"Came earlier than estimated, perfect gift for Christmas, chain is kinda short , but easy to replace"
4.0,It’s a little bigger than I thought. But it does hold all my things with room left over.
4.0,"Great scarf, nice colors, more for style than keeping warm. 4/5 stars because why is it a &#34;womens&#34; scarf?"
4.0,"My daughter wears a 9 toddler shoe & the 9/10 is a little small. Will be ok for the next month, but probably not much longer. Beautiful... My 4 y/o loves them!"
4.0,I have purchased these before I like them but did get a cut on the top of my foot breaking them in.
4.0,The product wig length is a little shorter than what it is in the picture. But overall it's a wonderful wig!
4.0,"These lenses were ok for the price I paid, and they fit my Oakley’s frames pretty well."
4.0,Gave to daughter. Wasn't my favorite.
4.0,"I ordered the XXL because I knew that the pants would run small, and it was still too small."
4.0,I bought 3 megir watches and they look great. Got alot of compliments.
4.0,"Comfortable and lightweight, but a little snug."
4.0,I really like the color of these leggings. Super soft and comfortable. Just very long !
4.0,They fit good; however they’re a little clunkier than I like.
4.0,A little small. Fake lether. Pretty. And fragile zippers
4.0,This is a very thick watch strap. I purchased the gray with blue stitching 22mm. I put it on my Asus Zen Watch 2 and it looks amazing. I also tried it on my GS3 frontier and it was a tight fit. I do recommend this watch strap for both. Just keep in mind that if you are going to put it on the Gear frontier it will be some work.
4.0,Love this hat! Been getting a lot of compliments on it at work.
4.0,Little shorter on then the picture. Great material though! Super soft and stretchy!
4.0,It's a newer designed stick bra. I'll use it for wearing evening dress that can show the bra strips.
4.0,I bought this for my 13 year old son and he loves it.
4.0,Great shirt for work. Love that it doesn't have a front pocket. Color is still bright after many washings. Very soft cotton. Medium weight shirt. A little pricey that's why it's 4 stars.
4.0,Bought for my Father.  Great quality.  Does not fit Dress Pants. I should have checked the width of the belt loops before purchasing the belt.  Works great for casual pants.
4.0,"This dress is really pretty in person.  I am 5'7&#34; curvy and it was way to short.  It came between my calf and ankle. So if your tall, this is not the dress for you.  The pattern is really pretty.  Little tight across the shoulders.  Material feels really nice and nice packaging too."
4.0,"I got a lot of compliments with this outfit, but it is really more of a Tunic than a dress. its verrrry short and I'm 5'4. However, it is very warm. I wore leggings under it and didn't need a coat"
4.0,"I received this dress yesterday.  The quality of the fabric is really nice and soft.  But, unfortunately, I ordered the wrong size and its too short.  I am 5'5&#34; and 110 pounds.  The S was sold out so I tried the XS, which was just above my ankle and didnt fit properly.  I think the Small would fit perfect just for sizing purposes.  Hope this information helps.  Otherwise, it is a nice quality dress as pictured/described!"
4.0,Sizes are uneasy to learn
4.0,Amazing sweatshirt. Runs small; we had to order a second size.but perfect dr robotnik costume!
4.0,"Good shoes, very comfortable but I am sure if I wore them for an extended period of time, the toe strap wold rub and cause blisters."
4.0,"I love this shirt, I do wish it was a little longer though!"
4.0,"They are nice, but more variety is needed"
4.0,"These are good-looking sunglasses.  They have basic styling that goes with anything you wear or most activities.  I'm getting up there in years and glare really bothers me much more than it used to.  I like to take these along while I do my daily walkabouts.  Plus, when I stop for a cup of coffee and read a bit they are so helpful in letting me see the pages without squinting.  I think that at the affordable price point they're offered at you can't go wrong.  Plus, they carry a guarantee against breakage or loss - win/win"
4.0,"My daughter loves these little stick on earrings. She likes choosing what she wants to wear. They stick pretty well as long as she leaves them alone. Mine had $5.99 on the back even though I paid more for them, similar to other posters. I guess you pay a premium to not have to look for them."
4.0,"The dress fit a little bigger than expected but was comfortable for the whole 2 hours I was able to wear it. Sadly, I got 2 feet from a bbq and the dress sizzled.  May purchase again in the future."
4.0,"I have a large head, 7 3/4, and it fit fine.  Material is a little thin, but it works"
4.0,"Upon receipt, there were long fibers that stuck out of the seams. Once I pulled those out, everything was fine. The fabric is a little thin, so you'll need an undershirt."
4.0,"Great quality, fit is true to size"
4.0,"I ordered the orange color which is really nice burnt orange coral color. The downside to this handbag is it came in 6x8 inch box and was a challenge to unfold it and unzip the zipper. The other real downside is the so-called extra shoulder bag strap that was included is only a 1/4 inch wide and does NOT have any way to attach it to the bag as they did not put any hardware on the strap, its unfinished and useless piece of very low-quality material. I did however order a separate guitar strap to attach to this bag and change up the look, I'm glad I did because it's the only crossbody strap I now have for this bag. I'm keeping the bag, but would not order from this company again because of the strap issue and the way it was shipped it will take a while to get it to hold its shape. Quality control is very lacking with this company.!"
4.0,It was a bit longer than expected but it looked just like the picture.
4.0,"We are pleased as punch for material, designs, and price. However they run a little big. We usually wear a size 8 and followed other reviews about sizing up but apparently we will have to grow into now. Gotta wait another year maybe because it's too loose in crotch and butt areas to cover. :("
4.0,"Looks okay in normal light, can tell it's &#34;knife shaped&#34; in failing light but loses all the detail. Would liked to have seen it be a bit more rigid."
4.0,It is a fine band. But was advised as more brilliant than the actual color that arrived. I ordered the blue. There are reviews with pictures that due it better justice and I wish I had looked at them first.
4.0,"I got this sweater vest for my daughter who likes the vest and button down shirt look. I thought it would make her look older, but she pulls it off. This vest isn't giving her the oversized fit that she's usually wearing nowadays, but she still likes it. I don't see anything special about it but it'sa good basic piece, so if you're looking for a basic sweater vest for your wardrobe... here it is."
4.0,It's not form fitting it just kinda goes straight down and the material is like scratchy. The sleeves are 3/4 not long unless I got one that was defunct or something. It still looked really good on though so I deal with the discomfort lol
4.0,"So, this is a great jacket. It looks nice. It's warm. The only problem is it runs really small in size. I'm normally a size large. I ordered a size XL so it would be a little loose. It is too small. I can just barely zip it up."
4.0,"This is a very large, useful beach bag.  It is quite large though-- not something you'd want to carry around town.  But it was perfect for our beach vacation with two young children!"
4.0,I love the bright colors and straps. You cannot beat the price. The hard top does scuff easily.
4.0,I have a size small and it fits well!
4.0,This is a really cute product and my significant other loved it. It was Part I of a Valentine's Day gift for him. The chain with the key fit around his head which was good but the chain for the heart was very short and I felt like I was choking a bit so it forced me to buy another chain in order to wear it.
4.0,"These were a bit bigger gauge than I was expecting. I received 5 clear, 6 light pink, 5 hot pink, 1 red, 1 green, 1 turquoise, and 1 dark blue. A bigger variation in colors would have been nice but I'm happy overall."
4.0,I was very happy with the quality of the fabric of the swimsuit
4.0,Not bad for 24 bucks. What I'm seeing when looking through the goggles is not entirely what I anticipated to see but it's still a pretty cool effect and the goggles are really well made and come in a nice pouch to store them in. The head strap is adjustable and so is the nosepiece between the lenses. The goggles are very comfortable and I can see myself wearing these for an extended period of time. The Wormhole effect allows you to be able to see where you're going and what you're doing while still giving you the cool effect on the outside of the lenses. I got these as a lightning deal so I'd say money well spent.
4.0,Would have been the perfect pant if I weren’t tall. I’ m 5 ft 8 so they were too short. If you are short they should be perfect.
4.0,"This suit looked super cute, it fit well but is probably not the best cut for a very busty person. I am a 36c."
4.0,I ended up liking this tops more then I anticipated.<br />In cold weather they are a good layering top but in warm weather they do trap sweat some what..I do like that they have some hug since I do not do impact sports the days I can skip the sports bra and just layer for some jiggle control is nice..
4.0,This bracelet is an awesome gift I like the beads but I don't like that it's it runs kind of small so if you're getting it for somebody that has large wrists or large hands they going to be restricted because it's going to feel tight but I think this is a perfect gift for somebody with thin wrists possibly a woman but it's a nice-looking bracelet
4.0,"This is a very cute shirt, and I love the design of it. However, on my relatively small frame, it was way too big. Im still keeping the shirt since I love the design of it, but I have to be mindful on how I wear it because of the length, especially when I'm wearing shorts with it. Also, the collar looks like it was cut off as a part of the design-sort of reminds me of how I used to cut up old tee shirts back in high school, so I'd be careful washing the shirt. I'm not entirely sure if it's worth the $29.99 cost...probably not, but I'm keeping the shirt anyway. I'm 5'2&#34;, 107 pounds with a 24.5 inch waist for reference"
4.0,This set is just beautiful. I bought it for my 5 year old. The size of the earrings is a little big but they are cute and the quality is good. It comes in a nice gift box. I would definitely recommend this set.
4.0,"I am 6'2&#34; and these are a bit short, coming up to my ankles.  I would not be comfortable wearing these with shoes."
4.0,That what great but can you tell me MCM shop near me I need to cut out to long for me
4.0,A bit darker then on pictures
4.0,"Comfortable. Fabric is a little heavier than anticipated. I didn't feel like the boob part fit well at first, but then I looked at the picture and saw that the straps are kind of doubled. That helped tremendously.<br />It would definitely look better on a taller person than on me, but I'm still taking it with me to Jamaica!"
4.0,"The studs/backs fall off so easily… it’s so weird that the butterfly’s are removed from the posts. It makes it incredibly difficult to put on. They’re also bigger than expected, both the butterfly and the post—it basically hangs off my ear. Other than that… good quality and really cute."
4.0,Nice product and fashionable in a larger size. Shorter than expected.
4.0,"I bought this for my 12 y/o daughter.  She is barely a size 0 in womans, but this seems to fit her pretty well.  The medium was the only size available and I'm glad I didn't get a small.  These run small, so get a bigger size than you need."
4.0,Nice hat!  But saw the same at Costco for 1/2 price
4.0,These are for figures much fuller than mine BUT they are super soft. I am a size 2. I have to roll the top over.
4.0,"Very comfortable. Easy to put on wrist after it is on watch.  Putting it on watch is a little difficult.  When you put one side in, the top rotates, so that part you need to get with your nail, to pull down, is hard to get to."
4.0,I am a 36C which apparently doesn't work well with this dress's figure.
4.0,a little slow to ship and a needs to be ironed before it can be worn due to pleats being out of place
4.0,Soft fabric fits as expected
4.0,I love this dress. It is true to size and color. Material is good quality and soft to skin. I bought the navy blue.
4.0,Slightly smaller than should be
4.0,Comfortable. Fits as expected. durable
4.0,"Heavy duty leather.  Appeared relatively well made.  Had difficulty figuring out how to correctly strap it on (and we are pretty intelligent people).  Ultimately, returned because we couldn't make it fit or work well.  Return process went very well."
4.0,"The dress is quite pretty, looks just like the pictures. I did have to return one that was too small and get the next larger size. For my teenage daughter we went up 2 dress sizes."
4.0,"This a very flattering dress suitable for the office or a night out-if we ever return to those things after the pandemic. I love the cut and the shirring is great for anyone who has a tummy bulge problem. The fabric is nicer than I was expecting, and this fits true to size. It is truly one of the nicer items of clothing that I have gotten on Amazon."
4.0,nice looking and comfortable
4.0,"Love the dress, but it doesn’t fit quite the way I expected."
4.0,Bought as a gift. Really liked that it came in a box. They are very thin and adjustable.
4.0,"I got this for my father for Christmas.  After reading the reviews I was a little worried that the product would be defective but it's actually really nice.  The only reason it's 4 stars instead of 5 is that I expected it to be just a little bit bigger.  It's still plenty big enough, but not as expected.  My dad does a lot of shoveling snow in the winter and this will be perfect for him.  Nice and fleecy and warm."
4.0,Nice suit. But cups are huge if you get the plus size suit. if u are under a c and under cup these will be obviously too big.
4.0,Cool pants
4.0,I like  the way it fits
4.0,Fits perfect around head
4.0,It is what was expected.
4.0,fit was good. Sizing is normal.
4.0,Take a medium had to return for xtra large.
4.0,"This is a nice dress, not as nice as I was hoping, but I do like it.  You can dress it up or down and it will work."
4.0,"I bought these for my daughter's 19th birthday. They were a lot smaller than I expected, but these tiny rocks sparkled the way diamond earrings should. The unboxing is a tasteful red pouch with a glittery silver box inside. It was a joy to give these to her."
4.0,"LOVE LOVE LOVE. The only reason this has four stars instead of five is because they are a little wide and I am always pushing them up on my nose. The color, the shape and the shade of these glasses are incredible though and I have been wearing them ever since they arrived. They came in a nice little bag that is great for storage and cleaning."
4.0,"Really loving this brand. My third pair from them. My only complaint on these is that I wish they were a bit more oversized. The size is better for men, I feel. I won this pair in a giveaway! Thank you so much!"
4.0,"I really like how these are screw in backs due to the fact that i lose backs very easily. Really, the only thing wrong with these is that they are advertised as 18g but they are most definitely 16g. So if you dont want to spend a couple minutes pushing these through you ears, dont buy. They are very nice quality. I have very sensitive skin and these worked perfect for me."
4.0,In the boob area for the XL will not fit a DD like other dresses normally would.
4.0,The sweatshirt had beautiful colors and was very well made. My sister will love this.
4.0,"Very cute scarf, nice and lightweight and looks very pretty on."
4.0,Awesome 👍🏼
4.0,I love my slippers but I always wear size 7 and these are M7-8 and they fit more like a 6!  I've been wearing them for a few days and suffered the first couple days from them being too small.  They have gotten stretched a little but still snug so far.  They are not really a true red.  They are the pinkish red like real ruby. I'm ok with that though.
4.0,"Came a few days early and is pretty cool, has a few threads that are popping out but over all it's a good hat"
4.0,I bought one for each of my son’s and they are 15 and loved them. If I had bought it for myself I wouldn’t have been happy. It gets dull very quick even after cleaning it and the metal against your skin turns color very quickly.
4.0,"It is a little flimsy but I dont mind using a tie wrap. That takes very little effort on my part! For the money, it was worth it."
4.0,Gotta be very care not to get it in food. But I have gotten so many compliments.
4.0,Looks good have not got it yet but I will
4.0,Cute top; not a big fan of the material.
4.0,Quick delivery. As described. Works well.
4.0,"Nice band for my Fitbit blaze. I wish it was 1/2"" bigger (it barely fits over my hand!). Still, it's a nice looking band that doesn't cost a lot (just beware if you have big hands & wrists, like me)"
4.0,"After 2 months, the links started to detach. So far, this has happened twice. Other than that, I like it a lot."
4.0,"Beautifull but ichy. TO bad, it flattered my curves. The &#34;glitter&#34; they sow on, it appears to be slightly off the fabric which makes it ichy."
4.0,Pjs color and print was exactly like photos shown. Material was a little thinner than I thought it would be. But the fit was great. I am 5’3” and 130 lbs. I ordered a medium.
4.0,"It fits my face to stay in place but is big. It comes up to my eyes. Looks cute on the model but looks like I just cut a bra in half and put it on my face. I don't use the thing that attaches to put it around my neck, is usually just pull it under my chin and that's comfortable"
4.0,Nice necklace.  Huge.
4.0,This top is worth it. I bought the large based off reviews and sizing. Let me say i am pleased with the purchase. It does have a little stretch so its not too snug or tight on. It's very versatile as you can dress up with pencil skirts or dress down with jeans. I bought mine for church and received a lot of compliments. The white is a little sheer so wear a black or dark coloured bra and you'll be fine
4.0,Super cute and easy to adjust and wear. My 4 year old wears it too and loves it!
4.0,"I ordered the medium (I dance between a small and medium).  I haven't worn it yet, but it fits good, can't wait to wear it."
4.0,"It's was a little bit too big, but I managed to get it."
4.0,Fit a bit snugger than my old bear paw boots but they still fit over all. They are also light weight and warm. Happy with purchase.
4.0,These are very pretty sunglasses - the only thing I can say is I wish the lens were a little darker.  The sun is very strong here in Florida.  I am satisfied with them.
4.0,"I took out the padding right away, I felt like it looked too lumpy but it's a cute sports bra. This bra would definitely show some side boob if you are busty"
4.0,Traveled 8500 miles with this bag and it made it without a single problem
4.0,Wish you could buy the top and bottom sizes separate. The bottoms in XS fit perfectly but the top has a side boob spillage problem. But this suit is absolutely adorable and good quality for the price. Just size up if you are busty.
4.0,So cute. Sadly I am a size 8 and 158 pounds and and XL was skin tight :( if there is a bigger I will order it! Super pretty!
4.0,"I liked this style and I ordered this along with two other styles. It seems a little short in my torso area but not enough for me to return it. I normally wear a size 12-14 and I ordered a Large. Except for the length issue, it fits everywhere else. I am going to keep it since I need several suits for vacation in about 10 days. The material is excellent quality. Very surprising considering the price."
4.0,The pants are not holding shape at the waist very well.
4.0,Super cute. They were very big on my 3 months old though.
4.0,"Shirt and printing is good quality but WOW does this run small!!  Go up 2 sizes, the small is the same as a 3T!  Seller did replace it with no hassle but it would have been easier to just size the shirts correctly.  The cats do look just like the Warrior cats, if you have a Warrior crazy daughter she'll love it.  :)  Now all my daughter's friends want the same shirt for a &#34;Warriors&#34; club at school...lol..."
4.0,"I like that the belt fits and that it is not a thin belt. I prefer thicker belts for my jeans. It is important that you are very gentle with it though, so that the whole marks in the belt do not expand."
4.0,"very good quality and very well made. no pulled out seams, zippers all work very well. over all I am very happy with my purse and the sea foam color is very pretty. a little lighter than the picture but that's to be expected with anything online. great product for a great price!"
4.0,"its fits great, i should recommend to any1."
4.0,"Not bad, made of heavy material almost like a sweat shirt."
4.0,"Super cute, but had to modify the top as waaay too much cleavage was showing."
4.0,Took these on vacation and they did not fail. Plus everything was red!
4.0,"This product looked better in person as compared to the picture. Very beautiful. I used this neck piece for a wedding  therefore I wore it from 1pm to 9pm. What I've noticed is that it changed colour slightly. I'll advise persons who are goin to sweat or wear it for a long period to be mindful and don't wear it often. Besides that, I love it!"
4.0,"I love the fit! I will need a black slip, (my preference) underneath the dress but for $26 I'm satisfied."
4.0,Other than running a bit small they stretch out well
4.0,"Love these slippers! I wear a 6.5/7 and I got a 7. Just a tad big in the heel and maybe after wearing a while the inside pile may mat down. Other than that they are cozy, comfy and warm. Just in time for fall and winter."
4.0,"I love this dress.....I should say I bought a large first (my usual size) but it was SO long when I got it I put it aside for my 5'8&#34; daughter (I'm 5'4&#34;) and reordered a medium. I should also mention I washed the first dress per instructions and machine dried (twice) hoping it would shrink....it didn't.<br />The medium arrived and it fits well but darn it if it's not about 8&#34; too long! Again after washing and drying.<br /><br /> I thought about drying it on medium instead of low, but I'm afraid then it might shrink the other way and not fit at all. I also thought about hemming but the edge is rounded and I'm afraid my seamstress skills are low. So I'm stuck holding the thing up whenever I need to walk. It would be perfect ifI wore 8&#34; heels......but I don't.<br /><br />This dress is beautiful, well made, flows beautifully and feels like a dream but it is VERY long. Fair warning."
4.0,This dress is so beautiful and is elegant is a simple way. Really I was only minorly disapointed ther was no zipper but that is ok because it is still a gorgeous dress
4.0,"Beautiful cuff-links. I like cuff-links and love the blue color so this was hard to pass. The cuff-links come in good packaging and in a nice pouch. The design is good and goes well with anything. It is in a graceful shape to give good look. It is perfect for any event be it wedding or party or to work. The construction of the cuff-links is high quality, looks sturdy and durable. It is simple and comfortable to fasten the cuff-links and no issues wearing them for long times. I have received this product for discounted price or free for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"I like it a lot, though the Godzilla logo inside was sewn in crooked."
4.0,I like it a little pricey
4.0,"La franja blanca llegó con una pequeña mancha roja, parece que es de las mangas del abrigo. Por eso le doy 4 estrellas"
4.0,Ordered a medium and I look like a green trash bag
4.0,"I like the pattern. It’s simple, thin and cool for the heat in Louisiana. Buy the dress."
4.0,"Fit great, fell great, sweet shorts."
4.0,Very nice beach sandals. Attracriive. Do their job for what they were made for.
4.0,"Fits nicely but be aware this is not cotton, and might be a bit warm for very hot days."
4.0,Pretty dress and print. Just a little too snug for me to zip myself.
4.0,Gave these as a gift to my boyfriend and he liked them.  They fit his clubs well.
4.0,Leather bag is of good quality and nice size. Disappointed in interior insert and stitching. Good product for the price.
4.0,"Se siente bien y es ligero tipo licra, muy bueno y fresco, algo ajustado pero no buena."
4.0,I love these just wish they were a little tighter around the ankles.  It felt kind of awkward so I just rolled the bottoms and they look great.  I'm 5'7 125lbs and got a medium.
4.0,"Although the size was correct, it pinched a bit at the side of one foot... This is definitely a shoe for narrow feet..."
4.0,Very nice but thought it was bigger. Still love it.
4.0,I got a size small and it was bigger than ide expected loose wise but over all was as pictured. It did however come with some dirty spots on the back of the dress
4.0,The necklace is fun but cheap and tangles. I have purchased twice due to tarnishing. The first lasted about a year but was one of my favorite necklaces
4.0,"these glasses are really nice if you don't mind spending so much money. They seem a little flimsy for the price, I was expecting something a little studier for the price. Although they still work perfectly."
4.0,Nice suit. Great price. Love the bottoms. I am 5’3 180 lbs. bought the 2x. It is a little big on the bottom. The top is actually pretty supportive. Overall a good product for the price. The blue color is beautiful
4.0,"This item ran true to size. Although it needed a little ironing, it's made pretty decent and is adorable on."
4.0,I have not checked to see my sunglasses float with them on but I like how they look and fit.
4.0,This mask is extremely comfortable but I would recommend putting a filter in it to help protect against COVID. On it's own it's too thin to protect you from anything.
4.0,Well I haven't worn them yet though I've tried them on and when the sun shines it should be good to go. Can't say  now I have a least favorite thing.
4.0,"I ordered the light blue/turquoise dress.  It was just a smidgen too big for me, but I was expecting that, as I fell right between their measurements for a S and M.  Even with it being slightly loose, it's still wearable and looks nice.  The fabric is a bit stretchy, which is helpful also.  The side zipper was a bit weird, it was sewn shut at the top under the arm, so while the zipper opened/gaped in the side, you won't have extra room at the top while putting it on.  I was able to get it on fine, even with this zipper style.<br />While I liked the fit and am pleasantly surprised by the dress being at a slightly higher quality than I was expecting for the price, I will be returning it.  The color wasn't quite was I was hoping it to be. I was expecting more of a blue-ish turquoise, the one that arrived is more of a green-ish turquoise.  Possibly a computer screen difference, but I can't wear greens like that! :)"
4.0,"These are pretty costume earrings where you pretty much get what you expect from the pictures.  Because they are costume jewelry, I don't expect much from them, and they are probably slightly more than I would pay for earrings like this, but they are pretty and fun and seem sturdy.  If you like them in the listing, you will be happy with them when you get them.  They do come in a sturdy box but it's not a typical jewelry box, so you may want to re-package them if you plan on gifting them."
4.0,I bought this about a month ago and it's fits really nice. It gets a titch itchy on the skin after a while if you don't where an undershirt.
4.0,Nice leather. Easy to install.
4.0,I love the design. Just hope it’s real 14k gold.
4.0,They run small but love the material. I wear size 34 and the mediums are super snug.
4.0,This was a gift for granddaughter. She loves it.
4.0,"This Review is for the The GLD Shop 5MM Miami Cuban Choker Necklace 12""-14"" Adjustable Length- Gold. The GLD Shop Miami Cuban Choker Necklace looked great on my young son, it is adjustable length to 12”-14” good for a younger child’s neck, or a small women. My son enjoyed wearing the chain, it is gold plated, and sterling silver, looks very elegant and hip, and very giftable, comes in a zipable pouch for storage, and a well-constructed box. Easy to fasten and unfasten."
4.0,I like the overall fit. The reason for 4 stars is because the sleeves are a little snug.
4.0,"I actually do love the shirt, but I thought it would be an actual sweatshirt as the description states.  It's a polyester-type material with a raw edge at the bottom.  The colors are beautiful and the shirts fits exactly as I thought it would, but it's just not a sweatshirt.  :)"
4.0,"The tights came in about two weeks, and I was pleasantly surprised. They fit wonderfully, sometimes I had to pull them up during the day, but all tights do that. The only major problem was how easily they rip. My nails were a bit too long and I gently scratched at my leg a bit and got several small holes. The tights are still holding up after five wears."
4.0,"This fit and looks much better than I expected for the price! It is just a little short on my, but I have very long legs so that's the norm for me"
4.0,Very well made and looks better in person than the photo. Unfortunately my daughter did not need it so we returned it. I would definitely recommend this bag for quality and size.
4.0,This was a great buy!! I really like this to wear it to work. The sleeves are so pretty.
4.0,"I love the fit. Looks classy. Nice no winkle. Gave it a 4 star, because the gold on the front of the best had a couple of small scratches. Don't think really noticeable, but being brand new it was a disappointment. Going on a trip, so didn't have time to return it."
4.0,Exactly what I was looking for to display my earrings. I like the sturdy clear plastic and the variety of holes and hooks work well for my different types of earrings.
4.0,"Good chain, but was smaller than expected."
4.0,"Great deal.  A little loose, but works like a charm as long as consumers understand it won't hide all the bulges we may have, but provides good support."
4.0,I purchased for my 2 year old. She's 31inches and it fit her well. It wasn't too tight or too loose
4.0,LOVE my new RFID wallet...couldn't be more pleased!  I plan on buying them for Christmas gifts.
4.0,They were really cute but not my favorite.  We did even wear them because they would not stay on our heads
4.0,"Expect them to run about 1mm small. I am a true 38mm. All of my tunnels are 38mm, but these are slightly smaller and have already slipped out in the half hour since I’ve got them. With that said, I LOVE them. I’m hoping if I keep my jewelry out for a day or two my ears will tighten enough to keep them in."
4.0,I love this sweater! This slouchy fit is super comfortable. My only complaint is that the color looks to be more of a mustard than a light brown but I still love it.
4.0,"great deal for the price, very cute and stylish.  DO NOT WEAR IF ALERGIC TO FACE SILVER OR GOLD WILL TURN YOUR EARS BLACK&#62;"
4.0,4 stars only because it Didn’t come with head wrap everyone was talking about a little disappointed but it’s a cute dress pockets are a plus but has a lot of loose strings
4.0,"I love these shoes, I only gave them four stars because of how much the fabric pills."
4.0,"Super cute! I am using them as part of a costume for RunDisney, but my oldest daughter loves them so much, they will be part of her regular collection!"
4.0,"Theyre very well made and obviously higher quality, and while they're looser than most compression shorts I've worn in the past, and they dont hold my cup in the best, they are very comfortable and I expect to buy another pair or two in the not so distant future. I'm a smaller guy, but I also know my clothing size. Take those factors as you will. All in all, definitely 4 stars"
4.0,I usually wear a M so I bought a M however it runs a little on the big size.  Because it is only 25% cotton it did not shrink enough in the dryer to a point that I could wear it.  I will order a S next time.  The shirt is very soft and the gray color is lovely.<br /><br />Update:  I ordered a small and it fits perfectly.  I am 5'2&quot; and 115lbs.  I will be ordering other colors.
4.0,"Received it on time and in good condition .It is very delicate looking and pretty in person , I specially liked the new packing style by Amazon , makes an item look a level up . Unfortunately I had to return it , because I could not fit my driver license in the given slot or in any other slot they were just too narrow."
4.0,"Does not stand very well after a period of use.  I did add an additional two inch elastic band on the cover for an extra hand hold as I like to lie in bed and read before lights out and sometime long after.  The half inch band that is attached as a closure could be a better, firmer quality.  The price is right sod I am still happy."
4.0,These are absolutely adorable - really - but you might want to buy a size up because the pants are short...but really really cute - light weight
4.0,Very Cute..... Looks just like the picture and sturdy
4.0,Great dress. Macy's used to sell this brand but no longer does anymore. I am glad I can get it here.
4.0,Nice for around the house
4.0,Very big in size but still cute!
4.0,"Little hot because so much coverage, but good workhorse bra!"
4.0,"I have babydick wrists and it actually fits well. I purchased the black with white speckles and the paint is starting to wear off, but I've worn mine everyday for three months now so it's kind of expected. I haven't had any technical problems with it so it's definitely worth my $12."
4.0,The costume overall is great except for the mask. Poor visibility and breathability makes you keep it off or replace it.
4.0,Bought this for a 7 yr old. She loved it but when received thought is was larger than pictured & chain was long.
4.0,Used as a charm for a bracelet. It is cute and unique.
4.0,"It runs true to size for probably a six year old that isn’t very thin. I bought it for my daughter who’s turning 5 at the end of the month and it’s extremely large on her. She’s 34 lbs and 42 inches tall. I love the style and color so much that I’m ordering a smaller one. Also, the colors are beautifully bright but the fabric is a bit hard. I’m hoping that when it’s washed it softens up."
4.0,Was a good design and as expected for the price. Would buy again if had to do over.
4.0,it is beautifull!!!
4.0,"Hat is not as bright purple as shown in the picture, which is typical for web pictures. The size is okay -- I still wish different sizes were offered. My one displeasure is that the hat was folded up and packed into a small box, so when it arrived it had a fold mark (almost a crease) right in the front. I am hoping to be able to steam it out.  The crease makes the hat look cheap and tacky."
4.0,I love the material and the dress is nice colors. Just buy one size bigger.
4.0,"When I first opened the package and looked at the WXXM Men's Athletic Breathable Mo Show Socks, I thought that they barely looked like socks at all. They were so small looking. When I put them on they barely cleared my heal. But when I went out for my daily walk I realized that these are very comfortable walking socks. Yes, they may look like “more show” socks, but they are good for exercising. They kept my feet dry as I walked."
4.0,I look forward to getting to wear it when my grandson gets married next June I think it'll be very pretty with my dress it's a very attractive piece of jewelry
4.0,LOVE THEM! Fit is perfect and height is just right.  Well made for the cost.
4.0,i'll have to glue one of the earrings back together.
4.0,"A multi-pack is an awesome idea for getting just the right fit!  I don't know my husband's ring size, so I knew I couldn't go wrong with an option like this.  It's the perfect solution for a guy who needs to safely work with his hands without risk of injury that can come with a metal ring.  He noticed that if he leaves it on 24/7, his finger starts to smell like he's been wearing a band-aid, but that has been easily resolved by removing it at night.  And losing it is basically stress-free compared to something expensive and fancy.  I'll be recommending this to my brother who plays a lot of sports and also works in a job where a traditional ring could be dangerous.  I think the shine might be wearing off now, but that's not a deal-breaker for us."
4.0,Good fit nice material.
4.0,Easy to remove links to adjust size. More white in coloring than rose gold.
4.0,"This watch band fit my Samsung Galaxy watch perfectly.  It looks great, fashionable, not cheesy looking.  It was super easy to install.  I wish the band was a little more durable.  I've had it on my watch for about 2 weeks now, and one of the clasps just started popping open, so if I don't catch it in time, my watch goes flying across the room.  I've tried just taking that link off, but then it's too tight for me.  I don't know if there is an easy fix for it.  Maybe I just got one of the fluke ones.  I haven't looked yet, but if this company sells extra links, it would be worth it to buy a few extra to change the links out when they get too loose.  Overall, I like the band.  I have gotten compliments on it, I think it looks great.  Just beware, or pay attention to those loose clasps."
4.0,"These socks work well as compression socks; however, the stitching failed after only two or three wearings on the two pair that I purchased.  Stitching failed on the sides of the socks where the black upper portion of the foot and ankle are joined to the gray bottom portion.  Holes developed in an identical spot on both inner and outer sides on all four socks.  I was NOT hard on these socks at all -- I wore them during long plane flights so there wasn't any yanking or pulling that might cause a failure.  It appears to be a consistent stitching flaw in the same location.  The socks do stay up without any droop and they definitely reduce fatigue / help with circulation so that's a plus.  I'll darn my two pair and continue to wear them until they fail again, which appears inevitable.  But, overall, this product is a durability disappointment considering the price.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I upgraded this review from two to four stars because the manufacturer voluntarily sent me two pair of replacement socks.  Thank you Wanderlust.  I have two all night flights coming up next week.  I'll let you know how these new socks hold up after a few wearings."
4.0,Awesome rings with good colors. A bit snug.
4.0,So cute! Really like it
4.0,rubbed blisters on my pinky toe. true to size.
4.0,"Costume fit adequately on my 5 yr old. Not a great product, but it did the job and my child was happy with it.<br />She has excema, and clothing tends to itch her, but we wore this over her clothes and it wasn't a problem. Santa hat was too small, but we just picked up one from CVS to complete the outfit."
4.0,Fits as it should. Nice stretch and comfortable.<br />\vote is still out if the material 'pills' gets little knots
4.0,"The color was as shown in the picture. Material was of good quality (compared to the price) and was well made. My only concern is that I ordered a size 4 (which is what i usually buy in store) and it was much larger, size 2 would have been proper fit for me. I read comments below saying it is too small but I think either they are wrongly labeling the sizes as mine was larger than my regular size."
4.0,"I don't usually purchase clothing from amazon because I like to try things on at the store...I was in a pinch and needed to get a light colored dress for my bachelorette party this weeken,so I hopped on Amazon and found this dress. All the comments said it fit true to size and they weren't wrong. I'm 5'1 and 200lbs. LOVED the fit, didn't make me feel pregnant. The only two things I'd like to point out is that this material is SLINKY and very see through at the top, you can definetly see my bra through this dress!"
4.0,These sandals are comfortable but they are a bit clunky in their design.
4.0,"Loved them!! I bought 5 of them, loved the feeling of the fabric, perfect for hot days!  Design is very nice, bright colors and so many to choose from!<br />Would recommend!  I had so many compliments!"
4.0,"These are cute, but they were just slightly too big for me."
4.0,Color was a bit off but nice fit and material!
4.0,Another great bag from this company.
4.0,The description said &#34;asian sizes&#34; so I ordered a medium instead of a small.... could have gotten away with a small - comfy material
4.0,"I really like this necklace, the chain is the perfect size and the tarot card is not thin or flimsey. Overall a nice piece, and i love that its two sided with the constellation on one side."
4.0,Like the know show socks and available colors.
4.0,"These boots were a Christmas gift to my wife - she has nothing but good things to say about her boots and has worn them quite a few times since opening her gift. The only negative about the boots were a few scuffs on the heels, looks a little like a touch up and a small divot, other wise I have not heard anything bad about them."
4.0,Runs very large. I’m 5’8” 160lbs 34DD and the XS fits fine. I typically am a M/L. A small may have worked too but would probably have hung in the armpits a bit. I ordered 5 different colors and all are different lengths. The black is excessively long and the rest hit just below the ankle. Fabric feels different from color to color too. All in all a decent maxi for the price. Size down a few for sure!
4.0,"The frame is metal and strong. Really happy about it. The glass isn't as good as I would like, but for the price, it's well worth it. Would buy again."
4.0,"These really did help my legs feel better, but the elastic hurts at the very top.  Wish they could make a wider top band that ease the tension"
4.0,These glasses are okay. Things are a little wavy looking through them.
4.0,I love the product and works to hold all that I need but compact. The nude arrives more pink than the photo suggest.
4.0,"I love this dress except for the pockets. I wear a 12\14 with 36 DD bust and the large fight perfect. It was very comfortable with plenty of room in the waist and hips too cover those problem areas. My only complaint and the reason I returned it was the placement of the pockets. I'm 5'5"" and the pockets were above my hips. If they had been on my hips, about 3"" lower they would have been perfect."
4.0,"The hooks and eyes are just slightly off from my bras; otherwise, I would have given this product 5 stars. It is a great solution to a bra that is slightly snug."
4.0,They  are thick and warm
4.0,Love this dress. I bought it in two different colors. It’s very thin and lightweight. I’m 5’3 and ordered a small. It fits perfectly but it is a few inches too long. I just knot the bottom and it’s perfect.  You can dress it up or wear it casual.
4.0,I love sterling silver. I purchased 4 pairs of the earrings for 2 of nieces and my friends two younger daughters. There ages range from 11 to 17. One of my nieces could not use the earrings so I kept a pair. They look real and enhance the young ladies' beauty. I would recommend these earrings and purchase them again.
4.0,Ordered for my bestie. The large was too big so I gave it to my man who loves it. Reordered a medium for bestie. The material is ok for the price and image as well.
4.0,Came on time. Super cute but a little large for a size small
4.0,"Love the way this looks on me! The material isn't as soft as I'd hoped, had to wash it a couple times with softener, but still a great deal for the price."
4.0,"They are a little wide and thick, but keep clothes closed and so cute."
4.0,Did the job as promised really cuts down on the sun glare.
4.0,"I got this in the deep blue and it makes a great outfit with other pieces I have. It's soft, perhaps thinner than you might expect, but the various plaid patterns it includes creates a great look. I actually bought this from TrendsBlue, but they don't seem to have the dark blue color at the moment."
4.0,"I ordered these and was happy to have received them but the only problem was that they did not fit my 17 inch calves even though the boot cuffs were yarn there was not enough stretch thus causing them to rip and the yarn to fray.  No fear, I was able to quickly improvise by cutting the loose yarn/string and using a product called &#34;Dritz Fray Check&#34;. to stop the fraying.  This products works just like clear polish when it is used as a quick repair to stop runs in pantyhose.  Otherwise, these are cute in person and I will most definitely wear mine, only wish that they came in larger calf sizes beyond a size 14. NOTE: size 14 inch calf is NOT a wide calf size."
4.0,Works good and doesn't irritate your neck.
4.0,great product good purchase
4.0,"Great for the price, but had some thread unravel after about a day of wear."
4.0,im usually size 4 ordered one size up and it still fits tight otherwise  i like that its knee length and dress pattern is as pictured.
4.0,"I ordered several of these because I really like their thickness, cut and fit. Works well for my work video meetings and also casual enough to wear elsewhere. But the black and white ones are noticeably thinner, and for me the white one got a hole in the side seam after just one wash. So that’s kinda annoying. Overall really like the striped versions tho."
4.0,La calidad siempre acostumbrada de carters
4.0,Used for family pics
4.0,"Great sunglasses for my hour long commute home. They stay in my car, and protect my eyes from the Texas sun. I noticed one pair is kinda sqeaky when I open and close the glasses, but it doesn't me since the glasses were such a great price for such a cute style."
4.0,"This is the beautiful necklace. Obviously, the pearls are not real, but when would they be with the necklace this size?"
4.0,The waist sits a bit high so is not very comfortable. Size as expected. I'm 5'5 and 138lb and M was slightly loose on me but looked fine. Probably would have fit a small though because the waist sits so high (it sits around my lower chest/ribs rather than where my true waist is) a small would likely not be very comfortable.
4.0,These will probably only be used under a skirt with a tighter waistband so that the skirt can hold them up. They seem to ride down often and we have some crack issues... We love the color and the sheen of these pants but the fit just isn't there. They aren't stretchy enough to look like they fit well so any slightly baggy areas crease and look sloppy.
4.0,I ordered a few dresses and this is the one I went with.  I also got many compliments.  My only complaint is that the fitted part of the waist does not stretch and is very hard to get over my chest (and I am only a 34B).  I ordered a Small and the rest fit perfectly.  I am about 5'3&#34; and 135 lbs.  Typically a size S/M.  I haven't washed it so can't say how it holds up with that.  But it was perfect for the business casual black & white dress code I needed it for.
4.0,Little bit heavy so I rate 4 stars but I love this purse after all. The leather is soft and nice. Inexpensive but looks very classy. I think I'm going to purchase their wallet as well.
4.0,It's quite cute! I'm not a rhinestones fan though; I should have looked more closely at the advertisement. I'll probably be regifting this to my 10-year-old cousin for Christmas. It seems more suited to the younger sort (I'm 26).
4.0,"Cute bag, good price. The only complaint I have is that the center zippered space is &#34;floppy&#34; so I feel like I am always have to move it to find what I am looking for in the purse."
4.0,"The material is very soft, but it’s the kind of material that sticks to you. The fit is somewhat small and fits rtight to your body."
4.0,"I ordered the black to go with a black dress. The black is actually a deep navy blue. I had to make it work because I didn’t have time to get a replacement. The description should definitely say navy blue, not black."
4.0,"Purse is very attractive, just a bit small for me to hold my stuff.  Otherwise well made."
4.0,Credit card insert tight as well as license holder and takes a effort to remove otherwise is a very good wallet.
4.0,"For the price, the swimsuit is good. I don't like bathing suit shopping because I get self conscious about how the top will fit (I don't want to look like a 12 year old boy). This bathingsuit has sturdy padding in it and it looks pretty good. The bottoms are very cheeky, so I wouldn't buy this if you were in middle school. Other than that I think it fit well and looks good."
4.0,"I would pick 5 stars but I ordered 5 kids robes and out of the 5 only one had a hook on the inner seam of the neck for hanging the robe.  I don't believe this was one.  I highly recommend buying a robe with a hanging piece, its extremely useful."
4.0,does not look bunched up / scrunched like all cotton.
4.0,I love the design. I wish they had more colors.
4.0,Color and size were as expected.<br />Homer Williamson
4.0,"For their price they get the job done. My only complain is that to remove them from your face, you should lift them up from your head, not out, as the plastic connecting the arms of the glasses may scratch your ears, though this can be corrected with sanding."
4.0,"Beautiful negligee set, but be warned that you have to order a few sizes up.  I usually wear medium in American sizes but ordered extra large based on reviews.  The robe fit ok, but the nightgown was tight with a very small bust area.  Great price, but buyer beware of the sizing."
4.0,"Very thin but nice. fits a little snug. ok shirt but not my favorite. I love this company, Xzavier is a brand I just discovered and I purchased all of their offerings here on Amazon. I wish they had more size choices and designs but I'll take what I get. Their t-shirts are amazing!"
4.0,Not exactly the color in the picture but beautiful and fitting like i wanted it so its good to me.
4.0,Dress is good butt the problem is the slevee for the size are small
4.0,I love the color and material. Doesn't quite lay flat and is a little bulky but still very cute
4.0,Wore this to my baby shower. I got so many compliments. I love that it's an actual wrap dress so I can wear it after I have the baby. I had to wear a bodycon dress under it but I expected that as my belly is huge
4.0,Thicker material so the shirt is not see-through. Looks great with shorts or jeans.
4.0,"I’m 36C, 28 waist. I ordered a large. I really like these tops! The material is soft, stretchy and comfy. I like the fit. The straps are adjustable. They layer nicely. Color is bold. I’d recommend, but I normally wear a small-mediums, so I’d order up a size, because apparently they do run a bit small."
4.0,just a little tight
4.0,Very comfy.  I'd buy again.
4.0,"In general I like it, the color, the size, the lengua... Except that the fabric is not cotton and spandex as describe, it is polyester as main material."
4.0,"Band a bit small, but a beautiful timepiece"
4.0,Don’t size up. It was recommended I size up and they’re too big. If they weren’t too loathe I’d really like them. Hoping they shrink
4.0,"The frames are not super strong, so one has to be careful to not tweak them too much. Other than that, they are very comfortable and I get compliments on them all the time"
4.0,Nice selection of colors. The visors are comfortable and allow for a full range of view. I wore one all day long and you didn't know you had it on.
4.0,The only issue was i am short and tge dress ended up being too long on me. I took ut to a tailor and got it shortened by 4 inches and now it fits as it should.
4.0,I like that it is true to size and the length I was looking for is perfect just over my put
4.0,Great Casual dress. Please purchase an appropriate size as if its too small the pattern will stretch and look distressed. The dress came in a very timely manner and was just as the picture and description described. Great dress for a night clubbing out with the girls
4.0,"I love love loooooovvve the bag, it is so pretty with lots of compartments to store things, it resembles higher brand bags with it is color and design.<br />The only thing I don’t like are the zipper handles, they are plastic not metal and the gold color dose not look great and it looks faded like it was used, so I am afraid that later on with usage it will brake and show a different color. I wish they would fix this issue. If I didn’t really need the bag I would have returned it for replacement, but I couldn’t wait any longer."
4.0,"For the price, these tank tops are fine. They end up costing about 2 bucks each. What can you expect? The selection of colors is great! But the quality is pretty much according to the price. However, I purchased this package of 12 to use over the hot summer months, and knew they would probably not last beyond that in any wearable condition. So for the price and my purposes, they are fine."
4.0,Really nice sturdy fabric that holds its shape well.  I haven't tried to wash it yet but I expect it'll hold up just fine.
4.0,"I love this bag. Wish i had paid attention to the size, The leather is so soft. I can get a lot of stuff in this tote bag."
4.0,"This is a nice suit for the money. Fits true to size and is lined which is nice, but that doesn't make it too hot at all. However, the bra cups aren't sewn in so they can and do move around a little, which is irritating but not a deal breaker."
4.0,Did not like The chain thou
4.0,"I look so cute in them! I've gotten the most adorable compliments, from Hello Kitty to Lisa Frank. I also manage to loose earrings like a fiend, I appreciated the snug backs. They're simple and an adorable bit of color."
4.0,"fits well, but after wearing for couple of hours nose wear elastic crosses nose starts to hurt.  Tried loosening, but then it kept falling down."
4.0,He likes his shirts
4.0,"I love this hat. Because I hate the Astros and wish them each an allergic reaction to their cups. They know what they did.<br /><br />The emblem is not stitched on, though. Looks like a  quick, demand-driven heat transfer, so I don't know how it will hold up when an Astros fan punches me."
4.0,Instead it just inched its way up evey time I sat down. It did what it needed to do and I was grateful for that.
4.0,Very thin and see through and the pic is deceiving but good sundress for the beach nonetheless
4.0,"Decent socks for the price. A few already have holes in them, but my daughter is 2 and hard on stuff"
4.0,The braiding very tight and secure. The clip should be little more sturdy. But good product.
4.0,This toe ring was so cute...but it didn't fit any of my toes so I used it asa thumb ring. I'm satisfied. 😉
4.0,"Very comfy. Just the right size. Very light, I had to get use to that."
4.0,Nice ring sizing is of if you order then order one size larger than you normally wear
4.0,I want another one in a different color. I’m usually hot due to menopause so I like the lightness of this fabric.
4.0,My children love these!  They chose these over every other mask they have because they stay on their faces and they can breathe.
4.0,As aspected it.
4.0,"I prefer longer ties on aprons so it can tie in the front. I bought it for my husband. Once he starts cooking, you will eat..."
4.0,This watch is such a lovely color. It looks exactly as pictured. I was searching for a watch with a pop of color for summer and this one is perfect.
4.0,this product is really good! i apply it and do not need to reapply for about 4-5 days. and it works great with a mask!
4.0,"Originally, i ordered olive, khaki, and grey versions, since slim cargo pants are so hard to find. But only the olive worked for me because each one was a different fit! i returned the other two.<br />i would have liked nylon zippers instead of metal zippers, for smoother and better functionality."
4.0,A little tight at the waist
4.0,nice scarf for the price
4.0,They are very nice just need a stronger backing to support it on the ear.
4.0,Very good for every day wear. My only complaint is how terrible the illumination is. You will not be able to read this watch in low light.
4.0,"I like the shirt aLOT. gave 4 stars only because of the length of it, I am 5' 9&#34; & the 'ends' could be used as a body suit of old. lf you are short, beware.  Or wear as a dress!!  It's so comfortable & even being long I have gotten many great comments!  Also, as in another review, I saw no area to order a shorter version."
4.0,Cute but I'm 5'10 size 10 pants and the large muffin topped me. Will return for something with less carbs.
4.0,"Such a fun design! I wish the lace cape was a little longer. The fabric isn't a great quality, but the price reflects that appropriately. Overall great purchase! The dress was a little bit on me which is fine. I always expect things to be too small."
4.0,Super comfortable and made well. Slightly bigger than expected but all in all a good purchase
4.0,"The blue and the white were very true to color. The others, meh. I can't really tell the difference between them. Good little studs that are just noticeable enough, easy to get in and take out."
4.0,I wear xl but this was a lil loose as if it was xxl
4.0,They were not as long as the first time i ordered them.
4.0,It’s way better than I thought it was going to be setting up was a little hard but it works nice.
4.0,"Im between s/m, I odered M, and put it inside the dryer and it fits me perfectly, sometimes a small is too short for me and when I walk it goes up, but this skirt fits me perfectly"
4.0,My daughter loves them. She love then so much she won't size up lol
4.0,I love these cashmere fingerless gloves.  The four star rating is because they really are not as soft as I’d have hoped for them to be.
4.0,I believe it runs a tad small. But all in all a very nice dress.
4.0,Product finally arrived. Yes it took long but my daughter loves it
4.0,Nice sized bag with a quality look to it.
4.0,I think it is pretty visually but a little bit pricy.
4.0,"First of all, this is a really nice looking shirt.  I did receive it at a discount for honest and unbiased review.<br />As the other reviews seem to say, yes it runs small.  I normally wear an XL and decided to go bigger to be safe and got a 2XL.  It fits pretty well.  It’s a little big in the arms, but my concern is finding clothes that fit over my large bust.  This does.  I love the cutout shoulders.  The crochet lace straps are really cute and comfortable.  I love that this gives a chubbier girl like me the confidence to show a little skin but keep those fat arms under control.<br />Now I did take away a star because I wasn’t as pleased with this as I had hoped to be from the picture.  It looks really nice on the model.  Fits perfect in the shoulders, hangs and flows from the bust and just looks “sexy.”  I could say it’s my own fault because I don’t have that body type, but the fabric is a little bit stiff and doesn’t flow quite the same way.  I do really like this shirt and I like wearing it, but I don’t think that it’s quite a five star experience.  If I could have only taken half a star, I would have."
4.0,"Item was just as described and came on time.  Very happy with that.  However, I kept getting a message- whether from this vendor or Amazon, I'm not for sure and it said my payment was declined.  Twice.  So I put in a different card, it went through and I ended up paying for and receiving two bracelets.  I'll keep the other one for a gift for someone, but I hadn't planned on purchasing two."
4.0,Good pporn
4.0,"needed an overnight/weekend bag to carry not slip over shoulder-this will work out .  One cloitch ...it has a two part snap on either side to make length a little shorter perhaps, anyway, one part is missing--was taped over so whomever packed it knew it was missing...............not returning but it didn't get a 5."
4.0,"Great socks, side and comfortable"
4.0,Love the shirt it's just a little small
4.0,Not the best top I've purchased.<br />Material is thin.  Like cheap thin.  Doesn't look like it will be able to take too many washes.<br />Will mainly just wear this around the house or when I'm working in the yard.
4.0,"I'm similar to the size of my old wallet, though this one is taller rather then wider in comparison."
4.0,"Love this jacket !!  Well made and looks great.<br />Size ran a bit small, I ordered a size bigger to compensate, but could of gone another size bigger. With the exception of that, I love it !"
4.0,"Nice color and length was great but it's a bit larger/wider than I expected.  Would be perfect for women with more cleavage.  I'm 5'10&#34; and 150 lbs if that's helpful.  Hoping to send back for a smaller size.  Also note the tag says to hand wash, but I'll be putting it on gentle cycle and laying flat to dry."
4.0,Hat will work great
4.0,"Looks great. It was, however, far larger than I had envisioned. Still worked great for iron anniversary gift."
4.0,"This is a really lovely set that I bought for a friend's mom's birthday. It's really pretty, kind of flashy and costumey but nice at the same time. The price is great, shipping was fast and easy. The ONLY issue I had is the packaging. It comes on a cheap piece of cardboard in a cheap white box. Just get a simple felt jewelry bag or box and you'll be set."
4.0,"I get so many compliments when I wear these. They make you feel and look glamorous! If there were something to complain about, it would be that there are NO Stones/Crystals on these glasses. So I have to take one star off for that. When I read the description stating ""sparkling bling"" I expected to see faux gems."
4.0,"If you played outside in the 70s you know exactly what you're in for here.  Durable, reasonably soft and comfortable, quick drying because it cannot actually absorb any water rough and tumble gym type shorts.  I use for hot yoga and they are ideal. Very short shorts compared to the last 3 decades of board style shorts, but nothing gasp inducing. They will inspire you to get back on leg day as feeble-thigh syndrome will be hard to cover..."
4.0,"The material is silky smooth on both sides, however the cut is weird if you have a large chest. I, personally, am a size 32D; and the fit was really tight on the chest. If you want a big, flowy feel; maybe a size or two larger would work. The straps are adjustable, but they only help length. As long as you’re aware of the above, I would recommend"
4.0,"Haven't used it yet, but material seems sturdy and overall well made."
4.0,the bee and the honey was cute but very small.
4.0,Comfortable for all day wear. Not heavy or clunky.
4.0,"I red some reviews, and some people suggest  to buy one size bigger than you are. I'm a medium size I ordered a large size and it fits me just right. Over all a nice and warm product."
4.0,Just received the dress so this review is before washing it. Pretty snug fit. I ordered a large...I am 5'3&#34; and typically wear a size 10/12. My intent was for this to be a swim suit cover up so I am okay with the snug fit. I would probably order a size up for it to be a regular dress.
4.0,"Despite barely spending any money, my mommy loved it as a Christmas gift. Thanks, NUMMY."
4.0,"Super cute, a bit small, but not so much that I cannot wear it. Im 113lbs 5'4 and I ordered a small"
4.0,Fits good✊🏼
4.0,Daughter loves these - fit and comfort. Only complaint is the material gets super dirty/dingy and doesn’t wash off even after machine wash.
4.0,Great color; a little short as a dress for someone 5'9&#34;+
4.0,"Adorable!!! This dress is so cute and perfect for the vintage event we're going to. Unfortunately this will probably be the only time she'll get to wear it. She wears 18/24 month clothes and the 2t dress fits perfectly on her, almost a tiny snug. I will definitely buy another one for next year though, just too cute not to."
4.0,"Cute ring, love the look.  The gold finish rubs off after a couple of wears."
4.0,"nly used them for 3-4 days so far, about 80 miles a day. From what I can tell so far-<br /><br />They hold, wearing kevlar ""denim"" jeans and they havent slipped yet.<br /><br />They fit, the length is just right for holding jeans and going under the boot arch<br /><br />I wish the hardware wasn't so shiny. I might try to use rifle bluing on the silver-colored clasps to cut down on all the shine, but they're probably stainless and wont take the bluing. Either that or affix some kind of decoration, but the whole reason I got these was I didnt want any skulls, HD branding, or other cliche decorations"
4.0,Cute set! It's costume jewelry. Don't expect high quality.
4.0,"The item is great. The one thing that is a problem for me, I will need to take my phone out of its case so the phone will fit in the purse phone case"
4.0,"Currently the cutest belly ring I own. It is the perfect size, shape, and colors. Four stars only because I haven't worn it long enough to know if it will fade or turn colors. I have wore it in the shower more than 5 times though so far and it hasn't changed (I dry it off thoroughly when I get out though)."
4.0,I bought three tops and all three of them fit different
4.0,It's a cute little jacket.  I was a little skeptical but I gave it a shot.  I was specifically looking for a bomber type sweater that I could wear at conferences.  This is close enough.  It looks nicer than in a thick sweater or hoodie.  I normally get large but I sized down to a medium and it still fits fine.  It has a thin lining and it's a nice weight.  I'm sure I'll use it a lot.
4.0,"Just because you sew the material into the shape/appearance of a wrap dress, doesn’t make it a wrap dress. Ordered this for an event. It was cute, but because it wasn’t really a wrap dress I couldn’t adjust the fit to my body. My girls up top are l big and the back is bigger lol so once I had the dress on I had to strategically maneuver throughout the night so nothing would pop out. If I had saw this dress earlier I could’ve gotten it altered. Definitely gonna make an appt for that for the future. I’d like to wear this again."
4.0,"Compared to other Euro sizing, you'll need to go up a size with these.  They are pretty 'plasticky' and may not breath very well, but for what you pay for them, they are a decent SPD-compatible shoe that's quick and easy to put on and adjust, fairly comfortable for me (I wanted some Pearl Izumi ones, but they're too tight across the forefoot for me).  A slight amount of flex in front of the mounting plate helps with walking, as does the softer rubber of the soles, not the hard plastic cleats found on some.  Not the best for hot weather riding, but otherwise, I&#34;m pretty happy with them."
4.0,"I'm a size 12 and 5'7. This skirt is tight. Very uncomfortable. If I were a size or two smaller it would fit. So ""fits most"" in my opinion is if you're size 10 or smaller"
4.0,"Just a little loose on my chest.  Perfevlct lenght for me (under knees) I am 5' ft.  Other than that, its well made and nice material.  Probably will buy another."
4.0,Very very long but very comfortable and cute!!
4.0,Great shirt but a little scratchy.  Wish it had a pocket.
4.0,Pretty comfortable all things considered but they do fog up when also wearing a mask.
4.0,"I own many and many and many pairs of sun glasses and my main goal is to find sunglasses that are very dark and the most important very light, shape and all the other stuff is not that important. When i received these i really liked the shape of these sunglasses. These are sooo fancy and cool! They are a little bit on the heavier side though. So i guess again i have to choose between beauty and comfortability.<br />Again, i have to be honest, im almost impossible to find right glasses for me, for almost everyone i know all the glasses i know are very comfortable and matching, so its not a big of a deal. I still like these sunglasses and planing to wear them when i wanna feel fancy, ill just not gonna wear them so often, thats it."
4.0,"I'm giving this item 4 stars. 5 stars for quality because I loved it however I'm in a size 11/12 I'm about 155 and the MEDIUM fit more like a size 13/15 my opinion. I didn't return them, I gave them to my sister who wears a size 15 and she loves them. They aren't see through, they are a good thickness as to not show underwear lines or color under the pants. Overall a good buy, I wish I would have gotten the small though. They have AMAZING stretch by the way. I loved them."
4.0,"The colors are so pretty on this scarf, just like in the picture.  The printed pattern is sharp and crisp with no ""bleeding"".  Just be aware that, although silky and soft, the material is very thin.  But for the price and appearance, this was a good purchase."
4.0,"Honestly a super cute dress and very nice quality. Only real gripe was the weird wing things. You either leave the tie loose and it just droops in front, or you sinch and the waist line and then it puckers and shows off a spare tire. I just cut the wings off and left the tie part. It worked perfectly! Wore it on my anniversary dinner date with my husband and was perfect! So cute."
4.0,Product is beautiful although the posts are a little long. And they're also the screw on kind for a kid.
4.0,Overall good looking tie! Would only recommend to be worn with a white shirt as the shiny of the tie throws it off a little but I am satisfied with it!
4.0,I like it. It's cute and its comfortable<br />I went one up from the chart size
4.0,These are very useful. I use them to hold coins. The stitching is a little loose though i'm afraid to fill them too much.
4.0,FOR THE MONEY SPENT THIS WAS A GOOD VALUE PURCHASE. I BOUGHT ONE FOR ME AND USED THE OTEHR 2 FOR GIFTS. THEY ARE SO LIGHT WEIGHT IT WAS INEXPENSIVE FOR ME TO SHIP THEM INDIVIDUALLY LATER.
4.0,Just replace the clasp with something sturdy.
4.0,bow fell off. kid liked it
4.0,Comfortable  not to heavy.
4.0,I like the style of the shoe and the apparent durability but it runs extremely large. I'm typically an 8 in all flat shoes and a 7 1/2 in heels. I ordered them in a size 8 and they are huge. I want to order them again but now I'm not sure what size to get!
4.0,Really cute but the cable wire gets tangled in my hair constantly.
4.0,"I purchased two of these sweat suits. They are made well with nice fabric and fun design. One should definitely order a size up. The larger of the two sets had pants that were unusually large. The jacket was perfect but the slacks were wide and very, very long. My taller daughter never finds bottoms that are too long since she is quite tall. The smaller set fit great. I will have to have about 4-5&#34; cut off the longer pants, thus removing the nice design. Wish I could have just exchanged the long pants. My daughters loved their suits. I just wonder if the sizing was a mistake."
4.0,"I tried them on immediately the day they arrived. I have nerve damage because of a partial spinal cord injury. My left foot is always cold even in the summer and even though I live in Florida. I also have a tendency to swell in the legs and the feet. So, when I put them on like the typical Mary Jane shoe with the strap across my foot it didn't work because my feet swell. They did feel glorious though. Soft and comfortable. So in my determination to keep them, I tried clipping the elastic strap. That didn't work because the heal of the sock did not stay on. So, I finally tried just putting the strap on the heal instead of across the top of my foot. Wala!! That worked. So, if you have a tendency to swell try putting the strap on your heal. I am only sorry I cut the strap on one pair. Oh well, I will have to order some more."
4.0,I had slacks that fit nicely everywhere but the waist.  The zipper would go three quarters of the way up.  This waist extender was what I needed!  No problem while wearing a shirt over the pants.
4.0,Got these for 14th wedding anniversary. Wife loved them
4.0,"I bought this boot in dark brown (the review I'm writing here) and the same boot in black from another seller. Both arrived super quick! These boots would have been a perfect fit in a 9 1/2, but they only come in 9 or 10. My last pair of boots was a vinyl material in the same exact dark brown. The vinyl material peeled back on the toes and the sole separated after less than a year (Kohl's purchase 2016 holiday season). Those were also a slouch style boot, but in a size 9.... a touch squeezy for comfort, especially when wearing thick, winter socks! While these new boots are a little roomier than I need, they are SO much more comfortable than a 9 on my feet! :) They are very cute boots!!!! The buckles at the top and down at the ankle may be problematic if not secured in one position. They seem a little loose.... I've been wearing my new boots around the house with no problems, but they are loose. I may put a stitch in all four buckles of each boot to make sure they stay! Also, the ankle of the boots fits a little loose, and I feel it more since my boots wear a little big. I've never tightened boot straps before, but I did so at the ankles on these and that made such a huge difference! We'll see how long these hold up. Very reasonably prices, which makes me wonder about how long they will last... I'll hop on with a 2nd review next season with an update! Hoping these are as good a purchase as they seem up front! Love the look and colors."
4.0,"good for colder days, when I want long sleeves before going to my sleeveless workout shirt. they are snug but move easily. I can workout in them and even play tennis."
4.0,"The necklace is beautiful but MUCH LARGER than I expected.  It was definitely something that demanded to be the centerpiece of an outfit.  I'm really not that bold with my jewelry but knew someone who would buy it from me it two seconds flat once they saw it.  It worked out great... My friend got a necklace that she loved (and was bold enough to wear), and I didn't have to return the necklace.  Win-Win 😀"
4.0,"They are OK, I wish I could still get the old kind that they apparently don't make any more.  :-("
4.0,"Very pretty, I wish they held into place a little better."
4.0,"As everyone knows, a medium may fit or it may not.  This was a little too small around the waist for me.  Returned.  Nice shirt, though."
4.0,"Material feels heavy on, like a sweatshirt but it's a not sweatshirt.  Feels like you're wearing a sweatshirt, but this is not made out of sweatshirt material.  Color is nice, buttons add a nice touch."
4.0,Bags are really small. Could maybe use as a small cosmetic bag
4.0,"Rings are comfortable and the thickness is good, but the start to fall apart after a month of wearing it. This is the 3rd one of the set that has done the same thing. Get what you pay for."
4.0,I prefer loose on the toes. They are snug on the toes if that’s your preference. The size is correct.
4.0,They arrived rapidly and were what I ordered. They were a gift and she loved them.  I can't wait to see her wear them.
4.0,"Would give this 5 stars if the very fragile chain hadn't broken on the first day.  I replaced it with a sturdier chain and have enjoyed wearing it often.  The pendant itself is lovely, but recommend that you buy a sterling chain as well when ordering."
4.0,Good support.  I likely needed to get the medium instead of the low.
4.0,These are good not as thin as other scarves.
4.0,It’s big for me. I will give to my mom
4.0,Very cute but runs small. Order a full size up
4.0,The clasp isn't very secure an I do wish it was strung with wire instead of white knotted twine. That said I received several compliments while wearing this.
4.0,"Excellent product.  fit was perfect.but just remember it is silk and is very thin and delicate...but if you are average build, you will look amazing in this shirt in any color..."
4.0,"I wear a US men's 9-9.5. It fits a lil too perfect not sure if it will shrink once washed. As for no show, it is very low cut so guaranteed not to expose the sock."
4.0,"This is a really nice shirt, however, it fits a little smaller than anticipated."
4.0,What a gorgeous dress. I can't wait to wear this in my friends wedding. I only wish it was an inch or two longer. I am 5'7&#34; and it will be just barely long enough if I wear flats.
4.0,"Got a medium and the sleeves are just a little too short to use the thumb holes comfortably. Still comfy, got lots of compliments."
4.0,Great for the price! Pockets are nice
4.0,"Great price, looks nice, did not arrive on time unfortunately."
4.0,"They should mention in the description that the glass lenses don't go all the way to the frames around the side, but otherwise great costume-quality glasses."
4.0,Le hubiera dado 5 estrellas. Pero la longuitud es arriba de la rodilla si mide 1.70 mt
4.0,"A little small on my booty, but still really comfortable and warm! Great for lounging around the house while there's cold weather"
4.0,It’s a good light weight sweater & very bold black in color.  Nice longer length & good for the price point. I’m just in “like” with this sweater.
4.0,"measures 42"" in width. Push button Open and Close - that was fun, and startling, to do for the first time, the closing part that is. Resin-reinforced iron and fiberglass ribs. A normal strong wind here on the Oregon Coast is 20mph so it will be fun to test it out the next storm, I haven't used an umbrella much here, rain jackets are the norm where it rains 220 days a year.<br /><br />I would have loved this when I lived in Florida where for 3-4 months year we would have torrential downpours lasting 5-20 minutes and this umbrella would be perfect where 'the pongee inner layer would completely eradicate the soak through or leak, even in torrential downpours'.<br /><br />Another great aspect is on tremedously hot sunny days the 'outer surface is coated with black glue, which can effictivly block UV rays'."
4.0,"These are very nice looking, but they are quite delicate, so they are not for all day wear. Still, they're fun at home. Just ask the Mrs."
4.0,"This color is beautiful! My only concern is with the length (l 'm 4' 11&#34; , so this is fairly long on me, but 5' 4&#34; and over will be all set! !). Other than that, high quality on the cut and the material. Absolutely worth a try. Highly recommended!"
4.0,"ladies like this, but have problem wrapping around wrist!"
4.0,I was a little pissed that the picture doesn't show that you have a wire connected.... I bought these for my son to wear to homecoming (along with the tie)... I didn't want him to look like a secret service agent... LOL  All good though...
4.0,Great quality! Is exactly as expected. To get the fit on the model in the photos order your regular size.<br /><br />This sweater is thick and seems to be well-made. Bought in the mauve and the black and they both wear and wash well.
4.0,"This bag is a good size but not too large. The leather is of good quality and the style is very good. I  had a delivery issue and the customer service was quick, polite and efficient. i would definitely buy from them again"
4.0,Good value and comfortable.
4.0,"I have plantar fasciitis and was looking for a slip on to wear around the house. Turned out I wear them in and out! They help my feet so much. The only thing is they run wide, not enough to be terrible. With socks they are better."
4.0,The material was decent for the price. Definitely bigger around the bust area but a bandeau worked for a quick fix. Definitely would recommend wearing a petticoat underneath for a little bit more flare and body.
4.0,These were good slippers. Tough yet comfortable. I wore them till I walked holed in the bottoms.
4.0,"I love the design of these glasses and the color is pretty. I have a similar frame for my more expensive glasses, so I'm used to the larger frames. The frames and lens feel a little cheaper because they feel plasticy, but I think they're cute to wear. My only issue is that I used a blue light testing pen I have from Zenni, and the light went straight through which means they are NOT blue light blocking... I tried them on $3 bluelight glasses I got from Target and even those blocked the light better. Stylish otherwise, but probably not effective."
4.0,Great dress for a great price! Can be dressed up or down. I've bought in 2 different colors.
4.0,good quality all cotton
4.0,I also had the issue of telling front from back but finally got used to it after buying about 10. Do they come only in the double back? I don't need two of each color. White is my favorite as it's very cool.
4.0,"Pretty cool gift for my father-in-law who hates me because I'm not Native American, I guess he liked it?"
4.0,"The quality control on this is a little sketchy. Details of strings hanging off some of the ears and one of my tails was not sit down correctly. All very minor fixes but irritating. For a shoe that asked me for my exact size I didn't expected come in small, medium and large. Because I where a 7 1/2 the large is a bit on the large side. This is more true for the width and the length. Find them quite warm for their style and attractive which is what I wanted for wearing slippers in the house. As in my house you don't wear shoes you wear slippers."
4.0,Very comfortable bra. Not a lot of support for larger breasts but probably fine for C or smaller cups.
4.0,I love this dress. I’ve had it for years and love wearing it layered with a bunch of other black items. The ruffles and cut on the back make any outfit I put together more interesting and fun. My only complaint is that the strings to tie the back are ridiculously long and can be a pain to tuck/hide.
4.0,Wife says they look & feel good ... They fix her Petite frame nice & snug ...  Make sure to air them out as they smell terrible ...
4.0,I ordered 4t for my 4 year old. Fit good but it could have been a little higher over the chest. Good thing the bow was there to cover up and nip-slips
4.0,Muy lindo la verdad
4.0,Veryeasedwith cord and spring licks.  The ends didn't stay finished just from heating. I used heat shrink tubing for ends and they work great
4.0,"I wore it traveling to Vietnam where it is very hot and humid.  It was really comfortable, but the color faded on my underwear."
4.0,these are awesome sunglasses i love the color the only thing is i would want them to be a little darker
4.0,"My mom has severe Dementia and can't easily put on a coat or sweater but still needs something warm to wear outside.  With this Poncho it's big enough to cover her upper torso, her arms and hands.  With it being lined it keeps her very warm.  I gave it 4 stars because of the wool and the need to dry clean.  We use it regularly and don't have the time or the opportunity to get out of the house to get it cleaned.  I would highly recommend this product to everyone but would like to ask the manufacturer to figure out a way for it to also be made from a different material on the outer layer."
4.0,"I think it is very lovely and goes well with most of my wardrobe because of the nonintrusive jersey grey color. I will say the quality of the wristband itself is not great, a plastic-like material that looks like it may fray in the next couple months. Also telling time in triangle can be surprisingly challenging at times."
4.0,"Fit well, hood is a bit big. But still works."
4.0,Love the color and design. I bought the 3 pack camo and I love the look of all of them. I wore one pair already and I can’t wait to wear the rest of them. I purchased Large. I’m 5’4” and 190 pounds
4.0,I was sad that they said 4 but I only got three! It kinda screwed up the gift :(
4.0,"Overall this is a nice belt for the price. It latches easily and holds all day. The only never was that its very long so I had to cut quite a bit off, and after doing so I melted the end to keep it from fraying. It only held together for a few days before it began to fray unfortunately. If the length is correct, I would recommend it. If not, I say pass. Hope this helps ~ Chesapeake"
4.0,"Super soft and fit perfectly! I got a large, and for reference, I'm 5foot 9inches, and 38in bust with 32in waist. I thought the sleeves weren't going to fit, I have broad shoulders, and they were roomy (: I got the green and it's a little see through, so I recommend something underneath. Otherwise awesome find"
4.0,"I have been trying to find a bikini to wear that is a 2 piece and thought this one to be pretty cute. The suit came out to be a bit large for me but is nice. There were some black little spots on the top that I think may have come from the dying process and came out once washed. The material is nicely constructed. Normally I wear a large to extra large and got this in 2X in hopes it wouldn fit but the top is a bit big. I am a 38C and think the top quips be a better fit for someone that wears a 40D. Yes I am a curvy girl and would wear a cover up, please be kind as I want to be fair to show the fit. I am pleased overall and know next time to get one size smaller. I received this item discounted in exchange for my honest,  unbiased review. I was not compensated in any other way."
4.0,Good quality for the price. They seem to be spinning fairly well. The were a bit big but that was probably our fault with measuring
4.0,Top is great bottoms are very small tho definitely more of a thong than just cheeky I got a medium
4.0,"I have used this for 1 hot day and 2 stormy and cold rides. They do keep your arms colder and also protect you from sun burns (Puerto Rico all year long summer) and they do protect on rides at 70 - 75 degrees with the wind factor, could be lower but, again, Puerto Rico is not as cold as state side. The fabric is true black and when on the arm does not show skin in the light, but its very thin and does not have the plastic strip that could hold your Sleeves but only when on rainy days is proved to be necessary, also, in the picture there is a small logo on the wrist part, that must be a water mark because mine does not came with that.  This sleeves are light as air and you can use it on wet/cold/hot rides, you won't notice you're wearing. Also, they don't look cheap.... I will gladly buy a pair down the road. I am a medium large (5'11&#34; 230lbs) rider with a bit above average wide arms and it does fit very well.<br /><br />***No five stars do to the thinner material compared to other brands at the same price level, no plastic band to hold the upper sleeve part, on adverse weather this proved to be a must, the logo in the picture is not really in the sleeves and have to burn some lose threats that were dangling from the seams."
4.0,"Of all the bras I've bought online, this is probably the most supportive. It's still just as fitting as it was when I first got them, the only downside is that the black and gray unraveled a bit after the 3rd was. The others are just fine. I'm a 44G and I manage to get in there and stay in it. It may not keep my breasts from bouncing too much, but they stay in there."
4.0,"Really cute top! I was specifically looking for one of these that wasn’t 100% spandex or anything too itchy or clingy.  The material is decent for the price-and the size is spot on, which is rarely the case with these type of things.  The medium size specifically fits as a Misses  medium (juniors large)."
4.0,Doesn't fit snuggly but fits
4.0,Super cute and fit well. Darker/brighter pink than we expected but my daughter still loves them
4.0,pleased with delivery time and product itself
4.0,I am usually not a person who orders a swim suit online but this was too cheap to pass up! And to be honest I was very<br />Impressed! As a mom of 4 I have the typical mommy tummy but this suit still fit well. The bottoms were what really surprised me - I like the cut in the back and the front! The top was rather large though and I will have to do some adjusting. I am a 34 a/b cup and it was a little to big around my chest.<br /><br />For reference I am 5'3&#34; 125 lbs.
4.0,The top fits great for me as a small but the bottoms are a bit tight.<br />I'm 5' 0&#34; and 115lbs. Measurements fit within the small range.
4.0,a bit long. but very pretty. plastic rose. It looks like the picture. the free gift comes in handy to use on laptop cords to hold together.
4.0,"These seem like they'll be fine.  Thick material, with the nice 'privacy flap' to keep people from seeing personal info, and the clip is sturdy.  The pink is more pepto than it looks on my screen - I was expecting something more along the lines of blush - but I'll keep them."
4.0,Nice work out
4.0,Runs small. Go up at least 2 sizes. Nice. Just to thick for me.
4.0,"So let's be honest here. I liked the dress. But, if you are in any way the least bit busty (I am a C), no matter how little your waist is, you're going to want to go up a size. I ordered a small and I wish I would have ordered a medium so I didn't have to wear a tank top to keep everything from popping out. Also as a small, it was a little snug for what I wanted. So, if you want it to be a comfortable fit, I would go up a size. Also, they don't exaggerate the leg slit in the picture. That bad boy goes all the way up."
4.0,Comfy fall sweater. The brown is a great shade.
4.0,The dress was amazing. I got a lot of compliments. However I ordered a large and wear a DD in bra size and the top was too big. I was worried anytime I lifted my arms that someone may see into the dress. Other then that it fit amazing!
4.0,"This is a very pretty and detailed blouse. The picture does not do it justice. It is thin material, and rather see-through. I will wear it with a cami for that reason and because the cut outs do go along the whole front, and would show undergarments. It is sized slightly small, so I ordered an XL (I usually wear an 8 in US tops) and it fits nicely. Not sure I would tuck it in like the model is doing though, because it seems a little bulky at the base to do that. It's not really my style to tuck in anyway. For the price, it's a cute top and will look nice for work or going out."
4.0,"The product is gorgeous fits perfectly on my small wrist. The one downfall is, it does not stay screwed in. The bar fell and my bracelet fell off twice. I am contemplating gluing it on making it permanent.."
4.0,As described and arrived in a timely manner
4.0,Good giftable without spending alot foe that Steelers fan you love and hate lol
4.0,These were easy to but in my ears and I'm my tragus. Love them.....
4.0,Great for holding my cards and even holds my phone & a pack of gum. Sometimes the zipper catches though so it’s not super easy to get in and out of the wallet (those maybe that’s a plus against thieves)
4.0,A lot better quality than expected
4.0,Fits pretty good. Wish that the straps had a little more support
4.0,I like the pattern and the colorful colors. I only wish it had an opening like a poncho so that I could wear it as such. I will make some modifications to it!
4.0,I would like to return the shoes but order one size smaller...otherwise the shoes are fine...
4.0,This is a great band for everyday wear and to wear while exercising. Very breathable.
4.0,Looking for a perfect gag gift or white elephant gift.  This is the ticket.  It’s not super well made but about what I expected for the price.  Comes with a little fan to keep it inflated.  It’s not always easy to move around in it but what do you expect.<br /><br />For what it is and the price you get exactly what you paid for.
4.0,The fit is awesome. Super soft
4.0,"Prompt delivery,  fit perfectly and support you can feel."
4.0,It a great a warm coat the only downside to the jacket it has no inside pockets
4.0,I bought these for my 10 month old daughter to wear. I live in the northeast and it is the beginning of fall so these are a perfect fit. These boots are beautifully crafted. Soft and comfy for her tiny little feet. They may be too comfortable because she slips right out of them after an hour or two! they need to be snuggly secured and you must be sure to check if their toes are where they should be without them slipping right off. You may also want to check the inside for paper balls. I thought I had fully removed the cardboard and attempted to put her feet in not realizing there was a still a paper ball inside for shape (oops!). They area wonderful fashion statement without giving up comfort. I just wish the velcro would tighten a little more but she can grow into them! Not recommended for long term wear.
4.0,The peridot is really pretty.
4.0,My daughter likes this bag. It is better than the other bag that is way too big.
4.0,"I bought it for a friend and she loves it. Though, sometimes the button functions wouldn't work and you have to really press it in. Still for the price its decent"
4.0,"I bit too long compared to the darker jeans, same size. But still nice."
4.0,Very cute costume but the tail is a little too heavy and only stayed on with a safety pin.
4.0,"I wish there was more support, but I have a larger chest and it's hard to find good strapless support at all. These are comfortable and what I expected. I wear a 36 DD and dont like strapless bras because they are soo uncomfortable, but these will be good under certain shoulder revealing tops and dresses. I got a large and it fits just right. I am keeping them."
4.0,"The pants are a little long on me but other than that everything fit perfectly, I’m 5’4 153lbs & ordered a Medium . Safe to say they are tall girl friendly😊"
4.0,The material is great!! Very comfy and soft but the top is a bit on the bigger size. Still worth the price.
4.0,Sleeves pretty big kinda annoy me but rest fit as expected think I'll cut sleeves off mine make muscle jersey out of it rest of it I liked fine. Feel tough heavier like most real jerseys are. Great color to.
4.0,Very comfortable clothing material
4.0,I like it but bought some boy short bathing suit bottoms to go with it instead of the regular bottoms.
4.0,"Much more “teal” in real life, instead of kelly green as shown.  Light weight and easy to wear!"
4.0,"I like it. It’s so comfy. The material is good and not cheap. It’s thick and soft at the same time. I like they have pocket, but I don’t like the drawstring waistband. The elastic band is big and is rolled halfway all the time and I keep put it back all day. It’s killing my ocd nerve. It’s fit to true size like I expected though.<br />Overall it’s good, I like it."
4.0,"I like the sandals very much, their different"
4.0,"I like this a lot, I wish they were a little thinner."
4.0,Was a Christmas gift
4.0,I was actually was wanting an Alex and Ani bracelet.....I didn't read very well...sorry...it's really cute though!!!!
4.0,"I bought these for the 13” length.  Expected them to have a more Lycra stretchy fit.  Happy with them, but in time I’m afraid they will stretch out."
4.0,A little bigger then I would have liked but works great
4.0,Beautiful but much larger than I expected.
4.0,"My husband and I had gold wedding bands when we got married, He is a very active man who works out at the gym, chops wood, does yard work, and plays a few different instruments. He was always taking off his gold wedding band and leaving it out, then forgetting to put it back on for work. I bought this silicone set so it would more comfortable for him. The silver ring isn't silvery all throughout the ring like other brands, but is merely painted on. Now my husband doesn't want to wear it. He only wore it 2 days before the finish rubbed off. The black and grey rings are colored all the way through and seem to be of better quality."
4.0,"I wanted it to have a high neck,, like a T-shirt and instead it has a large opening at the neck.  too large for me<br />Otherwise it is what I wanted and expected."
4.0,"These are exceptionally war! Got cod winter outside work, first order was slow getting here it read reviews and thought that was just happen so. Prdetrd some for x!as stocking stuffets, sit not here in !middle of jan. Good product of you don't !one the slow delivery."
4.0,Their what I was looking for bought 2 pairs on blue amd the black and pink ones
4.0,These shoes are so cute and my son doesn’t try taking them off. He walks very well in them compared to hard-sole shoes. The only reason I gave it 4 stars out of 5 is because they are wearing around the edges very quickly because my son still crawls sometimes and they are a little too big even though I used the size chart. Happy with them regardless.
4.0,Would've gave 5 if it had molle stiched in.
4.0,"I love this dress, however the slit in the back is a bit to high and it shows my rear end, so I've had to sew it so it doesn't expose my rear end.  Other than that it's a awesome dress!"
4.0,Good product that fits my versatile life style.
4.0,I bought this nightgown 2 years ago in white.  The fabric on that one is a good bit more substantial than the oink I just got.  I can walk outside in my white one but will need a robe over the pink.  It also runs bigger now.  I bought the small this time (last time I got the medium) and even so it was a bit bit.  I washed it in warm water and put it in the dryer and it is better but still a bit big.  It would be 5 stars but I deducted a point for the sheerness.
4.0,"Nice wallet but I cannot figure out why the &#34;cash&#34; section with the zipper is too small to put a U.S. dollar bill in. The zipper takes up space making the opening too short for the 6&#34; dollar bill. I like my bills to lay flat, not be folded.  This is not the first time I have had this problem with a wallet. Why would you do that?  Fortunately with this wallet other sections are a perfect size for a dollar bill so it works.<br />Looks sturdy, has lots of card slots, except for the zipper problem, plenty of room."
4.0,Great fit! Looked nice with my everyday black dress pants.
4.0,Love this bag.  Wish the handles were a little longer.
4.0,"I love them. I have been looking for comfortable slippers with platform heels that can make me a little taller at home. I have tried some other ones and they created noises when I walk on my hard wood floor. This pair is pretty quiet when I walk and they keep my feet very warm. The bottom of the shoes kind of hard and I am okay with it (this is the reason why I gave it a 4 star instead of 5). It would be perfect if it would come with a pair of memory foam shoe pads, which would help resolve the problem."
4.0,Fit perfectly plus I love blouses that you can packup easily for travel with no ironing.
4.0,This is a great skirt especially since I'm 5'10. It hits the bottom of my ankles folded down or the floor unfolded.<br />Only dislike is the material is is thin. You will need to wear a slip or slip shorts underneath.
4.0,Beautiful print and fits nicely!
4.0,"I'm right between a small and medium (some smalls are too tight while some mediums are too large); this dress I was definitely a small (5'4"", 130lb, B-cup). I originally ordered the red medium and it swallowed me; also got the dark blue small and it was perfect. I returned the medium to a Kohls drop off location and the process was super easy... got my refund within a few days (maybe 3? and it was a holiday weekend). The dress is fitted enough to feel flirty but lose enough to not feel smothered or unflattering. Main downsides are that it's mostly raylon so anytime you put something, like a phone, in the pockets it weighs the whole dress down which isn't super flattering. Also, the elastic waist line is ""heavy"" so it pulls down the top half of the dress, more noticeable in the back."
4.0,"The cutest shorts... If you don't mind having to roll them up 5/6 times....<br />But I get it. They're made in China and the shape of them is strange. They are just long. I probably wouldn't buy them if I knew how they fit, but I won't return them. It's just not worth it to me, besides they aren't ugly. You just can't wear them with any top that show the waist, like a bathing suit or tucked in/crop top shirt.<br />I ordered a small and if I wear them unfolded, they are almost to my knee lol.<br />I don't mind having to roll them up."
4.0,A little thicker gauge than I'm used to but overall they look nice
4.0,"The necklace looks really cool, tbh I bought this after watching Kakegurui bc I really like the anime and I’m an impulsive buyer (to a certain degree). The quality is really nice and heavy and very reflective. The only reason why it doesn’t get a 5 star is bc the pendant is bigger than I thought so I can’t imagine myself wearing this."
4.0,Wife loves it.  Good house coat for warm climates or warm wife.
4.0,I like the style but the material is different then expected. It reminds me of windbreaker material.
4.0,I'm 5'10 and the length was on the short side for me
4.0,LOVE THESE BUT THEY BROKE AT THE HINGE AFTER A FEW MONTHS...
4.0,Great boots for the price. Wish I would have gotten a size smaller though.
4.0,"This suit is so cute! I wear a size 17 and ordered a 14-16 which is the largest they offer. The tag on arrival said 4x. It fit great once I actually got it on, but I could hear some snapping in the smaller back seams when trying to get it over my hips. The print is really cute and bright. It has two layers and feels pretty well made. There is ample padding in the chest area. Overall a super cute suit at a great value! I definitely recommend!<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"Not quite as vivid as I was hoping, but a very beautiful charm.  Looks similar to a hot air balloon."
4.0,Fun design
4.0,"Good product, light, good material combination, excellent price and details. Lack labels explaining about the product warranty period as well as what to do in case any problem comes up with product during warranty period as well as how to use the (TSA LOCK)"
4.0,"This bracelet is great.  I wear it in the pool, I wear it in the ocean, I wear it in the shower. It is very durable and my girlfriend likes the way it looks on me."
4.0,love it super cute and fun to wear
4.0,"Love it, but a bit snug."
4.0,"Great size and color, the only thing that sucks was one of my earrings had a stone already missing. I liked them tho and I'm not very patient so I didn't want to wait for another pair. I do love the color and size tho and hope they don't thurn my ear lobes green like other earrings have."
4.0,ring is ok girl friend loved it but the letters on the side have faded and it hasn't even been 6 months over all it is a good buy
4.0,"Before I ordered this watch I checked the reviews,and the reviews weren't all so great,but I Luv butterflies sooo much I definitely wanted to get this and try for myself. It is sooooo pretty,I Luv everything about it as far s the looks, but it didn't work when I received it. However, the seller if sending me another one and hopefully that one works. But the price I paid can't complain,and still worth the buy if it works..."
4.0,Installation was a breeze completely intuitive. 11 screws. 4 to complete the base 4 to attach the swivel mechanism and 3 to hold the pole together. Fairly pleased with the umbrella. Since we placed over the seem of the decks L we decided to screw it directly into the joists holes seemed to by spaced correctly to allow it hit a joist on all 4 arms. I'm not sure about a weighted base if there is much wind unless you get a very large heavy duty one. We had some sand and gravel bags being used to complete the landscaping that we tried first to see if it would be sturdy enough but I was able to tip it slightly so didn't feel comfortable. Either way I'm not sure why you would have an umbrella up with high wind gusts feel like that's more of a precieved issue then an actual issue. Umbrella seems well built its definitely not a 500$ umbrella which is fine I didn't want a 500$ job when this is perfectly fine.  Only gripe so far is that one of the arms pops out of the cup on the canvas every so often just have to fit the canvas back before opening. It looks as though it would be fine in a light rain will update later this week as we are due for some rain. I do not see myself sitting under it in a downpour again more of a precieved issue than something that would actually happen
4.0,"My bad for not reading through before ordering, but it’s the size of my forearm"
4.0,i love the color of these shoes thats why i ordered them. the only bad thing is the color on the thong part is peeling off. other then that there nice.
4.0,"OMG i love this shirt!!! the color is gorgeous, the fit is pretty true to size, verging on a little small.  the only reason i docked it a star was in the description it calls it a sweatshirt and it is definitely NOT a sweatshirt.  it's a nice heavy tee but no sweatshirt.  regardless, i love this print, color and company, i have bought other clothing items of theirs and very much enjoy!!"
4.0,"I love the quality of these leggings, but I am not in love with the fit. These are inherently not built for bubble butts, which I have. The next size up would have been too big. I wish manufacturers would not cut the front and rear of pants to be the same-- rear ends have curves to them. Overall, I love the quality, and it will serve its purpose. I will make sure to wear a shirt / skirt long enough so no one sees the dip in the hem. If you are proportionately built, go ahead and purchase these with confidence. If you have a little extra in your butt only.... maybe size up?"
4.0,"Great ring, but sizes are a bit off. Be sure to check size chart for this specific store before purchasing. Mine was way too big."
4.0,This was a birthday gift and it was a big hit. My 8 year old girl loved it. I would recommend this to everyone who like among us.
4.0,This is a great cover-up. Lightweight…a little sheer but cool even when covering shoulders/back to not get burned. Button only a couple buttons and very sexy.
4.0,Good quality but runs a bit small. Looks a bit off I’d you are larger cheated.
4.0,I bought these as a gag Christmas gift.I wasn't sure if the picture on the socks would be clear.They actually looked pretty nice and were a big hit!
4.0,"My pre-teen is a witch for Halloween and a purple hat was a must to match the rest of her outfit.  This hat works well in that regard.  Underwire in the hat allows one to pose it as desired for just the right amount of crookedness.  Good for low end costumes on a budget, but definitely not theatrical or cosplay quality.  It can also fold up to allow easy storage."
4.0,Polarization works well. Does cause some eye fatigue if not a bright sunny day.
4.0,Very comfortable and adjusting super easy. Only difficulty was attaching to watch the pins fall out quickly if it doesn't pop into place the first time. Once I got the ease down it was quickly placed on the watch.
4.0,"Fits like says,  very nice material"
4.0,i little too big
4.0,"The hat was mostly wadded up into the smallest envelope that could hold it. One week after delivery, it has uncrumpled most, but not all, of the way back to its intended shape. A few wrinkles in the crown look as if they will have to be steamed out.<br /><br />However, it seems to be of better quality than its shipping method would dictate. The felt is heavier, for one thing.<br /><br />It fit well; my head circumference is 22 7/8&#34;."
4.0,"I like the watch, it looks good, but sometimes when you look quick it is hard to see the minute hand"
4.0,Would have liked something a little more fittted
4.0,good coalitions all
4.0,GreT fitting hat!!
4.0,"it's so cute, but runs small, you should definitely get a size bigger, the material is thin."
4.0,"the dress fits perfect, but the neck isn't as scooped as shown in the picture."
4.0,"This is an excellent watch, good looking and useful.  I was looking for a lighter watch for sports and general use and this fits the bill.<br />The face is stylish, the band comfortable (and more subtle in color than the picture) and ticking, unlike some Timex watches, very quiet.  This can be used as an all-around watch as it is better looking than most casual watches.<br />My only gripes: The large ""second"" hand is only for the chronograph, not the time.  Seconds of time are shown on the small bottom dial which can't be stopped while setting time.<br />Make sure to set the chronometer per online instructions before using it.  The instructions with the watch didn't show the right procedure.<br />Were it possible, I'd give it 4.5 stars."
4.0,It looks so cute!
4.0,I’m so happy I bought this. It’s my go to when I want to sort of dress up but be comfortable. I feel bohemian in it. Love it and the pockets!
4.0,"I bought this dress in a size M in yellow for a potential costume I have in mind. The material (as stated on the tag) is 90% cotton and 5% spandex, which I greatly appreciate. It's slightly stretchy so it's form fitting but also comfortable. While I have a personal vendetta with invisible fashion zippers, there hasn't be a problem with this one so far but, should it ever break, the dress and slip on and off without it. And the tea-length is wonderful.<br />It does wrinkle VERY easily and it takes a bit of effort to iron it out, especially at the hem, and I'm not much of the fan of the weird pleat by the bow. Speaking of, I like the bow but it was sewn on quite shoddily so I can either remove it entirely and add a snap to it (for versatility!) or re-sew it back on firmly.<br />Also, a petticoat is a must if you want to make it full but it's nice on its own.<br /><br />Overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase."
4.0,"Not crazy about the shape, a little too midlife crisis looking for me. The plastic construction is a little cheap too. I miss the days of the electric lead and vegus metal frames, but it seems that electric is over that."
4.0,Wish they had xs. Small is like a large night gown. Love the shirt though. Really pretty
4.0,Spicy earrings. A little bit heavier than I expected but they look fab. Nice and big just like I wanted.
4.0,"This fits slightly small. My daughters size wasn’t available, but so loved the shirt so I ordered the next size up for next year. I’m so thankful I did! The shirt fits her with just a little growing room. Incredibly cute and the length is perfect as a long tunic."
4.0,This product was shipped in time. No issues with that. Overall quality is very good for the price and the design is beautiful.<br />The size was a bit weird though. I ordered a L based on the size chart and it fits well on the waist and chest. But it is a little tight on the sleeves.<br />But it looks very classy and elegant as formal wear as well as with jeans. I plan to wear it to work for meetings or even dinner with family.<br /><br />The seller is very helpful and willing to work with you if you have any issues (which you may not have).
4.0,Cute but I ordered rose gold and received gold! Not a true rose gold. Very frustrating because I ordered it for my nieces birthday and she loves rose gold.
4.0,"Good gripper sock as per picture and description.  Great price.  Multipack.  I am able to put these over my white crew socks(2 pair-added warmth and cushioning.  If I were to wear only a gripper sock, I would go with McKesson- it's a thicker sock with more stretch that ""shapes"" better to my foot, but much more expensive."
4.0,It looks really nice only problem is its a bit small so it doesn't fit perfectly. But other than that its great.
4.0,It feel much like a stretch dress slack - which is nice - just not what I expected for a Yoga pant.
4.0,"Smaller than I expected, but very pretty"
4.0,Pretty t-shirt. I wore it proudly for Halloween.
4.0,"Lovely necklace. I bought this for my nice, whose nickname is &#34;Moon.&#34; She is on her 3rd pregnancy and could use a lift in spirits.<br />I can't give it 5 stars because I don't know if the chain will break, etc....."
4.0,My sons school had an 'ugly sweater' day - and this was perfect for  my taco loving 8 year old.  I wish it said Merry Christmas or Feliz Navidad or something - but still cute!  He wears between a small and a medium -- I got him a medium and it fit well - he couldn't have gotten by with a small.
4.0,"These sunglasses are wonderfully light weight — exactly what I was hoping for. They are also good bifocals, which I need after cataract surgery. Only caveat is, you need both hands to put them on as they are springy."
4.0,I purchased a light and dark color. The light color keeps you cooler. Buy the light color
4.0,"It's cheap, which is to be expected. If you are not adverse to a few threads needing to be cut, it will do the job. I don't use it for warmth, because it's thin, but it's nice to use it in the office when the AC goes turbo."
4.0,I like the oral color
4.0,Nice watch for price
4.0,"Overall, I am pleased with this hat."
4.0,"These are very nice earrings.  I took off one star because I feel they are over priced, but I will keep them as I do like the size of the earrings and the color of the stones.  These came quickly and in a nice box for gifting."
4.0,"It was well received. The words won't be that recognizable. But it's great for the ""mama bear"" of your family"
4.0,The neck didnt scoop like pic shows but they are comfy
4.0,Other than being a tad bit small on the breast size it's awesome and cute and great material! I'm a 36DD 138lbs and ordered the size 10
4.0,"I bought  this mask for my 2 year old great grandson son. It is made of very good quality. Sorry, I would have given a five but it’s a little to big for his face."
4.0,"I was really excited to receive these glasses in the mail as they looked so cute and trendy.<br />However, I was disappointed to find that they had been bent during shipping by Amazon.<br /> Although the glasses themselves were stylish and would have been a great addition to my wardrobe, I'm now hesitant to try ordering another pair, as I'm worried they may be damaged again in transit. I'd love to receive a new pair in good condition....but I'm a bit hesitant to give it another shot."
4.0,These gloves are very stylish and work well with a touch screen. I bought these as a gift for my friend and he loves it.
4.0,It folds up a bit at the waist at times but otherwise works great. It helped smooth things out for my St. Patties outfit.
4.0,Got for my hubby. Its a bit small as he likes beanies to go over his ears a bit and this one just kind of sits on the top of the head but does not go very far down.
4.0,"Nice, light, comfortable and can be dressed up or dress down. Nice sexy fit."
4.0,No ties. It is a little loose. Ties would make its look better. Quality of this thin cloth is good.
4.0,"I bought this for a Rosie the Riveter costume, and it is of decent quality - however I think it should be classified petite due to the height. I am 5'8&#34; and it is going to be a bit tight in the crotch, but I will make it work for one day. I would order a size larger than you think you'll need.<br /><br />After I wore it, I found that the zipper was of deplorable quality. That would be my biggest complaint. I had to fight it to get it to zip, and then I'd sit down and it would just fly open...and no it wasn't so tight that it should have done that."
4.0,Cute. Not tried in the water as yet hopefully soon when it gets warmer.
4.0,this one looks really nice in actual. the quality is nice and very comfortable to wear. great find!
4.0,"Gown fit well on my 3 year old granddaughter; however, headband on Rapunzel braid is way too big; more for a grown up sized head."
4.0,"Great buy, excellent quality"
4.0,"My 14yo daughter thinks these are snazzy and cute...good deal for sterling. This stuff is not constructed like fine jewelry, nor did I expect it to be. The &#34;pearls&#34; feel cheap, but look just fine...nobody is pretending here."
4.0,"The jacket is tailored well and a nice cut just as pictured. A little shine to the material. The pants, definitely slim, making a slim guy look too skinny in my opinion. The ascot is nice. But wasn't expecting such a bold chinese dragon design on the vest. Plan to mix & match this."
4.0,Pleasantly surprised with these cheapsters. Had a small scratch on the lens before they arrived so 4 out of 5. Other than that. They are pretty flimsy but that's what you get with the price. Lenses are actually quite nice besides the small scratch
4.0,Very pretty and lightweight dress. I wore it to a wedding and it fit nice and help hide my post baby bump belly. I am a whopping 5'2 and this dress hit me right at the ankles. I am very happy with this dress
4.0,"Cute swimsuit, made well. It just did not fit my body type. I would not advise for larger chests."
4.0,It fit great and the material was perfect. It didn't wrinkle. The only thing I didn't like is that the elastic was a little tight on my arms and the shoulders would slip down. My arms aren't that big so it shouldn't have been that tight but I dealt with it. It definitely wasn't a deal breaker. I really loved the dress and the pink ribbon was great.
4.0,the jacket runs very small. had to send it back and order larger size.
4.0,gave to my son for his birthday - he thought it was very appropriate
4.0,I like the product. It’s hard to adjust sometimes to fit your face although it has adjusters on the side. It gets the job done nonetheless.
4.0,This purse is big.  The color is nice and so is the material.  I wish it had more pockets on the inside or a divider bbecause you can store alot in it. Definitely recommend it and so does my friend who wished she could take it home with her.
4.0,Muy grande para el talle.
4.0,Good variation of colours of socks...if looking for the classic look. Noticed that there's a lining on the inside towards the top part of the socks..not sure if this is to make sure it stays up. Was a bit skeptical but was impressed by the Quality of the socks....this was bought as a gift though. Hopefully we'll see how long it lasts.
4.0,It is a stretchy fabric. It doesn't seem so in the pictures but it is. I should have prefer one size smaller. It fits very well and it's appropriate for a party or an afternoon with flats.
4.0,These are inexpensive but nice looking. They are not luxury pearls but are great for every day wear.
4.0,"So I like the idea of this skirt, it just wasn't that cute on me. :( Much cuter on the model in the picture. :)"
4.0,"Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it! I was pleasantly surprised. First of all, with all the reviews, I wasn't sure if it would fit him but it was a perfect fit. It has a nice profile, very unique! We haven't washed it so I can't comment on that yet but so far so good!"
4.0,Worked perfect for teacher gift!  Colors were nice.
4.0,Fits as expected. Seems light weight. It is NOT Fuchsia.... it is hunter orange.... I still like it.
4.0,It does have a high waist line and I’m short so I can only imagine on a taller person it might be even more different but everyone complimented it and thought it was nice felt nice and was comfortable
4.0,"Great rings. I only gave them 4 stars because some of them can be a bit hard to open and close. Other than that, they completely met my expectations."
4.0,Very cute. I am concerned about the chain connected to the clasp breaking. It is VERY thin and will snap in half if you're not careful. So I am going to replace it with a thicker chain from a hobby store.
4.0,"UPDATE: We just returned from a trip whereby we used these in order to be outside, but around people. This was the original intent, but we had hoped the filter addition would be a benefit: it didn't work. We had tried these around the house and on a couple short trips to the grocery store and they worked fine with the filters in. However, when we got to The Keys and wore them outside for more than about 20 minutes, they started to become a pain. The filters would move around, flip in the holder, and slide out. Both my wife and I ended up taking the filters out. There is the second layer because of the filter holder/slot, so we had to hope that was enough - it does add a bit more material. In the end we still liked the gaiter overall and it was comfortable, but the filter set up does not work. If they were to close one end, perhaps it would work better. But the flipping was the first thing to happen, so I don't know.<br /><br />We believe in the science and experts (as a scientist myself) and know that using a mask to help limit or prevent exposure and illness from Covid is a smart, adult, responsible, and respectful thing to do. To that end, we have been wearing masks as experts recommend. However, for more sporty situations we had wanted to  to wear a gaiter. Research indicates these are not a good idea. They are not protective enough and potentially break up droplets smaller and easier to spread. So we have avoided them. But with some outdoor activities we participate in (mainly water-based) where we can’t always be certain of others getting too close while needing to protect ourselves, I was looking at gaiters again.<br /><br />I was surprised and pleased to find this set: they include a spot to include a filter. This seemed to be a smart answer to what we needed.<br /><br />And they are the only ones to date I have found with a filter option.<br /><br />First, they arrive with two in each package for a total of 4. We like the 4 colors (white, black, blue, gray), but they are not the best in the world (designs can be cooler), they are nice. The colors are rich and full. We washed them after receiving them and they came out exactly the same - they even held their seems as if just ironed.<br /><br />The material is really nice: soft, silky, comfortable. It’s very comfortable to have on. It can get a little warm, but overall I think it’s a nice feel, something my wife seconds. There is a “tightness” to keep it secure, but nothing uncomfortable, and it lends itself to the ability of wearing it in a few different styles.<br /><br />Originally used for sporting (water-based, outdoors) we thought it would help us be outside in those endeavors where a mask doesn’t always work well. I think we were right.<br /><br />Keeping in mind they are not as ideal, we again preferred these having the filter option. There is a “pouch” or slot built Into one side , near the top. If you don’t want the filter, you don’t need it. There is no additional issue for breathing with or without it. Don’t want to use it? Turn it to the back.<br /><br />Using the filter - there are 6 included per package - you simply slide it in - on or off it’s easy to get or out. My only complaint or suggestion: this has both sides open and I’d do one side. That said, it appears it MIGHT be more difficult sliding in if only one side were open. It isn’t a huge deal, but yes, it can slip a little to one side or the other, but it did not come out. We’ve ordered a number of other filters (disposable) in order to use it as we need it.<br /><br />Overall this is a great gaiter and we are sure it’ll be perfect for our activities. Not sure how water will effect the filters - but we will have backups. Also no way to know if the filters are doing anything. but the added layer is better than without - again looking at current research.<br /><br />We are happy with these gaiters and the (provided) filters and are happy to recommend."
4.0,These fit well but maybe rough up the soles with some sandpaper before stepping onto a dance floor. :)
4.0,"I really liked these earrings, but they don't have a really long back the length of the earring so they are really tricky to get in my ears. Wish the backs were different, but the front is super cute!"
4.0,These were bought to straighten my slightly crooked glasses by counter weighing them with one of them placed on the right ear frame. I wear 54-18-140 prescription glasses with a wire frame.  they will fit sunglasses too. I did have to turn them pointy part up they dug into my ear i do have a large head so yeah..
4.0,"The only complaint i have is that the rubber is the slick rubber that glides too easily around on my glasses. Other than that, they look awesome and work well."
4.0,Looked good but rather warm to wear and hard to keep hair out of mouth
4.0,"I'm 70 yrs. old and had a hard time getting them on and off. when they're on, they are comfortable."
4.0,"I bought them for my son, I am guessing that they fit as I haven't heard anything"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:99a246c6558356e67531a918b6abf9c9]] I bought this in combo with one of the wallets that Lustear offers. My wife needed an &#34;everyday&#34; purse, so something that was able to withstand wear for a long time. The material isn't real leather, but it seems that it'll hold up to some good use for a long time. I'm certainly not an expert on purses, but at least the Mrs. likes it. :)<br /><br />I only gave it 4 stars because I am a Prime Customer and this item was a Prime product, however upon purchasing it I was told it would come a day later than promised. The order was fulfilled by Amazon, so nothing bad as far as the purse goes, just the Amazon delivery."
4.0,This is a very pretty dress with good quality fabric. It comes without the top (only 2 pcs.)! The only reason I only gave 4 stars is bc it runs large. I had to order a smaller size but other than that it is very pretty and I'm looking forward to rocking the Oktoberfest.
4.0,"I was not crazy about the color. I would have preferred black leather. But, after I received it, I saw that it is of quite good quality and works exactly as it is supposed to. It has quality soft brown leather, 6 brass key rings and one large removable ring. It also has pockets like a wallet for cash and credit cards, etc. I was extremely pleased with the bang for the buck of this product."
4.0,"It has a horrible smell that goes away after a week of air drying, besides that it’s really nice."
4.0,"It is thick, great for warmth❣  Fits nicely, size down and be in love🐻"
4.0,"I'm pretty happy with this purchase. These particular Chopper motorcycle sunglasses actually fit me well - most sunglasses are a little small on me (I'm a little over 6'0, 235 lbs)."
4.0,"These have a matte finish. I am 5'5&#34; 123 pounds and kinda curvy. They have to be pulled on like panty-hose. But once I had them up , they were perfect. The zipper ends at the bottom of my fibula. i can move easily in them. They are made well and I do not feel they will burst. There is a little looseness around my waist but I am glad because I won't have to limit what I eat."
4.0,Good quality. Much better than I had expected at the price. fits beautifully.
4.0,"Very nice shirt.  However, the length was longer than i thought. The length was just above my knees. It ended being a dress more than a shirt for me. And I'm 5'5! Still like this product though. :)"
4.0,Need to size up I'm a 38D and got a XXL. Super cute though.
4.0,Looks nice but I wish I ordered a size smaller than my normal size. But it's comfortable and pretty.
4.0,Very cute suit! I’m 5’5 130 lbs and I ordered a medium. The bottoms were a little small- so I paired it with another set I had at home.
4.0,"I bought this apron to use to wash dishes so that my clothes don’t get wet in the front. It is definitely not waterproof, or water resistant at all. It is made of some kind of woven material and water goes right through. So, I am deducting one star for incorrect description. I do like it, however, so I will wear it for cooking.  I was concerned that it would be too small based on other reviewers, but I found it to be the perfect size to cover my whole front side and the ties are quite long."
4.0,brighter pink than pictured. but love the fit of these bras
4.0,item as desribed
4.0,very cute....but ran a bit small.  i would order a size up next time!
4.0,"These gloves are very small I have small hands as I am a petite woman and they are a little tight on my hands .  they did arrive quickly.  Since I o,my need them for when I am in a store or public place I will keep them but if I need more I will order a larger size"
4.0,"It's cute but cheaply made. The globe won't stay in the stand, you can't tell when I wear it but it still makes me wonder how long before it breaks. It looks as pictured, those the binoculars do not stay up that high on the chain."
4.0,No Shoe Laces on Them!
4.0,Perfect for the gym. Lightweight and pretty breathable and with the adjustable band it stays put.  The only drawback is because it’s light weight it tends to stick to your face when you breathe in making it feel like it’s suffocating you. The fabric is like a very thin swimsuit fabric. Wicks away moisture too.
4.0,"I like it very much, Thank you!"
4.0,FIts as expected. It's a nice material. Well worth it
4.0,It was a gift for my mom and it was too long! Other than that it was perfect - sad it didn’t fit!
4.0,"Love this bathing suit. Fits perfectly, you definitely need to be taller that 5'8. I'm not but it still fits with no problem. It's long in the torso."
4.0,"I picked this up because they looked nice to me, and I have been looking for a pair of cuff links for awhile, but honestly I am not too impressed with the way they feel, it is not thing bad, they look like the picture, but the blue is a lot duller in my opinion. It arrived on time thou and it was well packaged.<br /><br />Disclaimer, I was given this product at a reduced price in exchange for an unbiased review of the product. I am not affiliated with the seller, or any other parties involved. I am merely given my honest opinion because I depend on others reviews when shopping around. All of the reviews performed by me are of my personal opinion and done with utter most respect toward the seller and other customers."
4.0,"Surprised at how beautiful this shoe is! A steal for the price. Unfortunately it has a very strong chemical smell though, I will be airing them out outside."
4.0,Nice headband. It feels cheap but it doesnt look cheaps! I bought it for a Halloween costume and it was perfect.
4.0,Very pretty but too large in my opinion.
4.0,"Update Edit: They have good customer service. Reached out to do exchange or refund. So that helps.  The mask is nice if you have a small face and are handy you can fix the ear straps to work.<br /><br />Extremely dissatisfied. Got the studded and zipper. Both are Ridiculously small and I usually wear medium mask size. No nose wire, so even it sat on face would not mold to nose well. The ear straps are crazy big and the “adjusters” will not stay in place.  Complete waste of money now especially to find out they aren’t returnable. Will have to craft with them to try to salvage something."
4.0,"Very cool! I got compliments on it all night the night I wore it.<br /><br />What's keeping me from giving 5 stars:-- It is large, which I expected from the reviews, but was still surprised HOW large. i have really thick hair so it still looked good, but beware if you have thin hair that lies close to your head. each of the leaves is at least an inch long, maybe an inch and a half. -- Your hair gets tangled in it if it is down. -- It is completely flat. Although easily bendable, this ear piece is completely flat which kind of negated the nature-y feel that I thought it would have. Still cute."
4.0,I Purchased this as a gift. Along with a book for snakes the perfect gift!
4.0,Super soft and fit as expected. Four stars because the decal has an odd grid visable in the dinosaur.
4.0,Perfect for laying around in or outside for about 50 degree weather (Iowa)
4.0,My daughter loves this dress. She’s typically a medium and that’s what we ordered but it fits her like a large. Material is very stretchy and the cut is adorable.
4.0,delivered as promised and fit well.
4.0,Fits as expected. Thinner side of fabric. Beautiful flowy unique look perfect for summer.
4.0,"It took forever to get here, other than that it's a pretty good quality bag for holding my laptop."
4.0,"All was packaged nicely but I chose the burgundy red and not the red, red so it had to be returned."
4.0,Nice belt. Wish the buckle was a little smaller.
4.0,I bought several of these. They fit great and okay on quality but definitely overpriced. Amazon Essentials are just as nice with better prices. I can get other great retailers much cheaper.
4.0,"well made,warm,good fit."
4.0,"The colors in the flowers are more orange than pink. Also, it runs small."
4.0,Good for putting in your pocket. Always nice to have when you need it. Do you know how to make them dance? Put a little boogie in them.
4.0,I ordered the large but it is a little tight. The fabric is thicker than I thought it would be and that is a plus. I do like the longer length.
4.0,"Good quality for a good price, unfortunately they didn't work for me"
4.0,"I have arthritis in one shoulder and bursitis in the other so it is difficult  to get a bra on even when snapping it in the front then turning it around. So I prefer just a shirt without bra, but that isn’t always modest ( for me) , so I wanted something to wear under my shirt. I got the 3XXX, thank goodness! I usually wear 1X this was still a little clingy but it’ll do. Also, maybe I didn’t look at all the angles of the shirt, but I didn’t realize it has a sport type back. But no biggy. It still serves the purpose I bought it for. The reason I got the 3XXX was because I used your size chart for guidance.....so thank you for that, otherwise I would have got a 1X and been unable to use this product. Can’t stand my clothes too tight!"
4.0,Good for the price very nice pieces...
4.0,The build quality was decent for the price. The goggles did not fog during a ski trip which lasted four days in 26-30C temps. I bought these as a replacement for a pair which was lost. I have never used yellow tinted googles for ski but purchased since I was expecting cloudy days during the trip and this tint was recommended. They performed OK but do not purchase this tint. Always go with darker rose tint- they work well on both cloudy and sunny days in the typical US ski spots. The main problem with these googles- and I have no proof -but.. I do not think the UV protection is adequate in the lens. I have never had my eyes hurt after a ski day. These googles made my eyes hurt. Like briefly looking a a welding arc... It may have been the tint but I dont know.<br />They are as advertised but I will not use them.
4.0,"Great dress, fits nice, fabric is nice for the price.  But, there is no under skirt, very see through."
4.0,"According to my measurements, I should've been a 10, but the 10 was too snug.  Aside from that, this is a very nice swimsuit.<br /><br />The &#34;Infinity&#34; color/pattern is gorgeous, though definitely more purple than the picture. The fabric drapes nicely, and the neckline is both flattering and comfortable. The wider straps with the T-back are more supportive and comfortable than a lot of swimsuit straps.<br /><br />My two biggest downsides:<br />One, I wish there was a little more support, or even push-up in the bra to make the girls a little more flattering.<br />Two there's no fitted/lining portion underneath, so if it floats up, your tummy is gonna show.<br /><br />I got it for a cruise the end of this Spring, so I haven't worn it yet.  I will update in a couple months once it's actually been put to the test.<br /><br />*Update*:  So I wore it on my cruise and I still love it.  The color stayed gorgeous and didn't run or fade, and fortunately I actually didn't have much problem with it floating up like I feared it would.  It fit well, looked good in photos, was comfortable, and I got quite a few compliments on it.  My one caveat is that the underwire can get a little &#34;off,&#34; so that it kinda poked me in one side.  It's a pretty hefty, blunt wire so it wasn't the stabby kind of poke like from a wonky bra, but it wasn't comfortable.  I'm leaving it at four stars though, because once I was aware of that and made sure it was shifted in the right spot when I put it on for the day, it stayed put.  I wore it basically all day for two days in a row, and aside from the initial poke, it was quite comfortable for all-day wear.<br /><br />*Second Update - 1 year later* I wore it on another cruise and this time went snorkeling, and if you're out paddling around a lot in the ocean the floating-up thing is a lot more of an issue.  In a pool or hot tub, or in calmer, shallower water it wasn't a big deal, so if that's something you're concerned about, plan accordingly."
4.0,"I ordered the rust color when ordering this sweater and it's just such a different, original color. It's in between red and brown and very unique. The sweater has dropped shoulders and is oversized but fit as expected. That material is very soft and comfortable and the sweater overall, is very well made. This has a turtleneck and nice knitted, warm feel to it. Overall, this sweater is worth the investment."
4.0,"35% cotton and 65% polyester chiffon. Looks exactly like the photo. It's definitely an asian knockoff BUT the price, the fit and overall look is perfect. I was hoping it wouldn't be a poly-blend but to be fair, i'm quite happy with it and will wear it asap."
4.0,"The dress itself is nice.  Well made, pretty colors.  I am not a huge fan of the shape, tho that’s a personal preference.  I wanted something looser, as i just had a baby and am carrying extra weight.  I’m currently 5’4 and 159lbs.  I typically wear a medium or small, when I’m 20lbs lighter, but this dress is a size large.  I feel like the dress does make me look bigger and boxier than i actually am.  It’s Accentuating my flaws.  For the right build, this would be a beautiful dress."
4.0,"If u want it to fit like the models order a larger size, if u want a form fitting dress order ur regular size, a bit see through but not too bad, nice fabric, nice style, all in all love it, and recommend it!!"
4.0,The frame is not very well made and they are very narrow. They are defiantly made for a small head.
4.0,"I like it. I wore it to tahoe in winter snow and it was good. The only issue I have with it is, it is tight to get my feet in when putting them on, there's a bit of a struggle to get it on."
4.0,"Loved the look of the band and how well it went with my watch, however I ordered this and because it said it fit up to 8.5 inch wrist. That was not true. The band fit tight and I actually am not using now. Would be perfect for someone with smaller wrists."
4.0,Bra was too big...but looks just as shown in the picture.
4.0,"Tad smaller than I expected, especially across the chest. The material was nice and the construction was solid. Something about it didn't wow me enough to make it worth trying a larger size."
4.0,"But it runs small. Maybe i just run too large, but the sizing is so different than U.S. sizes. So, it is destined for the charity box. I really wasn't a fan of the shelf top either. But someone who is smaller than I am will love this and look great in it. Just not me."
4.0,not crazy about the material
4.0,My granson loves it. He wears his Capn America mask and badge with it.
4.0,"LOVE the dress, but VERY see-through."
4.0,Cute and colorful. Very girly and the tie accentuates the waist. I get lots of compliments when I wear it. The only downside is that the fabric wrinkles incredibly easy. I've never had any garment wrinkle this much even with just slight handling and wearing.
4.0,"The style is sexy. My only gripe I have is the sole of the heels are actually soft-like material which makes walking on floors a bit tricky and slippery. After a couple of wears, the soft material came off bit by bit and started drags underneath my heels (like how toilet paper gets underneath your shoe)."
4.0,"Thinner than what I expected, but a lovely piece of blue lace agate with a slight chevron striping."
4.0,I bought these to wear to work and so far im very pleased. Comfortable and seems to hold up well.
4.0,I'll order more... So comfortable
4.0,"I bought these as a gift for a pre-teen. They are a great size for older child or adult. Very nice color. Just as described, just as pictured."
4.0,"This shirt is epic.  I needed a really great stage shirt, and this one is fantastic!  The feel of it is a little artificial (the only reason I gave it a four), but it will look great on stage."
4.0,Cute shirt. The pink is very bright.
4.0,Nice and roomy/
4.0,"I liked them better than I expected to.  I thought they'd look less like jeans and people would think I was wearing &#34;pajamas&#34; out - but no, they really do look like jeans, and they stretch nicely.  They're a little long but I'm shrinking, so...  I'm pondering buying a pair or two in other colors."
4.0,My husband was thrilled to receive this item as an early Christmas gift.
4.0,I have no comment. They were mailed to the grandkids
4.0,"Pretty much what I expected, but since I've only recently become a bit of a porker, a tad more latitude in the size would not be unwelcome. It's fine as is, but.........."
4.0,I love everything about this dress aside from the fat that it is pretty short. It's such a cute dress though and the pattern is great!
4.0,"This is a very pretty hat, color is great and I do like it. My head is a bit large so I was concerned about it covering my ears but this is large enough to do so. It works for winter and looks trendy and pretty at the same time. I gave it four stars because it took such a long time to arrive but I think that may be because its being shipped from China."
4.0,"Love feel and length.  I am a large and read a few reviews and went down to medium, my mistake.  Am ordering more styles from this company.  Going on a two week trip and these won't take much room in luggage."
4.0,Material could be better but a very nice look. I used it during league night and was comfortable and that you really need. Would be nice for a team shirt.
4.0,"The purse is the perfect size and color I was looking for. It shipped fast and was packaged nicely. The reason it did not get a 5 star rating is because as soon as I opened up the purse, all the beading came off!! I will have to reglue it back on!!"
4.0,"The glasses are amazing and when you put them on you can actually see a little bit clearer. Sun doesn't bother as much and youncould look at the sun directly for some seconds, even though you shouldn't do it even wity the glasses on.<br /><br />The reason I've given it 4 stars is because I've bought them a second time and even the second ones have the same problem: the little plastics that cover the legs slip too easily and you can lose them when you're not attentive, you have to use crazy glue so they can be ""fixed""."
4.0,Cute but not able to withstand a lot of pulling as the cords can easily come out of the connectors. Bought this for my 8 year old gymnast and she loved it.
4.0,"I would have given it a higher rating if the sleeves weren't so tight.  Any tighter, and I wouldn't have been able to get my arm in it.  I don't have large arms, but being older, I do have a bit of a bat wing.  I wish the sleeves were slightly larger."
4.0,Soooo cute...well made...warm
4.0,Like it very much - exactly like the picture.
4.0,Nice three piece set for adults or children 6 yrs or older.our family wore them to Disneyland. A nice touch with our Disney shirt attire!
4.0,I was pleased how it was packaged & they have vibrant colors nice to wear
4.0,Shorter then I preferred and the neck toe isn't adjustable. Otherwise pretty cute. Belt that came with it not shown but it looks good. I would buy again.
4.0,"This is a pretty color of a decent quality sweater.  The sweater is slightly itchy before washing but fine after.  The accent is actually a full lining of the inside, minus the sleeves which is really nice for warmth.  There are cute ties at the bottom sides.  It is a long length which is flattering with skinny jeans or leggings but may look shapeless without a tighter bottom.  The color is nice and rich.  It seems to wash well and appears sturdy.  The classic look would work for any age.  This is a great fall fashion staple, comfortable and stylish."
4.0,I find it strange that the Chrysalis name is not on the back  of the bangle. And the same with the other bangle that I ordered. I bought one at a jewelry store and &#34;chrysalis&#34; was engraved on the back. Are these knock-offs of the real Chrysalis?
4.0,Great for wearing at work
4.0,I love the look of this blouse.  The fit is a little big.
4.0,Sent me the wrong one with power. I gave it to someone else. Looks ok.
4.0,Adorable perfect for a dinner by the beach here in sunny Florida.
4.0,my husband loves dogs and loves to cycle-so these were perfect
4.0,"These shorts arrived today. Took about 3 1/2 weeks to get here.<br />Surprisingly, they fit pretty good. I like them."
4.0,"A,nice top although a bit smaller than the white one I got.  Have not worn or washed yet.  Hope it doesn't shrink as it will be too tight ."
4.0,"I really like this set. I have small arms and apparently a small head got a grown woman so all other kits I’ve tried previously have been too big. Since the gauntlets attach with straps they are perfect for smaller arms and the tiara comes with the elastic separately so you can adjust as needed or just pin to your hair.<br />The downfalls for me, the gauntlets are just plastic so if it’s hot at all your arms will sweat and there’s no escape short of taking them off, which is annoying. The tiara doesn’t sit flush against the forehead, but I would guess this could be fixed with spirit gum.<br />Overall, I love this set and would absolutely buy again."
4.0,"I like the fabrics used. The pants are soft and fuzzy, and the top is techier in a polyester. This is a Christmas present for my grandson, so I'll know more after Christmas. He's a slightly built six year old, and it can be hard to find a boys size 7. Size 8 is huge on him, and size 6 too small."
4.0,These sunglasses are a bit oversized on my face.  My face is average size oval.  They look good.  I got a few complements but they seem a bit too large for my taste.  They were very soothing to my eyes in the sunlight.
4.0,"when i got the product it was of course wrinkled. I washed the shirt in cold water and lined dried it. Still, wrinkles. Did this again, still wrinkles. Tried air dry on my dryer, still wrinkles. Got fed up, and the only thing that took the wrinkles out, was my iron. Never thought i would order a Nike shirt that the wrinkles would not come out. Will never order another Nike order from you or anyone else. This product quality sucked."
4.0,"He's not quite four and has a big foot.  Unfortunately, they need lots of wear to break them in, and he won't wear these shoes enough to fully break them in before he outgrows them.  That being said, for the time he has them, they're a better deal than paying $ to rent shoes for all the times we go bowling.  For that, it's a great deal even if it's not a perfect deal.<br /><br />We also needed to go online since the local pro-shop did not carry anything so small for purchase."
4.0,I am 5'6&#34; tall. All my weight is in the middle. Very nice fit however the cups in the chest are ridiculous. They are about the size if a silver dollar. I took them out and replaced them
4.0,Beautiful dress that can be worn casual or dressed up
4.0,"Bought these to go with a very casual Princess Leia costume and they worked.  They feel more like workout pants, which is how I'll wear them in the future.  They are soft and not see through."
4.0,"Medium weight nice cable knit. The open turtle neck lies well. The back lands right below the rear. I had to return because the neck was too warm, it would be perfect for colder weather."
4.0,"I really like these sunglasses.  I wear them while driving,  really cut the glare."
4.0,"Very cute.  I got so many compliments on this skirt.  If you Are hippie you will have to pull it over your head,  that wasn't an issue for me I was able to manage without pulling it over my head.  But it was close. Overall I  Loved it."
4.0,They are holding up.  Came fast as indicated!  Thanks!
4.0,"It's smaller than I thought it would be, but it still fits."
4.0,was a gift for my cousin who loves H2O! Wish it actually came in the H2O packaging.mine came in a small blue box..She loved the gift anyways though! overall good product.
4.0,"it is a very lovely tunic/dress. But I actually bought 2, the white fit perfectly, but the black was tight!"
4.0,These are not exactly meant for busty gals. Love the idea and material but just did not work as they should have for me.
4.0,Not bad for the price. I am happy with my order.
4.0,Loved the silicon tunnels! Only problem is that I couldnt screw the tunnels on and it irritated my ear there fore making me dislike the tunnels.
4.0,"Love the style - material is quite light so perfect for spring/summer.<br />And when one got lost, seller replaced - which was very nice."
4.0,"I love this watch ,but I have had trouble the last year or so with the watch dropping behind in time. I replaces the battery thinking that was the problem, but still losing time. It seems like the way I hold my wrist at work for a period of time .  If you don’t mind resetting your watch ever so often it is a good watch. The look is great but the band does begin to fade also. I am going to have to find another watch with better time result.<br /><br />Update on watch.  The watch is working good. Found out the crown is the problem. It comes out when I put gloves on when I give shots. So the time piece seems to be good. Just seems to go through batteries."
4.0,"sandal not as soft and comfortable as the pair I had to replace, but it still provides the nonslip in my shower that I was wanting. Hence the 4 rating"
4.0,Very pretty watch band but the rose gold will fade and you will get the the Stainless steel that will leave a green band around your wrist
4.0,"Very comfortable fit.  I have very sensitive ribs and this feels comfortable, adequate coverage and support for very low impact day to day needs."
4.0,"I love the look and it was way cheaper then 18 dollars on another website, only thing i didnt like was that it gets tangled so easily"
4.0,I love this company dresses but this one was a little off in size around the breast area
4.0,"While these earrings are beautiful, they are so big! I can't wear this around on a regular day without people wondering what the occasion is. It's definitely beautiful though and well worth the price! Just make sure you understand how big it is. See the measurements they have given? Just take out a ruler and see how big that actually is. Will help you make better decision about any earring.... In the case, you think the size is good for you, go for these earrings. You can't really go wrong for this price!"
4.0,Love this dress. Wore it to an outdoor reunion. People complemented me about the style a color!
4.0,"A lot smaller than expected, won't fit crystals over about an inch. It is very cute notheless, it goes well with my other crystal pouch necklace."
4.0,They work great for using my phone.  The only reason I didn't give a 5 is because they don't keep my hands as warm as I'd like.
4.0,Comfy for toddlers!
4.0,Didn't fix as easily as the straps in swatch shops. But it works.
4.0,Fit my usual size. It is very pretty and will be a versatile piece thru spring and summer.
4.0,A little bit cheap looking but totally worth the price. I would definitely buy again!
4.0,I thought these we're grey and light pink by the photo.  They came in and they are grey and white instead so I'm dissapointed but other than that they're great pants.<br /><br />A little low riding and I'm a small girl but laying down I gotta make sure my butt isn't hanging out a little.  :)
4.0,I enjoy these sunglasses. One minor issue is that they're a bit non-sturdy (easily bent frames).
4.0,"Cheap but quality rings, only issue is the clasp is a little tight and hard to maneuver as I have a small nose."
4.0,"I bought these to run in but I like them alot, so often wear them as a layer under sweaters indoors. Comfy, cosy and colourful."
4.0,Nice dress If it would have been in size medium
4.0,Beautiful Mittens.  The red is actually maroon though.  Don't try to match it with a red jacket.
4.0,Love the purse somewhat small inside though.
4.0,"I really like this tank.  It's longer (which I like since I'm tall), it has pockets on the sides.  Color is nice.  I do agree that it is thin- I need to wear a cami underneath to not see my bra through it.  I could see how it might snag easily and will need to be washed gentle cycle or hand wash to maintain integrity.  But, overall it's nice and does it's purpose.  Great with shorts, jeans, leggings."
4.0,"Somewhat small, but not too small that they hurt your feet. Order them a size larger than your original shoe size, and you should be good to go. I really like the style of those boots and the zipper makes it easy to take them on/off. For me they were a great buy!"
4.0,Looks just as pictured. Good length
4.0,I wanted one to be at least 2x’s larger
4.0,"Dress was Beautiful. I Love the pockets on the dress. Only reason I gave a 4 star is because the waist sits high, and I'm not a huge fan of high waist dresses. But it was still cute."
4.0,TOO LARGE FOR A SMALL BABY.  GREAT-GRANDDAUGHTER IS 6 1/2 MO OLD AND SLIPPER IS TOO LARGE.  WILL PROBABLY FIT IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS.
4.0,I ordered a maroon red and turned out to be a different shade entirely. Like that pink purple color which I kinda hate.
4.0,"dry fit material, light and flowy. see through but there are shorts with pockets underneath!"
4.0,They are good quality pearls and earrings but they were too large for me. I am a very petite person so the 10mm look comically large on me.
4.0,Did not enclose filters as indicated
4.0,Nice trunks. Probably better to wear under board shorts.
4.0,Great shoe. My son can wear these throughout most of the school year.
4.0,This bag is amazing and it's very functional and I love all the pockets.
4.0,Daughter love it for her 13th birthday
4.0,I like the product but wish I would have bought a size smaller. Because it doesn't really compress my stomach. But good for working out.
4.0,"Good solid glove.  Fit is a little big compared to gloves I buy, and I have settled on gloves that come in half sizes when I can find them to dial in the perfect fit.  I have medium hands that are slim, and if I had beefy medium hands, these would likely work great.<br /><br />Ended up returning, as I have enough work gloves and these just did not fit me personally well enough to keep in rotation."
4.0,"Absolutely perfect. When I see prices that are low I often wonder about the quality. I was looking for some cute stocking stuffers and these just fit the bill. That are a good quality and just to warn you... They run a tad small... But I'm a size 7 and they fit perfect. The colors don't match the ones in the picture... But they do say it's a random assortment. I received a decent selections of colors: brown, purple, teal, and black. I hope this helps"
4.0,Very comfortable and cute but runs smalls
4.0,"Love this dress, it's so pretty and so flattering. Only thing is it's a little small if you are larger chested. The cinched area might only cover your breasts rather than going down to your waist which is what I would have wanted. I still wear it though, got lots of compliments!"
4.0,"I have done an extensive search of morganite jewelry, and have found that many items are out of my price range. Morganite is very expensive compared to other stones! After purchasing a reasonably priced ring, I began looking for a bracelet. This one is very pretty, pairs well with my ring, and is a great value!"
4.0,Very cute dress. Fits nice. Feels like a cheaper/lighter fabric but otherwise looks great.
4.0,"Have one in grey, black and now green; black sweater is a true lint and hair magnet, so cannot be worn in public; heathered colors are much more becoming; nice front drape; overall, great to wear."
4.0,"A little awkward to get on, but once they are they look just like the picture.  I definitely think they are worth what I paid for them."
4.0,I really like the way these boots look and feel on.  The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is because it states that something in the product they are made of violates California proposition 65.  That means there is something in them that is harmful ie contains cancer causing properties or can cause birth defects etc. It only states that for the cognac colored ones for some reason so I would guess it's in the dye.<br /><br />But I wear them with heavy socks and jeans so I feel there probably is not much of a risk.
4.0,"It's cute, but if you have a belly at all it will rest on it on a potentially unflattering way. I am keeping mine as a nightgown though bc it's so comfy!"
4.0,I love my yoga pants! They fit just right & stay put while working out!
4.0,So tight! I would size up. I wear a small in everything and this was way too tight on my arms and chest area. It did look good though and I liked the fabric
4.0,Cute. I liked these for the price. The waist band isn’t my favorite but it’s not too bad!
4.0,runs about one size small
4.0,"I like the style. I have skinny legs with a larger waist so the sheer part was baggy on me in a Large. I think if the sheer part had been more stretchy, I would have loved them."
4.0,Beautiful on! Very comfortable!
4.0,"I am 5'7 about 175lbs and at first I loved these for working out. One day as I was putting them on my nail went straight through the upper thigh and then there was a huge hole that grew larger as I was working out. The quality was good at first then after you wash it, it went down hill from there."
4.0,ok..nice color for summer
4.0,It is fair quality.
4.0,"The dress is a little bit to small, but I purchased the green and I love it. The dress flows. It is a great dress that accents the shape of the body! I love it!"
4.0,It's a little intimidating.  It really does hold you in.  Maybe it is really just shifting the fat around.  We'll see how long I can tolerate it
4.0,"I love pants like these cause they’re stretchy and comfortable while looking really nice, I just was expecting the pair i chose to be more purple instead of very pink, but the difference in color aside im pleased with my pants"
4.0,I like the band. I'm very active and it does loosen a little at times.
4.0,My 14 year old daughter wanted to be Evie for Halloween. She is 5 feet tall and 100 lbs and we purchased the “9-10 year old” size. It is a perfect size for her. The wig is low quality and sheds bad so we didn’t use it.
4.0,Really like it..but end up being short.but its a good design and really hope i got a longer one at least under my knees
4.0,Cute but much much smaller than I expected. They would have a little more  impact if they were a tad larger. I love the color.
4.0,Very nice rain boots but unfortunately they were too big for my granddaughter and I had to return them. Looked to be good quality and was quick delivery.
4.0,I just love this little black bird necklace. I get so many complements and people ask me where did I get it from every time I wear it. I really like birds and was blown away when I found this. I like to wear it when I'm in a mood to go to the book store.
4.0,Material is thin but soft and comfortable
4.0,"I'll probably enjoy this NATO strap while it's still new. I've noticed the holes can get easily frayed. It also picks up lint around that area. Aside that, the strap is super comfortable! I love that it's not as bulky; the buckle and the silver free lop has a nice finish to it. I'll be enjoying it until the holes are completely frayed out!"
4.0,"On time, comfortable. It's a bit big, not sure how convincing it may be, but could serve as a great stand-in while on vacation!"
4.0,"On time, look great."
4.0,"It was just a little too short, but it's very cute and I love it."
4.0,Product is fine but 1 pant had a big rip along the seam. I can fix it but it’s annoying.
4.0,only complaint is the thong broke and I had to buy again.
4.0,I like them they're comfortable.
4.0,"I like the color of the face of the watch, but to me it doesn't feel like a wooden watch just has the look of it."
4.0,The ring is beautiful and fits true to size. I just received it today so I can't say for sure how great the quality is or if it will turn my fingers green but at first glance I am very satisfied with my purchase.
4.0,"Pockets are awkwardly placed and gape open. It fit and looked great once I cut them out and sewed shut. A bit annoying but for $10-ish, worth it."
4.0,"Cute shirt! It’s a bit big all around... the collar is a bit wide, making the pocket in a slight weird place. The material is kinda thin, and makes my boobs and tummy look kinda funny (you can tell in the pics) but overall it’s still a cute shirt and I would recommend it!"
4.0,Looks good so far!!!!
4.0,"Lovely scarf. Very nice , bright colors and  attractive pattern. Worth the money."
4.0,"This is made with quality fabric and the design is good.  The fit was way larger than expected.  If I were to buy this again I would buy two sizes smaller.  I bought a 10, I should have purchased a 6 or smaller. I returned it."
4.0,"This is a really nice sweatshirt. Fit is good, material is comfortable, shrinkage in the wash was minimal (but apparent), overall I rate it a 4/5 star sweatshirt.<br /><br />Two downsides to my experience with the &#34;Black Heather&#34; XXL.<br />First of all, it's not &#34;Black Heather&#34;, it's grey. It's one solid color all the way through, not a heathered black which would mean the fabric is both black and white(r). Unfortunate, as the black heather would have been a lot nicer looking. However, grey is fine (I just wouldn't have paid the premium for it - as the different colors are priced differently according to popularity).<br /><br />Next, there's shrinkage. I'm quite tall and wear an XXL. I need it both for width and for length. Ideally I often order an XXLT, or sometimes just an XLT. This sweatshirt fit fine when tried on out of the box. I feared shrinkage, washed it cold, dried low heat, and it didn't seem much different. Arm length is still good, width is still fine. The only problem is the length. It shrunk upward. It's still a good sweatshirt, but note that it's going to be one of those &#34;I can see your belt&#34; high risers."
4.0,Exactly what I was wanting for my daughter and the sizing fit perfect
4.0,"Really likes em', her daughter almost fought over the teal color!"
4.0,"Super cute/roomy purse.  I love the way it looks and is practical for my use.  There are only 2 reasons why I can't give it a full 5 stars:<br /><br />1.) It's pretty uncomfortable to wear as an arm bag for more than like 10 minutes.  I'm an arm bag girl so this is disappointing.  I refuse to wear it out if I know I won't be able to put it down, which is a shame because it's so purdy and matches a lot of my outfits.  Which brings me to reason #2.<br /><br />2.) Because of above reason, even though I HATE side strap purses/sling purses/whatever, I love this purse and knew I could adjust the extra strap it comes with to hopefully a small enough setting to my length standard.  Unfortunately, I can NOT figure out how to attach it.  There's 2 obvious connecting rings on the bag itself, but on the strap there's only 1 clip.  I've played/stared at this thing for awhile and I just can't figure it out, unless I got a defective one.  OR I'M A COMPLETE DOOF :D"
4.0,material is a little cheap but still looks great I bought a 2x since the material is not stretchy and it fits good. I am 5 ft 5 in and 195 lbs
4.0,"Very cute, not my style.  Considering its size it would not hold as much as you would think.  I am 5'5&#34; and the purse dwarfs me.  I returned it becaue I will never use it."
4.0,"size s, I wear m.  But the minus is that the sleeves are long (you need to roll them up inside)"
4.0,These joggers are well made and durable as well as comfortable. They are true to size. I really like the high waisted ruffle detailing which makes these joggers unique from anything I have in my closet. .
4.0,"For the money, these sunglasses look good and are relatively comfortable. They look just slightly cheaper than I'd expected, and I really wish they had used a darker tint - but overall I can't really complain. Solid value."
4.0,Super cute. Thin material. Arrived super fast.
4.0,I like the quality and material of the band. It fits in perfectly into my Apple Watch 4. The only shortcoming is the length of the band. I have medium size wrist but this band is barely fits around it.
4.0,I was surprised how realistic this bracelet looked. The clasp is a little bit flimsy and should be tweaked.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:6850a30cb8bd7d7390e0053a6d0ade56]] It’s a bit long for my 5’3 frame but not too long to be uncomfortable.  I love this set, I even bought it in 2 different colors. I got a Large btw"
4.0,Short but perfect for a cover up!
4.0,"Very comfortable. Fits well, true to size<br />Fabric is a little thin, colors are nice.<br />Cool."
4.0,this pant would be easy to use in summer heat even though full length. ....very breathable and comfortable.
4.0,I have completed a few reviews - I do like the dress
4.0,It fits as I expected.  It does allow water into the edges except the top of the face.  I bought it to avoid losing my hair color in the pool. It works for the top of my hair so I'm ok with it.
4.0,These are great ear plugs. I use when I am working from home to sort of drown out the other noises. I have also used for shooting under my headphones. I am smaller in stature and the headphones sometimes slip down off my head so these help - I haven't tried wearing solo for shooting as the guns are loud but I think they would be fine. I really am thrilled with the noise cancellation on these. Disclaimer: I received a discount on the product for my honest and unbiased review.
4.0,Granddaughter is pleased with these socks.
4.0,Lovely Variations in the stone. Very appropriate size for me. I would prefer the sellers to  simply send the pendant by itself - the chain that it comes with us  cheap looking and one  that I will not use.
4.0,"This is a super cute cover-up! I am 5'6&#34; 130lbs and wearing a size medium.<br /><br />PROS: The cover-up is light-weight and airy - perfect for hot days. It laundered well (machine washed & tumled dry) and looks super cute. The fit is great - I knew I'd be between a small and a medium and I ordered up because I wanted it to be loose.<br /><br />CONS: The material is not bad, but could be softer.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Nice dress.... was great for a date night.
4.0,"I purchased this to wear around the house or to bed. It fits nice and is very comfortable, I wish it didn’t flare out so much towards the bottom based on my body shape, but it is very comfortable and pretty."
4.0,"I really liked the dark teal, good for summer and fall. I also love how versatile the dress is-it can be used for both casual and dressy occasions."
4.0,Smaller than expected and presetation could have been better.
4.0,It has velcro strap however the lace opens every now and then even if you tie with mighty force. Lace should have been flat.
4.0,"Absolutely beautiful but had to return because it was too large. I turned it in for the mini, which is a normal size purse. This is more like a large tote."
4.0,We will see how long these last. They fit of course; many of my previous purchases of other brands have died after ten washings.
4.0,"I ordered the XXL because they were out of the XL.  It fits me okay.  But, I expected it to be extra roomy.  If I really needed an XXL, this would have been tight.  Sleeve length was okay."
4.0,"Very thick and warm sweater that’s only 5% itchy. I wore this while walking the kids to school and carrying my coffee. My non-moving coffee arm got a little itchy from being in the same position too long, but I wouldn’t say the sweater is itchy in general. Nice deep wine color that compliments most skin tones.<br /><br />Im 130lb and pretty short. 5’2, 35/26/38 and the small fit well but didn’t have the drapey look of the model. If you want something more flowing you may want to size up, but I found this to be very true to size.<br /><br />Washes and steams well."
4.0,Gets snagged pretty easily but otherwise looks nice on.
4.0,It appears that this tie will hold up.  kj ;a sf kj;s ja  ;d;l sk d;a sd kjf ;a sjf;
4.0,"Good shirt....A bit tight in chest/shoulders though so watch for that. I ordered the Medium and it worked well...I am a 36B/C and I have broad shoulders and small waist. Besides the shoulders, the shirt was slightly baggy but that doesn't bother me."
4.0,I like the Purple color 💜 everything came amazing the only this I didn't like flashlight and alarm didn't work. I don't know how to fix that but anything else was nice
4.0,I've used the sweatshirt a few times and so far it's been comfortable and warm. I bought it for when i'm out hunting for hours with very little movement and so far it's kept me warm on mornings when it gets down to 20°.
4.0,"It's a little bigger than I anticipated, but it works perfectly. The design does exactly what it's supposed to, and I haven't had any leaks. I can put oil exactly where I need to, and control the amount of oil that's used. It's a LOT better than the pour method, which usually winds up getting oil on the outside of the vial, and is much more difficult to control how much oil is used. The base is big enough that it can comfortably stand upright. I can take the vial off my keychain, administer oil, then set the vial aside while the ordinance is performed. Once that's done, I can re-attach the vial to the keychain and we're done. The only potential issue I can see is losing the rubber stopper that fits under the cap. If it came with one or two extra stoppers, that would be great."
4.0,"When reading size options, it’s really tough to envision just how big these things truly are. I got 18g thickness and would get 20ga if available.  The 6mm is best for tots and 7mm for small kids. My tween g-daughter with thicker lobes and myself with thin lobes for the second piercing both need 8mm for a hoop that will look balanced yet still be quite small.  These are challenging to get lined up and inserted mostly because of the curve. Quality seems average."
4.0,"This dress is beautiful but I found it ran large. I wear a medium (5'4 145 lbs) and the medium was too large in the waist area, with extra fabric. I returned it and got the small and it was a perfect fit, even a little extra room in that."
4.0,Loved it .. i bought it so i can wear it at the beach and take lots of good fun photos! .. it comes with a fabric case to protect
4.0,Perfect for the HuTao costume but my God they smell like chemicals and cigarettes. I had to leave them outside for weeks and could smell them a month later.
4.0,"It looks authentic enough. It fits on my head However, the biggest issue is being able to see out of the eyes. I'm just not used to seeing out of the mask's nostrils."
4.0,"Bought this belt in June of 2018. Buckle has held up and with over a year's worth of wear, it has only one small scratch. The belt itself is starting to fall apart but for the price it can't be beat. Unlike other ratchet belts I've had, this one actually holds tight to the belt. Other belts I'd have to cut a little off the belt and re-attach the buckle to the strap every 3-4 weeks. I haven't had to do that yet with this one. If the belt quality/durability was a bit better, I'd give it 5 stars."
4.0,Painful to walk on but super cute.
4.0,"only needed the eyelet you turn, all three of my shades have broken in the Arizona sun, needs to be of better quality other than plastic."
4.0,Love this hat. It fits the circumference of her head well (she's 9mo) but has lots of space on top. I'm sure she'll grow into it. The design is super cute and I'm very happy it covers her ears.
4.0,Had given these socks as a gift and recipient was very well received.
4.0,Dress fits nice but quality is a little cheap and very thin.
4.0,Am very pleased with this item. For the price it is very pretty. I have ordered other dresses that were cheap on other sites and was very disappointed they were shirts not dresses. I am 5'7 and it fits like a dress. Would recommend for any beach or casual wear.
4.0,"This is a nice dress, I just wasn’t thrilled with the way it looked on me so I returned it. I’m 5’2, 125, 32D and ordered a size small. It fit well and looks like the picture. Material was nice enough for the price."
4.0,Great wig for one night. I just had to style it with some gel and a comb.
4.0,These are very cute and sweet ! I bought these for my 10 year old daughter and 9 year old niece and they love them..The are cheaply made but what do you except for the price you pay..you do get your money's worth so over all its a great product for the money you pay .
4.0,"I ordered this Ocean Blues women triangle bikini top halter bathing suit for our daughter and she really likes it. She says it fits her really good as expected, cute and comfortable to wear.<br />She loves the simple design of the bikini, and it gives a good amount of coverage and a lot of support. She says that one can also adjust both the straps which was very helpful to her. She says there is a lot of padding which isn't removable but it does prevent the top from being seen through. The padding of the bikini seems to be made of good quality material; as the material is 84% nylon and 18% spandex. She likes that she got the white color of this bikini but she definitely wants to purchase the pink one as well. The picture of the white bikini that the model is wearing appears to be grey in the photo but it was white in color when we received it. Overall this is a good bikini top for the price point."
4.0,Expected a closer fit.
4.0,"I ordered these to wear under open knit sweaters and blazers, and I think they are really cute for that purpose. But these camis wrinkle easily... even right out of the dryer. Plus these tops are thin/see through and I can see my bra lines under them when I look closely. Overall, they're a nice set but not great. I personally wouldn't buy them again."
4.0,"This dress is super comfy...the straps are flimsy though.  I bought it in the black with white polka dots and the white, I returned the white as it was too see through for me but I'm overweight and very self conscious.  If you're thin and more outgoing than myself you could pull it off.  Overall very happy with my purchase.  As I said before I'm overweight (5'8&#34; 200lbs)so I bought the xl and really could've gone with just the large.  It's almost too big around armpit area.  Might just buy the navy in a large I like the feel of the dress so much.  The pockets are nice but could've been placed a little higher for my liking to use them you kind of have to slouch you shoulders which is never attractive."
4.0,"I normally wear a large/14 but ordered an XL based on the size guide and I’m glad I did as it fit perfectly. However, the material is pretty thin and spandex-like so it shows off all of your chubby spots. If you’re one of the lucky people that don’t have that concern, you will love this dress. It’s super stretchy and feels like it could snag really easily, so becareful if you’re wearing a belt or necklace. But bottom line I love this dress and received a ton of compliments on it when I wore it for Halloween. I’m planning on getting a petticoat to wear under it as I think making the skirt fuller would be so cute and I want to order one of their Christmas dresses too."
4.0,Very soft!!! Just got plain black and they were a little tight but i still wear them.
4.0,Great look. Decent sound. I was a little skeptical at first. But I am really impressed at the quality of the product. It's definitely a great buy for a great price.
4.0,"This is a review of the size Large-X-Large sock, my shoe size is 9.5 wide to 10 wide.<br />1. Comfort is excellent.<br />2. Compression is excellent, all swelling is gone.<br />3. Durability, I can't speak to, I haven't washed the socks yet. Will update later.<br />4. Easy on/off is a joke, this is by far the hardest compression sock that I own to put on/off.<br />5. Copper infused???  I've always thought that this is gimmick, but something is defiantly going on, because the fronts of both of my leg's ""tingle"" when I'm wearing these socks, might just be pulling my leg hair, but after only wearing for 2 days, the dark spots (behind the tingling) seem to be fading. Also, will update later.<br />6. Sock is very thin, should be comfortable in warmer weather, but expect to need to wear a thicker over-sock for outdoor use in the winter.<br />7, The socks for me (I'm 5'9"") are a little long, I need to roll down the tops to keep them from binding at the back of my knees, this hasn't caused any irritation or discomfort.<br />Update on 1/18/23.<br />Durability sucks, (black color) one sock ripped a huge hole in it, I noticed in the reviews that all the pictures of socks that have holes in them are black, sent my black pair back, exchanged for white, just received the white pair, no copper color is visible in the white socks like it was in the black pair. will update again after I've had a chance to wear the white pair a few times, hopefully the white holds up better.<br />Dark spots on my legs have continued to fade, but I'm thinking that must be due to better blood circulation from the compression, I have 3 different brands of compression socks, so the Copper fit pair is only worn a third of the time."
4.0,A nice little convenient card holder. I can't say too much about the quality as I have only had it for a short time. I will update if it falls apart.
4.0,"nice appearance, and no one will know it is not solid gold without testing it, but my husband got it at the end of April and today is July 4 and some of the gold coating is wearing off already, he wears it to work every day and he's a salesman so he isn't exposing it to elements or anything like that, he thinks just putting his arm on sales counter repeatedly while working a register has rubbed it off"
4.0,"These are thin socks, which is a good thing with some shoes. However, they run very small. I wear a women’s 8.5 shoe and these are borderline too tight, pulling against my toes, which I abhor. I would think these would better fit women with shoe sizes 7 and under. That said, these socks seem decently made, have a band around the instep and arch that seems to give some support and makes the fit nice and snug there. Overall, these are socks that I would like if they fit looser around my toes. These will definitely be too snug for many. Too bad! They’re a nice thickness. The yellow against the black is a rather neon, which suits some outfits and not others.<br /><br />Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

4.0,"My son loves his new amoung us sweater. It's fun, but does run big."
4.0,"Tight fit. Wish they came  in sm, med, large rather than sm/med or lg/xlg.  I would have definitely ordered a medium."
4.0,"Once on it fits like a chArm. Love how quickly it dries and how comfortable it seems to be. Didn’t give it five stars Becaue the opening for the head not big enough, although it does go it is a bit of a struggle .<br />Other than that I love how it looks and how comfortable my daughter seems to be. I bought 2-3 yr when my daughter was 18 mos and it fit, now she is almost two and it still fits fine, she fits sized one up of her"
4.0,"Nice and Sparkly, but backs easily bent. Packaging was tricky to open & get earrings & backs out safely. Used as gifts at a tea party."
4.0,Very comfortable headsets I sleep with them on every night listening to Hemisync
4.0,"As described, A little small for my head"
4.0,"This is a super cute dress and my daughter loves it. It is a little long on her but not too bad. I give it 4 stars because the actual quality of the dress lacks a little. Other than that, I'm happy with my purchase."
4.0,It was a cup to small for me but great price. It will be gifted.
4.0,Loved everything about these pjs.  They got 4 stars because the top seemed to fit smaller than the bottoms.
4.0,I have not worn this necklace yet.  It is nice to have something other than gold or silver to wear.
4.0,This ring is very pretty and dainty. The only thing I have a problem with is the stones are not stationary. They spin in the settings and make nervous wearing it too often. I will save it for special occasions.
4.0,"The hat is really cute. It fits snug. It is a bit small but I had no issues with the hay falling off. I wore it in a windy day in San Francisco, hay stayed on the whole time. I got lots of compliments"
4.0,"I really love this top! It’s very flattering and has nice soft material. However it fit small on me. I am 120lbs and ordered a small, and it fit very snug. It was not loose at all like the picture. I will be exchanging for a bigger size because I feel that if I wash it, it may not fit at all."
4.0,"ordered black, got green"
4.0,"The dress fits as expected. I wear a size 14. I am a 40DD. I am 5’7” and 195lbs. I ordered an XL. The dress fits well. The one thing that was challenging about this dress was stringing the corset. That took awhile to do. However, it does make the dress very cute. The colors definitely match the image in the ad. The red is deep and beautiful. I do wish the corset ribbon matched the dress a little better. All in all, the dress is a good quality and I would still recommend it."
4.0,"Very happy with this purchase! The watch came in perfect condition and working 100%. I just wanted a cheap watch that was cool to look at so I got this watch as more of a novelty item than anything, but I definitely will wear it proudly because it is so neat!<br /><br />You can tell the watch was assembled in some what of a rush and after closely examining the watch you can tell some of the parts are of lesser quality, but other than a few very minor imperfections nothing to complain about!<br /><br />Nothing I'd brag about owning but definitely cool to show off!"
4.0,I ended up returning this as it was to small but it was a nice skirt. If I was a few sizes smaller I would have kept it. The length was good and the fabric felt nice.
4.0,These definitely keep your feet warm. You can wear them without socks but if you do your feet might sweat. They are very cozy and cute! I love them!
4.0,they fit a little close to the face but over all the are worth the money for sun readers
4.0,The ankle bracelet is charming. Fit's well although the chain is thin.
4.0,I sized up from L t ok XL...it fits perfect as a L (eventhough is a XL)
4.0,"RUNS LARGE, but nice shorts!"
4.0,"It's almost perfect. It's maybe 2-3 inches longer than I wanted, and a slightly brighter red than would be perfect, but otherwise exactly what I wanted.  The elastic waist band is very nice and comfortable."
4.0,Arrived on time and my mom loved it. It does not look cheap considering the price for the set and is great for accessorizing for parties.
4.0,The watch is great value for the price. It’s an icon and can be beat without guilt.
4.0,"Really cute design and seems comfortable.  I bought this for me and my husband to match a similar set from Hanna Andersen to coordinate with my sister's family for the holidays.  That company doesn't offer larger sizes and my husband is almost 6'8&#34; and wears a 2X, so it was nice to have larger sizes available from this company.  The design matches almost perfectly and were far more reasonably priced.  Overall, I'm happy with this purchase and hope we get many happy holiday uses from them.  They seem a bit stiff, but will likely soften up after washing."
4.0,Shorts a baggy Harlem type. The tank top is a little snug and my son isn't a chubby baby.
4.0,Bought for a costume and will do the job greatly!
4.0,"I love this tank! If I had lived closer to the bookstore I would have gone there, but now being out of town this was a great option. It's a little more vintage looking than the picture (think slightly faded writing). I usually wear between a medium and a large- the large is a little tight on me."
4.0,I got these lost time But I ended up losing them. So impressed just waiting on my new set.
4.0,"Love the material of the dress, doesn’t fit tight whatsoever."
4.0,Socks should be larger!
4.0,Im a guy.<br />Why the hell did i buy this???<br />Its a good product tho
4.0,"It fits. It works. It also tends to slip after a while. Easy to re-adjust, but a little annoying. Price is great, so all is forgiven."
4.0,Nice thought it was bigger
4.0,With the prices and comfortablity shoes are nice and do the job as says
4.0,A little tight on the top but not bad. Fits well and is decently comfy
4.0,"Good quality material, great coverage for face from sun and quick dry. The small size was still large for me and I just tie my hair in pony tail to hold hat in place better."
4.0,"They have cushion around the heel which is very nice.  The grey color will go with a lot.  My daughter has a very thin foot, so the shoes are a bit loose on her because the lace only tightens them some, but as far as size goes, I think they run true."
4.0,I am happy with this dress overall! It's low cut which I wanted. The top fabric is a little thin but not horribly so.
4.0,Bought for work boots on the farm and wanted the boots to be stirrup safe in the saddle.  100% satisfied on both counts.<br />Comfort insoles and good support contribute to the satisfaction.
4.0,"This argyle sweater is cute. Very soft, comfortable, and nice fit, but I wish it was more cropped. Overall, nice sweater vest!"
4.0,Light weight forgiving
4.0,"Perfect.  Granddaughter  is just learning to walk. She has tiny feet and it is difficult to find walking shoes, not crib shoes,  for her tiny feet. These are perfect. Not too heavy and they are flexible."
4.0,It only came with obe earring and some beads missing.
4.0,"These are ok, they are a little to tight for my liking and makes it hard to breath. Fabric moves in and out when you breath. Not something I will wear as a facial covering but maybe hair accessories. BeSt for smaller headed people."
4.0,"Beautiful, I love the lace, but the seam under the rump was bothersome and drew the eyes."
4.0,The ears have a bobby pin style hair clip instead of a spring loaded one making it more difficult to get the ears exactly where you want them and firmly mounted.<br /><br />other then that they seem to be made well and they look good.
4.0,IT broke tho  ;  (
4.0,The material is thin like a shirt not thick like a sweater. But it's cute with leggings. I ordered a small and it fits really big.
4.0,This is a fun purse to bum around with.
4.0,A little on the smaller size but they may stretch out over time.  Very cozy and comfortable.  However the color is brighter purple rather than burgundy like the picture.
4.0,Cute style..reasonable price. Material is a bit rough so my daughter complains they hurt her feet.
4.0,"Loved these shoes, but they were snug around the toes.  I ordered an 8 1/2. When I went to order a 9, they weren't available.  Cute shoes to wear with pants.  Wish they had them in the next size up."
4.0,"The shirt itself is lovely, but the size I selected (6) ended up being too large for me, and the sleeves were too short. I would gladly exchange it for a smaller size, but the sleeves would be even shorter. The only other facet of the shirt that I did not particularly care for was that the crochet portion dangled at the ends. It looked lovely on the ladies who displayed pictures in the reviews, and the quality was not bad at all for the price. It just didn't fit me right."
4.0,They were big for my toddler but perfect for the 5 and 9 year old
4.0,"The dress is absolutely beautiful! I got the red flowery one. Fits just as expected. Only reason not 5 stars is because there’s a small rip in the waist of the dress. It’s easily fixable with a couple stitches but frustrating that it came this way brand new. Overall, still love the dress."
4.0,"Barely fits, is very small. But it's ok to wear under something that isn't sheer."
4.0,"This shoe is well made, very warm. 4 stars because it is a bit too rigid which hurts my ankle a little bit."
4.0,he loved it. best birthday gift ever
4.0,Fun free-flowing with pockets. It fit me  a little weird in chest and under arms though
4.0,Really cute dress! Fits well.
4.0,So far I have tried for last 3 days. Overall I like it. It is hard to take off when wet. It would be better with a zipper.
4.0,Badic black leotard firs as expected.
4.0,I love the sporty/competitive look of the olive green and stripes but it is a little thin and not very cozy.
4.0,Very nice jacket and warm. I’m glad I finally have a jacket that doesn’t fit like a box on me like other pea coats.
4.0,"I love the style but the sizing is slightly off; If possible, I may have to exchange."
4.0,My granddaughter loves her dog and this darling little dress. It has images of every dog breed. It seems to run a bit small so order up size one size.
4.0,A little hard to keep on my child's foot but overall I can't complain.  Great purchase for the cost and a good foot cover for babies in cold months.
4.0,"Fit my 12 year old daughter just fine for her pioneer trek 8 -12 year old size.  I could fit it on my head as an adult woman, but was a tad snugger on my head."
4.0,These dresses are really cute and perfect for summer. I'm 5 ft tall so they are really long. And being a bit busty they are a bit small on fabric up top. But they still look great and my husband loves them! One of the ties is messed up where they stitched two short pieces together to make one od the ties. But I personally don't care about that. All in all I really like them and the prints that came.
4.0,It is much smaller than I expected from the picture. Maybe half this size
4.0,"I liked the first set so much I ended up picking up another set in different colors. They have held up well so far, just the right amount of stretch for me"
4.0,"Fits well, material is super soft. Very happy with the purchase."
4.0,Very good quality. But pad doesn't stick to these pants.
4.0,"This dragonfly is a beauty. I bought it to wear on my hat bands. However, the first time I took it out of the protective cellophane, the main Stone fell off the pin. This stone is important in that it's the body of the insect. Big beautiful emerald, popped right off and I was lucky not to lose it down the drain. So, I can recommend this piece of jewelry as long as you reinforce various parts of the pin with super glue!"
4.0,"Call me old school.  I like instructions wiith the product.  I'm not always near a computer to &#34;check our website&#34; .  However, I did check the website (3 times) to make sure I got it right.  They work perfectly to allow me to slip my shoes on and off.  The look good, too, and hold fast.  I was a tad nervous about watching him cut the excess ends to fit in the lock piece.  I don't guess I'll ever try to rethread these onto another pair of shoes. I expect they'll last a long time.  Thanks for a good product and timely service."
4.0,Works just fine like a face covering should and it is washable and reusable. Works great for me and i like it. Thanks
4.0,The color is actually rose gold and the shirt does not hang off your shoulder like on the model.
4.0,So great but I'm a 9 1\2 .... The reviews said they ran large so I got a 9 .. Yet they are still some what big.. All well thicker socks will do the trick don't be discouraged to get an I have got lots of compliments.. Just be sure to get the size down (at least)
4.0,This is exactly what I wanted. I can use it for a cover up while at the beach or over a tank top and shorts for a stroll along the lake shore.
4.0,"The fabric is comfortable, the inserts are not shaped well for actual wear and had to be removed unless you want domes on the ends of your breasts, and the shoulder straps not being adjustable means for me at least they are too long and have to be adjusted all day.  However i got it for a lounge at home bra so it suits that purpose."
4.0,"It is very pretty and the colors are vibrant, but my only gripe is that the stick part is very fragile and easily bent."
4.0,"They run a little on the small size, I would order a size bigger than your normal size."
4.0,"The shirt is very beautiful and is exactly as pictured. I'm surprised it fit my huge arms!! However it was slightly small in the waist area, but since I plan on using this under a jsk, it isn't a big deal. What annoys me is the shipping time- since it comes directly from China, the shipping time is slow. I paid for expedited but it was still slow."
4.0,Comfortable and washes well.  Good deal.
4.0,Loved the design of this button up but dont like how mens smalls are large womans. Should make x-smalls so woman can buy them too. Other than the size I love love loveee this shirt
4.0,I love this necklace. The saying and art work is beautiful. The only problem I have is I usually keep it in my pocket and the writing is scratching off.
4.0,It fits &#34;old lady&#34; like.  It's ok.  I gave it 4 stars because it's a nice shirt but wouldn't recommend for a younger woman.
4.0,"I love the way this cardigan drapes. It's very flattering, soft and comfortable. The only surprise was how thin it was - it's a super lightweight cardigan you can wear in the middle of summer (at least in San Francisco); that's why I took off 1 star. There were no lose threads, stitching is professional and it looks like it'll last a long time. Sizing is, surprisingly, accurate - lots of clothing from China tends to be on the smallish size no matter what the description says, but this one was true to size."
4.0,"2 buttons came off first time wear and luckily fell on floor so had them still as only send 1 extra button and coat has many. Now, have to sew on myself tighter and due to stroke I had couple years ago, my fingers don’t cooperate the same and material is thick also."
4.0,"The shades arrived in a nice firm box. The shades are comfortable,  light-weight, and are easily identified when floating in the water.  They hug your face tight which is perfect when cruising on the boat.  I took 1 star away because the glasses arrived with what appears to be damage from the manufacturer, as no damage is evident on the box.  The damage is only cosmetic but still."
4.0,Loved 'em
4.0,Very nice - great deal for the price.  I will definitely shop wihh them in the future.  quality item for a great price
4.0,"The snowball ones are cute, but the little color pieces fall out after a while."
4.0,Good for the price! its a little big on my narrow long oval face but I like it! It very light plastic so it doesnt weigh on my face and the nose piece doesn't leave a print when I take it off. Over all I like it a lot. I got the silver one and I am most likely going to get a darker frame one.
4.0,"It's not as heavy as I thought. To carry it it's heavy, but worn not so much. It's surprisingly comfortable. I wore it for hours on Halloween under my Teutonic Knight costume never bothered me a bit. I'm a large reg (44"" chest), and it fit me well. It's a great item for a good price."
4.0,"Cute blouse, i am used xs, but the fabric is a thin"
4.0,I love the color and material of this cover up. It fit as expected and looks great.
4.0,Great adorable piece of jewelry ! I love wearing this with anything low cut. It falls just right and is small enough it's a nice touch to any outfit. I especially love to wear it with my bathing suit. It is also very thin and easily breakable so I wouldn't necessarily wear it when I'm running around at a park with my nephews. I have a feeling that if it were to get tugged at all it wouldn't hold up to the strain of the weight put on it.
4.0,"The images displayed on the website fits the description and merchandise dead on with a good price. However, the fabric is very thin."
4.0,"I would have given this item a 5 except it was defective. It was very comfortable  and looks great! Now for size, I would give it 1 star. I bought 2 sizes bigger than what I normally wear. I would love to order another one but I don’t know 😩"
4.0,nice ear collars.  pretty!!
4.0,It was too extravagant for me. Bigger than expected.
4.0,It was a lovely mask.
4.0,The  overall quality and price are perfect. Only reason why it's four stars instead of five is because the color I ordered wasn't as dark as pictured.  I also ordered a size larger than usual and it fits perfectly.
4.0,"How do I return this item, no paperwork to fill out for return or exchange?"
4.0,Good quality socks.  I recommend.
4.0,Great deal for the price. Diggin the asst. colors. Just wish they had a size larger.
4.0,"I ordered the blue multi colored one and the black multi colored one. They fit great. A little shorter than most other maxi dresses but still nice. Super soft material, a little see through but nothing terrible. Really happy and might need to order some more"
4.0,"Love how soft this material is and fit is perfect. The material isn't insulated for winter weather, but that's okay, I will try it with one of my long thick sweaters.  Cute pattern!"
4.0,"Good ring for price, little imperfection"
4.0,The blue collar is not actually denim.  It is a denim-color cloth.
4.0,The dress is nice. Fits nice but that is keeping in mind I am very slim. The sleeves have no lining and the lace has no stretch so it may be uncomfortable for someone if it's too fitted.
4.0,"Love the look, the blend is soft and not itchy. The fit is for very straight slim build, I got XXL and it's fine except in the shoulders and chest."
4.0,Very soft fabric and good fit
4.0,The band is all jacked up but boy does it flow beautiful
4.0,"Fit smallish sized head perfectly. I've always had problems finding sunglasses because I have a narrow face. This may be the 4-5th pair I've ordered on Amazon and the 1st I didn't send back. My only complaint is that the lens isn't quite dark enough. But since frames that fit my face are hard to come by, and I have kids that destroy sunglasses, I will probably continue to use cheaper sunglasses until my face is safe from attack by toddlers."
4.0,"The shirt is good. Thought the transfer would be a little larger, but the image is accurate. Price is good too."
4.0,"Absolutely love the color I chose! The fit overall is spot on for what I was looking for. I'm so tired of the ""fitted or slim"" look of these days. Can't breathe or move well in that style. The only two alterations I would have done to this would be to add snaps to the sleeves instead of Velcro. Also, another sinch string on the left bottom would help in the balance of the jacket when pulled in. Other than that...really a good looking, well fitted jacket for my needs."
4.0,"After reading the reviews, I decided to order a size larger than I thought I would need and they fit well. They were still a little shorter than I thought they would be but they'll work. Very comfy."
4.0,"I have grown to love click belts.  In this instance, I trimmed the belt to a length that made the belt ""tail"" not too long.  The click track starts too far into the belt making the tail quite long if you want to keep the click adjustments.  By the time I trimmed it so the tail was appropriate, I did not have any click adjustment left.  So, even though I like the belt, because the clicks start so far into the belt, the tail is just too long and looks unprofessional (IMHO)."
4.0,It is a great jacket but it runs extremely small
4.0,I just tried this on for an event I will be going to and I was pleasantly surprised. It is fashionable and comfortable. To put this in perspective I am 5'4&#34; 163 lbs and I wear a 36DDD. I ordered this is a medium and it fits great.
4.0,It's really a very pretty necklace. I would definitely recommend this purchase.
4.0,Solid product looks nice on suit.
4.0,Great color goes well with many items in my warddrobe...and long lasting
4.0,For paying just a little over $2 this is a great piece of jewelry so far. Wish the clasp was easier to close by yourself other than that I like it!
4.0,"My 4 year old loves it.  It is comfortable for her and she loves the print.  We do have to readjust when she is wearing it for long periods as it tends to slip down.<br /><br />My 9 year old tried to see if they would work for him (of we ordered a ""cooler"" print), bit they were way too tight."
4.0,"My 9 year old granddaughter wanted a big floppy beach hat. Most little girl hats aren't big or floppy enough and most women's hats are too big. I bought this one because it looked vintage and not too wide of a brim. It is adorable and I think it would work for her.<br />Only problem is, the stitching is a bit messed up and it is visible, no matter how you wear the hat. I've currently got it hanging in the bathroom in hopes the creases come out and then I'll decide if I'm going to keep it. Wondering if they are ALL stitched this way?"
4.0,Love this dress. Super comfortable and not really short like alot of dresses this style can be plus has pockets. It's a thick soft fabric. You dont need to worry about it being see-through. Only con was I was either sent the wrong color or it was not as described. I ordered the purple-red and what I received is definitely the wine color. I kept it and still like it  but would have rather had the more purply color.
4.0,Was very comfortable and I use it for work.
4.0,"Cute for price, s&h was more than product"
4.0,"This dress is really cute! I love it, material is a little thicker than I expected but that allows to me to wear it on a cooler night and still be warm. The sleeves can easily be pushed up or worn long. The dress is form fitting and is well constructed. Great value for your money!"
4.0,"Socks are difficult to buy on line since you can see the colors or feel the fabric, but I was quite pleased with these.  They are medium weight (not thin like dress socks but not thick like socks you'd wear hiking either).  They are a nice assortment of colors.<br /><br />They hit a little lower on the calf than I expected, even though I am very short.  The tops stay up for now, but they feel rather loose on my skinny calves so I don't know if they will become looser over time and start to sag.<br /><br />For now they are great and the price was right."
4.0,The quality was really good . The earrings looked very pretty in my daughters ears she did complain that the post were to long when she try to sleep with them in.
4.0,"It ran a little smaller than what I normally buy and I bought my normal size. The coverage was nice, it is lightweight but not sheer."
4.0,"Over the years, there have been many times when we've been caught in sudden rain. When our kids were in marching band and we were spending our weekends at football games and band events, we got in the habit of keeping disposable ponchos in our backpacks. While these are thin, they are not the super thin ones that rip when opening up. You could potentially reuse it a couple of times before having to dispose of it. Though it may be difficult to fold back up to the small square that it was to begin with! These are definitely nicer than the ones that our kids had to wear over their marching band attire that they were given during inclement weather. These don't take up a lot of room in your bag and are convenient to take with you. I find them especially great for theme parks where similar ponchos are sold for ridiculous amounts of money!"
4.0,This dress fit great. The material is very soft but quite thin so you may want to wear slip. I hand washed it and air dried it because I was afraid it was going to shrink.
4.0,Nice dress for spring.  Can't beat the price.
4.0,The earring are beautiful as described but they come unglued easily..but u can glue back together...
4.0,"I love the BAR sign.  The letter type, the colors, brightness, and size up to a point.  the only thing I was not too happy with, is that you must control each letter with its own remote control.  Other than that it's great!"
4.0,So cute. I ordered up because I’m busty. It just ended up looking not very cute at all on me<br />Where they expect my boobs to fit is way too narrow. I should’ve left this one to the smaller built ladies
4.0,I cannot attest to the quality of this but a little girl in loves with cheatahs thought this was great.
4.0,"Some screw in from front, some from the back. Also, one pair came missing the picture ( 1 had earth, 1 was just silver)<br /><br />Other than that..."
4.0,"Thin stretchy fabric, you will definitely need to wear with an undershirt/leggings/slip if you as the fabric is also clingy to the body. Very flattering, nice length, comfortable. Typical “T-shirt” dress"
4.0,It's a little too long and a little too tight but still wearable.
4.0,"I would actually give this 3.5 stars. The reality is I'm not used to this type of wallet.  There is no place to lay out bills, so you have to take out all the folded bills; get what you need then put all back.  Also I can't see which card is in the slot 'til I pull it up.  Just going to take some getting used to."
4.0,"One plug is longer than the other but you can still wear it. Otherwise, very pretty colour."
4.0,"The jacket fit as expected except the sleeves are weirdly short. I'm 5'2&#34; and curvy so I ordered an XL, which typically results in sleeves way past my fingers. In this case the sleeves barely hit my wrists, which is not ideal in the rain. The hood is large enough to pull low over your forehead in the rain. The hem length is great for keeping your bum and thighs dry. I saw a few people saying they had issues with the material not being waterproof, but I've been wearing it in relatively heavy Pacific Northwest rain and had no issues.<br />This is not a winter jacket. It is only the waterproof layer, so you will need to leave room for layering in chilly weather."
4.0,Studs work well for second hole. Quality seems good so far. Earrings are more ball shaped than the images on the site. Overall a good buy.
4.0,"Great buy for the price. Delivery time was quick ( I order on Friday and received my package on Monday).The rich color is beautiful. Looks and fits perfectly. I purchased the large because I  wasn't too sure it was going to fit, but medium would have worked fine also. The dress is very long."
4.0,Very nice looking. I thought they would be wider but 8.5 is small.
4.0,There was no bow.
4.0,"They appear well made.  Low rise,  may not be the best fit for some riders.  I wear suspenders so not much of an issue for me. Some buyers say too long in the legs,  I'm average height but length was fine. Knee and hip padding nice touch.  I wear constrution grade knee protectors also. I would give it a five star rating if they we're one inch higher  in the rise...."
4.0,Fit nicely but received different design/color than pictured
4.0,"Nice fit.  The pockets are a little odd and small, but I'm not too worried my iPhone will fall out."
4.0,"I found it necessary to drill a pilot hole with a small drill bit where you want to put the spikes first. Apply some “Shoe Goo” (not included) adhesive to the pilot hole and the screw part of the spike. Using the included tool firmly press down and turn the spike into the pilot hole until it’s firmly screwed into the shoe sole. Don’t over tighten or you’ll pull it out of the shoe sole. Let set overnight to allow Shoe Goo to set. I did 3 spikes on each shoe and they all held after one round of golf. Only suggestion I have is that the manufacturer make the spikes thinner, not so big. I think they’d stay attached better and not feel as bulky under your foot. So far pleased and surprised they seem to be holding. I believe Shoe Goo is a must! Should be included with package. Update: I’ve played at least a dozen rounds of golf since I installed these spikes and none of the spikes have come out. I notice that Golf Kicks now include a tube of Shoe Goo which I believe is a must. Good product, great idea, buy these and turn a pair of favorite shoes into favorite golf spikes."
4.0,nothing to say just like it
4.0,I love the look of these earrings.  I will probably give as a gift to one of my younger nieces.<br />The sale price clinched the purchase for me.
4.0,Nice bathing suit however to small for my 38 G top. Nice material.
4.0,"Beautiful set! However, did not like the fabric material. It’s not cotton"
4.0,"Holy comfort, Batman! These have to be the softest leggings I've ever owned! They are just a joy to wear. Although, I think they may have been made for a taller person..."
4.0,Looks good and is Durable.
4.0,"Overall bag meets requirements only wish inside pocket was more usable for iPhone as is I is not deep enough, also slight smell but airing helps this!"
4.0,I had to get it sized at a jeweler bc I could not get the pins out to change the band width.
4.0,"This fit everywhere really well except the bust.  I have large breasts (DD) but I think if you have smaller breasts, this would look absolutely adorable."
4.0,"Looks great!<br />Fits great!<br />Does not wash well, I line dried it each time and the material does not hold up"
4.0,Different sizes
4.0,The slits are too high for work!!
4.0,"I like this green dress a lot!! but part of me wishes it were offered in size XS... the size small is barely small enough to fit and look good.. I mean, it still looks good but i think it would look better if it were just a a little bit tighter"
4.0,"Very comfortable,  like the fit,  good support and coverage"
4.0,"Not all the pieces were intact. Some pieces broken, but for the quantity it is still a very good value."
4.0,"This top certainly runs tight, so you may want to order up a size. It comes with loose threads coming off the sleeve, so I have my doubts about how well it will hold up. Otherwise, looks good."
4.0,"Great bag for the price. Fits as a carry on. Unfortunately, after a few regular uses (NO overpacking), each brown handles did rip off on one side. However, the black strap can be adjusted in length and can shorten to the point where you can either hang over your shoulder or carry somewhat like a briefcase. The strap has held up nicely for me since with 6-7 trips with no signs of ripping off."
4.0,"I’m a vet and have a hard time sleeping. I use this to help wake up in the morning. Although I wouldn’t say that it is 100% effective, more like 80%. I am more likely to wake up the first time. I still have my backup alarm on my phone, and I haven’t slept in since owning this, so that’s a plus. The shock on 100% is very strong, and the battery lasts long with no charging issues.<br /><br />The sleep tracker is nice. It can wake you up a few earlier in your sleep cycle so it isn’t"
4.0,"I should have listened to the other reviews and ordered a band size larger than my typical order but I didn't, The band did fit and the cups are the perfect size but the band is tight and there is no wiggle room. I do feel because of the tightness it does help to hold up &#34;the girls&#34; a little better. Being a 32DDD since I got pregnant these swimsuit tops have saved my life. They help to make you feel held in and not spilling over everywhere. I do highly recommend them."
4.0,"WELL IT TRUE TO SIZE CAUSE IM 5,4 147LBS, I GOT A LIL GUT BUT I LIKE IT FIT GOOD TO ME, BUT, YOU WILL NEED A HALF BRA ON, I.LIKE THE FIT SO I WILL BUY MORE."
4.0,There were 2 different ribbons used for the ranks on the sleeves and I didn't like that.
4.0,Very nice for the price.  Only wore it for MardjGras party...
4.0,"I think the pilling is a result of the gloves being 100% cashmere.  A blend would have been a better choice of material.  But they are comfortable, soft and breathable while still being warm (probably appropriate for 35F and above weather - below that, you'll want something more heavy duty).  They also hold their shape really well.  I actually wear these at the office when my hands get chilly, and also outside commuting by bus so that I can use my smartphone without taking my gloves off.  I just wish they didn't pill so much."
4.0,N/a.
4.0,Strap was fine and made well. Package was not sealed. No strap locks. Return perhaps????
4.0,"Pretty big on my toddler, but it was cute and DEFINITELY worth the money for what I needed. The hat was the best part!"
4.0,They seem like they are well made and durable. The fabric is not thin. The only down side is that I feel they are cut a little small in the waste. If your in the middle of the sizes definitely go to the upper end. Sometimes I'm a 36w other a 38w is a little big but these fit just right and I got 38w
4.0,"These are really cute, good quality but huge!  I wear a size 6 pant, am 5’6” 130lbs.  The S/M were enormous-I laughed out loud.  Too bad because I like the style, fabric and quality."
4.0,So cute but the chain is so thin so it tangles easily.
4.0,"(See update at bottom)<br />Yes, there are TWO bags— a well-designed medium hand-bag that could be a tote, and a smaller, matching clutch with a cross-body strap. The big bag is sturdy, with excellent handles.<br /><br />I got the orange ones. The color is strong, but darker than an actual orange. Somewhere between orange and sweet potato. I like it! The shape and the contrast with the brown straps is great design. The first two stars I gave are for great looks and craftmanship.<br /><br />UNFORTUNATELY I couldn’t use them for over a week. Even from two rooms away, they smelled like jet fuel. I know these synthetic materials are made from petroleum, but they should be allowed to out-gas before they are sold to unsuspecting consumers. I had to hang the bags on the back porch.<br /><br />I liked the design and size of these bags enough that I was willing to keep them, and even buy more, if it’s possible to speed up the out-gassing. I asked recent buyers how they got rid of the smell, but they didn’t have the same experience (although many other customers returned the bags because of the odor).<br /><br />UPDATE: I didn’t try washing them in the machine, baking soda, or vinegar.  But I DID try activated charcoal, tea, and perfume sachets, and Febreeze.  In the end, I got rid of most of the smell just by waiting long enough! I left the bags outside on my back porch in the sun and wind for 8 or 9 days. Then I washed the outside with a damp towel and baby shampoo. I was able to use them today. After handlng the bags, my hands smelled a little bit like jet fuel (from the handles), but it washed off.<br /><br />Now that they are usable, I raised my review to four stars. After all, I plan to buy them again in another color. But I shouldn’t have to wash and deodorize them before using them, so I’m leaving one star off."
4.0,"The high waist is so comftorable! My only complaint is that I wish they were a little tighter. I'm 5'3&#34; with a booty, and love these to fight a little better. They are thicker material and that is a better trade off. Nothing worse than leggings you can see through when you bend over"
4.0,Lightweight material so I will need leggings or thicker hose to wear in the fall.  Love the elastic empire waist to show definition and shape.
4.0,I'd say the small fits more like a medium. The material is high quality and super soft. Other than running big I loved it!
4.0,Fit as expected but the arm holes flared out a little near my armpits and it wasn’t flattering at all. Will have to return unfortunately.
4.0,"Came early, and quality is as expected. It's a bit thin, but soft, and it makes a great gift. The decals look like they won't last super long, but I will be taking care to not wrinkle it or tumble dry it. Nice selection of colors too, and good sizing."
4.0,I bought this as a gift for my employee for Professional Administrative Day. She absolutely loves it and wears it all the time.
4.0,Dress is a little tight around the shoulder/waist area since I have broader shoulders. Falls nicely at the knees.
4.0,"Very comfortable, but it does seem to have a gap below the waist. Holds up to frequent washing"
4.0,Beautiful! I like!
4.0,Love it...Runs a bit small as I knew it would. Went xlarge not large and it is so comfy.
4.0,"My daughter is 2 years 4 months, I ordered a 2T-3T and it is a little big but it is in the dryer now so maybe it will shrink a little bit. It is super cute. I actually like the top better than the dress part, the dress seems too long. I envisioned her wearing cute leggings underneath it since it is cold but the dress falls down to right below her knees, a little longer than I expected. But it is still cute and I’m glad I purchased it. If it fits a little better once it is dry then I’ll buy the Christmas one too."
4.0,"The color is not army green in my opinion.  But it works that way I expected to.  I also got brown, black, white, pink, apricot so I'm set."
4.0,I like these because they are lightweight but offer a fair amount of protection st the same time for everyday wear. The cut its perfect allowing that little but that rises on your nose so glasses can sit over the edge to prevent fogging up. I bought white because we're going to add decorative decals on them.
4.0,The charm is not the quality I wanted. I wanted something as heavy as my Da Vinci charms. This charm has nice detail though and a pretty bead at the top. I bought it to symbolize my interest in genealogy and it will work. I don't think it will hold up well on a bracelet but it's a pretty charm and what I expected for the price.
4.0,I got this shrit for my wife and she loved it .She is 5.4' 128 lbs.I got Medium for her.Fits perfect.
4.0,"It’s fine, not great- I like the movie one much better"
4.0,"I wouldn’t consider these socks to be “heavy wool socks.” That being said, they are extremely comfortable and their warmth really surprised me. They aren’t really thick but man they sure are comfortable. I’d give 5 stars if they were a little thicker. I bought them for hunting."
4.0,"It is the perfects size. I would buy for someone else as well but don't necessarily need the design. If you throw it in the bag a lot, the color of course starts to get dirty. Just as advertised, I can put phone, lip products, cc's, cash, coupons.. it does hold quite a bit!"
4.0,"Works well. Unfortunately, it doesn't distract from the gut I'm sporting. Otherwise, it's grrreeaat!"
4.0,"The product was very nice. brilliant colors, nice silky feel. I was very impressed and pleased."
4.0,I needed something for keys and and car remote this fit the bill
4.0,"This poncho is lovely, but the neckline is much too high and small for my comfort. The quality of the fabric and knitting is top notch. It is a substantial weight, and the cotton has a silky feel."
4.0,"I returned this hat because it ran a little large for my small to avg size head. If you have a thick hair and a normal size head, I'm sure this hat would fit fine. It's okay quality and perfect for the beach and throwing in your bag."
4.0,Good shirts the head holes are small and my son only ended up being able to wear 2 of the shirts
4.0,Love love these socks. I have restless leg and I sleep in them. They do the job. Definitely order. I did get a gift card to review but I really do like the compression socks. They are also stylish.
4.0,"Bought this for my wife, fits perfectly. My only issue is I was hoping it was a deep royal blue  but it's still gorgeous"
4.0,Colors of red and  pink looked a  lot alike.  One color for grandson and the other for granddaughter.  Wish there had been more variance in the color.  But still soft and super idea for their bedrooms to have added personality.
4.0,"Bought costume for a 6'2 190lb guy. It fit well, maybe a bit on the larger side."
4.0,Good value for money.
4.0,Fits most.
4.0,Good quality and a dense weave for good warmth.  My only complaint is that the stretch in the fabric is a little tight if I wish to cover my nose and mouth.
4.0,Nice fit for my Fitbit!<br />More flash than the standard band!
4.0,"I like the dress and I thought it was a little snug for a size 8, but overall it fit well and I'm very pleased with my purchase."
4.0,"easy to breathe, holds perfectly on the nose position."
4.0,It’s good but expected it to be sturdier. Too hard to wear by yourself. I needed help to put it on.
4.0,"It's a little bit big, but I expected it would be so that I didn't have to force it in. I like the extra room, I can fit headphones and my charger in it as well, even a small (softcover) book. It smelled kind of weird for the first week or so, but I just sprayed it with perfume. But if you are really sensitive to smell it might be a bother (for me, it wasn't). The design and colors are nice and look as expected, I like it and would recommend to anyone. It is thick enough that I feel it protects my laptop. Looks like the photo."
4.0,Nice socks but a little on the thin side.
4.0,Exactly what I was looking for just the side pieces were a little loose on the kids. Otherwise perfect.
4.0,"Good little flashlights. Fits nicely in pocket or purse.  Had one similar for a long time but a tad bit slimmer and it is still working today. Used on key ring but bright enough to use all around household. These are hard to find, good deal."
4.0,wife did not like the material that it is made out of. She said that it when her brace (Velcro) got on it it frayed the leggings.
4.0,"Better then expected! They were just what I wanted, they great on."
4.0,It still provides plenty of coverage for winter days...worth having for sure...
4.0,These look amazing when you get them on! And are easy to put on too. The reason I took a star off is because they are not comfortable for normal everyday wear. As a woman (C cup) I found them to be too uncomfortable. The edges poked into my breast and were just not comfortable for normal everyday wear. However for a special occasion they'll be great and wow your significant other. If your a man I can see where you'd have less of a problem however they are a) kind of girly and b) stick slightly out so that they seem to rest comfortably around a woman's nipple with the extra flesh of a breast behind it.
4.0,It does have measurements in the description but the actual print is so tiny in person that it would never be seen by an emergency tech or identified as emergency information.  I have to use a magnifying glass to read it while wearing glasses that make my vision better than 20/20.  No point to this at all unless you just need a keychain.  * The seller was very prompt in responding even before I posted the one star review I initially posted.  I am changing this to 4 stars because they offered to eat half the cost of this relatively inexpensive customized item.  I am satisfied that they did what they could for me.
4.0,"They're super cute & stylish , but you have to be very careful when putting them on they tear easily! And yes the sock band around the ankle is a bit tight , but overall they're good ."
4.0,"Bright colors and good quality , but I order a small and they send a medium. I gave 4 starts because of the size."
4.0,For jogging.  Very comfortable
4.0,"These socks are a little large for my small feet, but so far so good in terms of not freezing. We haven't had any scary cold days since I got them, but even when the temps were in the low 20's in the morning, I didn't freeze. That's a great start for me, since my feet are usually always cold. I hope that when it gets colder I will still be happy and not have frozen toes."
4.0,"Very pretty but really dainty,"
4.0,Fits a little tight but overall it is a good shirt. I wish I would've realized it had gold buttons but it will be okay for what I need it for!
4.0,"Was a little snug, but I have large breasts & should've ordered an XL. Shirt was a bit thin, I could see my boobs and bra in the light but I think If it were looser, it wouldn't of been an issue. Nice shirt though. I'm gonna order an XL now."
4.0,You can see through a little through the skirt. I recommend a Spank or something like it for underwear.
4.0,"Hey ladies, I'm 5'3, 160 lbs, and I got a size large. And the are just a tad too big. Most pants are long on me these aren't bad, but there's extra material behind my knees and butt. They look amazing on me, I wish the waiste band elastic was a little thicker. But I still like them and will wear them. Great for the price!"
4.0,One pair did not blink very brightly.
4.0,i’m a nurse & these have helped me a lot. when i was pregnant i got varcicose veins in my feet and i needed relief being on my feet passing meds or chasing down someone’s vitals. the only complaint i have is they are a little tight on my calf but nothing that prevents me from wearing them so make sure to measure your calf.
4.0,I ordered jade size 4 and received turquoise size 6.  The company did send the correct item and a return label for the wrong ones.  The gauges are really pretty.
4.0,"The styling and fit are spot on, but I wish this was 6-10 inches longer."
4.0,"I love this swimsuit! I purchased it for the top mostly. I prefer shorts with my swimsuit, so I paired it with some other shorts. The bottoms seem great tho if you prefer that. One complaint is that the straps don’t stay…. The metal clasp comes out wayyy too easy. They left them removable so you could take them off if wanted. I sewed them in cause I need the extra support haha. That’s the only complaint but after sewing them on, this top is perfect!! I would also say this could have the tendency to ride up with more active swimming. Might be something to consider. It is a suit for lighter activity."
4.0,"I wore this to a ""retro formal"" party and got the prize for ""Best 'You call that a tuxedo?' Costume"". Mission accomplished. The fact that it's baby blue, rather than just black, was the clincher. It's made well enough that I will now wear it to the gym and continue to embarrass my family."
4.0,Have not used for travel yet. They seem very comfortable..
4.0,Little tight in the hips (I'm a Lane Bryant size 22 in pants) but otherwise fit my large bust. US ed it as a bathrobe too and from the showers and it worked great.
4.0,Nice quality.  A bit larger than expected.  Wish you'd had 1/2 sizes.
4.0,Is a really neat coin/credit card/ID wallet.
4.0,They look great but they are NOT moisture wicking! I ran for about 30 minutes and it looked like I wet myself. Definitely more appropriate for yoga or other exercises where you don’t sweat as much! Decent compression around the waist but I wish the band covered my whole stomach. The crotch to the top of the waist band is long & the compression part of the band tends to sit right above the stomach.
4.0,"Fits perfectly. Nice looking sandal,  However I was under the impression that the shoe would be made of leather (vs pleather) but other than that it's a very well made shoe."
4.0,I would like to have a button higher up to close in the neck better!
4.0,It is a good band! Just takes a little bit to break it in. Doesn't fit the exact same way my original band from fitbit did but that is to be expected.
4.0,Nice and thick shirt basic shirt. Runs a little small though.
4.0,Perfect for layering under . . . and still looks chic!
4.0,"It doesn't feel like it fits right, its a bit small. I wear a 36 D and I ordered a D. After speaking with the seller I'm getting a refund. Its really nice though, just wish it if!"
4.0,"The bra comes with an added extender, and you need it, just as other reviews have said. The cup size is spot on though. I love the laced detail so you can cinch it in."
4.0,"This was a gift for my grandson's birthday, and he loved it.  He received two, and has been wearing them as often as he can."
4.0,I really like the look of this band but it is more pink than the rose gold I was hoping for. Its still pretty with the rose gold face though so I kept it.
4.0,Main reason for 4-star: they were rather small (expected the bottom flower to be 1/3in). They fit snugly on the ear without using the backs. They go up the earlobe rather nicely which is good. I would recommend this size of earring for a young lady or minimalist jewelry older female.
4.0,"Pilling and starting to look dirty because of it. But, it's comfy. So, now I need a What Not To Wear intervention."
4.0,It fits a little small but otherwise I love it.
4.0,"My eyeglasses were constantly fogged (thanks, covid mask).  This stuff works.  Be patient, don't give up after one try.  The first couple times I used it I was disappointed.  After that, greatly improved.  I don't know what the magic is, maybe the juice needs to build up on the lenses and applicator cloth.  An additional benefit is I need to clean my lenses less often since I've been using  this anti-fog spray.  Full disclosure: I was offered a reward in exchange for a review.  Nonetheless, I will definitely buy this again."
4.0,My sister is obsessed with everything frenchie so I thought it would be a no brainer to get these for her. They're really cute however my french bull dog thinks it's a toy and attacks her slippers when she wears them. Guess we're gonna have to display them for now.
4.0,"It's really very nice, super softly, I love it but I give it 4 stars because you can see it through :("
4.0,"cant beat price,better overall quality than i imagined"
4.0,Awesome dress for price! Fit was superb. Color not absorbed through fabric when stretched white color is revealed. Comfortable and definitely eye catching! Pleased with the purchase overall.
4.0,Super cute but small and the lack of eyes honestly bothers me!
4.0,The color was perfect. the material is good and washes well but the sizes ran small for sizes over medium.
4.0,It's fit perfect up top but the bottom is way too loose
4.0,"This is a very cute shirt, which I would not call a sweater-it is extremely thin, made of a synthetic material.<br />I have not washed it yet, and am curious to see if it survives a wash. Very cute, I am just afraid because of the marginal quality that it won't last long."
4.0,"Cute, flattering fit, mid-weight fabric. I’ve washed this three times so far (warm water, hang to dry), and it has started to pill a bit, so it don’t foresee a super-long lifespan, but for a season or two it’ll be fine. I ordered the XL and measure in at 5’4”, 170 lbs. I bit boxier than the photo, less of a defined waist, but still flattering, extremely comfortable, hitting below the knee. I ordered both the dark cyan & black."
4.0,"My kids loves it. The wand is a little flimsy but it’s good for cosplay. The scarf is super soft, definitely using for the winter months . The necklace and glasses held up to the cosplay challenge. I’ll recommend this to others. Thanx"
4.0,They were exactly what I ordered and fit Nicely
4.0,Very very thin! But way cute. The color is perfect and it is made well. I got a medium I'm usually a xs/s
4.0,"These are really cute. I wish they had been shipped in a box as the envelope provided little protection. One of the lenses was a little out of the frame, but I popped it back."
4.0,This chain is both delicate and sturdy. It can hold both large and small pendants. The only thing I don't like about it is that the clasp moves around a lot when trying to connect it.
4.0,Just what we needed to stand out. All the girls said she looked like a Barbie doll ballerina princess. 1st Runner up in pageant!
4.0,"This is a great, well-made leather wallet that perfect for storing just a few cards and bills. Even though it's marketed towards men, it's also great for women, especially for those occasions that call for carrying a small purse (or no purse at all). The construction is great and I know it will last a long time."
4.0,Fit as expected. Good for low impact activities. Stitching on the back is a bit itchy in places so not as comfortable for leisure wear.
4.0,"Gathering dust, but VERY,  necessary thing. Happy to have it. Pllanning to buy more!"
4.0,"I get so many compliments whenever I wear this.  It is beautiful.  It only loses one star because the skirt is a bit stiff, it wrinkles easily in the back when you sit and the fabric in the front tends to stick and ride up as I walk - I do wear a pair of cotton shorts underneath my dresses so it might be that - but this is the only dress that has that issue so far.  Overall I recommend.  I got the black dress with the large roses 🌹 on the skirt."
4.0,I had previously returned  one that was all laced but was too loose. This one seems to run small. I usually wear medium so I took xl based on the reviews and it fits just right. The sleeves do not sag they are skin fit.
4.0,"I am a 8.5 women's shoe and they are a little snug to get on, but otherwise they work fine.  I would rather they be a little snug then fall off."
4.0,"This dress is SO cute! It's really nice quality. Surprisingly nice actually. The top portion is a stretchy lace material, and the rest is a heavier weight somewhat stretchy fabric. This dress fit great, except for the chest. I was unable to button it without a huge gap. However, it would still be super cute left unbuttoned with a black cami underneath - but unfortunately I need a dress for a more formal situation so that option won't work for me. If you're trying to decide which size to order, I would say this dress is true to size as long as you're not large chested. For reference, I'm a 40DDD and I ordered a 2XL and there was no possible way it was going to look good buttoned up."
4.0,"I ordered this as I've been looking for a couple of years to add a classic neutral blazer to my capsule-ish wardrobe; they're hard to find for a 50"" bust and similarly-sized hips, especially if you can't justify a premium price for an item your lifestyle dictates you won't wear more than about once a month. But there's no real replacement for a good blazer to dress an outfit up--even jeans and a T-shirt look dressy if paired with a classic blazer, leather flats, and a relatively tailored purse. And while I have the skills to make one myself, my health issues haven't been stable enough for a while that I could be certain to finish the project before the next flareup put me in bed for weeks, so it really wasn't an option.<br /><br />This one fit my requirements as far as being a fairly classically tailored style: the collar, while not quite as timeless as a peaked lapel, is quite traditional; the pockets have square flaps, but are functional; the back is unvented which is common with this collar style; while it's got no front closure, that's easy to add on if I choose to do so later;  and the jacket is fully lined. The fabric is an easy-care polyester twill in a weight appropriate for suits, the seams are well-sewn without bobbles or threads sticking out, and the lining has the proper amount of ease. While the description claims it has a front button and sleeve buttons, that is not the case; this doesn't really matter to me as I rarely want to button a jacket, but accuracy in the description would be nice.<br /><br />The only real problem I have with it is that it's cut for someone with slimmer arms than I have; plus-sized standard/near-hourglass figures tend to put on weight in the upper arms as well, and I can't tell you how many potential purchases of otherwise well-fitting clothes have been stopped by an upper arm cut 1.5""/4cm too small so that there's a noticeable tight spot. It's not just the plus-sized people who this knocks out of the potential customer base, though; women who include weightlifting as part of their fitness routine or work with large animals or heavier objects all tend to have upper arms that are larger than the current skinny-fit trend can accommodate easily."
4.0,"The merchandise is good quality and it was shipped quickly. The balls were bigger and heavier (giggity) than I expected, so they pull down my lobes when I wear them, which isn't what I was going for."
4.0,"these were nice quality, however the clasp was too large and not adjustable to fit the charms."
4.0,After reading the reviews I was contemplating which size to buy. I normally wear a medium unless the dress is made full. I decided to order the medium and not go a size up.<br />The dress fit better than expected. I would have liked it an inch or 2 longer. It can be worn casually or you can dress it up. The material is thin but not as bad as I expected after reading other reviews. I’m going to order again in additional colors.<br />My size 5’2 1/2 bust 36C
4.0,"A little wide, but a damn good bargain. Polarized and I love the way they look."
4.0,"semi clear looks better on luggage, less tacky than all clear ones. Only order set to use the hand carry only. Found useful at security check xray conveyor belt, easily clean off dust and gooey black tar from belts."
4.0,Love this I normally wear a small but I got a medium and it fits perfectly so it does run small
4.0,I really do like this dress.  Unfortunately it was one size to small going by the size chart and I had to return.  I will be purchasing again in the future in the correct size.
4.0,These no slip socks/slippers are wonderful on hardwood floors. They keep my feet warm and they wash up well.
4.0,A little loose but cute
4.0,"I really liked that sweatshirt! I'll give it a four, not for the quality of the item,but the shipping charges seem too high. Gary C"
4.0,only thing I would change I would make it bigger writing is a bit small
4.0,We are the ultimate crime fighting duo when my daughter dons this onesie.
4.0,Looked slightly different
4.0,"Size is adjustable, via Velcro strips on the headband.  The crown of the headband is also slightly adjustable - tightening or loosening the crown adjusts the depth of crown.  I've replaced the string crown adjustment with a leather thong.<br />  I rate the over-all production values as very high.  The faux leather chinstrap seems durable enough.  The canvas exterior seems durable, readily cleanable, porous enough to soak the pith, but tight enough that the helmet doesn't drip even when well soaked, and well stitched.  Rivets are solidly applied, as is the metal crown vent.  The waterproof canvas interior is glued to the pith (no data as yet as to how well the glue holds up) and stitched  under the canvas brim.<br />  I researched he market looking for a pith helmet.  An official British Army helmet runs hundreds of dollars.  There is a wide variety of reproduction helmets, mostly of various British uniforms.  I like the look of this style, it  reminds me of Life Guards when I was a kid.<br />  Functionally, the he provides excellent shade for the head, eyes, ears, and neck, yet is light and stable under a high wind.  The chin strap may never be used.  When properly fitted, the headband provides a layer of air between the head and the helmet.  If the helmet gets soaked (outside only - plug all holes and submerge to the brim [caution, the fully soaked pith may be soft and subject to deformation]) the process of evaporation cools the helmet, and hence the head.  This works  very well for me walking and working in the desert.  I suspect this helmet is also excellent rain gear, but I may never find out."
4.0,I normally wear an XL due to being busty... I got a XXL and it is very tight. If that's the look you are going for its very cute but if you want something with any give or looseness then you need to size up a few sizes.
4.0,The product met my expectations.  It’s not the quality of even your least expensive suit but I don’t expect it to be.  It’s a costume.  The inner liner is not the blue as shown in the pictures.  It’s closer to the pink material.  My package was also missing the tie which was a little disappointing but I made it work.
4.0,"It is a pretty good purse for the $$ And I think it will hold up well. It is exactly like picture. I do like the color, and with care it will soften as it ages. Nice size, I would buy it again!!"
4.0,"The wife likes it. When I am at a loss for gift ideas, a Pandora bead is a life saver, I recommend at least two to hook two bracelets together. Pretty soon they need to come out with a triple bead."
4.0,Would be comfortable if it fit!!
4.0,Nice but took two months to get it. Came from China.
4.0,"This is a great backpack, love the wide opening on top. Also lighter in weight than I expected. I took off one star because the seller (KYD KYD) took over four weeks to get it to me."
4.0,"For the price, this is an excellent dress!  I didn't expect it to be nearly as pretty or as relatively well-made as it is!"
4.0,Not pleased with liner that comes with. Snaps for liner look tacky but over all happy with my purchase.
4.0,"!<br /><br />Seller was conscientious and communicated with me throughout the purchase and subsequent shipping/arrival. The listing was accurate and detailed plus priced affordably. She inquired whether I had received the item and if it met with my approval. I am satisfied that if there had been an issue with the sale, she would have been on top of it from the start."
4.0,I love this dress and received a lot of compliments on it. The only bad thing I have to say is the zipper sticks. I’m assuming it’s just a malfunction in my dress and not every single dress.
4.0,I like this item but wish it was a little narrow
4.0,"Not made for large chests, the buttons just pop open. Material is thin but good quality. Nice summer tank"
4.0,"The dress was perfect for what I wanted it for!!!! However, it had plenty of room everywhere (even the shoulders) except around the upper chest area. So the dress was a bit tighter than I would have liked. Would have given 5 stars if it weren't for that. But it's very light and there is a slip built in so you don't have to wear one of your own! Arrived a day early in a sealed bag (in a box) clean and ready for wear."
4.0,It fits me perfectly and is really pretty. The heart is not overly tiny and really catches attention.
4.0,"Cute dress. The lace has pilled a little after wearing a couple of times, but so far I can still tuck it back out of site. Lots of compliments on it."
4.0,"6'2, 160. Xl fits perfect. Large was too snug. If you wear skinny jeans, the large might be favorable"
4.0,Fit great and soft
4.0,For the money you can’t beat these! Mine were in perfect condition. Some aren’t as flowy as others but honestly you can’t even tell. The only issue I had was that some were a little long for my neck. Totally worth the purchase!
4.0,I'm 5'4 and got medium. Fits perfectly. Got the Navy color and it looks navy indoor but when you go outside it looks....violet(ish?).
4.0,"Theyre not terrible or anything. They did exactly what i needed them to do. I didnt keep the original chain on, i  took it off and added new ones, to recreate Kurapikas chains for prom. I just have to keep adding clear nail polish. The rings are pretty adjustable, which is very nice"
4.0,I luv this shawl just what I needed<br />Would recommend....
4.0,"The quality seems good, but they are too small. I will try to exchange for a larger size and see how they work out."
4.0,Looks similar to picture but material is thin and cheap.  The pattern isn’t as rich.  Fits ok. Disappointed in how it hangs on my body.
4.0,Too long but top part is nice.  And skirt part of the dress is a very stiff fabric.  I was expecting a flowing type of fabric on the bottom.  I am trying to return it.
4.0,I ordered these for a 1920's party but they did not arrive in time. They were very low priced and my granddaughters love to play dress up with them. I'm glad I bought them even though I wasn't able to wear them myself.
4.0,Love the look of the boots. I ordered a half size larger than I normally wear. Plenty of room.
4.0,Fits in palm springs mm perfect.
4.0,"i bought the archimeded ergonomic height increasing soles not for added height, but because i have no arch support. i don't have a natural arch in my feet, and i experience foot fatigue somewhat quickly when i work. i am on my feet anywhere from 4 to 9 hours a day and i do a lot of walking, so i needed something. i don't know exactly what kind of height these soles were supposed to give, but they only gave me a minimal noticeable difference, i'd guestimate less than a quarter inch as far as increasing my actual standing height. the most height i got was in the arch area, and that's what i wanted. i ordered the XL as i wear a size 10 in women's shoes and they fit perfectly. i could feel the arch lift as soon as i stood. i felt it constantly while wearing them and walking. the arch support didn't disappear over time like happens with some arch support products. there was some cushion in the heel area also, which i like. i have been wearing them all weekend while im off work, so i'll see how they do next week when i go back to work. i did get a discount for my honest review."
4.0,The bra is soft and comfortable. Fits true to size. The bra has the appropriate push up. I would buy in multiple colors.
4.0,These are adorable but unfortunately they were too small and they didn't have the next size up.  Hate to send them back but I'll have to.  They seem to be very sturdy in construction and look like the ones my son used to wear when he was a teenager.
4.0,I purchased this for my mother who usually wears a large in lounge wear.  This item fit but was a little snug compared to others of the same style.<br />She has washed it twice and the quality is good.  Next time I will order a size large to fit more comfortably.
4.0,"I like this shirt.  It fits me nicely, and accentuates my pecs.  Because it’s made in communist China,  It is an exactly the same material and almost the same design as a “hoodie shirt” I have, even though they are supposedly made by 2 different communist companies!<br />The material is thin.  It’s not going to keep you warm."
4.0,If you are large in the chest area I wouldn’t recommend for support. Very pretty just not great supporting
4.0,"Nice quality, love the length, a little big though."
4.0,It was nice but ran a little small
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:f2a49ac3a9a42c7345328e70ed9a3a07]] If you're looking for a high-end name brand look-a-like strap, this is not it. The synthetic leather strap seems very durable. It has 7 adjustment holes. The max drop length from my shoulder is 25"" (tip of hardware) and 19"" drop at the shortest length. Nice sturdy buckle and lobster claws hardware with strong spring back. It has a high glazed shine along both sides of the strap. The strap length max is 48.5"" (not including hardware) and 52"" from the tip of both ends of the hardwares. Overall, it's a nice replacement strap."
4.0,Cute flowing top that doesn't show off the belly I've built up. It's nice enough to wear with slacks to work.
4.0,"Perfect fit and style, very comfy fabric. My only issue is that when I sit down the side splits reveal my ENTIRE leg. I will have to sew that part up a bit."
4.0,"It fit really well, but definitely need to wear a slip under it. Little see through."
4.0,"This is a nice maxi,  I ordered a large based on the reviews and sizing info, however there's a bit of extra material in the front ( no at all like the model).  I may have been able to take a medium, however, the but and back on the large do fit just right.  It's long to the floor, but that's how I like my maxis to fit. Hope it washes well. I ordered the grey, but think it might look better in other color choices."
4.0,"Very pretty color, a little longer than I expected but it works great with layering other pieces over it."
4.0,"My daughter loves these! I would order more in different colors, however, they need a button or clasp. I had to sew a hook and eye on the to keep them from unzipping."
4.0,"Fabric is soft and comfortable, a nice fit without being clingy. A little longer than I expected."
4.0,"Had to return it because it was too small, and didn't come in a larger size.  It was really nice though, and a great color!"
4.0,I like everything except the padding in the bra part of the suit.  It is not properly proportioned so I had to actually remove them so I could wear the suit.  The fabric is great and it is a nice suit and really great for the price.
4.0,"Kid liked it, fit well"
4.0,I feel the glasses have really made a difference for the better when subjected to long days viewing a monitor. The only reason I didn’t give them 5 stars is the frames are a little too narrow even with the flex hinges.
4.0,Now I think he has enough sox!!
4.0,"These sunglasses are awesome.  They are light weight, fit well, and stay in place reasonably well even during dynamic activities.  The lenses are a bit dark for early spring, but will be perfect in the summer."
4.0,Pretty dress! Plan to wear it as a swimsuit cover-up but can go from pool at a resort to lunch with a look of elegance!
4.0,Nice summer dress.
4.0,"The top is very cute and I like it a lot and I get a lot of compliments when I wear it, however the bottoms are not so great for me. But that is okay, I ordered a large set since they don't come separately, and I am a medium in bottoms, so it wasn't anyone's fault, I could just order another set in medium but I don't need it. I wish bikinis had the option to not come as a set so I could get a different size bottom and large but for the same price as a set."
4.0,nice for the price. cool for running around in hot florida weather!
4.0,"When ordering, please remember they run small. My wife won't let me wear these in public because of how tight they are."
4.0,it was alittle  big but she can use it longer and not grow out of it in a few mo this.
4.0,"Very pretty and sparkly. I've been looking for a gold belly button ring for awhile and I have finally found one I really love. I always make sure to take it off before I workout and before I shower because I am unsure how fragile it is or if it will change colour once water hits it. Overall though, I do really like it and I ordered the same one in silver"
4.0,The blouse is terrific.
4.0,Beautiful but I wish it was more bigger
4.0,These capes are horrible! They showed a picture of the cape covering a persons whole body .. these capes are shorter than a babies bib!!!!! This is a total ripoff and when I went to send them back they wouldn’t accept them and now I have to contact Amazon.. what an inconvenience!!
4.0,This is a great light weight scarf.  It can be dressed up or down depending on your mood.
4.0,"Was a very cute necklace, nice quality. I bought it for my granddaughter for Christmas. She loves dolphins"
4.0,This purse is soft and I like that!
4.0,"I  purchased this nightgown as well as another flannel one from National. I usually buy medium in nightwear but got these in a large. The fit is comfortable although I would have gladly paid more for a little more &#34;fullness&#34;. The delivery was much quicker than had been anticipated which, spoiled as I am by Amazon Prime, made me happy.."
4.0,This is a great sweater! I am curvy so it isn't as big of course as it is on the model so don't expect that if your bigger lol. It also is darker than the picture but all in all it's a super cute sweater and I love it.
4.0,I liked the variety of Cats and will buy them again
4.0,Very nice just loved them
4.0,"My almost 2 yr old son loves these mittens. As soon as I opened the package he wanted to put a pair on and then wore them for pretty much the rest of the night around the house. They are exactly what I was looking for, a lightweight mitten that was small enough that my son could wear them comfortably and they had a thumb so he could function and grasp things. Other mittens I have found have been way too big or don't have a thumb, so they are cozy, but he can't grasp anything which drives him nuts. They are not super high quality, but for something he will use for a relatively short time, they don't have to be super high quality. They are nice enough and there are enough in the pack, that if he loses a pair or two we'll still have something for back up. I would have liked to be able to get these in dark blue and green instead of light and dark pink...but not a big deal. Any pairs he doesn't end up wearing will get donated, so it's all good. These are not for the snow - I bought fleece lined mittens (which turned out to be too big) for the much colder, wet weather and snow."
4.0,Great color! The fit is basically fine except garment is too long. I am 5'6&#34; and had to have 4+ inches cut off the hem.
4.0,Beautiful!! It looked amazing!! Would buy again.
4.0,"I purchased the smallest size and it was still too big. I thought the dress itself was nice and well made, it just didn't fit me."
4.0,very cute but runs quite small.  I ordered  a large based on reviews.  normally I wear mediums in workout type gear.  I guess this would fit like the layering tops Under Armour carries
4.0,exactly what you would expect was a day early on the shipping even. only complaint is that the hands come closer to each other then shown in the​ photo so it can make it look like you have no boob it hold it up.
4.0,A little smaller than I expected. Wanted a looser fit .
4.0,"I purchased these earrings as a gift for my mom for Mother's Day.  A couple of years ago I purchased some 9mm pearl dangle earrings for her in sterling silver and was looking for something she might like in yellow gold.  These are very pretty earrings and arrived in a beautiful package, however, both the hoop and the pearl were smaller than I was looking for.  I returned them but will certainly consider buying from La Regis Jewelry in the future because of the high quality of the jewelry and beautiful packaging."
4.0,"What can I say, I do like the retro fit of the watch. Very basic and functional."
4.0,"I knew I was going to have issues with this dress because buttons down the front dont really agree with my chest.  I was quite surprised I could even get this dress on.  It seemed like it would be way too small.  It was pretty wrinkled but thats to be expected.  Its really adorable and fun.  The cap sleeves are a bit squared and I fill a little constricted in it.  I cant wear the dress because of the chest- it sorta buttons but is obviously way too tight.  I wear a 42DDD so I'm not too shocked.  I usually wear a 16-18 and the rest of the dress fit like a glove.  The material is nice- the color is vibrant.  There was some weird puckering or something in the hip area but not too noticable.  I'm in the process of losing weight (down 30 pounds so far, woop woop) so I may hang on to this in case any of my chest goes away (or if i reach my goal weight and get a breast reduction).  I would say this dress would fit best on someone smaller than a D cup.  I buy a lot of 1950s style dresses- they are so flattering, especially on us curvy girls- typically they will come with a belt or sash that I never use because they are always crap- this one was exactly as pictured and I really like it. Sorry the full length picture doesnt give a great idea on the fit- but the other picture shows where the buttons hate me.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.

4.0,"The delivery was fantastic but a few of the hats did not work. Trying to collect them all as they were gifts and send them back. The ones that work, however, are great. I purchased 13 hats so the odds are still good.<br />Barbara Remington"
4.0,"Really comfy and looose hoodie, only the sleeves were a little too loose for my liking. Besides that it was comfy."
4.0,"Wish they pulled up on the ankle higher.These are made for people with smaller feet. I take a size 7 shoe and they work okay, anyone with a bigger foot should look for socks that are bigger."
4.0,"This is what the French inscription means on this necklace. It is a nice piece, not as nice as I had hoped, but nice. The detailing is not as clearly engraved as I would have liked. It looks as if it was machine stamped, which I am sure it was due to low price. It doesn't look old like I thought it would. Nevertheless, the necklace is nice. I placed a picture inside the locket and gave it to my daughter because my love for her means more than my own life."
4.0,"Overall they’re pretty nice.<br />Real leather<br />Not too thick so you can still use your hands<br /><br />They look very nice<br /><br />Touch screen use works great when new, but once they’re broke in and no longer perfect and shiny they don’t work that well but it not a big deal.<br /><br />Warmer than you would think they would be for how thin they are, they’re good down to about 5 degrees Fahrenheit outside. Much colder than that and my girlfriends hands are getting cold real quick."
4.0,These are the most comfortable flip flops ever...even after lots of wear...the reason for just four stars is the beautiful medallions come off eventually  so need to be attached in a better way...other than that..they are what i reach for...fast service from Amazon too!
4.0,Works well. You have to play with it a lot before it starts to free spin. Still worth the price and happy with the product.
4.0,Great earrings but smaller in size than expected
4.0,I figured these were actually MINI bows (very lightweight) because I didn't read the full description but keep in mind THEY ARE HEAVY and made of some sort of metal. They come in a cute gift box with a Christmas card - which is great for a gift.
4.0,Seems to be a great quality and comfortable shoes. Still a bit big for my son so he is not wearing it yet.
4.0,Queda pequeño pero es lindo sus colores son vivos
4.0,"I usually wear a L for jammies as I like room while sleeping. I bought an XL knowing it comes from a chines designer which are notoriously running small. A size XL runs like a M-L size.<br /><br />However, I don’t give 4 stars because of that. 4 stars because I had the stitches for the bottom holes but there was no cut to put the button through. Nothing a shaving knife couldn’t fix"
4.0,seemed 2 b good quality
4.0,This is a super cute dress. Comfy. And I love the pockets. Only downside is it’s stretchy so after wearing it for 8-10 hours it’s actually stretched out some.
4.0,Cheap but they work
4.0,Great quality on the material but I do wish it was a little sturdier
4.0,It is way too long . I’m going to have to spend a lot of money to get it hemmed.
4.0,face mask protection
4.0,"Finally, some Amazon-bought teardrops that actually stay in, and don't fall out! Not sure if they're real amethyst or not, & I'm not sure how I would be able to tell; but they are beautiful and look fairly authentic. Pretty lightweight, so I wouldn't be surprised if they were acrylic."
4.0,"I like the shirt a lot, but I have to return for a size Small.<br />I am 5'6"" 150lbs and the Medium was far too large."
4.0,Liked the fabric and the silky feel
4.0,I like that they are a perfect fit
4.0,Was made nicely and fabric was soft.
4.0,"I liked this scarf and it looks exactly as advertised. My only complaint is that it came with a funky sour smell and I had to wash it a few times before I could wear it. Other than that, I would recommend it!"
4.0,"Too long, but very nice"
4.0,Great Necklace and looks just like the photo. Just wish it had more shine to it but overall satisfied with the purchase.
4.0,"Bought this as a gift for a beachy mermaid kinda girl.  It's a GREAT price but my only complaint is that the wording is so small yu can barely read it.  All the straps and charms are smaller than they appear, but it does make a great little gift!"
4.0,Soooo cute just a little to big for my princess at the moment but once she grows into it it will be so cute
4.0,It is smaller as picture but it's cute. I use with other Silver bracelets. Again this ships from China so it will take longer to recieve. But I like it.<br />.
4.0,I wish this boot had fit me.  It's so beautiful.  I have long toes and three the same length so I need a more rounded or square-toed shoe.  It's a bit pointed near the toe and was very tight.  I could tell that going up a half a size would not help.  I wear a medium width and would have needed a wide or at least one size up to wear this.
4.0,Simple but pretty and the price was great!
4.0,"looks good on me, just a little see through."
4.0,There’s really nothing wrong with these slippers. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because the description never mentioned that the large were for men. When I received my package the label said “Men” so they obviously were too big for me since I’m not a man.
4.0,"I tried this out for a day.  I walked around with it tucked into my pants all day while at work.  It worked nicely.  I don't wear belts so it wasn't really secure but that's just because I didn't realize I needed to wear a belt to hold it securely on my hip.  The backing of it is soft against your skin.  It has lots of useful pockets.  You have to be careful about what you put in there because you wouldn't be able to sit if say you had a pen in there that was vertical.  But you certainly could if you used it with either of the handy straps it comes with.  It's very nice, well made, quality fabric.  I'll definitely use it when traveling."
4.0,The leggings are very soft. Pretty strechy but i would recommend ordering a size bigger than you normally get.
4.0,Very cute. Can't wait to pair with leggings and tall boots
4.0,"My wife and I never travel with good jewelry or watches. This watch is a good option due to the low price and a stated battery life of 7 years. In any case, I just switched it to a 24 hour clock when we left. It also has an alarm feature that we did not use since we each used the alarm on our cell phones. The only negative is the built-in light. When traveling, you may want to know what time it is while in bed. The built-in light was rather useless since it is so dim, at least to my eyes. Otherwise, it got wet often and I showered with it on with no problems."
4.0,"Comfortable and nice fitting. Didn't expect the material to be so thin & a bit see through; otherwise, great product."
4.0,Very pretty. Lite not heavy at all!!!
4.0,"Beautiful dress! Sequins gets everywhere when you put it on, but it's great. Just gave four stars cuz it was a little uncomfortable... But it's hard not to when you're wearing that much sequins."
4.0,"Very nice beginning hiking back pack.  Just purchased for my new Boy Scout.  Has all of the features to carry additional gear strapped on; sleeping bag, mat, hiking poles.  Enough capacity for their normal two day camping trips.  Zippers might not be as sturdy as I would like, but overall a very nice pack."
4.0,"I ordered a large as I tend to fluctuate between a medium and large depending on the coat/jacket, that was the right decision. This is relatively warm coat (I would say 40+ degrees you should be good). I wouldn't wear it if it was lower then 40 or so out. It's flattering and the color is as expected."
4.0,"I grabbed the size I would normally get, only because I like my yoga pants to be tight to smooth my body. I expected they might be a bit sheer when I bend over, and they are, but it is not as bad as it could be. The waistband rolls a bit. The construction of the pants is great. I'll probably buy more"
4.0,Very curve hugging and pretty.
4.0,The build quality of these boots are great for the price.
4.0,"I really liked this product, really because of how it looks in the gym. That being said its actually way tighter on your lats then you might expect. From the photo youd expect the arm to cut below your lats but the arm sleeve is right below your armpit which can make you feel extremely constricted. Happy to have bought once definitely would not buy again..."
4.0,"I was hoping these (at least the Wet Stuff) bags would be waterproof and could be used for soiled clothes or pool clothes.<br />The bags have a nice liner that allow for easy clean up but they do not hold water/wetness. The sewn edge seams and zipper top allow water to easily leak out.<br />For this reason I docked one star.<br />Otherwise I really like these bags.<br />I think the bags are well made and the design/wording is cute.<br />These would be a good gift for a new mom.<br />They come in a plastic bag with a cute saying “Mom, You’re a superhero, period!"
4.0,I have only watched them once and I'm hoping that the elastic holds up. Very light and comfortable
4.0,Just need aftermarket insoles added for extra cushion and support
4.0,"Got to me fairly fast, good quality. Turned my finger a little green, but that's not the first time and it came off easily. Putting nail polish over it should prevent that."
4.0,"I've tried several other similar products, which have all become stretched out and no longer fit. These are the only ones the hold true to size."
4.0,Very pretty dress I like it the colors are beautiful
4.0,these are made extremely great they look very good they feel very nice to come with the filters butI bought these with the option to get a dog or child size I ordered the child size but they completely cover my kids entire face too large could be a bit smaller
4.0,Super cute and sassy. Fit well.
4.0,"I made mistake and ordered it too small, I did get it on but too tight for me to wear, but it is so nice that I am keeping it for a gift for my daughter."
4.0,"The material of this hat is a bit rough but the inside that touches your head and skin is a bit softer than the outside so it's alright. Does seem like it would keep your head warm and has enough extra material to cover your ears too, if you want.<br />The print is very understated and not obnoxious...very outdoorsy and the wolves are nice.<br />Product came in good/new condition."
4.0,I like the way I can breathe in it but it seems a little bit too small. I have to pull on it to loosen it around my neck. Until then I feel like I’m choking. Otherwise I am pleased with the product.
4.0,Bought this for my kids for Christmas since they are Boy Scouts. They were really excited about it but they are pretty large. Meant for an adult male.
4.0,Read the description. The material was very cheap
4.0,"Granddaughter happy, Grandad happy"
4.0,"I like the dress... but I wish they make it in more colors. Ivory color,  camel color, emerald green color would be very nice."
4.0,Great colors but very thin and wide.  Still good value and holds up through washes. I like the look on my head as well.
4.0,Very pleased with the material and fit. Cute top.
4.0,"They're pretty well made except for where the waist meets the butt area, it goes from super thick to sheer enough for me to see my skin for a quarter of a centimeter back to very thick down the leg. Did the bend over test and the bf couldnt see anything so it's a winner for me! Great value if they last longer than my rue 21s or champion brands, will update!"
4.0,"Looks great , the blue will stand out in a crowd."
4.0,Color is a little off but not too bad.
4.0,"These are adorable and very warm! They do run narrow so it may be a little uncomfortable at first. I wish they had a hardier covering on the bottom rather than just suede, but I do wear them indoors only so they serve their purpose."
4.0,"Absolutely perfect for my civil ceremony before our destination wedding! Perfect fit, and so many complements!"
4.0,Great quality and super comfortable!
4.0,These glasses are light weight but feel very durable. They look fantastic and the purple mirrored lenses are awesome! Cuts down glare and work great when I'm driving west into work at sunrise :)
4.0,"The watch looks great and so far has worked perfectly.  My only complaint is that the rough sides of the band sometimes catch on fibers on my shirts, especially if they are knit/woven.  I do not wear this watch with those particular shirts anymore, but I love the way it looks otherwise."
4.0,"Nice dress, but halter type back. Somewhat large."
4.0,"I bought these for my 4-year-old to wear under his shin guards. They fit well and go up to his knee. They are the thickness of his everyday socks, but he only plays once a week, and they worked well for our purposes."
4.0,Pretty small but nice bow tie and nice quality
4.0,Colorful tie that looks good.
4.0,"Very cute, high quality clasp. But a little on the expensive side.."
4.0,"The bag fits my MacBook Pro and my iPad Pro, as well as chargers and my phone.  It doesn't have a lot of room for extras, files, papers, but I like the sleek design.  The only problem was that the strap was poorly made--it was cracked at the edges, not designed to last.  I contacted the company and they were quick to resolve the issue.  Great customer service!"
4.0,"I had to knock off a star on this one. It looks wonderful and measures in line with the listing. However, it is scratchy and uncomfortable. I found it uncomfortable to wear and gave it to a friend to try who said it works for her because she can't feel it very well. So, if you don't have a problem with scratchy things, on your chest and your neck and arms, then this is great, truly, but, if you can feel it, the way I can, it will drive you a little crazy trying to wear this thing. I love the look, but it had to go to someone who could tolerate the feel. Good luck finding what will work for your needs. This didn't work for me, but a friend of mine loves it."
4.0,We got this for our 10 yr old one size too big and found it to be small. She was able to wear it twice before we had to donate it to a nearby family shelter.
4.0,Pues lo que me gustó de este reloj es que me funciona bien
4.0,"Like everyone else has said these do run a bit larger, so if in doubt order a size smaller. I normally wear medium and the small fit wonderfully. They wear great, cover my slightly rounder posterior perfectly with no riding up and don't squeeze at all. My one negative which has me taking away a star is that maxi pads don't stick to them at all. I got the darker pack hoping I could use the black pairs to replace my period panties, nope. That may not influence some of you ladies, but it was a slight disappointment to me."
4.0,Made well and fit true to size and cute idea for cousins boys and girls got one fore my son and then my baby niece.
4.0,It smelled really bad when I received it! It's fits ok for the occasion! Fast shipper!
4.0,It's cute & serves the purpose.
4.0,Absolutely gorgeous and very soft and warm. The material is very delicate so don't get it caught on anything otherwise threads will come loose.
4.0,"I’m 5’8” and 140ish lbs. Usually in between a small and medium, but ordered a medium. When I took this dress out of the package, it looked like it was going to be too large. However, it fit perfectly once on- possibly a little large in the chest. Its very flattering though, even after a large meal. Haven’t washed it yet, so I don’t know what will happen once I do. But I would highly recommend it from what I’ve seen so far."
4.0,"A great product, the best sandal I have yet to purchase from Amazon. Will recommend this to my friends"
4.0,A bit bigger than expected
4.0,Decent watch OK so far
4.0,Looked great on but considering I am short it was way to long!
4.0,"I got this outfit for my 10 year old daughter in the 11/12 size. The leggings fit great but the hoodie did not. The bodice of the hoodie fit with room but the arms came up 3” above the wrist. It’s also extremely sheer and thin, once winter comes it will be useless unless layered up. More for spring but overall cute as it is."
4.0,"They are gorgeous. Very strong. You cannot bend them. Shiny, shiny and look exactly like real gold. But I’m only giving four stars because on a small, medium, large scale, they are SMALL. Going to gift them away. Very disappointed."
4.0,This outfit is really cute. The only reason I didn't  give it 5 stars is because the shirt is quite thin (almost see-through) and not very stretchy.
4.0,Good for the price.<br />Little too big for my taste
4.0,"Overall, the quality is pretty good. The printing is exactly as shown, but I was disappointed by the snaps. It all the photos, it appears they are the metal snaps, but the onesie I received has the flimsy plastic snaps."
4.0,I like them but they're a bit scratchy.
4.0,Nice thickness! Still comfortable to breath
4.0,"The raincoat worked as needed. It doesn't seem to be something I'd use multiple times but I do keep two in the glove compartment just in case I'm caught in a storm off guard. I would recommend this to someone who doesn't normally wear raincoats but might need one in a bind for a one to 3 time use.<br />Also, I would say it was somewhat large but this is only because I'm a thin person."
4.0,"There isn't much to say other than its a cute bag, and that I would recommend it"
4.0,"Very soft,  but big in size"
4.0,A bit on the narrow side unlike my other Tommy Bahama glasses but an attractive pair of glasses.
4.0,"It is as advertised, but beware that it in the full light of the sun, you'll be giving away your secrets. :D"
4.0,"A pretty dress.<br />The pattern and fabric seemed a little different to the picture.<br />It fits well, drapes nicely.<br />So overall I am satisfied."
4.0,Loved this top but it runs small
4.0,I fodnt give 5 stars due to the umbrella flipping up when it was windy. All is all its sturdy and I like it.
4.0,"Had to take the top part in on the sides a bit for my daughter but super cute, good quality dress. Perfect for “dress like your favorite decade” spirit day at school."
4.0,I purchased this dress for a formal luncheon. It served the purpose. It is conservative but not boring.<br />Fabric is low quality and stiff. I would not wear this dress frequently. However style is very nice but it would have been nicer if the fabric was more draping and less stiff. It was also very hard to iron. Overall I liked the navy color and the fit was OK.
4.0,Fits great!  Love it!!
4.0,Fits great my stats are 5ft 5&#34;- 38 34 45 I got the 2xl. Only gave 4 stars because the blue was a bit different than pictured I thought it was a baby blue but it was more turquoise still cute tho. Very nice material hugs your curves and it fell just below my knees.
4.0,This dress was fine. It looked like the picture. It would be good to wear out or even with other accessories for a Renaissance fair. It was pretty. The color was nice. It was fairly comfortable. I felt the sizing was good. I liked the ruffled sleeves. It was a good length. It was as described.
4.0,Quality Fabric
4.0,"Ok, so this isn’t the sexiest hat BUT it’s the most practical!!! I needed  a sun hat to protect my face, ears and hairline from sunburn. Most I’ve tried either didn’t have a strap and they blow away or they fit tight and you can’t wear sunglasses with or they are big and bulky and hard to pack.  This is about as perfect as I could get for a reasonable price that I will actually wear. The only way this could be approved upon is if the top was perforated to allow some airflow.  But that said my head has not felt hot when wearing it.  It came perfect out of the bag and folds flat so it’s easy to toss in a beach bag.  I can even wear my ponytail or low bun with this hat! Some people mentioned a wire in the brim but as far as I can tell there isn’t one.  It’s a great buy!"
4.0,The package was sent fast. It fit comfortably and my child was happy... and cracking up because of his choice. He said he is a Fit Mike!
4.0,so far so good it does what its supposed to do and inexpensive.  I would recommend it to anybody. Quiet.
4.0,More on the cream side of white
4.0,"Pendant too small. FYI, it's the exact same size as the earrings. Wish it were larger."
4.0,"I bought this gun for a last minute cosplay (can you guess who?) and it serves its purpose well. The gun is surprisingly sturdy but light. Most of the details are accurate, but it doesn't light up nor is it as accurate as the picture details on the listing. the D.VA logo on the side is a sticker that is lifted toward the end, and it has a white outlining that makes it more apparent as a sticker lol. Besides a few details that take away from the design, I'm happy with the product because it shipped incredibly fast despite being from china.<br /><br />However... if you have more time and want a more accurate prop, I suggest you buy the power bank/ light up guns I've seen around amazon for $20+ more"
4.0,"Lightweight, easy to wear, goes with everything"
4.0,Very happy with purchase fits and looks very nice
4.0,This hat is nice but it is too small for my big head.  If you fall into the medium or small head category than this is your hat!
4.0,MY WIFE WANTED  a more comfortable purse to put over her shoulder and one with a lot of set up options. This works well for her.
4.0,"I do a lot of pallet dismantling for home projects and was constantly cutting or scraping my arms. I ordered these sleeves to protect my arms. They do a super job, but I had to modify mine. They come only with shoe laces to tie them on. Sorry, but I can't tie anything behind my back. I tried tying them in the front, but didn't like the laces hanging down. I ordered some 3"" wide hook and loop, attached it so I could fasten it in the front and now I'm in business. They repel nails and staples and the occasional slip really well. They are a good sound investment, but they need some type of  closure more than a pair of shoelaces."
4.0,Pretty design.  A little on the small side.  Button Pearls (not round).
4.0,"Oddly enough, it’s understated for rhinestone clutch. I know it sounds impossible but it’s just not gaudy. It’s such a beautiful, tasteful clutch. The rhinestone mesh is dainty & sparkles beautifully. That being said, my clasp arrived broken. The larger ball is unscrewed but I can’t figure out how to grasp it to try to screw it back on. If I can’t figure it out, i’m going to have to return it... which is a shame. Honestly, might just repurchase it to receive one that isn’t broken. That’s how much I like it."
4.0,"light weight soft fabric, looks really cute with leggings."
4.0,This purse is very good quality and I love the material.
4.0,"These are the first bifocal sunglasses my husband has ever had, and he’s thrilled to be able to eliminate a pair of reading glasses when he’s outside.  The glasses touch his cheeks, and he’s not too thrilled with that, but that may not be a problem with anyone else. Also, he has trouble with his peripheral vision while driving with these on, but he’s pretty happy with them when he’s not behind the wheel. They seem to be of high quality, and I think they will last a long time."
4.0,as expected took a long time
4.0,"Very cute. I wear a large/XL. I bought the large version NOT the plus size version. It fit perfectly. Made like most costumes, with cheaper materials but is well put together and does not look cheapy. Should be a hit a Disney in it. Thanks!"
4.0,Felling beter when washed
4.0,Great buy. Lots of compliments. Not uncomfortable to wear.
4.0,I read the reviews and people said this runs small so I ordered a size up and it's way to big. Buuuut I will be ordering more to wear with legings. I got so many compliments on it.
4.0,Pretty good quality and not bad price
4.0,The bracelet was as well made as others of this style.  The bracelet is very cute.  But it is hard to read the tiny print on it.
4.0,"Light weight pair of shorts. I also ordered ore,"
4.0,"extremely comfy and warm, just wish it was a little looser but no big"
4.0,Love this pillow cover
4.0,Good leather buckle meh...
4.0,"Even though it did not fit me because i forgot to order it in a size bigger since it said it ran small, I still loved the dress n material"
4.0,"I am pleased with this attractive deep black cardigan with pointelle insets. It has three quarter sleeves. The length was slightly longer than I expected, which I like. It is a little heavier than I expected from the pictures, and a little less lacy. Still very nice and useful for spring or fall wear. It would make a nice change from a regular jacket for office wear."
4.0,"So very cute. And fits me perfectly  (5'7 and 135lbs). Very well made...my arrived with the tiniest snag above the knee, oh well, still love them!"
4.0,Went above and beyond for customers. Excellent customer service.  Bracelet was a little different then what was expected.
4.0,pretty but way to big. I have to push it way up my arm but it looks so beautiful
4.0,"This hoodie fit me, but if you wear a shirt underneath, buy one-size up."
4.0,It was fine. The only problem that I had was delivered later than promised.
4.0,"I am 5'2&#34; and do not have a long torso, this hits me just below my bottom, could not wear as a dress,the white design is comparible to an iron on transfer (like rubber numbers on a jersey but it is cute."
4.0,A little see thru I wear a medium/large and the large fit great
4.0,I'm happy with this shirt and it looks like the photos. It's soft and comfortable with room to move freely. I'm between a large and medium but got the M. It was suggested I get the large but I'm glad I didn't. I'm happy with the shirt!
4.0,"What I was expecting. Fits great, no complaints"
4.0,"The roses are pretty, hence the four-star rating. However, they are NOT KIDDING about &#34;mini&#34;, because these are so small that at the moment my plan is to remove the roses from the hoops they're currently on and put them on dangling hooks instead because I can't manage closing those hoops when I can't see what I'm doing, which is basically the case if they're going in my ears.<br /><br />Basically, if your hands are okay (mine aren't) and you like small earrings, these may be just fine for you and I have no plans to return them, I just now have a baseline for &#34;okay, too small for my hand issues and my style preferences&#34;. I haven't worn them yet, so I have no idea whether these are a potential metal allergy problem for some people (and given I've worn $2 convenience store earrings without an allergic reaction I'm not really the best judge of that anyway)."
4.0,Based on the reviews I bought the large which had to be adjusted as it was a bit big. I am 5'9 170 and I think the medium would have been a perfect fit for me.
4.0,"This fits good and my wrist is not that small at all.<br />It looks a little different than the one pictured but<br />only the heart. It's a bit thinner. It's not Sterling Silver . 925. That is misleading and I don't know why they do it, but they do. Buyers should know<br />for this price it can't be .925 . Look up some real 925 and you'll see. I like this bracelet so far . It's nice and shiny. I always put &#34;Jewelry Protectant &#34;<br />on all my inexpensive jewelry no matter where it<br />comes from. If it's Alloy, which nearly all the pieces I have bought are, you'll want to put that protectant on them or some people use clear nail polish though that comes off quicker and you will need to repeat many times. Then you have to know you really do get what you pay for. I've learned that the hard way but it is really addicting!<br />It feels good to want it and it feels good to get it brought right to you ,though sometimes it's a real bummer. Hope this helps : )"
4.0,these seem to help with headlights coming at you when its dark. this particular pair kind of sits crooked on my face and I can't seem to straighten them. they are kind of heavy as well.
4.0,Product is exactly as seen
4.0,Very nice dress it fits just right.
4.0,"I liked this product overall. The pendant is about the size of a nickel and weighs just about it much so it stays in place fairly well on your neck. The smaller chain is one size and very very lightweight. It does wrap up in the other necklace fairly easily. I loved the design of the pendant with the initial, however I didn't like that there was a cross on the backside of it. I am not religious and felt funny wearing it. Not for me, but pretty nonetheless."
4.0,This was a gift but so far they went over well and seem to be as ordered.
4.0,Really love this dress. I think it runs a little big though.
4.0,My boyfriend wanted the gloves to wear when he puts lotion on his hands at night sleeping.  He says they work fine for that purpose.  Will buy again when these wear out.
4.0,"I love this but there are a few things you should be aware of before ordering. These are for a small d cup or smaller. They are also for small ribcages. I wear a 28D. It fits me snug around but well in the cup. I found its more for sleeping or lounging at my size opposed to actual support. The foam padding is thin, yet prevents the visible nipple. I love them and will order again. Mine had a few small defects but I was able to fix it quicker than shipping back. Seller was very helpful too."
4.0,"I work at the happiest place on Earth and I needed a mask that is rugged, can make it in a rainstorm, and looks professional. many fellow castmembers are ordering them in different colors."
4.0,Fits nicely and looks great! Not the best material though.
4.0,"If between sizes, size up.<br />I like it. Know that the colors are Definitely bright"
4.0,Made with durable products!
4.0,"They fit well and look good, but they do make a klicking noise when you walk. Could be the tread on soles."
4.0,"Love these earrings, their light weight!"
4.0,"Nice looking hat, but too large!  My hat size is7 and 3/8 and the hat falls down my neck."
4.0,"The hat is beautiful and I love it, I just can't wear it as its too big!!! It falls down and goes over my eyes!!!"
4.0,"5'4/152lbs/34C, Very cute, can be dressed up or down, material is stretchy, but fits very well, belt is a little large, I don't really care for the button on the back but overall its great"
4.0,Gorgeous lace dress.
4.0,"I love the look of these simple silver earrings. They are so convenient for times when I want to have earrings in, but don't want to change them all the time. They go with everything. I can wear them to bed, in the shower, while exercising. Because of the seamless attachment at the top, they don't get caught on things or poke me while I'm sleeping. They never fall out  by accident, and there's no separate back piece that can get lost. What's not so good about them is that they are a little hard to get on and off, so they really are only convenient for times when you want to wear them for several days without changing them. Also, the little wire that goes through the earlobe has a very fragile little hinge. Mine has now broken off so that I can't wear these earrings anymore. I liked them so much that I'm actually thinking about buying them again anyway."
4.0,Much tighter fit in the strap than other Nike sandals/thongs I have owned in the same size. Otherwise comfortable.
4.0,Fits great. I am 5' 112lb and ordered a small. Not a lot of support but my breast don't need much. So for a cute crop top great. As a sports bra maybe not
4.0,"Hace dos años compré una par de leggins Felina en Costco y podría decir que eran casi perfectos: no transparentaban, tela gruesa pero no calurosa y no se enrollaba en el abdomen. Ahora bien, estos leggins son de la misma marca pero su calidad es menor, la tela es transparente y corren más grandes que los otros que tengo aunque son la misma talla"
4.0,"A nice piece but the actual product didn't have the same level of texture it appears to have in the picture, it was more of a flat piece with detail engraved.  Purchased as a gift and the recipient was happy with it which was the important part."
4.0,"Got mine a few days before the suggested delivery date. Great shipping. And the packaging was wonderfully wrapped. Unfortunately, the only downside to the necklace is that it doesn't have much weight to the metal. It seems to be made of a very soft metal, so the ring bends easily."
4.0,"Surprisingly soft and well made for the price, I'm very happy with this item."
4.0,"Very nice heavy, 1/8in thick leather belt.  This is not a woven belt but has to look of a woven belt which I think is better.  I don't think woven belts hold up over time.  Nice, sturdy gold buckle.  This belt is 1 1/2 in wide.  Good basic belt should last a while."
4.0,I bought up in size for my toddler which I should of just bought her the same size she normally wears.
4.0,Nice leggings. Purchased them for my daughter to use with her peacock Halloween costume. Nice color. Fit a bit tight through the thigh (even though she is very slim) but they became more comfortable after a few minutes of wear.
4.0,"The only issue with this dress is that it's ""top heavy"".."
4.0,"Looks just like the picture, just with that you didn't have to add the clasp on to it because it won't stay on."
4.0,"This ring fits pops perfectly, it's plain but that's what I was looking for. Think it's a little over priced for how plain this is but decided it was worth it to have another way to wear different jewel pops and get more use out of them."
4.0,"Bought them for my son. They fit perfectly, but the soles came off after the first use. Easy fix and still wearable."
4.0,These earrings are very pretty and just the size I wanted I like them a lot however the post part is a little thick and they have a clasp on the post and they really hurt my ears. I hope I can get used to them!
4.0,I like this dress but I noticed at the ruching a stitch was coming undone a little. I can fix it but it would be nice to have something solidly built.
4.0,Worked as describer.  Great product
4.0,As pictured but won't last long material is a bit cheap
4.0,"These are a bit bigger than I expected. Definitely Penny coin size, maybe nickel, but surprisingly light for the size. Overall a  good find."
4.0,Nice jacket just the arms are longer them described and neck smaller
4.0,"I received so many compliments on this dress!  Love the cut and feel.  Very Audrey Hepburn looking.  I only gave it 4 stars because I thought it was a little bit longer, but i'ts still not too short for work, but would have liked it to be a little longer.  I'll  order another in a different color!"
4.0,"i ordered to different pairs of leggings on amazon recently and these were by far the winners. pockets are great, and the fabric feels super soft. the mesh means they're breathable for working out, and the soft fabric everywhere else makes them great for lounging."
4.0,I really like the Sweatshirt. . The only thing I would change is that I would like a drawstring on the hood.  It wears well and washes well
4.0,"We chose the gold and silver pattern. The picture really doesn't capture how the silver highlights at the center of the X in the pattern catch the light - another reviewer said it &#34;shoots off bling&#34; and this is a pretty good description. We think it's a very nice effect, and my husband has set aside for special occasions. Quite something for a ten dollar tie!<br /><br />Another reviewer said the threads are falling apart quickly in her case; we found one minor defect with the stitching on the back, but actually the threads seem to be tougher than on many other ties."
4.0,"These have a great slimming fit, well-made I ordered Charcoal but it has a lot of green in it. If you want true charcoal color, don't order."
4.0,Product was as described and delivered on time
4.0,"This is nicely made - I haven't worn it long, so I don't know if it will tarnish.  It was a bit larger than I expected."
4.0,This is a little tight in the bust.
4.0,"I wanted to love these shorts so badly... Unfortunately, they are not flattering for those with curves in my opinion. They made me appear larger than I actually am. They were very comfortable though and the fabric was light which would be perfect for summer.<br />Guess this means I just need to lose some weight so I can feel better in these!"
4.0,Very warm and good memory foam
4.0,"I am 5'3&#34;, 150lbs, 34DD, and generally wear an 8/10.I bought this in a Medium which fits very well in the bust. You can't tell from the picture, but the hi/low bottom of this is very, very long in the back. It is definitely tunic length which would make this blouse good for layering with leggings and a cardigan or pairing ith skinny jeans in warmer weather."
4.0,The quality of the charm is very high and the only reason I didn’t give it five stars is because the charm is tiny. Like really small compared to the pictures which is disappointing.
4.0,Great for my job. Love the slim fit not bulky at all.
4.0,"It's an ok ring, nothing badazzling."
4.0,Fits well soft and looks good.<br />would recommend especially when on sale
4.0,"Fit my size 2p frame, just wish the lining is longer."
4.0,Material is soft and fits great
4.0,"Great watch, but even with my glasses on, my 47 year old eyes can not make out the time using the light. Very weak light. I had a Casio similar to this I bought in 1985 and remember it being a great watch. A blast from the past."
4.0,"It's much lighter than you may expect. Good for a costume. I love the under arm straps so it never flies off like a loose hood might. The material I quite thin, but decently enough made to stay in one piece"
4.0,My boss is a huge Patton fan. He loved it!
4.0,Not bad for a cheapie :)
4.0,"Arms are just a tad tight. But other than that, it's another to add to my collection."
4.0,"I read reviews in advance and was prepared for the small size.  I ordered really large and it fits well.  The arms are tight but I weight train so my biceps are larger so most people will be ok.  I really like this item and have worn it frequently without any issues.  Wears well, is very comfortable and I've received several compliments."
4.0,"Obviously not from Garmin but it fit my watch and did not have the ridges that the OEM band did so that’s why I bought it.  The one issue I had, as related to above, is that it is challenging to get onto the watch because of the machining/finishing of the latch mechanism. I got it on and it doesn’t seem like it will fall off so overall I’m happy with this purchase."
4.0,Fit a little tight but think that it is supposed to. Received many compliments.
4.0,Fits great. Easy to install. Lightweight...Definitely not the same quality as the ones that came with my sunglasses originally. we’ll see how they hold up.
4.0,"I bought this watch for my daughter-in-law and she was very happy with it.  I also bought extra bands (one for her and one for myself) and they're wearing very well.  I would buy this watch again, for sure.  Very nice watch for the price."
4.0,I liked it but the post was a little long for me so I always felt it inside my nose. Managed to yank it out and loose it while blowing my nose a few weeks after I got it. Pretty and I liked the larger size of it.
4.0,"Super comfy silk feeling. I’m 5’3” 150 pounds and the x-large was just slightly to big. The bottom of your butt cheeks will hang out the bottom of the shorts, but that’s the look."
4.0,"This shirt is cute.  The sleeves are a little shorter than expected, and the overall fit is a little smaller than I am used to in a large.  It does look just like the picture."
4.0,"I ordered 12/14, a little big but I love it."
4.0,"First thing to take notice is that you do get 110 pieces or 55 pairs of jewelry piercings, all of different designs. You will not get any duplicates as shown in the stock photo in the product description, you do get some different color variants but aside from that not one pair is the same.<br /><br />The quality is pretty decent seeing that it's a variety pack. The only problem is that it's very small and easy to lose, also it's hard to match together if you do not own a your own organizational jewelry box and have them bunched up in the zip lock bag it came with.<br /><br />Having 55 types to choose from is nice especially if you like to switch it up everyday instead of sticking to one piercing all the time.<br /><br />Overall good set of body jewelry, keep in mind that they may be on the small side and may be easy to lose if you don't have an organizational tool to store them in.<br /><br /> I received this product at a discount in exchange for a honest review"
4.0,Great fit for a slim body
4.0,Shirt is cheap and the neck is weird. I wear a small.
4.0,"The garment bag was nice, however it was not what I was looking for.  I wanted something that would have the ability for me to hang my cloths in it. This product was returned for that reason only.  The product was made well and looked nice. Good value for the price."
4.0,It is really beautiful.  Fit as expected.
4.0,Very cute. Have gotten compliments on it.
4.0,a bit low and thin but I keep wearing them
4.0,They are nice. Comfortable. I can't feel them in my ears. Had to check a couple of times to make sure they hadn't fallen out
4.0,"Overall, it was a fun experience to get these in the mail and spend some time opening them, but the pearls inside all looked... suspicious. They also fell out of the meat fairly easily, not requiring and really &#34;digging&#34; or prodding, which I'd expected after watching videos of people harvesting pearls. Of course, I'm no pearl expert, and they were pretty nonetheless, varying in color, size, and shape. For the price, I'm really not upset with what I received, and that's why I'm still giving these oysters 4 stars."
4.0,"Great fabric , colors. But too big for my 10 year old son ... my husband wears it from time to time and says it’s a little big too"
4.0,"My baby is 21 mos old and in size 6 but growing out of them so I got a 6.5 knowing they would run a bit large per the other comments and they were right, they fit like a 7 which is perfect so he can grow into them. They are sturdy, I was worried they would be too similar to slippers and I wanted shoes, but they are sturdy and great for outside. They are warm and cozy with fur inside. The only reason I didn’t do 5 stars is because the picture looked more maroon like his shirt by they are more of a burnt orange. Still cute though."
4.0,these earrings are definitely really heavy which is kind of expected. after a while you forget that they’re on which is good but if you’re not looking for some heavy/big earrings then these aren’t the ones! but otherwise i recommend!
4.0,Got this for our daughter's birthday. She loves it. It's very pretty and dainty.
4.0,"I would have given 5 stars apart from the glue or gunk on the lenses that was hard to remove. I tried soapy water, that didn't do anything. I resorted to nail polish and that worked. Not sure if I should have done that. Apart from that, they are a good fit and very comfy.Ideal for snow blowing or skiing."
4.0,"These chiffon skirts are really pretty and of much better quality than I expected for such a low price. However, they work best on tall, very slim body types. The actual shape of the skirt isn't as much A-line as it is trumpet. It tends to puff out just a bit under the waistband while the rest of it falls straight. While this shape might work great for a nice, thin girl with long legs, it didn't really flatter my short, straight body type at all. A shame because it really is a lovely skirt. The colors are very vibrant."
4.0,My 8th grader loved this
4.0,Runs small. Order two sizes up
4.0,Works well do wish some longer fasteners were available
4.0,"A little different than what I was expecting, mostly due to the fabric. Not as soft as I was hoping for, but still a nice wrap."
4.0,"My daughter likes this dress.<br /><br />She says it fits her well, and is comfortable.<br /><br />The print is pretty, and overall the dress is a nice look. Glad to have it."
4.0,"Much heavier than I was expecting, but nice. The size of it does make it a bit harder to get connected to the charger compared to the silicone band but nothing terrible."
4.0,"Very pretty dress...nice fit, just a little loose at the waist."
4.0,"Not dis-satisfied, but not overly impressed. Not that anyone would expect to be overly impressed by a sunglasses case"
4.0,"These are what I would call a tropical-weight fabric, pretty thin and lightweight, but cool, comfortable and a bit baggy - no one will mistake you for a fashion model wearing these!  These pants are cut to the style &#34;Loose&#34; which is baggier than UA's &#34;Regular&#34;. They stretch a bit but not nearly as much as the UA Storm Covert pants, for instance.  But they don't cost nearly as much, either.  For casual wear in hot weather, and even light-duty outdoors use, they seem to be fine, offering good freedom of movement.  There is no DWR finish on these pants to repel water - any moisture instantly soaks through, but they do dry quickly.  You will have to hem them to your desired length.<br /><br />When these were under $30 they were a good buy, I notice just after I wrote this review the price jumped up by $20.  Not worth it at that price."
4.0,Bought a size 6-7 for my soon to be six year old. She’s tall and slender and wearing size 7-8 leggings…and this thing is comically large and long on her! She loves it regardless; I just hope she loves it for the next year or two!
4.0,"Not a bad design and the material is comfortable enough. But definitely go for at least one size larger than you think you need. It is a cheap shirt through and through, but expected given the price."
4.0,"These were really nice pants.  I'm short, so they hit a little closer to the ankle on me, but I like the look.  The fabric is thick so no peekaboo panties issues."
4.0,"This jacket looks really good in person.  I probably needed it in XS but it doesn't come in that size.  However, should I need to wear it with a bulk sweater I could, or I can leave it open.  It doesn't really look all that much too big, but it is just not quite my size.  However, I chose to keep it because It looks so nice and goes anywhere and everywhere."
4.0,"I do not own the SS or RS versions of the Camaro. So I bought the Camaro keychain with the Chevy logo. As all three products seem to look the same, other than the lettering being different, I would suspect the review would justify for all. At first glance at the product pictures, I was expecting the keychain to feel thicker and denser. I was under the impression that the sand blasted metal parts were covered in a thin layer of Clear plastic. However, when the product arrived, the keychain was ultra light, and was made of one single piece of metal. Expected? Not really, but I was suprised at how much I liked it. It is a permanent piece in my Keychain collection. The shape and feel of the keychain is something special indeed. Unlike some of the other Car brand keychains out there, this one feels unique. By far the ONLY 2010 Camaro Keychain out there... and if there are more, this may be by far the best choice. If you are thinking of purchasing this keychain, I'll tell you right now, you won't regret the 10 dollars."
4.0,These shades are super fun to pair with a fun outfit. Optics could be better but they’re stylish and comfortable.
4.0,Comfortable though a bit small.  I will say they are probably two inches shorter at the ankle than depicted.
4.0,We ordered this and at first received a different dress. The seller contacted me and sent me the correct dress.  The correct dress is beautiful and will be perfect for my daughter to wear as a flower girl dress.
4.0,Cheep price and quality. But cute!
4.0,Good price and easy purchase. I love the hot pink ones. Has pockets on sides for phone.
4.0,I got 2 of these bracelets as gifts and they are adorable. But they are too big for my wrists and not adjustable. If they fit I would wear them everywhere. They are also heavy and bulky.
4.0,If u r looking for a comfortable wear this is just it
4.0,"The sunglasses do look somewhat close to the movie prop, but they are not that comfortable to wear. They are a bit narrow, and a bit too tall on the face. But then, not all of us have Robert Downey Jr.'s face. It's okay, and good for the price, but it's more of a cosplay prop."
4.0,"These are very comfortable and worked well on one five hour and  two 12-hour international flights.  I got the medium and I am at the lighter end of the scale recommended for medium so they were just tight enough and long enough for my long legs.  However, I was disappointed that they tore after only three wearings.  I'll probably try once more because I like the fit but they should last much longer."
4.0,I have been using this for a year already. It has lasted through everything actually! It has strong material and vivid colors. It also has enough space for all my needs inside. After a year it still looks the same as it did. 👍 the only problem I had is that its impossible to get my ID out of the first pocket😫
4.0,It's very pretty but it's also heavy. I purchased it to add to my Chatelaine but it's too heavy so it'll stay on the chain it came with. I will still use it for my embroidery.
4.0,I bought Medium and fit well my wife like it<br />The normal Size she uses is 8
4.0,"I thought the blue was a little darker but it's SUPER bright Royal blue. With the riffles and the heart buttons, it almost looks like a costume. It's well made though."
4.0,Wasn’t crazy about the quality
4.0,"I desperately bought this for an event coming up where everyone has to wear sequins. I HATE sequins personally, but this surprisingly worked! It fit perfect. I normally wear a size small, so I don't see how this could possibly fit someone that's a size large. The material does stretch, but not a whole lot. It might fit someone who typically wears a medium but it'd be tighter. It's also short, so if you have large boobs it will look more like a crop top on you. Weird, scratchy material, but it works for what I need it for! Would recommend ONLY to someone who can fit a size xsmall or small typically."
4.0,Ok glasses for the price
4.0,Cute!  Triangle is a little larger than I expected but I still wear it all the time.
4.0,"Love the style of this blouse! Although it is a little tight in the arms, I still like it. Suggest you order one size larger than normal."
4.0,"Very good shirt. Exactly what was in the picture, and fits true to size."
4.0,Very comfortable. I wear a 81/2 wide so I ordered size 9-10. A little big but not too big. Very pleased with this purchase.
4.0,"Decent Product. Somewhat small, but appreciative of the product."
4.0,Wife Christmas gift and she loves it and it fit right
4.0,"These nose rings were very pretty and seemed to be made of nice materials.  I really wanted it to work out, I swear I did!!  Lol, sadly these are a little to big for my nose and where the actual piercing is placed on my nostril.  If you like a SLIGHTLY larger hoop, this would be the nose jewlery for you.  However if you have a smaller nose or a low piercing, these might be a little too big."
4.0,"Definitely a dainty look.  Also, there's a piece that stops the little balls from moving too much on the earring but it does move a bit.  Lastly, these aren't as shiny as I'd hoped but The overall design and how they wear is excellent.  Great for an everyday bit of decoration where it's pretty but not overwhelming your OOTD."
4.0,Seems really short.  Shorter than the photo.
4.0,Like the product. Payed to much. Could of got a 3 pack different colors including cleAr for the same price
4.0,"It’s hard to find well made medical masks here, this item is great.  The value is great.  But it runs really small, it said it’s fitted for child 4-12, but my 7 years old with small face is snug in it.  I doubt they will fit next year.  I would love to buy more but afraid she will soon outgrown the mask.  Please make bigger ones.  They are really comfortable too according to kiddo."
4.0,"I am really enjoying this watch. Though it is very clearly automatic (you must wind it via the crown), and though the crown is definitely not a screw down as advertised, the watch runs smoothly after a good wind and from what I can tell, stays pretty accurate. I love the look of the watch and if I can find an honest seller, I will probably buy another like this."
4.0,"Turned out to be a bright pink rather than red. Luckily, I love this shade and i don't have a sweater of this color so I'm keeping it. If it was the right color, I would've given it 5."
4.0,"Dress is beautiful and well made.  You could wear this for a special occasion or as a costume.  I really didn't expect such a nice dress for the price paid.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the sizing seems off.  I went by the chart and ordered the size according to my measurements, it was way to tight.  I returned it (with no hassle)  and ordered a size up, it still was a little tight but manageable."
4.0,"You will want to check the diameter of a cuff or hoop that fits well before ordering.  I don't DISlike these ear cuffs, but I let myself be sucked in by the product photo on the model. Maybe I didn't think far enough ahead. But you will have to be pierced basically inside the ridge around your ear, or have a very particular ear anatomy to use these in a helix piercing. I would have said that I had been pierced pretty far on the outside of my helix but two of the three cuffs are uncomfortably tight and one won't fasten at all around my ear. I will keep them because they are pretty and they will fit one of my lobes but I will be surprised if they fit a lot of adults as an upper helix cuff."
4.0,This is a good looking wallet with few slots for credit cards.  Not sure if the magnet will hold the cash safely.  Will see!
4.0,"I love fun socks.  These could be more colorful but the bones show up fine with this background.  They are comfortable, fit good and I am very satisfied."
4.0,"I really like this dress, but there is one thing that bothers me and that is that the dress is about 6 inches too short for a maxi, and I'm only 5'5&#34; tall."
4.0,Really enjoy wearing this. Like the fit.
4.0,"This dress was more like a long shirt for me. I'm 5'9 and bought a Large. I will rate this a 4 star because of the quality of the material. It was very nice; felt wonderful. But unfortunately, this dress was not for me. I could have paired it with leggings, but that was not my goal for this dress.<br />I returned the dress and received a prompt refund. I do wish that this product had worked out for me."
4.0,"OK, Trump is a total joke, but this election season has been so bizarre I had to have a relic. People in the future might not believe that Republicans supported someone like this. The bumper sticker is good quality, it is slightly smaller than normal bumper stickers, though. Maybe that's so it can fit between a confederate flag and a Klan sticker."
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised with this dress. It is very elegant and I wore it to a nice ball and got compliments for it. It is quite tight though, so you might want to use some shapewear under it."
4.0,"My daughter needed a 40's style dress for a tap routine and this definitely fit the bill!  When the choreographer saw how beautifully the skirt flared out on spins, she squealed with delight. It fits nicely and is below the knee (which is important in a day in age where you can barely find clothes that cover your backside) and looks exactly like the picture shows (we bought the red and white plaid).  The only drawback was the collar.  It tends to pooch a little bit if you aren't standing perfectly straight (if you look closely at the model's picture, you will see what I mean) but isn't a big deal unless you were wanting it to lay perfectly flat against your neckline.  All in all, it is a wonderful dress, well made (not thin or cheap looking, has some weight to it).  If you were on the fence I would say go ahead and get it.  My daughter is almost 14, about 5'4 with a dancers build and we bought the small which fits almost perfectly (a little large in the bust area, but on a full grown woman it would probably be fine if you are typically a size small.)"
4.0,"Nice look, refined, the color is not exactly the same as the picture and good presentation of good material."
4.0,Xmas gift for child.
4.0,Nice pair for running...i am happy!
4.0,Very beautiful top but I bought it too big.. I had bought so many clothing items on Amazon that fit small so I went up in size for this. I am still going to try to wear it though because the color is very vibrant and the material is very soft. I believe it will look very nice with a pair of leggings.  I received this top at a discounted price for a fair and honest opinion.
4.0,Warmer than I expected for a spring/fall top but not too warm. The random white tag on the pocket makes no sense and is not easily removable. Overall I would still give it a good rating.
4.0,"I'm happy with my purchase , nice cap."
4.0,Didn't check the measurements so it's a little tight but otherwise very stylish
4.0,A good case.  I’d prefer more substantial zippers
4.0,Made style look long
4.0,"The Dress was exactly as pictured, but runs a bit smaller than ordered. I ordered a 16 but the dress was more like a 14. The dress is also very long if you are under 5 feet 5 inches.  I am 5 feet 2 inches and it was still very long. I wil give this dress a 4 star for quality of material. Be prepared for alterations."
4.0,"Love it, very soft. The only draw back is the little fuzzy off the scarf that gets all over my clothes and in my mouth. Lol other than that it very nice."
4.0,Great fit. Super comfortable & good quality.
4.0,Very cute- just like the photos! A little on the small side though.
4.0,Just as the photo.
4.0,I have used turtle fur forever. Never had an issue and it's kept me warm. These are toasty and the kids like them however as others have stated they are fuzzy and the boys have complained about bit about fuzz getting in their nose and mouth from these.
4.0,"Love the my purse. Very roomy. Just what I need. Minus a star because the main zipper is difficult. I sprayed it with wd 40.still not easy to zip, but a little better. I really do not need to zip my purse all the time. Purse is very deep. I do not have to worry about things falling out."
4.0,I personally don't like how this looks on me. It has nothing to do with the hat. My face is just too fat to look good on me.
4.0,"I really like the style of this dress and the fabric feels great, but for me the dress is too short.  It hit above the knee and for me that doesn’t work."
4.0,"Bought one then ordered more. Gave them out to my hunting buddies, they loved them"
4.0,Good product. As dvertised
4.0,"I bought these Gdefy boots because my experience with their shoes was so positive. I have a fused ankle (20+ years) and finding shoes is a struggle. I'm actually supposed to get special orthopedic shoes made, but they're super expensive and I always end up hating them. I gave the MATeeM a shot and they were honestly life changing – a production athletic shoe with rocker bottoms, support, and comfort.<br /><br />The boots are little bit different story. They are tremendously more helpful than boots without a rocker bottom, but they're not nearly as comfortable at the MATeeM shoes. I believe this is because the boots want to retain some rigidity and extended durability. These boots have the VersoShock bottom, but not the cushion comfort of the VersoCloud. If you're familiar with Gdefy, that's a major lacking of their technology.<br /><br />With that said, I would recommend these boots to people with foot / ankle troubles. They do offer relief above a typical boot. Once you get them, they do take some time to break in. They also remind me more of a snow boot, decently insulated and water resistant (proof?) so they work well in the winter. The traction is also good – I've used them on rocks, mud, snow, and ice and haven't slipped yet!<br /><br />Gdefy, if you're reading, with my ankle troubles I'll be a customer for life. I'd love a summer / work boot. Something like your Madik but with VersoShock and VersoCloud soles. A durable, classic work boot with leather exterior, lightly padded interior, and the amazing technology / soles that you put into your athletic shoes. I wouldn't even mind sacrificing some longevity, meaning I'd have to buy more often, if it meant a rocker bottom and comfort comparable to the MATeeM.  Meeting work boot safety standards would be nice, but not a ""must"" if you can't achieve comparable comfort – I'd still wear them around the ranch / workshop / doing projects."
4.0,Quality goods
4.0,Love the color. A bit low on hips for middle aged. Feel like I'm always having to pull it up in the back. Maybe because I have no butt. Size selected is smaller than anticipated.
4.0,Top is cute and comfortably fits.  It's true to size.  This top can be worn alone or with a cute jacket.  It cam be dressed up or dressed down.
4.0,"Ordered this necklace as a gift. It is so beautiful. Necklace could be longer, but other than that, it is so pretty."
4.0,It s a very decent sport bra. Very true to size.
4.0,My husband likes them says they are comfortable.
4.0,"I can see the tv while lying down, read a book with no problem. It doesn't look so far away to me as others have posted. The construction of the glasses seem pretty sturdy too, kinda heavy on the nose (after awhile) so add some foam for comfort."
4.0,"Comfortable, the price is right, and generally flattering"
4.0,Great fit and very comfortable 👍👍😊
4.0,Additional comfort supply is-a-must.
4.0,I bough it for my 20 year old son. It looks very nice and most of part of it is useful. I only wish coin zipper could be horizontal instead of vertical for taking coins out of it easily.
4.0,easy to adjust to my wrist. The brown one lost a little color but it looks good
4.0,I liked this its just a little too big.
4.0,not great quality but super cute
4.0,"i tend now get costume wigs because purchase of exspinsive wigs may be worth it but these wigs are not bad looking,though i found this wig in the costume wig section they are attractive the bangs on this wig is nice and tend to like long wigs the flow of this wig is soft and sheer silky in a milky way nice texture great for takeing pictures or out on vacations i tend to tke wigs on a trip in case i can use a curler but this is a star wig as so many you can find a duplicate of stars with known hair styles this i would wear in a photo shoot party wigs are great or even for special occasions"
4.0,These are super cute! Fit my daughter a little big where her foot is but not to big for it to be super noticeable. But after first wash some of the bows came off sadly but I used a glue gun and glued them back on.
4.0,Loveed
4.0,"I thought it was a nice bag since it zips closed, and it is water resistant.  Unfortunately it was smaller than I thought so had to return it."
4.0,"good material.  Some uncortable in the neck.<br />I got the green one, realy like the color."
4.0,LOVE IT. i just wish it was not so sensitive. Like you can't over stuff them or else the break lol.
4.0,no clear plastic cover over name plate.  have put it on all my bags.  durability will be an issue if they ever get wet as the inserts are just paper that you can either type or write on.
4.0,"I use this for days when I absolutely have to wake up on time and I find that it works well.  Its worth the price paid for it as it has never failed me even on mornings when I haven't slep for the past 3 days, lie down to get 2 hours of sleep and need to be up on time to get my day going."
4.0,"This was perfect fit and is exactly what I expected, but my white top came stained with black marking that won’t come out so that was very disappointing. Even after washing it, it did not remove the stain that it came with."
4.0,"For cheap heels, these bad boys are holding up well. Buy a half size up."
4.0,"Very nice material, just runs big so I suggest going down a size"
4.0,Good quality. Material is stretchy so it's form fitted.  I'm 5'3 125lbs I got a SMALL and it fits well.
4.0,"Pros: true to size, cute buttons.<br />Cons: very thin,  see-through fabric, color is way lighter than on picture, definitely not cotton."
4.0,"Although a bit big when wet, it is a ice suit and I use it daily for water volleyball. It is perfect for this activity."
4.0,good  product
4.0,"I used it to carry when I went on a cruise, very cute!"
4.0,"Jacket is poorly made, looks nothing like advertised. Very sorry I bought it."
4.0,"Looks great on my honey. Easily dressed up or down. Only downside is adjusting the size, can be done but takes a few minutes to figure it out."
4.0,"My daughter loves these socks so much that she decided to wear them with shoes.  She complained of sore feet when we got home.  I do not think they are meant to be work with shoes, but I wanted to let you know just in case you wanted to try it.  Otherwise, she really likes the socks.  She is about 5 feet and they come up onto her thighs."
4.0,Great item just was too small. Returning for larger size
4.0,"I ordered the size 8-10 for an almost 8 year old, but it is very loose. She is very skinny but the material is too loose for her to ever grow into. Plus the size is fine lengthwise on her torso but long on her legs. All in all it's an odd fit."
4.0,Love the costume but tooo small 😩
4.0,"Looked great on my gf, material is just fine (not like she's gonna wear it all day long!)"
4.0,"Cute, runs a little big."
4.0,"This may just be the flimsiest umbrella I have ever owned but it does block the sun. It is the size of a normal size umbrella, like a small Totes but considerably cooler under it. Since it blocks the rays I gave it four stars."
4.0,"Band of good quality and comfortable.  Provided 4 pins to attach band to watch all 4 same size.  Only two are needed. However, the pins provided  were not long enough for my watch, although the band fit perfectly.  I suggest in future vendor should supply 2 pins that are longer than the other two included in the package to fit a larger array of watches."
4.0,Received 2 left feet inserts.<br />No right foot.<br />I have a right foot and need an insert.
4.0,I do like these shirts but I would’ve thought they came as cotton or something else. But the material used for them is useful and it helps me to cool down faster
4.0,Fits well EXCEPT a little loose in the arms so my bra straps show and it looks a little sloppy and stretched out.
4.0,"Not as red as it appears in the photo, more of a brick red, but it's fine."
4.0,Love the look and how easy to adjust.
4.0,"Nice looking bag. Good size, not to small, yet not a large bag. Love how there is an insert. The leather is soft too, yet it holds its shape because of the flat bottom. The body strap is perfect!<br />Two small cons are: I wish it was a ""tad"" bigger, like an inch all the way around. (my preference on what i was looking for in a black bag) & the brown straps are a bit ""orangy"".<br />Over all this bag is great, especially for the price."
4.0,The fit is good. The waistband doesn't roll over - a real blessing! The panties are well-made but also very heavy. These will be great in the winter; maybe too warm in the summer.
4.0,Love the shoe  wish I could get more my problem have just one foot and it is swelled but shoe is great
4.0,Purchased the 3 mm 18g set.  Came promptly in a cute little velvet drawstring bag.  Colors match screen pretty well and after a few weeks of constant wear (blue and rose gold) haven't noticed any color change. I wear a pair I  my second ear piercing and one in my nose. So far my only issue is that my fingers are a bit clumsy with the small screw on heads but this is a small price to pay and I haven't had any problems stripping them.
4.0,"I've received so many compliments when I wear this dress! The only thing that drove me a little nuts about it, is the lining at the sleeves comes out past the sparkly material :/ I'm probably the only person that notices!  I ordered a M, I'm 5'0"", 138lbs, it stretches where needed, material is a little thin (recommend nipple covers or a strapless bra) . You lose some sparkles when wearing it, but it's not noticeable on the dress, I've worn it 3 times already."
4.0,I really liked this shirt but it was a little tight in the sleeves. I returned Because it was a little too uncomfortable for me. Overall a very cute shirt though!
4.0,I really needed a good strapless bra that would stay in place. I am very pleased with this one and would recommend it!
4.0,It’s a cute shirt but the graphic is VERY thick. It bulges out from the shirt. That makes it feel funny when you wear it and it makes it sit weird on my stomach area.
4.0,Not flimsy and cheaply made.  Fits face fine but not very flexible.
4.0,My granddaughter loves this. She says it's a bit heavy but it fits her head well.
4.0,Not too tight; roomy around the toes; but I had to pull them back up to knee level a few times. My feet are a size 9.5-10. Not the best compression socks but they do a decent job.
4.0,"My wife liked it, good qu5"
4.0,"This was just what I was looking for - not too big, yet fits everything I usually need to carry.<br /><br />Complaints: the velcro lost its stick on the outside cell phone pocket after 2 months, so now I have to put my phone inside the purse or it will keep falling out. Also the section for bills and the zippered section for coins do not have a lot of room in them, so it is very tight to fit much in there."
4.0,A bit big for a medium
4.0,Really nice shirt!!  It seems to have shrunk in length as it's been washed
4.0,"I liked the way it had sheer spots. It made it pretty unique. This is a cute dress. I liked it. I thought it was flattering. I thought the fit was pretty good. I thought that it was unique and looked good.<br /><br />It was a little thin, which is why I took off a star but it was fine. I got the black so you couldn't see through it. It was also really comfortable.<br /><br />The dress was relatively comfortable. The fit was okay. It wasn't too hot, which for me is important since we live in Florida.<br /><br />It wasn't too hard to clean. I thought it seemed trendy. It felt durable and the fabric was relatively soft. It would work in a wide variety of settings.<br /><br />It was as described and I would recommend it."
4.0,This shirt is so cute but about a size too small.
4.0,The lens are great for the price just scratch very easy. I will order more.
4.0,"If you are looking for a key case to hold a few keys and even attach your car fob to it, this might do it for you. Thus far I am very happy with the quality of it. and I do recommend it.."
4.0,"This is a lovely, lovely dress.  Super soft and very forgiving drape.  The neck line plunges just a little to deep for the office, however a safety pin does the trick.  I love wearing this dress at the office, around the house or out for dinner.  Very flattering."
4.0,"Very soft scarf; however, feels delicate and edges are rough. Probably can't machine wash but no big deal. Exactly as pictured and feels like thin fleece. Good fall fashion scarf."
4.0,Style is perfect.  The only I wish was is that is could of been a little more stretchy
4.0,This shows one smaller. I had to get them two sizes larger than my regular shoes. They are comfortable and they work well indoors or outdoors.  I will order them again.
4.0,Love the skirt however I am going to send it back. I am very warm natured and the skirt is hot. If it was a lighter material I would keep it.
4.0,The printed. Elephants were higher on the hat than shown in photo. More a style than solidly functional. Comfy and cool.
4.0,"I absolutely love this bag it was super cute and sturdy, and I get nothing but compliments when I wear it. I'm honestly going to purchase it in another color because it's that good.<br /><br />the reason for the four stars is because the bag Smelled sooo bad when it first arrived, it smelled like old fish... and for the life of me I couldn't get the smell to go away it took me three days of having the bag air out before I could use it.<br /><br />other than that I love it."
4.0,"Great boots, easy on and off but it is a tad big. My son likes it but it needs a thicker insole to make it more snug."
4.0,"First note, another reviewer mentioned the hood being small, it is, it's designed to fit tightly to the head, allows for a hood to move with the person's head as they turn and move.  And you can cinch it down to do so.  This won't keep blowing rain/snow off your face, so know that, some form of had may be your cure there.<br /><br />The neck fit really tight on mine, but this thing really covers everything in the neck and head well to seal any weather out, blowing rain may get on your face, but this long neck that sucks down to you, the cape, and the outside pocket covers really will keep weather out of the jacket.<br /><br />I have the waxed canvas version of this as well, bought XL instead of L.  This waxed canvas version uses the snaps for pockets and the cuffs, I like this better then the velcro used on this jacket.<br /><br />I also like the split back bottom on the waxed canvas over this coat, I knew this didn't have that, so no deduction on points.<br /><br />The one star off is for the velcro, kind of a cheap way to do it, doesn't seem to be in keeping with the design, flimsy.<br /><br />Overall, I'd love to see the split back on this, replace the velcro with the snaps, and even though I understand why you'd make a hood that fit like this, I'd like it to be about 3x bigger, then it would be perfect to me.<br />I got it in all black and it is a slick looking coat, no extraneous details that detract from the presentation, like noted in the title, it's clean enough looking that I wouldn't have issue using this as a suit coat.<br /><br />This is a good buy"
4.0,The material is of medium weight and fits pretty well. The neck is not too low which i like. Fabric has a nice texture as well. Like it a lot.
4.0,"Perfect fit. I will stick with Columbia pants, now that I see how well they fit."
4.0,"As advertised, light, stretchy and quick-drying. Just enough Velcro on the cargo pockets to keep things secure as I hike. Has a right rear pocket as well. I’d like to see a little more hefty belt loops, but the ones on it have held-up fine. Lots of stretch at the waistline. I’ve got one pair going on a year’s use in the summer and they are fine."
4.0,This dress was a hit...its very light and delicate
4.0,Amazing product that is elegant and adds beauty to your Gear S2. The color wears off after a while of use especially on the edges as you will notice a white color showing. Hence the 4 stars rating and not 5.
4.0,"La tela es fina, delicada y aunque es XL me quedó ajustada"
4.0,Arrived smelling like petroleum. Not a lush fur as pictured. Gap of about a half inch between fur pieces threaded through the thick black cheap yarn. Lower section unraveling out of the package. Fur is a brown not a gray as purchased. What a let down. I gave a 4 star rating because seller agreed to maje it right and promised better audit of product before shipping.
4.0,"The socks are really cute, but people need to know they run small."
4.0,The dark blue is like an athletic type material while the light blue is a striped knit . The thread is light orange
4.0,"Beautiful, but better fitting for 13 and under. Just small on size"
4.0,"Love the pants, very comfortable. Would be 5 stars but they came with a hole in the pocket."
4.0,I actually purchased two of these in different colors. I am 5”8 and pear shaped plus size gal. This top does not cling is rather full around. The fabric is soft and stretchy. I have washed both and both shrank slightly in cold water gentle cycle and low heat dry finish dry on line. The slight shrinkage was a bonus for me because they do hang long in the body they could be used with leggings. They seem to run a bit larger than typical for my size I typically buy 1x or 16-18 this fit more like a 2x. It seems like this fabric will stretch out of shape if not laundered cautiously. I do like these they are both pretty.
4.0,I was pretty stoked to see vented lenses for Half Jackets.  I'm not sure if Oakley makes them internally.  These fit fine and look good.  There is noticeably less fogging of my lenses with the vents than in regular lenses.  The only reason they don't get five stars is that they seem a bit brighter than I'd like.  I'm starting to wonder if some of the lenses I've gotten recently (from both Oakley and aftermarkets) are accurate in their light transmission.
4.0,"I ordered a size up for my daughter, they fit her perfectly. I'm glad they fit, however, I'm disappointed that they won't last as long as I had hoped. I love the shoe, super cute, looks clean and shiny. I just wished they had been bigger for her to grow into."
4.0,Fit well. They are super soft. Probably not my last pair!
4.0,The price and build are 5 stars.  I am very active so I expected this thing to have some color fade but it is nearly non-existent.  The only thing that takes away a star is how the buttons feel a little loose.  They have never fallen out and this is very minor but that is it.  Mine came out of the box the perfect size so I didn't need to re-size it.  Popping it out of the bezel is easy with a little practice but it gets easy really fast.  Very happy.
4.0,"Useful, Helps support the lower portion of my legs.  The material is not very soft and is hurtful to my legs.  Otherwise, they are kind of a fun support stocking to wear."
4.0,She LOVES these but boy are they tricky to put on. She really has to tweek her nips to pull them through enough to set the screws. Once on though she loves them. Great for wearing out and around because they give her constant stimulation.
4.0,"See through, you need a slip to wear it.  Great for lounge wear though."
4.0,"Ratchet works better than anticipated.  Will slip when you pull it too tight, but works great otherwise."
4.0,This swimsuit is a great value.  It can quickly and is made of good material.  The top is a bit big on me and there is now way to change that.  I'm a smaller B cup and am definitely going to put in some bigger padding then what it came with.  The bottoms are adjustable and fit fine.
4.0,Purchased for a Mickey Mouse costume...ok just a little big
4.0,"Great design, sturdy case. The springs eventually gave out, but it gave me a good excuse to buy a case with a new design to switch things up a little."
4.0,Fits seems a little cheap in construction.  Time will tell
4.0,"Super cute and is a nice stretchy,  soft material.  My son is pretty big so it was slightly small for him.  I was bummed that it was only available in, I think, 24 month in size.  He is a 3T but I took a risk for the price.  So it's true to size,  I just wished it came in larger sizes"
4.0,I bought this for my cousin for Christmas ans the color and shape of it was well desired. The black cord color helped the Jade stick out which I liked. It was slightly larger than expected but it was a good purchase nevertheless.
4.0,They were much bigger than I was expecting but still very pretty.
4.0,"The material is thin. I received a light blue cover up when It should have been teal. If what I received is classified as teal, it is not true to its color."
4.0,Just as I expected it. Would buy more in different colors.
4.0,"I am very pleased with this purchase.  It's not a super sophisticated dress, but it could be dressed up or down and the lace is of surprising quality, and quite soft.  I also love the elbow length sleeves, and the empire waist is very flattering. I plan to wear this casually, with leggings, at work.  For the money, I have zero complaints!"
4.0,I would definitely recommend this product for support and compression. But see your Doctor first.
4.0,This is a great buy!!
4.0,Love this style. On my 3rd pair in 20 years. Great dark lense. The best Black Fly buy!
4.0,"This will fit a note 9 and a small wallet but that's all. It might fit your small keys in that hidden pocket. I love the color while I don't have shoes to match I do have other items this exact color, so happy. For me the hardware is both cute with a black metal, it's Heavy."
4.0,I wore it over a spaghetti strap dress. It kept me warm yet also had a nice airy feel to it.
4.0,While this fits the the sleeve are tight on my upper arms.
4.0,"The material on these is soft, and they have held up well through multiple washings.  However, they shrunk some in the laundry.  It would be advisable to buy a size larger than your usual size.  The pun name is a plus."
4.0,I got through phases of wanting to be stylish but I’m overall lazy. Most rompers or jumpsuits make me feel childish or give some unflattering angles. This is the only one I’ve felt comfortable in out of the box. The lightly sassy back makes me feel a bit more put together than wearing yoga pants and an attached tank. I plan to wear it on an upcoming vacation.<br /><br />I’m 5’2 and hovering between 125 and 130 pounds. Small fit fine without emphasizing my extra weight.
4.0,"The color, shape and fit perfect. Added contour to my bady assests."
4.0,"This were a perfect match for my daughters 50's outfit, but they are for an adult. Not for a 4 year old. Way to big."
4.0,These are soft and comfy but too long. I’m 5’4 and about 120lbs. I ordered the small which fits but the legs are way too long and I have to hike the waist up pretty high (above my belly button) which I don’t prefer. If you’re on the shorter side- pay attention to the length.
4.0,I ordered up one size and it fits well. I get alot of compliments on this shirt
4.0,Its a great tunic/mini dress but the outer flowing layer does not stretch like the inner layer.  I wouldn't recommend this for someone bigger busted.  I'm 5'6&quot; 145lbs 34D and a M was too tight.  I gave it to my friend who weighs 95lbs.  She's 5'2&quot; and it makes an adorable dress.  Looks great on her but too small for me.  :(
4.0,It was good but it would be better is the note was metal instead of plastic
4.0,"My dimensions are 5' 7"" 130lbs slim athletic build.<br /><br />I was looking for an affordable tank top to wear for indoor rock climbing. I've never considered wearing a tank top before now but I thought I'd try it.<br />These fit pretty loose on me, but not really noticeably. I just hoped the xs would be a little more fitted. If I had a beer belly, I guess I would appreciate the extra material used to make these. As someone else mentioned, it's a basketball jersey type of material, so it's a bit see through, but not bad. It'll be really breathable, and a little stretchy.<br /><br />Overall, I'm not super stoked about the fit, but for the money, I can't complain too much."
4.0,"the earrings are all really cool and will definitely be awesome statement pieces; however,one of the pairs doesn't stay on my ears since the backs they came with are a bit on the flimsy side"
4.0,"Tiny and gorgeous. Wish more people used lever backs for these small earrings, they will easy fall out like this. I put lever backs on them myself. Great quality tho."
4.0,Love the kit that comes with it to remove the links. The price is worth it for the kit alone! Sometimes when you get a band and remove links it's difficult with holding and removing. With the kit I was able to slide the watch down on its side and remove the links. Great little hammer comes with it too. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the weight of the band. It's rather heavy. Not sure how you'd lighten it other than using a lighter steel but that could potentially ruin the durability of the band.
4.0,This hat is the cutest.  It did come with some dents but whatever.
4.0,Loved except sleeves slightly snug
4.0,It runs really small but seriously great product. My cat is attached to my hip 24/7 and needs to be with me all the time or she’ll lose her head she’s a huge mama’s girl so she’s stoked. Like she is in heaven it’s honestly hilarious how happy she is right now. I’ve never seen this cat more content. She’s so stoked man.
4.0,Very nice winter outfit
4.0,"The ring is super cute and the diamonds in the initials adds a sexy but sophisticated look. My only issue is that the ring is very short, so if you have a belly like myself, please be aware of the comfort level when putting it on and wearing it. i just wished it was a little longer to suit the comfort ability."
4.0,"Got this dress for my baby shower and it was a huge hit! It fit just right and looked good and the colors were nice and bright. I hadn’t received so many compliments on a dress in a while so I was very satisfied! :-) And for the record, it’s very comfortable and easy flowing! No need to sit tightly packed into the dress!"
4.0,She loves them and said they are comfortable
4.0,"The belt looks good and adjusts easily. So far, I like it. Only time will tell about how long it looks good, however. I will report back in about a year as to it's longevity"
4.0,"Extremely pretty, Asian fit"
4.0,Great colorful sweater. Love the texture of the fabric.
4.0,I was a little surprise at the side seams of this dress. So pay close attention to the waist side seam as its in a V.  I like the material and its perfect for a simple summer dress. This dress looks better on you than on a rack. I like the dress and would buy it again
4.0,"Wife - Nice dress, great fit. Did not come with bow."
4.0,"They are nice, only thing is that they looked gold in color on the website and they are beige."
4.0,It is a little more pink in person than purple but was really cute and good quality!
4.0,"These are cute! They are veeery cheaply made, but I expected that for the price. I wanted a matching dress/romper set for my girls without spending a ton of money, and this fit the bill. The romper shoulder strap kept falling down and I used the headband to tie the crisscross together in the back and it worked and looked cute. As long as you cut the many strings off and manage to get the button holes open, it’s not obvious to others how thin and cheap they are. The dress is about knee length and I wished it was longer but that wasn’t a big deal."
4.0,"I love the fabric and the style, my one complaint is the bra shape, if you have a wider chest like 38, your boobs are gonna fit weird in the bra. Otherwise i love this underwear set!"
4.0,Loved the little dog but I couldn't get it on my bracelet
4.0,I ordered this dress to wear on a getaway for my 10th wedding anniversary. The trip got cancelled but I wore the dress anyway for date night and it fit like a dream. And got a ton of compliments. I'm 5'9 185lbs w/ wide set ribs & big chest & 2x was perfect. and I'm a red head so some colors look weird on me but  the light green with the red flowers was beautiful. It was comfortable and felt high quality by not so thick I was sweating in the Texas heat. Ordering the khaki color soon for thanksgiving!
4.0,this hat is more for a woman or a small teen. looks good on a female me not so much
4.0,"Works nicely, but expensive for what you get."
4.0,"Giving 4 stars because they do fit right. I bought the 16mm. They feel like good quality for the most part.<br />BUT, one plug did not have a seam cut to unscrew. And one plug seemed to have a flaw in the clear coat but picture still looks fine. They are replacing the plugs free of charge so that's nice!<br />Pictured is NOT the flawed plug."
4.0,works as mentioned
4.0,"After washing it, I wore it for almost 2 days straight for many uses.<br /><br />It was one of the rare winter 50 degree days in New England with the sun shining, and it was perfect for warmth.  The material breathes,  I could feel the sun through it, to warm me and sweat doesn't stay trapped.<br />The material is a medium weight.  It has some stretch but not much.  It's not soft, it's slippery/silk like.<br /><br />It fits as expected.  However with the sleeve band having the thumb hole, I can't push the sleeves up, only fold back the band.<br /><br />The stitching on the front creates a nice slim looking feminine line when wearing.  Love the pockets, nice and flat on the sides.<br /><br />The zipper I'm a bit concerned about it's durability.  Seems like a larger or higher end zipper would be better.<br /><br />Overall a great jack for looks, warmth, functional (zippered pockets), and exercise."
4.0,I ordered the larger of the two options s and its not really that roomy. The color is nice.
4.0,Love my boots! A little tight around the ankles and really tight when I put them on with heavier socks... must say though I wear them more than my coconuts or Steve Madden boots now!
4.0,Perfect product just not sized correctly.
4.0,These are really cute. Came in a sealed plastic bag & when open smelled like smoke 😳 So had to wash them before use. After been washed they seem nice. Will see how warm they are one the snow comes.
4.0,The only disappointment was that they were very thin in gauge.  I had hoped they would be thicker.to be a little warmer.
4.0,"Soft and comfortable, but a little too big. Sleeves are too long as well and the armbands are too big to keep them above your palms. So my hands disappear into the sleeves.<br />Not something you would want to wear with black pants as the fleece sheds and sticks to everything. Maybe after a few washings, it will be just fine."
4.0,Ideal costume dress for cosplay/Halloween. Only thing is it includes the top layer dress and not the white underdress portion. Bought this thinking it was the entire dress but it was not. Be sure to get an additional dress for underneath.
4.0,"Cute, but Is too big"
4.0,Received this as a gift from a good friend.  I just love it's simplicity!  Its a lovely little necklace - I just wish you could order in an 18 inch.  Thank you!  :)
4.0,"I have seen this type of underwear around for years and wouldn’t bother taking the chance. I thought I’d finally try them and actually give a review on them. I’m glad I did.<br />  They are pretty comfortable. They’re 70% cotton, so enough to breathe and feel like cotton but, they are 30% polyester, so they won’t shrink too much. I do think a little more form for support would be better, compared to my normal wear but, these are also Completely new to me, as I said so, I do like them and have the feeling I will actually start to use this style in the future.<br />  My only other concern is longevity. I only say this because, they seem so thin. I’m sure this is a part of why they’re So comfortable and for that, I’m happy. I simply want longevity. I won’t know that, without Time. Until then, I will definitely enjoy wearing them. They’ve worth a try, I’d say."
4.0,Love the hat and it’s exactly like the pic. It just itches a little around the brim.
4.0,Was a little bulkier then I wanted but very comfortable and warm! Bought to wear in Italy while traveling and doing tours outside in chilly weather. Served its purpose well.
4.0,"I'm normally a size 18 dress (43"" bust), an XL fit perfectly. It's a pullover dress, no zipper. The only issue I had was that the fabric was a little thin for a normal Grace Karin dress and the top flap on the bust-line refuses to stay up. I think I will have to add a piece of wire or a thick piece of felt to keep it upright. Also, unlike the flap that goes down the skirt, the top portion of the decoration is not double stitched so it hangs oddly. The dress itself is nice though and I've been looking for a strapless dress in my size, just wish the quality was a bit higher."
4.0,"The size of the wallet was a bit misleading but overall it seems sturdy & has many pockets for your credit and debit cards, the millions of rewards cards you seem to need these days, and insurance cards. Overall I give a 4/5 stars"
4.0,"I love the material because it gives a lot. The only problem i have is that althought it does not fit tight on me, the button area peeps the shirt underneath making it look like it is a tight fit. This is because the buttons seem to be sewn too close to the edge. Other than that, the sweater's feel is really nice. I bought the crew neck black in 3X and i normally wear a 2X."
4.0,Vivid colors.  I really like it.
4.0,"Nutshell: Cozy but improvable<br />Pros: These are cozy and adjustable in the waist.<br />Cons: The side, thigh pocket is just for show. There's only a flap- no actual pocket. The opposite pockets are shallow. If you are buying them for the pockets you may be disappointed."
4.0,Like the looks and configuration of the watch. Also the brown leather strap. On top of that it's water resistant.<br />Thank you.
4.0,"I have a Titin weighted compression shirt in addition to these shorts. I bought these products because I had been hitting the wall in terms of my PB circuit times for the trails/mountains I run, and I was looking for a way to gain more speed. My plan was to train with the added weight and try to drop to my old PB WITH the weight, then run without the weight on race days. The results of this have been nothing short of spectacular, and both Titin products work great, but in terms of bang for the buck, I think the shorts do more for me based on my primary application despite being lighter than the weighted shirt. A slightly more detailed analysis of that follows.<br /><br />While you can add more weight with the shirt than you can with the shorts, the weight placement on the shorts is more targeted and makes activities that involve running or climbing stairs quite a bit more difficult than just adding more weight to carry. You're carrying about 1.7lbs (3 gels) around your mid thigh per leg in addition to the gel that is carried higher and closer to your hip, so every time you lift your leg to step, you're lifting that extra weight before pushing off. 1.7lbs may not sound like much, but after a few hundred stairs, you absolutely feel it. In a few hundred more stairs, you start thinking fantasizing about taking the shorts off and burying them. I mean that in the best way possible. But when I run races without the weight, I feel like I'm running on the moon. It's amazing how much lighter and more explosive you feel when you do the same activities without the weight that you'd been doing to train with the weight.<br /><br />If you already have the Titin compression shirt, I still highly recommend the shorts. Depending on your application, you may benefit from the lower center of gravity that the shorts provide. The shirt alone can make you a little top heavy, although that may be exactly what you're looking for to enhance your workout. In any case, I can't think of a workout that would NOT be enhanced by these items.<br /><br />Both the shirt and the shorts fit well and keep the gel weights pretty firmly in place. I trail/stair run in both of these products, and the weights do not bounce or take on a life of their own. That was a real concern of mine before spending the serious dollars that these products cost, but Titin seems to have solved that problem. While the shirt system has an extra compression shirt that helps keep the weights secure, I just wear normal workout shorts over the Titin shorts, and it feels just fine. The shorts have a belt mechanism up top to keep them from falling down, and it actually worked surprisingly well. I'm normally a men's medium for things like shorts and underwear, and the medium-sized shorts fit me perfectly.<br /><br />So why not 5 stars?<br /><br />Just a few reasons:<br /><br />1.  Inserting and removing the gel weights is quite a hassle. That's in part just the price you pay for the weights being held so securely in place. Still, in Titin's 2.0 version, I'd like to see weight pockets that were just a little easier to manage, possibly with wider openings and some kind of fastener or flap to close when the weights are in. The weights are a much bigger pain to insert into the shirt, however.<br /><br />2. The weights themselves are also not particularly washable, and trust me, they are going to get quite sweaty. The gels are coated in some kind of lycra-like fabric, and I've yet to find a really effective way to clean them. They don't smell bio-hazard awful yet, but I feel like they may someday.<br /><br />3. Cost. These shorts are expensive, and there's not much about them that seems to justify the cost. They are shorts with pockets and a basic belt, and weights are just some kind of gel that probably cost $0.50 to make. They are not spun from spider silk or designed by Jony Ive. The quality is fine, but still, the price point is perhaps a bit high for most people. Similar things might be said about other &#34;simple&#34; fitness products however. I'm looking at you, TRX. In any case, the shorts are significantly cheaper than the shirt, so if you are only going to buy one or just want to try it first, maybe the shorts are the best way to wade in."
4.0,"Be careful of the size, but the comfort is there."
4.0,Good looking pair of glasses for it price. I will purchase more from this company. Note that that if you need large then you need to select M size do to the lens is oversized.
4.0,"I ordered these to help organize my family for a road trip.  With 4 kids and limited space, my hope is to have a space for different things without needing to dig through all the luggage every time.  The sizes are great, but my only concern is that they have no support on the sides.  Perhaps as they are filled up, it will all work out well.  I haven't been able to put them into full production yet though."
4.0,"bueno el pedido llego ante de fecha estoy muy conforme con el servicio, el producto llena las espesativa del cliente"
4.0,"I hits in a strange place on my big neck, although I like the look.  I had to stretch it quite a bit."
4.0,"I have various watches and was on the fence about this one.  I have some full size G-shocks and thought this might be too much.  In fact, I almost sold it off.  However, it has become one of my favorites.  I wear it sporty, but have used it for business as well.  Honestly, I'd wear this with a tux.  I know!  That's sounds a bit much, but I think you can easily pull it off.  Mine is the black/silver, so it has a classy look and it looks like a very expensive diver.  My only wish would be a date on the face.  I feel that when wearing a watch, the phone is just a phone.  If I need to look at my phone for the date, then the watch came up short.  Not a huge deal though."
4.0,"I own the matching tri shorts and love them. Recieved this top and it's a little to small for my liking. I am 5'5, 120lbs and ordered a small. I will have to exchange it for a medium. The front is shorter than I would like. but the length of the back is great. The material is nice and comfortable. Hopefully the size medium works better for me. There is no bra attached in the top, so need to wear a sports bra under it. Hope to wear this for my upcoming short distance triathlon.<br /><br />Thank you for finally making a tri top to match your tri shorts."
4.0,"I ordered the size per the description, should have ordered a size smaller.  Also the bones in the garment that go under the armpit, hurt, they should be a little shorter, so not to hit the armpit."
4.0,This can work for winter or spring. The dress looks better on.
4.0,Not as white as I would like  but couldn't find any white ones
4.0,Super cute looks just like the picture and fits good. Warm too.
4.0,"Well made boot, sized right, look good.<br /><br />Could use a little more padding"
4.0,Comfortable and calming
4.0,"the lenses aren't really all that dark, but that's quite all right since they are more of a statement rather than eye care.<br />they are listed as mirrored, but in no way are a mirrored lens. I was slightly disappointed in this but will for sure be keeping them."
4.0,Everything Ok.
4.0,"Looks great, lightweight , fits 15 inch laptop secure.  A pleasure to commute with. Only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars is the bottom corners aren't strong so you have to push them out internally when packing work supplies"
4.0,"I am typically an XL, the L fits me a little snugly. Love it except there are slits up the sides that, for a long torso'd person like me, hit too high. The quality is great, it's a little see through, so a shirt will be required underneath."
4.0,My boy loves it.  It does shrink after a few washes.
4.0,"I am 5’6” and about 135 pounds. I typically wear a US size 6-8, but often wear a size Large for tops because I am long-waisted. I ordered this dress in a size Large, but because it is so true to size, I could’ve gone with a Medium. I will absolutely wear it as is, and the looser fit will actually be more comfortable during our hot summers.<br /><br />This dress is 95% cotton, so it will wrinkle. The 5% Spandex is almost undetectable, but it does have a *little* bit of stretch/give in the fabric. The zipper works well, and the zipper pull lies flat when it’s at the top. I do have to be somewhat flexible to get it zipped/unzipped by myself, but it’s doable. The shape of the dress nicely disguises my mommy tummy. The dress is modest and has a retro look that makes it fun at the same time.<br /><br />The seams are straight and the hem is properly surged. There are some extra threads that I snipped off, but nothing has come unraveled. The dress is exactly as pictured in the product listing, and I’m very pleased with it.<br /><br />I received this dress for free in exchange for my impartial review. I did not receive any other compensation, and I am not obligated to write a favorable review. I have used this product myself, and all words in this review are my own."
4.0,"This dress is very cute. It would make for a cute dress to wear to church. The dress is made of 100% polyester and the lining is made of 100% cotton.  Because the dress Is made of polyester you don't have to worry about it shrinking once you put it in the dryer.  All seams and buttons on the dress seem to be intact and it has no fraying.<br /><br />The only problem that I have with this dress is that the material on the dress is kind of thin so you can see through the dress, so I would definitely recommend wearing something under this dress.<br /><br />I received this product for little or no cost in exchange for my honest unbiased review for product testing purposes.  Please hit the &quot;like&quot; button at the bottom if you thought this review helped you decide on your research and purchase! Thanks!"
4.0,I love the fact that I can adjust the strap.  It’s bling and cute.
4.0,My son got this as a Christmas gift and he adored it.
4.0,"At size 14, I consider myself a large but that size is too roomy.  😣"
4.0,runs large size down nice shirt other than size sent back
4.0,"Great fit and padding.  The fingertips don't work with my phone or smartwatch, but the knuckles do, so not a complete loss there."
4.0,I have a small head and it fit nicely!
4.0,"This is just a little add-on gift for my granddaughter’s main Christmas present, so I didn’t spend much on this Arwen Evenstar necklace. The quality was fine for the price, and it is pretty. My only hesitation is that it is BIG!  I guess I pictured something a little more dainty.  Not sure if she is going to like it for that reason."
4.0,"For was ok, works well as a layering piece"
4.0,"great hat, i get a lot of compliments"
4.0,It fitted well.
4.0,Slightly small and not the best material but good for the overall price.
4.0,I love this necklace. It's a little cheap in quality but the necklace is beautiful
4.0,"Nice dress, especially for the price. Cute style. Good color. The fabric is not super great but also not as cheap and thin as other products I've bought (and then returned). This ran just a tad small for me but, again, not as small as some products can be. No deal-breakers here. I'll be keeping this."
4.0,"This is very cute. It’s pretty small, and I wish the strap was a little longer. I also wish it had pockets on the inside because I’m constantly digging for smaller items."
4.0,I would most definitely recommend getting these!
4.0,I got these watches for my daughters and daughter in laws.  They seemed to be please with them.  I think they are cute or else I wouldn't of bought them.
4.0,"This headband is fantastic! It does exactly what I expected. Some people have been knocking stars off their review because it doesn’t work well as an ear warmer. “It breaths too much”. While I must agree that it breaths quite well, so therefore it does not work excellently as an ear warmer, in frigid temps but it still works well on a chilly spring night, just not the dead of the winter. This is why I only give it 4 stars. As the description clearly states that it is an ear warmer.<br /><br />It is made of a very breathable, light fleece material, that has an opening to pull your ponytail through. This serves two great purposes. It’s because when I workout I want to be able to have my hair up and and not have to either put it up so high, or so low, to accommodate a headband. This satisfies that need being able to just pull my ponytail through and have it right where I want it. It also works great to stabilize the headband, reducing slipping and falling back on my head during my workout! I get so frustrated with typical headbands as they slip and ride back constantly.<br /><br />This ponytail headband works great to keep your hair out of your eyes while working out and washes beautifully. I have not attempted putting it in the dryer, I have just let it air dry. I really enjoy it!<br /><br />*Just like you I depend on reviews before purchasing any given item. Please let me know if my review was helpful by clicking yes below. I was given the opportunity to test this product at a discount in exchange for reviewing my findings. My review is no way altered by the price I paid for the item being tested. My opinions are based on how I believe the product stands up to its description and company claims, and works the way it is intended."
4.0,"The quality of the ring itself it's pretty good and the inscriptions on it are clearly legible.<br />Sadly the leather strap is not that good, it's a bit thin but I think it will hold up a few months"
4.0,Gauzy but soft and very pretty.
4.0,"Exceeded the expectations I had based on reading others reviews. Well made considering the price and it arrived FAST. I chose this over some similar ones because the shield affixes to the hat with a zipper rather than Velcro, which seems to be more common. I had concerns about the Velcro catching on things and being difficult to align well. I do think that was a good call - the zipper is easy enough to use and the visor is on straight and securely. The only issue I have with it is due to having a small head - it comes down too far to see well. I’ll have to modify it, probably by making a pleat or two in the sides of the hat so it doesn’t come down as far on my head and face."
4.0,it will ride up
4.0,The product is great and good quality the only reason i never give 5starbis because its kinda tight for my son its choking his chunky legs but over all its okay...
4.0,Very cute<br />Comfortable<br />Not very supportive. I wore a bra underneath
4.0,This was a good summer parting gift for a children's classroom.  The kids seemed pleased with them and enjoyed that they came in a variety of cool colors.
4.0,Bought it for an outfit that went perfectly with it! Very light on the earlobes.  Like them allot!!
4.0,Great shirt and got lots of compliments
4.0,"This swimsuit is so cute. It doe not, however, work with my body type. I thought it would look cute and be a bit more modest then a typical bikini, but it looks bad. The cut out only accentuates my love handles, which aren't too bad but with the swim suit pushing it out it looks bad.<br /><br />The suit itself is well made and is exactly as pictured. I wish I had fit my body how I had imagined but alas it is more for someone without curves or really any side fat.<br /><br />I graciously received this swimsuit in exchange for my honest and unbiased review which k have provided."
4.0,nice......
4.0,"Nice look and feel; however, it's a bit flimsy and doesn't hold a firm shape very well."
4.0,Great value. Has held up great in water and fits nicely.  It is designed well and performs nicely.
4.0,I liked the quality of the skirt and the packaging of it was much nicer than expected. The belt seemed sturdy too. I ordered an extra large based on other reviews (I'm normally a size 8) and it definitely runs on the smaller side as the XL fit me pretty well.
4.0,"The shirt is very cute, but the material wrinkles very easily."
4.0,"I LOVE the fit and feel of these, but am rating 4 stars because one arrived with a hole in the seam. But I will be ordering more in another color...perfect loose but flattering fit and plenty long to cover booty in workout leggings."
4.0,Great laces!
4.0,Loved it got the whole set for my 6 year old
4.0,To be clear it’s not a shirt from ROMWE but it’s a perfectly fine shirt. It’s comfy and for me I got an xs which is a normal size for me for ROMWE and it was a bit too tight.
4.0,The box came a little beat up.  Wish this was in a nice gift bag or box with a good presentation for gift giving.  But all in all a nice piece.
4.0,Great value except for the shipping. Took about 3weeks and shipping was as much as the watch.
4.0,Loving the feel n fit
4.0,My grandsons love their key chains
4.0,These slippers were a gift for my son.  He likes them and said they are very comfortable.
4.0,"Very beautiful... As pictured, but even better in person. Bought it for my 9 year old daughter."
4.0,"It fit perfect, I am 240 and it gave me the extra room I needed to feel pretty even after my weight gain. Would've rather had this in black to hide my belly more"
4.0,Great fit. Saving it for a special occasion.
4.0,"What I really like most about this bag is that it folds into itself of easy storage on our coat rack.  The size is just right for a quick day trip.  The stitching appears to be sturdy, and I think we'll be able enjoy this duffel pack for many years."
4.0,Fit my 15 year old son well.  He really likes the material.
4.0,On the large side. Knotted the straps to make the armholes smaller.
4.0,"Note: wash these prior to wearing. I did not and they stained my legs blue and it took some effort to wash off.<br /><br />I am a 34 inch waist and usually buy XL bibs made in Italy. Got the Asian XXL US XL and they were a little roomy which isn’t what I expect with cycling shorts. Also they are considerably warmer than other bibs I own due to thickness of the material.<br /><br />Overall they are comfortable, very padded (probably more than I would have liked inspecting them out of the box but I didn’t notice it being a problem while riding) and above all an incredible value."
4.0,This pillow is great for travel. It is compact and slips into my suitcase well. It is a bit heavy but that is because of the material it is made of. It greatly helps my back and knees. I have artificial knees and multiple back surgeries so hotel pillows don't cut it.
4.0,"Great lighter weight sweatshirt. It runs just a tad small. But I may just say that since I like my sweatshirts a tab big, I took this in consideration when ordering after seeing reviews of their other sweatshirts . The XL for me great, I usually wear a large.  The large probably would have fit good also. The USMC & EGA are screen printed and look to be good quality.  I will update after a few wears & washes!"
4.0,"Ordered this pair for my 9 yr old daughter.  When received they were in plastic bag and no instructions and looked pretty much as shown.  We plugged them in for charging 3- 4 hours. After checking again about an hour later, the other shoe was still blinking (charging).  I decided to have daughter try them out anyway.  Once we figured out how to work the small activating button on side of shoe, she went through all of the color combinations to pick a favorite My immediate thought was to return these shoes.  But because of holiday, daughter wanted to try the shoes on again.  Again we charged both shoes, this time both shoes went to straight color after charged.  She again picked her fav color combo and this time both shoes stay on until she took them off a few hours later.  In fact, the next morning, she put them back on (without charging) and they were still working.  I figured you will have to give it a chance, maybe a couple of more charges before the shoes function as they are supposed to.  It's been almost 2 weeks and so far so good.  No more glitches.  She's pretty happy with her shoes.  Not sure how long before she tires of them or they stop working completely--but like all other fads these  days --all things are temporary.  I would recommend these shoes.  I gave it a 4 out of 5 ONLY because once you  locate the activating button on the inside of the shoes, it really takes some time before you can get the button to get going...was not easy & I can see someone getting frustrated and thinking the shoes are not working."
4.0,"I like it and is made of good quality, I was just wanting a little darker in the color, but overall a good product."
4.0,beautiful bow-tie.  Great quality
4.0,Love these booties!!! Very adorable and very durable
4.0,"It is a gift for a coworker, and is really nice for not a lot of money."
4.0,"These are decent and look pretty sweet on. However, they are just cheap Chinese made sunglasses. My pair has stretched out from normal wear and completely fall off of anything they are hanging on."
4.0,5’4 150lbs. These are a shinier material than other ones I’ve purchased. They are stretchy and comfy. Pockets fit things to include phone and keys. They are a tad loose but still can see my woxer lines on my thighs.
4.0,I live where it's sunny and eyewear is a requirement. These were a quick buy because every last one of my favorite pairs broke and the stuff at the stores are made for small heads. I don't have a small head but these fit perfectly! They aren't my style so I will replace them soon. But they appear a tad thicker all around than in the photo. Or at least it feels that way on my face. They sit nicely. No pinching anywhere and the coverage is well.
4.0,"They were very nice as a gift. My wifeiked them but said the size was a bit snug, but it should be fine. I hope they hold up during workouts."
4.0,"These glasses are polarized and made of glass, the frame is a bit flimsy but for the price I can't really complain.I like to have different lenses for different looks and these are fun and sporty. They also fit very close to the eyes so I don't get a lot of sun sneaking in from the top or sides. I loan these to my guy and he also likes them especially for a day at the beach."
4.0,"Little heavier than I thought it would be, runs a little small. Really pretty"
4.0,Really awesome glasses for the money. Look great and my husband loves them but they came with a scratch on the side.
4.0,"The top is very cute but I think it runs small. I am in between an xl and large,(i like things baggy) so I ordered an xl and it was tight in the breast area. I will keep it and wear it around the house because it really is a cute top."
4.0,Perfecto me quedo y muy buena calidad
4.0,Arms are somewhat smaller than I had wished (but I have large arms). I was hoping that they would be loose like they look in the picture. It still works great under a cardigan or jacket for work.
4.0,My grandson loves his new suitcase.  Thanks! !
4.0,"I love this onesie, but there is one problem with it. The thigh area is really tight. Ive had this in a small and medium and they are both the same size. Having said that I really love this onesie.<br /><br />Oh and for reference I’m 5’5 130 and have thick thighs"
4.0,"I normally wear a size small, but I ordered this in a medium so it would be loose enough to wear to work. I'm glad I did, as a small would have been much too fitted for work. If you're going for a more fitted look, ordering true to size might be just fine. I really liked this dress overall. It looks fairly high quality and received a lot of compliments. I'm about 5'7&#34; and the medium was a good length. It came about halfway down my thigh."
4.0,"I got this for my wife who is 5’ tall. I ordered the small for her which is the size she usually gets although now and then if it’s a tight top, she may need to order a medium.<br /><br />I gave this to her and her first reaction was “How cute!”. Her second reaction was “How soft!” and her third reaction, after trying it on was, “How short!”<br /><br />We both really love the style and we both thought that it was well made. The fabric was very nice and soft. But for my wife, who is very trim and fit but who passed middle age a while ago, it was just too short on her. By too short, I mean that the small was about 3 or 4 inches shorter than how it looks on the sales page; it was more of a crop top than what I expected this to be. She could have gotten away with wearing it if it was as shown on the ad page. Too bad; this is a great top.<br /><br />If she were 30 years younger, this would have been a hit but, alas, we’re now at the age where exposing too much midriff is not a good look.<br /><br />Review of: MYONE Women Sleeveless Hoodie Crop Tank Top"

4.0,"Dress looks great on. Material is thicker but is flattering. The only downside is that the sleeves are a little loose fitting. I wish they were tighter, but will have it altered to fit."
4.0,"These fit nice but if you have tree stump legs like me, they tend to roll up and then theyre uncomfortable."
4.0,"4star being my fault, for I prefer Anchor vertical, hard to see anchor being horizontal.  Otherwise cute, durable, an no wear noted"
4.0,"My son.lovee it.even.though  it is made smoewhat small. Ii thought the hoody part goes lower .to make it look  like  real ninja mask, but it is just a hoody. Lints gets on shirt..underneath or..hair, but overall, i like it a lot."
4.0,This Knit Cardigan Sweater is just perfect for my preteen granddaughter. It is soft and warm without making you hot. It is not a heavy sweater at all. It will be great for summer chills (from ac) or the light winters we have here in South Florida. Overall I am pleased with my purchase as my granddaughters really likes this.
4.0,This costume looked better than I expected. My son loved it.
4.0,"I LOVE them! I've never been able to get my husband to any jewelry (aside from his wedding ring). Not even a watch! It doesn't say who wears which half, so I gave him the 1/2 with the key cause he has the key to &#34;my&#34; heart. We both love them, but they should have made the chain on the mens half about an inch or two longer, or the women's a tad bit shorter."
4.0,"Don't size up, I'm usually a large, sometimes a medium but I bought a xl cause I just had a baby but I could've done a large and it would've looked better. Still cute, love the sleeves! Shoulders looked weird only because I ordered a xl."
4.0,The material is not soft but it is nice
4.0,Mask looks great however it is a little big. Actually covers too much of my face.
4.0,Apron was well made and cute. It was to big for my 3 year old granddaughter. It was a little ong for my 6 year old granddaughter. But nice quality.
4.0,I got it for my boyfriend and he seems to like it. It's a bit thin but still looks pretty good on his pinky.
4.0,"These rings are super tiny like a size 2-3 ring. But, they are a better quality metal."
4.0,"Absolutely LOVE these. You can smell the Olive oil and it makes you feel connected to the holy land. My only complaint is with the ink stamp of&#34;Bethlehem&#34; on the cross. Some might like this, and I'd be okay with it if out were etched or burned into the wood, but the ink feels.... Gaudy? Cheap? I'm not sure, but it diminishes the set for me."
4.0,I’ve given this hat 4 stars simply for the fact that the material the hat is made of is stiff and unbreathable. As a bald man I need some airflow through the fabric. Fits great and looks great but not for spring/summer if you live in a warmer climate.
4.0,"In short, I'm a happy customer. Good fabric, decent size, and feels sturdy.<br /><br />✫ I bought this to replace a Sorrentino bag I got off Amazon about 8 months ago. Like that bag, this Dasein uses a thick, matte faux leather. It's also lined with a cotton like fabric. (A week prior to this, I bought a FivelovesTwo light brown bag and it lacked those aforementioned features of the Dasein.)<br />✫The handle is a tad smaller than I'd prefer. I can fit it on my shoulders but it's a bit tight. (If you've got slender arms, it will probably fit you just right.)<br />✫Using a tape measure, I got pretty much the same dimensions as listed (11.5 inches tall and 14.5 inches long)<br />✫As pockets go, there's nothing too fancy. A zippered pocket on one side, some small, open pockets on the other, and a zipper pocket/divider in the center. I'm not a fan of cenrer pockets because they take up more space than they create, but oh well.<br />✫The bag zips close (a huge selling point for me). There is still a small gap on either side of the top zipper, but it's too small to buy me.<br />✫Right in those gaps are metal loops for attaching the strap. They're in the absolute right position for allowing me to clip on my hand sanitizer and keys so that they can hang inside and not outside of the bag.<br /><br />Things I would improve:<br />✫While I like the gold studs, the rest of the hardware is so shiny it cheapens the look.<br />✫I would have liked to have at least one exterior zipped pocket.<br />✫An inch added to the handles would have made it more versatile and comfortable.<br />✫Remove center pocket, and add more substantial pockets to the interior."
4.0,"Very comfortable tights.  I am a size 4 and ordered a Med, which fit just right."
4.0,"This thing is pretty sweet.  Well made and pretty durable at first inspection.  It fits well, but looking at the pictures you can figure out how they make that work.  The ""crack"" in the skull allows the mask to expand to fit those rather large craniums.<br /><br />It is a little expensive, but I think worth it.  So why not 5 stars?  I am not sure how well it will hold up.  The glue and stitching looks pretty high quality, but I have found a few, VERY MINOR flaws.  I also wish they would have added some bones to the neck.  I liked my other skull mask because it had a vertebrate and the upper rib cage.  You add that to this mask and it will be the greatest Reaper mask ever.  At least you can sort of move your lower jaw on this guy.  I tend to save my 5 stars for truly amazing products.  I may be back to change this one, but in the meantime I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs a good skeleton mask.<br /><br />Oh yeah, the eyes are blacked out, which is a plus.  You can see pretty well, but it is hard to see your eyes.<br /><br />Should be a good Halloween!"
4.0,Cute shades. Looks very polished even though they are plastic. Fits really well. View is good.
4.0,Casual yet dressy at the same time. Good quality and price.
4.0,Runs small for me — I wear a size 7 shoe and I should have gotten the next size bigger (l)
4.0,These were gorgeous although I thought they’d be a little smaller on the buttons
4.0,bought it for a friend. She said it was a bit too warm but will use it when it cools off.
4.0,"i think it's a good presence to my friends, i like it, looks nice and cool, they will love it too... thank you"
4.0,They are okay. I use them
4.0,It keeps my sunglasses from falling off of my face when I'm hiking in the mountains of New Mexico. That was my only expectation.
4.0,"First off, after reading other reviews, I was sold. As a 1st year motorcycle rider, I wanted to get the all year round experience this includes the transitions between summer to winter season, meaning I keep track of the weather for best conditions (for traction). So for starters, yes these gloves do well in the cold. My fingers sweat in them when walking around, and standing.<br /><br />As far as riding, the wind chill may turn a 40 degree ride into 35-30 degrees, and these passed morning have been starting off low 30's.  Comfort wise they are soft inside, smooth going in and out. No diffuculty taking off, especially with the cuff which helps a little for the wrists keeping warm. A bit bulky but defintley insulated. The touch screen isnt too bad but it sometimes doesn't work and I need to press the screen a couple times, but they do funtion well. For 30 bucks they do well compared to my 50 buck Joe rocket gloves. Only thing they dont have is protection on the knuckles as these aren't motrocycle designed gloves, but they are Great winter gloves. By the time my 30 min ride to work is done, I can just barely feel my fingers which is normal with most of the gloves I've used. With my Joe rockets, I use another pair of gloves underneath for better insulation.<br /><br />As far as the reviews talking about the closer to negative degrees. I think you'd be okay for a half hour but I wouldn't trust these gloves to take the endurance of the chill of that degree. If you are looking for artic desert type then maybe look else where but its up to you.<br /><br />I dont suggest working in these, they are a little thick for grabbing things and especially little tight space situations. I think these gloves are best for walking around or maybe shoveling snow but anything else I'd imagine to be difficult. I have a medium pair and they seem to have a bit extra room. Maybe with a small it'd be a bit more of a slim fit. Who knows. I get a large in some gloves so I'd imagine if you're normally large in some gloves, try medium but if you know you got big hands. Large or even XL will be good. Good luck to anybody looking for the best bang for their buck."
4.0,"Super soft, comfy and warm.  Surprisingly breathable.  No stretch in the material so check size info carefully, or just do like me and buy big.  I will say I have a long torso, but these are cut generously so I could have sized down.<br />As with all onsies, remember you basically have to get naked if you need to potty, but this doesnt bother me.  Its  as free feeling as being wrapped in a fuzzy blanket that doesnt let in any drafts."
4.0,"Really beautiful ring!  Looks very expensive!  Will see how.the color.retains after some wear and washing hands, but very pleased with purchase."
4.0,"I love the look of my new bag, but failed to realize the actual size and weight. I gave this bag 4 stars and not 5 because of the weight. I purposely don't put too many things inside just to keep from adding more weight even though it can definitely carry a lot more."
4.0,Good quality runs small ! I returned the medium mens polo and got a large better fit.
4.0,"I wanted to give it 5 stars but... The material feels great and it looks good. I wore it with a white shirt as soon as I got it and when I took it off I had red dye on my white shirt. My recommendation, wash it first and hopefully you won't have that problem."
4.0,The bow was bizarre and looked like it was spun nylon and plastic - very odd. But the hat itself looks nice and should do the job. I just need something with a wide brim to protect my skin from the sun.
4.0,"Package came in mail. You can see how that went. Luckily nothing was broken on it. Batteries that came with it don't work. Once I got new batteries in, everything worked fine."
4.0,Was a little boxy around waist.<br />Needs tapered in at waist.
4.0,"They are too big, but they look really nice. I'm sending them back for a smaller size."
4.0,its a hat. decent quality.
4.0,It’s a nice dress but the mauve is more of a medium/dark brownish tint and not as light as pictured.
4.0,A little bit loose
4.0,Great product just didn't look cute on me
4.0,This sweatshirt was great. It was really soft on the inside which felt nice on my skin. It also fit exactly as I thought it would. I bought it to create a Christmas sweater. I had an iron on design kit and it went on this sweater very easily. I plan to wear this sweater every year for Christmas!
4.0,"It's made out of a weird material. Not your typical shirt material, but I like it. It's comfortable, for sure."
4.0,Nice and comfortable after I added an extension. They didn't have my size. Good little bra for the money.
4.0,"I ordered this dress in 2 colors.  Gray and Blue.  The gray one was fine, nice stretchy material, but the blue one came with a bunch of thread hanging from the arm holes and the bottom of the dress.  Not sure how long the dress is going to hold up, but to be safe, I will not wash it in the machine.  Hand wash for sure.  Also,  I am 5'3 160 lbs and bought a medium.  My measurements are 38,35,41 and have a bit of a tummy.  This helps hide my tummy.  PS.  Don't mind my NIke flip flops in the picture '"
4.0,Tight on my arms but otherwise really comfy!
4.0,Pretty and light material. Will be nice for the warmer weather
4.0,The neck was a little larger than expected however it wasn't too bad to return it. Other than that the fit was perfect for me.
4.0,it was cute.
4.0,"UPDATE: with continued use, the latch became much easier to use. Almost like it needed to be loosened a bit. It is now one of my husband’s favorites. It is lightweight and doesn’t leave him sweaty.<br />Very thin and lightweight watch. The band and face are fine and most importantly the watch keeps accurate time.<br />It lost stars because the latch was extremely difficult to use. We had to use a screwdriver to have leverage to lift the bar and adjust it. Then, once my husband put it on and wore it for a few hours it took both of us working on it to get it unhooked.<br />It would be a four or five star watch with a better mechanism here. I have a watch with a similar lever, and I’ve never had such a difficult time with it.<br /><br />As of now, there is not a price listed but the vine page said $24. That seems accurate for the quality. It’s not going to be perfect at that price, but looks nice and professional when it’s on."
4.0,I was impressed by the shirt quality and fit considering its from China. I ordered a large an normally wear a medium  an it fits good. My only complaint is the word in the middle is spaced out more than I thought but it's still cute.
4.0,Pretty colors. Fits wel
4.0,"It arrived in a very wimpy plastic bag, but it worked fine and was quite bright with the flashing lights"
4.0,The screws on these scratched my lenses and had to get new lenses.  They were nice until I notice that
4.0,good product will purchase again
4.0,"I bought this for my 14yo son. He normally wears small-medium in mens. He's 5'7"", wt 165 (for reference). He's slender and solid. I ordered a L after reading the reviews. I should have ordered the XL so there would be room to grow. The L is more like a slim fit on him. He loves it and wants to keep it. Its still a nice hoodie."
4.0,I purchased an XL in blue. It is not distressed like the photo so I took off one ⭐️.  I live in this shirt. It’s not heavy like a regular sweatshirt but still warmer than a long sleeve tshirt. Contacted customer service about the distressed color 3 months ago but still have not heard back.
4.0,This is very soft comfy material. I feel like an awesome pirate when I wear it. If you like your tops smaller order a size smaller than usual.
4.0,I really thought this dress was pretty and hoped it would work for me.  I bough the size XL it was more like a Medium.  The cris-cross area which should have been under the breast fit me over the breast.  Very disappointed the sizing was off.
4.0,"Did not fit like the picture, but it's a nice sweater."
4.0,Had it 3 weeks. quiet and works well. no complaints
4.0,"bought as a gift, fits great, very happy with purchase."
4.0,"I originally got this vest in white but when it arrived, the side was torn!  I called customer service at Brooks and they were super nice. Got it replaced but I switched to the purple vest instead because the white was very thin.<br /><br />Wore the vest for the Run To Remember race last month. The weather was in the high 40's to low 50's with rain showers. It was freezing!  I layered a tech long sleeve under the vest and was perfectly comfortable. The two side pockets were great for my driver's license and my keys. The center back pocket with a clip was a bonus but not too comfy for my iPhone since it'll swish around as I ran. The vest only weighs about 3 ounces!<br /><br />Overall, it was a great buy. Lightweight, water and wind proof, pockets and stylish. I will use it for many more runs to come. The only thing is that because of the thin material, don't pin your running bib on it!!"
4.0,Women's Athletic Long Sleeve Full Zip Duck Down Running Jacket Workout Sportwear with Thumb Holes Slim Fit<br /><br />I got the white one and I like the way it fits. It has a thin filling in it so it's not overwhelming but warm. It's made out of a nice material that's not the softest but the elasticity on it is adequate and has a nice shape to it. Stitching is not cheap. Zipper doesn't catch and I'm a big fan of the thumb holes. It looks nice on and I doubt I'll be running or working out in it but I can see where they wanted to market it that way.
4.0,"It's light, easy to adjust, does everything I want it to - the only reason I gave it a 4 vs. 5 is while it says packable/ or easy to pack, it arrived with a fold crease front center and back center.  I would have expected it to relax out by now, hopefully over time.  It's not a deep crease and every time I wear it I'll try to ease it out."
4.0,Very pretty. Just hide the clip and it could pass for real
4.0,I've had these for a couple of months now and overall they work well. They do run a little small so get the next larger size. The seam between my left forefinger and thumb has come undone. I'm not sure if it's a workmanship issue or the fact the XL glove fits a little tight. I would buy them again (though I'd get the XXL)
4.0,"Quality is pretty ok, esp considering the v good price!"
4.0,"Somewhat heavier than expected, and the purple beads are darker than the photo, but otherwise cute."
4.0,"Good shirts, but I recommend going size smaller than your normal size. I'm 5'8"" about 205lbs, muscular build, originally ordered XL, too big...ordered L (the size I usually get in TShirts, polo's, etc), still not quite compression, would go M if I order more."
4.0,tiny and cute - wished the balls were a bit bigger - has to know the exact size and how it is on ear with picture of someone wearing. Super sparkly.
4.0,I like these.  My feet did feel the warmth after putting them on.
4.0,"I saw thAt some other reviewers said it looked cheap before I purchased it, but knowing that everyone has their own perspectives I decided to order it. I will say that it is much better looking than I expected. The fabric seems durable and it fits great.. Good purchase for price.."
4.0,"Love this dress! Fit was as I expected based on other reviews! Four stars because the zipper is a little finicky, and there was a small stain. Which isn’t noticeable when I put the dress on. Otherwise the dress is really pretty!<br />I’m 5’4” with a very athletic pear shaped build.  This works perfect for my hips and quads. I can’t wait to wear it to a wedding this summer"
4.0,Nice bag for the price. The texture is different from what I expected.. a little rough on the touch. Perfect for trendy wear and spacious yet light to carry around even with lots of stuff inside.
4.0,Great glasses looks like real glass. These are very good glasses I'm glad I bought them
4.0,"Cute! Super cheeky, was expecting more of a lighter yellow but it’s a very bright deep yellow. Worth the price though. Ordered a S and I’m 5’0 110 pounds 34D. wouldn’t recomend if you aren’t ok with your butt hanging out."
4.0,I am long waisted so I did what a reviewer suggested and got a bra extension. This takes care of my muffin top and is a pretty bodyshaperworks but the belly area still needs works.
4.0,DARN!  I wanted to buy it again.  For the price I didn't want to bother replacing the batterie.  Just had to tap it on the counter to get the gears in line. Great in the pool too.  Lots of compliments too.
4.0,"Material is soft, length is perfect. Only improvement would be something other solid colors."
4.0,"Cute,,  but the  nose piece is really scratchy.  And they  are very wide.  Way too big  =("
4.0,Breathable and comfortable.  It does get scuffed up on the clasp.  Fading also on the band.
4.0,I bought this husky headwear scarf because I thought it looked really cute. The husky plush looks cute and I like how the scarf is a paw. The headwear keeps me really warm at night and it will be perfect for this winter. Putting my hands inside the paws was fun.
4.0,"I've used Clic readers for several years now. My previous pair was XXL size that costs a little more, and fits my fat head, but they had a weakness in the expansion joint at the rear. I bought these regular size readers trying to save a few bucks over the cost of the XXL size, and because they are sturdier, with no rear expansion joint.  But I found that for me they are too tight at the temples and also not enough room from front to back.  Other than that, I really like the magnetic front opening design. When I don't need them to read or see up close I let them hang around my neck. When I'm wearing them, they will never fall off.  Last year I got snookered and bought a cheaper knock-off branded as Click. They had inferior lenses that were always smeared and hard to clean. So be sure you get genuine Clic brand and don't get snookered.  I just got a new pair of Clic XXL readers and noticed that the rear expansion joint has been improved and beefed up."
4.0,I love this bag.  Only disappointment is it is plastic coated.  I use it as my everyday bag because it holds all my gadgets
4.0,Really like this top and got lots of compliments on it the first time I wore it. You should know that the snap at the bottom of the v-neck is the only closure on the front. Otherwise it is open all the way to the waist even though the fabric wraps. I wore a tank underneath and it was fine. Flattering with skinny jeans and knee boots.
4.0,Excellent product..😍
4.0,"To big for my face , if you have a small framed face I wouldn't suggest these for you"
4.0,"I ordered this because I was CONSTANTLY freezing in my office. I needed something that was warm but still ok for an office. This is a super thick and warm sweater. I call it my ""grandma sweater"" because it really does look a little frumpy at times and a little old ladyish, but I'm cool with it. I love the pockets, the cable knit and the warmth. It fits true to size but does get a little pilling on it with frequent wear. I would suggest just shaving it off and you'll be good to go. Overall this is a solid value and you won't be sorry. Cute, comfy and warm.....and grandma-ish. :)"
4.0,Excellent sunglasses.  Very fashionable
4.0,The jacket fits very well. I like the feeling of the lining.
4.0,"Cute but a little large. My child is in the 97 percentile and his size was too large as well as one size down. Oh well, he will grow into them."
4.0,Padding works well for shorter bike rides
4.0,Great fit and love the style. A cross between a square frame and wrap around glasses. Best of both worlds.
4.0,They reallt work
4.0,Cute and light. Got them for my girlfriend and I and we loved them.
4.0,"Fabric was a little stiffened, but still decent"
4.0,Just the size I needed
4.0,"These are the cutest shoe I ever bought form my son. But they do run really flat in the front tow area, so buy a size up and consider a different shoe if your child has chubby feet."
4.0,Lovely material.  Runs large.
4.0,A little tight around hip area. .  String on hood isn't the best so I took it off.  Soft and nice shirt.
4.0,Wish these were easier to close up and open up. But I wear them still.
4.0,"Lucen muy bien , los volvería a comprar"
4.0,It was an inexpensive piece of costume jewelry that my wife absolutely adored. Unfortunately it was not made to last. If it were made to be more sturdy it would command a price 100x what we paid.
4.0,"Cute little bracelet. One problem I had, and could be a serious problem,  Had bracelet on right arm, while driving my car and making a turn the dangling part got caught in my steering wheel.  I had to almost break the bracelet to free it. Would not wear on right arm again as I drive every day. I think it was the little ball that got caught.  Just a heads up."
4.0,"I received this watch for Christmas, 2009.  The face is beautiful, and large. The band, however, is not nearly as elegant or as high in quality as the picture suggests. It is actually a bit stiff. dull, and thin.  It just does not feel like it could possibly last a long time, and it detracts from the beauty of the watch in general.  The manual is thick and thorough, but very poorly translated and difficult to follow at times.  Overall, this is a handsome, albeit very conservative watch.  It is not really worthy of the name ""premier,"" or the premium price.  If you can get it for a significant discount, fifty to seventy percent off suggested retail, you probably won't be disappointed.  Otherwise, keep looking."
4.0,"So the top has elastic which means it won't sip, however the rest of the dress fit pretty big and it was oddly long for me. I am about 120lbs and 5' on the nose so that MIGHT be the reason it was long but i wanted it to be more of a mini dress that i could pair with knee high boots and this is going to require me to adjust the hem. It's made from a bathing suit like material but overall it isn't a bad dress"
4.0,Tight af first as in I could barely get them on but they stretched out quickly and nicely. Very comfortable with the grippy bottom sole. Really like them. I would give them 5 stars but I wish a little less toe showed. I would recommend them for sure even with that edit.
4.0,"After reading all of the reviews about this running large I ordered a size small, I normally wear a medium. I am small, 5'1 and the size small fit just fine, but the sleeves were really short they barely reached to the end of my arms.  I was looking for the oversized look like the model has in the photo. I have very short arms, so I thought this was kind of weird and it didn't give it the ""oversized"" feel. Since they barely reached the end of my arms the sweater sat a little off my shoulder so it didn't really cover all the way over my shoulders either. I am going to be returning the small and going for a medium to get the true comfy oversized but still cute look. The sweater itself was thick and good quality, the color looked exactly like the photo just confused by the sizing after reading the reviews which is why I gave it 4 stars."
4.0,The length is perfect for my leggins and the material is so lightweight. Perfect for our Georgia heat!
4.0,"The fabric is a much better quality than I expected and the color is deep and even. I like the asymmetric gather option. I may add two small darts in tbe back where it's a a straight drop. I'm 70, 5 6 and weigh 165. I got a large and the fit and length is great. Haven't washed it yet but the fabric didn't wrinkle badly during shipping or wearing it today so I think it will do well."
4.0,looks great on and can see perfectly.  would recommend them and would be happy to purchase another pair
4.0,"very  nice blouse, but the XL was really a small."
4.0,5’1 135lbs 36C chest and size 8 dress I usually wear a large in bottoms and a medium top. Based on other reviews I decided to get a XXL out of fear that it would be way too small if I ordered my normal size. The xxl was baggy in the bottoms causing a diaper sort of look but I think a size down would fit perfect. The top isn’t quite your normal string halter bikini. It ties around the back instead of tying around the neck. I have a pretty small chest and it provides absolutely no lift or support for me. I felt like I needed to constantly readjust. I won’t be wearing the top again but I’d recommend this suit just for the bottoms. They are very flattering if you order the right size. The material is fantastic and not see through after being in the water. Took away one star because the top is useless for me.
4.0,"The quality of this band is good. Installation was not difficult. Overall I like it and would consider buying it again if needed. Delivery was super fast for some reason.<br />On the downside, it does not come with instructions. So you are on your own on that one. Due to no instructions on one side I scraped off the double face tape on the watch before installing the new band. The tape holds the top of the band in place. So now on one side it gets a gap and I have to push it back up. The band when new is extra stiff but that gets better over time. These are negatives but not deal breakers. I recommend this product."
4.0,"Comfortable, but run a bit small. Will keep, because I need them & don't have time to exchange before my trip. Will definitely order one size up next time.<br />I wear a nine medium in women's & ordered the 9."
4.0,Nice shirt. Fits as expected. Loose fit. Color is excellent for alertness!
4.0,"Beautiful dress, my daughter loves it!"
4.0,"Back to the office, and missing that comfort? Get yourself a good pair of stretch chinos and one of these belts, and you'll think you are still wearing your sweatpants."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:141d9211c0e10297e7377062ff701c65]] I wore this dress for my first Renaissance Festival that I went to. The skirt and sleeves were a little long, but I’m only 5 foot tall so that’s to be expected. The material could be better but for the price I think this is a pretty good dress. I will also note that if you are buying this for a Renaissance Festival there will likely be a few other girls wearing the same dress because it is the cheapest option on Amazon😂.<br />Size: small<br />Height: 5 foot<br />Weight: 125lbs"
4.0,Exactly what I wanted and as advertised.
4.0,"Little bit big on me, but I’m pregnant so it worked out.. I’m only half way through my pregnancy and I expect it will fit through the next few months.."
4.0,"I really like how this pullover sweater looks and fits. It is a little longer than I expected which is a plus. The bottom has slits on the sides , and the arms have very subtle decorative knit that combine to give it a stylish look. The large gold zipper that goes all the way up adds to the look.  It will go well with casual and dressy jeans or slacks, it is very soft, and provides a good amount of warmth.<br />The zipper works fine when not wearing but I did have trouble zipping up the last 1/4 or so while wearing. It seemed to get hung up and wasn’t a smooth zip all the way.<br />Overall I really like this sweater and would recommend."
4.0,"This is a simple, attractive piece and I'm enjoying it."
4.0,"I'm a little disappointed that I bought these a little over a week ago, and they're discounted more.<br />I thought that they are a little big, but I can get use to it.<br /><br />My head might be a little big or something by my ears, because if I'm wearing these for a bit of time and I need to adjust them, it hurts a little, as if they're too snug.<br /><br />Overall, they're ok, I only gave it 4 stars because of the case it came with. I wish that I could have gotten these glasses at the current sale price of 7.99 instead of the 11.99 I paid, but all well I guess."
4.0,don't write well in English
4.0,Buy a size up. Cut small. Nice dress for work.
4.0,"Not all that happy with this, its far thinner than the one it replaced, and had some burrs on it that needed to be professionally removed. I would give it less ""Stars"" but this vendor was the only on that had what I was looking for in a real pinch so for that I thank them with an extra star."
4.0,I love the necklace. I just wish I would have noticed how small the disc is before I ordered it. It needs to be bigger for the quote.
4.0,"fits nook good,good price"
4.0,"great deal for the money.  fun lights for many uses. Finger bands are<br />a bit weak, but overall good value...they perform as advertised."
4.0,Oversized square frame blush colored sunglasses.  The square frame is very retro and the color is great.  I like how the sunglasses have the slim coated aviator sides. The sunglasses are fairly thick through the lenses but they are still lightweight. The glasses come with a white pleather case that protects the lens from scratches.  I like the case for when I am carrying the glasses in my purse. The sunglasses are nice and comfortable and fit well.
4.0,they slip on and are a comfort for my legs.
4.0,"I originally posted that it was just ok but not great. Later after wearing for a while I noticed it does provide warmth I needed in cold country. But this is not for the weak. If your legs are weak, find a slipper with a sole that gives balance. So, I need balance as well, this is just a temporary fix until I find a good slipper."
4.0,Very cute necklace. It looks as pictured. The letter is very cute and elegant. The chain is small and comfortable. It is simply a beautiful necklace. I did not realize that there would be a cross on the back of it. I am not religious anymore ao wearing the cross felt wrong. It is very pretty but I wish it was just the letter.
4.0,"These nike's run a little bigger than my other nike air max shoes.  They also seem like they might be a little more narrow. I always buy size 7 and different nikes fit my feet much different (see where my toe is in my shoe in pic).  I have bought size 7 nikes that are really snug, nikes that fit just right and nikes that are too big. My feet are very fat these days so if your foot is fairly normal they will probably fit you well.<br /><br /> Every person's feet are different and feel comfortable in different types of shoes.  I thought sketchers were the shoe for me but I was still having problems because I have plantar facietus and heal spurs.  When I got Achilles tendonitis I knew I had to do something different.  A friend told me to try nike air max. I got nike air max and that was the right shoe for me.  My feet had never felt better.  I've been though 2 pair and couldn't find exactly the same ones I had last time so I got these ones.  Once they are broke in they might feel better but for now they are a little uncomfortable on the top of my foot because I need a wide shoe but I have trouble finding them."
4.0,It looks pretty good tho still made in China.
4.0,Very happy with the product good value
4.0,"I really like this dress! It's not too short for me (I'm 5'2&#34;), but I could see where it could be too short for an especially tall person. The waist is also a little high, but that works fine for me because I have a shorter torso. The arm holes are not too tight and I feel like I can move around well in it. It DOES wrinkle super easily though, so keep that in mind. I also wear it with a slip because it is unlined."
4.0,Good overall. The interior hard foam by the mouth collapsed while I was carrying the helmet and so now I get this yellow pollen looking dandruff everywhere. Works with SENA headsets however it's pretty snug as is so it takes some tweaks to keep my ears from being crammed by the speaker inserts. Dual visor works well and feels sturdy. Helmet breathes terrifically. I've had no fogging problems yet.
4.0,"HEY, HEY, HEY!!!<br />Okay, here goes... This hoodie is thin, and not breathable at all. The fit is good - I typically wear a women’s XL, so that’s what I ordered and it fits right - if you’re looking for a roomier fit, definitely order at least one size up. The sleeves were also long enough to cover my long arms. The white is slightly see-through... In the photos, I’m wearing a black t-shirt that says ‘Severna Park’ across the chest, so I’d definitely wear a solid-colored shirt underneath. The stitching along the front pocket is black, not white as advertised, and the yellow lines that run from the shoulders down the sleeves don’t line up. Lastly, the hood is pretty small, and the drawstring is kinda crappy. I wasn’t expecting perfect quality when I purchased this, so I’m fine with the more minor imperfections. If you’re looking for a high-quality Fukurodani sweatshirt, look somewhere other than Amazon."
4.0,Nice but they've got a logo on them if that bothers anyone
4.0,"Great product, but takes a long time to deliver"
4.0,Shorter than pictured.  Went up a few inches longer than qrists.
4.0,I love mine. The pictures are nothing compared to the actual bracelet. I wish it was a bit lighter in color....that is why I gave it a 4 star and not a 5 star......very nice piece.
4.0,the fabric around your head sits a little lower than most baseball caps. creates a weird situation around your ears if you have long hair. other than that good quality hat
4.0,I give 4 because is little small!!! But confortable to walk he seen happy to walk with those!!!
4.0,The belt was of good quality and was comfortable. I've used it several months now and its still holding it shape and appearance well
4.0,Good quality but a little too thin
4.0,"Looks good, and seems durable.  I have been wearing it for about a week, and it's still there (I did use a different chain though)"
4.0,"The wife here, I’m in love with this dress. It’s so cute!! I got 2-3 for my almost 2 year old daughter, as she wears 2-3 in everything else. It fits a tad tight but should be alright for Christmas. Absolutely adorable though!"
4.0,"My sister loves them. She says she likes that they have a little bit of weight to them unlike some of her other ones. Also since they’re rounder they’re more comfortable to lay on. I will say though the color was not what I was expecting, the picture shows what looks more like a rainbow but it does not irl. It has three rows of colors (I think blue green and yellow but I could be wrong) and a crackle affect but not a rainbow."
4.0,"Really comfortable, very soft and stretchy. Size down one."
4.0,love the print and colors in this shirt.  It fit my husband in the shoulders but too wide in the waist.  We gave it to a friend that loved it
4.0,Awesome shades.  These are fantastic style for the price.  Love the look and arrived very quickly.  Four stars because they did not come with any type of bag to store them in...just wrapped in plastic but shipped in box so no damage.
4.0,"I was really excited to find this scarf because they have so many non-traditional color choices.  I liked this purple and yellow pattern because I wear a lot of purple during the winter and never have a scarf that matches, other than a black or white scarf.<br />I received the package quickly and was pleased with the scarf.  The fabric isn't as soft as I was hoping, which is why I deducted the star, but the color is nice and will look great with my winter clothes.  It also is thick enough to keep me warm when it is cold, unlike some scarves I have that are too thin."
4.0,Just wasn’t big enough
4.0,Like the color and the adjustability.  Don't like the odd look of the adjustable portion inside the lens.
4.0,"These are a nice pair of socks.  They seem to be of good quality and well made.<br /><br />They are I would call a medium thickness, definitely thick enough for hiking and working, but not too thick to cause your shoes to not fit right or anything.<br /><br />I have a size 10.5 foot and they fit sung. Not tight just snug. If you have a large foot this may be an issue for you.<br /><br />Overall I'm pretty happy with these and would get another set."
4.0,"Great price for genuine Franco Sarto foot wear. They are a bit tight initially but expect they will loosen up with wear since they are genuine suede. The toe bed is a bit narrow, so my toes barely show. The high heel is chunky, so they are easy to walk in. My only concern is the strap is so thin, it may possibly break in the future. There are no buckles so one must pull the strap to get into the shoe. Otherwise, very attractive shoes."
4.0,"I don't know if this s really authentic , and it didn't come in the original packaging as it said it came it a black box but I really love it and it feels very good quality. The closure for the locket it a magnet so it doesn't like click when you close it and it doesn't flop open at odd times when u wear it. Has a really nice rolo chain and toggle clasp. this is the most realistic match locket from the show that I have found. Also in the reviews the seller said they could change the stone color but I asked and u cannot but doesn't change how much I love this locket."
4.0,"I saw this hat @ REI and loved it. It's an overall muted pink with stripes (because of the knit) that is mauve that looks grayish. The inside is fully lined with the softest, pink fleece. The hat fits perfectly, not too tight but just right. It keeps my head quite warm. This is not a year round beanie. Also, you can wear it folded or unfolded for more of a slouchy look. I stalked this hat on Amazon until the price came down then snagged it. I have many hats, and this one will be a favorite among my collection. The only complaint I have is the Northface label positioned smack dab front and center forehead. I wish the label was a bit more subtle. I plan on removing it and re-stitching it on to the back of the hat where the seam is ... or leave it off."
4.0,"While I love the fit and design of this shirt, I'm afraid the quality of the fabric could be better. I think the company can opt for a better material and increase the price accordingly, people will still buy it. It is a great design !!<br />Update: second batch ordered looks a little better quality."
4.0,"I play Santa every year for my rescue group to take pictures with pets and needed gloves that a)fit my BIG hands (I am a real life santa body type, lol), and b) that could cover my wrists in photos as I wrestle to keep pets in my lap.  It TOTALLY worked this year with these gloves!  The fingers were slightly big on mine, but the gloves are well made for the price and washed well."
4.0,"Great sunglasses and they are the type I was looking for. They are just a little darker than I expected, but they fill the bill."
4.0,Runs small and fabric is thick but cute top.
4.0,"Cute shoes pretty close to size but wide so i wouldnt recommend if child has very skinny or narrow feet, but other than that great shoes for price."
4.0,Very beautiful but 3ft is such a small amount. It's perfect for a small job if you have multiple jobs in mind you'll have to order a ton or look elsewhere.
4.0,"I ordered the XL, I’m normally a large top and xl bottoms to accommodate my thight and butt combo, that has always been my burden that now people are willing purchasing. It’s madness but I digress. The dress was snug, stretchy but snug. It fit like a large. The top part was just fine but from the waist down it was tight. It seems that XL for this dress means it’s longer because there was so much of the dress puddles on the floor AFTER I put it on. I’m 5’2 so most things are too long but this dress had almost 2 ft of fabric just on the floor. Normally a cute pair of heels can fix my issues with long dresses but not this dress. I was very cute though and the fabric is light and soft. Great for summers."
4.0,"The jacket is nice and is what I expected for the price if not more then what I expected. The only odd this is the zipper is on the left side not the right as with most jackets, took a bit to get used to but it is what it is."
4.0,It came very late but was exactly as shown
4.0,"Quality shorts with plenty of pockets.  Comfortable feel and fit as expected.  Good for hiking and other lighter (less sweaty) athletic activities.  When I ran, shorts did not wick sweat away much and they became heavy with all of the sweat the shorts retained."
4.0,This is what I expected.
4.0,Meeting my need at the moment
4.0,"Fits well, but runs very small. I normally wear a Womens S or XS, and based on reviews ordered the size large, which fits perfectly. So definitely order up a size or maybe 2! Color is great and very flattering to a variety of skintones. I like that it is a &#34;club&#34; dress but still has long sleeves, sometimes more coverage is nice for winter/cooler nights. I plan on using this dress in glamour portrait photo sessions as well, which I think it will photograph beautifully. Seems pretty wel made, but the material is kind of itchy on the inside. Not unbearable, but would be nice if it was softer/easier to wear. All in all, very cute though! I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"These leggings are amazing, however can’t find anywhere and had to settle for this style (only option available in my size, at the time) - and of course, it’s so light so it’s kinda see-through. Would totally buy up all similar designs if they’d restock!"
4.0,"El color del abrigo es un poco diferente a como se ve en la imagen, parece que es un color verde intenso, pero al final resulta un agua marina pálido, No es problema, el artículo es perfecto y cumple con las espectativas, pero si es un poco distinto el color que trae con el que se anuncia"
4.0,I little itchy but nice
4.0,This is lovely and it get's a lot of compliments. It also kind of feels like it's made out of curtains. But it doesn't itch or anything so I'm calling it a win!
4.0,They are warm and comfortable
4.0,"The item was without any box or something, just the gauntlet.<br />All LED lights are working.<br />Good gift for a child."
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine.  She wanted silver star stud-like earrings.  I could not them local to me and found these to be exactly what she wanted.  She loved them.  PLEASE NOTE: I took a long time for me to receive them.  It took a long time to receive them as a non-Prime member - 12 days, when it was quoted to be received within ""7 days""."
4.0,Worn it this past Sunday.  There is definitely two different material from the two and bottom and it's a bit short waist-ed if you are top heavy but it worked.Will definitely need to be hard pressed/ironed.
4.0,"Tried getting used to these but hurt like crazy, so I wear toe socks with them that really helps!  My heels are getting a real workout and sore after wearing them par of the day. I can tell a difference with my tired feet."
4.0,"I was looking for something to wear around the house, these are very soft and comfortable. Wish I had them for my last hospital stay, very easy to get on and off"
4.0,Does not sang hair. Stays put!
4.0,The plugs were a bigger size than the tapers and the tapers weren't even the same size one was significantly smaller than the other so that kinda sucked. The tapers even tho I ordered 00 wouldn't even stretch my ears to that size so I was never able to fit in the plugs. That was a downer.
4.0,Very stretchy.. fits just as expected! Only issue is mine still rolls down.. 🥺 besides that I love it!
4.0,Great seller. Excited to see them before estimated delivery date. Recommended. Would have been nice if the airline name was on pin but understand why it is not.
4.0,"Earrings are a lot larger than I imagined, thought they'd be 1/4 of the size. But very nicely made. If you like big earrings or it's a gift for someone who wears larger jewelery then you'll be super happy with these. Would give them 5 starts for quality but giving 4 stars overall as the large size is not what was expected."
4.0,Very nice<br />Thought card would be larger
4.0,Dainty and petite. Love it.
4.0,Product is good.  My issue is with toe fit.  If your not accustomed to socks with toe fit takes a little adjusting.  I would buy from this company again just not with fitted toes.
4.0,"It’s a great compact wallet,and I like that I can put quite a few things in; if there is a lot in the slots it’s hard to grab and bring out."
4.0,"I purchased this rolling tote about a year and a half ago to use when I go grocery shopping as I do not own a vehicle and have to rely on a bus. The top tote is very roomy and can hold a fair amount of groceries and the drawstring helps keep everything securely in place.  The bottom tote is insulated to help keep items cold which comes in handy living in AZ. I like that it can collapse for easier storage.  The height is perfect for me and it rolls very easily especially over curbs and varied terrain.  My only complaints is that additional wheels are not available from this company to replace the wheels when they wear down (at least I have not been able to find anything).  The other issue is the bag attaches the the frame with Velcro.  When the top tote is loaded with groceries the Velcro comes loose, luckily the tote is still is held in place due to the top part of the bag is fastened to the lower handle part with rivets but it does sag a little.  Other than these two issues I have really loved this rolling tote and it has really served its purpose well."
4.0,"ahh, for the price its good belt but it stretches... alot. I have had to drill out 4 news holes in the last couple months. maybe i am losing weight but my scale does not agree."
4.0,Cute for fun... not for ''good''
4.0,My daughter loved it! Fits well & material nice quality.
4.0,"I looked at the pictures, but not at the measurements.  The pictures make the purse look bigger than it actually is."
4.0,"Fine strap, should have ordered extra long, but this will work."
4.0,"I gave it four stars for comic value alone. Hey, it keeps time just fine both analog and digital; and it's easy enough to set up. Can't tell what day of the week it is without a magnifying glass, but that's not a big deal. The really funny part about it is the size. The thing is so thick it's like having three regular sized watches on top of each other. If you like BIG watches (and I do mean BIG), this thing is for you. And for less than $10? Why not?"
4.0,"They are comfy. The top is like T-shirt material and the pants are fuzzy fleece. The top fit, but was a little snug. I bought a large. I wear a size 12 normally and am a 36D. I was given another set of PJs for Xmas from the same brand, but both the top and bottom were fleece and the top fit better. Overall very pleased with them."
4.0,"I had bought 2, one black and one sliver, both came in sliver. Still very good buy"
4.0,"For the money  a good product. The height of the lens could be bigger, allowing more room for distance and intermediate vision before the bifocal part comes into view. But again for the money, quite good."
4.0,"Very pretty,  but detail is not as discernible as in pictures."
4.0,My son loved his gift and everyone was envious.
4.0,Good quality. Used to replace leather band on Tissot watch.
4.0,Not made as well as I would like also not the exact color I would like
4.0,Nice tee shirt!
4.0,This is a present for my Grandson I just love it and I know he will too. I wish it came with instructions.
4.0,These sunglasses came very neatly packaged and they have a futuristic appearance maybe for the younger generations. The arms are clear plastic coated. They seem like they are good quality and durable. They aren’t my style though.
4.0,Nice look...Wife loved it...
4.0,"This was a little bigger than I expected, but at least now my niece will be able to wear it longer than anticipated. :D"
4.0,Glasses steam in coid!
4.0,"Received 2 last week.  As soon as my wife saw it she noticed it had no hem where the material has been cut and wondered if it will begin to fray.  I used one on a 2 day backpacking trip on the AT over the weekend.  Worked well.  I wore it do-rag style to keep bugs off my head, shield the back of my neck from sunburn, and of course to soak up sweat.  This bandana is long enough that when I stopped for a rest I could flip the dry end around.  It dries very quickly, so by the next stop I'd flip it again.  The cut ends didn't fray even after washing, but do roll over (curl?).  I only gave 4 stars because of the potential fraying question, but perhaps it's a non issue.  Time will tell.  For 8 bucks, I can't really complain.<br /><br />Update:  Our fourth purchase.  Our granddaughters use them now as well.  No fraying of cut ends of fabric at this point.  Treated with permethrin a couple of weeks ago, so far all is good.  Druthers would be to have pattern/colors inside and out.  Will likely buy again."
4.0,"Very cute, but quality is lacking. I didn't like the style on me, but I have them to my sister in law and they looked so cute on her."
4.0,I bought this fory daughter. It fit perfectly. She said comfortable.
4.0,like all the handle options good size
4.0,"Just love it. Really strange fabric - feels like a “never drown” bathing suit, but looks really cute on. Wish it had pockets."
4.0,"I love this dress. It's super sexy and attractive. I ordered size small because I am petite. 4&#34;11 height and 90lbs weight. The dress fits me perfectly,it's not too loose or too tight and not too long or not too short. It's exactly what I want it to be,very comfortable for me to wear. I like how the dress is made and the style is design to make women feel beautiful about their selves. I like how it hugs and fit my curve. I can wear it for social gathering or going to a party,wedding or prom. I like the material, it is made of polyester and spandex but mostly polyester,if it's all cotton I could have given it a five star. You have to pay close attention to the sizing though because it might not be the usual size you normally wear but mine fits my small body.The back part is kind of see through and the halter has snap which easily holds your back. I like how the white and black stripe is design,very artistic. I received this dress at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. My husband said I look good with this dress, I am so glad I got this,I am satisfied with the shipping and handling too. Great job."
4.0,"I am 5’5” and 128 pounds and I was surprised that these pants fit as well as they did considering most of the reviews said they ran very small.<br />The size is confusing but I would say they are a tight medium, but definitely not medium /large.  I bought 5 pairs and planned to use them for yoga practice at home.  ( My usual pant size is between 6 or 8, depending on the brand.)  I love all the colors and they are stretchy and hold their shape, which I was looking for.  The yellow and white show a slight panty line but the darker colors do not.  Over all I like them very much and I am hoping they wear well."
4.0,"Very nice, I bough it t for my Granddaughter she loves it."
4.0,My husband loves this shis fits perfect
4.0,"Too difficult to put on, but way better than the other brand I tried"
4.0,"This classic piece of delicate jewelry is just right for the casual young lady.It was very nicely packaged with a cleanly scented sachet. All around, nicely done.😊"
4.0,"I really wanted to love this dress but it’s just not made for short people. No matter what I tried, it was just too long. The material is great and it isn’t very see through, so I’d say if you’re taller than 5’4”, this dress is totally for you!"
4.0,"ahhhhh... i love it n stuff but the size was rather small to be the one i have ordered (the cm n w/e) but it seem to small.... the design is great, looks durable too."
4.0,"Nice top! It is flowy but sexy. I recently had a child and needed some new tops to hide my pooch, this does the job. I am 5'4&#34; 135 and ordered a small and fits good! Nice soft stretchy material"
4.0,Runs really small. Way smaller than the 3 other Arcteryx hats I own. My hat size is 7 3/8 in fitted hats. The snaps are on the last 3 my other Arcteryx hats are don't have any free snaps if that tells you anything. Otherwise I love the low profile and is great Arcteryx quality as usual. Just if you have a larger head or long hair I would reconsider because I have a shaved head and still is small on me would definitely fit a child.
4.0,Bought it as a gift and she loves it. Love the quote.
4.0,I love the suit but it didn’t fit as expected I followed the size chartbitvruns a bit small
4.0,"These are really cute. Lovely design, very girlie. I don't believe they are durable though, particularly the white coating. I would say that they are great for one time use as my daughter wore them once for about 3 hours and they are pretty scuffed up, particularly in the front. But they served their purpose, so can't complain."
4.0,I ran into a pack of these when they first come out in Walmart.  Such a great buy I figured why not.<br />I can only wear cotton so the seamless ones are no good for me.<br />They are truly the best feeling underware.  They don't ride up in the front or the back.<br />The coverage is perfect with no leg gap because the leg elastic is a little tighter.<br />HOWEVER.  I have to go from a 2x (fits perfect almost everywhere after a good hot dryer.) To a 3x so my waist is a little more comfortable because I am not skinny waisted and thick thighed.  So now the waist  is still cutting and the rest of them are too big and baggy.<br />Anyone else have this problem?
4.0,"it is what i was looking for, but the clasp is way to close to the bead making it hard to fasten. the clasp is huge and the loop is so small (big enough), but again, hard to fasten (behind your head)."
4.0,Pretty!  Quality is okay.
4.0,"Order up by two sizes! An XL fit me fine, and I am a size 9 in clothes!"
4.0,Nice and not too hot to sleep in
4.0,"These came in looking SUPER tiny but has a ton of stretch and I had no problem putting them on. See picture for comparison laying flat.<br /><br />However, I do think they run slightly small. The material is soft and has that nulu material feel! The waistband is not super wide, in my opinion, thus not as flattering as leggings with wider waistband.  I do really love the seamless crotch cut tho!<br /><br />I normally wear a size 4, 26"" and 135 to 140lbs."
4.0,This is a gift for my mother in-law.  I like it and I cannot wait until she opens it.
4.0,They are the most common color for tie and shirt.... Nice quality made... I like it!!!
4.0,"Cute dress, slightly cheap fabric but still good for the cost."
4.0,My daughter loves the show Miraculous Ladybug. I bought these thinking that she could use them. The clamp is quite strong. She couldn’t wear them.
4.0,Loved the color in the necklace!
4.0,"The extra large was on sale plus some of the reviews mentioned the pants ran small so I got it even though my husband is traditionally a large. The shirt is a little baggy (as expected) but honestly still fit well despite the larger size and works since it’s a pirate costume. The pants fit since we got the larger size although they’re a bit high on the leg (but a traditional pirate outfit would probably be too for when stepping around water). As other reviews mention it comes with an eye patch that isn’t pictured in the description, so that’s a nice bonus. And everything else pictured is there too :) it was of decent Halloween costume level build (so not really every day clothes but good for the couple nights you might wear it in your life). And it’s made out of this velvety material that my husband liked but it’s backwards in feel so I don’t care for it but I’m not the one wearing it 😝 all in all, on sale for $15 I recommend. I’m not sure if I’d pay much more than $20 for it though. But I’m a cheapskate - that’s why I made our dog’s parrot costume instead of buying one for her too 😛"
4.0,"It was not there on the day it said it was directly delivered.  However, it was there in the mailbox the following Monday.<br />Thank you"
4.0,"So far so good!  Because these sock liners have a toe area that covers most of the top of my foot gives them an A+.<br />Some sock/no show liner socks barely cover the toe area and then are also short up the heal and tend to slip off .  Not these, they stay put!!  Only 1 washing so not sure how long they will hold up but elastic around the edges stayed well even after the dryer!!!  So reason for 4 stars,  hopefully they will continue to hold up!!!"
4.0,"I really wanted to love this dress, but it came in somewhat large across the shoulders and fit everywhere else. Odd fit across the chest. Ordered one size down and had the waist altered."
4.0,It’s big but is so pretty
4.0,I like the way it looks for sure. But there’s just something about the way it feels. it’s a bit too light of a material that feels like cheap fabric. Bottom line... great for the money.
4.0,"I originally bought these for a cold weather under layer.  For that purpose they did not work as well as I wanted.  The Duofold mid weight worked better, however, I realized a much better use for these...Compression. I tend to suffer from achy and restless legs after a workout, sometimes making it hard to sleep.  These fixed that problem like a charm.  The only reason I gave them four stars is because the seams are not as strong as I would like, and tend to lose strings.  Not sure how long they will last but I guess for the price I can buy more.<br /><br />For reference on the size i am 5' 10&#34; 160 lbs.  I bought a small.  Medium would probably fit as well but maybe not have the compression I want."
4.0,"Should offer smaller size, too large for my wrist"
4.0,They are so cute! They hurt your head a bit where they poke you on the ears!
4.0,Too tight in the armpit area
4.0,"The waistband didn't hit quite right, so I took a star off., Otherwise, looked nice for the price."
4.0,They work good for my daughter eye glasses but had to air them out before she wore them have a smell from the paint it went away
4.0,"A nice comfy but light long sleeve top.  This is really something to wear in the warmer weather though as the material really is quite thin.  So don't wear this on a cold day thinking it will keep you warm it won't, but as a summer top for keeping the sun off you while being cool?  This should be excellent for that.  Comfy shirt, nice fit and looks pretty darn good."
4.0,"Perfect for the intended purpose. The only con is a small piece of plastic on the top band. It looks like it is part of the molding process, but it scratches the top of your foot if barefoot."
4.0,Fits the way I like except waist band pretty tight (incentive to work out more??)
4.0,"I haven't used them yet, but after trying them on they are very comfortable.  I bought them because my legs tend to swell on long flights and I have found compression socks help. I'll update after my first long flight."
4.0,I love this dress and it is super comfortable.  My only issue is that I have a long torso so the waistline (elastic) is a little high on me - which is a typical issue for me.  I love the length and the fabric.  Feels like casual wear but looks dressy enough for work in a law office.
4.0,"I just got this set, so this is only an initial review. Let's see how they last over a period of time. I like the look of the bracelets, they're decently made and looks nice. The biggest drawback are the drawstrings: They're very thin and feel flimsy. And they slide too easily, making the bracelet loosen over time and I have to keep re-tightening them. Also, the size of the string aren't uniform: the lava rock and one of the lava rock/tiger's eye combo tighten very close, but the tiger's eye bracelet is noticeably looser. Overall, if you want an affordable tiger's eye/lava rock combo bracelet, this is a pretty good deal."
4.0,"i really love this bathing suit. it's comfortable and nice material, doesn't feel too cheap. i'm usually a small for a top and a medium for bottoms, but i got the small bc the bottoms are adjustable. they're fine, but the top was a little big. it looked fine but i just didn't like how loose it felt. so, i cut the straps from the straps that go under your boobs and tires them so it fit. now it fits perfect and i'm happy, i just wish it fit right in the first place bc i really liked the crossed design in the back."
4.0,Love the material and weight of sweater. Just needs to be bigger.
4.0,"These are good, but not great.  I think I bought the wrong model. I've always liked footjoy socks, but I like the regular Crew better."
4.0,"Fits in Oakley frame perfectly. Lenses is a little thinner, more flimsy than original but for the money and availablility, would purchase again."
4.0,Nice product.  Quite sturdy.
4.0,"I would've rated it 5 stars but I rated four because even though i already have a small nose, the nose rings were small and very hard to fit into my nose. I had to force it a bit but its amazing! (Also if you want to wear the lip rings i'd rec for you to wear it as a nose ring instead because it too small for my lips. I have medium sized)"
4.0,"These are fantastic shorts, and I wanted them for the fitness class I teach. However, they were uncomfortably small, even though I ordered my regular size. They must be pretty popular, because they are rarely in stock."
4.0,"It's a good costume, but very see-through. I will have to use something under the dress because it is very revealing. But the color is nice and it is very confortable. It runs a little large, I am used to buy XL and this is not too tight, which is good. Let's see after washing it."
4.0,Dress is nice for casual night out.
4.0,"Great style,nice material,good fit,great leaf print."
4.0,"Very nice! Overall very happy with these plugs! Some flaws and imperfections, inconsistency with sizing. For the price, they're great and I'm happy."
4.0,The  beach.
4.0,Like the dress looks just like the pic.
4.0,"Super cute!  Unfortunately the toe box ran quite narrow with no way to stretch (hard canvas type material/shell), so I had to return (too tight). Heel is about 6 inches high.  Very cute, but runs narrow."
4.0,"Cute shoes. My daughter wore them to school the first time and they were already scuffed on the front, the brown color was coming off. She still loves them but not shoes that will last long when playing in them."
4.0,For the price they're decent. The plug itself is comfy and rubbery enough to wear for work but the color is a very pale pink/yellow and looks more like rose quartz than skin when they're in my ears. That being said I can make it blend better by putting light foundation on my love and it matches ok.
4.0,"Love this, very vibrant pink color.  This line runs small, order a size or two up."
4.0,"smaller then expected, these fit perfectly on my four year old. Adults liked them as party favors for the wedding. I guess they were fine for what i needed them for."
4.0,"My husband wanted something for an everyday commute to store books and just a few things in, nothing big for a laptop or computer.  This works perfectly.  It fits a coupld of books, small tablet, a few writing instruments, etc.  The leather is nice and it's not too flimsy.  It isn't as big as I though it would be, but it's still a nice bag."
4.0,"I read a review that said to size up for half sizes, so I ordered a 7 (I usually wear 6.5). I wish I had sized down instead. I can make them work with insoles and thick socks, but the ankle feels loose. Other than that, they're surprisingly comfortable and look as good as more expensive leather boots."
4.0,I liked it but it did come in a little smaller than i wanted it too. Would i buy again. Yes... but would order an extra large.
4.0,"A little too stiff to be imitation silk, but pretty and light weight."
4.0,I am used to women's clothes not fitting properly so I sized up. It is way to big....but would I trade that for comfortability? No I would not. I am also 5'1 so I have about 4-6 inches of fabric at my feet. But I expect that with anything.
4.0,"Confortable, bit larger than expected."
4.0,"These are really great compression packing bags. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that the zipper gets caught on itself while zipping. But I find if I am very careful, I can avoid that."
4.0,"The Capris are nice, the material is thin for summer. Fit well, I bought the L even though they recommended the XL. Fit great. Im glad I bought a longer top to pair with. They are pretty see thru. I love the style with the folded hem."
4.0,"I'm a size 18-22 depending on the cut of the fabric, 40J cup. The only thing I dislike about this dress is the padding for the chest area. It looks bulky and awkward. Everything else about this dress is amazing. The fabric breathes very well, it stretches but hugs where it needs to. I would have loved to have seen the padding be removed and replaced with a similar fabric to what the dress is made from."
4.0,Super comfy....but straps are not adjustable....
4.0,"From other reviews online I ordered the 32D. I want a snug bra but not super tight, to sleep in after my augmentation about a month ago. My rib cage measurement is 26.5&#34; and my bust is 32.5&#34;. The band on this bra is a lot looser than I thought it would be. I can easily fit my whole hand under the band by my sternum. But the cups hold the girls in tight enough that they really don't move much. Again, I want something to sleep in, I toss and turn so much, that I need the extra support to roll over now. My only complaint is that this bra irritates my arm pit area and scratches my back a bit near the clasps. Also, I think the seams across the boobs are really weird and extremely noticeable. Doesn't bother me for sleeping, but thought maybe someone else might want to know about that."
4.0,Good buy. Fit nice. Keeps my man boobs in place.
4.0,nice - use them pretty much every week.
4.0,"I bought this fanny pack for travel and I like the bright color. ONE bit of advice, I'm a woman's medium and I had to extend the belt all the way out to fit me. They sell an &#34;extender&#34; which you would need if your waist is larger than a woman's medium.<br />Other than that, I really like the fanny pack."
4.0,"The dress was not cotton, it’s a stretchy Rayon material. It fit well the only complaint is the pockets don’t stay inside the dress had to continue to put the pockets back and the dress doesn’t stay off the shoulders also adjusted continuously if wanted to obtain the look."
4.0,"Fabric feels nice and soft, but a little thin.  Not sure how they will last,  but they are very comfortable.  FWIW, I'd get them again."
4.0,"Cute, higher priced than quality justifies,  lettering exactly as shown.  Fun styling."
4.0,Watch is as described
4.0,"I love it, the dress fit perfectly.  I would buy in different colors."
4.0,This dress was better made than I thought it would be considering it was under 40.00. Looks nice on. The only draw back is the color. Was more red than I expected.
4.0,I like this because it's hand free and  doesn't get in the way while you shop
4.0,This wallet is very cute and vibrant color. Also sewing and sticking is good
4.0,Got this for my husband in a size 10 because there was no 9.5 in stock (his usual size) . He wore it with a thick pair of socks and it fits great! The 9 would have definitely been too tight. He says his feet feel so light and are comfortably cushioned in these shoes. A very good shoe for a great price.
4.0,These shoes are OK. They fit well. It isn't really what I wanted though.
4.0,"Fits well, would purchase more if different colors are available."
4.0,Love these pajamas super cute.  Iv already gotten several complaints only down side is its seethrew
4.0,"Material slightly different than expected- and dress is longer than I expected, truly a dress to me -not a tunic! Love the color!"
4.0,Comfy and cute. Fits as expected
4.0,"The skirt itself was really cute, pretty well made. Perfect color. I’m not that big, but I’m not super skinny. Perfectly average 8-10 depending on the brand. Ordered a large. Couldn’t even zip it up. If you have a tiny waist it will work, alas, I do not. And it was so small that I doubt ordering the XL will fit, either. BUMMER"
4.0,I ordered a size large which is the size that I wear & this is too small & the sleeves are not as long as I prefer.  They do not come all the down to my wrist.  Size up in this.
4.0,Like style. Like colored.
4.0,Looks nice<br />Good quality<br />I order blue color as in pictures but received green color
4.0,Not the best quality but definitely a great design!
4.0,"It is beautiful as pictured, but it didn’t give a lot of room to adjust it. When I did, it came loose. I would have returned it, but it was too late when I realized it."
4.0,"This suit has clean lines and looks sporty. It was slimming and the material feels high quality. The only thing I didn't realize is there are no cups or padding in the bra; it is just a shelf bra. I prefer some sort of padding, but I was able to add my own soft cups in so I am happy with my purchase."
4.0,"Nice fit, a bit awkward on the bust line. Other wise i'm 5'2 and 128 pounds a small fits fine."
4.0,Its quality
4.0,"I am very sad to report that these are too big for me. I ordered my usual size and would guess these are a full size larger. The straps were really loose, too, so it’s possible they are a half-size too long, but a full size in the straps. They literally wouldn’t stay on my feet. However, my sister is one to one and a half sizes larger than me, and these fit her perfectly. She absolutely loves them and says they are the most comfortable flip flops she’s ever worn. Being aged 50-something Oregonian girls, we’ve tried a LOT of flip flops (year round wear for us in the PNW) so it’s even more impressive that these are her favorite ever."
4.0,fits exactly
4.0,"They look like they cost, kind of cheap, but wife likes it so thats all that matters."
4.0,The shirt is very cute and good quality but I ordered one size up and it’s still a bit snug.
4.0,"While these are really cute, they're not quite as pictured.<br />I ordered a large so they'd be slightly baggy ( I can fluctuate between a medium and large ), but they're slightly more fitted than I'd have liked.<br />They aren't cropped, unless you're pretty long-legged, I had to hem them up to where I wanted them to be.<br />They also came with the smell of fake leather.  I hung them out to air and that helped.<br />I do like them overall, though."
4.0,Super cute!! Runs big so you may want to consider going down a size or two. I tied and belted the dress to make it work the way I needed it to. Satisfied with my purchase.
4.0,"Great sunglasses, very stylish however the gold rim rusts once it gets wet over time."
4.0,These were the perfect glasses for my son’s jungle theme birthday party. Only disappointment is that they don’t adult size faces. But perfect for the kiddos. Glasses are cute and are made well.
4.0,"Well made and everything fits well without wasted space.  Only negative is the case I received has a strong chemical smell.  I have been aggressively trying to fix that, but it still lingers."
4.0,White - extra small. I am 5'3&#34; and 128 pounds. Love Patty Boutik clothes but find many of them too long for my relatively petite height. Don't mind paying the somewhat high price - but then I get aggravated because I also have to do alterations to length.<br />Perhaps they can  start offering a &#34;petite&#34; option with shorter lengths.
4.0,"The dress is beautiful it was a little too big but I love how it looks on me, I’m hoping it will shrink a little."
4.0,I love the mask it keeps me warm in Burgerking drive thru were I work!!!
4.0,"Fit true to size, but material is very thin."
4.0,wife loved but the magnetic locks can come undone - she discovered they are magnetic not only to themselves but other things as wel and the bracelet came apart and she lost some pieces
4.0,Not really like the picture but it is still great!
4.0,The dress was very cute but the straps did not fit my back right.  They were high up between shoulder blades which made my back appear wider than normal.  I am an average size girl and this dress did not compliment me.
4.0,Fit great on my 6 month old. Would recommend!
4.0,"It's cute, husband has it decorating the cat food bin. He loves it"
4.0,This is a good product i have no complaints yet. Looking to see if the gold color fades or not.
4.0,"Nothing special, definitely not for Covid protection"
4.0,"Fits well enough but it plunges REALLY low with very little support in the front so I'll need to modify a bit,  and I'm still undecided on how I feel about the white around the legs because it almost looks like when you try on a suit at the store and still have underwear on under it.  But it's true to size and the quality is decent. Doesn't really hold things in like a slimming suit like the pic makes it seem it should"
4.0,"They were comfortable just standing, true to size, but too heavy rubber top. Felt heavy on top of foot. Gave them to my sister, as she liked them!"
4.0,"🌟Dress delivered about 3 & half weeks early🌟<br /><br />Nice Dress & I'm pleased with my purchase. The design is not exactly the same as the model is wearing but very similar. I ordered the XL. I'm 5'8 and 196 lbs. When I wear it out, I will definitely wear it with a body shaper."
4.0,"Me gusta porque cabe mi Mac 13¨ Ipad perfectamente, pero, hay una bolsa con cierre en la parte interior del compartimiento que dañaria al Mac, lo recomiendo."
4.0,"I don't know what to think of this.  I haven't worn a 1-piece since I was way younger...the leg cutouts are nice & high, and leaves some booty in the view.  I guess it looks good.  I just have to get used to the look.  Fabric is thick, but has that 80's sheen.  I usually wear xs/s.  I'm 5'4.  I was nervous about ordering a s because I'm usually 115lbs, but have my winter thickness on at 120-123."
4.0,"They are the only Peanuts jibbitz available, they fit my crocs. Only Sally's color is off, but I'd still say they are good for the price."
4.0,The colors were not at all what I expected. The blush colors is actually like a wine red and the gray is pitch black. It is still very pretty but not exactly what I was expecting. The fit is not really what I expected either. I ordered my true to size and wish I would have ordered a size up. It still fits but I have a big chest and so it fits a little tighter then I wanted. I am 5'1 and 160lbs with a DD chest.
4.0,"Dress is super cute but the leaf pieces were just falling apart on the first one. The second one is better so far but still, the leaf pieces fall off occasionally."
4.0,"I love this shirt! It stretches. It's warm and cooling at the same time. The only problem is the hem at the bottom. It's a little snug around my hips, but not uncomfortably snug."
4.0,"These sandles have a narrow footbed and loose strapes. I do a lot of walking and need a secure fit. Unfortunately, these are not suited for my lifestyle and work needs."
4.0,"It took a little time to ship. The material feels like rayon, but a bit thin so watch what you wear under the skirt. Fits true to size, maybe a tad big for me (I am 5’1 and about 116 lbs). I would buy again."
4.0,Its cute but i had to glue one of the gems back on
4.0,"They’re unlined so they’re not extra comfortable but the leather is tough enough to handle fencing and general rough ranch work for a couple of months before the first hole appears in a finger. The fit is fine, not sloppy and not constricting.<br /><br />Made in China, they’re not great but unfortunately a great long-lasting tough leather work glove is almost impossible to find nowadays."
4.0,Too long as expected
4.0,Pretty earrings. As expected. I have long hair and all my earrings seem to get lost behind my hair. These show up so well. Great size too.
4.0,The plaid is so cute for the holidays
4.0,"Although these run a little small, I still kept it as it shouldn't be loose fitting.  I purchased the size 14.  I don't like tight fitting clothing so I normally wear a L or XL.  This is form fitted L in my eyes.  Sleeves are nice and long.  Thinner fabric which is nice. Length comes down mid buttocks."
4.0,This is a well-made product at a great price point.  Super cute.
4.0,Cute but too large. I had to improvise to fit my baby's head.
4.0,"Good for everyday use,  durable"
4.0,"Received this product in a timely fashion.  This product is for those that want small quantities (i.e. one facility, one owner), for occasional use instead of daily use, and want to be able to identify or change description of key the tag is attached to."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:bc53240a9a9ea49e1b6387ad20991a0f]] The stones are beautiful. They sparkle like crazy! The “aquamarine” stones are synthetic, which is says in the description. HOWEVER, they are PLASTIC. I figured they’d be like a blue cz or something. Nope. They melted and one fell out already. And I’m about 10 days past the return time limit. I wish I would have just gotten the one without the aquamarine stones on the side bc everything else is gorgeous!"
4.0,"This sweater is very soft and comfortable. It’s a thin sweater, a little thicker than a regular shirt. It runs a little big. I ordered a small, which I usually am, and it’s roomier than my other shirts.<br />It’s very cute. Can be dressed down for a casual look with jeans or dressed up for going out with faux leather leggings."
4.0,love these pants wish they came in more colors
4.0,I am surprised at the quality. I have purchased many of these affordable sunglasses before as a kind of throwaway expendable pair. However the sturdiness of this pair has impressed me. Wish the tint was darker but thats really the only complaint I have.
4.0,wife used them to rap up gifts in them
4.0,these are good quality and really pretty pajamas but the elastic waist is too tight. I should have gone up a size...
4.0,God bless America!
4.0,Using them (right & left ear) for a Halloween Butterfly costume>  Nice quality and look more expensive than they were.  Very pleased with the purchase.
4.0,"It is heavier that it looks. Great for fall, not for summer. The lacy material is kind of scratchy, but over all a very well made, nice looking piece of clithing"
4.0,"Dress is very pretty, but it was VERY wrinkled when I received it. I was disappointed with the color too. I ordered light pink, but the dress I received looked orange. I ordered a large even though I normally wear medium simply because I saw it was Asian size and know they run smaller than US sizes. I'm a 36/38DDD and the large just fit in the chest area. So be aware of what size you order if you are well endowed."
4.0,"I like the shorts, I can do all sorts of activities in them!"
4.0,"Not sure I love these but I will get some use out of them. Length good, quality good. Just a little big for me."
4.0,im size 32 D and i ordered M is fit perfect.
4.0,"Lots of compliments and very warm, but this gray color had a very strong dye/chemical smell. Had to hand wash to get rid of smell. Be careful when washing, since it tends to fray very easily. Concerned that it may not last too long, but it's very nice to wear. MAKE SURE YOU HAND WASH!"
4.0,Fits description. I got this as a graduation gift and I love it! I just wish it was adjustable because my wrist is tiny. Worth the buy!
4.0,"Nice.  Peripheral vision is somewhat affected, though.  I do not drive in them.  Otherwise a relief for photophobia without over-darkening."
4.0,Fits nice not too clingy and very soft.  Very comfortable
4.0,"Great bag, a little smaller than expected"
4.0,"I liked how it looked, the only issue was the sizing. It differs slightly from brand to brand and this one was a bit too large on the sleeves. I had to return this because of that."
4.0,This shirt was a little bit bigger than most mediums I have worn. Material is great.
4.0,very cute and long enough for me
4.0,Material and color
4.0,"We love this skirt, but it runs so small.  I ordered this for my 12 year old daughter who is under 5’ and 75lbs and it fits perfectly."
4.0,"Quite gorgeous!  Seems a bit delicate, so must  be careful handling it."
4.0,This pretty top is a good length for leggings and a good weight for fall. I stitched up the front placket a few stitches for better coverage.
4.0,Nothing fancy but does the job very well for the price
4.0,The packaging was damaged somewhere during the long trip from China and the hat got wet. It had a musty smell and I had to wash it before giving it to my 91 year old mother in law for Christmas. It is a little big for her but really stylish! She looks adorable in it. She has very thin hair and the lining keeps her head nice and warm.
4.0,"this is a quality product -- just not for the stress I put on it.  I used two metal rods to support the end at 45 degrees, but ended up breaking that plastic clip in the free-rolling end.  I wil have to make a metal flange - or support it better.<br />  If you are just rolling it down - it works just fine for years."
4.0,I like this skirt. I was looking for a skirt that was longer because some are so short. It's very poofy but a great length especially for work/school.
4.0,I went according to size chart. It fit a little loose in back are. Wish it were a little tighter
4.0,"The ribbon tie thing comes off, but overall it's a great hat at a great price! It came folded, but I just shaped it and it fits perfect."
4.0,My granddaughter loves this jumpsuit but it is shorter than most size 7's and she is short for her age.  But it is a beautiful outfit..
4.0,"Handy and everyone liked their gift.  Tight inside, probably will loosen up as used."
4.0,Good quality. Fabric feels nice
4.0,The backpack says no leak but it in fact leaked when i used it for the first time. I took it to the beach and when i went to leave the ice melted slightly and it leaked out of the side. I didn’t even fill it all the way up with ice.
4.0,"I love these earrings, they are a bit on the small side of small - but this was not unexpected."
4.0,Earrings are beautiful and exactly what I was looking for. The only issue I have is that the hole for the backs seemed to be closed and if you try to force it you can bend the stem of the earring
4.0,"My family has a 5 acre pond and summertime we spend a lot of time fishing.  I'm usually the first one to cry UNCLE and got cop a squat in the shade because I can't take the sun in my eyes anymore and the top of my head is on fire.  So far this summer, I have been able to enjoy the shade in the sun. The first couple of times I was afraid the wind was going to steal it away and I'd have to watch it sink, but I prevailed.<br /><br />That cute little bow isn't simply a fashion accessory.  You can tighten it to fit your head.  When it arrived, my first though was &quot;This is way to big!&quot; BUT IT'S ADJUSTABLE.  Wearing this after that got a whole lot simpler for me. I enjoyed wearing the hat after that, too. I didn't have to chase it down.  I did that a couple of times while the men in my family laughed at me. But I'm too cute for a straw cowboy hat.<br /><br />The construction of the hat is surprisingly well made.  The wire is thin enough to adjust it anyway you want to adjust it.  The rim is large enough to give plenty of shade. The crocheted portion is breathable so you don't feel like your head is suffocating underneath the hat.  The stitching is even inside and out.  However, a bow beneath the chin would be a great improvement.  The way it is made with tightening the bow around the crocheted section may change the shape of the hat for people with a small head.<br /><br />Despite the fact that I was of to a rough start with this hat, I was overall pleased to have it. It's super cute and fashionable so nobody looks at me strange wearing it shopping in the mall.  So wether you're trying to avoid a sunburned nose or you want to look like a fashionista anywhere you go, this hat fits the bill.  I was able to to purchase this item at a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Runs a tad large. But super soft and looks great anyways
4.0,"these are so cute, the colors are vibrant and bold, very true to the pics shown!  unfortunately the small was too big and there was no XS so they’re getting returned.  I’m just a hair under 5’4 and 107 pounds for reference."
4.0,Works well for what I needed it for.  It arrived on time.  It is very durable.  I would recommend this to anyone
4.0,Nice colors but it's plastic not metal so kind of a let down.
4.0,"Fits well, does it's job"
4.0,I do love this beanie but mine doesn't really have the slouchy look while on. But good material over all and nice.
4.0,We bought these masks for our children. They seem more comfortable than the boxed blue masks available in most stores.
4.0,It is cut a little weird around the chest area so it's probably better for people who do not have boobs. The color of the flowers were not blue like shown they were purple but still a cute summer dress.
4.0,"Dress arrived quickly, I ordered a medium after reading reviews (5’3, 125lbs). The dress was a little big and longer than I would have liked. I still wore it for the occasion purchased and would order different colors in the future, but I’d get the small size instead."
4.0,"Worth the money, slow at delivery, was guaranteed a certain day then was notified it would be a couple more days , it took even longer, not sure who's fault but it was really late."
4.0,I was stunned by the way it fit her! Nice job!
4.0,Was a present for my daughter's b-day and she loves it!
4.0,they're not very durable electricity does not last very long they will break if you try to put too much in them
4.0,For the price I can complain but they do scratch easily and then they are garbage. It also gives off a rainbow color when wearing and it was distracting for my kids who play baseball.
4.0,I like how it fits on me.
4.0,"Very nice, however, these are not clip ons; they are screw backs, so my granddaughter  will not wear them."
4.0,"OMG!  How much do I LOVE this scarf!!!<br />  I am giving it four stars only because it may not be for EVERYONE.<br /> It is exactly what I expected, wanted and perfect for the event I need it for.  How practical it will be or how often I have a chance to wear it after that I do not know.  It probably deserves five stars.<br />This is a very large 100% silk scarf and it is just gorgeous!  I can't get over how beautiful and soft it is, how it just glides around my neck and feels so amazing. The possibilities are endless really.<br /> I was not thinking it would be this luxurious or well made!<br />And can we talk about the color?!  OMG. It couldn't be a more beautiful color of blue!<br /> I needed it to match a long dress I'm going to wear.  I. Do. Not. Wear. Dresses.  My standards were low when it came to something, anything to wear with it.  It has several shades of blue and this scarf just makes the dress even more beautiful!<br />The product is so well packaged. It came with a special cloth-like tote, a zip-top plastic bag and a (freebie) beautiful hand-painted porcelain pendant necklace. They seem to have taken a lot of pride in their product.<br /><br />I was glad to have a chance to purchase this product at a discount in return for me taking the time to write a thorough and honest review. I rely heavily on reviews written by others for my purchasing decisions, so I take this seriously and will update my review if my opinion changes. If you found this review helpful, please let me know below; I try to write reviews that will help others make informed purchasing decisions and I pay attention to your feedback."
4.0,"Very pretty.  I'm getting lots of compliments. One of little hanging things came off, but I was able to put it back."
4.0,they shoes where too big and they were very nice about having to refund me.
4.0,"Cool pendant but I’ll have to take it to a jeweler to have them put on a bale so I can wear it with my black chain necklace.<br /><br />The rope wasn’t attached , and the piece of metal they send with it is crappy.  It all fell apart as soon as I tried to put it together."
4.0,Runs a little small but still nice
4.0,"The cardigan is just like the photos and the color and size seem to match up. I usually like to spend less on a single article of clothing but decided the style, cut, and length of this cardigan was worth it considering that this is an Amazon Prime item.<br /><br />I usually wear anywhere from US 12 to US 16 depending on the manufacturer and I ordered size XL. This cardigan is loose and fit over my 39.4""/100cm bust, broad shoulders, and long arms just fine. I am 5""7/1.7m and I had no issue with the sleeves being too short, which often happens when I order clothing from Asian brands.<br /><br />I have just a few minor critiques:<br />- The sleeves and particularly the cuffs of the cardigan are narrow. They still fit fine over my arms and wrists but layering over bulkier items would probably be difficult. This is a shame since i will probably want to wear the cardigan the most when it is cold.<br />- The cardigan had a bad smell when it arrived. It mostly came out after one wash, however.<br />- The cardigan shed a lot in the wash and is pilling after that one wash.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy with this purchase."
4.0,It's a fairly decent necklace
4.0,Nice shorts.  Plenty of room in pockets.  Decent strength material.  Good fit.  Nice colors
4.0,"Beautiful, Very nice, thicker than expected."
4.0,I like these but they’re not really compression as I expected.
4.0,"Love the fit, quality, and style of the dress..the one thing I dislike are the puffy sleeves. Makes it look like you have shoulder pads? I’d only wear the dress with a cardigan or Jean jacket. (Ordered a medium to accommodate my larger chest.  I followed the given measurements.)"
4.0,This is such a cute dress and well put together
4.0,Very nice casual dress! Love it.
4.0,Not as large as I expected but still able to use. Bought them as a gift.
4.0,The color is beautiful but very hard
4.0,Seam along one side of dress is a little irregular
4.0,"Bought to wear for Memorial Day, Flag Day, etc.  I like it because it doesn't look like a Flag, which to me is more respectful."
4.0,"CADMUS Womens High Waist capri leggens W/pockets on side are very soft and comfortable. The fit is very flattering as it firmly tucks your tummy not squishing or squeezing you together. I appreciate the suggested variety pack, Thank you Cadmus!"
4.0,Happy with purchase.  Is as what it says
4.0,My granddaughter  really likes it-very pretty
4.0,"Fit as expected, material is smooth not clingy."
4.0,"Found this coat to be better in quality--fabric and stitching--compared to some others in similar price category. The only disappointment is the belt metal fastener is very thin, but appears okay (at least it is not cheap plastic). And, for those who care, this is not fitted strictly for feminine shape because it is pretty flat in front and back, but does fine when you tighten the belt."
4.0,"I've had this bracelet for a little over a month. Its a cute look and defiantely worth the price. Took a star off because it does not lay flat really but I still like it.<br /><br />EDIT"" broke after 3weeks not recommended"
4.0,"Didn't realize this was a SHEIN set. Quality is as to be expected from SHEIN. Cute set, but probably won't survive more than a few washes. The top is pretty short, more like a bralette — but that works for me for sleep and loungewear. Probably not worth the money considering I'm expecting it to start falling apart after I wash."
4.0,"Gave as a gift , friend liked it"
4.0,"Super cute!  However, the strap hooks are not the most secure and I worry that there may be a wardrobe malfunction- yikes!"
4.0,"Wife is size 8/10, 36DD.<br /><br />When you pull it out of the package, it looks absolutely tiny like it's made for kids, but the material is stretchy and lightweight.  Overall quality and construction are just OK; it would have been nice with softer material with a bit more weight.<br /><br />In white, it is absolutely see through so be sure you're comfortable with that!<br /><br />This crop top is a fun, sexy addition to your wardrobe."
4.0,Very comfy. Washes well. Stretchy. Runs large.
4.0,These sock are not quite no show.
4.0,Love this sports bra!! Will buy another one soon.
4.0,Quality charm.
4.0,Fine for brief wear with a Halloween costume.
4.0,"These, like most compression socks, don't breathe very well. They definitely keep a great compression throughout the day and make my legs not ache. I work in the medical field and am on my feet the majority of my work day so I put these to the test daily and they haven't failed me yet. The toe hem gets twisted a bit and I do have to readjust but what sock doesn't really if you think about it. All in all I'd say buy them! I got them on a lightening deal and am looking to get more at full price, which isn't bad!"
4.0,"The earmuffs are very comfortable and warm.  The down side is that they are huge!  Had I realized how big they were, I wouldn't have ordered them.  They are so big, they bottom of the ear muffs touch the top of my coat collar and then slide off my head.<br /><br />I think this is the new style in ear muffs.....I like the smaller ear muffs.<br /><br />I'm keep them because maybe I can wear them with a coat whose collar isn't such an issue."
4.0,"Fabric lovely, bought high waist for postpartum but a bit too small. I am larger bottomed with small waist though"
4.0,Super cute for roller derby. Comfy and love the galaxy print.
4.0,It's fine -- it'll work for what I need -- just wish it was shaped like the real oil can (oil can what? haha) from the movie!
4.0,Got it for a friend. She likes it.
4.0,Band fits and looks great. Just remember to get a separate bezel as the the original silver does not match the black band.
4.0,I appreciated the smooth transition with exchanging out the broken arm band. The color matched perfectly with the original watch face.
4.0,"Good for the price. I like the different colors, but the spring mechanism means that it closes all the way- so it will start to pinch after an hour or so."
4.0,"I got this for one of the girls for a photoshoot. The fabric is nice and soft. I needed to hem the bottom part, and after hours of running around, the buttons on the front became loose."
4.0,Yup! Smelled like armpits but I washed it now smells like baby powder
4.0,"Beautiful Ring, but runs small<br />I wear a size 7 ring, but this one (in 7) seems like a 6, I can't wear it, and will be exchanging it for the larger size."
4.0,It’s a good hat for the price. The material isn’t all it could be but I wear it to work every day and get a lot of compliments on it.
4.0,Appropriate for age.
4.0,"Good deal for the money. The pearls are good size and nice color, pretty round but with lots of surface imperfections. Wouldn't really expect differently at this price point. Recommend to add on with other item as solo Amazon packaging was not good at all."
4.0,These boots are so cute. They run small so go a size up if they have them
4.0,"It's a nice skirt, and I like the material.  It's slightly smaller and shorter than I expected."
4.0,Slightly off gold colour but ended up working well with my outfit.
4.0,"I loved the kimono robe and color, it fitted as expected, I am also hoping that  after a couple of washes it still continue to look good. Over all I loved it."
4.0,My only downfall would have to be that it's a little to long and I had to cut it.. Other than that it's perfect!! 💜
4.0,"It is a little small, but my wife will love it."
4.0,"Came faster than I expected after original arrival estimate of 6 weeks. I love the top is perfect for my small waist, but they they seemed a little short in the legs. Usually not a problem but it shows up with the very wide bell bottom seems more pronounced. They still cling to my larger than normal legs wish they didn't but its the type of material not the fault of the pants."
4.0,Nice cardigan. Ordered size M . True to size. Perfect length . Not bulky material. Arms are a little long but not a big deal for me. Love it. Thank you.
4.0,"So comfortable, soft and pretty, great price. Drop see thru even in the darker colors of grey and black."
4.0,"This is a very cute swimsuit. The top seems more like a casual regular crop top than a swimsuit, so it is very modest. Overall I like it a lot, but I am a very petite girl and it was a little big for me."
4.0,"For me,I think they’re a little short. But they work fine"
4.0,"Cute and good quality! However it runs small! I’m a size 00, 5’3, 95 pounds, and the XS Was way too small for me even though it says it can fit a size 0-2. Size up!"
4.0,Metal frame part is strong plastic pieces not so much
4.0,So cute and comfy! I wear it often.
4.0,Super comfortable.  Fits over my 9 mo pregnant belly comfortably.
4.0,"Gorgeous ring I would have give it a 5 star but turns out is is not -Adjustable ring is one size fits all.- as the description reads. So I would have to used it on my pinky. Just for reference I use a size 8 on my ring finger. Anyways the ring is beautiful and modern, very well crafted."
4.0,Nice dress. Great for summer casual. The green on the bottom is more of a blue green.
4.0,"I absolutely love this hoodie.  It has a unique design, but also the material is really soft and not too thick, so doesn't get too hot, but is thick enough to keep you warm.<br /><br />It has a big pocket on the front which is normal for hoodies, but actually preferred if it had two side pockets instead.  Overall, a great hoodie."
4.0,Not very comfortable but it really gets the job done. This will turn nothing into cleavage.
4.0,I really like this shirt. It is thin and not as long as I thought. But it is cute and fits very nice.
4.0,I love it. very nice bracelet.  But I had allergy from metal.
4.0,"My 9 year old wanted this watch for Christmas and for a kid its great. Colorful, trendy, and easy to put on. The biggest pain is trying to set the time and having to repeatedly reset it because the buttons are easy to push accidentally."
4.0,"Arm holes are a bit larger/wider than I had anticipated, but it will work over my bathing suit. Ill need to wear a cami tank underneath to not expose a side breast."
4.0,I would love to give 5 stars however I put them on for the first time and one of the tightening straps pulled off when I pulled.  Otherwise they are great!
4.0,Like the necklace but the ends of the bracelet tend to get in the way.
4.0,"These glasses are beautiful, however they much smaller than I expected. I haven't really wear them, other than when I tried them on. I was just expecting them to be bigger, they still beautiful, just not for me."
4.0,"so, i was very excited for these to come in. they came prety fast. but upon opening the box there was already a scuff mark. since i got the normal black, not shiney, i just touched it up with nail polish. it was still very annoying tho, so have to fix something brad new. on the plus, they are VERY comfy. they are a statment choice of boots. i would recomend, but dont expect to much on not scuffing, cause they do.. very easy"
4.0,"We got this for friend's daughter for Xmas and wrapped it up like a caterpiller.  She was thrilled.  Only thing you should you should consider.  Her wingspan isn't quite as wide as the butterfly costume.  But she'll grow into it in no time and in the meantime, they are just a little bunched up."
4.0,"Bought these for trip up to Maine, my fingers got cold after 45 min. Not much dexterity but did work with phone. If going sledding or skiing  I’d recommend mittens."
4.0,"Nice and good watch! The leather strap is a little too rigid, i have to keep it wrapped over a curve surface while not using to keep it curved and be more comfortable when its on the wrist."
4.0,Works well for food prep and chores around the house.
4.0,"Let me just say that this is a very flattering dress.  Not only does the wide (1-1/2&#34;) belt combined with the fit- and- flare skirt create a nice waist line, but also the bodice seam falls just underneath the bust, at the middle of the rib cage.  The illusion is a very beautiful hour- glass form, even for those of us who are less- than- perfect and non- hour- glass shapes!<br /><br />The capped sleeves are just adorable.  They are beautifully gathered and aren't too tight on the upper arm. (That is a problem I often run into with cap sleeves.) Once again, a flattering fit.<br /><br />The weight of the fabric of the dress is nice and summer- time light.  I look forward to wearing this in the heat of the summer when I want to look good and still be comfortable. The fabric has a nice &#34;stiffness&#34; to it, for lack of a better word.  I found this made it easier to steam (or iron if you do) than most light cotton fabric.  It seems to keep its form and not wrinkle as easily as other cottons I wear.  The covered buttons on the bodice are done well.  They look good.  The zipper on the left side under the arm is quality, can't be seen, it is sewn in well, and is easy to navigate.  It doesn't get caught in the fabric while zipping up.  That's a big deal to me,<br /><br />A word about the size: This is a dress for short- waisted women.  That is, if you are long- waisted, this is not the dress for you.  I'm just short all the way around, so although I'm not considered short- waisted in overall proportion, this dress is just the fit that works for me.  Also, if you are more than a C cup, the buttons WILL gap.  This means that it is a REALLY good choice for small- chested women because of the illusion it creates for that hour- glass figure with a perfect fit (no gaps under the arm pits because you don't fill out the chest area- we know who we are).  Lying flat, the measurement across the seam just under the bust is 14-1/2&#34;, if that helps.  Measuring one of your own tops or dresses this way may help you know the cut of this dress will work for you.  Another thing I want to mention about the size: the length is shorter than I expected for this 50s, vintage style dress.  I don't list this as a con, as this is a personal preference thing, but the measurement (again, lying flat on the table) is 17&#34; from the middle of the belt loop to the bottom of the dress.  It falls about 2&#34; above my knees on my shorter- than- average legs.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very glad to have this dress.  It makes a perfect addition to my summer wardrobe and I will also get a lot of use out of it in the spring and fall with a sweater (a bolero for sure, as I wouldn't want to mess up the perfect design for a flattering fit!<br /><br />This item was purchased at a discounted price in exchange for and honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Just another white shirt.......nothing special about it.
4.0,This bracelet is gorgeous and I love it. It fits wrists that aren't as small as most and its comfortable too
4.0,"I like the feel, not 100% on the longevity of the band or how it will hold up when it gets wet.  But I'm digging the quality of the band."
4.0,"I'm 5'6&#34; 182 and a 36 D. I bought the 3XL. The print is super cute. The padded cups are a nice touch in a suit of this price. I wish the cups were a little larger (they seem to be about a C or so) but they're doable for the price. I tried the suit on and the underwires started to pop out. So I took them out (and am much more comfy) since they were weren't doing much good anyway. I had some room in this size width-wise and probably could have done a 2XL but wanted the extra room for the bust area. That being said, the torso is really short. The halter neck, when tied, is stretched a bit more on me than I would like. If you're a tall girl, this might not work for you. There's no shape wear like in pricier suits but the pattern and ruching are very flattering. For the price, it's a fun suit to lay out in."
4.0,The material has too much polly and is to warm to wear in Florida in the summer.
4.0,Such a cool hoodie<br />Very soft and warm<br />Runs a little on the large size but overall nice
4.0,"A little on the small side, but SUPER soft!!! It just gives me more incentive to lose so they aren't so snug!!"
4.0,"I ordered this cap for my Son, He works at the Ski Area....He shows it off every day....He loves it. Thanx, Allegra K. ... Great Job !!"
4.0,These earrings are very unique and cute. They don't hurt my ears and can wear them all day. The only issue I have is that one of the rhinestones is off a bit and it makes it look like it's falling out.
4.0,The fabric and style was good but the way it was design wasn't flattering. It was somewhat large from waist to down and small from waist up.
4.0,The glasses are very fashionable.<br />They should be delivered in a case of some sort.
4.0,"The pants fit fine, if long, but the tunic was snug for me as a short, plus size woman. The tabards were velcro to the shoulders which is fine as long as you're not doing a lot of bending/twisting. This costume strikes me more as jedi formal wear than regular clothes.<br />The tunic has only one tie on the outside made of thin ribbon, which is too weak. The material is sweat inducing after a while, and some will find the texture too rough. The waist piece and belt were both too small on me, but secured well with double velcro. The gold center piece of the belt comes undone, but there is no where to put pouches on it. All in all: i should've ordered a size up, and this is not made for LARPing. More for conventions or other passive, indoor events."
4.0,Very thick clothes and pretty.  The price is great.  Good for office and church. Fit a 5'2' and 140 lbs. I recommend.
4.0,"I loved this suit. However, I a bit long waisted so  even in a large (and I usually wear a medium) it was too short in the body for me."
4.0,Really cute socks! My husbands is a huge Astros fan and loved wearing these to the office
4.0,I like this bag. It has a weird odour though and the handles seem to be made of a less sturdy material than the rest of the bag.
4.0,a little tighter than you would think from the picture. but still stretchy enough to be comfortable.
4.0,Really cute but only complaint is that I ordered two of these in Rose Gold and they both came in Yellow Gold.
4.0,I like the size and how it hangs= it's a perfect length! Looks great!
4.0,"I liked these sandals very much, however they felt and looked like they were too much oversized. they certainly felt comfy"
4.0,"Fits small, I ordered 2 sizes up.  Asian sizing I think.  I wear a 10-12....0rdered largest they had.  Great color and cute design."
4.0,"The hat is well made and the size fits as expected.  The brim is stiff and rather large.  The brim seems to be larger than in the picture.  While it folds pretty flat, it is a large diameter hat.  I'm not sure that it would fit in a carry on bag -- I haven't tried that.  I bought it for traveling, so I may have to either wear it or pack in my suitcase."
4.0,Great print; the shirt is ok
4.0,"Personally, I really like these suspenders - great quality, feels good, makes me feel good bc I feel like I look good.<br /><br />HOWEVER, my wife says the leather looks fake and doesn't like them. Hence, deducted one star bc my wife's opinion matters. Good quality though. Be your own judge :)"
4.0,Looks great on the Watch
4.0,IT IS OKAY BUT UPSCALE/
4.0,This is gorgeous on its real lovely .......got a tonne loads of compliments when I wore this piece.......shipping was faster than given date in amazon update.....will definetly recommend
4.0,"Great watch, offers both military time & regular 12/12 hour day times, and has an alarm.<br /><br />Minus 1 star because i wasn't expecting it to be small, and the light button is decent. But those don't affect the performance of the watch, still a good buy."
4.0,"Wiliw footless black tights.  These are great tights and I really like that they are footless. They are slightly opaque but not actually see through. Great for under dresses, scrubs, and long tops. I would not suggest someone wear these without a really long top to cover your rear end. Definitely dont bend over unless said top also covers your rear end completely. I am 111lbs 5'4 and I recieved the size small and they fit great. They are controlled on the top and have a decent light compression. They stayed up without sliding down my legs during work. The 2 pack is a great deal and the quality is good. Soft material and good fit. Great black footless leggings."
4.0,Perfect fit cute. They just sent the wrong color.
4.0,Replacement piece for wallet
4.0,DIJERON QUE LO ENTREGARON A UN RESIDENTE Y NO FUE CIERTO LO DEJARON EN EL PISO AL LADO DE LA REJA
4.0,"I agree with the other reviewer that the folding sticks (don't know the term) have a cheap kind of texture; however, there is a sturdy metallic rod inside of the material lining the sticks, and the rest of the product seems to be of decent quality. Also, I can confirm that they are polarized."
4.0,"Not aa big as I thought they would be, but they are super cute and flexible metal. I've slept with them on and they stayed on! Very pleased."
4.0,pretty but not as big as i thot.
4.0,"Beautiful swimsuit. Fit nicely. The red was sexy. But the material was so thin, you could see every bump and crack. It wasn't lined in the rear. I would have been embarrassed wearing this.  I had to let it go back. I wish it was a thicker material, not transparent. I would have kept it."
4.0,"I like these socks but for the life of me I couldn’t get them on, to save my life, giggle.  I had to return them.  Well made and look really cute."
4.0,Cute product Fair quality but the arms are very small so even though my daughter's only normally in a 4T the arms are still too tight for her.
4.0,Cute! They are little thin but they are good for the price! Larger frames in person than they look in pic
4.0,Shrank slightly in the wash.. however I ordered a size larger just in case
4.0,These are the silicone version.  I have a lot of leftover band to have to deal with. Super pretty. Just wish they gave the option for a petite wrist
4.0,"Fun bag, should fit my laptop and should be sturdy enough to hold the laptop."
4.0,"I love the look of these frames. I saw them on AHS last season and fell in love with them so I searched high and low and of course I found them on Amazon. They're costume frames so it's just for looks, not for function unfortunately, but they are really fashionable."
4.0,Very cute outfit. My daughter is 2 1/2 years old so I ordered a 2-3 years size but it was way too small. The seller fixed my issue immediately and resent a size 3-4 per my request and it fits perfect! Recommend ordering 2 sizes up.
4.0,Like the dress and the color. It fit as I expected though I was hoping for a bit more loose in the middle. Hoping it doesn't shrink when I wash it.
4.0,Kids love the magic!
4.0,Bought  as a gift. Wish I could have found in original white in his size.
4.0,"Nice, but smaller than expected.  Should be listed as a mini tote."
4.0,Beautiful ring but its not true to its size. I got a 9 because that's the size of all my rings for my ring finger. I can get it on but its so tight. I live in a humid climate so my fingers swell often and it leave imprints and I have to take it off.
4.0,Nice shirt! Maybe a little thin but not terrible. I usually wear a size L or XL and this fits as expected.
4.0,This suit is really cute on!
4.0,"beenn having em fo a bit. Good, hard quality and nice look. Would recommend."
4.0,It’s a super cute dress. Fits perfectly. Only giving four stars because it is a little thin and kinda swimsuit material but still comfy and cute nonetheless
4.0,"These are very cute but are a little tight around the waist. I'm 5'8&#34;  150lbs, ordered a large. The length is fine, not terribly short, but the waist band doesn't stretch very far. Still, they're comfy band cute enough I'll wear them"
4.0,Well made. Would have liked a bit Mrs space
4.0,"Love these, very comfy, very inexpensive, a little long in the legs but not a deal breaker for me."
4.0,Thank you for getting my bracelet  on time. My retired friend  loved it so  thanks for getting to me.
4.0,Very comfortable and easy to wash.
4.0,I love !...looks it cute to my baby .
4.0,This product has held up well so far. With keychains I don't have many expectations but this seems to be made well.
4.0,It’s super soft. Kinda weird that it’s white on the inside. Not a typical tshirt material.
4.0,Even though I received it 2 days later - UPS didnt find my street ( crazy) - I received and it is good!
4.0,"These are lightweight, not quite the real thing. Good for costumes, ok for keys, but can be pulled off with a good sturdy pull, so not super reliable if you’re carrying your keys or riding a motorcycle. This does have a nice look to it, and it evokes a biker image. It is good for casual weekend wear with denim as well as for costume parties.<br /><br />I received this item free of charge and this is a fair and honest review."
4.0,"Normally a size 18, I could have gone down a size but choose to wear a belt rather than exchange. Also too long for 5.3 height. They are really nice pants for snow. Stretchy and soft exterior, waterproof without the loud swish sound of ordinary snow pants. Also the fleece lining is soft and warm."
4.0,"Very nice leggings. The material is very soft and silky, they feel comfortable though feel one size smaller.<br /><br />The only minor problem is they barely reach my ankles. I think they might have been half an inch longer.<br /><br />Other than that, I am pleased to have them."
4.0,Love it! Comes handy
4.0,"Shipped fast, accurate description fit perfect."
4.0,"Very nice, good fit."
4.0,This is a beautiful and comfortable sandal but they were a little too large. I am an 8 1/2 and these did not come in half sizes so I bought the 9.  I gave them to my daughter in law and she loves them.
4.0,Worked very well. Lots of room for full skirt. Material is somewhat sturdy but could rip if were punctured.
4.0,I divided the charms between my 2 siblings as a Christmas gift. The charms are fun and can be gifted to a wide age range of children.
4.0,Cute style. Won’t be super warm though.
4.0,Well worth the money.  Very pleased. look sturdy and should wear well.
4.0,Shirt fits Great on the stomach area but a little tight in the arms
4.0,"Very cute and love that it’s adjustable! However, the finish does come off easily as you wash your hands. The stone also fell out. Very cute, just not high quality."
4.0,"It is so cute, soft & comfortable. I will have to purchase some leggings to wear with it, though, because I feel it's just a little too short to wear alone. I am 5'9 and it made me very self conscience."
4.0,"Very thin fabric, but a nice and comfy shirt and I wear it over a sports tank."
4.0,"Looked great, felt okay - a little small."
4.0,"Love it! Bought the tank top to wear while working out; bought a size up to make sure I had room to move. (XL) Not as baggy as I expected, but still fits good. There’s stretch to it."
4.0,Great shirt. A gift for my brother
4.0,the dress is pink like the Pepto Bismol not as the colour in the picture other than that it fits well
4.0,Love them even though putting the little ball on is really hard. So I just don't put it on
4.0,Like it a lot. Fit perfect
4.0,"Omg! I use to get so many compliments when wearing this cover up. It is so comfortable and lightweight. It dries easily is it get wet. I will be giving it 4 starts since the string started to get untied after the 3rd wear. It still works, but I have to cut the loose strings now.<br />UPDATE: The tassels are completely loose. Delicate wash!"
4.0,Seen a little tight and made kinda cheap. But you get what you pay for. Otherwise they are decent
4.0,Bought as a Christmas gift. He loved it
4.0,"These slippers are well made and comfortable, but run large- length and width. I would suggest ordering 1 size down, if you have narrow feet, they run wide."
4.0,"run too small ,,I have fat legs too hard too put on.."
4.0,Hi quality costume
4.0,Its ok and its warm. Only one problem. You dont have size 14
4.0,I love the fit of the dress. Very stretchy material that makes the dress form fitting and sexy. My only issue was that the dress was shorter than I expected. My shoes were showing too much as you can see in the picture. I am 5ft.
4.0,"I was looking for a waterproof bag for pool visits, or if I forgot my umbrella on a rainy day.  I can say with certainty that this is certainly waterproof.  It also has a shoe bag on the side, but it can be used for other things (in my case toiletries and clothes.  In its folded state, its good for my small electronics, wallets and charging cables.  It could a little more cushioning at the bottom though."
4.0,"These shoes are very comfortable, I will be buying some more."
4.0,"Is great product,,very good very happy customer..."
4.0,"Love this hat - but it is pretty snug. That’s the reason I subtracted one star. I wore the hat for about an hour recently and took it off and the inside band had made a dent in my forehead that lasted several hours! It hadn’t done that on other occasions, so it was probably a crease in the band, so I’ll have to be careful about that next time I wear it."
4.0,Nice dress and Good material.
4.0,It is an ok gym shorts
4.0,Love these earrings-BUT they appear very blue and not at all crystal clear. Still very pretty though.
4.0,"i ordered two, one from “prettoday” (spelling might be incorrect) and this one. bought this one in a medium and the other in a small. they both use the same pictures to show their product, but this one is a deep color and also runs very tight, and is not as flattering as the other one when put on. i took a picture when i tried it on but it wasn’t flattering so i didn’t save it.<br /><br />i will say, however, i like the color better this one comes in because i like darker reds versus orange reds, i think it would have worked if i had gotten a large.<br /><br />like i said i would recommend this shirt more since i like the color better, however it was too tight and it’s just weird both sellers use the same pictures but have different products (different colors and texture of shirt, see picture)"
4.0,"Much cuter than I thought would be though smaller, too. I was nervous about it fitting, but it worked out great."
4.0,"Fabric is nice and fits well, the wrap connection needs a little help but not bad. No buttons or zip easy dress to get throw on with no worries"
4.0,It's alright but is a lot bigger than wife was expecting  a little flashy for her
4.0,I really like my new cheetah print Snooki slippers a lot! They’re nice and warm and soft on the outside and inside too. They have some cushion under the sole of your foot. I broke them in quite easily and they’re not too snug. It is kind of tricky to get used to walking in them but after a little while you’ll get used to it. Also these particular slippers do not have a rubber sole or sneaker tread of any type.
4.0,Super cute sunglasses for my daughter's first trip to Disney. Only reason I gave it a four is because the one side doesn't stay closed. Otherwise we love them!
4.0,"I bought this shirt for my husband to wear to work.  The pattern looked really nice and I thought I'd give it a try.  I was impressed when I took it out of the Amazon box.  This shirt came carefully packaged like a dress shirt that can be found in a nice department store with a stiff collar, pins and all. The pattern and color was exactly what I was expecting.  My husband tried it on and it fit just as a medium should on his somewhat thin frame.<br /><br />I'm giving this shirt 4 out of 5 stars because the fabric is a little thinner and stiffer than you would find in a department store dress shirt packaged the same way. That aside, I think it's still a good value given its price here.  I think this shirt would be perfect for a wedding or special event because it is vibrant, polished and sharp and it seems that the color/pattern pictured is accurate so you know what you are going to get.  I don't know how many wears we will ultimately get out of this shirt but it at least looks great and is holding up for now.<br /><br />I was able to buy this shirt at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Fits like I hoped it would.
4.0,This is a gift hope they fit
4.0,"Order a size up. I ordered a few sizes up because I was going to a concert and wanted to have enough breathing room, but for regular shirt use, one size up should be fine."
4.0,"While I really liked the print and the style, the manufacturer suggested buying a size larger than what I usually wear. However, that advice was not the best for me as it was much too large."
4.0,"I’ve been looking for a water, wind proof and good looking ski jacket until I found this one. It satisfied me with meeting all of my expectations but truth to be told that if you wear it for skiing, you have to add an insulation as layers inside to keep you warm. This makes more troublesome for me. Also I think it fits me well with Size M except for too long sleeves because I have straight body of 5”5 and 140lb. If you are curve, it might be tight on breast and hip. Overall, I just love the fashionable style and color and ignore its deficiencies 😂😂."
4.0,"I love it, I'm 5'7 tall and I select a size M, perfect."
4.0,Received what I expected.
4.0,"Cute print. Pricey, but bought them from lands end on sale for my daughter’s and needed the matching set."
4.0,I loved the dress and the fit. I did have to get it altered on the bottom and cut a little of the lace to make it look it even. But overall I was satisfied with the fit and look.
4.0,It looks great and fit great I love the sliders on the loop to adjust it but as stated in the other review it isn’t cotton but more of a silky  material and I’m wondering if it’s going to be very hot to wear
4.0,"i got a small and liked it but beware this material will shrink. im 4'10. 135lbs and before wash it was a tad bit long, like dragged just a little. after i washed it, the dress shrank and the length is just right. however i was hoping it wasng going to shrink"
4.0,filter somewhat difficult to install. Edges and corners tended to not lay out flat.  Not instructions for installation included. People comment positively.
4.0,"My son always orders these for his Wushu practice and competition which he does fairly seriously .  He's going through a growth spurt so they don't last long since the difference between sizes doesn't seem to be that big.  However, he likes the design of the treads and lightness of the shoe.  I've ordered these through here a few times now and am always surprised by how fast they arrived.  I think the expected arrival date was about a month or so in advance but I received these in less than 2 weeks!  This time we were missing the laces which was no big deal for us since we have so many outgrown pairs to take from, but still annoying."
4.0,Nice and soft just a little longer on me than pictured.
4.0,"This dress is actually a little on the large side I’d say. I’m 5’9” and 168lbs and Im usually a large but I ordered a medium in this dress because a review I saw had a girl similar to my size and build in a medium. It fit alright around the waist and the chest isn’t “loose” per say, it’s more that the dress cuts a little  lower than depicted and there’s just a little too much fabric around the area that covers your boobs. The fabric has a nice texture and doesn’t seem cheap which is awesome. *** Note I got the beige dress with the red flowers and the dress is actually like a dusty pink with red flowers. Due to this the red clashes with the pink a bit, but overall it’s still super cute and comfortable. ALSO THE POCKETS ARE GREAT!!"
4.0,Its cute though it runs small. I followed what the descriptions say about sizing but still a bit skimpy on me despite of its a plus size clothing. I will be returning it for an exchange of size only.
4.0,"The 1 thing that  bothered me  was the package  it made the coat very very  wrinkled  , I  had to wash it  line dry  and air dry  to get  most of the wrinkles out."
4.0,I wore this to a wedding and rec'd multiple compliments on it.  the only thing I don't like is that it gets little white color like balls on it where the spandex type stretchy stuff breaks when the dress is taken on and off several times which I did to try on various undergarments to make sure they looked right before wearing the dress to the wedding.  all in all I would purchase it again and will be wearing it to our work Christmas party.
4.0,Too long but nice dress. I resized the length since I am petite.
4.0,Great design but a little too tight after awhile. Was left with marks
4.0,"So cute with lots of high end touches.  The round neck closes in the back with a keyhole closure.  The sleeves have gathered cuffs with  tri-fold layering of sheer fabric, such a pretty and feminine touch.  There are embroidered flowers on the shoulder and again on the opposite hem.  The bottom falls below the waist line so this blouse is flattering on all body shapes.<br /><br />The garment is machine washable but I'd hand or towel dry.  Very pretty."
4.0,Great except this weird sash thing that came on it. We ended up cutting it off. Very nice.
4.0,I purchased a Large instead of an XL so I gave it to my sister. Which she loved. She’s about 5’2 and 140 lbs.
4.0,Very nice slipper. A half size bigger would have been perfect but a whole size up would have been too much.
4.0,"The butterfly broke within days but the bracelet I still wear them every day, I never take them off I shower with them it hasn’t change color I love them but wish the butterfly didn’t come loose"
4.0,"(Stephen’s wife) Other than being a little loose in the waist, these shorts are great! Good quality, quickly dry and comfortable for lounging, working out and long walks (aka COVID-19 quarantine friendly)."
4.0,Runs very small and tight if that's to your liking. Normally wears small returned for Med and not sure this will be big enough for her. Cute tee looks comfy. Bought for a gift. Made well nice design.
4.0,loved it but somehow lost my damn hat lol
4.0,"this might not quite be one size fits all, my tall thin frame stretches it. But, it fits well enough to look amazing and feel fairly comfortable. Love how sheer yet tight it is, definitely enhances the look of the body in a creative way. I'm not sure how well it will hold up with active use, but that's how it goes with anything nylon."
4.0,"The blouse is very nice, I am happy with it."
4.0,"Very cute and well made dress.  Disappointed in the fit at the top- def. need a cami under this dress if you want a modest neckline. Other than that, a great buy."
4.0,"The pin itself was beautiful, but the packaging it came in left much to be desired.  Spending $74 for a pin, I would have expected it to be in a pretty box, suitable for gift giving.  The description page said it would come in a nice signature pouch with artist's signature.  It did not. It should have been packaged more carefully & in a better container.  It was simply in a thin plastic baggie & then in a very thinly padded envelope.  I can hardly even call it padded, it was so thin.  It could easily have been crushed or bent, there was no protection whatsoever!  I'm surprised it made it okay, as it was delivered the same day along with a heavy box.  I ordered 2 other pins on Amazon a few weeks earlier, one from Richapex for $45 that came with a gorgeous gift box & that was inside a 2nd box for protection. Another from Alilang for only $15.99 in a beautiful gift box, also inside a very thick padded envelope for protection.  So, you can see why I was surprised with the way this much more expensive pin was sent.  Again, the pin was gorgeous!  I had already picked out quite a few more pins & other jewelry from this company for gifts for my family, but won't be ordering them now.  It's a shame really.  Such amazing quality & talent, but no care taken in mailing or in presenting them in gift packaging, suitable for giving."
4.0,"First of,Im a guy. I bought this for my wife as a birthday gift. And i searched these kinda wallet locally (Malaysia Outlets)<br />they kinda selling these wallets overpriced! about rm1k !! Although is not the same design but still is overpriced here.<br />i hope my wife loves this big size wallet. Can anyone tell me is this wallet very new or old stocks ?<br />4 Stars for now :)"
4.0,I got the wrong size
4.0,"I'm giving 4 stars. Quality is good, material great, super cute. I got the U.S. 12 but the bra part did not fit, it was too small for a C cup. It's push up but more for a B cup.  The way it's sewn I can't take out the bra part without unseaming the other parts, so I won't.  However this is my opinion because My boob size are different, overall it's a great swimsuit, just boob size isn't accurate."
4.0,"I wish its a bit longer but other than that, I love it!"
4.0,"Recently got my SB Sox Lite. Unfornately I have a torn meniscus in my right knee. I personally never owned a pair of compression socks. I work in building services for over 16yrs. Standing nearly 8hrs a day, 5 days a week on granite or marble floors. It will take a toll on your joints sooner or later. In any case, I worked with an elderly gentleman that had to wear compression socks. And I remember how annoying they were for him to wear. I thought it be the same experience for me. But after wearing the SB Sox Lite Compression socks. Wow! They are not at alI over bearingly tight. I wish I had made the purchase earlier. Thank you SB Sox for making your product enjoyable to wear."
4.0,I can’t buy sets as I need a bigger bottom that top. This fits well and doesn’t make me feel fat. I am 5 7 about 165
4.0,"Very pretty dress, unfortunately the cut of the material around the bust does not cover well at all. Its like extra material thats flappy, and just waiting to flash your goodies to everyone. Returned it."
4.0,These earrings were very pretty! they looked beautiful with my outfit. Very neat and elegant for the price.
4.0,"This is a classic blazer. They've added rolled up sleeves for a more casual look, which is nice.  Well designed with nice material."
4.0,"These appear to be decent quality, but I ordered the black and white ones and what looks like white in the pics is actually silver, which gives them a girlie look."
4.0,"Very cute, but slightly bigger than I was thinking, but very good for keeping my  face out of the sun.  I like the neck protect also."
4.0,Great fabric It ran big so I could have gotten a large
4.0,"I like it, is the same I saw before on this web, Id but it again"
4.0,This is very soft and comfortable. It is one one piece of fabric so it is thinner then some other neck gaiters. But fast shipping and exactly like the photo.
4.0,Very cute! My 18 month old loves putting them on by himself.
4.0,Great item at this price. Looks and feels like original band. Already plan to purchase this band again in a different color.
4.0,Very decent quality.  Be careful removing the neck tag as I ripped a hole in mine.
4.0,"Cute, thin but needs a belt to avoid a dowdy look."
4.0,The shirt is adorable. Soft material. Stretchy. I ordered a 2XL as that is what my friend stated that is the size she wears. It looks smaller than a 2 xl. I wear a large/xlarge and tried it on and it fit snug.
4.0,The colors are great but I’m pretty sure I got the small band instead of the large even though my order says large. I have never had an issue with any watchband before but this time it’s on the very last notch and I don’t consider myself to have large wrists.
4.0,"The only complaint I have about this bracelet is that it fits my left arm, but not my right. So, I will wear it on my left and not my right."
4.0,These glasses are very cute for the price. They are a bit larger than they appear online and the gold frame is a very yellow golden person.
4.0,good but made with cheap materials
4.0,This is very soft lace and beautiful style. Ordered a medium because Amazon recommended that size based on others around my size. Returned that one and ordered a large. I wear a 34F bra and the large barely fits. Have to use largest hooks and have some side boob bulges. Not uncomfortable though and since it’s for a sleep bra anyway it works.
4.0,The dress is Beautiful it didnt look faded. I would give it five stars but a little tight at the top. I thought about sending it back but i will keep it. The material is soft fabric
4.0,I originally bought these in 1x as that is the size I normally wear but they were too tight. They I ordered in 2x and that is perfect for me in satin.<br />Note to others - size up when buying satin panties
4.0,"This runs a tad bit small.  I wear a small, and ordered a small, and I'm happy with it, bit if I were chestier it would be too tight.  The design is awesome.  there is a dual pocket system that allows for hand warming and storage separately.  The color is somewhere between gray and green.  The length is perfect, hits low hip.  This is a versatile weight for cool to cold temps."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:d5e98be9b415c8e0cf1b8814b7cff2b8]] Fit as expected (I got small but a medium might have worked a bit better--I'm 5'6"" and weigh 140lbs). Cute color, but could use padding because I'll have to wear a bra underneath. Definitely a nice layering piece and easy to pair."
4.0,...and it travels very well.
4.0,like it  very much
4.0,This boltcutter seems to be very good quality except it is quite dull.  I think they forgot to sharpen it before assembly.  This also seems to prevent the blades from closing fully at the tip.  They work for my purpose cutting deep in the throat of the tool.  I think it would be hard to sharpen at this point without drilling out the rivets and disassembling the tool.
4.0,"Great sweater for the cooler weather with the fleece lining on the inside. I order several in different colors and the color, size, and fit holds up wash after wash. Really great value."
4.0,"Love how it fits, love the color and the length is just what i needed."
4.0,Only have one complaint ..... it wrinkles way to easy.
4.0,I love this shirt! It is perfect length for leggings. I received several compliments. It has been washed twice and holding up fine.
4.0,"Fabric a little scratchy at first, but after a few washes is softens up."
4.0,"They look nice, but I did have some issues with the ball unscrewing under my shirt and falling off randomly.  Fortunately it only ever happened at home and each time I hear it clack onto the hardwood floors so I was able to retrieve it and screw it back on."
4.0,I have tried other wallet and keys. After about 3 or 4 months the key attachment breaks off the wallet. So I decided to try a metal attachment. Will see how it goes.
4.0,Its a mask. it covers your face.
4.0,"Perfect solution for those who have to talk, or sing, or need to wear a mask for an extended time."
4.0,These are awesome.  And for my prekindergartener who love school she absolutely loves thes bows.
4.0,Love this ring!  Get lots of compliments.  Well weighted and love the positive message!
4.0,"Liked the dress, it is somewhat small."
4.0,"I knew full well when I got this it was going to be too small but I had to have it.  I am 5'2 198lbs and a size 14.  I got the largest size that they had, which is a L.  If you are a size 8-10 the L will fit you perfect.  It will give you the flowy billowing look.  On me it just was too tight in the arms and there isnt any stretch whatsoever.  It is constructed really nice and I like the tie detail."
4.0,I did like it as a whole. I did not dislike anything.
4.0,Quality was good but a little large for size
4.0,"Cute top, I liked the style and the shoulder pads weren't too much for me. The bodice itself was too long and I couldn't wear with a lot of my jeans bc the leg opening would show.  So I had to return."
4.0,It fit as well as expected. Does wrinkle easily.
4.0,"Does what it needs to do but compared to other Zulu straps I own the nylon was a bit corse and the hardware seemed a bit cheap. Also if your wrists are any bigger than 7.5"" this could be a little short on you"
4.0,I am 5'1&#34; and weigh 93 lbs with large C cub breast. This top in large fits me a little tighter in the chest than I am comfortable with. Due to my height the length is perfect and I own several of the Kavio styles. Kavio is a good brand for petite ladies who don't want a top that goes below their butt. I don't think anyone other than a small petite person could wear this top. Perfect for tiny ladies.
4.0,I was satisfied with everything coming packaged very well. However I gave this review 4 stars over all because the leotard was very tight to get into and the zipper didn't wanna zip up. I eventually was able to get into the outfit but it was a struggle. Also with the belt part the gems that were on it fell off right away as you see in the next picture so they were not glued on very well.
4.0,"Nice bag, good value"
4.0,made for a very small wrist
4.0,A bit on the smaller side but the fabric does stretch out after wearing it for a while!
4.0,These are super cute. But they are 2 different materials.
4.0,All good but the metalic coating on the clips to the gear started showing some wearing after only a few days
4.0,Nice blouse but a little too large
4.0,Thigh measurements listed are spot on.  If I had to do all over again I would have bought leather chaps as these textile chaps melt when they come in contact with the exhaust.  One thing to keep in mind.
4.0,"More sheer than in photo, but nice fabric."
4.0,"Its pretty nice, but its a little bit smaller than it appears in the picture."
4.0,The charm is small and you have to look close to see the &#34;niece&#34; but she loved it and that is what matters.
4.0,Item was just as described and are very pretty.
4.0,I like the necklace but the writing (I love you more) could of been a little brighter
4.0,The product was exactly as described. I took my chance with random colors and three out of six were hideous. I will give them away . Still worth the price as long as you like 2 or three bracelets
4.0,Reached before the specified time ..it's lovely set but smaller than expected.
4.0,"Use for factory work, fit well."
4.0,"This is a great garment made of very sturdy material. Unfortunately, this fit too big. I’m 5’4 110lbs and ordered size 34 (I’m a 34B cup) but it was huge. I will be returning this."
4.0,"Purchased as a gift for someone. In the picture, it looks much lighter, almost like a beige; but upon receiving, the sweater is more like a dark peach-tan color. Little disappointed, but not going to return."
4.0,"I have been wearing these underpants for a few days & sleeping in them at night. I was wearing boxers since I was a teen (almost 30 years) so going back to hugging briefs was an adjustment. The last times I tried this style they were either too tight in the waist or were form-fitting enough that an observer could tell my religion. The waistband on these has not caused any trouble for my sensitive digestion system and are not overtly form fitting. Sometimes the legs are a bit tight and will pull the waist down when I bend down. The parcel area is generous (for me) and keeps things in place.<br /> ""Awesome 360"" is printed on the waistband. You might think that is Totally RAD! or you might not appreciate the word ""Awesome"" on the garment that is covering your bits. These shorts don't have a slit in the front so urinal activity takes two hands to maintain zipper access.<br /> My wife likes the look of these so I like them. They have been comfortable to wear during the day and at night. I do miss the slit as anyone who wears a tucked shirt will."
4.0,Very nice skirt! Only issue was its red not burgundy.  Very well made.
4.0,Great band. Seems good quality. The color didn't match my iwatch5 otherwise I would have kept it.
4.0,To small need xxlarge
4.0,The fabric is very nice but it is a little sheer. I will wear a bodysuit under and a pair of tights. Cute to throw on and not have to worry about putting together an outfit. Would look cute with cowboy boots and a scarf.
4.0,Picture made me think it was silver but is actually more gold in color. Still nice value for product.
4.0,"Good t-shirts, I wear them at work (garage). One year later they are still going strong."
4.0,I love my veil! It's just what I was looking for. I like that it comes with a comb too! Can't wait to wear it for my wedding!
4.0,"Runs on the smaller side. I’m 5’10” and wear a 12. Ordered the XXL and it fits well. Fabric is thinner than I would have liked but can easily be layered over a tank for added warmth. For the price, this is a cute shirt that will pair well with skinny jeans/leggings and boots. I ordered the gray with plaid sleeves, I assumed their was black in the plaid, it’s actually navy."
4.0,Picture is not perfect. But I love it.
4.0,Its ok. Hasnt stripped. good leather.
4.0,"i have been using them for a week and so far, they work well"
4.0,"Loved everything about it except the fact that the under arm elastic was a bit too short and kept pinching me, making my armpit sore by the end of the day"
4.0,"Glad I read the other reviews and ordered up. Shirt is made well and fits great since I ordered a 2 sizes larger than needed. Washed really nice, too."
4.0,I purchased these slippers 10 months ago and they were my WFH kicks! Had them in the summer and in the winter very comfortable all year long - well 10 months of it. Today the sole blew out a 3” hole on the right. I’m going to buy another pair - just wished they last a little longer - but maybe I just got a bad one. Yep - right price and that comfortable..
4.0,"The product is good for children but don't expect quality material, one of the slippers has stopped popping up after only a few days."
4.0,"It's much heavier than I expected, and I actually ended up cutting one of the chains off after the second wear to lighten the weight. It actually made the belt more versatile, oddly enough. However, the quality and durability are a plus, and I enjoy matching it with my outfits."
4.0,"Very nice but i had to take out the pearl bead because it didnt sit on the ear flat, but still pretty without it"
4.0,"Holds passport, money, cards. And looks decent, nothing fancy just does what it needs to."
4.0,A little too tight for me so I wish it was a little adjustable but otherwise if it fit it would be good
4.0,Great product.  They're not made for big guys like me tho.  Had to give them to my kids.
4.0,"Although this product is geared towards males, I, as a female thought it looked pretty neat and purchased this for a 4 day getaway to Florida.  The bag arrived on time and the material seems durable and nice. Exactly as expected from a canvas bag. Given this, however, one side of the zipper was obviously broken. The zipper struggled to zip on onside.  Although this is the perfect size for a carryon, I could barely fit all of my clothes inside. This is not a bad purchase for the price. I will be using this again."
4.0,Was a gift for my grand son like this
4.0,a liitle problem with time fix but get a lot of complemnt about it
4.0,I liked the feel of the material and the fit. The color was slightly too dark. The wedding was canceled due to Covit 19.<br />I will be returning these when I can.
4.0,"Love these, they fit great and have excellent compression and they are very comfortable. There is good stiff compression that does something rather than just feel snug. I have a serious size stomach roll that needs attention and these did a good job reducing it.  However, they are not suitable for all dresses as claimed, the shaper sticks out past the hem on my leg on mini dresses and some of my thigh length ones as well. Legs are 6-1/2 inches long.<br /><br />There is a double fabric layer above legs around the tummy with 4 bones at the top edge that work perfect to keep the top from rolling. The fabric is knitted in one piece then a 3.5” gusset that runs from leg hem to leg hem is sewn to the knit to complete.  Legs seams are thick, not finished very well and they don’t stretch as much as the fabric.  Fantastic 4-way stretch in the knitted 82% Nylon, 18% Spandex fabric. It stretches to more than twice its length or width (230%). Leg seams only stretch to about 160%.<br /><br />I got the XL/XXL by using my waist size. For reference I am 40/36/39, 6’ tall and 187 pounds. Fit is excellent. Based on my flat measures and the chart body sizes the XL/XXL has roughly 40% negative ease.  You could go a size up for less compression and maybe a size down for extreme compression.<br />Recommended body size/ flat dimensions: Waist 32.5/21.5= 151%  Hip 37/2x13.5= 37/27=137%<br /><br />Construction: There are several issues that prevent these from being perfect. The printed label is awesome however part of it is already coming off and I haven’t washed them yet.  The leg seams are sewn at the end poorly and have a lump of thread and fabric. The worst problem is the hems are plain wrong.  The fabric is rolled under and sewn over the roll leaving a raised line around the legs that show thru lighter weight dresses.  Normally a cover-stitch hem is sewn such that the edge of the fabric is flat with a line of stitches on the fabric double layer and a single row overlapping the edge.<br /><br />Overall: Good shapewear that works to smooth bulges and lumps with some overall reduction. Terrific comfort and super stretchy fabric that stays in place. Sewing could use some improvement.  I would buy again."
4.0,"This is for my daughter to wear at work. She is petite, so it is a bit on the larger side even with adjustment. She likes it."
4.0,I like how there are different colors I also like that I did not have to buy each size separately
4.0,Feels good but on the large side. Will probably order another one but one size smaller. Don't see any short sleeve sweat shirts. Difficult to tell actual color.
4.0,"Adorable, but these seemed to run a little big compared to other brands in the same size. Had to return and go with a different shoe for school."
4.0,"The shipping was quick and the produce was as expected.  My daughter is 6 and maybe she's just tall, because it seems to be on the small side."
4.0,"Good quality, size detailed"
4.0,I was so excited to find this type of show at such a great price!!  At first when I put them on I was a little disappointed. I noticed when I walked that my feet was slide off of the side of the shoe and on the the ground.  After a while of wearing them my feet more or less formed to the shoe and I no longer have that issue and can walk great in them!  They are super comfy and I get all kinds of compliments on them! Great deal and would definitely buy more in other colors!
4.0,"Great swimsuit! Over the course of one year, I lost over 75 lbs. In about a month, I'm headed off to volunteer again at a camp for kids. There's a lake and an opportunity for swimming. And in the dead heat of July, it'd be pretty nice! I have not purchased a swimsuit in years and I'm very pleased<br /><br />QUALITY<br />Pretty good. There doesn't appear to be any frayed seams, previous use, or stains (etc). It came in great condition<br /><br />COLOR<br />I'd say the blue is a tad bit lighter in person than what I see on my Macbook monitor, but I still love it. it's navy<br /><br />FIT & SIZING<br />I'll give you some of my measurements to help you better decide which size will be right for you<br /><br />Usual size: I'm somewhere bordering a US6 and 8. I sized down due to stretch, and due to the fact I have some more pounds to lose.<br />Underbust: 32 inches<br />Bra size: DDD (So a 32DDD)<br />Waist: 29 inches<br />Hips: 40ish inches<br />Weight: 155ish, 5'6&#34;<br /><br />So I'm very much busty in the cup region, and have big hips. The bottoms fit me beautifully. They could definitely accommodate someone smaller than myself (the swim trunks do stretch), but I did not find them uncomfortably tight on me. The cut is very flattering.<br /><br />So, here's where I detract a star. I love the fit of the bottoms but the top is just NOT big enough for me. It fit me just fine through my underbust (and it has adjustable straps, so it could easily accommodate someone smaller/larger), but my breasts are dangerously close to popping out. Again, I'm a DDD, so this is a part of normal life. However, other reviews I've read on similar swimsuits stated a top like this could accommodate a larger cup sie. I would recommend against getting a medium if your chest is greater than DDD. The triangles of fabric are really just not enough<br /><br />DURABILITY<br />I haven't had an opportunity to use this swimming, but I did wash and dry the suit and it turned out just fine.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I'm happy with my purchase! I do wish the top were bigger but that's a general complaint of mine no matter the size. Otherwise the suit is comfortable, flattering, and will hopefully hold up. If I have any concerns about the durability of the product, I will be sure to update my review..<br /><br />I did receive this item at a discount in exchange for my review, BUT I did not allow this to influence me. I think the product did earn four, not five, stars. It's probably not the best suit for busty girls (especially since you cannot mix and match tops and bottoms), but I'm so glad I picked this as my first swimsuit in about 8 years. :) Please let me know if you have any additional questions about this suit!<br /><br />UPDATE:: I bought a different bikini top from Target (D/DD) and that fits WAY better than this top. If you are very busty, definitely search for a different top, or forego this suit altogether. The bottom is SO cute, though"
4.0,Love the print on this dress and also a good fit.
4.0,"Very comfortable - and showy - one pair tore shortly after wearing it - but the retailer gave me a refund, no questions asked"
4.0,Very well made and beautiful but too small. My daughter just turned 6 and she is on the smaller size and was too small for her.
4.0,Colors were much brighter than pictured.
4.0,Got the wrong and still fit. Keeping it!
4.0,"Thick fabric, well made! My brother in law loves it"
4.0,Quality is not the best but for the price I paid it works fine :)
4.0,"Too big, we returned them. Ordering a half size down in the toddler sizes."
4.0,"It's big, but i can work it. Not the best quality but I love the faded colors; definitely unique."
4.0,Nice watchband with magnetic closure. Pretty strong closure with wide range of width. Good value
4.0,"Colors are beautiful, they are smaller than I had in mind but I’m keeping them! Very pretty!"
4.0,"This dress is true to its size, I will recommend this dress."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:a90e4bed214c446572accb24f38b866a]] I love it but it’s hard to breathe in
4.0,"Los zapatos son hermosos pero un poco rigidos, no se si porque son nuevos pero estan un poco incomodos, pero son hermosos"
4.0,"I love the color of these earrings and how they look, but the only thing that bothers me is the backs don’t stay in that well, but other than that, amazing product!"
4.0,"It is a nice design great for the beach; however, the sizing is very small.  A US Large should order a XXL or larger depending on bust size.  Also, mine shipped from China, so returning is generally cost prohibitive because the item is not very expensive (return shipping can be costly)."
4.0,I love my shades!!!! They fit perfect and I would know bc I collect sunglasses!!!!
4.0,"After looking at various shoes in the ""bone"" and cream family, I took a chance on these.  I had a pair of pants that I was trying to match.  There is a very slight blush tinge to this bone colored flat, which is what I needed.  I had another pair of shoes in this brand and style, so I knew the size 8 would fit.  It does, but it seems slightly smaller than my other pair.  I might consider going up a half-size."
4.0,"The case is good, but pretty large.  I guess it needs to be that large to protect the glasses, but it takes up a lot of room in my purse."
4.0,"Nice, soft good looking scarf"
4.0,I love the dress just a little tight. order a size up
4.0,"I liked this watch, but the strap is pretty short. Had to give it over to my wife. She loves it, just not for me"
4.0,"I love the confidence these leggings give me when I wear them! They worked for hiking, going to the gym, and running. These did not fall off my body when I exercised. I am 5'5 and 220lbs. I bought XL but I probably could have fit into a Large. They pass the squat test as well! (Also the tik tok hype is pretty true. These make your lower half look fantastic) My only complaint is that the material is a bit itchy even after washing them multiple times."
4.0,Good quality unders
4.0,Awesome material but I couldn’t fit a lg. Suits vary needed an XL
4.0,"Beautiful dress, but it is a bit large on me."
4.0,"Runs small. I bought this as a gift for a friend who is normally a size Large. I ended up having to return it and buying a 3x, which now fits great. She loves it, and the color is beautiful."
4.0,Liked the style and colors
4.0,"This dress is fine, a bit thin. Fit as expected."
4.0,Very pretty but was very small. did not fit at all. but was still a great quality.
4.0,"I love the earring, but sometimes I have trouble keeping it attached to my ear if I move around really at all."
4.0,"They're very lightweight, very cute, sturdy, and perfect for gifts!!"
4.0,"Nice hat, served its purpose well. It is a bit larger than size would suggest but that worked in our favor. Read the reviews, order your size accordingly.<br /><br />My only complaint is the stupid sticker on the too rim very front. It was large and very stuck. It left a sticky residue when removed. Very frustrating and company should rethink it’s design.<br /><br />Overall nice hat."
4.0,a lot thinner than I expected but its is still nice and fit is good!
4.0,Its a cute hat. It was a little hard to adjust to make it smaller. I would not buy another one but I do like this hat.
4.0,Satisfied customer!
4.0,"I don't like that the wheels are out all the time, wish you could retract them. My son enjoys them so far but it is definitely hard to learn. I do like that you are able to take the wheels out and put a plug in but wish he was able to retract them when he doesn't want to use them. Will be interested to see how they last during the wet winter months. The quality is high."
4.0,"I really like how the helmet looks but after about 30 minutes it leaves a red imprint on my head & it is very uncomfortable. However, I usually wear it because it is worth it for how well the quality of the product is."
4.0,"Very nice and soft.  The non skid lumps on the sole are a bit hard to walk on, but they make good bed socks."
4.0,Great jacket but runs real small! Recommend ordering a size up!
4.0,"Nice board shorts. Colors are exactly as pictured. The full waist line strap is a smart concept. The only issue is the only pocket rests just outside your right knee, so anything you put in the zippered pocket bangs against your kneecap. Keys, cell phone, etc.. does not feel too good!"
4.0,"I am 5'3&#34;, 120lbs and ordered a size S which is a bit lose around the arms/neck. This may be good; however, because the fabric does not stretch. I wore to work and everyone loved it. Plan to wear it to upcoming car shows with my 1963 Dodge 330."
4.0,Frames were slightly loose.
4.0,"I like the bracelet. It is stronger, thicker metal than it looks. Chain is a good size for your wrist. The reason I gave 4 stars, because it looks very different than the real Van Cleef. Of course it worth the price."
4.0,"Fits my 7 month old perfectly. She is in 95%+ in height and weight and this was perfect size (24"", 23#). Bottoms also allowed room for swim diaper. Material is nice and light and dries quickly."
4.0,"Love these! High quality but hurt my ears a little bit- NOT for those with sensitive skin, they are not hypoallergenic!"
4.0,"I bought this bezel for a coin that was not QUITE dime-sized, so the fact that it doesn't quite fit is on me. (It does well enough until I can afford to have something custom-made). It still does what it's intended to do, and looks quite nice. My one warning is that it's nearly impossible to open unless you have an eyeglass/jeweler's screwdriver handy. I didn't, and had to borrow one from a neighbor to get the bezel open."
4.0,"I like these glasses, but have not worn them much yet. I'm waiting for some more sunshine so I can get more use out of them.  Love the looks though!"
4.0,"I can't run in this because it's pretty loose on the straps but decent around the underline of the bra. I'll probably just use it for low impact hiking days, gardening etc.<br />Also, taking the phone out is easy but putting it in the pocket is kind of hard. It's also pretty limited on space. I wouldn't recommend anything bigger than LG Aristo."
4.0,I CHOSE THE WRONG LOWER READING POWER
4.0,As shown in photo
4.0,I like this skirt and would have been loved it had it not be too small.  I received this item for free for an honest review so it came in an 1X which is great because looking at the sizing chart that's about a size 16 and I'm between a 14/16.  Well to see that this fits like it's a 12 is an under statement because it was really tight.  Don't get me wrong I liked the stretchy material (it's a little on the shiny side) but would nice in any setting that you wear it in. I wish it was a little bit bigger...sigh!
4.0,"Love it! Fits perfect like many wrap dresses do, except it gapes. Like major gaping. If you're busy at all, wear something underneath."
4.0,"Material is too thick for Summer, Otherwise love it! Seller should use a lightweight linen material for Summer. This hat is real cute. I bought it for golf but will wear it in Winter while shopping."
4.0,Super cute and well made hat.  But it’s very small! It fits my tween and not me.
4.0,"Very cute for a date, lunch or a day out with friends.  I like the pattern and colors."
4.0,"It worked how I expected but was pretty small, I have a big head though so I’m pretty sure if you have a smaller head then it’ll fit fine"
4.0,Rounded edges were like a step up to me... Then I realized how easy they fall out with rounded edges... The tree of life one is still probably one of my favorite pairs of guages tho... Until I lost one :(
4.0,"This item gets a ratings boost from the manner of presentation. Very pink drawstring bag contains some unexpected goodies included with the necklace. The drawstring bag itself is very nice: Nicely constructed and very soft material. The additions include a pink polishing cloth and a thoughtful gifting card (also a nice company card) The necklace is enclosed inside a very nice jewelry box with a hinged lid. It's a presentation box that you might expect for a premium piece of jewelry.<br />The choker/necklace is pretty, and well made. The 14k gold plating gives it a nice luxury sheen. The chain is thin, giving the choker/necklace a delicate appearance, which complements the small circular pendants. This can be considered a dainty, elegant neckwear...not a large gaudy piece.<br />Overall, for the cost, this is a very attractive and appealing necklace. Might be too late for Valentine's Day, this year, but if with this necklace as a gift, any day can be Valentine's Day.<br />Attached are photos to illustrate comments in this review, and show real world aspects of the product. Ruler shown for size reference.<br />This item merits high level recommendation."
4.0,Russell hooded sweatshirts are well made.  Delivery on time.
4.0,She has worn this actually for a couple years now. it is durable and fits well.
4.0,"I wish I could give this too 5 stars. Unfortunately, the cute ruffles in the arms were done in such a way that it was too tight. Once I removed the stitching and cut the elastic out, the sleeves fit perfectly. So, no more ruffle sleeve, but the top now fits great. I wish they had made the sleeves wider instead of just putting elastic on a normal sleeve size. If you don’t have big arms, you could be okay with this. For me, the tight sleeve is the reason it lost a star. The shirt is lightweight and the color is perfect. I’ll definitely still wear this."
4.0,"Initially a five star product until I washed it. I bought a medium and it fit really well (this was before the size changes from some merchants so no idea what the medium equates to now) When I'd hand washed and air dryed though it shrank about 2 inches all around the torso part. Guess it is an incentive to lose more weight. Lovely dress whilst you can wear it though. Bought the blue and the black versions. Very flattering, comfortable and cool."
4.0,"Flowy fit is nice and comfortable and it hides midsection curves nicely.  Beware, however, because of the decorative pattern, it pulls very easily.  It catches on everything.  I’ve worn it twice and it already has several pullers."
4.0,Great for a wedding ! Good fit as sized
4.0,Fits as expected but super thin.  You can see through them at the knees when you bend your legs.
4.0,I was a little worried when I order it because the pictures showed two different closures but I am extremely happy with my purchase. It’s so pretty and my iPhone 8 Plus fits perfectly. I gave it four stars because it was delivered to the wrong house. I would totally buy another if it came in another color!!
4.0,Fits great! Very adjustable. Completed my look very well.
4.0,"These were quite comfortable. I felt that for the price, they were pretty good."
4.0,"Fits pretty good and feels good. Just a tiny bit long in the back as it folds up a bit on the back of my neck. Other than that, it's perfect"
4.0,Cute. A little shorter than it appears
4.0,"Very pretty evening bag at a great bargain. However, I only gave it 4 stats because the color is not what I expected. It is bright yellow gold. I needed something gold but more subtle. I'm keeping it because it matches a pair of heels that I have but will need to buy another bag to match the shoes I wanted this bag for. Glitter does not rub off."
4.0,"I had some trouble choosing the right size; I went for large and they are loose, but as others say, I kind of like that; different and clever, fun to wear around the house or a quick trip to the P.O. box."
4.0,"I saw this posted on a FB group I follow and had to have it! It came very fast and was kind of shrink wrapped. The main part of the material feels really soft like a kind of fleece or something. The color patch isn’t quite as stretchy as the fleece, so it tugs just a little across the front. I like the diagonal snaps, but it would be tight around my neck if I snapped them all up, so I leave at least one open. The “collar” part took a little getting used to - it doesn’t really fold down, and if any snaps are unbuttoned it’s awkward to try and fold the flap over. I don’t really care for the cuffs - there’s something about the material and stretch that doesn’t suit me. Regardless though, I really do like the top overall. The cozy factor trumps my minor complaints, and none of the complaints are a deal breaker."
4.0,Handles broke
4.0,"I have gotten a lot of compliments on this top.  However, shrank a little bit first time I washed it.  I used warm water, not very hot at all, and I dried it on a hanger."
4.0,Its very cute I really like it. Very comfy for a long walk doesnt hurt my feet at all.
4.0,Nice and light and fit perfect.
4.0,Amazon suggested I order a medium. I didn't. I ordered an xl. It was still too small.
4.0,Just got it today. We'll see how it holds up. But very pretty
4.0,It is a big blousy tee-shirt. It is perfect for working out or lounging around the house. It was a good purchase.
4.0,Love this skirt!! I bought a medium size and it fit perfectly!
4.0,"Beautiful but it came broken, I put it together very easily though"
4.0,Lobe the box that they come in..one broke already but so.what. .I have pelnty more to go.
4.0,The necklace is of the quality that I expected and came in a timely manner.
4.0,"The graphite color is GREAT!  Love of the pop of pink color.  Construction is solid.<br /><br />I purchased this bag as an alternative to all my heavier leather bags.  Unfortunately, it's WAY too wide for me.  Hanging on my hip (using the cross body strap) it added over 50% of my body width.  Again, I say, GREAT bag, try it if this style works for you.<br /><br />One of the biggest cons for me though was the weight.  I wanted a lighter bag, and this was lighter, but by no means anywhere as light as a LeSportsac bag (I think this is due to the hardware), which is what I ultimately ended up switching to.<br /><br />Now if only LeSportsac used their styles and hardware) with the Baggallini fabrics!"
4.0,My little one tried to sleep in them... solo cute...
4.0,"After the below incident..i REORDERED SMALL GREEN AND ITS ABSOLUTELY  BEAUTIFUL ANF FLATTERING ! THINK THE BELOW WAS JUST BAD LUCK ..AND ORIGINAL PATTERN I ordered WASNT AS PICTURED..GLAD I GAVE IT ANOTHER SHOT..<br />I wanted to love this dress. The dress pictures a  fabric ""belt"" at the elastic waist. The dress was not only missing that but the button loop was broken as well. If I were to give this dress another shot I'd order a small.. because it was too open in bust/ armpit area. Medium fit well everywhere else with room to spare...however without being able to cinch the waist tighter was a bummer. Wasn't too pleased with pattern.. looked nicer in pics."
4.0,"A bit on the large side. You get what you pay for, not a licensed product, but still is OK. My friends love it!"
4.0,Zipper is weird otherwise very pretty
4.0,"My adult son finds this jacket amusing ( I thought he would ).  Just the thing to wear when hosting parties in Brooklyn.  It fits well enough but like many clothes marketed to Americans these days it has ample room for a large belly, which he doesn’t have. I think it looks great on him."
4.0,I use these to wear over my kn95 masks strictly for decorative purposes. I love the variety of colors. My only complain is how loose they are but otherwise pretty functional.
4.0,"I got it for my wife and she like it, she said ""wow, how did you know I wanted this"", obviously because I listen to her. But I digress, the only problem I have is that I think it looks better online."
4.0,The length was longer than I expected but it was a problem that took little time to correct to my satisfaction.
4.0,Just purchased and used for a week. Too soon to judge but seems very sturdy and size is exactly as stated.
4.0,"The strap is adjustable but there is nothing stopping it from slipping. The strings to tie it are cheaply made and aren’t very long (us size 4-6- the bow in the back is barely bowable). However, they are nice and light. Waterproof!"
4.0,"I really love this swim suit.  I would rather not post my measurements on Amazon, so we will just say I went by the size charts and it worked.  The swimdress is actually two pieces, which I wasn't sure about with three small children in tow to the pool.  It actually works out well, doesn't pull in the wrong places when I am carrying a kid and all the stuff that goes with us to the pool. It has removable cups, which don't provide much support, but conceals what it needs to.  The tie on the back does however provide more support than I expected, so that was a plus.  I received a discount for my honest opinion, I took on star off for the lining in the bottoms needing adjusting after washing."
4.0,Many pockets to place your stuff
4.0,"These glasses are ok. With this product you essentially get what you pay for. They are cheap and will probably only last me a few months at the most. I bought the 3 pack and within the first week 1 of them already started to peel the color film.<br />I have them for about a month now and they are holding up ok, but as mentioned all 3 of them have some minor scratches, or are peeling, so extra care is needed with these.<br />I am not dissatisfied with the purchases, as they are not expensive. The only thing I don't really like about these glasses are that they are rather large in size and from the nose pegs to the top rim it just has a lot of space. The proportion basically just seems a bit too large in my opinion, and no I don't necessarily have a small face..."
4.0,Looked really nice in person.
4.0,This is a nice wallet .. i bought it for my mom and it has a lot of room even big enough for her phone to fit
4.0,Love the non removable pads.  36c ordered a large and it fits good.  They’re kind of cheap looking but just ok if you’re not looking for anything special.
4.0,"The pants are super cute.  They are very long on me but that's expected because I'm super small.  People say size up but I think you should order your regular size because it has a stretchy waistband in the back. The material doesn't look like the picture, it's more thin and flowy.  Overall they are super cute and flattering."
4.0,"Took a chance of ordering these pants as I know most run pretty small. They arrived very quickly! The fabric is thinner than I anticipated but they are actually very nice and will be perfect for spring/summer! I’m a little on the curvy side and got a large. They do fit nicely! With the elastic waistband it doesn’t choke my waist or have any rolls. A little shorter than the pictures but I’m also taller than average, they’re a nice float capri for me. I would purchase again but move up one size (5’9 200lb 30in waist)."
4.0,"Nice robe, but definitely for spring/summer coverup. To lightweight for winter."
4.0,Runs small need to add 2 sizes I’m a 38 and x large is small - fits very tight
4.0,"Eh they’re cute but one came broken, and the stick isn't even in the bag so I can’t even fix it. Sucks! One less to use. Lots of markings and chipping on the lollipops too."
4.0,"Very nice hats. The only complaint I have is that I had to put them together; but I can't really complain about that since I'm sure shipping them put together had a greater chance of they getting damaged. They hard slightly tricky to get together, BUT I'm glad I purchased them. They look very nice and can't wait to see my daughter and her party guests wear them!"
4.0,So cute. Just as expected. Very happy with this purchase
4.0,"A little bit brassy as opposed as gold tone but still really nice set, disliked the packaging felt too cheapy besides that good set good price!"
4.0,"These earrings are super cute! The only reason I give them a four star rating is because the back does not seem to go on very securely, so I worry it may fall off. I plan to remedy this by getting some cheap earring backs and hot gluing them to the back side of the earring."
4.0,very comfortable fit but a little tight on the crotch
4.0,Used these as covid masks. They r thin and dont offer much protection but your voice isn’t muffled in these. Its easier to talk and they are very comfortable. I use them for quick trips. I just double the fabric over my face and loop it around my ears instead of pulling it over my head.
4.0,I’m 5’5 150lbs and I order a medium. The fit is perfect and they are sexy!!!! The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because I had to lace up the pants myself which was a little annoying.
4.0,"Got my 6 month old daughter so is on The smaller side, delicate, & elegant looking..."
4.0,Definitely as advertised.  Wide spread and quality look.  Very nice.
4.0,dress isn't a bright red like the pic
4.0,Excellent price. Nose pads break pretty quickly though. Weak design.
4.0,Good for costume
4.0,"The shoes are so cute. I ordered for my 5 year old niece...unfortunately, I ordered the wrong size. I returned them but will probably reorder in the near future."
4.0,Great for the price. they even have springs on the hinges and they are good quality.
4.0,"It ALMOST fit exactly as needed. But I didn't expect it to be perfect, especially because I am categorized as petite. I am 5'2&#34;-5'3&#34;, chest 34A-34B, and my waist is measured 29&#34;-30&#34;. I selected MEDIUM because a few other reviewers with similar height and measurements chose this size and I am so glad I chose M. The only area that did not fit me exactly was the chest area (it went a little big), but it's not a big problem to get that altered a little bit. Other than that, with some heels, the length of the dress is perfect (a little bit above the floor). There is lining in the dress (not see through) and the fabric is thick enough to be winter appropriate. The fabric is also stretchy (so you can enjoy a meal and a few drinks) and the material does not irritate my skin. Very nice multi-occasional dress AND under $30."
4.0,Bought them for my daughter. She loves them. Good deal for the price.
4.0,It is very nice looking. The only problem I have with it is that the smaller stones are so small you can barely tell what color they are.
4.0,"Love this as a shirt, definetly not a dress, not where close to a dress but fit very well as a shirt.  Good material."
4.0,Otherwise a nice dress.
4.0,"I wore this dress to an outdoor summer wedding and got lots of compliments! It flows well and the color is beautiful! The only issues are that it’s a little big around the waist. I ordered a large due to my chest being big and wanting fuller coverage (34E) but my waist is more of a medium. So realistically, it fits as expected. It’s also a little short, so if you wear wedges or heals they’ll show."
4.0,Smaller than I thought but still fits all my essentials Also my smock and radio for work.
4.0,"Nice suit if you don't want to show all of your &#34;assets.&#34; However, I am very tiny (I sometimes wear girl's clothing) and this is quite snug on me. I fear if I gained a pound it would be too small (plus, I like to breath, even at the pool or beach)! Size up one size or you'll be sorry."
4.0,the color is vivid and it fits perfectly
4.0,"nice glasses, heavy duty."
4.0,"Just what it looks like. Light weight nice for Spring, Fall, cool Summer days and Mild Winter days. Would not count on it for warmth on bitterly cold days, but good all around stylish hat."
4.0,"These are my daughter’s second pair of Babiators and she loves them! They are stylish and have the benefit of being polarized, which is great for the healthy of her eyes.  I love that the sunglasses come with a 1 year warranty but we’ve never had to use it since my daughter hasn’t managed to break her glasses-they’re very durable! I wish the sunglasses came with a polishing cloth but other than we are very pleased."
4.0,"Stiff and heavy, otherwise I loved it."
4.0,Came quickly - a little flimsier than I expected but the 7 year old I gave it to loved it!
4.0,It’s beautiful and very comfortable to wear. It is a little long in the back but I’m just going to hem it. I love it
4.0,"The best thing about this t-shirt is the print both the tie dyed background with the sun and moon print looks really chic. The only thing is the material could have been better, better in the sense a bit thicker and softer."
4.0,The gown suited its purpose but it was on the thin side. You could literally see right through it.  My daughter wore a very sparkly dress and you could see it. Oops!  We didn’t try it on until the day before so it was too late to get another one.  You do get what you pay for and this was a good price for the gown so if you do get it plan accordingly.
4.0,Absolutely beautiful!!! So brilliant and sparkly. Great with that black dress for the wedding and even going out for dinner in the evening.
4.0,I ordered this for a ringleader costume and I’m very happy I did. It is better quality then expected and fit just right. I did pay an arm and a leg for expediated shipping but it showed up five days earlier then expected .
4.0,I liked everything about it. Fit just right. Wore them for every day use.
4.0,They would work better on a younger child 8 to 11 range.  Ordered for grandson that’s 13 & he is not a big kid.  Was just too small for him.  Still all masks are just too hot for us to be wearing in the south.
4.0,So beautiful. So many compliments. Im 5'7&#34; 132 athletic. Bought a Medium.<br />Fits great
4.0,"Quality shirt,"
4.0,It’s soft and cute but did smell funky when it arrived. I’ve washed it and the smell was gone and it’s still just as soft and cute. Held up well in my not-so-gentle laundry load.
4.0,Fits well and she walks fine in them compared to other. I will buy the next size up when she is ready :-)
4.0,My 10 yr. old niece loves  Converse Hi tops and was thrilled to get  this purple color. No comment on arch support cause Im not sure.
4.0,"Was shorter than I expected, but when I looked at picture again,<br />I saw that it shows it is a shorter style shirt."
4.0,"Gave these to my wife.  At first, she really didn't wear them, but I've notice she now wears them almost everyday."
4.0,Have had the belts only a few days. The plastic buckles are a worry. There doesn't seem to be any stretch. The belts are rigid!!
4.0,I like the dress.  It fits good and the quality of the material is great.  A lot heavy than O expected which was a good surprise.
4.0,"I really like this belt. The color combination looks great with jeans or with kaki pants, it is stretchy, so it never feel to tight or too loose.<br />It does stretch with time; it will probably last 3 or 6 months of frequent use."
4.0,"Haven't worn them all day yet, but they are really beautiful and straps are comfortable. My husband loves them on me. I have a feeling I might need a little pad under the ball of the foot because the material feels like it might stick a bit or cause some friction. But I do that with most of my shoes anyway so not a problem here."
4.0,"I'm 145lbs, 5f 4in tall, 34DD.  I ordered a large.  It fits nicely.  Item came wrinkled and the only care instructions on the tag are &#34;dry clean recommended&#34;.  Looks really cute with leggings."
4.0,Nice looking but they could have been bigger. The beads do not look like 8 mm at all. The earrings are so tiny and do not seem to be an appropriate size for an adult woman.
4.0,"These are definitely much smaller than a 00. I could size up probably two times. Other than that, they are perfect. They are lightweight, look great, smooth and the color is beautiful."
4.0,Love the look and the dress pockets fit a little awkward on my hips
4.0,"This set of 8 pairs of earrings is semi-glossy black, and includes 2 post sets while the rest are ""hoop"" style with a small wire that clicks into place. The black layer that's been plated onto the steel does scratch off *fairly* easily, so try not to scrape at them with your nails or any rough items for cleaning. That said, I've only noticed this as a problem on the dangling point set and where the wires click into place, so you shouldn't have too much issue with this if you're not being violent with them.<br /><br />These earrings are a little on the bulky side, coming in at ~1/8"" thickness compared to the 1/2"" size of the round (outer measurement, inner is ~1/4""). The wire on these is also a little on the thick side, but fortunately it's not so thick as to cause pain in a normal sized piercing. I think that because the gap for the wire to go through your piercing is a little under 1/4"" wide on the 'hoops' some folks with thicker ears might have trouble with these, but they fit alright in my own ears.<br /><br />Some of these earrings are more fussy to put on than others, and that's probably just slight variations in the way they're manufactured. While most of the 'hoops' click easily into place for a secure fit, a couple of them require a little extra push for a second louder ""click"" before they're truly secured; I didn't realize this the first time on one, but the wires are sturdy enough that it still stayed in place even though it had come open on my ear. The barbell style have a finely threaded screw-together function, and the standard pin-style earrings work as normal.<br /><br />I am quite fond of the different shapes that are offered here, particularly the triangle 'hoops' and the dangles. I am slightly let down by the long triangles with holes in them, as the actual hoop part of the earring is so thick that the largest hole only barely has clearance to wiggle around. I think this size issue, combined with the flat edges of the hoops (instead of rounded) make the execution of this particular set fall a little short, but visually they're still really fun!<br /><br />I think that these earrings are definitely a great set for the cost, and work great for anyone looking for some bold earrings instead of something dainty, regardless of sex/gender."
4.0,"They look exactly like the pic. I noticed on my phone the lenses appear bluish gray. My tablet shows them as they are, gray. They are what they are: cheap sunglasses. Love 'em!"
4.0,"Love except that I have to bend over to get into the pockets.  I'm 5ft 4 in and only the tips of my fingers go into the dress while standing.  HOWEVER, the pockets are nice and deep.  I could put my travel coffee mug in one and still have several inches.  You won't lose anything out of these.  They are also fairly long...they go to my knees.  These are not paper thin, perfect for fall or spring weather.  I bought 3 colors (black, deep blue, & khaki) and I'm sure I'll get lots of wear out of them."
4.0,Makes my legs feel so good after standing or sitting for long periods of time.
4.0,"I'm pretty picky about my belts and for quite a while now I've been searching for a nice, lightweight slim-profile belt for my shorts. This fit the bill perfectly. It's very comfortable, the construction is high quality, and the clasp is very secure. The reason I can't give it 5 stars, though, is the high price. I think this belt should sell for more in the range of $15-$20. If it was in this price range, I'd buy a second one for sure."
4.0,"Well made- it's Nike.  Perfect as a swim top or for outdoor sports.  Note that it runs small, so recommend you buy a size up."
4.0,Mesh sticks to velcro
4.0,"It works fine, though it loses elasticity in some areas."
4.0,The pjs are very warm. It is too long if you short.
4.0,"Although Both top and bottom fit a bit tight, it's an  over all great product and great price.  it looks exactly like the original brand.Very happy I just ordered another color :)"
4.0,Overall the hat is good. Comfy. Warm yet breathable. Only downside is that the brim is NOT formable. Meaning it does what it wants.
4.0,"I absolutely love this shirt, but I had to return the first one because it fit to small. I normally wear 1 X had to buy 3 XXX and that fits perfect. I get compliments everytime I wear it."
4.0,"I love this shirt! It's adorable, but way too small for me. I normally wear an XS or small. Ordered a small and it doesn't fit. Wish they had a medium."
4.0,"**update: the company offered to make it right and it’s great. So no worries, if you do get a fluke wrong order rest assured that they will answer reviews and emails in a timely manner... thanks!!<br /><br />**Original: One set was perfect! But I got two bungees, three ends, one end clip and one toggle.. if I would’ve received all the correct pieces it would’ve gotten 5 stars"
4.0,I very good solution for this amount of money! I had the previous for almost 2 years until it was time to refresh it with a new one...
4.0,"Larger than I expected.  Maybe I didn't read the description enough times.  Otherwise, so far ok.  Just beginning my exploration to see if yellow lenses will help me with my night drives."
4.0,"These are not bad at all. The two pack contained a black pair which has a red tint to the lens and a white pair which is tinted blue (doesn't look that way from the picture. They're knock offs, but they don't feel too cheap. The box they came in is nice too."
4.0,I really like it. Is long enough to wear with leggings. Only bad thing it came with a stain and I'm hoping it comes out in the wash :(
4.0,"This bag was bigger than I expected it to be, but is definitely not a negative. It’s well made and makes for a great gift."
4.0,"These are super cute. But, although they are similar, they're not exactly what is pictured. The shape is off. They are baggy but not as much as the picture and the legs aren't tapered the same. I have a feeling that the picture was from a designer and then this is company remade them in a similar style. (Either that or their quality control is severely lacking.) Not exactly what I was looking for but I am sure I will wear them again."
4.0,Material is very light and comfortable to sleep in.  However the material is see through.
4.0,I gave this a a present and rhey really loved the look and feel of the watch .
4.0,Its a very pretty dress for the money.  It has extra room in the waste and needed to be taken in a little bit for my slim daughter.
4.0,Thin flannel soft as I expected it. Good quality. Somewhat larger of a fit
4.0,"I love Allegra K shirts. This is my third one. I always buy a M but this one &#34;has more room&#34;.<br />The material is thicker than I thought and will go great with leggings. I rated 4 stars over 5 as I went by the size chart and it's &#34;roomy&#34;, fits more like a L."
4.0,"The style, the colors, pockets, very comfortable. No complaints."
4.0,"Pretty, and is thick enough to offer protection, but does not feel uncomfortable. It is printed though, not embroidered. I might get some puffy paint to correct that."
4.0,Love it for a casual trip to do chores! Not sure what material it is...seems a little see-thru'
4.0,True to size .. Like the style of the shirt just wish it was more of a cotton shirt opposed to milk silk but .. it was a good deal so I couldn’t pass it up.
4.0,Top was a little big we had it taken in other than that it was perfect!
4.0,"Very cute outfit, wish I would’ve gotten a small. Medium is kinda big on me but I’ll definitely make it work for Saturday."
4.0,"This is a stylish, inexpensive, easy care, casual men's shirt that is excellent for the spring weather.  x"
4.0,"Looks great, band feels really nice, and a love the little bracelets that came with it!"
4.0,The crotch is cut too tight. The best feature is the cargo pockets.
4.0,"It’s a nice thick material not see through. It covers your stomach but if you have a spare tire like me it won’t conceal your whole stomach area just the middle. The color was pretty,"
4.0,Very nice lots of pockets very well made only thing is the chain needs to be longer so it can be carried like a crossbody purse.
4.0,Good hat.  I've worn the TaylorMade Cage caps for years and bought several of them.
4.0,"This hat may run a tad large.  But not so large that you can't wear it.<br /><br />I like the bow on it.  It adds a bit of style.  Keeps it from being a boring hat.<br /><br />It is heavier than my NY Yankees cap.  But the rim is large and protects the face, so it probably offers better protection.<br /><br />It might be too warm for a hot day though.<br /><br />I think I'd like something lighter and smaller for me.  But that's subjective.<br /><br />If you want protection and are working in 60-70 degree temps, this hat may be fine for you especially if your head runs larger rather than smaller."
4.0,I will give these a good review because the denim is nice and they look great. Faded color and exactly as pictured.  But they run very small. I must have misjudged my size. For reference I am 5'4&#34; 127 pounds. Usually wear a size 27 or 28 jeans. I ordered these in a 5 based on the size description for the waist and could not pull them up past mid thigh. I think I would have to order a size 9 for them to fit. Sadly they will be returned.
4.0,"Good price for the product. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't match with everything, which is normal for any necklace. If this were stainless steel with no gold on it, I'd give it 5 stars."
4.0,I like it. I'll probably get more.
4.0,They are not as  thick as was expected.  The fit and feel is more like knee high socks. I like  them enough buy again.
4.0,not a perfect size. Length does not fit even if I add a piece or remove a piece. But super cute.
4.0,Obsessed! Great buy and super cute. Sometimes cheaper sunglasses can be uncomfortable but that’s not the case with these. I bought the tortoise and the black and I wear both of them all the time. The lens is dark which is what I am always looking for in sunglasses. Glad these worked out!
4.0,Love these lens they took a few minutes to put in but the polar lens are amazing.  I work on a hot dry flightline all day and it's pretty nice to be able to see when I'm not wearing night vision.
4.0,These gloves are birthday gifts for February.  Hoping they will be what the birthday child is expecting.  Thank you.
4.0,"Comfortable...... and keeps your ears, and head warm, almost too warm! Size was a little big but not too loose to matter."
4.0,"Its a pretty standard clear plastic stadium purse. No frills, just a straight functional purse (though the colorful zipper was a fun surprise! I missed that in the description when I bought it!). It was great for a concert I was attending that required stadium rules on purses and will be perfect for future event where I don't want to tote a lot along with me. There are ""prettier"" styles (less boxy, more clutch purse or cross-body bag styles) but for the price and the practicality, I'd recommend it."
4.0,It was perfect for Eid! My head was a little small so I had to bobby pin it to my head but overall A++.
4.0,Not best photo. I am 5’2 150 c cup M is great fit just a tad of a stretch but I do not need. It flows as d as down. Unlike so many others. Sent a better photo to my sig other his reply “Nice my queen” He usually is not so exacting until he knows I like something. As in you look god in everything. LOL.<br />I buy large because I do not like clinging across my protruding belly. But too my chance that this would not skimp on material it doesn’t. The 4 is fir seam down front. Since v in front and back I turned it around. Fits the same Easy fix.
4.0,"Excellent for the price.  Although the stones are dark blue and not light as in the picture,  Very pretty set."
4.0,"Other buyers are right about the breast area being too large (I have 36 DD).  I ordered exactly according to size. The suit is beautiful and comfortable and the value is great with the exception of one thing, the shorts underneath. I purchased a second suit similar to this one in style a week later, from another designer and seller, the shorts on the second suit are very comfortable. The shorts on this suit is tight and noticeable to the point that I keep tugging at it all day while I am in it. I lost a lot of weight so I have a lot of areas with extra skin and my preference is a longer skirt in a suit, so this is perfect. Love the wide straps as well.  If the designer could adjust the shorts, we would have a 5 star winner!"
4.0,The women’s shirts were soft and wonderful. Then men’s shirts were very polyester-y feeling.
4.0,It'll get the job done. Seems very sturdy. Wish you could adjust the tilt of the phone or somehow bring the phone over the controller instead of behind it. All that weight at the back of the controller could bring early fatigue.<br /><br />Other then that great deal for 3.
4.0,Nice colors... size as expected... so far wearing well without cracking or loosing “fur”
4.0,LOVE the anti skid and thickness of the sock. Best fit is a 7.5 woman's foot or smaller although I am an 8.
4.0,"This beanie was a bit small but I do have a big head. Other than that, it was comfortable and nice."
4.0,"Runs very small. Not according to size chart, and didn't even come labeled with size on product, only on bag.<br /><br />Item does wash well, and holds shape and quality after several washes and a few times in the dryer. The colors are lovely, and I have worn i many times, and gotten several compliments. I just wish that it was closer to the size chart- so that it fit better."
4.0,I purchased these to wear on cold days.  They are comfortable and did keep my feet warm while wearing warmer socks.  They also provided traction on slippery surfaces.  I only gave a 4 star as I would prefer thicker souls for more walking comfort.
4.0,Not bad !!
4.0,Love the fit and the colors...comfortable!
4.0,"I was searching for rosary beads that were more durable than most.  I used to have nightmares at night and decided to try an experiment after watching an Amazon purchased DVD &#34;Padre Pio Miracle Man&#34; . Padre Pio called his rosaries his weapon. I decided to try wearing a rosary around my neck before I went to bed.  I really never prayed the rosary very often being a convert to Catholicism, so the ones I had broke easily. The Black Wood Prayer Beads Rosary are much sturdier and stayed in tact for weeks or more and only break at one link where the icon attaches to the beads leading to the cross. That is why I gave them four and not five stars but I am very pleased. FYI I am not a superstitious person but must admit the weapon cured the problem. So I started wearing them day and night. I am very pleased with their durability. Even took them to India last Nov. to see the incorruptible body of St. Francis Xavier in Goa. Gave one away to a pilgrim on our cruise ship and she was delighted. For me they are great."
4.0,Impressed with the quality
4.0,"Beautiful leotard for girls. We purchased a white size small, it fit my 11 year old who is skinny and average height. It is soft and comfortable, no itchy seams. It is sheer, you'll need something under or over it like tights, underwear, a skirt or shorts."
4.0,"Really like the quality, wish the color was just a bit more saddle not so bright, but still very happy with the purse!"
4.0,"You can't go wrong here. Cheap, super cute, and fits the way you would expect it to fit."
4.0,My son loved it! He got so many compliments. The only complaint is the tail is attached with a clothes pin instead of being sewn on
4.0,"Originally ordered a small. I am normally size small, size 4 pants. Ladies, I could not even get this shirt over my head. Returned and ordered a large and probably should have even got tan an XL. Very cute but make sure you order 2-3 sizes larger!"
4.0,"Super cute and very comfy! But if you've a long torso & don't want constant camel toe, order a size up"
4.0,"Good shirt, thin which is comfortable, but you do have to iron it - it wrinkles a lot unless you hand wash it."
4.0,Love it! Really cute and stretchy. I only took a star off because it only has 4 snaps and they don't stay snapped. If another 2 were added I am sure it would stay together. I may just buy a snap kit and add some.
4.0,"They're a pretty good size. But they can bend easily if you wear them for too long of a period of time. And by a long period of time, I mean constantly, even sleeping in them. They're pretty great though!"
4.0,nice price and fast delivery
4.0,its very cute but feels a little small and shirt bulges out.
4.0,this can be worn as a casaul day or work outfit
4.0,Nice shirt and great price!
4.0,"The skirt is a little tight and tended to ride up, but it's super cute and comfortable and I'm going to wear it often!"
4.0,Gift for granddaughter's first time on skis.
4.0,Love the colors. Just as expected
4.0,"Purchased for my grandmother because we needed royal blue for a funeral, she is 81 y/o. She liked the dress but wasn’t a fan of the material. She does want to order more dresses from amazon."
4.0,These are super soft but the top &#34;moves around&#34; during the night and you wake up with body parts showing. Just sayin…
4.0,Veryyyy cute but the color started to fade pretty quickly and my skin does not like the metal so I break out if I wear it too long. Nice if you’re just wearing it with an outfit for the day but it’s not something I’d just keep on indefinitely which I usually like to do.
4.0,"Really cute sweater and sexy with cold shoulder.  Loose fitting so if you have a few pounds in the middle, it’s flattering.  I can wear a Medium or Large and ordered up to the Large.  The Medium would have fit fine.  It’s a true to size sweater."
4.0,"Finally got to use glasses for running and fishing. Good pair for price, fits well and comfortable"
4.0,I LOVED this dress - fit perfectly - very comfy.  I normally wear a 12 and a large was perfect for me.  However there is a seam down the middle front and the polka dots did not match up and it looked off and was extremely distracting so I am returning it.  Would purchase a solid color in a heart beat but they do not have that option.
4.0,good quality and my grandson loved them.
4.0,"I am finishing up a full work-day of wearing this bra. I've never had a 'sticky bra' like this before, and wasn't sure what to expect. Here's what I experienced:<br /><br />The pros:<br />It really does make me look like I have some cleavage. As a very flat-chested woman, that's a huge plus (and why I bought it to begin with).<br />No straps. No clasps. I can actually BUY a backless dress now or one of those cute 'cut-out' dresses!<br />Not nearly as uncomfortable as I expected it to be.<br />I have a feeling that peeling this off at the end of the day is going to be much more relieving than unclasping a bra at the end of the day.<br />It holds really well. I haven't been in an environment where I sweat a lot (others have said the adhesive doesn't hold when you sweat), but I've been carrying around boxes and stuff today and it's stayed fine.<br /><br />The cons:<br />I was kind of hoping for more 'upwards' support with this bra, but because you have to position your boobs to make sure the inside nipple covers do what they're supposed to do (otherwise ouch!), it's more of a 'together' support instead of 'up' support. Which works out fine! It just would have been nice to have some 'up' support.<br />It's a little bit itchy. It took some getting used to, and for the most part the itch went away after a little while. But occasionally I do feel a little itchy along the edges.<br /><br />For the price, this is great just to have as a bra that you can wear with a backless/strapless dress. Plus, it does give you a bit of a cleavage look, so go ahead and feel sexy! I really enjoy this product so far."
4.0,"Cute and simple little arrow, I think it was available in other finishes, but I love this for dressing up an office outfit. I've got a bigger chest and if you're in that boat with me, it falls just below the normal like bosom line (ie tank top level) so it won't sneak under your shirt and poke you. So cute, so inexpensive but NOT cheap!"
4.0,These are very pretty but need to be handled with care.  The silver is literally thin wire.
4.0,"Soft...nice graphic, mine seemed to be on the small size based on other I own and wear.  Overall a nice item with a nice look and feel."
4.0,"I am 5'8"", 151lbs, ordered L/XL two pack grey ombre and black.<br />The black ones got a run the first day I wore them. Their fabric was very different from the ombre pair, I do not recommend them whatsoever. However the ombre pair were... pretty great. The fabric was sturdy and comfortable. They made my butt look awesome XD (Yes, they are 100% SQUAT PROOF!) The waistband stretched a little bit through a workout, but not nearly as bad as many other pairs I've tried.<br /><br />Sadly, they were not a perfect fit. I believe they were cut for someone who carries less upper thigh fat, as you can see from the second image. They way the seams were positioned caused a weird crease of tension in the fabric from my crotch across my upper thigh. However, this was not particularly noticeable unless I was sitting cross legged or doing some intense stretching. They were also always a bit tight on my caves.<br /><br />When I first started wearing them I was maybe 165. Now I'm approaching 150, and they are becoming a bit loose, especially at the waist. I will not be repurchasing them, but overall I am pleased with how well they held up and I would certainly recommend them to someone with slimmer legs!"
4.0,"my other frye boots ran big.  these are more true to size.  unfortunately, i ordered a size down.  i had them stretched on the sides which helped.  very nice boots!"
4.0,"I'm not a fancy pants man, but I do own a tuxedo.  ( I guess that makes me a  fancy pants man)  and one of the problems of having a tuxedo is cufflinks in  shirt  studs.  You are always losing one or the other or more than one.  It came time to replace my set as I was missing cufflink and two shirt studs.  I saw these on Amazon and the pricing is reasonable so why not give them a try.  I ordered them and they came quite promptly as I am an Amazon prime member. When I opened the package I was impressed  they are quite nice.  Now there are not lots of tools on them and they're not gold  or silver they are quite nice looking  and do the job.  it's just what I need  to look sharp  in my tux.  They come in a nice little storage bag so as long as I am putting them back in  the bag when I'm done I should never have to replace them.  I like them and give them a four-star rating even if you don't need this shirt studs, the cufflinks alone are worth the price. Why not give them a try as well.<br /><br />  I really appreciate your support for that I intend to leave reviews to help others make decisions prior to purchase based upon my recommendations or disclosure and I utilize your reviews to help me with my purchases as well.  I have received this product during the promotional period at a discounted price for my honest review.  Thanks for reading, even though I received this product at little or no cost, my review is not based upon that consideration because my reviews are honest, factual and accurate.  Thank you"
4.0,very good for the price.
4.0,Takes a few weeks to break it in overall worth it.
4.0,I love that they came in a box and with a case.  They seem like they will last a while and they fit perfect even with my big head and round/long face.
4.0,"They do run a half size too big. Im a 8.5 in most shoes so I ordered them in 8.5 but these feel like a 9 . Don't feel like returning them, just gonna be careful while wearing them . They are comfortable.  Only thing I don't like is that they don't have a extra bended shoe lace thing to hold the extra length of laces so have to wrap around the boot when tying them ."
4.0,"Kinda cheaply made, the bow comes out if you pull it. But worked for its purpose of pictures."
4.0,Cute coat for the price.  Fits a little snug even through the shoulders and the pockets are really far to the back of the coat  It will look great for a night out.
4.0,"Beautiful skirt, just fits a tad looser than I expected. I plan on taking it in to make it a high-waisted skirt anyways so that does not matter to me. I do recommend this skirt!"
4.0,"TEMEGO Jewelry Mens Stainless Steel Vintage Pendant Gothic Hollow Cross Dog Tag Necklace,<br />  I purchased this pendant for my husband to replace one that he had lost a few months ago. Only to discover that the chain had broke within a week of him wearing it, mostly because I think it was too small for his neck size, rather than returning it I bought him a replacement chain that fit his neck better. we found this stainless steel charm one that seemed to fit our criteria. I didn't think that stainless steel could possibly look this good, but it is still beautiful, shiny, silver and looks as good as new after several months of my husband's wearing it. I never would have thought I would prefer stainless steel over silver or other silver-colored metals, but I have changed my mind, and would highly recommend this piece for everyday tarnish free wear."
4.0,Quite nice material and feel but a but larger than I expected.<br /><br />However quite nice and can be used through winters
4.0,My 4 year old loves it. The volume is extremely loud. It’s challenging to set the time. The item is packaged nicely.
4.0,I live these bands and buy them for every watch I buy no matter what is is.. Easy to clean when your wrist or arm gets wet.. Many colors to choose from.. Durable..
4.0,The box it came in was messed up.
4.0,"Great dress, fit a little tighter than expected, but still fit. 4 stars because it was FAR shorter than expected. WELL above my knees. To be fair, I'm 5'11, but bending over was almost like giving a free show... Overall though, this dress was great. Well made and nice fabric."
4.0,Very comfortable although it could have been just a little bit bigger.
4.0,Great price fashionable
4.0,"This shirt is so fun! I’m 5’4”, 155 lbs and 36C, and the medium fits perfectly. It’s drapey, but not too loose. The cotton fabric is light and comfortable, and the sleeve detailing is so fun and classic. This is an easy choice to feel a little dressed up in really practical and comfortable clothing. The red is rather bright and Christmas-y, so this might be a fun choice around the holidays. The only downside is that it’s not a good layering piece because of the sleeve shape, and it’s a bit light to be the only layer in the winter. Overall though this is a sweet little shirt and I’m glad I got it. 4 stars."
4.0,"The boots are a nice fit, a good height, and pretty comfortable overall. They also seem to be pretty good quality. The one problem I have with the boots is how they lace (Re-lacing takes a lot of time and I have to do it every time I put them on). But other than that, they're great boots. I would recommend them."
4.0,"These work well with certain styles.  I like the mix of colors and I paired them with cross pendants that are varied colors of stone as welll.  I am still discovering the many ways to wear this, you can pair several colors at once with a pendant or alone as just strands of color.  Good deal."
4.0,I like this bracelet because my wrists swells from lupus very nice.
4.0,"I love the look, feel, and durability of this band / case. I would like everyone to know after install you will NOT be able to turn the crown. If you have a series 4 you can still get a EKG reading because it uses the surface. If it was not for the crown  it being able to be turned it would be perfect."
4.0,Made very nicely for the price.  Color was exactly as described.  The style just wasn't me so had to return it.  That's my fault not the dress!
4.0,"Probably should have gotten the 6 inch. Oh well, my fault. Look good and for 13 yr old soccer player."
4.0,"Very cute, and nice quality. Wish it has coin pocket."
4.0,These are ok for what I used them for. These were for a bachelorette trip and we used them just for the pics because they don’t protect well from the sun.
4.0,"This shoe is so comfortable, but the color wasn't what I expected."
4.0,Runs small and I ordered up a size
4.0,It dose it job
4.0,Love the cut would have preferred a better fabric
4.0,Great dress for the price. I bought this on a lightning deal for $15.99 and didn't have the highest expectations going into it. The fabric quality is about what I would expect for the low price. It was a very flattering cut. The light material was a good for being stuck outdoors on a hot day. Good purchase!
4.0,"I wear a 8.5-9 and the large feels big on me.  These have slipper bottoms, but if you’re okay with going out with just a soft rubber bottom; then have at it."
4.0,"I love this shirt, it was kinda stiff the first few times but after washing it, it feels a lot better. The colors pop next to the black and look very pretty!"
4.0,Very nice casual set with great quality fabric.  I bought the navy after receiving the yellow.  Too pricy though.
4.0,"I have a small wrist and this stays put on my arm, plus the clasp is easy to open and close.  It's black and grey with silver beads so it goes with anything.  I like wearing silver better than gold, so this bracelet is a great choice."
4.0,"First, let me say that I have no ankles so it's really tough to find a boot that will zip over my tree stumps - this is a perfect fit. I live in Maine and the fuzzy insides keep me more warm that I would have thought. Great for tooling around town on a cold/snowy day but don't feel like 'snow boots' (and don't look like them either) so I can wear them for a nice dinner with a skirt but they are not 'active wear' boots (I wouldn't hike in them or expect them to fulfill all my winter boot needs). I did notice the foot-slidy thing that others have mentioned but it doesn't really bother me unless I wear them all day, it is interesting how it feels like a little heel. They are comfortable, cute, and a great price. I am an 8.5 and always an 8.5 - these fit true to size. If I could think of a reason why I would need a different color, I would get another pair!"
4.0,"i like casio brand and G shock series, this price is not over, when i wearing it feel very cool."
4.0,This jacket is cute but a button fell off of it pretty easily. Reccomend buying though!
4.0,My daughter is 32 pounds and 38 inches tall. She just turned 4. I got a bunch of these for potty training. Our circumstance is quite different as this isn't just a regular potty training experience. She was born with a birth anomaly that requires multiple surgeries to fix. Long story short she has has two surgeries and we have reached the age where our next options start. These panties did the job I was hoping. She doesn't have much control but these were wet enough so she new she needed to at least &#34;go potty&#34; or get a new pair. Out first option didn't work but I will be keeping these to either pass on to someone who is comfortable taking them used or for our next option. Great buy here on amazon and will likely purchase again if I need the next size up in the future. I knew I would need the waterproof lining for our situation and this kept our messes to a minimum. I did have to hand stretch the leg holes to make them a tad bigger so my daughter could take them on and off easier. I see these fitting the rest of her very well. I may just alter these to fit as she grows up not out.
4.0,gift for husband. has yet to use it. i liked it.
4.0,"I bought this necklace for a spur of the moment present for my daughter who is a big fan of the Hero TV show.  She loved it. It could have been a little larger, but it is nice, regardless, and th price as very reasonable."
4.0,"like this one,though it is suppose to be had washable"
4.0,The costume is great. It looks hood and isn't too heavy or too light. The only downside is that it is uncomfortable to wear without shorts and a shirt underneath the costume.
4.0,and it seems to be a hit so far.  Comfortable and the color (tan/brown) is nice.  Good price and comfortable.
4.0,"Love the product, not but i spected, somehow i spect something more loose; the truth is that its really strechy like a croptop and left al the level of the ribs. I am 1.65m and 150lbs and ordern a midium. So, if you dont wanna show your belly this is not for you."
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised with this tank. It arrived much faster than expected since It shipped from Europe. The fit was great - I usually wear L or XL (I'm a 12-14 and busty), so I ordered the XL based on reviews that said it ran small and I'm glad I did. The quality of the material is good, not flimsy at all and I love the long length. This is a great layering piece."
4.0,"I ordered this ring as a memorial for my dog that recently passed away. I absolutely love it. The different color paw prints remind me of the Rainbow Bridge poem.  The only reason that I did not give this ring a perfect 5-star rating is because I wish it would have been a little larger.  It is very dainty, which I don't mind, but it almost makes the paws hard to see.  The colors are harder to see unless you are in a well lit room.  Still really, really love the ring, and what it means to me."
4.0,Material fades quickly...on the big baggy side.  Cute though.
4.0,These are super cute &amp; look adorable on my 2 yr old daughter but they are way to long &amp; big for her little legs. I think they are a better fit for a 5 yr old.  I can't remember if these came in sizes or one fits all (toddlers) but if they came in sizes I know I ordered the smallest size they have. So I would recommend ordering 2 sizes down if that's a option? if it's not I wouldn't get these for toddlers under 3 for sure.  I am going to just get out my needle &amp; thread and alter them myself. They look to cute not to be worn and won't be in style by the time she's 4 or 5 yrs old so why not they were only 4 bucks...
4.0,Did not contact seller. Was an easy fix. Daughter is going to LOVE it.
4.0,"Beware that these are only the headbands OR wristbands, not both.  Other than that - its a decent product."
4.0,So these are super cute. I am about 5'3 and 127 lb. I got the size small. It's really good except a little tight around my thighs. But I think they will stretch this habit after wearing them a few times.
4.0,A little tight fitting.
4.0,Like the colors and the lace on the sleeve.  Feels a little scratchy though
4.0,Bought this as a top that would be easy for nursing and long in length but it was not as long as I hoped. Will be returning my LG for a XL to see if the length will be better.
4.0,Runs big and there was no x-small
4.0,Good for homebound seniors using a walker. Only one strip if treads. The ones from hospitals have 2 strips of treads: uppers and lowers.
4.0,"I bought these for a trip to Orlando, FL during a heat wave. These shorts were perfect! They fit nicely, and dry quickly. They are extremely comfortable. I’m 5’1” and they hit right at my knee.<br /><br />I have heavy thighs, so I’ve always worn a swim dress, but didn’t like having to completely disrobe to use the bathroom, and I don’t like how the skirts float up. These board shorts cover my thighs, and I can wear whatever top fits the occasion.<br /><br />They have built in underwear for swimming, but I cut them out of one pair to use just as shorts. Perfect for swimming, rafting, water parks, hiking, just about anything, actually! These are my new summer go to!<br /><br />I took one star off because the waist tie isn’t tacked, and came out in the wash. I’m wearing them without it, and they stay up just fine. Also, the elastic in the waist twists in the wash. So far I’ve been able to straighten and flatten it. I don’t put them in the dryer."
4.0,"It fits how the description said it would, Boxy."
4.0,"I would recommend this hoodie for casual wear.  It is heavy and bulky, not necessarily a bad thing, but my first choice for active sports or travel.<br /><br />Material/Construction:  The material is thick and appears to be strong.  The fabric is 60% Cotton, 40% Polyester.  The exterior is smooth knit and the interior is fleece.  The construction looks sound.  It should provide moderate warmth in dry conditions.  If you want to layer it with a raincoat, be sure your coat is big enough as this is not a fitted style and is bulky.<br /><br />Pattern/Color:  The chevron design is attractive.  The white/gray/black color block combination looks sharp.<br /><br />Design/Fit/Sizing:  There a kangaroo pockets on the front.  The hood is not fitted, more for style and keeping a light breeze off your neck.  It is somewhat short for a hoodie, but width is true to size."
4.0,Hubby LOVED the comfort and pockets
4.0,"I got this suit at a great price, which meant I could expect poor quality. Thankfully, I was wrong! The suit is so cute and flattering and fits as expected. My only size issue was with the tie back. It's too short to go from my neck and around my back, so I just tied it around my neck and had an open back. No biggie. I also take a slight issue with the scalloped edges. While adorable, they basically all get sucked in when you put on the suit, so in order to see them, I had to individually pull them out. Kinda annoying but whatever."
4.0,"I ordered these festive pajamas for my husband to wear Christmas morning. They are going to look great on him while we open gifts Christmas morning. They are super cute. The two-piece set includes plaid thermal underpants with a long-sleeved shirt. Woven throughout the pants are snowflakes and reindeer. On the chest of the shirt is a large reindeer with a banner which reads Christmas. The top is a baseball jersey with gray sleeves. The pants have a plaid design of cranberry and cream. Overall, I give these 4 stars because they are festive and cheerful."
4.0,"This is a very cute dress, but I felt the sizing was a bit off. I ordered my usual size, but the dress was somewhat loose and baggy, especially at the top. I would recommend ordering down a size."
4.0,"Ok for the money ,not bad probably won’t buy again but will use them for now ."
4.0,I love the mask.  It looks just like it does in the picture.  The only reason for the 4 stars is it's pretty large.  It touches the bottom of my eyes and I can't figure out a good way to adjust it so that doesn't happen.
4.0,"I am glad I bought these. They feel good, very light and they stay in well. Some of the previous reviews say they come all mixed together, however mine were separated by size and labeled in individual bags. Shipping took a while but wasn't that bad, almost three weeks. The seller gave me a tracking number but it wasn't usable for about a week and a half after it shipped. Over all very pleased.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />I am up to the 4g(5mm) spirals and have been sizing up every month or so. They feel very comfortable and make stretching very easy. When I got these I also bought a set of plugs that I thought I would swap out after a few days of healing. However I like the look of these so much and I like how easy they are to take out for cleaning that I decided not to even use the plugs and just use these.<br /><br />**UPDATE 2**<br />It has been a while I started stretching my ears with these and only have one more size to go. I just got to the 0G(8mm) and it has been very easy, the only problem I had is common with people who go from 2g to 0g, I had to buy a separate in between size, 1g, as the increase was just too much and trying to use tape didnt work well because the surface is curved. I have had almost no discomfort at all using these, even though I have been more aggressive at moving though sizes then most people probably would. Just don't go too fast to the point that you feel pain, very slight discomfort for a couple days is normal however.<br /><br />I will note that the spirals have fallen out while sleeping twice but it has not caused a serious problem, just took a bit of work and patience to work them back in.<br /><br />**UPDATE 3**<br />I am now at the largest size, 00g and thought I would give a final update on my experience. After consideration I removed one star from my review for two reasons. First off, the vast majority of the spirals have been great, beyond great even. However as I moved into the larger spirals, I found that the spirals had a hard time staying in the largest position and I would have to often adjust them back. It is not ideal to have to keep moving jewelry at the beginning of a new stretch when you should be leaving the jewelry alone to heal. The second reason is as you get to the larger sizes the spirals just get too large for my tastes to wear often and I decided to move to tunnels as I could just feel the weight of the spirals every time I would turn my head, and they catch on to clothing and i have had the unfortunate circumstance of pulling one by accident when taking ear plugs out of my ears. So my final assessment is this is a great set up to about 2g or 4g if you have very sensitive ears, but then I would suggest to get regular tapers/plugs for the last few sizes if you are moving to 00g as I did."
4.0,"My favorite down coat ripped so I have been looking for a long version to replace it.<br /><br />COLOR<br />The color of this is black- think shiny black like a lawn bag.  It has a muted gold lining which is actually nice looking.<br /><br />STYLE<br />The style is nice and basic.<br /><br />FILLING<br />The filling is a bit less than other down coats I have used or tried on but it is decent.<br /><br />SIZING<br />The sizing of this coat is okay with some issues.  I wear a size 14-16 misses US and this coat fits but then there are a couple of issues.  The size I am referring to is the XL size.<br /><br />SLEEVES<br />The sleeves are too short.  I mean my arms are so short that when I but something with 3/4  sleeves, my arms have the sleeves usually hit at the wrist like full length.  These sleeves are an inch at least too short.  There is elastic snapped cuffs and my wrists are bare when I am wearing this.<br /><br />HIPS<br />The rest of this coat is roomy and nice, but the hips are way too snug.  I am not out of proportion in sizing, so usually if the rest of the coat is roomy then the hips are too.  Not in this case.  I can zip up the coat but it is a bit snug in the hips.<br /><br />WARMTH<br />When it gets frigid cold, this coat will need a few layers under it- thin layers.  With the snug hip area that can be an issue.  I can work with it, but it is frustrating.<br /><br />ZIPPERS AND POCKETS<br />The zippers and pockets are great quality.  They all work, and the pockets are deep and at the perfect angle.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This coat is nice looking, is plenty warm for average use, and has decent zippers and pockets.  The sleeves are too short and hips too snug, so when trying to layer, it could be a problem.  If you have REALLY short arms and narrow hips, you might do well with this.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  I like this but don't love it.  I wear it often as a casual coat, but for really frigid weather, I will have to use another coat as it is a bit too narrow in the hips and cold at the wrists to be good for me.<br /><br />PHOTO<br />My camera is messed up and I can only take up close pics without full length ability right now.  If that changes soon (I hope so) I will try to post a photo for you.  It does look just like the photos with this listing though, so if you need to know- they are accurate."
4.0,"they seem a little tight,. I just loosened the laces. they're pretty comfy."
4.0,"The blue is super bright. My earrings have no lines and are one solid color, but if you look closely there they, are very faint. Nice size and very light"
4.0,simple wear - the 3 strands of bead twist over each other so they don't stay put like in the pic
4.0,"It took a while to receive. Almost 3 weeks,  But the wait was worth it. Super cute my daughter loves it. She wears a 4T, I ordered a 4T fits a little large but it's supposed to."
4.0,We bought this dress for a Father/Daughter Ball. This dress was beautiful. It arrived way earlier then expected. I was expecting a 3 week turn around and it was only 1 week! We were happy about that because we were not aware if it was going to make it in time. The price is amazing! The reason I gave it a 4 is because the sequins around the arms were really irritating my daughter and did leave some redness from poking her. otherwise the fit was amazing. we did order one size smaller then what she was due to reading other reviews.
4.0,"I love them but they easily slip-off after you wear them,"
4.0,Very cute but a little scratchy inside
4.0,"Its a cute necklace, honestly I thought it would be a tad bigger, but its still cute enough and big enough to see the detail.  The color is the same as well.  I purchased for my friend for christmas who absolutely LOVES octopus' so hopefully she will like it! The chain is also a decent length too, so I think she will appreciate that to where its not too short."
4.0,Love this top! Very cute the only part is there's no padding in the boob area so your nips are basically showing! Other than that it's perfect! 😍
4.0,"It fit better than I thought especially for being a bigger person, Amazon clothes don't really fit well."
4.0,They fit perfectly. However they do tend to rise up .
4.0,Smaller than normal small. I love the length. I am tall 5'9 and the inseam is long enough for even me. thin material. but I expected that.
4.0,"Love these, but I am starting to notice change of color after just a month. To be expected I guess with this price"
4.0,Quick shipping. Love this shoe!
4.0,Fits very well but pulls up alittle at times.
4.0,The beige is a pretty color with a grayish tint. The color is the same as what they classify as &#34;Mink&#34;. Quality of the scarf is good. There's a sheen to the fabric making it a little more dressy. Returned item to get the color I want.
4.0,By far the best-made dress I've ordered on Amazon.
4.0,These are really good for the price you pay for but the clasp is a little tricky
4.0,great for the price definitely getting more when I can its attached to denim but it stays in nice good product
4.0,Really awesome looking glasses but if you have a big head or big face they're a little tight. Might loosen up over time.
4.0,It's a shirt. It's a standard silk-screened T as pictured. Fit as expected so sizes run true. Bought it to wear on Christmas.
4.0,Thin and airy.  I prefer a little softer material.  Not overly loud like a lot of Hawaiian shirts.
4.0,"I ordered this and another case and this one looked very nice and was good quality. I needed a slim case for my pocket though so the other case I ordered better suited my needs and  I returned this one, but I would recommend as a product for anyone who is looking for a wallet with a pouch this like one has. Great for a purse, just not so good for a pocket."
4.0,ok so these are cute and simple very easy to put on by yourself which is cool. and they are made no fall of slip off or untie. the knot allows you to adjust the size around your wrist. you get several colors each with a different or word. i wore the bracelet for about a week before the silver plating turned coper. because I kept the bracelet loose on my arm I believe that's why my arm didn't turn green. so I cant say whether it turns your arm green or not but it definitely lost its color after a week. but it didn't look bad after just not the bright shiny silver it was.. it became a dull color but still wearable.
4.0,Im giving it 4 stars because it runs a little small. I Got a women's size 4-6 for my 12 yr old daughter(85lbs) but it  fits her great and she loves it.
4.0,It's a little big but very comfortable. I'd order it again but in one size smaller next time.
4.0,"Love the material. I tried to go by the reviews to order the correct size but still got it wrong. I am 5’7”and weigh 142lbs. I ordered a small. Fits snug but a little tight around the arms. Like them well enough to keep them, but did order more in a medium."
4.0,"Definitely a beautiful cover-up. The color is as shown, material very light and airy. I ordered size XL, the fit was perfect across the breast however the bottom was a lil snug. Good thing I can sew... going to split both sides to give it hip room."
4.0,"I'm giving this four stars despite the fact that this shirt doesn't really work for me.<br /><br />For one, the cut around the neck is far too low for my personal comfort.  I prefer less of my neck exposed.  Also, I found the pull cords far too long to the point where it annoyed me with them swinging around as I moved.<br /><br />So why give it four stars?  When giving a negative review I try to focus on things that I think will be disliked on a universal basis.  My complaints about this shirt are a matter of style.  If you like a lower cut around the neck and you like this style of shirt then definitely give this one a look.  It's got a nice look (I do like the overall style actually) and it's well made.  It's just not for me.  Your mileage may vary."
4.0,"Cute.  Not for every day, but love for that perfect night out"
4.0,Nice bracelet. Looks exactly as pictured. A
4.0,"Sleeves are long, but overall not bad. Make sure to go a size larger."
4.0,"Really like the style and the way it is made however the size, it fits small . If you order this item you should go a size up"
4.0,This is a very fun gift!  The gal we got this for loved it and we all had a great laugh.
4.0,I didn't realiza just HOW MINI they are but they are very pretty I will give them to my granddaughter instead
4.0,"I'm only giving it four stars because there was a small hole in one of the pockets but it was an easy fix. Other than that, dress fit perfect."
4.0,"This piece is gorgeous.  My only criticism is I wish the thread was longer.  19&#34; is almost a choker on me, I'd prefer 24&#34; or 25&#34; but I love the piece overall."
4.0,"Love the band, but the finish scuffs and shows the color of the base metal pretty easily"
4.0,Great color and attractive style! A little snug but wearable!
4.0,Good fit and true to size.  Nor crazy about material.
4.0,"The band works well.  Is easy to install on the watch.<br />Great price.<br />However, the band is VERY DIFFICULT to put on my wrist."
4.0,"I am on the fence with this band. I like the broken-in look a lot. I love the color brown it is. I am just a little cautious that this particular band may not last long?! I treated mine with a leather treatment similar to what you would use on car leather seats, leather couches/chairs, leather breifcases/messenger bags, or expensive leather purses & shoes. So, I guess I will see if it holds up. Otherwise, like I said the worn-in look is pretty cool looking & the color is exactly what I was looking for. I also swapped out the silver colored adapters & put on my space grey ones & it looks great!"
4.0,"I would give this shirt 5 stars, but it's tight for a Medium.  It's so cute, I'm tempted to order it again in a Large.  Size standardization would be such a great thing."
4.0,I love it it looks great for work.But you have to put a shirt under because it’s thin
4.0,Good for the money and nice looking ties
4.0,"I took the advice of others and ordered a size larger than what I normally wear.  I do like this top, it is a bit sheer but a cami underneath and no problem.  I would buy again."
4.0,Like the look of this on watch
4.0,"Cool stuff in here and a great price BUT, gopro needs to fire their prime contractor that they source their stuff from because the plastic used in this bits show here breaks REEEEALLLLY easy."
4.0,Lasted 30 seconds on the beach. Clasp broke and it floated out into the ocean.
4.0,Great product. I purchased on Monday thinking I'd have it by Friday but got on Monday so that's the only reason for the 4 star is shipping.
4.0,"You want to be in shape or have a flatter mid section to wear it nicely. I made some minor alterations to help camouflage some places I did not want on display. And, I received several compliments on the  dress."
4.0,"This would be five stars but it killed me ordering this for my step mother since I'm an Ole Miss fan. She better love me. Overall, This is a great product and great service. Absolutely no problems and it shipped quickly. Very happy with this product (except it being Alabama)."
4.0,These worked rather well for my Russia cosplay and a lot stronger than the last pair I had that were so thin that they'd rip if I barely moved my hand the wrong way.
4.0,"What this band lacks in flexibility, it more than makes up for in its’ stoutness. That’s not a bad thing. I’ve used other bands that were equally secure feeling as this, but they irritated my wrist. That’s not the case with this band. The tubular structure gives it a little give in two dimensions, making it more comfortable than you’d think at first wear.<br /><br />I like the variety of colors available.<br /><br />Misses:<br /><br />- The clasp could be a little longer. I felt like I was searching for the holes in the band to attach it.<br />- More color options for the hardware would be nice. The silver clashes (slightly) with my space grey watch.<br />- The loop for tucking in the extra band was joined on the outside of the band. Sloppy."
4.0,"Cute nightie. My boyfriend liked it. It's very short, and the &#34;cups&#34; are very small, which I expected they would be. I wish it were just a SMIDGE longer. That barely covered look is super hot, but it rides up and exposes everything as soon as you move from a standing perfectly still position. It's a good quality piece, fabric is nice and soft with lots of stretch and stitching seems good."
4.0,I love it but I thought it was cotton
4.0,This is a very nice dress although I find the fit of the 'flap' below the boob area a little awkward as it dowsn't always stay flat throughout wear as seen in the pictures from the seller. I personally made a mistake in not looking at the sizing chart provided by the seller and went with my usual sizing (Small).<br />I'm a 32B and found the chest area HUGE even in size small. I have a tiny waist to boot (68cm) so the whole dress just somewhat draped me in the end. An XS may have been a better fit in my case if it was available.<br />As I previously mentioned - the dress is very nice and the material has some stretch to it however it would best suit those with a larger bust (not too large).<br />I had also bought a petticoat to go with it because I was really digging the whole swing style and if I held the back tight enough so that it appeared to fit me it looked fantastic so I'll have to have the dress altered and hopefully I'll be able to get the effect I'd like since its out of the way for me to return it.<br /><br />Side note: the bust area is padded<br /><br />Bottom line - dress for the busty; keep an eye on the provided measurements
4.0,"I've been wearing the Amanda tapered-leg jeans for years, and have been disappointed in the last few pairs I've bought -- quality is definitely not as good, and the fabric content is a little different. However, when I saw that there was a boot cut style I thought I would try it.<br /><br />I like the way they fit at the top, but the flare in the legs is MUCH wider than it looks in the picture for this listing. Luckily, I sew, so after about five washes (I've learned my lesson over the years about how jeans keep on shrinking, and have lived to regret hemming them too soon), I took them in down the legs before I hemmed them, and I also dyed them because I don't like even the very slight fading that the Madison color has on the thighs. Now I love them. They are a nicer quality fabric than the latest iteration of the tapered-leg jeans, so I'm very pleased about that."
4.0,"Kind of tight, but I like them"
4.0,Fit good and looked great.
4.0,"This belt is very cute. The design is true to the image and it fits will in most of my jeans, even the shorts! It has a hidden bottle opener in the buckle (which I find amusing) and is all around comfortable. I've gotten many compliments as I let my nerd flag fly.<br /><br />The main reason I do not give it five stars is sometimes the fastener becomes unhinged at random. If I loosen it by an  inch, or torque it down then it clicks properly into place. Could be a design flaw, I'm not sure."
4.0,Purchased as a gift. Item was beautiful.
4.0,Bras are good for the price and comfort good
4.0,Very comfortable<br />Pants were fine the shirt was a bit tighter than I had hoped but so far so good<br /><br />I have not washed it but a few times yet do we will see how it holds up
4.0,The tunic was tight in the chest.  The sleeves are way too long for me.
4.0,"this one is great, but others from same vendor, company, in same size are too small and sometimes too big."
4.0,Cute fits well great price
4.0,"I was ready to leave a five-star review bc for what I paid, the quality was on point!  My daughter has 60’s-70’s day at school!  I was excited about the tassel socks but unfortunately they were no my included.  I msg’d the seller a couple days ago but haven’t heard back.  Wanted to return and repurchase but fear that it won’t arrive on time!  Just going to have to work around the cute tassel socks!  Luckily she has some tassel boots!"
4.0,"Like a lot of Cleo bras in my experience, it has a pretty tight band. The wires are narrow and comfortable. Overall, pretty comfortable and supportive, but I am using an extender to give the band more breathing space."
4.0,"These shirts are comfortable! I like the fabric. They do ride up on me while being active, but that may just be due to my body shape. I’d purchase these again!"
4.0,Nice gloves at a great price. Small kid gloves. Will fit my 3 year olds hands.
4.0,If the sleeves were a little bigger it would have been perfect taking a dress in is easy but if there is no allowance to take out it makes it hard.But over all l like the dress.
4.0,"The bag is really cute and lightweight.  It has only one outside pocket, and my iphone 7 plus, JUST fits- it's pretty tight.  I got the pale pink - I love the color for the spring and summer.  Just beware there are no other pockets on the inside of the purse."
4.0,"I've always wanted a Masonic pendent with ""The Man Who Would Be King"" version of the craft's emblem.  The pendent is very light weight and the images on both sides are sharp.  The adjustable cord allows me to wear it long and out of sight or as a choker.  It's an inexpensive and fun Masonic item.  The only negative is shipping cost."
4.0,Great for keeping the sun off in the sail boat.
4.0,"The photo on the website appears to be crew length socks,whereas these fit over the calf. They do offer very good support and I hope they work as advertised."
4.0,"Very cute outfit, runs a little big"
4.0,"Very nice colors. My husband wears a suit, a couple of times a week, so I'm always looking for cool ties, especially when they match my colors!"
4.0,"I loved the top of the dress, but the pleats in the dress made me look huge, sent it back."
4.0,Light weight but comfortable
4.0,"I'm very satisfied with the watch band. Easy to adjust and it fits comfortably.  Many people have complimented the band, looks great."
4.0,"This works as expected. The fit to the ear piece is quite good, and so far, after having it for a week, there have been no slippage. I also like that it doesn't have to be pushed in too far onto the ear piece. I hate ones that go so far, it starts to rub against the back of your ears. This one doesn't do that.<br /><br />The only minor issue that I have, and this is not specific to this product but to all chums, is that once you attach it to your glasses, the whole thing no longer fits into your glass cases. I can no longer use the case that comes with my sunglasses because the chums sticks out a bit more. So now I have to figure out if I can find something that can contain my chum-fitted glasses."
4.0,"It's a decent mask, kinda seems hurriedly made. Some spots were glued rather off and exposes the latex beneath. Fixable. High glue and latex smell wearing it brand new."
4.0,Looks good on me and I have a big head! Great price too.
4.0,"Love this product fit well ,came earlier then posted. New to Amazon  so  I'm really pleased"
4.0,"Fits well,  arms are a tiny short but great other than that"
4.0,"Cute top, I love it."
4.0,It’s cute but was way to big
4.0,Cute dress but material ripped a little after only wearing once.
4.0,No se de que pais venga este producto pero el size es muy diferente al size de USA un size XXL es un lagre de USA
4.0,"This is a terrific, fun and sensible product.  I have several and have gifted several.  However, they need to provide a medium size for women in all the designs.  For many of us, the &#34;frumpy&#34; designs that are offered for women are not appealing.  I gift to my sports fishing sons, and I wear mine for top down vintage muscle car driving.  Buff should realize that their product has great potential in the car clubs, and many of the members are women.  We don't want pink paisley.  We want stars and strips and Shelby Cobra and Ferrari, etc<br /><br />Wet the buff down and wear it in the hot sun.  It's your own personal swamp cooler."
4.0,Simple necklace with a little sparkle. I have had many compliments on it (the necklace).  The earrings are nice too. I have never worn both the necklace and earrings at the same time because for my purposes it was too much “glam” for a typical day.
4.0,A very comfy shirt
4.0,"Watch works well.  The only complaint I have with it, is that the band is a little short.  It just barely fits around my large wrist."
4.0,"You never know what you are getting from these factory brands, but I like these, they fit well for the most part, but I think would be a challenge for anyone who is skinny and tall. I'm 5-10 160 and I think they are just barely long enough. Material is comfortable. No idea how well they'll last, but I'm sure they'll do the job."
4.0,Not meant for toddler sizes. Fits as described for school age children
4.0,"Only issue is, they fog up my safety glasses in cold weather."
4.0,Took a while to get to me but I like the hat.  A nice addition to my Corvette accessories.
4.0,The dress was very well made...just didn't look right on me.
4.0,Beautiful fabric and colors! A little bolder than I expected but still very pretty! I was impressed with the quality.
4.0,"Beautiful dress. Super soft and stretchy.  Gave four stars only because the burgundy I ordered looks more like red. Unless they sent the wrong color? Either way I’m keeping it. I’m 5’1, 125lbs, 34dd chest. Got a medium and it’s perfect. Hit at the knee."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:6535cd8aa180a7ff404a659b97276f24]] I loved the fit
4.0,"Super cute , pants fit as expected top runs small"
4.0,"I ordered a size up after reading other reviews, fits great, very cute, 4 stars as it was very thin ( slub material). Need to wear cami under it. Love all things Mickey"
4.0,"Beautiful flannel top, only...the color was slightly misrepresented. On my monitor, at least, &#34;Forest&#34; appears to be a somewhat lighter teal-green plaid. The actual shirt is a darker kelly. Still a wonderful color, as it's rich and vibrant, but I'd been specifically looking for the green as it looks on the screen. Ah, well. My recipient should like this shade just as much."
4.0,"Arrived on time and works well. A little big for my one year olds head. He wouldn't keep them on until exposed to loud noise, then he left them alone. We use them for when he wants to ride along when mowing."
4.0,"Like the print, but it is that really thin soft cotton and I'm a bigger guy.  Therefore, it fits smaller than I expected, didn't really like the cut.  It is a good shirt though."
4.0,These are very comfortable... easy to put on... maybe a little harder to take off due to no finger tips to pull on.<br /><br />The keep my hands warm for the first 10 minutes on cold mornings until my body warms up.<br /><br />If this review was helpful to you...Please click this review was helpful... it lets me know it's worth my time to do reviews.
4.0,"Quality was great. It will probably fit best if child is around 4-6 months or about 14-20lbs. It slipped on my baby’s head one night and covered her face but she may have pulled it. So I would say, use it with caution."
4.0,I regret not paying attention to the chain size. WIsh there was a longer option.
4.0,"Purchased as a gift, and it was loved! So cute!"
4.0,"The size difference between the top and pants are off. The top part fits perfect, but the pants are for a taller person lol"
4.0,It’s a well made mask and looks very true to the film. Great as a collector item. If you plan on wearing it beware that it is small and not for large heads. All in all it’s a great buy though especially for the price.
4.0,Very true to size soft and comfortable Way Too Thin you can see right through the bust
4.0,"I have a 5 year old daughter, so skirts like this are right in her wheelhouse.  She has a pink, a yellow, and a zebra, so I was excited to find this rainbow one at a good price.  When we opened the package her words were &#34;ooooh, Mommy, I love it!&#34;.<br /><br />First of all, shipping on this takes forever.  That is clearly stated up front, but it takes a loooooong time.  If you need this quickly this definitely isn't the item for you.  If you're planning a few months ahead, then go for it!<br /><br />This skirt isn't exactly what I thought based on the pictures.  Each color around is actually a separate piece.  Because of this, nothing is really connected, making it absolutely necessary to wear shorts or tights or leggings underneath.  There's no way you could wear this with just underwear.  Imagine a belt with a bunch of neckties tied around it...it's sort of like that.  It's still cute, but I'm a little bummed that it's not a stand alone item (my daughter doesn't like to wear shorts under skirts).<br /><br />The colors are vibrant.  The material is tulle with a satin type border.  The 'bow' is also satin.  that's another weird part...not sure what to do with those extra ribbons in the front.  They're too thick to tie as a bow (at least a cute bow), but they're too long to leave randomly hanging.  I'll have to play around to figure out where they should go.<br /><br />Overall this is a cute skirt and any twirl-loving little one will enjoy it.  The twirl factor is great - probably because none of the pieces are connected!"
4.0,"Slightly smaller than expected. Gaining weight due to pandemic really sucks. It is a little thin fabric so be careful. I wanted it a few inches shorter so I took it to be altered. Other than that, loooove"
4.0,Material was great but I feel like this is true to size and a large would have been adequate. I hesitated and got xl and it was huge so I had to return.
4.0,Love it! Shirt fits perfect and is very soft material.
4.0,This item runs one size larger!!!!!!!!  Very nice but big
4.0,The piece itself is great but runs REALLY small. I wear a 6-8 so ordered a medium (says 8-10). Liked it enough to reorder a large which is supposed to fit a 10-12 so hoping it works. Go up at least one size- seriously.
4.0,"This is really nice ""car jewelry"". It makes my heart smile when I get into the car! I got one for myself,one for my mother-in-law (who had one but when she traded in her car she forgot to take it out) and one for my husband who is a firefighter. I just feel better knowing my loved ones have someone watching over them."
4.0,"This mask looks and fits great, the material looks and feels sturdy and professional. It fits on to your face well but if you put it on your nose correctly it is a little hard to breathe. This can be adjusted to avoid this. It's is definitely of good quality and can't fit larger people just fine."
4.0,"First off, these are thick. For throttle control and operating flashers they feel disconnected. You have to grip the throttle extra tight to keep it from rolling back. As for the warmth, I made it 100 miles at 75mph in 35 degree temp before it started getting uncomfortable. I’m not sure the perfect winter glove exists but at this price it’ll do. I will say that these big goofy gloves are the most precise for touchscreen I have ever experienced. I was not expecting that I could actually type out a message with them."
4.0,"Really cute selection of earrings. Comes kind of scattered in a box, so the presentation isn't great, but if you don't care about that they're super cute earrings for not much money."
4.0,"Bigger than I excepted, but not to big. Does what I need it to do, and still have room for more without being too thick in my pocket."
4.0,"Just received this in mail. It is all blue not mostly red like shown in picture, the package sticker even says red. I dont care about the color thou. My 20mo old wears size 2T so I ordered the small (size 2-3) and am glad I didn't go up a size (thinking to fit hoodie or bulky clothing underneath) as it is pretty large on him. Overall satisfied with it, it is nice and my LO will get a lot of use out of it for at least a year or even more. He loves paw patrol and was excited when I tried it on him."
4.0,the hat is very well made sounds amazing will by from this seller again stands by there word and product
4.0,leg run a little smal
4.0,This necklace is pretty but it should be a little bigger.
4.0,Very cute. The tie dye is beautiful. They are fluffy and comfy. Fit trie to size. I rate them 4 as the soles are bit flimsy.
4.0,"It's a super cute shirt , but an xl was a little more snug than I expected ."
4.0,love that  they in gold rather than silver!
4.0,"I loved everything about the dress. Note that the back is open so you will need to not wear a bra, or it will show.  The slip was also sewn a little oddly to the dress so it would rise a bit. The color is lovely, the dress is flowy and graceful."
4.0,These earrings are very pretty and I love the length
4.0,"This is a really cute leotard! It fit well, it's a great quality and my daughter says it's comfortable. The sparkles on the top are not as sparkly in person as they are in this photo. They are little more black and you can't see the other colors that you can in this photo. Those might show up if she where on stage or under different lights, but they are a little more dull in person than is shown in this photo. With that being said, it's a really cute leotard and I would still buy it again! It's one of my daughters favorites."
4.0,"They are broken. They look very pretty but one of the earrings is broken, it won't latch at the back and therefore can't be worn.:( I received them today. I have been able to fix the latch issue, so I can wear it."
4.0,really nice but too small
4.0,Received lots of Compliments on the Floral Print.  Very comfortable style.
4.0,"The top is a little shorter than what the picture appears it to be.  My daughter is going to wear it with a camisole under it, but she does love the outfit!"
4.0,these are beautiful but very heavy
4.0,"Good quality shirt, better suited for the fall or winter in my opinion."
4.0,Straps not made too well
4.0,"Almost perfect. Must put a 3mm lift in one of my shoes. It changes things for that shoe. Can not be perfect, but these are good shoes. I am happy with them. Thank you!"
4.0,I'm pleased with the item
4.0,So far so good. Its roomy but not real bulky.  I carry alot in my wallet's and stash money. And its great. Only beef is the button is realy hard to snap together so i dont bother with it.
4.0,"The jeans themselves are nice and seem to be made well however, the color isn’t what it shows in the picture. It shows a lighter wash in the jeans on the front thigh area which isn’t there on the 2 pairs I received."
4.0,Very well made. Would recommend to anyone.
4.0,They are comfy but a lot thinner than expected
4.0,My husband likes it and usually he doesn't use keychains. It's very simple. He drives a truck for a living so I happy to come across this gift for him.<br />I would've given 5 stars if the connector between the keychain and keyring was sturdier. Still a great buy though.
4.0,These are great pants but more expensive than they should be but I really wanted some more pairs. They fit well and are comfortable.
4.0,"Not a bad looking watch. However, the watch did display a time and date that was completely wrong. Not a big deal but it made me think it hasn't been touched in months. The reason why I'm returning this watch though is that the second hand doesn't really line up with each tick on the watch. I think I'll dish out a little bit more money for a higher quality watch."
4.0,they are very pretty and petite.
4.0,"Beautiful dress! I bought it to wear this summer in Vienna, Paris and Italy. I’m 5’8” and a US size 14/16 and an XL fit perfectly. I’m only giving it 4 stars because it’s incredibly see-through. You will definitely need to wear a slip. Otherwise, it’s a gorgeous dress."
4.0,"The skirts are beautiful, just thin fabric."
4.0,"These are the very fist compression pants I bought and am thankful to past reviews for recommendations of size to buy.  These are European sizes and tend to run small, so I bought XXL and they fit well. I am 6'-4"" and a waist of 34-36."
4.0,I bought these for my grandmother. I'll buy her anything to make me feel she's a little bit safer or more comfortable. This does both. She thought there little lights were cool and she can see at night. There lights automatically come on when it is too dim or dark. She says they are very comfortable. They've replaced her old pair she's used. One of the lights stopped working I'm not sure why. They do use a watch battery I should check to see if it is dead. I'm happy with my purchase.
4.0,"Comfortable enough, good price."
4.0,These are basically exercise pants with butt pockets to make them look a little more dressy for everyday wear.  The color is not at all brown like they were supposed to be.  I’m not sure what color you would call them.
4.0,"The quality of the plastic is great but really when I saw an msrp sticker on it for $1.50, I felt really dumb for the price I paid. Just being honest because I would have liked to have known this. Compare to or you save price is completely incorrect."
4.0,"Overall well made, a little bit short to fit my electric toothbrush, but still works.<br />Thank you!"
4.0,the top is of good quality but it size runs a slight bit larger than expected.
4.0,"Didn't realize that the data on the side of the band would be in metric, dumb American. The band fit perfectly and went on easily, nice finish."
4.0,"It is a bit small for my taste, however, I really like this item. I have two male cats and I love my boys. I plan to hang it on a good sterling silver chain and wear it all the time. Very happy with my purchase."
4.0,"in my opinion  I liked it a lot. you will see things red but it protects you from the powerful beams of the sun. if you drive you will have problems seeing the red light. some colors appear to be different. but its good, ilove it."
4.0,No opening in front
4.0,I love this necklace. It is amazing
4.0,"Although the earrings were bigger than I expected and I returned them, the quality of the product was excellent just not appropriate for the person to whom I was giving them.  The return was handled in a timely fashion and I was credited for the full amount of the purchase.  I would order from Grantodo again in the future."
4.0,🤟
4.0,The lens was a little longer to change them.  I did like color very much.
4.0,Fits a little funny around my ears- I think it’s because the elastic band is thicker than what I’m used to. But it gets the job done
4.0,"Came on time, undamaged. However, the color is a bit off. It's a lighter purple with hints of white, with no yellowish splotches or dark purple tints. Little sad there not darker and yellow mix bit they're still nice."
4.0,The jacket is comfortable and fits fine. I typically wear between M and L and ordered the large. The feel is slightly fitted. An XL may be preferable if you want a little more room. I like the hood and fleece lining. I don't care for the belt. It's not very figure flattering. At least not on me. The coat kept me warm in the 45-50 degree weather this week here in NM. I'm not sure about the lower temps yet. overall it's a nice coat.
4.0,"This dress is comfy and cute, but the red isn't red so much as it's pink. It's not as bright as fuchsia, but it's definitely not red which is what I really wanted. I'll keep it, but I'm disappointed."
4.0,Love the sweater shirt. Nice trolling tool. Vivid colors.
4.0,"ordered for 10 month old son. its a little big on him, but expected that since items are for older children. looks great on him"
4.0,get a size up! it’s pretty tight- ESPECIALLY on the boobs. but it’s super cute!
4.0,Firstly I love this dress it's not too short. However the way it hangs off of me is terribly unflattering. I put a brown belt around my waist and it's perfect
4.0,Love this blouse. Good for office/causal wear. Item arrived on time and packaging was good.
4.0,I love my black cat named Dustpan. I found this charm to confirm my love. I think I'll make a charm bracelet of all cat and kitty charms! How adorable!
4.0,"I use these for my Monroe piercing because I do not have to constantly worry about the front coming unscrewed. It can be slightly difficult to remove and put back in, but the stress-free wear is worth it. If being used for a Monroe, it will be pressed against your lip; it won't pop out like the longer bars do. I would highly recommend these for people with children for mouth piercings, as there is no worry of metal hitting/chipping a tooth."
4.0,"Cute, comfy shirt.  It washed well but I hung it up to dry for fear of shrinkage on top.  This shirt is made from two different materials.  The top is a thicker tshirt type material and the ruffle tiers are a bit see through.  This covered my mom belly and is flowy and cool on a hot day.  I'm 5'3, usually wear a 14 and the xl fit me.  It falls exactly wear I want it to.  I wish they had more colors but I'll likely get the black soon."
4.0,"An understated, simple but sophisticated addition.<br />The clasp is very small, so I'm still wearing it since trying it on as I'll need someone with very good eyesight to unclasp it for me.<br />My one complaint might be is the packaging.  It did indeed come in a little jewelry box, but in the box the necklace was in a small plastic bag and the chain was tangled.  It took me about 20 minutes to untangle, but I'm glad I didn't give up on it."
4.0,"Very cute print . Material is thin but soft I like that because I live in warmer climate. I usually take women's small so I ordered large its fitted but I like that if you want it looser then size up again but I like my tops form fitting. This shirt is white so a little see thru but I don't mind that either. The delivery of item is very fast, faster then amazon ships to Hawaii."
4.0,This is a very attractive dress however it runs a little on the Large side as I am Unfamiliar with the designers and had I known that the dresses ran a little bigger I would have gotten a size smaller but I would recommend This dress to anyone just come down in size and yes I would buy from them again.  I like it so well I may give this one to a friend and order a size down for myself. This is a great looking dress for backyard barbecues or other outdoor functions.
4.0,"Soft, washable. Thick toe seam but otherwise these are awesome!"
4.0,Great. Would have given 5 stars but the post was bent and I’m afraid to bend it back. Get lots of compliments when I wear them.
4.0,"I love them but, they are somewhat oversized."
4.0,it fits really well but the look ended up being a little different than i expected but still a good dress
4.0,Husband really likes these.
4.0,"They are very soft and very stretchy. All around good quality for the price... HOWEVER I bought the skull and crossbones printed ones and the print is upside down so they lose a star for that. It's honestly kinda funny, but I unfortunately do not possess the upper body strength to walk on my hands all day so I will be trying to return them."
4.0,Came on time feels comfortable on the skin.. Looks well made.. Hardly kn its dere on u.. Can't give a 5 star cause I haven't worn it fr more than a day
4.0,"I am 5'7"" and 200 lbs right now. Lately I have found most L size clothes fit just right or are only slightly large. Based on other orders I selected an XXL for this dress and it fits perfect. As you can see from the picture the top is completely sheer you would need something thr same black as the dress or skin colored underneath to make it look good. Overall it is very cute I would just keep in mind the small sizing and be prepared with a cute bra or undershirt."
4.0,"Very cute dress. Beautiful colors, love the pockets, flowy and comfy for hot weather. Only thing I don't like is that the fabric billows on the sides and makes one look 1000xs wider. If I'm sitting, or I keep my hands in my pockets or to my side it's fine. Overall its cute."
4.0,Not made as well as should be
4.0,Bought this for my son and he loves it great buy.
4.0,"I brought this item for my wife as a gift.  The material on this item was nice and when put the shirts on she seemed to be pleased. I liked the it came in a set of three, with the beautiful different colors.  It must be very comfortable because for awhile it was her go to shirts for leisure. And the price was very good, for three shirts."
4.0,Purse came on time and was as described but was a little to big for the wife.
4.0,"This is exactly what i was looking for, a simple cotton hoody. The stories around here still have summer clothes and I wanted it for a trip. It arrived quickly and fits well."
4.0,"I love Kate Spade! Always high quality! The box this came in was adorable. The band slid down and out without much effort at all. I felt like it was easy to install on my watch and it felt secure while wearing it. The color is PHENOMENAL! The purple is the perfect shade. Not too loud, not too pastel. I've had tons of compliments on the scalloped shape of the edges and how it gives my apple watch a sophisticated boost. My only complaint is that the band is a little stiff. It keeps it from being truly comfortable and it kind of rubs on my wrist bone a little bit (it could be my bony wrists...). I had a hard time putting it on tight enough the first few times I put it on.<br /><br />Overall this is super stylish, adorable, and pretty competitively priced for a designer band. I think the band will break in with more use so I would say it's definitely worth the purchase!"
4.0,"I am a pretty solid 8 and this fits pretty good, its a little wide in the waist and chest (I have a small chest) - the color is not as vintage-ey as it appears, but will be cute to transition from summer to fall with boots and a cardigan."
4.0,"Very good material, strong"
4.0,It’s cute and fits well. But the pants are very thin. I feel like it wouldn’t last after a couple of washes. But it’s cute so I’ll take my chances.
4.0,I got these for work and because I have been a Shox fan since middle school.
4.0,Fits well. The cz stud is a bit larger than I like.
4.0,"Not bad.  Close to the type I like (no longer made by ANYONE.  The cup in between the boobs is a little wrinkly when tried on, but gets the job done once it's actually been put to use.  Came with free matching panties!  Thank you to the predecessors who suggested a full size up for these.  It's still very snug.  But functional, and almost as cute as similar ones with bikini straps for layering.  The bigger size issue is why I went with 4 stars.  Anyone forgetting to read that will be disappointed.  I could have used a half inch more around the body.  The cup isn't as sturdy looking.  We'll see if it's washable. Do NOT DRY these in dryer..  they say NO MACHINE WASH.  I'll be washing them in gentle cycle, then hang dry (as far as my recent replicas of the bras by Victoria Secret (discontinued) Aalso from HerRoom's Whisper u wire bra, they all wash up nice.<br />Order a size up!  Oh yeah, they aren't as transparent as the photos here.  Which is perfect, in my opinion.  I'll order more if they aren't discontinued first :)"
4.0,Receive broken can't used it
4.0,"I'm glad that I read the size description. You should go up one size unless you want this super, super tight. Good quality and feels really soft. This will be great for layering in the winter. I travel a lot from colder to warmer climates and this works great. Will buy more."
4.0,"I was surprised by these. As a plus size woman, I never expected them to actually fit my thigh and they did! They didn't have that over-stretched look nylons sometimes have and the color was spot on to the picture. And they keep shape and don't get over stretched."
4.0,The sleeve kept sliding off.
4.0,"Fits perfectly but once it was tried on it just didn't look right on me. Beautiful color but just had to return,"
4.0,"This is a well made satchel. It checked off so many boxes - alas it's too heavy and too large for my petite frame. Matt & Nat do a terrible job of providing specs for their purses --so this could have been avoided. The purse looked more like a briefcase on me than I wanted it to. It did comfortably fit a 13 inch slim laptop, phone, notebook, small package, a ball jar, a make up bag etc. So if you're looking for a tote that will safely carry all your work accouterments, this is it. I liked the look of just carrying it by the handles vs the (non ergonomic) crossbody/long strap, but it was just too heavy."
4.0,"I like the product, but they need to let the buyer know the thickness of the shoelaces as they are too big to go through the upper eyelets of my boots."
4.0,Beautiful bracelet! Only draw back is it needs a stoppers so the pendent does not slide around to the bottom all the time.
4.0,Got this for my pre-teen and she loves it. It has padding in the bust and is overall a great quality bathing suit. Get it!
4.0,Good cloth. Good size
4.0,"So far so good.  The stretch band is a little bit tight on my husband's wrist...hoping it will stretch a bit with use.  Came with the current EST preset, so did not have to deal with set-up.  Time will tell regarding the reliability of the watch.  But, as I said, so far so good"
4.0,This item was perfect but should come in length sizes like petite.
4.0,Cute and very light! it looks just like the picture.
4.0,"I'm not sure yet of its status in my bra collection. I was looking for something with a racer back for my sun dresses and summer tops. This is lovely, but please know before you buy it, it's more padded than you think in cup area. I live in a hot and humid area, and so it's also a bit hot to wear when it's 90* plus outside and also high humidity. I find it to be well made, easy to wear, good fit, just made of a lot of polyester and nylon, so you will sweat in this if wearing it outside. It is vey true to size, I'm a petite person, so the band area underneath cups is wide for me, but offers great protection and lift."
4.0,a little big for a 4 yr old but it works.
4.0,Nice band. Might be a half a link too small but It was properly described and I didn’t want it to be loose when all the links compress. It does tend to cause some wrist sweating  gien the fit.
4.0,need size m
4.0,Outstanding but needs to be made out of heavier metal.  was bent on the first trip
4.0,"I bought these tank tops for my pre-teen daughter to wear seeing that the weather was getting warmer. When it came, we opened the package and was so amazed at the 12  bright and beautiful colors. The fabric to my surprise was very stretchy and soft. She tried them on immediately, and loved them. The fit was very comfortable and the material is not too thin or too thick. Perfect for layering or wearing as is. At first I was worried about them being too small, but decided to order a size large, which I'm glad I did, because I tried one on and let me tell you the fit is great especially for being on the busty side. I have a habit of washing my clothes before wearing and have to say that these tops did not bleed or lose its stretch even after drying.  I will be ordering some for myself. These tops are worth the buy but just remember to order a size up. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"It's way thin and picks easily. Also comes with NO washing instructions.. Good luck.. However, I wear it often to work and it was well worth the $8."
4.0,Fit exactly as expected per size ordered.  The white dots were missing from the image print but overall it was pretty nice.
4.0,Heavy duty and locks really to suitcase.
4.0,Not a bad deal. I needed some tshirt bras to wear when I'm home or doing house work. I like the colors and price. I know they aren't $50 and you get what you pay for but they do the job
4.0,Was just what I wanted ... Nothing special
4.0,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday and have since purchased a few pairs to keep in his car and mine as well as his luggage because he loves it so much. This pair of sunglasses is sturdy and has UV protection, which makes it a great value. It has held up well through everyday use and travel. He has used his first pair for about two years and has not had to adjust/tighten/tweak it. Would recommend!"
4.0,Ran very big! A good belt though!
4.0,"It’s super cute dress, only thing I could complain about is it runs somewhat large. My size between S to M, and normally I order M just to be safe, but since they didn’t have M, I ordered S to give it a shot. I was worrying that I wouldn’t fit, but it’s little bit larger. But quality and the way suits you are amazing!"
4.0,"Definitely a good short term fix. Seeing as I'm 6'4&#34; these straps are almost at their limit. This can cause issues if I bring my leg up and rest it on my opposite knee. Because of the plastic teeth they do a great job of not destroying your shirt but are also more prone to slippage if stressed. All in all, it's a good product but not great. For a more permanent fix, I recommend sewing buttons into your belt-line for proper suspenders."
4.0,"It's comfortable, I wish the neck line was a bit lower and it would have been 5 stars. It's very fitted so if you don't want clingy then I would suggest ordered a size up. I usually pair this with tights underneath but as shown in pic you can wear it as a dress. You could really dress it up with the right accessories but I have just used it as a more casual outfit."
4.0,Very pretty 4 stars because runs large
4.0,"These are adorable, but they’re huge. I prefer a smaller style. But they’re nicely made for the price and I got them quickly."
4.0,For the money it is a good value; looks nice. Make sure you don't size item too small when place in pocket or it will slide down due to material.
4.0,"These earrings are adorable and look just as displayed on  the model.  I couldn't big it 5 stars for a few reasons.  1. They took a bit longer than expected to arrive, so I couldn't use them for the event I purchased them for and 2. The backing was bent.  I am afraid to unbend it because I didn't want it to break."
4.0,"The item is very nice, maybe a bit cheap looking but for what I paid I feel I got a great product."
4.0,Gift that is being enjoyed very much.
4.0,"I am 5'10""and 135lb, and I ordered a size Medium. It fits perfectly for work - form fitting but not too tight. The material is mildly stretchy and would fit a slightly more curvy person (but I'm only 34"" bust and 35"" hips). It also has the boob seam on each size of the chest which makes it look nicer quality than it is. And the color is true to the product pictures. BUT the pictures are slightly misleading; it is mostly black squares but every 4th or 5th vertical line, it skips a line and forms rectangles as seen in my photos. And the side stich on the right side bunches a little bit, but is only detectable if you stare at it from close range.<br /><br />Overall its very unique and still professional, I love it!! :)<br />I give the dress alone a 3.5 out of 5, but if you factor in the more than fair price, it's almost 5 out of 5. Averaged score 4.5/5."
4.0,Great style! Not the best quality!
4.0,mostly the comfort - 2nd pair - wore out the first pair.
4.0,"Fits as expected, great quality! Comfortable, not too hot. Only con is the visor doesnt come out/down far enough.  Should come out atleast<br />another inch to be more effective."
4.0,"Bought these for my 3 year old nephew. He needed water shoes.  He actually wore them, approved the color and was comfortable jumping in puddles.  Great choice for park sprinklers."
4.0,"This is a nice fall dress. The material is not stretchy, but that's OK because it camouflages trouble areas. Cute with a belt."
4.0,"This is such a cute ring.  I didn't notice the wings on the cat, but they're not bad.  I don't know how I missed it in the picture.  It was a great stocking stuffer!"
4.0,"I like the material, but the birds are upside down. The nose piece ended up on my chin. I don't care much, but it would have been nice to have it right."
4.0,"This dress fit as expected. It is a very conservative look that didn't quite suit my body. I didn't care for the bowtie belt.. Thought it was removable, but it's pretty secured and would mess up dress if you try to remove it. Otherwise, it's very comfortable and would make a great bridesmaid dress."
4.0,This is the perfect size handbag for me.  It has so many convenient pockets to organize belongings.  The style is very appealing and with two strap lengths it can adjust to just about everyone's preference.  It also comes in several different colors which is nice.  It is well made with double rivets on the sides and easy release clasps to change handles.  The only disadvantage is the zippers.  The teeth are very course and often catch when trying to open or close.
4.0,"Very pretty, but its bigger than I thought it would be. Order your regular size and it should fit."
4.0,Pretty good nose rings. A few are a lil crooked but overall nice. Not too long not too short. The picture makes it look like there are more than there is. When you open package there aren't any rings behind the front label.
4.0,"Well like other reviews quite a few didn't light up or was flickering. The ones that did work were awesome! Some still work almost a year later, though we didn't use them very long."
4.0,"This is a hybrid between a money clip and a wallet. It opens up like a traditional bifold wallet but has a metal money clip attached to one end. It is an interesting combination because the money clip is pretty thick/bulky, and you wouldn't want to sit on it with it in your back pocket. I also place my cell phone and money clip together in my front pocket, which I wouldn't want the metal clip rubbing again my phone.<br /><br />Outside of the design choice, the wallet is well constructed and has a nice leather feel. If the use case works for you, this would be a nice reliable wallet."
4.0,So cute ! But just know that this type earring really requires that you wear the little plastic backing piece because they could easily fall out
4.0,These socks really helped with getting the fluid off my legs after my preterm birth due to pre eclampsia. I due recommend ordering a size up though.
4.0,"I generally wear an XL top and a 16 jeans.  I bought this in an XL and I LOVE it.  I ordered the red and it's a great color.  I would give this 5 stars however, the neckline has a defect.  It isn't a straight line as shown in the picture.  If I wear my hair down with the sweater it's not noticeable so I will be keeping it."
4.0,"A little tight to put on, needs to be a lighter material"
4.0,"Love the talking feature although it can be a little embarrassing when the talk button is accidentally pushed. Changing the battery is a bit of a challenge.<br />Did not buy it because of low vision. I like the so called ""atomic watch"" feature."
4.0,very cute and worked great for my daughter's 40's Swing dance. It ran a little big in the top so we had to pin it.
4.0,"Cute, lightweight top.  Would of gave 5 stars, but it runs a bit small."
4.0,They fit a little wierd but you get what you pay for. Good lenses
4.0,This dress is pretty and it fits really well. It’s a little short but decent. The color was a little off from the picture but I still like it.
4.0,The print is great. They are more capris than they are &#34;pants&#34;. I'm 5'8&#34; and they fall between knee and calf. I wish they were longer.
4.0,Cute but material stains easy
4.0,Material is thin but not see through. Mostly suitable for lounging. Elastic was a bit uncomfortable for me as it is tight around the waist. But I'm satisfied with the overall fit and look of this product so giving it 4 stars.
4.0,Love the black and gold look!
4.0,Where are pants for shorter people! Once hemmed 6” I always lose pattern at bottom!
4.0,Fabric is a little thinner than I expected but I like the dress. Fits true to size.
4.0,Likes the colors and mostly the value can't beat the price.
4.0,Honestly these wings feel super cheap but surprisingly they didn’t break when I wore them. Considering how inexpensive they are I think it was worth the money. Really pulled my Halloween costume together. My arms fit comfortably through the straps but I’m kind of small so if you are a taller/bigger person I’m not sure I’d recommend.
4.0,"they aren't top quality, but they will due for the season. The main boot shell seems very thin to me. Good for the price."
4.0,Works very well and happy I got it.
4.0,I liked this package very much. I bought it to give as a gift. The recipient liked it very much.
4.0,"LOL im a 36DD and it was kind of like a “im pretty sure this wont work but lets try” type of thing. I was right. Its comical that i thought my boobs would just defy gravity. If you have A-C boobs, i would say you have a chance of this working. It looked 100% ridiculous on me and wouldnt do anything pasties couldnt do. The only way i could see it working for me is if the adhesive were all over the inside and the clear straps on the side also touched the side of the boob part of the bra too. Then.. maybe.  Still might be asking too much of physics. Four stars because its not the sellers fault. But they probably also shouldnt even hint that it could work for D boobs or bigger."
4.0,I purchased a size 6y since that's my shoe size for all Jordan's but this one came a bit big.
4.0,"Color is black.... Looks like charcoal grey.<br />Overall, very nice shirt!"
4.0,Using it daily. Hope it is doing what it is suppose to. It would be very nice if it had a key ring attached. I miss that convenience.
4.0,They fit and work great.  They are not as thick as factory Oakley kits but I don't have an opinion on how long they will last.<br /><br />They were priced right and fit the glasses so a good purchase experience.
4.0,"Because of the packaging, the cord which is very stiff got out of shape and I had to hang a heavy weight on it to straighten it out.  Otherwise, it lives up to the picture.  I would have preferred it if the cord were a little softer and less stiff."
4.0,This product was the exact size and style I was looking for! Very pleased!!
4.0,for the price it is okay. not big just kind of look like woman's glasses.
4.0,Very thick and warm . Fits snug on your feet and I like the color variety. You can look stylish in the fall/winter with your freshly polished toes and reasonably priced pedi-sox.
4.0,"Good fit, but material is thin. The color is beautiful!"
4.0,Its fit well.....I like it
4.0,I returned it because it is long for me 😊
4.0,"Super cute even though it came and was a little too small. Gave it to my little sister, and she loves it since it's cute and warm."
4.0,not to good
4.0,These are so cute but when you store them in an enclosed space like a drawer or jewelry box they have an overwhelming chemical oder. You don’t smell it when wearing them.
4.0,"They are very comfy, for sure,  but they also seem a bit &#34;see through&#34;. I don't feel comfortable wearing them in public, so I wear them to bed or just around the  house. I bought Khaki. Reminds me of a light gray color. I could see me buying another pair but a darker color"
4.0,My daughter wears a slim so these were perfect for her. We ended up buying in every color.  She wears them under all her dresses they are like velvet lined tights - they are not pants meant to wear without something long covering the top of the leggings.  They are so soft and she loves them! However after having these for a month or so - they do pill quite a bit. I have washed them inside out and that seems to help but the navy and maroon ones are noticiceably pilling badly. The black green and gray ones (Gray is very dark gray hard to decipher from black) are being washed inside out and are looking good due to that.
4.0,Upgrade to the original band
4.0,Fits true to size<br />Comfy
4.0,Great quality! I read a lot of comments that said this fit too tight - it fit my daughter perfectly. Would totally recommend.
4.0,"Alright, these serve their purpose; I used them for a 5K, and loved to have a ring.  The only issue I found was with the colored one, I thought I'd like it because it looked the closest to my white gold ring, but after a couple hours of wearing it, the color was rubbing off on everything and the ring looked patchy.  The black and dark grey ones are awesome though and used one at an OCR."
4.0,Really pretty and comfortable. Band was slightly snugger than other bras in that same size.
4.0,Like the fit and it's a man's sock so it is ok to wear in public.
4.0,Good quality and looks nice on.
4.0,They were bigger than we thought but she loves them!
4.0,"Reading some of the reviews for this top made me a little skeptical. Once I received it and tried it on I fell in love. The fabric is soft and stretchy. I ordered a large and it fits a little loose, but looks nice. I would recommend this top."
4.0,like the option with the hidden zipper...
4.0,"Good fit, like the pocket!"
4.0,These fit as expected. They have good grip in the shower. They are comfortable to wear and do exactly what you would want them to do.<br /><br />Good value.
4.0,"I like this tunic very comfortable and casual with leggings. The only minus is that the pattern if off center in the front which is annoying. I decided to keep it, but probably won't purchase any more because of the pattern."
4.0,"The butterfly is nice, but small...and the chain is thin...you get what you pay for. That's why I gave it a 4."
4.0,"This pretty little shell is very noticeable on it's black leather like cord.  I would say it's more of a choker but looser, not tight neck fitting.  Sturdy clasp"
4.0,Fun stocking stuffer gifts. Big hit
4.0,My son likes it. Even though others tell him tilted towers is gone from Fortnite 🙂
4.0,"I really like this shirt, it's super soft, comfortable, and the print stays perfect through the washer and dryer, but the print isn't quite as detailed or colorful as I had hoped."
4.0,Love the design but they fit a little narrow on the side of the head.
4.0,I loved the watch but the little plastic piece that holds the band in place broke rather too soon and you can't find a replacement piece in that color.
4.0,As expected. Good for the price.
4.0,For men’s socks they run small I have a size 6 foot and they fit me perfect. They are pink and black and don’t slid off. Warm as well
4.0,"I love the look, it's very pretty. The only draw back is it can be a little difficult to screw on."
4.0,"I just received my shipment today and it was right on time, I would give a 5 stay rating however we got all 24 bracelets but was short 1 purple pin in the package, it states 12 pins but only got 11, if someone could contact me to resolve this I would be happy to give a 5 star rating thank you"
4.0,"This is a very nice necklace. I don't like the cord it came on because the knots fall right to the side of my neck and show. I am planning on buying a different cord to hang it from. Otherwise, I liked this item and will wear it often."
4.0,"It's an adorable print with a semi-fair quality grade material. The bow in the front is flimsy but overall it's serves it's purpose for an average church day. If we were attending a wedding, I'd go with a better quality dress."
4.0,"Good fit, looks like the photo, and was what I expected. I think the bottoms might be a little tight if you got a bit of a booty though hahaha! All in all I’m happy with it!"
4.0,Exactly what I needed and well made.
4.0,"Cheap party favors, but didn't break like I was anticipating."
4.0,"The wine color is actually brighter than what the picture shows. It's more of a berry red. I'm a size xs with a small chest and this fits a bit loose but it falls nice on my body still. It's not too big of a fit so I decided to keep it. Just wish it fit more snug. The fabric is also flowing and soft. It's polyester but doesn't have a cheap look at all, it does look nice"
4.0,Love the color and style of the dress. There was a lot of extra thread hanging from the hem. A little more prepping and mending than I expected for the price paid.
4.0,They do their job pretty well.
4.0,"Bought this in Large and I can definitely say it's fitted, I think the US would consider this size a Medium+.. If you want a comfortable fit, get a size larger."
4.0,"I really wanted to like this!! I have bought so many waist trainers and i can’t seem to find one comfortable enough<br /> Figured I’d give this a try and i like the concept! It kept rolling up on me though. I’ve tried adjusting the way i put it on see if I can wear it without issue, but it still just rolls up!"
4.0,I'm 6'6&#34;+ 250lbs and the 2XL(52) fits great. My arms are 37&#34; and the sleeves fit well. Quality is great for the price especially on Prime. Will use this for club garrison patches. 2XL is 50 & 52 - I originally bought the 50 and it was a little snug. Returned for 52.
4.0,"I am 170lbs and 5'5 usually wear a 10/12(ish) I am 36DD and this suit fit amazingly! Its super cute, my only reason for giving it a 4 star is due to the coloring in the top. The halter strap is bright white, while the white in between the red lines looks almost cream/yellowish.... it was literally the FIRST thing i noticed when i opened the box, but my trip is next week, and i don't have time to return it to get a new one. You can't really tell when its on, I might just be OCD. Otherwise fits great, I bought an XL, which is one size above where i would normally order."
4.0,"Item as described. Did not come in a case, just wrapped in plastic so if giving as a gift you may want to wrap it in something."
4.0,Does not keep fingers warm in 20 degrees but supposed to keep warm up to -20 degrees.
4.0,"These aren't average jogging pants.  The main attraction is the lack of eleastic at the ankle that likes to crawl up your leg during all forms of activity. In its place is a collar. Sort of. But whatever marvel of fashion it is known by, it doesn't move from where it belongs. They are comfortable to sleep. Have no worries these babies will keep you warm if the apacolypse happens and there's no heat.<br /><br />You can even where them to Walmart and not worry about someone snapping a photo of you to splash all over social media.  The manly bits don't sweat, and there are pockets enough to carry what you need.  The wallet in its typical position of the back pocket, and front pockets for keys and other manly stuff.<br /><br />They run true to size with an all over comfortable fit.  I was provided this product free of charge in exchange for an unbiased and honest review. I have no relationship to the seller and I received no compensation."
4.0,I like that the dress can be casual and special occasion.
4.0,Good product for price ... order larger size than you normally would
4.0,"I like this style a lot, and may purchase in the future."
4.0,"Pants are nice and thick enough to where you can't see through them. Definitely a tight fit, only draw back is they run small. I'm a curvy size 14, got an XL, fits below my waist. I had to keep pulling them up, I'll try to see a thicker elastic on the waist to see if that would help? Otherwise, I love them and will purchase again"
4.0,"Gloves are comfortable and warm, made very well, only issue is they are hard to get off."
4.0,Cute top! Order size down though
4.0,"The size on these leggings are a S/M...but I think they are more like a Small!!  I am 5'4'', 113 pounds, and they fit me just right.  Also, the fabric is thinner than it looks.  Cute style though!"
4.0,"I went according to reviews and ordered the Large/X Large whereas I always order Medium. It fits well enough that I can wear it but the legs and the arms are a bit too short for where they need to be, but I can live with it. This is more like a lounge set, rather than a pajama, but in the winter nights it will be perfect, too.  It is really  very beautiful - the colour (I got green which is like sea moss), the lace, good quality and the softness. I am very happy to have found this, but it is sad that it doesn't fit exactly the way it should. It doesn't look bad though, just a little short, but I was aware it may be.  thank you!"
4.0,I usually wear a size 4 shirt and ordered the extra small. It fits ok but is roomier than I usually like in a workout shirt.
4.0,"Everything about the mask is great, minus one little thing! The backs of the gems aren't covered, so they poke into the face a bit. Other than that, it's great!"
4.0,Fun gloves were great for a Halloween party I went to. Fit well and no quality issues.
4.0,Nice dress but first of all it is NO where near formal so I'm not sure why it says that. Also the sleeves are capped NOT 3/4. But the return was pain free so that was a pleasant surprise.
4.0,"I have tons of brands and colors of boot cuffs, and this pair has turned out to be one of my favorite pairs. They're delicate and look sexy, as their product description implies. They are thin, though, so they're really for looks and to be stylish, not at all to help keep your legs warm. I wish they were a little thicker, but they haven't shrank atvwhen machine washed and dried. They're very pretty and they match almost any outfit, especially when you are wearing brownn or tan boots. Overall, they're a good product at a reasonable price and I'm very happy with my purchase. I've received quite a few compliments when wearing them."
4.0,"They're a little big, but I love them!"
4.0,it is nice I thought it was going to be thicker but it does look exactly how the picture states. for the price it is a good buy.
4.0,It is a really nice tie! But it was a little short for my tall husband. But he loved it any way. He's 6'1''.
4.0,"I really liked the sweater. However, I wasn't a fan of the ""inside out"" looks so I just easily removed the tags and wore it with the hems on the inside rather that exposed on the outside. Overall great sweater, super comfy! I'm usually either a MED/LG depending on the fit and the medium fit perfect and still had room."
4.0,Cute masks that the kids had fun with.  The bands on a couple pulled off easily.  But otherwise they are what I expected.
4.0,GREAT COSTUME WAS HARD TO GET ON BUT IT IS WAS MY FAVORITE COVID COSTUME! THSI COSTUME STODE OIT AND I GOT MANY STARES FROM OTHER PEOPLE.
4.0,"I go between a medium and large, I decided on a medium. It fits, almost too good. Sleeves are a little tight but there is stretch so its not a big deal. I wonder if a large would look better but I'm just going to keep it. It will be cute for fall with leggings and boots."
4.0,The colors are not quite as vibrant in real life as they appear in the photo. But for the price this is a very fine tie.
4.0,Love it but see through.
4.0,Very good outfit. Nice material size fits as expected (I am 5’7 142 lbs got a medium) there is enough room to tighten or loosen the waist for more comfort. Very practical for travel with different color tops. 4 stars instead of 5 cause I think it’s overpriced.
4.0,"This necklace is nice but, in my opinion, shouldn’t be classified as a choker. It’s a 16” necklace. Unfortunately, the clasp doesn’t have an adjustable length chain. I like the look enough to keep it."
4.0,Love the slippers.  Ordered a 10 and it was too small. Had to stretch them out.  Now fit perfectly.
4.0,"I'm 5'1 110lbs and ordered an XS, and it fit exactly how I wanted. The dress is pretty simple, with elastic at the top and ribbons on the sleeves. The fabric is nice and thin, so it's a great dress for spring/summer. The only downside is the top, it's just elastic all the way around so it does come off your shoulders if you were to raise your arms. Regardless it's a great deal and a very cute dress for summer!"
4.0,"Loved this dress! Wore it to a wedding with a hat and some booties. I am 5'3 and about 200lbs so I did get an XXL, but it made it a bit longer and more comfortable but could have gotten an XL. I have a smaller waist but carry more of my weight in my butt and thighs so it was flattering for my figure but I would still recommend just trying it out. The color was so pretty, bought it in black too and one size smaller for a May wedding and just to have a go-to black dress for any occasion! Cannot beat the price, especially on short notice...way better than running out to Target for an overpriced dress or rummaging about T.J. Maxx or Marshall's."
4.0,These work good for my seven year old daughter. Keeps the water out and easy to adjust
4.0,Super cute I got so many compliments! The material is a little odd though. I got a small and it fit perfect.
4.0,"The material is thin, and the straps want to roll up. Cute shirt, my daughter likes it, but she will need to wear a tank top underneath for coverage (decency is required in our household)."
4.0,"I love Minkpink and the pattern/color of these shorts is so cute.  Unfortunately, I just didn't like the way these fit on me.  I like flowy shorts if they fall flat, but these seemed overall poofy and not slimming.  I bought the matching off shoulder top though, and I love it!"
4.0,"The ring is real 925 silver so you don’t have to worry about it turning your finger green, i bought this ring as a pinky ring, unfortunately they didn’t have the size I need at the time, the size I need was a 4 and a half so i bought a size five, so when i got it i brought it to the jewelry store to have it re-size the jeweler told me the ring was a five and a half so the rings are not true to size, so if u do order you one depending on what size ring you wear you might have to go a size up or a size down or take it to your local jewelers and have them re-size it for you ,if yours is the wrong size. But other than that it is a nice ring i had ordered me another one, so that a way i can get my name engraved on it since it is an Engravable ring."
4.0,"Pleasantly surprised. Watch looks great. Heavy<br />atch, but once on wrist, you hardly notice.<br />Looks more expensive than it is. While no moveable bezel, the tachymeter is on the chapter ring.<br />Seems to keep reasonable good time.<br />Things that bothered me. The dial is printed. And a slight misalignment with second hand and indices. Pressure rating could be better.<br />There offices are in Berlin, but watch was made in the.Republic of Georgia.<br />All in all, good knockabout watch. It's a good buy."

4.0,Not a gift
4.0,"We bought these beanies for Bay Area winter. Meaning it’s cold but not snow level cold. They’ve been great to wear out running, to bed at night, or around town. I think they’re advertised as a one size fits all - which more accurately should say fits an average male head. I’ve got a smaller female head and they sag lower on my brow. But I don’t mind as it helps keep my neck warm. They wash great and keep their color and shape (no shrinking). Great price for great product. We’re fans of them."
4.0,The color of these earrings are wonderful. They are a very rich emerald green. I like very much.
4.0,Love the way they feel and look
4.0,I bought this for my sister since we both are cancers. She got it in the mail and she loves it. I purchased the silver and got exactly that on time. It's a very pretty piece and looks awesome on her!
4.0,"These are super cute! I was nervous that they would appear super glittery and be too overwhelming for someone my age. However, I was pleased to see that the coating is actually clear, tiny, plastic balls that does truly provide a shimmer as the description reflected - no sparkles at all. The balls makes the boots appear a bit shiny, but not glittery. I asked my husband for a second opinion as to whether they were too overwhelming, to which he answered, &#34;Not at all. However, I thought they were supposed to be grey? These looks beige.&#34; Sure enough, he was right. Although they are considered &#34;Stormy Grey,&#34; they do appear to be more of a grey/beige mix, almost like the color of clay. I took off a star for this, because others might be upset when they receive these as they are not true grey. I was also a bit disappointed in the Ugg-pure lining. All my other Uggs have shearling lining in them, which I prefer. After only wearing these a few times, the lining is flattening out, and the boots actually feel like they're becoming too big, despite ordering my normal size. However, these cost much less than the other Uggs I have purchased (by about $60) , so it's certainly not a deal breaker; I'll just wear socks with them if I need to. Last, I do prefer rubber soles on my Uggs compared to the Treadlite these come with. The rubber soles provide more traction, where I've found myself slipping in these in places I normally wouldn't. I'm hoping with a bit more wear the traction will improve. Overall, I would recommend these boots to others. However, I don't think I would purchase them for a gift or for myself again in the future."
4.0,My son loves it. We both thought it would have been a bit heavier and not so thin but it is good quality. Great price for the product. I will order him another one soon.
4.0,Fit as expected...plan to buy more..
4.0,"For the price they are great. The only thing is the pants fit more like capri's vs. your standard pj bottoms. If you have a child with long legs, do not expect them to be ankle length!"
4.0,"Material is soft, but definitely thinner than I expected. Almost like thick panty hose and they are somewhat see thru, so I definitely recommend a long shirt to hide your rear. I'm 5'5"" and the leggings are way too long. I could easily do without the 3 or 4 inches that just bunches up around my ankles. Overall though, not a horrible purchase."
4.0,Fit is good. I just wish they’d let you pick the 3 colors. Since they don’t to get one more color you normally get 2 of a color you already have multiple of….I have enough black and grey.
4.0,"Nice, but It is a little bit large"
4.0,Keeps your cords organized. Simple.
4.0,Nice material but it runs small
4.0,They seem a bit flimsy but perfect for a few time uses and for a little fun.
4.0,"I liked the fabric and the ease of putting the mask on.  However, found them a little loose for me (female) and my husband did not feel they covered enough area.  He would have liked to see them more pleated and fit the nose and chin a little better."
4.0,"a little tight behind the ears, so constantly adjusting for comfort but otherwise a really great mask"
4.0,"I like these socks, they really don’t show in my low cut shoes and they are well-made. They’re just a little thin for me because my feet get cold easily."
4.0,"Not exactly what I expected. The top itself is cut in a strange way, hard to explain. When I took it out of the package one of the straps wasn't even sewn on, fortunately I know how to sew but who expects to have to sew a brand new shirt?"
4.0,Unable to adjust straps my feet are small
4.0,"Smaller than expected but still super cute and goes well with anything. Ky only real issue is the crystal is fake, clearly a plastic or glass."
4.0,It works and fits it's just my zipper keeps coming down back and forward it want stay zipped up
4.0,Only reason this is not a 5 star - after about 2 times removing out of my back pocket it has already started fraying where the ID plastic is. I bought two and both did this.
4.0,Better quality than I expected :)
4.0,Very good quality and nice fit
4.0,"Product was as expected and is exactly what  I needed. Not sure how long it lasts, but looks to be made of good quality leather."
4.0,Es lo q se ve... Pero no arma tan bien....
4.0,"These are VERY pretty and I do like them. However they are very small, much smaller than I thought they would be.  If you need a gift for a young girl or a very small adult, these would be good. They are too small for me and I will give them to someone who has a daughter with pierced ears. They are sterling and well-made and the detail is great, I just wish they were larger."
4.0,Perfect size for a little girl. Very easy to open and close
4.0,I absolutely love this belt. The color. The design.
4.0,Got these glasses to take hiking with me so I don't break my more expensive ones.  For the price they are surprisingly very nice.  They had clear lenses with no noticeable imperfections or cloudiness.  The frames where on the light side but where durable enough.  Worked well on the water and held up for the weekend of backcountry hiking without getting scratched up.
4.0,It snags and marks very easily! I really enjoy the loose fit and the light breathable material. Despite the snagging and marking I would recommend this product.
4.0,"These were so cute for the kids but the Rudolph one the nose wire is in the chin, it still works but will slip off their nose since the support is gone. My kids loved them still!"
4.0,"Not quite as pink as shown, but 6-yr-old granddaughter loves them and the whole idea of pink/rose gold."
4.0,I like that it is two toned.  Wish it had the panic button slot.  Doesn't have the key release slot (my keyshirt had one).  Feels higher quality than the keyshirt.  My keyshirt became so loose that it fell off and i lost it.
4.0,"I like this dress, it's simple, nice and hides my belly fats because of the color (which is black) and the design maybe. I love the fact that i can wear formally and casually. The only thing is it is somewhat big."
4.0,These adidas face covers are a little to thin...
4.0,"This is adorable!! I’m a size 8/10. I went with a medium. It’s a bit loose but do-able. Better a little big than a little small. I think a small would’ve been perfect. So if you’re a really small person I’m not sure how this would fit for you. It’s got a lot of stretch so if you’re on the fence, size down. There’s a zipper down the back which I didn’t have to unzip to easily take off and on. The hat is cute, and the feather was in perfect shape.<br /><br />I’m 5’3” and the front comes to mid-thigh, and the waist hits a little lower. I tied a black sash around my waist to give my waist more definition.  I was planning on little black shorts, but need them. It’s long enough.  amazing price.<br /><br />Would’ve given 5 stars if the fit was more accurate."
4.0,These earrings are of fantastic quality for the inexpensive price.  I would buy them again as gifts for my friends.
4.0,"I'm 5'4&#34; about 186 lbs, followed the measurements on the sizing chart and went with XL. Fits well and the material is a little stretchy but the only thing about the shirt that bothers me is the sleeves could have had a little more give. I have bigger arms and I find myself tugging the sleeves down back into place during the day. Over all though, I'm pleased with the product. **I took these pictures in the restroom at work, sorry for the background! Also, I know the back looks tight but it's not, it appears that way via the undergarments I have on. Maybe I need to find better undergarments ;)"
4.0,"Mask is nice, soft, comfortable, and adjustable....plus it's got a cool pic of Jack and Zero on it! That being said....you can breathe just fine thru the mask without an insert installed...and I would've given it 5 stars....but...the inserts are absolutely useless! I tried sealing my lips to an insert and breathing thru it...yeah! Right! Ain't happenin'! Like I said...useless. You might as well try to breathe through your mattress...or a stack of jeans! I'd rather get just the mask and pay half the price! Unless you're in need of a breathing exerciser of course. That which does not kill us makes us stronger! For those of you old enough to know....I think I'm gonna make a linoleum ""gun"" and have some fun shooting my friends in the butt with 'em! (Kidding.....) Seriously though, nice mask, but chuck the ""filters""...."
4.0,"Received as described. Unfortunately, ( my neck size is an 19&#34; to 19 1/2 &#34; )  therefore, I needed to cut the tie in half and added more material in the middle so that it would fit my neck. Additionally, as a suggestion ... They should also include instructions as to how to properly tie a formal bow tie."
4.0,This was an appropriate travel charm for the countries of Norway and Sweden. I am creating a travel bracelet but didn't want to buy expensive charms for it. This worked perfectly!
4.0,Very comfortable legging but keep sliding down
4.0,"Thin and a little cheaply made, but very cute and great for summer."
4.0,"I really like these bras. Feels comfortable and looks nice. I think for the price of buying 5 bras in a pack, it was worth it. Definitely recommend it unless you happen to dislike the removable pads in sports bra."
4.0,"Ordered it because it was cheap and bright, it fits nicely and makes me look cute but the top will straight up come off you because there's no way to adjust the tightness or add straps. It would be great for laying out and relaxing. Existing as a human outside of that, I would be hesitant unless you're cool with having everyone around you see your boo bees."
4.0,I like them as they do cancel noise. However they are tight on my head. I have been trying to stretch them by putting them over the arm of my chair. Right now I can only wear them a short time before they start hurting my head.
4.0,"It is really minimalist, but that might be exactly what you are looking for -- I was.<br />It is well-made.<br />Don't know how I would test the &#34;RFID-blocking&#34; so can't comment on that.<br />The only minor gripe is, with the absence of a &#34;thumb slider cut-out&#34; for the ID section, it can be a bit difficult to remove driver's license if an official wants to examine it separately.<br /><br />Sure is light and small. I use this one for traveling and keep the giant multi-folding wallet separate (with all the non-essential plastic)."
4.0,They slip on shoes are okay quality. A little cheap but I think they will hold up until he outgrows them. My son likes them a lot. However the sandals are hard plastic and my son doesn't even want to try them on. We tried sliding them on once but he has no interest in them whatsoever. They they look very uncomfortable and I would not want to wear them.
4.0,I bought this wallet to be used for secondary purposes and it works just fine. The fact that it can fit in my front pocket and not look bulky is definitely a plus.
4.0,"It's perfect for my Tik Tok ""@therealityhacker"" however I do note that the connection in the mask covered by the thin rubber sleeve has a short in it and the mask turned off. I was able to fix this issue but it might be a real nuisance for others not patient enough to fix a problem like this.. for it did take me some time and shortened the cord unfortunately."
4.0,"I spoke to an agent who helped me get a refund for the product.  She was helpful, only issued was i have to stay on the phone for a while, but it was worth it in the end.  I got my refund  for a pair of gold  earring  i bought that did not last for more than 3 months.  The post pushed in the hole and came apart."
4.0,"Hangs nicely on my body, good quality but a bit thin."
4.0,I like the lace underneath and it being wireless without looking to much like a sports bra.
4.0,"These are more like really super thick tights than what you think of for ""leggings"".  That said they fit well and other than the weird thing on the butt I really like them. Not a fan of the vertical band on the butt crack it just looks weird and doesn't really ""enhance"".  Color is nice, and they didn't roll down, which is always a plus. I'm only 5'2"" so they bunched at the ankles which is to be expected."
4.0,"What do you want me to say about a hat?  I liked the color, style and look.  Thats why I bought it."
4.0,"These are really nice neck gaiters, and very comfortable for summer wear. I have a ton of gaiters, since long before covid-19, but I am using them almost always nowadays. These are comparable in quality to some premium ones I have, like reel legends, and mission. The fabric is top quality, densely knit, but still silky feeling, and cooling.  By no means is this as effective as a proper mask, but it is great quasi-distanced settings, and outside.  I have always used these when gardening, I dampen them and wring them out for cooling, and it helps to block allergens too.<br />  These are a great size for my big noggin, but smaller headed people should heed the accurate measurements stated in the description.<br />  Two of the gaiters  that I received had  slight blems on the serging on inside of the gaiter, which is not visible when wearing,  and the only thing that I could ding them on. I still liked them so much that I ordered a second batch,  which I will use to make coordinating headbands.  The price is right and the colors are perfect."
4.0,"These are nice sunglasses, there is good polarization in the lenses and they seem well made mostly. It comes with a case and a microfiber cloth as well. They fit a little awkwardly on my head whereas some glasses fit around the face more if that makes sense. Still they are good glasses, I am happy with them."
4.0,"Great fit,  keeps me warm"
4.0,Soft leather. Lots of slots for your cards. Overall nice wallet.
4.0,Good shirts for me to wear during the hot summers at our non-air-conditioned mobile home. The shirts arrived on time and were as described.
4.0,Snug fit but otherwise a nice coat. I returned it for a larger size which hasn't been delivered yet.
4.0,"I just received this sweater today but right away I liked it. I do wish I'd gotten a different color because it is so  similar to others I have in this color, I would have called it light beige. It came extremely well packaged, and right away I knew it was well made. Some I've ordered are just so cheap and thin but this one is nice, a more medium weight which makes it good for other seasons as well as winter. One thing I didn't like right away was it bows out right at the thighs which is not good for someone who doesn't want their thighs accentuated. So there's that. I would prefer a more straight style."
4.0,Shirt is exactly as pictured. I am 5ft 2 inches- 120 lbs and got the XS. It was a good fit. The sleeves would be short on anyone much taller.
4.0,I do like it. It fit good.
4.0,Es bonito. Queda precioso. Solo q el color rojo en la foto es fuerte el color. El q me llego es un rojo opaco
4.0,"Just as expected - a bit difficult to put on, but that's the style of the clasp. Grandson likes it."
4.0,A little small. MUST hang to dry
4.0,"This is such a cute blouse. The girl is going to love that it is velvet. And it is lightweight velvet at that. This is made of 92% Polyester, 8% Spandex, which gives it that light, velvety knit feeling. To wash this, it will need to be handwash in cold water and lay flat to dry. This is not one of those materials that you want to just toss in the washer with other clothes. It is uber cute and the girl will be so happy."
4.0,"Love the clarity of the glasses and the case, and cleaning clothe that comes with it,  makes it a great combo for the price."
4.0,Cool dress!  I like the adjustable sleeves.  Can wear with tights or sandles.
4.0,Didn't come with instructions.
4.0,"Fit my Maui Jims, cool design, good price.  I wish they were a bit longer...I'm a 6'3 with long hair and when not wearing they hang to my upper chest, wish they rested a bit lower...overall so far 😊"
4.0,"I can’t say anything bad about the product as far as durability or value. I had the misconception that this buckle was removable. In addition, the belt was WAY too big. Bought it for the awesome buckle. Didn’t need the belt, but went with white one since I don’t have that color. First, it sucked how big it was but I was willing to detach it and put it on my other belts. That’s when I realized it’s built in. Easier to return and pick out a buckle."
4.0,"HD Vision Anti-Glare Dring Glasses with free micro fiber bag, I enjoy wearing them when I go driving in the day time; They are stylish and fit good! I will share with my friends."
4.0,The sweater is very cute! It’s light and I love the batwing sleeves.  I wish it was a bit smaller but it is winter so a long tank top underneath will be perfect as it’s very sheer also so it’s needed. Just remember it runs a bit big!
4.0,I've only used it once; so far it works well!
4.0,These are really comfortable but the legs did shrink a bit in the wash. Not a big deal because I only wear them at home but just heads up
4.0,Very well made and adorable :) just wish there a little bigger size so I could fit my Mac.
4.0,They're easy to put in and fun to wear. Don't wear overnight though. They lunch if left in too long. Be careful if you have wider nipples. They work perfectly for me but I could see these being difficult for others as the bar is kind of short.
4.0,Flattering. But will need to pin the bust area.
4.0,I have a few of these dresses for work in the summer. The material is super soft like a T-shirt and these are very comfy but not frumpy! They wash well (I hang mine to dry) and don’t wrinkle that easily. Recommend
4.0,I am giving these glasses a four star because they flop around when I put them over my glasses and they don't stay on my nose. So I really don't use them much.  I bought them to read at night on my iPad to protect my eyes.  They do filter the light and look better then most. I may put them in my car for those times that the sun glares too bright. I am petite so maybe if you are a male or a women with average to larger frame these may work just fine for you.
4.0,"I like this a lot, I was looking for something that would open in case I need only my car keys or for use in valet, etc. But I need it to look nicely as my old one, after so long of use my keys would come off it's locking mechanism too easily. This twist and open way is very easy, and will never untwist on it's own.<br /><br />My only problem so far is that the key rings that come with it, although strong, are very hard to open."
4.0,Gift for 20-something daughter who wears size 4 pants. The size medium in these leggings was too small. Quality is fine for the price so I gave four stars but beware of the sizing difference. Go big!
4.0,"Good quality and good price - I stand all day at work, these are comfortable"
4.0,"My almost 7 yr old daughter picked this for our upcoming trip to disney instead of Minnie mouse ears. It says kids, but I could easily wear this myself. It is easy to adjust, and she loves it. 4 stars only because it's an adult size hat that can be adjusted down and I figured it would be more along the lines of a child size hat."
4.0,"Very cute dress, fit as expected. My only complaint is it needs a lining due to the fabric being thin and see-through."
4.0,"Bought two sets. Three of the four leggings are the same size and comfortable (not tight) for a size 6 at 135 lbs. One of the leggings is smaller than the others and fits tight. The material is super smooth and the waist band is comfortable. The length is above ankle for a 5' person but it's not capri, which is fine. Overall great buy for the outstanding quality and price but I'm deducting one star due to the one set that was smaller."
4.0,Great earrings. Be sure and measure your earlobes. They do hang almost 2 inches.  They didn't work for me but I would recommend them!
4.0,"The material is thinner than expected,  but still love them."
4.0,"I love this jacket.  It's very attractive and  in white.  I'm surprised there are no other reviews.  It does run small - I am usually a size 8 and ordered a medium which fit a bit snugly, exchanged it for a large which fits great and leaves room for a layer underneath.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it has heating coils inside and an end to plug into a charger but I have no  idea how to use the heating coils and there are no directions.  Guess I will ask a question and maybe the manufacturer will answer.  But I love the jacket even without the extra heat.  It is medium weight, wouldn't be enough for a very cold day without an underlayer but fine for 32 degrees and up.  Haven''t washed it yet so Idon't know how the heating coils would survive its being washed<br /><br />Update:  still haven't washed it but I did figure out how to heat it.  You need a small battery pack and you plug the coils into it in the inside pocket.  There is a power button on the front (looks like a logo) to turn it on and off."
4.0,"Easy to use, however the cold gel warms so fast with body heat that only a few minutes of good is realized."
4.0,"fit great, look great"
4.0,They aren't quite the real deal quality wise but close enough.
4.0,"Very good quality, they do not feel cheap, I've been using them already for a copule of days and so far so good.<br />The only negative I see about these Dangle Earring, is that I think they are too big... at least for my ears.  They keep coming off when I move my head too rapidly."
4.0,Cute and comfortable my son like it
4.0,It was ok but round the breast part a lil tight
4.0,The scarf is beautiful. I love it.<br />Had a little problem with size(a bit small)<br />Got a lot of compliments!
4.0,I am giving it 4 stars since it was a good price. Anything beyond what I paid would have resulted in 3 stars
4.0,I have received several compliments on this ring set. I break the set up and wear on several fingers as two of the rings are smaller than the rest. Breaking the set up works well and i have been pleased with my purchase.
4.0,"Slightly larger than expected, but he is still growing. Very warm gloves for below-zero Wisconsin winters."
4.0,I love these socks. Not too thick.
4.0,Fabric a little scratchy but fits perfect and looks great on.
4.0,I loved it. But it was too big.<br />Size charts can be confusing<br />My daughter loved it.<br />I ordered a smaller one for myself.<br />It's perfect😁
4.0,"Beautiful, but would love to have had it in the right size,  but they don't offer it in half sizes"
4.0,Really good but is kinda short and came in with the logo creased
4.0,"Nice and light for Spring or Fall. I suggest hand wash dry flat, use Woolite"
4.0,Very nice and goes with everything! The black leather is wearing but other than that it's good.
4.0,Not disappointed  for the quality but the sizes run very small if you have any size to you at all order two up. I order one up and it will fit but  no extra wiggle room
4.0,Pretty shirt just the size is too big
4.0,"My sister love the charm, glad I order it for her, after losing her princess.."
4.0,They work really well but they are not at all as wide as the picture shows. The one picture shows the center up high between the breasts…the actual product does not do that.  They are a little hard to position since the band is only about 1.5” wide. Nonetheless they do the job!
4.0,Good quality and fits as promised.  I will purchase again.
4.0,"Looks nice. Haven't worn it yet, so I can't say anything else."
4.0,Thin cotton long sleeve is perfect for the spring or fall.
4.0,I loved the message and the quality of the shirt. It was perfect for the casual Christmas look.  Definitely go up a size.  Hand wash and lay flat to dry.
4.0,Comfortable and sturdy. Sometimes they bunch around my ankles. I like them.
4.0,"I bought the shirt to fit a little large, over my big belly. It does and looks great under a cardigan."
4.0,Love the bow. Daughter wears it every game. Bag is like paperish but we use it for toys. Not sure how long it will last.
4.0,"Not to bad for the price! I uploaded a video so you can check them out! They are big, even for big faces, I have a wide jaw and suits perfectly! I like the gradient lens, and they do go over the brow...."
4.0,Fit as expected.  Good material 100% cotton.
4.0,I ordered the xl it was tight in the arms. The chest. The stomach  I am a size 14 and have ordered xl in other brands and have had more room then this style
4.0,"Beautiful dress, it was to short for me, so I gave it to my sister, she’s below 5’2."
4.0,Order a half size up but if you have wide feet order a whole size up
4.0,"I wore this dress to my school’s junior prom, it looked great. Follow the sizing chart that is described by the maker. I am a size 8, and buy size medium dresses normally, but the manufacturer said for size 8 to order a small and a small was definitely the right fit. I probably could Age gen ordered an extra small for a better fit around the waist and in the shoulders. The dress is not made of a super fancy material, but it is not cheap either. There is no built-in slip. For $18, I was really happy with this dress. I looked great and had a good style to it. I would definitely buy another color of it for another dress in the future."
4.0,"I have had several different bibs over the years, some high end some budget options. For a budget option these are pretty good.  A couple things to note. I use these as my commuter bibs. I am 6' 5"" 245 lbs and bought the XXXL bibs. My commute is 5 miles each direction, and a quick saturday spin is about 20-25 miles on Sat/Sun.<br />* They are great at ~25 mile max ride length.  I think much longer than that they would start to be uncomfortable.<br />* I use these on cool mornings/evenings in the fall/winter (~40 F) when it is not raining and they keep me at comfortable temperature. They do okay with a drizzle but they aren't waterproof.<br />* They need to be washed once a week (unless it gets rained on), they do well on the odor front.<br />* The pad is good on the groin but not great, they do need to be adjusted when I stand up on my pedals and then sit back down. Which might be annoying for some or might just be that they are a little tight on my thighs.<br /><br />The one downside is the zipper that you have to unzip to get your geet through. The material/zipper are a little sharp and become uncomfortable over long stretches."
4.0,nice but I can not close and of course I can not use.
4.0,We liked the wallet but the lining on the upper part is coming off the seam. On the gray and black wallets. If you can replaced it it will be appreciated. I did not realize that the deadline for the return was February 23rd. I can send them back to you. Thank you in advance.
4.0,"Great shoes, really nice looking for this style of sandle. But we aware this product runs small. Order a size larger."
4.0,Beautiful bracelet.  Love the quality!
4.0,"They're not kidding when they say &#34;comfort sandal&#34;, but they're actually cute too! I wanted some cute flat sandals for the beach season, everything else I looked at was $40-ish (which is reasonable, still...) but when I saw these I thought, they're so cheap I can't possible NOT try them out. They don't look goofy, they don't look like grandma-sandals (actual fears of mine!) and they are RIDICULOUSLY comfortable. Perfect for walking around all day and still looking nice!"
4.0,Color and the dot to the device have been true. The only issue for me is when I put it on I have to pay attention that when I turn it over on my wrist it does not come undone. Once it is secure I have had no issues with it opening and falling off after that.
4.0,Very beautiful but so small.. my fingers normal but didn't cover it all.. I give it to my 11 years niece
4.0,"Got a gray one on a lightening deal for a really low price. If it goes on sale again I would probably buy another color. It is very comfortable. It is thin but not see through. Great fit. I am 5'4"" 160 and got a medium."
4.0,Loved this dress. But it ran a bit larger than expected. The length was good and on the shorter side. But large in all other areas.
4.0,Great value. Great product
4.0,"Very nice for the price, especially since there were 3 different matching pieces.  Like most of the jewelry from this vendor, this set is fun to wear.  It doesn't look too cheap, but of course we know it isn't real amber or silver.  It arrived within the time quoted.  I don't expect things sent from China to arrive right away, but sometimes I am happily surprised."
4.0,"Order this dress for my mom the dress is a really nice dress, it runs small. I ordered a XL which my mom wears and XL, the material doesnt really stretch much. If ordering this dress go up a size or two."
4.0,"These earrings are tiny indeed, more or less like a bean size. But, for the price, and having real gold in it, it is a bargain you cannot let go."
4.0,Much bigger than I expected.  I’m 5’0 and 125 lbs so I got a medium and I definitely should have gotten a small.  It’s cute  and comfortable though
4.0,"Grandkids loved wearing these and it helped to protects their faces from the cold. If I had anything negative to say, it would be that it is not as thick as we expected."
4.0,"I really like this vest, it has a ton of pockets (maybe too many) but you don't have to fill them all I guess. The only thing I didn't like was the arm holes are way too big, I ordered a large. I am going to try a medium to see if it's any better, otherwise I will have to return them both."
4.0,"It was a bit big, but it's a gorgeous ring"
4.0,"Elegant yet sexy, bought this for my daughter who is 5'9 and 180 lbs."
4.0,"The only drawback is that the RFID blocking technology makes the wallet a little thicker, a little stiffer.  I have been very happy with it as a front pocket wallet."
4.0,"i have had the same nose ring in since i got it pierced back in 2015 so i was in need of new jewelry. i love these a lot. they’re all super cute with the colors and designs. the only issues i have is the hoops being just a little snug/short. but nonetheless great fit. as well as it says 18g, but it’s a little bigger than the one i had in when i got pierced. maybe that’s just because i wasn’t 100% on what size i was pierced with or if the 18g is just a little thicker than normal. they still fit my nose perfectly though. it didn’t hurt when putting in the new jewelry. i’ve only been wearing the new hoop for a couple hours so not sure if it’ll irritate my nose yet, i’ve had issues with that in the past, as well as i am allergic to (i believe) fake/cheap jewelry."
4.0,Very cute. But the inside had a TERRIBLE fish smell. Sprayed with febreeze stuck an air freshener cone in there & no effect. Hung it outside on my balcony for a couple of days & the smell finally disappeared.
4.0,They are very pretty but the strap has a leather piece on the inside that rubs a bit. Hopefully it will soften over time.
4.0,I had to put on my reading glasses to see the details on pendant but was over all satisfied.
4.0,kindda uncomfortable when you sit but sucks you in
4.0,Smaller than I thought it would be but it works and is comfortable to use.
4.0,just didn't fit right
4.0,"I liked the style and material of this dress, but the twist front hit me at the wrong spot around my waist, so I had to return it."
4.0,"The blue is not as pictured...it's a shade or two darker, but it fits wonderfully."
4.0,Too big (wide) too short) 😞 sad bc I ordered 3 and was very hopeful they would fit😭 nice quality though
4.0,Leaves the bottom of my feet black. My wife says they're ugly. But I like them. They're very comfortable.
4.0,Very cute. Because it's such a small gauge it isn't very evident that it's a heart unless someone is really looking closely. However it fits perfectly as a lip ring and I has no problem getting it in.
4.0,"Use it on our sailboat. Very comfortable, durable. A little large for stowing on our small boat so we only bought one."
4.0,The mood ring is an overall beautiful product. But the metal wasn't as sturdy as I had hoped. It still has beautiful coloring and I get many compliments on it. Thank you for the product
4.0,"Good quality but they definitely run small. I'll likely purchase again two sizes larger than what I would normally wear.<br /><br />Update: I reordered in large and they fit okay. Still small in the waist, a tiny bit baggy everywhere else. I'm only 5'5&#34; about 120 lbs for reference."
4.0,Ami esposa le quedo bonita
4.0,They're a bit on the big side but I can't complain.  I have small hands so...but otherwise they're not too bad.
4.0,"Comfy shirt nice material runs a lot larger than expected though, still keeping it the way it is"
4.0,"The waist is definitely very high-waisted - maybe a little too high for my waist, but I am going to make it work because I enjoy them! It rolls slightly upon bending over, but not obnoxiously. I ordered a small in both top and bottom and I am very glad I did in the bottoms. The mediums (i believe) would have been too large).<br /><br />My Measurements for Reference.<br />Height - 5”8’,<br />Weight - 140lbs<br />Bust - 35in<br />Under Bust - 30in<br />Natural Waist - 27in<br />Hips - 36.5<br />Lulu Tops - 6<br />Lulu Bottoms - 4"
4.0,"Love this dress. Hugs my curves, but I'd be self conscious if I ate in this dress lol. It's very form fitting. If you do not like dresses very tight around your mid section and hips do not purchase."
4.0,"I am petite so I should've expected them to be so high up, but wasn't hoping they wouldn't be."
4.0,"Thin, perfect for summer. Mid calf length on me, I am 5'2&#34;. Very pretty."
4.0,"I TOOK OFF ONE STAR BECAUSE I DID NOT EXPECT THEM TO BE COMPLETELY SEE THRU, NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN WEAR WITH THE KIDS OR PARENTS AROUND..."
4.0,These boots are a good value.The second pair I purchased I bought a half size smaller to get the right size
4.0,seems a tad bigger than should be but comfortable.
4.0,The dress is beautiful.. once you iron it. The lace around the neck and sleeves is a bit itchy and I may need to add some liner to cover it and keep it from itching. Otherwise it would get 5 stars.
4.0,Fantastic buy! It’s like a wearable blanket. My teenager loves it. It’s a little big but well worth the money.
4.0,Went with other suggestions to go one size up. Good choice.
4.0,"Ran a little small on my big head, but definitely still wearable"
4.0,Nice fit besides the sleeves being a little tight. Bought three for a friend group and they were all that way
4.0,Nice looking pants.
4.0,They are kind of ugly but very comfortable and a fraction of the price of the &#34;tennis shoe:&#34; looking shoes. I love them and ordered 2 pairs. I'm a nurse and they are perfect. My feet do not hurt after a long 12+ hour shift.
4.0,"I purchased the 2 pack capri length in black and dark green. The green (pictured) is very muted and almost grey in some lighting but they are very comfortable, fit well (purchased in xl and I wear 16/18 pants, have wide hips and calves) and have a nice deep pocket on either side of mid thigh. The black however were either not quite as stretchy or just cut a little smaller, not quite a full size and not uncomfortable but noticeablely smaller than the green. I purchased these to wear biking with the intention of keeping my phone in the pocket and they worked great - secure for nearly an hour ride. I have a Google pixel 2 with a case and it fits at least an inch under the top of the pocket."
4.0,"The extra space around the armpit can help you to smuggle in that triple decker burger you haven't had time to eat while getting dressed up. You can fit a good chipotle burrito in the other side. This is a GORGEOUS dress, the fabric and design are just like this picture. I checked the sizing guide and got what they rec'd. It was roomy on me, which I think affected showing off the curves like in the photo. But it was just way too big around the armpits that it made a bubble between the armsyce and my chest. I'm going to try it in a size smaller and see if that helps, because it looks and feels like a 5 star dress. I took away 1 star because of the armpit bubble/fit based on their suggested measurements."
4.0,Nice fit... long enough to wear with leggings
4.0,"Great replacement kit, the band is easy enough to replace and looks identical to the original Surge band.  The material for this band is slightly more rigid that the original."
4.0,"Extremely comfortable, but may slip off if you're doing a lot of house work."
4.0,"These pants get bigger the longer you wear them. They fit perfectly when I first got them. After 30 minutes of wearing they were too large. I would size down, but these pants are great!"
4.0,"Loose fitting, I should have gotten 1 size smaller. Heavy fabric so this is definitely a winter dress. Its very unique and I have received many compliments wearing it."
4.0,"It's okay and heavy, but the black finish is weak, certainly not anodized or even some good sealed paint. My left side has worn away by almost 35% within the first week, just from touching my desktop when working on the computer. But then I expected that for the price and for the easy change pins, allows me to change out bands on a regular basis. Mechanically works well for the clasp and so far, no weakness in the link couplings...so good for the price."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:4f1d5d6b0085c11a070b45584ccd96e6]] The package was a little dirty but the glasses are okay
4.0,"Aeropostale Polos for women run about 1 size smaller than other brands. I previously read this in another review and ordered accordingly. So polos fit fine... when ordering, just order one size larger than normal."
4.0,Really liked this dress when I saw it on other people but it definitely depends on your body shape. Great dress but just didn’t look right for me.
4.0,"So this belt is great for comfort and utility, but it certainly is not durable. This pic is the belt after about 1 year of use."
4.0,"Absolutely love the boots and how they feel on my feet, but if you have long feet and skinny calves like me, these won't work.  I bought them because another reviewer said the boots fit her hard-to-fit narrow calves.  In my size 10m, the calf opening on the boot is 15.5&#34;, which is not at all narrow.  My calf is 13&#34;, so I have to return them.  So disappointed, because the shoe part of the boot fits so comfortably I could wear them all day.  No tightness in the toes like with so many other boots.  I would've given 5 stars if the seller had displayed a size chart like some others do--one that includes the calf width, or if they offered free shipping on the return instead of me having to pay almost $20 and ending up with no boots."
4.0,"Loved how compact this umbrella was.<br /><br />The only issue I had was that the wrist string tore off super easily. They should probably think of a different design for that one piece, but for its main function, it’s a great find."
4.0,Comfortable and lightweight.  These shorts are true to size.<br />The fabric has a nice stretch to it but I did notice  a small snag after wearing them a couple times. It's not so severe you couldn't wear it again but was hoping they would be more durable.
4.0,This helmet is a good value and a good fit.<br />We use it with a beekeeping veil and it works perfectly.<br />It could comfortably be used as a sun hat.
4.0,I really love this dress. It fits me really well.<br />The armhole is a little large for me as I have narrow shoulders and arms. Otherwise. Great for work-to-date kind of dress.
4.0,Beautiful dress. Fabric is very light and nearly see through but I had no issues while wearing it. I am tall so the length was great. Received many complements.
4.0,Cool Dress!!!!
4.0,"It's pretty good, I like wearing it. As a musician it works well for me . It's a little warm right now because it's summer. But great look."
4.0,Fits well even 6 months pregnant
4.0,The material was really good but the fit was slightly larger than expected but not so large that I would go up a size.  Unfortunately because they run a little big there was slippage when I worked out and then the seams that give the leggings the great look rub the wrong spots.  I am definitely going to give these another try.  I may need to use these for weekend errand runs but find something else for workouts.
4.0,"a little rough and cheap feeling, but looks cute. i got a compliment on it, so that’s a plus."
4.0,the sizing is huge!
4.0,my daughter loves this
4.0,"As a smaller girl with a larger bust, (32G) I did expect that it would be a little too wide around. I really wish they made this halter tie at the back as well. Love the bralette itself though and with some minor alterations it will fit perfect. If you have a larger chest I would not recommend sizing down at all as your nipples would probably no longer be covered."
4.0,Wish it was fitted
4.0,"Size up, item runs a bit small... Over happy with purchase..."
4.0,Flows well.
4.0,"Comfortable, very thin material tho.  Cute print"
4.0,I keep losing them periodically and I keep ordering these.  8 mm.
4.0,"This is a very warm and attractive wool sweater. Wool provides terrific insulation and this sweater is perfect for a chill autumn day. The fabric is very soft and feels good against the skin, although some people do not like how wool feels. I would recommend you wear this sweater with a base layer. The sweater is a simple, form-fitting design that fits true to size and looks great. You have to remember to hand wash this sweater in cool temperatures."
4.0,"A Very beautiful necklace but the message is to small ; to be read when you put it on .<br />I would have loved the message to have been larger,to be read when  wearing it on,<br />However it is a message I hold dear to my heart."
4.0,I bought this watch so I could have a way of keeping time at my job without always having to pull out my phone and it fits the bill. It's small but it keeps time and I love the different colored backgrounds.
4.0,ought for my husband to wear with his new wool coat
4.0,"I love it. Mine arrived quickly, the cost is great and it fit perfectly the only thing I could not figure out was how to make the snakes tail stay on. Mine kept falling off, otherwise perfect! And the dragon fit well also. He surprisingly is not heavy and I cannot wait to wear him at my steampunk event."
4.0,Great quality....runs really small tho
4.0,A cute gift for anyone who loves Hamilton.
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress. It fits well but definitely runs big. It’s made of material that will stretch, so order a size smaller than normal."
4.0,"Good wallet, holding up well. Two small complaints: the green paint on the Mandalorian badge began chipping off after about 8 months to reveal the silver underneath it and the ID holder on the front has been leaving glue/sticky residue all over the top edge of my ID since I first bought it, meaning it is getting stuck in there, and I have to give a good bit of effort to yank out my ID. This could just be a fault of the one i got, so other than that, its a good wallet and I only dock 1 star. Cool design, and I cant complain much considering the price. Cash fits well enough into the center pocket. Front ID holder fits 3 ids and a spare house key/flat vehicle key, card slots in the back could probably hold 10-12 before it gets stuffed."
4.0,"Good all around watch. Seems to work like it says, I give it 4 stars"
4.0,"I generally like this watch, but there are a few things that make me doubt I will actually wear it as much as I want to ... read on for more.<br /><br />Good:<br />* The pattern I have (dual-colored wood) is very striking in person and will look good with a variety of outfits.<br />* Real wood!  Its pleasant to feel and looks great contrasted with the metal parts of the watch<br />* A full date system: it shows month, day of week, and day of month.<br />* Included adjustment screwdriver!  This is the first watch I've ever had that has included one, which is great.<br />* A fun necklace was included (see photo).  I personally don't care for it, but a free extra is always nice.<br /><br />Bad:<br />* The wrist adjustments are not very fine - I could not get a good fit on me.  After fiddling with the # of links I can either have it too big (such that it slides around) or slightly too small (such that I can't close the metal clasp).<br />* The adjustment screwdriver heads break easily - I snapped two apart while adjusting the watch.  Luckily they included a lot of spares ...<br /><br />Ugly:<br />* The luminescence is very weak, and is only at the number locations instead of also on the watch hands, so you can't actually tell what time it is in the dark<br />* No included instructions on how to actually adjust the date in the included watch-face (the instructions described how to work several other watch faces).  Luckily it was pretty easy to figure out (pull out the adjustment pin and then press the various buttons to adjust things), but even so, its a definite oversight.<br />* The watch face is way too busy for my taste.  Beyond the two date dials, the date cutout, and the window into the watch mechanism, you also have a textured background and a metal cross-anchor sort of thing ... I think its a bit too much (at least for my taste).<br />* The watch casing is very thick, 5/8"".<br />* I'm not sure where the mechanism is from and so can't speak to its long-term accuracy/reliability.<br />* It's wood, so you do need to take a bit more care of it than metal/plastic/similar watches.  Obviously not waterproof.<br /><br />Overall:  Despite the weak/useless luminescence and extra care required I would still like to wear this around as I really like the wood and the full date functionality, however unless I can figure out a solution for the wrist adjustment (or get a totally different band) then I'll probably be keeping this one in the drawer for the time being ... which is unfortunate, as I otherwise like it quite a bit."
4.0,a Little small
4.0,I purchased the rose gold. It is nice looking and fits well. I like that the hair ties came with it so you know it fits. I like the bead on the hair tie that is rose gold as well.
4.0,Love these !!!!!
4.0,"My phone fits,  just doesn't function with the touch screen. I have to remove my phone to use it. Other than that, there is plenty of slots for credit cards,license, etc. Love it for quick trips to the store and when I don't want to carry my big purse."
4.0,"Like the color. (blue )Like the price for 2 pair. The picture depicts safety pin earring with no coil at the bottom, that is not the case, they do in fact have a coil at the bottom of the earring. Other than that, the earrings are nice."
4.0,Love the skin but wish the stickers came labeled
4.0,This scarf has a beautiful fit. Nice and soft yarn. I paired this with a black and white striped dress for a pop of color.
4.0,Great leggings - I received lots of compliments - true to size and good long length
4.0,This is a great looking bracelet and fairly sturdy.  I took off one star because it can bend easier than I'd expect it to.  My wife wears this all the time and it has held up well though.
4.0,It was a hit at the Pride parade
4.0,I gave this to a friend for Christmas and although it took a very long time to receive it was definetly worth it. It's inexpensive and like great on my friend. She absolutly loves it and I couldn't be happier with this product!
4.0,A little small in the chest and short in the front but other than that it fits well. I used the size chart.
4.0,Very nice bracelet but after a week or so the heart keep falling off and now it's completely off but besides that it's really nice.
4.0,"These are very cute. I got them for my daughter & granddaughter. They love them,thank you!"
4.0,Love it....a bit big in the shoulders.
4.0,Excellent item.The packaging did not suit me. I had to bend the wire brim back into shape and did not like that it had been flattened to ship.
4.0,Fits my nephew very well. He wears it often and it looks great. Good quality.
4.0,Fits great! Just a little floppy and thin! But it’s great for a night out at the bars!
4.0,Finally a bra I can wear that isn't over the top expensive.
4.0,These pants are UBER soft.  I wish there were more design and color options or i would be ordering more.
4.0,"If you remember wearing pennies in gym class, then you know what your getting. They are great for running however there is no stretch to them. If you like baggier shirts for working out, order up especially if you have an issue with certain materials touching you."
4.0,Cute for my 4 year old!  He loved them! The Mario looks exactly as pictured.  No support in them though.
4.0,Colors as described and pictured. I’ve been using the blue one for a month and it did unravel to where it was just one long keychain rather than a wristlet. I just tied it back together and it’s been holding up fine since. Product is useful to free hands when carrying other items.
4.0,"First timevtying, it ripped out - but we just sewed it back on. These are great & I bought another set. Perfect dishwashing apron!"
4.0,Super cute!  Bought for vacation and love it.
4.0,"Great product, a little to heavy and big for me but good material"
4.0,"Very useful in an auto shop as it stops a good amount of airborn particulates, though it is not quite a replacement for goggles."
4.0,Incredibly pretty pendant. Very pleased with the craftsmanship and the stone settings. Unfortunately had to knock give it a lower star rating because the chain wasn’t great at all (not long enough and had those cheap extenders on it) I wound up having to buy a separate chain.
4.0,This headband is made well and will last for as long as needed.  The fit was just right.
4.0,"Love these, but they don’t stay on real good."
4.0,Cute wish it had more fullness but for the price was great. Color was pretty
4.0,"Excellent belt for the price. However, you'll need a drill to adjust the size to your liking."
4.0,"Very cute design, nice material, and tru to size."
4.0,Great but too small for my face.
4.0,"This dress was nice quality. Fit as expected. I just didn’t like the look of it on me. I have a bigger chest, and it made the top poof out too much, and made me look bigger than I am. Other than that, very nice dress."
4.0,This top is very pretty. I love the colors but it’s very tight across the chest area. I alway wear an XL
4.0,"Sadly these were sent to me by mistake- I ordered a different earring set- but seeing that this is a vine review, I'm going to test and give my full thoughts on the product as if I ordered it-- anyway.<br /><br />Let’s establish this first, everyone rates things differently- this is how I do it:<br /><br />5 stars: The item fully meets OR exceeds expectations<br />4 stars: There could be improvements, but the product is good<br />3 stars: The item is acceptable, but might be better elsewhere, or needs improvement<br />2 stars: Many or most things are wrong with the item, but it has some redeemable feature<br />1 star: Stay Away! It’s a bad buy<br /><br />In those stars I try to include: How closely the product meets the description, Price, How it compares to other products I’ve tried, and Usability.<br /><br />My reviews can be long, so if you want to skim, follow the topic headers. Also-I try to update my reviews, so they may change over time.<br /><br />Cost:<br />At the time of my review--When I search amazon for ""black earrings"" right near the top result a single pair of the black square shaped earrings pops up for nine bucks. THIS set with nine pairs for 11.99 is obviously a better deal.<br />Though- it looks like there are a plethora of these earrings hitting the market, so lower costs could be on the way. If there's only one set of earrings here you like, I'd recommend fishing around-- I bet you'll find it on it's own for less.<br /><br />Quality:<br />These look like the picture- no false advertising there. To test their quality I put a pair in my daughter's ears, my husbands ear, and my ears--checking to see if the earings had any issues with the gem falling off- discoloration , or any other problems.<br />We didn't see anything wrong with any of them.<br /><br />Metal quality:<br />I saw one reviewer mentioned they had struggles with different types of metals- and these earrings caused problems-- I also have some metal allergies, but these earrings didn't cause me any trouble. They appear to actually be stainless steal.<br />--BUT the earrings arrived in a clear unmakered bag- each earring with a different packaging tag- only three of them marked as steel, and the rest unlabeled. These aren't a set- but a group of earring styles thrown together.<br /><br />That means it --could be-- a mixed bag on what you get.<br /><br />Final thoughts-<br />It's hard for me to give a true review because these earrings aren't ""my style"" exactly. that makes me unsure if I'd pay this much for them. Overall, I think they fit the description.<br />But the odd way they were differently tagged and jumbled together shows that this has a high risk for quality control issues, so I'm dropping one star.<br />Still- they were all like the description photo, so in my experience --you get what you see.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful!!"
4.0,"Not a bad shirt for the price, if you’re looking for something that will take a beating then buy riveted maille"
4.0,Not a bad belt. Only have had this for a few weeks but it holds up good. The belt is not super rigid so beware
4.0,Great but Very fragile. First order came snapped in half. Got replacement and second was perfect. The anti fog kinda works. I’ll talk and the glass will begin to fog but not enough to cover the view just in the area where my mouth is and disappears after I finish talking. Shade is great.  The nose clip comes off fairly easily but crazy glue will fix that.
4.0,"This dress is just beautiful!  I’m 5’9” 125 pounds and the size small for me perfectly.  Unfortunately, I needed this dress for an outdoor summer event and the material was too thick and heavy for that occasion.  It would have been much too hot to wear.  So I reluctantly returned this dress.  Would definitely buy again if the fabric was changed to something more appropriate for summer weather."
4.0,"This dress, being an empire waist, was a good fit.  I had to finish stitching up a small seam in the sleeve, but that was a quick fix.  I love the dress."
4.0,Cute dress. A little long and I'm 5'7&#34; and a little big (135lbs give or take lol).
4.0,Super cute but gets dirty fast
4.0,Good but is hard to get onto ears
4.0,Bought as a christmas present for an elderly aunt who is always cold. She was thrilled to get them and said they keep her feet toasty warm.
4.0,"Pretty pink floral pattern.  Contrasting pink piping on the hemmed sleeves and pant cuffs and collar.  Pink drawstring.  Soft cotton (100% according to the tag) that gets softer with washing, didn't notice any shrinking.  They do run a little big, but not ridiculously huge.<br /><br />My only complaint is with the elastic - it's ""tight-ish"", not too tight, but it's also not very comfortable.  There's also a lack of quality control with the elastic.  I bought 2 pair last summer same sizes and one waistband/elastic-band was 2"" smaller than the other.  They sew the elastic tightly into the waistband in three rounds, making it a very unpleasant task of removing it.  You have to rip out the entire waistband seam (three rounds of it) and then sew it back up. The plus side on that elastic, if you choose not to remove it, is that it will definitely stay in place, not roll/twist up.<br /><br />After removing the elastic band, I cut drawstring in half and then attached the pieces to the ends of a 3"" piece of elastic.  This allows you to easily pull bottoms on/off without having to untied the drawstring."
4.0,"I like these shorts a lot. They fit well and are very comfortable. My only complaint is that the hem on one leg is crooked, resulting in a permanent wrinkle. Not a huge deal, but a little annoying."
4.0,"When my kids’ wear them, we’ve received some compliments. I like the adjustable string and different colors & images. It helps keep my kids’ mask around their neck and works well in that regard.<br />The only negative is that we’ve broken a few as the clip snapped from the elastic string. Lost about 3 so far and only had three a few weeks.<br />But the price was fair comparably. However I have seen the price fluctuate a bit which must be a supply/demand thing. It’s gone up about 15%+. Still a good price.<br />I recommend the product on price, variety and practicality. But took away a star from the manufacturing."
4.0,The bamboo socks are great. They make my feet feel good. They are soft and comfortable and keep my tootsies cool. I like that a lot. I find these great and have them in black and white.
4.0,Not much  padding
4.0,They’re super cheap and will do the job when needed. I’m under no illusion of these being a multi-use or any thicker than they are being as they’re marketed as disposable. I’d buy it again
4.0,They sparkle when the light hits them
4.0,"Though it's a bit different it's not bad, it looks nice on and it fits just right."
4.0,Super cute socks got them for a gift for someone and she lived them
4.0,"These are nice pants so comfortable and stylish I'd give more stars but they run small I first bought large but they were way too tight, returned them and bought a pair in XL while they fit me better around the waist the inseam is still too short I am 6 feet tall about 175 lbs so if you're anything near my size keep that in mind but otherwise nice pants with good metal zippers ."
4.0,Overall I like this dress.<br />I ordered a large when I normally wear a medium because I didn’t  want it to be too tight for work.<br />The dress has a nice hidden zipper in the back and is sewn well.<br />I’m glad I got the larger size.<br />The hem hits below the knee and the shirt area tugs just a little at the chest.<br />I personally feel like the keyhole in the front should be a little higher closer to the collar. For that reason I docked 1 star.<br />The dress is very comfortable.<br />If it had pockets it would be even better - everything is better with pockets!!
4.0,This dress has alot of stretch and hugs your figure recommend you buy one size down
4.0,These are a bit thicker (bulkier) than the Jawbone ones.
4.0,They were bigger than I thought but they are nice
4.0,The cut was ok but the material was too thin for my liking. Returned.
4.0,"Bathing suits are tough for almost all of us. I saw this and was curious so I read the reviews. Based on the reviews, I decided to get a XXL. I am a 42 yr old curvy Latina who measures 5'4&#34; and weighs about 180 lbs. I have large breasts, small back and waist and large hips. I'm pleasantly surprised at how much I like this suit. It's different and the price was great."
4.0,"Wide, ample sun protection"
4.0,I LOVE THE FIT THE FABRIC IS A LITTLE MORE STIFF IN THE SKIRT THAN I LIKE BUT ITS A GREAT DRESS
4.0,I used this to help with my glasses getting fogged up when I was wearing my mask. It seems to work pretty well. Easy to apply.
4.0,"I ordered up a size for an oversized fit, but this is true to size. The fabric is soft, a good t-shirt weight, and it drapes well. The only ""con"" is the pockets. I HATE pockets that are useless and just add bulk & bunching around the hip/thigh, so I cut them out and sewed up the seams. I washed and dried on low/knit dryer setting, and they came out fine. No major shrinkage. I do wish they would make this shirt WITHOUT the awful, useless pockets, but it's otherwise a great sleep shirt/lounge shirt for around the house."
4.0,"Yes, my headline says cheap and flimsy, but I still gave 4 stars. The jacket was $18.99, so I expected it to be cheap and flimsy. But as long as it does not tear up in the wash or shrink, I will keep my rating at 4 stars."
4.0,Very nice.  (I would be prepared to place into another box for presentation though.)
4.0,It's gorgeous and well made. I'm thinking of getting another one.
4.0,"Let me preface this by saying that these glasses represent everything right with the world and that the USA is the best country on earth.  However, I found these glasses to be incredibly dark.  Like spray painted black dark.  I could see more out of them if I looked through Wesley Snipes forearm.  I could stare at the sun with these glasses and not be concerned.  If I wanted to surprise my girlfriend with a new car I would make her wear these glasses as a blindfold.  Right idea, just to much darkness."
4.0,"When the dress first arrived I was shocked. What they consider “champagne” was what I would call “peach”. At first I was determined to return it, but then I tried it on an slowly began to reconsider. I liked it enough that I went and had it taken in to my correct measurements by a seamstress.<br />It was then that I feel in love with this dress. I got compliments all night and everyone wanted to know where I had bought it. The best part: no one had a dress even remotely close to this one. And you really can’t beat the price."
4.0,"Very difficult to get on , the clasp is tiny and so is the round it goes in"
4.0,"Love this sports bra. Very thick material and thick removable padding. Runs small, I wear smalls in just about everything but I am going to return and buy in medium. It feels tight under the armpit/side boob area. but other than sizing I really think its flattering."
4.0,I love these but the star just fell out of one of them. I have only had them for 7 months. I'm devastated because they were my favorite.
4.0,A very beautiful cut; i got a small but was still a little big ( but i am very petite); just needs to be slightly tailored to fit me properly.
4.0,"This is now one of my favorite lion hoodies in my collection. The color looks the same as you see here and i think the colors work together really well. They don't shrink or fade in the wash. It runs a bit small. I went up two sizes to wear with my leggings, perfect!"
4.0,They fit but snug
4.0,Didn’t Fit ! Liked it but....
4.0,"Cant beat the price, and its pretty too."
4.0,This is a true to size plus top. The color is nice. The fabric has a little stretch which makes it comfortable. It's a great fitting V-neck top. Perfect for fall and winter
4.0,"This slipper is very soft and cozy inside and has a strong thick sole that flexes to maintain comfort with every stride. The lining is plush, warm and soft, and the outer surface wipes clean easily. I haven't had to wash mine yet so I can't comment on how they hold up to washing but, I must say, they appear very sturdily made and have  sole suitable for brief forays outside. Prepare for you feet to be warm. I bought two pair because they fit my wide feet very comfortably (and I have seriously injured feet that hurt often so I notice any pressure on old injuries and surgeries). As I live in north Florida, and it doesn't get very cold here, my feet sweat they get so warm. When this happens I wear the other pair and let the first pair dry out. The message: These are very warm slippers--and very soft inside--and a good buy for the money."
4.0,"This is even more beautiful in person than it is in the picture!  I am pleasantly surprised!  It looks rather dainty in the picture but it is actually quite durable.  The leaf is pretty large and the detail is wonderful.  It looks just like a leaf was dipped into gold.  It comes with the chain, which is not my favorite, as I prefer a finer chain but I think this is just personal preference.  The chain definitely doesn't take away from this beautiful pendant.  The chain is pretty long but not too long.  This is a great piece of jewelry to make a fashion statement or and would be great to wear in the fall with fall reds and golds but also pairs beautifully with summer outfits, as well.  It would be great to purchase for yourself or as a gift.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a beautiful piece of jewelry to wear anytime of the year.<br /><br />*I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.*"
4.0,Cute and exactly as pictured but smaller than I thought it would be.
4.0,"The world's second best goggles fit very well, straight out of the box. I love the idea that you can customize an order sized goggles for your needs. I do find it a little bit confusing about the packaging and the included material, the process should be very straightforward. I've seen some reviews where people would disappointed, I don't think they understand what's actually going on. They're certainly worth a shot, and at this price they're fairly comparable to other brands that aren't customized for your needs."
4.0,"They are just as described, My feet get very warm in them."
4.0,"It's a nice crown! It fit well and looks nice, but if you can't tell from the photos, it is made with fake flowers so one should expect as much. You can untie the ribbon and adjust it. All around it's held together with wire which you can shape and adjust a bit. (The wire is only visible in the back, but mine came really well assembled and they twisted the wire artistically to make a loop where the pretty ribbon ties through.)"
4.0,Very nice my wife is Irish and she loves it
4.0,"It itches my forehead.  I thought it would be softer- more like T-shirt material.  But the person I bought it for said it feels fine and is soft enough.  I have sensitive skin, so others might love the feel of it.<br /><br />I love the colors (grey/blue).  I also love the design.  The person I bought it for really liked it- perfect for keeping his head warm indoors or if it's not too cold outside."
4.0,"Love the shirt, it is just smaller than expected. Definitely order a couple of sizes up."
4.0,"Perfect for hot summer days!  Because of the knit crochet it does seem to run a bit large, and is definitely not designed for layering over a bra, bralette, or swimsuit top = order a size down accordingly!"
4.0,Very pretty ring. Large stone. The stone is sitting a little crooked in the prongs. Hoping it doesn't fall out.
4.0,"Great packaging & the rings seem nice, especially for the price! I went down to 16g from 14g and because of the reviews, I got 12mm... bad choice (for me). I have mine pierced in the ‘sweet spot’ but I’ve had a Septorhinoplasty due to 2 broken noses, so my septum is pierced fairly high.<br /><br />That’s why I thought 12mm would be a good fit but as you can from the pics, it hangs way too low and is pretty wide set. I like a more low profile look rather than a longer hanging ring. When I smile, it tweaks and twists.<br /><br />I’ll keep them as back ups or whatnot but I ordered several more different kinds to test out. I’m thinking 14g and either 10mm or even 8mm would give that peek-a-boo look I’m looking for ;)"
4.0,Very beautiful dress the size I bought is just not meant for my body type.
4.0,"This is really sheer and that is what I wanted, but this will only provide a fashion layer for looks.  If you are looking for warmth this is not the sweater to by.  With that said, the quality is nice and the fit good.  I am a true size medium (size 8P) with broad shoulders.  This is very flattering and long enough to cover up with leggings.I took a star off because it could be a bit thicker."
4.0,Fit weird in waist and butt area but overall great jeans!
4.0,"These seem to be totally functional, though two out of the three straps are non-gripping on one end. All the other ends have a ratcheting grip feel. It seems as long as one end grips, the straps still work, though. Also, for appearance and assured comfort, why not have the rubber sleeves be rounded instead of square, just like temple tips are?"
4.0,For the price of the boot they are super cute!
4.0,These earrings are great quality but i didn't realize how small 5mm was...This is a good buy but just a little to small for me..
4.0,"This is an amazing dress. So soft and smooth, I love it!!"
4.0,"This actually fit me perfect, but after reading the reviews I ordered up. So these do run small. I'm typically a size 6-8, and I ordered a 10, which fit great. Like many people mentioned, it's hard to get past the hips, but once you do it fits fine (and it's not even as hard to get past the hips as you might be worried about, since it is stretchy). However I have a feeling after being in the water it might be a bit hard to get on and off. Something that a lot of people mentioned that I actually didn't have a problem with was the bust. I'm actually not very large-chested (36 I go between B and C cup), but it fit me just fine. I'd say it's just about as cute as it looks in the pic, but bear in mind how it would realistically look on your body-type. Overall, I would recommend getting this. :) Also sorry for the bad lighting and angles and such in the pics. But I figured some pics to see what it looked like on a person were better than none!"
4.0,Beautiful charm- chain seems a little thin for its' size- hope it holds up.  Gave to my niece.
4.0,"Thin materials do you will need to wear a slip.  The kick pleat in the back you will have to make sure your slip doesn't show.  There are pleats right at the lower belly.  If your belly is poochy beware, they do not lay flat."
4.0,i bought these as a bridesmaid gift for my daughter; she loved it.  We have not taken them off!
4.0,"cute hat for the money, I got it on sale!!"
4.0,"The dress is cute but lot is completely different! I ordered what should have been a deep rusty-red. What arrived was a light, faded orange. I kept it because I am ok with the color and didn’t want the mess of a return, but still wish the color in the pictures would have been accurate! I bought this for teaching and it is a little low cut so I will have to wear something underneath it. Otherwise, perfect work outfit!"
4.0,the jacket looks like the one in the picture . I intend carrying it by my seamstress to put in a zip.  I wore the jacket in the rain and to my surprise I remained dry. The material is waterproof and lite weight. I can now say the rain coat is a good coat however it would be better if there was a zip on the inside.
4.0,Dad Loves it
4.0,The color of this watch was very different from was shown in the ad. Also the wrist band would be better in leather. JamesR.
4.0,flimsy chain but nice pendant. Photo pretty accurate.
4.0,"Overall, I am very happy with this travel organizer. It is smaller than I expected, but easily holds all the toiletries I travel with. The multiple pockets and the hanging hook are especially handy.<br /><br />I was concerned that the zippers might not be sturdy enough to handle the tight turns in the corners of the flaps, so I rubbed the zippers with candle wax to make them operate more smoothly. The zippers are my only concern. Overall, the bag is well constructed and quite attractive."
4.0,Not a fan of the brand used for the shirt because they’re typically pretty heavy but overall loved the shirt!
4.0,Needed this for a child's watch...it was too long
4.0,"I ordered the dark cranberry, it is a little darker than the photo. I needed a purse for camping and trips and didn't want to take any of my good bags.  This one is almost perfect.  I would have given 5 stars, but I hate a bag with a dark lining. Its like looking into a big black hole, makes your things hard to find. It is sturdy and I like the 3 different carry straps. There is an inside zipper pouch that is off center which is great because it doesn't cut the bag in half.  I wish it had a metal zipper instead of plastic one across the top of the bag.  I would recommend this bag for very casual uses."
4.0,TOO BIG!!!!
4.0,My little granddaughter loves these boots and grew out of her first pair. So I bought more. I hope these are as good as the first pair. The first pair I got didn’t work and they were replaced no problem. These worked bit are a little hard to get to light up. I hope they work when she is wearing them
4.0,This is a very pretty dress and I'm very disappointed that it just doesn't look good on me.
4.0,I thought it was super cute and would look good on me however it didn't. It looks really good in the picture but on me it didn't look very flattering. No stretchy and true to size.
4.0,"Great for practicing putting in contacts, which is why I got them<br /><br />I also think the color they give is nice"
4.0,I ordered the camel color which is nude. I ordered a size up and i am glad I did. I would recommend this slip. The length is just what I wanted.
4.0,They fit perfect and high waisted. The only issue is they roll up in between thighs:( Very comfy!!!
4.0,Fit is a bit off. But who cares for the price.
4.0,The real thing looks exactly like the picture.  I really like this bracelet.
4.0,I enjoyed the product. I think I need medium but it preference
4.0,It's reversible but has a tag sewn in on the yellow side which opens the seam to remove it.
4.0,Very nice happy with my purchase
4.0,Great support. Nice elasticity. Good design. Bought a second pair after getting this one.
4.0,"Was a gift for a friends little girl, she loved all of them. Very cute for the money."
4.0,"I ordered one size up and the dress fit really well.  I was leery of this dress when I opened the package.  It doesn’t have much shape on the hanger but fit nicely on and I love the length.  At 5’9, I have a hard time finding a dress that is long enough and this one allowed me to wear heels and the hem just grazed the floor."
4.0,They are huge! More like a choker if you could get it over your head. Beautiful color- cute design!
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:7cd375b8d3c9edcb3aa424b1c41c5245]] I love it, it carries more then my purse did. There are a few dings around the front zipper pocket and some of the words on the front are off form the indent,but of it not looking for it u don't notice it"
4.0,"Will be perfect for project I'm working on, just wish a little more detailed, but good for the price."
4.0,Fit great.  My big cyclist thighs seem to have stretched the bottom seems after a few uses.
4.0,this jumpsuit is very comfortable and fits good. There is a hidden zipper on the right side that makes it easy to get on and off. The material is a bit thin so debating on what undergarments I can wear with it.
4.0,"I mean, I was surprised? I’m a curvy girl and this was a first buying something so fitting, but I like it? Super comfy & surprisingly flattering"
4.0,"Beautiful earings! They are light on the ears, not heavy at all. I thought that these would have a velvet backing to them, but they do not. I would recommend them."
4.0,It's a cute suit. The materiel feels a bit cheap...but then so is the price. So not a bad trade off.
4.0,Love the shirts but they are a bit big to size.
4.0,"Other viewers accurately described the sizing, fit and fabric which was super helpful. I am 5'3 180lbs....hour glass figure....I ordered an xl. Fits perfectly and because Im short can wear as a dress just above knee for summer, but will look cuter with navy leggings and flat brown boots for fall."
4.0,"Just like everyone has said, it runs small, order up! I ordered an XL and I'm usually a Medium, that works really well, if I had ordered a Large I definitely would have had to return. I bought it for more of a layering piece instead of a maxi dress and it works perfectly. It's really long, and I mean really long! I'm 5'0 and I'll need to hem it a little to wear with my 5-6 inch heels so it just hits the floor. No big deal, I'm used to it!!"
4.0,"Good quality, will definitely purchas this item again."
4.0,"I ordered these because I work outside on sand filter beds a lot and it gets very hot. They work great! Mine did start to fray really bad after the second day but I reached out to the company, and in a day or two they shipped me another one! Good customer service"
4.0,(Reviewed by my wife): This is a lovely blouse.  There is a metallic shine to the fabric so it is definitely something you could wear to a holiday party.  The fabric is crinkly/crepe-like.  The blouse is loose-fitting and the sizing is generous.  The blouse is very comfortable.
4.0,My daughter loved them they were a birthday gift. The only thing they were a little long but only a problem if you are ordering for someone younger a smaller child.
4.0,Could have added padding so it sits on a person's head on a normal way. Not a huge issue i am sure I can come up with something.
4.0,"This was exactly what I expected when I placed the order.  I have not used it yet for an event, so I cannot rate it a 5 since I don't know how it will hold up with contents inside.  If I am able, I will return to this review with an update once the bag is used."
4.0,Not quite as firm as I'd like. I'd recommend sizing down. Still great quality for the $$.
4.0,"This is one size fits all, so it makes sense it may not fit well. I am usually a med/large, and have 36DD boobs...and it fit me kind of loose and flowy looking. I am sad, I wanted it to look more contoured like in the photo. If the waist was a drawstring that would help, but it is not, it is just elastic, so it cannot get any tighter.  That being said, it looks great, and I will definitely wear it. I will add a photo when I wear it."
4.0,Good price for the glasses
4.0,Very nice setup but the only problem was that where my jacket had rubbed on the case it rubbed the white off of it and turned it a different color
4.0,Hands look great a little bit tight to put on
4.0,Good quality. I have a size 12 boot and it's a little small. The size is the reason for only 4 stars
4.0,As described. Very cute.  I like that you can flip them and use either pattern.
4.0,"I really l I keep this shirt feels nice, just a bit too big I bought a medium probably could wear a small"
4.0,Ordered this for my roommate for Halloween. Fit well. Decent material and worked for the night which is the only reason we got it.
4.0,Beautiful! Only problem was the earring back was loose and would not stay secure.
4.0,"The dress did rip slightly when putting it on which was disappointing, but overall fit was good and its it's a very cute dress. Dont know that I can wear it again due the rip although I'd absolutely love to. Might be able to sew it."
4.0,It’s okay. I don’t really like how it fits on me. It swallows me. But it looks better when wearing heels. Somewhat itchy. Nice color. The side split is very high.
4.0,Not a bad belt.  Sets off airport metal detectors.
4.0,Strap keeps slipping out of loop
4.0,Good; except that it has no front opening
4.0,"I thought these ran a little big, so I ordered an Adult Small...thinking it would fit a little loose.  But runs more true to size.  It is wide, just a little short, so if you want a bigger fit and are over 5'5&#34;, I would go up a size."
4.0,these r cute but they fall off easily
4.0,Love these. I did not think it would matter when we packed but it is great to go from suitcase to draw with nothing getting messed up. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is two of the section's zipper broke off. We do travel a lot.
4.0,"These are nice crystals with a good size drilled hole which is helpful, I’ve ordered the clear, pink and green so far. The green had a couple different shades but that’s to be expected, the pink was great and the clear was ok, they are pretty cloudy or I’d dare say white/milky quartz but still pretty, but this is the 4 stars. Also, the price point is just fair, however I still recommend if your looking for these types of stones with nicely drilled holes."
4.0,Fit well with the adjustable straps. Really strong plastic odor. Bought them so they can be used in the garden so no big deal. But don't think I'd wear them out in public.
4.0,Looks great... makes the ass look good
4.0,"Very pretty ring. It's a nice big center stone, but not too big. Only complaint I have is that the two small side settings are very pointy. They jab my skin and catch on clothing. I may return the ring due to this. I'm afraid it could cause the settings to become lose."
4.0,cutsy
4.0,Good quality adjustable bands;  metal buckle is a close match to color of Samsung smart-watch!
4.0,Love the material and the way it looks! Also love the double pockets! I don’t have that insta-booty in these shorts but they are worn very often because they’re so cute
4.0,"After shoulder surgery, I was looking for an easy to put on shirt. I picked this one and one other. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to put on without assistance. I do have a wife who helps change my shirt, luckily. I think next time I will need Velcro."
4.0,"This is a very cute necklace with some really fun pieces on it.  The first time I wore it my grandson touched it and it fell apart so I contacted the seller and they immediately sent me a new one with no questions asked.  It is long enough that it can go over your head to put it on and it matches a lot of my outfits.  The price was pretty low so if it doesn't last long I can't complain, but so far it has held up well.<br />PRO:  It is very cute with interesting and fun pieces.  It matches a lot of different outfits.<br />CON:  It would probably break if someone pulls too hard on it."
4.0,Cool rain coat .... a little thin but ok
4.0,Very cute! Larger than I thought.
4.0,"I like the color, material and the way they feel and fit! Great pants!"
4.0,I bought these for my mother. She loves to sleep in booties that have rubber grip and that won’t fall off during the night. They are a little wide. The toe to heel fits to size. May even run a half size small. I usually wear a 7.5-8.0. And they fit me perfect. Except for the wide feeling. They also seem more like a pool shoe and not a house slipper. They appear well made but not so great for soft comfort. Maybe with a pair of socks would be perfect and it met the needs I bought it for.  Probably would not buy again. Only because of price vs. cozy comfort.
4.0,I love this skirt. I've worn it a number of times and it fits exactly as it should. The material has faded rather quickly which makes me sad. But it is black denim so I guess that is expected.
4.0,"I like the strap, but the one thing I wanted it for was a secure place to store the lens cap and the zippered pockets are too small fir that purpose."
4.0,These are flirty and adorable. A fancy sophistiCAT with jingly red and green bell clustered bells. Fun gift for a cat lover.
4.0,Simply Wow!!!!
4.0,It's very lovely to look at but the beads are too small and the flowers are way too big.<br />On the other hand it is well presented in a box for a gift as you said and was well packed and arrived before the time it was promised.
4.0,Tiny bit on the small side. The bottom of the dress is rather heavy and thick but still very comfortable and pretty.
4.0,The straw is a little rickety but I like the shapeability and spikes on the faux leather band.
4.0,Beautifully boxed.  Beautiful pendants.  The customer service is excellent and prompt if you do need anything replaced.
4.0,"Very nice, I'm satisfied with the product"
4.0,"Great sweatshirt, no frills.  They do seem to run a little big."
4.0,My son loves the shirt. We ordered a large and it fits more like a medium. Got here faster than we expected.
4.0,"This dress is made of a nice material and is super cute.  It runs a bit big though.  The arms were way too long for me and the bell sleeves don't look very ""bell"" because the elastic around the hem is not very tight.  It is very stretchy and soft material though.  I am going to keep it and try to sew the arm holes a little tighter and shrink it in the dryer."
4.0,"I bought a size larger because after the first wash they shrink some and fit awkwardly. This did shrink slightly, but not enough to complain about. Go canes!"
4.0,Cute dress. True to color but it definitely has a &#34;nightgown&#34; feel to it. Not reall a work dress. A tad on the short side for my taste as well. Overall though those are about the complaints I have.
4.0,Nice suit and fits good.  The top is a little tight but fits fine.
4.0,"Tighter than I expected, especially with studying up to the XXL. I usually wear conformable large and baggy xl... I'm 160 at 5'3&#34; of that helps. Love the look, just wish it was a bit looser!"
4.0,Keeps my head warm and my ears happy.
4.0,"It's pretty tight if you have a big head (like me), so I hope it stretches out later on from use. It's very secure though and especially helps if you have sensitive ears with strong winds."
4.0,"I kept one and gifted the other and they are really cute and warm, the only downside is they like to ride  up my hand."
4.0,Gloves comfortable havent used them in severe cold yet
4.0,"Got the standard Cap in the red Mario version for a homemade low budget cosplay. The cap is ok, the quality is according to the $$ you pay. My only caveat, and the reason I am not giving 5 stars, is that you can fill part of the inside mesh at the top of the cap. Due me being bald, it scratches a little of the top of my head. Will put a small patch there, but found it a little annoying."
4.0,Very pretty and dainty but it’s tiny - VERY small! Perfect for a tween.
4.0,"My 9 year old son loves these! They are not the same sizes though, but all fit him. He complains only 1 fits him perfectly and the other one are a smidgen too tight or loose. He's worn all 3, wash well in washer and hang dry."
4.0,Child LOVED the pajamas! Washed them before use & no fading occurred which was great. The only reason not 5 stars is because the color design seems like a thick vinyl so want to be careful how pajamas are folded to avoid cracking or sticking to another vinyl area.
4.0,They were just what i wanted but they were too small. But a very nice gift.
4.0,Nice colors and the material was very soft. Good for girls too.
4.0,Hungry
4.0,"I couldn't tell how big it was by the picture,so it was smaller than I expected, but It is just what I wanted."
4.0,"Like this cardigan, goes with everything. Longer than I would like, petite sizes would be helpful."
4.0,"I was very hesitant to buy this handbag because of the mixed reviews about the size. But I loved it as soon as I received it. It’s very practical and indeed small but much bigger than what I anticipated as some ppl were saying it was super small (maybe it’s just me, but it’s the perfect size). I carry very minimal so maybe that’s why. It fits my planner, wallet, pencil pouch and keys perfectly. However, I do agree that if you carry more than that then you’ll need a much bigger handbag. It’s super cute!"
4.0,its pretty cheap but nice aesthetic
4.0,They were somewhat snug doesn't really stretch but overall I love them!
4.0,"Very comfy, fits great, true to size."
4.0,These are excellent for holding uniform shirts down. I’ve been using these for years. The first one I ordered lasted over a year. The second one I ordered last only a few months. Hopefully the one I recently purchased last as long as the first.
4.0,It's a decent inexpensive hat and the quality is okay too. (For the record) mine was made in China.
4.0,"I bought a large and should have gone a size larger, the belt is just long enough to barely tie it. Other than that, I love the feel of the fabric."
4.0,"Cute slippers , nice colors , sturdy but not as soft as pictured."
4.0,"I love the look of this jacket. It's very pretty and thick and warm. I am probably in between sizes (m/l) but I chose a large to stay on the safe side. I am 5'9"" and 135lbs with a 36DD chest. My chest size is why I went up to a large. The only thing I don't like about the jacket is that the loops where the belt goes is about 2-3"" too high compared to my natural waist line. So I may end up removing or replacing the loops lower in order to hit my natural waist line. Other than that the jacket is lovely and absolutely worth the price."
4.0,"The dress is slightly low cut but add a little camisole under it and it's perfect for the office, but if you have a hot date and want to show a little cleavage it's great for that too 😉.  I honestly was going to buy a different color at first (darker) but seeing this one in the reviews I changed my mind and LOVE it.<br />It can be causal with a pair of white flat sandals or dress it up with highs.  Easy care and doesn't wrinkle much at all.<br />My only disappointment is that since it's a jersey type of material it did get picks in the fabric from the rubbing of my backpack walking to/from work.  I'm short so the backpack rests on my hip area.<br />For the price I'm not going to worry about it and try to carry the bag differently, as I'm going to buy more, and I'm not really a dress kind of girl.  The xlarge is a little loose on me (but still looked good) and it is very comfortable but I think I will order a large and see how I like it.  I will not say it hides the lumps & bumps but it blends them in very well, so hoping going a bit smaller will not mess that up.  Honestly can not say enough about this great easy carefree dress for the price."
4.0,I like this shirt. It is comfortable. It is a little longer than I expected but I like the width.
4.0,Fit great and got them quick
4.0,i like size but wider than i anticipated... should've read details a bit closer. will work great for bigger purse though!
4.0,"Pros: Price vs the cost of OEM Pandora beads, look is very good for what your paying, sizing is about right compared to OEM beads<br />Cons: Color is off from what the picture shows not as blue or purple as the pictures."
4.0,"Great size, sturdy material but rather coarse even after washing."
4.0,"Bought for my wife. She likes the size, small and compact. Lots of compartments. Always wants a zipper for change, a slot for cash, a place for credit cards, and a separate place for ID. Fun pattern too!"
4.0,"The color of the garment is printed onto the fabric, it's not a dyed fabric. So, the back-side of the fabric is white. It is soft, and didn't over-shrink on its first wash (hung to dry), although it did shrink a good bit. I really wish these had pockets - I kept trying to put my hands in my pockets all day today, but there aren't any."
4.0,Liked the color<br />Disliked it was too stretchy kept crawling up my back
4.0,"These packing cubes are AMAZING! It felt like my suitcase doubled in size because of how organized they helped me be.  They were a little thin and I worry about their durability, but that does make them more flexible and they shouldn't be introduced to any extreme conditions. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the purchase!"
4.0,This is an awesome bane mask! I got for Valentine’s Day (wife and I did a villains themed valentines this year) I love doing the bane voice with the kid and this mask helps amplify it just naturally. The looks and form fit surprisingly well.
4.0,"This ring is very beautiful, but it runs small so it did not fit the person it was intended to be given too."
4.0,"This is a really nice hat for hot summer weather. The mesh panels allow air to flow over sweaty hair/head and keep you cool. The hat did have a smell pretty reminiscent of clothing dye, and definitely holds onto the sweat odor, but is easy to wash and dries super quickly.<br /><br />I did notice a few loose threads and seams that weren't absolutely perfect, however for the price I would definitely recommend to a friend."
4.0,pls beautiful dress if i cou;d get one to fit i am going to try elarge next time i an 110 lbs and this is a real production
4.0,"fun watch, nice for every day"
4.0,"Kinda small, will hopefully fit after pregnancy"
4.0,Super super cute!  Really high and not for a long night of standing or dancing!
4.0,I bought this for my daughter to give to her grandmother. It's cute little bracelet. I like it myself. It's kinda hard to put in though. Pulling the strings to tighten it with one hand isn't easy.
4.0,"Cute skirt but too short on me. But I’m 5’10, so I run into this issue often"
4.0,They have a nice luster. They fit my ears well and are comfortable. I have been wearing them for a few days no issues.
4.0,"Lovely gown. Only problem is that the fancy hem on the front does not continue around to the back, so that kind of looks &#34;unfinished.&#34; Would be much better if the decorative hem was ALL the way around the bottom. A little screwy that way... Very nice otherwise. Made in China."
4.0,"Really cute shoes! I'm pleasantly surprised about the quality of the shoe.  They are however a bit roomy, order your true size. [[ASIN:B01NAUVBZD Delicious women's block heel sandal Collect MVE Shoes mve shoes editha black size 8.5]]"
4.0,"The shorts are a bit shorter than shown in the pic, but they are soft and comfy and lightweight"
4.0,"Order this for a talent competition to fake MJ moves. Perfect since I didnt want my face to be recognized at all with the wig all over and uncontrollable.  Other than the unmanageable wig, I would give this 5 stars."
4.0,Comfy stretch material. Great price too!
4.0,A little flimsier than I expected but it will work with leggings.
4.0,"My daughter wore these between 15 - 20 months old when we would play outside and it was wet, muddy, snowy, whatever.  They were great at keeping her feet dry and warm and sparing her other regular sneakers from all the mud (but much easier than big clumsy boots).  They run a bit small -- she wore a size 5 in this when her other shoes were size 4.  But that might also be related to the way you put them on . . . they are slide off & on . . . so you need a bit of extra room to get them on (had they been laces, I may have been able to get her into a 4).  The bottoms are pretty thick and so she was walking up high on them, if that makes sense.  I worried she might turn her ankle in them, but she never did.  There were times she requested these instead of her regular sneakers, she really liked them a lot.  And I did too.  We got loads of compliments and comments about how cute they were."
4.0,I love the material that it is made out of. They are very comfortable. Only downside is as it gets higher on the thigh the white parts become more see through. Overall it is cute and comfortable and pretty nice for the price you pay.
4.0,Good shirt for the price. Well made and comfortable.
4.0,The button broke off after 2X being in the Washer/Dryer. Other then that great pair of pants love the fact that it ties on the bottom so doesn’t matter how tall/short it’ll fit.
4.0,Son loved these but... a stitch popped after the first few days. He didn't care and still plays with them.
4.0,Cute n fits well. Side pockets would make this a five star active wear jacket; the little pocket on the back was a pointless and inefficient idea.
4.0,"Did not work for me - 5'1"" 150 lbs, pear shape. I REALLY wanted this to work. I love the style, the vintage details and the length, but the bodice was too big. If I had sized down, the skirt would have been too small. This would likely work for someone with a fuller chest."
4.0,"For the most part I love it and the pattern is so cute. However, w iui th it being the light silky fabric it would suck in when you breathe.  I used a plastic shield underneath and it was fine."
4.0,Fit ideal
4.0,Shirt looks fine structure wise but the material is a little see through in some places not to the point where you can see underneath but some places are thicker like the button area so it’s noticeable that it’s see through
4.0,cute for sunbathing!
4.0,"Glasses work well but it's difficult to carry them around without the case, you can't fold them flat because they have no hinges. Normally I put them through my upper button hole which works well for transport. The design is clearly shown. I was hoping they could be folded flat in some way but they can't, at least I can't manage it. They are light weight as advertised."
4.0,"the material is good looking, it glows very bright! and time will have its last word if the wallet last . . ."
4.0,"I was happily surprised when I received this beautiful necklace with it's delicate pendant. I prefer simplistic jewelry but with a unique flair. This piece didn't disappoint. The calla flower is beautiful and the delicate, just the right size if you like understated. What surprised me is the necklace which looks and feels like silk. I love it. I'm holding back one star because it came with a round closing clasp rather than a lobster clasp. This can be changed so it's okay. I'm happy :)"
4.0,Great looking booties with a good but not great sole was a little slippery coming in from the snow onto a different surface in an inside building
4.0,The shoes are very lightweight
4.0,"A little tight for the size I chose, but I like it either way. :)"
4.0,Nice charm. I really like the color.
4.0,These are super cute and true to size.
4.0,"I had a few pairs of Hanes boxer/briefs and really liked them, 100% polyester was hard to find in stores, but I really liked the feel. I thought 4 for this price was an ok deal, but you just never know about sizing. I know with these types of underwear you don't want too small and definitely not too large! I went with medium but thought they were too tight, but after wearing a pair all day I think they will work fine. They seem to stay in place, no pulling up all day. I received 2 black, 1 blue, 1 multi color, so I'm happy with my purchase."
4.0,"Like other reviews, these run small.  I got them a size and a half larger than she usually wears and they just have a &#34;little room to grow&#34;.  Seem to be well made.  The soles are slip resistant.  Very cute.  It's hard to find girls dress shoes without a heel.  She loves them."
4.0,"It's a very cute pendant, but it's very small. I will definitely wear it, but keep in mind that it's kind of tiny."
4.0,Just got it but very nice. Quality good. Hopefully it will work.
4.0,bought these to put charms on whenever another necklace of mine breaks. so far none of them have broken as replacements and i don't believe any were damaged when i received them. somewhat flimsy/light but actually surprisingly good for the price.
4.0,This is a very comfortable nightgown. It also did not shrink which was good.
4.0,"Earrings are just as shown on the website, I'm satisfied."
4.0,"Nice,  light weight dress for dancing.  The description stated a boat neckline,  but it was rather small and not close to the shoulders.  Other than that,  it was a good buy."
4.0,"Mom really like this, very comfortable"
4.0,The purse is very pretty but the chain is nowhere near long enough to be used as a crossbody. I am 5'1 and the purse goes above my waist.
4.0,"Extremely lightweight and comfortable, not sure how they will wear but so far so good."
4.0,Heavier than you'd think.  Bother​ my ears after a day
4.0,"Great product,I love that there is so many of each color because im always accidentally knocking it out my nose and since there so small I can never find it but i know i will have tons of extras. The size is great and will fit most all nose piercing sizes. My only complaint is that only the blues,and the red are bold and bright and colorful the rest are very light and washed out."
4.0,Purchased 6t for daughter a little snug.
4.0,Beautiful ring. Perfect for my 14 year old!!
4.0,"Maybe I ordered too large, but the fingers were a little too long and I could wrap the wrist strap around most of my wrist which resulted in it being very loose there. Very comfortable and could incredibly easily use my smartphone with them on! Overall I'll give 4 stars because the fingers are a bit longer than I anticipated and the wrist strap, while it does look nice, wasn't very functional."
4.0,"Cute and super comfortable. If you like lots of compression on your belly, these aren't what you're looking for. But hey! pockets!"
4.0,I'm a size 13 and these sock's fit as expected. They are comfortable.
4.0,"Based on the sizing I purchased a XL however, after it arrived I realized that it was pretty big. A large would of fit perfectly. The dress is gorgeous and it is of good quality. I used this dress for a bridesmaids dress and it worked out perfectly."
4.0,I've order these before and they were nice.<br /><br />However this time they were light white and very pale looking barely no yellow representing the citrine color. Im just so tired of returning things on Amazon.<br />Many of the Vendors don't Q.A their shipping products which result in many unnessary returns. Hypnotic Gems have been the only sellers to reach out to me personally and correct issues right away. Sending me nicer stones with vibrant colors at no additional charge. Very customer service oriented and professional. I will continue purchasing from them because this Owner cared.
4.0,"Love these EXCEPT for the sizing. These are being sold in s, m, l and xl. I ordered a small for my 8 yr old and a large for myself.  I opened the small and it looked great.....like a small pair of leggings. Then, I opened the large, and it was the exact same. There is no size printed on the inside.  I thought it was a mistake so I returned and asked for a 'large'. Again, I was sent the same size. Apparently,  these are one size fits most.  They do stretch,  but a small and large should be different.  I'll keep them at this point,  but I would say these are a 'medium'. Very soft."
4.0,"This scarf is HUGE. I like it a lot, but it's HUGE. It's laying funny in the photo, because of the wind, but hopefully this photo helps you to visualize it. I'm 5' 3&#34;."
4.0,"I ordered up a size based on reviews, but probably should have just ordered my regular size. Otherwise nice."
4.0,Nice comfort and quality for the price. A great all around athletic shirt.
4.0,"I wanted an easy on/easy off set of gloves to use in the car while driving to protect my hands from the sun that hits the steering wheel.  These are good options except they are a very slippery material (like panties material), so you need to be careful.  The stitching at the finger holes is unraveling a bit.  Overall, they are doing what I needed and don't take up much space in my purse."
4.0,This is so beautiful I haven’t used it yet but I can not wait to
4.0,Sleeves are very wide for a small
4.0,Product smelled a little when it arrived but worked for my walk around the neighborhood trick or treating
4.0,"really snug to fit over shoes ( I kept thinking they were going to rip).  Once I finally got them on they worked great, however"
4.0,fun novelties-  great for my costume
4.0,"Cute bracelet with little rhinestones. If you have a large wrist, this probably won't be big enough for you. Would make a nice gift for daughter or teen girl."
4.0,"I have the ruby in zoisite bracelet and it has wonderful, vivid colors. The fossil bracelet is nice too, but the pattern is less obvious than I hoped because of the small size of the beads. It is still very nice. The only thing I do not like is that I have large hands, and I would like the fossil bracelet to have a couple of more beads, because it's a bit too snug. The elastic thread that binds the beads of both bracelets looks a bit fragile and it does stick out a bit and make the bracelet look cheap, I might have to replace it."
4.0,"Size: I'm 5'7&#34;, wear a 36C, medium/large tops, and 8-10 in women's pants. Bought the XL and it fits nicely!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Great fit! Its flowy so it hides my tummy after eating large meals (which is often)<br />2. Beautiful blue color! I always get complimented when I wear this dress.<br />3. Doesn't wrinkle, which is a plus since I travel a lot.<br />4. Versatile. Cute with sandals or heels.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. I've only washed it 4 or 5 times and the seam in the arm started unraveling.  I can fix the seam, but it's annoying having to do so after just a few washes.<br />2. It didn't come with the belt :("
4.0,Love the pattern and not too expensive
4.0,"This hat fit very well, size medium for me. Keeps my ears very warm while blocking the sun out of my eyes. Appears to be very well made, but I have not washed it yet so I can’t speak to how it will hold up to that. The only drawback to the hat and the reason I’m only giving 4 stars is that the rear portion is short enough to allow cold wind to hit my neck. A lot of hats are like this, I assume to keep a jacket collar from pushing the hat up in back. But I’ve rarely found that to be a problem. Curving the rear up short like this just allows more wind in especially for those with short hair or who are hair challenged as I am. I frequently wear a neck gator in cold windy conditions so I can deal with this but if it were longer in back it would be a 5 star product."
4.0,"Feel great. Look great. For a while...these pants are so comfortable, but they PILL PILL PILL like crazy! Really, they'll be nothing but lint balls in under a month of routine washing. Even inside out. I'm now trying a laundry bag, but...it's a real downer."
4.0,Got this for my daughter and it fits great
4.0,They're cute but they ride up. I wanted to use them as running shorts but I'll just have to wear them around the house.
4.0,"It was a very nice dress. It was short, and I'm 5'2, (I ordered an XL) but I am very curvy so that added another element to it. Over all good buy.<br />I would definitely recommend."
4.0,"Nicely made, but it is really thin!"
4.0,"They work, the glow in the dark ones are green though - just a heads up!"
4.0,"These brooches are good quality. They are a good size and are really cute. The only, minor issue is with the color of the brooch on the left. It is not as orange as pictured online. I can see in the online pictures that it is lighter than the jack o lantern, but in real life, it is almost a yellow gold. My picture actually makes it look like it has color, but in reality it is a lot paler. It is really a minor issue that I can overlook, but if you were thinking it was orange, it is not."
4.0,"Gets tangled a little but for the price, its a great buy!"
4.0,Makes my hips look huge (bc of pockets i guess...? *eye roll*) and the waistband is a bit tight
4.0,"Nice quality and comfortable.  Only complaint for me is the zipper is a little wonky.  It works fine and It’s not a cheap zipper, just different."
4.0,"I love these jeans but they are a bit too tight for me.  I am 5’6”, 125 lbs.  I ordered a 7 and they fit but NO breathing room!  The thing that annoys me is that I really tried to read all reviews and asked questions about the sizing but never got answers."
4.0,"I’m only giving 4 stars because I haven’t gotten to wear it yet other than to try it on. It seems comfortable, perfect size and breathable which is the number one thing I was looking for for work. It’s also a cute turtle design and I love turtles!"
4.0,"Very thick fabric, so it will be great for Chicago winter months, but I'd love to see a lighter summer-weight version!"
4.0,Gorgeous dress but the sleeves were a little tight
4.0,"I ordered this dress about too sizes too big because I needed to make sure it was to my knees in length. Even with sizing up, it was barely long enough. Despite the sizing up, the top and sleeves of the dress still fit comfortably because of the jersey-like nature of the fabric. The red color is more rich than pictured... It's deeper than a primary red color. Overall the dress is cute, flattering, and comfy. I've worn it quite a bit already. It's super cute for fall over leggings and boots! I'd definitely reorder and definitely recommend."
4.0,Nice material and and construction. They appear to be quality socks.  I ordered S/M size but the fit is too big in the foot and leg for me.  I wear a women's size 7 shoe. There is no smaller size and will be returning both pairs.
4.0,"It goes a little further past the knees than expected, I'm 5'6&#34; and I ordered 4-6. The bust fits fine though, the fabric doesn't hug as much as I imagined, though if it did I'm sure it'd be itchy, so it's loose for comfortability. It will need to be steam ironed some since packaging wrinkled the pleats almost entirely."
4.0,"Decent size,"
4.0,This is a nice dress ordered a small but it was a bit bigger than expected just some minor adjustments but a good buy
4.0,"My wife wanted nice looking casual shorts (something other than exercise or yoga shorts) to wear for social occasions. These shorts actually look pretty nice, but they do run a bit on the large size. They are soft and comfortable and wash well. It would be helpful to have back pockets on them, but that is typical for women's clothing."
4.0,I love this sweater!!! The material is comfy and soft. I wish I would have ordered a large instead of XL it still fits I just have a lot of room. I’m 5”11 185 you can see how long it comes on me. I will be ordering other colors.
4.0,"These are beautiful glasses. The only problem for me is that the fit is loose. If I lean down without holding them, they would likely fall right off. I’m almost afraid to wear them for this reason. Otherwise, they are stunning and expensive looking. They come in a nice, reusable box with a soft pouch and a cleaning rag.<br /><br />If your head isn’t tiny, I would recommend these, especially if there is a deal or promo."
4.0,Just got to break them in.
4.0,Very comfy. It's a must have. Every girl needs one of these in their closet
4.0,"I’m 5’7 145 lbs athletic/hour glass shape. I ordered the XL according to the size chat and it fits as well as a $40 something dress is expected to fit. It’s tight in the chest, but I just wore a tight tube top bra and it fit. The embroidery is just a tag crooked, but all together this is a lovely dress and very lightweight for hot ren fair days!"
4.0,They fit well I was worried that they would be itchy but I think they are very soft and comfortable.
4.0,"Same here, it took a while but I do like them."
4.0,Great for easy packing. One of the zippers broke on my first use. But there are 2 pulls so I just zip it from the side that works.  Made it so easy to unpack too. Just pull tgem out and put in the drawers.
4.0,Keeps me so warm
4.0,These were cute and well made but ran big on me and were returned.
4.0,The material is sort of shiny and polyester like. More of a dress for a church or party; not the beach.
4.0,The material is a bit thin
4.0,"It is a very nice bracelet and is just as pictured. However, I am a bit concerned that the knot will come undone as this has happened before on other products that have similar knots. We shall see."
4.0,I loved this dress.It has a good quality fabric and it is true to size.
4.0,Very wide in the midsection.
4.0,"This is absolutely gorgeous! It makes me feel like a princess. However, it can be hard to hold in place. Bobby pins can help. If you don’t have very sensitive skin you can also spray just a light mist of hairspray on your forehead to heel the chains in place as well."
4.0,"Very nice comb, my daughter loved it."
4.0,It works! My son needed gray to match his uniform. He works outside and can't wear just any color! So I am happy I could find this color! It will help him to get through his routes all summer!
4.0,Very pretty but not quite as oversized as it appears. Daughter loves it anyhow. Seems to be decent quality. I might buy another.
4.0,Fun soft and oversize sweater
4.0,They are bigger than I thought it was going to be but not complaining. They are cute earrings and come with a little storage bag.
4.0,"We got this hat for a novelty purpose.  It is a thin, costume type material, but made well.  Fits well.  Arrived quickly and in great condition."
4.0,Nothing spectacular about it.<br />Runs 1 size small.<br />Don’t know if I’d buy again.
4.0,"Overall, these shorts are great. Fit as expected, lightweight, and comfortable. However, the construction of one seam was inferior. The fabric appears to have been ‘chopped’, thus not being caught fully in the seam allowance. This resulted in an tearing apart of the seam. I hadn’t caught this until I had worn the shorts a couple of times. Something that I never would have expected in a garment like this. Disappointing!!"
4.0,Took about three weeks for delivery. Cute but not that warm. Sleeves are very long but easily rolled up. My daughter isn't sure about the big fur hood but it is SO darling for moderate weather. Definitely too puffy to wear in the car seat
4.0,Darling.  Fit my 6'2&#34; son and his 5'2&#34; wife.
4.0,"I love this dress, I got it in green in a size large. I'm curvy I usually wear l/xl or size 14/16. My only complaint is that it's very long I'm 5&#34;5 and i kept tripping so I decided to do a knot on the bottom. That fixed the issue."
4.0,"Soft and comfy, just don't quite fit my legs all the way"
4.0,"The longer, higher waisted black and white skirt is adorable...fits really great / flattering the quality isn’t bad. But my skirt arrived with a stain and very unpleasant odor. The zipper was also stuck and very hard to pull. I think this one was just defective but other than that I would recommend"
4.0,100% recomended
4.0,"Nice shorts, I bought a pair from Costco, but got damaged. So delighted that I found them on Amazon."
4.0,"I was expecting more of a plum/purple color but instead got a dark crimson shade. Still cute and fits true to size, just not the color I was hoping for."
4.0,This mask is extremely durable and seems to be doing its job really well. It rarely breaks like my old ones.
4.0,"I made sure to read the reviews before purchasing. Normally I wear smalls and this suggested a medium but I went with a large. The arms are a little snug but the rest of the hoodie fits as expected. Heat seems to work very well, have not tried it out doors yet. So far I am satisfied with it."
4.0,"I just don't think these are high impact.  They are very stretchy and comfortable but don't hold the goods down when jumping.  And as the size guide indicates I ordered a 3x for a 44DD/E, but i wish I'd ordered the 2x.  I like the look and style but want a sports bra I can jump in as I do a lot of HIIT workouts.  I could wear these for walking or just lifting but not High impact.  I love the insert cup as it hides big nipples though."
4.0,Fits well washes well
4.0,The chain is very nice but not quite 18&#34;. More like 17 and change. It will have to do though.
4.0,I got a size a lot bigger I wear a size XL and the pants I had to buy 2x the 2X fits perfect. The pants look beautiful I love the design and the material.
4.0,"Love these pants! Nice light cotton material that’s great for the spring or summer weather! I bought these for Cancun, Mexico worrying that they would be too thick + they’re black but they’re perfect!! The drawstrings go all the way up to the deep pockets so you can make the pants into drop crotch Bermuda shorts!! Only downside is the pants have no back pockets (which I was really looking forward to) and the material doesn’t look as “shiny” as it does in the picture. I’m a dancer so these totally fit my goth athleisure style and they don’t cost an arm and a leg for great fashion."
4.0,"I usually wear a small/medium in tops. I am 5'1"", around 120 lbs & wear a 32D. Bought a medium in this top and it is snug in the armpits. It seems like the straps should be just an inch or two longer, & the problem would be solved. The length of this top is perfect for me & rests on my hips, so I wouldn't recommend this for anyone taller than 5'4"" unless you want it to appear cropped. I have worn and washed it twice, but haven't dried it because if it shrinks at all it will be too small. I may order a different color in large to see if that fits less snug in the armpit area. The color is accurate and it seems to be made of good quality material."
4.0,"I really wanted silver toned and smaller cuffs. However, I knew that's not what this was.  (Nothing annoys me more than when people give bad reviews because they didn't read the description, but I digress...) Admittedly I got the gold cuz it was cheaper figuring I'd save the silver version for when and if I find dainty ones. Something a little more delicate. This product was exactly as described. It has a nice weight to it and I've opened and closed the cuffs quite a bit with no issue. They feel like they could break after LOTS of use though. I'm a little disappointed because someone said in a review that they weren't as yellow as pictured, a bit softer. They may have even described it as more of a rose gold. That's not true, at least not for mine. They are quite yellow. Fun product and proving to be of quality so far!"
4.0,I dont normally buy something that I can't try on first but I was very impressed with the quality and comfort of this hat. would definitely recommend.
4.0,"They are great bras, I would really suggest going up a size or two as the cup size is on the smaller side."
4.0,"Nice fit, fabric soft and comfy. Shipping took a long time since it came from China, but good price so worth while."
4.0,Xl is tight but would be warm in early winter months  !
4.0,"I wear it every day for two reasons.  My Grandson is an Army medic stationed in S. Korea, and I like having my reading glasses with me all the time.<br />I am proud to wear the flag."
4.0,"Excellent, inexpensive product delivered promptly."
4.0,Too tight in the legs
4.0,no indication front or back
4.0,I absolutely love them! I did have to use pliers to make the connections tighter as one of them fell apart! But luckily I had all the parts and all was not lost! Because I love them! So my recommendation is to check the connecting links before wearing. But I got a lot of compliments and I love how they don’t look like clip-ons. They are very comfortable and just the right size.
4.0,"Gown fits as expected, but material was thin."
4.0,should have gotten wider brim
4.0,great workout pants also casual wear
4.0,Love this dress.  Fits as expected.  It can easily be dressed up or down.
4.0,"I'm 5' 1&#34;, and weigh 115-120 pounds (ice cream makes it variable).  I purchased a Medium, and it is just loose enough to make me comfortable.  I don't like to wear tight clothes (see ice cream), and this tunic moves easily over my form.  The fabric is good, and will layer with ease."
4.0,This is a great band however can be difficult to install.  One side was just too wide and I fought with it for awhile.
4.0,soft material my daughter love it
4.0,They stopped working after a while but they’re good if you’re just trying out gloving
4.0,It's nice to have to track the baby's foot growth and my toddler enjoys to use it himself. It's easy to use and to read.
4.0,Nice leather band unfortunately had to return because it was too big. Fits a men’s or large women’s watch
4.0,"Very comfortable shoes for a couple of hours, could use additional support/cushion for walking."
4.0,Loved this item. Worked well with my son's birthday decor.
4.0,"Great dimensions, easy curves.  Athletics shoulder width needed, thanks!  Fabric DOES pill, but keeps structure.  Rayon comes in many varieties, a sustainability check and upgrade would likely be followed by customers -- including seamless reversals."
4.0,"The hat came in perfectly with no problem but it is somewhat small on me, I would like to perhaps exchange for a bigger one."
4.0,"PROS: Fit well/true to size, love the a-line with ruffled bottom. An appropriate length for church or wedding. Is not see-through, nor itchy.<br /><br />CONS: This color/print is hideous. The puffy shoulder is weird. The wrist elastic cuff looks cheap.<br /><br />4 stars because it has many pros, but this dress is not my style."
4.0,"I am not a tall person but these pants do run very short. The material is good quality and they are comfortable but be warned, they run short."
4.0,Ran small. Had to return
4.0,Although these didn't work out for me. It was decent quality and the hinge was hidden.
4.0,"The product is fine, just as advertised.  The packing in a padded envelope was a poor choice and the glasses were received damaged.  They were promptly replaced.. Thank you."
4.0,pretty but bigger than I thought it would be
4.0,sweater is great actually to hot to wear in 40 degree temps.
4.0,Good quality readers for a reasonable price.  my only disatisfaction is I wanted visible frame only above eyes and clear glass on most of bottom half.  Just was not able to find this style at a reasonable price - no problem with these at all except they were not exactly what I had in mind
4.0,It looks very nice but it runs very small. I got it for my SO but it barely fits a 12-year-old girl! get a bigger size if you can.
4.0,I tried this jumpsuit on the day that I received it.<br />It fits well and looks so cute on.
4.0,"There's one flaw that I do not like but other than that I enjoy wearing these bras. It's soft, stretchy, and decent in thickness. The only downfall are the plastic lining (seam) by the bra pad opening. The plastic sticks out from under the thread and it irritates the crap outta my skin. It's like having a strand of hair under your shirt throughout day."
4.0,"I love these! The 80s Jean pattern is so cute and the large fits well in the waist, but the length is a little short for my liking. I am very average ht so not normally an issue"
4.0,There are a little bito heavy and look a little disproportionate on smaller ears. But they still are really cute. Also don’t expect them to come quick it took a month or two for them to arrive.
4.0,"Regale unos y deje estos, no son pesados"
4.0,Hangars are too floppy and loose but otherwise i am enjoying long lasting creases in my levis.
4.0,Love the dress but it was a tad too big.  I am 5'6&#34; and weight around 170 and normally wear a 12.  The dress almost fits but is loose around the waist.  I have an hourglass figure with full bust and hips.  MY husband loves the dress though and can't stop talking about how sexy it is.
4.0,I loved  the. Softness  of the.leather and the color. I only have use of one arm and hand and it.made it a little to difficult to carry. I put all the things i always  carry in my old bag but it was too heavy. The bag is gorgeous and would recommend  it  to all people unless they have dissibilities such as mine<br />BENBROOK  TX
4.0,"Very nice dress!! It feels soft (material is soft). it hides all my imperfections on my figure. I like the floral design on it and it was great for my niece's wedding. It's a little bit static, but it's expected since it's all synthetic material. I would buy a different color. Planning to buy a burgundy color."
4.0,"Was larger than I expected by about an inch. Would not recommend for putting in front pocket.<br />Bought for tiny girl pockets & it does the job. Tight fit for back pockets, doesn't fit in front pockets at all.<br />Would not buy again, but good product for the price."
4.0,Doesnt fit wife's finger
4.0,"These are cute, they must be however 8mm in diameter though, tiny and the ball is 3mm not 4. I do like them. I ordered two. If you are looking for nipple rings please know that they are on the smaller side; I have looked around and they are the best price for a gold ring you can find on the internet. All and all good. Will probably buy a bigger diameter later."
4.0,Nice quality but keep in mind that this is very short!
4.0,"As advertised,  pleased."
4.0,"Cute slippers, like that they have grip on the bottom.  Perfect for wearing around the house in winter."
4.0,"Very nice, high quality poncho.  Works well, fits well.<br /><br />My only complaint with this poncho is the size and weight are a bit much for easy packability.  I was looking for a decent poncho to carry with me when traveling on vacation.  Unfortunately, I won't be sticking this poncho in the pockets of my cargo pants or in my day pack. Its just too big and heavy for that use.<br /><br />That being said, it is still a nice poncho and I will be keeping it in my car for emergencies."
4.0,disappointed in size as I took a larger size and it was still too small
4.0,"I really should give it 5 stars but I can't get the fit exactly as I wish. One hole is too tight, the next one too loose.<br />It's not RIOS fault my wrist size is strange.<br />Excellent strap."
4.0,"The sleeves are snug if you have regular to moderate definition. If you have guns, the  sleeves will be tight.<br />Chest is perfect if you are looking for a slim fit at 40 inches. Tape measure yourself. Any more than 40 and the chest will look like your little brother's shirt.<br />Waist and belly are not super tapered. I have 33 inch waist and this could easily fit 34-36 in waists. Lots of room there.<br />I have 34 in arms and the sleeves are perfect. Longer arms and you might bare your wrists.<br />Shoulders are snug, but will probably loosen up as I wear. Not sure about after I wash. My shoulders are slightly more broad than normal, but not linebacker shoulders for sure.<br /><br />I'll buy in more colors. Perfect for the gym, the couch, or under a denim jacket."
4.0,"First off the hat is cute, super cute and I don't think this time everyone at school will be able to run to the store a month later and clone him.  The tag says 4+!  My son is 6 and it is a bit tight (doesn't stop him from wearing it) I would say smaller than other flipeez.  One ear/wing does not go as high as the other, very similar to the photo... the one side sits lower when the ball is squeezed.  Even after all that I'd highly recommend the hat.  My son loves it, begs to wear it, and gets complimented multiple times daily.  It's adorable and original!"
4.0,"Really cute! Be sure to order one size up. Im 5'8, about 160..Usually wear a medium, but its is very 'fitted', Medium should be considered small."
4.0,Valentine's present for my husband.  This is his second hooded robe.  Wished it was a little thicker.
4.0,"Got a bunch of the raincoasts because of COVID19, goods deliver on time and it is good for one time use. Good price too."
4.0,"Cute sandals but like other reviews mention, the toe gets scuffed very easily. Other than that they're great for everyday wear and very comfortable."
4.0,Very soft. I was expecting black and white but this is more of a tan colour. This is a gift and will work fine.
4.0,Otherwise ok
4.0,"I'm 5'5,175 pounds. I got a size XL. The pants are not transparent, fit well, and the color is exactly like the photo."
4.0,"Cut shirt, but tight around the bust.  Not unwearable, but I wish I would have ordered a larder size."
4.0,Very nice gloves for the price. Large fit like a large. The left and right are different color and texture... but remember these are real leather so there is bound to be differences.
4.0,"so i have 38"" hips and a 36"" bust<br />typically i wear a medium or large shirt- so it was a little weird that amazon suggested a small for my size.<br />i trusted amazon's though (and im glad i did) because this isnt a slim fit at all!<br />its extremely baggy and so much larger than most of my large shirts<br /><br />its very cute though, and the material is nice, just really the biggest size small ive ever seen! it will make a great lazy day shirt though, and the slogan fits perfectly for those kinds of days.<br />i would give 3 stars but the comfort is worth a star on it its own. its just so soft!"
4.0,"This was the second brand of compression socks I have tried. These were a little less expensive so I gave them a go. The compression was comparable to the other brand but the knee band was tighter, dug in and caused an actual bruise. I'm hoping that after a few washings it will loosen up and be more comfortable. If not, I'll snip a few slits in and see if that works. It's unfortunate because this brand has more interesting and fun color choices.  It's not fault of the brand, just my legs/biology in response to it."
4.0,"I am happy with the product, looks good and the price is right. They open easily and need little adjustments to close nice and not to get lost."
4.0,Product fit well and had no visible flaws
4.0,I really love them. The only thing is they are tight around my head and the nose area has no softness so it’s just a little tight an somewhat uncomfortable for long periods of time.. other then that LOVE THEM and they are very sturdy
4.0,They are very comfortable and soft. But the EKG stitching leaves marks on my legs (and the EKG waves are very inaccurate). But over all I really like them and they are nice tight on my legs but loose enough on my feet (size 9.5).
4.0,"Burgundy color is just as shown. Size 16 just barely fits bust 42, waist 37, hips 48. The lining is not a gathered skirt like the chiffon overskirt, but rather like an A-line slip, so it's a bit tight across the hips. I might add a gore, if I can find a matching satin. It's not empire, but the waist is higher than true waist making it more flattering. The lace is like a heavy Venice lace, but made from synthetic, maybe nylon or polyester as opposed to cotton. There were some loose threads and small smudges on the skirt, but not that noticeable. The chiffon is a true woven chiffon, not the knit chiffon that is sometimes used these days for this type of gown. The sleeves and bodice are underlined with same color lightweight powernet, with an inner bodice of the lining satin, with internal foam bust pads Inside this top is edged with silicone stay strip.  Don't know why, as the inner dodice is tacked to the lace so it would stay up without the strip. The sleeves stretch a little bit, so they hold the upper arms in a bit. My bicep is about 15&#34; around and the sleeves just about fit."
4.0,Great tank-top.
4.0,I have ordered 2 of these bracelets and love them. However one was a gift and when my friend wore it the first day the stone fell out! Embarrassing! We glued it back in and so far so good.
4.0,[[ASIN:B06XRZNFH7 Alvaq Womens Summer V Neck Cold Shoulder Top Blouses Plus Size Small Army]] the color says army green but it is really more like a lime green.
4.0,Did not like the top  returned
4.0,"1. The hole for the string can be found on the right side. Inside seam. 2. You're welcome, lol."
4.0,I bought this for my daughter and it was a perfect fit. I wanted to give 5 stars but the bottom wasn’t as wavy as shown. Still a very nice dress.
4.0,My kid was very pleased with this wand. It is similar to the Hermione wand in style but I think it is lighter in color. I give it only 4 stars instead of 5 just because it is pretty light feeling and therefore feels like it could break easily. The carving on it is very nice however. My daughter is using the wand with her Halloween costume and is old enough to know not to knock it on things. I wouldn't recommend it for a younger child who might do so.
4.0,Not to thin or thick
4.0,"I got these to use as shower sandals for the gym. They're good for that type of use. They seem like they would be uncomfortable to use for longer periods of time, but I wouldn't know because I don't wear sandals outside of beach/poolside usage and public gym showers. No complaints."
4.0,"Está bien, pero no me gustó mucho la tela"
4.0,I like the styles and the price is amazing!
4.0,I haven't used the bag yet but at the end of May 2017 I am going on vacation and will be using the bag. But I must say that after careful examination of the bag once it arrived it seems to be a well made bag with more room then I expected. It's the perfect size for me to carry-on everything that I would need while traveling. I will recommend this bag to my friends
4.0,"I got so many compliments the first time I wore this shirt. However, after the first wash, it shrunk somewhat and the fit is not as comfortable as it was. I tried to find it again in a larger size but it wasn't available."
4.0,A nice dress.  A loose fit which I like.
4.0,"Very pretty, but the charm is smaller than expected."
4.0,"Thin Polyester, but not see through. Pretty Nice!"
4.0,"Pocket is little too deep.  In general, I am satisfied."
4.0,comfortable boots
4.0,The gold elephant has turned colors.
4.0,These glasses were purchased to help driving in the rain and snow during night time. Very helpful.
4.0,"This swimsuit fit a little big, and the gold strap for the waist was a bit short and is definitely flimsy. Will trade that in for something else.<br /><br />Otherwise the swimsuit is a good statement piece and will definitely get those heads to turn."
4.0,"This is a beautiful ring, but I doubt it's real silver."
4.0,"I ordered the rosy color and while normally I expect some color differential from the screen, the color was significantly different. It was more of a salmon color. Besides that, the shirt looks great! It does run small though so make sure you size up.<br /><br /> I received this item at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes. I was not paid for my review and was asked to provide whatever feedback I may have about the product, whether it be positive or negative. My review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions of the product."
4.0,the hat came on time and well packeged. it was exactly what I needed. and sturdy. made a Slash costume.
4.0,Pretty color. Good for Christmas parties. Fabric is stretchy and the lace isn’t stiff. You may want to  order a size up as it runs a bit on the smaller size.
4.0,"Thank you, love it"
4.0,Our family is a true Northface fam. I needed a new ski outfit after having kids and being a bigger size. But I would say I wear l/Xl for everything and this ski outfit was pretttttyy tight for an xl
4.0,I liked how the top fits but I had to take it to a seamstress for a gusset
4.0,I like the fit.  I did not like the two tone material.  I guess I should have read the details.
4.0,For the price this is a good quality watch.
4.0,Fit well but I ordered XL instead of my usual L based on reviews.  Liked fabric and should be good for transitional seasons.
4.0,"Based on a previous review I ordered a large where normally I wear a small/medium. I haven washed it yet an it's very tight, I'm 37 weeks I'm hoping it'll fit better after the baby is born. The fabric is a little stretchy and comfortable feel."
4.0,This skirt is okay. The colors up close don’t look BLACK & white though... It’s more of a navy blue. Almost looks like a felt pen colored it in.
4.0,"Tagless, fit as hoped for."
4.0,"Thick, soft. Runs extremely small. Ordered the largest size, they fit my 100lb 12 year old perfectly. She loves them."
4.0,"Definitely not sweat proof, just went for a run & it literally looks like i peed my pants lol. But the fit is good, the color is great, they're squat proof & these are the only pair of leggings i have where the band actually stays where its supposed to while being active"
4.0,Looks really cheap. But it is what I expected for the price
4.0,I wear a size 7 to 7.5 and these fit great and look good too. Now I just need it to rain so I can wear them out :)
4.0,"I love these! They have a great weight to them and they came with a zipper case, and a tiny screw driver key chain!  They are very reflective on the inside, since they aren’t polarized, but I knew that they weren’t polarized when I ordered so I’m not upset about it.  I just won’t wear them to drive ;)"
4.0,This is a fun bracelet to wear and goes with a lot!  The only downside is that I occasionally catch it on my clothes but I can adjust.  It's prettier in person than in the picture.
4.0,Decent quality for the price. Very pretty.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:60d5b964b560eb79b067646da968122]] I do like the fit on these shorts however , firstly it arrived discolored I had to wash right away . Two the contouring can be more I wasn’t blow away with these, the fact it was dirty and you will get roll up on the thighs,  but still Enjoyed the look on my body . Three the color looks more mustard than a bright lemon yellow like the pictures . Overall I will<br />Keep wearing the shorts, but the price point seems too high . The price range should be more of $21-28 to reflect the actual quality of the item ."
4.0,"I bought these for my wife as she has foot problems. Over all they are great looking and well made slippers. The only problem she had was she wears a 6 1/2 shoe and we bought the size 7. Even going up a 1/2 size they were a little on the small side, but she really likes them. I wanted to return them and she said no, they look and feel great. So were bought a shoe stretcher and this has sort of solved the problem, but she is not able to put the inserts in."
4.0,"Im not sure on how well they'll hold up but super cute, fits perfect I wear a 9 and got a 9. I got lucky & got these 50% off. They are unique, not very comfy but I like them for the price"
4.0,Belly rings are well made and durable.  Definitely sensitive skin friendly.  Well worth the price!
4.0,Nice bathing suit. Fits perfectly. Follow the size chart.
4.0,I really like it but the magnet part of the band fell out after only wearing it a couple times.
4.0,"Was a bit too tight in the waist and needed me in a flat because of length, but I am tall with a 32 1/2&#34; inseam.  Decent product for costume wear of fun evening wear."
4.0,The sweatshirt is a lot thinner than expected and runs small.  My daughter said the 2xl fits like a men’s large.  But she still likes it and said the print was just like the pictures.
4.0,Comfortable but wrinkles easily
4.0,"Fits good. Punches out quite a bit, rubber sole is a little slick on wet surface. Holds up good over time!"
4.0,"Tighter fit, but very breathable."
4.0,"Comfortable and different, which I like. The shoes are red and bronze, with the bronze having a metallic glint. I would have preferred more of a brown, but I loved the styling, the fit and the comfort. So I kept them."
4.0,"I have Reynaud's and it's really hard for me to find decent gloves to counter the effects of losing circulation in my hands in winter. These gloves probably can't make the cut for colder weather - like under 20 - but it remains to be seen,. They are warm, cozy, and the pull cord at the wrists keeps them nice and toasty. I wish they had a clip to keep them together, but alas, they do not. Touch screen works well for the most part. Overall, I'm happier than I thought I would be with these."
4.0,Overall nice.
4.0,Cards are difficult to get out of.  I like it though.  It's very attractive.
4.0,Wish the material was different but the fit is perfect!
4.0,Purchased for my son... he seems happy.
4.0,My husband killed for Haloween<br />The issue is the eye placing is off.... if using this long term be aware; costume party amazing
4.0,"This is a pretty top. Unfortunately, the sizing is much different from other Vesso's tops. I can comfortably wear a large in most of the other tops I've gotten from them, but this one is quite small in comparison. However, for the price I will hang on to it and either give it to someone who is smaller that me or hope to wear it one day.<br />It's a bit shorter than most shirts, but is soft and stretchy. The lace is really nice and also soft. It does go across the whole back but with a dark bra you don't really notice the strap because the lace is not super airy. The quality of the lace and the shirt as a whole is very good."
4.0,Boots look as described. They are comfortable and a great price. Cannot comment on wear but appear to be very durable.
4.0,Go od buy
4.0,"We like it , just shorter than I expected . It would be a good idea to offer different lengths of the chain maybe? But it looks well and was a good gift ."
4.0,"Shorter than I thought, but still cute"
4.0,They seem a little cheaply made but will be cute for my adult daughter as a gift
4.0,"I ordered these for my daughter. They were pretty much what she was looking for. We thought they'd be more of a cotton feel to them, but they're a little thinner and buttery soft. We haven't washed them yet, so I'm not sure about shrinkage, pilling, or how the lace holds up."
4.0,"I'm about 5ft tall,140 lbs and these fit me perfectly however they were not capris, they went all the way to my ankles. I love the fit of them tight  but not uncomfortable. They are also great at keeping you cool even after a good workout."
4.0,hood is little small<br />and black nails such br different color i end up paint with glitter nail polish lol
4.0,"The clasp is kind of cheap, but overall work it"
4.0,"I loved the material, but the dress was simply too small, especially in the bust. I was able to tie it, but only barely. I'm normally a size 12, so I should have order the XL."
4.0,"My son likdmit, but felt the sleeves were a bit long for he general size.  He will buy more for sure, regardless.x"
4.0,"These pants fit true to size, on the snug form fitting side of things. The fabric is stretchy and moves well. The cut is great for comfort style and movement. They are more of a fitted boot cut than a cargo pant. The ""cargo pocket"" is a single zippered pocket on the upper thigh beneath the front pocket. A phone will fit it it, but due to the fit of the pants it looks strange. The fabric is lightweight and water proof suitable for spring. The charcoal color is a marled black that looks quite nice. They are stylish enough to transition from formal to casual wear. They'd fit in equally well at the office or on a hike."
4.0,Swimsuit arrived as described and fit as expected.  Halter style and ruffle design is flattering. Excited to wear this over the summer!
4.0,Love these leggings! They’re comfy and fit nice! They’re not sheer and they’re thick :) they also have not formed those little lint balls on the surface like so many cheap leggings do!!  The fabric is smooth and sleek! So nice!
4.0,"I bought a LARGE size after reading some reviews about Chinese small sizes. It was a mistake; I am MEDIUM in western sizes, and buying a LARGE was a mistake. The quality is good, just my fault."
4.0,Nothing overly special about these pants. My 18yr old wears them occasionally & hasn't complained. They look nice & wash up nice.
4.0,Great product but not delivered by the time indicated by product website.
4.0,"I like the cut and fit of this dress. I am fairly busty (30DD) so I have trouble getting clothes to fit my upper torso, but this dress had enough room without being gigantic in other areas. Unfortunately, when I sent it through the wash, it did shrink a bit (probably my fault, I didn't read the instructions) so now it doesn't fit as well. The waist is a bit high - even higher now that it shrank - so if you have a long torso, the belt may sit a bit above your true waist.<br />Overall though, I like it and will still wear it as a casual summer dress!"
4.0,"After looking at some other reviews I bought a size up from my normal size and it was probably the right call, but it’s just one of those items where I wish there was a size in between.  They are comfy and I’ve worn them all now but it’s slightly loose on my torso which I wasn’t expecting."
4.0,"The dress was as beautiful as expected! My first order was too small and they were amazing to work with on exchanging it for a size up. The one size up was a tad too big, but it was an easy fix! I’m perfectly happy with the dress and I got compliments about it all night."
4.0,"Received this item as promised. Box was not damaged. Note umbrella for me was a bit hard to get out of box.. tad bit heavy.. But was pleasantly surprised with the color.. I would not call it Burgundy... It is red to me... gorgeous color tho. Was easy to put up on my patio table. Cranks up and down nicely.. Make sure you read the directions that come with the umbrella.. I did not.. I just put it up.. and then the light would not work.. when husband got back in town from working.. he found the directions and stated you have to turn the solar thingy and something else.. So ladies just a side note do not just set it up.. I got the 9 ft and it is perfect for my round patio table and four chairs... we went back out when it got dark and tried the lights.. Very nice.. it has low, med, and bright... The button is on one of the arms of the umbrella...The umbrella seems very sturdy, not the cheap metal like other umbrellas I have bought...I would give it a five star, but some stitching looked a bit subpar to me... overall.. I love it.. made a very nice mothers day gift... Would buy again..."
4.0,Will fit as expected after a initial washing!
4.0,"I love it, I've been told it looks like Ants and not foot prints, so I added on my Branclet with crosses and angels works out find, delivery was fast."
4.0,Comes with tools. Very cute
4.0,"The style ended up being a bit large for my face , but that is a risk you take with getting sungalsses on line.  They arrived nicely packaged and included an sunglasses case with magnetic closure and cleaning cloth which was a nice bonus. My kids really enjoyed trying on the glasses and looking at the polarized testing card and seeing cars ""magically"" appear.  These are comfortable to wear and do not pinch the sides of my head like some do.  They lose a  stars because they are too big to fit in the sunglasses holder in my car and it appears the notepads aren't quite level so one always leaves a red mark even if I don't wear the glasses very long.  They are not the nicest made, but they are comfortable to wear and protect my eyes.  I don't tend to keep sunglasses that long so it is nice to have an extra pair around but I wouldn't be upset if I lost them"
4.0,Very nice but a little too heavy for my ears. But i do have problems: i had to get my holes stitched and the reopened so ... Go for it! They are real nice.
4.0,"I'm 5'3, 130 lbs and bought a medium. Definitely runs a little small. It was a struggle getting on but it fits. Also the &quot;dress&quot; is very short and doesn't cover my butt. It's more of a shirt or hoodie so I'll be wearing leggings with it. Other than that, I love it! I recommend buying just be careful of the size you order."
4.0,Loved these socks.  Kept my feet warm for 5 plus hours in below freezing temperatures
4.0,I wear XL in boxer briefs and a 2XL came and was a little tight (prior to washing). It was a little confusing how to work as the size tag wasn't at the rear it was on the side. You step in like normal underwear and legs then thru the band with rubber knobs on them. Then once the underwear is on you can pull the knob band up to the underwear band and tuck you shirt thru that outer band. It kept my shirt in place thru many bends and twists. And it was black which is a good color for boxer briefs especially if you're wearing black dress pants.
4.0,I absolutely loved these skirts however it would be nice if the hips were a bit roomier. Great price and cute skirts though. The perfect length and great if you wear skirts and dresses all the time like I do.
4.0,Worth the money! Fabric is not too think and nice design.
4.0,"These PJs are great: soft, warm/cool enough for whatever the weather, but they're thin... as in you can see fine details under the PJs. Only real complaint."
4.0,I bought a 2x based on the size chart and comments but it was a little too loose in the stomach area. The dress is very long but I liked the fact that it allows you to either wear flat sandals or a heeled sandal and doesn’t make the dress look too short.
4.0,"These are thick and warm but they are made for tall, skinny children.  My granddaughter is tall but heavier so it is a job to get these pulled up.  I ordered the plus size but still very long and not very accommodating."
4.0,Wow! It worked for me. Now go get paid🤑🤑🤑
4.0,"I like it and will wear it, it's just a bit too sheer so have to wear an undershirt with it."
4.0,Halloween 2017 costume was lots of fun and received many positive compliments
4.0,Cap was just as expected and served the purpose perfectly! Durable and affordable.
4.0,Good quality product for the price. I would definitely buy other bags from this brand
4.0,I normally wear a small but in sweatshirts I like them roomy.  I ordered a large and it fit like a medium. It's pretty though.  I hope it doesn't  shrink when it's washed.
4.0,They are a little too big but other than that they look legit
4.0,"So far, so good. It has held up to rain and wind. It seems to dry faster than the last umbrella we had."
4.0,"boobs were hanging out, probably better for women w/smaller boobs."
4.0,"Fits great and good workout pants. The waist don't fold down and stays in place which means a lot to me. However, a month later they got a small hole in the leg. I still wear them because I love them just hoped they would of held up longer."
4.0,"Vino con una de las baterías defectuosa, me toca comprar un repuesto. Deben mejorar el control de calidad"
4.0,Smaller than i expected but very nice
4.0,"I like it, but did not realize before I got it that you have to take the chain off to be able to open it.  This part I didn't like, but otherwise everything else is great."
4.0,"First glance they look a little small, but they actually fit great.<br />Quality is also pretty darn good.<br />Definitely will order again!"
4.0,Very cute and cool-looking.  Arrived quickly in perfect condition.  My only complaint is that they are a little too large to fit and do slide.  I think I am going to try to adjust the ear pieces to see if they will fit better.  Can't beat the price!
4.0,"These are nice comfortable shirts. I'd give 5 stars but the shoulders are a little tight, which unfortunately is normal for me.<br />They do show sweat, but damn do they dry fast."
4.0,Love the color and fit. Hang dry but the vinyl kept sticking to itself.  Would buy again.
4.0,"Very thin material, but my daughter seems to love it.  More like A long stretch long sleeve tee shirt."
4.0,A little bit big but feel good to walk in. They keep my feet warm.
4.0,"They are beautiful, very original designs but the quality is not entirely expected, however they are good."
4.0,Very thin. Does not keep you warm in really cold conditions or at high speeds
4.0,Much better quality than I expected. Top is padded and way too small for a D cup and I ordered a large. Good looking bathing suit though. Very cute.
4.0,Pretty cute and great for the money
4.0,Like the looks of this but dimensions and description are for some other product.  I need to know the size of the item to see if it fits my space.
4.0,This fits so well. I am a 38 DD and the large is just a little large around but it completely fits my boobs and the large bottoms are perfect. I love that the bottoms are cheeky and very flattering. Just like the picture and seems good quality.
4.0,"This watch was such a good fit for me and it's super durable. Color is pretty cool 👌😎 too! Once again ,l love the Chrono feature I like to jog , stopwatch is great."
4.0,Good material. Stretches and fits perfectly when I'm working out.
4.0,I’m 5’6 and I need to get about 4 inches shortened
4.0,"i take a size 36, i order size 38 ,was glad i did--- the material could be a little thicker & the price cheaper---had my doubts on fit when i saw this marked as 4x Chinese but it fit fine, --if your waist size is bigger than US 36 , your out of luck since this was biggest choice."
4.0,"I love this necklace set!  The colors are brighter than depicted, change as the light hits them, and appear to be plastic pieces that are semi-opaque.  The metal is very very cheap and would undoubtedly turn my neck green if I wore it too long, but appears somewhat sturdy, and I don't anticipate that the chain or links will break easily or that the plastic bits will pop out of their settings.  The earrings are light enough that I don't notice them.  And what great trickery!!  My husband wanted to know if they were labradorite!  ( I actually have a similar blue-green labradorite necklace and it is about 2x heavier) I wore this set out for our anniversary, with a low cut black dress and they were gorgeous!!  Will be wearing them often, for dress up nights out.  They also arrived a whole week before anticipated, which was much appreciated."
4.0,"I really liked these shorts for the price, and the material had a very nice feel . However, I had to return them as they were over 4"" smaller than any of my other size large athletic shorts. The picture shows them on top of a pair of Champion large. The leg openings were even quite small.<br />The Amazon free returns, which was my first, was easy and painless. Thanks Amazon."
4.0,Cotton leggings with compression fit super cozy love it
4.0,The set worked well for our needs. The bracelet however couldnt hold up to the kids and broke early in the day.
4.0,Nice keychain.
4.0,"These shoes are super cute and I love wearing them every chance I get with the outfits I have. Even a simple jeans and tank look good with these. They fit perfect, and very comfortable.<br />The only problem I have run accross with these particular ones (I have tons of Iron Fist Shoes)is that the studs on the top of the heel fall of too easy. I have only had these for a short period of time and several studs have fallen off and doesn't look too great. Cheaply made, but if you can fix it, fake it to make it."
4.0,"It's super cute and pretty good material, similar to material you'd find at a Ross store. It fits my long torso so that's great. My complaint is that one sleeve fits perfect but the other sleeve has weird stitching and is tighter. It's uncomfortable in that arm but no one can visibly tell, I just know."
4.0,"This shirt is hilarious. I get so many compliments and laughs from it. The fit is a little off based on the size chart and I wish I had sized to my regular shirt size. The bust chart would put me at wearing smaller than a small in this, however my best fit is a medium. The large is a little baggy, but works well. I am 5’7”, 140 lbs, and a 34 up top. A medium is my best fit. I would go with typical t-shirt or raglan sizing. The print has held up so far even with a regular washer and dryer cycle. True to color, too."
4.0,"I like the product.  I'm older and have trouble fastening my necklaces.  This one works pretty good and seems to have a pretty heavy duty magnet, but make sure you move your hair out of the way because it can get caught pretty easy.  I would suggest putting your necklace on with the adapter in front of you and then you won't have the problem that I have had."
4.0,"This is a quality cap but not as stretchy as I'd care to have. There is little room left under the top of the cap when it is worn over my ears. I'd buy it again, though."
4.0,"Arrived quickly and in great condition, but does not work as a charm &#34;stopper&#34; on a 2mm bracelet really more just a charm &#34;spacer&#34; on a bracelet that small."
4.0,"The key seems sturdy. I wish the placque with the flag was metal instead of plastic, but the key itself is metal. It has held up very good for the last 2 months of moderate use."
4.0,Nice bag but my daughter didn’t deserve it so I sent it back. If I wore coach I would have kept for myself. It didn’t come with a dust bag or box is the down side
4.0,"Beautiful dress, I wouldn't buy it if it wasn't. Trust me I have great taste in clothing."
4.0,"Gives you plenty of room to breathe under your mask, and not get lipstick on it.<br />But, know that the side hooks only work in the grooves of disposable masks. So, there is nothing to hold them in place. And, some clothes may slide down them"
4.0,"I like this outfit, I love the off the shoulder cut of this. I have larger breast and like most women with this issue I often struggle with wearing a top that if cut too big I look pregnant, if its cut to low you look slutty; especially for off the shoulder tops. However, this top hugs nicely with enough cleavage showing to keep it classy."
4.0,"I usually wear a 10.5 - 11 normally, based on their measurements, ordered an 11.  Too small & returned. Ordered a 12 and it was too small too. Contacted company and they sent me a 13 which works. They stand behind their product! Only gave 4 stars as i have only had them a day and dont know how they will hold up, but they look sturdy."
4.0,Love them but there a little to big
4.0,"Really liked the product.  Goes very nicely on my<br />Spouses’ wrist.<br />Issues I have is the fact that it does NOT go on my wrist unless you use the ‘elastic feature’ noted on the description. It causes the elastic to stretch and<br />makes it appear like the bracelet lost 2 beads...<br />Just make the bracelet ‘elastic’ string LONGER,<br />please...<br />That can be solved by adding an “EXTRA LARGE” size of ‘8.5 inches’ for those of us that either<br />‘work out with weights regularly’ and/or ‘those who readily enjoy eating’.<br />Thank you,<br />  chuk’s h"
4.0,My mistake for not reading the size. WAAAAAY too small for my normal adult sized wrist. Still cool.
4.0,The overall fit was as expected.  The length was a little long and had to be hemmed.
4.0,Sweater is nice material and isn’t scratchy. The cold shoulder straps are definitely shorter than expected. It doesn’t allow for the garment to drape over the shoulders and down the arms. Would probably need to stretch material or even add if you felt inclined. I’m petite enough I can stretch it to fit. The sweater is also quite “cropped” as well. Still cute though!
4.0,It’s not as loose in the waist as on the model but I’m not as thin as the model either. It does have some stretch and it’s a beautiful top that I’ll have no problem wearing this summer/fall/spring.
4.0,I like the boots but size 8 and 8.5 feels almost the same. I didn't tried size 9 yet. I'm concerned it will be small again.  Normally I wear size 8.<br />But boots feels very comfortable and I like that leather in the front is harder.
4.0,just a little darker than I thought they would be.  I would have prefered a lighter lense.
4.0,"Doesn't have pockets as the pictures suggest, but overall a cute dress."
4.0,"Way too small in the bodice...Loved everything. Else about it...design, fabric, patterned dots, wish it fit through the bodice I would love to wear it!!"
4.0,If you have a large top this will fit you like a sports bra lol<br />Still cute though but wished it was a bit longer
4.0,"We first got her size 12 so she could grow into them, but they were way big. We reordered size 11 that she routinely wears, and they’re still a little wide but usable. She wears them a lot on the playground and long walks."
4.0,These are a lobster bib that looka great in a photo.
4.0,Shipped quickly and seems like it's fairly well made. I just wish the text was a little lower on the front. It looks a little too high when it's on
4.0,"Like this very much. Quality is ok, worried about when I wash."
4.0,Don't  get me wrong is an excellent little purse I  thought it was a little bigger  for a crossover  purse but I still love it only my phone and credt card and gum fit in it without losing shape but like I said I m happy with my purchase
4.0,Fits as expected. The only thing the sleeves were little long but I like it that way. Looks nice on!
4.0,I would’ve given 5 stars but I ordered red mask and received burgundy. Other than that the mask are really good.
4.0,Comfy pants. However they did come with this hole luckily it was on the seam so I fixed it instead of returning them. Hopefully they'll hold up.
4.0,It’s a good product the clip lock stays locked.
4.0,"I purchased this for my grandson.  We, both, liked the look and the quality of the bag.  And, as always, it came in quickly and without damage."
4.0,Just started wearing them. Time will tell how they last.
4.0,"These leggings are nice, the material is good. Even when you wear them the don't become too see through. So these are really good solid colored tights. However, they are a bit tight on a medium sized person and will require some time to get them to stretch out to fit right. But the quality and price together are hard to beat. And they have a great variety of color options."
4.0,"These will be perfect for winter. They are a little thick and hot for warmer months. I love the pockets. I’m 5’3”, no surprise, they are too long."
4.0,They look great! I haven't given them to my bridesmaids yet so I don't know how they wear but so far i like them!
4.0,"Color was a little darker than expected but still very nice, stretchy and quality fabric, simple but can be dressed up. Im 5'4 169 lbs, and ordered the XL. Perfect fit."
4.0,The head band was perfect for my Cheshire Cat Halloween Costume for the Disney Cruise in 2012. Awesome. Thank you.
4.0,Lovely necklace.  Worth the money.  Wish that it had a longer chain as I like to be able to put my necklaces over my head without having to use the difficult clasp
4.0,"Better then I expected for not real jewelry. Definitely not to small, they're a little too loose so I guess it just depends on your fingers. I put a top coat nail polish on the inside"
4.0,Got it in the mint green a little shorter than expected but it could just’ve been my hips
4.0,"I love the fabric but they do run quite large.  I ordered the 16 and I should have ordered the 14, I can go to the bathroom without unfastening them.  However, they will be perfect for a long flight that I am leaving on, and will dry quickly in tropical climates."
4.0,this was a great gift at a great price.
4.0,"Very thin & lightweight but nice quality overall.  Runs VERY small, I typically wear a L but had to order this in 4XL"
4.0,"I have purchased this exact same item, same size, same color in the past and it fit perfectly; the one I received this time was way too big for me, not sure why."
4.0,They look good and seem to be of decent quality but are a bit loose on the bottoms. Not a big deal but joggers usually fit snug at the bottom. Price is very good.
4.0,"While the fit is relatively TTS, I recommend sizing up for length and a little extra room. I don't think this style is meant to be so fitted."
4.0,I ordered a large because I am very tall so I like my shirts to be a little longer on me. This shirt is fabulous if you're looking for something very comfy!!
4.0,"Well made, no lining. The sleeves were too short for my liking. Also, the material is that sticky sort of fleece that is super warm but works better on the inside of the jacket because if you bump into a tree or bush the leaves and twigs are gonna stick to it. Fine for the price, but not what I was looking for."
4.0,I bought the 16g 5/16 for my tragus piercing. The sizing is correct and looks good in my ear. However... I tried the blue one first and spent way to long trying the piece back in to close the hoop. Finally I decided to give the silver one a try and I got it within a minute. I tried getting blue one back together out of my ear and couldn't do it. Needless to say I wasted A LOT of time. Glad it came with two or else I would have been pretty pissed.<br />Not sure how well the pieces will stay in place with sleeping and showering.
4.0,Love the color.  Looks exactly like the color you see on Amazon. Looks good while being dressed up or down.
4.0,"Super clingy with sleeves that cut off at my wrist bone.  This shirt has a very classy look to it, which I am excited about.  Sleeves feel like they are going to hold up pretty well.  For the price, would definitely recommend, at least to someone trying to get into wearing clothes with lace accents. Arrived at least a week earlier than expected."
4.0,"Like this dress, good quality stitching and fabric, except that it is too hot to wear during the season when I usually wear short sleeves clothing."
4.0,"Great product. Could have used a bigger size in this product, but the shirt fit my nephew's current size. Good quality, comfortable."
4.0,"These are dyed pearls. Closely beaded with silk thread, which makes it look fuller. The neck lace does not fit me the way its shown in the picture, its a bit longer, or I have a small neck. I am happy with my purchase."
4.0,"Sleeves are an awkward fit. They’re baggi and tight at the same time. The shirt itself is huge, but that’s what I was going for. I’m happy."
4.0,Fit on my Oakley cross hairs just needed a little trimming.
4.0,Bought as a gift for my sister. She loves the. The only thing she didn’t like is the size. Wished they were smaller. They’re all about the size of a silver half-dollar.
4.0,"La camisa era un regalo para mi esposo, lo único que no me gustó del producto fue que la impresión del logo se miraba un poco desgastado, por los otros aspectos a él le gustó ."
4.0,High quality product delivered on time and perfect fit for my watch.
4.0,I followed the advice from other reviewers and ordered a full size larger than what I normally wear. I was really disappointed when I got them and they were still really snug even with thin socks. I was determined to see if I could make them work for me since I really didn't want to send them back so I adjusted the laces and checked to see if any of the insulation was removable. I was able to get the insole out and immediately saw why the boots were so uncomfortable. The insoles are very thick so if you have a normal to high arch your foot will feel like it's getting squished there. I have replaced them with my Superfeet insoles and the boot fits perfectly. I would give the boots 5 stars if I hadn't needed to swap the insoles to make them fit but for the price it was worth it.
4.0,Bought for great-granddaughter
4.0,"cute dress, I just didn't have right figure for it. nothing wrong with dress."
4.0,I was hesitant to buy this because of the mixed reviews and other versions of it which were said to be poorly made. I am so happy I bought this! I love this for going out - paired with skinny jeans and heels. The quality is good. I didn't expect it to be thick or heavy and it isn't - it's lightweight but solid fabric (no see through). The fringe pieces are cut and clean looking. The shape is super flattering. I love this piece. Only thing is the sleeves are a weird length. I have to bunch them up like the photo because otherwise they look awkward.
4.0,"I just got this item so I have not worn it yet but once I do, I will return and write a more detailed review."
4.0,Looks nice but bigger will better
4.0,"The chain is a little flimsy, but the pendant is beautiful"
4.0,more of a guys sunglasses...not unisex...
4.0,Fits a bit big but comfy and soft
4.0,Looks nice on my backpack.
4.0,I have big inner thighs. I bought these to cover them. I found when I walked it rode up into my crotch area. Just know if you have bigger thighs it will ride up. great material though. I returned them for longer ones. No fault of the product though!  I would have kept if I wasn't so fat! LOL
4.0,Ordered 2 sizes up based on customer reviews. Material is soft and lightweight Will keep and use as a night shirt.
4.0,nice shoes but I would go one size up
4.0,"Overall I truly love this bead. It is a representation of my father's spirit animal and he had passed 11 years ago. The only reason I gave it a 4 star was because the picture on the bead was not as crisp as the photo, and it is big enough to have his initials engraved on it."
4.0,"arrived on time. Nice fit and material. track suit jacket not for cold weather. Good buy, good supplier."
4.0,"They are all good quality, just different placement of the Logo.<br />I like the thicker pad of absorbent layer at the front of this one.<br />One of the others also has it. The adjustable strap is plenty long,<br />someone with a very large head could wear this with ease.<br />I had to tighten the velcro strap for a snugger fit; then cut off almost<br />three-quarters of an inch so that the excess wouldn't be sticking out.<br />Behind the Halo visors, these are probably my second best favorites."
4.0,"Love these belts. Great quality and look. I purchased 4 of these (2 brown and 2 black with different buckles) and only have issues with 1 of the belts. It loosens on its own when I move. It is the belt, not the buckle, because I have switched it with another belt and it worked."
4.0,I like my new ring.
4.0,I bought this for myself. It was too big so I gave it to my mom. So a large got a a size 12 to 14.
4.0,This was too small for my ear.  I had to order a larger size.
4.0,"Somewhat disappointed, I wanted to use these with my tall boots, I could use them with a short pair of boots.  They're a little to small & short. The leg warmers quality is good, and well made.  Not good for tall or long boots.  The leg warmers are very cute.  If you calves are of normal size, these warmer will fit fine, but if you have thick calves I would not recommend  them for you. They're perfect for short  boots.  I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"It's a little long on me - I'm only 5' but it works with tights or leggings. Sort of a lot of material. A tad baggy but OK for the days you want to be comfy. Washes well, no wrinkles. I'm 105 lbs and bought a small."
4.0,"Zipper is a little &#34;wonky&#34; at times, but the boots are sexy as hell and we love them! Wore them to &#34;Kinky Boots&#34; The Musical and people there loved them!"
4.0,"Feels great.  Looks great.  When I travel, it keeps demagnetizing my hotel key cards.  Can't put them in it or even get them close or they stop working."
4.0,"The quality is good for the price. Very nice but sad that they don't fit.<br />I'm usually a Large & bought XL, but still doesn't fit. That's why giving it 1 star less."
4.0,"Nice style, good quality."
4.0,"I really like this wallet, it appears to be decent quality and won't fall apart, granted it isn't real leather, it's good enough for me for under $10 I bought the Navy/pink one due to the middle stripe matching with the tones. Super fast shipping considering china post, under the estimated time."
4.0,Bought these for my husband. They are true to size.
4.0,Nice cardigan but the color was a little brighter than picture provides.
4.0,"These are comfortable, have a good stretch, and do not snag easily. There are less transparent than I was anticipating, which is great. They do look a bit awkward around then ankles when used as footless tights, but I guess that probably comes with the style.<br />Overall, these are good for dance classes/days where you sometimes need footed tights, and sometimes need to go barefoot--or even to use in between classes."
4.0,"Definitely not as fitted as I would have liked, but is warm, comfortable, and relatively stylish. Kept me from both freezing to death or roasting in the wonky spring Colorado weather.<br /><br />Make sure you read the size chart and read the comments to get an appropriate size - based on those things, this fit EXACTLY as expected."
4.0,Me agrada pero talla pequeña
4.0,The color is great and length too. I just thought that because I ordered a small that it would be tighter!
4.0,They look nice but dont know they are a Christmas gift
4.0,I liked the item. It’s very colorful
4.0,Some pieces have no enough detail but they work fine.
4.0,i liked the product. i used it for my son's birthday
4.0,Pretty cheap but still very pretty
4.0,"It's okay, but in the picture it looks a little wider."
4.0,"**Edit, UPDATE.  I just received another wallet in the mail with a working zipper***<br /><br />It’s an ok wallet, but within a couple weeks the zipper on the change purse, broke."
4.0,"Needs to be a half size larger, but pretty comfortable after some breaking in time."
4.0,exactly what i expected. not much to it. mesh trucker hat. picture says it all. snap back fitting. great costume piece.
4.0,"I purchased the pink and teal pairs to go with my granddaughters Halloween costumes.  They were kind of big for them, more for older girls than little kids, but still very cute and well made.  They are now in the dress up box and they love them!"
4.0,"Great lacking hat. Fits pretty well, but I'd say runs a little on the small side. Having no hair is definitely helping me be able to fit this!"
4.0,They're really cute. The only issue is if you have thick skin you have to winden the hoops with the shapes.
4.0,"like the hat, keeps the sun off my face in the morning sun.  The black band detached from the hat after the first wearing but I glued it back on & it has been fine ever since."
4.0,"Arrived on time, fits well."
4.0,they work great.
4.0,"I bought the white with bright pink flowers in us 12 size. My hips are wide at 41 inches and waist is 31 , bust 34/36d. I was disappointed that white was not lined. However, the material is this silky, stretching material and even when held up to the light, it was barely see thru. So , it's good enough to wear to work or a party with no worries that someone can see thru to your goods. Good shapewear will help. Again, this will stretch alittle, but not like 4 inches. The right side hip though was stitched incorrectly, causing an odd puckering . It's noticeable to me but probably not to others. I most likely will go to a Taylor to see if they can relax that stitch. Hence the 4 stars. Pink is bright and vibrant.  Overall , I'm happy with my purchase."
4.0,Nice but wish it could go smaller cause I have tiny wrists
4.0,"I love these boots, the are cute and waterproof. Downside is that they don't have arch support and are on the narrow side. If you don't have wide feet and don't need arch support, you will love these boots. They handle wet snow very well and are nice and warm."
4.0,"Bought slippers for hubby for Christmas, he has severe foot problems (diabetes).<br />Loves the way they feel, very comfortable. They do run on the small side."
4.0,These were purchased for a gift and the motor cycle rider loved them.
4.0,Fits pretty good. Keeps my head warm as well as hides my receding hairline.
4.0,It's cute! No issues. Note that it's just the onesie...no pants or hat.
4.0,I normally wear an XL so I orders a L thinking it would be okay but it was too big. I really like these so I reorder a M.
4.0,I Really Like This Dress The ONLY Thing I Wish It Would’ve Had The Extra Lining Through Out The Entire Dress Not Just The Chest Area Other Then That For The Price You Can’t Beat It!!! I’d Def Recommend!! Also I Got Mine A Bit Smaller (Size M)Cause I Like My Dresses Tightttt But It Stretches Really Good & Sucks Everything In 🤪
4.0,This necklace is very nice for wearing with sweater.
4.0,Really didn’t fit well after it was washed.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:5b23e973602be76ac373c45014cf02f4]] I would say that 75% of things I order online in a size small tend to be just a teeny tiny bit big on me, but this fits exactly right. With that said, if you’re on the fence between 2 sizes, I would probably go with the larger size.<br /><br />The color looks just like the advertised photo, and I really like the puffed sleeves! The arms have a tighter part below the poofy part though, which may not work well unless your arms are pretty slender.<br /><br />The tummy area of the shirt is loose, which I like, and the fabric is comfortable. It didn’t smell bad when I removed it from the package, and although it says to hand wash, I washed it on delicates and tumble dried it on medium heat. It looks great and had no wrinkles when I took it out of the dryer!<br /><br />I’m 5’5” and weight 125 lbs. I normally wear a size 4-6 and ordered a size small.<br /><br />This is a nice, unique shirt to add to my wardrobe!"
4.0,ordered two different shirts one fit like a tent the other was too tight both were 3x.sent them back
4.0,"Great product, but measurements are small. I now have gloves for my wife..."
4.0,I don't like that you have no more options I like this ones no the one with no openings I'm old school.
4.0,"I bought these for a flight from the US to India.  We were in flight for about 15 hours total, with a 5-6 hour layover in between the two legs of the trip and my ankles did not swell at all.  I was impressed.  I would have given 5 stars but I was bothered with them &#34;binding&#34; a bit at the inside of the knee."
4.0,Want thinker padding
4.0,"I’m glad I read the reviews before I ordered these shorts. Normally I wear a size small, but these I ordered in a size medium and they’re snug. They are comfy and have a lot of padding in the back for riding! I’m sure I could wear these on a long ride and be perfectly comfortable.<br /><br />They’re pretty cute too for bike shorts. Make sure you go a size up than you normally might order."
4.0,"Very pretty. More sheer than I expected, but will be lovely as a top layer."
4.0,Excellent bag. Looks much more expensive than it is. Did read size but would have liked it just a little bigger. At this price I can throw it away after season or buy another if this one gets dirty. lol
4.0,It gives a good for a teenager or a lady is well attractive and functional. I think it's an article in which you have to think when choosing a cheap and alegante clock. bad. creates visual impact but the termination is not so good.
4.0,"Really like how bright & fun the colors are on this band. It’s silver buckle is easy to fasten, hasn’t scratched up. Comfortable band. Dislikes: the colors are not on both side of the band so you see some white & the buckle slides are fading and rubbing off."
4.0,"I love this top!  Flattering fit and style.  Color is a little off.  Not true navy blue, has a bit of a gray tint to it."
4.0,"It's a little shiner than I wanted, but fits well and looks like it will hold up"
4.0,"Very adorable designs however, the glue that holds the clasp on didn’t hold on very well for some of them"
4.0,Cute... a little thin but I like it
4.0,"It’s a little snug with the extra material on the inside, but that’s to be expected and is otherwise a very warm hoodie. The lining is true polyester, so not the softest material, but again, very warm. Recommend just a long sleeve T-shirt underneath."
4.0,"Nice outfit that will allow me to standout at my event. I ordered a large because I wear a size 12, but should've gone up a size. It's a tight fit, but I should be able to pull it off. I don't have a pic because I couldn't zip it up on my own. I needed help, but was home alone. Overall, I love the original look of the outfit, but wish I ordered a size bigger. Packaging and shipping was great!!!"
4.0,the pants was a little thin but i loved it
4.0,"It fit okay.... not as in the picture, but I will keep"
4.0,"Great wedding bands for the price, my only suggestion is to up size one size up and take it off every night before bed because your skin might be sensitive and silicone holds in dirt and germs.."
4.0,Has several pockets & different ways to carry it. I filled with a few typical items we’ll need & still have room. It’s not big & bulky like they use to be.
4.0,Runs small but super cute top
4.0,These are awesome. I have been having issues with bras and needed new bras to ware in place of underwire ones. And these are awesome.
4.0,"This works great but the ""teeth"" seem to be pretty sharp.  I will need to be careful using with my fine gold items.  Other than that - light weight and easy to use.  Need this to assist with difficult to fasten bracelets and it does just that.  Great help to us single-types!"
4.0,"I love it, the only problem I'm having is the hook keeps unlatching from the zipper part of the wallet, other than that I love it"
4.0,They are warm comfortable and stylish.  Just the thing to wander around in after dark
4.0,Balls fall off
4.0,They are nice for plain hoops.
4.0,Very nice watch. It’s lightweight and doesn’t look bad.
4.0,"Pretty awesome bag.  Cheap, too.  The only thing is that the included straps were way to flimsy and way to short.  I found away around it though, and is the reason I'm giving it four stars. I bought these straps:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07466J6SN/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1 After cutting off the bad ones that came with it, the straps I had to buy extra made it work.  See attached pics"
4.0,Got for a Christmas gift for daughters and they were so happy!
4.0,"Cute, functional every day lounging leggings."
4.0,My hubby likes them but they run small
4.0,Dress was pretty. Fitswell but does not easily hang off shoulder like the model. Overall it turned out nice for what I needed.
4.0,"Fits true to size and very comfortable. Does not feel like your traditional bathing suit, it’s very soft and feels like it would retain a lot of water. But it wasn’t too bad"
4.0,"These were super cute, but in the end I didn't think I'd ever wear them. Its a difficult combination of casual and super sparkly. If that fits your lifestyle, go for it!"
4.0,The zipper is on the opposite side men are used to in the USA.<br />It is also a bit fine motor taking eye work and care to start.<br /><br />The pockets are small. The extra gear pockets on the sholder and sleeve are too small for even a small smartphone.<br /><br />The rear old school hunting/catch pocket's opening is very very small.<br />I hoped to fit a sit pad in there. Nope
4.0,"Lightweight and as described - but be aware of size when purchasing. They look like wide frames on the face. These could be unisex, but they appear to be on the large side (oversized) if you have petite facial features."
4.0,"I bought this bag for traveling; I needed a backpack style bag that was big enough to carry items like my iPad, water bottle, small umbrella, etc. I am now using it for the first time on an overseas trip and like almost everything about it with a few small exceptions. Overall, it’s well organized, has a lot of different pockets, and pretty much does what it says it does. To make it perfect, I’d suggest: 1) a double zipper on the main compartment, which would make it much easier to open & close; 2) a better closure system for the front snap pocket - the pocket is so wide that the ends stick up and make it unsnap easily when there’s almost anything in the pocket; 3) slightly shorter straps: they are long enough that to get the buckles off one’s shoulders one has to loosen them a lot, which makes the backpack a little heavier to carry than it needs to be; 4) a couple of dedicated pen slots somewhere."
4.0,"I love the fit and the fabric. The design is on point. I love when someone looks at the shirt, gets it, and laughs because... what a moment right?! The ONLY thing is, I wish I hadn't got it in the wine/red color. The way the print turned out leaves Moyra and David's skin looking very pink.  If I could buy it over, I'd get the green. Such a great idea though."
4.0,Very comfortable and nice looking but I find the material it makes it fit smaller
4.0,the font seemed a bit marbled
4.0,"Comfortable around the house. Too long for me, even folded over at the top. I’m 5.7 with a short waist."
4.0,"These earrings are well made, considering the affordable price.  If I concentrate on a concern it would be the fullness of the lapis on only one earring. I’m going to rub some vitamin e oil on it & i’m sure it will be fine..."
4.0,"I adore these, they are super cute and all but they definitely shrink a lot after just one wash so they are a bit of a stretch to use them again but all in all still super cute. Still even reach to above my knees!"
4.0,These pants were great in functionality and seem durable.  Many pockets that are secure and within easy reach.  They kept me warm and dry. They run a little large but this gives me room to layer up underneath them if necessary and they came with a belt that worked great.
4.0,"These gloves are nice, but....the fit, for me, is a bit strange - I wish my nails were longer so the gloves would fit better. It is mostly my ring fingers that are much too long (see photo). I'm questioning whether a smaller size would have been better. although, they may have been too tight.<br /><br />What I like about these gloves:<br /><br />1. Light weight fabric.<br />2. The fur trim is a nice touch (they are not fur lined).<br />3. The zipper.<br />4. They do work pretty well with phone screen (and would work better if the fingertips weren't too long).<br /><br />What I don't care for:<br /><br />1. They're sort of stiff but I'm hoping with wear, they'll soften up.<br />2. The fit. I think next time, I'll purchase women's gloves instead of ""unisex"".<br /><br />It's been unusually warm here in New England (30's - 40's) so I haven't been able to test them in colder temps or while shoveling. I'll have to update my review at a later time."
4.0,Bought this as a joke for my husband and daddy to be.
4.0,"There ok, don't fit like I prefer, but will work"
4.0,"I would not use this product as a dress, however it is lovely with leggings! I also wear it to bed as a nightshirt."
4.0,Scratch very easily and clarity is poor.
4.0,This tunic fits exactly as I expected.  The fabric is a bit heavier then the norm which is great as there are no worries about my bra showing through.  The fabric is also soft and this tunic is very comfortable to wear.  Looks great with a pair of leggings and boots.
4.0,"I so badly wish this came in a bigger size! I absolutely love the design and it is well made and very warm, but it's just too tight. Usually I wear XXL, and despite getting that size, it is the same size as the XL shirts I compared it to from my closet. Oh well."
4.0,"Well made simple and cute top. Fits as expected. I purchased one size bigger for a very loose fit but it is true to size. Material is good, not see through and the color is exactly as pictured."
4.0,"The fabric is a little thin and low quality, but it's only a PJ meant to be worn when cuddled into a warm blanket. My son is supper hally with it and that's the only thing that matters.."
4.0,Decent material but the green dress/top part was huge
4.0,I like this ring. The band is not as wide as I expected. But I am still satisfied.
4.0,Comfortable shirt with nice material.
4.0,"for the price, these boots are great, a thicker rubber, better than alot of the ""fashion boots"".<br />The heel is solid so makes for foot comfort."
4.0,My husband bought this jacket to use while golfing it’s lightweight but warm the only issue he had with it is that the sleeves were too long so he cuffed them under.
4.0,The ordered said seven rings i inly got six the pink ring wasn't there i was disappointed because i love pink
4.0,After washing in washer after several washings the strings got thinner and finally broke. Will have to buy sturdier strings and restring it. Overall very comfortable.
4.0,Not bad. Comfortable and nice. Accidentally forgot to take it off in shower once and it held up.
4.0,"Read reviews that they don't stand up to washings. After three washes, they still fit and feel very good. So, I am satisfied."
4.0,It s very comfortable and nice style
4.0,Delivery was a day late.<br />How ever the tool itself works great. Before I was using paper clips on one watch band and it took me about an hour to remove two links. Needed to use three paper clips. Pushing the pin with the paper clip also makes a sore spot on the finger due to the difficulty of trying to push the pin out. Now that I have this little tool I can remove a link and put the band back together in much less time. Maybe about 5 minutes. One improvement I can see is to have different size pins available. The other improvement it could use is to have a straight pin. Mines is slightly crooked. I can see the pin wiggling when turning the screw. Minus a star for that.<br />It's a very fair price for this little tool.
4.0,I like this belt for the decent quality and the better fit compared to the traditional belt holes.  The width on this is good and fits through all of my dress pants.
4.0,Great shirt. Very soft and looks good. The material is a little see through so wear a tank top :)
4.0,"I love the shirt, and typically wear a medium, however the medium was like an extra large on me. I'm by no means a small frame and it's still very large."
4.0,This is a good quality tank but definitely runs big. I am 5'4 and I could have used a petite because it's very long.
4.0,These look exactly as pictured. They are on the slightly snugger side but not enough to need to go up a size. They wash and dry nicely.
4.0,cute but i don't wear it often because it tugs on clothes such as sweaters
4.0,"It's a very good product,<br /><br />just make sure you apply a drop of oil on each side of the lens' hinges."
4.0,Cute but definitely not as long as I expected
4.0,"A bit too large for the size I ordered. For the price, I am not sending them back, but I'd try to order 1/2 size smaller than you need."
4.0,"These pants are very comfortable and warm, but a little baggy for my taste.<br />If they could be slimmed down in the hips and avoid the pockets right at the hip line, they would give a trimmer look."
4.0,"The scrunched part on the side makes it look a little strange. But it's comfortable, and can most likely make it work."
4.0,"Great knockoff of the Zara embroidered bomber that's around $200 and sold out. I got a size medium and as the other reviews say, the sleeves are a little short. Overall the fit is perfect, other than the sleeves.  However, you do get what you pay for and some of the embroidery is a bit off."
4.0,bought it a little to big but my granddaughter loves them
4.0,"Un poco pequeñas las piedras, pero está bien."
4.0,"Pros: Light Weight, Clear Display, Zero Eye Strain, Very Comfortable, E-Paper Displays Day-Month-Date-Time together which is hard to find, Convenient for working in tight places because of flat curved display & less likely to get caught or hung on something as a result of its ergonomic design, Great for operating equipment while wearing, Utilizes Standard Battery available online or in stores.<br /><br />Cons: I've owned 2 of these E-Paper watches & its not as durable as I'd wish because its glass is vulnerable to cracking if you accidentally bump it against sharp metallic objects and the leather strap can unglue overtime do to sweat or other liquid exposure.  Advise to treat it as a luxury or dress watch & limit exposure to moist/wet environments. No smaller version for women currently available."
4.0,"daughter in law hasn't seen it yet, but I thought it wasn't as bright as showed on web, still  feel as excellent deal"
4.0,My son has been wearing this style for 4 years now. He wears them to the beach and boating with tubing. Look good too.
4.0,"Careful Material was just ok, was smaller than I expected. I have a long torso and it just isn’t long enough for me"
4.0,These laces look great in my Converse. As far as durability I can’t say because I just got them. I plan to order more colors. Makes a more streamlined look to shoes
4.0,Very nice. Larger than I thought. Wish it had an actual chain.
4.0,"This is a pretty good reproduction of the dice from the recent Star Wars films. I was happy to find a cheap reproduction. I haven't had them for too long, and I am not sure that they will be very durable, but I am using them as a decoration on a backpack and they should be fine for that purpose.<br /><br />The dice are small (about 1/2 inch on a side). The detail and color is good. My impression of the chain is that it won't bear much weight or use as a keychain or anything like that. It will work well for decoration or cosplay."
4.0,"For never having felt vegan leather, I'm quite surprised at how soft it is and how nice this looks. Very cute!"
4.0,"They arrived to late for Fall cleanup, but look forward to using them in the Spring."
4.0,I don't care for the thread at the end of the sleeves unraveling
4.0,"I have wide calf, they fit good with some room left to tuck in pants!"
4.0,"I was not compensated in any way for this review.  I paid full price for these socks and bought them for myself.  I'm a cancer survivor and my surgeries have left me with permanent lymphedema on the left side of my body, from the waist down.  I have expensive, medical grade compression tights I'm supposed to wear everyday.  Unfortunately, insurance will only pay for one set every six months and at $300/pair I'm not spending the money to purchase an extra set out of my own pocket..  When you have to wear them everyday, one set just isn't enough.  On many days, I hate having to fight to get them on and off.  Plus, they're extremely hot!<br /><br />I was searching for a pair of compression socks I might be able to wear on days I'm just working around the house.  I needed something that would keep the swelling to a minimum, but be affordable and worth the investment.  I came across these socks and thought I would nice them a try.  I like the variety of colors they offer.  The only issue was decided on a size to buy.  I have very small feet, but a large calf due to the fluid retention.  So, I have to find something that will not cut off the circulation and large enough to fit comfortably on my calf.<br /><br />I ordered a larger and kept my fingers crossed they would fit.  First, I love the material and the color.  The pink is just as bright as it is in the photos.  They're fun and sporting looking, instead of looking drab and exactly like a medical garment.  They do a good job of keeping the swelling down, as long as I'm not on my feet for too long.<br /><br />The only problem I ran into was the is fit.  I wear a shoe size 6.5 - 7 on my left foot and a 6 on my right foot.  (Because of the cancer surgeries)  Luckily the sock fits nicely over my calf.  They aren't too snug, yet they're not sliding down as I wear them either.  The fit issue comes in the length of the overall sock and the size of the foot pad.  The socks are so tall that I have to fold them over at the knee, which makes them tight on the back of my knee.  The extra fabric can bunch up behind my knee if I have to do a lot of bending during my day.  The foot pad of the sock is too long for both feet.  The extra room for your heal actually sits on the back of my ankle.  I have to fold it over and tuck in the heel, especially in my sneakers.  I just wish someone would make socks for people who have smaller feet, but larger calves.  Just because my calf is larger, doesn't mean I have large feet or long legs.<br /><br />Outside of the fit issues, this is a good alternative to the expensive, medical grade compression socks."
4.0,The color is more of a cognac than tan and looks pretty high quality. The handles are a little too stiff. But otherwise a great buy for the price
4.0,"Sizes run smaller than stated.  I will still wear this, but  good to size 1-2 up."
4.0,Dress fits well and I wore it to my class reunion party.
4.0,I bought 2 for gifts and 1  for myself.  It is handy and I feel confident that my cards are secure from thieves.  The wallet fits nicely into most purses and holds many cards.
4.0,"love this dress.  As a mom of two i was worried that the fit may enhance the mom pooch.  Although it is a fitted dress, it has stretch to the fabric which allows for some give in certain areas.  It was a bit long for me, since I am only 5'1, but will keep and have hemmed a little.  Great dress for work or church or even a night out."
4.0,These are great to have for under dresses and with shirts but they run so small. I had to buy the 3T for my daughter who just turned 2 and is average size.
4.0,"Great set of bow ties, I like the colors.  They are well made and keeps their form after washing. Would prefer a different way of attaching, the current hook attachment gets loose."
4.0,It looked great on her. The only issue I can state is the tag is on the inside front of the outfit but it is a good outfit. She was able to sleep in it comfortably.
4.0,"First long jumpsuit. It really is flattering. Soft and flowy. Ties in the back a little humbug, a button might work better? Pant legs about 4 inches too long for me but I can hem."
4.0,Very pretty ring and it fits perfectly! I’m giving it 4 stars because I haven’t worn it long enough to critique it otherwise.
4.0,Bought as a gift for a family member. She loved it. Good quality. Exactly as ordered.
4.0,"I usually wear a xs/s, but I had to order a medium which fits like a xs/s."
4.0,"Beautiful dress, a little thicker fabric. I'm 5'2 so it was slightly longer than expected but great for fall and winter!"
4.0,I like it but ordered a long robe and received a short one.
4.0,The gold was like 24kt gold color.  Too much for what we were going for.
4.0,Christmas present. The watch is great. My 7 year old loves dinosaurs however the hour and minute hand words are very difficult to read.
4.0,I bought this for my wife because the original strap kept getting caught on things and unfastening. This has worked fine since we put this on the watch.
4.0,Takes a &#34;little&#34; time adjusting to fit of shirt. Suggest couple hours a day until you adjust to wearing shirt.
4.0,Fits securely. Flips up if needed in darker settings.
4.0,"They are really cute and the picture is reflective of them when they arrive. I had to get different backs because the ones that come with the pins, fall off."
4.0,Great little dress for work or cocktail hour. It is a little big but still works because of the material. Material wrinkles easily.
4.0,A lot cuter on than I expected. Wish it was a little tighter so i could wear it on the motorcycle.
4.0,"So very very sparkly and pretty.  The elastic isn't great and mine was worn in a few places and breaking when I received it, but not bad for the price."
4.0,"SO FUN! i love this, super soft"
4.0,This dress is awesome for the price. Needed a red dress for church. Couldn't find one I liked in the store. This choice was perfect for fit and cost. Be careful with your dress however the sleeves snag very easy.
4.0,A little expensive for the quality but overall satisfied
4.0,Love these earrings. I get a lot of compliments in the office.
4.0,I bought these knowing they'd be oversized. I guess I didn't realize how oversized they'd be.. I don't have a super small face either and these covered my face haha they are super cute though! I'm sad they didn't work.
4.0,Me agradó el precio y el servicio de envío
4.0,I tried to check with them ahead of time but miscommunication? too small but very well made. Gave it to my niece. Seller was very nice.
4.0,Some of the headbands to secure the masks broke easily.
4.0,The purchase was worth it
4.0,I am a general contractor and use gloves everyday. These gloves last just as long as the $4 gloves but they are only $1. On average they last about 1 week give or take. Not the best glove in the world but worth the price.
4.0,These were good. They were a bit large for me and get caught in my hair sometimes. I also had to flip the way that the hooks faced otherwise I looked like captain hook stabbed my ear. Cute.
4.0,Very nice sweater.  Good quality.  Nice and cozy warm.
4.0,"Love this checkbook cover! So cute with such vibrant colors! Liked the price and delivery was timely. Just a very simple cloth cover (not excessively substantial) but very very very cute.<br />If you like Vera Bradley or fun prints, you will want this cover! ;)"
4.0,"I love the dress but the sizing chart is way off. I wear a 16-18 US dress size and this wasn't anywhere close to fitting. I ordered the XL. I normally can wear XL dresses, but not this one. The dress is gorgeous. I'm definitely keeping it as a goal dress."
4.0,it's too big
4.0,"I am a 34C, wear mediums in all my shirts, long arms, and this fits slightly oversized but super comfy and soft. the seams are pretty bulky and it shed a little but i can get past those things. im weird with texture lol"
4.0,Good product. Love the pockets. I would go up one or two sizes.
4.0,"Super cheap flimsy sunglasses, but excellent buy for in bulk for giveaways"
4.0,It is kind of big
4.0,"I am normally an XL/size 14 so I ordered 2x based on the reviews. This jacket is very comfortable. The sleeves and shoulders fit nicely but the side seams were too far toward the back, so it appeared to be too small. I suggest ordering at least 2 sizes up."
4.0,"Me gusta mucho la suavidad que tiene, son muy cómodos y me gusta la bolsa que se encuentra en las piernas."
4.0,"I used this for a glamrock chica cosplay in size 10-12 and I’m 11 and about average weight and height, it had a small fit, it worked ok. It is kinda thin but not bad. I have to say it’s pretty good for the price!"
4.0,This dress is made of very good and thick/heavy material. It fits large so order a size smaller. I normally wear a L/XL dress size 12 and I ordered a medium. It’s still very roomy. It’s a good length. I plan to order more colors in this style! It can be dressed up or down. I purchased mine to wear to work.
4.0,Very pretty !!!!
4.0,Got this as a gift for my sister and she likes it. She says it fits great and warms right away. Lightweight and comfortable.
4.0,Amazing product bigger then i thought but worked for the outfit perfectly.
4.0,"The material was thin, cute style but wasn’t a huge fan of it."
4.0,"These are nice and comfortable.  The first two days they seemed to be a little small (sz 10), but now they fit fine."
4.0,"It is the fashion of last winter, blanket scarfs. This had the same shape (square) but is way thinner. I noticed that I love this sarong/scarf for the different ways I can use it around my body and neck. It is lightweight and fits in my purse perfect.  In Florida we are dressed for outside but in most stores and restaurants it is freezing, so the extra wrap around my shoulder of scarf with coat! Happy with it. The only fuzzies that I get are little parts of the knotted edges that are letting go - especially around my mouth.. lol Not a big deal to me.."
4.0,"This pendant is really pretty, but the chain leaves something to be desired. It is just a bit too chunky for the pendant. The pendant though is great and it looks like good quality, not cheap at all."
4.0,"The vivid colors are beautiful! The material is super soft. My only complaint is they look tight. I wear a small but ordered a large based on other's reviews.  The fit like second skin from the waist to mid thigh, not exactly the look in going for but I'll add a long blouse or jacket and rock these artsy pants!"
4.0,"The band is nice but the clasp is just OK, It fit my Seiko divers watch perfectly and that was when the clasp showed its weaknesses. On a smallish wrist with 2 links removed the folding bars seemed to be to flat and levered the band links out away from the wrist in an ungainly way, The clasp was somewhat difficult open/close. The fold over 2nd catch was not very secure and if you released the primary latch the secondary wouldn't hold closed. I decided I wasn't going to send it back but see if I could fix it. I closed the clasp bent a little more curve into the ""folding bars"" Just a little and tested to find the latch functioned better easy open and close and no stick out! The secondary just needed a little squeeze and all is great now. I'd give it 5 stars if it came the way it is now."
4.0,"Pretty nice, just tight around the neck for me."
4.0,Vintage Silver Infinite Bracelet Love Pink Leather Rope Infinity Knit Punk...like the clasp.  color is true.  fun piece to wear
4.0,"It can get unconformable because it only has one small circle. I think both sides should have had it, other than that it's really cool"
4.0,"Have had for about 2 months now, I wear it a few times a week and am happy with the condition it has maintained. Good watch for the price."
4.0,the extra bit of plastic glasses that extends below the regular pair of glasses makes it easier to catch to flip up the sun glasses.
4.0,"Kept my arms a lttle warmer, when we played in January."
4.0,Nice top but the material is not as soft as I thought.
4.0,The dress was flattering but just not enough coverage at the top for larger breasts.  I had to return.  I’m a 38 DD for reference.
4.0,Ordered this for my daughter. She loves it! Fits as expected. Only issue I have is in the picture the heart is red. In the shirt she received it is white.  I would prefer red.  Not sure if I want to go through the hassle of trying to return it for another. It's for her school play in a few weeks.
4.0,Like this case.  It is very durable although somewhat bulky.  It really does a nice job of protecting my phone.
4.0,When ordering it it didn't give me the option for any size at all and when I received it it was too small
4.0,Super lightweight but kind of short in the back and a very straight fit
4.0,"I would have given this five stars if you could adjust the lacing. Still it is quite nice and really like the fit overall, but they should give some thought to letting you tie off one end so you can adjust the way the dress will better conform to one's body"
4.0,"Beautiful design, great fabric, looks just like the pic. However armholes are really small...I'm a US small in top & the xxl fit my arms, but the top is big, going to take in the sides for it to fit me the way I like. With the right fit, its truly something to adore."
4.0,"It's quite light in color, I would prefer something darker. But I wanted a green cape, I got a green cape. Success."
4.0,I like them very much although they are slightly too thin around the derrière. Otherwise they are a great purchase!
4.0,"Para un regalo tenia un lado muy estirado, y una mas ancha de arriba que la otra, pero le quedó"
4.0,"If you plan on wearing them for more than like 2 hours, I’d pick a different pair. The clip makes them really painful.<br />But they’re really cute, and sturdy."
4.0,"Not a terrible purchase. The quality is typical of products Made in China. The capes have an acceptable appearance. The masks are made of medium weight felt with an elastic strap sewn on each side. These do not appear to be durable. The true test will be our grandson's reaction, when he opens this gift Christmas morning. They are really cute!"
4.0,"Does its job for the cheap price ($5 ish). A little tighter fit than I expected, but I bought it to avoid stepping on ice-cold tiles in the winter."
4.0,"The dress is nicely made, pretty thick material . I usually would buy large size clothing but because of the cut of the dress i can get away with medium. I don’t have a big chest and like a sleeve that isn’t too loose I also carry all my weight in middle. I’m 5’5” about 150lbs. I got a medium and it looks more like an extra a large in teens."
4.0,This was a present from my sweet husband.  It has tall great detail and seems well made.
4.0,"I absolutely adore the style of these chaps. The one complaint i have is with the sizing/ fit. First, these run small so be aware. Second, while it is leather and leather stretches, it would be helpful if the calf area had a bit of stretchy fabric like at the top of the thighs, because my calves are just way too muscular for these. My calves fit in the extra large very, very snugly, but my thighs are closer to medium. So if they added some means of adjusting (laces dont help all that much because leather is not stretchy initially) then this would be a superior item. As of right now the sizing is difficult, at least for me with my hikers legs."
4.0,Bought them for volleyball kept my glasses on nicely.
4.0,These masks were nicely made and good value. I shared them with my daughter-in-law who works with children with hearing difficulties. It was very helpful for her to give them the option of seeing her mouth.  I found the mask comfortable but my daughter-in-law did find they were warm because the plastic does not breathe.  To be fair she struggles with wearing masks generally.  The thickness is suitable for the material... Any heavier and the mask would be uncomfortable.  Overall I am pleased with the purchase.
4.0,"Very pretty design. I gave each one of these robes to my bridesmaids. The only issue I would say is the sizing, it's not super inclusive to someone who is bigger in size unfortunately."
4.0,"Beautiful dress but it was too big. I was really excited to get it, but unfortunately it was a couple inches too big around the torso and length-wise. The belt didn't make it better because that was certainly too big when put around my waist (smallest circumference on my body--you'd think the belt would be a little smaller accordingly???) To be fair, I am a sort of small human-- 5'0&#34; and 120 lbs.<br /><br />Also, the close-up of the fabric made me think it was going to be heavier duty cotton, but it's not. Just normal light cotton. Probably a good thing for summer. It'll always need ironing, though."
4.0,"I ordered XL after all measurements, I got today I was very excited to wear on when I did it was small . Now I ordered other XXL right now. I was need on Friday evening, now let see if I get earlier. All over product is great."
4.0,"This product shipped quite fast which is a big plus. I like the colors and the shapes. Very cute. The only thing I didn't like about it is that it's a little awkward feeling in my mouth. I'm guessing because of the shape. The bar is a little shorter than I'm used to [I still have the original bar I got when I had my tongue pierced, the long bar they use.] Another thing that I didn't particularly like is that after about a week, it started to dig in my tongue when I was asleep. I probably won't keep this in all the time. I'll more than likely just put it in for special occasions or going out. Other than the awkward feel, it's a good product. Good price, especially for two pieces. The heart is smooth coated too, which I didn't expect. So you don't feel the diamond part on the roof of your mouth. It's just smooth."
4.0,"The shoes fit but were not very comfortable but wearable.  Hopefully that improves as I wear them in.  I am using these as Coca Cola Santa Boots, which are traditionally brown.  They look good.  Too early to tell how they will hold up. Only tried them on once."
4.0,"I love the colors in this pack. I wish they were a little thicker though, they are not as thick as yoga pants (which is what I was hoping for). They are basically thick nylon stockings."
4.0,"They are ok, just didn't go along with what I had in mind."
4.0,"Hey...these are sweat bands.  Bought them cause I am an older, overweight dude who sweats a lot here in SW Virginia!  These were a good deal for the price and other than the rude comments I get from friends when I wear the less than manly colors I have no complaints.  So far they have held up well and during the summer I have one on all the time.  Will probably buy again and try to do a better job of color coordinating my shorts and sleeveless T's!"
4.0,It is a nice outfit
4.0,"Escellent polarized sunglasses and very confortable to wear. I like the matte finish. One note, The model N6192S is not the one pictured and that is why I give it only 4 stars. I'm attaching the correct photo for the model."
4.0,I liked the the cut outs for the nipples but I did have to be careful peeling it off. But overall liked the support and it didn’t come off while wearing it.
4.0,"These are SO cute, but they are very small. I bought this for my kid’s 10th bday party, but they were way too small."
4.0,"Quality shirt, soft feel. Wasn't the design I ordered but my kiddo loves it anyways"
4.0,Cute fall shirt
4.0,Really good has a lot of card slots
4.0,Very stylish and updated suit
4.0,one of the rhinestones was missing so I glued it back on
4.0,My husband does use this one but was disappointed it was only 1 layer and a bit hot for summer. He feels it'll be more useful in the fall and winter. For now we've purchased some cotton fabric ones.
4.0,"Works great, portable, incredible quality material.<br /><br />I recommend.<br /><br />It's not too large but it's around the standard size.<br />I look forward to the next windy storm to see how it holds up since it's wind resistant"
4.0,I like it ;simple but cute !!
4.0,"Male, 5'9, 165* pounds, I got a large while I felt the back was a bit baggy than expected. I thought it was a good fit overall. Had a fun time doing a photo shoot with these on. Super cute and comfortable! :)"
4.0,Love this dress! It wrinkles easy is my only complaint!
4.0,"nearly perfect,  but would like it to be more flexible. Otherwise  it's great 👍."
4.0,"Wider than expected, and the metal feels a little cheap, but it looks like the description and sizing was accurate."
4.0,Was really nice
4.0,"This was a Mother of the Bride dress. Got lots of compliments. Ordered size 6. Required alterations in the shoulders to shorten the bodice but I'm only 5'3"".  Took 25 days to be delivered."
4.0,This black velvet box was clean and nice for small necklaces and small earrings.
4.0,"Love this suit overall, although I had to return the first one I ordered because of an unfinished edge, I received the replacement 2 days later.<br />The dress part is made of mesh so it will dry quickly and won't be heavy when wet. The only part that I don't like is the crotch is a bit uncomfortable because it's a straight seam across and not like a panty. Would be 5 stars if not for that.<br />I am thrilled to find a modest suit that is so cute! I won't feel self conscious walking along the beach."
4.0,great dress for a casual party
4.0,I like the texture of this tie and it looks great. Have no qualms. I only gave it 4/5 because I think durability may be an issue however so far seems to be holding up fine.
4.0,"Got this for my daughter to wear as a Halloween outfit(2020) with the bonus that she could just wear after as a hoodie to keep warm.<br />The print was great and correct (All issues with that are fixed) and has not faded in the wash.  It is very thin but she loves to wear it over other stuff, so it makes a great extra layer.<br />I would buy it again."
4.0,"Pretty, but smaller than realized."
4.0,really cool looking
4.0,"Nice Maxi Dress, fits well, looks nice, fabric feels ok, not great"
4.0,I'm 140 pds 5&#34;5 I've recieved many complements . Love the color and style. perfect to wear with swimwear or pair of shorts.
4.0,"Cute dress, just wish it was Jersey rather than a silky polyester."
4.0,"I got this for a Halloween 5k so I had a costume to wear that I could still run in without too much trouble. It worked great! I even ran into another girl wearing one of the other styles, so that was fun. I got compliments on it from 5 different people too! So it was really a good choice and the price was definitely fair.<br /><br />BUT... The sizing was a little weird and I'm not sure if it was sewn wrong (if you look at the attached photo you can see the lower vertebrae are kind of cut off. I thought I got the right size, but I ended up ripping the back while tying my shoes (it held up for the whole race with a safety pin and no one noticed). Also, it says it's sheer, but the bones are definitely see through even when the fabric isn't stretched (at least in this design) so you'll probably want to wear something under it.<br /><br />For sizing: I ordered a small and I'm 5'3,135lbs and wore leggings and a shirt under it, I wish I had gotten a medium, maybe it wouldn't have ripped."
4.0,Arrived on time. Size is true fit. Material was nice to touch. Good product
4.0,Very pretty and very durable. The snape of the shoe where the toes are does press your toes alittle and hurts a lot after a while.
4.0,Love the fabric used.
4.0,Sent this as a gift. The recipient was very pleased with the color and fabric and is looking forward to wearing it.
4.0,Super tiny and very lightweight. I make a lot of earrings and these are great for children’s earrings. The detail on them is nice.
4.0,Pants are perfect. They are flattering and make you look lean. But the top runs small for 40 D size breast. Was disappointed  because the top is too small.
4.0,Bought for myself. Texting glove really works just a little bulky- to big for my hands. Probably fit man good.
4.0,"I'm quite happy with this watch. The curved design is reminiscent of a vintage tank watch.<br />The one thing that surprised me was the way the crystal disperses light across the face, see pics. It's something that you'll enjoy or be very annoyed. I think this is much more visible on the black dial than the white.<br />The one short coming is the strap (loss of one star) that will be replaced soon.<br />Overall this is an excellent buy and value"
4.0,"They are nice , took long then expected to get here . Works well"
4.0,"It's pretty but not very expensive looking but then again, it was under 10 bucks.  Not too big but a good size for a man. Cool design. You can't go wrong for the money!"
4.0,A little more form fitting but I really like this shirt very cute!
4.0,"Fits a little small, but great for running"
4.0,So many compliments I love it.
4.0,"This dress is very nice. It's very comfortable and the rucheing is nice for hiding a tummy, however it's still not the most flattering material. The length is great because it's not to long to wear with flat sandals. Overall I'm happy with the purchase."
4.0,"Very pretty blouse, fit as expected, maybe a tad large, but I think a smaller size would have been too small."
4.0,"Looks kind of different from the picture, but I still like it. The color's a little darker than pictured, and the material's pretty thin. It's a pretty shirt, though - I wear it a lot. I think I got the XXL, but I probably should've gotten the XL since I'm generally a size small in US shirts, but I'm always weary when it comes to Asian sizing. Follow the size correspondences and you should be fine."
4.0,"It took almost a month and a half to get here (I actually forgot about it until it showed up in my mailbox), but it's cute and fun. I don't know what strong smell others are commenting about. It just smells like leather to me."
4.0,This size runs very small.  Their 3× was like a US extra small.
4.0,"This.is.gorgeous!  It is prettier in person than in the pictures.  It looks well made and it comes in a really nice satin-lined box for protected storage.  The only reason I only gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it’s TINY.  Think glasses case.  I don’t even think my oversized sunglasses would fit.  My phone would never fit...even a smaller model (I have an iPhone Plus model).  You could totally fit your credit card, ID, some lip gloss, a pen, etc...in it.  I don’t mind the size so much even if it doesn’t hold my phone.  The other part of the 4/5 star rating is because the chain is really short.  It would be awkward to wear on your shoulder (unless you’re a child).<br /><br />However, the bag is adorable and really stunning.  I’ll make it work despite its small size."
4.0,"I'm a size 5 in juniors and the medium fits my hips, but the legs are a little bit loose.  this might be fine if you're a bit on the heavy side, but I am skinny.  normally leggings do not fit this way, however..."
4.0,very nice -  love dragonflies
4.0,"Fits great, super flattering.  Every time I wear this dress, I get a ton of compliments.  The fabric is very thin and you can tell it's not of the highest quality when you take it out of the package but it doesn't matter!  Wash on it's own the first time and then it's fine to throw in w everything else!"
4.0,"This is a very well designed bra and fit me very well. I wear a size a size 36D and generally prefer wireless and seamless bras. This bra has an underwire and isn’t seamless, however,  I found it quite comfortable and pretty in pink. It did an fine minimizing job and didn’t dig into my skin."
4.0,"This blouse is very pretty and well made. The fabric wears well and is practically wrinkle free. I like the way it hangs. It holds nice lines. The adornments are minimalistic, yet classic.<br /><br />I would have given it 5 stars, but the width of the sleeves are not in proportion with the bodice. In fact, I typically wear a M. But I sized up in hopes that the sleeves would not be snug. Alas, they were.<br /><br />Overall, a great blouse for those who have skinny upper arms.<br /><br />Made in China.<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful."
4.0,Purchased for 4 kids so they each had a bright color for easy identification .<br />Webbing seems durable yet light enough to monogram with kids’ initials. Would buy again
4.0,Silky soft and seamless but do run a size too small
4.0,This product did not fit my head. But its thick kinda. Some of my other wigs I own feel way more comfortable though I'd recommend buying if you have a small head otherwise I think I may need to trim to bangs or something they seemd way too short but that could just be me
4.0,"I like the texture and the style but a little big for me, but I can give it to my sister. Thanks for on time shipping."
4.0,"Really like this dress, it fits a little tight but I'm attributing that to th swelling from being pregnant, I wish they had made this a little more flexible for &#34;maternity&#34; because it wasn't as true to size as other maternity clothes that I've purchased. But it's super cute dress just be cautious on a windy day 😂"
4.0,"This top is an overall good value. I love the styling of it and it goes great with a pair of white linen pants or white shorts. The pink bow in the back is a unique touch that I haven't seen on many other tops. I got tons of compliments when wearing it!<br />You definitely need a strapless or convertible style bra that you can criss-cross in the back. No big deal either way, but something to note. The fabric is definitely very lightweight. Great for a hot Summer day. I did notice that after 2 wears, the fabric is starting to &#34;pill&#34; in the armpits and where my purse would normally touch my hip. I honestly didn't expect this to be a shirt that would last for the next 10 years, so I'm certainly not upset by the durability factor. The shirt is a good length for shorts. I'm 5'4 and it's great for my shorts, but would probably be a bit short to wear with skinny jeans or tights.<br />For the price, you can't beat it and have noting to lose!"
4.0,"I love the pack and variety these come in, however, in using these it can backfire if one of your piercings isn't completely healed.<br />I have a couple helix and a tragus piercing that these are being used in. All were pierced at the same time and it's been over a year. One of the rings kept opening, which caused one side of the helix piercing to stay in but another side was left out and when I noticed it, I had to force the ring back through which made the entire area pretty aggravated again.<br />I now have to use salt water and antimicrobial to dress it every other day which will make the tone fade even faster. The only thing I'm glad for is the fact that there's plenty of them.<br />It would be cool if they sold a pack of one size instead of multiple sizes so when you find the size you like or what works for your piercing, you can buy a complete set of that diameter.<br />I would recommend, but at the same time, be careful that one or more may get hung up on hair or in sleep and unlatch. I've only had this happen on 1 out of 3 so far but if your piercing isn't over a year, you may deal w/ the same problem."
4.0,"Cute, cute dress! I normally wear a 2-4 and tried the small but ended up getting a medium. Looks like something you would wear on a trip to Greece."
4.0,"Surprisingly, they both fit and either look phenomenal ... or just make me feel like they do, and that's pretty much the same thing in my book. Whoever would have thought a purchase I made to subvert a work rule (no leggings allowed) while still being able to enjoy a once-monthly jeans day comfortably would turn out to be such a good move. No one's been the wiser. Hah."
4.0,"I love this. It's a great size, a little under an inch, and not too conspicuous or heavy. Exquisite filigree detail that the photo doesn't quite do justice. On the back it is inset or indented, so not quite as thick as you'd suppose, with a hatch grid pattern and a good size print of ""USA"" and "".925"".<br /><br />I did have to remove one star, 4 of 5, because the silver that attaches the pendant to the jump ring is very thin and can bend easily. You can see that in the photo, so weigh your options and be careful with it when you wear it. Also a few nicks on the pyramids, but I didn't buy mine on Amazon and don't know who to blame for that. But it is really pretty, and I get happier with the choice every day. So so pretty, in my opinion."
4.0,Very pretty but it was too small for me to be able to tie in front as I wanted.
4.0,I LIKE. ALL EXCEPT THE CATS EYE BEADED BRACELET
4.0,Great value and good quality. The 4 Rhinestone septum ones are a little bit too big and loose on me. Have to constantly adjust or doesn’t stay on well.
4.0,"Absolutely gorgeous scarf. My only complaint is that the fabric is too slippery and it kept shifting all day the first time I wore it, no matter how I had it on. All in all, I'm still pleased with my purchase."
4.0,It was so cute but it ran small and short! I had to give it to a smaller friend because I couldn’t walk out of the house all exposed like that. But if I had ordered a size up it would’ve been great.
4.0,Nice sturdy glasses for the low price. I have worn other 3.25 strength and these seemed to be a little stronger. The fit behind the ears was a little too tight but overall loved the glasses.
4.0,"The dress looks very flattering on my wife. It’s exactly as pictured and very comfortable, according to her. No issues with the fit or look. The ruffles are feminine and the balloon sleeves add a nice accent to what’s an otherwise a simple dress.<br /><br />It’s lightweight and looks great with tights and boots. The fabric is ribbed so if it’ll hide any small stains from accidental food falls.<br /><br />I have attached a picture of my wife wearing it.. For reference, she’s 5’4 and 117 pounds."
4.0,Great earring just wished they were bigger.
4.0,"Still fogs your glasses, vents have tendency to fall out.<br />Nice to have extra filters."
4.0,"Nice addition to a man's choice of accessories.  Size should be advertised, i have average wrists and it was decent fit."
4.0,I was very happy with the necklace and little bag that came with it.  I was a bit disappointed because it looks different than the picture though.  I was expecting a natural colored silk thread and it is a metallic gold.  This gives the necklace a 'fancier' look and I wanted a very 'casual'.  The blues are much lighter and also there are no dark browns. It is suitable for my office job and I'm wearing it right now.
4.0,Soft stretchy form fitting
4.0,Excellent bag. These bags last for years. My only disappointment is that it did not come in a gift box or Marc Jacobs cover bag as this was a gift.
4.0,Ordered for my pre teen daughters. They are a little big. But they liked the styles.
4.0,Barefoot no more.
4.0,"I love it, its so cute. My only problem was when I got it, the envelope had a hole in it where the charm was, and the charm was not in a bag or anything to protect it from not falling out of the hole in envelope."
4.0,delivered fast.
4.0,"Picked these up hoping for style and playability on the court. They do look nice, but not really for court use. I could see someone rolling an ankle in these. But they are some clean looking shoes."
4.0,"I love my new mask! It just likes to get in my mouth, but most masks I have do that. I get many positive comments on it."
4.0,Fits true to size. Nice for layering I'm 5ft 4ft and normally where one or 2x and this fits perfect.
4.0,"The only complaint I have about this, is the top has a little bow, it fell off after first wash..other than that this bathing suit is a great fit for those who don't want to show stretch marks , I have two kids and don't have much confidence when it comes to bikinis but now with this I feel more comfortable"
4.0,I normally wear a Lg size shirts but had to order the XL based on others opinions that it's not US size.  At XL it's form fitting but comfy.
4.0,"I like the style the fit and the feel of these boots and have been a fan of Born Shoes for a while. However, I had to return these boots because they were Brown and not truly rust-colored. Since I already had a pair of brown shorts boots I returned these."
4.0,"This display dome is well made and attractive but it turned out to be too short for the watch I intended it for, and there is no way to adjust the height of the hook."
4.0,Sweater is pretty and fits great. Very thin material not exactly what I was expecting but I'll still be wearing this at the barn.
4.0,It was aight
4.0,This was bought for my daughter as she was going to a Derby party.  She liked the hat and she got many nice remarks on it.
4.0,"I am really pleased with this colorful, mod design. It's classy and an antidote to what you might be looking for--relief from boring, play-it-safe cufflink designs. The links are big--a little smaller than a nickel--so they show off very well. If you're into design, I'd say that the colors are playful, and hint at the feminine while counterpointed by the chunky, masculine energy of the square profile. (If you're not into design, I'd just say that these are colorful, not conservative.)<br /><br />These were shipped from China and arrived via China Post. I'd say I got them in a little more than a week. The photo on the Amazon site do them justice and are color-correct. Great bargain for what would otherwise be an expensive boutique purchase."
4.0,"First, this is an inexpensive dress and I would consider it cheaply made BUT it's fun and easy to wear. In the sun you can see through it some. I am a medium/large (size 10 pant and 36C bust) and ordered the medium and the fit is nice. Most fitted part of the dress is the chest, I would not size up if you are on the fence. The adjustable straps are great! I'm only 5' 1"" and it is above my knee. I would think this would flatter just about any body type."
4.0,"Great sweater!  I wanted a cardigan so I could open it if I get too warm--this fits the bill.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I was spoiled by the last sweater I bought from Woolovers, which has a zipper in addition to buttons.  Seems redundant but I like the flexibility it provides.  This new sweater does not have a zipper--so 4 stars instead of 5."
4.0,"Would recommend for a petite or shorter waisted person. I have a longer torso and i felt like it was too short. Otherwise a cute shirt, especially for the price."
4.0,"I purchased this watchband, because I was sick of the thin leather loops of typical leather watchbands that always twist and break. I figured I'd certainly have better luck with metal bands, and I'm not disappointed.<br /><br />I would say this watch band is a quality product, with only a couple of reservations: First, the leather band is not nearly as thick as a typical watchband, and I worry about its durability and longevity. Second, the way that you loop it through your watch is very difficult to figure out, even with the instructions on the bag the watchband comes in. Once you have it all set up properly, you still have one metal loop very visible from the top, and three metal loops on the underside (counting the strap).<br /><br />While I like the concept of metal loops for the longevity of the watchband, that's countered by the thinness of the leather band, and I find their appearance somewhat off-putting."
4.0,Gorgeous hat. Sad it's waaaaayyyy too small for me.
4.0,very sparkly and realistic
4.0,"really cute, sized correctly"
4.0,A little thin but a beautiful decorative piece.
4.0,Beautiful but smaller than expected
4.0,"The Jungkook figure falls off after 15 times of taking it out and hand-washing it when we get back. I bought a replacement of-course, but just wanted future buyers to be aware."
4.0,"Fits fine with my son. However, my small santa did find his beard, it was missing in the package."
4.0,great pair of casual pants.
4.0,"Very TTS, however, the material was not as expected. I will definitely wear the dress again as I received lots of compliments!"
4.0,Strap a little thin but it works well
4.0,Item received in excellent condition.  Was the hit at the birthday party for a welder.
4.0,"IT looks  nice, but it not the chapel I was hoping it to be ."
4.0,"This bikini is so cute! It's hard to find a more modest bikini and this one is great. I am about 135 lbs. and 5'4&#34;, very average. I read the reviews on this suit and went with a medium-- planning on just being able to wear the top with black bottoms I already have. I normally wear a medium in bathing suit bottoms, and didn't think they would fit based off of the other reviews saying the suit ran small. I was surprised to find that the bottoms fit really well. The top was loose, so I sewed the back straps together so the top fits more like a sports bra without the clasp. I have yet to wear the suit in water, but I'm assuming that it'll work out just fine. I only gave this product four stars because of having to make slight alterations. I also read that someone else tied the straps together in the back. Every person's body is different though, so everyone's opinion won't be the same (and if you have prime, take advantage of it if you want the suit because you are able to return it at no cost). This is a pretty reasonable cost for a swimsuit, most retailers sell tops and bottoms separately for at least $15 and the material can be just as cheap."
4.0,Basic messenger bag for everyday use. Convenient side pocket and zippered closure is a plus.
4.0,"The fit was fine, but the tan upper with navy lower really didn't look flattering on me."
4.0,Pretty embroidery and good fit but the loophole ribbons that hold the apron tore in just a couple of hours.
4.0,I got a small and it is a little lose. It's cute and looks like the picture. The plaid part is a little stiff so you need to wash it before wearing it.
4.0,Bought it for my niece and not was perfect!
4.0,"I bought two of these for my daughters. They fit perfectly and look cute. After one wash, one of the dresses’ unicorn stamp got scratched so that was a bummer (hence why I took a star away) but my child will still wear it."
4.0,It’s nice the picture is a little bit more vibrant then irl
4.0,Cute for the price beads are white chain is a little cheaper than I would like but you will be able to get a couple of wears
4.0,Love it!!! Alittle big on me but I can grow into it!
4.0,"Quality materials. We’ll made. The arch was too high for me, but if you need a high ar h, this is your flipflop."
4.0,"Different varieties to choose from, which is great.  The kids loved it."
4.0,The stone is little bit too big for me. But as a ring it's a nice piece with a good price.
4.0,Great dress for beach
4.0,deels good but caused my plantar fascittis to flare up.  My fault I guess
4.0,The thickness of these leggings is amazing.  Love the pockets!!  I was between a M and L and went with the L.  The legs fit great but I think the waist runs a bit large.  I have to pull up every once and a while.  I would recommend sizing down if between sizes.  I’ll likely order a M next time (I’m a curvy size 8 normally).
4.0,Great!  it fits well
4.0,"I bought this after shoulder surgery because I couldn't do a back fastener. Fits fine and washes well, but I really wanted one with cups like a regular bra in my plus size."
4.0,The colour was a little different then the Pendant but other than that - it is beautiful.
4.0,"I ordered a large as according to many reviews, this top runs small and has no stretch, however it was too large and had plenty of stretch, so much so that it's almost a tunic on me. Unless you like a baggy/long fit (like a tunic) I recommend ordering your usual size."
4.0,If you're busty you'll want to go a size up.
4.0,Very pretty watch.  Working okay and arrived on time.
4.0,"Ring arrived looking just like photo, nice product.  Custom engraving was done to order, great job.  Note, 9mm ring, in general, is a wide ring so be sure this is the look you want, for me it was and I am happy with my purchase.  I would recommend this ring and this supplier."
4.0,Nice thin dress. Good with leggings.
4.0,"Nearly perfect, except it makes me wish my legs were two inches longer, and my boobs were an inch higher (like they were in my twenties). But a good bra and a pair of heels might fix it... but since I wear flats I will probably just trim the hem. I ordered a medium, as I normally do, and I probably wouldn't have room for my boobs in a small, so for me this dress fit true to size. The fabric is nicer than any other bodycon dress I've bought on Amazon (which, admittedly, is a short list).<br /><br />Edit: this dress gets ridiculously wrinkly and It's impossible to press them out. Even a professional laundered couldn't do it."
4.0,"Fair price, nice women watch."
4.0,A little bulky but works well even with many bills.
4.0,I like the looks and feel of my new gloves.  The lining is a bit thin but I think it is nice and warm and good looking
4.0,Nice band.  The only issue is shortening the links.  It's really easy to bent the pin in the tool if you don't get it on the band correctly.  On the plus side they provide replacement tool pins in base of the tool.  The band and tool came in a nice tin &#34;pill&#34; type box.  Nice touch.  The closing clasps on the band work well and feel smooth on the inside so it doesn't scratch.
4.0,"Very cute dress.  I already went up one size from my normal dress size but I might have gone up two.  If you are on the border of a size on the size chart, go up.  It still fit well and I love the pattern!"
4.0,"Nice bag. Seems durable, well constructed, and looks good. Love the addition of the handle, too. Sufficient inside pockets, one with a zipper, and the pockets with zippers at each end are great for keys and small items. I find the bag provides a good amount of room inside for the items I carry with me at work. Just no place for a water bottle on the outside for easy access but all in all I am pleased with this purchase."
4.0,I have an odd body big stomach..(I like to blame the kids!) I ordered this in a 4x and wear about a 14-16 in swim suits it does fit as stated in other reviews. Make sure you look at the size chart and order from it. the suit material is thin but looks great. The con is the small pads that are in the top I cut them out. They are extremely small I have an average bust for my size about a d cup over all the suit is nice for the price and I wont see a lot of people wearing it.. Or I hope!!
4.0,"It's really nice looking, exactly how the photo shows, problems are that the sleeves seems a bit too long and I wasn't expecting it to be so thin, I get it's 100% polyester but it's great for spring or fall but not really cold weather. I told my wife I could return it for one thicker and she said no, she loves it."
4.0,They were tinier than I thought but I found use for them but most likely won't order them again.
4.0,The top and the bottom always come different sizes
4.0,"How pretty! This is a stripe for people who don't normally like stripes. Very appealing colors - very slenderizing vertical stripes. But, if you order this be prepared to get a very sheer dress which is super, super long. Size L usually fits me well. This dress was way too small. However, with the recent loss of 35 lbs, it is realistic to think that my diet may help me fit into this dress eventually. This darn dress is just too pretty to send back! But, I'm not made of money, and had to consider whether I was being foolish, keeping something that I can't wear. No matter how much I (really, really) liked it, there had to be something more sensible than just WISHING for it to work out. So,  I weighed another pro and another con. Con: It would require a new hem. Do I like it enough to spend $$ to have that done? (Not usually, but in this case, yes.) Would a new hem have the same light, fluttering look that the original does? (Some risk.) Pro: The 20 pearly pink buttons down the front are beautiful, and, by themselves, would cost about as much to buy as the cost of this dress. If all else fails, using these buttons to replace the simple white ones on my current favorite dress (also with a long button down front) would make it look even prettier ... and more expensive. In the end, the buttons helped decide it for me."
4.0,Love these shirts and was even excited when a coworker told me to order a size smaller next time. :-)
4.0,"These were super cute and fit my 4 month old perfectly. I do wish they had some more &#34;vibrant&#34; colors as well, but she was still able to wear most of them with the Christmas clothes we had."
4.0,"I ordered this halo headdress to wear for a David Bowie tribute show this past weekend, because I wanted to get glammed up and let my inner Lady Stardust loose.<br /><br />I was a little concerned when my headdress arrived in a too small box because it was very bent. However, I was able to flatten it back out by leaving it overnight with heavy books on it and it was as good as new.<br /><br />I was surprised to discover that this headdress is just made out of a plastic headband and zip ties that have been spray painted gold. I’m not sure if that’s really worth what I paid for it, and I was a little embarrassed to realize it would have been REALLY easy to make this myself. —- However, I was happy with how it looked, it worked perfectly for the occasion and I got soo many compliments on it that I’m not going to complain too much."
4.0,"I love that these belts are full grain, which is a step up from top grain, and a big leap above bonded leather. And forget the artificial leather belts flooding the men's clothing stores altogether. My artificial leather belts, which I'm discarding, have begun to crumble after a few years. Full grain leather is considered the finest quality leather available. That said,  these will take some time to loosen up like harness leather."
4.0,"Product as expected. The finish is not the best quality, however they work well and store nicely in the inside purse pocket or around the handle."
4.0,"I definitely had my doubts about the items, but it turned out to be a pretty good buy. The ones they sell in the bike shops are just so ridiculously expensive, I’d much rather buy 5 of these."
4.0,Will not know until after Christmas.
4.0,"They have strong chemical odor that is hard to come off and I have to get used zipping from the outside, but they are cute, cute! and they are comfortable. I only give a four star because of the odor."
4.0,Color is darker than expected but not much.  More of a taupe or mushroom color instead of beige or champagne.  If you wear an XL or XXL order the largest size offered (4X).  It fits fine since I don’t plan on wearing it zipped.  This will be great for snowbirds who are leaving cold weather to head to sunny shores since once you arrive at the airport it will easily compact into the little pouch including and tuck right into a purse or tote bag.
4.0,Makes me look like I have a fat butt and short legs...luckily I can modify it:)
4.0,"Husband loved it.  Looks great like his previous UM gym bag, however, it has not worn as well. Material is unraveling and ripping so I don't expect it to hold up as long as previous bag."
4.0,Fit and quality was good but color was not as pictured. Had to return the shirts because color was off
4.0,Viene muy arrugado eso es lo que no me gusto por lo demás está bien.
4.0,Fits as expected.  Bought for a Christmas party and it was great.  Only thing I dislike is that it is cut fairly low so it shows a lot of cleavage.
4.0,"The heart doesn’t look quite the same in the pictures. It’s cute, but bigger than I wanted."
4.0,Fits cute but the sleeves seem a little too short for the cut. Otherwise it's super cute. Its got an embroidered pattern. Very cute.
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress, I just wish the fabric was the traditional cotton fabric! The color is bright and vibrant. There is elastic around the shoulders that help keep the top up.<br /><br />In the photos I have on a undershirt to help the bottom flare out more. The first photo is the dress without the underskirt on, as you can see how limp it is.<br /><br />4 stars because of the fabric! 95% polyester 5% Spandex. I'm a L, women's size 14 and ordered the large. When it stretches, the pattern sort of fades and turns white. Even though it does stretch, it isn't lined underneath so you will have to wear the appropriate undergarments.<br /><br />The underskirt I bought for this dress can be found here: [[ASIN:B01DQ9P8QC Shop Ginger Wedding Bridal Mermaid Fishtail 1 Hoops Petticoat Under Garment Slip (Black)]]"
4.0,"The glasses came quickly,  and batteries were included surprisingly! The neon light on the glasses is really cool and it has 3 different modes (solid, flashing, sync with music).  It says they're waterproof, I'm not sure if I want to try that out. One Main reason why I bought these glasses was because I wanted light up diffraction glasses. To me the lens don't diffract light they just seem a little blurry that the reason I gave 4 stars. Over all though these glasses are really cool and your bound to impress anyone with them."
4.0,Adorable shirts and great quality but they run very small! My daughter wears 2T just about everywhere and these fit more like 18 month clothes.
4.0,"About the middle ground, better than cheaper  stuff from Volde★Mart but not quite as good as Carhartt. Go a size higher."
4.0,I love them! Perfect fit for my face.
4.0,This mask is fun it’s kinda big…. Holds up well after washing silky
4.0,These were so huge on my face.
4.0,"I was impressed with this bag, looks and feel like leather.  Bag was fully  lined and nice hardware accents.  Highly recommend"
4.0,Unless you’re a hussy this dress is a bit see through and you’ll prolly want a full slip. I used one and it worked wonderfully and the dress did not disappoint!
4.0,"Good for one time use. Fast delivery, exactly as expected."
4.0,A little tight but I  didn’t buy the right size. Looks pretty good
4.0,I gave 4 stars because is overprice for the tiny size.
4.0,My granddaughter loves all the different styles. Definitely for a young person
4.0,The top to small n pants are the Knocker type. If I don't wear I can give to my sister.
4.0,"These dresses are perfect for beach vacations!  Really flattering fits - I'm 5'4"" and 135 lbs, the medium fit great."
4.0,"I love *almost* everything about this bathing suit. It covers up all the right places while still being really cute. I wear I size 36DDD bra and the girls have plenty of room, with just a peak of cleavage. I mostly wear this for family events and swimming with my 10 year old nephew and I never feel self conscious about spilling out, which for busty girls, is an amazing thing. I’m currently trying to lose weight and went from about 189 to now about 176 (pictured) and I still feel like this bathing suit fits well since it’s pretty loose anyway! This one is a large, and I’m happy with the size I chose.<br /><br /> My one major gripe is that the straps are adjustable in case you want to cross them in the back- I never like this feature in a bathing suit because I never do that, some might but for me it’s an annoyance because every so often the strap will randomly just *pop* and of course it clips in the back so I either have to ask someone for help or go in and adjust everything, which is really annoying, especially since I don’t even use the feature. The first time I put the bathing suit on I could not get it to stop unclipping and it was really frustrating. I eventually had to twist the strap so that the clip was facing the opposite way, which seems to work. So now I just walk around with twisted straps, but it’s better than them popping off constantly!<br /><br />Besides that, definitely happy with this purchase. It was exactly what I was looking for."
4.0,"These glasses are very good looking but don't quite compare to the black frame blueblockers. Visually, they come up short when compared to the black frame glasses."
4.0,"The XXL 18-20 fit true to size.  I have ~50"" hip and regularly wear size size 20 or 22W in pants, and these fit fine and feel pretty comfy.  My only complaint might me a mea culpa, but be warned - WASH THESE SEPARATELY WHEN YOU FIRST RECEIVE THEM!  I unfortunately got the 3 pack of black, put them in with a load of laundry when I got them, and a TON of black dye came out and unfortunately dyed other things that were in the wash with it.  Sigh.  Hopefully that was a one time thing...  Will update review if these fall apart in time, but all in all they are good coverage and comfy and feel pretty good - they aren't as ""firm"" fitting as some other leggings I use for exercise, but they work well under a skirt.  The pocket is handy to stick something in to carry from point A to B, I probably will only be using a pinch though given how awkward things sit in there.  All in all a good price for trendy ""pocketed leggings."""
4.0,"I ordered a newborn size & it’s really cute, but would maybe fit a very tiny preemie..it’s ridiculously small. My first baby was 9 pounds, and my second will no doubt need at least a 6 month size at birth of this lol."
4.0,"This robe is a good value for the price. The material is not thin, but it's also not quite as thick as I would have liked. I also wish the length was a little longer to cover a little more below the knee - My ankles get cold outside (in the winter). Other than that, great robe. Hood is awesome. Pockets are a good size. Color (gray) was very nice/as it looks in the picture."
4.0,"One side of the thing on the bridge (don't know what it's called) is broken, so I can't really wear it because it's lopsided and slips. Super cute tho, so I gave it an extra star. Please send a new one & I'll update the review!!!! Idk why it's not letting me upload it, but I do have a picture!<br />UPDATE!: I actually just unscrewed the other side to even it out, it's kinda scratchy but it's ok. Everything was packaged well, shipped on time, and the shipper was prompt with my refund! I recommend!!!"
4.0,"Just a 4 star because I just put it in, but I have had my piercing for almost 30 yrs and it fit the small hole just fine and didn't hurt at all"
4.0,"works well, the button is a bit on the small size."
4.0,This jacket is really cute. It is a great weight and keeps my daughter dry. I'm a bit disappointed in the sizing. Followed their chart and it fits rather small. This won't get worn for long and for the price that is disappointing.
4.0,"Sorry about the grainy photo…I took it myself looking through a mirror. I ordered outside of my comfort zone and it didn’t turn out bad. I thought it was going to be too revealing at first, but it really isn’t. It’s a nice fit, comfortable and very stretchy without being tight nor clingy.<br /><br />The material is decent, somewhat thin, but not see-through. The ribbed texture has a slight sheen to it. Although the material isn’t top of the line, the dress is still well made and all seams an edges are sewn well. I recommend this dress… it will be perfect for spring and summer!"
4.0,"These are fine as far as curved barbells go but are externally threaded, which was not my preference but It's not worth the effort to return them. I'm not sure why the seller doesn't indicate the threading in the description, or they possibly send whatever they have since someone else answered that they were internally threaded in the questions section."
4.0,"These work very well, stay hooked and are nice quality.  I wish they were a bit longer."
4.0,Four stars because there's always room for improvement i.e the collar is huge and I had to order a size up to be safe. But other than that no issues :)
4.0,I do a Jason Voorhees  Cosplay. I wear this under my goalie mask to hide my face and beard. The solid black behind the eye holes of my goalie mask just makes me look very soul-less. It does ride up my neck and curl a bit but was still worth the purchase
4.0,I love the bottoms! The top could use more support and isn’t as flattering as the bottoms.
4.0,Very cute shorts! Waist was a little more snug than expected. Looks super cute and casual. I have bigger thighs so I was looking for some coverage with still looking cute.
4.0,"I ordered this ring with a tiger's eye. I can say that the silver and the stone are both real and are well made. I gave it 4 stars because the stone was a little loose when it arrived. I don't think that it was in danger of falling out, as the metal itself is solid, but it was loose and able to make a rattling sound when moved. A bit of glue underneath fixed it, so no major issue. Very good quality for the price.<br /><br />The ring was also much taller than expected (see pictures). This information was not obvious in the listing, and I wish I knew in advance.<br /><br />In total I would recommend. Shipping does take a while, but listed ETA was correct and it arrived at the beginning of the window."
4.0,Beautiful but a little stiff....looked great with my dress...
4.0,"These are your standard issue not overly expensive metal bangle bracelets.  BUT the colors are really beautiful and of course they have this subtle sparkle.  At this point if you were to ask my husband he would tell you ""they shed glitter in an unnatural way""; to me it's perfect to a sparkle hater not so much. Just between you (who ever is actually reading this) and me he really does like the glitter.<br /><br />Bracelets are well made, slip on over even large hand sizes.  I really like that these have a multitude of designs and patterns on several of the bracelets along with the simple maroon ones.  Overall, these are well made, eye catching and fun to wear.  Well worth this price point."
4.0,"I normally wear a size 18. I purchases a size 20-22 because I knew the Chinese close are always much, much smaller than the size you select. Well, the items were very well made, and just barely fit me, without being too snug.  These are well made, but tight, so you have to buy a size or 2 sizes bigger than you normally wear."
4.0,"I am very happy with the beautiful bangle bracelets. I got a great price on them, and they look so Fine!"
4.0,"My only criticism is that the actual color is more faded than the pic but that is not a bad thing for me as I like the more muted shade. I bought this for my 11 year old granddaughter and have not yet given it to her but having bought clothes for her before, I would say that this shirt may run a little on the bigger size.  It is a 50/50 cotton polyester blend so I don't expect it to shrink and will probably last a long time for her."
4.0,"These are adorable. Look at the photo because they're smaller than you might expect, but they're so cute and perfect for my teen who wants to go into astrophysics"
4.0,Wear it nearly everyday. No turning weird colors or skin reactions.
4.0,"Seems nice, good price, comfortable, just a little longer on the leg than I expected. But I'm a short person...so..."
4.0,"I love it, however I do dislike the green under the visor."
4.0,"Cute dress, but the fit is too big under the arms."
4.0,"I got this for my wife. It's lightweight and looks fantastic. It keeps excellent time. She wasn't overly fond of the bezel design, but loved the rest of the way it looks. There was one problem and that was the clasp. It's rather large and sits on the inside of the band against the wrist. She said it gets uncomfortable after a while. Other than that, she loves it.<br /><br />I received this item free or at a greatly reduced price in return for my honest review."
4.0,"Lovely dress, very feminine, couldn't have been prettier or made better, but the XXL fit a friend that wears a 10, perfectly."
4.0,The hat was shaped oddly and we couldn't get it to be &#34;normal.&#34; The rest of the outfit served its Halloween costume purpose. My son loves it. Hat was just very poor quality.
4.0,We use this mainly as a layering piece and it works well. It's not too thick and it's still breathable. The torso is a little shorter than we would have liked.
4.0,"Anyone that loves owls will absolutely fall in love with this charm. It's small, very well made and SO cute! I cannot wait to show off this little gem of a charm.<br />I received this at a discounted price in return for my unbiased review."
4.0,Shoe was find but sizing was small
4.0,"*I received a review unit of this product for an honest review and I want to emphasize that all opinions expressed on this review are solely mine and not influenced by others in any way<br /><br />This watch is yet another BUREI that has been added to my collection. This one in particular emits an air of combat and is highly inspired by other &#34;military&#34; or expedition watches out there. The dial is big and bold with very visible tick marks allowing the wearer to read the time even in the darkest of environments. The case itself is of high quality and it feels really good in the hand. I have worn it for the past three weeks and the case as a whole has yet to accumulate any blemishes.<br /><br />The time keeping is also quite spot on. I have not noticed any issues in the watch keeping up with the time and I do love the included date window. It allows me to easily see the day of the month without having to look down on my phone. The time adjustment knob is sturdy and durable so I do not have any issues fixing the time whenever I need to.<br /><br />As for the watch band, I do have to admit that this is the biggest disappointment. Although it is military inspired, the band to me can be easily damaged by water. There doesn't seem to have an water resistant properties and I can only wear this is casual settings rather than the environmental adventures that I go on. On the other hand, you can always swap out the band for something more rugged<br /><br />In the end, this is a great sports style watch great for casual use and will give you accurate time. I recommend it"
4.0,"My kids received some of these for xmas and had so much fun with them that I purchased a bunch for my daughter's birthday party.  It's a sleepover so I've got music, a disco light, and the colored finger flashlights . . . should be a blast!<br /><br />Now, you do have to plan for some broken lights.  Out of the 80 that I bought, 10 needed to be thrown away.  But, it's still a great price for the 70 that work."
4.0,"I bought them for my 8 yr old son and he love them. Great quality. The reason that I'm giving them four stars it's because the instructions manual, it's really poor. For that first time use, you kind of have to figure out a few things your self."
4.0,"These socks are just what I was looking for. Some socks are too tight, so they are a problem to put on. Your socks are easier to put on, yet they do the job."
4.0,The jewelry is quite a bargain!  It looked very elegant with my daughters prom dress. I would recommend this.
4.0,Works well.. love the fact that it is so adjustable.
4.0,Very. Nice .  ALLAH U AKBAR !
4.0,"Super glam/Super fun. Little loose around the middle, but that isn't a problem for my purposes."
4.0,OK bag for use when on vacation
4.0,"Great communication from seller, package arrived quickly.  Only problem is it’s extremely tight.  I could barely get it clasped and it felt like it was cutting off my circulation.  Will not be able to wear this one.  The other four I bought are perfect size."
4.0,Nice dress runs a little big on the size but very comfortable and came in really fast 😊
4.0,Runs a little<br />Smaller then it should...
4.0,"Came very wrinkled, had to steam before she could wear it. Bottom half is only tool, no fabric under. Child will need to wear shorts or pants under dress."
4.0,"I like the jacket, but the inside of the pockets are terrible.  it is the worse feeling material.  why would you even use such a horrible material.  other than that, the jacket is great.  just don't put your hands in the pockets."
4.0,Overall nice workout shirt! Super cute but when I tied the side into a knot it was a little shorter in the torso than I liked.
4.0,"They are very pretty, but maybe a little long for me."
4.0,"Great designs, but most are simply too long in width to hold modern ties."
4.0,"This is adorable! I love the pattern and style. I ordered a size up, but it is still very form fitting. Not a lot of &#34;leeway&#34; in the belly area."
4.0,My husband finds these very comfortable and enjoys it when he is told by others (even strangers) how much they admire them and is asked &#34;where did you get those?&#34;  Resulting in a longer conversation about this and that.
4.0,"Very colorful, is long.<br />I am 5'4&#34; tall will need to hem."
4.0,You could get cheaper or higher quality but this was the one she wanted and it was the going price for this item. Happy with product.
4.0,just kinda itchy. but looks and fits just like the pic
4.0,It's a bit to small. But I love it
4.0,Great buy. This was an unexpected joy to receive. Looks fantastist on.
4.0,Have used numerous times
4.0,Good quality but it was too long on wrist area& didn't fit well with my daughters winter coat
4.0,I love the movie the movie Akita so come across the hat was a easy choice for me I can say after it rained I was wearing the hat and it’s not as red but I still love it especially since I love rugged anyway lol
4.0,Unless you have a very large head dont bother.
4.0,I do wish that I would have went up a size but it still fits well. I just like things looser
4.0,"Wonderful bracelet!  Packing was top notch! Unfortunately, it is very small.  My wife has slender wrists, but she still won’t be able to wear this without some modification.  It’s almost sized for a child.<br /><br />The seller’s product listing is completely accurate on the listed size (6.18”) if anything the actual bracelet is slightly longer than that.  Totally my fault for not having a frame of reference that a normal human wrist is bigger than that.  I should have done my homework.<br /><br />We’re going to get some matching leather cord and make an extra loop at the end to add a little slack."
4.0,These are the right size but not as flat black as I recall.  But close enough replication of the Vietnam issue bars.
4.0,I love the dress and it’s the perfect dress for when we go on our cruise to Hawaii.
4.0,Loved them but lost them in fire
4.0,"Not the color pictured (lighter than I thought it would be), with some fraying. Also, no clue why the Velcro fastening is like this."
4.0,My scarf is so soft and warm<br />Love it!!
4.0,Lovely dress! Material not super but works ok..
4.0,I love the color. My favorite is green and I received a multi pack of bands last year but green was missing. I purchased this and it fits my galaxy watch 3 perfectly. However the small bands that keep the strap down are a little too big and there's a big gap. The silicone itself feels just like others.
4.0,"They don't 100% get rid of the &#34;granny glasses&#34; look associated with over-the-glasses sunglasses, but they're not bad! Whenever I drop them (which is often) one of the lens pops out, but I can pop it back in. I'd buy them again"
4.0,It's very pretty!! Great gift to give a friend who loves snow!
4.0,"When mine came, the prints aren't as black as depicted and because the paw prints seem slightly distorted in width, they look more like slightly aged bear prints in the mud (if mud were made of silver paint and the bear had walked through dark gray paint)  than a charm signed in black ink by a dog the size of a grasshopper.  But, it's still a nice addition to my bracelet - few things in life are perfect."
4.0,"Nice bracelet, with a good price ….. a little thin but will make a cute gift."
4.0,Shoe is great!  Ordered it thinking it was size 32 but was size 30.  Why doesn't this show size info?
4.0,Girlfriend likes it
4.0,My son was very happy with it but it was too large. Boys will be boys... Didn't read the insert. I trimmed it for him put it back together as per instruction.
4.0,"I wear a men's medium so I bought a large and it is *just* ( and I cannot stress how ""just"" this just is) barely too small for me, but other than that it is a superb hoodie."
4.0,"The material isn’t what I expected. I feel after it gets washed a few times, it will wear quickly."
4.0,Dress is just as described. Super soft and good length. I'm 5'4 and it hits just above my knees. My friends really liked this dress and I cannot wait to wear it for the holidays!
4.0,It's fantastic.  Love it
4.0,You may want to go up on the breast size. I loved the swimsuit it fit me well. I ordered an XL and I usually wear a 10 or 12 in the US with a 32DDD. The swimsuit looked just like the picture unfortunately the top had padding and the cup was too small.
4.0,Fabric is thick and comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Holds the girls in place while running.
4.0,This dress fit perfect but does fit a little closer in the torso than other swing dresses I have.  Not too tight just closer.  The material is very light but not see through.  I usually wear a 12 and bought the large in Olive green.
4.0,I love it. I was looking for a small purse that can carry a lot of my make up when I go out at night and I found this and it was cheap. It is not too sturdy but I am not complaining about it.<br /><br />I would buy it again and it does not look so cheap either.
4.0,The watch is made in Thailand. It looks new but reached me fully charged. Is that normal? A perfect informal kick around watch for me.
4.0,"This is a super cute outfit for vegas! I'm 5'3&#34; and 146 lbs and this fit me perfectly. I bought the large. My only gripe is that the crotch area fits a bit weird, but if you wear spanx underneath it smooths everything out. This isn't as scratchy as I thought it would be, but the top is mesh. The mesh part isn't super see through, but you'll be able to see a bra underneath. Overall this is a comfortable outfit."
4.0,Cute correct size. Not made of cat ears.
4.0,"I know this gets a lot of bad reviews but there are pros and cons to this outfit. It is extremely light weight and I live in Texas so I love it for the heat. Yes , the sleeves are big and drape down your arms considerably but if you are at a backyard party or out to the beach it is perfect. I absolutely love it except the sleeves and the only reason that I gave it four stars instead of five is because of that... is a very BoHo looking outfit"
4.0,These are wonderful.  I have a very muscular physique and these high light and fit my behind very well.  There's not a lot in the front crotch area and will show everything.  So keep that in mind if you are a bit shy.  The fabric is great and they are a bit stretchy.
4.0,"Love this dress, nice and comfortable."
4.0,Very cute and comfortable dress
4.0,I am very happy with these lenses. They fit will and lens clarity is nice. They are far superior to the walleva brand ones I had purchased before.
4.0,It looked good for a gift. Looked better than I expected for the price. Happy with it.
4.0,I thought were gonna be black but nope they  more like a dark grey....but I still like what got
4.0,As pictured! Nice and basic!
4.0,Good value .
4.0,All of the rings look beautiful! The cat ring is a little small.
4.0,"I could've went with a small because it's way too loosey goosey on me. I bought a medium, but I think I could've bought a size smaller. Also, it's leopard print; for some reason, the color is different in person."
4.0,"BEWARE**<br />I Love the leggings themselves— BUT the light grey was a magnifier for cellulite I didn’t even know I had! The darker colors do not but the light was horrible, also feel they run small- I am 5’1 127lbs ordered medium  tried a friends large and felt they fit better, love how it goes up the booty many leggings advertise they do but don’t actually, these however do and make your booty pop"
4.0,Very cute shirt but the buttons are too small and it unbuttons
4.0,"The material is really nice and good &#60;enough&#62; quality. I would have preferred that it be a tad bit thicker since as soon as it hits curves (and if you're curvy like myself), the material stretches enough that it kind of wants to be transparent. Make sense?<br />The shape of the bathing suit is exactly what I wanted. However, I would also have preferred that the leg part (the thighs) would have been a tad bit longer; maybe another 2&#34;-3&#34; longer so as to better cover that area."
4.0,Delivered on time and are exactly as described. My only concern is whether they will stand the test of luggage being put thru airlines.
4.0,Purchased this for my son to wear to a party along with the shirt for myself and one for my boyfriend. My sons fit great.
4.0,"These slip on so perfectly, not hard to pull up like others that are so tight. Very comfortable !"
4.0,Fots and looks as decribed.
4.0,Looks good and fits well. I get compliments on it all the time.
4.0,This is a beautiful dress. It’s very flattering and the material is so soft. My only complaint is it runs a bit big I honestly could of chose the next size down and had a better fit but overall I love this dress and still plan on wearing it. The split also goes all the way up so be warned if your going somewhere windy. But overall it’s an awesome dress and I plan on ordering more styles of this dress!
4.0,"It serves its purpose, but it does seem a little cheaply made. I just hope it holds up over time. Overall okay for what I paid for it."
4.0,"This item is super cute, but is very tight fitting for an adult woman's face."
4.0,they are beautiful and pretty I love them they took long for shipping a few few weeks but they came in mail they wasn't broken apart a little bend but I fit it back together but other then that I wear them everyday and I just love them so much
4.0,Lovely dress. Feels like pjs but looks so nice. Swishes and flows. I got an XL (I’m typically an L or XL) and this fits well. Got lots of compliments wearing out running errands! Would be equally lovely at a summer wedding or special event. Hopefully it holds up well.
4.0,Top didn't fit but bottom fit nice and snug. I predicted the triangle top would be too small though considering I'm a 32 DD but needed a M in bottom. Overall I think it's a great looking 2 piece!
4.0,"Nice shirt, but the back is really long, which I did not expect."
4.0,I am very happy with these socks.  I am a woman who wears 10.5 to 11 in shoes so women's socks rarely fit.  These are perfect and good quality!
4.0,Loved it but I lost it. Pop in pin is a million times easier and less frustrating than the threaded types. Will buy again its so worth not having to struggle with a tiny tiny screw on or in ball.
4.0,Very stretchy. Fringe sheds a little. Overall cute.
4.0,I like the band very much. It is much nicer for business wear. The only problem is the finish is started to turn copper colored where it actually attaches to the Alta.
4.0,ABsolutely love the shirt but have learned they need to be sized up because they shrink.
4.0,I love Murakami anything. This is a cute keychain - colors are a bit muted after using for a couple weeks.
4.0,Nice but just need pockets!
4.0,I like the panda design but the headband was too small for my baby when I bought this.  I still keep it cause it was too expensive to return it!
4.0,"These are great for masks. I put them in my masks to allow an exhaling vent. They have helped prevent my glasses from fogging up by proving a release, and the rubber insert seals them so air only flows 1 way. They come with two parts to provide a nice grip and it snaps open so you can remove, replace, or clean the ruber vent seal without removing it entirely."
4.0,"Due to the stretchy fabric, you may want to order one size bigger than your US size.  I bought XL but should have purchased M or L to have a  tighter fit.<br />The material is mesh with no lining except for the crotch area.  You should either wear something to line it or show off your assets."
4.0,"Seems to be good quality. Fit well with a little give. There's a small section of stitching at the neck that seems to be loosening up, but it looks like it's the second line of stitching, so it won't matter if it unravels (I think.)"
4.0,"This is one of the softest shirts that I own! I chose the gray color and I really like the feel of the fabric! the only thing I’m not thrilled about is that the size it’s a little bit smaller than indicated so if you normally wear a medium I would definitely order a large. Other than that, this is a nice shirt!"
4.0,These masks are comfortable and I like the shape and ear loop  design.
4.0,"These look exactly like the picture, but we're too big for my head. I was able to bend the arms in so they will stay on, but the frames are just too big for my face. Good product and they don't feel cheap, but do scratch easily."
4.0,Helps with bracelets but not with necklaces
4.0,Perfect size my son loved them
4.0,Good. Fabric is good. Unable to wear a belt with it.
4.0,I love this shirt so much. It does run small all over but the top of the puff shoulder will not stay up. I think I will sew a couple stitches in there to hold them up. But I love the look!
4.0,"Super cute glasses and of good quality, especially for the price. The frame, however, is smaller than expected, which wasn't a problem for us -- they fit my smaller 6-yo well, though he wasn't the intended recipient -- but if you're looking for a ""large"" frame, just beware that these aren't an average ""large."" Kids' medium would be a more honest description. Otherwise, great bang for your buck. Fun, stylish, and affordable!"
4.0,Love it very beautiful !<br />I’m 5”3 -140lbs<br />The medium was to small and a large is good but needs to be taken in a bit on the side boob area and length. Other then that it’s perfect and beautiful
4.0,"I'm 5'8"" 180 lbs and got a large. The stomach area is a little snug, the arms are good, the legs are way short - they go to my shins. The LEDs are strong enough to be seen at night."
4.0,This was one size smaller than what I needed.  I gave to my cousin and it fit her perfectly as shown in picture
4.0,"I chose this product as a Christmas present from my younger brother via gift card. I love pearls and the colors are gorgeous though in some light the ""blue"" pearls appear green-no biggie for me. The pearls are are big, odd shaped(not perfectally rounf) which I like, and are hefty unlike fake pearls---they are real. It is comfortable to wear---I was expecting to have to ""break"" the necklace in but itthe string is pretty much straight.  The earrings are greasince I am not normally a dangling earring wearer. They are lightweight and nice size.The only thing I really don't like is part of the lobster claw clasp with the hole where you attach it together. It could be made of a sturdier metal"
4.0,"Distorts the vision when I’m under water.  I wonder why...I can see great out of the water. But it keeps the water out of my eyes and doesn’t leave tight ring marks around them, so I’m happy."
4.0,"Update: some of the thick white lining and parts of the straps started to yellow after the first use and have not whitened even after washing it.<br /><br />Very nice quality suit. I'm pear shaped, so I always have issues with one pieces. This actually fits pretty nicely!<br /><br />The cups are a bit big for me, but it doesn't look big. The mid-bottom portion fits very nicely. The overall length feels a TINY bit short, but no big deal.<br /><br />I like this very much and would recommend."
4.0,"Fits much looser than expected. However, it is a beautiful dress and the fabric is very soft."
4.0,"Super soft, comfy and warm... fit slightly smaller than expected.. but be warned... saw these at my local Walmart for $16.99"
4.0,very good material sippers kind of delicated
4.0,"Needs to be bigger, but nice and shiny."
4.0,"Beautiful dress! But it definitely runs quite small. I bought it in a size medium for my daughter who is 5'6, 150 lbs., 37-27-38, and it's waaaaay too small. My other daughter, 5'w, 115 lbs, 35-27-35, can wear the medium, but she doesn't need a sequined dress. So back it goes. The good thing is that it is fully lined and not itchy inside. It's a quality dress, but it runs quite small."
4.0,the lace was too high on my neck line...color is darker than pic.
4.0,"I bought this watch as a gift for a 22 year old son of a friend.  When he opened his gift bag and hit the button on the side to display the time he was impressed.  Heck, I was impressed when I received it.  I had set the watch up for him and it was good to go for him and ready to wear.  It was big for him but I guess you can take it and get a link removed if needed.  Everyone at the party was asking where I got it and of course I hesitated and didn't want to give away my secret but I had to tell them where I bought it.  As a matter of fact, the boy's aunt liked it so much that she went on her Amazon account and placed it on her wish list.  She wants this specific, men's watch for herself.  I honestly have to say that I wasn't thrilled about the instructions... I had to read them several times before I got the jist of it but once I did no problem.  I went ahead and explained to the young man how to set the watch and gave him the instructions to go with it.  It's a nice and sharp watch.  Very sturdy and durable.  I would buy this watch again!"
4.0,These bottles seem to be sturdy and spray well.  Wish they came in a bigger size.
4.0,"I purchased the medium size for my 12 year old son. He has just grown into size 14-16 in youth so I decided to try a medium in this sweatshirt.  It is not a thick cotton sweatshirt, but not a basic long sleeve hoodie either, more of a hybrid of between the two.  The medium is a perfect length for him in the torso but the arms are about 5 inches too long, but they do have the cuffs that stop at his wrists so that stops them unless he purposefully pulls the sleeves down.  He is a short 12 year old and the medium fits him fine with room to grow, I wanted to error on the side of caution and figured he could grow into it if it did not fit.  My son loves it.  This is not amazing quality but he doesn't care and is very happy with it."
4.0,I read the reviews and ordered Large instead of small. Next time I'll order XL.  I recommend ordering 3 sizes larger than you wear.  Price is VERY right and I'm happy with purchase.
4.0,I like these swim shorts. Not to short but not too long
4.0,"These socks fit as expected  beautiful  fun to wear,fell GREAT ON MY FEET AND LEGS"
4.0,Ok so this swim suit is super hot! Absolutely love it!!!<br /> I wear a  36ddd in a regular bra. I bought a size xl in this swim suit. The bottoms fit really well. The top fits pretty good but it is a little bigger than I'd like in the boob area. I have big perky boobs and I like to exsinuate them. A large top probably would be been better for me.<br /> All in all this is a great swim suit.
4.0,Looks lovely on
4.0,Ran way bigger than expected and has been put away for use in future
4.0,"Everything looks really nice as far as fabric quality. The mouth piece - bamboo, ehhhh. A little flat and not round. Looking into a different piece to replace it. Otherwise, I’m satisfied with the merchandise."
4.0,They are very heavy bezels and work up wonderfully. But there wasn’t 64 in the box. I was shorted the cats and that’s the main reason I ordered this set. I’ll still have fun with all the rest.
4.0,The quality is great and the shirt made it to me really quickly. The only concern is the sleeves are super long!! Like 5 inches too long. So you have to hem them or be prepared to wear the shirt cuffed all the time.
4.0,These glass cases protect my glasses well.  They're well made and have a great price at under $5 for 2 on Amazon.
4.0,"I really like this suite. However the sizing is tricky. I usually wear a L and ordered an XL because of the U.S. Sizes on the side. The bottoms fit but the top is loose. I am 5'4 pretty athletic 170lbs and usually wear a 34-36 C. It looks good even tho the top is loose. I ordered it for pool work outs and love the racer back style of the top. I think the top may shrink a little if you wash it in hot water and dry it. I would order your regular size according to the S, M, L, and XL if you want the top to fit you well. Hope this helps."
4.0,4 stars. Its a good pair of sunglasses but lacks quality. You received what you pay for.
4.0,Pants were huge! But the hoodie fits perfectly! Pants don't have pockets... but very well made!
4.0,Size was just perfect and quality is outstanding.
4.0,The bird doesn't quite hang down as it does in the picture but it is still really cute. I love this necklace.
4.0,The product was great quality but it did not fit the watch described in the description so I had to return it. I had no issue with the return.
4.0,"I liked that the shoe is comfortable, it’s easy slip on and off. The heel height is about 2 inches. I’m a size 7. The shoe ran little large. Size down"
4.0,"Gloves fit me fine, but if you have large hands they likely wouldn’t. They’re sort of small"
4.0,"I agree with another reviewer on here, If you are taller, I wouldn't recommend this. (over 5'8, your stomach or undershirt will show)<br />The transfer seems pretty legit, just like the picture, the hoody is soft, will keep him warm. Like with any transfer, wash INSIDE out and hang dry.<br />He will love this for Xmas, We are a Huge Ford Mustang Family."
4.0,Presents wonderfully.  Hard to close.  Lost a few of the feathers when is first opened it up.  Can't wait to use it around others.  They will be so envious.
4.0,Nice festive bracelet for a great price!
4.0,"Glad that I picked this one out. I wanted a shirt that didn't force me to pick ONE member :) because I love them all! Fits about as expected (I ordered an extra large because I was worried it would be small, but it's a bit big - probably could have ordered my normal size or maybe ONE size up and been fine). Either way, happy with my purchase."
4.0,very nice fabric soft comfortable
4.0,"I bought two white button ups for work off Amazon and out of the two, this one fit me perfectly. I did do what most reviews suggested which is choose a size up. I am 5'2, 128lbs and wear a small B cup. I usually wear petite small, or even X-small but ordered a medium just in case. I consider this a perfect work shirt. It is a nice stretchy material that is very comfortable and breathes. Flattering, but not unprofessional. The gold buttons really do the trick. I could do without the ruffles on the sleeves, (hence the 4 stars) but my blazer covers them up. I highly recommend."
4.0,Love the print and quality. It’s a bit thick for my days in the Caribbean where I live. Better on a cool evening. But the print and quality are excellent. Washed well too.. I’ve used and washed it a few times now.<br />I recommend it.
4.0,Cute shirt.  Like the color.
4.0,Good leather and stitching.  Make then in 1.25 or 1.33 also
4.0,"It is a nice hat, just a little bigger than I expected but really nice overall!"
4.0,"Love this. Very classy for work.  I only wish the material was less prone to wrinkle, but other than that, I love it!"
4.0,"Looks nicer than pictured. I wore it on a very hoy, humid day and I thought it would be nice if it had more of a cotton blend. But I was very happy."
4.0,Its really a very pretty blouse but way too small and see through! Well worth the price if it only fit!
4.0,"I do like pendants - they tend to go with a wide variety of items and honestly, they typically look flattering on everyone.<br /><br />This pendant is a perfect size, as it's large enough to stand out but not so large that I feel like it would overwhelm me. The stone is a nice blue color and is striking. I would say that this is more of a casual necklace than a formal one, although you could pair it with some dressy casual items depending on what they were.<br /><br />The chain is what pulled this down a star. It's not awful, as the chain was long enough so that it comfortably rested around my neck without it being too tight or too loose. Where it got frustrating was the S hook. One side had a large ring and initially I thought that was the side that should be latched and unlatched, however it was the other side that was meant to do this - the plain chain. This made it a little difficult to get on and off by myself, but not impossible. You could swap it out with another chain fairly easily if you have a lot of trouble, so it's not a huge deal breaker."
4.0,The how they light weight and the fit! Especially love the flexibility of the eye glass frames.  2.5 Strength of the glasses seem like the are not as strong as my other 2.5 Strength glasses.
4.0,"Now this is the way to keep receipts, coupons, cards and cash from getting lost at the bottom of a handbag. That it sports protection from sleazy scammers trying to pull info from credit card magnetic strips is genius. I would have rated it 5-star worthy had a leather option been available."
4.0,"Like all the other reviews have said, the bag is such a fun design. It can fit quite a lot - my daily commute includes a large book, 1-2 pouches with makeup, lotions, and medicines, wallet, and a 17oz S’well. Inside has three pockets - two open on the front, and one zipped on the back. The zipped pocket is a bit messed up - it seems to open upside down....so the spacious area of it tries to let its contents defy gravity, but it doesn’t quite work that way.<br /><br />Other than the pocket, though, it’s a pretty solid backpack."
4.0,My ears.
4.0,"I'm 5'9"", 141 lbs, and have a small chest.  I received a medium size tank blouse for review and it fits me nicely.  I like that the arm holes are large enough to not pinch my underarms, but aren't big and gaping either - just right.  The neck is not too low and the hem comes down to my hips.  The material is nice and crepe-like feeling and the deep green is a beautiful color.  I washed and dried it in the dryer before even trying on and it came out of the dryer looking just like new.  I like this blouse a lot, but it's not one of my favorites though I will be wearing it when the weather turns warm.  I think it's very well made and will look great with skirts, jeans, shorts or whatever.  It's nice enough to be worn to more formal occasions - baby showers, retirement parties, church, etc....."
4.0,They are adequate to the task but a little flimsy.
4.0,"This bra is mostly comfortable, but it rolls up in the front when I reach up. It's not a massive deal, but I can definitely feel that it's bunched up a bit initially. After a while I can ignore it, but once periodically through the day it will bother me a bit. Otherwise the bra is nice. It's size is true, the material is soft and comfortable, the straps are a good fit. I'd rate it a 3.5 out of 5."
4.0,A few too many inserts.
4.0,It’s a nice sun visor. I have a small head. It doesn’t fit me as well as I would like. I’m keeping it taking a trip to Florida soon. Don’t want to regret not having it💐
4.0,Fit as expected. Simple but cute!
4.0,"Designs are pretty, but these are not breathable."
4.0,The hat is great at blocking out the sun.  The strap broke and the same thing happened on a different color I ordered.  It fits very tightly on my head. But I wear &#34;enhancements&#34;  on my head so that has something to do with it.  The material is sturdy.<br /><br />I would  recommend this product and purchase another color.
4.0,"Bigger than I usually buy, but a nice well made bag."
4.0,"Very cute top. I got a few of these for work. Its lightweight, but not see-through. I got the large (my usual size) and it  fits a bit loose, length drops to mid-thigh (I'm 5'2&#34;). I wouldn't recommend buying this in a tight fitting size as it may look cheap, since the pattern and fabric look thin when stretched. Four stars because of the price. The quality is really good for this price."
4.0,Good Quality watch
4.0,Nice design on this T. Ordered XL & size fit good except sleeves could be a bit longer.
4.0,It was a little bigger than I thought. But overall a very cool product. Thanks again may put it on a chain
4.0,"Decent top hat for a halloween costume. NOT high quality, but will do great for a night or two.<br />If you're looking for something more substantial to last for a few uses - i would look elsewhere."
4.0,I bought this bracelet for my soon-to-be 7 year old daughter’s birthday. I was a little hesitant since it came with the “granddaughter” charm but I knew my daughter would love it and I resigned myself to just prying the charm off before her birthday. Thankfully when I received the bracelet I saw that the charm had its own clasp and was extremely easy to remove!
4.0,"Bought this, an aurora dress, and tiara from Amazon. Paid maybe $10 more than what is at local stores, but would have had to drive all around the place finding matching sets. Good quality lasted Halloween night and gets played with during the week as well. Still holding up in December now."
4.0,This shirt was is so soft and the it is very flattering on. I love the small tie detail at the neck. It was a little sung across my chest but overall a great shirt. Something probably worth knowing is the buttons are not functional. I was anticipating they would be so just thought I would share.
4.0,Cute but the backs aren't attached to anything.
4.0,These were some Christmas gifts. Happy with the product and the service.
4.0,"Arrived as promised. Stretchy fabric makes the comfort level good. Initially a tight stretch over the head to my neck (5' 10"" / 175 lbs) but wasn't disturbingly tight. It does keep you warm. Hat was an easy fit and warm as well. Good for the money."
4.0,"strap is okay, could be just a tad longer would be great"
4.0,The calf is really large. Definitely not for girls with skinny legs.
4.0,"I got this for my boyfriend for his bday. He usually wears an XL in Old Navy shirts, so I ordered an XL and was shocked how big it was. Id order a size down. I tried to shrink this shirt in the wash, it did not shrink."
4.0,Gave as a gift and he adores it.
4.0,"Cute capris and fit really well.  The only downside is due to a personal phobia.  I didn't realize how prevalent the snake was on the print and I really don't like snakes.  But the colors in the print are so vibrant and fun that I can make myself &#34;overlook&#34; the snake in the print.  The material used is a really nice weight, so no problem with seeing through it while you are in various yoga or Pure Barre positions, and they have a nice degree of compression for good support."
4.0,Runs Narrow.
4.0,"I absolutely love this jacket!  I bought a size large and it does fit, but a part of me wishes I would have bought the XL. Only because it seems tight when I have my arms forward, like it gets tight, but the XL probably would have been the same way, but I love this jacket. I have had heads turn several times towards me and it just screams badass."
4.0,"I use these sunglasses to ride my bike and could not be happier. It keeps the wind and sweat out of my eyes, they fit and they do well with the sun without being too dark when it gets cloudy or overcast. The only reason it is not 5 stars it is because they do feel like they are made out of cheap plastic, but I cant complain for the price."
4.0,Wore them twice overall this summer … buttons are ok.. but I felt maybe I was rough with them that the button now felt like loose … and like I like these but wish it’s a zipper not a whole lot of buttons .. I don’t mind it plus it have a semi tummy tuck for me …
4.0,I bought this for my husband for Father's Day. He has been using it for work and highly enjoys it. He sent me a picture of all of his small tools kept nicely together and organized.
4.0,"I really liked this band. After a while the black started to rub off in areas, mainly where my hand rest on the deck when typing on a keyboard."
4.0,A little loose for my taste.
4.0,"I really love the bangle. It is heavy but it is really small. I have small hands and wrists and I had to oil my hand to get it on, but once on it fits my wrist perfectly. I just won't take it off anytime soon. lol."
4.0,"good price,fast shipping."
4.0,Got these for after surgery but will definitely wear them long after! Cute and comfy! They got softer after washing but be sure to dry on low or line dry then fluff as the piping shrinks and gets tighter.
4.0,Fits big stretchy material
4.0,"It doesnt really have seams.. the edges are just... ragged edges.  It can't be mistaken for a regular sleeveless shirt.  My kid loves it, so there's that, but it could stand to look a bit more normal.  It won't last long, I can tell by looking at it."
4.0,"This shirt is actually super nice quality for a tee from China.  Not a traditional cotton tee, but it is stretchy and looks very good."
4.0,"I would have given this 5 stars, if not for the fact that it runs small.  Lovely and light weight though!"
4.0,These were perfect for my daughter's project where she dressed up as Queen Elizabeth.
4.0,"I bought this for my brother, age 35 and he loves it. He said the sound quality was surprisingly good and he loves that his head is warm and his hands are free. Can't beat the price for such a great and usable gift."
4.0,"Pretty necklace, excellent price"
4.0,Great shirt but I feel like the wrist hole is too big. Otherwise fits perfect.
4.0,size down 2 sizes was extremely large. The fabric is breathable and soft nice quality knly complaint was that the sizing was confusing
4.0,"This is a great top! Super cute and comfy but I think it runs a little smaller then what I was anticipating. Other then that,<br />Great."
4.0,"It’s nice even though it ‘s stretch, I expect other thing but it’s really nice😎😎😎😎"
4.0,Tiene  un excelente diseño de fabricacion. Debe mejorar en  el sitema de cierre de la manila que es muy sencillo y fragil.
4.0,"My son loves these socks, they are a bit longer than I thought hey would be as they go over his knees and he is really tall for his age.  He likes them though and they fit well under his ski boot."
4.0,Less than 1”
4.0,I received my hijab today and it's beautiful! The blue is as vivid as the picture. I am pleased with this purchase
4.0,"You can dress this one up or down, everyone.  It’s lovely.  I bought mine to use in upcoming family photos!  The pink isn’t see through, but dark undergarments will show, so be aware of that and plan accordingly."
4.0,"A few years ago I got these sleeves for myself size l/xl. My wife really like them, so I ordered her these ones size s/m. When I received them they were actually longer than mine. Why are the s/m longer than the l/xl? These seem a little big, but she still likes them. These new ones are also a little thinner, which can feel a little better on hot days. Overall they are still really good at protecting the sun on your arms."
4.0,I like the cardigan. Was a little snug in the shoulder but other than that it fit's nicely.
4.0,Really good deal. I will most likely purchase again.
4.0,Especial para trabajo
4.0,"Many aspects I love about this style for holding my glasses.  What I don’t like is wrangling them up from hanging around my neck, over my ears, back onto my face has resulted in lost earrings!  My solution is, I stopped wearing earrings.  If I go somewhere I want to wear earrings, I have to switch to different style of glasses holder.  Really a bummer because I really like how these hang closer to my face rather than dangling down my chest.  The very first time I wore them, I lost a very expensive 14k gold & pearl earring."
4.0,I have ordered before from KONOV jewelry...i receive the merchandise rather quickly...the quality is beautiful.  The only reason i gave this item 4 stars is that the the circle that the lobster clamp gets attached to was very small & hard to attach.<br />Besides that I will continue to order from KONOV
4.0,"Exactly what I was searching for--an acrylic display set sized larger than the standard sets of 3&#34;, 4&#34; and 5&#34; so I can display hats on them.  The larger size makes them more versatile and provides increased height."
4.0,Great fit.  Soft and fits my large wrist
4.0,Cute for my nieces and I in our trip to the zoo
4.0,No adult sizes
4.0,"So far, so good. I've only used them a few times, but they seem to cut down on moisture and odors."
4.0,"The headbands are fine but there was a lot of threads and fabric chaff on them when I opened the package.  After washing, they are great.  Very absorbent, comfortable, and so far they come back to the original shape after washing.  Great value."
4.0,Very pleased with the army ring.  It was a gift for my husband and he liked the weight and feel of it.  Would recommend.
4.0,"At my height of 5'3"" this dress was longer than I was expecting. On the model, it comes to her mid-thigh or at least above her knees. On me it came much lower which is not the look I was going for. On the plus side, compared to other dresses like this sold by other sellers, this neckline is much lower and in my opinion more flattering instead of ending higher at a awkward mid decolletage spot. Fabric was nice. Just wished they made a shorter version. I would definitely buy that."
4.0,Love the material! More of a boxy shape and loose fitting because I ordered a size up. Hits right above my knee.
4.0,Gater is very breathable and it doesn’t get hot what so ever I have a big head and found it to be not to loose or snug I will say that the items definitely need a wash prior to use because it has a funk to it. After I washed them by hand they were good to go
4.0,"I listened to the other reviews and sized up and this thing is huge on me. I should have just gone with my normal size medium. Truthfully this is a tall woman's dress, at 5'2"" it was way too long in legnth and in the torso. The print was a bit louder than I expected and the dress wore me rather than me wearing the dress. The fabric was thin but flowey and not see through, it was super staticy though. And had enough static cling to grab onto me in the most unflattering ways."
4.0,The colors are beautiful. It’s light weight. My 2 year old loves it
4.0,It fit very nice
4.0,My son gave this to his daughter
4.0,"Husband ordered this as a nice, extra scarf as a gift for his dad. It's a very sheer, but soft cashmere material. The nice, navy blue color pairs nicely with any color jacket. We loved how soft and how warm it was!"
4.0,Bought these for my wife she is a nurse an she love them
4.0,The fabric is very light and it's see through but overall the blouse fit perfectly and it's cute.I wear a USA Small but I order a medium and it fit me perfect.
4.0,I love this. It does irratate my ear if I wear it too long.
4.0,I use this when i go on vacation. I used it last week while on a cruise and on shore in St. Thomas and other places. I like this just for my cards and Driver license. I did not have to carry a wallet.
4.0,"I loved the St. Patrick's Day pattern on this dress. The fit is good. The material is a little thin, but this is a fun dress for the occasion."
4.0,"A nice full skirt, band is not too tight around waist a little looser than I thought. Overall I'm satisfied"
4.0,Just completed as they have mentioned.
4.0,Good shoes (I ordered the wrong size) but so over priced. Try $30 and maybe I'd buy them again in the right size.
4.0,"Runs small, I'm a US 5,6 and pants is a US 33-34. , so I got the XL knowing it runs small. Pants didn't fit, through the rest did, still felt on the tight side sense it limited my arm movement , though if it was an XXL it would have fitted a whole lot better.<br />, hopefully this helps. But the shipping speed in my area was very fast for a last minute cosplay inspiration."
4.0,"Nice color and style.  It's a little thin, but it's a costume wig so it's what I expected.  Worked great for my Snow Queen costume."
4.0,THE PACKAGING WAS POOR
4.0,Package came quickly and on time. It was pretty cute and such but I domt suggest wearing for long periods of time as it tarnishes very quickly.
4.0,"Super cute dress (even though a friend suggested I looked more like a milkmaid than a bride) but at 5'9"" it was too short for my long legs :("
4.0,Fun socks.  Great for yoga.  Thin enough to wear in shoes too.
4.0,"Really cute shirt, but very clingy and thin. The fabric is so soft. If it had been offered in a bigger size, I would definitely keep it."
4.0,"Maybe I have a large face or head but the se glasses just have smaller lenses than what I'm used too. Very far from oversized and smaller than your average sunglasses for sure. The quality is great. It even comes with a little keychain screw adjustor to fix the glasses to your linking and the ouch they come in is nice too. They'll absolutely last a while but I might have to hand them off to someone with a smaller face or maybe a kid, because they do fit but they are just too small in the lens for me to love them"
4.0,colors are very accurate and it’s cute.. but if this were a little larger or the strings were a bit longer it would hold more.
4.0,"It's a beautiful dress, but be careful when ironing. The material feels a bit rough and plasticy which makes it very easy to burn the dress. Also, Missmay needs to come up with different color options. It's usually blue or red."
4.0,"It’s very cute , just came shorter than what the picture shows, as well as the color"
4.0,"These are excellent earrings for the price. They are better than earrings you’d find at Charming Charlie because they are sturdier and better quality. I would definitely buy again, maybe in different colors."
4.0,"It's small for a one size fits all, maybe for children. My daughter is a size 4-6 and there wasn't much room. She had just lost 20lbs so it fit well."
4.0,"They fit nice and are comfortable. I love the style, but the material looks really cheap (which one should expect, I guess, from the cost). I have average sized calves and they are roomy enough to wear over skinny jeans. Overall, I'm happy with them for the money I spent and hope to get at least one year out of them."
4.0,Fast shipping great gift for granddaughter
4.0,The touch screens a little finicky and takes some getting used too at first trying to hit just right.<br />I use it for cycling and I would still wear a thin pair of something else under them. Though there definitely warm and for me personally would be good alone down to the low 20's or so depending on how long I'd be going out.<br />There overall super comfortable and the inner layer leaves a gap to trap air for the insolation. And having wipped out in a foot of snow and mud they definitely hold up to the water resistant claims.
4.0,"my daughter likes to wear them under dresses. they are thin tho, so not to be worn on their own as shorts."
4.0,"Nice hat, is darker than the picture makes it out to be. Could be a lil bigger. Does not fit my big head as good as I would like it to."
4.0,"Very pretty scarf.  Long enough to be a shawl  or wr around neck as a muffler or wrap around waist as a belt.<br />The fabric is sheer chiffon slightly sheer if used as a wrap,but very nice"
4.0,FITS BEAUTIFUL 18 YEAR OLD WEARING IT. EVERY THING LOOKS BEAUTIFUL ON HER.
4.0,"I ordered 3 different colors. The first one is perfect and as expected but the second one, the striped dress is a totally different material that has no stretch (returned it), now I am waiting for the third... I pray it is the right material because these are comfy and cute if it is the correct flowy material.<br /><br />UPDATE-<br />Received the all black and it is perfect. Good material, great fit and comfy.<br /><br />2nd UPDATE-<br />The tie dye came and the material and fit is awesome."
4.0,"These run a little small. They still work for my size 9 feet and stay hidden in my shoes, but they're a little bit tighter than I'd like."
4.0,Had a slight problem but the seller is great and very communicative. Would recommend.
4.0,"Los lentes son hermosos, pero la visión es muy oscura es lo único que puedo ver negativo como consumidor."
4.0,"My son loved the costume and accessories it came with. Cheap, thin material though. Worked perfectly with clothes worn underneath to trick or treat on a cold evening."
4.0,"Love this passport holder, but wish it was a little bit shorter.  It was too large to fit in the outside pocket of my backpack.  Other than that I've thouroghly enjoyed using this passport holder."
4.0,"Happy to get Thai jersey for my grandson. The material wrinkles very easily. Otherwise, happy with it."
4.0,"The quality of these tops for the price is very good.  The top was nice for the cooler and warmer temps is outside playing in the field.  Definitely would suggest buying a size up for movement playing, it did run smaller than I would typically like to wear."
4.0,FIT WELL DO FIT BODY SHAPE RECOMMEND ONE SIZE BIGGER
4.0,"I did buy this for a new set I recently made that was pretty large. All the pieces do fit, but I note the quality of the material is pretty thin and may wear down in time. I may end up having to make my own bag from leather in the future for durability."
4.0,"Fabric is great, just be careful wearing in, can snag easily. Great quality and fits true to size. Love the cold shoulder."
4.0,it is a pretty top. well made but not long.  this top will not cover your belly.  it might cover your belly if you are under 5'2''.
4.0,"These chokers were super cute and the packaging was amazing! All of them were great fits and I fell in love with them, they were super stylish. The price for these were pretty cheap for all of these chokers. Each of the 6 were carefully wrapped to prevent tangles, and placed inside a cute bag, However, these are definitely super thin and fragile, I tried one on for the first time and when I tried to take it off it broke, and I had only received the chokers 10 mins ago. I did end up fixing it after 30 mins, if they were more sturdy these chokers would be perfect"
4.0,"Very comfortable, flowy, flattering, & cute. I love this material (mostly rayon w/a little spandex), because it feels like cotton. The shoulder seam came out after the 1st wear, but my Friend fixed it on her sewing machine, so it's all good."
4.0,"I have really enjoyed having this band for my Fitbit. I purchased it in July 2022 and have worn it many times. I had compliments every time I wore it. I wouldn't recommend sleeping with this band on as you will end up with imprints of each bead in your skin if you have pressure on it.<br />It has held up well, until I caught one of the elastic strings of beads on a bracelet I had on my other arm and the elastic snapped (sending 19 beads flying everywhere).<br />All said, I do not regret purchasing this band and will likely purchase a new one."
4.0,I like these shoes but they do not fit my son's feet the right way.. They are too wide and fall right off his feet even with both straps fastened. My son wears either a 6 or 6.5 toddler... We almost lost a shoe shopping the other day.. It just slipped right off.
4.0,"I ordered one size up and it fit as expected, a little looser than my regular size would be.... Which is what I wanted. Not the softest material but doesn't cling."
4.0,I don't like the band but the watch is okay.
4.0,"I find these comfortable and easy to wear. Unfortunately, my puppy has put a hole in one pair. He thinks he needs to help me get dressed after my shower. And it was the pink pair!"
4.0,Very soft and pretty. I do think it is a little overpriced though.
4.0,Even on the extra small the legs were way too long my wife normally wears a small to medium
4.0,"For $20 it's pretty much what I'd expected.  Holds my phone, keys, cash, lipstick and misc items.  Quality is fine, again, for a $20 item.  Great little wristlet that can fit easily in another handbag or briefcase, too."
4.0,"First and foremost I enjoy being able to purchase a color pack where I can for a reasonable price have a color variety without breaking the bank. The seven pack started out as exciting especially with the idea of micro cotton as the material as it is typically cool and comfortable. The material is very nice, soft almost like a microfiber, or micro-silk, but not quite. The fit is close, the strap is wide and comfortable, the side straps are equally wide and comfortable. The cotton has a lot of give and stretch, but still retains its shape during all day wear and through a multitude of actions and motions. There is plenty of thong strap and connects nicely to the pouch. The pouch is roomy to say the least. But roominess can go to far and this is where this almost fantastic thong has gone astray. Now, if you are VERY well endowed then this thong will work wonders, but unless you are packing quite the equipment, the pouch will offer little to no support; especially during exercise. When purchasing I did not look at the pouch as I assumed this would be a cotton version of another thong made by this company where you are well supported but given amble room for expansion when needed. Alas I was wrong and the pouch is just large and roomy, when can come in handy in certain situations, but rarely for all day wear... unless you work for Vivid or Kink."
4.0,It is a beautiful and very comfortable ring.  I gave it 4 stars because it looks like a mans ring not a woman's.
4.0,"I received this item at a discount for an honest and unbiased review.  I had read the reviews that the shirt ran small, so I ordered the next size up.  I normally wear a size large in shirts, and I ordered the XL.  If you want it loose then order two sizes bigger.  It is quite comfy though and washed well.  I hung it to dry and no need to iron.  I love that it is casual, yet I can also dress it up if I need to."
4.0,Really hard but overall nice
4.0,It's a nice little unitard that fits well and good quality. Easy to care for. So far no complaints.
4.0,5’7” 140lbs. I ordered a small and I like how it fits. The straps are adjustable for a better fit depending on your torso length.
4.0,Overall I really liked this necklace it was very Beautiful but it wasn’t what I expected the packaging it very pretty but the necklace wasn’t that big.
4.0,Hey they are neat little things to sport in your car or bedroom.
4.0,They cause my ears to burn occasionally since my ears are sensitive but are pretty and good quantity for your money
4.0,lovely hat given as a gift
4.0,These are cute and my 7 year old loves them but the size is really large for a child or adults ear. Overall a good price and pretty.
4.0,They fit well and are comfortable but it doesn’t look like the picture for the fit. You need a long shirt to cover the Crotch area due to the fabric not being smooth. Good to wear around the house.
4.0,"Bought this as a present for a friend, and she really likes it.  The beanie's kind of small and somewhat tight though, so expect to have flattened hair.<br /><br />Because of the packaging the pom poms aren't as fluffy as they appear in the picture, but it got close when I tried ruffling the yarn myself."
4.0,Got for my nephew
4.0,Fits perfectly with my glasses and looks nice! Love't
4.0,"Thom's wife's review:  I bought this to go under my sundresses.  We live in southern FL.  The coobie is decently comfortable for 1/2 day but for anything over 4 hours, it begins to become uncomfortable, as any strapless style bra does.  I was a bit disappointed in the discomfort midday.  The benefits of this coobie bra are lightweight--so less hot to wear, strapless and the beige color is not noticeable under clothing.  The downsides are, not much support, discomfort for all day wear and thin so doesn't conceal every detail of the breasts."
4.0,"Seams were not matched up, so the pattern is off."
4.0,"It is cute, but fits a bit tight for me."
4.0,"I really like this romper, but its not the best for big breasted women. I'm a 34D and it doesn't support the girls. I don't like wearing a bra with it either because of the open back. Otherwise its adorable, just not fit for my body type =/"
4.0,I did go up one size A nice shirt for bikeing
4.0,It was the perfect size not to big not to small. It was great
4.0,Awesome mask but very tough to breath in as other reviewers have stated.  I ended up using it on a static prop.  Could have easily cut the mouth to make breathing easier.  Very detailed/realistic.
4.0,"Love the durability and look!  Think if there was a slight curve to keep it a little more comfy in the back pocket.  I don't think that would be an issue for all the cards I keep in it.  I didn't go through the break in period and was able to squeeze 10 cards and cash.  A week later there wasn't the struggle of trying to get the button latched.  I'm pretty sure the oils naturally occur on hands will preserve the beautiful leather for many years!<br />Overall, I am happy with this purchase.  I am a back pocket wallet carrier so the comfort ability is my only gripe.  Satisfied customer and will recommend and gift this cool innovative wallet!"
4.0,"They are a little small, tight fitting and the lenses are blue"
4.0,"I like it!<br />The heavy bronze feels good.<br />This was a 19th anniversary gift.<br /><br />Clasp is does not patina like the case is...?<br /><br />the distressed strap has yet to grow on me.. very nice leather, feels very nice!"
4.0,"Just received the item today, very cute but seems cheaply made like it could break easy. The balls don’t seem super secure on the ring. Also depending on where you are wearing this, the internally threaded aspect can make it difficult to screw the ball on like it was for my daith piercing. I am satisfied for the price, I liked the size of the ring for my piercing since I don’t like big rings in this one."
4.0,"Not super comfy, but love the flip up. I'm not constantly looking for where I set done my readers. Also you'll get no style points when wearing them in up position. Function over form."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:f0612baccb26788193200adb04621828]] I honestly like the headband, but the downside is , it slips off and in other places really easily no matter how tight you secure the head band. Also, the Nike sign lifts especially when I go it, so I don’t wear it , maybe to take a picture or to hold my hair in a specific style like the video, but other than that it is not being worn."
4.0,sent back for it was a little big and didn't think the med. would fit
4.0,Quality is great. I’m 5’4 135 34D got a medium and it fit. It would have been 5 stars if it were wider at the neck to make it a true off the shoulder. It’s more boat neck. I’m keeping because it’s a great quality sweater. I have the pink it it’s a nice color. Not cotton candy bright. It’s more of a dusty rosy salmon.
4.0,I don't like so mucht the colour
4.0,Very unique piece!
4.0,Love it but broke after one hour of wearing it :(
4.0,"Totally worth the money, I bought size 4x since I got used to the modern ratio that 4x really means L  but  this poncho really means 4x  tall large man size.<br />The color is truly black ad it's thick, soft and really keeps all the cold away and especially living by the sea . Its also very long  and wide and didn't need to use a blanket most spring nights. Only thing I didn't give it a perfect 5 star score because one of the buttons was not very well sowed in and totally fell out when i slipped it on but other than that tiny error, it's totally worth the cash !."
4.0,The blouse is of more fitted fit than usual. The material is with a little stretch. Like the embroidery.
4.0,this dress is beautiful but a bit thin material
4.0,"Great product. Very comfortable. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because they don't exactly stay above the knee, they end up right under the knee after some walking. Other than that, they're great! I bought 4 pair!"
4.0,"other reviewers said it was weird shiny fabric. I didn't understand until I got the item. It's not weird or really shiny to me, it's just not cotton T-shirt type material, but more of a spandex with rayon spandex material, almost like a dry fit sport shirt. I think it's actually better since it won't shrink and it's a little bit stretchy. I like the material and the pattern. I am 5'4, 128 pounds small chested. I normally wear juniors small. I ordered small and this had plenty of room. I think it's true to size. sleeves definitely had enough room in them. Overall I like it."
4.0,I got it as a gift. Good material. He loved it.
4.0,"Decent gloves. Look nice, they aren’t super thing but not thick by any means. Good driving gloves for cooler days but likely not sufficient for very very cold weather or extended periods of time outside in snowy weather. Overall good for errands and quick walks, in and out of the car, etc, or as a base layer under very heavy ski gloves.<br /><br />One thing to note, the grip “dots” on the gloves only cover the first couple of fingers and thumb so when driving you’ll notice a little slippage on the outside of your palm if that makes sense. You’ll end up wanting to have the inside palm and fingers on the wheel most of the time as a result. Not a big deal for me unless I’m cranking the wheel when making turns."
4.0,"I followed others recommendation of going up at least 2 sizes, fits me big!! Originally ordered 2xL, I am 5’5”, 140lbs and it’s quite loose. I will order a large and probably gift the 2xL to someone since shipping is likely to be more expensive than just ordering a new size."
4.0,Very nice for the price.  Wasn't expecting them to be of great quality.
4.0,It's nice. The string is stretching though so I know it won't last more than a few months.
4.0,"Beautiful necklace.  Lots of sparkle and shine in Spring/Summer colors.  Came with a nice snake chain.  A little bigger than I expected, about 1 1/2 inches long.  Bought as a gift, but it was too big a pendant for the petite recipient, so I kept it for myself and bought her something smaller.  Oh, darn, now I have to wear it  :-)"
4.0,"Fit was great! The black material is a smooth, dense cotton-like weave that has matte appearance. Mine seemed to have been starched & ironed seconds before being folded, packaged, and stacked under a box of anchors.  An insistent ironing went a long way!<br /><br />It's marked dry clean only, so I've only worn it once, but I was happy"
4.0,BEAUTIFUL - broke it first day - recipient is a bit rough salvaged one strand!
4.0,"Its beautiful, sturdy and holds alot. It has alot of hooks so you can fold the really long necklaces twice and hang them"
4.0,"Vibrant color as showed in picture. Fits nicely, pretty much as expected. Material feels comfortable and soft."
4.0,"Fit is so flattering and the swimsuit is gorgeous but the design specifically in the crotch area was a deal breaker.  See my photo, the leaf placement and how the leaf design points up is exactly on the &#34;private part&#34; makes it very weird! I ended up returning it. Even my husband noticed when I put it on and said something about my crotch without me asking. Kinda comical. :) The top of the swimsuit looks so beautiful too so I was bummed!"
4.0,"Overall I like these pajamas very much.  They are very soft and comfortable.  They fit well, my only complaint is that even though a medium is supposed to be may breast size, the material gaps a bit between the buttons (nothing a pin can't help as I wear these for lounging not sleeping)."
4.0,Overall he likes them. He said they could use some more cushioning as they are not comfortable if you're standing for some time.
4.0,Cute little shoe. Perfect with our Sofia costume.
4.0,"They're cute and fairly comfortable. I kind of thought they were the &#34;mermaid&#34; style that you can move back and forth. I was hoping my ADHD child could wear them to school and have something to fiddle with (quietly), but they're not like that. However, all of us girls have worn one or more at a time, just as costume jewelry."
4.0,I didnt like how it gets together it doesn't hace a hinch. It could get lose anytime
4.0,It’s a great fitting dress. The color is a little lighter than it appears
4.0,I love this ring- it can be worn daily dressed up or down and guaranteed you will get several compliments- I could not give it a 5 because one of the stone fell out very quickly.
4.0,super cute!  we ended up using more like slippers for the house but they were worth it!  surprisingly well made and easy to get on and off his little baby feet :)
4.0,Lovely  dress
4.0,Only reason why this doesnt get 5 stars is because it's not JJ perfection brand but it looks great and fits well!
4.0,Loved the first order had to order them again.. Great quality.
4.0,I like these alot.  I like being able to just put on/take off my watch without having to phutz with a buckle or whatever.  And they are comfy.
4.0,I bought this for my two-year-old 3 weeks granddaughter and it's just a little big
4.0,"El talle es 7, no 7.5 como creo, ya que decía 7/8"
4.0,Everything was okay except the beard lmao!! Laughing too hard still!!
4.0,Decent glasses for the price but they scratch really easily.  Surprisingly they actually are polarized.
4.0,"I bought a New York apron which evidently is no longer available from this seller. One reason I bought it was that it had a pocket. Well, NO POCKET, but I'm keeping it anyway. Just sorry it wasn't as advertised."
4.0,"Fits good. They might be snug on a real chunky baby’s feet, especially after they’re washed and dried, but they fit my baby pretty well. He’s got skinny narrow feet. Overall they’re very nice."
4.0,Adorable but way to long for my average height 6 year old. I got a size 6 but it fits like an 8.
4.0,I love the material and cut of these pants but they run large. If you watch video a different reviewer posted you will see that she keeps pulling them up even though they seemed to fit her perfectly. I thought if I got a larger size they would not slide down from being too tight like stretch pants can but they still slide down.
4.0,I love the lighting and I use it for a night light because am afraid of the dark.
4.0,Silky feel but made small. Wish I’d gone up a size. Worth the price
4.0,"Good earrings, reasonably priced and delivered within the Amzn Prime 2day window. Only draw back is the clasp design could be stronger  and more secure."
4.0,"this is a nice light weight, comfy colotte for spring and summer. travels well, doesn't wrinkle. lightweight. cool.<br /><br />just wish it had pockets.<br /><br />i will say after a couple of seasons wear i have had to do some repairs on the waistband: elastic back is coming unstitched from the front piece."
4.0,"A little large for my small wrist, but beautiful bracelet, and nice quality with an affordable price tag."
4.0,"l love the dress , my daughter is 5 but l order size 3 and it fit her great . l will definitely buy again if needed  ."
4.0,"Liked softness. Medium fit alittle big..I am 5'7"" . These are short."
4.0,Pretty creepy! Wish it had a better shape but assuming it'll get there over time...maybe stuff tissue in it when not being worn? Pics of a 10 yr old wearing so works for kids too ...sort of
4.0,It is of good value and as described. Keeps warm in those cold days.
4.0,"The band at the top of sock by my knees gets uncomfortable at the end of the day. However, they keep their shape all day and work."
4.0,I ordered (simultaneously) several different leg warmers from different companies.  These were by far the highest in warmth and quality of all of those I ordered.
4.0,"I recently ordered this dress and it was to small, the colors was vibrant and I love the material, so I originally wanted to send it back and I was told that I would have to send it back to the vendor, or keep the dress and bless someone else with it and only receive a 20% back return, well after really not being satisfied with the options I just said forget it, but then I received an email that advised that they were going to adjust the size and would send me out a new dress for no cost, I received the new dress in a 3XL and it fits, I would say they adjusted the size of the 3XL to maybe at 2XL, I will keep the dress because the fabric gives and it's very bright and pretty and I can wear a girdle.  I love the part that they tried to make me happy and customer satisfaction is a must for them and that makes me a happy customer."
4.0,"I like it. It's small enough to fit neatly in a purse, but large enough to carry in your hand by itself."
4.0,Super cute top. Lightweight but not see through which is nice. Simple and one of those you can dress up or down easily. It also washes nice. I didnt have to iron it after hang drying which is always a plus!
4.0,"Smoothies out, doesn’t really suck anything in though"
4.0,"Colour too bright, but kept anyway. Love these dresses"
4.0,I am a slightly large American.  Which means XXL Chinese.  I wonder what size American Mu-mu translates to.<br />Comfortable and it makes me feel like a &#34;brave person&#34;.
4.0,This suit fits okay. The scalloped edges would occasionally fold down and not look cute. Make sure to wash it first before you wear it out. I forgot and the black dye stained my body!
4.0,I would order a size up. I ordered for my daughter a 3t and that's her usual size and it's a little snug.
4.0,"really sticky, which is great and keeps things in place, but also a little painful to take off!"
4.0,Nice dress... durable fabric.  Belt wasn’t included.  That’s the only disappointment.
4.0,Lightweight and made well.
4.0,They are very comfortable just fit a little long on the foot.
4.0,"This shirt is really adorable! I ordered a Large originally but did return for Medium. I'm 5'7 around 170lbs. The medium is form fitting at the top (I wear 36DD) but then it flairs out almost too much. It can definitely hide imperfections in the tummy area. Although even in the hips I could pull tons of extra fabric out to the side. Which is shocking bc I wear a size 13 or 15 in juniors. I think because it is so large it clings where it can which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I'd say it does run large bc normally I wear a L or XL in shirts. I absolutely love this shirt/dress. I feel adorable when I wear it. The sleeves are very short, that's the only major downfall, I have chubby arms and I wish they were a bit longer. Overall, it's quite long, lots of room, and it's so dang comfortable ! I have now ordered 2 other colors!! :)"
4.0,"Very nice dress, style is that of a baby doll dress though. The top is sheer and I cut the stitch between the bust, also the skirt underneath is way to short (well if you are a tall person). The length was great, but the fabric is very delicate."
4.0,"Soft but heavy, very drapy, and the seams are large so it looks a little cheap. But with some cute accessories, this will be a cute and comfortable dress."
4.0,I really like the way this dress fits!  It's stretchy and comfortable too.
4.0,"A great deal for 4 light weight, breathable head cover hoods. We bought them for wearing under Cosplay Iron Man armor. Since we have multiple colors, we plan to use them for other cosplay creations."
4.0,"Tools look a little intimidating, but they worked well when I shortened the length.  The watch band itself looks great"
4.0,Looks like expected
4.0,"The goggles, ear plugs and nose clip work very well. My kids have long, thick hair; the swim cap didn't fit, so we purchased a different cap on Amazon."
4.0,"Needed this for an underlayer of a costume. It was great value for the money, although slightly small. I'd order a size up next time."
4.0,"The price is really good for the general quality of the products. Very soft, silky and comfortable. They have adjustable earloops as well which is super helpful. Only down side is one of the three masks has an error with the coloring to where you can't read it and it looks like something badly made in photoshop. However the other 3 are pretty cute and it's still cheap for 3 masks. The only downside is it can be really big on my face because I have a very narrow chin. Other than that I like them."
4.0,"To get the baggy look, order 1 or 2 sizes bigger.  Soft, comfy; I like the way you tie the straps as opposed to buttons."
4.0,"Very nice and colorful, Only negative is the inserts are VERY noticeable - when taken out there is NO support to hold up the girls."
4.0,"Finding a maxi dress at 6’1” is no picnic and dang near impossible. This goes to my ankles which is perfect for me to show off cute sandals! Super impressed. I ordered the olive green. Want to order the black and blue now. Wish it had an inch or two more in the bottom ‘gathering’ bit. It gathers more on my front then back which doesn’t do as a good a job camouflaging the back but works out fine. Love the pockets of course. Perfect for work, church, an event or a easy everyday look! Was really impressed that the sizing worked for me as well! Would definitely recommend!"
4.0,A little too loose
4.0,"Material feels somewhat cheap, but I guess that’s fair considering the price. Suit looks great and is very flattering."
4.0,I liked the design. The battery lasted for only about 6 months though.
4.0,Like the blouse. Ordered a M and it's a bit tight on the chest but don't know if L would have been too big......it's OK...I can live with it. Gave it a 4 out of 5
4.0,The shirts are not the same quality as the old G unit Tee shirts but it will do because I can not find the G unit Tee shirts anymore.
4.0,I with the chain was a little longer
4.0,"My son has trouble finding shoes that feel good (sensory issues and high arch).  I’ve been buying C9 Champion sneakers for him the past several years (sometimes Velcro closure, sometimes laces).  Now that Payless is out of business, this is the only place I can find them.  Maybe they no longer manufacture this style.<br /><br />So, this is now my THIRD time buying these shoes on Amazon in the past two months because our dog chewed up two brand new pairs and my son hates the feel of other shoes.  That tells you how comfortable they are.<br /><br />The cons:<br /><br />As I’ve learned over the past several years, the memory foam insole is not easily replaced and gets holes with wear<br /><br />These shoes are overpriced here.  When Payless was open, they were maybe $25? (cheaper with coupons).  Good luck finding this style anywhere now though<br /><br />There is no arch support, the insole is flat."
4.0,"No major issues.  They fit well for the family but as for me, there too small.  I have a bigger face.  So I neededto order a new mask.  Over all not bad."
4.0,"I have always been a fan of this style and needed a new pair. The fit is perfect for me, the bows have a mild double hinge so they can flex outward a bit. The lenses aren't as dark of a red as I would like, they have a bit of a pink tint when looking through them. But, they are still good sunglasses."
4.0,"The touchscreen sensitive could be better ... but other than that, it's a good watch."
4.0,Really cute necklace for the price it’s sold for.I have worn it a few times and it hasn’t faded/tangled . Love the design!
4.0,"Loos great, I think it will serve the purpose quite well on our deck. This is our first cantilever umbrella. We purchased the anchor weights separately. All in all it looks sturdy. The hand crank to open and close the umbrella was missing, contacted wikiwili and hope to hear from the soon. Will change review to 5 stars once rectified."
4.0,It quickly became one of my favorite sweaters for work and play.
4.0,So cute!! This looks so adorable on my daughter. Love that it's got a removable sweater. The quality of the skirt could have been a little bit better.
4.0,Good for the price! I am a small adult woman and bought a youth XL. Fits as expected. The quality is fine.
4.0,"The dress is cute, fun to wear, and fits pretty well. I'm 5'5, 38C, and approx 160lbs. I bought a Medium, and I typically wear a Medium/Large on top and an XL on the bottom so the A-Line cut works well for me. The cap sleeves are cute. I did receive compliments when I wore it. The buttons down the front and the side zipper seem a bit fragile to me and so I will use it with care. The material is more of a standard cotton blend -  the picture depicts the dress with more sheen or satiny looking material than it has. Over all, I am happy with the purchase and I would buy a dress from this maker again."
4.0,"im glad a got a size up from what I normally would have, it does come small but its very nice!"
4.0,Beautiful fits great only thing is it was so wrinkled had to send it too cleaners To be steamed before I could wear it..
4.0,"Eye covers are opaque, mask looks ok and stretches well"
4.0,"It arrived earlier than estimated date, the cat looks just like the picture, is very cute and seems pretty durable. As far as the chain.. at first it looked decent but after 2 minutes of walking in my house it snapped! So after it broke I stretched it lightly and it was so cheap it that it broke apart instantly. I would definitely change the chain even if it lasts you a while."
4.0,"Perfect for a classic pin-up look.  The pattern is crisp and the color is bold, I got the purple and black one.  This dress hugs your curves beautifully.  I was happy to find the the dress was very breathable. The only reason it isn't five stars is it is a but loose in the neckline.  That is seems it be because I am not as endowed as others.  It is a minor issue, it still covers my bra and let's me feel sexy.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion."
4.0,"I like the shirt but I was expecting it to fit a little better. But hey, im on a loosing streak and soon it will fit perfect. The back slit is all the way up to the neck and the slit is very wide. So the booty and back is all the way out. However i bought as a work out shirt so its actually really good for me. Just got to wear a camisole underneath. Having the back slit adds a slimming affect. Definetely trendy and sexy. If you got booty, it will be stared at with this shirt being so open in the back so do not be surprised if people are breaking they neck to see what you got on. Got lots of compliments from the gym ladies. The front sits right at  the top of my thigh and im 5'5."
4.0,"Being 6ft tall and curvy makes buying jeans almost impossible. I tried these out because Amazon has a great return policy so why not. They were long enough, I could roll them up and still have plenty length. Im thick through the thighs and hips with a smaller waist and these were very accommodating, but a belt would be helpful but not necessary. For the price they were well worth it."
4.0,"Cute dress... Flattering Fit Flare. I'm long waisted with long legs and felt like the fit and the length was appropriate for my body type. I'm 5'81/2, size 12. Fabric is forgiving but not as quality as I would have liked and the color is more Flesh/Peach Pink than it looks in the Photo. I paired it with a Pearl chain belt and a pair of pink floral wedges and it looks great. I like it!"
4.0,Ordered two of these: one in black and one in light gray. Both fit as expected. Order arrived pretty quickly.
4.0,"Love this coat, wind does not get through at all!"
4.0,"This does the job, it doesn’t seem to be the highest quality. I bought 4 Terry robes from 3 different brands and they all were comparable prices and comparable quality. I would not spend as much as I did on these if I had seen them in person first. However, they are not terrible. They are made out of what seems to be a low quality towel cotton terry. They are absorbent, they are hooded. I’m a size large in woman and 5’8” tall and this robe works well for me and my bf who is a size large in Men’s"
4.0,"5'4&#34; 115 Fits like a glove, a very fitted glove."
4.0,"I'm very happy with this strap. It's comfortable and the material is well made. I have this 4 stars because I ordered the OD green strap and while it is OD green it's closer to khaki. It's not quite as dark as pictured but I will conclude by lamenting that it is better looking than the picture, in my opinion."
4.0,I've never worn compression socks before.I thought they were very comfortable.
4.0,"I am 36DD and have a hard time finding nice low cut nursing bras but this one is a good fit and so soft and comfy. My only complaint is that I wore it while being a bit more active around the house (emptying the dishwasher, sweeping, vacuuming, etc.) and because of my large size, I kept partially falling out of it. However, for going out or a day of shopping, it works perfect."
4.0,"Haha awesome belt , my  friends actually believe that this is a Burberry belt ."
4.0,"Break in period is taking longer than expected.  I think it is due to the composite toe.  Not uncomfortable to wear, but they are a bit still to start.  I expect they will get better the more I wear them.  Waterproofing works extremely well."
4.0,Bought for my UGGs easy to use
4.0,Still hqrd to get over the toes
4.0,Great basic ballet leotard
4.0,This is a nice bag.  I like the idea of 2 separate straps.  It is roomy an has plenty of places to hold quick access items such as keys and phone.  It is roomy without being bulky or heavy.  The hardware is goldtone on the bag I received.  It appears to be well made but only time will tell how well it holds up.  I look forward to using it.
4.0,Dress fits perfectly other that it’s see through fits comfortably thou.
4.0,"Very tough piece of gear<br />Mine did not come waterproof and had the smell many people talk about, took me a few days to get rid of it<br />Not very insulating<br />Theres a million ways to use this thing its awesome"
4.0,"My daughter’s feet were so cold on our tile so o ordered these for Christmas. She loves them. They are soft and girly, and most importantly stay on her feet. The only complaint I have is the pic online showed the slipper without a heel strap a d the ones I received have a heel strap. I don’t mind this though, because the strap doesn’t seem to bother her."
4.0,"On the large side, but good. Fabric is good quality and does what it's supposed to."
4.0,Mask mandates is the reason I bought this.
4.0,Love it! A little bit big for me  but I still love it!
4.0,Runs a little large. I ordered the small. I am 5’5” and 115lb. It is a little big/baggy but I can still wear it.
4.0,4 Stars because we haven’t taken out hiking yet. My son already loves it. The green isn’t as vibrant as the picture. The blue matched the picture pretty well.<br />I like how compact it is when folded up. Main thing is how light it is. Looking forward to trying these out!
4.0,It is not as long as I wanted to be. I am 5'8&#34; and goes to my ankles. I would like it to be all the way to the ground but I still like it! I got the light blue one ad already have gotten compliments on it!
4.0,Cute took one star off because of the price
4.0,The dress is great just the material does not breath well.
4.0,"quite nice, easy to scratch off the dark grey or black though."
4.0,I really like this ring… the only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because it is so thin… the rings are very thin & can bend easily. I really like the way it opens to reveal the heart inside… bought one for myself & my teen daughter.
4.0,"Super comfortable, a little long but I love that."
4.0,"These are simple little woven bracelets that will give your wrist a splash of color.  They can be worn by guys and gals alike.  The size adjusts with just a pull of one of the strings.  I like the infinity symbol but there's others to choose: Heart, Clover and Love.  Perfect for hanging out in the summer or swapping with bestie."
4.0,"I like that these are a thinner style, and it was nice to get a variety of colors in the same purchase. These rings have zero sheen even though the photo portrays them as shiny and super smooth. However, the colors are still fairly accurate, although not nearly as vibrant as they look in the photo. I thought they fit true to size, and they are getting a lot of use."
4.0,So far just used to pump up basketballs and footballs and worked well
4.0,"The craftmanship of this rose gold plated earrings is about average. The stem was slightly bent but it held up well once inserted into your ears. They sparkle well, so they look appealing when worn. I liked the faux leather navy blue zippered wallet that it comes in, which is a nice bonus over the usual gift box and makes the item seem more expensive than it is. Overall they are a decent pair of earrings, though I wouldn't pay that much for them."
4.0,"The screw fell out and we didn't know and couldn't find it, its very small"
4.0,It's a little bigger than I thought.  I thought it might be a bit more delicate but that's ok because I plan on wearing it a lot.  Now I don't have to worry about that impacting it.  The seller was fantastic.  It seemed like I got it immediately!  Very well packaged as well.
4.0,"Love these a lot (wear them all day) but after a few washes on gentle, seam starting to come apart. Bummer. May buy another pair as inexpensive and I do wear them a lot."
4.0,"love the hat and plan to keep it,  but the headband could be a little longer as it stops just short of my ears and I fear it staying when I am dancing."
4.0,I have had many different styles of stays before but by far these are the best.  The clasps that grip the shirt are great and I have not had them slip once even when I'm crawling through a piece of equipment.<br /><br />Great product will definitely buy again when needed
4.0,"nice design.Can even wear in rain.Good grip .I liked it so much, got the larger size in black for myself :D A tag on mine said,thi sis the official foot wear provider for the American national ski team ! :) Am super pleased to hear that... lived up to my expectations,still in perfect shape after a whole month of vacationing!"
4.0,"The quality of the mask is awesome, but it is hard to breathe after a while. The viewspace and airflow is limited, due to the only holes in the mask being the nostrils. Other than that, it is a great mask"
4.0,"Comfortable but size up, they fit tight!"
4.0,"I LOVE this dress, it fits like a dream! Great cut and shape. Only four stars because the zipper is very cheap and I had to replace it after it split the first time I wore it"
4.0,5'2&#34; tall and 150 lbs. I ordered size XL.
4.0,"These run a little small.  I would size up if you're in doubt.  Even though I picked my exact number size when ordering, making me believe that the sizing would be very specific, they arrived with a medium tag.  Not that huge a deal, but it's a little misleading.  Good quality fabric and stitching.  I got several compliments on day one.  I'm going to get second pair but will size up."
4.0,This works well to keep all the small items organized and safe in my backpack.  I don't have to search and rummage through my bag to find stuff because it's all in one place.
4.0,"I like it. Automatic (self-winding) watches will make a big comeback because batteries are so expensive. As for this one, it seems to have a nice smooth movement and appears to be a quality timepiece. From the look and feel of it I'd be surprised if I didn't get years of good dependable service."
4.0,"its nice for the price, but its a little small"
4.0,My son is in between big boy clothes and men's clothes. This 14 fit him pretty well. The sleeves are a little long but for a winter jacket that's a plus.
4.0,Good quality for the price as good or better than ones at twice the price. I got it so quick I could not believe it.
4.0,I love these earrings they also can be both night and day wear.. Love them!!! I got these in different colors also
4.0,Product came in a timely fashion. Looks nice. Clasp could be a bit more sturdier. Would recommend it for anyone.
4.0,"Pricey, but good looking sweater.  Very Dark almost black."
4.0,This costume was a big hit at the school parade!
4.0,"Sizing was tricky, but I figured it out and got one that fits. The waist is odd. Doesn't lay flat. Cute though, good price!"
4.0,"The chain is not too long - ,which I would've liked. But it's just as shown in the picture."
4.0,I like this watch okay.  It's nice enough and looks sleek; I just thought it would have a shiny surface but it is a matte look.
4.0,"From the experience of a novice gardener, these gloves do the job just fine. They're comfortable enough, and don't get sweaty or icky. My only complaint is that after only a few minutes of weeding flowerbeds the finish along the seams on the hands started flaking off, but it's not enough to warrant changing them out. As for fit, I'm a lady with ""man hands"" and they were plenty roomy for me - not sure if they'd be too big for smaller hands. I'd be content with ordering them again if I didn't try on any other better gloves in person. Their main benefit is protecting all the way up the arm, which they did well."
4.0,"OMG!! This crown is no joke! Its beautiful and sparkly and it made my glinda the good witch costume! I had to put several bobbipins to hold it down because there is some weight to this crown. I gave 4 stars for packaging, it was thrown in a box with no cushion, so I had to glue a rhinestone back on. Otherwise if your thinking of buying it. Do it!"
4.0,Cute.  Long fringe.  I agve to my daughter and she was going to trim the fringe
4.0,using this for my baby shower i tried it on it fits great
4.0,"ÎIt fits really comfortable and dries pretty quickly when it's wet(I tested it when I washed my hands). The only thing is that they sent me the wrong size when I had ordered an L. HOWEVER, lucky enough, M fits perfectly! I also chose the one with burgendy when they sent me one with blue but I am not too concern about the color. I love that the material is thin but covers you from the cold, for most part (I work out early morning outside).<br />For reference:<br />Hips:46in<br />Waist: 33in"
4.0,"Good dress, but bigger than expected. I got the medium and I'm 40-33-40. The small would have perfect. But I can still jazz it!"
4.0,"I bought this costume for my 6'2  190 lb husband. This costume had a great mask although creased. Taking it out and filling it jammed with newspaper helped before wearing. The tie was well made and looked great. The coat fit my broad shouldered hubby well. It was very thin material but I expected this. The only thing we did not use was the bib / white shirt piece. It's easier to wear a white shirt than the flimsy bib. This costume does not come with pants or the gloves. Overall I was pleased. I gave it four stars bc it fit as expected, was fairly well made for the price point. You pay for what you get and I feel that I got that and more for the price."
4.0,"I've been looking for beaded leather bracelets at an affordable price for months.  Finally found what I was looking for!  This bracelet is just what I wanted.  Just under $20, adjustable size, soft leather that molds to your wrist, and lightweight.  I only wish it were a little bit smaller because, even when fully tightened, it's still a bit big for my wrist.  I will be buying more from this collection."
4.0,"just as pictures, size was right on and will be perfect to wear with leggings without feeling like im showing too much of my lady bits. I love leggings but need those tunics to make it more appropriate for public and work or other casual outings."
4.0,It’s a Christmas gift.
4.0,"Comfortable, warm.  Nice sweatshirt.  It has been used for working outdoors and has held-up well.  Good sweatshirt and a good value."
4.0,"Received this band today 5/25/2019. I’ll update durability as I get more wear with the band but I’ll do my first impressions.<br /><br />Pros: You came here foe the cost to quality. I’ve bought many leather bands on amazon ranging from $10-$60. I think the band surpasses the price point. The stitching is nice, I didn’t notice fraying it any type of glue that you would find in this price range. The buckle is a nice. It’s not bulky and gives it the sophisticated look to match the watch. I have small wrists and the holes are spaced out evenly that I can get a snug fit or enough slack that the watch won’t rotate on my wrist. The color (gold) on the adapter is almost an exact match..almost. There is a subtle difference but on a quick glance it’s hardly noticeable.<br /><br />Cons: the adapter corners are inconsistent when it comes to the shine or the gold stainless look. One adapter has a gold stainless shine but the other adapter has a regular gold look. The leather is very thin, very thin. I think this is where the cost comes in because of the thin leather. I’m not sure how well it will hold up and time will tell.<br /><br />Overall:  I'm keeping the band and giving it 4 out of 5 stars. I hope with the leather will develop patina as I wear it more often on a daily basis. It’s definitely worth the price and if they made it thicker leather I would pay an extra $10 more for it. Adding a little more thickness would give that premium feel."
4.0,Needed it for one FUN night.  It was exactly what I paid for and expected.
4.0,"The suit was cute and seemed like a quality item but it was just not long enough to fit comfortably in the bottom and be supportive up top. I'm 5'7"" for reference."
4.0,"my 12 you daughter loves it , so far no problems with it breaking, seems sturdy, not sure it is worth the $40 price tag, but it is unique"
4.0,Se sienten muy cómodos y tienen buenas protección.
4.0,Wish it was a little bigger but it is soft & snuggly.
4.0,"Nice for the price I would recommend this for a costume party, photo shoot. They take about 3 to 5 minutes to mold and heat up wax material for teeth mold that goes in the grilz.. But thier pretty cool .... the top are harder to mold and stay in place ... But the bottom ones were easy"
4.0,"Sizing up like requested made the fit just right; however, gave a little pointy shape and way up high. Not an everyday look!"
4.0,"This shirt looked like a comfortable and casual summer shirt, and for the price, it seemed ideal, so I thought I would give it a try. I'm a size Petite Medium, so I ignored the shouting ""order your usual size,"" looked at the manufacturer measurement (which was a match to me), rolled the dice, and selected a size Medium.<br /><br />But no, it's a bit snug, in my HIPS. I'm a petite medium everywhere, but that doesn't mean the shirt was measured or meant to encounter hips the way it does on a petite frame. Of course, I can always pull it up a bit, and go for the rumpled look.<br /><br />The fabric is super soft, which is delightful, but also thin - should have guessed, with it being white. it's perfect with a tank underneath; regrettably, that's not ideal for summer. And unfortunately, since I get extra fabric, it's for those cooler summer days that just don't happen in the southern US, ever.<br /><br />Basically, I'd have to say it's just not sized for petites, unless they're seriously small petites. But for others, this shirt is so soft that in other colors, it's would be a treat."
4.0,The do the job a bit lighter than I would like tho
4.0,"Utiles , buena vision<br />Protegen del sol"
4.0,"For the cost of bracelet, it’s decent as long as the string holds up. I’ve read other reviews here that said it didn’t. I’m hoping for the best. The size of beads are nice, but there’s imperfections and they are not polished.  I found the size good for me and the adjustment worked too. I’m happy with it."
4.0,"Very cute...Sometimes, I have to adjust it to it fits comfortably, but I have gotten lots of compliments and people who are curious as to what it is!"
4.0,Very nice in peraon but a bit too heavy so i will be returning.
4.0,Just a bit tight for me otherwise fine
4.0,It was a very pretty dress with someone to show off waist.
4.0,I loved these! They were the perfect size and I love that I have different colors so I can change then to match what I am wearing! Very good quality.
4.0,"Love the dress, just a little shorter than I had hoped. I am average height so it would be a little short on everyone."
4.0,I actually love these pants and they are great for summer. They hit me right above my ankles but I'm 5'1 so if you're taller they will be shorter on you. The material washes and dries very well with no shrinking and no fading. I'm glad I bought them.
4.0,Material is a little thinner than I had expected. Runs a bit small.
4.0,Nice design but the nylon frays easily.
4.0,"Item is as pictured/described. Beads are a lightweight plastic and metal chains are also lightweight. Not very expensive material no doubt, but it looks great for the price point! I'll be wearing it with my Egyptian costume anyway, so it suits my purposes."
4.0,Great product.  Enjoyed it.
4.0,"Nice quality. Unique bracelet, cool fastener."
4.0,"This cover-up is super cute. The black and white is really eye-catching and I love it. I live in Hawaii and have a gazillion swimsuits and cover-ups, but this is one of the nicer ones I have. It's a bit boxy and may swallow people with a smaller build, but as far as beach covers go, I'm very happy with this.<br /><br />Oh, and it washes well. I washed it on Hot with my darks, and dried it on High Heat and it came out just fine. No shrinkage or deformity to the crochet."
4.0,Super smooth and soft. Pocket is nice and roomey for a large phone. The elastic is somewhat snug.
4.0,"Christmas gift for daughter, who writes and is also a primary school teacher."
4.0,"I’m very happy I read reviews before purchasing.<br />When it comes to leggings I normally size large.<br />In my jeans I wear size 12R (32 inch inseem)<br />My hips are 42.5 inches my waist is 32.5 inches<br /> So I originally had added a size Large 32L<br />I decided to check reviews and after doing so decided to get a size XL 30L.<br /> They arrived and fit quite nicely.<br />I wasn’t really sure if they would be a keep or a return but they were nice.<br />Now I’m usually a regular 32 inch inseem, I ordered 30 inch, and they were almost too long. They will be fine with shoes However. I am 5’5. Id say if you’re any shorter these may not work for you.<br />Or if you wear a size 14 or up these may not work for you.<br />Also, they are very comfortable however, I can see my panty line. I think I will only wear these with a sweater that covers my bum."
4.0,It's for my best friend's birthday which is May 5th it's cute but it's way smaller than I thought and you can barely read what it says but it's cute but she loves cats so I believe she'll love it and also it is stamped and I love all the little details like with little stars and stuff in the back and around the circle that goes on to the bracelet
4.0,Very classy but sporty. I like that you can dress it up or wear it casually. I would buy it again in a another color.
4.0,"I usually just wear a t-shirt and shorts for swimming but I wanted something to wear under my shorts to tuck in my little bit of muffin top and these work well for that. They're comfortable and I like the band height to allow adjustment if needed. So far so good, I like them."
4.0,"I have only tried them on, but not worn them. They seem to be made very well and are made of a wonderful feeling material. When I saw capris, I assumed stretchy cheap cotton, but these are very nice and almost fancy in my opinion. I'm prettt simple. They pull on nicely. The only problem is that the size I ordered matched my measurements, but they are quite baggy on me. I would give 5 stars if they fit!"
4.0,"I like this as a beach cover-up and it's good for the price.  It is well-made and the colors are bright, as pictured.  The seams were all straight and complete.  The designs are cute, and it fits as expected.  My biggest issue with this, which I noticed on me and in many of the other reviewers' pictures, is that the majority of these have a flower or some other symbol right on the stomach, like a big target drawing focus to the one part of body I don't really want to draw attention to. lol  If you have a flat tummy, you won't have this problem, but for anyone else, I would suggest sticking to a more flattering pattern.  Other than that it is a cute cover-up!<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted rate or for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.<br /><br />I KNOW, I know, I know… roll your eyes and say another fake review. Well seriously, coming from a full time working mother of 2 toddlers, when I get something that makes my life easier, my kids happier, or improves the little &#34;me time&#34; I get, I WILL happily rave and encourage other to try it also. Likewise, if my purchase was just a waste of time and space (or somewhere in between) I will definitely say so, as I will no doubt be irritated at wasting my oh so precious limited time on something that disappointed me. If you also get puns and/or corny jokes with the review? Well, that is just my little gift to you. :o)<br /><br />As an avid online shopper, I rely heavily on the reviews of other customers before choosing which items to purchase, and I complete my reviews with that standard in mind. I receive no compensation for providing a favorable review (or for providing any review or all), or penalty for providing an unfavorable review. Not to mention, when I am deciding which products to purchase, I rarely look at ones with no reviews as I am just not willing to be the first one to take the plunge.  This isn't a way for sellers to manipulate you into purchasing their products- it is a way to get people to try something new, and share their experience so that other shoppers have something to go by.  Take it with a grain of salt if you would like to, but reading a review from someone who has actually tried a product, even at a promotional cost, is better to me than going in alone.  (Not to mention, you are more likely to get pictures, which lets face it- most helpful reviews ever!)"
4.0,Cute dress wore it for wedding as a hostess.
4.0,"Runs large, white is somewhat transparent.  You would need to wear a camisole under it.  Returned the product."
4.0,So they look like they have rhinestones on them but it's really just cut outs still super cute sunglasses I get complimented on them all the time just wish there really was rhinestones
4.0,This is pretty loose in the chest If you're not busty. A or B cups would have this issue in my opinion. Otherwise I like the fit everywhere else.
4.0,"They're huuuge 😅 I normally wear 11.5, but these were way too big. I'm gonna have to possibly go down two sizes, 10.5."
4.0,"The stretch fabric makes this fit as expected.  Lovely feel green color.<br />For the great price, don't expect the fabric to keep a nice drape as pictured.  It is difficult to iron and the cap sleeves may be unflattering on larger arms unless you can get them to iron well."
4.0,"They are as cute as can be, but they look much better made in the photo than they actually are. Still really cute sandals,"
4.0,"The pins that attach the band to the watch face are not secured so we you take the band off to swap it with a different one the pins fall out very easily and can be hard to find.  Otherwise, the band had held up nicely.  No fraying, I have been wearing it everyday for a month.  The elastic is holding up nicely so far as well.  It's comfortable, much more comfortable than the fuex leather strap the watch came with."
4.0,"Love the style, I just wish it had a warm liner in it. I would like to wear it more often during the winter but it's not quite warm enough for extremely cold weather. But it's a great product and fits well."
4.0,"It was a little big, but this just means the Lad can make it for another year. The boy loves it"
4.0,"I ordered a size 14 and I immediately knew it was more like a 12 so size UP! For that reason, I deducted 1 star. I did try on the suit and will have to loose a bit more weight to pull it off. It IS a gorgeous bathing suit and the colors are true to the pictures. The top is very flattering and overall I do love it."
4.0,"Cute, simple , love the extra pockets. Perfect for golf."
4.0,The color is beautiful.  The material is kinda cheesy.  Cannot wear my pendants on it.
4.0,Well made but run very small
4.0,Me gusto mucho!! Su cristal es de buena calidad! Es de un buen tamaño! Pero las agujas no llegaron alineada a las 12 las aguadas no se juntaban exactamente... reclame al vendedor y no me dieron respuesta para solucionar mi problema. Pero de todas formas lo lleve arreglar en mi país y ya todo funciona bien y me encanta!
4.0,I’m busty and 5’4 can’t say how super cute this is but runs a little small. I ware a 34dd and snug but would order it all over again. Cut is awesome. Sleeves are unique and overall the dress is flattering got lots of compliments.
4.0,"They do run a little big, the crotch area does sag and they also fall down off her waist. I really love these pants and so does my daughter so it’s a shame they don’t fit just right. They’re so warm, soft and cozy."
4.0,I bought these becuz I have a good estate quality large purple stoned and gold ring.  The photo makes the item seem a little larger than they are.  They are very delicate little pieces.  I found a gold chain matching the oval links exactly so I now have a full set.  They are sparkly and seem relatively good quality at the discounted $200-ish price.
4.0,Adorable bracelet for the horse lover!
4.0,I felt professional and feminine in this dress. I will be buying more!
4.0,great shirt and good fit
4.0,"one of the cutest wallets i've ever bought. it goes really well with the purse i bought, the pink is beautiful it opens pretty easily. only down side it had a funky factory smell that didnt got away for about a week... but other than that it is perfect. shipping was pretty fast too."
4.0,Great for warm legs.
4.0,"There is not much to NOT like about the Kate Spade series watch bands.<br />They are very stylish and it obvious that attention to detail went into their design.<br />The band fit my wife's med/large wrist well.<br />The stainless buckle and ends were a kiss of quality.<br />The packaging was impressive for anyone interested in gifting it.<br />We love how this band lays flatter against the wrist than many of the cheaper $7 imports. This is due to the fact that it is made to pivot at the joint where it meets the watch.<br />We loved everything about this band and its design except the shade of pink.<br />My wife's Apple 3 watch is silver and the pink doesn't present as well against it in my opinion as it may against the rose gold.<br />Even still, it is something that she will wear and enjoy for a long time to come."
4.0,"Looks great, washes well, fits as expected. - Attracts pet hair better than a vacuum but it is VERY comfy"
4.0,It has a good feel and fit
4.0,Keeps time so far - a little under 5cm or 2inches in diameter - metal case - the watch has a nice feel of weight to it - comes in a box suitable as a gift - delivered in a gray plastic bag with bubble wrap no signature required - arrived ahead of schedule - I paid just under 5 dollars delivered and that strikes me as a bargain - I might buy a few assorted pocket watches from this seller just for fun
4.0,The dress is gorgeous and well made! If you have slightly bigger arms I would suggest a size 2. Im a zero and only that part was uncomfortable for me. I will upload pictures!
4.0,I liked it overall the sleeves were just a little too small but for the price it's a good deal.
4.0,"I received this dress just in time that I could've tossed it in the wash in preparation for a funeral that I had to attend. If only it was closer to American sizing than Chinese, it would've been perfect.<br /><br />The dress looks just as it's shown in the pictures. It's sleek, the peplum adds just a little flair to it, and the tie at the neck adds a fashionable little flair. Just because I'm plus sized doesn't mean that my wardrobe is full of black, though (I hate that that's most designers' plus size default - many of us plus size ladies like color and cheer, too!), which is why this would've been perfect for the funeral. *sigh*. If only...<br /><br />This is a well-made garment, crafted of synthetic fibers. Even if I were to order this a size up, I would expect it to be clingy and ""body conscious"", so, as I prefer a little forgiving looseness to my garments (but not so much that I look like I'm wearing an unflattering sack), so you might keep that in mind when ordering. It's fashionable and attractive, but definitely runs on the smaller side."
4.0,"These shorts are very lightweight and breathable, they are very soft as well, the perfect running short!"
4.0,"It's just perfect, I'll buy the camel color next."
4.0,"Fits aviator sunglasses and watches with just over a 45mm case diameter +crown.  Good quality especially considering the price.  Looks good over my safe, but came with some of the stitchings a little loose and would have a better feel with a hinge on each side rather than just one.  Overall I would recommend this product for this price range."
4.0,"Cargo shorts arrives with factory packaging and funny &#34;Engrish&#34; tags.  A few of the cords are nonfunctional (decoration only?), but otherwise this garment is well-sewn."
4.0,Nice watch but to small
4.0,"They did well for the purpose I bought but half of them came folded, leaving creases on the wings that I was unable to take out"
4.0,The legs are okay put the top is too big!
4.0,They are just the right size.
4.0,"I LOVE these. The control top works wonderfully. It doesn't ride down with movement so you're not constantly tugging at it. The only down side is they're too thick to wear when it hot out unless you like sweating, and if you're bigger in the bottom area they stretch so thin that they're see through in certain light."
4.0,As described but a little small.
4.0,Seemed durable and fit grown men’s heads.
4.0,They are decent quality and fit well. They are cute on her. Overall pretty pleased. Wish the shipping wasn't so high it's the only thing that would keep me from ordering from them again.
4.0,This is a cute charm but was a liitle smaller than I expected.
4.0,"It arrived quickly. Seems to be well made. It has no structure except for the bottom. This can be good, since you can stuff a lot into it, but it makes it a little difficult to pack, becuase the sides keep falling in. I used it for a weekend trip 1 day after it arrived, and it was just fine. The only issue, which I expected, is due to physics. It ends up having a narrow spacing between the wheels, and also being quite tall from the wheels. Sort of a regular bag turned sideways. So it tends to be a little unstable. Not a problem if you pay attention while you are wheeling it along, but something to be aware of."
4.0,Pero cumple con los estandar
4.0,"Very nice, they are certainly huggies on me. In fact, if anything, they are a little tight. I guess we all have different size ears."
4.0,Tighter than what I would have expected. I definitely recommend going up a size.
4.0,"Cute, runs a bit large but growing kids feet means its great!"
4.0,The top is cute but it's a polyester type material
4.0,A little tight around edge causing some redness on foot - expect them to stretch a bit - otherwise they are perfect!
4.0,"This is a good Apple Watch case that ALMOST meets all my needs. So I’m giving it 4 stars, and listing all its good features, but I wish it could be perfect. It’s terrific to have a watchband that is ALSO a protective surrounding case that’s built right in, as one piece … The watch pops right into place, with no silly fiddling with connectors, that eventually break! That part is wonderful … and the included screen protectors are super-easy to apply, too!  But there’s ONE thing needed to make this case PERFECT. It really, really needs to be silicon with a soft, silicon, Solo-style elastic band, so it could be pulled on INSTANTLY: which will need different wrist sizes available, just like the actual Apple Watch Solo silicon elastic band. Please, please make a version that will have this feature! The existing version will be good for a lot of people, but I really (REALLY) need a version that I can pull and it off with just one hand, and NO need for a buckle! PLEASE! If you do it, I will change my review from 4 stars to 5 stars!"
4.0,"It was way way to small  Well made, but I would say it's defiantly not made for a woman"
4.0,5' 6&#34; 185lbs. Looks great when you're standing still but if your a DD or greater there is no lift (support). The straps are really tricky too. I did my own thing and criss crossed in front and back to get support. Buy a size smaller b/se the top is a lil large close to the armpit area. Another reviewer showed a pic of the area and its accurate.
4.0,"It's a bit more see through then expected but still fits great. Loose, flows, and flattering."
4.0,"Fit as expected but, found a small hole on left side toward the bottom of the shirt; easily fixed but changes the quality of the shirt."
4.0,"they work well, just a tad big for a 3 year old at the nose bridge"
4.0,"My daughter is 9.5 and has a 30"" waist. I have had trouble finding her underwear that is both comfortable and long lasting. The quality is not rough, and the stitching looks like it will last. She really likes the fit, and I think she'll have a bit of room to grow. I only wish they made larger sizes. It seems she may end up between kid and adult sizes in a few years."
4.0,This IS a super cute head band
4.0,"Much too large according to the chart. It was not flattering with the sizing being too large. Otherwise lovely dress. However, it would've been the perfect fit if I weighed 20-30 pounds more. I'm 170."
4.0,"This is 3 pairs of fairly good quality glasses that provide nice magnification for reading or using the computer. The frames are simple but nice looking, and the glass is sharp enough to read even small print. Comfortable to wear."
4.0,"2 out of the 6 bras didn't even come close to fitting me around and I ordered them bigger than I normally get (42D and I ordered 44DD) The ones that fit, fit beautifully!"
4.0,I adore this ring.have not had any issues w its silver quality but it's easily bendable so I do wear it w attention to not ruin the shape
4.0,"The quality seemed fine, they were just too big for my 16 month old."
4.0,"I'm 5'8 with a 36B and the medium was a little too tight in the chest.  A large fit much better.  The shirt itself is cute  - I got the pink one, and on me fits as depicted by the model.  The shirt seems to be made of decent material and construction.  A good value for the price."
4.0,"Very cute shirt, flowy and flattering, true to size. No need to size up."
4.0,Great pajamas-but you can’t put in washer or dryer. Kinda a hassle for pajamas
4.0,"Love the shoes, they’re cute and as expected beside something being a bit sharp at the top of my foot when wearing them."
4.0,It was great my necked showed a bit and my feet to big other than that awesome
4.0,I like how they fit but I ordered plaid and did not get plaid got striped ones
4.0,"Very comfy. A little heavy for playing golf, but great before and after the round.  Looks as good as it feels."
4.0,"I give this shirt 4 stars because the Regular Fit still fits me quite loose.  But I also give this shirt my recommendation because even though its loose, it still manages to be comfortable and look okay on me.  FYI: The shirt is a LOT more mocha colored IRL, but it still looks fashionable."
4.0,"This dress is great! Only problem is the length. Gave me an opportunity to buy some cute 2” espadrilles though!😂😂 I’m 5’7”, 225 lbs. ordered a 4x because I wanted it to be oversized."
4.0,"This is a great casual dress that can be dress up just a little or worn for more informal occasions. The further dress was as expected, and the fabric was soft and somewhat stretchy. The dress was a little bit of a looser fit than expected but looks great with leggings in cold weather, and will be nice and cool in the summer. Overall, would recommend for those looking for a casual midway to dress."
4.0,"Very solid overall. The leather is nice and soft, the inside is comfortable. Ignore what people say about the smell, it just smells like leather, which is nice in my opinion. Also, get a size down from what you think you need, they're a little big and I wish mine were a littler tighter. I'd give it 5 stars if they were just a little warmer. (don't leave them in your car in the cold or your hands will be colder when you put them on)"
4.0,The band is great.  I wish it was a bit longer.
4.0,cheap but I only needed it for a night
4.0,Only 4 stars because some of the seams started to give out during my first use without over stuffing them. Otherwise good for the price.
4.0,I love the design.  Only giving it 4/5 because it's a bit big around the armholes and doesn't lay flat.  I'll have to take it in a bit to give it a better fit.
4.0,"The material is a little strange - it is not gingham.  It has a lot of spandex in it.  The collar in the back is a bit stiff and a little high but not to bad and the sleeves are a little small.  However, all in all it is a nice dress."
4.0,"The jewelry is fine but the length is way too small for what I needed it for. They weren't cheap, so I really wish they would have worked."
4.0,"Quality tie here, truly, but a little tough to knot. I love the color scheme, and it matches my alma mater (Bear Down), so I figured I'd give it a shot for the price. I'll probably end up buying a tie with nicer materials and easier knotting some time to keep the look without the hassle. Don't get me wrong, because this is still a good tie, but it might take some getting used to in order to get a nice knot, compared to a thinner or softer material of a nicer tie."
4.0,Bought as gift for graNDCHILD WHO HAD PICKED IT OUT.  sHE WAS HAPPY.  tHEY FIT AND WERE JUST AS SHE EXPECTED.
4.0,They fit really well on my for being a slim 5'5 male 120lbs
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:90bd0e968e22cee3ea5c4b17c30b7a3a]] This outfit is a one size fits all so I didn’t really expect this to fit me quite the same as it does the model as we have very different body shapes.  Knowing that, I do like this outfit.  It’s not a love for me because it’s neither my husband’s favorite style nor mine, but it is definitely a cute outfit.<br /><br />A few things this outfit has going for it is the color scheme.  I think light pink and black like this are an awesome color combo and the mix of materials is great too.  The pink part is a really light, almost mesh like material and then there’s some really pretty lace and like eyelet fringe accents.  Because it’s much smaller on me than the model, I feel like the details don’t show as well in the video as they do in person, but this is actually really beautiful.  I like the back and that you can adjust the ties to best fit you.<br /><br />You can see the fit of the outfit in my video.  For size reference I generally wear a US women’s size 12.  Obviously it’s a better fit wearing it without clothes under it, but it is still smaller on me than the model.  Overall, it’s a really pretty, well-made outfit but it’s just not my normal style.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion."
4.0,Beautiful shoes. Gave it 4 stars cause my mom bought the same shoes in a different size and it was packed better than the ones I ordered (the box was brand new and each show came in its own little bag)
4.0,"My daughter was happy with them. They went well with her costume and she was able to wear them under her web shooter.  Ok quality, very thin."
4.0,this was a very tight fit  ..
4.0,"So, first things first, I did not want this shirt to fit like a compression shirt so I ordered a large (I think, I can't see my order info on this page) though I normally wear small/medium. It fit great! It is so soft, the colors are very vibrant, I honestly was SO excited to wear this on super hero day at my school and it served it's purpose perfectly. My only complaint, speaking of the colors, is the first time I washed it, the red ran all into the yellow. I was heartbroken. I got rid of enough through every suggestion on Google, but only enough for it to look like ""maybe"" it was supposed to look like that. So, buyer, buy with confidence,  wash with trepidation."
4.0,"very pretty,  Stone was a little darker in color than one in photo at time of purchase, not a big deal though.  This was a gift and the recipient loved it, wears it, still wears it.  It has held up with no fading and looks very nice."
4.0,I love the fabric with its silky feel. I love the pockets.<br />It's a bit snug for me.
4.0,"This came exactly as it appears in the photo but definitely runs smaller. If you want the oversized, off the shoulder look you will need to size up a bunch. I am usually a small in tops but I got a medium and its not really oversized. That being said, it's still a cute top for the money!"
4.0,"The person i gave to loved it but you should expect a lighter color, like #fc4903 rather then the purple you see."
4.0,This dress is very long but I still like it. The back makes your butt look/ appear bigger.!!!<br />So I wore this while being pregnant and got tons of compliments!!!! Bought 2 of these also got the colorful one too.
4.0,Arrived on time and is very pretty.  Fits Ginger Snaps.
4.0,Works well when needed and easily carried. ..Looks cute on almost anyone..Very pleased..
4.0,"Somewhat small, but I was able to stretch it out and it fits nicely now.  Comfortable and I've gotten compliments on it.  Yeah!"
4.0,I love it!!!  I am a size 6 and I ordered a medium!!
4.0,It's nice I like it as per the price .
4.0,Love this little anklet I got this for the summer to wear and it's adorable it has a pearl a shell and a starfish on it and totally gives off mermaid vibes (my daughter keeps telling me I look like a mermaid when I wear it) it's perfect and dainty but seems like it will hold up well. And I love that the shell is real and not just a piece of plastic  and that it came in a pretty blue pouch
4.0,is so cute and the fit is good .. washes and dries in the maschine without problem and no ironing required
4.0,"This is a great idea and will come in handy when im running somewhere and dont need to bring my whole purse.  Its lightweight and large enough to carry a phone, chap stick, cards and cash. I will use this daily on walks to the park or walking our dog and need a spot to place my keys. It doesn't feel like the highest quality but we will see after some use, cant always judge a book by its cover. This will be used regularly, Thanks!"
4.0,"Overall nice gloves but they're not really grey.  The color is closer to a taupe or khaki.  The way the fingers are stitched is kind of cheap with exposed edges.  But the leather seems nice, the lining is nice, and they fit my fat hands and give me another choice besides black or brown."
4.0,"The tughts are very high-quality however, at 5' 4&#34; I thought a medium would be plenty large for me and the waistband was very tight. I'm 140lbs size 6/8 and slim, the length is great it's just very snug in the waist I'm sure it will loosen up though. The color 'coffee' is very very dark (almost a copper color) on my light skin but from stage plays off as dark tan. overall I'm happy with them."
4.0,I orginal bought the all black with gold trim glasses first & i absolutely love them.  They're comfy & keep the sun out & pretty dark lens. I always get compliments on them. So i decided to buy these ones too as a back up pair. they are just the same but with yellow lenses & instead of the glossy plastic finish they have a matte finish which is kind of dissapointing because they don't look as nice & i find them sliding down my nose a lil. Overall though these glasses are a steal for the money.
4.0,"My daughter wore this for the daddy daughter dance and it was beautiful! She loved it! It was a litte itchy on some parts of the material but for the money, it was totally worth it."
4.0,These are great but very difficult to get on and off.  I've only worn once as it is too difficult with my injured leg.  😥
4.0,"My girlfriend picked out several dresses for her new job, she's a classy chick.  She loves this dress and how it fits.  Got her a &#34;petticoat?&#34; to go with it so she can dress it up sometimes.  She said the quality is nice and well made."
4.0,It’s a bit small around the arms but I still kept it. Nice and flowing
4.0,Very cute but needs clips to stay put
4.0,"I wanted a 'satiny' night gown and I like this.  But make no mistake -- it's polyester, not so satiny per se.  They stated that it ""breathes"" and I haven't had problem being hot, so I'm satisfied with that.  I do think, though, that it's a little bit overpriced for what it is and where it comes from (but being fulfilled by Amazon has a cost to it).  It does seem to be well constructed.  It would be even better if they had sewn it to be a little bit A-line to be more giving in the fit.  While it looks roomy, it has wings.  I buy this type of thing to be a bit oversized, and this just barely fits.  It says to cold-wash and air dry, and I didn't want to mess with that if I didn't have to.  I washed it in ""cool"" water and but it in the dryer on low for 10 minutes.  It didn't shrink or do anything bad.  Happy with that also."
4.0,Very nice pretty colors light weight
4.0,The red one came broken but the rest look so good
4.0,The are the right color. They were a little tight going over the feet but comfortable.
4.0,VERY LOVELY DRESS WORE IT TO WORK. MATERIAL LIGHT AND SUITABLE FOR THE CARIBBEAN.
4.0,"These are super cute dresses, really popping colors for the kiddos!<br /><br />The downside is they are small. I ordered 2 sizes over what all the kids are in (three dresses total) but they all are still really short.<br /><br />One of the kids is super tall, which I didn't account for, so she got a cool, slightly long, shirt. The other two got dresses, but still above the knee.<br /><br />Cheap, cheaply made, perfect if you don't want to go spendy on a decent and cute dress/top. Four stars for the fact they really need 2-5 inches added for length."
4.0,"Beautiful dress, it was too large for me. But will be ordering a smaller size tho. Cut is off, I was medium or large but followed the chart"
4.0,Very nice looking cosplay ring set a little stiff on adjusting them for my son smaller hands but other than that pretty cool rings.
4.0,I really like the way these earrings look on me. I will wear them for dress up nights on my cruise.
4.0,Very cute shoes.  These were a bit big for my daughter and the gold fringe bends/folds over if not stored carefully.
4.0,"A simple tool that's designed to do a simple job. Hold the band in place and tap out the pin with a small mallet, not included. Works better than the screw type alternative. The pins are stronger and should last a long time."
4.0,"Fit is good.  Very warm, but a little bulky, but not enough to be a problem.  A bit slippery for driving, could use some grip dots on the fingers and palm.  Took a star away for bulkiness and being slippery.<br /> Great for the price.  Will do the Job."
4.0,"I like that this is simple, not bulky and it holds what I need. The coloring, logo and material are nice- though, I question if there will be any trouble with a couple small parts in the stitching, in the near future (that's the only ""concern"" I'd say I have).<br /><br />The info that came with it says: ""Any natural marking are a distinct part of the character and texture of leather which makes each Louis Pelle leather products unique.""<br /><br />It's a little bigger than a credit/ID card in length and width. There are 3 slots on the left that comfortably fit around 3-4 cards and on the right 1 slot that could potentially hold several cards...there is a pocket behind the slots on each side....I worded it ""potentially holds"" because while it can hold several cards, it will be a matter of personal preference on how thick/how much you want in it."
4.0,Love this necklace! Great quality! I recommend getting it
4.0,The band that came with the watch is terrible
4.0,I received two (2)...1 for me & 1 for my son. We like them.
4.0,"I bought these for my 4 y/o for his Halloween costume. They are great, the fingers are really long though."
4.0,"for the price, is obviously outstanding, however compared to other wigs ive ordered from cool2day inc, it is the lowest quality. it is however the wig pictured and i do enjoy it. i can tell it wont last as long as other wigs ive purchased through cool2day, though. still very cute"
4.0,"These shorts are a great improvement over my old brand. I can comfortably ride at least twice as far with this padding, and plan to get another pair. They do run large."
4.0,"I am giving the product four stars because it was shipped fast. However, as someone who has bought Matt & Nat handbags over the years, I have to say their quality has gone down hill. There was stitching on this handle that was done really poorly—It looked like the manufacturing you would expect on a 15.00 purse at Walmart.<br />That said, because of the sustainably sourced materials involved and the fact it’s Vegan, I’ll keep it."
4.0,The dress is beautiful! I like that it does not have to be ironed and can be stored in a suitcase without worrying about it wrinkling.<br /><br />It seems I may need to wear a slip under the dress. The order arrived quickly.
4.0,Loved this shirt! My only compaint is that the fabric is a bit rough so it’s not super comfortable.
4.0,The leggings are more like tights to me.  I am tall and they fit but they are a little thin but thicker than panty hose.
4.0,Not for small heads
4.0,They were very appreciated by the birthday girl.
4.0,"In the picture, they looked like little balls with rhinestones. Instead, they turned out to be little round rings with stones. They weren't what I wanted but they are still pretty!"
4.0,"Like all of the saddleback leather goods we own, this is a very durable high quality bag. The only downsize was that it was a little too big and the clasp was a little stiff. The mini one ended up being the perfect size and my girlfriend has used it almost nonstop for the past 6 months."
4.0,"These are very pretty earrings, however the pictures are deceiving. There were no other reviews, so I took a chance. They are in fact 3.2 inches long, not as shown in the photos but in the description and heavy. I haven't decided if I will keep them or not."
4.0,I love this shirt.  It is very flattering and sexy!  Just what I was looking for!<br />I love the deep red color.<br />You won't be disappointed.
4.0,"Cute hate, it arrived all crumpled and wrinkled. Hat to dampen and reform. Fortunately it’s ok now. Need to redo the picture, I thought this was light grey. Yes.. I realize it says white. I missed that detail. I guess I’m a visual shopper. Little disappointed that it’s white just because fishing can be filthy and the white won’t stay white for long!"
4.0,it is comfortable and warm
4.0,seemingly standard size and definitely good quality
4.0,Buttons may need fortifying... its a pretty top.  Wearing it you might have to deal with the usual irritations from lace... i may use it with the neck opened and not buttoned up as shown on the model.
4.0,"So I'm 5'3 and 108 pounds and I got a small. The bottoms were perfect, but the tip was slightly big. But I noticed with the top it can be easily fixed if you know how to sew or just getting it hemmed. Besides that it's very cute!"
4.0,"Shirt was a good fit.  I ordered a XXL and I'm 6'1 250lbs. Label  on the front is a little big for my liking,  but others may like it.  The make is Gildan heavy cotton."
4.0,It’s not the softest (and the pockets are indeed bulky) but I can tolerate the look and material. True to size.
4.0,Well made for an inexpensive dress.  Stretchy material and launders nicely.  I am sure she will wear it for one summer then out grow it.  Fun print.
4.0,They are indeed ultra think but not translucent.  Good sock for California fall thorugh winter when you might want a bit of warmth with your levis.
4.0,Great band! Been looking for a metal band without gaps for a while but always seem the color of the band and gear S3 were a little off from the pictures. This band color is dead on. Alittle hard to install but worth the patience and curse words installing it!
4.0,Overall great earrings but on one of the parr’s they put the screw on the wrong side
4.0,I loved everything about this jacket except that you cant adjust the side straps but I knew that when I ordered it. It would be easy to take in by hand.
4.0,Nice belt! Exactly what I was looking for!
4.0,was a gift for someone else
4.0,"This workout set is nice and thick yet flexible material with good amount of compression. I love how the high waist squeezes in the belly without feeling restrictive. Both pieces have a very flattering fit overall. However, the short do roll down when moving round but I defiantly like the high waist and they are true to size. As for the top, I really loved the lowered back, however the straps do move towards the shoulders while I was running but didn't fall off. The top also fits a little snug undue the arms and in the chest area. I am typically a woman's medium and ordered a medium. Overall, material is good quality and it is comfortable."
4.0,"Such a cute little mask.  The fabric is quite thin so I wouldn't wear it without the filter.  I love the removable filter and nice adjustable ear straps. Very comfortable.  As soon as I opened mine, I ordered one for my friend. I know she will love it."
4.0,"Nice fabric and color was perfect. I’m 5’3 and although they fit at ankle, there was too much fabric which made them have a baggy look. Would work on taller individual."
4.0,"If anyone saw the photo and thought it was a burnt Orange… that’s exactly what I saw as well and also why I bought it, but when it arrived it is definitely more of a “faded salmon color.”  I kept it, because all and all it’s still cute… but just not the color I was expecting."
4.0,"Awesome, affordable throwback."
4.0,Looks really good on!<br />Just a little tight around ears.
4.0,Nice material and very warm. My son works on cars and I gave him this so he doesn't have to wear a big coat during those cold days. He loves this jacket and wears it even he's not working outdoors.  4 stars because the underarm section stains when he sweats.
4.0,I love the necklace.  Love the colors.  I can not get the stones to all face the way it shows in the picture.  I may have put them on the necklace wrong.  I will try some other combinations to see if I can get them to lay out nicely.  I would love to see earrings to match that has more than one stone set up.
4.0,"Ok so I love this dress, however in the pic the hole is right below the breast. But on me it’s right in between my cleavage. The top part fits really weird, that’s the only reason why I gave it a 4star. It fits very long as well. I might have to get it altered. Overall the dress is nice, beautiful color in person,& sparkly. Plus I’m glad it’s has black mesh at the sides, so it doesn’t show my stomach! 👌🏾"
4.0,"Every thing about this bathing suit is cute, and good quality although if I turn my waist my boob could pop out from the side. I also remember ordering a medium but the package says it's a large but it fit well"
4.0,"Very high quality shoes.  Look great.  However, my kiddo's  big toe keeps popping out.  Not sure if that's just his feet that this happens to?"
4.0,I measured my ring size but even then I’d recommend getting a half size bigger. They run a tiny bit too small for my liking.
4.0,"It's an incredibly cute, soft, lovely sweatshirt, but it's fit like a minidress.  I am 5'3"", a US XS on top, and a US M on bottom, which makes fitting tough.  I went with large because I didn't want the top to be too big, but it barely fits over my hips.  It actually has to stretch to fit my hips, and I can probably only wear it with leggings.  For a sweatshirt that has lacing on the sides, I would have expected a looser fit on the body.  Usually a US M means China XL, but I would not have expected a sweatshirt of all things to be tight across the hips!  The quality of materials is great, though!"
4.0,"Seems to be a good quality bag...<br />I was disapponted to find that the “heart”<br />was a perminate part of the bag.<br />You can still draw on this, but the heart will always be there.  I think they should make this clearer in the listing."
4.0,"Good for the price. The fabric is heavier, like a light fleece, so you can put more in the pocket and it doesn't look any different than a regular scarf, plus it's super soft. Beware though, it will get fuzz *all* over everything. I'm still finding fuzz on bag straps and in my laundry. Fine if the color of your shirt is close to the color of the scarf, but pretty bad otherwise. Held up for a two week international trip in pouring rain, was soaked through at least 4 times and still held its shape, even with things pulling at the pocket. Little bit of pilling, but nothing too noticeable. Ruffled permanently a little bit when it was wet and I had my phone in there, but you don't notice that unless you're looking for it, so overall, happy with my purchase."
4.0,Once washed it did shorten up a bit.
4.0,These are really cute. The bottoms are only a little small but the top runs VERY small and it is very narrow. My kids are slim and I ordered a size up so I'm crossing my fingers they will fit Christmas morning. If you kid is not shaped like the kids in these pictures I would try a different pair.
4.0,"The shirt is a bit sheer but I expected that reading the description and seeing the materials it was made of. I am usually an xs or s but ordered a medium and it fit perfectly, so size up. Overall, the shirt style wasn’t for me, ( its a different style than I normally wear) but it was cheap and I thought I would wear it to work with a tank underneath. I contacted the seller for a return and they got back to me very promptly which was much appreciated."
4.0,On the small size but very cute!
4.0,Durability is good except the metal plating has started to peel and has caused a rash.
4.0,Great product I already shared it with some of my motorcycle friends
4.0,"These are very comfortable socks. However, note that I bought them to wear as comfy socks around my house and am a woman with a 9.5/10 size foot. These fit me well. I'm not sure how well they would fit a man's foot larger than my own."
4.0,Well made and reasonably priced straw bag that will serve as a casual purse during the summer. I like the size. It isn't an oversized tote that takes up a ton of space. I'll probably add a lining so stuff doesn't snag but it isn't essential the weave is tight enough so things won't fall thru. Don't be concerned if the handles are twisted when it arrives. Put a book in it and hang it from a door knob. They straighten out over night.
4.0,These sandals are awesome in terms of being able to wear them all day but the only thing I can't stand is the odor that starts to develop after a couple weeks of wearing. Since the bottom of the sandal is a type of sponge material it absorbs the sweat and whatever else into the sole. I believe this causes bacteria to grow and I've found that this to be a common complaint among Teva owners. My solution was to rub hand sanitizer (weird I know) into the footbed and it has seemed to work so far. Not sure how long it will last though.
4.0,"Cute dress, liked the style but was to tight in the bust for me.  Couldn't zip it up.  I went off the reviews as far as size but maybe could have gone a size up.  Fit everywhere else though.  Sent it back."
4.0,"I'm 5'2 and there was so much more length to the dress! I have to try it in a knot in both the front and the back to not trip on it. But the color is great, it's so light weight, perfect for summer. The pockets are amazing. I will be wearing it a lot."
4.0,"Fits well, my toes don't hate me for wearing it.  I wish it had more compression."
4.0,Great shoes. My 5 year old granddaughter  says they are very comfortable and she likes how they look. Would buy again.
4.0,"Cute, snags on clothes though"
4.0,"These do the job, though I wish they were a bit longer.  I like the leather instead of metal against my neck."
4.0,It was a gift and the product was well received by the person
4.0,"These are very nice glasses. Perfect for hanging by the pool. The shading of the lenses is just about perfect. Please note, there is no gold rim showing around the outside of the lenses. Very slick all around."
4.0,Good product ..
4.0,The gem stones were stunning but the setting itself was a bit flimsy.  I Returned them for that reason
4.0,Not for a serious collector but if you have a teen that's interested in mechanical watches it's a good start.  They are very nice looking and have a heavier feel than I expected.  They are labeled as a Swiss movement but I took off the back and the case said made in China.  Mine keeps decent time.  The knife is cheap and for show.  I wouldn't carry it.  Overall worth it for a gift but if you want to collect start with an antique Elgin from a reputable seller.
4.0,"Tight in chest area but I am 5'2, 117lbs with D cups. Ordered Small.  Also the blue portion of dress is way smaller and shorter. Im very meticulous to detail and it was not the same. Very similar, but not what was pictured. Its still doable."
4.0,I like the grips under the socks and the looks. They are gorgeous.  They are hard to get on because they are very tight.
4.0,"So this does not work for nose. Does not go on right at all, however does work great for an ear clip on when squeezed to fit."
4.0,Very soft and cozy. Seemed durable. Not really easy to tell what the heck it is tho. Maybe a frog??<br />Fit very well. 5.5’ small athletic build.
4.0,"Halloween costume got lots of compliments, wore it with black leggings and top"
4.0,Nought them for my niece.<br />She loved them good quality.<br />Plan to order more of the same.<br />In different colors and styles.
4.0,"it’s not that pretty of a dress, when the little bow is tied it lifts up a piece of fabric which shows your stomach, i wish they showed this on a model overrall it looks exactly like the picture"
4.0,"This is comfortable and fits all right. The arms are very tight, though. So if you have anything but stick arms, might not be the best for you. Unless you like sleeves to be tight and not be able to push it up your forearm."
4.0,Nicely sewn and love the design but should be labeled for tall sizes. It was more of a dress for me and not what I wanted.
4.0,I bought a size smaller than I normally wear and it feels too loose and too low to be tighter and still flattering
4.0,Quick delivery relatively speaking.  I really love these but just want to know what size cabochans I should use with them.  Other than that love these.
4.0,"The ring is pretty, exactly as pictured.  It is a little sharp on the edge - maybe they should round it off so it would be smoother.  I do appreciate the bonus ring you sent."
4.0,Neutral color
4.0,"Nice, well made pads."
4.0,i love this yoga pants they are very pretty but run a bit big
4.0,"Side pockets are a little small, well made, but I won't be buying them again."
4.0,I purchased this as a gift. He loved it.
4.0,"My daughter saw these glasses online and had to have them. They come well-packaged as you can see in the attached photos and include a lens cleaning cloth.<br /><br />There is one pair of women's glasses and one pair of men's glasses included in the package. The glasses are for someone with a bigger head than ours. The fit for us was just okay. The style is kind of retro and they do a good job of keeping the sun out of your eyes. My daughter and I tried them out on a road trip to NYC.<br /><br />I recommend trying to get them while on sale. Even so, full-price is $10 per pair of sunglasses - that is reasonable."
4.0,"It was too heavy to carry along with my oxygen concentrator back pack and the nasal cannula around my neck, it made me feel like I was suffocating I know but it might be great for people who are not on oxygen"
4.0,Nice socks but not really warm as advertised.
4.0,I bought this for a hip hop performance for my 8 year old son.  I was worried about some of the reviews I have seen about this product.  This item worked perfectly.  I do believe it is labeled as an adult hat but I highly doubt this would fit any living breathing adult with a normal size head.  It fit my son who is 8 and has a normal size head perfectly.  The quality is perfect.  It looks great.
4.0,Ratings were fine.  The box did not say Pandora like the fabric pouch the pendant came in.  But items were good
4.0,Super cute for St Patrick's day
4.0,wear shorts under the shorts its thin
4.0,"I like these a lot. Not too big and not too small. The design is a nice change from your typical stainless steel hoop earrings. The only bad thing was that one of the earrings arrived with the post clasp fully closed shut. At first I thought it was broken. So some tweaking had to be done and that was kind of a pain. But other then that, I am enjoying these immensely. Slight weight to these but nothing drastic."
4.0,"This jacket was nicely made and everything was great except the size ran much smaller than expected. I recommend ordering 1-2 Sizes Larger than what you typically wear. The Jacket was well constructed however please note the pockets are just decorative and not actual functional pockets. Same thing for the little Zipper accent on the Left sleeve. It is for decorative purposes only & does not work like a true pocket. Overall, it’s a cute Jacket to complete your casual outfit."
4.0,my granddaughter loved this gift
4.0,"Love it, makes putting on bracelets so much easier."
4.0,"Great first walker shoe. The elastic around the ankle is. Little too tight for my liking, but these are great shoes and they look so cute. Don't get them wet, though. They're not meant for any water or mud. They get really slick on the bottom and stiff when they dry."
4.0,"It’s a beautiful flowy skirt that is perfect for summer paired with a nice plain shirt or you can dress it up with a nice blouse and necklace for a night out. I love the elastic waist so it was felt comfortable. Perfect to wear after eating a meal with the stretchy waist. The material is a little staticky but overall it’s such a pretty design and quality was very good! I got a large, I’m 145 lbs. and 5’4 the size was perfect for me! The length though is too long if you’re wearing flats. I kept getting stuck since the skirt would get snagged everywhere. Might be good to wear with a little heel.  Good buy!"
4.0,Really cute. Vibrant colors. As nice as pictured. I think it runs a little large.
4.0,I boobs are somewhat small. Still Love it though! Very Flattering
4.0,This is a really attractive hat and I like it a lot on my smaller-headed friends.  It will not do for women with a large or XL head.<br />It is well made and will not fall apart with a couple of wearings.<br />It looks pretty enough for wearing with a casual dress.  I really like everything about it except the size.
4.0,"Did the job on test day. During practice tests it occasionally did not start when I pushed the knob back in, but I figured out before game day to just push it in harder.<br /><br />You could also avoid buying this by just using a regular watch; set it to 12 before starting each section."
4.0,It is a very nice strap but I need one a little bit bigger to get my wrist thru it comfortable.
4.0,Big Agnes always amazes me with their products. My wife and I love the bag. Its very warm and comfortable with pads installed. The only gripe I have is the zippers. Almost too small for the space of fabric it has to travel. Gets snagged easily while zipping and unzipping. If done slowly works great. We get to sleep like we do at home on the trail!!!
4.0,"I purchased this dress for an upcoming Luau. The dress is really cute and flattering on! Great buy for that event, but it does run small! I’m 5’8 150lbs, 34DD and had to buy an extra large."
4.0,"These aren't too bad for the price- I really would have liked to have given a 3.5 rating, but there isn't a '.5' option.<br /><br />They do appear to be real pearls and sterling silver as advertised. One thing to know is that the pearl and sterling silver connectors do appear smaller in proportion to the hook part that goes in your ear. I'd say one entire earring, from bottom of the pearl to the curve of the hook, is just about an inch.<br /><br />The pearls themselves were okay. The only thing I can really complain about is that they weren't round. In fact, they had a slightly ""squashed"" appearance; there was definitely a side that was more flat. But since pearls are not manufactured, that could just be unique to the pair I received.<br /><br />Still, they're quite dainty, and rather beautiful.<br /><br />The presentation is rather nice as well. I received the blue satchel, with the box and earrings inside.<br /><br />Over all, it's not a bad item at all, and actually makes a nice gift (which is why I purchased them). But depending on exactly how choosy you are about jewelry, this may or may not be the item for you."
4.0,It fits great because it’s adjustable to the width of baby’s feet.
4.0,Love the earrings but they're a little delicate. The clasp bends easily.
4.0,"Sizing was good, shirt super soft. Only thing I didn’t like was it had spandex in it and it did not state that in the description. I probably would have passed on it as I was looking for cotton only so it wouldn’t cling to my mid section which it did a bit."
4.0,Runs a little small. Works well and can be reworn.
4.0,my grandbaby is 4 months and still wears them - super cute
4.0,"Love it, perfect for my daughter"
4.0,This is really cute but I must have flattish ankles.  It fits with a little movement but one or two more cm would have been great.
4.0,These socks are a little tight around the toes but I will probably continue to use them to protect the sheets from foot moisturizing lotion.
4.0,"My son's really liked these belts for Christmas. Unfortunately,  we have already lost the retaining loop.  Overall a good belt."
4.0,"I felt I should add another data point with regard to the sizing since there seems to be ongoing confusion. I have a 30&#34; waist and ordered “US Small / Asia Tag Medium.” They fit perfectly.<br /><br />Be aware that the pockets are almost completely useless. It makes me nervous to even have my keys in them if I’m on my bike or sitting down. But with the shorts themselves being as short as they are, what can we expect?<br /><br />Otherwise, they’re just great. I might even order more."
4.0,Great shirt. I get a lot of compliments. Negative only is the neck line is wider than I thought it would be . Still awesome though.
4.0,I like how it has a plastic lining for dirty clothes that won't effect the material just a quick wipe down
4.0,The cup area is somewhat small but the straps are very long.
4.0,"This is a really great suit and great quality.  My only two complaints: the fabric is not super soft like a rash guard and it did seems to maybe feel hot if its really really hot outside.  Also, if baby is wearing, it doesn't try quickly; however, take him out and fold it over your chair and it does great.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this suit for your LO if you aren't quite ready to put sunscreen on them.  We live at the beach and started our baby out in this at three months.  It worked great! And it's super cute.  Also fits really well and I LOVE the zipper at the bottom.  Super easy for diaper changes and for a quick switch from diaper to swimmie."
4.0,"Love the luggage, can't wait to use them. Only thing was one of the locks was active now we can't lock it since we dont know the codes or to deactivate the lock."
4.0,"Super light ,great for summer weather and comfortable. Runs small order up a size."
4.0,They are very cute. A little hard to put on at first.
4.0,This is very large.. however still cute. The lace is soft on the skin as well.
4.0,These worked great for my son’s constant untied shoe laces. Eventually he’ll need to learn how to keep them tied but this works until then.
4.0,"The band is great.  I ordered one from another seller prior that felt cheap, but this one is better quality.  Well worth it!"
4.0,The fabric is thick.  It is a very comfortable throw on to bring to the pool.
4.0,Was for my daughter fits great
4.0,"It is to little, It looked bigger, you should have said the size on the ordering page, Thanks anyway."
4.0,this is a gift. looks like she would like it
4.0,They look exactly like they appear but they are smaller than I imagined.
4.0,"this is on a black lace narrow scarf with a funny shade of green trim, not as it appears in this photo, it is okay but NOT a pale olive"
4.0,"The stone and inspiring card are very nice.  Pleased with my order for two stones.  Only reason I gave four stars is because I think they could be just a little less expensive. But, would order again."
4.0,I ordered this in a medium so I could shrink it down but the medium was a bit larger than I expected. It didnt look exactly how I expected. Its definitely very fuzzy and soft which is nice but not exactly what I was looking for. Still cute so I still wear it and very warm.
4.0,perfect just what I was looking for fits great in my car
4.0,War Eagle!
4.0,"The material of this blazer is of good quality, but unfortunately I had to return it because it's a bit tight."
4.0,"The second strap loop broke immediately, but since there are two it hasn't been a problem. There's no second hand, but there are lines for every minute. It is easy to change the time on the watch and it is very stylish."
4.0,"Because of foot problems, I have to wear shoes all the time to support my feet. These are warm and comfortable to wear with Teva flip-flops during the winter indoors. They're a bit thinner than I expected, so not sure they would be very warm outdoors. Overall, I love them and intend to buy some more."
4.0,"First things first, the shirt fits almost nothing like it does in the picture. The neckline is not as “scooped” as it seems and the straps are thicker than pictured. That being said, it’s still a wonderful shirt. I was just hoping for a scooped neck with thinner straps. I am not a fan of the very thick strapped sleeveless shirts. For that reason alone, I give it 4 out of 5 stars—simply because the shirt isn’t exactly as pictured.<br />It is quite see thru despite having a decent thickness to it, which is odd. So pair accordingly—either use it as a swim suit cover up or make sure to wear something appropriate underneath.<br />I got an XL and it fits How I would expect, even on the roomier side. I am 5’8 and tend to float between an XL and a L, and I would say this top is a looser XL. This type of material isn’t very forgiving, so if you are wanting a more flattering and looser top then I would suggest to size up.<br />It’s a very soft material and very comfortable to wear in hot weather.<br />I especially love the length, which is something I often struggle with. This top has more than enough length for me, I am not finding myself constantly tugging.<br />If you are looking for a nice and comfortable summer tank top that will keep you cool, this is it!"
4.0,I normally wear a size 14 and I ordered a 2x.....it fit perfectly.
4.0,"For me this is a little too light.  One might call it flimsy, but it is pretty and can compliment the right outfit.  It is just for looks - it wouldn't offer any warmth.  Colorful, and could be worn with jeans or a skirt or dress.  Kind of a fun article to have in my closet."
4.0,Purchase these about a year ago still good. So far no problem tough and durable. I worked rescue for the fire department. I’ve worked in different climates. I need shorts that can take it. The material can stand up to just about anything.
4.0,The shoes are cute.<br />That's all I have to say
4.0,I like this product I just don’t understand the price.<br /><br />SPF clothing are made mostly of spandex and polyester so why is it so pricey?
4.0,Nice shorts great material
4.0,Thinner than expected but looks good.
4.0,Most of the rings worked. A few were broken but they came quickly and everyone at my wedding was excited to use them!
4.0,"Super cute dress- the shell is thin and blue, but there is a lining underneath. The seams hold up well and the fabric is light and comfortable. The only downside is that the arms and skirt fall a little high on the body, but I'm 5'10&#34; and and a 34DD, so my legs and arms stick out and it's a little tight in the chest. it's cute for hanging out or for an event, but I wouldn't wear it to work unless it were longer."
4.0,"I really like the quality and great colors of the eyeglass chains, but hope to find out how to get more of the fasteners that prevent the chains from slipping off the arms, or temples, of the glasses that hook over the ear."
4.0,"Tall Man here 6'4&#34;, 34&#34; inseam. These are too short to be worn normally for me but I wear the foot loop around my calves and they work fine"
4.0,The number 5 was loose in the dial.I brought it to the jeweler to have it fixed. It's a nice looking watch.
4.0,"These are not as good as my Oakleys, but they do their job (and at a much lower price).  I used them while playing ultimate frisbee and they never fell off my face.  They blocked the glare pretty decently.  Only thing I wish I could change about them was the lack of a snug fit.  The arms felt like they stuck out the side of my head like wings because of the rounded shape.  And the lens felt too wide (same rounded effect).  But overall, if you're the type of person that buys cheaper glasses because you lose or damage them all the time then these are a great pair to own.  Good quality for the price."
4.0,"Cool Shades! The lack of a bulky clip is a nice feature and the frame looks great. Wish the &#34;up&#34; position was a little higher. You can bend the metal to accomplish this, but in the &#34;down&#34; position they will wiggle around a bit."
4.0,"The detailing on these are decent but they are a bit light and fragile-feeling. Still, for the price, they're cute and fairly brilliant."
4.0,Great material and comfortable
4.0,Stylish. Nice colors. Lightweight. Have a small that fits good. Could have also likely been okay with a medium. Polyester type fabric. NOT African Ankara.
4.0,My grandson liked the shoes.
4.0,"Very pretty, made well!"
4.0,I love it. Very pretty the top of the dress is black it does not come with the belt and the weird part is the bottom has so many colors EXCEPT black. Overall the dress is still pretty and I'm going to keep it
4.0,"Nice material, beautiful colors. I bought coral and purple in XXXL. That was RECCOMENED by company and other customers. I am 5'7&#34;,225pounds, 36DDD/38DD.Now I am not sure that's correct size for me. Feels huge. It's fit very well on top,swings free from bust down. It's nice that cover any imperfections in the middle section, you can't see any bumps front and back,but still the whole siluet is kinda huge,very loose fit.Feels very comfortable, but still debating if I must switch them for XXL.I ordered Kelly green in smaller size,so will see how will fit and update my review .Hoping to help somebody with this information."
4.0,Was looking for some water proof slip ons and that is what these are. Not the most comfortable but do what they are meant to do.
4.0,Nice bracelet. I have gotten a couple complements.
4.0,"I was surprised at the shirt - much dressier than I thought if would be, but I am keeping it anyway.  Pearl buttons are larger than I thought they would be.  Haven't worn yet - so can't tell if I will actually like it."
4.0,"These are great legging the colors are vibrant and the material soft.  I bought them to compare  with my LuLaRoe and though they do have some differances, however, I feel these are a better value."
4.0,"Based on the picture,I thought it would be darker than it is . It is still pretty ."
4.0,"This is a nice traditional blazer with button. The color is a blue/green. It can be worn with slacks, jeans or a dress. It looks great with navy, gray and black. And finally, it fits as expected. I’d recommend it."
4.0,"Purchased as a gift for my friend. Quality was good, but the item took forever to arrive. Worth the wait, I feel."
4.0,"I needed a dress for a funeral. So since I didn’t have a ton of time, and thanks to prime shipping I bought a couple to try. This one was my favorite.<br /><br />Upon taking it out of the bag I looked at it and thought this is never going to fit, it looked small. But the fabric is stretchy so I figured I’ll try it on anyways. And I am glad I did. It fits like a glove. I ordered a xxl. I’m a 14/16 38 B. I was skeptical that it was going to be too small but it was perfect. I haven’t worn it yet my event is in a few days. But it is very comfy and stretchy. I’m about 5 foot 7 and it hits slightly below my knees and the sleeves are just past the crook of my elbow. I have a feeling this will become a staple in my closet. It was fitting and flattering.<br /><br />Definitely nicer then I anticipated."
4.0,Cute but very thin and clingy. The bottom of the dress/shirt rides up all the time even though it fits well.
4.0,"Very cute, just wish there was a little more support in the bra area."
4.0,"Good product, easy to replace old one.should probably give two screw drivers to make it easier"
4.0,good fit good quality.....happy happy
4.0,I wish this could have been ordered  separately.  I think an xl top and med bottomed would have worked better for me.
4.0,I bought it a size bigger but I didn't need to. I fits well.
4.0,Good product! It seems to be of decent quality and have gotten compliments on it while wearing it.
4.0,"Good hat, warm, good for high pony."
4.0,Its very pretty . The colors are slightly off though. My main problem is the chain is much shorter than I expected. It fits its just a little too short and would be better for a child
4.0,"This was supposed to be a white dial watch, and the dial is silver. It doesn't match the picture."
4.0,Looks nice and feels great. Perfect cover up for the office.
4.0,"This goldtone stainless steel watch looks great. The watch itself is larger than most, 1.45&#34; wide, making it easy to see the time. It is waterproof and the movement is quarts. The the band is made of alloy and is quite pretty.  I am very happy with this product.<br /><br />&#34; I received this product at a discount for an honest and unbiased review. &#34;"
4.0,"I gave it to my wife for Christmas because she loves Texas, just hopefully not enough to make us move there. Too damn hot and humid for this guy, and with all the illegal immigration going on that sucks. The star on the necklace was a bit smaller than I thought it would be but she said it was great, she doesn’t like big hanging jewelry anyway. If I went back in time I would still buy it for her the way it turned out. GOD BLESS TEXAS"
4.0,"Love this shirt. Ordered a mens small for my daughter who wears a womans medium. I could have ordered a medium and it would have fit well, seems the shirt may run a tad small."
4.0,"Love it, my old one broke after about 6 months heavy use so I picked up a new one"
4.0,Keeps u ohhh so warm. Gift hubby and he love it. Then i gift myself because i found myself using hubbies lol great for the winter.
4.0,"Typically order Large but due to the reviews I ordered a 2xl. It was too big so sent it back for the XL. It was perfect. My only challenge is I really wanted the green but both times they shipped me black. Oh well, I like the shirt so will keep it."
4.0,"More 'blush' colored than rose gold, but still nice."
4.0,"These aren't kid size, but they do fit me an average size adult face.  So far I like them just by trying them on."
4.0,Very pleased with these and love the visibility that they offer. The only thing I notice is the upper part of the goggle is really tight on my eyes. I've loosened them as much as possible but it didn't make a difference.
4.0,"Everything good for now, waiting to see how it holds up after some usage"
4.0,I bought this as a gift for my aunt and she LOVED it! Stylish and pretty. I'm very happy I got it. 😀
4.0,Love how thin it is. It runs smaller than my other Nikes of the same size. The material is rougher than I expected & I'm hoping it will soften with a few washes since I do not use softener on any performance wear. It strains a bit over my bust (H).
4.0,"I liked them! They look really good, but it was impossible to put them on! :( so i had to return them"
4.0,I like these but they get caught in my hair.
4.0,This was a pleasant surprise... red color is really nice and it’s just an easy dress.
4.0,The shirt tail is very long.
4.0,"Way less bulky than a standard wallet.  You'll have to pick which cards to carry since it won't hold as much, but that's sort of the point.  I have six cards (including ID), cash and insurance cards and it can still fit easily in my front pocket."
4.0,Excellent fit and good quality
4.0,Runs large.  Recommend getting a size smaller than you think
4.0,These large sized retro woman's sunglass look good and sit on my girlfriends face well. Lenses are a smokey polarized type that are ok but good.  Is a bit heavy and the nose pads do press into bridge of nose a bit.
4.0,Love these! They took awhile to get but we’re worth the wait!
4.0,"Very pretty, but they don't do well in the wash. I suggest an easy cycle and hang dry."
4.0,"I thought the dress was a good fit. I’m 5’1 and it was a little long on me, but still cute."
4.0,"Very very long. Heavy material, formal feeling to it. Not very good for casual wearing"
4.0,Watch is very nice looking and my husband liked the ease of only one button function.the only problem is that the expansion band is very small. It was too tight for my husband's wrist which is not large and we had to return it
4.0,Comfortable but not for super cold days.
4.0,I would have loved this jacket if I could have worn it.  Super jumbo wasn't a sizing option.
4.0,The print is gorgeous and the cut was great but the fabric clings no matter how large you order it. It just hangs heavy and clingy and is kind of cheap-y. Way too hot for summer. If you're looking for something flowwy - don't choose this dress.
4.0,"Great Value, Great Quality, just need NEW size chart/conversion chart. Recommend going up a size or two. Very small and I have average height slim children. I still went up a size based on other comments and still were VERY TIGHT. GREAT PRODUCT QUALITY JUST HORRIBLE SIZE/CONVERSION CHART."
4.0,"plz don't tell my sister, they were for her birthday, but i couldn't resist.  i gave it a 4 b/c  of it's frailty, but the price was great."
4.0,Beautiful bracelet!  I found it a bit wide to be comfortable which wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't a touch too big. I do have small wrists though.
4.0,It was just a little to small to size
4.0,"Stylish and unique. Only problem is keeping large amounts of money in place with this wallet which can be a hassle, but if you are the type to cary only 1-3 bills and you mainly pay credit/debit, this should be a definite buy."
4.0,My daughter looked amazing in this dress. They wore it for church. Only thing is it's long and kept getting caught on a pair of shimmery white shoes.
4.0,"Very comfortable shoes. Great for running, best kicks for the money"
4.0,"The material feels good and they haven't made my feet sweat. They would get 5 stars for the price they are sold at if I didn't have to always adjust them. I bought these strictly for at-home use, so it's not that big of a deal. If I planned to wear these out and about, and I couldn't wear them."
4.0,"Love it, I want more!!! the length of the chain is perfect, A MUST BUY!!"
4.0,finaly a real medium can use these.
4.0,"Nice little ear cuff, pretty much as shown, I love it.  It seems cheap and flimsy, but you don't really want it to be heavier or it would weigh down your ear.  The packaging it came in was inexcusable however.  a little envelope with all the bubbles popped?  Really?  The shaft came bent but I was able to bend it back.  I would have been more than willing to pay a little more for it to come better packaged."
4.0,"My 1 year old LOVES these and wants to wear them at every opportunity. They are not designed to be worn outside, or walked on too much, so if they're used for anything outside of the crib, just expect them to wear out fairly quickly. But, at this price point, does it really matter? Maybe 4 months wear out of them so far before they started fraying - not bad."
4.0,Easy install.  Looks Great!
4.0,"Nice fit, and it looks good too!"
4.0,It fits & works. Unfortunately my son got scared at the monster truck jam that he kept moving to the point where the earmuffs kept falling off. He's young.
4.0,"These are some nice fitting, well made jeans from Denim Garage. I love the deep front pockets and the straight leg fit. The material is a good weight, heavier than those with more stretch. It's more like the old, 100% cotton jeans that you can't find anymore.<br /><br />I could live without the torn knees and over-broke-in look, but it's the style now. I hope that the jeans don't have a shorter life because of it. At nearly $80, I'd like to think they'd last."
4.0,My husband loved the shirts for working in the sun in Florida heat did a fairly good job keeping him cool. However it stains really easily and the stains seem difficult to remove. You’d never think that with the way the material feel but after work i have To use some oxi clean to pretreat it to get dirt out
4.0,This house shoe is so cute and my son loves it! It’s a bit large on his foot but he will grow into it. Nice solid material.
4.0,A nice look but the material is a little stiff.
4.0,"I was very scared to order this as it has no reviews. But the quality is not bad, the size is ok. I am not sure how long it will last though. Warning: the packaging is not optiomal and a little part of the pattern sticked to itself and have been damaged during the unboxing<br />Also, the necklace is very cheap"
4.0,"Looks pretty nice, and i havent had the shoes for long so idk how they will hold up in the long run, but so far they are pretty good<br /><br />Mine are 11.5 and fitted pretty well and for the price, you should totally get them"
4.0,One headpiece broke down in the wash. Handle with care!
4.0,Thought it might be a little softer but is great for the price. My 15 year old daughter loves it.
4.0,Better quality than I expected. Color was beautiful. Material was not thin nor see through. I gave this 4* because my only complaint is the ruffle on the top doesn't allow a lot of give for raising your arms. If they added more material to make it ruffle / flow more on the top it would be perfect.
4.0,"I like these shorts, light weight and cool to touch and wear. For biking, walking or even watching tv."
4.0,"These look cool and are of good quality.  I have been sporting them for months now, with no complaints.  I don't wear them daily, but when I do I find them comfortable and well fitted."
4.0,"This is a beautiful top and very comfortable. I have never felt so stylish with such little effort before... perfect for my trip to Italy! I took one star away for the color... it looks more deep grey, almost dark violet online, and in reality it's more of a light grey, but I still love it. A great purchase!"
4.0,The color is exactly as described.  Material is soft and true to size.
4.0,I actually like these shoes.
4.0,"Wig was fantastic. Stayed in place all night, thanks to adjustable straps inside the wig cap.  Not much shedding and higher quality than expected. The wig shipped from US vendor, so I didn't have to wait weeks for it to arrive. Received several compliments on the wig, a few people even asked if my hair was real."
4.0,"This is a cute dress. It's higher quality than I was expecting, all of the seams are solid and a dress isn't sheer. It did run a little big, but the overall look is very feminine and pretty."
4.0,Very nice for its price!
4.0,"Cuff, should have read reviews.  But I cut off back ball and used a post back to make it work."
4.0,"Great shirt, wish the picture was a little clearer in person. overall a great shirt"
4.0,"This bracelet is made from good quality lapis, uniformly sized and polished. It arrived attractively packaged with care and would make an excellent gift. It's a bit too snug on my 6 3/4"" wrist. I wish it were a little larger but perhaps the elastic cord will loosen with wear."
4.0,"i love love it,"
4.0,Looked nice didn't fit me
4.0,muy buena calidad y talla super bien
4.0,There nice shades a little too tight for me.
4.0,"Update: I bought the sweater as a small, it for much better. Except I forgot and put it in the dryer. It's hairier looking now and a bit shorter in the arms. But I'll just stretch them out. The buttons are not holding up to well, I'll shave to sew them on better. I""m 28 years old, 5'7"" 140lbs, 34D, and usually wear Medium or Large shirts and jackets. I typically go Large because I have broad shoulders a bit of a mommy tummy. I got the gray sweater with the brown buttons in Large and it is big. It covers my butt, the v neck is just over my belly button and overall makes me look like a fat old lady. I'm not a fan of the buttons, But I would still wear this is it was a bit more fitted, I LOVE over sized sweaters, but not in this fashion.  Returning for a size down."
4.0,It was really comfortable just not as long as I thought it would be.
4.0,"Perfect Halloween costume for my significant other. Wear clothes up under because the material is thin, he looked fine with a pair of shorts and white t shirt under."
4.0,Cute.  Lots of compliments!
4.0,"These shoes are very cute, but run a full size small in my opinion. I am returning for a larger size."
4.0,"Despite the inaccuracies of the size chart, I was able to use the information provided by other customers to find the correct size for me.  I am 5'4&#34; ,170 lbs, have broad shoulders, a positive ape index, and a generally large frame.  I usually wear a US size 14 and found that the XL shirt fits me just fine.  The cuffs are faux French.  You button the cuff and then fold the cuff over.  Note that these are not real French cuffs and cannot be used with cufflinks.  However, I plan to remove the buttons and cut a slit in each cuff so that I can wear my cufflinks.  Good price for the shirt."
4.0,"I absolutely love this bag, it's the perfect size for me. I wish I could get another in Black but it looks like the company discontinued this model. I got one of the last dark green ones, which goes well with everything color-wise."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:c00536a031089a270c567f676bf9a934]] These shoes are a size 9. I am a size 8 1/2 wide (W). If you generally wear a wide like I do, and are a half size, I would suggest sizing up. The width of the shoe is definitely not the problem. The arch is so minimal, I think those who do have an arch would find these slip on shoes somewhat too big (in my opinion). The only concern I have with these slip on shoes is the material folded on the inside of the shoe, underneath the seam. This is located at the heel. The seam is folded inward and a very small piece of fabric beneath the seam irritates my skin with or without socks. The fold of that panel lifts while I am mobile. Whenever I lift my feet off the group, the panel follows. This irritates my skin to where it feels like a blister will form. My forth attempt in these shoes, I had to switch out. The shoes hurt my heel too much. There was too much friction. I'm looking for ways to minimize this, so if you have any suggestions as to what I could do, I will appreciate them. Other than that, the fit is extremely comfortable. The sole of the shoe is about an inch and a half in length, and will add height so keep that in mind. The cat print on the front side of the shoe is even more pigmented in person. The video I provided for references does the cat print no justice. There is no irritation on the inside of the shoe behind the tongue or the elastic. The fold you see in the front of my shoe is from walking. It really depends how you walk if you're worried about a &quot;fold&quot; creating in the front of the slip on shoe (the fold is not from the shoe being tight. like I said it is comfortable and loosely fitted in the slightest, especially for someone who wears a wide (W), generally). Overall, besides the panel lifting from beneath the seam inside the shoe, everything else seems to be spot on and perfect! I love these shoes, and YRU never disappoints when it comes to beautiful and unique shoes.<br />There was no product guarantee during the time of my purchase.

4.0,My 9 year old Grandson lost a hat on a trip and I replaced with this one.  He Loves it.
4.0,Will have to wait till next year to see it on my granddaughters foot. She has little feet. She measures an size 8 but the shoe is too big.
4.0,These are good socks but way too expensive.  Just got them because this is what my son wanted and he loved elite socks!
4.0,Thes almost look like silk pajamas when you first get them but once you put the jacket on and zip it up it really is cute and worked perfectly for our costumes. Even my 18 month old loved her little outfit. I’d buy it again.
4.0,Beautiful dress that fits just the way you wanted.  Nice and comfortable  material
4.0,"Fits a small ladies wrist. I can't tell if the metal is real or if it's plastic coated to look like metal. But for under $5, it's a inexpensive piece that looks really nice and compliments an outfit well."
4.0,Loose fit<br />Cotton<br />Got at a deal for below $5<br /><br />Value for money
4.0,"They are good for the money, but..... as far as scratch resistant goes.... they are only average."
4.0,great product would buy again
4.0,Fir great but the fringe is tangled all the time
4.0,"So far, so Good."
4.0,I love the dress but it just not work for me. I’m on the fuller figured side and it was not flattering on me.
4.0,"Pros:<br />✔ Lightweight material is perfect for hot, summer days. Shields the sun without being too hot.<br />✔ Collar seam is turned under for better comfort<br />✔ Plenty of room in the arms<br />✔ Labeled either for conventional dry cleaning, or you can cold wash, hang dry, medium iron.<br />✔ Perfect for layering over a summer tank<br />Cons:<br />✘ Tag says 100% cotton and website says cotton/flax.  Feels like there is flax in it, it isn't soft like most cotton<br />✘ Runs quite small. Based on purchasing a men's XXL, it is more like a men's L or a women's XL.  I can wear it loose but it would be too tight if the buttons were closed.  If it is dry cleaned, then it probably won't shrink. Washing it at home is more likely to cause shrinking, and that's why it must be in cold water, and hang dry. Order accordingly!<br />✘It WILL require you to iron it, that's just how the fabric is.  If you don't like that, well, now you know!<br />✘ The shirt wrinkles during the day as you wear it. I get lots of them on the back when I drive the car. It’s like a linen shirt that way.<br />.<br />This shirt is interesting in the way that the color looks so different when the lighting changes. When I first saw it, I saw chartreuse!  In another room, it looked light green. In another, a pale mint.  It's my chameleon shirt!  :D  All of the sewing was complete on this- no missed spots. There were some extra threads to trim- no big deal. If it matters to you, know that other than the collar, seams are serged. The sleeves and bottom shirt edge are hemmed.  I hope that this review helps you in your decision. Do let me know, and happy shopping!"
4.0,Easy to buckle and holds my pants up well.
4.0,Matching earrings for shirt.
4.0,nice material but a little big
4.0,Yo compré 5-5.5 para mi baby de 15 meses que usa la size 5 y le quedó pero son un poco ancho para el oue de mi baby que tiene pie delgadito están lindos y suavecitos los recomiendo
4.0,A Christmas gift for my daughter-in-law.
4.0,"These glasses are definitely sized for a man!  I am a plus size girl, and they are too wide for my face.  The glasses are beautiful and work well.  Since I bought them for night  or rainy driving and I will not likely wear them except in the car, they are ok.  If they were a pair of sunglasses, they would not be comfortable to wear."
4.0,I like the length and the way it fits. Just as I expected. The only thing I did not like is that the fabric is lighter than I expected.
4.0,To long will have to adjust without ruining the print.
4.0,This was a birthday gift for my daughter and  we are mostly pleased with it. It spins perfectly and looks exactly like it's photo here. The chain that comes with it leaves much to be desired though. It's very thin and the length should be a little longer.
4.0,Had to cut the little ball on the end so that I could get it into the slot.
4.0,Really love the glasses and wear them almost every day. Maybe that’s why the colors are coming off?
4.0,"Not nearly as high contrast as shown (especially the one in the back ground there in their main picture). I love the design, you just can't appreciate it in the real world lighting. The photo shoot definitely highlights the colors in a way you won't ever get in the real world."
4.0,It is nice. Looks exactly like the picture. I bought for my teenage sister. It came sooner than I expected and in good packaging. I would recommend this product!
4.0,"Very pretty, but the size M fits a size US 6 not an US 8. If I loose about 3-5 pounds it will be fine; otherwise, a bit tight"
4.0,Great lightweight sweater. Fits great!
4.0,Get a bigger size. Cute dress
4.0,Thanks ! Good!
4.0,"I was disappointed to find out that the hat is a crushable hat, it was not described as a crushable.. however, it took a custom shape and held it very well.. Other than it being slightly larger in size and it being crushable, I like the hat very much and wear it very often.."
4.0,I like the top but it is too long . May I return
4.0,These were cute & very small. You could not even see them in my ears so that is why I returned them. They gave me a prompt refund.
4.0,"This is a very pretty dress.  I'm busty and think the top is a bit to busy for me.  However, it would look beautiful on a smaller person.  I gave this dress a 4 only because I ordered it in purple and it was really sky blue."
4.0,Good sock initially. Seems to be wearing in the heal faster than expected.
4.0,"I want a light weight robe and I felt like it was just to big and bulky for me. The material was good quality, would need watching first to soften it up. The color was good to. Size was good also."
4.0,A little hard to get on at first but after doing it a couple of times it gets easier.
4.0,I had to hem it since I am 5 ft tall.  It was a good fit thru the shoulder but too loose thru the rest of the dress.  A more Aline silhouette would be nicer.  I like the material but have not washed it yet.  Paired it with a jacket and wore it to church.
4.0,I thought this was a girls bathing suit not a Womans . The title was misleading. I bought for my daughter but I’m gonna keep it for myself
4.0,Cute. Larger than I thought. Kinda heavy. Long bar to fit through the ear and easily connect.
4.0,Masks protect others.  Visors help protect you.  Use both.  This is a tinted visor that's good for day walking here in sunny SoCal. It rolls up so it's good for take-along.  Handy. Useful.  Utilitarian.  Stay safe.
4.0,"Spikes are great for the sloping area I am re-planting.  However, the tabi is not as comfortable as I would like.  I may need tabi socks to prevent chafing between my toes."
4.0,"Great detail and features, just not insanely durable"
4.0,It's a very nice shirt. It is not entirely fleece is more like a little thicker hard fleece. But in a very nice way :) I am surprised.<br />I wish it could have a pocket but still looks nice.<br />I regularly am a Small but had to order an XXL size because of previous reviews. It fits fine just a little loose. But I guess it will shrink a bit after washing it.
4.0,"I ordered this flip flops because I have an almost identical pair that I love and that I bought locally on sale at Sports Authority.  I am a woman, and these are, allegedly, men's. I am woman's size 8',  so I ordered men's size 7. (The flip flops do not have any mark indicating size)<br /><br />To my surprise, these did not fit. These are more like women's size 7, so I have them to a girlfriend whose size is  6 ½ to 7.<br /><br />So, please be aware of this. Size 7 is actually size 6 1/2-7 for a woman or men's size 6.<br /><br />Besides that, these are good quality. I will order again in a bigger size."
4.0,"Cute shirt, but runs on smaller side. Not as long as expected either."
4.0,Color and picture is spot on! Pretty dress unfortunately it fits quite big and I wear size M should
4.0,My dad was opening it and when he tried it on it was kinda falling off his face but when I put them on it does not. If you have a small face don’t get but if you have wide face it’s fine.
4.0,"I am giving this top a 4 star rating because it is very well made.  Soft & comfortable.  Be aware that it does run small though.  I ordered my size, XL, and it fit more like a L.  If ordering, order a size larger for good fit unless you like it more snug.  Would have ordered the next size up with no problem, but it wasn't an option."
4.0,They seem to be a good quality hip boot so far. I have used them once.<br />They were large as compared to the shoe size I ordered. Got a 13. Wish I had ordered a 12.
4.0,"This is a beautiful, comfortable top. I LOVE the fabric. The only reason I took off a star is because it arrived slightly damaged. See photo."
4.0,"The glasses were supposed to be for a adult, it was too small for a normal size adult. Not sure if this was a childs size, or the country who manufactured this product has small malnourished people designing this product."
4.0,Love the shirt but had to wait a long time before delivery. I have purchased numerous items recently but only this one was delayed. Other than that live the shirt.
4.0,"xxL jogging pants (Jordan brand) are usually a little baggy got these in xxL just incase so there a little bigger. Too tight, really tight good quality tho !"
4.0,"The bra itself fits nicely, but the back lacey part is a tad small. Quality is great though!"
4.0,I love the look and size of this wallet. I only wish the magnet was a bit stronger to keep it closed.
4.0,Great except for the one size fits all issue - the length of the collar stays that it produces are a tad too long for some of my shirts and require some trimming. Otherwise awesome and fun too!!
4.0,The color is amazing. The material is high quality and fits like a glove.
4.0,See through on the boob area
4.0,"If you’re reading this review,  what you really want to know is, “should I buy this?”. The answer is yes and here’s why.<br /><br />Depending on how old you are your scarves to this point have fallen into 2 main categories. 1) the knit kind that scream nan made me this, it’s warm and I like it. 2) This is my grownup scarf because it doesn't look like Nana knitted it. In my experience, neither of these works for a “dressier” occasion or when you need a sophisticated look. Enter this scarf. It looks right at home with a jacket, a suit or just a night out with friends. What I really appreciate about this scarf is unlike other so called classy scarves, this is is actually long. 70 inches long to be exact and boy is what a welcome difference. In the past, everytime I found myself in a situation where I needed to wear a scarf with, say, a suit, the scarf was so short that it felt like I was wearing one that belonged to one of my kids. It’s also a nice middle to light weight scarf. It’s not going to keep you warm during a blizzard, but it’s also not going to feel like you have a space heater around your neck if you keep it around your neck when you’re inside.  I also like the fact that for the price this is surprisingly well made and honestly quite soft. The fact that it’s 49% cotton, 40% viscose and 11% cashmere means it’s not scratchy at all. As for cleaning it, it says to hand wash or to wash in the gentle cycle in cold water. Squeeze gently but do not twist (feel free to insert your own joke here). Tumble dry or lay flat to dry. Don’t use bleach, hot water or vinegar (yes, it really says that). I’m a bit concerned about the “twisting” thing since it’s mentioned several times but I guess we shall see what happens. All in all this seems like it’s going to be a nice piece to have around. Is it going to last me for decades to come? Absolutely not. Not for now, it will more than serve its purpose.<br /><br />If you’re still on the fence about getting this, hop on down and buy it now.<br /><br />Do I recommend it? Yes<br /><br />Emoji rating: 😀😀😀😀<br /><br />Hey, thanks for taking the time to read this review, I really hope it helped. Cheers!<br /><br />Make Life Fun!"
4.0,"This scarf was well made, nice pattern and the pockets as described. If you’re a scarf person ( I’m not) you’ll probably love it. The thing is - I found it heavy and the pockets hard to find. This could be easily rectified with a bit of string. My phone was way too heavy. And to be honest - I tend to travel in warm/hot countries so the scarf would be useless. Most cold places I go to ( Iceland) are very safe. Even going to American cities in winter - I have a Fanny pack which I always wear. So  that’s why I returned it. But it is a lovely scarf"
4.0,"it looks pretty but I thought I was getting a right and a left,why only one ear?"
4.0,These shorts are great! Obviously very short and they ride a bit. Good quality though.
4.0,Nice and soft. A bit roomy. Heavy weight.
4.0,"Great little tank.  I love the studded mushroom, and it fits well (i'm a medium and ordered a medium)."
4.0,"I am a size 16, busty and the XL fit. My dark grey is more light grey, but real pretty. The sleeves are not loose, on the snug side. If you have real  big arms it may be tight. The bottom is very wide. I easily took it in with my sewing machine though not super necessary. The ruffles do not have finished edges and do fray when washed. They are meant to be unfinished I believe. The fraying stops. Snip off threads after washing a few times and wash delicate, inside out. Super cute lightweight cotton/poly blend."
4.0,"A little hard on my toes (little blisters), but I think they will soften up. The padding is perfect. I have a narrow foot, so fit well. I would think these would be very tight on a normal foot, however.<br />I use these for Bollywood and like how they stay on. I have had trouble with other footwear coming off when doing Bollywood. Not these."
4.0,"The current most helpful review (dated October 6, 2020) discusses whether the Wigwam socks they received are fake. The reviewer points out 5 items: wrong packaging, wrong material/fabric, no logo, no “vents”, wrong stitching.<br /><br />I saw this review and decided to purchase some new socks directly from Wigwam. The socks I received were somewhat different from the Wigwam socks I purchased 4 years ago on Amazon. The latest ones don't have a logo and don't have ""vents"". It appears that Wigwam has changed their manufacturing process, so I wouldn't use those as arguments that the socks are fake.<br /><br />On the other hand, the socks I received from Wigwam socks are 83% cotton, 16% polyester and 1% stretch nylon, which matches Amazon's description. The socks the other reviewer received were 86% cotton and 14% stretch nylon. So that's definitely different and *might* be an argument that their socks were fake.<br /><br />Conclusion: it can be hard to know if the articles we receive are genuine. That's troubling and I wish there was a way we could be more certain."
4.0,Easy to wear whether you’re a man or a woman. Versatile and simplistic.<br />It doesn’t necessarily look luxurious but for the price and its role is perfect.
4.0,I'm 5ft1 and these are long for me I have to alter them... the fabric is soft and comfy it easily molds to your body shape.. something to think about if you are looking for something modest.
4.0,"Love this dress,  runs a bit small but it will work."
4.0,My wife loves these earrings.The only downfall is that they don't have screw on backs.These are beautiful earrings.Thanks for a nice product.
4.0,It was much bigger than I thought. I had to sew it and make adjustments.
4.0,Its cute the overall fit on the body could be better but i dont really expect it to be tailored as prefect as the pic at this price. Anywho its affordable and it still looks good definitely a good dress to add in your wardrobe. And the grippys do a good job keeping it on your shoulders. Got a large but i think i should have done medium to hug my curves
4.0,The Style of this dress is nice and casual it just wasn’t my type. It fits beautiful though and it’s great for the summer. Perfect for church that’s what I will be using it for.
4.0,"I wear a 34DDD so it can be hard finding a strapless or backless bra. Pros: STAYS IN PLACE!, cannot be seen under clothing. Cons: can be hard to connect without it looking like I'm not wearing a bra, can be hard to line up the middle to connect"
4.0,"Got this the other day. Seems very well made and good size to store important documents for travels or any day out of the house. Love that it has RFID protection.<br /><br />Have not used it yet, but it will get a lot of use for an overseas trip in 3 weeks.<br /><br />Fast shipment and good packaging too."
4.0,"Nice earrings, nothing fancy just some costume earrings but nice, lightweight and fashionable. They do showoff with shorter hair. Not expensive at all but make a good gift along with a scarf or anything you think she's like."
4.0,"very shiny and cool - design is not as clear on it as i would like, but other than that i have no complaints. also get compliments every time i wear it :)"
4.0,"Love the wide arms straps!  Wish it was longer, but other than that it's perfect.  Ordered a second color."
4.0,Haven't yet used them but they seem very high quality.
4.0,"Wear them morning, noon, night. Very cozy."
4.0,These socks fit just below the knee and the bottom of the feet have embossing so they reduce slipping.  They stay on better than most socks and since they're knee highs it's harder for my son to pull them off
4.0,Love it! This dress fit perfectly and looks so cute!
4.0,"The most important part of this product: THEY WORK. I had gotten shoes just like this from a different website entirely, as a gift from a dear friend of mine, and was greeted with  a faulty product (aka the left shoe didn't work) and poor customer service when I inquired about exchanging them or getting a refund. SO with that being said, I bought these as a replacement and hoped they worked.<br /><br />I bought the 6.5, knowing they're roughly the equivalent of a women's 8, and these shoes DO run a little small - normally, a &#34;big kid&#34; 6 is still a little big on me, but these fit closer to a snug 8 - so if there's a possibility, order a size up. They're slightly uncomfortable in the soles, but nothing a cushioned insert can't fix, much like with any other shoe. Above-ankle socks are a MUST when you wear them, due to the charging and on/off port on the side - without them, you can feel the button easily.<br /><br />Overall, I'm super satisfied with these!"
4.0,The fabric and design were good. Difficult to zip up. Sizing was on the small size.
4.0,"I bought them for my daughter for Christmas, they look nice"
4.0,"Pros:<br />- Polarized lens helps to protect your eyes and makes everything very clear<br />- Lightweight and comfortable (perfect for long 20+ mile bike rides)<br />- Advertised unbreakable frame and lens (Lifetime warranty)<br />- Excellent nose pads for secure and comfortable fit<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Slightly cheaper feeling than some of the other models offered by Duduma<br />- These fit tighter on the face than some of the other models offered by Duduma<br />- These do not keep wind out of your eyes for activities like Kayaking or cycling<br /><br />Personal Experience:<br /><br />I consider myself a pretty athletic guy and enjoy going road biking for 20+ mile rides, fun hikes, kayaking, and other outdoor activities. Especially on long cycling rides, it's incredibly important to have good quality and comfortable eye wear. I have been using a pair of Nike sport sunglasses for quite some time, but I finally decided to ditch them because they just weren't very comfortable. That's where the Duduma Polzarized Sports Sunglasses come in. When I was given the opportunity to receive these at a discount and provide an honest review, I gladly accepted it. Full Disclosure: I only review items I am interested in, and will never be swayed to leave a dishonest review.<br /><br />First Impression:<br />These came in simple packaging–just a plastic bag with the sunglasses contained in a dust bag. The packaging is not terribly impressive, but that's not a deal breaker.  Unfortunately, unlike some of the other models offered by Duduma (I own two other models), these do not feel as high quality.  They feel more lightweight with a cheaper plastic, and these are also more narrow than the other models that I own-so much so that these were actually uncomfortable to wear.  The good is that the ear pieces open and close smoothly with the light resistance you expect from quality sunglasses, there is good flexibility on the frames, the nose pads are pretty comfortable, and the lens are polarized for a clearer view (instead of catching a lot of light glare).<br /><br />Performance:<br />I attempted to go on a bike ride with these, but to be honest, after a short period of time I knew that these wouldn't work out.  They do not block out the wind at all, and they were simply too tight on my face.  I think these are fine for casual use like golfing or hikes, but for more active sports, I would look to their other models.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I wanted to like these more, but they simply are not as good as some of the other models offered by Duduma."
4.0,Does not have clasps for the back. It is a bit loose around the chest.
4.0,"Cute romper. I am 5'11' and wear a US size is 10/12 and getting an XL worked great, as it fits like a charm (just a little short)."
4.0,"I like this key ring because it feels more substantial than those thin aluminum (“paper clip” gauge) wire rings. However, it’s not some magically easier ring to work with… You still have to push one end to the side and guide the key all the way around the circle onto the ring to get them off/on. For valet, you still have to guide one ring off of the other by running it all the way around in a circle as well… I don’t see any savings in time or ease of process. It just seems to be more thicker product that may not break as easily as others."
4.0,My son likes it..
4.0,"Gorgeous color, but the fabric is really thick and I feel like it makes me look larger than I am because it does not drape well. If fabric were less stiff, I would be in love with this summer dress. I plan to wear it on a cruise next month."
4.0,Good basic layer piece - nice fabric.  Just wish they were a little longer (I'm tall).
4.0,The color isn't like to imagine
4.0,The tank was more see through than I expected. I still love the tank and it fits great. I only gave it 4 stars due to the material the tank is made out of.
4.0,Well worth the price. Soft and nicely form fitting but not tight. Flattering.
4.0,"The royal blue is really pretty and I think it was fairly true to size.  You can’t tell much about the fabric from the photos, but it is like a paper thin t-shirt.  That is why I only gave four stars on the review.  My daughter likes the style (twirly skirt) and needs it for this weekend so we are keeping it."
4.0,runs short for someone who is 5ft 9
4.0,The material was not what I expected I thought the cotton would be thicker
4.0,very nice earrings comfortable clips
4.0,"Not quite to size, needed to be a little bigger."
4.0,The bow one broke a little(clip part) bit but otherwise they are gorgeous!!!
4.0,"These pants are super stretchy but because I'm short (just under 5' tall) it lacked in a couple areas for me. The torso part seems to be just a little long for me, so when I pull the pants all the way up to where they naturally stop, my stomach bulges below the waist band. So to compensate and not bulge, I have to shimmy the pants a little lower than they would naturally sit but also creates slight space in the crotch area. I also had to get it altered to shorten the length. The contouring print is flattering and does enhance the booty area. Taking away one star because of stomach bulge and slightly itchy fabric."
4.0,The 2 year old is afraid of it because he face planted into the middle on his first time on it. The 6 year old loved it but it kind of dangerous for younger kids
4.0,"Fit as expected. I needed an easy slide on house shoe that had a thick padding and arch due to my flat feet. Walking around in my socks at home was causing my feet to ache by the end of the day. These really helped after looking at typical  house slippers, most are fluffy  warm cozy but very flat! Gave it a 4 because i wasn't too impressed with choice of colors. I really would have preferred  a plain black."
4.0,I absolutely love this ring.  It is beautiful and fits true to size - the only complaint I have is that the black coloring scratches right off very easily.  I get many compliments.
4.0,"The boots fit good. They are comfortable and roomy in the toe. I don't think they have good arch support,but for the price they are a cute add to my shoe wardrobe."
4.0,Really cute ring I purchased it for a pinky ring...stones a little larger than I thought. But cute & good product for the price! I'm happy with it!
4.0,A nice novelty watch for a reasonable price.
4.0,I love how soft and beatable the fabric is. It is also very stylish and versatile. You can wear it with jeans or with a dress.
4.0,Beautiful color material tends to crawl up
4.0,"Hem Started to revel on first wearing - other than that, like them - long, comfortable and not restrictive."
4.0,The hinge is a bit loose but pretty cool
4.0,"Nice little shoe polish pack! I use it to polish my work shoes, works well overall. Polish is a little too tacky for my preference, but works well anyway."
4.0,"Beautiful, good size and comfortable. I don't really like that the bars screw out of the gem in the middle though."
4.0,Material is thin<br />Design are unique to each person style<br />Size is fit all<br />Keep the dust away
4.0,I am abit curvey so it didn't come straight up. My wife uses it though.
4.0,"Super thin, but definitely worth the price!"
4.0,There really is not arch support in this type of snow boot. Keeps feet warm. It's -25 tomorrow.....
4.0,"This hat looked really nice when I opened the packaging. I ordered it as a part of a costume. The only problem I had was that the crown/front part of the hat was a bit too stiff, and I had quite a bit of room left at the top, above my forehead. I loved the vintage/matte leather look of the hat, and the back was adjustable. For $10.99, you can't really complain. I would purchase this again if needed. The quality looks better than the amount you pay."
4.0,The watch look nice and could have been great if quality of chain would have been better.. doesnt look like scratch resistant.. though its just tow days may be can wirte an updated review later..
4.0,"When I opened it, I wasn't convinced it would provide enough support but it does provide plenty of support while running and is also comfortable.  After reading others reviews, I decided to order one size up and while that fits very well, I think I'll order again in my usual size.  Ordering up, I'm putting the eye hooks in the tightest closure which leaves alot of material that moves and was itchy.  I'm hoping I'll use the shortest hook closure if I order my usual size.  I agree with another reviewer that you do feel a bit like a contortionist trying to close the top eye hooks but it's doable. It's definitely worth the price!"
4.0,im a solid XXL with 40D. seriously… medium fit perfect. cute flowy but not too long
4.0,I’m 198lb 6’1” tall 44” chest.  Fits ok in chest a little loose for my liking. I got the xl next time I will get the large.
4.0,Product worked perfectly as described and demagnetized my watch to fix the accuracy issue. It would have been great if they had included instructions for use.
4.0,They are great socks  Very warm and soft.  I would have given them 5 stars if they hadn't left a long piece of fabric inside of the sock plus frade material.
4.0,"Thick, felted material. Sewn well. Dress is more of a Christmas-y shade of red, not maroon or wine-colored like in the picture."
4.0,"I am happy with this purchase the material feels good and fit is what I wanted (loose), I am actually lounging in the dress today.  I am going to remain hopeful once it washed a couple of times it will still feel and fit the way it does now (which I am enjoying).  I would and mostly like will make another purchase from VeryAnn womens.  I will tell/recommend friends and family about this purchase."
4.0,I'm not a mask person so these were perfect. Breathable masks and stylish too! Since we were made to wear them these were perfect!
4.0,"For less than $20, this is a pretty nice long sleeve shirt. The material is pretty thick when compared to similar styles in stores, and it feels warm and comfy when you're wearing it. I normally wear women's XL so that is what I ordered in this shirt, but trust that this is indeed &#34;loose fit&#34; sleeve and width-wise. I found it just a touch too baggy in these areas, however the length does seem a little short for such a wide shirt (I am almost 5'11&#34; and this hits me right below the waist of my jeans).  My only complaints would be that I wouldn't call this a sweatshirt since it's a totally different kind of material, and it exposes more neck meat than what I was expecting but that's the case with a lot of women's tops. I also thought the sleeves looked a little funny when viewed from the side due to the stitching in the middle of the arm, but I gotta say that overall I think this top looks totally cute on. Looks simple yet fashionable, and can be worn with virtually any lipstick shade (Ruby Woo red is highly suggested). Very pleased, especially for such a low price."
4.0,"I really love the face of this watch, being a huge Superman fan, it's very cool.  However the watch band<br />itself is very light, I feel like it is very fragile and I'm afraid if I accidentally hit it on something it might break.  Also in certain light it is very hard to see the hour and minute hands.  I had to walk over to a lamp to see what time it was.  For the price I paid its cool.  We will see how long it lasts."
4.0,Fits around me well but cups were a bit big.
4.0,The color is great and as expected. I was hoping the V neck would be more of a plunge but this sweater will be fine for work.<br />Not sure if I would spend the 26 bucks on it again. Like it but not in love with it.
4.0,Good fit and feel.  The grain looks well and received compliments on it.
4.0,Cute shirt... A little big.
4.0,I wear it and I like it. The detail is small so it isn't noticeable that it is a 4 leaf clover from a distance.
4.0,Good deal for the price! Looks chic and great for formal dresses
4.0,I really like this rope to get into first thing in the morning when it is still a little chilly - it's just the right in between wight for spring and fall.  Really enjoying it - the length is above my ankles and I am under 5 feet tall. The sleeves are a tad long - but better long and roll them up.
4.0,This leotard is really awesome you can really move around in it I think tis the best ever. Its good for little girls it fits good to. The only reason I wold not get it is that the sides go up but if you got a bigger size then it would fit better.
4.0,"This watch looks great and seems to be made pretty decent. The buttons do press a little soft though. Mine was turned on when I opened the box and the display seemed dim. I put a new battery in that I had & it got a little brighter. The display looks great under good lighting, but in dim lighting it is hard to see & the light up feature barely helps. But, it tells the day, date & time and was cheap."
4.0,"I wasn't expecting based on other reviews for there to be much slouch, and there wasn't. Its more of a slightly baggy long sleeved shirt, but its decently comfy and the design is well printed. A bit tight in the wrists but overall not bad."
4.0,Goes with necklace I have by Kendra Scott.
4.0,"nice jacket, wish I would have brought a size bigger."
4.0,"No second hand if you need it for something (e.g. checking pulse, respiratory rate at hospital), but otherwise great investment."
4.0,Really cool packages for these. Have several par of lenses I can change out for any mood.
4.0,"Unfortunately, there is not a smooth transition between modes. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. Super cute when they work!!!"
4.0,"Cute, cute, cute!!! Very tough to get in and out of though."
4.0,"this is soft and silky, but you also get what you pay for. The wrap part makes it more versatile for the fit.  overall a cute cheap find to wear when you need to be a little dressier."
4.0,Beads are a bit large
4.0,Reasonable price
4.0,Super cute. Very comfortable. Runs a little small.
4.0,"This sweatshirt has a great cut and is super comfy.  I really like those aspects. However, beware that the denim colored one that is shown as being ""heathered"" (I'm not sure if that is what it is called or not but hopefully you know what I mean) is barely heathered at all in real life even though on the screen it is clearly heathered.  The one I received is pretty much solid colored with just a little bit of white flecks...much less than is shown on screen  My daughter has one from a year or so ago and the tag is different than what is shown online so maybe they are on version 2.0 or something now and the new one isn't as heathered?  IDK.  I just know it does not match what is shown online and I'm very disappointed.  It's a pretty color.  It's just not what I thought I was getting based on the picture shown (mostly solid vs. heathered)  It's not worth the extra cost to ship it back though so I'll probably keep it."
4.0,I use this blouse for work.
4.0,"I liked it, but they were a little small for the children and too soft.  They were falling apart"
4.0,excellent product. I love this luggage.
4.0,"This cap was baggier that I expected. Would provide generous room for someone with a lot of hair to cover, which I do not have. I picked this one because I liked the colorful facric."
4.0,These did work but became uncomfortable after a short time.
4.0,Arrived on time and fits well and I will use it to sleep in.  If I where it as intended I will get it a size smaller.
4.0,Ver long will have to shorten. cool fabric
4.0,Super cute but cheaply made. When I received mine it already had loose strings. When I went to tie it in back more strings came loose. However once it was on it was comfortable and I got many compliments. It is hard to go to the bathroom in it because of the tie at the neck and it's hard to tie by yourself.
4.0,"I wear a 2x or 3 x top. Purchased a 6x bra. Fits snugly. I wanted an inexpensive, comfy sports bra to wear around the house and that is what this is."
4.0,"Awesome fit for my 8 year old son. Loved the matte finish. Unfortunately the lens scratch very easily. Not sure what he did but within a day of having them, the right lens got scratched right in his line of vision so he stopped wearing them. They look just like my Ray Bans and are super cute. For the price, worth it for sure."
4.0,"A little small, but nice in that it is reversible!  Soft substantial fabric.  I wish it came in larger sizes and more colors... hint, hint."
4.0,They are very robust. The only thing I didn't care for is they tend to curl up at the ends. I also should have bought a longer pair. 7 in doesn't cover my complete wrists and forearms.
4.0,These are super cute. They have great color and look good from any angle. They are on the larger side so they do catch on things more often if you aren't careful. No irritation with these after 2 weeks so they are good for people with sensitive skin.
4.0,Love the style of this shoe and is comfortable with my daughter.  Great for that casual dressy look.
4.0,Ordered a Medium/Large and seemed to be a bit large . Ordered a xs/sm  and that was a bit to small. I decided to keep the medium/large and return the xsmall/small. The product is very comfortable and well made for the price.
4.0,Pretty nice little bracelet for the snaps.
4.0,"I love the way it looks! It’s material is very good.<br /><br />The only problem I have is that I guess some of the resin spilled out, so there are weird little extra bits of resin on the tooth but nothing a little of sandpaper and paint can’t fix"
4.0,Good to sleep in. Nice material. Very satisfied.
4.0,"Ordered these for a 90's costume party -- great for the price! One part of the plastic was digging into the side of my foot, but I was mostly able to bend it back where it wouldn't rub."
4.0,"cute socks, comfy"
4.0,"This was cute for my wedding, but it was a little too small. It ended up showing parts I didn't want seen! I would order a size up."
4.0,"This mini purse was used as the money bag for my daughter's wedding.  It was smaller than what we liked, but was doable.  Made really well with magnetic snap and included a zipper."
4.0,Good looking slippers and comfortable. Like them a lot
4.0,They are nice but too small for me
4.0,"the quality of these glasses is excellent in the carbon polymer lenses and flexible frames the areas that are not so appealing is the  transitioning of colorstransitioning of colors in the lens central blue, top and bottom pinkish and yellow to the peripheral. I was expecting more of a solid color instead of multi."
4.0,I liked it but it didn't look good on me.  Made me look hippy...but for someone else it might be perfect. I returned it.
4.0,Very soft and feel very comfortable on and Fun to Ware
4.0,Daughter loved this and wears everyday to match mommy. Holds up well just wish the string was a little shorter for both bc it’s kind of dangling all the time and can get in the way.
4.0,Too big around the waist I should I have gotten a size small
4.0,"It’s a nice looking dress, it’s fits a little weird/loose at the top edge but not a big deal. I’m 5’7-5’8 & I wish it was about 2-3 inches longer. I weigh 235lbs & bought the 2x which overall fits good."
4.0,"Nice casual maxi dress. Perfect for a layback hot day. Love the color but what I loved the most was the pockets. So useful, comfortable and it hugged my figure."
4.0,"Its cute but it's too short! I have to constantly pull it down throughout the day cuz it's too short for my torso! I don't normally have to size up, but I should've with this!"
4.0,The dress is very pretty but it ran too small in the top and arms.
4.0,"Order a size down because if not the pants go up past the belly button or the crotch hangs down to their knees 😑 Super cute otherwise! Keeping it, just going to fold the pants over bc the top is just too darn cute!"
4.0,"I got these for a trip to the Caribbean.  I wanted sandals for walking, shopping and possibly getting wet.  They were instantly comfortable and fit well to my foot.  I love the padding it has at all the buckles so rubbing isn’t an issue and the sole is very soft with cushioning with each step.  It feels like they are going to be that rare pair of shoes you don’t have to break in before they are comfortable wear.  Absolutely recommend you give these a try.  I love the lavender and turquoise pattern too!"
4.0,I ordered this wallet for my daughter for a gift; she didn't like it because of the textured leather.  The color is gorgeous; it is spacious and well organized.  It was certainly worth the price.
4.0,These work well and are inconspicuous enough that you can't tell they're in. They are easy to put in and take out.
4.0,Was a gift for my aunt and she loved it!!
4.0,Fabric very soft and comfortable
4.0,Super cute and well made! I only wish some of the birdies faced the other direction!
4.0,"Love these myself and my daughter also loved them until they got a hole quickly. Such a bummer, but we will still be ordering another pair."
4.0,The arms are kind of short for me..the seam for the shoulder is half way down my bicep but the sleeve stops 3 inches above my wrist
4.0,"I really like this skirt... BUT the material differs between colors. The yellow skirt is a crepe material that falls nicely over the hips, but the red skirt is paper thin and stiff. It does not drape; it looks like a triangle on my body. I'm returning the red but I like the yellow. For reference, I bought a medium, I'm 5'7"" and 135lbs."
4.0,"It’s lite weight and comfortable and comes a nice bag you can keep in your pocket or bag, easy to clean and it drys quickly"
4.0,"I found the buttons stick out too much which makes it too easy for the buttons to depress through simple wrist flexing and physical movement. I also don't like the fact that by pressing one button it brings up the mode where the seconds can be reset to zero. This has cause me a few problems.<br /><br />Otherwise, it is an excellent, but unattractive watch.  I am not a watch guy.  The only reason I bought this watch was because I was getting married in Jamaica and I couldn't rely on my cellphone to keep track of time. The resort we were at had specific times that certain things opened and closed. I chose this watch online because of how light it was and how thin it was. I also have a small wrist so a big watch would look stupid on me.<br /><br />This watch has been in the Caribbean, the pools and I beat it up at work building airplanes.  About 5 minutes ago I took it out of the front load washer after an hour and 7 minute wash cycle.  No problems. It got mixed up with my clothes and I couldn't find it for a few days."
4.0,"I liked the fabric of this dress, and it fit pretty well - everywhere but the bust. I think someone with a medium bust would love this dress, but the arm holes (I got the sleeveless version) were huge, and even though the fabric stretched to accommodate my DDD cups, the arm holes came forward so much that I would have had to wear a full tank top underneath it. Even a bralette wouldn't be enough coverage. Not the fault of the dress, but I think ladies with a large bust should avoid the sleeveless version here. I don't think upsizing would have helped in this case, because it fit really well otherwise."
4.0,Product was a gift to a dear friend so donot know how well it helps in the wellness or healing areas. Product arrived on time and is very pretty and well made.
4.0,So far so good! Products look just like the picture. I haven't worn them all yet - I wore one for a day and had no issues. I'm happy with the purchase.
4.0,"Really nice wallet. Description and pictures tell it all, very well made.<br />I’d recommend it."
4.0,"Pretty earrings, but I would have preferred a little more of the blue turquoise in it."
4.0,"Like everything about this kurthi. Fits perfect,  size, design, fabric!!"
4.0,bought these for a Tricky Tray fund raiser.  The quality was not great but it served the purpose.
4.0,Loved it...made me look elegant!!!
4.0,Like it so far - waiting for it to turn colors! I hope it does not!!
4.0,"I bought this necklace for my daughter. For a little more than $3 it is really pretty and very on trend right now. No it's not a quality piece of jewelry, cheap metal is cheap metal. But for the price it's a super cute necklace that I won't feel too upset about when she loses or breaks it. It took a while to get here but it arrived in tact and looks just like the photo. Very cute accessory for the price. Score one for Mom!"
4.0,Very cute. The material is very soft. The strings with the snaps don't feel super securely attached to the hat but overall I'm very satisfied with this product.  It's a little big for my 1 year old son but that's ok because we will probably get to use it again next year.
4.0,"Business cards are probably soon to be a thing of the past, but every time I convince myself I don't need to carry them, I find myself somewhere where people are asking me for one. I've tried stuffing one or two in my wallet, or carrying them loose in my briefcase, but they always get beat up. So apparently one still needs a business card holder. I wanted something simple, that looks squared away, with a magnetic closure, and this one fit the bill. It holds a good number of cards, pops open smoothly, and looks great -- I really like the orange.<br /><br />Mine doesn't see a lot of wear and tear, because it sits quietly in my briefcase until I need it, but I've had no problems with it in several months. I actually like that the leather is synthetic -- it may be tougher and easier to clean in this application, and there is no difference in the looks. I can't see how a more expensive one would look or work any better.<br /><br />Five stars. A perfect solution to a small problem."
4.0,I'm not mad it for that price! I wish the fabric was a little thicker but other than that it's a beautiful sexy dress it hugged me in all the right places.
4.0,"The bead is quite small, almost can't see that its turquoise. Still cute though."
4.0,Love its look and that the empty purse is lightweight.
4.0,"Its a nice piece good weight, broken clasp that I fixed. like the earrings very well made but a cheap plastic plug to hold on the earring. I will wear this with great pride."
4.0,MY wife loves this dress but the sizing 3x was more like a 2x.
4.0,Worth the money you pay
4.0,"Mine came in dirty, even had specs of hair in it. Didn't take a picture because I was so grossed out. I cleaned it right away, but overall it looks just like the picture. Just wish it didn't come in with small hairs in it.."
4.0,"Great suit, runs very small"
4.0,Color nicer than expected<br />Fit nice
4.0,"Super cute, a little wide in the toes (nothing some socks can't fix), but comfortable for heels (I know I could wear them for hours without tripping - stable). Happy with my purchase, also got the red pair!"
4.0,Fits as expected. Cute cut but I thought the center was a belt but it's not
4.0,Just fun for my costume.
4.0,"The reason I bought this thing because I'm a fan of Gavin Hoey on youtube channel. I thought the Lightmeter would help me speed thing up with my photo shoot. Most of my shooting session are done outside in broad daylight. And I like to crush the ambient light for dramatic look. The only problem is this thing can only dial shutter speed max at 500 which render useless for me. May be some of the more expensive model you can dial more, but I don't know that for sure. Most of my shutter speed setting usually around 500-1200. Even for indoor session when the meter give the correct exposure, I find it to be a bit over exposure for my taste. So back in the old way for me to do series of shots."
4.0,My eight year old daughter bought this necklace and charm and really enjoys it.  It's more brilliant than pictured and looks great.
4.0,These are nice shorts but be sure to look at the waist sizing.  I had to order an XXL for a 34&#34; waist. Which is crazy but they fit fine.
4.0,Good enough and pretty
4.0,This is a nice keychain. It is as expected. Only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is there’s a bit to much metal for me. I would have liked more leather than metal. But otherwise it’s works just fine.
4.0,"A little on the small side, but they are great for the price seeing as how much I break/lose sunglasses."
4.0,"Its really cute but was too boxy and big, I returned and ordered a size smaller. We'll see how that fits. I'm afraid it'll be too short, but fingers crossed!"
4.0,They were the correct color but a tiny bit tight. Although I do have large thighs for someone my size
4.0,Love this piece. Which they had a larger size too
4.0,Order one size down and you’ll be good to go! This swimsuit is sexy with the wrap around straps. The shimmer is pretty cute too.
4.0,Nice shirt.  Husband loves it.
4.0,"Beautiful bag, as the other reviews say. Very sturdy construction and good quality leather. I have received multiple compliments.  Love the mustardy yellow color, which works like a neutral to go with most outfits.  Depending on what you wear, it can have a chic classy look or a boho look to it.  The bag is very sturdy and has a ton of pockets everywhere, which is awesome. The only down side is that the opening in the top is narrower that the main compartments--so narrow that it is really difficult to get things in and out.  It is difficult squeezing my iPad through the narrow top, and my 13 inch MacBook Pro just barely squeezes in with a lot of effort and nothing else in the bag. You can't just throw your stuff in here, for that reason. You have to pack it in carefully. I wish it were more versatile as a weekender/briefcase/travel bag, in which case it would get 5 stars."
4.0,"Good fit, mid to cheap quality. Don’t regret buying though."
4.0,I bought these for my son and he love them so much. He said they were very soft and warm on the inside and light
4.0,"The dress shipped without any damage and arrived in good time. It does look very like the picture shown and comes just above the knees. The fabric is like a jersey and is very comfortable. It is cute, the hardest thing was that the sleeves almost did come off the shoulders making it just a tiny bit more uncomfortable."
4.0,"I ordered the XL for my son. This is his normal size. When it came it was much too tight. So I returned it and ordered the XXL and when it arrived it was still much too tight in the sleeves. His cousin was present when he opened it and tried both jackets on. He is considerably smaller than my son. The XL was too tight in the sleeves and the XXL was also tight but was wearable. This jacket was beautiful, however it reminded me of a shirt with a &#34;fitted&#34; cut. Definitely not for a hefty guy. I am giving it 4 stars, mainly because it is a beautiful jacket, however beware of the sleeves."
4.0,"i bought this one because the one I had before was terrible. The zipper would get stuck. This one is a bigger and much better. Fit two passports and our tickets, with no problem. The zipper never stuck. Fit fine in my carry on. My I D credit cards etc. Loved it."
4.0,Not to bad so far.
4.0,"The nightgown is both comfy, cute and very soft. The size was a little tricky (I'm one size smaller on top than my hips), but still it works fine."
4.0,Such a great skirt for spring and summer. Light and flowy! Will need to add a slip.
4.0,I liked the fabric it was soft.  I liked the colors. It was too small and I sent it back
4.0,Smaller than I expected but looks nice on my kilt and adds a little weight to keep the front from flying up.
4.0,"This dress is very cute, nice quality, and is made of a very nice material. Would love to try it in different colors as well. Great buy!"
4.0,"comfy, and flowy, but definetly some sideboob."
4.0,"the shirt was a little too big, but it was good overall"
4.0,I like the color of the face!!!
4.0,"This is a shirt I bought simply because my hubby liked it.  I don't have any problems with the color, I love purple and it goes well with my complexion.  Ruffles aren't necessarily my favorite, but these are done well enough to where I don't mind wearing them.<br /><br />My trouble with this shirt is that it makes me look pregnant.  Ok, so I'm short, and there's not a lot of space between my bust and my backside, so while I have a flat enough tummy and even some decent enough ab definition, you totally can't tell in this shirt. It pooches out because of the flouncing in just the right spot. It's something I'm not particularly fond of.  Now I don't necessarily like to wear very fitted shirts either, so it' not the looseness that bothers me, it's the fact that I think it makes me look puffy in the middle.  Now I did ask a member of my son's therapy team, and she totally thinks it's in my head.  But then, if you feel like something makes you look bloated it doesn't necessarily matter as much how other people see it, because part of you is still uncomfortable anyways.<br /><br />So this is something that could work for you or against you.  If you actually are pregnant, and aren't wanting anyone to know yet...great shirt for that, totally great.  If you aren't pregnant and don't want to look it...well, that one could be in the eye of the beholder.  Otherwise, there's nothing technically wrong with this shirt that I can see, and everybody assures me it's pretty on me.  I'm surrounded by great people, that's just all I'm going to say about that ;)"
4.0,it fit my customer needs for my Christmas party. My one complaint is the back of the dickie doesn't go very far down on the back side so the back of the dickie would pop outside my sweater from time to time. not a big deal but wish it was a little bit bigger.
4.0,"I just think this style is not flattering for me. It’s a pretty shirt. Nice quality. Exactly as pictured. It’s just where it hits on my body, I guess? It just made me feel chubby & I’m not chubby. 5’7” 130lbs...usually wear a small, but I sized up to a medium based on reviews. It fit fine, just didn’t look great on me."
4.0,It fits great! It hugs your body! I love it!
4.0,"It is a beautiful necklace. The charm is very eye catching. My daughter loves it. However, the charm fell off already. We were able to fix it by clamping back together the piece that holds the charm onto the chain."
4.0,"Very cute dress. Material is very thin, I will need a slip underneath. Bust is a little tight but that's not uncommon for me. I'm a size 16 and the 4XL works well."
4.0,This top fit accordingly to size chart. To me I feel it was mid length. Fabric was very soft and I like that it had built in support.
4.0,I HAD SHOULDER SURGERY. WAS VERY HELPFUL.
4.0,I originally bought a small in this dress which is normally what I wear but I had to return it for an x-small. The x-small fits perfectly. The dress is really cute!
4.0,I really like the boots a lot.  If the heel was a little higher and made of wood they would be perfect.  All that said I am glad I got them and am not sending them back.
4.0,These earring were a little difficult to lock. I would recommend these earring for those folks that will not be changing earring daily.
4.0,Very nice sunglass. Recommend it!!!
4.0,"I have a big head, and this was too small for it.  It did fit my wife, however, so the 'one size' should be taken as 'up to men's large' hat size.  If you have an XL head, then don't get this.  Otherwise it looks OK for the amount it costs."
4.0,"When I pulled the rights out of the bag, I was devastated. They looked soooo small. I have 45 inch hips and 22 inch thighs, also om 5'8. Then I tried it on and they actually fit. I would like if they had a slightly higher waist, but they'll do. I'm overall happy with my purchase."
4.0,as expected.no issues.
4.0,"This shirt is a bit too small and is tight in the arms, limiting your range of motion a little bit. Overall a cute shirt but I wish I had gotten a bigger size."
4.0,"Pros: great length; breathable fabric; great color; super stretchy; POCKETS<br /><br />Cons: not as structured as you would presume; no zipper, it goes over the head; it's loose and drapey compared to most sheath dresses, but it flattered my frame (I'm 6 feet tall and plus-sized, so that's not an easy feat); it hits me right at my knee cap, so it would sit much lower for a customer of average height<br /><br />Will be using this as an interview dress. It would be great if it were sold in a wider variety of colors"
4.0,"I definitely didn't think this purchase all the way through. If someone isn't a fan of the show, they could easily become offended by all the nooses on the shirt. So I ended up adding some fabric paint turning them all into Christmas bulbs instead. Problem solved! I gave this 4 stars only because I don't believe the nooses are needed at all."
4.0,"I am 5'9 and 180 lbs. I ordered the XL based on the chart and reviews and it fits great. The top is very supportive and the pattern layout is perfect--the tiles are perfectly centered on the suit which really goes the extra step to making this suit look high-quality. Other reviewrs have commented on this as well, so it seems to me like this is something that the manufacturer makes sure of, which is nice!<br />The high neck tightens via the straps in the back, which I am easily able to tighten and tie myself. The top is a nice A-line shape which skims over the hips. On me, even though I'm tall, the top conceals all of the swimsuit bottom in the front, which I don't actually care for as a look, so I'm going to hem it up a little bit in the front so it doesn't look so much like a swimdress on me. The edge of the top is raw, not hemmed, FYI.<br />I have a kid and very active niece/nephew so when I wear a swimsuit I like to know that my boobs aren't going to pop out while running around/wrestling with small children, and I definitely feel secure in this suit!"
4.0,I really like this bag.  So much stuff fit in it.  Full size toothpaste and toothbrush fit perfectly fine. I'm sure makeup will fit great too since theres also slots to fit makeup brushes in it too.  Highly recommend this bag. I don't normally use the hanging feature though.
4.0,"This dress looked fantastic, even though I knew I was getting a cheap imitation. The issue is the cheap synthetic fiber fabric. I accidentally caught the dress on a zipper, and it ripped and ran like pantyhose. I was so disappointed, but for as cheap as it is, you shouldn't expect quality fabric."
4.0,"This dress looks exactly as pictured. It has a flattering fit and is an appropriate- but cute- length and style. My only disappointment is in the fabric. It is very thin, there is no liner in the dress. Since it is so thin, it wrinkles easily and may tear easily/show wear quickly. It is very similar quality to something you would find at Forever 21."
4.0,"Cute but must have shipped from China slow at arriving, runs quite small, nice size for kids."
4.0,"Kind of heavy chain, would be much nicer if the chain were half as heavy, still pretty sexy, will be fun to take her out in it and watch the men lose their trane of thought."
4.0,Fits fits too size but doesn’t look like it will endure wearing and washing because of the material and construction
4.0,I have always love the Ironman watch for everyday use and training. These watches all program and work the same. This is the 1st time I’ve purchase a women’s size watch and I’m not sure I like the band as much. It very stiff and the holes on the band run at odd spacing. It either too tight or to loose. Either east you can’t go wrong with this watch. Ironman is the only watch I wear.
4.0,I like this shirt except the area around the stomach is too loose so it is not as flattering as it could be if it was ju a hint more clingy.
4.0,Uncomfortable after a while
4.0,Ok fitting..looked more like one peice in the back
4.0,These were what I was expecting. The color is good. I'm concerned that the stones will fall out eventually. They seem to be glued in place. Not bad but probably overpriced for what arrived.
4.0,Belt looks really good and seems of high quality size is as ordered fits good the belt buckle is real plane and I didn’t like it  I replaced soon as I got it  but all and all I like the belt and recommend it
4.0,I loved the bells on it. It makes sounds and that’s exactly what i wanted. it arrived way sooner than expected the color was not to bright either it’s a nice golden color overall I loved it
4.0,"Strap was too short for me, but the color is great and I like the snap which keeps my phone from flying out."
4.0,"This thing hurts like a b@!&% in the morning when you're asleep. Works perfectly to wake you up, once you figure out how to do everything"
4.0,"read other reviews! this dress is somewhat see through and sheer. not a thick material. i would not feel comfortable walking down the street in this -- HOWEVER it is the perfect house dress and the fit is amazing -- i got a small, im 5'4'' , 140 lbs, 36 C breast, and i thought it fit great. i also bought a medium just in case and it was too big. i feel very sleek and slender in this dress."
4.0,Bought for my daughter. She loved them. They are made of thin material but that is fine with us.
4.0,Love this shirt. I just don't like the little pouch on the bottom. Makes it look like you are carrying extra weight. Still a great shirt.
4.0,"These are truly beautiful, soft, and my son loves them. Unfortunately, they are very fragile, as everyone I know who has them has said that they will pull and tear immediately. It's a children's toy, so don't get too invested. Kids are rough on things.  But just somewhat disappointing for the price."
4.0,Good but the face is bigger than what my wife likes in female watches
4.0,The length fit perfect but waist is a little tight. However fabric is nice and comfy.
4.0,Really nice looking for the price. Actually looks a bit more expensive. Was a bit hard to set with the small buttons. Took 3 tries but wasn't that bad. Got it for a male friend now co-workers thinj something is going on!
4.0,Just a little snug. otherwise a lovely shirt
4.0,"The scarf is soft and fluffy. It looks more like a fabric approximation of fur than actual faux fur, but it is very nice and had a cool texture. It has gray and black yarns or fabric threads that blend to make a dark gray - but with shifting coloring due to the alternating yarns. The scarf is an infinity design and makes a nice one loop scarf. The length of the scarf is longer than the picture makes it seem. So it is closer in size to an average fashion infinity scarf rather than a chocker/collar that the photo seems to depict. Very nice scarf. Warm and soft."
4.0,"The brim is a bit longer than I like, so it bumps against stuff, but I guess I will get used to it"
4.0,Pretty but much smaller than the pictures appear.
4.0,Didn't realize they were so thick and large. Xmas present for teen grandaughter
4.0,"Love the fabric! Very soft. It's supposed to be big and I'm usually a medium so I ordered a small because I wanted it baggy but not too baggy. It came and it was still a little too big. I was going to return it and order an extra small if they had one or try somewhere else but I tried it on a few more times and decided it was fine. And I really didn't want to deal with the hassle of returning it. Though I wasn't sure of it at first, I LOVE it now. It's SO comfy!"
4.0,"My wife really likes these Madeline Kelly hi-cut briefs. She says they're comfortable, nice-looking, and seem to be well-made. She did, however, mention that they seem to run small as far as sizing goes."
4.0,Just what you need for an inexpensive watch
4.0,"This dress is beautiful and is made of fantastic quality material. I screwed up and ordered a medium instead of a small. I am 5’6” and 133lbs, I float between a small and medium. I highly recommend going to the lower size if you are like me, it does seem to run a bit big. I used this for my uncles funeral a few weeks ago with a sweater and it still worked fine. Will enclose photos so you can see size."
4.0,"This costume served me well to be Dorothy last Halloween. It's made decently well, though there are loose strings and the fit was odd for me with some parts a little too tight and some too loose- it was tight on the back Velcro and big on the arms, but I'm sure that's different for everyone. The color and pattern is good. I like the touch that it comes with hair ribbons, though they could be shorter. Not a bad costume for the price and I'm glad it came in a size (nearly) big enough for me."
4.0,"used them in my wallet. so far they are holding up, not tearing at the seems."
4.0,Shrinks on first wash - order up.
4.0,I ordered XL. Fits great! Very comfortable dress. Love that it has deep pockets.
4.0,arent as warm as they say but decent.  The zippers are amazing for getting them on and off if I get a year out of them ill be happy for price. they are comfy
4.0,The quality is very good. The downside for me was that the sides flared out under the arms.
4.0,Very nice office attire.  Complements with every wear.  Great price and fit.
4.0,These are great for the money. Smaller phones like IPhone 6s size will fit in the hidden waist pocket and eliminate the need for am arm band to carry your cell phone. Super cute and comfy.
4.0,I bought this for my six-year-old niece and so far it has held up well.  It is very cute and she loves owls so this was perfect for her.
4.0,"I ordered a medium and received a small. I tried it on anyway, and it fit perfectly. If you're between sizes, it may be best to order  a size down.<br />Flattering, slightly stretchy, zipper back. Lightweight, but not see through.<br /><br />It's a great dress for the price for sure, and the pictures don't do justice to the pattern."
4.0,"The v neck is very high v, but it's is a very soft shirt,comfortable."
4.0,"Fitted somewhat small and the color is not exactly white, more of a yellowish tinted cream."
4.0,Nice quality but runs a big too small. I would order a size up.
4.0,I love this for bows. Makes storing them cute and artsy. I gave 4 stars because i don't like how it holds up headbands
4.0,The watch is nice looking though I wish it would run longer than a day after being wound.  The chain came off real easily.
4.0,"The print is lovely, the cut is great. My only gripe is with the length of the shoulder straps. They are very long, I’m 5’3."
4.0,It's a little bigger and heavier than I thought it would be but works perfectly  and I'd certainly recommend it.
4.0,My wife love it !!!
4.0,Thick plastic
4.0,"Top was smaller than expected. I read reviews and people said the top fit their ddd bust, not mine very well. And you cannot order different size top and bottom."
4.0,The dress is cute but it isn’t very “flattering” there is no give or shape to it so it stays the same shake as shown in the photo when it’s on. The pockets are actually navy and white and the picture it looks like black which is what i was expecting.
4.0,"im 5'9 and 190 and although I usually wear a large, I went XL just in case and boy was I glad... Sleeves are perfect but a bit tight around the mid section. Would order again, just a size up"
4.0,It fits nicely. It is great to wear for golfing.
4.0,A little bigger than I expected.  However they are pretty.  Looking forward to fancier occasions than just being in the office to be able to wear them.
4.0,"The screws that come with it are useless as is the screwdriver for them.  I reused the watch's original screws and had no trouble installing the band.  It would be nice though to have a half link or two included, as the links are either 1 link too small, or 1 link too big."
4.0,Fits great thin material
4.0,"So far so good,  works well, fits me comfortably. I like the color."
4.0,"Let's be real here. It's a decent quality latex mask. The hair is a little cheesy, the eye and nose holes need to be a little bigger, but all things considered, it's worth more then what I paid for it, and it got here before the shipping date indicated. I'm overall happy with the purchase."
4.0,Nice.  What I wanted simple
4.0,Love these. They are so pretty and expensive looking.
4.0,"It is a good watch but do not be fooled by thw unisex part, I am a woman who is 5'11&#34; and it is comically large on me."
4.0,"Very very comfortable. I'm 5' 8&#34; and the are plenty long. I would give them 5 stars off they didn't catch pilings so easily. I bought a defuzzer to address that and it adequately takes care of the problem, it's just annoying to have that concern."
4.0,The designs are nice but socks are rather thin and lightweight.
4.0,cute dress! I have to belt it because it's pretty large.
4.0,"I'm a big fan of the material for removing any pressure to the top of my foot however one of the shoes had a stitch that stuck out and cut through my skin after only 8 miles.  Think it was a defect with this pair.  Otherwise, would be 5 stars."
4.0,Lightweight. Comfortable.
4.0,They are so cute. Arrived quickly. When machine washed the buttons came off. Either hand wash or sew a little more secure. But they really are adorable.
4.0,"A men's large fit me, a 5'4"" 140lb female. They were not even close to fitting my husband who is 6' and 180lbs. The sizing is way off. But on the whole, they're nice shorts, good quality, and comfortable."
4.0,Glasses are great. Super cute and I love that they came with a solid case and bag case for protection.
4.0,Big enough hoops to notice but not too big. Nice classy size. Lightweight. Easy to clip on but also easy to miss the snap-in. Could go to the side if not careful with putting on.
4.0,Love the fit but the color is more purple than pink…I would describe it as raspberry sherbet.
4.0,"Oh my gosh; I am THRILLED with this tie-dye hoodie! It's incredibly cute & comfortable, and I will never let it out of my sight. (Well, maybe just to wash it.) This is my second purchase from this brand & I really enjoy their garments. The colors and cuts are beautiful, and the prices are great. I took off one star because the hoodie I received is absolutely not as vivid as it appears in the photo. It looks neon; it's actually pastel. I happen to prefer it the way it came! But if you were counting on this hoodie appearing exactly as it does in the photo, I want to let you know there's a chance that might not happen.<br /><br />Also, I thought it was a funnel neck hoodie, and it's not. Just in case you saw it that way, too.<br /><br />And last, a word about sizing. The sizes do run small, but the clothes fit wonderfully when you order up. If I am picking up a random top at Target, I wear a 2X - maybe a1X if it's very stretchy. I ordered the 5X here, and it's slightly baggy, the way a comfy hoodie should be, but definitely not three sizes too big! I'd consider ordering up two sizes, at least, depending on your preferred fit.<br /><br />Overall, I think you'll be glad you ordered this!"
4.0,"Love this underwear. Fits snug, no chafing. Only issue I have is the legs seem to roll up and won't stay down."
4.0,Looks great but extremely itchy.
4.0,"My husband keeps these in his car and uses them when he shops. They are plain, which is nice. Easily folds down. The large capacity makes this bag very useful."
4.0,A tad snug until broken in. Survived constant wear on a ten day road trip!
4.0,I think it will work out fine.  (my daughter has my watch)
4.0,Look great but shrink if put in drier.
4.0,"This is an okay jacket, not my favorite because it really adds bulk to you.  Not very flattering.  If you have it unzipped it looks like it's too small in the waist, but the waist band is super stretchy and it will fit.  Top is very oversized, plenty of room.  The sherpa is okay, it's not the highest quality, but it's pretty soft.  It leaves black fuzzies all over everything!  Stick with your usual size, just because of how the waist is, I wouldn't go down a size. Overall, this is just okay, nothing special and basic quality.  I would not personally recommend it."
4.0,My grandson loves his hat. It was quite a hit at Christmas. He's worn it every day since.
4.0,"Didn't work for me, maybe works better with different material. Also my waist is about 28 inches and i had to pull the elastic belt tight to keep the shirt tucked in, which stretched out the belt."
4.0,cool jacket however it doesn't fit like a xl it fits like an adult large
4.0,"the oil on the lenses smears, dont touch it"
4.0,Had to cut the bra and turned it into a halter top for a better fit. Outfit was sexy!
4.0,"Item was delivered very quickly. Unfortunately, it was too small, so I have to return."
4.0,"For reference, I'm 5'5 and 130-135# and the Small fit perfectly. It's a pretty dress, flattering style. I can see getting a lot of wear out of it. Still new and haven't washed yet, so I'm a little concerned about the pilling other reviewers mentioned. But so far, I really like the dress and it was a great price."
4.0,"I used these as party favors. I did not need all of them, but at least 5 pair came broken. Glad I didn't need them all."
4.0,Often times I overheat easily so layering isn’t always practical for me. This covers my neck to keep it warm without making me too warm
4.0,THe straps are little too long.
4.0,"Bought for the teenager and she loved it, wears it everywhere"
4.0,what my daughter expected fast delivery she liked it got it before her birthday in September thank you fast delivery
4.0,The picture does it no justice. Beautiful. Buy it... Buy it.... Buy it. I got so many compliments. Feels like royalty
4.0,"Surprised by the value!<br />I find that a lot of Aviators are too flat or large or small or just look weird when you try them on, or are not comfortable/effective when wearing them. Not these. These are legit.<br /><br />I got the glasses, case, cleaning cloth for under $29... Which is nice...<br />...but what's amazing is that these are POLARIZED lenses with UV protection and they're comfortable as well as semi-adjustable. Polarized lenses alone make this a great deal, the rest is gravy. Delicious, delicious gravy..."
4.0,"Beautiful dress, a little short for me."
4.0,looked cool but slightly big
4.0,Thick and comfortable. They keep my girlfriends feet warm. The only downside is that they're a little shorter than expected.
4.0,"light pink, may need to wear something under it so it it’s too totally see thru"
4.0,Great! Reviews were accurate
4.0,"The title says random and random it is. It says that the charms are for adults, however, most of the charms contained in the package are for children there are a few that I would say are more adult. You have musical notes,  fruits, a few hearts and I love you’s and I found Mickey, Tom from Tom & Jerry as well as his girlfriend and Incredible Hulk that appealed to me as an almost 40 year old."
4.0,"Fast shipping! Cute dress, but does run big! Give yourself enough time take to the cleaners to get the wrinkles out. Overall I'm happy with it!"
4.0,"Although a little on the small side, this dress will fit nicely. It is a lightweight fabric almost like jersey material, but a little nicer. The fabric is very breathable and washes well. It does recommend drying flat and letting it air dry which I'm not a huge fan of, but I'll live. It can be dressed down with simple sandals and some understated jewelry or go all out with heels and accessories. It's a nice basic black dress with a little flair to it.<br /><br />* I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review of the product based on my own personal experience.<br />* I have not been coached or asked to provide positive feedback nor have I received any compensation or incentive from the company for this review.

4.0,Love these sunglasses for driving. I have a petite face so these glasses cover really well. The top of these glasses reach my eyebrows and the bottom fall just below my cheekbone. The polarized frames really make a difference on bright sunny days. Surprisingly great product for the price.
4.0,"My 4-year-old daughter has some skeleton pajamas that she loves, so we got these gloves to go with them.  As the product description states, these are intended more for a costume than warmth, so we probably won't use them outside on a cold day unless we can't find any other gloves.  However, she likes wearing them with her pajamas, and it's hard to beat a child who's happy at bed time!"
4.0,"very nice..comfortable.. a little long but, got in hemmed a looks great!"
4.0,It was perfectly fit to me.I love the dress and the quality of it.I’m very satisfied.
4.0,Fits like a glove product came fast I loved the outfit  it is a little thin so beware
4.0,Liked the color and the material was as expected. Would have preferred a larger neck as shown in the pic to do the off the shoulder look. Good overall though!
4.0,Got a lot of compliments my only complaint was it was a bit see-through
4.0,"Very good quality! I use these for hot yoga and they don't feel hot or bulky. Only thing I didn't like was the stitching seemed a little sloppy, I had to trim several extra sections off but overall very pleased"
4.0,"100% cotton, fits  just right."
4.0,"Good fit in waist and seat, legs are oversized, not bell bottoms or anything like that, but large as bell bottoms at the bottom and just as large all the way up,"
4.0,A bit see thru on left side!! Need lining init but cute!!
4.0,"Super cute ! Love the fit , but the print looks like it won’t last long :("
4.0,Perfect concept.  I've lost like 4 tuplbes of chapstick because they are a little to big
4.0,"In addition to being UPF pants, they are very comfortable."
4.0,"For the price alright. Surprised that they are still using paperboard in the manufacturing of wallets, so easy to switch to something that can get wet / damp and not grow mold or retain moisture. Good size and the card slots are terraced so it is a good wallet."
4.0,I am 5'9 167lb. 32 in waist. I chose medium. I am semi thin athletic build with slightly wider shoulders. The chest can hold an additional volume and perfect for additional layer. It goes halfway down my thigh.<br />it is indeed Gore-Tex waterproof and it's also breathable maintaining a nice core temperature.<br />The fabric is durable.<br />It's relatively thin for a parka Puff.<br />Not the most handsome and I look like a fisherman or a cylinder.<br />But hey my ass won't freeze when I'm driving or in the train because it covers my butt when I sit down and it's not too tight when I sit down.<br />Comparatively the therme in person has a slightly wider arms. I found that this Thorsen is more comfortable than the therm and easier to move in.
4.0,Great umbrella for my husband.
4.0,"Well, one note is that the apron is not a separate piece as it says in the description, but otherwise it is just as expected.  It fits me fine (I'm about a size 6) and is quite cute.  I was pleased that the lace headpiece is a headband-  I wasn't sure but that is just what I wanted.  A few of the ribbons have already come loose in the front, but they will be easy to fix, and for the price I'm not unhappy about that.  I was going to order a little kit with just the headpiece, cuffs, and apron, but I am much happier with the whole outfit for the same price.  Arrived very quickly."
4.0,Quality product at a great price! I did return it because even the XL was just too small for anyone with a larger chest.  It caused the waist to rise and look funny. Arrived on time and in perfect condition.
4.0,Nice lightweight summer socks for running or hiking. I have used two pairs so far and they have been holding great after multiple washings.
4.0,"nice, not too dark"
4.0,Good size. Unique.  The gold was less subdued than I like but I still like it. Wear it often.
4.0,"Very soft. Nice quality. I’m a Large or XL, so I went with XL. It was pretty big for an XL. But it’s really comfortable so I wear it for working out."
4.0,The product suitable for children only
4.0,It ripped when taking off. Still works for paintball I ordered a second for me and I’ll probably buy another for my buddy. Not bad for the price
4.0,"Bought these for my wife and she says ""Yoga fits well and had a nice and think material, yet is also very stretchy"""
4.0,"This socks are very well made. And, they would be great for winter. For summertime, they're way too hot. Look forward to wearing them come winter."
4.0,This bikini top is made from good quality material. It provides good coverage and I'm a 34 E. My only complaint is that it is a little difficult to straighten out the triangle shaped liners if they get twisted
4.0,Pretty blue color and stylish design. Fabric is a bit thin and fit is slightly small. Wish the hem was a bit longer.
4.0,"Received numerous compliments when wearing this dress. Very comfortable.  Only problem was while wearing it for the first time the zipper split open right in the middle. My back was exposed. Was so embarrassed.  The dress was not a tight fit, so that cannot be the cause.  Have only wore it this one time, so hopefully it doesn't happen again"
4.0,"These are not quite thick enough and the fingers not quite long enough to supply sufficient warmth for my needs. The description ""all seasons"" may not really apply for cold winter."
4.0,"They work wonderful and I love them!! My only complaint is that they are expensive and very easily lost as they are so small. With that said, I still think it's worth the investment."
4.0,This dress fits pretty well and is not too tight.  The material is not thin either.  It is a classy dress and I have receive many compliments on it!  I ordered a large and fit a size 8-10.
4.0,But its cute so it works well the finger chain ring part is big but its cute for the awesome price.
4.0,"Very cute and well made shirt, just way too big. Returned and was given full refund."
4.0,"This suit fits true to size, the colors are absolutely gorgeous and I love the pearl details. Downside is that this suit is not made for someone with a larger chest, my boobs are barely covered, but enough that I will wear it. I also had to add the extra neck straps to hold the top up, but thats ok. The bottom is high waisted but hits below the belly button. I'm 5'4&#34; and have a short torso.  All in all I would recommend this."
4.0,This was exactly what I would expect from a quality baseball cap. Not much more I can say.
4.0,Beautiful addition to my pandora bracelet. The detail on this charm is so pretty and very sweet.
4.0,My daughter is 5'8&#34; and very thin.  The medium was somewhat smaller than expected for a medium. She has been wearing it.  The material is very good quality however.  I would buy again.
4.0,"Fits great, beautiful color but faded after one wash horribly."
4.0,I love the strap but I am just little disappointed because I can't resize it to my liking.
4.0,"Photos show a normal/standard/typical 21-22"" bandana laid-over the green version of this XL bandana, as well as the single-sided printing.<br /><br />Across the diagonal (e.g. as typically tied for a scarf, headband, facecover), these are significantly longer/larger than a regular bandana.<br /><br />All three that I received are printed well-enough on one side in two (2) colors. Quality is ""typical cotton bandana"".<br /><br />Honestly, for most of my purposes, a standard 21-22"" bandana will work, but I'll definitely use these."
4.0,My grandson loved them and they fit true to size.
4.0,Very lightweight and cute. The clasp is a bit weird but I have to say they haven’t fallen off yet! Great hoops for the money
4.0,"Fits great, looks good. The fabric appears as if will last well."
4.0,My husband likes it and I think he looks great in it.  Good fit for athletic men.
4.0,This is a great set and is very attractive with beautiful colors.  The quality of the metal is a little cheap though so I worry it will break easily.
4.0,"I loved these, enough compression for the plane and when sitting on longer drives and also has extra cushion on the sole making them more comfortable for a lot of walking. Only problem is that they seem to pill and one has a runner in it already, I used 2 pair about  4 times each. I think they should last longer that that. These were my go to socks for the comfort, and they kept my feet warm too."
4.0,"The hats both look good and sturdy. They're just slightly large on my head, but will work just fine for my Wild West Scholastic Book Fair. Considering you get two hats, the price is great. If I could give 4.5 stars, I would - I'm knocking off one star (should be half) because of the fit."
4.0,"I bought these so I could continue to wear a favorite shirt that had its collar shrunken by a disreputable dry cleaner. It works perfectly for that or for any situation where you need just a *little* more room in the collar.<br /><br />These are, however, NOT suitable for people who who have gained significant amounts of weight and are in denial about it, but want to avoid buying new clothes. These will not help you if your neck has grown a size or more above the listed measuremnt on the shirt. If you are one of these people, the spring in these extenders will wear out quickly and you will be unsatisfied. To such individuals, I recommend eating healthier at exercising a minimum of 30 minutes a day."
4.0,"I like the classic style, face, features, etc, were what I wanted.  Two issues.<br />1. The light is very weak, really only lights up the left side of the face.<br />2. The band is short, thought I had bought a ladies style.  I couldn't go past the second notch in the band."
4.0,"The gold plating is starting to wear, but the ring is very cute and I get lots of compliments on it. Overall, worth the money."
4.0,I loved this dress. I bought it to wear as a beach cover-up to take on vacation with me in a couple of months. It is VERY soft and comfortable and I love the deep v-neck. I’m not sure I will wear it as a dress without a swimsuit under it as it feels a bit short for me (I am 5’6”) but I am rather conservative so most people probably would be fine wearing it as a dress.<br /><br />The one thing I would note is that the tassels looked slightly different on the screen for me than they did in person. They are rather neon in person but the colors are beautiful and vibrant either way.
4.0,"This is a set of silicone cord locks for mask ear loops. The locks consist of flat silicone beads, 3/8” in diameter. They have a wide opening on one end and a very small thread opening on the other. They ship in a plastic bag with no instructions.<br /><br />I find these cord locks work well, but they can be very frustrating to put on your loops since they come with no instructions. There is a little video for the product description, but the video shows only a few seconds of how to install this particular model of locks. It flashes by too quickly to figure out what’s going on, even if you freeze the video and go frame by frame. When I first looked at these locks in my hand, I figured there was no way to get them on my ¼” elastic loops. The exit hole is just too narrow. I tried poking them through with tweezers. No go. I tried tying them on thread on a needle, sending the needle through the hole, then pulling the thread to pull the elastics through. The thread broke. I switched to an upholstery thread, 2 strands, and pulled them through that way. Yes, it worked. Then I had to cut the thread. Tip: use a thread color that contrasts with your elastic color so you can see to cut it afterwards. Basically, these locks work well, but can be hard to figure out and are not easy to install without instructions."
4.0,Lasted me less than one year
4.0,This is a really beautiful purse and big enough to hold a phone and makeup. The handle folds down to one side if you want to use it as a clutch and the chain tucks inside without showing. The pocket inside is very small and may hold a credit card or i.d. I had to get small pliers to open the part that attached the chain to the purse after numerous attempts to do it by hand. That would be my only complaint. I plan to use this as a mother of the bride.
4.0,"A little short for me, but they are comfy and do their job"
4.0,"** I received this product at a discounted rate in return for an honest review **<br /><br />This is a very nice set. They are thick, so they would be appropriate for a man or woman who was interested in chain jewelry. It is the type of chain that lays flat. Darker shade of silver. It was very nice. They are well built and should last a long time. They are heavy, so if you are looking for delicate pieces this is not for you.<br /><br />I have very small wrists so the bracelet was huge on my arm. But it would work on my ankle well enough."
4.0,I picked this for my Grandmother for Mother's Day!! It came the next day was packaged well!! I opened it and it's sterling silver and very pretty!! It also has a gift bag to gift it and a cute little card!! I believe she is going to love it!! Great gift idea!!
4.0,Form fitting in XL
4.0,Helped conceal of the important spots
4.0,For the price great replacement lense
4.0,Good product. Easy to put in and out of my crocs. Looks like the picture.
4.0,"Very nice looking, high quality band. Does not come with pins to insert. Also looks much better with a black frame than a silver one."
4.0,Ive put on weight and normally wear a m/l.  I'm lower body heavy. ... So I got a XL.  Surprisingly it fits.  I'm 168lbs.... 5'7&#34;.... 36-31-45.5.  The swimsuit is cute.
4.0,Watch quality is spot on for a 20 dollars watch. The stop watch features don't work well at all. Would be better if they didn't move at all. Overall for a 20 dollar watch to beat on with little concern while looking good in a corporate setting.
4.0,"This is such a cute dress, but I've noticed the boob-area is a bit big. I'm a medium and a C-cup, but in this dress, it seems like you can be much larger! Other than that, it's very flattering and cute!"
4.0,I had to buy a 9M because they didn't have half sizes so the boots are a little big.  They are very comfortable and they keep my feet warm.  I've worn them all day long and done lots of walking in them and have had no problems.
4.0,"It fit ok with a belly band underneath but it's just a regular tshirt, not a maternity shirt. So the band helped with my belly to not poke out from the bottom. But I loved the design and people commented on it all day."
4.0,"Awesome mask!<br /><br />would have given it a 5 star but it makes a really annoying/Awkward loud Buzzing sound when you turn the LED at the brightest setting. :-( Albeit, it should not be an issue if you take it out to a festival, which I plan to do."
4.0,Very easy to breathe thru.  Used for mask mandates.
4.0,Adirable
4.0,"I like it but the lines haven't relaxed in the top from how it was shipped. I'll steam it but then the bow will probably come off as it's glued and not sewn on so I'll just sew it back on by hand. I kept it in the bathroom for the 3wks since my order in the hopes that the steam from the shower would do the job but it has not. Also, the color looks a little different: from the pics I thought it was an orange base  with stuff on it but it is a white base which is still fine, just not what I expected.<br />I'm fine with the color and I felt it was close enough to not take away another star. The 4 star rating is for the steaming and sewing I need to do. :)"
4.0,Keys were as expected and delivery time is amazing. the actual box/casing was damaged which is unfortunate but other than that everything was as described
4.0,"I bought this dress for my boyfriends military ball and I loved it. I'm 5'8 and 140 and ordered a  Small, this dress is long enough that my feet don't show (one of my pet peeves). It is a spandex material so it fits to your curves but I was able to wear a regular bra without my straps showing. I got many compliments and it was wonderful for the price. I would but this brand again. Thanks for a great product!"
4.0,"I listened to the reviews on this top and ordered down a size...apparently those that bought this never bought off the internet or know their true size.  This top is true to size, I should have went w/my instincts but, again, listened to reviews. So I will return it and reorder."
4.0,Cute. Fit well over athletic calves. Would fit larger legs if needed
4.0,"the piece itself makes a great gift, it does not feel flimsy and it works perfectly,  the chain however is garbage, so you may consider buying another one before gifting it..."
4.0,Good product for the price if you don’t mind waiting a couple of weeks.
4.0,"Cute shirt, runs small"
4.0,The dress had a few loose strings attached to it when I opened the package. Also was a one time wear type of dress.after the first wear the sleeves started to have little nit balls form up but other than that I love the dress it did wonderfull for my birthday!
4.0,"Returning for larger size. Otherwise, great look and feel."
4.0,Super soft and fit great! I love that they aren't see through so they can be worn with almost any top. Will be buying more in the future!
4.0,"Attractive and well made, but too small for my needs. Would only fit a couple of cards and a few folded bills. Zipper opening not wide enough to make access easy. Returned."
4.0,dainty cute cheap but holding up
4.0,Nice bracelets for spirit and fashion.
4.0,"Fits my Samsung Galaxy S7 Active well, and it hasn't faded yet.  That's one of the biggest problems I have with cases for my phone, so I'm happy about this one!"
4.0,Very cute . I gave four stars because it looks exactly like the picture and it was good quality . Unfortunately I have larger chest 34 DDD . I’m 120 lbs but it was still to small you could see my under bra . So I would not recommend this for larger bust women .
4.0,Nice...👜
4.0,It got here a day late and there was some glue visable but othet than that it wad beautiful. and I love it. have to have help putting it on.
4.0,"They fit a little snug, go up 1/2 size if you can. Other than that they’re so cute and I love the faux fur lining"
4.0,It's HUGE!
4.0,"Buena tela y elasticidad, 100% recomendada"
4.0,"Are you very pretty watch. However, the tool that they send to remove links does not work. I had to take it to a jeweler and he had to use a special hammer/punch to get the pins out. I guess that means it’s made well. I have not worn it as it will be a back up watch but it looks like a nice watch."
4.0,Great for water activities with full coverage.
4.0,Very good layering tanks
4.0,"good material, comfortable, fit and light. good value"
4.0,"Was casual, simple & comfortable but fits perfect & looks very nice with some high suede ankle blk heels & matching blk & wht purse, along with matching pearl earrings, bracelet & necklace."
4.0,"I initially ordered this dress based off my measurements and I felt it was too loose, it is stretchy and I wanted it a little more Va Va Voom!  I returned it and went down a size it is still not that tight. But I am much happier with it. Just for reference I am a 38 ddd normally wear a 10 or 12 on the bottom and a 16 on top.  Very nice dress and nice material most likely I’ll buy another one!"
4.0,"The overall size is not too large, but rather as you might expect. However, for me the leg opening was too large and the panty rode up, creating a panty line under clothing. Very comfotable otherwise."
4.0,Is Nice
4.0,This bag is a little more shallow than I expected. But it is fantastic as an airplane carry on.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:bbd8f91a6610357273b360d5e46d13d]] Están bonitas, bien terminadas. Sin embargo son muy débiles, esperemos cuánto durarán.<br />Creo que el precio es más por el empaque que por los mismas aretes, ya que la cajita si está súper fina y bonita.<br />En muy poco tiempo cambio el color y son muy débiles"
4.0,"Fit was great and the slip is beautiful. The only issue I had was I ordered the blush pink and it is definitely more peach in color. Otherwise, the slip was exactly what I expected and seller was very prompt with any concerns I had. I would order from them again."
4.0,"I bought the mask for a masquerade party, and  it turned out to be more than what I expected !!  I love everything about it.  Have not worn it yet, but I did try the mask on.  Yes, it cover's the face, and leaves  you ""eyes to the imagination"".<br /><br />OOOPPPPsssss, almost forgot.  I bought the mask to compliment my sexy dress!!!"
4.0,Gift for granddaughters birthdays
4.0,Bought this for someone after our relationship changed. I liked the idea of something more than just a card and I also liked the design of the card as well. Very nicely packaged and the person I gave it to was very happy. What more do you want?
4.0,Seems to work well.  I bought it specifically to maintain a silver plated vintage Dupont lighter.
4.0,Nice versatility and fit.
4.0,"Material is thinner and not as soft as I thought, but my nephew loved them!"
4.0,Fit great and was very cute
4.0,"Great product, color not what I was looking for."
4.0,Very nice band!! I thought they were connected pins but they are just clasped together. Makes it easy to remove links but I would have preferred pins. Just my preference but I still love the band none the less! Glad I purchased.
4.0,fits well  comfortable
4.0,"I bought one of these for my mom, and one for my wife.  They both loved them.  The only reason for the 4 star review is that the connecter is in fact plastic as others have mentioned.  The charm is metal.  All in all though, its a nice piece when mixed in with other beads on a bracelet someone would have to really examine it closely to tell it was not metal.  And for the price....what do you expect."
4.0,Fits well just not as loose as I thought it would be.
4.0,"I am a true size Large usually and this was too small in every direction for me.  I think it would be just fine a size up so that's something to keep in mind.  Even with the extra tightness across the chest, the peekaboo cutout wasn't too revealing for me and I think would be nice on most figures."
4.0,I think these earrings are super cute.
4.0,"I ordered a Large and I normally wear a S/ 4 dresses and tops / 6 pants at J Crew. The L fit me well. It's not too rate quality but for the price it is what I expected. To my surprise none of the sequins fell off. However both tassels came off, after one wash the gold cord did not look nice (the golden wrapping started to show the black base cord underneath). This is really itchy around the shoulders and there are loose threads. If you don't mind the scratchiness then this does photograph well."
4.0,"Works good, doesn't hold the fit bit real tight.  I like the look."
4.0,I liked the value
4.0,Gorgeous-love Woodies!
4.0,It is warmer than it looks.
4.0,"Nice wallet, didn't suit me due to getting cards out of the slots was not convenient. Maybe when it gets broken in it will not be a challenge to get cards out of it."
4.0,I like these alot. Comfortable and do there job while am doing mine for 12hrs. Only complaint they are long I roll em down a little. I got XL and am 5'11 so would be very long on most woman.
4.0,"These are reasonably soft and fit well. I'm 5'9&#34;, 150 pounds and athletic. They did slip down around my knees, but were thin enough to accomodate a garter belt at the top. They're worth the price, functional and as described, but not luxurious."
4.0,Could be better if they make it waterproof.
4.0,Aunq no es el mismo color que pedí este color. Es menos vivo esta bonito el vestido muy bien acabado pero queda un poco grande pedi XL pero me hubiera quedado perfecto el L
4.0,"True to fit, but thick material"
4.0,Cute and a nice fit
4.0,"I bought these for my little girls as dress up and play jewelry. They are perfect. Please know, they are not fine jewelry. They are nice enough to wear daily, but cheap enough for my girls to keep in their little personal jewelry boxes and not have to worry about them losing something valuable."
4.0,Seems like the perfect cap!! A little big on me but I have a small head. The fabric is beautiful and the buttons are perfect. Support this small business and order it!
4.0,I'm giving it 4 stars because the sizing is off it runs very small. I originally bought this for me. I ordered an XXL for myself and it was way too small.  I gave it to my daughter who is a size small and it fit her perfectly. I dont think this was really an XXL. However the material is really soft and comfortable and my daughter loves it.
4.0,"Very cute mittens, my adult daughter really like them!  The only problem is that they took over a month to get here from China, and they didn't make it in time for Christmas."
4.0,"They feel a little uncomfortable after few hours,  but for the price...no complaints"
4.0,"Love the fit. After it gets washed, it shrinks so you want it to order a size up if the size you wear is fitted on you."
4.0,Returned - too big for my phone.
4.0,"I received this bathing suit in return for a review. It is actually very well made and flattering to my figure. As far as I can tell, the colors do not bleed or fade. The fit of the top is a bit awkward, and I wouldn't say that it is my personal style, but I would recommend it to others. The sizes do run very small, but the chart provided makes it easy to determine which size to buy."
4.0,Very cute but do not like the weird distortion. I kept to wear occasionally.
4.0,"Not the outside but the inside... your wallet disappears into a black hole and will turn sideways and is difficult to get out and then the entire pocket turns inside out when you take out your wallet of the pocket... looking even goofier.<br />Other than that, I really like the shorts... but I'm getting the back pockets narrowed."
4.0,"Warm.  Loc Wearers look out.  The Terry Cloth Fabric can leave Lint on your head.  Suggestion, wear a cap under to protect your Locs."
4.0,Like how they made
4.0,Really cute pendant that can also be used as a brooch.  The pearl is not real though. But cute anyway.
4.0,Bought it for my mum and she really liked it!
4.0,Bought for my son and he loves it looks great very light weight and helps him not get sunburn fits really well. will definitely order more
4.0,"Good price, well described, saved going hunting in a retail outlet... very happy"
4.0,"Very nice, just too short to wear without tights"
4.0,I liked the shorts but they fit like underwear without any give so I was able to wear them a short while before they ripped.
4.0,"This is a luxurious knit fabric, washed and dried, and was ready to wear.  The longer side was almost too long on my petite frame, but I wear it as loungewear, with a pretty belt and necklace or scarf it will look nice to wear to dinner or to church. Each piece could be worn with contrasting colors too, it is a versatile outfit, with many possibilities."
4.0,The bracelet was packaged beautifully and looks as good as in the pictures.<br />The only thing is i was expecting the evil eye pendant on it but received the heart.
4.0,The snaps instead of buttons was a surprise...
4.0,fell great on the feet and has good support.
4.0,"This is a nice base layer shirt but no compression as described in the heading.  I normally wear Large in compression shirts to wear under my shirts and cycling jerseys so I assumed this would fit the same.  The neck hole was a little bigger than I expected, but the torso was fitted, but felt no compression like my other shirts.  The sleeves were loose.  They had no compression at all and were a little baggy. It's still a nice base layer for everyday wear under a tee shirt, but doesn't work me for compression under my cycling jersey."
4.0,A little bit too big but love it
4.0,Soft. Fits great. Color’s good. Love it.
4.0,I bought this wig in magenta to jazz up my outfit for the color run and loved it! I got so many compliments and I'm already plotting other ways to get some use out of it. I knocked off a star because it felt just a little thinner than I expected and I found the bangs somewhat hard to manage. I ended up having to pin them off to the side in order to function
4.0,"These jeans are SUPER cute. They are well made and distressed in exactly the right places. I am a size 20 in jeans and I bought 2 pairs, one 2xl and one 3xl. They both fit but there is quite a bit of room left in each. They are very stretchy and they loosen up after wearing them for an hour or so. Overall though a great well made pair of jeans. I was pleased with the purchase however I do the the size chart is a little off"
4.0,"Good product.  Seems like the plastic bridge is going to wear out and break eventually, but all the others I've have like this feel that way too."
4.0,Beautiful but must have a flat stomach.
4.0,"Grandma loved it, it made a great Mother's day gift from the boys.  The bracelet itself looks really nice, the rhinestones in the pendant are a little cheap and shiny.  We'll see how well the &#34;silver&#34; wears."
4.0,"I like these a lot, though they were somewhat bulkier than I expected. Still, they look really cute with boots, goulashes, or even just as leg warmers!"
4.0,This was good quality and the seller did a great job with attractive packaging and instructions about the care of the product. It wasn't professional enough for what I needed.
4.0,Looks like it will work just fne
4.0,"My little one's favorite pjs. They are sometimes tough to get her feet into because of the elastic ring at the ankles, but they stay put which is good"
4.0,"In the picture the colors on this dress are muted and the design is not well defined, which I like very much. Unfortunately when the dress arrived the colors were bright and garish and way too blinding for me. I like the one in the picture. I like the way it’s made. I like the fit. It just does not look anything like the picture in so far as the fabric colors and design are concerned. Yikes! They should fix the picture or make it look like the one advertised.<br /><br />Update and one more star!  I received my refund 24 hours after I asked for it. I’d say the company is really on the ball."
4.0,My wife says she likes the fit.  It is comfortable.  The only issue is it needs to be pressed.
4.0,"I ordered the 5x grey pair of these pants. Ladies, this fits beautifully as a 2x, which is what I anticipated. The color is precisely what it seemed in the photo.  I live in Florida and so thin loose fabrics are important to me.  I will update this review once it has seen the wash a few times to report on durability. The material IS thin--enough so  that I felt it important to wear undergarments that match my skin tone.  The waist band contains a wide elastic band, which feels durable.  At the time of this writing, I am very pleased."
4.0,"I have received so many compliments on this, I should have ordered two - one for each ear! I do wish the back felt more secure, I don't feel the little push on the post you normally feel to make sure it's secure."
4.0,"I got a couple of these sets and had an extra for myself to wear. I've been wearing it nonstop for about a week now and my only complaint is that the hair tie tends to fall off on occasion. Perhaps if the sides were a bit higher this wouldn't be a problem, but this hasn't been enough to take away from the usefulness of the product. Otherwise it is a high quality cuff that is stylish with or with a hair tie on it."
4.0,"I ordered this dress because I needed a more conservative black staple dress for the occasional function.  I am 5'3"" and my measurements fell on the higher end of the ""Large"".  I stuck with a large because I didn't want the dress to be too long on me.  It's a little snug around the middle, but it's stretchy so not uncomfortable.  It will look nice with heels.  I would recommend sizing up if you are in between sizes.  If you stay true to size, it fits much tighter than it does on the model in the listing."
4.0,"Liked the look and fit. A little stiffer than expected (surprizing with only 5% poly). I live in the tropics and the top being unlined makes for a bit of discomfort..I will likely line by hand myself. Got lots of unexpected compliments,yay.  I bought a large and I am 5ʻ4ʻʻ bust 40, waist 32 about 140lbs and typically a size 8."
4.0,Super cute but extremely thin. I don't mind cause our Easter it was 80+ degrees. One of the straps had the buttons sewed on backwards or I would give it 5 stars.
4.0,"Love love love.. I just received them today from my mailbox very neatly packaged and very sparkly. It came with a pink cute pouch to hold them on also a small cloth to wipe them . Not too heavy for my ears, love them"
4.0,"love the look of the ring. dont like the way stones are set in. kinda looks cheaply made, but ring is pretty"
4.0,Thanks for the prompt delivery. Shirt looks great!
4.0,"Nice dress. When stretched at the bust, fabric is a bit white, so size up if bustier."
4.0,Mittens fit well. The strap is a nice feature. The design is super cute although after a month of wearing it is starting to peel off. (Use in Michigan)
4.0,"It was a great new years dress, I got a lot of compliments but to be quite honest I didn't like how high the slit went up and it really hugged my belly. I am 5'3 190lb. got an XL and it fit well"
4.0,I like it I really do for the size being the largest size I thought it would be bigger but it fits well. I'm very happy with it and hopefully when more come into stock I will purchase more.
4.0,"The bracelet doesn't say real sterling silver , so if u buy this product and didn't read ... Ur at ur own fault . Just saying"
4.0,Great gift for a Pooh fan in your life.
4.0,I have never filled out a dress like this. It's push up and push out. Order one size bigger.
4.0,"The pattern is very pretty. I do not like the feel of the dress, was assuming it would be a cotton feel. It’s more satin/stretchy. And when stretched too far it is kinda see through. I’m 5’8” and not really long enough I like my maxis to touch the ground."
4.0,Ordered a 12 and they were too small. They fit about a size smaller. They were soft and thick
4.0,Beautiful handbag but a little different the color from the picture.
4.0,"Gloves feel and look wonderful.  However, disappointed in the sizing.  The XXL was to be a 9.5 and they arrived at size 9."
4.0,"Sound quality sucks. LEDs are medicore. But hey, it's a keychain."
4.0,Fits great and good price.
4.0,It is a little tight but not by much. Do not go by picture as it does not have a flair like it shows. More straight than full.
4.0,"Very synthetic material. To much of the ""plastic"" feeling."
4.0,Good looking and very comfortable to wear.
4.0,"Very effective. Will dry out over time, keep oiled with cedar oil."
4.0,"This dress fits great. I'm 5'5 170 lbs, 30 inch waist 36DD. I got a Large, and it's a bit big on top but I think it's a really good fit. The sleeves are really long! I docked a star because the fabric looks worn after one wash. Still worth the investment, but I probably wouldn't get a solid color as it would look dingy fast."
4.0,"Really love this, would have given 5 stars if it ran a little larger in size. Can't beat the price compared to Lula roe. I like that it's not a waterfall front and that it has a hoodie. Will order again. Runs about a size smaller."
4.0,"I'm your standard sweaty guy. I try to run as much as I can and these help a ton keeping sweat out of my eyes. Things are much smoother when I'm not wiping my face every few minutes. The only issue with these headband are their size. My head would be considered Large by helmet standards and the band are a bit tight, I deal with it just fine and they may loosen up after a while but the wife, whose head is smaller than mine, hates how tight they are."
4.0,Very nice quality. Not thin - it has nice heft but it runs short (not really small. just shorter than you expect)
4.0,These pants fit well at the waist - true to size.  The hips were narrow so the pockets pulled out.  They come unfinished so they will need to be hemmed.  Nice material that looks great.
4.0,I loved it .  Just the right size.<br />Thanks
4.0,"I really like the way this dress fits, especially the empire waist and v-neck. Most dresses in this style have the square neckline that I'm unable to wear. The color is very vibrant and over all the dress is light weight. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because this fabric wrinkles very easily so I don't think it will travel very well. I am 5'10 and this dress hits me just below my knees."
4.0,"Beautiful dress! Wore to a wedding in Austin, TX in Feb. I am 5'6&#34; 115# and it came to a few inches above my knees (medium). White parts are a tad sheer, but didn't matter, as the colorful parts cover what needs covering. Wore a self-adhesive bra with it (I'm AA cup). Worked very well. I will say that the arm holes are large, so leaning forward in some positions you could see the bra, but avoiding that is possible.  Overall, I would recommend the dress! :)"
4.0,Show off them shoulders!
4.0,The are just as described.
4.0,Cute but go one size up.
4.0,"They were gifts and she said she loves them, everyone's ask her were she got them from? )"
4.0,Great pants and very comfortable. Becoming one of my fav pants to wear on a daily basis. My only issue is that after the first wash I found hole in the crotch area. I wish I had seen it earlier so I could have exchanged before washing.
4.0,"Happy! Happy! Happy!<br />Super warm and cute coat for girls. My daughter gets compliments every time she wears it. Very unique style, made with quality products. The colors of the faux fur are very vibrant. Comes with coordinating charms that the little ladies love. Customer service assisted in a snap to answer my question. Will order another style from this vendor/brand. Worth buying."
4.0,Really cute shirt but it does flare out at the bottom quite a bit. I just adjusted the seam so it fit alittle better.
4.0,Neat pack but the zippers are kind of sharp. Other than that it has a lot of cool little pockets and it's nice that it hangs in the front.
4.0,Looks as pictured and is great quality. The only thing is that it’s a little shirt in the arms and legs for me - I ordered a Med and I’m 5’11. Fits everywhere else.
4.0,"I was looking for an item like this.  I have lost 2 Fitbits due to the bands getting loose or snagged on clothing.  I wanted a necklace long enough to tuck into my shirt for work, but nice enough if I wanted to wear casually.  This is a great length.  It is easy to open and take on and off.  My only concern with the necklace is the chain.  The chain tends to get twisted throughout the day.  It is easily untangled.  I don't know the long-term effects on the chain.  Anyways, for $18, I can't complain too much."
4.0,"Color was not as bright and colorful as in the photo. ..darker and just a little muddy, otherwise a handsome accessory."
4.0,"This is so comfy!! I would purchase it again! Only thing I wish was different is the bottoms , I wish the bottoms covered my butt more then they do!"
4.0,Took a while to get here. But I got it and granddaughter loves it all.
4.0,"I little hard to maneuver in the piercing but super cute and well made, I haven’t had any irritation. Did take a few tries to figure out which end to start with, so a little diagram with a visual showing possible placements and how-to would have been really helpful."
4.0,"I like this dress. The front gaps open, but I use a safety pin to secure it, and it looks just fine. I’ve had many compliments on the dress. The fabric wears extremely well."
4.0,I liked the way they fit and the price
4.0,It had a hole in it. But still love the shirt
4.0,Little larger than I had hoped for but pretty
4.0,You'll need something to hold these onto your luggage handle. The velcro closure will come loose with use. I placed tape strips around the ends of these to secure them. They do serve as a identification when picking up your luggage from the carousel so they are handy and they do make handling the luggage a bit easier.
4.0,Colors were a little off but overall it's definitely worth the buy! They are a good quality material and the perfect length for my man 6'2
4.0,Works fine.  Looks good.  Only thing is the buckle face could be a little thicker. I got a small dent in it the first week
4.0,"Nice size, the pockets help organize."
4.0,Stays relatively stiff even after wearing it for awhile but still pretty nice.
4.0,Slots for cards is a bit to tight to get them out once you fill every slot. This makes it a bit difficult.
4.0,Nice dress dissapointed with sizing. Order a XXL and didnt fit where I am normally a L or XL.
4.0,Gave these as a gift to my nephew. We both really liked them. He will let me know how they do once he starts wearing them. So far so good though.  They are beautiful
4.0,Very nice and stylish.I really recommend it.ive ordered items that dont live up to the pic. But this one is nice.
4.0,like the flattering look
4.0,Sorry this product looks like a maid uniform on. I would not wear it on the court
4.0,"Colors of these hats are exactly as pictured, which I greatly appreciate. I live way up on the North Shore of Lake Superior in MN, and these hats are warm even on the coldest days. Soft inside. They aren't quite as roomy/floppy on the top as pictured and fit a little more snug than similar hats I've purchased (I have a growing collection, living up here, you just kinda have to). However, they are priced lower than similar hats as well, and the lining in these is really soft and warm. Solid purchase."
4.0,Like the coverage
4.0,"The ring is very slim and lightweight.  With it's metallic sheen it does not appear two toned.  My daughter says it is difficult to spin, but I do not find it to be.  Overall, I like the ring."
4.0,All in all great item.
4.0,"I like it but unless you have a suuuuper short skirt, it's not opaque enough to feel like sheer tights. Feels more like light leggings. Great for staying warm on Halloween! Not great for a hot day at Disneyland. Thanks!"
4.0,"I love this dress. The material is kind of odd, as it feels more so like a table cloth. I would say it runs slightly larger than expected. The back of the dress was loose around the neck and back area. I did purchase a petticoat to wear with this. It looked nice, and I received a lot of compliments. My only complaint, before I even wore the dress, I had to refasen the buttons, as they were already super loose.<br />I would repurchase this dress if I went back. No regrets on this one."
4.0,"the dress is super cute! the material is really soft. it fit me nicely around the shoulders & chest. i did order a medium, and could have gone with a small but not a big enough difference to send it back. it's also a nice length. i am 5'8 and it hit my right above the knee. plus, it has pockets!! can't go wrong with that. i may purchase another in a different color."
4.0,"Not as pink on the face, quality product but a very light shade of silvery pink on the watch face."
4.0,The dress is high quality. I knocked off a star because it is see through and you can see my bra. I will have to ear the dress with black leggings.
4.0,"The dress is very comfortable, stretchy, true to size, but very cheap quality. Not worth $23 more like $15. I'm 5 ft 5 a 185 pounds and I ordered an extra large because of the reviews, but a large would have done just fine."
4.0,Looks like a curtain. lol but still cute.
4.0,If you have any boobs the sweat shirt will be short. I ordered a large and a DD and it’s hung on my boobs can only wear sweatshirt when I have a sports bra.
4.0,"These are SO soft!!!<br />They have two clasps for smaller and bigger necks and they're just so cute!<br />The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the coloring on the cross one is yellow rather than Creme colored,"
4.0,"Pros:<br />*I got the silver color and it's so beautiful!<br />*Comfortable fabric.<br />*Looks way more expensive than it was.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*Like others mentioned, it runs small. I normally wear a size small but I got a medium and it fit perfectly.<br />*It's (really) long and will have to be hemmed. I'm 5'2&#34; and even being pulled all the way up and with 5&#34; heels, it still drags a little."
4.0,A little flimsy but they do the job.  Sometimes I cannot even feel them on my face...that's how light they are!
4.0,"I like it. It looks like a very nice quality watch. Can’t see the date at all though. It’s super tiny. The number marks and hands are light against a light background so it’s a little harder to see than I thought it would be at a glance. Also, this is quite heavy and thick. I had to take out some links and can’t quite get a perfect fit. It’s either too tight or a little loose. I’m keeping it. My husband thinks it looks great. There’s nothing at all wrong with it. It’s all just personal preferences. I do think it’s a decent quality from what I can tell so far."
4.0,Very cute.  A little smaller than expected but will work fine.
4.0,"I am a tall woman with a 35"" inseam, so I chose to order a men's cloak to go with my Rhaenyra costume for Halloween. I'm glad I did. It dragged a little, but that's what I wanted; people didn't hem their regal garments in medieval times! It was a little hard to keep it from sliding up in the front where it hooked, so sometimes it felt like it was choking me, if I was sitting down moving around too much (i.e. reaching & handing out candy from our pavilion tent. It also slid off to the side a lot if I was moving around too much. All in all, I would buy it again, but I would know ahead of time to find a way to secure that front clasp so it doesn't ride up or sideways."
4.0,My niece loves dangly earrings. I like the idea of wings. She put them in immediately upon getting them and loves them. They are light so they don't weigh down her ear lobes.
4.0,These arrived on time and are beautiful. They are surprisingly easy to use. However you do have to make sure you clip the earrings firmly as they will slip down and hang off your ear.
4.0,"Looks very nice, quality feels decent. Im 5'10 215, with a more muscular frame, im always stuck between xl and XXL and typically have to try things on. Went with the XL and it's a comfortable snug they way I like it. If I had smaller arms and shoulders at 215 it would probably be a perfect fit."
4.0,Shoes look very nice but aren't as comfortable as I thought they would be. Material is hard and a little heavy. They're also a lot shinier in person.
4.0,Perfect fit and so pretty on!
4.0,"The price was right, and camo was the right color.  Fit is fine also.  It is pretty light weight, which is what I was looking for - early season archery, so it gets hot.  I'll buy again when I eventually lose it."
4.0,"Had to bring the straps in they were a little awkward and kept falling down but that was a quick fix with needle and thread / could have probably wore a small , but I got compliments all day long<br /><br />155 lbs 5&#34;2 I bought medium."
4.0,Works well. Had ro push hard to get over ear piece. But that helps keep it secure.
4.0,"Camouflage is not very noticeable, but I like that. Fit is great and it is very comfy. It is a great length for leggings."
4.0,"I'm going to get this out of the way first: this is branded as a ""Keevoom"" coat on the product page. You won't see that name anywhere on the coat, which is branded as ""V.T.ADR169 Outdoorjack"" on the hood, tag, and right breast. I looked up Keevoom, and the trademark for that company was just filed from China a few months ago on July 26, and with the global supply chain crunch there's no way this coat was manufactured and shipped here in that time. So just be aware you're getting a coat that was manufactured before the company that is selling it existed. That's not necessarily a good or bad thing, but something important to note.<br /><br />The coat itself has some minor stitching issues around pocket zippers (see picture for an example), but overall is comfy to wear, isn't too bulky, and does a good job of keeping me warm in chilly weather. It hasn't dipped below freezing here yet but if the coat doesn't perform as expected I'll come back and update this review.<br /><br />This coat is perfectly sized if you wear thin clothes under your coat, but if you're the kind of person that likes to wear hoodies or otherwise layer up under the coat you will probably want to order a size up. The arms in particular are snug already and will be tight while wearing a sweater or light jacket.<br /><br />The inner fleece-like lining is made of polyester but is still very comfortable, and I like how the top of the coat and hood can do a good job of enclosing my face. Besides the usual waist pockets, there is also an outer pocket on the left breast and an inner pocket on the same side, halfway between the breast and waist pockets.<br /><br />If this had been a winter coat I saw in stores in the usual $100-$150 range, I would have called this coat average. But the coat's biggest selling point is its price, which right now is in the $45-$50 range. That makes this coat a really good buy, even if you only get a season or two out of it."
4.0,Not loose fitting..more tapered
4.0,Nice strap but a little thin
4.0,The bag itself is durable and i love the size and pockets! However the zippers and buckles are very cheap.
4.0,Color is not as pink as the picture makes it but it is very comfy
4.0,Y used to gym is very good
4.0,"Cute dress, but too big on me. The side tie makes it flattering and helps to hide the post baby tummy.  I’m 5’3, 105lbs. I thought the length was good."
4.0,"I'm 5'8&#34;, 155 lbs and ordered the large. The torso is a little bit short, but it's still wearable. The material under the lace is soft and stretchy, with a nice weight and drape to it. The strange thing is, I ordered two different colors--green and lavender--in the exact same size, but I had to return the lavender because it was cut shorter than the green. It was above my knees, whereas the green dress is above my knees underneath the lace, but the lace covers my knees. The green one is a good 2-3 inches longer than the lavender. So I'd advise trying another color or even a different one of the same color if you love the dress but find it's not exactly the length you want. It seems they can vary widely in how each is cut."
4.0,Beautiful but swings around on Pandora bracelet. Quite a large charm.
4.0,Came faster than stated fits nicely
4.0,It is a good product to buy...I had to alter it to fit my physique..notwithstanding that I received several compliments.
4.0,"Took a chance with no reviews and I actually love it. Looks like picture, shipped faster than expected and it's comfortable not itchy. Went size up and it's a little big but have not washed it yet."
4.0,The company was very helpful but it was way too small in the bust.
4.0,Nice pattern and cut to the dress. The fabric is the only reason not to have this as a 5 star.
4.0,I recommend these shoes they are very comfortable and attractive.
4.0,Copper fit compression socks provide relief for tired sore feet. Material is good quality.
4.0,"I purchased this neckless in the 9mm thickness at a 16-inch length for my wife. She was looking to replace a broken neckless that she used to support a small pendant. Sadly, this item is too fragile to serve as a pendant carrier. In addition, the packaging is quite generic for a piece of jewelry. The quality and crafting seem fine."
4.0,Love this band and it’s comfortable and not sweaty and very adjustable
4.0,This is so sexy and soft. Only the stones came off easy but otherwise drove my man crazy and looks amazing.
4.0,Overall a nice hat.  The reason for the four star is because the material beneath the bill is not sewn through the bill.  Only the top is stitched.  The bottom is loose.  Over time this may droop.
4.0,"Fit well enough, but had kind of an odd bouffant bump at the back, possibly a result of shipping in its package? Good quality wig, though, otherwise."
4.0,Got this for a gift for my bother and sister in law. They're pregnant and she really seemed to like the pattern. The material was nice cotton ... some of the Asian clothing I found is deceiving and comes as a spandex type material that I do not care for this was not one of those.
4.0,I LOVE how soft they are. BUT the souls are Super hard and ridged. They Have no give to them.
4.0,Great quality of dress
4.0,"Very cool for robot costume, just don't expect be able to wear outside at night (eg. Trick or treating)."
4.0,"These are comfortable, and thin enough not to interfere with the fit of the shoes with don't work well with my handknit wool socks.  The fiber content is not as much wool as their being billed as wool socks would lead me to expect:  wool 35%, cotton 29%, polyester 36%.  The standard for sock wool sold to knitters is wool 80%, nylon 20%, with the nylon added to increase durability, and I toss them into the washer and dryer without any resulting problems; in fact, I have some which I've cared for this way which are over 20 years old and still going strong.  The care instructions for these say not to put them in a hot dryer.<br /><br />As a result, my feelings about these socks are mixed.  We'll see how they do, and I may revise the rating up or down.<br /><br />If my review was helpful, please click the button below."
4.0,Underwire hurts
4.0,"Gets tons of compliments and so fun to wear! My only complaint is that on the pointer finger one of the notches rubs against my knuckle, luckily I can move it to the side so it’s not that big of a problem but still something to think about"
4.0,"Super soft, great graphics.  Sized properly.  The material is a bit thin so the feet may wear out sooner than desired though."
4.0,"This was great quality, however, the skirt was at least a size too large for me. Measurements for me are approximately 24-25x33-34. It was loose everywhere.  They just need at least a size smaller available to fit anyone who is a 00-2. I’m not returning because luckily there is just a simple surge seam down both sides so I can take it in really easily."
4.0,"This fits well.  I always wanted a waist shaped, but to be honest it has been over a month since I purchased it & I have only  worn it twice.  I have long nails, so clipping all those 100 clips makes it a challenge of its own.  Before purchasing really think if you have 15-20 available in the morning before headed to work. If you do than this will work for you, I rather sleep. :)"
4.0,Very pretty and comfortable dress. The size was a bit larger than I was expecting in the bust area but overall a great purchase.
4.0,"I lost one of my gloves last month, so I thought I'd give these a try. The outside are a stretchy material like a spandex blend, which gave me pause initially. But then I looked inside and saw the plush lining and put them on. They fit perfectly and kept my hands warm. I didn't have them on for an extended period outside, but I didn't feel the heavy, cold winds while walking to the car from my house or while walking through a large parking lot to the store. One note: I found that you must be a bit more 'deliberate' when using the gloves with a touchscreen phone. I'm fine with that, just don't try to type a novel or you will get frustrated at the multiple 'taps' needed for each action."
4.0,the waistband in the photo looks wide but its only about 1&#34; so they dont flatten my tummy as much as i had hoped but they're comfy for around the house
4.0,I just needed them for an 80% theme party they are really thin I don’t see them lasting long if someone where’s them all the time
4.0,Would love to give a five star rating but this is a bit more flimsy then expected
4.0,What can you say about compression shorts?  They compress.
4.0,"I am 5.3 200lbs. The dress is a little too snug on the chest, but I where a blouse or t-shirt over it. The color is not as vivid as show online, but more like a watercolor lavender."
4.0,"Less than 108 beads :(<br /><br />Everything else I was hoping for. Pretty, light and easy to maneuver with. If you are just looking for a fashion bracelet this is perfect! If you are actually hoping for a mala bracelet it might be best to go more authentic."
4.0,shes between an 8-10 and we ordered them they fit her perfectly shes fairly leggy so it was nice to finally find a pair of dance pants that fit her correctly.
4.0,"great product, although the XXL was huge and the XL was a little tight.  fabric, styling, and look spot on."
4.0,"The quality of this dress is unexpectedly great considering how it was only ~$20. It's made of a thick material and the pattern is beautiful (i got the multi-colored white dress with butterflies). The measurement guide is dead on for the bust, so even if you're slightly on the upper end of the measurement, I'd recommend going a size up. I personally have a 40'' bust, but I have a smaller waist and wide hips, so I thought I could get away with ordering a Large and just squeeze a little. However the material doesn't stretch at all, so I wish I would've gotten an XL instead."
4.0,Fits loose as was expected nice too for jeans and doesn't wrinkle
4.0,Dress was really cute but too tight in the bust. Im normally a 38DD and I just knew if was uncomfortable trying it on I wouldn't be able to wear it for long.
4.0,After 40 years in F&B I can truly say that shoes for crews are the most slip resistant shoes I have worn. Not slip proof but slip resistant. My only criticism is that I only get about 6 months out of each pair before they start to split in the soles and rip where the shoe meets the sole. Every pair every time.
4.0,These are great dress gloves. sleek smooth and stylish.  The lining lacks a little for cold weather.  We live in Colorado and these are great gloves for dress but not for snow or extreme cold.
4.0,Way too big for my 2 month old but she'll fit in them one day.
4.0,"I actually bought this nightgown for some test shots of Christmas/Santa photos a friend of mine was doing with my daughter.  My daughter is VERY &#34;girlie/froo froo/princessy&#34; and I figured I would be buying this nightgown and she would wear it once.  If it doesn't have a unicorn, cat, princess etc...on it, she won't wear it.  When I rec'd it I had her try it on to make sure it wasn't too large.  She put it on and would not take it off.  So on a 90+ degree night, she wore this to bed.  She said it was the softest nightgown she ever had. (She even wore it home from the test shot session!!!)  It was a pleasant surprise to know she loved it so much"
4.0,"Love these, however it ripped at the seem on one of the outer pant legs bear the pocket"
4.0,"These are really cute earrings. I have sensitive ears and these didn't make them turn red or itch, so that was nice for the low price! I normally can't wear less expensive jewelry. The only thing I would say I don't like is the style in person is more<br />teenager-y than I would have liked. But the size is great and they work well with very casual outfits."
4.0,material a  little  lighter than  expected
4.0,I love this dress. The material is very nice and soft.....the cut and flow of the dress is very nice too.
4.0,"I'm a size 16 and the 14/16 was a comfortable and flattering. The bust area, waist and butt are a good fit. The legs are a little too big. This garment is thin and does not offer any additional warmth in the pool but was very comfortable during my AquaFit class. I like the product."
4.0,"This is a delightfully super comfy top, loose and lightweight. It is thin so it's not for warmth but for comfort. I love my sweatshirt so much I ordered another but was lost in the mail. I will probably order it again."
4.0,Beautiful I ordered size Xl but I received size L and look and feel nice
4.0,I had been looking for this shoe for sometime. Found the grey in the mall but still wanted the black and this seller had it. I was ecstatic. Ordered right away and product was sent right away. Very pleased!
4.0,"Somewhat small but, that encouraged me to lose some weight. After losing 10 pounds it fits great."
4.0,Most of my purchases were great and I would definitely buy and recommend them to family and friends.
4.0,"A bit longer than I was expecting. I'm 5'7&#34; and mine came down to my mid-calf, even when it sat on my high waist."
4.0,"Really nice quality. We don’t use it for washing delicates, we use it to store bathtub toys and it works quite well. Additionally, poring his toys from the bag into the bathtub has measurably improved his enthusiasm for getting into the bath."
4.0,I weigh 145 pounds 5 foot six would normally take a small and ordered a medium as suggested and was super tight especially around my chest. I am returning it for a large but have to wait another three weeks which is disappointing
4.0,Very cute but sleeves were too baggy should of ordered down a size instead of up!
4.0,Love the look of these earrings. They were just a little heavy for me and I couldn’t wear them long.
4.0,"I’m wearing one of the smaller ones, but I love that the pack came with multiple sizes. They are a good price and they are cute!"
4.0,I love this pink leather infinite and love symbol bracelet. It looks so pretty. I put it on when I'm dressing casual and it really completes the look.
4.0,Versatile- I wore it with leggings for warmth and so I didn't have to be conscientious about every movement. Some of the colors could be easily dressed up.
4.0,Cheap material.  Returned this robe.
4.0,Absolutely adorable earrings 🥰
4.0,Fun socks for my 1 year old. Runs large.
4.0,"I bought the Taupe color, but it wasn't quite like I expected based on the image.  I know different monitors/screens display color differently, but I think I ended up with a Beige instead of Taupe.  I liked the purse well enough to keep it (though the internationally shipping for returns may have had more to do with keeping it) The size is perfect and I really like the style.  Just wish the color had been a bit darker/more gray."
4.0,"Great for summer outdoor play or staying home. They are very thin, so durability might be an issue. That being said, they look great and my kiddo liked them."
4.0,"Used for cosplay, and it looks very nice! It's the right size."
4.0,Nice fit.  Decent amount of support.  No complaints.
4.0,"I like it.  Light weight, functional, good quality for the price."
4.0,"Love the color of this top. My only complaint would be that the material is so thick. I would have liked a lighter fabric. Regardless, it is a nice top."
4.0,"Super supernatural. If you're looking for a bag, get this one. It's made out of a nice material, it looks good. I only hold off on a star because I can fit only about three or four binders in it."
4.0,"These worked for me.  I was worried they would be too small from all the reviews, but I am small, so I went for it.  The cup size is accurate but you would benefit from ordering 1 to 2 sizes up for band."
4.0,I would have given it 5 starts but white terry cloth material across the front band shows... Please change it to match color of bonnet
4.0,"Do you have any idea how many times we have purchased belts in this family that promised that they were leather, only to have them crack or fall apart rather quickly?  Of course you don't!  But let me give you a hint- TOO MANY!  Let's take a look at this belt.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS BELT LIKE?<br />This belt is supposed to be 100% full grain leather.  It comes rolled up in a satin bag with a draw string.  The belt itself has a plastic rubbery coating on it front and back and edges to make it black.  The surface is satin in nature- not matte and not shiny.  The smell, however, is definitely chemical- plastic type smell.<br /><br />QUALITY<br />The belt looks nice, but the edges when wearing already are showing signs of abrasions on the edges as they hit the belt loops.  I am wondering how long before the inside is showing and we will know if it is indeed a solid piece of leather or a bonded type leather.<br /><br />BUCKLE<br />The buckle is a a nice antiqued pewter type color.  It is a heavy buckle and really designer looking.<br /><br />PACKAGING<br />This packaging is a satin bag with a drawstring, appropriate for gift giving.<br /><br />SIZE?<br />The belt I got was a size 36.<br /><br />IS IT REALLY LEATHER?<br />Only time will tell if this is really solid leather.  I have been burned so many times in the past, that I tend to wait and see.  Hopefully this really is a solid piece of leather and won't crack or fall apart quickly.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a belt that is casual or dressy, fits with a wide variety of clothing styles and can be worn by men or women, depending on the style it is worn with, this is a nice choice.  It seems like leather, but the coating has me concerned with how fast it is going to scrape and wear off.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  I prefer all natural full grain leather belts to be stained and left natural.  This belt is okay, but time will tell how long before it starts to look ragged."
4.0,"Almost Perfect.  I really like this quad watch winder. It is beautiful, large, and turns four watches and holds 12 in storage. It comes with a lock and key so you can secure your watches.  I would give it five stars if the winders had a little more space between the two watches it winds. If you have large watches you have to position them so they do not touch or you might get scratches. The system works well, is quiet and very attractive. I'm impressed because you get a lot of bang for your buck with the ability to wind four watches at a time and store other watches you own."
4.0,It is very cute and easy to wear
4.0,"This coat kept me warm, but didn't give it 5 stars because 1) visually the coat was covered in wrinkles and the faux fur is patchy, 2) it's definitely not water resistant, but in it's defense it dried fairly quickly. It fit well and kept me warm during a trip to Utah."
4.0,"This shirt is pretty well made and the design is adorable.  Fits well.  The fabric is soft, but little thin, like a light t-shirt. A nice, fun shirt for Christmas."
4.0,"A little too short for what I wanted.  Got the same top in different brand that was a little longer.  Nice top, though."
4.0,A good sturdy ring a bit larger than my size I use a small strip of white matter proof duck tape to reduce size better larger than to smaller.
4.0,"Love this blouse !!!<br />The color was a little different than I thought but lovely. The material is a perfect weight for any time of year. It is made well, no uneven or puckered seams or hems AND it FITS<br />When I buy clothes I will wear them for years. You can put this on the list of classics."
4.0,They are nice to have.
4.0,Smaller than I thought but very pretty well.made.
4.0,Inside phone holder too small...small storage space..I love the leather..
4.0,The bracelets were heavy and had a strong weird smell. Not sure I like them much. They look like the picture.
4.0,"Very cute and comfortable,  just wish the chain was a little longer"
4.0,The looked very pretty. They fit fine but I wouldn’t recommend it for wide feet. Other than that very nice.
4.0,"Loved these pants but then put them in the dryer (I know, bonehead move!). Would definitely recommend them to others. They are nice and long and super comfortable and flattering. Would not suggest putting them in the dryer though! Doh! 🙈 I should have known better!"
4.0,Arrived on time as advertised. Quality product...
4.0,"I’m 5’8 around 210. 38D curvy.  Decently slim abdominal area. The XL was to small. Couldn’t get the first button closed. Which is fine, I wanted it to be more open on the breast area. But that 2nd and 3rd button was pulling tight. The hip section was tight too. Returning this for a xxl. I feel the xxl will be a perfect fit.<br /><br />Update: I returned the xl and got the xxl. The bigger size didn’t come with the belt which was upsetting. It was two days before my engagement photos, so too late to return it. I ended up using a belt I had at home. That’s the only reason I gave 4 stars."
4.0,Some are stretchier than others. Other than that. Great buy
4.0,Too big and material is thin
4.0,The watch is beautiful. Love the movement. It's just the right size dial not obnoxious. I would have given 5 stars but it came with no instructions or warranty.  I like to take links outand this one is different.  Looks like you can do it but without any instructionswho knows .
4.0,"Very classy dress great for work, cocktail parties or a more conservative wedding.. only wish the bust and booty area had a bit more space or give; fabric has very little stretch. Size up if real curvy.. I think I might order another in a larger size and tailor if needed"
4.0,Love the delicate lace design but the dangling jewels were glued on crooked!
4.0,Nice looking and keeps time well.
4.0,"This is a pretty, medium crossbody bag. The measurements are true to those listed. It is quite narrow, and not as roomy as I had hoped. My fault for only paying attention to the height and length. The leather is a lovely color, seems like the type that ages well and develops a nice patina. I moved the contents to this bag from a Coach. Side by side you can tell the difference in quality. The coach definately has higher quality zippers and buckles, and a more lux lining. It was also 4 times the cost, so I found the difference to be acceptable. Good quality for the price, and seems like it will last awhile and age beautifully."
4.0,"So I want to start off with the fact that I like the jacket. I bought a small, according to other reviews and the size chart, it seemed as if a small would fit me perfectly, but it fits like a medium. I'm not too particularly happy with that, but it isn't bad enough to go through the trouble of returning it.<br />Overall, good material, though the hood is too small to realistically wear, unless I want to turtle the whole time. No problem with the zipper, as of yet."
4.0,"Cute.  A little brighter than I usually wear, but nice"
4.0,"The style of this top is really cute and flattering. I ordered the yellow, which was darker than the photo and closer to mustard. I got my true size Small, and was able to achieve the off-the-shoulder baggy look. It is a true waffle material, kind of light, but not too thin. Looks well made."
4.0,its good though it ddnt fit me that good
4.0,"Soles felt comfortable. I'm 8.5, but my toes just about rubbed against the front stitching. 9 would have been too loose on my arches"
4.0,"Love the color, shape and size. Not fond of the bling, otherwise its perfect for me. You need to get use to the bifocals . Hopefully it really provides protection from the sun otherwise, Good product!"
4.0,I love the hiding pocket inside the cap.
4.0,"I received the Falster Rose Gold-Tone Steel Mesh Smartwatch a few days ago and have been spending short amounts of time here and there setting it up. The quick start guide is very basic and does the trick: Charge the phone (the charger is included with the watch) and turn it on. Get the app on your smartphone (I have an iPhone) and pair the devices. I followed the directions and easily paired my devices.<br /><br />Once paired, the app takes you through the steps to get the info from your phone to the watch. It took five minutes at the most. I’ve been getting to know the watch little by little and so far I’ve been able to figure out the things I’ve wanted to do.<br /><br />The watch itself is good looking! A pretty shade of rose gold. You can chose the watch face that’s displayed. It’s a smaller face than I expected and it’s lighter than I thought it would be. I do notice that the back of the watch gets warm with use.<br /><br />Overall, I’m please with the function and look of this watch. Now I just have to get used to wearing a wrist watch again."
4.0,The dress arrived a bit wrinkly but overall an OK fit. It does not look as good as the picture but it's fine for summer wear. I would echo others and careful with washing this as it may shrink.
4.0,"prompt shipping, am giving as gift so am not sure how it will hold up, looks cute."
4.0,"I have not ridden in these yet but here are my initial impressions.<br />Pros:<br />The small fits fine (5'1'' and 125 lbs)<br />The gel pad feels like it will be comfortable when riding.<br />The length is good (hits about 4 in above my knee) and the cuffs have grippy rubber to help keep the legs from riding up.<br />The colored panel in the color I selected looks cool.<br />There are reflective patches printed on the left leg and the back of the shorts.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The orange colored panel on the side is see through, as in you can see  the side of my underwear through it.<br />The gel pad is somewhat bulky."
4.0,nice ear protection from noise.
4.0,"Seems to be great quality but too small for me, I’m 4 Petite and I purchase small Size but For me will be a medium size..."
4.0,"I bought this for my trip to Portland OR and found it worked as expected, except it was a little difficult to pull on and off over my head.  And then, I had to decide whether to hold my tote bag inside (protected from rain, but hard to access) or outside for easier access, but exposed to rain.  To solve this problem, I cut an opening in the front so it goes on and off like a regular coat it worked perfectly after that.  Of course, it would be nice if you could also buy a plastic bag to put your tote bag in.<br /><br />Regarding fit, I'm rather short (5' 2&#34;) so it might be a little small for a larger person."
4.0,"These are a great addition to my... eh... fun activities. The one downside is that the plush gets very, very warm against your wrists, definitely to the point of discomfort, and not the enjoyable kind."
4.0,"This (Comfelie) seamless bra is better than I expected. As I said, there are no seams. You can remove the inside padding if you’d like. The fabric (a nylon/spandex blend) is soft, breathable and comfortable. The color is a nice coffee or warm beige. The (wide) straps are adjustable and it even comes with an extra extender. And finally while it is wireless, it does offer some support. You can wear it as an everyday bra or even work out in it."
4.0,"The fit is not tight. The fabric is good flannel but not heavy weight, which is what we wanted.  Washes nice with no shrinkage. My husband likes the pockets and fly."
4.0,Me.agrado su presentación.  Bonita
4.0,Fit perfect just as expected
4.0,Just love pearl very elegant
4.0,Very nice! Much darker than picture
4.0,"very nice to wear , looking good."
4.0,"This dress is 100% cotton. The texture is slightly rough. It’s wrinkly when you get it but comes out of the dryer fine if you pull it out right away. The button closure on the front is real, not sewn shut. There is no lining on the inside, so you have to wear a slip or flesh toned undergarments.<br />It seems well-made, it’s just not for me. It’s a little too frilly. The edges of the frill on the top stand up and stick out quite far for my taste."
4.0,It's arrived yesterday. It's cute bag
4.0,"i ordered this as a halloween costume, and a cosplay outfit - but it came well after i needed it and screwed me over last minute. in terms of quality it is very good material for the price and i would probably buy again."
4.0,Very light weight material and was a little smaller then expected.  You could see my tattoo through the shirt.
4.0,Somewhat small but I knew this before ordering. My daughter will just wear shorts underneath. This is amazing.
4.0,Larger than I thought but these are great and festive
4.0,Delivery was delayed by 2days. Other than that it’s a great snowsuit.
4.0,Softness in material.
4.0,"The gloves are very warm for my child and I love that they are a bit longer than others when rolled out. The only trouble is when my child pulls their hands out, often the lining pulls back with it and it is tricky to get the lining to match back up into the finger slots."
4.0,"Great swim suit, just what I was looking for.  I like my suit to be longer in length and these are perfect.  Great for hanging out on the beach or by the pool.  Nothing flashy, but sporty looking and great fit."
4.0,Velcro adjustment is much better than the old plastic version.
4.0,Fits larger than expected.
4.0,This shirt quality and price are very average and typical of basic novelty t-shirt. The size looks slightly large but still alright. Hoping the recipient will like it.
4.0,Didn't realize they were so big. But good quality for the price.
4.0,Decent set of bracelets
4.0,"Pros ; The quality of the Snapback is great, the price is great as well as how it looks just like the picture.<br />Cons ; I wasn't pleased with its packaging, it was just covered in transparent plastic and that was it.<br />Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase, it wasn't a hoax and I legit received it (even earlier than expected!) . I just hope that they package it in a way where it doesn't squish/flatten the cap."
4.0,COZLANE Gold Tone Shiny Crescent Half Moon Pendant Necklace nice jewelry to Wear as one piece or with many pieces of jewelry for every day look or can dress it up .
4.0,The product it self was cool doesn't look like the picture (I get what I pay for) it's tight around my chest/neck area. If I move the wrong way while moving I choke my self. But over all people(and kids) love seeing me in it
4.0,Mi Esposito esta encantado.
4.0,"Despite being frameless, these glasses are built solid.  They seem to be nearly as heavy as some framed glasses.  If you want super light frames, look elsewhere.  If you want a solid build and great looks, then these frames should be on your short list."
4.0,These wash nicely and the netting on the inside isn't &#34;too tight&#34; (a common complaint with other suits). My son is in the 50th percentile for height and weight for a 9 year old and these fit great.
4.0,A womens large fits like a mans large. Definitely size down.
4.0,Would like to say they worked with me on the return. Thank you to the company for the help with this.
4.0,This is a nice shirt. Fits well and has quality material. I've bought too many items that have cheap material. This is a nice thick blend. Very satisfied
4.0,I love the look of the ring and it seems to be good quality. I bought the ring for a gift and not sure if I should have now....my friend who is Muslim told me that he wouldn't be able to wear it because he can't bring it to the bathroom and might forget to take it off first. I didn't know that and I have to admit that I'm wondering if he is just being a little bit fanatical? Can't somebody just wear it on the cord like a necklace and put it on the inside of the shirt? According to him you can't.??? Not sure but it is a nice ring otherwise.
4.0,"...that does have the mark of actual diamond as opposed to CZ.<br /><br />I got this as a Valentine gift for my sweetie as a nice everyday sort of jewelry that wouldn't break the bank. Yes, I wish I had the budget to do better, but she's happy so I'm happy.<br /><br />Overall, it's a decent purchase... but don't let it fool you, the clarity, color, and size are all at the bottom end in terms of quality."
4.0,"Love it!!!! The material is light, which results in the shirt being slightly see through. I got the pink colour and it's adorable!"
4.0,This is worth the price. It also stays relatively in place. Very light and fun for Halloween.
4.0,"Good hoodie that my son likes.  I gave 4 stars because I'm not a Michigan fan.  If it was a Wisconsin badgers hoodie, I'd say it's a really nice hoodie and I'd buy it again."
4.0,"Good fit, lovely soft leather.  I guess I won;t be able to bear to get them dirty!"
4.0,Hey are very cute but I returned them because you could see my underwear through them.
4.0,"After loosing my apple watch 4 two times kitesurfing in the ocean (and then found snorkeling for it), I recalized I needed a more secure watch band. First time i lost it was with the stock band, 2nd time was with one of those cheaper velcro bands I bought on amazon. I saw this one, and figured it should work better with it's heavy duty build. I've only had it a couple weeks, but it's pretty stiff right out the gate, so I'm hoping it ""breaks in"" and gets a little more formed. It seems like it likes to catch on stuff, like when putting on a jacket or something. The end of the velcro band and where it folds sort of stick out, so be warned it's not as fluid as the cheaper bands. I will say, it uses actual velcro so it seems like a secure hold, but haven't had a chance to really test it in the water but I'm confident it will hold better than my last band. Will update this review if I have any issues down the road. Overall, it's a nice band, and looks pretty cool."
4.0,Very light weight but runs a bit small in the arm area. I wear a size 16-18 US typically and ordered a 2XL in this jacket.
4.0,nice color and fabrics...
4.0,"A little thin, a little itchy, a little shorter than expected but I enjoy it enough to keep it. I was hoping to wear it with leggings but not long enough."
4.0,I like them they're comfortable. They are also very soft.
4.0,My seven year old granddaughter loved them. She put them right on. Her little ears turned bright red. I said oh no....don't wear those if they hurt you're ears. She smiled at me and said no grandma they don't hurt at all. She was so excited over the dangling earrings. She has only had sticker earrings on her ears. They were worth the money I paid just to see her little smile.
4.0,Smaller than I thought but perfect for Medusa costume
4.0,Great but looks cheap
4.0,Four stars only because I returned the watch because it was bigger than I expected- Can't say how it would have held up long-term. It was in lovely packaging from the seller and very easy to set up. The &#34;open heart&#34; feature is mesmerizing and the watch is silent as far as I could tell.  Came with Orient packaging and tags and paperwork. Would be great for someone who wants an automatic watch with some &#34;bling.&#34;
4.0,"Very pretty, unique!  More partial to the silver color.  They are delicate, but I really like them.  Glad I ordered!"
4.0,"This cardi is light and drapy. It does not cover my butt, but it is soft and pairs nicely with summer tanks. Easily dresses up or down. So far it seems to be good quality."
4.0,"The material is thin, not a heavy duty sweater but I love the design.  It's cute to wear off the arm as it's large enough to wear it like that."
4.0,"I've only ridden with these one time in 32 degree weather and they were warm enough. I believe much of the warmth you will feel will depend on the outer gloves. I bought some heavier mesh gloves instead of leather because I need a less bulky feel due to my hands are small and it's very difficult, and after a while, painful,  to operate the levers. I had a pair of Harley heated gloves and ran into this problem. So my combination works well for gripping but it's not toasty warm. But the trade off works. Another feature that I liked when I saw these were the plugs and their location. My Harley gloves have wires running from the inside so that when you plug them to the jacket there's no place to run the excess wire except inside the glove which is very uncomfortable. I looked at two of these liners and picked these because the plugs are on the top side so no wires under my hand or wrist. These are a little large for me and they are the smalls. I'm petite though. They fit well inside an outer glove but the gloves I bought are a size larger than I usually wear. So they may not fit well under a glove that fits you well without them. Over all this is a good solution for me and a bit cheaper than Harley or Gerbing. Can't testify to how well they will hold up with frequent use."
4.0,"Love this dress! Very cute. It has an oversized feel, but I would say it is pretty true to size. The v is pretty deep, I pinned mine because it kept sliding around and showing my bra. Overall, I was impressed with the quality for the price!"
4.0,"They are smaller than I expected, but I like them"
4.0,This item comes sized to order. If your buying for a little comfort don't order the next size up.
4.0,"Comes with spring bars. Solid leather. Smells good, like leather is supposed to. Got it wet and it didn't get all messed up or stretch. Comes in a sealed plastic bag/pouch which was a little scary but the product was fine."
4.0,nice shirt fits well
4.0,Very nice. I like the pants a lot. Need them for a funeral and I was worried they might be to flashy. But very nice fit. Very clean look. I ordered a extra L. And if u don’t want to much on ur butt then order up a size
4.0,Perfect for what they are
4.0,I had to have my first one replaced after it ripped after two days of using it. Hoping the second one lasts a bit longer. Good customer service.
4.0,These might be a bit too skinny especially at the ankles - not very flattering unless you happen to be REALLY and truly super skinny...not merely athletic. These don't fit the calves and are uncomfortable. Good for very thin builds only. Well made.
4.0,"The shirt is very well made, quality fabric that is light and airy. The color is absolutely beautiful, but the shirt rings very large. Amazon recommended I order a XXL but some of the reviews said it ran big, and based on my measurements, I decided to go with a large. This was still on the overly large side.  I'm 5'7, 155lbs, 40 E. The top is meant to have a loose, airy vibe, but I would order the medium in the future. Which I may do in another color."
4.0,For those needing sizing help: I bought a large for our Rottweiler who is around 80-85 lbs (so she's pretty small for a Rottie).  It does fit but I would say it's a tad snug.  Luckily the velcro that goes around her belly is stretchy!  As for being reflective - it does work & I feel better about her chances of being noticed during our dark fall/winter early morning walks.  Great value for the 2 items (I haven't worn mine yet though) & manufacturer/seller is proactive & interested in satisfying customers.
4.0,Nice shirt.  Nothing special
4.0,Super cute and comfortable bracelet. The only thing I don't like is the fact that the scent of the oil doesn't last long.
4.0,"Brought for my husband, he loves the jacket run small order one size up than your normal size. No interior pockets. Great to wear with jeans."
4.0,"Husband likes these. Light weight and comfortable. We ordered the 8 pack. I would have given it 5 stars but  it appears that they just pick random skull designs and not the ones shown. It also needs a hem at the top  to help them stay up, on people with small heads."
4.0,Good quality but ran a little big and did not look good on so had to make a return .
4.0,They may feel a little snug at first but loosen up as you wear them. Nice wedge and quality you expect from Nine West.
4.0,"Going to go well with my Chell cosplay. Though, it's more of a hot turqouise colour than the light blue as pictured."
4.0,"It looks exactly like the chain in the picture. It's relatively sturdier than other body chains of the same price.<br />I don't know why it's called a &#34;snake cross&#34;, it simply meets in the middle with a small hoop."
4.0,A bit see through but perfect for over a bathing suit! I like a slightly looser fit so I sized up to be safe.
4.0,The dress is EXACTLY as picture.  The sleeve opening is a bit large as some of the previous reviews stated (I am 5'1&#34; 114lbs).  There is a strong chemical odor when you get it.  I have washed it once but will probably need to wash again prior to wearing because the smell is so strong.  The overall construction of this dress is good and definitely worth the price.
4.0,"I am a 38 B and ordered the XXL and it's actually pretty snug, but it is of course Juniors, and I am middle-aged woman.<br /> The heathered blue one was a bit loose-the Navy was pretty snug (same size), but I just like the color better.  It's a very cute print and good quality-a tad on the thinner side."
4.0,Nice for this price.
4.0,"I was tired of my size fluctuating during this pregnancy so I bought these to replace regular bras. They have worked great so far! There's enough padding that they can be worn under just about everything, however, there's no lift or pushup so still have to wear regular bras under nicer blouses. I will turn them into nursing bras when baby comes in June and I think they'll work perfectly for that as well.<br /><br />These will also be great for wearing under summer clothing like low cut, flowy dresses etc. where you wouldn't want a regular bra with clasps hanging out the back.<br /><br />Even with my growing &#34;size&#34; I wouldn't mind these fitting a bit more snugly. But the adjustable straps make them very comfortable."
4.0,Cute alternative to that crazy elf on the shelf!
4.0,Fit the wife good. Just received random colors. Not the ones shown
4.0,These work great. But they are hard to clean and get dirty quickly.
4.0,I like it. I usually buy size eleven for my pinky ring but this time it's to large for it. So I put it on my 4th finger. It looks good. Now I'm waiting to see if it will last.
4.0,Travels well and keeps its shape.
4.0,"The pictures make it seem like this dress is not fitting around the stomach area, but it is. I really like how it fits at the top, but it definitely shows my mom pooch from my 2 kids. If I stick my hands in my pockets, I can pull it away from my body to make it less noticeable. It's not skin tight, but it's tight enough there to make me self conscience. I really like it otherwise. I ordered a Large, which is my normal size. I might try an extra large, but I would be worried it wouldn't fit as well at the top."
4.0,It is a good quality swimsuit it was just too small for me. I got an extra large I'm 5-10 205 lb I'm really curvy on the bottom but very average up top 36C.
4.0,"The quality isn’t the best. I kinda figured that since the price point was lower than most. The “paint” comes of pretty easily. The material seems to separate easily too. Not enough to effect the wearability. Basically, you get what you pay for."
4.0,"The stone was surprisingly large, but I got a number of compliments on it yesterday when I wore it for the first time."
4.0,"Have had this watch for about a week. Shipping was speedy and the price is definitely a plus.<br /><br />Good:<br />-Color scheme is perfect, especially for darker colored clothing. I wear this with dark-shaded flannels and dark jeans and it looks awesome. The hands & numbers are easy to see but not overwhelming.<br />-Very easy to change the time: just pull out the knob and turn appropriately, then lock it back.<br />-Shipped with a cleaning cloth<br /><br />Downsides:<br />-The watch arrived with a very, very small white blemish on the face. Without pointing it out, one would never notice it, especially not someone else looking at it while you're wearing it. I considered sending it back for this reason but it's very minor and I usually don't notice it.<br />-The watch did not come with any instructions or user manual, so I still haven't figured out how to adjust the date, although it was set on the correct date already upon arrival.<br /><br />In conclusion, I really like this watch and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good, all-around watch to wear casually. Match it with dark clothes and dark brown Chukka boots and BAM! You've got a killer outfit. For $18, I can certainly overlook the small blemish (I think that's just a matter of chance, anyway) and a lack of an owner's manual. The face is a little bigger than I expected but that's not the fault of the seller (and I've come to like the size more as I've worn it).<br /><br />Will update this review after a few months of wear and use."
4.0,"High quality but just a little large for me.<br />I have larger wrists to begin with so the average guy may find this bracelet quite loose.<br />Other than the size, it's very durable and look pretty fancy."
4.0,"The material of the dress feels like a great quality and is the perfect thickness. I ordered a size small and it fit perfectly with a good amount of stretch if needed. (I am generally a 34B and size 4/6) The ties around the arm were a little strange. It arrived untied and upon tying it myself the pieces poked out sideways and wasn’t as flattering as most cold shoulder pieces. The pockets are a little lower than my liking, falling about mid-thigh and the overall length was a little long for me. I am only 5’2 so this is a common occurrence but wanted fellow short girls to know!<br />Overall, a cute dress and good quality fabric, but a slightly longer length.<br />**If you found this review helpful please mark as helpful!!"
4.0,Great for kids.  Keeps the glasses in place.
4.0,Had to give them a few days but they grew on me. Actually really nice after all.
4.0,"Good for the price. I'm a busty gal, so the top was perfect for me but the bottoms were a bit big and, while cute, did kind of sag especially when wet. I'd be happier if they allowed the customer to pick the size for each piece of the bikini separately."
4.0,"No, not for hire"
4.0,I ordered this for my six year old granddaughters' b-day. I ordered the shortest chain they offered (14 in) which was fine but the pendant was bigger than expected. Other than that it was really cute for the price. She loved it.
4.0,So it's not the dress I expected from the image but I still like it. The sleeves are bit shorter and the material is soft. It hangs flat even with an underskirt. I'll actually order more of them as they are good for wearing to work on a daily basis.
4.0,These are decentnat for this price.
4.0,"RODEWILL Womens Color Block Plaid Corduroy Jacket Button Down Shirt Long Sleeve Oversized Blouses Tops<br /><br />I'm torn on this one! There are things I like about it... It's quite heavy so it's more jacket-like than shirt. It's good for layering to help stay warm. I like the colors and the fabric looks soft. As long as I'm wearing this with a long-sleeve shirt underneath and no part of it touching my skin, it's OK. Otherwise it's super itchy and I can't wait to take it off. It's just not comfortable. I don't care for the big silver buttons either, I don't like the look. I prefer to wear this open with a cute shirt underneath. If it's buttoned up it isn't very flattering and looks pretty masculine. It washes and dries nicely with no wrinkling or pilling. If it wasn't so itchy I would like it a lot better."
4.0,"The black cording is a little annoying, but I don't know how else you'd tie this bracelet together. And overall it's still cute. Maybe later I'll cut the cords shorter and think of a different clasp to use, but for now it is fine. This looked nice with a mint shirt I have.  I'd recommend it."
4.0,"I got an XL so was fully aware that the title ""skinny"" wouldn't really be accurate for me, and there was no possibility I would look like the model in the photos. I was, therefore, very pleased at how well this dress fits and looks. Sure, doesn't make me look skinny, but it does fit well and look good on my shape.<br /><br />The fabric is stretchy, which helps with adapting to the various individual attributes of my shape. It's snug but not tight; comfortable. If you can stand to wear smoothing, shaping undergarments (I generally can't) I think this would look quite nice on anyone's shape or size. For myself, I'll wear it with a light over-garment -- a light jacket or wrap.<br /><br />Good looking fabric, dressy enough without being so fussy you can't just toss it in the washer. Easy fit. By this I mean, the photo makes it look like it might be hard to walk as the bottom looks snug over the legs, but that's not the case. Easy, comfortable fit for walking and sitting.<br /><br />My one small negative is that, for me, the zipper required the husband to zip it up for me. I could not reach to zip it up the back by myself."
4.0,Great product and great fit!
4.0,I got these for necklaces I was creating for a bridal party.  I love how it turned out.  It is truly and exquisite display of sentiment.<br />It was easy to construct and looks beautiful.<br /><br />The printing was a little difficult to manage.  I did end up scaling and printing on my own and not using the direction.<br /><br />Looking to use these again on future projects.
4.0,Very cute bracelet! Got it as a gift for one of my daughter's friends.
4.0,I had ordered a black dress in this style and loved it. The navy blue is much shorter which I find disappointing.
4.0,My wife liked it. Finding full sleeve bodysuit is hard to find in local stores. It runs just a tad big and she didn't love the neckline but she still liked it and wears it!
4.0,"The beads are plastic, so are light weight. Will not weigh down the scarf or fall to the ends of it. Good for making your own decorative scarves."
4.0,They came on time and I like the quality of them
4.0,Excellent fit...
4.0,"Very good quality knitted item. I like that it can be worn in different ways to add flair to an otherwise plain shirt or dress. It is made like an oblong shawl, but it has long cuffs to be worn around the wrists to keep it all in place. No slipping off the shoulders like many shawls will do. My only (slightly) negative comment would be that I would like it to be a bit longer since I am larger than the model in the picture. Perhaps the supplier should make these wonderful, cuffed wraps in differing lengths to accommodate different sized bodies."
4.0,The material is skin-friendly and comfortable.
4.0,I kept it even though has little hestitation closing the sip
4.0,Very Nice hat! Good quality wool and very sharp looking. Be sure to leave the tags on until you know it fits otherwise you cannot return it. I bought one that was too big but I was assuming they ran small which actually they run very close to your real size so I ordered a new one and can't wait to get it! High quality and very cool looking hat!
4.0,"Super cute skirt, looks just like the photo. Material is thin, but not insubstantial. It’s just too short on me. With my arms at my sides it barely passed my fingertips. Definitely could not have sat down or moved easily, so it went back."
4.0,These are fun socks. Low rise. All synthetic. Don’t know why these are particularly for biking. They slip a bit inside your shoes. The elastic quality is good.
4.0,"I love the shirt and get compliments each time I wear it, however it runs LARGE. The material feels like a silky nightgown but it's a shirt. I feel like I'm wearing my pj's to work!"
4.0,It's fun for caffeine lovers
4.0,I love the sweet necklace.  It was a  birthday present for y daughter and she loves it. Thank you so much.
4.0,Cute wig
4.0,"Skirt is way way to big for me. Sad, I'll have to complete reswe it."
4.0,Bit too small. Ordered a large and it fit more like a very snug medium. Beautiful quality and fast shipping. Just a bit small.
4.0,Much shorter than indicated in photo. I am a tall woman but the photo looks like it fits knee to groin on a man. Must be a short man. I will still keep and use them.
4.0,"I've always liked butterflies and dragonflies, and these charms come in a variety of colors and are super cute! I have a charm bracelet now that's all butterflies, and I adore it. The butterflies themselves seem very sturdy, and so far I haven't seen any wear or tear on any of them. The colors are as bright as in the pictures, and they look really good and really adorable on necklaces too! To me, the price seemed a tad steep, which is why I detracted a star, but otherwise, I'd still say they're totally worth it, especially if you like butterflies as much as I do."
4.0,"My grandson loves them, but they ran big."
4.0,They was okay!
4.0,"Material seems a little thin, but it is warm. I'm used to much thicker wool hats, but this one seems like it should be fairly warm. Fit is ok as well where it covers most of your ears."
4.0,"I wanted to find a way to contact the seller, but I can't seem to find it. I want to order another one because I'm happy with the piece, but I want to see if I can request additional o-rings, because I already lost one O ring and now I've lost my jewellery after a few weeks. XD"
4.0,"It is really nice, but I wear XL and this XL looks like a medium. Didn't bother to return so I gave a friend."
4.0,This is hilarious. Scarfs like this don't protect as well as masks but I just had to have it. I wear my masks more but when I do wear this people always think it's hilarious!
4.0,"I bought these in camouflage, and I do love them.  I wash them in the washer and hang them dry, and they dry very quickly.  Even without using the dryer, they started pilling after the first wash.  It's not egregious, but iI didn't expect that with this type of fabric, and certainly not after one wash. Having said that, they serve their purpose enough that after a few weeks, I just bought a second set in black.  I would've given these 4.5 stars but that wasn't an option.  For $30 for a set, I can live with the pilling because they definitely keep me warm and are thin enough that my clothes fit fine over them and are not tight with the extra layer."
4.0,Very satisfied with the quality of this hat.  Expect to have it for many years.  Not flimsy.  Would recommend it.
4.0,I give this bracelet a 4 star instead of a 5 only because it has no RED stones in it which would have made it match the beautiful ring I purchased from this company recently.
4.0,"Ordered a larger one too because this does run small, but as a seamstress, I'll use the smaller one in another way."
4.0,I got a good deal on these so i purchased them. Great fit! I really like the way the material feels. For reference I'm 5'9 160lbs 38 DD chest and I ordered a large. The irony of this is that I don't usually ever wear pjs to bed lol (I like to be free if you know what I mean). I liked this set so much i wore it to bed the first night I got it. I give 4 stars because the image of the blue set gives the impression it has a gold trim. My blue set has a white trim. Overall I'm pleased.
4.0,IT WAS ALL I EXPECTED AND MORE.
4.0,Very cute sneakers but couldnt tell from the pictures that were no shoe strings to tie. You have to stretch them to put on and take off.
4.0,I really like it but its slightly small its adjusted to the biggest it goes which is not the big. I don't consider myself as having a large head. Wish you could adjust it bigger!
4.0,I really like them! They fit well for my big face :) They aren't polarized
4.0,"This dress is great quality for the price. However, some stitching is messy and there are loose threads. If you’re looking for a really high quality dress then I wouldn’t recommend this. Nonetheless, it’s a great dress considering the price."
4.0,"I am 5'3"" and I like empire waist dresses. This dress is good because the empire waist is at the braline, not at my belly button. I wish the material was thicker, because a white bra will show through."
4.0,"Belt is exactly as pictured and arrived promptly. This belt does run rather large, so I can't use it as a waist belt as intended but will keep it to wear loosely around the hips. For reference I have a 27 inch waist."
4.0,"I love this bracelet really cute the weight is good I’ve worn it to was fishes, in the shower has not faded or tarnished. Good for an everyday bracelet to wear. The reason I gave them 4 ploughing 5 is because I would have like the heart pendant to be larger over all really cute."
4.0,"I bought this hat to try and match a scarf I have. I am slightly disappointed in the color because its a little more brown then the picture makes it look. It appears as if its going to mainly be a burgundy but in person there is definitely more of a brown hue. However, I love the fit and its good quality and still matched my scarf fairly closely. Especially since my scarf is multi color, so it worked out. I just wish it would have been a bit lighter or more red."
4.0,I got it on clearance through the warehouse. It was a bargain and nice to have one handy when you need it. I would order it again.
4.0,Bought these more or less to complete my Big Lebowski &#34;Dude&#34; look/costume.. The actual tint is pretty dang dark and really only works in bright sunlight.. But they're the cheapest ones I've found that are really close to replicating the Dude's sunglasses.
4.0,It fits nicely in at the bottom and abdominal area but I found the top/straps was larger a fit for more bust (more then I have: B cup)<br />So I find I'm constantly pulling the back strap down in the back to make it so my boobs aren't hanging out.<br />But overall the tank itself is very comfy though.
4.0,"I will definitely wear these socks out, however they are a bit different than I expected sheerness wise so they look and very much like tights when put on. But the reason I only gave four stars is because one of the socks in my pack seemed to be smaller than the others and didn’t quite feel comfortable. Overall, a great fit for their price and very easy to put on and would be perfect for an easy day out if Having to roll them back up every once in awhile."
4.0,This was exactly what appeared on ad and fit nicely. My daughter has worn it several times. It was a little stiff the first time she wore it but each time after it softens up. Would buy from here again
4.0,The dress is very beautiful the only thing I did not like about this dress is the rope tie around it but I never use it apart from that the dress is beautiful
4.0,yea it's cute
4.0,Purchased one of these for my boyfriend for Christmas and the first one came damaged with a hole in it although I ordered a second one and the second one came fine now he wears it a lot. It’s a great jacket and it’s super nice
4.0,"Super cute, wore this set for my whole honeymoon!"
4.0,Keep my tootsies much warmer.
4.0,The band look is very good. Also very comfortable in the wrist.
4.0,"I absolutely love it. Perfect for summer time. It's light and not heavy at all. It is a bit see through up top, so make sure you wear a solid color bra or cover up a bit. Love it!"
4.0,"very nice necklacd,  worth the money.nice for a gift, or for your sf.. it is well worth the money..i wkuld bjy them avain.. i already bought three.. love them..get one before they run kht..tha ms cg thja schmidt"
4.0,"These are so pretty, but unfortunately the flare was so big I couldn't get them in my ear without going up another size."
4.0,my husband wears it alot
4.0,"Had a really hard time getting my first taper size in, did a little research and found out that it's common for people who didn't wear earrings regularly to have trouble getting started. I wore these for like a week and the tapers slid in easily after."
4.0,I ordered these to help me get through the cold Wisconsin winter. They are good for layering underneath wind pants or sweat pants for going outside. They're super soft and have a nice high waist. The only con I noticed was that they were see through a bit when I bent over. I mostly wear around the house or as a base layer though so it doesn't bother me.
4.0,Ok so this is the 3rd ZAFUL bathing I tried. Luckily the top was great (because you can tie it yourself). The print is super cute! The bottoms are a little large but I sewed the butt to make it a scrunched butt so now they fit a tiny bit better (at least enough for me to keep this bathing suit). The bottoms are reversible but I probably will only use the solid colored side. Kept 1 out of 3 ZAFUL bathing suits I ordered...at least they offered free returns!
4.0,"In the size small, they're still too long for my liking (I feel the same about the one that comes with your flex 2 at purchase).  But they're well-made and this pack was great for the price for some color options.  Seller is very responsive, though."
4.0,"Tie was for my husband to wear to our son’s wedding to coordinate with my gown. It’s a very nice deep green, great for a classic winter look"
4.0,This isn't as think as I thought it would be.
4.0,This is my first time ordering clothing from amazon but I'm so happy with this purchase. The color is a gorgeous chocolate color and the material is thick and stretchy. I will be ordering it in some other colors.
4.0,"We will be Waldo and Wanda. This package comes with glasses that have clear lenses. They are fairly small and are tight on my husbands head, but will work to get the point across.  The beanie is of good quality, it is just that there are four seams in the head part - two of them are sewn from the tassel to the red band. The other two are only sewn part way down the white cap. This leaves you with two pointy cat like ""ears"". Easily resolved - I just sewed the seams on down to the red band and they looks perfect now. We bought the shirts separately because reviews from the complete package deal did not sound good for the shirts. Glad we did. We got great shirts too this way."
4.0,"Great fit, unfortunately It has a little hole in one od the sleeves."
4.0,love this cute little top but its seeing through
4.0,This lovely watch strap has a nice pliable feel to it.  Nicely made and stitched and the colour is accurate to the picture on Amazon.
4.0,"It was comfortable and I got nervous because I was worried it wasn’t going to fit, it did and I’m happy."
4.0,"I absolutely LOVE this romper!  It fits great!  I’m 5’3” - 144 lbs and a medium fits perfect, just slightly too long."
4.0,It was bit big on me because I ordered a size up. My normal size is xl and I ordered xxl. Would take it to my seamstress to take it in.  Material is good and looks like the pic.
4.0,"It Is such a beautiful blouse, but it runs big to me"
4.0,Now I can hold my son's ashes close to my heart where he will always be.
4.0,Wow weee! Runs way too big!
4.0,Exactly what you would think you get for the price.
4.0,Turned finger green but was dainty and pretty for a while
4.0,A little on the short side. Needs to be longer but is very comfortable and looks great!
4.0,Feels good on my feet
4.0,"I like this shirt a lot but it runs small.  Need to lose a couple more pounds before I can wear it. Seems as if Lucky brand isn't consistent with it's sizing.  Some shirts I wear a Large, others a medium.  Seems as if I can't trust buying online because I never know what size to buy."
4.0,They fit and are fun... a little on thin side
4.0,"love the belts.  love the ability to adjust sizing easily.  Only thing i'd change is the extra loop falls off if you don't buckle the belt while not wearing. overall though, great product."
4.0,Cant fit iphone 6 in unner pouch. An extra 3 mm of zipper pouch and it would fit.
4.0,"Looks super, but I’m swimming in it, and I’m built. I wear a M 95% of the time. But, if I were to repurchase this, it’d be S or even XS"
4.0,Fit as expected and love it. Have received many compliments on it.
4.0,It's lightweight and non cumbersome to wear. It keeps time well. My husband likes to wear it when he is playing golf actually. For the price I'd say this watch is spot on!
4.0,"Perfect gift, excellent quality"
4.0,Its really cute but when washed it fades slightly.  Started to wash on cold and air dried it to preserve the color and for the tags to remain on.
4.0,Nice feel and fit. Color description was incorrect when I ordered so I received the wrong colors  but I think it’s been fixed by now.
4.0,I purchased this bag in the gold color. It is good quality especially for the price. I just wish the strap was a little longer. It doesn't quite fit the way a crossbody bag should fit but I still like it.
4.0,"I am on day 7 of my Chia food journey, So far so good I feel great and my gut health is on track .Omega 3 ,protein and so many more benefits to chia seeds."
4.0,arrived on time. as described.
4.0,"Very cute light weight masks. My daughter loved them and thought they were comfortable. However after a few washes and about 2 months of wear, they started splitting along the seams."
4.0,"Not very thick, but looks nice."
4.0,"These are very nice sunglasses . Item just as described. Beautiful and great quality. This was my first Tory burch purchase and was happy with look and it came with case and bag . Unfortunately , they just weren't for me. Had to return."
4.0,"very cute! the waist is a bit tight but I'm assuming that is part of the style. It does have like a puffy hip region, but other than that I love it!"
4.0,was able to pass along to someone smaller.  great price
4.0,"Very nice beautiful ring. The ring arrived without flaws,seems sturdy and is very comfortable. Can the diamond pass as a real diamond? Depends on the lighting. Some lights it matches the appearance of my real diamond,some lights it's obvious it's not real. I still wear it because it is a beautiful ring!"
4.0,"Material and fit were great! It's super soft. Only thing I would change is the picket placement. It falls right on my hips and makes my hips look a little wider than normal. I just cut the pockets out and stitched them closed and it fixed the problem. Overall, it's a great dress."
4.0,Cute as heck but don't believe the &#34;it fits small&#34; reviews they were huge! Order true to your size
4.0,"Cute, stylish, cheap way to wear your flex2! I never feel like the thing is going to open unexpectedly (I actually lost my old flex2 using the band it came with; this bracelet is much more secure). It looks good on its own or with other bracelets and can be worn casually or more dressed up. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it has gotten pretty worn and the metal a bit discolored and I've only had it for a month."
4.0,these run smaller than all the other adidas 10.5 that I have.
4.0,"For the price it's fine. I wouldn't really wear it out of the house though, because it's very thin and not very good quality. That said, I wear it a lot at home under leggings. It is very comfortable and feels a little more put together than a sweater or Tshirt"
4.0,"This shirt is super cute, but definitely smaller than expected. I bought Medium size anticipating shrinkage. It is smaller than similar Volcom tee's and this one being 100% cotton means it's a letdown for me. For some reason this one was made smaller than all my other Volcom tee's."
4.0,"Too large for my face.  Sending back.  Also, the case was damaged."
4.0,Loved the dress. I wore it to see Maxwell!!  Wish I would have ordered a medium instead of the large. It runs true to size
4.0,Well made but maybe I need a size smaller.  I like them overall.  Very comfortable.
4.0,"the flowers are very big so they will cover up and doubels or third peircing you may have in your lobes, but they are very cute and simple. They will be great for a nice spring or summer day!"
4.0,"Beautiful ring, looks great on my hand but it's not really adjustable"
4.0,It was large however I like the style.
4.0,"I’ve received so many compliments after I purchased the shades, and they keep coming in. Aside from the comments that I have received on the shades driving towards the the sun in every day activity, they’ve proved great......"
4.0,They are very durable. Only disappointed about the size seem smaller than I thought.
4.0,"The Pocket Square Holder itself is very nice. It clamps securely on the pocket square and keeps it in place. The pocket squares that come with it are not great quality, but are serviceable (and I imagine anyone buying this is not buying for the pocket squares).<br /><br />It took some trial and error (the holder sits lower in my jacket pocket, so the pocket square has to be adjusted so that when the holder is at the bottom of the pocket, the appropriate amount of the pocket square is showing), but once I figured out the height of the pocket square, it held securely the entire time."
4.0,"Very comfortable, colors more vibrant than they appear!"
4.0,The quality of it
4.0,"Material is buttery soft, ordered the large, and it is very large which is exactly what I wanted! Plenty of pockets for all my cards, just filled it up and it's already bulging, but I love it :) great buy, I'm happy so far!<br /><br />*around 2 weeks after purchase, coin zipper handle broke off in the closed position, so it it broke off with my coins trapped inside :/"
4.0,"Bought three of these shirts in different colors. My minor quality issue is that the sleeve ends are different lengths on each shirt, not consistent when they look like the same material used on each sleeve's ends. These shirts seem to run a bit larger to about the correct size. Overall they are good for the price. Have not had them long enough to see if they last under working conditions yet."
4.0,Looks like my grandmother made it.  I love it.
4.0,"I bought these to use driving at night.  They seem a little dark when driving. I can see, but still not sure if I can see well enough at night. I want to know if a deer or other animal is out there, i will see it.  They do help with oncoming headlights.  I do like the glasses, and they will be nice to wear during the sunny daylight hours."
4.0,Fit perfectly in the galsses. Polarize is a little weak but for the price and to be able to see through my glasses again it was worth it.
4.0,"Very nice piece for field use.  The only reason I dont give it a 5 is the sharp edges on the case.  If you are like me, I lose stuff.  At this price I can afford to purchase several to keep on hand.  To put on a lanyard you will need a small spilt ring because the lanyard hole is very small.<br /><br />Also note they are kid tuff too!  My [...] has not been able to destroy mine yet despite near daily use for the past few weeks!<br /><br />Gary"
4.0,"I think these are great quality at not too expensive of a price, and actually waterproof! I bought them for my 12 year old who hates tying his shoes and loves to play in muddy areas. He is great at ruining shoes but these are holding up very well so far."
4.0,"Series 3, 38mm: I took a chance on this as there were no reviews yet, but I’ve worn it for a few days and so far, I really like it. The connection at the watch face is just a little bit loose (which seems to be a problem with many of these), but it feels pretty secure in its little slot. The nylon loops give it some cushion and I’ve noticed I don’t have to readjust it constantly like I do with the silicone band. While the watch itself still occasionally tries to adhere to my skin, the band is pretty breathable. My only complaints at the moment are that the buckle sometimes presses into my skin where it hinges with the band, and the color choices are somewhat limited and a little weird…the gold definitely doesn’t go with my watch, but since I keep a cover on it, nobody but me can see the silver. No comments yet on quality but if it fails catastrophically, I’ll come back and knock some stars off this review…<br /><br />Update: after a couple weeks of wear, I still like how it feels, but that slightly loose connection has developed a bit of a click. It’s not a huge deal, but the noise/sensation is very similar to the watch’s alert buzz, so I keep checking my watch for false alerts…knocked off a star for the annoyance factor. That said, I still like it enough to order a second band, and the watch still feels secure, which is the important thing."
4.0,"This is a very nice leotard, but it says size 12/14.  It fits like a 12 not a 14 at all.  It was a little snug for my granddaughter who wears a 12.  I thought it would have a little room since it said 12/14.  Happy with it otherwise."
4.0,"Very cute and comfortable for sleeping. Lightweight and breathable without sacrificing quality. Runs slightly larger than expected, I probably could have gone a size down."
4.0,"I like buying items from small Made in USA companies and do so whenever I can. I received great service from the company, TREELANCE, but the tank top was too tight for me.  Normally I wear a medium.  I ordered a large which did not work.  The top was made very well, however, for my needs, the fabric could have been a bit smoother, softer.  This was another reason for the return."
4.0,"Very pretty, For Brazilian customers, an important warning: Import taxes were of 250% !!!!!"
4.0,"very comfortable, best replacement band i can find so far for my basis peak fitness tracker"
4.0,"I thought it would fit longer in the torso but looks good, it might look better with small boobs if you're going for the athletic look. Thick material so it breathes like cotton."
4.0,"This is a really cute costume, I ordered a medium (for reference: I’m 5’2 and 130ish lbs) the top fit very well (it’s cropped and partially see through so be careful of that) but the bottoms are extremely tight and uncomfy. I really wish that it would have fit properly because I really like it! I would suggest ordering a size up if you are unsure!!!!"
4.0,I have ordered 4 pieces from this company and love them !! Will be ordering  more when they get some summer  stuff in
4.0,"Love the fabric!  Construction appears to be high quality.  .I was expecting a 4&#34; gusset, but this comes with a knife edge.  However, the neck opening is large enough to accommodate several hangers.  It's long enough for my maxi tops and very light weight.  It will be perfect for my train trip because there is limited luggage space in my roomette.  Fantastic value!"
4.0,I love the coat but the zipper is hard to zip
4.0,"I do like the design quality, I am using it for more than a month and it feels comfortable<br />I really like the high hill and you feel like walking shoes<br />overall, I think worth the price"
4.0,"So cute. Fit well. However, where the front bows are glued on- they were glued with a glue that is yellow or turned yellow. And it was visible."
4.0,A little too big and don't quite hold as well on the face. But really nicely made with good quality and quite pretty.
4.0,High quality and a low price!
4.0,Cute for vacation. Loose fitting but expected. Material just ok
4.0,Very pretty and exactly what it is in the picture. it's just really cheap feeling! I would not order something like this again!
4.0,They work good.. but you can see your eyes from the outside unlike the orignals
4.0,It's a nice wallet
4.0,This dress is exactly the way it looks the color is popping it's super cute I ordered it and it ended up being a little big I wish it was tighter but it's so cute it's worth it
4.0,"they were a little small, my error  so I can't complain"
4.0,I have short legs so these are a bit too long for me but the support is GREAT! No more swollen legs!
4.0,Smaller than I thought but I should have read the description. Great product and great price. Also very cute
4.0,These shoes are a little narrow but I have a narrow foot anyway so they were fine for me. Very comfortable and I love that I can just slip them on. The arch support could be a little better though. But they look great and I wear them quite often
4.0,Right size and came as expected. Loved how it looked but shipping took over 3 weeks.
4.0,Very stunning earrings! I got a pair for my best friend and ask my husband to get them for me as a birthday gift 🎁<br />Was disappointed a bit as they are quite heave and not comfortable to wear all day long especially not overnight
4.0,"Very cute, awesome design, runs a little small.. I hope to look better in it soon."
4.0,"Super cute, figure flattering. The fabric is very nice, dosent wrinkle."
4.0,runs big and the material is sum what see through
4.0,Están hermoso mis niños les encanto
4.0,It wasn't as easy as taking off the plastic band than came with the watch and plugging this one in.  There is a handy tool in the package you have to use to take off the metal components to have it fit properly.
4.0,"Medium weight. I'm 6' 1"", 185, Large fits perfectly, including arms. I have not washed it yet, which is why I've given it four stars.  I'll edit this or bump it up, depending. Excellent with long-sleeved dri-fit."
4.0,great product. totally comfortable to wear it after a long day at the hospital.
4.0,"AirTag fits nicely and was comfortable enough for kids.  However, the little covers pop off easily. We lost two on the first day!"
4.0,"I was looking for a detachable clip for my home keys, this was not what I was looking for but it is very good quality and is durable."
4.0,"It wasn’t what I expected, but the look beautiful."
4.0,IT OK
4.0,"I was happy with my purchase when I received it. I am giving four stars because I wasn't too big of a fan with the material. Other than that, I liked the style and fit."
4.0,During this time - we really need to make the best of the situation and this face mask in not only attractive but fits the requirement of being lightweight and comfortable.
4.0,"This headband is pretty.  A portion of the rhinestone decoration on the headband was loose when I took it out of its plastic wrapping, but I guess, I'll just glue it back."
4.0,Nice quality! Nice fit
4.0,"I only give it 4 cause I for some reason thought it had a clasp or zipper to keep it closed. However, quality is SUPERB.  Lettering and detail are great. Much larger than I expected."
4.0,"The off the shoulder part wouldn’t stay and kept riding up. I ordered a S and it did fit fine. The slit was higher than I expected, but pins made it work."
4.0,Bueno para el precio está bueno todo le funciona bien menos la lucecita de encender en la noche se ve muuuyyyy poquito pero por lo demás tomó bien y no me atrevo a meterlo en el agua ni jugando
4.0,"These are great for the price- seriously. They are thin, so make sure your panties don’t have writing on the that say “spank me”, and they are a light color.  Otherwise they are great. I wear a 6/8 size 130 lbs. I purchased a size up, as being a bit big is better than small- especially in the spandex world.  The large are true to size, I feel like they are plenty big on me, but not baggy.  Very smooth. Not the kind that feel snag like to your hands.  They have a smooth, slick finish.  Very nice. Don’t hesitate to purchase."
4.0,"These are really cute and fit really well. There is a really nice cushion to the entire shoe, not just the insole itself. The glitter has stayed on despite a lot of abuse from my daughter, including a bit of chewing. However, the glitter is rough. It has an almost sandpaper texture, and that wraps around the top, inner part of the shoe. So it has caused a bit of irritation when my daughter walks. It would definitely be better if it were a solid leather type material for that portion of the shoe. But you can also work around it by having your little wear socks. The shoes do run warm, though. They're man made materials and not very breathable. They do tolerate wear, though.<br /><br />I received this item for free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review of the product. I never guarantee positive reviews."
4.0,I need to do more research on scale of tightness.  Once I get these on they are comfortable.  But I think I would prefer less tightness than the 15 - 20 I bought.
4.0,I’m not yet used to the color of the lens but the fit is great.
4.0,"Very nice aviator style glasses. They fit my head well and I really like the little rhinestone accents on them. I like the way these look, not too big. I have a smaller face so sometimes the larger frames make me look like I have big bug eyes, but these are just the right size. The rhinestones look nice and secure and are all well seated in the spaces. The arms on them are a bit thin and I worry that they may not be very durable, but they are metal instead of plastic so that is a plus.  This is a big concern with two small children, I go through sunglasses like crazy! I did receive a discount on this product in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Just like the pic nice fit for my son
4.0,"Nana loves the text! She is a cool Nana and this shirt is not dorky, so it has already been worn."
4.0,"Very comfortable.  I ordered a medium (I'm 5'0 and 140), I probably should have ordered a small, but it's really comfy in a medium.  The only problem is the elastic in the waste, it's already curling up on the inside and I haven't even washed it yet.  I'm considering taking it out and putting a string instead.  Very cute though1"
4.0,"It’s a man’s watch, disappointed it didn’t have leather strap, it’s rubberized plus the watch a little smaller face for a man. He wears it but I would not buy this again for a big man."
4.0,The only thing wrong with them is that they are too short for my liking. Otherwise they fit quite well.
4.0,They look and feel great.
4.0,"I'm not a fan of the fabric, but the fit is amazing. I'm 5'6, the suit was a little too short for me."
4.0,"I ordered this originally because I was looking for tunic-length tops that were a bit more fitted instead of being super baggy like most of them are. On the model, this looks somewhat fitted. My chest measurement was 38.5 inches or so (other measures: 5'10&#34; and 180 lbs), so I originally ordered a Large based on the size chart. It fit ok, but it was pretty baggy, rather than fitted like the model, so I returned it for a Medium, and I was much happier with the fit. The Medium fits me similarly to how it appears to fit on the model, although the model is smaller than me in general.  The Medium is pretty snug through the chest for me, but not to the point that it looks like I'm wearing a size too small or to the point of being uncomfortable.<br /><br />It's soft, the fabric is soft and somewhat stretchy, and it's overall attractive. It is long enough to go to barely cover my bottom without being able to completely fold under it (if that makes any sense), so I could have taken a tiny bit more length for my own bottom-covering comfort, but it's long enough that I don't feel exposed in leggings.  It's cute enough that I also bought it in black, but maybe not quite cute enough for 5 stars. It's simple and casual and perfectly acceptable without being outstanding."
4.0,So four stars because the color in the photo advertised can be a bit misleading. I was under the impression it was more on the mustard yellow side but it’s definitely a much brighter yellow! In which complements my skin tone nicely after all. Other than that it fit perfectly I’m 5”4 and ordered size small. Definitely feels secure on. I’m happy with results!
4.0,The color on the sleeves isn’t as rich as the color on the body. Very comfortable and fits well.
4.0,Small at the bust but great fit elsewear. Loved how sheer it is for the beach
4.0,Love this product is super cute I want it more colors and to have a tiny bit bigger in the neck part. I didn't realized they are attached
4.0,I love the quality of this bag. It feels well made for the price. Only problem - it's flimsy. I wanted a bag that holds it shape and this one clearly and easily folds down for storage I guess.
4.0,"Expensive for how small it is, but nice quality.<br />Came in a tiny gift box."
4.0,Very comfortable and warm. This product is decently made and very worth it for the price i paid for it.
4.0,Picture is deceiving. Thought they were bigger.  Did not work as stated.
4.0,"Great earrings for Tanjiro cosplayers or fans of Demon Slayers! For the price, this product came exactly as I expected. They are fake clip ons, which was exactly what I wanted, so if you're looking for real ones then this isn't the listing for you. The product came exactly as pictured.<br />As for the product itself, the earrings feel lightweight and are comfortable to wear. They are made of Plastic. However, the finish wasn't exactly 100% clean, but for a cheap product for a cheap price, you shouldn't expect perfect quality. They came in quickly and are the most accurate earrings I've seen for this character on the market right now."
4.0,Great fit. Wear to church and out for dinner. I love the color. Got lots of compliments.
4.0,"I bought the shirt as a replacement for another one that got lots of pillage.  So far, this one has none and good appearance otherwise."
4.0,"Love these pants! I’m 5’7”, 150 lbs, and generally wear a size 8 in pants. The medium is a perfect fit. They don’t sag, slide down, or shift while moving. They’ve kept me warm while walking 7 miles in temps as low as 40 degrees with a lot of cold wind. I’ve worn and washed them multiple times and couldn’t be happier. I wash gentle, in cold water and hang to dry. I’ll be ordering another pair soon."
4.0,"Usually size 16. Ordered 3xl. Bottoms are wonderful. Top cups are fine but the band around your top is way too big, makes no sense. I'll have to have it taken in. But it's a great quality suit"
4.0,My friend is graduating from nursing school and I wanted to get her a gift that was nice but inexpensive. I was going to get her &#34;The Key to Success&#34; one instead because it just made more sense with the occasion but I liked this pendant better. I was a little worried this necklace would look too cheap to give to her but it's actually really cute. The only thing that looks cheap is the chain it comes on but the cost of the necklace was low enough that I don't mind spending a little extra to buy a new chain somewhere else to replace it. I'm giving it to her in a few weeks and hopefully she'll like it as much as I do.
4.0,These seam like good quality guages. At first I thought the ones with the gemstones weren't going to fit but the backs unscrew so they work great.
4.0,I love turtles. This one is a good watch ring but the baby turtle on top os loose. Afraid it will fall off.
4.0,For some reason I thought they would be bigger in size. Nevertheless they are very pretty and light as paper! The material does not change color or stain your skin. I gifted a pair to my friend and she loved them as well!
4.0,style is great only issue is the color fades
4.0,Look good in terms of quality. I am 110 and order small. It fit fine.the shirt is little long. Am 5’3shiry is  Long but nothing too crazy. I haven’t use it in the beach or pool yet. I be back to update. If review is helpful hit the helpful bottoms and let me know
4.0,"Medium is a little tight but love the feel and breathablity of these. This is my third purchase of this brand, definitely my favorite"
4.0,Item made very well. My only disappointment was that there was a not wire to secure the nose area.
4.0,Nice kinda fair material but ok
4.0,The overall color was a bit darker than the picture showed. There is a lot more grey/silver in the scarf. But it still is a fun Christmas season scarf.
4.0,a little smaller than I thought but well made
4.0,"Beautiful dress. It looks even better than in the photo. Ordering smaller size. But keep in mind that it's made of polyester, that's why the skirt is producing static electricity - special spray needed.<br />It's not written clearly about the material.<br />But I love the style!"
4.0,"I sent it back; it was long in the torso, and it was a little hard to get into. The breast pads were in a weird place, but then that could be my &#34;girls&#34;, they have moved south! I'm 5'3&#34;, 175 lbs. On the upside, this suit seems to be well-constructed."
4.0,"It had some duplicates like RG3 listed twice (once without the III), as well as Corey Brown and Philly Brown who are the same person. It was also missing Larry Donnell and Marques Wilson. Overall, it's a nice board and I like the 6 foot length."
4.0,Nice watch and really like the clasp.
4.0,"Im new at these so it was weird and constricting the first few times. I didnt realize I had to tuck it in my pants but it was still fine when tucked in, although less comfortable when sitting as it pushed up into my bra. Lots of clasps!! It didn't pull me into an hour glass middle but still helps to slim/smooth me up so I plan to keep wearing it!"
4.0,keeps your head warm and provides good sound
4.0,My boyfriend loves it he use it all the time the material is really resistant
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:a9269157a4236d0cbf20fa645762f849]] This polo is a very well made, strong quality shirt. I like that there are 2 buttons at the collar, and the dinosaur pattern is very fun.<br /><br />It can match a lot of shorts and pants and is a comfortable way to look a little more dressed up! I machine washed it on delicates and tumble dried on medium without any problems (although the instructions say not to tumble dry).<br /><br />The fit is good, as my son is 3 and a tad on the tall and skinny side. The 3T fits him well.<br /><br />I would have given this 5 stars except that the print says Ahoy when I think it should have said Roar."
4.0,"Love it, fits perfectly, just a couple of inches too long for my taste. I took a star off just in comparison to all my miusols."
4.0,Nice charm but crystals are a little smaller than expected. Over all still a cute bead.
4.0,"Not to bad, would prefer to cover all of face, still cool looking."
4.0,"Very convenient. Easy to clean.  Wish the glow in the dark part was brighter, though."
4.0,"The material is a little thin, but all in all, I like it"
4.0,Strong study metal easy to read lettering
4.0,"This is a nice looking dress.  I had not expected it to be a thin polyester fabric, but that's what it is.  It feels soft, with just a faint sheen.  I bought it for my daughter, and it fits her well.  She likes it, so that's what matters."
4.0,Good for mild weather. Spring and early fall.
4.0,Very cute great for the price!
4.0,"It’s pretty good, I’ve sat on it several times by accident and it didn’t break so cool👍"
4.0,The quality is what I expected for a costume piece and the price. The wings are exactly as pictured. I got them for my eight year old and knew that they'd be too big. I was prepared to make adjustments for the price. They would fit an adult perfectly.
4.0,Looks just as pictured. So far the clip is holding up well (2 months on daughters back pack thus far).
4.0,"These provide a good high arch support, however it is not very comfortable for standing long hours. I have a standing desk at work, and was wearing these in my shoes. It hurt my feet after a few hours standing.<br />In terms of size, they were a bit smaller than my size 9 women's shoes, whereas normally I'd expect insoles to be a bit larger and trim them down."
4.0,"Fabric not shiny at all, very comfortable. Body is long and very wide compared to the top. I'm keeping it."
4.0,"Beautiful color.  You need to wear a slip under the skirt, because you can see through it.  I am 5' 8.5"" and it was a little short on me."
4.0,Had to go a size up. The arms are very small but the material is beautiful
4.0,Really like this bathing suite.  Fits good and super comfortable
4.0,"This is VERY cute! The lines are screen printed on, and you can somewhat tell but I still like it!"
4.0,"Fit great, very grippy, but my only complaint is that the glove material on your fingers catches on velcro  (your pod pack for example) starts to tear apart the material on the glove. See photograph after one practice."
4.0,The mask itself is very high quality for the price but the lenses fog very easily
4.0,"My customers love this headband, but the price increased $1. Crap."
4.0,"It's short! It's cute, but very short."
4.0,"Actually, it's much nicer than I anticipated for the price! it doesn't pretend to be hard thick gold! but it's plated nicely and the mechanisms very good! and it's aesthetically pleasing! I like it very much! thank You!"
4.0,i have a decent size chest (36DD) and these held up nicely. Its working great in the summer clothes so i don't have straps showing. Its comfortable and well supportive. The quality is high and durable. Highly recommend this to anybody
4.0,"Even though color as pictured, I returned since was not a good match for my skin tone. Runs larger."
4.0,"They're cute. The lights in them are incredibly bright! They're exactly what my little on wanted. I haven't had any problems with them yet, but the Velcro straps don't seem to be of the best quality. We'll see if they stand the test of time, but I'm sincerely not going to be holding my breath on that one."
4.0,Ears don’t stand up
4.0,Was a x-mas present for my grandson who said he really like them
4.0,Was the only sash I could find for my kindergarten graduation shoot. Was pleasantly surprised but would stick to buying this for young kids .
4.0,feels a little big but with a belt it good
4.0,It is a very nice looking badge.  My only gripe is the pin on the back is so deep that when pinned to my jacket it does not sit flush but is floating off the jacket a good 1/8”-1/4” which looks a bit wired.
4.0,"It's a very beautiful mask, but it is quite large.  It is also made with a thicker material, and with the filter in it can be a little heavy and thick."
4.0,Thought it would have a soft leathery look but kinda looks like cheap vinyl
4.0,NICE...ALL WORKED!!!
4.0,Looks just like the picture. This is a great deal.  Rings are a little tight. But so happy with product I just reorder a big size.
4.0,"I like the necklace, but it was delivered one day late"
4.0,"I received this shirt on time and I was pleased with the quality of the material, but I will have to layer it since it is a little too see through. This shirt is cute but somewhat large, which I like but you might want to order down. If they had other colors I would order again."
4.0,"This vintage 1950s-1960s Audrey Hepburn style dress is absolutely gorgeous. The material is soft, yet strong so it will last for several years. The material has a little stretch to it and it isn't too light. The style and cut of the dress is flattering to almost all body types. It is a simply detailed little black dress than you can dress up for fancy parties or dress down for more casual parties. It is perfect for a date night. This dress can easily be accessorized with endless options of jewelry and shoes. And even different hair styles will give this dress a new look each time you change something up. It features a zipper under the arm that doesn't fully open the side. It's purpose seems to be to give room for your breasts to slide in, because this is a slip on over the head dress. The A-line design is very slimming and give you a waist even if you don't have much of one. The reason I took away one star is due to the sizing. It is way off. I ordered a XX-L, but the dress is truly somewhere between a medium-large. I had to get my aunt to try the dress on to see what it looked like. Other than that, gorgeous, gorgeous dress.<br /><br />I received this dress at a discount for reviewing purposes and to give my truthful, unbiased opinion."
4.0,"This item looked great except for two things: it wasn't very wrinkled when it arrived and because of the style I could see that it would be tough to iron. Also, the holes where your hands come out of the sleeve were almost too small for me"
4.0,The bars are a little too long for my preference however these are truly 14g & they look great!
4.0,Quality product just way small
4.0,Fit was to snug for my daughter. Wish we could have ordered a bigger size.
4.0,So cute on! Doesn't provide a lot of warmth but is the perfect accessory scarf!
4.0,"Got the wrong face but eh, I can sew on a different one with some scrap fabric. I also noticed as I was seam-ripping that the... hoops? (the elastic that goes around your ear, lol) seems pretty delicate. That, and the actual stitching was &#34;robotic-China-factory quality&#34; (AKA not very good)"
4.0,Easy to put in.  Nice colors.
4.0,NOT A FULL DRESS AS EXPECTED
4.0,I like it got it in black and wine. Only reason to take a star off is it's not warm it's just a plain coverup jersey material. Also it is a little longer than I would have liked
4.0,great price and the green color is perfect
4.0,It's beautiful- but does not come with a chain like I thought.  Just the medal.
4.0,"I like these pants! They’re not she at all which is very nice, only thing is they bunch up a little and are a bit baggy feeling but i think that’s easily fixable buy getting the next size down. I was in between small and medium and got medium, wouldve been better with a small but still happy with these!"
4.0,Good material a little large in size but nothing to complain about. Very soft.
4.0,"Cute. Sleeves are bell shaped on the ends which I don't like bc they get into things. Customer service was good though,  they offered partial refund and let me keep the sweater.<br /><br />I'm 5'2 approx 125 lbs and got medium. It fits well,  not loose, not tight."
4.0,"I am a size 10-12, 5'10"" tall and 170lbs. The large fit well, it's even a bit long (which rarely happens for tall people)!  It's a nice thicker material, not see-through."
4.0,"My daughter loves this dress and so do I!  It’s so cute and adorable, with enough detail to make it stand out from the costumes sold in stores.  The fabric is soft and shimmer with some movement.  The only thing I didn’t like is the pants to come with the dress were too big.  No way would the size of the dress be for a little girl that could wear those pants.  They are supposed to fit like tights but are super baggy and long."
4.0,These are a bargain for the price.
4.0,Very snug.  Best without curves and no gut or rolls.
4.0,"Right out of the shipping bag, I had high expectations. It was packaged nicely and was well protected. When I took it out, I was happy to find it had a good weight to it, the cloth itself felt sturdy, and it had the texture I imagined it should. The size was as expected and perfect for me. Though, when I went to put it on, I thought I should perhaps give it a closer inspection (since previous reviews complained of staining and gaps). I'm fond of the tassels, those looked fine, but as I checked the patterned sections I found gaps in the fabric and bunched black threading (I imagine the thread that was supposed to fill the gapped sections (bottom area of photo). It was a bit disappointing, considering everything else was going so well. Since it is otherwise high quality, and the small imperfections don't have a huge affect in the look of it, nor does it seem to affect the integrity, I'll be keeping it.<br /><br />Edit to add: Now that I have worn it out a few times: it keeps my face warm, the imperfections aren't even noticed, it looks the way I wanted it to, still love the tassels"
4.0,"This is a great product for a wheelchair user. I won’t say folding it back up is easy,  but I don’t plan on doing that. It’s covers my daughters legs and backpack perfectly. The hood is kind of useless if you have a chair with a headrest. Still, it’s way better than putting a second jacket on her knees."
4.0,"I love it, I'm so glad I read the reviews to order a size up, so glad I did, you will not be disappointed! Price was great and was delivered very quickly, can't wait to go to the beach!!"
4.0,"A little bit heavy, but they are really nice and pretty!  I have VERY sensitive ears, and they did not bother them at all."
4.0,My son really loved the look of them and said they were great at blocking the sun but that the nosepiece was a little loose. Overall a good buy.
4.0,It’s a great jacket for layering and it looks nice.
4.0,"I’m 5’9, 160 lbs, and have 34DD.... this is a very cute set but it was definitely made for women with smaller breast. I ordered a large which was too big around my torso but waaaay too small for my breast. The panties fit fine and allowed for easy access ;) I wore this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it, despite how funny the top looked on me. The neck sits a little weird and lace at the bottom of the top acts more as coverage for the rest of you boob"
4.0,"Love it!  Perfect for leggings, getting ready to order another one in a different color."
4.0,"Fits women's heads. I have a large head, so it was a little snug.<br /><br />These are super cute, and come exactly as pictured. However, you've got to keep in mind that these are not intended for the long-term. The flowers are really just paper, glued on with hot glue.<br /><br />Really did the trick and was worth the money! If you are looking at these for a fun event (like I was), go for it!"
4.0,The recipient loves this shirt. It fits exactly as expected. A very cool design.
4.0,"Yeah yeah, I know it's sweet. This has potential to be a great conversation starter every time you get it out to pay. This is definitely pleather. It is still in good shape after several months. The corners all have a bit of fraying from the gray nylon material. It does not appear to be coming apart though. There is not a ton of room for cards in this wallet, and you better upload all your pictures to the holo-cloud. ID slot is nice and easy to insert or remove ID. The emblem appears to be metal and it is heavy. You could use that Heavy Metal as a weapon. Seriously. You could leave a rebel shaped mark on an attacker that asks for your wallet, lol. I would not recommend that tactic however."
4.0,a bit to snug for an adult head
4.0,"I love this little jacket! It is so cute!! I was hoping it would be a little bigger than it was, but it fits my granddaughter."
4.0,"These glasses were perfect for my Jade cosplay, though, the paint is chipping after long use. I bought this back last year, around August, and they last a long, long time. I would touch up the pain now and again though, if you use them constantly. :B"
4.0,"This dress is really pretty, but definitely not made for a tall person! I am 5'9&#34; and it fits me like an empress waist. Very pretty though!"
4.0,"One of the warmest tops I have ever purchased..... Very comfortable... I ordered the plus version... The ONLY dislike is that it is a little shorter than it appears in the picture. It doesn't quite cover over my hip area, which is really why I wanted it because the picture shows it does..... Other than that, I love it...."
4.0,"I like it and it is pretty, the only  negative part is that it is set for someone with small wrist, I am trying to find a way to add a inch extender to this for myself otherwise I will make bracelets and give them as gifts to those with small wrist."
4.0,"It's exactly as advertised.  Easy to shorten.  The buckle seems a little light weight, but only time will tell."
4.0,Nice socks for cold floors - last a long time.
4.0,"Love this dress!!!! Cute and fun print! Just needed a hair larger size through the bust area, every where else was a good fit. Sadly larger bust sizes are hard to fit right into standard sizes. Get bigger it's too big on the body, get normal size too tight in bust!"
4.0,Good material and good service.  Thank you!!
4.0,Un excelente regalo para mamá!!
4.0,Good value but they’re actually true to size don’t order bigger
4.0,The  swimsuit is very nice but way to small. I wear a US size 8 and ordered a medium. It didn't fit my boobs at all and the bottoms nearly cut off my circulation. It seems like Asian sizing.
4.0,Top part not as flattering of fit
4.0,I accidentally bought the wrong gauges and forgot to return them. They're good quality despite my mistake!
4.0,"I like this dress. It is very simple, light, and the material is very soft. I am 5'3 so the dress comes to the middle of my knee- I do wish it was a little shorter. Definitely recommend if you want a cute simple everyday dress."
4.0,"The pilling became noticeable after one single wear for one single evening. However, they were $10... so what else do you expect? They’ll be fine for wearing around the house / to run errands / or for layering. Warning: crotch inseam is very short so they seem kinda uncomfortable when you first put them on. But, if you pull up st the knees some to hike them up, they’ll be just fine. Worth the $10. Don’t expect them to last forever."
4.0,This purse was recommended by a friend. She purchased the shoulder bag in camel. The bag is great and she really loves it. I like the color and the zippered compartments for better organization. I think that you could fit a large amount of items in these bags and they look great.
4.0,"Nice so far, this is my second pair. The first pair got covered with over spray. i accidentally rubbed the reflective coating off with polish trying to clean them."
4.0,"I like that the umbrella is lightweight, there are no prints on it, the easy open button, and easy to carry around, except for the fact that it doesn't come with a carrier that could prevent your things from getting wet."
4.0,"Nice and warm and comfortable. I normally wear a size 8 shoe which would correspond to a medium but went up a size to the large. I’m glad I did because I feel even these are a little small. It also could be because the back part that covers the heel is a little low though. I do wish that came up a bit more. Overall, they’re really nice slippers. Not heavy either."
4.0,Ordered size small for my 11year old daughter. Can't find girl size dresses for her except@kohls. Fits well. Not to big. But hate that it is see through at the bottom. Order a slip. Material looks like it might fade after first wash or so.
4.0,"Love the pants, fit perfectly!!  The only downside was that they were delivered UPS instead of regular prime and for some reason required me to sign fir them.  Since I wasn’t home, caused me to have to go and pick up, which defeats the purpose of ordering via Amazon."
4.0,"It’s not the most comfortable, but it keeps you pretty warm and I love the design."
4.0,"Wife really liked it, she wished there was an in between size from small to medium."
4.0,"The leather parts of the vest are unremarkable at best, quality wise. The snaps need work and the elastic loops in the gun pockets don't seem to make much sense. Don't bother trying to squeeze a large caliber in those pockets but a smaller lighter .22 semi auto works well. I do admit the price is right though."
4.0,Nice but a little smaller than advertised size
4.0,I like it! This flouncy top fits well in the shoulders then flairs out for maximum comfort. I wore it all day yesterday paired with jeans for a casual jaunt around town as I ran errands. The olive green is a great color - a bit unusual yet earthy. The details add interest yet the cotton makes this cool and comfortable. Very happy with this.
4.0,"I'm 5'3 125lbs and got a small. The skirt fit perfectly but the top was WAY too big. I even tried to pin it, but the back just looked funny. I'm afraid to get a size smaller since the waist was pretty snug. I was anticipating the fabric to wrinkle being in the bag, but no wrinkles and such great quality. Not see thru either which is super nice."
4.0,I love this necklace but the chain broke the first time I wore it. The chain is very dainty and doesn’t hold up.
4.0,"Well after waiting for this to show up...it was ONLY 1...would have been nice to notice that when I ordered (So I could have ordered 2).  But other than that I really love this item.  Worth the price.  haven't wore it because that would look weird, so I don't know if they would hold up under use."
4.0,"It's very light weight, but nice for the price."
4.0,"This wallet is very cute and when you add in the RFID blocking technology that just makes it a million times more functional. I have enclosed a picture of the wallet pulled opens looking down in. You can see one side is open, which I would assume is for change/money, and the other side is for credit cards.<br /><br />It does seem very roomy on the inside, as in that it would hold plenty of cards, cash, and change with out worry about it being over stretched it hard to zipper. Additionally I love the handle that's attached that turns the ordinarily wallet into a viper cute clutch for on the go!<br /><br />My main issues with this are first of all while the clutch is great in height it doesn't have much in the way of legenth so I can fit my phone inside (not do I thing any modern smart phone would squeeze inside). When I typically bring a clutch I want to be able to fit all my essential inside.<br /><br /> Note I did receive this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my fair and honest review. All opinions expressed are solely my own and are completely honest."
4.0,"I read that they run a tad small so instead of buying a &#34;Small&#34; I purchased a &#34;Medium&#34;. Fits good, a little looser than I'd like, but ...<br />Biggest disappointment is that it's suggested method of laundering is the Dryclean process. Well, &#34;That's not MY laundry!&#34; (Grin)<br />So I tossed it in the laundry, washed on regular setting in cold water.  Next, it was on to the dryer where it was subjected to about forty minutes at the &#34;low&#34; setting. It came through all that just fine. Iron with minimal heat (or not at all), and presto!<br />A very nice shirt."
4.0,Nice gloves but were small.  I ended up giving them to a co-worker.
4.0,"I really like the fun shape and eye coverage of these mirrored-lens sunglasses. As other reviewers have stated, they are dark, but for me they weren't so dark that I couldn't drive while wearing them. The frame itself is *really* simple plastic; it's not weighty or &#34;high quality,&#34; but it gets the job done--especially for the price. The temples fit snugly over my ears without any uncomfortable pinching or squeezing, and they stay perfectly in place. I bought these in the clear/no color option so that I can wear them with anything, and I think I'll be wearing them often."
4.0,It was really great after my shoulder op as it made it easy for the doctor and physio to do checks and treatment. But I can’t wear it for long as the material is very thick and not very breathable
4.0,My little boy loves it
4.0,Pendant is as expected but the chain fell apart before I could even get it on. Gave it 4 Stars because the pendant is beautiful and $15. I kind of expected I would have to invest in a good silver chain. Real cost with a good chain is $40.
4.0,"Buen reloj, cumple su función..."
4.0,"So pretty, and SO SOFT!!!  A bit smaller than I had expected and the buttons do not open - they're only for decoration. But overall I love this top!"
4.0,"Dress is pretty much true to size. I bought a size L ,I'm 5'4 and weigh 165ish. The dress isn't form fitting which makes it perfect to wear to work. Material isn't see through but thin enough to wear on hot summer days. Wish they had this dress in print also."
4.0,"This piece is so beautiful. The torso is a little small, which if you are chesty, means that the you don't have a lot of support, but overall incredibly sexy. The fabric is soft and stretchy also and of high quality. Would buy again."
4.0,"BUY A SIZE OR TWO UP. I wear a medium in clothes and after reading the reviews, i decided to get a size a couple size bigger. I ordered a XL and and it fits like a medium (snug). Other than that, the dress is a great dress. Belt is not included."
4.0,I absolutely love this hat amd can't wait to wear it.
4.0,"Comfortable, fit well, good price. Everything I was looking for."
4.0,"I ordered this dress in yellow and the color is definitely way brighter than it looks in the picture. It is almost like a highlighter yellow, which looks fantastic with my skin in the summertime. Its a simple flowy dress which is super comfortable and stylish. I probably could have ordered a size down, but it still looks nice enough to wear to work or out. For reference, I am 5'6 and I ordered a Large, but should have went down to a Medium."
4.0,"I like these a lot but wish there was more of a shine. I love a sparkly earring for my little girls. Expected them to be more bright! Love them though, especially for the price."
4.0,Great cover for my intended outfit. Very pleased
4.0,This was ladies size but fit a child 7/8 above. Very all waist. Did well because we needed them for kids dance. Photo is 6 yr old
4.0,"The cut is very cute, but in certain problematic areas (AKA the bust) it runs a bit small."
4.0,"Look these are great for the price. I went up a whole size. Make sure you loosen the laces as much as possible and it will likely zip up your calf and then you can make the laces look nice and normal afterwards. I am 64.5 inches tall, 160 pounds. I have mid size calves, nothing crazy. I have a slim foot. These are slim shoes. I usually am a 7.5, so yeah! Go up a size! But dang these are cute. I recommend."
4.0,"Decent… I really like the purple color, but the quality… huummmm, sort of clunky-chunky. It's alright."
4.0,great fit and good fabric
4.0,"Gift to my daughter, the color was very pretty and the fit was great. The only issue was on first wear it was piling on the back."
4.0,Wonderful shoe but the stitch got loose fast
4.0,"As another reviewer stated, they come in plastic bag in a terrible little box. This isn't a problem if you get another box if you plan to present them to someone. The color and weight seem fine. They are pretty tight--more like a choker, which is also fine. One thing that I wasn't please about was the way they hang when you hold them in your hand--not straight. It must be the way that they are strung. I did try them by putting them on and they seemed fine, however. I guess I shouldn't complain for the money. I would have to spend a couple hundred more to get better quality. I bought these for my daughter to wear with a suit. They are at least as good as costume jewelry."
4.0,"The black pair immediately broke as soon as I put them on. So far, no issues with the other pairs and super cute! Doesn’t irritate sensitive skin either"
4.0,Just like it and he will too
4.0,"This is the first off the shoulder top I've ever bought let alone worn, but I like it. The pattern is cute and the color (maroon) is pretty. It takes a little getting used to wearing a shirt around your shoulders, especially if you are big chested and MUST wear a bra with straps so things don't go bouncing around or popping out. I ended up wearing a tank top/thick strapped camisole underneath to help hide the bra straps, and it looked fine. The fit of the body is flowy though a little on the boxy side. If you have a tummy, then yay. This shirt skims over everything without looking like a muu muu or circus tent.  Sizes are listed in US sizes, though take those at face value because you don't want to go by size number but your actual measurements.<br /><br />(Soapbox vent - It would be so nice if the whole world could agree to size clothing strictly on body measurements. Two dozen shirts in a size 12 from different brands (heck, even the same brand) will ALL be different sizes and fits. But anywhere in the world, an inch is an inch, a centimeter is a centimeter, for Pete's sake.)<br /><br />The fabric is rayon, and if you run hot then beware. This sucker holds the heat in something fierce. Maybe that's why it's designed to be off the shoulder!  Before the first wear, make sure to check for loose threads (there are several), inspection stickers (there are several), and to wash in it's own little protective laundry bag so it doesn't get snagged. Instructions say to hand wash and line dry, though I wash in the machine on delicate in cold water. I do hang to dry in order to prevent shrinking. Wrinkles aren't really a problem. Not sure if I'd buy this shirt or similar off the shoulder shirt again, though. I don't like having to readjust the shoulders anytime I move or lift an arm."
4.0,"It is kinda made cheaply. It broke the first time I wore it. I was able to fix it, but am a little disappointed with the quality. Looks nice though...added a pic of the bracelet with (with another one I own)."
4.0,Let me start with the fact that it took a month to get! If your looking at getting this dress make sure your ordering it way in advance before you need it! Other then the shipping taking forever the dress fits perfect! JUST ORDER ASAP! If your looking to get one!
4.0,I love the ring the only downside is that the ring runs a bit on the big side.
4.0,Shoes are super cute and seem to be good quality! My little one hasn’t worn them much yet but they seem to be good- I love that they have a Velcro strap and that the Velcro is strong enough that my 2-year-old doesn’t take them off.
4.0,Run a little bit bigger but is more comfortable in my opinion
4.0,"Looks great and quality serms fine (for the price). It is a good value.<br /><br />The band looks good but is not very comfortable. To me, that’s the only thing that needs improvement."
4.0,"Again this is so beautiful but I wish it was made a little better, I would have paid more if it was made to hold up."
4.0,But part looks super weird and not “lifting” and hard to pull up
4.0,"This rain jacket feels pretty well made.  I've had to use it a couple times but it definitely feels like it's on the small side for the size I got.  I was actually trying to pick a size larger than what I would need too.  My recommendation is if you're getting this jacket, to get a size larger than what you normally wear.  Maybe it's just my personal body shape that causes the issue but if I were to get the size I ""should"" wear, there's no way it would fit me.  Other than that, I stayed dry in it while wearing it so it does it's job.  The zipper quality is okay.  Seemed like it wanted to keep biting the fabric so I'd be careful when zipping it up and down.  Other than that, it's a fine rain coat."
4.0,Which it  had more support in chest area  The comfort and fit is excellent don't know you have it on
4.0,The dress is beautiful but it was big on me. I picked the size according to the chart. It is also longer than I expected.
4.0,"It's pretty and flattering, but long on me. I'm 5'3&#34; and it falls well below my knees."
4.0,I would order a size up I ordered my size but It shrunk a little when I washed it. I love the look and the pockets though.
4.0,White is very see through on the body! The top is thicker fabric and not see through at all. The top had a nice button in the chest to keep the cleavage to a minimum. The lace on the arms I cut off cause I did not like it at all. I kept the lace on the bottom. I bought a size large (5’5” 157 lbs 38DD chest) and wore some full body shareware to combat the sheerness. The material was flexible and I was able to dance all night in it and be comfortable. I got quite a few compliments on it.
4.0,Great children's watch except for the fact that it isn't more water resistant. So I couldn't give it more than 4 stars.
4.0,just what I needed to keep my feet dry
4.0,"I like the look but they are a snug fit around calf and I do not have big calves, they stretch out and slip if I am wearing them against my skin."
4.0,"I love this dress so much! It is not see through and is the perfect length on me (5’7). However, I did take away one star because the tag does say “dry clean only.” Follow my Instagram for more amazon finds @blessing.belle.blog"
4.0,I'm enjoying this tunic. Hides all that leggins may show.
4.0,"The cut of the dress was very flattering! Loved how it fit. I’m 5’4”, 135#. I’m returning it only because the print placed a large circular paisley in the middle of my chest which looked like a very awkward eye. Lol! I don’t want a one eyed chest job. Will probably get other colors, prints."
4.0,"Great dress, somewhat large. I wear a belt with it. Worth the money. I would buy it again but a smaller size."
4.0,"Its pretty cute for the price! Definitely a little wrinkly but headsup, dont try to iron :( i think a blowdryer might work but i have to see. Very thin fabric but i wouldnt call it sheer or say you need a slip for the gray. The whites probably different. Nice light dress for warm days, very flowy and casual"
4.0,"I think for most people the correct sizing needs to be right. I am 5'7 and wear size 10 jeans. Size 8 dresses in U.S. Sizing and am currently tipping the scales at 155 lbs. I wanted to be on the safe side and have the harem pants be baggy , loose, and comfortable. I purchased the 'Plus size' based on another review that a size 10 would be okay with that size. I am glad that I did. I have already worn for lounging and during yoga."
4.0,"Not necessarily a quality piece, but exactly what I was looking for to give my granddaughter when she got her license."
4.0,Good size on keychain.
4.0,nice and simple
4.0,Adorable top! Fits as expected.
4.0,"Beautiful dress, love the fabric and design, but it was made for chestier girls. With B/C size there is too much fabric that just hangs like a sack in the front.  Had to return it :("
4.0,"It’s very cuddly and large, but leaves strings of lint on everything ( even after washing a few times). Worth buying though, it doubled as a blanket on my flight."
4.0,It breaks after few uses
4.0,These were a hit!  I purchased them to be placed into gift bags for a womens shelter!  They were walking around inside eoth gloves on showing off the fun style
4.0,"I was very happy with these unique shoes (until my dogs ate one). They are stylish and comfortable once broken in(dont recommend any court runs or long walks until they are broken in though, otherwise ouch), i highly recommend these with jeans, i tried them with a suit, but to me the shoe materials clash with wool, maybe a seersucker summer suit would fit more nicely. Enjoy, Jason, the people's reviewer."
4.0,"I got these for Christmas presents for the grandchildren, they loved them."
4.0,"Purchased this despite no published reviews.  Very pleased with the look and quality of the jersey.  Could not see the front before I ordered but it exceeded my expectations - Germany National Team logo and 2014 World Cup Champions patch.  Arrived as scheduled.  Only reason I have not given 5 stars in this review is that I have not washed it yet.  Otherwise, happy with this item and look forward to wearing it during World Cup this summer."
4.0,Would have been nicer to have an elastic band
4.0,Good quality belt for a reasonable price.
4.0,Top is a little snug in the bust area for me but bottoms fit just right.
4.0,"I run with this belt 9 miles today, this belt worked well no bouncing around during running. It is a little bit hassle to put the water bottle back to the pouch when you are running. The pocket for car key is too small. The 500ml water bottle is not enough for a long run.<br />Overall it is a very good water belt, specially if you don’t have some fat around your waist. This is the only water belt work for me."
4.0,Great product for a gift
4.0,"This fits exactly what I wanted it to be -- size, quality and aesthetics."
4.0,Expect long shipment times. It took over a month to get here however I read that prior to ordering. I ordered my normal size. I ordered 2 colors and they fit great! Enough stretch but keeps you sucked in at the same time. They are a thick material that isn’t sheer at all.
4.0,"Cheap, but it lasted halloween!"
4.0,"Could have been a little smaller, but very pretty."
4.0,"Did not hold for long, wrote to customer support, replaces it without problems."
4.0,"This is a very warm top without being bulky. It’s well made and washes up great (I wash it inside out and hang dry so it doesn’t pill). The cut is flattering and I like that it’s long enough to wear with leggings but not so long it looks frumpy. The only drawback is the sizing is really inconsistent. I got the burgundy in a size small and it fit perfectly so I ordered another in the sage green. It’s huge in comparison to the point I wondered if the wrong size had been sent, but both are labeled as small."
4.0,"So cute! I've wanted ear crawlers for awhile but just never got around to getting them. These are super cute and dainty. I'm not sure the back that goes through your ear hole will stand the test of time. While it isn't super fragile it is dainty so I'm afraid it will snap off eventually making them unwearable. For now though, they are super cute!"
4.0,I like it how it fitted.
4.0,I already had a black pair and really liked them so bought brown. Wish they had other colors. These gloves are comfortable and not bulky. Not good for really cold weather but perfect for driving.
4.0,very cute love it .
4.0,Wrong color that way only 4 stars.
4.0,"The sizing fits me kind of weird, im 5'4&#34;, size 34c, weigh 135lbs, the length fits me good, i dont feel &#34;too reveling&#34; on the backside (but this depends on your own personality, and honestly i dont plan on wearing it out of the water without a cover up anyway, just like any other bathingsuit) however the top part feels a bit too snug. I dont have big breast at all, and any bigger it would be really uncomfortable. This will work for me, it doesnt look on me like i was hoping it would, but its not bad either. But i did receive this before expected date, which was nice!"
4.0,"I would definitely order a size bigger than what you'd normally need. I wear a 4x and I ordered a 5x, it fits like a 4x. Good quality, heavier cloth than I thought but that's not a bad thing."
4.0,"The material is very well-made, comfortable, and stretchy! I love this dress so much! My only criticism is that it doesn't sit as good on my frame as I had hoped even though I bought a size up - I have &#34;high hips&#34; and am somewhat busty, so this dress kind of rides up under my tatas like an empire waist would and isn't slimming. I love how I can just put my hands in the pockets and pull it down that way, though. It really is a great dress!"
4.0,I love the dress it is very cute. It it wasn’t very long so I will just have to wear flat sandals with it. Delivery was fast too!
4.0,"Cute, bright, summery. I like it! Material is nice and thin without being see through. Fits true to size. I ordered a small, which is what I normally wear and it fits as it should.<br />Disclaimer: This review reflects my own and unbiased opinion. I am not affiliated with the seller nor do I get any privileges or discounts for writing this review."
4.0,"beautiful coat,unfortunately too small,waiting for a bigger size"
4.0,Very nice medium weight hat.
4.0,Perfect fit. Super comfy with winter boots.
4.0,"I love the style and the fit of these socks on my leg, but they are too tight on the toes.  I just keep stretching them out to give my toes more room.  That's probably due to the fact that I wear a size 10 shoe and they're made for 6-10.  But I enjoy wearing them and get comments on how cute they are!  They certainly do what they are intended to do, which is keep my feet and legs from swelling."
4.0,Smaller then it looks and  turtles look better in pic
4.0,Beautiful but chain is very dainty so will have to buy a heavier one but actual B is perfect.
4.0,Nice socks comfortable
4.0,Husband loved his hat . Good fit and quality was good enough . It does shield  from the sun .
4.0,Good product for playing beach vball or in this case my 4 year old running around in the hot sand. Perfect protection and is multi functional so she can go in the sand and water
4.0,"Good quality for the price. Looks great on a chain though you must buy your own. I have a feeling that with force or getting it caught on something, you may tear off the moon stone accidently"
4.0,"Love this purse!  Its very roomy, stylish.  The interior pocket design is one like you've not seen before!  As others have stated, its seems to be a 'stiff&#34; purse--it is, but seems to be 'wearing in&#34; just fine.  I will be paying attention to the inside materials, however.  The inner lining/pocket material does not seem &#34;high quality&#34; and very stiff.  So far, overall, I love the purse.  I've had it about a week now.  Giving it some 'break in time' and predicting the best outcome.  I like it.  I have no regrets on this purchase at this point."
4.0,"This dress is very pretty, but does have some things you need to take into consideration before you buy. You'll need a white dress slip to go under it as the lace top is just lace and therefore completely see through. There is a liner under the skirt (which goes to a really good knee length, by the way), but even so it'll be see through without the slip. I bought up one size based upon reviews, but had to return that and get two sizes up. The length was great. I'm 5'7, 180lbs and I ended up with the XXL.<br /><br />There was an X marked on my skirt that ended up washing off after two washes."
4.0,"Very comfy and decent quality. It was just a little short for my taste. Overall, I'd probably order another one in another color"
4.0,"I got a size small because it was recommended. The shorts are a little big. I’m 130 lbs and 5’6. The sleeves are a bit short, they fall about an inch before the bottom knuckle of my thumbs. The cami fits and the bottoms have a little wiggle room. I plan of washing the set on cold and letting it air dry to prevent shrinking. The material is a slightly coarse knit but I don’t mind the feel of it."
4.0,"My daughter had been wanting a hat to wear with her long hair. She likes to keep it in a pony tail. The hat fits as expected, and decent quality. The product arrived quickly."
4.0,My nieces are young and like to wear these modern braclets.
4.0,At least it keeps time. But the band is darker blue than it looks in the picture.
4.0,"My wife said its too smal, but a nice earrings anyway."
4.0,"Lighter weight and more flexible-plastic feel than Apple OEM-which will probably be more durable.  But, at 1/3 the price it is worth it.  Comfortable and colorful."
4.0,A little more see through than I anticipated but a nice light and bright shirt for working out and summer.  Thank you
4.0,I got the beautiful red one!  Its big enough to hold all of my stuff...and I had a lot of stuff!  Still very new so I will update if its starts showing  any wear.
4.0,My husband is very pleased with this wallet.
4.0,I planned to wear the gold belt with a dress for a party but ultimately the dress did not work out so I ended up returning this item. The belts are really stretchy and fit comfortably. Not super high quality but they would work to enhance an outfit. My biggest complaint is the color. I anticipated more of a rose gold color but it was a more brassy gold.
4.0,"not the most professional looking pants because they are kind of snug around the thigh area, but professional looking enough for day to day work."
4.0,"Good, not perfect.  A little clingy/snug in the back so if your bra creates any unsightly roll, you may want to go up a size.  I bought a large and wear a size 12. I’m a 38d and weigh 190.  Otherwise the dress is very flattering. The tie in the front hides a lot and the material is soft and good weight.  The color was as described.  I may return for a size up, but not sure yet."
4.0,Very stylish. Should've paid more attention to the size. Could be smaller but that's my fault. Over all very satisfied.
4.0,"For the price you cant go wrong ,comes with pouch and cleaning cloth too.."
4.0,Very cute ......for the money its worth it .....is not flimsy so it lasts
4.0,"I really wished it had pockets, u can't tell. Nice comfy material."
4.0,the frames are really white.
4.0,Loved the variety of diamond colors but the backings were a bit irritating since they are so long.
4.0,"I purchased these because I had to take my steel nipple rings out for a medical procedure.  I would buy these again. This is a good product and reasonably priced.<br /><br />Good:<br />- The bars are comfortable.  Granted, I'm used to rigid steel, but these fit in like a breeze and I've not had any issues.<br />- Good length. I got 5/6&#34;, which is standard nipple ring length. The bars fit just right.<br /><br />Bad:<br />- The balls were hard to get off the bar. I had to use my teeth to unscrew them.<br />- The balls are smaller than average.  I will be changing the balls to larger ones that come with a different pair of rings."
4.0,"I only give this dress 3 stars because of the fit. It is a very cute dress for anyone who loves Minnie Mouse or Disney, but it runs very big. These are women's sizes, not junior sizes. I typically wear a MD in juniors & I ordered this in a SM (based on the other review). Unfortunately, I wish I had ordered the XS. This dress hits me right above the knee (I'm 5&#34; 5') & the elastic band at the waist just barely touches my body (too loose). I have slight gaping at the underarms (I'm a 34D) so I think a smaller size would fit, but I haven't returned it because I'm worried that it would be TOO small. It is not cotton so it will not shrink. Other than the off sizing, this dress is PERFECT for wearing in the Disney parks! Please note:THIS DRESS HAS POCKETS!"
4.0,"Frankly, I'm just glad to finally have a pentagram necklace. Sadly, it keeps flipping around (regardless of how I put it on). The knot that tied the strig to the loop is warped, and I'm afraid to fiddle with it too much (I don't want it to break). Anyways, It came quickly, is decent sized, and hopefully the warped knot is an isolated irritation. 4 out of 5."
4.0,I absolutely loved this bag when I first received it...  after a couple of months the zipper on the inside compartment is already broken though.  I give it 5 Stars for design but 3 Stars for quality.  If you’re looking for a cute bag that you don’t expect to last long then I would say get it because it is reasonably priced.  Otherwise spend a few more dollars and get something of better quality.
4.0,"I got this for my husband for our third anniversary. He likes it a lot and uses it as his main wallet. His favorite features are the hidden pocket and RFID blocking (which he did test). He did look at the listing and said if he had picked it, he might have preferred the smaller option for thinness but likes the higher capacity as a hand off.<br /><br />I like the feel of it but hope it does soften over time, it's a little hard to remove the cards at first. I, also, expected it to be thinner but it is a pretty slim wallet."
4.0,Looks like a lightning bolt.  If you love Lightning hockey it's a cute accessory.  It fits best in smaller fingers.
4.0,I love this shirt it’s just in my opinion go up a size
4.0,"It is somewhat big, but I am using it as a nightgown on vacation so it still works for me. The arm holes go down farther than what I would be comfortable with if I was wearing it out and about, but that would have been fixed if I sized down. It is very flowy, it just depends on if you like that style or not. It is made well. I got the white and it is not see through, and is a bright white, not an off-white. For reference, I am 5'5 and 125. Probably should have gotten an XS but a small works for my purposes."
4.0,There thick which provide super support
4.0,Super cute.  The sizing runs a little big.
4.0,"Run small - I needed some compression, but not so  much that I couldn't get them on. I ordered a size larder and thay fit perfectly around my hand, but were too long for my short fingers. I folded the tips back and now they are just right."
4.0,"The quality of parts isn't amazing. For the few watch repairs I do (a couple times a year) it works perfectly. It's a great inexpensive set that will help you change bands, batteries, remove links, etc. Nothing has broke yet and to be honest I don't expect it to."
4.0,This product feels good when I have it on.
4.0,It runs small so SIZE UP ! you’ve been warned
4.0,"This sweatshirt is adorable and very budget friendly!  I adore the off the shoulder look and kangaroo pocket.  It is lightweight and not bulky.  I did need to size up to a large instead of my usual medium, however please be mindful when purchasing that the band at the bottom is probably one size too small, and is tighter fitting than the rest of the sweatshirt.  If you take that in to account when ordering it should fit well."
4.0,"Cheap, you get what you pay for but the kids love them! If you design jewelry like me you can fix the chains as needed. If you don't, don't panic, the chains are very flexible and easy to repair!"
4.0,"could no fit [[ASIN:B00M0J9V4A Shymay Women's Zipper Closure Hi-Waist Tummy Control Panties, Black, Tag size 3XL=US size Medium]]"
4.0,"Arrived earlier than originally expected. Fits great, just as described. Very cute and comfy!"
4.0,I am happy with the earrings.  One was a little bent but went right back into shape.
4.0,"These pairs of underwear fit well and the designs are cute.  I think they could be a bit softer, though my little boy thinks they are plenty comfortable."
4.0,"I really like the quality of these tanks. They look like they’re perfect for working out in (I work out frequently). I didn’t buy them for that reason though. I just had surgery and bought them because I needed something tight around my abdomen. These tanks said they were compression, so I figured I’d give them a try. These tanks are not compression like advertised. Good quality? Yes. Perfect for working out? Yes. Form-fitting? Yes. Compression? Err, not so much."
4.0,"A little on the small side, It's a hat"
4.0,It’s a little wider than I expected
4.0,I like the color and the design but I wonder what clothes goes well with this...
4.0,"Hat is wayyy too big for my son, but he'll grow into it, I guess!!"
4.0,"The shorts fit perfectly and feel great, but unfortunately I didn’t notice the stitching was starting to come undone until after I washed them and cut the tags off. I figured I don’t go swimming often so I wasn’t too worried about it, but if you’re a water bug check the stitching before you cut the tags off!"
4.0,"Everything fit great except the shoulders. The torso area and arm area was short/small. The dress itself is beautiful, and I was able to alter it a bit to feel more comfortable."
4.0,For the money - it's really quite nice! You have to be careful to twist the little flowers so they're all facing &#34;up&#34; and don't get tangled in your hair. It's really high quality for how little it costs.
4.0,"I bought one pair of these sunglasses and wore them for about a week before ordering three more pairs.<br /><br />I own Maui, Serengeti and Smith sunglasses and these sunglasses do not fit as well or feel as good but they are only $10 and I don't care if I loose them where I am always worrying about loosing my more expensive glasses.<br /><br />Overall construction is fairly good. They are solid enough that you don't worry about breaking them if you stuff them in  a backpack. They are light so you don't really feel them on your nose and the gray lenses do a good job of reducing bright sunlight.<br /><br />I am sensitive to bright lights and the lenses curve around the side enough that I don't notice bright light from the side.<br /><br />I would have given these a 5 star rating but they do not fit as well as my Smith sunglasses of the same design but they are a whole lot cheaper.<br /><br />If you're looking for an inexpensive pair of sunglasses you can't do any better than these."
4.0,"I really like that they aren't giant, my only problem is one pair of silver was missing when they arrived."
4.0,"Fabric feels good, but wrinkles easily."
4.0,I like the way it’s made.  I would like it right at the knees of a little lower. Otherwise it is SO cute.
4.0,Love the dress. Measurements did not add up. I gifted it to my niece. She looked beautiful
4.0,They can give me a headache from wearing them all day from the nose rest squeezing me but other than that they are great glasses. They’re fashionable as well
4.0,For COVID protection it too thin not safe
4.0,"really cute at a low price, went well with the look i was going for..... the chain seems cheap and fragile though."
4.0,"I like analog watches rather than digital, and I really like the design of this watch very much. One thing I do not like is that it does not have a second hand, though seconds can be checked in the small digital window. When the hands are over the digital display, it is a little hard to see through it."
4.0,Just a little too thin for my taste
4.0,"These earrings are relatively larger than expected, however, they are beautiful and sparkle a lot"
4.0,Product is bug enough for my items thanks.
4.0,My son is a huge Oregon fan and was excited about this mask for school.  The mask fits and he likes it but the delivery time was very long.
4.0,"Only time will tell, but first impressions are okay especially for the price. Wish an XS was offered as the small is on the larger side , will keep for wearing around the house."
4.0,I'
4.0,"Thought it was going to be more of a summer dress but ended up being a nighty because of the material. It's super comfy, but a little too short."
4.0,"Its a beautiful pendant and chain ,I only wish it would have been a little bigger,I received it very quickly with no problems, I received this item at a discount for my honest review,thank you."
4.0,"Shark teeth are smaller than I expected, but it still worked well for a costume."
4.0,A little cheap looking but it does the job lol
4.0,"just as it appears in the photo.  Cute, low cut, short."
4.0,My granddaughters got these for me for Christmas. They are just a tad snug but seem to be stretching a little as time passes.
4.0,"Thin fabric, you need to iron or steam this shirt every time you wear it- but the shirt itself is very cute."
4.0,"Holds everything, pretty color. Some of the pockets are really small so they can't hold anything which is annoying when you like to compartmentalize your makeup like I do."
4.0,"This is really a great bag!  I bought it to carry my Surface Pro 3 for work, since the Surface is a little too small for a traditional laptop bag, but too large for a regular purse.<br /><br />The bag is REALLY large.  Larger than what it looked like in the pictures.  When I first got the bag I was concerned about how large it was and considered returning it... but gave it a shot and am really happy with it now.  It's a bit large to carry just the Surface, but when also carrying peripherals (power cord, mouse, display adapters, etc.), notebooks and files, it's nearly perfect.  There are plenty of zippered interior pockets for storing peripherals, but I would have liked those pockets better if they were larger and went to the bottom of the bag rather than stopping halfway down.  Considering this bag wasn't really designed for how I'm using it, I guess I can't be too picky about this.<br /><br />The only other complaint I have about the bag is that the part that is folded over isn't sewn shut.  It isn't really apparent in the photos that the fold *isn't* decorative, but an actual open fold.  When I'm carrying the bag, gravity does its thing, keeps the fold closed and everything in the bag, but when it's on the floor or a table, I have to be careful that the fold stays folded, as things can spill out of the side of the bag. This isn't a huge issue, but is something you might want to be aware of before you purchase the bag.<br /><br />One good surprise is that there is a nice sized pocket on the front of the bag, where the leather strap runs across the front.  In the photos, it just looks decorative, but no, it's an actual pocket!  Yay!  This is a great place to put my keys and phone for easy access.<br /><br />I'm not sure about the other reviewer's problem with a ""bracket"" on this bag.  I don't know what ""bracket"" they are talking about.  I can say that I've had the bag for several weeks and nothing has broken on it yet.<br /><br />Over all, I'm really happy with the bag.  It could be an inch or two smaller, the fold could be sewn shut, and the designer could have taken more advantage of the space inside the bag to make the zippered pockets larger.  Each of those issues are pretty small, but added up to only four stars instead of five."
4.0,"Nice clear glasses, but fits a little tight on my head.  Bifocals are in a perfect place."
4.0,Better quality than I expected. A few of them did not fit my face correctly (eyes not lining up). Would for sure purchase again!
4.0,"The sequins are stunning, but im not sure this suit is for me. I had hoped to use it as a swim suit, but just found that the bottom part of the top was very unflattering on my body. At 40-36-44 I ordered an xxl, the spandex bottoms fit fine but the sequins have no stretch and I had trouble getting the unstretchy waist above my hips. I think this could look super cute as a halter, or worn under a skirt or pants, but then the struggle of pulling the suit over my hips would dissuade me from wearing it as a body suit. I think a xxxl would be way too large to even be flattering. I think I will look for this fabric as a halter instead of a bodysuit."
4.0,"I had been looking for a ring with dragon influenced art for awhile. I'm hard on my hands and have broken several rings with stones in the past. As a result, I need a band that sits flush and can withstand daily use and abuse. This ring is a great compromise. It has a beautiful design and the blue color is truly gorgeous. It's lightweight and comfortable to wear. I usually wear a size 6 1/2, but ordered a size 7. I'd rather a ring be a little bigger than smaller. It fits me perfect, sobi would say perhaps the bring runs a tad on the smaller side. The only complaint I do have is the design inlay on my bring isn't centered. It sits right at the top,which leaves a disproportionate amount of blue showing at the bottom. As a result, the design at the top is muddled and hard to make out in some areas."
4.0,"Cute, as represented and fit as expected. Son wore at school for birthday, subtle way to broadcast a big day!"
4.0,"The first pants I ordered were black in a large and they were way way too big. so I settled on a medium in both black and blue. The blue is smaller than the black LOL. And they do not go up to my waist, but if I scootch them down on my hips, they do fit. If I pulled them up to my waist, the crotch area would be too tight. Even the legs are a little bit tighter then the black pants but I'm slim. And I do normally wear a medium. They're very comfy though."
4.0,Nice cotton for summer
4.0,"Pretty watch....the thing is when I cut the package open, I cut the band right off!!! I couldn't believe I was so careless. The watch is very pretty and is still running even though I can't wear it. I really love the beveled face. I am so dissapointed...ugh. I will be more careful next time I bet cha!"
4.0,"Mine came all black, without the yellow lining shown.  Which is fine.  Seems to be good quality."
4.0,"The shoes looks nice and feels good. It came out to be a little big for me, but it's okay. I haven't got a chance to wear it in deep snow yet, because since I ordered it the snow has melted outside. Nevertheless, I like these shoes."
4.0,"Nice , I just wish it was a little larger"
4.0,"The shirt runs true to size, and is a very comfortable shirt that I would definitely buy again, overall great product and great price!"
4.0,Looks funny if you're chubby and 5'1&#34; like me. I have to wear it with a jacket thing. Good quality.
4.0,"i ordered the skirt (XL) and use it as a tennis skirt. it looked cute and it is. however, i find extra large skirts in general are too long.  i wear the skirt over pocket leggings and cut 3.5"" off the length of the skirt. i hope that makes sense."
4.0,"Very breathable and stretchy fabric. Sizing is a little off. Arms seem to be extra long. Light blue is a beautiful baby blue. Overall, nice shirt, would purchase again."
4.0,cute mask but the blue jewels started falling off as soon as the mask came our of the package.
4.0,Got a 3xxxl but noway it is try it on fell like a large in kids size but it looks nice
4.0,Kind of cheaply made but of course since they were only 10$!!  I think they are super cute though. I feel like I’ll havs to be very careful with the bow
4.0,It’s a little small in the chest area. Otherwise it is as described. :)
4.0,Very nice tie for the price.  Great deal.  Looked great with my tux.  Thanks.
4.0,Very careful package. Fits perfectly. You need to use the measurements to find your size.
4.0,A little odd with the zipper pull being on the opposite side that I am used to.
4.0,Good casual dress!
4.0,These are good for cold feet but they wear out easily.
4.0,"This is an oversized dress. I ordered an XL, thinking that would fit perfectly as this is from china, but no, its true to size. I'm 5'11, 150 lbs, and an XL was way too large."
4.0,I got these shoes for a Las Vegas trip. I wore them all night walking the strip and dancing at clubs. I normally wear a 6 - 6.5 size shoe so I ordered the 6.5. They fit but were a bit tight. The zipper  does rub the back of your heel. Do not wear these without a band-aid or moleskin or you are sure to get blisters. Otherwise they are super comfy and easy to walk in! Definitely worth the price!
4.0,The color is fantastic. An almost florescent purple that pops and improves the presence of my faded purple Les Paul. It’s padded but I still need more padding to hold up the “beast” after an hour.
4.0,"Nice shirt, it has a good flow. It is a little bit see through because of the thin material."
4.0,price and navy blue
4.0,Too big but cute af!
4.0,"This band is beautiful and the magnets are powerful and stay put. The only down side, for me, was it was slightly too big for my wrist with no way to make it smaller. That was the only downside to this band. Otherwise it is amazing!"
4.0,They work but the angles are limited and they do feel cheap. Get what you pay for
4.0,"Easy on the eyes , not too dark. Beacause of uv protection it makes it a little difficult to see the phone screen"
4.0,This hat will definitely keep the sun off of your face. It was well worth the price and is pacakable for traveling.
4.0,"The design is not gray, it is white."
4.0,I wish I can get those frames for my birthday I really like them the color is awesome if the designer can make me a deal for Cyber Day I would buy them in a heart beat if the price is right...😘🙏
4.0,The ban is stiff and uncomfortable
4.0,"Fit perfectly I’m usually size L-XL, 10-12. Only thing was the slit was a little higher than appropriate for a school uniform so I had to safety pin it. Also, you’ll want to wear maybe a white tube top or bandeau underneath the top because if you lift your arms it will expose your best a bit especially if you have a larger cheat.<br /><br />The belt was very flimsy quality so you may wanna replace it with a sturdier white belt. The scarf is good but if you want a better look I’d separately order something thicker and less thin/shiny. More realistic looking. Overall though, great cosplay for what I needed it for (Anime Convention) and came quickly. Fabric quality is good. I recommend it!"
4.0,No tilt
4.0,I love this dress it’s a little snug and see-through but I think I will manage. It’s flattering and flowy.
4.0,Fits good. And comfortable
4.0,Worked great! Stayed on for hours even though it was super humid.
4.0,color on trim was not what I expected but still looks good.
4.0,"It's soft and comfortable, but shorter than I was expecting."
4.0,my daughter wears a size 5 or 6 right now depending on the shoe so I thought these would be fine but they are very hard to get on and are definitely more like a 4/5 instead of a 5/6. sort of disappointed about the size issue but they are super cute. they have an inch of foam on the bottom which leans to one side when worn.
4.0,Very cute! A little hard to get on and off though
4.0,It is great but the leather is a little poor quality. Definitely good for the price
4.0,This is a fun  dress. I love the print. dress is long  for me. It  does show your  lumps so  you my need to wear an supportive  undergarment
4.0,Wow very cool I can't wait to show it off
4.0,Its a cute dress. The fabric feels great. It is somewhat see through though. You'll been a strapless bra or slip or petals for coverage.
4.0,"I gave this as a gift.  It was well received by the recipient.  Colors were bright, yarns were soft and designs were whimsical."
4.0,"Cute bows with a great variety of colors! I would've given them five stars but I had a couple of them come apart on me. It's nothing a little fabric glue can't fix though. For being so inexpensive, they're definitely worth purchasing."
4.0,This product really defines your waist.  I give  it 4 of 5 stars because I have yet to figure out how to get rid of the rubber smell.  👍🏼👍🏼
4.0,"They're okay. A lot of them the jewel is kinda big so pops out which i dont like. I like the variety tho which is why i bought a ""lot"" that had many pieces. Nice variety of colors and pieces, i wont use almost all the hoops because theyre so big. But for the price,  ill get my moneys worth out of some."
4.0,"The build and materials are good, and I like the look of this bag.  I just wish it fit some of the stuff I wanted to use a little better.  There are spaces to stow straps and a luggage strap on the back would help for travelers (whoever does that these days, I'm sorry).<br /><br />The front compartment has a series of organizers which might be useful if you were to keep pens and other small items in it.<br /><br />For the inside, it's got a smooth but not soft lining.  I would not worry about it scratching anything but it doesn't feel as luxurious as what you find in a lot of comparable sleeves."
4.0,"I really do like this.  I bought it to get a lightweight litter that would clump.  My husband complains it doesn't smell as good as the last clumping litter, so I cover the bottom of the box with deodorizing powder and put a few drops of lavender every few days, with that we're good.<br />NO problem with dust as others complained, really no complaints, will keep buying it and we've been using it for 6 months or so already."
4.0,"These were a Christmas gift. A little long for my grandson, but it's ok."
4.0,"Wish they were a little longer so that they go over your calf to prevent them from sliding down toward your ankle. Otherwise, how you gonna see “techno” clearly?"
4.0,"I was looking for a pair of workout shorts with a pocket for my phone, and these seemed like they might work. I like the high waist, which means I can pull the shorts up over my stomach and the waistband does not dig into my waist. The shorts do have a big pocket that easily fits my phone. The fabric is thin and breathable and seem more or less euivalent to other similar shorts I have purchased. They seem to be put together well enough, and are at least of reasonable uality. I can't speak to how they will hold up over time, but they work for my purposes.<br /><br />These run small. So, order a size up."
4.0,It was a little larger than I expected but I still really like it.
4.0,It’s cute & definitely fun - If I was a little more in shape I would probably love this set
4.0,"Comfortable, cute, and great for the price!!!"
4.0,So this became my favorite boot ..  At 1st I wanted to send them back due to how uncomfortable they are .. But I really liked the boot ..  I mean it looks incredible to me .. So after a while of debating to send them back or not I realized the only problem was the Insole need to be changed out .. Change the insoles out to a more comfortable one you will not regret it
4.0,Ordered a small. Just ordered another in xs because small fits like a medium. I’m 5 foot 3 113 lbs athletic build. Going to compare both.
4.0,"This is fun, kind of occult looking costume. It's well made, nothing falls off. Great price."
4.0,"I bought this hat as part of a Halloween costume because it looks like the one Hugh wears.  The pipe is a mini toy pipe.  Buy a separate normal size pipe to make the look more realistic.  One of the black rivets fell off of the side of my hat when I was taking it out of the packaging.  I'll glue that back on.  It doesn't have a good shape right out of the bag. I think I will get it wet and then stretch it over the bottom of a bucket to dry. That should get it to hold a better shape.  Yes it is cheap, but not horrible."
4.0,"The bathing suit is of good quality and the measurements are accurate until you get to the breast area. I am a 40DD, and these cups are a C at best. The is my only gripe, and I am sad about it, because the suit is very nice looking and flattering."
4.0,"Adorable, true to size."
4.0,I like the design very much it did look very good on my doughter she is slim and she is 10 years old and i had to order size 8 on this it did worked perfect .but only thing the quality of the dress is not that good .but over all i was happy with it because she only wore it once as a flower gril and i had to use steamer .
4.0,Love these boots for my little guy! He’s 2 and he can pull these on so easily and they’re short so he can still run in them. The only drawback is that they stained quickly/easily so they are no longer that bright red.
4.0,"These shorts are super comfy, I literally could wear them everyday! The only reason I took off a star is I wish the belly band came up a little higher, it sits right on the middle of the belly"
4.0,"The zipper seams to catch, but maybe it is because its so new.  Ill update after I have used it a while."
4.0,"Really cute but runs too small, I usually wear size small but got medium to be safe because of the reviews, and it was still too small"
4.0,Very lightweight and comfortable. Exactly what I was looking for!
4.0,Nice eyewears
4.0,Little big but still very cute
4.0,Funky shades for trendy looks. They are very solid feeling not flimsy. I wish they had come with the peel off protective film because the case is like a felted wool and fibers stuck to them requiring thorough cleaning before use.
4.0,"Product description says order one size bigger because they run small, but that was too big. I returned that one and ordered my regular size (13) and they're a little snug, but they fit. They appear to be well made and I look forward to wearing them. I just received them, so while they appear durable, I can't speak to the issue of durability with any authority. The lining is certainly soft and warm!"
4.0,My daughter likes these and they hold up well considering she puts holes in the knees of all her pants. Have to wear solid undies though. Any kind of print can be seen through the pants.
4.0,"Our son liked the watch but said it was for a woman and that he had to use the last notch, therefore no lap-over and just about fit.  He will use until he buys another himself.  It met all his requirements, except fit.  Thus the 4 stars."
4.0,Love it. It compliments my coach handbag perfectly.
4.0,It’s a thicker material and it runs a bit big.<br />I’m 5’3 so it was long but most things are on me.
4.0,Perfect summer pants.
4.0,I received my earrings and have had them on since I received them.  I love the fact that they are black.<br /><br />Thank you
4.0,Very nice charm! Fits my Pandora bracelet very well.<br /><br />Kiki G.
4.0,"I ordered Medium based on other reviews. I am 5'7"" 163lbs. I returned because the slit was up to my hoohoo and showed the leg of my spanx. There is no way I could wear without spanx and I didnt want to spend extra money on a bodysuit. So I decided to return it for now but saved a Large in my cart for later if the occasion arises. The pink is a Dusty Nude Pink. The bust is lined. I wish the whole dress was!"
4.0,"The material, fit, and especially price were so good, I almost doubted my good fortune!"
4.0,Fits as expected. Drawstrings on the side work as shown in photo.
4.0,"Very soft and comfortable, but runs a little small."
4.0,Nice 3 pieces for the price colors are perfect.<br />Not sure how long the elastic will hold out but i am happy with the purchase
4.0,Very cute tie! Was perfect and just what you’d expect!
4.0,"This is a well-made bifold wallet.  The leather looks, feels and smells the way it should.<br /><br />Things I like:  It holds all my credit cards, licenses, membership cards, etc.  The clear plastic ID window is two-sided, one side for my driver's license the other for the credit card I use the most.  (The separate window prevents tap-to-pay devices from reading the wrong card, which has happened more than once when cards are too close together.) The cloth lining makes it easy to slide out cards when I need them.<br /><br />Things I don't like:  Like most wallets with flip-out ID windows, it isn't particularly thin.  Of course, that is largely due to the fact that I carry around too many cards.<br /><br />Things I don't know:  I don't know how long this wallet will last.  I'll update my review if there are any durability issues."
4.0,The bag is definitely  cute and for 20$ is  exactly  the size I wanted the reason I gave it four stars is because the purse itself when you open is has a bad smell to it I'm giving it a chance to air out hoping it will go away soon.
4.0,Worked great for my Hippie costume
4.0,very pretty dress and looks very elegant! I wore this for a bridal shower. I ordered a size L and I am a 34 D about 140lbs
4.0,"Very well made, pretty"
4.0,"Worked well on long flight to Peru.  Rather thick sock so won't fit in all shoes.  I wore sneakers w/no problem.  I had to order XL for my long legs, but my shoe size didn't match. Too large, but I made it work.  Good for travel."
4.0,I get a lot of compliments on this skirt for the great pattern and colors but I think the pleats are a little awkward and I wish it moved /laid on the body better. I like it enough to wear repeatedly but can't give it 5 stars.
4.0,"This top is SO cute! I love it with skinny jeans and leggings. I do recommend sizing up a couple sizes though...especially if you like your tops to fit loose. I normally wear a Small. I ordered a Medium and, while I'm happy with the fit, I think a Large would have been perfect.<br /><br />Do be advised though...the flower pattern on the pocket and down the sleeves does vary. The photo shows a lot of flowers on both, however on the top I received, the pocket is almost completely white, with just the hint of a leaf in the bottom left corner, and the stripes going down the sleeves are almost all white as well. Not the end of the world, but a bit disappointing."
4.0,"This is adorable on; the front has a ""pouch"" like pucker... i am 5'6'' 135."
4.0,Great! I recolored them though~ That was my whole purpose anyway for them
4.0,Got this for my niece who is obsessed with Ugly Dolls and it was a total success. And they're super cute too
4.0,Love these shirts will buy again
4.0,"Received in two weeks with normal shipping.<br />I ordered the Princess Lolita style. I am very small, 110 lbs, 5'7&#34;. the lingerie fits fine except that it is too short. The skirt hits me just below my belly button instead of at my hips."
4.0,This is a Anti Venom Qwen cosplay. Looks really good and is true to size neck area is tight because the mask and body suit overlap each other. The butt area is somewhat see through if you got a booty so make sure you have proper underwear
4.0,"Sized up on this for my husband (usually wears an XL, ordered a XXL) and it fits perfectly. The design is stylish and it's comfortable. The fabric is a bit stiff and it came extremely wrinkled. Easy to steam out wrinkles but when my husband wears it, every time he sits it creases and looks wrinkled again. Not a big deal at all just something to keep in mind!"
4.0,It is comfortable even with my Apple Watch on the same wrist.  Only reason I decreased 1 star is because the white thread is showing after a week of wear. It's not a deal breaker and I still wear it often.
4.0,Liked the shirt but runs small
4.0,"I immediately liked the material for the color, thickness, feel and weight. It feels wonderful on the skin and is very comfortable. It has the perfect amount of stretch. I was just hoping it would be a bit better fitting without being cinched. It's a little too big, unflattering that way. When it's cinched, it does look better. I got a small and it doesn't come in extra small. I'm 5'9"", 130#."
4.0,The pouch makes you look pregnant so I wouldn't wear it without an animal in there but I can't wait to get my new kitty. It will be awesome to put her in there& carry her around the house
4.0,"Very elegant shirt, and I love the color I chose. The inner lining is soft and silky, and the lace is delicate looking but durable. I've machine washed this shirt with the rest of my laundry at least a dozen or so times, and the lace hasn't frayed yet. I wish I could wear this shirt more often, unfortunately I live in AZ and it's definitely a warmer shirt (being a layer of decently thick lining and the lace) that I only get to trot out when winter rolls around. Due to the double layers and the material, it's a bit uncomfortable to wear the shirt with the sleeves rolled up to your elbows. This typically isn't a problem for longer than it takes me to wash my hands, but just something to keep in mind if you live somewhere that it's cold in the morning/evenings and warm/sunny in the afternoon. Unless you are comfortable going braless or having straps showing, this shirt requires a strapless bra."
4.0,"Bought these to wear at Disney. The princesses look a little off, but still cute and my girls love them!"
4.0,Neck area stretched out
4.0,"I have purchased several of these shirts and I always end up with the same issue, they are rather short, not sure why that is considering it’s from the U.K. and people there are slim and tall. The color and the design are always great though"
4.0,"Had for a few months now. Use it everyday as purse and to hold files for work. Stills looks brand new. Stands on own, when I don't overload it. Handles are holding up beautifully,  no cracks. Just wish it was a little roomier. So 4 instead of 5 stars. Definitely would not hold a full size laptop, but large tablet size fits fine."
4.0,product received as expected.
4.0,"I am size 16 and this is snug.  It  rides up a little because it is snug so I definitely need to wear leggings or skinny pants with it.  That being said, I do like it a lot."
4.0,Did not like that the first time I wore it the material ripped by the waistline (couldn't return out of return period) but I added a wide belt and it turn out ok.
4.0,"Nice assortment of colorful 65% cotton, 30% nylon and 5% rubber headbands.  They are thick and absorbent, but I can still out sweat these.  They wash well, but don't dry them because they are a little on the tight side."
4.0,"I like these slipper/socks because my daughter is standing all the time and we have wood floors. This means that she has a heck of a time getting traction. With these she has no problem standing. They are helping her shuffle around with the help of furniture as well. They are also great for crawling because then her toes don't get all red. My only complaint is that they are kind of heavy, so it was a little awkward for my daughter when we first put these on."
4.0,This wallet looks good and has a lot of compartments including zipped area for coins. The zipper can be a little tricky to get started which is why I returned the first one I bought. This second one seems to work better but you still have to work the zipper a little at the start.  I love the fact that all documents fit in one place -- for one or more people.
4.0,love these outfits
4.0,"Great shirt! The sides of mine poke out a little at the bottom like the shirt is stiff instead of sitting flat on my hips. Whatever though, nice color. I am 131 lbs, 36 B, 5'2 and I ordered a small and it fits loosely perfectly. It is how you would want a shirt to fit haha."
4.0,"This is one adorable little jewelry box. I purchased it before leaving for a month to go visit family in Italy.<br />I chose it over other jewelry boxes because it has a divisor that works as an earring holder, which I find very clever. I wish it had more holes, since there is plenty of space, and I might ask my husband to drill some more since it doesn't seem to be to difficult (after all it's only a thick paper covered in suede.)<br />The necklace holders are brilliant: I can finally take more than a necklace with me without having to worry about them getting tangled to each other.<br />I have only two complaints: one is the zipper, which doesn't run very smoothly, and the other one is the color choice, which is very limited. I got the pearl-like color in PU leather and it feels and looks a little cheap; I would definitely prefer a solid color fabric.<br />Other than that, it's a very cute box and it holds lots of jewelry - especially if you are more of a minimalistic style person like me; my necklaces and rings are very minute and dainty. If you wear mostly statement pieces this might not be enough for you and you would be better off with a bigger box.<br />Good product at a very competitive price."
4.0,love this ring looks and fell like the real thing
4.0,The material is soft and comfortable. Easy fluid fit. I intentionally bought one size up so dresses wouldn't cling on me. Fits beautifully. I like it alot.
4.0,"This review is for a set of two pairs of sunglasses.  The package contains one little bag, one cleaning cloth, two pairs of glasses, and two head straps.  The glasses are good.  They have very large, adjustable nose pads.  This keeps the glasses a bit away from your cheeks and away from your eyes.  The part that goes behind your ears are straight, and do not push in very much on my head (I think my head is pretty average size), so if I put them on, lean over and shake my head they will fall off.  When you put the head strap on them, the part that goes over the ear part is a very flexible rubber, so when that is on it goes grip pretty well on your hair.  If you tighten up the head strap it also keeps it in place.<br /><br />I also noticed that they are not that dark.  I don't need dark, dark glasses, but put these on in my dark basement and had no problem seeing.  With a normal pair, I would not be able to get around.  So these would be good if you were inside and outside, but outside in the sun might not provide enough darkening as would be my desire.  They are plastic and so far are holding up, but do feel a bit cheap.<br /><br />They will work, just wish that they stayed on my head without the head strap on, and were a bit darker, but other than that, they should hold up well."
4.0,Gave as a Christmas present to a 14yr. Old and she loved it! So far so good with quality. Super cute too!
4.0,Fit both myself and my 10 year old. Nice quality. Daughter says they're itchy (even after washing).
4.0,"Bought according to size chart, did not fit as well as I thought it should."
4.0,Tight but ok
4.0,"Beautiful dress, worth the money. Color was off so can’t use it for family photos but too nice for $ to send back!"
4.0,"Small, but still cute and holds a good amount of buttons and pins."
4.0,"This necklace is rather pretty!<br />The fairy at the top leaves a lot to be desired when you flip it over, but this would make a great pre-teen gift."
4.0,Love the outfit ! Unfortunately it's way too big for my son to use. Will have to save it for a couple months
4.0,ok so far
4.0,"Overall, extremely satisfied with my purchase. I adore bamboo socks. I get very clay feet and these are the best at keeping my feet dry.<br /><br />On a side note, I was pretty heartbroken when I put on a brand new pair and they had a hole where the seam meets at the ankle. It made me pretty upset because these socks are not cheap.<br /><br />I'm a fan otherwise."
4.0,So cute and so far the durability has been good. Wen through as checked baggage. Lots of room inside.
4.0,"The fabric is soft and stretchy.  It is like the photo.  It's just really unflattering.  If it was a maternity dress it would be adorable but just not right for me.  I was hoping to wear to work as a teacher and although it's school appropriate it's super boring.  I'm not returning it but it will be for Saturdays on the couch or pajamas, not for work.  For reference I usually wear a women's 10 and this is a size medium."
4.0,Can't really review at this time. Bought this as a gift
4.0,Seems to run small but very warm
4.0,2 little.
4.0,"Good shirt, bright colors and good printing,  does run small though."
4.0,i love how vibrant it is. perfect accessory for my car keys
4.0,kinda cheep but  good color selection
4.0,"I like the concept.  I like the utility enough that I purchased another one, this time in black fiber.  My only criticism is that the &#34;gold&#34; is a kind of paint or plating that is too light, looks cheap, and scratches very easily.  The black carbon fiber one gets all 5 stars."
4.0,It was good just did not like it
4.0,Nice and comfy. Great to wear to bed or lounge around the house.
4.0,Material not really silky as expected
4.0,And a good size unlike the traditional narrow burp clothes.
4.0,"Really like it.  Somewhat tight, but it's ok - kept it anyway."
4.0,Very nice shoes but small my daughter wears 10 and this fits like 9. Thats why give it 4 stars and return
4.0,It looks really cute on my boys! But they start getting fussy if I let them wear too long. I guess they are not that comfortable
4.0,"A little too long for me, I'm 5'6"". Love the pockets. Would be flattering if it was knee length or shorter."
4.0,bought this for my niece.  Seems very well made and the details are great.  she loved it
4.0,"Super cute, does run short!"
4.0,"Don’t think the AN KINGPiiN Men's lapel pin is only for the guys. This line of pins is very suitable for the ladies, too. The back will clip on to a scarf, a baseball style cap, a sling handbag or most anything you want to dress up a bit with some costume jewelry. These are not high end Kardashian style but they’re fun little statement pieces.<br /><br />This is a cute peach, black & orange topiary style stickpin. Stick pins began as a utilitarian neck-ware controlling device worn by English gentlemen to secure the folds of their cravats.  Of course you can wear it strictly as a fun fashion statement."
4.0,"Great little bag, kids love them. Fits a standard iPad and also a Fire 10 fine."
4.0,"Love these boots!  Very stylish and the color is exactly what I wanted.  Ordered large/wide calf, but apparently should not have.  Boot is VERY loose in the calf area.  Still good for wearing with jeans though.  Definitely keeping and will wear with jeans."
4.0,A bit too thin of material otherwise I like it.
4.0,"I have not worn these shoes yet, however they look and feel very nice."
4.0,Not flattering what so ever but who cares. If it’s super hot out and you’re wearing a swimsuit
4.0,"nice fit overall , waistband rather thin..."
4.0,Good for the price. Warm.
4.0,These socks are very comfortable. Wash well & fit great.  Thinner than Athletic socks.
4.0,"purchased for trip to india, most of th airlines there have narrow aisles, this bag easily wheeled side ways down the aisles. Fit in overhead in al small planes. Only downside, the bag does not extend at all. the outside pocket leaves little room for anything but a notebook or one folded shirt."
4.0,Too sheer for me. I live with my grandson.
4.0,Nice for the price but I wish the fish was an inch smaller.  The fish is so big.  I guess  should of paid more attention to the item description.
4.0,"Really good costume! Fit was a little bigger than I wanted, but I have a larger chest and didn’t want it to be too skimpy up top. (5’5”, 150, 34D) I ended up removing the chest padding and needing to use longer clear straps, but worked really well overall and was highly complimented. The little shorts underneath are clever with the sequin placement and made me feel less self conscious about the slit. The gloves are great too, but they are provably only single-wear as they got really snagged by the sequins."
4.0,Nice bracelet I would definitely get it again
4.0,"I read reviews saying it is meant to be loose, so I sized down to get a more fitted look. I received many compliments about the shirt, but I did find the shirt a little short. I am petite with a shorter torso, so it was not a problem for me, but someone who is taller may find this shirt a bit on the shorter side. Other than that, it is very comfortable and the pearls really pop against the green."
4.0,Provides far better terminal protection than flat washer type.  Worth the extra cost.
4.0,very nice watch for its price... the glass scratches way too easily though... other than that no complaints!
4.0,Fit my blaze. Material is a little stiff but nice colors.
4.0,Love this show but unfortunately it was too small/tight for my son surprising b/c he’s a 6/7 in crocs
4.0,Too large for a cosmetic bag.
4.0,good for kid..play lighting
4.0,The product came really early to that was good but after a few weeks of using the product the pom came of I had to stitch it back together everything else was amazing.
4.0,"These seem like decent socks, but they don’t seem like your typical wool sock. They’re looser for starters, where other wool socks I’ve owned have had a tighter fit. They’re also not terribly thick. They keep my feet warm while I’m around my house, but I’m not sure they’d be something I’d wear for prolonged outdoor exposure in winter temperatures. The colors are cute, without being loud, and they are cozy."
4.0,"This hat fits a little on the small side. The ponytail holes are well placed. When I tried it on with my hair down, it wouldn’t really stay on my head. The ear flaps cover most of my ears but not all the way. I’m not sure how well this would hold up to being sweated in. Fabric seems like it will keep parts of your head that it covers nice and warm! Taking a star away due to it fitting a little on the small side."
4.0,Butt doesn't line up quite right but very hot.
4.0,Bought these for my daughter. They do run somewhat small. I was expecting a little more room.
4.0,"I love these pants, so comfy and soft. I love that I can wear them as pants or pull the elastic up and wear them as capris. I was disappointed that they shrunk in length after one wash."
4.0,"Love the band. Easy to use & looks great. Only complaint is that it snags on clothing. I wore a new shirt while wearing this band & after 2 hours, I had to take off my watch because my shirt was full of pulls. My new shirt now looks old."
4.0,Very pretty it could be a little longer but it looks good
4.0,Runs a little big but just like the picture
4.0,"The product is very cute, nice quality amd material. However, if you have along torso this may not be the bathing suit for you.."
4.0,nice watch band
4.0,Hoping the child will like it.
4.0,Nice looking band. Has unique styling and flair.
4.0,Its okay was hoping it would be like sock compressions. not much support.
4.0,I like the look of it! However one strap comes loose easy from it bracket
4.0,Purchased for a comedy show and received compliments from many individuals. The blue was just as vibrant in person as online. As we know that’s not always the case when purch apparel online.<br />Will consider other colors for future events!!
4.0,pretty much exactly what i expected. the material was a little thin though.
4.0,They run a little small but it's so amazing to actually have camisoles with the bra inside.
4.0,I love the jacket but after a month the front zipper broke. Living in mn I really need it to zip up. So that really upset me.
4.0,This was a little smaller than  i expected but it still fit.  I love this color the mossy green can go with almost anything perfect for layering. The fabric is thin and comfortable. It is breathable and I really love the neckline it perfect not to low and not to high.  I like that they aren't to stretchy the keep there fitted look and wash and dry nicely. As a mom who likes layers for nursing a thin comfortable tank top is a must! overall its another great piece for a diverse wardrobe. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
4.0,These are comfortable and a little stretchy.  However the fringe is a little longer than I'd like and can become annoying in the chub rub department.
4.0,"Love the look of this swimsuit and was so happy to order it.  I listened to other reviews and ordered a 3xl (I am a size 14, 5'6&#34;).  It is a little snug, but will suffice.  Can't wait to wear it on vacation!!!<br /><br />**I received this product at a discounted rate or for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I hope this review will be helpful to others, please click helpful button if my review indeed helped you out. Thank you! 👍"
4.0,A little small but I can work with it.
4.0,"The shirt was well made and exactly as shown in the picture. The only reason why I'm giving it four stars is that I bought it for a breast cancer fundraiser and the shipping was delayed, so it arrived too late"
4.0,Bands run small
4.0,Thick like a sweatshirt but the look is more glossy. Super cute on. Runs small. I’m 5’2” 185 and extra large is a little snug.
4.0,"Like the earrings, they are light, love the tortoise designs. This color ""green is hard to fine!"
4.0,It’s very sturdy and beautiful dragonflies. The inside liner isn’t connected to the shell very good.
4.0,"For less than $15, these are 100% worth it. Sure the lenses aren't top tier and the fit is generic but they look better than ok and the 1.25 magnification is correct. The focal length seems to be from about 1' to 2'... Better for computers and ok for reading a book. The yellow tint is soft and subtle. Spot on for my taste.  Why not five stars?  They aren't perfect but they ARE very good."
4.0,Love the look so I purchased two. One for my daughter and one for myself not knowing if she would like it or not because our tastes are so different but even with that we both loved it
4.0,A little dull but pretty
4.0,"I expected the straps to be longer, but it's still usable and awesome! I am definitely gonna use it as my new purse!"
4.0,"I've only worn these a couple time so far but I like them.  I got them one size larger than I need because I wanted  them to wear OVER my thin e-tip gloves, and they work well for this.  When I wear my e-tip gloves underneath these, and flip the mittens overtop my fingers, they are really warm on a cold day.  On warmer days I wear these convertible gloves alone.  Knitted wrist keeps cold air out nicely.  My only complaint is that when worn fingerless, the glove covers only up to my first knuckle - leaving most of my finger bare (this is usually the case with fingerless gloves but I'm not sure why they are designed this way when I only need my fingerTIPs bare.)"
4.0,To hold my passport and it holds my passport
4.0,Not a bad pair of hoops. They are a little heavy and the raw edge pinches my neck but they are fashionable and functional- I can sleep in these and know that they will still be there in the morning and they don't stick me in the head like posts normally do.
4.0,"I’m a sunglasses junky and I have pairs priced from $200 to $20. For $19 these are better than expected and a lot comes with them. I was able to swap to the dark polarized lens pretty easily. You could use them for cycling but I prefer Oakleys for that. I got them for when I’m driving our boat to keep the wind out of my eyes. They’re huge, wrap-around and cover a large portion of my face which is what I was looking for. I use them while we’re underway and once we’re to our fishing spot I switch to some Maui Jims. So for my very specific and special need they’re working but for cycling and fishing I go high-end."
4.0,this item is cute. but thats all it is cute. i thought it would be a little bigger. gave it to my grandaughter thats 11 years old.  it works for her..  i will purchase bigger ones for me.
4.0,Too see though. Thought they were heavier material.
4.0,Great pins
4.0,Just as pictured. Long beautiful and stay in well. Would recommend
4.0,I would say this is a beautiful product. The receiver seemed very happy and immediately put the necklace on the chain is just a tiny bit delicate.
4.0,It is pretty and size was correct.  But not very sterdy / strong for the price.<br /><br />I expected the band to be more solid
4.0,I make jewelry and these are perfect!
4.0,It's really nice. The material is Ok. Maybe the shoe cover could be made with other material... it does not look as normal boots
4.0,VERY PRETTY AND LIGHTWEIGHT BUT IT IS ADVERTISED AS LEATHER AND ITS MORE LIKE A FOAM KIND OF FEELING
4.0,"Even though I recieved this product for free, this is my honest opinion and experience with this product.<br /><br />Fit slightly tight around the thighs if you are a little more gifted in that department look elsewhere. But comfortable material and seem to be holding strong against me and my partner, we both enjoy these.<br /><br />Other than the slight tightness around the thighs, they are wonderful."
4.0,"Beautiful tie, I just found the material to be a touch on the stiff side for my tastes."
4.0,"Good value, good party gift for kids."
4.0,"Its like, U see it and wud utter wow the next. For the price, the material of the tie is nice, it looks rich, not a hard work to tie him up. And my 2yr old looked like a big boy in his white shirt and blue jean and in a RED tie. Everyone appreciated how kool he looked with that tie,  it definitely made a big difference. But downside, the tie clip looks flimsy, one pull by my boy, it opened."
4.0,It looks good very well-crafted that's good it's just awesome I've ordered them before and they were not very good
4.0,"Very impressed with glasses, fast shipping and can't wait to wear them on the boat in the wind"
4.0,The bra fit as expected. I used third love to get a better sizing. So far so comfortable. Reviews compared them to Victoria secret. I would agree with that. My only problem is I would NOT call them push up. Disappointed in that aspect!
4.0,The earrings where a good size and looked wonderful.
4.0,Very pretty dress. Was glad to see when it arrived that there was no seam line down the middle of the back and it’s soft and flowy. I’m 5’8 170 38D went with L and it fits well
4.0,"The bracelet is very pretty. So small I thought the box only had paper in it and no bracelet. MUCH smaller than I expected. My main issues were with the box, 1. had a difficult time opening it. 2. And Merry Christmas written on the box!!?? Really? This is NOT a Christmas gift, why assume it is? This part really irritated me. I now need to find a pretty box."
4.0,"Great to hold cards, cash, and passport. Unfortunately the one vertical by the business card/ID pockets is SLIGHTLY too small to fit the width of most boarding passes.. and I've flown on 15 different airlines.."
4.0,As soon as my granddaughter put the shoes on the Velcro on one of the straps came unsewed and came off. I am going to have to repair it.
4.0,"Very sturdy, so much more than expected. Had trouble having my water bottle in there. Need to play around with it to get a better feel."
4.0,Awesome looking dress.
4.0,"It was exactly what I expected, very comfortable."
4.0,"product is heavy and long, and great - so far; and does not run small as someone suggested, (should have ordered my size)"
4.0,"SO SEE THROUGH<br /><br />I had to buy those silicone nipple covers to wear it, but it was super cute once I figured that part out."
4.0,Broke after a month but easily fixed and I left it on in the shower.
4.0,"Extremely thin. Overall very cute. I received compliments throughout the entire flight. It does have a biy of extra material in the front, the grandpa pouch area🤷🏿‍♀️"
4.0,"I wanted a neck gaiter for my kids to wear instead of a mask for COVID protection, but all the adult size gaiters would not stay up.  These are very soft and fit my 10 and 13 year old pretty well.  They are very simple cuts of a thin, soft material with unhemmed edges.  Not sure if they're worth the cost."
4.0,The varying sizes was a nice bonus. My friends and I were all able to make use of these for our Punk girl look. The lip ring was probably the least user friendly.
4.0,Great jacket/sweater.
4.0,"My wife ordered this watch for me and I was exited as I had it in my wish list. The watch felt and looked great when I opened it. It had some weight to it and seemed to be a good sturdy watch, I set the time and with in the first 2 hours it was 15 minutes behind, but i had taken it off for a bit to, This watch does look and feel great, It is a watch you have to wear for it to work though, It kept OK time if I put it on and kept it on all day. If you are willing to wear the watch all day and set the time each day its a nice watch."
4.0,"I wear a 10.5 - 11 and I ordered the 12 based on the reviews. 12 fit perfect, so bump up a size.  Other than that, are warm and comfortable shoes!"
4.0,Great set of wristbands cool design.
4.0,Great purse for going to amusement park or trying h to travel light but not an everyday purse like me who hoards so much in there purse. Design is beautiful! And love how it matches my travel bag!
4.0,Very heavy earrings so not for the weak-lobed. Cute and rockabilly
4.0,"Thin material but fits very cute.  Not sure how I'll wear a bra under it, but I really like the cut of it."
4.0,"Although it is a little large around the waist, I like it and intend to keep. I love the color &amp; the style of the dress. The fabric is light weight which works for the summer."
4.0,Its a little bigger than i like and a little on the heavy side.well made and i love the colors on it.wallet is great .
4.0,"I was disappointed by the colors. I thought they were navy and red, but they are royal blue and orange. So it doesn’t match my son’s hat as well as I hoped.  It’s definitely soft and comfortable."
4.0,"These are super small, the seller made it right and I’m very happy with the refund"
4.0,"Classic, Modern design, black/silver display makes for easy reading of time.Excellent timekeeper to boot!"
4.0,The top has a worn look to it and is a little thin for winter wear without  layering it. I was hoping it would be a little  more baggy and longer like it is In the picture.
4.0,nice i love it
4.0,"So happy I bought these earrings.  Very fine artistry and beauty for any occasion.  The size is just right.  Though they appear a wee bit fragile,  I won't worry about that and avoid napping when wearing them!  Recommended.  No problems with shipping."
4.0,"I absolutely love wallets. I have more wallets than purses which for a girl I think is a little different. Most girls have more purses than wallets but not me. Depending on where I go or travel to I often change my purse to accommodate the place. I have a range of small to large as well as skinny to fat wallets.<br /><br />This wallet is big but skinny so even though it can hold a lot of items it will not take up a lot of space in your purse. This wallet is perfect for traveling since it can hold your passport, id, credit cards, and other travel documents. It even has a slot for a key and a pen which is great. This wallet is rfid blocking which is awesome to have. In today’s society technology is advancing so fast that it makes it easier for thieves to steal your information. Now a days you can pay for purchases without swiping your card and by simply putting your card on top or near card readers. This is pretty scary to think of and this is why this rfid wallet comes in handy.<br /><br />The wallet itself is kind of like a clutch purse and looks really nice. The only thing I would recommend is making the material itself a little better. The material feels a little on the cheap side and if they were to invest a bit more on it then I would definitely give it five stars. This is why I only gave it four stars. If you are in need of a slim wallet for your traveling needs then I suggest you get this one.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are 100% my own and are not influenced in any shape or form. If you felt that my review was helpful in any way please click the yes button below."
4.0,"This dress is very pretty. I bought a large & it fit perfect. My only complaint & 4 star review is because every time I walked the dress kept on going in between my legs, very annoying. I did have a spanx on & I probably should have added a slip, but I was avoiding the slip because they one I own is not short enough. It is a comfortable dress & true to size. Just remember a slip."
4.0,"The pocket isn't big enough for my maltez, she weighs around 8 pounds. Thought she would, with the photos shown."
4.0,Nice variety for a low price.  Material is kind of thick & cheap looking.
4.0,It came in a nice packaging with a cute drawing.  It's pretty nice. The colors seem to be a lighter shade than shown in the picture. It took just about month to ship get here though.
4.0,"Truitye women's printed leggings.  These workout pants are a nice black and a bold blue on the lower legs.  These are on the thinner side but the fit is good.  My daughter is 5'5 and 138lbs and we recieved as size medium and they fit nicely.  The top band is thick and holds the pants up well. I would not do squats in these as I stated they are not really thick.  For waking,  jogging or biking they are fine.  These are comfortable workout pants with breathability."
4.0,They look nice and shiny
4.0,The belt was longer than I expected
4.0,"I ordered two sizes up, and it is a little large but nothing that it overbearing. However, I think ordering only one size up would be &#34;cutting it close&#34; especially since I put clothes in the dryer."
4.0,Didn't actually look like the picture but it is still a nice shirt.
4.0,Its really cute just a bit tight
4.0,Looks just like the picture and pretty comfortable.  Would recommend this ring to others.
4.0,"I love this! So much, the reversible sequins are my new obsession! And I go to music events a lot so I was like yeah this is perffff! But first event I went to the side ripped open luckily my strap didn't come off but I did have to re sew it with my sewing machine. Just a warning to anyone who gets it. Worth it if you don't mind fixing up :)"
4.0,"I really liked these boots but they fell apart quicker than I thought. I made a mistake and wore them on rainy days a few times. Next thing I know, the bottoms were coming off. I super glued them but these boots don't last too long."
4.0,I am 5'2 and 126lbs. I bought the smallest size and they were still much too long and big for me. I do love them so I had them altered. They are a nice thick material.
4.0,"Cute and sassy sunglasses for little divas. First one came defective but waiting for a replacement; hence, the 4 stars. But otherwise a cute find!"
4.0,Fits my wife perfectly
4.0,"Clasp is broke,so l'm gonna take a clasp from something else l have & put it on the keychain."
4.0,"I got the snakeskin in faux leather. Colour is as shown, and the shoe is true to size and good quality. However, it rubbed badly on both feet after 2 hours wear, causing blisters. I will try with moleskin until its broken in...fingers crossed, as its a really pretty shoe."
4.0,"The front goes up pretty high and the length that you can adjust the straps is limited , but I would still definitely recommend these. The material isn’t too thin and they are made long which I love."
4.0,"Like this. Very loose fitting, however being 100% cotton tends to get damp quickly if you are a good sweater."
4.0,Flimsy/thin but cute!  I wear the set frequently.
4.0,Cute and warm. Just don't like the fabric too much.
4.0,Band fits my large wrist
4.0,Good coverage but needs a stronger nose wire.
4.0,It is a gift for Christmas.  The design is really nice
4.0,Fit great. Love the bi color frames. I bought another pair.
4.0,"I love this dress!<br />After reading the reviews I purchased it in the large & xlarge with plans to wear it to an upcoming wedding. Unfortunately the large was too tight, and the xlarge is too sexy for the wedding. I am keeping the xlarge (and purchasing more colors); however I'm still shopping for a dress to wear to the wedding.<br />If only this dress was offered in larger sizes.<br />For reference, I am 5'3, 200 lbs, 38dd, & curvy.<br />I'll post pics as soon as I get to wear it - #LoveIt!!"
4.0,"I really like this coat. It is really warm, and looks super cute. I ordered the maroon color, but when it came in the mail, it was very red. Other than that, it's great!"
4.0,"Glasses feel very durable and well made. The lenses are super flat and don't have a slight curve that glasses usually have which is why I gave this a 4 star rating. For the price, these are gorgeous. I ordered the silver mirrored pair and you can't see my eyes through the mirror lenses which is great!!"
4.0,Sooo cute... I actually had someone  say &#34; those look fun!&#34; I do get some looks so I hope that is a good sign. Thanks
4.0,They are light weight and comfortable. I was hoping for more of a gold tone than the brassy color. I will still keep them and wear them.
4.0,They run large as vans tend to do but my daughter loves them.
4.0,"I loved the color and the material, it was surprisingly good quality, however, I had to return because it was hugeeeee. I ordered a small, I am 5'1"" and like 140 pounds, I usually wear smalls but sometimes go up to mediums but I definitely would need the x-small."
4.0,Beautifully made!!
4.0,It arrived on time. True to size. Nice cut/design. It is polyester and I somehow missed that when I ordered this. I don’t like the material. If they made this in a different material I probably would have bought several colors.
4.0,Exactly as I pictured love it
4.0,It's cute and says exactly what I needed it too and was worth the money I paid
4.0,Great feel socks...little expensive though.
4.0,not as red as in the pictures
4.0,"Runs large, size down. Very cute but they didn’t fit right for several months due to being very big."
4.0,Cute hat overall but snug around my head. I have a small head but a lot of hair.
4.0,Great for polishing the silver items in the house.
4.0,They were perfect all the kids love them ❤️
4.0,"Very cute, good fit but material feels like sandpaper"
4.0,"I got this sink skirt as part of an inexpensive renovation project on my workplace bathroom.  The color was as pictured and the product appears to be reasonably well-assembled.  I certainly wouldn't have expected the self-adhesive feature to work, and upon inspecting the product I can see that it won't. I used Velcro tape on the material and sink surface instead, and that is much more secure.  Definitely an improvement over exposed pipes!"
4.0,PROs Liked that it was bigger than I expected. Also I was worried that the colors would look fourth of July-ish but I was relieved that the red it was more of a maroon and the blue was more grayish.CONS  I thought the zipper could have zipped a little more smoothly but I've had worse not that bad ... there were at few little threads sticking up on the stitching here's a pic next to a box of tissue for size comparison
4.0,"Gi top is great. Seems very durable and that it will last a long time.<br />The pants are a little shorter than expected, although my son is a little tall for his age.<br />Overall, happy with the price and product!"
4.0,This top is huge and I mean huge on. It’s beautiful. The fabric is lovely yet wow. It’s really large size cut.  Like wow
4.0,Really nice but too thin for colder weather.
4.0,Truly a great pair of pants but runs small. The material isnt scratchy or stiff.
4.0,"Precioso el vestido, la tela, el color, tal cual la foto.<br />Detalle importante el forro es demasiado corto, tendré que llevarlo a una modista para que le agregue tela al largo.<br />Un talle más me hubiese quedado grande, aunque capaz el forro hubiese estado bien."
4.0,Can't wear vvery long  They are a littl too high
4.0,"cute and different shirt, love the coral pop of color."
4.0,Love the cape except I wish it was a snap closure.
4.0,Very nice strap but TSA could not unlock it and I ended up with a damaged item on the first trip. Perhaps the locking system needs to be improved so that TSA can easily open it?
4.0,Stretches out at the neck but worked very well
4.0,"I was surprised how good it looked. It looked and feel like it's a very solid pair of glassed. Fits pretty well on my face and not too tight. As for the shade changing. It is not as dark when it changes but that is what I was looking for. I was outside in a sunny day it really turned really dark but I was not standing in the shade and on direct sunlight mid day. Driving though is different, I think it's due to the vehicle's window already has some sort of UV filter so it won't change as much as when I'm outside. Now for the Anti-fog. I went cycling on a bright sunny 90° F day. After riding for an hour I stopped to rest and the glasses started fogging so I'm not sure about the anti-fogging properties. Overall a great pair of glasses. Oh, it also comes with a nice sturdy case."
4.0,"beautiful fabric, ideal for hot nights."
4.0,"This dress is nice, not like pictured though.  It is a thicker t shirt material and is a dark grey color,  not black.  Shipping was quick and customer service from seller was excellent."
4.0,"bought the 8 pack for my friends and i, but as soon as i tried to put one on the string snapped. the other 7 are fine"
4.0,The bows were sewn on wrong. Dress is very light weight so depending on the type of panniers purchased it may show the outline. That can be remedied with a slip. Also the jewel that came with it were broken
4.0,"This dress is really cute, I'm 5.2ft and a DD bra! I got a size S and the dress was cute, but on the short side!"
4.0,It's a good fit
4.0,This is really cute - just as pictured.  The quality is great for the money but it does run a bit small - not a problem for the tutu but it is a problem for the shirt.
4.0,exactly what I wanted and needed. I would order more any day! I am very satisfied. I am about to look buy some more!
4.0,"Nice sock, fits well but NOT made in the USA as stated on website. This is the reason I selected this brand. County of origin USA should be removed from the website, untrue statement. Photo of the box taken, shows made in China."
4.0,"Very nice well made bracelet I was pleasantly surprised. Braided Wrap Cuff Bangle matches the photo on the page for a change you'll get what you see, I love the fact it has a super cool 'magnetic lock' that keeps the bracelet tightly secured, a note of caution, if you have large/wide wrists (no offense) more than likely this bracelet probably going to fit way too tight, or won't fit at all, other than that go for it I love it. Paz!"
4.0,"Good watch, reliable and cheap. The only thing I didn't like was that it beeps every time you press a button. You can disable the speaker by taking off the back and putting a piece of tape over the speaker ground lead, but then the alarm doesn't work, so theres give and take there."
4.0,"Well made, great shirt"
4.0,love the glasses. The nose piece had to be adjusted to fit properly
4.0,Like these bracelets and the look. It did take awhile fastening closure. Great themes!
4.0,I ordered two tops a camel color and a black one the sizes were off I believe the black ones is<br />Size small.  I did like the material and design I will order two more black ones. But I will order them large.
4.0,"I’ve worn these sunnies a lot and have no complaints. They’re comfortable, and the lenses aren’t scratched at all. For the price, these are hard to beat. I used to buy $100-150 sunglasses, but after losing a couple pairs while boating and at the beach, I decided I needed to stop throwing money away. I just ordered these in another color combo."
4.0,"well made, beautiful design and fabric.  I thought it was cut a little small through the hips."
4.0,"I really like these tops, although the neck is a little wider that I would like (not quite crewneck) and they are certainly NOT sweat proof. This doesn't bother me so much, but for someone that it does bother, I would not recommend."
4.0,This Eyeglass Holder is attractive.  It is a little finer than I anticipated.  It was for a family member in a care facility.  I hope it is sturdy enough to last.  These Eyeglass Holders are very difficult to find it seems.  I was very happy to find this on Amazon.  It was well packaged and arrived very quickly.  My family member liked it very much.
4.0,This dress is absolutely gorgeous in person! I just wish it was a little longer for myself.
4.0,The wallet is a really good one. It feels<br />smooth and it fits well in your pocket. The wallet has plenty of pockets and it’s overall al good buy
4.0,My daughter loves them!!! We bought them in a bigger size so she can't wear them now maybe in 4 more months
4.0,I absolutely love this purse. Super cute and I've had lots of complements on it. And it holds everything i need. (Phone wallet and a few ramdom things) Only problem is the strap broke yesterday after having it roughly 5 months. Received March 23rd. And it broke sept 3rd. When it broke I was at the fair and had 6 tiny stuffed animals in it and was trying to stuff one more in with very little pressure (large strap around my neck) and it broke on me. No reason it should have broke. Pretty upset about it. Considering I love it so much! Other then that one thing I was very please with this purse. Size is perfect and it has a kitty face. There isn't a better purse for a cat lover
4.0,"First off, this dress fits just right in terms of chest and hips. If you have a bit of a tummy pudge, though, the ruched bottom that runs directly down the stomach will accentuate it even more. It kind of hugs you like a maternity dress. Other than that, the length is right and feels very sexy. The drawstring to adjust how much chest and midsection to show is great too."
4.0,"I like the quality of the materials (though more time will be needed to see how they hold up over repeated washings). Most of the colors are good, and the price was excellent."
4.0,Cute! Good deal for the price.
4.0,"I really like this design, shape, quality. Unfortunately it was just a little too small for my taste so I returned. But if you like a really small bag, don't hesitate on this one!"
4.0,Bought for 2 year old to grow in to. Works well!
4.0,My wife likes this top!
4.0,So cute and my child seems to love them.
4.0,"This bad is not as large as the dimensions listed.  With a ruler, from zipper end to end it is barely over 12 inches.  The bag will not stand up unless stuff is inside and it is VERY stiff.  I might send back as I wanted a bag that was more expandable (this one is very narrow) and longer.  It is definitely NOT 17 inches long.  It's well made, though, but the bottom has a seam that makes it uneven and lopsided.  The color blue is nice and the handles are sturdy.  The bag may soften up as time goes by, too."
4.0,"One thing I was really hesitant about was the fit, and material.<br />  The inside lining is just like a marmot softshell, the outer is super thick pile. The inside of this jacket is whoa impressive. I have a messed up build, wide shoulders long arms and torso.  The Xl fits trim. Impressed with the build. Sizing could be a little bigger. As there isn't much stretch. Overall I think it's a great purchase."
4.0,Solid Nato style strap.<br />Slightly on the short side but not bad.
4.0,Very nice but no wiggle room. Order the next size up!
4.0,"Thanks to a few of the reviews of some of the other ladies, I was able to make a well informed decision on which size to purchase. I ordered an XL and my measurements are as follows: height: 5'7 or 67in; weight: 161lbs; bust: 36B; waist: 28in; hips: 38.5in. I hope this helps someone out. Ladies, definitely go up at least 2 sizes for this swimsuit. The top fit perfectly and the bottoms fit fine, they were just a little snug. The gold material seems to be more like a halloween costume (cheap material) but overall it's still a cute swimsuit. The top also has a decent amount of padding. Overall, this swimsuit if about the same quality as a Walmart bathing suit. Happy shopping!"
4.0,"I am 5'10 190lbs and ordered the 6x.  It shrank quite a bit after the first wash, mostly in the length so it's no longer a tunic.  I am still happy with this purchase because the quality and fit are great."
4.0,Excellent pair of gloves!
4.0,"Great gloves, but they run small.  I have slightly smaller than average hands, and the S/M size is a little too snug for my liking.<br /><br />Love the magnet, which holds back the flip part of the mitten.  Way more convenient than trying to fasten and unfasten a tiny button."
4.0,they hold and work<br />after using them so many times<br />the price is fair
4.0,Easy to buy and delivered on time..great stuff.
4.0,Great watch but scratches easily and wristband is too small.
4.0,Great product but they were a little big on my face
4.0,Really nice watch. Good price.
4.0,The fit is ok except for the length. I'm tall so it's shorter than expected. I've been afraid to dry it in the dryer for fear it will become even shorter. I have a hard time finding the perfect length.
4.0,"Came on time, looked perfect, and will be a grft for my wife from one of our kids."
4.0,"Really nice shoes but do run small, my daughter usually wears a 10 but I ordered an 11 just to make them last longer but just barely fit her she will probably out grow them very soon."
4.0,"Nice shirt, but runs a little big.  I will save to give my son as a Xmas present instead of back to school shirt."
4.0,The purse beautiful!!! Just the right size and the color is very vibrant and bold.
4.0,"Very nice product for the price, fit and material is worth every penny. I would buy again"
4.0,I got these for my daughter to wear at practice.  She was having to KT tape for shin splints but didn’t like the way it looked. She put these over the tape and the added pressure of them helped her shin splints while running at practice.
4.0,No ride ups
4.0,I wanted to update my travel sunglasses and went with a wayfaire design. These are a good choice. I bought these for the construction and the nose piece (which is plastic) is comfortable.
4.0,Really liked the pattern and the fabric.  The fit was perfect; highly recommend.
4.0,"It's cute, but not exactly like the picture. Weird thin material, but still ok."
4.0,"This is a great but pricey buy.  The quality is good but the price could be a little lower and the colors aren't too great.  Of course, I knew this when I ordered.  This nude is not my nude.  Again, the quality is there so they are keepers!"
4.0,"Good material, well-made.  The fact that one size (length) fits all means that it may be a little long and the buckle may not be exactly opposite the watch. Still,  I'm satisfied."
4.0,Comfortable without messy up your hair.<br />Misleading ad!!!  Says 3 pack in header but only only came.
4.0,"Sometimes when you get these 'funny' t-shirts the material quality is marginal at best. In this case the material, it's thickness and sewing quality are fine although not the very best I've seen. As a gift for my college son this is great. He and his friends will think its funny!"
4.0,"These are lightweight, which means its good for a cold day, but not great for cold with strong wind.  I ended up wrapping it around most of my head because it was very cold and blowing, and even though I was very glad to have it on,  a heavier duty gaiter is called for in more extreme conditions.<br /><br />The look is good and the value is amazing."
4.0,"This is an ok simple basic dress.<br /><br />I am 5'5'' 144 lb, 36DD/E. My measurements are 39.8 (101cm)/ 34 (87cm)/ 39.8 (101cm)<br />I usually order M in Buenos Ninos brand and unlike other of their dresses this one was a bit too loose fitting on me.<br />The fabric is very stretchy. I guess if I ordered S it would have fit better.<br />But I was too lazy and kept this one :)<br />It was ok for the price for me to do so.<br /><br />One thing that I did not lake was that the arm holes were too big and my bra was sticking out a bit."
4.0,"I bought XXL based on others saying these run small. I usually wear XL. If you have large hands, find something else. These run really small. Quality is good. Price is great."
4.0,"Would have gone five stars, but it doesn't vent very well and can be warm. Still preferred that to the sun beating down on my head."
4.0,"The quality of these glasses is very good. They are actually oversized so anyone with a larger noggin will be happy to know that. They are nice and heavy... not flimsy in the least. They are polarized and will help with glare outside in the sun and while driving.<br /><br />My only complaint is these are an little too ""stylish"" and ""trendy"" for my taste. The main reason is both temples have a golden accent. This just isn't my taste but may very well be exactly what someone else is looking for. I will use them in the car to drive or maybe in my kayak, just not for daily wear as they are just not my style.  I like the sporty look, not the ""hip"" in-crowd look.<br /><br />The negative is just a personal preference. If looking for something nice and shiny, these are a good quality product, especially if you need a larger frame like I do."
4.0,I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the dress. It's a thicker material and very soft on the interior. I wish it was a tad tighter in the hips but I did order a size up from my normal just to be safe. Overall I love it and it was fun to watch my boyfriend help me lace it!
4.0,"The shirt is too small and the skirt is too big. They don’t seem to be sized the same. My daughter loves it, I’m just constantly pulling down her shirt and up her skirt."
4.0,This dress is designed after a 1950 dress but is elegant enough for any time period. The weight of the fabric gives it just the right sway and flare when you walk. It fit just so it showed off my tiniest parts and hid my sins. I'll  definitely  wear it again.
4.0,The shirt is flattering and looks as expected. I have washed it once and it survived. Only time will tell if it holds up!
4.0,"Althought this is a nice belt, I found it to be a little plain.  The buckle is beautiful, but the belt witht he rhinestones could have been a little fancier.  I still like the belt, but not as much as the others."
4.0,Very pretty. The backs are not even lengths. But very cute in my daughter.
4.0,Like the fits.
4.0,"I made this purchase with fingers crossed as i was unsure if the would fit. Based off the size chart provided i was looking at a 41 hip 34 waist, Normally if the hips fit i can wear them but that's quite a deference. I was also unsure if wait i would get wouldn't be just a pair of shiny leggings.<br /><br />So when i received them i was relieved to see they were more like actual disco pants that button up and very shiny and red as they should be. I was ecstatic just due to the fact they where actually just what I've been hunting for!<br /><br />Now the second part, the moment of truth... Disco pants are supposed to hug your curves after all.<br /><br /> Sadly they seem to be pretty true to size (per size chart) as i had to work to get them up, not unexpected, but couldn't quite button them up, at least not without fear of damaging them after wearing for any real amount of time. So close! But i tend to drop a size or two on and off throughout the year so i keeped them as i know at some point they'll fit perfect.<br /><br />For reference i usually wear 14 bottoms or large"
4.0,"Nice looking shirt but they do run pretty small.<br />I am a large, I ordered XL and it's still very small and I can't really fit.<br />Probably best to order 2 sizes bigger than you need.<br />Also for me the sleeves were a bit long ?  It looks good in the picture they<br />supply but for a compression shirt them seemed pretty long even in a size that<br />was too small to ware.  Quality looked very good."
4.0,"First it’s ENORMOUS. The sleeves are the only thing that fit; otherwise it literally just looks like I wrapped myself in a large blanket but I am only 5’2”. Second it is a bit itchy/scratchy though feels like it will soften right up after first wear and certainly after a wash. I’m really picky with itchy material and could deal with this just fine. I’d still have worn it if it fit because I really like the weight (not heavy) and LOVE the color (which was unexpected since it doesn’t show in the photos) - a dark charcoal with really fun, tiny specks of colored yarn."
4.0,"Perfect fit for my little 6 year old. It had two same prints of the floral instead of one of each, so she didn’t get the unicorn print, which she was disappointed but she still likes these pants. It almost looks silk and is stretchy."
4.0,My daughter is 8 months old and wears 12month clothes. .  Carters Walmart (Gerber runs super small) oshkosh child of mine etc.  The fabric is good quality and is stretchy..just way too big.  She probably could have worn the 6months.  Atleast she can wear it for a while!!
4.0,"I love it BUT, either my wrist is big or it is small 🥰"
4.0,Fit as expected but it is thin. Better for warmer weather.
4.0,Awesome piece for costuming and an excellent alternative to other metals since it requires no upkeep.
4.0,"Pants are as shown, nicely made. I take a 6 petite pant, slim hips but not a great waist. The pants fit loosely on hips but wearable (about 36-37"" hips). The waist did not stretch enough for me to be comfortable. There is a little stretch but minor. The Small length hit me as regular pants at 5'4"" not ankle pants which I expected. They can easily look dressed up due to the attractive lace inserts.<br />Still a 4*."
4.0,"Cute slippers-however, the pink sheds all over the carpet...."
4.0,"Portable, keeps warm I just wish it was a bit warmer for a shorter amount of time."
4.0,Pajamas fit snug. Order a size bigger if you are unsure.
4.0,"Beautiful skirt and perfect for what was purchased for. Is a little big in waist on my daughter, but she’s 11 and tall, but super slim. Perfect for her height though."
4.0,"I had a c-section and my doctor recommend wearing these times help with some residual nerve pain and healing as they help hold everything in.<br />I have to get the under the bra as I am larger chested. I'm not overweight, but these tanks definitely hold in the pancake top having a c-section leaves lol.<br />Would give a 5-star review if these tanks were a bit longer."
4.0,"It's so shiny! My son and his girlfriend are going to homecoming dance and her dress had gold accents at the waistband, so we purchased this to coordinate.  It looks great with his shirt and with her dress! I feel like the quality is nice, but the neck strap feels a little cheap/flimsy compared to the actual bow. Overall, it's great, especially considering it will most likely be one time use, so we didn't want to invest much money in it."
4.0,It was too small for me.  I've returned it.  However it is very cute.
4.0,"Bought these as a gift, she loved them!!"
4.0,the bead is difficult to put on but looks great
4.0,"The watch packaging is beautiful, the only thing about that was bad is that the made in China stickers came on top of the box so when I peeled it off it left it with this rough feeling and didn't look good, even if I peeled it of gently. This watch is a gift, so I just hope they like the watch and cared less for the packaging. Also there were some scratches along the side of the &#34;gold&#34; part when you lifted it up."
4.0,I liked the leather and the color was perfect. The buckle was okay.
4.0,"Fits an adult face.  Some sort of plastic, but seems to be comfortable"
4.0,They are really useful and convenient.  Only problem I have is they keep sliding off my nose. I wish there was more elasticity (or something) at the top to help them stay up.
4.0,Love how this looks on
4.0,"Ran a bit small in sizing.  I normally run between a large and xl...I went with the xl and it’s an ok fit, just a bit snugger than I like (I’ve got big hips!).  It’s thin and would require a cami or tank underneath but the cut is super cute!  I would buy it again but upsize it."
4.0,"I ordered the purple leggings in a size medium based on the chart and I love the lines and the colors of the leggings but unfortunately I ordered the wrong size for me :(<br />Initially they fit well but stretched just enough to keep slipping down my hips as I moved around. And I’ve worn and washed then wore them again and they’re still too big. Since I’ve washed them and worn them a few times, I don’t feel right returning them.<br />Oh well.<br /><br />To help others, these are very stretchy so I would order the size you think you need And not go up a size."
4.0,"Great sunglasses, cool leather case, and comfortable to wear.<br />They came pretty bent up but they are easily fixable."
4.0,Fits nicely but the material does feel a bit cheap
4.0,Beautiful and comfortable coat! But too small!!!
4.0,"The compression sock were easier than expected to get on. The sizing was spot on. As advertised, they are light weight. I have calf spasms and Achilles tendinitis. My doctor recommended compression socks and I’m pleased with my choice."
4.0,Product fits fine but does rise up a little upon activity
4.0,Bought these for our destination wedding. Thought they were royal purple but their more pink than I thought.  The stencil we put on the sides stuck great and they lasted through the whole trip.  One of my guests said he like that the sides are bendy so they fit any head size and the men rocked them!
4.0,I would recommend if you are 6'1'' to 6'2'' and have a build like a college cyclist I know people have said to get a size two times bigger. I don't recommend. Got an XL and it was like wearing a cape. I would recommend a medium if you are 6'1 and weigh 175 pounds.
4.0,"I like the material and fit of the blouse, but the asymmetrical hem goes up a bit too high on the hip for my taste. Very soft and comfortable otherwise."
4.0,"This is a gorgeous necklace!<br />The pastel colors would flatter most everyone. I gave these to two people as gifts, and they loved them"
4.0,"I’ve collected lots of coins over the years and I don’t usually write a review. However, this coin is just beautiful. I’m so happy I bought it. I would highly recommend that if you enjoy perfect coins this is one you want. All other coins will for me be compared to this one. BEAUTIFUL!!!!!"
4.0,Love this Im not as small as the model but it works takes a bit of playing with to get the fit you want.
4.0,"The suit fit odd. The body portion fit well, but the gaps in the legs were way to large. This was a gift so my sister will be returning it. I even ordered a size smaller than normal to avoid such an issue with the legs."
4.0,I received this the other day and I used 1 of them today I used th at work I have to wear equipment ony arm and these help me stay cool and clean from the equipment.  I felt that the materials was quite thin and a little flimsy but it still did what it describes.  I purchased this at a great discount
4.0,"Nice shirt. I'm 5,7 and 140 lbs. Bought a small size and was a little big."
4.0,"The graphic isn’t as crisp as it looks in the photos, but despite being and a bit blurry it’s decent looking. I’m 6’/165lbs and bought a medium (which is what the sizing chart suggested). It fits me fine, but is a bit loose at the wrists and back (unlike my under armor compression shirt and thermal). I probably would have been fine with a small, but the medium works better as I’m in the process of bulking back up and don’t want it to be too tight. That being said, it’s a compression shirt and is designed to be form fitting, so I don’t know why people suggest ordering 1-2 sizes up, especially since it is true to size/sizing-chart-specs. I’ll use it for work outs in cool weather, and as a rash/stinger guard when surfing and scuba diving, but I can’t see many other uses for it. It’s too thin and breathable to keep you warm, and not the sort of thing you should wear in public without looking like a bit of a DB... Not a bad buy for $19, but if I wish I’d have gone with a short sleeve."
4.0,"It is cheap and thus looks a bit cheap, but hey. They've survived going through the washer twice, so that's a bonus."
4.0,"Arrived on time in new packaging with tags, as pictured. One of them had the pads loose and weren’t sewn in like the others. They are nude padding and do not match the grey lace top they were stuck into the pocket of the top. Makes handy if don’t want a padded top for a day however one star off since I ordered them thinking all would be intact in the package. Pretty colors of lace."
4.0,Love the fit bit I constantly have to pull them back up
4.0,Beautiful and comfortable. Got the wrong color but that may have been my own fault
4.0,This nightshirt is attractive and comfortable but I t does run a little small.
4.0,"I am so thrilled to find this cap. I have a super tiny head and it's like it was meant for me. So yes, even thought it's adjustable I guess you could say it runs small. The design and colors are so beautiful. I didn't give it 5 stars because the top has a pointy shape, which you can't tell from my side angle pic. I'm thinking it's due to the packaging and maybe I can mold it to be more boxy, trucker style. Happy to support this small business and their lower price point and quality product!"
4.0,I bought it for a trip to Disneyland. It was the perfect size to carry all the small things I always seem to need. It is easy to get into and stays zipped. I was actually able to continue wearing it on many of the rides. Only down fall is you can only wear it over one shoulder and when the strap started to irritate my neck I couldn’t switch shoulders so my BF had to carry it instead.
4.0,"the item was exactly like the picture but i’m 5’7 with mostly legs and i got a medium and it’s a little small around the ankles, i got the product in white and it is almost non see thru, you can see a little when you bend over but nothing too bad"
4.0,"Love the swim suit, I typically wear a 8-10 and I ordered the XL. The top is too small, fits more like a B cup."
4.0,I would go up a size. I bought them for my son they run a little small.
4.0,"Slip off my heels, but not all the time. Very thin and great for wearing flats, but don't wear to work out! I blistered my toes :("
4.0,It has a soft feel but the white image is not true to color more like beige.
4.0,"For those concerned about the length, it's not that the pants are too long, it's that they're specifically left unhemmed so you can choose your own length. In the old days, all high-end stores did this. As a 5&#34;10&#34; woman I LOVE it. I wish the world would go back to this as a standard.<br /><br />They're a bit loose in the waist. I would suggest going a size down.<br /><br />The fabric is light-weight. They're a perfect &#34;uniform&#34; for summer. I'm quite thrilled."
4.0,Bonita. Le gusto a mi sobrino. Fue obsequio de navidad
4.0,Lovely dress! My daughter loved it. Only issue was that it was very wrinkly out of package. Took some time to iron it all out.
4.0,loved this Dress BUT the Key hole neckline is very low. I am short from the shoulders down and have trouble with some straps. I don't do cleavage..  the dress was beautiful though fit very nice and material was a heavier blend so the lace on bottom stayed like it should.  I would have kept it but felt I wouldn't wear it due to the low neck line.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:23ead4526d8df8b0bf074c00c581213b]] This outfit is cute and it is also tall girl friendly. It’s definitely true to size so do not size up has plenty of stretch. The only downside would be that the material is a little shiny for some reason.
4.0,My fiance loves this ring but the edges on it are sharp and dig into his fingers. We're gonna try to sand/buff the edges to make it more comfortable.<br /><br />UPDATE: Seller is going to give me a full refund for the ring. Wonderful seller and communicator.
4.0,Love this sweater and it fits exactly as expected everywhere BUT the sleeves. They sleeves are almost prohibitively small. I am going to try and cut a notch in them and see if that works.<br /><br />Otherwise I love this. The color is deep and pretty and it's not overly warm.
4.0,They gorgeous but they only  lasted for one night ☹️
4.0,"It is really long. Since I'm taller (5'8"") it comes right to a perfect length on me. My coworker had to tie it up when she borrowed it for our Halloween party. The material was not super thin like some other dresses."
4.0,"These, I like!"
4.0,I loved this suit when 1st purchased but after swimming several times it has stretched & is way too big. It now hangs to my knees when wet.
4.0,looks good love it
4.0,It's unique.  I got it because of the other style fit me nicely.  I thought this would too. It fits but wouldn't be comfortable for all day.  Wide feet issues...
4.0,"Headline: OK, inexpensive watch<br /><br />Good Points:<br />Lots of functions - analog and digital time, 24hr mode, alarm, stopwatch, cool blue light up mode (digital only), day and date<br />Buttons are large and easy to press, time is easy to set in both modes<br />While there are lots of complications on the face, it is still easy enough to read.<br />If you've ever used a digital watch, the button layout is easy enough to understand with out instructions (they came in English in case you do want them)<br /><br />Be Warned (Every good review should have a few cons to it):<br />Mine came shipped in just a bunch of packing material.  It shipped fine, but there is not even a cheap box so this is not really gift worthy.<br />This is a very big, thick watch.  If you like that, this won't be a problem.<br />If you're wondering what the 2 circular complications are on the face... so am I.  Even after reading the instructions because they are not mentioned.<br />Keeps time OK. After a few days I noticed the digital clock was about 8 to 10 seconds ahead of the analog.  This may not be a big deal to you, but I wanted to let you know before you purchased this.<br /><br />Recommend?: 4 stars as an under 10 watch.  If you're looking for a toy, this is fine.  For a serious watch, I'd pass due to the inability to keep accurate time between the 2 modes.<br /><br />Reviewed on: 7/15/16<br />Current Price: $3.50<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.<br />I will be happy to try and answer any questions anyone may have about this product as I take the responsibility of reviewing very seriously and would not risk my integrity by giving a misleading review.<br />If this review was helpful to you, please take a second to press the “Yes” button below."
4.0,"I purchased the navy striped version of this dress, in a large (I'm 5'8"" 160lbs., 36D). It is not a ""true wrap dress"" like the other reviews, it is one piece sewn closed in the front, with a zipper on the side, there is no wrapping happening. There is a ribbon-belt thing that ties in the front to give the illusion of a wrap, but it's not. Also.. HOLY CLEAVAGE! If you're above a B cup, you will be spilling out of the top of this for sure. Also super short. But for the price it's cute and would be cute for the summer. Would not recommend for any processional environment."
4.0,Nice and lightweight. Colors match what I expected. Fits very well.
4.0,Love the design and fit. Wanted to be covered but but look feminine. This is stylish and comfortable.
4.0,Good fit and good price.
4.0,This vest looks great on my husband.
4.0,everyday use is appropriate. decent quality. fits the bill
4.0,Really really tight...
4.0,"I was disappointed when I saw how small it was when packed, but now that I have unpacked it I think it will be just what I wanted.  Lots of inside pockets, plenty of room for my Kindle and any papers I have to schlep around.  It's very light and will be easy to carry."
4.0,pretty d cent work gloves that still allow me to pick up small items like screws and nuts
4.0,"As a Christmas gift to my sister, I hope she love it."
4.0,Worth the price lil big but loved
4.0,The metalic is plastic
4.0,"Good glasses, well-made, with only a hint of optical distortion near the top of the field of view. However, the photochromic function is marginal at best. At full sunlight in San Diego, California, the glasses darkened to about 65-70% transmission.<br />They may be okay driving glasses if your vision requires +1, and you have a tinted strip near the top of the windshield. Wouldn't do anything while driving into the Sun.<br />Update: the glasses will, after a long while, darken under the sunlight. The blurry photo gives an idea of the optical density of the glasses after 3 hours in desert sun - close to about 25-30% transmission. Bumped up the rating a notch."
4.0,"I absolutely love this dress. It is how I imagined.  I could have gone down a size but I am not bothered by that.  The only reason I took off one star is that it is super long.  Others had commented about this as well. I am 5'5"" and I had to take off 4 inches. I can sew, so that is not a deal-breaker for me but I can see that it may be a deterrent to others. the material is fabulous- flowy, It's mostly rayon with a little spandex, that is why it drapes so well. I may still buy other colors because it is an easy piece to wear during hot and humid weather."
4.0,Ring is just what the pics shows.. very nice and got it in a good amount of time too..
4.0,A little blingy but my contest winners love them.
4.0,The print on this band is great. From far it looks braided. Shipping was quick.  Packaging secure.  The band slide on to the watch face easily.  Overall great band for the price
4.0,"giraffe is nice, chain is quite short, all in all nice piece"
4.0,"Both the fabric and the style are confused.  Should they be a couple.?  The style is a little formal, but the fabric is casual.  You decide when it would be appropriate because it depends on your ongoing style of dress."
4.0,"I really like the orange bow earring, but wished they were just a bit smaller.  Very sparkly"
4.0,Good quality material and burgundy colour is exactly as shown. Love the style.
4.0,"Bonita y de buena calidad, pero poco elástica"
4.0,Well done Uncommon - great bag!  Wish I knew about your company years ago.  I use it for my 13&#34; MacBook Air on my daily commute. Enough compartments w/o going to the point of more compartments just for compartments' sake. Well padded laptop pocket.<br /><br />Only reason I gave 4 not 5 stars...wish the grip side of the shoulder pad was gripper. Still slides when I'm walking.
4.0,Really cute dress but the band around the middle was tight on my ribs. Sizing up would have made the top part too loose.
4.0,"The wristlet is very nice and soft.  I returned it because I didn’t like the color, yellow gold."
4.0,"I will start to say that this dress is very cute, well made, nice style with the asymmetric hem, nice metal accent.<br />I saw it on a friend on mine and fell in love with it, but unfortunately it did not fit me as well.<br />I suppose the reason is because I wear a 36DD. Size S in this dress fit me well otherwise (I'm 5'7"", 140 pounds), but something in the upper part was unflattering. I think I needed a little more room for my breast. You might not have that problem if you'r smaller. I might try the upper size, but I don't like clothes that are lose on my waist.<br />Anyway, cute dress, just consider your measurements very well.<br />UPDATE: I ordered the M also, to see if the fit was better. And I ordered it in pink this time.<br />Color is not like the picture. It’s really a Barbie pink. Regardless. Fit in my upper body was still not flattering, though there was enough room now. My final thought is that this dress would look best on someone who has a smaller chest than hips, rather than an hourglass figure, as one would expect from a fit-and-flare dress."
4.0,Good quality. Not necessarily a heavy duty glove but good for running errands and short trips outside during the winter months.
4.0,Good for mowing next spring.
4.0,"Could be better, but for less 10 bucks its very good. Looks a little bit small for men"
4.0,Super flattering. Camouflages my problem area (lower stomach) nicely. My only complaint is that it pills very easily
4.0,"A simple maroon blouse. <br />It has a v-neck (no real collar) and buttons down the front. <br />The sleeves are long and have an elastic closure. <br />There is a slight pattern throughout that will remind you of small puffs, which offers some texture.<br />It fits true to size. <br />This blouse looks great under suits, with slacks and even jeans.<br />I also like that you can wear it tucked inside your pants/skirt or outside. <br />And finally, this blouse will look great with colors like navy, tan or gray.<br />I’d recommend it."
4.0,Good watch. Too big for my sister.
4.0,"It is large on me. I'm small boned and 105 lbs for reference. That said, it is more lovely in person that is photographed here. I do like it. I could link it to the material to make it tighter around my neck (I actually never knew my neck was small until ordering this). There is gold embedded in the flowers that is not rather detectable in the photo. The material as well is shiny in areas. So a beautiful piece. One star removed because I was hoping it would fit smaller around the neck. Super fast delivery though! I got it well before the expected delivery date (a couple of weeks or less)."
4.0,The earring backs are plastic lost one the first day!!! Thanks for nothing!!
4.0,"To start off with, I read a lot of reviews on this waist trainer. Many women recommended going up in size. I measured and measured and measured again, just for good measure. (Ha ha.) I followed the recommendations of going up in size. Following the chart, I should have been able to fit in a size large easily. I purchased an extra large. Felt like it would take team effort just to get the extra large on but no way was I going to ask someone to help me squish all my extra baggage in. Finally after a lot of effort, I was able to get all the hooks done up. That was a work out in itself. But it was on! Not for very long though, it was very uncomfortable trying to sit down. If I could stand up all the time it might not have been as bad. About one week later I tried it on again. This time it was much easier to get on and it felt a lot better. Actually it felt kind of good and it did make me look slimmer everywhere except at the top in the back. It appeared to move my muffin top to my upper back. This was with a tighter tank top on. Maybe with a looser top, it wouldn't have been so noticeable.  Either I lost a little weight or it stretched out a bit or maybe it was easier to get on because I'd done it before and just had it figured out. This waist trainer is very well made. It has three rows of 10 hooks that would need to take a lot of abuse to get one of the hooks to pop out. They are put in very well. There is 2.25&#34; between the first row of hooks and the third row. All of the seams are sewn very well. All in all this waist trainer is made with quality in mind. Even though I don't know how long it will take for me to wear it comfortably for more than an hour or so, I am glad I purchased it and I do like it. Maybe one day I will grow to love it. For now liking it is ok.<br />I received this waist trainer at a discounted price for my honest review. I take my reviews serious because people count on an unbiased opinion of a product. As a consumer myself, I look to these reviews to receive more information about a product I am considering purchasing and I know I want to read the honest opinions of others. This is a perfect example of how important honest reviews are. Had I not read that a lot of women recommended going up in size I probably would have followed the chart and purchased something that was way too small for me. Buying something sight unseen makes honest reviews even more important."
4.0,Cute. Fits as expected
4.0,"Would have given 5 stars if it were a true medium, but more like a woman's small"
4.0,The swimsuit fits great.
4.0,I love this shirt very sexy. I thought the material would have been more blousy but it was more of a stiff t-shirt material. It is still cute on and will see how it washes. I am worried that it might shrink and then it wont look as good. THis is why i gave it 4 stars. I bought a xl and i am 5'4&#34; about 180lbs. so if you want it looser get a size bigger.
4.0,I did not realize that there are three different shades of color in the lens  depending on the angle that you are viewing through. I would not recommend for really  bright sunshine. But so far so good!
4.0,Cute inexpensive watch.
4.0,The colour of the scarf is brighter than the picture. It is more golden in real. It is overall a nice scarf.
4.0,it's fine... for the price you won't be disappointed... color was a lot lighter than I anticipated but that very well might be my fault...
4.0,"I would give it 5 BUT...that top x is weird and slightly loose for some reason on me.  The rest is a nice fit and flattering, but I don't quite grasp why the top X lays loosely.  I will fix it myself and keep it because it's going to be very very cute when it fits right.  This might be a point of issue with someone who doesn't sew because you should end up having to pay to get it to fit.  It's a stretchy material, so it should fit snug."
4.0,With this i was able to make my own version of a popular &#34;poupuri&#34; spray for the bathroon
4.0,A little too small around the waist but super cute and nice length
4.0,"The ball is stuck in one of them. Right now I cannot get the earring back out of my ear, I've tried pliers I've tried lubricating the ball with soap and I can't get it out. The jewelry is nice other than the fact that the parts that hold the ball on place are too tightly togrther and I can't get it out."
4.0,"I usually wear a small but I sized up to a medium which fits well. Its material is a bit thicker than I would like for the summer and will be a better dress during fall. Overall, super comfortable and of decent quality. I'm 65 inches and weight 125 lbs, small hips with broad back and shoulders."
4.0,"I use this to hang over my rear view mirror in the car...Just one problem...the writing on the cross came to me in Spanish, and I did not know the writing was not going to be in English when I ordered it. Regardless, I did not return it because I only needed it for the car. Solid cross and good chain not bulky."
4.0,Nice shoes! They work perfectly...by now!
4.0,"Based on the sizing chart, I ordered a large. The material is pretty stretchy, so it was a bit loose. Doesn't shrink when washed. I would buy another color in a medium."
4.0,"I was relieved when I tried this one...I went 1XL and it fit perfectly between tight and baggy. I am usually a L, so I would definitely say this runs a bit small. If you like Kigurumi, go a few sizes larger for the extra space.<br /><br />THERE ARE NO POCKETS OR PELVIC OPENINGS so this is literally a cover all style which disappointed me. Who wants to take off their tops to pee? But it wasn't a deluxe price at $30ish.<br /><br />The quality is good but not great. I have sensitive skin and the fleece is not terribly soft on the inside; but I made it through Halloween afternoon and evening before I had to take it off because it was so warm! Each NOM cookie is embroidery. The patches aren't firm though, so again it was much more tolerable than I thought it would be.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see how the fleece holds up with repeated washings (my machine can steam so I am hoping that will give it a longer life). It might end up looking like a ratty cookie monster, but that could be a cute cosplay twist too: OOH, apocalypse cookie monster?! Fun!<br /><br />Overall feeling...I am gonna make this work !<br /><br />My advice to the"
4.0,"Overall a good quality product and much more affordable than some well-known brands. If they were a tad shorter in length, they’d fit me better, and I have to pull them up a bit since I’m on the shorter size or I may have done better getting the mediums. There is really no compression and would love them more if they had a bit of tummy control. I’m terms of the look I think they’re pretty cute and definitely enhance your curves."
4.0,A little smaller than I thought! but our still not bad for the price!
4.0,Thank You!!!
4.0,Wish the material was a little thicker but I love it<br /> Just ordered a new one in pink
4.0,"Love the color, length and style. Only thing I didn’t care for was the cut of the dress at the armpits."
4.0,"Pearls are nice but the backing is too small to use it.  Finally tossed the backs as they didn't work well,  and used some of my spares."
4.0,"This looks fantastic, but it holds cards not the coins.  No complaints otherwise."
4.0,"A little larger than I normally wear, but love them anyway and will be wearing them 👍👍👍"
4.0,"These leggings are as adorable as the listing pictures show…<br />I chose the rainbow/mermaid scales/navy with flowers set in size 6/7 US or European size 130 to have at my house when my 4 yr old & 5 year old nieces visit.<br />I always order a size up since kids can grow into things but can’t wear things too small & the sizing is accurate. These actually fit both of them since the elastic has plenty of leeway & the fitted legs can gather at the bottom if they’re long.<br /><br />One small issue is the material which is 95% polyester & 5% spandex. It’s stretchy & comfortable, but just doesn’t breathe much. My personal preference is for at least a cotton blend.<br /><br />**Thank you for reading my review & I hope that it’s Helpful!**"
4.0,"These have a relaxed cut in the seat and thighs, and with the stretchy material, they're quite forgiving and comfortable. My 33x32 measure a little over 34&#34; inside at the waist, a little less than most 33s (almost all pants are larger than stated to accommodate those of us who are larger than we think), but they stretch out a couple more inches without too much squeezing if needed.<br /><br />The inseam is a bit more than the 32&#34; claimed, close enough.<br /><br />They look just like worn denims, but without any rips or holes (and feel just like denims to me--one reviewer says they don't).<br /><br />Machine wash inside-out, cold water with like colors, non-chlorine bleach if needed, tumble dry low heat, warm iron inside out if needed, no iron-on patches, no dry clean.<br /><br />Made in China."
4.0,Love these earrings! Very cute and packaged well. The metal is a little cheap so my ears get irritated when wearing them but otherwise great deal!
4.0,"Other reviewers are right - these are not really compression tanks unless you order them a size too small. I am 5'8&#34;, about 165 lbs and reliably wear a size 10, meaning I'm usually somewhere between a medium and a large, so I ordered a large just in case. They are VERY comfortable and fitted, but they are also very stretchy, so they are in no way a compression tank. For that, I might have had to order one or even two sizes down. They are really nice, though, and fit great for yoga and running/walking, so I plan to get more."
4.0,"However , I have large hands and they did not cover my wrist ."
4.0,I really like this necklace!
4.0,"I like them. They do look 100% slipper bs slipper/shoe. Consider going one size bigger, i didnt and little small."
4.0,"I work at a casino and we have to carry clear purses! So if we shop locally, we can end up<br />With the same purse! So I bought several from Amazon. I really loved the design of this purse and got plenty of compliments on it! Unfortunately one of the straps broke after carrying it for a week! 😥"
4.0,i love the dress but it should have had a zipper in it it is very hard to get over your head
4.0,Great Quality.  Love that it came as pack of 2!
4.0,I like the fit. The material is like a thin cotton. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is bc they are a little see through but nothing to serious
4.0,"A tad see through yet thick, sturdy material. I would buy again. The tummy control is a little loose for me; but, that is not a deal breaker. Can wear them by themselves or underneath pants as well."
4.0,Love these for the price! I am worried they will fall out of my ear because the clasp isn't the most secure but so far I haven't had any issues. They aren't too big - they're just the right size and great for a special occasion / dressing up.
4.0,daughter loves these!
4.0,A good pair of plastic inserts for pictures.
4.0,The weave of the main waffle fabric was too loose so you can easily see through it. I would either have to wear something else underneath to hide my bra. The sleeve pattern was a thin fabric as well so the whole thing was just too thin and cheap looking. The shoulder opening wasn't as wide either so maybe size up if you'd like it more loose.
4.0,"Outfit was very cute for my daughter's 1st birthday only reason why did not get 4 stars the t-shirt material curled on the bottom all day but not a big deal to me, got alot of compliments!!!"
4.0,I am usually a L but ordered an XL and it fits perfect. I’m 5’4” 150# 38D. The color says “gray” but it is a taupe. Closer to beige then gray.
4.0,"I bought these because I have ceramic tile throughout my apartment that I cannot change because I'm a renter. When getting ready in the morning, my feet start to ache from standing on it. These help a lot! They are very soft and plush, exactly what I was looking for."
4.0,look great--wheel broke off the first day--the screw came off on the inside  so need to try to put back together.  But looks great and everything else seems good
4.0,"recieved upon schedule, but it was really fine other than that am inlove"
4.0,First off these are very comfortable. I didn’t notice in the description of these that they were more of a capri. They are an ok length but I prefer a bit longer. I am usually a small or medium and got a medium just to make sure they weren’t too tight and they seemed a bit loose at the top and I had to pull them up every now and then. I like the waist height and material.
4.0,"Love this chain. It is flexible, feels solid, and my hair doesn't get caught in it. Looking to buy a few more in different lengths!"
4.0,Very nice necklace.  A little larger than I expected but I'm sure my granddaughter will love it!
4.0,I like that this wallet has no screws that will come loose. I place my key card in the money clip and it does not register on scan pad.
4.0,"I bought this bag for use as a personal carry on for air travel.  I searched stores and Amazon for just the right bag thinking I'd like a backpack style.  I needed something that could fit my laptop (if I wanted to pack it) but one that wouldn't look like a laptop bag (or a diaper bag!).  I wanted it to be fashionable and functional.  Not finding a backpack style that fit my needs, I happened upon this bag.<br />I love the multiple open pockets on the outside for my phone, sunglasses, keys and water bottle.  The zipper compartments on the outside worked great for my kindle, hand lotion and pens.  I did fit my laptop in the main compartment (15&#34; Macbook Pro) but not in the specified 'laptop/ipad' compartment.  That was as expected.<br />I spent a lot of time picking out the color as I was wanting something other than black but still a neutral color for travel.  The navy is a very nice color and I felt that it went with everything I wore.  The gold tone hardware is tasteful and goes well with the navy.  The material wipes clean with just water or a wipe.  The zipper pulls are smooth and secure.<br />I was able to pack this bag full for our travel! I had my art journal, apples, bars, liquid carry ons, water bottle, wallet, all above mentioned items, magazines and a light sweater.  I could have fit a pair of shoes if I'd had to!:)<br />Overall, I am pleased with this bag.  The only thing I find myself wishing for is that the laptop compartment could fit a 15&#34; laptop to keep it separate from all the other items."
4.0,I love this dress it's​ fit nice on me. I got a large in to the blue dress. I'm 5'5½ weight 160. It's see-through but I don't care. Everyone love the dress. I got this dress for my birthday.
4.0,Great piece. Beware the teeth on your tie.
4.0,My boyfriend loved these gloves.
4.0,Very nice but a little too heavy for their size.
4.0,"These shorts are a super comfy material, similar to yoga pants. I really like the high waist but will be exchanging for the next size up—They were a little snug in the waist and I want them to fit a little more comfy for lounging. For reference I am 5’4 118 pounds and ordered a size 4. I’m not sure I’d recommend these for running, I will be using them for casual wear."
4.0,"Looks great and I like it a lot. One quibble: The back clasp secures on the right, instead of the left - so right-handed people will find it a little tricky to use. If I were a lefty, I could pop this bad-boy in without looking, no worries ... but it's taking me some practice to install it on the back of my head. Feels counter-intuitive; I keep trying to put it in upside down.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a lovely piece and I'm willing to work for it."
4.0,The graphics are a little below par.
4.0,I absolutely love how cute this bag is! The only issue I have is that it’s too small to hold my phone. As in I can’t zipper it inside the bag. The it’s a lot smaller than expected but I still love it.
4.0,"It is fun products like these that make me wish I were more petite.  I have learned through a lot of trial and error that clothing like this that is coming China that they will run small from American women sizes.  I knew going in that they wouldn't fit me - BUT they do fit my 13 year old niece and she is in love.  I received these tights in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion in the form of this review.<br /><br />They are in a cute illusion style where they are full coverage tights but the top portion is nude so it gives the appearance of thigh highs without the annoyance of them dropping and sagging all the time.  The cute little &#34;tattoo&#34; at the top is a whimsical touch and I think many would like the different designs.  I only wish that I could actually wear them, but at a size 14, that would never happen with these."
4.0,They were a gift and liked a lot.
4.0,"this is a cute bracelet. 3 hollow 1.5mm thick bangle bracelets joined together by an o ring that has a cute hollow puff heart dangling from it.<br />The bracelet fits a 7&#34; wrist size.<br />The three bangle bracelets are a shiny gold tone, making them appear to be real gold-looking expensive.<br />The heart is about the size of a dime- so decent size that it is easily seen. Also a shiny bright gold tone-adding to the expensive look.<br />This is a bracelet for many ages- if you love hearts- this is for you. If you love bangle bracelets- this is for you. Fun Flirty piece for sure.<br />See photos below.<br />I received this item in exchange for my honest review"
4.0,Very soft slipper although it's sole is a little on the hard side. Otherwise it seems comfortable. Let me say that I originally bought these for my mom but decided to keep them for myself as they won't fit a wide foot. By that I mean the way it fits over the top of the foot. An average width/instep would be just fine. Happy for the price.
4.0,Loved these socks because they stay up without being tight.  They are long enough to come up to the knee.  Very comfortable.  Would have given them 5 stars except they do shrink a little after washing.  Maybe that's asking too much?
4.0,"I work for a nonprofit as a roving IT minion, so I'm always carrying around dozens of smallish tools, cords, adapters, and other random doodads. The GRID-IT organizer (which I use with Nite Ize's Gear Ties) keeps everything readily accessible and prevents random kit from getting lost at the bottom of my bag.  It took me about 30 minutes of trial-and-error to figure out how to arrange all my gear to make the best use of the various sized elastic straps, but it was well worth the time spent. My current EDC backpack is a Timbuk2 Showdown, and the 10&#34; GRID-IT fits perfectly into the small flap pocket inside the laptop compartment.<br /><br />My only criticism thus far is that out of the package, the GRID-IT organizer had an overpowering, nauseating ammonia odor. I had to let it air out on my balcony for a solid day before I could use it, and even after a week it still smells bad when I pull it out of my bag."
4.0,The bottoms fit great the top was a little small.
4.0,Well made but somewhat snug for the size. Order up one size.
4.0,These earrings are GorGeouS!!! The only reason I'm giving 4* is BC the silver ones had a minor flaw...one of the jackets have a pc that is slightly shorter than the rest (see pics I posted). The earrings are non returnable so I have to keep them..the flaw isn't that noticeable but I see it. The gold ones were perfect. But both of these earrings are still Gorgeous! I strongly recommend buying these!!!
4.0,"i got this for my girlfriend, she says it is very comfortable.  she said if anything it was too warm, the material is pretty thick.  overall it is a good product so far and worth the money"
4.0,"I normally wear XL shirts but this was just a bit too long and baggy. Also, this is the shirts fault but I don’t like the shiny look/feel. It comes off as cheap, almost like a Halloween costume material, I prefer the porous/cell look. It will work as a good under layer shirt though."
4.0,"I always love a Timex Indiglo watch! The light on this one is not nearly as bright as a regular Indiglo, but it's certainly enough to see in dark surroundings. The band colors make a beautiful overall turquoise color."
4.0,It is nice and warm
4.0,"After reading reviews, I bought a size larger.. shouldn’t have done that. It fits just right and is true to its size (at least with me). I usually wear size Medium, I’m 5’9. Large is a bit too big, but the length is good (which I usually struggle with). I like the pants overall, they are nice and stretchy, I like the material."
4.0,"These neck gaiters are extremely thin. I am not sure if it will keep away anything other than the sun. Very cool material and there is 6 of them in the pack. My children love these ages 9,10, & 12 and I well not so much at this time."
4.0,I really like the shirt a lot but I got the wrong color. I'd rather keep it than go through the effort of returning. The shape size and quality are great.
4.0,Earrings are pretty but it would be better if it was  bigger.
4.0,they look really beautiful but they are a little smaller than expected.
4.0,Exactly What I needed.
4.0,"I'm a huge fan of Fender work shirts and have acquired a few rare ones that gets me a lot of compliments by many musicians. I've had my eye on this Vince Ray Voodoo Blues version for a few years. Just bought it and it's very cool. The silkscreen graphic print on the back is enormous! It covers the entire back of the shirt!!! It's definately a statement shirt. On the front, the skeleton guitar player is embroidered which gives the shirt a quality look. If the print on the back of the shirt was also embroidered, this would be a 5 star shirt. The buttons are a nice touch, inlaid with the Fender spaghetti logo. The large fits me perfectly, true to size. I don't like wearing blousy shirts, but if you need more room for &#34;growth,&#34; go for it. The material IS NOT microfiber... It's 100% polyester which gives it a &#34;Dad Shirt&#34; look, especially if you prefer your shirts to fit blousy and boxy. Most of my Fender work shirts are 65% polyester and 35% cotton and fitted to avoid looking like a retiree. I wish this shirt wasn't 100% polyester, but it fine. If you like Fender and Vince Ray art, this is the shirt for you."
4.0,Great fit and comfort too. Wasn't expecting this for a shoe in this price range. I'm impressed! The shoelace could be a darker color tho instead of blue but that can easily be changed.
4.0,"Colors are not quite as bright as the picture, but still very cute!"
4.0,Seems quality and quick shipping
4.0,Colorful n cute for summer
4.0,These socks look great. The band at the top sort of cuts into my legs. I have wider calves and need more flexibility at the top.
4.0,"These are a great Halloween costume accessory, something fun to put on for a bit for photos or walk around during the day with.  But that's about it."
4.0,I am a novice in watch repair.  This packet of tools was helpful in removing the back off of watches for battery replacement and minor repair.  I am sure it would be better for someone move involved with watches.  It serves its purpose for my needs.
4.0,"This shirt fits nice and it actually buttons. A few shirts I’ve gotten off of amazon don’t actually button. The only thing is, is that it had a little dust when i took it out of the package but that can be washed off."
4.0,"My daughter loved these. They were easy to put on for me, but my husband has small fingers and it was hard for him to help our daughter. We didn’t think we would get much wear from them, but surprisingly enough she’s worn them maybe twice a week with no issues."
4.0,Very cute and comfortable. Soft fabric that allows the skin to breathe easy. Good buy for anyone on their feet looking for comfort and cuteness.
4.0,"I love this wallet, but I deducted one star because it is large than I thought.  It would be perfect if the last quarter could be chopped off.  Problem for me is, the current size is perfect for my day purse, however, my night/going out purse, this wallet is too big. So I have to transfer cards and money each time. Pretty annoying.  It will do for now, but will end up purchasing something smaller."
4.0,packs into a tiny pouch.  I bought this for travel instead of lugging big coats.  On really cold days I plan to wear this with a raincoat shell and I think it will keep me toasty.
4.0,"This camellias woman camisole with built in bra torsolette bustier top slimming shape-wear, is just awesome and amazing! It makes you look slim, and it gives a little lift, in the upper area. The built in bra is padded, and you cannot take padding out, which is one thing i do not like about this, i do not care for padding in any type of bra or camisole. The built in bra might be good for not busty woman, i am not that busty, i wear a size C cup but i still prefer to wear a bra with this, it does not give a lot of support. The straps are detachable, which is awesome if you want to wear this with a strapless dress. It does have a zipper and clasp in the back, maybe to make it easy to take of? I think it is just super easy to slip over like a normal shirt, but when taking it off i do find the zipper and clasp in the back helpful so i can take this off without taking off my other shirt. It does slim me down a little bit, and just makes me feel good while wearing it!<br />  the one complaint i have about this is the smell, i don't know what it is but it is such a strong smell, i washed it like in the directions said to do, hand wash and hang dry, and the smell still didn't come all the way out. Hopefully next wash the smell will be gone, because it is very unpleasant. Overall i do like this camisole a lot, and wear it all the time under my clothes to slim me down a little bit, it is also a nice undershirt for like button ups.<br />- I did receive this product for free in return for my honest and unbiased opinion. All statements in this review are strictly from my own personal experience with this product."
4.0,"The dress was very nice, but a little to big for me. I didn't return it because it came the day I was leaving for vacation and when I returned, it was to late to exchange it. I wish I could exchange it because I have a dress with tags that is too big. 😌"
4.0,"The shirts are great, but the sleeves are long. Bought these as undershirts but the sleeves are longer than the shirt I put over it. So I cut the sleeves…..oh well they work"
4.0,"The cover itself is fine, however upon getting it there is a warning that says it contains material known to cause cancer, they should have that disclosed in the description..so that people know that before buying it..not after they get it"
4.0,I am surprised it fits me exactly and for my body shape but it is a little tight on top but well I like it it looks exactly as described and I like it a lot I may just buy a second one in another colour as well.
4.0,"I use these for cutting grass, wood working projects, I sweat a lot and these glasses fog up."
4.0,I have a 6” wrist and it is a perfect fit. Not too tight but loose enough to be comfortable. Nice looking but not for everyday wear.  The plating looks like it would scratch easily. Great for evening wear
4.0,Just not made for a real man 2XL Sort of disappointing but girl friend likes it.
4.0,"This belt is very cute, but runs a bit small. I have a small waist and normally have to buckle belts on the tightest notch, but this belt was a big snug. (It is elastic with a front hook, so you can adjust the fit.) Just order a larger size than normal and you should be fine."
4.0,It fit fine the arms felt a little small. Other then that i love it!
4.0,Very comfortable and pretty but the points at  the end of the seem  stick out
4.0,"These red booties  are super cute. The leather is soft and pliable. I normally wear a 7.5 or 8 and these 8s were hard to get on. I have a high instep and these fit tightly across them. Once I got my foot in the booties, they are fine and hopefully they’ll stretch out and not be quite so tight across the top of my foot. I’d buy an 8.5 but the the length is great. The toe box has plenty of room. The sole isn’t very padded so long term wear might be an issue but time will tell. I  really like these and hope they last. I’m going to purchase at least one more pair in another color."
4.0,Soft and comfy ! At an awesome price ! Cute design and my child’s (10 years )favorites .<br /><br />Taken a star off since they’ve seemed to loose their colors and shape after a few washes .
4.0,"Muy linda pero no lleva el distintivo de su marca, además me quedó grande por eso la voy a devolver."
4.0,I bought this dress and I also ordered the turquoise with sunflowers. I returned the turquoise because the print was missing through the bust area and it was see through. I love the red print though! I didn’t give it five stars because the pockets are odd. They won’t stay flat so it adds to the width through the hips. I’ll be sewing them closed.
4.0,"This is a cute little outfit. My son has worn in once and the pants faded quite a bit in the wash.  I would have given it 5 stars if it wouldn't have faded.  Otherwise, it fits my son perfectly."
4.0,"Flattering swim suit for curvy ladies - minus one star because the bra cups are in such an odd spot, fit a tad off so just took them out completely."
4.0,"Super cute! Looks just like how it does in the photos. (which we all know, some photos/items look completely different on amazon)<br /><br />My only issue is that it says &#34;one size&#34; in the bottom description but when you have to choose the size at the top, it's a M, L, XL option, so that was confusing. Anyways, I'm usually a small (5' 2&#34;, 125 lbs) and I ordered the medium (even though I'm sure the apron is really one size fits all).<br /><br />Apron is adorable, but the panties were huge lol. They were more like a L instead of an M (like I said lol confusing) but I'll just wear my own panties... not a big deal.<br /><br />Amazing price, arrived a day earlier than expected & good quality for costume lingerie!! I'm super excited to wear it this V.Day weekend. &#60;3"
4.0,This was a Christmas present for a dear friend he loved them says they're comfortable was very appreciative wear them in the snow feet stay warm
4.0,Colors are pretty.  Style is nice.  Material is too polyestery.
4.0,Comfortable material. Fits well. Not see through.
4.0,"Well made and will work for what we wanted,  only thing better would have been a divider inside."
4.0,The V is a little deep but like the shirts overall.
4.0,A little tight but very warm❤️
4.0,"Fit perfectly, good quality."
4.0,Item looks good and has some weight to it going to enjoy wearing this
4.0,Cute. Not really a flattering cut and it runs slightly big so if you are looking for a tighter fitted shirt maybe size down
4.0,White dots arent super white as the red has tinted them almost a pale pink but still a very nice tie.
4.0,"Definitely go up a size or two.... I went up two sizes and it fits through the chest and hips. It is a short dress. Even with boots and leggings, this is still a casual go out to dinner kind of outfit, not office attire. For the price? It is a good buy and is soft and comfortable."
4.0,It came on time to wear for that day and it fitted me Perfect I'm 220 and ordered an XL
4.0,Haven't gone on trip yet but think they should work out.
4.0,Great quality and delivered fast
4.0,This is a lovely brooch.  I really like it.  A lock on the pin would have made it safer and less likely to open accidentally.
4.0,I normally purchase orthotics that are a name brand sold in high end stores and recommended by my doctor.  I purchased this product mainly because of price and hope that they would offer the same support.  They are not bad but were not as comfortable as the other brand straight out of the package.  Seems to have conformed to my feet with use.  The fit my shoe perfectly.  I would probably buy again.
4.0,"They are very well made and fit well. I don’t know if it is due to the grownup like design, but they appear to be a bit bigger than what they are. My only knock against them is that my kid complained about the comfort a bit the first time he wore them. He has worn them twice and appears to be ok with them but will update my review if anything else pops up."
4.0,Pretty comfortable from the get-go...couple nice complements already
4.0,"Very soft, super cute, but my only complaint is that it runs big. I ordered a size 5 but it's more like an 8/10."
4.0,"I loved it. I wore it for my birthday, the chain clip to the choker broke, but the way that it’s made, it didn’t matter"
4.0,"The cloth polishes well.  I was planning to cut it into pieces and give away small cloths with handmade brass jewelry.  Would have to sew the little pieces together as the cleaning side and polishing side are two separate cloths as already noted.<br />I don't need it now though, as I discovered a couple of minutes soak in white vinegar and a good rinse shines brass just as well. :)  So I'll just save it for when I need to polish fine metals!"
4.0,I’m sure my 3 year old granddaughter will love it!! Very cute set of jewelry for a little girl.
4.0,Wasn't crazy about the fabric of the hat.
4.0,Glasses will fit a kid from 4 years old to 7 years olf
4.0,Bag is great. Very good value for money. But came with some smudges on the side.
4.0,Very comfortable and made out of good material
4.0,Very cute. I wore them with a garter belt. My boyfriend was a fan. Fit as expected.
4.0,"A tad on the short side, but other than that it was wonderful. The straps are adjustable, as in you can select which button out of two you would like to use, which was an added bonus for me. In my case, loosening the straps (to attempt to lengthen it) resulted in them falling off my daughters shoulders. As I said though, this is my only complaint. We received many compliments on it and the color was perfect."
4.0,Good quality jewelry and a nice presentation
4.0,"These really are some  awesome good looking boots, didn't get a chance to wear them due to the size were to big, apparently they run big in size so I'm excited and patiently waiting for the smaller size to get to me, so that I can enjoy them."
4.0,This pants arrived on time and appeared as advertised.<br /><br />I like the look and feel but I gave it 4 stars because I ordered a size 36 and the item I recieved was a size 38.<br /><br />Since the fit wasn’t that bad and a belt helped it to stay in place without appearing bundled I kept it.
4.0,"a little expensive for what it is, but decent quality and does what I wanted it to, keep my face warm while walking the dog"
4.0,We love these hats.  Really protected my kids from the sun and were comfortable for them to wear.
4.0,Everything fits well. My only complaint (and just in general) the stockings tend to roll down my thighs but it can be fixed with a garter belt.  :)
4.0,It's a cute witch hat for a grownup witch. I'm looking forward to wearing in on Halloween!
4.0,"Loved the design on the socks, unfortunately they do not fit."
4.0,Great fit and comfy so far. He not been in the field with it yet so had to go with 4 stars
4.0,Gave this as a birthday gift for my daughter.  She loves the look as it is right up her style.  The fit in the shoulders and upper arms is a little tight but not so much that she can't wear it.<br /><br />Main issue is the buttons are TOUGH to work into and out of the the buttons holes at first.  After a few times of buttoning and unbuttoning the fabric stretches around the holes enough to make this easier.
4.0,"Like the fabric, cut and style of the dress but the sizing was off. Ordered according to the size chart  and fit was off. But ordered tje next size up n it was a good fit.."
4.0,This dress was purchased for a wedding. I'm 5'4 and it's really long on me. Besides that everything fit true to size and it looks really nice.
4.0,Covers what I want it to. Bust support is decent too!
4.0,I love this dress. Its really long and sometimes drags and I’m 5’7”. It isn’t totally see thru and the color is a warm based burgundy.
4.0,These camo overalls are cute and comfortable. They do for a little big but with the tie it’s fine. The material is a little heavier than o thought it would be but overall these are definitely worth it! I ordered a small I’m 5’2” 125lbs
4.0,"I really like this romper, it’s soft material and comfortable and fits just like it should as shown on the models. Only complaint is the sleeves, they are 1/4 length but loose, so if you want to bunch them up your arm they won’t stay up. Otherwise they hang just above your wrists so I rolled mine up twice. I’m 5’8” about 145 and got the medium. Not too long, can wear heals or flats. I will most likely buy the spaghetti strap romper for summer from this same brand."
4.0,"A little smaller than I thought they'd be, but they arrived in perfect condition."
4.0,"i'm a plus size and on top of that i'm pregos...i got the largest size i could find which was an XL...<br />the bust area was a tad bit tight, and the hat/wig is waaaay enormous-so i'm looking for an actual wig...but everything else was great and it looks great...love the colors!"
4.0,"The only problem with the belt, is the belt buckle scratches very easily. Everything else is great."
4.0,I am in love with this dress. I bought it based off the reviews and photos and I'm so glad I did. The dress looks just like the picture. I ordered the dark blue. I am 5' and weight 168 and got a large. The thick material helps smooth out any lumps you might usually wear spanxs to hide. I am so happy to not have to wear spanx in this🙌. It comes to about right above my knees since I'm short and weigh a little more but I still think it looks great! Highly recommend!
4.0,I GAVE THESE TO MY DAUGHTER FOR HER BIRTHDAY AND SHE LOVED THEM.  THEY ARE FASHIONABLE AND STURDY. THEY WILL LAST FOR QUITE A WHILE
4.0,Just what I needed at a great price. Have glaucoma and had cataract surgery with implant lenses a while ago. These will be great when I drive my convertible or swim in our pool. A little snug at first but easy to adjust.
4.0,"Not as think as I hoped, but definitely full length and cozy! I'm 5'8&#34; average build, and the sleeves are perfect, it hits a couple inches above my ankles, and wraps around easily. I've washed it a couple times and haven't had any issues with pilling or lint or anything :)"
4.0,Love these! Super cute and lightweight. The only negative is that the wire part is really cheap so they don't always dangle down properly.
4.0,It’s pretty small in the chest area but loose at the rib cage area
4.0,The design of this bracelet is quite cute and it will fit a fatter wrist due to the little chain.  Be warned that the charms are small.  The tree maybe an inch diameter.  I expected more for my $8.  Like larger charms.  I wouldn't buy it again at this price.
4.0,"nice color and fabric, but small for a medium."
4.0,"Bought this for a friend as a Christmas present (we love to work out together)!<br />Her waist is a size 25/26, she's 5'6&#34;, 118 pounds, and has a small butt...so I guessed size Small.<br />We did cardio and ab workouts, during which the pants were great. She also likes the black/gray combo, as she always wear gray/black/white. Her only complaint was that it shrunk when she put it through the dryer (granted, I told her she probably shouldn't), so it hit her above the ankle. Additionally, the ankle opening was somewhat loose and not fitted. Overall, good product."
4.0,I love my necklace I ordered. I'm going to wear it to my brother wedding.
4.0,Came early and very satisfied with the product.
4.0,"I would imagine that for it to look exactly like the photo, the buyer would have to have a relatively small to medium head.  Maybe a teenager."
4.0,Like the dress. Will have to work with a different bra so it will not show. Glad I purchased one size bigger than my normal because of the tighter fit.
4.0,"I ordered this in an XL so it would be super over sized (usually a medium). It was pretty big, but not quite what I expected. The length was shorter than I’d thought. Still works overall. It did have a very strong chemical smell but that went away after one wash. Recommend cold wash and air dry to avoid shrinking."
4.0,Perfect for keeping shirts tucked with out having to have a long strap looped to your foot
4.0,"Super super comfy, and a great price! I just wish that they didn’t pill so easily, but they’re definitely worth getting!"
4.0,Love these besides they are too dark.. but I live in Iowa so when the snow comes they will be perfect because of it being so bright out.
4.0,Looks as pictured but a little damaged in transit
4.0,2XL might have worked better
4.0,This is such a light Springy scarf.  I love the colors and pattern.  It does come out of the package with a funny smell.  Plan to wash it before you wear it.
4.0,I normally wear a small and could not get the waist to fit.
4.0,"I loved this scarf! It is soft, light and goes with everything in my wardrobe. My only complaint is the long shipping and the terrible smell of the cloth when it arrived. It took a few washes to get it out."
4.0,The item fit as expected and I like it
4.0,"It can be hard to tell from the product picture, but the metal insert that carries the color and logo are NOT protected in any way from scratches, and I suspect the logo would wear off pretty quickly.<br /><br />Pick up a small kit of clear epoxy resin and DIY a nice protective layer that also catches the light nicely if you want it to last a longer. Part of a 'blue accents' theme I gave to my niece for her new car, and she loves it!"
4.0,Not as bright turquoise as shown.
4.0,"Looks really cute on, and is very comfortable"
4.0,"As expected... fit and material.  A plus that it has inside tie and pockets are okay; personally I think it can do without them (pockets) but can't complain either.  Length was perfect for me-- I'm 5ft (it fell 2 inches above my knees).  Size was good too.  I got a small and I'm 118lbs, 36C.  Going to order another color."
4.0,A very nice bracelet to start my collection.
4.0,"Exactly as they look , love them"
4.0,"Comfortable, durable, great for working with machinery or in a factory<br /><br />Bought these and one other brand. Like them both.<br /><br />Gold and silver are glittery though, wish they were more matte."
4.0,"I bought this to wear under my wedding dress and it worked wonderfully. I used the size chart and other reviews to make my decision regarding sizing. There is a lot of room to give when it comes to lacing up so I was fairly safe. It is long enough that it gets the lower stomach and it does wonders for the shape of your waist. As another review mentioned it doesn't do a whole lot for the bust, but it did hold them in and cover them enough, it just didn't make them look super fabulous. It was difficult to get on and I did need help to lace it up. The clasps in the front can be tricky as well."
4.0,"This skirt is cute, and seems to be well-made, but it was at least one size smaller than I expected, maybe two."
4.0,"Like this bag got it in brown for the summer, I have leather hobo bags but since this is not leather I won't worry as much if it get scratched up or marked up.<br /><br />There is an odor to it so I sprayed it and aired it out on my porch over night!<br /><br />Hopefully the odor will be gone in the morning. I also bought a purse organizer ( my first) to put inside it should work. Since this bag had no zipper and a small magnet it easy to lose things so I bought the purse organizer, I gave it 4 stars for the odor!<br />UPDATE:<br />I have to send this bag back, the smell after 2 days airing out still is very present and makes my stomach turn&#62;"
4.0,"Got this dress for our gender reveal party! It was perfect, and got so many compliments. Got the white dress with pink and blue flowers on it. Fit really nice, although it looked too long. It was actually the perfect length. I got a size large, which is my normal size and I am 18 weeks pregnant. Fit exactly as I hoped it would. The only thing I was not expecting was that there was a lot of brown color in the leaves, the picture doesn't show much of it. Still was a beautiful dress and was perfect for the occasion."
4.0,I purchased a medium based on the size chart but it was smaller than a typical medium. I would have kept if it was the right size. I recommend if you go a size up. I needed for a gift and ran out of time to get a new one.
4.0,This cloth gets my silver jewelry cleaner than it's ever been!  My first cloth got so dirty that this is my second purchase!
4.0,They were a gift but she seems to like them. Soft and not itchy
4.0,I sent this back not because of poor quality but because the handle is very hard to put aside to get in the bag.  But for the price it is very well made and looks like real leather.
4.0,Purse is nice and sturdy. I like this purse a lot. The only thing i did not like is that the teddy bear looks cheap. One of the rhinestones came off the day i got it and then the teddy bear broke off the chain a few days later. I love the purse itself and i really love that there are four different pieces that are a matching set.
4.0,These pants fit very well.  The material is thin and perfect for beach or a warn environment.
4.0,Bought this for my daughter because she has a fake chain that needed to be replaced and this worked out perfect.
4.0,"I'm VERY pleased! I ordered this to replace my fave go-to dress that I burned a hole in lol .. it was EXACTLY identical to this one except different manufacturer.... I was super sad when I burned it and immediately started looking for a replacement.... I'm so glad I found this... I love the look on my frame..... I'm 6' and my measurements are 41-31-42, the large fits perfect.... It literally arrived today and I just ordered another one in a different color.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I feel its overpriced.... The one I burned literally cost me $9.99 at Ross.. and so I think that $21 is a bit much given the material and design.... But since I really liked it and I'm too lazy to look for it in shops, I'm willing to pay more in this case."
4.0,"This is a very nice looking bracelet. If it wouldn't be because the bracelet turns upside down in the wrist I've given 5 stars but otherwise I fully recommend it, you can use it at any circumstances"
4.0,"Awesome watch,had to resize which was very easy although my only complaint is some of the paint on the &#34;strap&#34; had scratched off"
4.0,Lenses are bigger than I wanted.....but my grandaughters like them
4.0,Very simple and kinda bulky material
4.0,Great buy it👌😏
4.0,"These are thinner than I thought. They are about standard thin. But they are a very nicely intense pink. I was concerned reading the reviews, that they were going to be too small. I have very small hands and they fit just right for me! They are a little bit smaller than a small standard vinyl glove. They were not tight at all. I am disabled and cannot walk, and I end up grabbing onto things to steady myself and also if I'm shopping I have to bring the items close enough to see (because my vision is also damaged - and not surgically correctable) I pretty much need to use gloves regularly. I have been steadily on the search for ones that fit my little hands and yet were still fun colors. These are good ones. (Now I just wish there were more colors! Spring Green!)"
4.0,The fy was spot on
4.0,very comfortable and very well made product!
4.0,Functions as expected. Nice soft lining so no scratching glasses. Nicely weighted doesn't tip
4.0,This is a very nice top that fits well. The bottom hem is unfinished however
4.0,The hat is very beautiful
4.0,Great top but sleeves were very long on me. I cut the bottom ruffle of the sleeve off and it fit perfectly.
4.0,A bit large but very cute.
4.0,Really love these shorts! Not to tight but not baggy grab my legs just right. Material is comfortable.
4.0,"Although the post to toe length is a bit too long, these are better than Oofos for walking due to their springiness.<br /><br />The major drawback besides being too long in the toe is durability.<br /><br />I would buy these again if they were available."
4.0,"Good ties. I  loved the purple one! I thought the other one was ok. They were almost a perfect fit for me (a bit short, not much, not very noticeable). I am about 6’3” and I tried it with a half-windsor knot. They are polyester so I washed the one I used with cold water and they don’t shrink.<br />If my review helped you in any way, please let me know by clicking the ""helpful"" button below.  Any questions you may have, feel free to ask… Thank you!"
4.0,Fit as expected. Cute! The arms are long and big.
4.0,Bought so many of these as Christmas gifts. Everyone loved them! They work for about 6 hours after fully charged and I love that you can take out the bluetooth device and wash the hat. Only con is that the velcro pads that keep the headphones in place already came off ao we had to replace it. (On 4 out of 5 of the beanies)
4.0,I purchased this navy blue dress for church! It is comfortable! I love it!
4.0,I love the colors of these headbands! And the flower is the perfect size. The only issue I had was some of the lace came unglued..quick fix though. I always get compliments on them
4.0,"Man! These suckers are thick! They are so thick I think they can stand up on their own!<br /> I purchased these because living in Michigan and my daughter is extremely picky about the feeling of fabrics on her body so she refuses to wear blue jeans. My daughter has not worn these yet as she was a little off put about how thick they were and truthfully I'm not sure I will be able to get her to wear them as they might agitate her issues with fabric, but that is of no fault of the product itself.<br />These things should serve their purpose for the crazy February Michigan weather."
4.0,Looks good somehow big
4.0,They fit well.  True to size. Very comfortable. The material is quality and feels really good.
4.0,This is my second one
4.0,"Super soft material that has some stretch to it. Cut is very flattering. I'm 5'4, 190 lbs give or take, and the XL fit nicely (my normal size). The only negative is that the sleeves are much longer than I expected. I've never had this problem with any other long sleeve shirts, but they are 4-5 inches too long."
4.0,"Great deal....I got so many complements ,is a little tight but I made it work!! Love my santa hat"
4.0,"I love the dress, but their size chart is wrong. the dress runs very large for a small."
4.0,"Smaller then expected,"
4.0,"Soft leather, easy to wrap.  Great length"
4.0,Fit perfect..looks good.
4.0,It i a pretty heart. The diamonds are small but they are there. It is a pretty dainty piece.<br /><br />This necklace was pretty. It is pretty versatile and will work for a great deal of settings and people. I think it would be good for anyone from a child to an adult.<br /><br />I thought it was unique. It came packaged nicely. It would make a good gift. The quality seemed good.<br /><br />It was very comfortable to wear. It was flattering on. I felt it was reasonable. I would recommend it.<br /><br />It is nice to get real sterling silver.
4.0,For the price it was great. Love the links so I will large and small wrists. Did take a long lime to arrive.
4.0,my size is Am 5 or 23 cm and that is what I ordered but it is a half size to big. although this slides feel great very soft and I love them.
4.0,"Decent inexpensive gloves. They take the bite out of the chill, but do not expect them to keep hands warm below about 40 degrees. Good driving gloves to insulate from the cold steering wheel."
4.0,"These are great sports bras. They don't provide maximum support, but I'm happy that the girls are no longer hitting me in the chin as I'm running and working out."
4.0,zipper was on left side.
4.0,I think it's ok - a little on the small side.  It did arrive on time.  No problem with the seller.
4.0,It's a little hard to insert what's left inside the loop
4.0,"For reference, I'm 5'9, 145lb and usually wear a size 6/8 - I ordered this in Large. I could have worn a medium, as this is not Asian sized like some other items. Order your true size. The reason I'm only giving it 4 stars is that the fabric isn't normal chiffon, it's a little cheapish, but for the price, what can you expect? The hem is also not straight but hi/low, which is fine since I tuck mine in..."
4.0,"Looks exactly as pictured. Washed well in cold water, tumble dry on low. I purchased navy in Large. I’m 5’6”, 155 and it fits me perfect.  I normally wear a Med or a Large but decided to go with Large in this and it was a good decision. Fits comfy. It is very soft. Texture reminds me of a chenille bathrobe not regular polar fleece. My fabric is not sewn directly straight with the nap (weave) of the fabric. The back of garment fleece is on a slight angle. Probably not noticeable by many but I see it. Not a deal breaker for the price point. The snaps are fine and there was no odor as some other reviewers mentioned. All seams are sewn completely and neatly.  I do own the name brand version of this in a different color. This one is less than half the price of the name brand and is close is general look, minus a few details and alternate fleece fabric and missing some quality details of the higher priced original. Overall, it’s a decent and cozy top for the price. I’ve received several compliments."
4.0,"Fits great, looks great, just be careful ironing.  Even with the iron on low, the fabric melted a bit."
4.0,"It is exactly what I expected.  It comes with the tool to remove/add links.  This was great as I needed to remove a couple and it was fairly simple.  It is easy to put on and off and does not leave marks if I am sweating.  It fits my fitbit Blaze exactly like the rubber/plastic one did, but in my opinion looks much nicer."
4.0,"The item was for my son who wears a large. I originally ordered an XL just to be on the safe side. But, it was too small. I had to reorder a 3XL. He loves the hoodie."
4.0,"Have not worn yet. Fits perfectly. Runs small, just as reviewers said. Seems very good quality."
4.0,Super cute and comfy but a little snug
4.0,"Well made, excellent price"
4.0,"I understand what other reviewers have said regarding the waist band...it runs small. However, I think it is meant to be stretched. I heard seams snapping when I stretched them out before I even attempted to put them on, but there was no damage done to the leggings. It was almost like when you rip open the pockets on a jacket that were sewn together.<br />They are worth it. I love them and after a little stretching, they fit perfectly and are actually a little slimming."
4.0,I don't like the material of the dress however it photographed well and I received a ton of complements.
4.0,"Really cute, and good quality apron"
4.0,I finally got these buttons today shipped from Australia to the United States it was well worth the wait.
4.0,"I love this hat! It's very good quality felt and fits marvelously, very stylish and just what I wanted...almost, anyway. Minus one star for being stiffer than depicted. It isn't really floppy at all, but looks good if you don't mind a stiff broad brim."
4.0,Good product for the money.. well done. design could be improved and it'll definitely be nicer
4.0,I'm carrying this right now. It's comfortable and I love the design. It has a roomy exterior pocket for your cell phone and a zippered pocket inside. I just wish it had another zippered pocket.
4.0,Super comfy - I have several colors
4.0,"I really love this bag. Gorgeous rich colour, spacious and just totally great. It comes with a strange smell however. I am hoping that it is just because it is new.  I only just got it so I am hoping that it fades. I will keep you posted."
4.0,Lovely dress just a bit big for me. Material is also nice.
4.0,"It came out of the package smelling like one of the worst mildew and mold smell I have ever experienced.<br />I washed it twice and dried it with many fabric fresheners, but it still slightly smells moldy.  I can't give it up because it is so beautiful, warm and well made; but does anyone know how to get the mildew smell out?"
4.0,Came when expected. Very cute.
4.0,"This is a bit tight in hips, a but loose in the waist"
4.0,"Very Pretty. I enjoyed wearing one, but couldn't talk anyone else into wearing the other. Everybody has their own taste, I guess."
4.0,"light weight , comfortable to use"
4.0,So pretty but a little too short.
4.0,"They are okay, I cut out the elastic laces. It made it to hard to get my 3 year old foot inside. I added regular laces and it's fine now"
4.0,"Looks to be good quality, but size is not right, too tight in waist. You need to check your size chart."
4.0,This is a really cute top for working out or just everyday wear. I got an XL and it fits me like a typical XL would so it is true to size. The material is light enough to not be uncomfortable. The mesh back area is a nice detail. The white is a tad bit see through but with a sport bra or tank under it there wouldn’t be any problems.
4.0,"So pretty! Love how it fits. Material is a bit thin, but get what you pay for."
4.0,These are nice. My daughter loved them.
4.0,Feels like air. I had to get used to it on the treadmill. It seemed a bit slippery though.
4.0,These were smaller than I thought they'd be but still very pretty.
4.0,Overall great shirt. It fits on the slimmer side but not too small where it didn’t fit. I like my shirts relaxed fit but this seems to be more slim fit.
4.0,"Just receive these. They fit good and feel broken in and comfortable even before having been worn. The only two things I am disappointed about is that the  retail box was smashed (were shipped in a mailer which arrived torn on one side) and that there are some tiny glue stains on the right boot, at least they are by the upper part of the inside zipper and cannot be seen too well when boots are on."
4.0,"If using the first hole, the remaining length of belt is just barely long enough to slide into the retaining loop. Still a good product, but would be nice to see the 'tail' of the belt be just a tad longer with the holes at the same distance from the hook and pin."
4.0,"Bought this top last year and wanted something a bit more loose fitting. Bought this shirt in a medium, which I am, but felt a little larger than I expected it to be. I really love the material on this shirt because it's light and soft. I should've returned it and bought a small but ripped the tag off before trying it on trusting it'll fit like all the other stuff I buy and this time I was wrong. A small probably would've still fit a bit loose but more to my liking. I do love that it's long enough that it covers the butt area. This shirt does run a bit large so I would order down, unless you like a really loose fit."
4.0,It is darker than the picture.
4.0,They fit comfortably and looked great! Great quality and delivered on time.
4.0,"Cute and inexpensive earrings, that look higher quality than reflected by the price. Prime shipping is THE BEST."
4.0,"Did not realize it was pearl until it arrived, disappointed that it was not the rhinestone that I needed"
4.0,Very comfy. It did pill a TON and holds hair like nothing else. Looks gross if it isn’t fresh out of the dryer.
4.0,It fit perfect the my daughter loves it. Materials is comfy and stretchy.
4.0,"Only issue is this particular watch was fairly small. Really more for a woman or a very young person. I gave it to my 9 yr old granddaughter. Noting wrong with it ,just not for me. That is if it were larger, piece works great and I have had Casio in the past and always been very happy and it lasts a very long time battery wise."
4.0,Love the watch and would give it a 5 but every time I charge it I have to turn off watch and back on before my Bluetooth see it again. This is very annoying.
4.0,"I'm a big guy, over 6-feet and 200-pounds, and they are a little tight on my big frame compared to other XXLs I've purchased.  That said, they have superior wind blocking even on the coldest days."
4.0,I like the shirt but to small.
4.0,"The shirt was a little snug, but still fit well enough to keep. It was also much more see through (sheer) than I expected, but fabric like this is always hit and miss so I am not upset about it. I can just wear it with an undershirt. Other than that it is very pretty and seems well made."
4.0,"I love my slippers! However, they do run a bit large.  I ordered a Large, as I wear a 9 1/2, however they are loose on my feet.  I feel a Medium would have been perfect, however I just tied mine up tight instead of exchanging, because they are so comfy & warm!"
4.0,Glittery very fitted and clingy but lined. Front of the dress drapes from knees to ankles. Dress is midi to ankle length. Looks like the picture.
4.0,I love these socks!  I took off a star as one of the straps was sewn on twisted.  I've never has a defect in toesox before and wear them daily.  Too bad this particular pair had a flaw.
4.0,"Very nice socks. Look to be a purple color in the picture but came in a black, possibly very very dark purple. Not a big issue as every computer shows colors differently but was looking forward to the purple."
4.0,"I’d recommend adding glue to the screw. I had a scare and lost the rose urn, as it fell off after 5 months of wear."
4.0,ran a little bit for me but that just might be cause my face is small but not to shabby !
4.0,I LOVED the way I looked in this dress! I received many compliments throughout the night. Ordered up as many of the reviews suggested and it was still a little tight. But I was wearing it as an evening look so it was ok to be a little tight. Be sure to have nude/skin tone under garments if you purchase the white because it is thin.
4.0,Too small for me but I gave it to my daughter and she loves it. It looks really cute with leggings.
4.0,Exactly as stated. Very happy with product!
4.0,Tight fit around upper arm and shoulder area. Love it. Very cute. Will order a larger size.
4.0,"The dress runs a little (emphasis on little) big.  but, overall it was a great dress.  the material was thick and the attached petticoats give it a nice little poof.  I had to take away one star however, because the zipper broke the first time I wore it.  embarrassing!  But I had a shawl with me, thank goodness.  luckily, the dress runs a little big, so I just removed the zipper and sewed the back up on my sewing machine.  the dress is flawless now."
4.0,"I usually wear a medium, I bought an XL because all of the reviews said that it ran small. Needless to say they were right. The XL was perfect."
4.0,I must say the material is not thin at all. I really like the quality feel. Have not tried it on as yet but I must say I think I will love the look. Take it from me. Good purchase for the price and in no way it look cheap. I Am satisfied. I attend alot of meetings for my department and I love when I am well put together. Will provide an update if I see any negative change
4.0,In length it’s short for a taller gal - I’m 5’7 it comes to waistline.  Wear a tank under.  I did have a screen print put on it.....
4.0,The bag appeared roomier in the ad.
4.0,The dress arrived promptly and the color was as expected. It is a bit lighter weight than I expected but I think it will be fine. It is very comfortable and doesn't require a slip.
4.0,They are a little big but comfortable and have lasted for a while.
4.0,Theses slippers were delivered on time and make a comfortable house shoe and a happily received gift!
4.0,"It fit as expected but i feel like the length is too short, maybe because I’m curvy and my tush is big. Not sure but it’s a cute little dress for the beach"
4.0,Very cute but the hat was WAY too small. Love it!
4.0,"I actually like this nightgown, but the bottom does not look anything like in the picture.  It is basically a comfortable slip.  I was pleasantly surprised."
4.0,"Runs large,  very cute though."
4.0,Thought it would be a little thicker but still nice.
4.0,"Liked the fabric as it was not real sheer, and the elastic elastic did come to the right place under chest. Realize I look better in something that is cinched in the middle."
4.0,"Love Smokey, design is great, but it's still a mask and I hate masks"
4.0,Cute as heck but its TEENY! It's definitely more of an infant had than a toddler hat!
4.0,"Very cute and dainty ring. I took a star off due to how easy the ring bends, which is really my only complaint"
4.0,"Great quality. I am 36 busy 29/30 waist. so I got a large. It fits perfectly every where but it is a tad too lone. And it widens at the bottom. Nothing so worry ones self about. I am sure it may shrink if I dry it. Overall, great product. I do recommend."
4.0,"Like the top and cute dress, but didn't like the way the skirt fit. I have wide hips and this dress wrinkled and accented the wrong places. Really cute, but didn't quite fit right."
4.0,"I like the fit, but if you are 5’4” or shorter, the back will drag the floor."
4.0,I love the color purple on these sunglasses. They are great! My only complaint is they feel a little cheap so let's hope I never drop them because I don't think they will survive.
4.0,I'm on the plump size of life... 5'11'' and 255 lbs. ... and find it almost impossible to find thigh highs that stay up for any significant amount of time. These srocking do that and it doesn't matter how active I am. Wore  a pair and not once all day did I have to adjust the stockings because of any real slipage. Very satisfied with this purchase and they look good on my legs to boot.
4.0,"Got a small but it was a little tight, had to adjust it"
4.0,"I'm returning this dress as it wasn't quite right for me but the quality was good for the price point. It was a bit roomy in hips and thighs. Would probably be very nice if those are features for you.  If you're narrow in that area, probably not."
4.0,"Material is sturdy, no doubt. Overall it looks good. only thing is, it does not stick to your nose properly and the arms are little too long for a standard person. If you have a bigger face, the problem won't be there."
4.0,"Comfy and sporty, doesn't effect performance. Will buy again later."
4.0,cute dress but not my style
4.0,I did like it.  Easy to care for
4.0,like the sandals
4.0,This fits like a shirt but could be worn as a bathing suit cover up. The material is fairly thin. Even though it's thin it doesn't appear to be see through.  I tried it on as soon as I took it out of the package.  It felt so silky and soft.  There is a lot of extra space in the chest area but that could be because I'm not as well endowed as I wish I was.  All in all it's a nice shirt /dress that I will wear on the beach.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
4.0,It was a bit big even though i got the right size but it isn’t squat proof
4.0,Great variety of earrings. Not very wellade but I didn't expect much with the cost. I love the style though. Great for the price.
4.0,"All of the sets of earrings were beautiful. 0nly 2 of the sets were a little too long for my taste, but still very attractive."
4.0,"I like them, they slip off some, but not too bad. I'll buy again!"
4.0,"Love this purse, it's dainty and stylish, it's just not big enough for my phone to fit, which was my intention of purchasing, but still a cute purse"
4.0,"Very good suspenders, but might be better if it is not so massive."
4.0,"Here in California, this is not what we would consider a light weight jacket. The fit is as expected. The pattern is bright and clear. The flannel is brushed and very soft. My wife can wear this here on the west coast as a winter jacket as a good layer against the cool weather. The metal buttons are a nice touch and lend a bit of rustic flavor to the jacket. Overall, my wife loves this. P-)"
4.0,"I got these because I love the colors! When I got them I became aware of how much I love the fabric, too. I would have given them 5 stars were it not for the fact I had to secure the shoe insert they provided with a couple of stitches. It swam around in the shoe, and made it uncomfortable when it landed wrong. Hopefully that will help it out."
4.0,"It was a bit big but given that I could tie it in the back, I made it work.  The bow is heavy and a bit long.  I wore it with a long, high-waisted skirt to a wedding and it was very nice.  Not too low cut.  It has a dressy feel to it.  The color had a little too much taupe in it for me in person (less pale pink, more of a &#34;nude&#34; color) but again, made it work and I got compliments!"
4.0,Washes very well.  I wish it was a little longer though.
4.0,Pretty good but hurt the bridge of the nose
4.0,You stand out in these fun shoes. Nice gold bling. Fun statement shoes. Great value
4.0,"Very cute and soft! If you’re curvy you might want to size up, it has good stretch but the buttons are not strong at all lol. Great fall dress, will order in more colors"
4.0,Nicely made. Very pretty. Could only  be more perfect if it came with an info card about the benefits the stones provide.
4.0,"good quality, worth the $."
4.0,Happy with this t shirt. Much better then another one I purchased.
4.0,It’s very pretty... a little see through but it’s light and comfortable. I got a large because I have a big chest but then it makes it look more casual then dressy.
4.0,"This key chain is perfect, especially as a gift!! The letters are very clear and detailed. Not too heavy and it's overall a great keychain!!"
4.0,"I ordered both the large and extra large. I am a size 12, and I kept the extra large, it is a bit loose, but figured it might shrink when washed. So I do like my purchase, and sent the large back. The colors are not as bright in reality, as opposed to what you see on the screen."
4.0,I liked that it protects my luggage. It’s also stands out on the luggage carrousel. The only issue was the wheels would get stuck when they cover moved down. Need to be very careful the cover is on right before you start to roll it.
4.0,It runs small and is cute. Expected the whole shirt to be knit material but only the sleeve and neck detailing were. Overall it looks like what is online.
4.0,"The elasticity it possesses is just a tad too tight. While the fabric resists runs and tears, it is a bit brighter in color. as well the stockings roll after moving around a bit."
4.0,"Sleeve was out there; not eve, and a way too big for me, but otherwise, nice!"
4.0,This does exactly what it says and is warm and will be good if used for intended purpose. I thought I would get it as a face covering mask but it is difficult to breath when over your face.
4.0,"No matter how I try I can not hang on to a pair of sun glasses,  they are like the missing sock in the washer.  So, over the years I have purchase many, many, pairs but have given up on the $100+ designer models.  These are as advertised, well made, and for the 'price compared to the value' have served their purpose very well."
4.0,"they look nice.  very small though, much more than they look."
4.0,"This dress is so freakin adorable. I love that it's oversized but still flattering. I'm  5'4 and it was the perfect length. Giving it 4 stars because it shrunk when i washed it and i am so bummed. Other than that, it's perfect!"
4.0,When i open the package this is what i received
4.0,"the neck finish is just a strip of bias, not a true facing. This makes the dress look inexpensive. The cotton material has a good hand to it and is not thin. The color Is very vibrant. the fit was ok. The dress is highwaisted for me.  I will keep the dress and use it casually."
4.0,Super cute and fits just right.  The only reason for 4 stars is because it absorbs smells.  I work a grill from time to time and the band smells like it.  I’ve washed it with fragrant soap and hit it with clear dry shampoo but the smell never goes away.  Will try some febreeze next...
4.0,"Good product, Gave it to my neighbor as it was a little big for me."
4.0,Awesome seller!!! The fit a little snug on her neck put she loves them!
4.0,I loved the product but the sizes are way too small for the American Market
4.0,The bonnets are a great change from the old ones I can wear them out and still look cute specially while the cicadas are out here!<br /><br /> thank you!!!
4.0,Fits loose but nice and warm.
4.0,"Nice gloves. Ordered large, but they are a bit too snug."
4.0,"I'll say for the price and the style, this product is pretty all right. Unfortunately for me, I took the gamble of hoping they wouldn't be too big for my small face. My advice for anyone who has a hard time shopping for sunglasses on a small face, don't buy these. Otherwise, it's good value for money. Also, I picked these up at an Amazon locker for the first time, which was super easy and convenient. I was able to get them before I left town!"
4.0,Fits as expected. Light weight and comfortable
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised that this bra fits nicely and is comfortable. The material is very smooth and soft and fits nicely both with the arm straps and around the main band of the bra. The cups fit well also. The only thing I would improve would be to add a bit more support along the areas of both sides, to make the material support more. It allows a bit more stretching out along the sides than I would like it to. If there were perhaps another layer or two added to the sides as they go under the arms, I think this would keep a smoother appearance under there. But, otherwise, I am happy with the fit."
4.0,"It's ok. Wanted this to use while riding a motorcycle,but the eyes are glued on. I'm sure it will come apart. Otherwise. Good for walking. Lol."
4.0,"Really dig this leggings! Comfortable to work out in and for lounging! I think why's best is they are see through, the fabric is pretty solid! Will definity buy from again!"
4.0,Arrived same as picture. Not the softest sweater out there but not scratchy. Decent quality.
4.0,A bit too short for spouse.
4.0,"Just not a very flattering shirt - material okay, did not hang well. Wide neck, didn’t sit right on my shoulders."
4.0,The pink ones are slightly see through when you bend over or squat.
4.0,"This is really poofy but tons of fun for a costume (I was Victoria Kann's &#34;Pinkalicious&#34; at our elementary school library Halloween gathering).  Also, the &#34;one size&#34; fit I would guess to fit up to a ladies size 14.  I'm a 10 and wore it comfortably over jeans with room to spare.  It's basic:  just a piece of elastic with tulle, but sturdy."
4.0,"Absolutely love it. It’s perfect for convenience and the articles I need to have on me. The only thing I did not like is some color is already wearing off, the snaps open and one of the seams was not well seen. The cost should reflect better quality. I do love this item though. It’s exactly what I needed and I love that it’s the traditional Wonder Woman."
4.0,Great T-shirt but i would recommend sizing up if you want a more relaxed fit.
4.0,Glasses are nice quality.  Be sure to read how big these actually are.  I'm 6'5&#34; 320 ( with what I thought to be a big head ) and I can't where these.  They are just too big for me.
4.0,"Great shower sandal, good for college students who share showers or people who take showers at the gym."
4.0,"Nice shoe .  Comfortable and cute<br /> Easy to put on and take off . They look cute with slacks , jeans , casual skirts and summer dresses . I have a pair just for inside the house only ."
4.0,Very comfortable socks. First pair I've ever had and they motivated me to purchase more. My legs and feet are less swollen.
4.0,"My baby wears 12-18 month clothes, so that's what I ordered. Clearly the outfit is 18-24 months, or runs a size large. I am returning it and hoping the smaller size isn't too small and arrives before her party Saturday!"
4.0,LOVE! Wore this shirt to work with black dress pants and a chunky statement necklace and got so many compliments! The one bad thing is that if you have a large chest the stitching across the chest will hit you in a weird spot.
4.0,"I like these argyle socks a lot.  I like the block pattern, which is a little bit of a twist on traditional argyles that have thin lines mixed into the pattern.  These have an even bolder look.  The colors pop and the assortment has great color combinations.  The material is lightweight if not a bit thin, but they're comfortable and well made.  I wear a size 11 shoe and these large fit me perfectly, despite being listed for shoes sizes from 12-16 and sock size 13-16 (not sure why they list two sizes).  Overall I'm really digging these bright and cheerful socks."
4.0,"Zipper pocket scarf is soft & cozy for colder temps. It is wide, maybe 12” wide. Scarf is long enough to twist in half & fit over my head. It’s comfortable to wear."
4.0,"Material a bit on the side, but very nice Top"
4.0,Cute top. It’s a workout/ yoga top but you could get away with wearing it out. The material is light but not thin. The color is rich and flattering. I only gave it 4 stars because I didn’t fall in love with it.
4.0,Pretty watch. So far it is keeping good time . I bought it about 3 months ago. I love the bracelet band.
4.0,"I really like this dress, especially for the price. I ordered the XL large because I'm busty 40DD. It fit perfect across the top and shoulders. It was a little loose across the hips, but didn't take away from overall look. I received a lot of compliments on this dress. Overall I'm very pleased."
4.0,These are just the rigt size to go with the necklace my husband just gave me.  They are classy and don't hurt my ears. Love them!
4.0,"Looks just like the pictures shown. I bought it to wear at a wedding as I needed a formal look, and for the price I paid it did the job perfectly at no high expense. The hour sphere has a nice size for small-medium wrists, I also like that it has a &#34;day&#34; and &#34;number&#34; window, which I really enjoy as I'm always wondering what day I'm in. The &#34;day&#34; window comes in English and Chinese, I still haven't figured out if it shows both languages along during the day or if there is a way of setting it to English only. The polished stainless steel wrist band strap looks really good, it comes in a size for thick wrists and it is adaptable to thin wrists by taking off detachable links -any watchmaker can help with that-. The folding clasp feels kind of flimsy, although I don't think it will fall or anything as it has a safety lock. It comes in a professional box package with a guarantee card and instructions. For a $20 bucks watch, it's pretty nice. I'll be wearing it on a daily basis now looking good and not worrying if it gets damaged or lost :)  Makes a good present too."
4.0,Comfortable to the max!!! Good socks.
4.0,To my surprise this product does go up my arms NOT TIGHT NOT TOO LOOSE IT FITS
4.0,"I wish the light would also light up the analog watch part and not just the digital part, which I could care less about, because the hands of the analog part actually obstruct the view of the digital displays, depending on what time it is."
4.0,"So far so good. It's the perfect size for my not-so-little dancer. Her expanding dance equipment (shoes, pants, props, etc) means she needs a larger, better organized bag. I was looking for something that had the capacity of one of the other dance bags without BEING one of the other dance bags she sees atthe studio. This one is almost perfect. If it had a water bottle holder on the side I would give it 5 stars."
4.0,Nice quality.  Nice detail.  Like that's it is reversible.
4.0,It fit my daughter perfectly.  She loved the top.  The quality is okay but overall is a great shirt.
4.0,Great jockeys. But wish I buy large size.
4.0,"This is a perfect collection for around the house. The carabiners are consumer quality. You would not want to use them to hang from while rock climbing, but they are great for keys, tags, holding stuff on your backpack, etc."
4.0,I have gotten this for my 8 years old nephew 's pool party and all the kids love them... definitely worth it... I even kept a yellow pair 4 me... they are well made for the price
4.0,"The skirt was longer than anticipated, with it going between my daughter's chest and belly button, and still being knee length. It did shrink in the wash, and the belt doesn't really serve a purpose other than being a decoration."
4.0,Pay attention the compression numbers. Make sure that is what you want.
4.0,runs a little loose on the sleeves.
4.0,This is a beautiful cape. The ribbons that tie in front came loose but I was able to sew them back on.  I ordered a bit larger than I thought I’d need and I’m very happy with it.
4.0,"Only reason it gets 4 stars is because they fit slightly small.....My family is in a play at the community theater. They required us to wear a long black leggings...but the temperatures have been so hot, and their air conditioning went out! It's been so hot! I searched high & low in town for long black leggings made of COOLING fabric ...and came up empty-handed! Thank you Amazon, for carrying what our local Walmart did not have in stock! These pants work fantastic for cooling us down!! Highly recommended!!! (Order one size up!)"
4.0,"Love this thing! It has been a life saver for pumping hands free at work. I wear it to work and works seamlessly when its time to pump! I highly suggest getting this if you plan on pumping at work or even for exclusively pumping moms. Only thing is that the little clip thats supposed to go on your nursing bra doesn't actually *CLICK* right into the bra. It still works but it would have been nice to have that security of it clicking right into place so it doesn't fall off of it by accident. FYI, I use an Isabel Maternity nursing bra that I got from Target."
4.0,Cute and Made well but too big for kids. 3 pairs had scratches on lens but the rest were perfect!
4.0,"Nice product, good fit"
4.0,"It arrived too late, not very useful, unless you use two at a time<br />not some think i would recommend"
4.0,"Great summer hat. Not happy that the hat arrived folded and creased. I wetted, flatten, and let it dry. Great price!"
4.0,Bikini fits perfect
4.0,"Holding up from the washer.<br />So far sod good, no complaints yet."
4.0,"I ordered this bra because my size 38E is not in regular stores. I was so happy to find one that was not only, in my size, but pretty as well. It came way earlier than anticipated and it fit me perfectly. I have lift and shape and I feel amazing in this bra. I will be purchasing more from this company."
4.0,Beautiful dress wish it fit my height
4.0,Very Nice - love the colors.
4.0,"I wish they were a little lonjger. I am 6'4&#34;, and since sock manufacturers are unwilling to spend the extra fabric making quality TRUE knee-high socks, when wearing these with socks that are mid-calf, they are not long enough (even fully extended). However, the quality of the band and clasp is excellent. I have very expensive bespoke shirts, and none of them have been damaged by these shirt stays. even considering they pull a little too hard with the lack of length."
4.0,"I’m 5’3” and about 195. I ordered and XL and the fit is great. The front hits just above my knees and the back hits just below. Overall it’s a very nice silhouette. My plan was to wear it with tights and boots, and I think it would look great. My only issue is that the back panel is two pieces with a seam down the middle. I really don’t understand why, as the front is one piece. It makes the print in the back very choppy and the front & back look like two different dresses. The dress in the photo very clearly has a back panel that is a single piece. I am a little obsessive about the symmetry of my clothing, so I may return it just because of that, but if that wouldn’t bother you it’s a really cute dress."
4.0,It's a beautiful and versatile belt.  The release is sometimes difficult to release as it is more discreetly located than another version that I have of this kind of belt. The buckle is extremely HEAVY.
4.0,"For being 'big and tall' socks, I was surprised that they are no bigger around the ankle than my regular sized gold toes. I wear size 13-14 shoe, but my ankles aren't very wide, so this is a little disappointing. They are otherwise well made and have a quality feel to them."
4.0,"**EDIT** SO AFTER MY INITAL REVIEW MY DAUGHTER LOOKED AT THIS CAPE AND TRIED IT ON AND IT FIT HER VERY NICELY. SHE IS A MUCH SMALLER BUILD SO IT IS MY FEELING THAT THIS CAPE WOULD BE BETTER FIT AND STYLE FOR SMALLER WOMEN. FOR THAT REASON I AM CHANGING MY ORIGINAL RATING AND NOT BIASING IT ON THE SHAPE AND FIT FOR ONE BODY STYLE.<br /><br /> I bought this for my wife for a Christmas themed party and she was not pleased at all. The arm cut outs was entirely to high. She could not easily move her arms. Barely could get her hands out. The color was beautiful and she felt, if it would of fit better, would of kept her warm. I feel this would be better for a shorter person perhaps. She is 5'5"" tall."
4.0,Very comfortable. Great back and side coverage.  Love the removable pads. I'm a 36C and the large firs perfect.  It's my go to bra now!
4.0,I love the medallion. I didn't like the chain and I have already replaced it.
4.0,"He's controversial but that's why we like him, AB! Arrived on time , as decribed and well made. Fits well too."
4.0,Was amazing until I washed it and the pads inside became completely hard.
4.0,This print goes with the farmhouse style I have in my kitchen and is super cute. It's definitely a lot bigger than I anticipated. Im giving 4 stars because I wish the draw strings had the little stoppers on them. I had to tie a knot in the bottom one to keep it from expanding and dumping the bags out.
4.0,It’s more than expected<br />It was a gift they loved it
4.0,"My wife is a member of several flower clubs and her favorite color is red so this was a no-brainer. Her iPhone 5C in an OtterBox Defender case fits just fine. The only problem we have is that the clasp is not quite long enough so that the pouch does not snap shut. The phone fits snugly enough, however, so I doubt that it will accidentally fall out. If it weren't for that, I would have given the 5th star."
4.0,"Wore these with some open toed booties that normally cut into my little toe after a trip to church. They work! Wore them for date and had no hurt toes. Their a bit of a hassle to put on, but once their on they stay in place and I couldn't even feel them when wearing."
4.0,Great fit and comfortable nice material
4.0,although i return the socks i would like to give it a good review because the of the quality of made. i returned it because of the size.
4.0,"Nice band, but noticeably thicker than other vendors. This is probably good for men, but for a women's wrist it is a bit thicker than I personally like. But good color, easy to change, and I am sure it will be durable. Fits my Withings Activite Pop perfectly."
4.0,I liked this pair of pants.<br />Fit as I expected it and looks nice.<br />Made with good quality materials.<br />Easy to clean.
4.0,Great for the price. The coating is a bit too much for me but I like them a lot. Good quality.
4.0,Cute fit!
4.0,Perfect for my cosplay idea! Its comfortable and came in the exact shade I was looking for!
4.0,"Needed some alterations (those sleeves are long), but attractive and comfortable.  It doesn't seem to take wrinkles very easily, either."
4.0,"These are very cute, and inexpensive. ..but pay attention!  You get only 1 &#34;shoe&#34; even though the pictures show two. It does say this in the description of the product."
4.0,Decent pair of shorts. Seem to be good for squats.
4.0,Not easy to fit in the frame because the shape of the lens was not exactly the same shape as original but once you tightened frames w/ screw the frame molds to them and works out. There is a slight gap around the inside near the nose but for $25 its worth it to be able to wear them again.
4.0,"I love this top, it’s so versatile, but I was hoping the fit would be a bit tighter. I ordered a small and am usually an XS"
4.0,They were as described. Solid build. Priced right.
4.0,Fits as expected. Looks great with a wide black belt added.
4.0,"Good size. It arrived with no damages. Little small on my husband head, but was going to tilt it down anyway. Sturdy. Nice product. I tried it on my head, and it fit perfectly. So be wise on how large of a head you may use it for. If your going to use for a male, may have to go bigger. Fits great for women and men with smaller heads.  Otherwise definitely worth it. Nice sturdy product. Great price."
4.0,Cute & soft.
4.0,This is comfortable and cute and awesome. I wear it once a week and it is still doing great.
4.0,"I bought these glasses for my 11 year old daughter.  She loves them!  The quality is pretty good.  Plus, I'm glad they came with a black fabric case.  However, I agree with some of the other reviews.  These glasses are suited for a child due to sizing.  They are too small for me."
4.0,Very pretty and big enough to see them.  Good buy.
4.0,The  charms are super cute. I bought to put on thin black leather rope necklace. The hole is small to thread so I had to purchase jump rings also. But the necklace turned out well. I bought these for a group of 8 year olds who play ice hockey as a small gift.
4.0,"This is indeed a beautiful hat, dark red and well designed.  As it's offered as a women's hat, I expected it to be slightly smaller than the men's version but not so.  While I will keep it I'm still trying to find the right position so it sits properly - not too forward, not too low."
4.0,"Loved, loved the dress but... the belt has weird colors which are green, red, white and black. No one noticed those weird colors. Wore the dress for a wedding, even the bride loved my dress!."
4.0,The leg pieces were a bit small
4.0,Nice fit runs very large
4.0,the pants are at least 3 inches too long.  longer than any other pants in this size.  She cant wear them unless i trim them .<br /><br />the top is cute and looks cute with cable knit tights
4.0,I wouldn't recommend this product unless you own a strapless bra because this is BEYOND see-through. It's a nice shirt but fits a bit large and I ordered a small (which is what I usually order).
4.0,Perfect fit would reorder. Sorry not available in more colors
4.0,I love this outfit. It fits well and runs true to size. It's a little short so I cuffed the bottoms and it worked out perfectly. Lots of compliments as well. 4 stars instead of 5 just because of the length.
4.0,I do love the ring and will keep!  Price is great!
4.0,"perfect fit, love the color, love the quality of build but unhandy to get on and off. wish it was a straight buckle.  would purchase again.  wish there were more color choices"
4.0,Cute and comfy but way longer than I expected. Im 5'9 and it came to my knees.
4.0,"Works great. A little warmer than expected, but it's summer."
4.0,This dress is very comfortable. It is a little larger than I thought it would be but still great.
4.0,"I have a terrible time finding pants that are comfortable and still look good.  These jeggings fit the bill!  Super comfortable and look like you're wearing jeans, not leggings.  Only wish they were a few inches longer.  I'm 5'8&#34;, 135 and ordered M/L."
4.0,Very nice but the bottom part was too big. But nice fabric and feel!
4.0,"Love the shirt (style & color), but the arms are a little small."
4.0,"I love the design & quality of this ring & the spinners work well. Unfortunately I had to return it because the sizing is off. The ring bows in towards the center, making it about a half size smaller & too tight on my finger. Wish these came in half sizes because exchanging this for a full size bigger would make it too loose."
4.0,"For reference I measure 32-26-36 and I am 5'7. I ordered the Small.<br />I was extremely sceptical about ordering this dress. Especially when there are little to no reviews on a product. However, I took the gamble and ordered it for our family christmas pictures. I am overwhelmingly pleased with the quality of this product. It's a tighter fit but very stretchy. Polyester & Spandex. The fabric is also much thicker than I was expecting. I bought a slip to wear underneath just to be safe in case you could see through, but you could probably get away without one. I've washed in cold water and dried on delicate (low heat) and still looks like new and did not shrink. I gave 4 stars because the sleeves are a bit short, but maybe that's just because I'm a little lanky. Other than that, I would most definitely recommend this dress!"
4.0,These are comfortable basic high ankle coverage socks. For minimal cost.
4.0,My experience with assurant is hit and miss.  Sometimes it is great other times it is a shameful money grab without adequate resolution.
4.0,The reality is it individual watch band is 50 bucks you're able to get 10 for the price of one the quality for the price is extremely well very easy to secure on wrist my only called out would be the quality of the clasp that holds the watchband to your wrist but other than that well worth the price spent
4.0,These are a nice soft cotton that feel great and fit me nicely. I will buy these again in the future. I hope they stay the same.
4.0,I got them early. Came w 2 of them. They didn't come w any backs. Not sure if I like them or not...
4.0,"The fabric on this is so soft and it is constructed well but, it is very see-through. As you can see in the photo even with a white undershirt the sleeves are still see through. I think if you chose a darker color it would probably be fine. This top was a little snug on me as well. Especially in the chest. I ordered the 2x and I am a size 18 US with F cup breasts. I think if you were a 16 or 14. This would fit perfectly."
4.0,It somewhat small but very pretty. I should have sent it back but I think I just need to loose a couple of more pounds and I think it will be do-able.
4.0,This is a nice case for the Amazfit Bip
4.0,Very cute. Not as pink as in the picture
4.0,I was so happy When I got these! So many compliments! They sparkle and are delicate but haven't broken! I have lost one though And not sure how it fell out
4.0,"i like these, they are so cute! the ears get a bit floppy after a while, but i just put the ears back because some other people have done that too. :)"
4.0,I thought I ordered all black. I don't like the colors in the pack for my son. I have to have dark colors with him due to them getting dirty looking while at  school.
4.0,Beautiful! Enough room to carry the essentials.
4.0,"The compression sock company I bought compression socks from when I first began wearing compression socks 10 years ago caved to the pressure of Chinese competition (surprisingly considerign even the Chinese are expensive when it comes to compression socks), and ever since I have been trying to find compression socks that fit.  Literally after trying approximately a dozen ""brands"" from Chona and allegedly Italy, so far only one pair has not been grossly oversized.  I ama medium, and teh compression socks I receive from the Chinese companies I would classify as XXL, not large, at the very least an XL if not XXL.  Only one pair of the approximate dozen I tried have fit.  Those were very thin and had barely noticeable compression.  Now to these....<br /><br />If these were not marketted as compression socks, I'd rate them 5 stars.  They are genuinel a perfect fit.  Not at all irregular.  They are remarkably comfortable, and unlike any compression sock I have ever stepped foot into, these are considerably thicker though not thick like a pair of winter wool socks, just very thick for compression socks.  They are remarkably comfortable, but...  and here comes the part that keeps them from a 5 star rating...  I do not notice any compression at all.  I'd be surprised if the max compresion anywhere along these socks exceeds 15 mmHg.  However, as just a pair of socks.  They are a perfect fit, nothing irregular as with so many Chinese soscks.  The materail has that classic 100% southern cotton feel of teh good ole days though I doubt it is 100% cotton and considering the very fine cotton of the very hot and humid southern united states has been crowded out of the market by Carribean and Egpytian cotton, it almost certainly isn't the good ole fashioned southern cotton grown in the hot humid gulf south of the United States which for centuries seemed the perfect conditions for growing very soft cotton, but darn the heat and humidity was hard for anyone to bear, even with large combines and instruments."
4.0,"The necklace is as advertised, but it arrived with one unglued catch."
4.0,"Good Quality. Daughter appreciated it. Consists of tie, robe and a fastener to hold robe closed."
4.0,Fits like expected..super cute
4.0,"Really like this umbrella. Pretty sturdy, looks great and fits nicely into my shoulder bag whenever I head out. Really smooth opening and closing feature. I thought it was going to be bigger once it was open and that's why I gave it 4 stars. Next time I would buy a bigger size. Love it though."
4.0,"Very shiny, a little too shiny for my taste but it'll do."
4.0,I love this i have 1 and my bff has the other half its thick well made and we both keep it on 24/7 it's durable and hasnt tarnished. Would have given 5 star but had to buy necklaces separately because 1 came broke and the other was super thin and cheap
4.0,"Thin material, but it is a cute print."
4.0,"I received a medium size blouse for review and I was surprised at how well it fit.  I'm 5'9"", 142 pounds and a 34B.  It looks great, feels good and though I don't much like anything off the shoulders this blouse doesn't make me feel naked since it has shoulder straps.  The material is very light weight but not see-through since it has a soft inner lining.  It's a pretty blouse and will look great with a pair  of skinny jeans.  It seems to be well sewn and looks exactly like the picture on the product page.  I placed it in a mesh bag and washed it with the regular laundry but hung it up to dry and it looks fine."
4.0,Smashes my nose a bit. Nice to keep an alias.
4.0,"So Cute!  After reading the other reviews, I ordered one  size up and were ok but a little tight at the tip...I have wide feet but they seem that they might stretch with time..."
4.0,smaller then i was expecting. that's what she said... :(
4.0,It's beautiful but within 3 months the color kinda fades ... I guess value for money it ok then
4.0,"It fit well, but the stickiness is not ver good around the edges. It may just be because of the heavy weight. But overall it did what it was supposed to."
4.0,Flimsy and thin plastic fabric but it was a funny cheap gift.
4.0,They are longer than I expected but very nice.  Fun to wear
4.0,Product works as advertised
4.0,"it clips on, it flips down or up, it serves its purpose"
4.0,"They are comfortable, bumps on the insole are a little ruff though"
4.0,"Okay, I LOVE these. They are a soft and prettier version of a granny panty, so they are attractive but comfortable. Nice compromise between comfort and sex appeal. They come up really high, so my Mommy tummy is well contained.  Just be sure to size UP -- As in WAY up. I would normally wear an XL. I suspected these would be pretty small, so I took a chance on 3XL. Turns out that's about right. I was disappointed that I did not receive them in all the colors shown. No pink or blue. I received two DIFFERENT shades of taupe, and 2 black.  Oh, well. Nobody sees my panties, anyway, except my husband, and he couldn't care less what color they are!"
4.0,"Super cute. I usually wear a size small, but read other reviews and ordered an X-small. I’m 5 foot and they were a little long but not too long :)"
4.0,"I'm a 34G, ordered a large and it's really loose. I'm exchanging for a medium. It's flowy and stretchy the sequence are attached well, quality material and it's not itchy at all. I'll update when the medium comes. I really liked the length but I just couldn't make the bust work. We shall see! I suggest you don't size up if you are unsure.<br /><br />Ok I got the medium and love it! This shirt runs big. If you have a big bust and small waist don't order up like you probably do normally. Thank god for free returns, I'm sending back the large."
4.0,Order it a little bigger
4.0,"The higher front was slightly too high for comfort, I was concerned I would be showing off too much if not paying attention. Otherwise very cute."
4.0,This sweater was okay but the sleeve length is not long enough for tall women. I am 5’9 so sleeves and front of shirt were on the shorter side. Also the sweater had a funky smell but I’m sure after a nice wash it would be just fine.
4.0,"I have coveted this necklaces partner necklace filled in with black stones for years, so when I saw this necklace I was delighted. I thought it would be the perfect compliment to any outfit with the blank center. I also purchased the replica sister necklace from this seller with the black stones in the center, Many friends have asked if I splurged and treated myself to the expensive necklace over my dreams and its partner necklace from the jewelry store. The necklace is well made and the stones are well placed, I have worn it in the shower and to bed and there has been no discoloration from the chain or the pendant. I marked this necklace down a star because unlike its sister necklace from the same seller this necklace had a very cheap looking chain with large loops. It was just not very flattering with this delicate pendant so I had to switch out the chain to give the necklace the proper charm.<br />I did receive a discount on this item in exchange for my honest review. If you found this review helpful please click the button below. Thanks."
4.0,My daughters like it and they said that it is very comfortable.<br />The material is not very sturdy but it does serves its purpose.
4.0,"Very cute and a good deal for the price. They probably won't last long, but again, for the price, I'm not complaining."
4.0,"This bra fits but because I have had both breasts removed it rolls up . does not stay in place.<br />It is better than other bras I have purchased, but I cannot find just the right one.<br />Looked and tried mastectomy bras sold by sites that sell these for cancer patients , but they<br />Rise up. It is like I put on a bra 3 sizes too big for me and when I raise my arms. It goes up to my neck.<br />I did call and ask them to make a criss- cross bra. I know this would work, But the sites are not interested in doing this"
4.0,My son thinks he's da man when he wears this belt. Great fit!
4.0,"The chain wasn’t long enough for my liking, but it is beautiful."
4.0,"Thinner than expected, they still fit my Fan well - and greatly compliment his Gravity Falls costume...<br />WATCH OUT, COMICON 2017!!"
4.0,I ordered the blue in xl and maybe should have gotten a large. The top was a little too loose but overall ok. I love this dress and will be ordering more in different colors.
4.0,"The dress is pretty, but it runs small and if you are big chested this dress is not for you as the top part of the wrap doesn’t cover well."
4.0,"Nice fit, waist band sits a bit higher, just touches my navel, far less &#34;muffin top&#34; than with other lower waisted types.  I'm not the type to baby my laundry, so they are washed in warm water and tumble dried on normal setting, and so far holding up well. The only thing I don't like is they do seem to attract lint quite a bit.  The length was all the way to my ankle despite being a &#34;capri&#34; and I'm 5' 7&#34;, but after a few washing/dryings the length is mid calf, where I like them to be."
4.0,They are good for exercise and they look great
4.0,"Pendant is adequate.  However, I had no idea that it was made in China."
4.0,"I loved the purse,had to return it because I was sent the wrong color. I was disappointed because it was very nicely made."
4.0,There’s no tag to identify which is the back or front
4.0,Not the best fitting inner mask shields but at least you can breathe easier!
4.0,They are nice shorts. No stretch other than the waste.
4.0,"I loved the dress, the material, colors, etc... were great. However, since I'm not that busty... the Large was way too big up top... I returned it and purchased the medium. Still waiting for my new order to be mailed out."
4.0,Hat is totally roomy. Perfect for a head like mine. I think the brim is a little longer than I am used to. so I will give the rating  four stars.
4.0,"This bra. Boy oh boy. When I first put it on, I was psyched at how comfortable it was. As soon as I had to stretch or move, my excitement went down quite a bit. This bra starts to come unzipped at the slightest movement. A very deep breath can cause the zipper to budge. There are pads built into the bra for the purpose of what I assume would be to cover the nipples. I'm not a fan of those. Normally, bras have an open slot in order to remove that extra padding and this bra doesn't offer this feature. I will probably have to cut a small hole and remove them myself. As for the zipper, i'll probably have to get a safety pin to hold it up. I received this product at a discount in order to review. I think that if this product is to move forward, they need to add something above the zipper to lock it into place."
4.0,Light weight better then I expected.
4.0,A little cheaply made but were get for my halloween costume. Fit great. A tad heavy but it wasnt bad. Have to put them over some thing round because of the they it is shipped.
4.0,Should of gone with a medium in size.
4.0,"The bag is bigger than I expected which is great. It has a lot of pockets which is very useful. The color is vibrant and zipper is pretty sturdy. The hook to hang the bag is strong and hangs pretty straight upright. Overall to carry makeup and hygiene stuff for a carry-on luggage it is pretty great for the price I paid. So, I recommend it."
4.0,"I purchased this item to use for me & my family while we traveled to Massachusetts. My only complaint was that once you blew up the pillow it was difficult to deflatting it. Other than that I loved the product. It fit nicely in my carry on bag & was easy to put back together before we got off the plane. It makes a nice soft pillow too, if you don't want to unzip it"
4.0,"The largest bead is 10mm, the photos in the listing make the beads appear to be much larger than they are. That doesn't stop this from being a very pretty bracelet. It has a nice weight to it. I like the adjustability.<br /><br />I wish it came packaged nicer for gift-giving. There isn't anything explaining it is the solar system, not even on the label on the bag. It would be nice to have an explanation of the stones and what they represent."
4.0,"Perfect as a stadium purse. It fits all the essentials and then some...phone, keys, small wallet and sunglasses."
4.0,comfy and good quality.
4.0,These are awesome. Fit as expected live the colors and most of all my feet are out.
4.0,"Good shades, but it would be nice if they came with a band to keep on kids heads."
4.0,Soft good fabric. Stretchy and cute but also gets that overwork feeling fast.
4.0,I do not have skinny legs by any means and this fits just right at the thigh. I am pairing this with the Tartanista Womans Irish Tartan Skirt and the skirt just covers the top of the socks.  Comfortable on and stay up.
4.0,Comfy but runs big and will need to be front tucked or gathered.
4.0,"Tela liviana, algo amplias y seca el sudor rápido, colores muy bonitos, valen la pena para el entrenamiento diario"
4.0,"This is just what I was looking for.  I usually wear a large but I like outwear and layering pieces a bit bigger. I would say that this is true to size and keep in mind how you will be wearing it and with what.  The material is soft and thin. It falls to your sides like shown in the picture, not something that will stay closed or fitted on your bust. I am 5'4 and this comes down to just above my ankles.  This piece looks great with legging and a fitted top. I would consider this more style than function.  I am concerned about fuzzing or pilling with frequent washings so that is something I would caution anyone on and will be mindful of that. but since this is an outer cardigan, I don't really see the need to wash very often.  So happy I found this on the lightning deal and you can't go wrong even at full price.<br /><br />If my review helped you, please click the helpful button. Or comment if I can answer any other questions &#60;3"
4.0,"This necklace  is even more beatiful in person , I'm very pleased."
4.0,"I loved the length and width to accommodate for my growing baby belly, the sleeves were pretty  tight at the cuffs though."
4.0,"did not give me the comfort i needed ,to work out in ."
4.0,Reminds me of Princess Di's Wedding ring.  A little too high for my liking but it is still very pretty.
4.0,"Arrived quickly, no problems found when inspected. Fix just like it said, very nice. I'll get more when needed."
4.0,"Product is alright quality thought it was going to a softer feel, but its ok."
4.0,Loved it!  Fast!
4.0,"I liked the look and feel, it fit perfectly and adjust wells, but the fabric does wear really fast and looks like it shreds"
4.0,"I purchased this shirt for the bonus item that was supposed to come with the shirt.  It was a holiday themed unicorn baseball hat.  I thought my niece would love it.  It was not included with the shirt.  I ordered the shirt in mid-November, and it finally arrived mid-January.  2 months is a long time to wait for a purchase and then not get what you were expecting.<br />Aside from that, the shirt itself was like a running shirt, smooth & silky, which my niece liked.  And the size was perfect."
4.0,Got this for my mom’s birthday in December and it’s just lovely. The box makes it look super expensive. The stone is very clear and the chain is pretty good.
4.0,These are good quality at a great price. I love the laces so I can tie them tighter to make my little guy keep them on longer. My only complaint is that they seem to scuff easily. I bought the 12-18 month size for my big 10 month old and they fit well.
4.0,This is perfect to wrap presents.
4.0,These rings are adjustable to fix all finger sizes.
4.0,Road trip chaperone
4.0,"Linda, aunque más chica de lo que pensaba."
4.0,"En la imagen estoy usando los colores que más se ven , los demás son tonos muy apagados , no se parecen a la imagen , pero aparte de eso , son muy bonitos."
4.0,They are a little warmer then I expected
4.0,"These are nice to clip on over my regular glasses.  They do reduce glare from headlights, but not quite as much as I would prefer.  The also help as regular sunglasses when not looking in the direction the Sun is shining.  {Of course, no sunglasses I have used help much when looking directly into the rising or setting Sun."
4.0,Picture was deceptive
4.0,"Good quality baja, but seems to run large compared to the others we have in the house."
4.0,"Great value, look great"
4.0,"Stunning and well made, but it is assumed that a size 16 would fit an average height woman of that size, this gorgeous dress seems to be made for a giant"
4.0,Give me the four star only because there were too short for someone that tall but super cute and true to size
4.0,"The small was still big and the coat feels good though, not to thin!"
4.0,"Really love this dress, so cute!! The lining underneath is a little short for me, but isn’t too bad. I wore all day at work and was so comfortable! The material is a tad wrinkleyyyy, but it would happen even if it was at a high end boutique. Really love this’"
4.0,"I wish it was made of canvas instead of plastic, which is what it feels and looks like, but other than that i love this bag."
4.0,"Shoes is worth the buy, can't find something wrong with those other than it was a little to big for my daughter."
4.0,"Shipping on time! Product was packaged perfectly! Rose gold compliments the watch. Smaller band doesn't make it so bulky, working in healthcare it really helps."
4.0,Love these so much!!! They are very easy to switch out and I love the color options!
4.0,Very cute and nice for. Not recommend if you plan on doing cardio or lifting weight. Material doesn't breath.
4.0,It is a cute dress. I bought it for my daughter who stands 5'7&#34; and the &#34;dress&#34; is really to short! She has to wear leggings under it. The model wearing it in the picture shown must be short. It is also slightly see through. We got the Yellow color. We will keep it as a long shrit for summer. But a little bummed it is so short.
4.0,Good quality product. Minus one star for lack of face protection.
4.0,I really like these pants but they fit a little smaller than expected. I’ve ordered a few of these and for some reason these particular pair were smaller than the most.<br />Very soft material
4.0,The color is very diferent than picture.
4.0,"I love it, it's very nice I was not disappointed"
4.0,"These boots are pretty well made. The calf fits perfectly, though the foot part is a little too wide for me. A thick pair of socks helps"
4.0,Very soft. Great quality fabric. Flattering for curves!
4.0,Was too small for me but ended up giving to my elderly neighbor
4.0,It fits nicely and the quality of the material is very good.  An excellent buy for the price.  I highly recommend it.
4.0,I got my suit today and I love it. I'm 5'2&#34; 145lbs and I ordered an Xl. I have a butt and breast so I opted for an Xl instead of a l. It's Asian sizes so usually you go at least 2 sizes up. I normally buy medium bottoms and large top for my swimsuits.
4.0,These look great but are a little too tight  and tall for me. Will be giving them to one of my taller friends
4.0,Nice flows and comfortable dress. Lightweight and fits true to size. My only complaint is that the sleeves ride up a little and the elastic gets uncomfortable so I had to pull up the sleeves to find a different spot. Length is spot on and comes right above my ankles. Still a great dress.
4.0,"This Long Sleeve Men's White shirt by Bentibo, is made from 100% cotton. I normally wear between a medium and a large depending on the cut of the shirt. My sports coats and suits are between a 41 and 42, again, depending on the cut of the coat. I ordered a Large in this shirt, and could barely button it. But, I do have broad shoulders. Had I done anything, like flex, or stretch, I would have popped every button on the shirt. So, this shirt runs small. And it is a slim fit style shirt. Which I do like very much. Just size up when ordering.<br />The overall appearance of the shirt is nice, especially with a blue sport coat and jeans. The blue collar really sets it off, as well as the blue buttons. Also, the tail of the shirt is nice and long. So you have plenty of tail to tuck in, or leave out. I'm 6ft. and hate shirts that are constantly pulling up. Not a problem with this shirt. This shirt is VERY thin, and single stitched. But seems well made.  Being white, makes it almost see through. Great for the summer months. I have some Izod shirts that are almost identical in material, just different colors. This shirt looks great with a pair of jeans, with or without the sport coat. Being 100% cotton though, be prepared to iron this shirt. Also, do not wash in hot water. And dry on low heat. And if you'll take it out of the dryer, before the cycle ends, it will be a lot easier if you need to iron. Some like the crumpled look with a pair of jeans. While others may not. That's entirely up to the individual. I can't wear a wrinkled shirt myself. Being cotton, this shirt will starch very well. The main thing when ordering this shirt, is size up when ordering. And take care when washing and drying. Or it will shrink.<br />I received my shirt discounted for an honest review of the shirt. Everything I said is the truth. Thanks for reading."
4.0,"Were it not labeled a &#34;trucker&#34; hat, then it would be too tall, but it is as advertised."
4.0,"Out of the 40 we received, 4 of them were broke.  They definitely are cheaply made, but I believe they all are.  The kids loved them."
4.0,"Everything I need for the gym on the go fits well in this drawstring backpack. The only con I have is that it has a very loose, slippery material. Plastic bottles can slip out of its pockets if not holding the bag properly."
4.0,"One of the straps that I use the most has already broken. They have a small rubber band like thing where the loop fits around the arm of the pair of glasses. It has broken, when ever it slides down the arm of the glasses and needs to be tightened it wears the little rubber band down."
4.0,This is a nice fitting jumper that flatters your shape and also exposes any lumps so be wary. Can easily be dressed up.
4.0,Nice but the inside is plastic tubing that looks like it was melted together to seal the ends. I have larger hands and was worried I will break one by squeezing it on. But the work is nice and looks good on.
4.0,Just like the last one.
4.0,"The dress is very pretty. I ended up getting the beige one, but still very pretty. Runs slightly big on top, but the detail and quality is very good."
4.0,Had to return for a smaller size...didn't fit my smartwatch.
4.0,"Our arms are a bit larger than the models and so it fits tight there, but otherwise it's a pleasant and strong fit! :) Love the feel!"
4.0,Very nice small front pocket wallet. I appreciate the little coin slots which I keep a few quarters in. The construction is decent the material is too. I suspect I will get close to a year of daily use out of it. This is the only type of wallet I use and this one is a pretty decent one.
4.0,"A bit faded of a print, but what can you do for this band? Shoulders were tighter than average for this T. Acceptable to me overall."
4.0,"Fit as expected, I'm 6ft tall and the length was past my fingertips. It was a little large in the upper back, but it's a shift style and my torso isn't  large. It isn't lined so I recommend nude undergarments, but it was perfect for a summer graduation."
4.0,Purchased for a high school graduate and he loved it!
4.0,I've been wearing 2Undrs for a few years. They were promoted at golf stores. They're like angel's hands cupping your boys. Do yourself a favor and get them. My only complaint is they only last a year or so before the threading comes apart.
4.0,"A nice dress. However, I have to safety pin the bosom or else my b**bs will fall right out! Lol not right away but after a few hours because the overlapping of fabric on the chest is not secured up high enough and the stretch of this dress is that of which there is a very slight issue of the fabric not restricting back into its shape. It has a lot of stretch but just not as much retraction. Also, it seems a bit less expensive as far as fabrics go. It feels fine, but it’s almost like the print was pressed onto one side of the fabric like paint and not died completely through. The opposite side of the dress is basically white still... not as you’d expect like most floral dress fabrics- where the print can be seen from either side. The length is OK... it is not at all too short- but basically a very tasteful knee length. I do enjoy wearing this dress and I think  it was a good purchase."
4.0,It kept riding up but I felt very sexy. Husband couldn’t keep his hands off me. If you have a belly just know it will show
4.0,Fit as expected. Soft and comfortable.
4.0,"I think this is a great little dress, especially for the price. It's a lightweight fabric perfect for the sticky hot days of summer... but it's not see-through. I purchased a Small, which fits me very well (for reference: I am 5'3'' and 125 lbs, with a short torso and 34D boobs). I love it. Looks like the fabric will wrinkle somewhat easily but I don't mind."
4.0,"This fits a bit small across the chest, but I like it otherwise.  It looks good with a black maxi skirt. The material is sheer, so you may want to wear something under it."
4.0,"I’m usually a small in leggings but these don’t have much stretch to them so I would size up for these leggings. I like my leggings to have stretch so I would’ve preferred a medium. My hips are 36in if that helps for sizing. Also, I do like the scrunch in the back but I wish it started higher up. They are kind of in an awkward spot on the bum. I do love that it has pockets and is high waisted."
4.0,"A bit large for me, but a great bag"
4.0,"Many of  the reviews I read said this shirt ran small, so I ordered up. That was a mistake.  This shirt is definitely true to size. I love the distressed, vintage look."
4.0,Sipper is a booger. I read reviews about the zipper and they were true. Be careful when you zip. Other than that it is lovely.
4.0,Adorable PJ's but they run very very small. Buy at least 2 sizes up. I bought a 4 for our average size 3 year old and a 6 for our 4 year old. The 6 is even slightly small on the 4 year old so I'm going to order him size 8 and give the 6 to the 3 year old. I'll donate the size 4 to a 2 year old cousin!!
4.0,took about 2 weeks to arrive...better than the 4 allotted.  Good for cosplay.
4.0,I like the longer length and general fit. I wish it wasn't quite so clingy and a bit unforgiving to my larger middle.  Material is pretty and soft though. I9
4.0,"Fun, &#34;Beachy&#34;!"
4.0,"Very nice scarf, a little overpriced. Can get it for cheaper from kohls especially if using kohls coupon. colors little off than what is on picture."
4.0,"Sweatshirt is nice, fits and washes well.  It came sooner than expected."
4.0,Its very adorable but I would suggest a sz up.
4.0,I purchased this bag in January and love the color and size.  A couple of weeks ago both of the handles started fraying and falling apart! I own several coach bags and have never had one fall apart! I'm wondering if this is an authentic coach bag. I hope to get a replacement.
4.0,"Very comfortable for the price, but the quality definitely isn't the best. The stitching is poorly done and there are spots on the black band were it looks like it is coming apart. It's easily hidable, so not bad. Also the grey one has a definite purple tint to it, which I love, but not as described. For the price of all three and the comfort, I would recommend."
4.0,Nice looking shoe. For me fits a bit too big.  Back strap rides low and unable to adjust.
4.0,"This is a great bag. Just as described, perfect size, plenty of room."
4.0,"The suspenders seem to be good quality. Barely fits me (6', 250lbs, 48&#34; chest). The only reason I gave this 4 stars is that the bow tie, though seems to be good quality as well, is drastically different in color than the suspenders.  The bow tie is bright red satin, the suspenders are a darker red. I only wanted the suspenders so that isnt an issue for me, but may be an issue for those that want/need a matching set.  The colors in the picture are very accurate and true to reality."
4.0,Great ring don't run finger in hair. It will pull it out. Other than this I love it!!! Would like bracelet to match!!
4.0,"It's an amazing robe, no question. The material is delicious and you can really wear it all day if you want. It is a bit large and I have to roll the sleeves up a few times if I'm making coffee or breakfast, but to lounge and read and nap, it's wonderful. Highly recommend for lazy days."
4.0,"This suit is very slimming! It has underwire and lots of padding. However, it does run somewhat small in my opinion. I LOVE the bottoms. They are high-waisted and also very slimming. If you are looking for bottoms that aren't too skimpy, these are it."
4.0,"These jammies are so cute! My daughter loves unicorns so she will be so excited to get these but they seem to run HUGE. She normally wears a 4t, I got her 5t as I always size up with pajamas and these look like they will fit my son who wears a size 6. They are also not quite as thick as I was hoping but they still feel like good quality."
4.0,Very colorful.  Good quality
4.0,Fit and cut are great but after washing its very clingy and sticks together - not a huge fan
4.0,Really nice quality. Somewhat large but i still wear it!
4.0,"Top is perfect, but bottom is too small for me.  I'm 5.2' and 110 lbs.  But might be perfect for you if you don't have loose skin like I do.  You know what I mean ladies.  Everyone's bottom is diff. shape and size."
4.0,I got this for my Granddaughter's 12th birthday; she loved it!<br />Thank You!
4.0,"After finally receiving my order I will say this belt is very good quality for the price. It was also packaged very nicely. It did, however. Have a strange smell. It did not smell like leather but rather dirt or something. Very strange. The size was accurate and as described."
4.0,Super cute! Stones are on the larger side so they sometimes flip down but they look great in photos! I don't wear them on a day to day basis so they stay nice looking and because they are so big! Perfect for novelty-wear or if you want to wear them for that special someone!
4.0,I like This brand the best but just can't fit it right now
4.0,"It works well, sometimes it loosens up"
4.0,Fits great. Like the fabric. Not crazy about the color even though one of my favorite colors is green. It's a strange shade. Keeping it.
4.0,Bought it for my daughter.
4.0,I'm 5 5 and got the xs/s. This fits except the neck area is a little small for me and if anything I would say tighter than what I am comfortable with. I love the color and feel. Super duper soft. Like teddy bear soft and great for workout really. I heavy cardio and core. It does absorb pretty well and hold up pretty well.
4.0,Cute but the prongs on the rhinestones snag sometimes!
4.0,My daughter who's 9 wears these while driving her snowmobile and they fit her great! She sees just great out of them and wears them all the time.  My son who is 13 didn't really like them and said it felt funny on his face and a little uncomfortable on the nose bridge part so I tried it on to see if it felt weird on mine but it didn't. I do think it's made for a smaller face since I have a smaller face and my daughter is a child.
4.0,I love this ball cap and the color! I wish it had pony tail hole! It ran a little big but otherwise love it
4.0,"Very nice well, classy, well made key-chain. Leather and metal parts feel luxurious in your hand.  This item is a tad on the heavy-side though, and I know some car manufacturer's  (BMW and Cadillac for example) prefer that you don't hang heavy items from your ignition keys."
4.0,These are definitely snug! If you like loose shoes get a half or a whole size up.
4.0,"Perfect shoe for our curious, active, puddle jumping, rock climbing, adventurous little girl.  I was a little worried at first cause she in between sizes and has very narrow feet.  Went with my gut and sized down.  She's a 12 1/2 and got a 12, fits just perfect. No complaints so far and she hasn't taken them off since we got them."
4.0,I would size up
4.0,"Well made, not sure about the extra shoulder strap, I like the look and color it was exactly what I ordered and it arrived in 2 days as promised."
4.0,"I decided to purchase this gold leaf necklace because the elderly woman that lives next door to me has a thing for leaves.. Her reaction when I gave it to her was so sweet she looked like a little kid open a new toy.. so That is the first plus for this product.. Second is that I was given a date for the necklace to arrive and it actually arrived 3 days sooner than I was told so that is the second plus for this seller and product.. She has had it on since the day it arrived when she told me she was never going to take it off, which she hasnt and it has been over 33 days and its still in perfect condition I was luck enough to receive this product at a discounted price but knowing how happy it has made her if I had to get her anouther I would have no problem at all paying full price..."
4.0,"The letters are too bight, but overall the scarf is nice and the cloth material very comfy."
4.0,"Wow, you need a battery pack. How did you think they'd work?<br /><br />You give them a low rating because you can't understand that they don't work using magic and instead need a power source?<br /><br />You know that a car needs gas to run too, right? Or do you sell them as defective after that first tank then write rotten reviews?"
4.0,This is a light comfortable dress. I'm a side 12/14 normally so I ordered 2x after reading the reviews.  It fits perfectly other then being slightly short. Overall good dress for the price.
4.0,Love this bracelet so much♥️♥️♥️
4.0,Tarnishing a little bit. Very careful not to get it wet. I get lots of compliments on the bracelet.
4.0,Me gusto como queda yo soy talla L pero decidí pedir talla XL por algunos comentarios que leí en lo personal me encantó es sexy y cómodo espero no se hagan pequeños cuando los lave
4.0,"Good for the price, but not expecting it to last for a lifetime. Much softer and more comfortable than a polyurethane dive band but nowhere near as substantial. Comfortable for everyday wear or light use but wouldn’t expect it to hold up to a lot of abuse or last very long."
4.0,"Nice work out top, and cute too!! The back criss cross straps fit snugly (not tight) and sit just right so as not to get in way when doing arm work! I recommend!<br />For size I got a medium am 5'7"", 120, 34C<br />I'll probably get another 1 or two depending on colors available (I got the yellow, it's not bright yellow more a slightly mustard color!)"
4.0,"I needed a fanny pack for my wallet while running after my little ones, and this works great. I like the color and the fabric, a bit rough but very durable and should last a long time. The two front side pockets are a bit small - haven't figured out what I can store there but maybe a tissue and a single key or something, but they may come in handy one day. The other pockets are of good size to fit what I need: wallet, keys, emergency medicine, shopping list. Good sized adjustable strap, too. Very pleased with this purchase overall."
4.0,"Nice, kinda expensive though."
4.0,Purchased this with the Wearlizer Milanese Loop Bezel. No information was given as to warranty or how to adjust links. Had to look online with a browser search to find instructions. Adjustment tool was bent but usable. Watchband looks great. Bezel tone does not exactly match band but close enough. Band is heavy as seems to be solid metal. Time will tell if coating wears off. Band and bezel is brushed gold as opposed to shiney which is good - any scratch tend to be less visible.
4.0,OK fits good
4.0,"I got the green and blue.  Sparkles like crazy, especially in soft light.  Got many compliments.  If you have tiny writs like I do you may need an additional hole in the band, but otherwise a good buy.  Very stylish."
4.0,"These pajamas are SO cute, but the top was a bit of a smaller fit. My son is skinny, however, so it worked out fine for him."
4.0,My girlfriend loves the dress.  We are baffled how something in stock takes over 30 days to arrive.  A more accurate (and honest) delivery time would be really nice!
4.0,Son liked it. Fit well and its a beautiful royal blue color.  Quality seems good.  My son is 10 and size 6 fit him well.  Played BB game the day the shoe came in and had no problems in fit or comfort.
4.0,"En mi caso el frame es un poco mas grande a pesar que verifique las dimensiones antes de comprar, lo instale solo con las chapas laterales"
4.0,I sized up x2 because... Well online shopping. Adorable dress! Im 5'4 ans bought a 4x. I'll need to either wear healed shoes with it or hem the black part up a little. It was just a bit too long for what I'm going for (beach vacay). The only thing I was dissapointed about was the sleeves being shorter then is look in the advertised picture.
4.0,La tela es igual a una playera tal cual es la tela de playeras de algodón.  Cómodo pero para el día a día un vestido de usar en casa pero puesto luce bien
4.0,"Dress is SUPER soft & comfortable.  Love the pockets.  I only gave 4 stars because the background color is not gray, more of a heather blue.  The color is very pretty tho, it will look very nice with a blue denim jacket.  Wish they had one in gray too.  Purchased size small."
4.0,"This is our second pair of OLIEYE sunglasses (one for him, one for her).  They are quality made, and come in a protective case with a cleaning cloth.  Polarized for extra protection.  These are a bit on the large side, but that's more a style issue than a quality issue.  High quality, good value, just get a style that suits you."
4.0,"I got this with the intention my daughter would wear to cheer practice. The problem is that it is so long it covers her shorts too. My daughter always wears a size large no matter the brand, but this shirt is so long. It fits in every other way, but much longer than her shorts."
4.0,"Good compression, just  a little small, making it difficult to get on. Once on, they do not feel too tight except for the very top. I have to fold it over a little to keep from digging into my leg just below the knee."
4.0,"Loved it, but didn't wear it much (I have large boobs, and it so it didn't make it too my waist, but rather the hem sat at my bra line), but the sleeve length was good and the neck fit perfectly"
4.0,I reside in Arizona. It gets quite hot. The wraps help with Az heat
4.0,I bought these sunglasses in bulk for my upcoming wedding.  I’m going to put them in my bridal party’s gift bags. I thought they would be cute for pictures. I received every color that was advertised. I’m happy with them for the price.
4.0,Very nice set and worth the price. I bought it to wear for my wedding and everyone loved it and complimented it. It's not cheap looking and not too heavy either.
4.0,Works well. Works better with thicker arms on the glasses. It was fine until I slipped them up on my head… then the band slipped off. Cute though!
4.0,Loved this dress for my 2 year old. It was a nice thick material held up with multiple washes. For size reference most 2T clothes are large on her and this was a bit snug.
4.0,Really like that my phone stays snug in the pocket while I'm doing my workouts
4.0,I bought these pearls as a gift. The necklace arrived very well packed with a gift box too (which smelled like poliurethan a lot) but there were no authenticity certificate how I saw in the description. The pearls were authentic (I know how to recognize the authentic ones) with some imperfections (which is normal).The closure is really strange and thin.I had to return for the missing authenticity certificate.
4.0,I love love love the print and the fit. The knit fabric feels super cheap though
4.0,A very pretty summery dress.  A bit small in the bust area and I am not chesty so if you're top heavy this wouldn't be for you.  It does wrinkle easily.  Nonetheless I like it very much.
4.0,"I’ve gotten my use out of it daily, and received tons of compliments on it. It does get super heavy and almost awkward to carry if you fill it too much  (guilty)… but I love how durable it is and how easily I’m able to clean it out!"
4.0,Nice dress and very fitting ... can't wait to wear it ...
4.0,stuff
4.0,"I got this for my daughter to wear to an Alice in Wonderland party with pink-and-purple striped shirt and pants. It would have been nice if the tail came with a way to attach it, but we just tied a ribbon around her waist. The tail was short enough that my 3-year-old wasn't dragging it or tripping over it."
4.0,This dress is great quality and fit perfectly. Only problem was that I kept getting caught in the bottom because I'm only 5ft 2.5 inch
4.0,These earrings are dainty in size but I prefer smaller jewelry so the size is perfect for me. They look high quality but the abalone isn't as vibrant or beautiful as in the photo. Abalone can very greatly in color though so I'm not too surprised.  The ones I received are mainly grey in color but they still have a pretty shimmer when they catch the light just right. I'm overall happy with the earrings. They also included the black pouch shown in the listing.
4.0,Looks nice and dressy. Order a size or 2 up. It's see-through as most of these shirts are.
4.0,"Pretty much what I  expected. In hindsight,  would have paid more for better quality."
4.0,"I LOVED THE DRESS, BUT I COULD NOT GET INTO IT. I AM SENDING IT BACK. I DO NOT HAVE RETURN LABELS.<br /><br />THANK YOU."
4.0,I ordered this as a gift . the person really liked it . to me the quality didn't seem to good .
4.0,I got this for my granddaughter and she loves it. She is a teenager and sometimes hard to please. It looks great with her leggings!
4.0,I really liked the earnings they fit well and are very pretty!
4.0,it arrived on time ! took a chance buying this even though it said for boys and girls because I have a smaller face...and it fit great !  the actual heartagram is very visible but the HIM lettering is not-its very light-faded ..hard to see but if your a HIM fan you should purchase this mask !  it is otherwise very nice !!!! very breathable. I wash it by hand and its holding up just fine.
4.0,"I got this as a present to my boyfriend, who is a big Rangers fan. The fit was a bit smaller than expected and I am in the process of exchanging it. The shipment came faster than expected and the actual product itself, besides the fit, was exactly as advertised and of good quality."
4.0,"They are pretty thin,  which is what I'm looking for.  Not too tight,  again what I want.  I'm a size 10.5 and these are nice.  I don't have any washing feedback but will come back and complain if they don't hold up"
4.0,I'm a Large...I ordered a large the Jacket fit perfectly but the pants are extremely too long but I'm 5'4 so if you're taller then it'll fit great....I just have to wear heels with mine lol. If you order Orange as I did it is Orange Orange from the image I thought it was more Burnt Orange.
4.0,Shirt is great.  In comparison to reg. American sizes it seems ok.  If bordering in a size i would buy larger. If child has belly weight definitly go up.  Trends to look slimmer than expected
4.0,"The material was fine, mix of cotton blend with spandex/nylon not entirely sure but did not have any lace as described in the description title.  I was hoping for the scrunch look to be evident but because the size was small it stretch out the scrunch look.  The rear bow makes this very cut, not too tight or uncomfortable for all day wear.  Cute soft thong made for smaller bodies.  Worth the purchase, delivered on time, and without issues"
4.0,Feel great on my mountain bike I'll keep you posted when I use them on my roadbike
4.0,"I love this crop top. It is def. for a petite woman. If you are above a D cup, this will probably fit you more like a bra than a tank top. The knit is loose and soft. Tag says the item is made in the USA, so that's a great bonus. I am 5'4 and the top comes down about 2.5 inches above my bellybutton. Very flattering, straps are the right length. The top has a slit on each side too."
4.0,"Love the top. You could wear it like a dress, or like me and wear it as a top, with leggings or skinny jeans. Only thing I’m a little disappointed with is very wrinkled after wash."
4.0,We needed this shirt fast and they delivered! Excellent.
4.0,"UPDATE:<br />One of the earrings already dropped two feathers 🤕 not sure how to fix them but I'm taking off one star because of it. I'll get some glue and see if I can glue them back on.<br />I attended a women's circle and one woman had these amazing white feather earrings! I decided then & there that I was going to get feather earrings! I wanted some bold color and lately? I have come to truly appreciate yellow and orange (I'm normally a blue and purple person!). These earrings are so beautiful, light and yet still fun! The only thing is they tangle/turn a bit so you may need to readjust them. They were also a great price and they're literally like wearing NO earrings! I love that because I want to keep my earring holes intact and healthy."
4.0,I love the look and the feel of this purse. It’s a good size and it’s comfortable if worn crossbody. It’s genuine leather which is great. My only issue is that I really needed the card organizer that it has inside the purse but I can’t use it. One side of the card slots is correct size and the other side of card slots is so small it bends all my cards and they won’t fit in or slide out of the slots. I really can’t use it at all and that’s one of the reasons I bought the purse. Having said that I do love the look of the purse. It hold a lot of stuff but is still comfortable. I also wish I could make the shoulder strap shorter but there’s not enough holes in the strap. I will be buying another purse from this company due to their quality and prices.
4.0,nice slippers but they are on the small side.  You may want to order a size larger than you normally do.
4.0,Great looking shirt! It fits a little snug I will definitely have to suck in my gut when I'm wearing this shirt.
4.0,Love the style and color and the leather appears to be good quality. It's large enough for a small purse and phone although there are narrower compartments inside for money or cards. Only issue is the ring fell off and luckily it was on concrete so I heard it fall and was able to find the long screw to keep it together. Hoping it doesn't happen again as that is the focal feature of the handbag.
4.0,My little girl loves them! They are cute and comfy. My only caution is that the grip on the bottom is essentially useless. Our kitchen is pretty much like an ice skating rink when she wears the slippers.
4.0,Extra soft material. Comfortable. I'm 6 feet tall and it was near my ankle.  Washed nicely too with hang dry.
4.0,Love these sweaters really long lasting the only thing negative is you need to make sure you use downy when you was other wise after so many washes the interior will become irritating and itchy
4.0,Arrive on time. Happy with the product.
4.0,It took one and a half tubs to do an XL oilskin. But it's awesome stuff
4.0,"These are very cute and function as desired, however I am not sure they are going to wear well.  After one wash, they started to unroll at the top and get pilly.  Will see."
4.0,Fit great had to go up a size I have gained a few lbs but this is the only item I own thats a 3xl but still really cute and comfortable.
4.0,"I received the order well within the stated arrival dates. It was a gift for my husband, so I was unsure of the size but I went with XL which is what he usually wears and it fit fine.  I've washed it once, line dried it and threw it in the dryer to fluff it.  So far no shrinkage or pilling.  My husband liked the fact that you can detach the hood.  I gave it four stars instead of five because it remains to be seen how well it will hold up to repeated washings and drying."
4.0,"The belt is great for casual wear. I wear a 34W pant and this belt fit me well, allowing me to use the center hole out of the 5 available. It is a soft leather and the buckle is very sturdy. I only have one thing that bothered me. After only wearing twice it was already showing a crease where I buckled it, that leads me to think that after wearing for a year it is likely to look pretty worn. Fine for casual wear, but I thought I’d mention it. On the good side it doesn't look prone to peeling at all."
4.0,"I love this bag! It's big enough to fit all of my stuff (regular size wallet, travel lotion, cell phone, keys, travel kleenex, and a few small things I'll throw in there here & there), yet small enough to carry as a crossbody. The only reason I'm giving it 4⭐ is because one of the zippers gets a little ""stuck"" when zipping it back up."
4.0,"Took so long to come I forgot I even ordered it but love the belt! My waist is about 28 inches, size 5. Fits great."
4.0,"Me encantó, se ve muy bien y de excelente calidad."
4.0,"Honestly, I think it deserves five stars but the color of the image is not what you should expect. The color was more of a periwinkle. You can't beat this necklace for the price that it is at."
4.0,Color as shown n fits well too
4.0,Nice balloons
4.0,"I like the baseball cap with the pretty white broiderie stitch. The one thing I would add, would be a chin strap for windy days. The bucket hat is adorable and has a chin strap. The bucket hat is made of chambray and broiderie stitch. Both are very cute."
4.0,nice bag  soft leather looks great!
4.0,"I love these. There were some problems with the stiching, the seller however did remedy the situation. As a 35&#34; waist I was worried that they may be to small but they fit good. Plenty of room for the grapes and snug on the snake but I'm above average in that department."
4.0,The pants are longer than petites usually run but i shortened them myself and kept them. They are so comfortable!!
4.0,I ordered XXXL for someone who generally wears an XL.  Quality and design are great.
4.0,"Dress was a solid purchase.  Material is decent.  If washed on delicate, think it will last awhile.  I'm normally a 12 or Large, but got away ordering a Medium and it fit well.  So possibly runs a little larger as previous reviews have stated. Plan on ordering a different print."
4.0,good quality and warm!
4.0,"Really sturdy, good material. Doesn't bother my ear at all, but if I lay down on the side with it, my ear may hurt a bit. Fits pretty well, could have a more snug fit but stays on throughout the day. I've even done cardio workouts with them on and they stay put. Happy with my purchase."
4.0,"these are great shorts, the fit was a little small compared to other 34 in waist clothing"
4.0,I really like this shirt and it’s colors but I do find that it’s kind of cheaply made and runs pretty small. Make sure to size up a size or 2 when ordering.
4.0,"I revieved the package very quickly which was nice! Overall the product is what is pictured. I think it's a little overpriced for the quality of the material but I'm not surprised, as it is a Halloween item and it was difficult enough to find so close to the holiday. This seller charged a much lower shipping price than the others which I appreciated. The costume is insanely soft and comfortable. Also, it is truly one size fits most as it fit my tall skinny boyfriend just as well as it fit my short plump self. The costumes have a couple of weak points: the material, while soft, is relatively thin, and the buttons are cheaply made. The top botton on one of the costumes I ordered doesn't close. Not a big deal and I'm still happy with the purchase."
4.0,"The dress itself is very beautiful and of good quality;  however, even after following the size chart, the dress is way too big.  I returned the dress and Amazon immediately refunded my gift card back.  I reordered the same dress for smaller prize."
4.0,"Thank you for getting it right, I hate returning purchases."
4.0,"A little big, but still nice.  My daughter loves it."
4.0,"I bought this helmet along with a butted steel chain mail hauberk and coif (http://www.amazon.com/Chain-Haulberk-Shirt-Knight-Armor/dp/B005LLSCAS/ref=pd_sbs_a_2). They're a great pair, and extremely affordable. The helmet arrived nice and greasy, but I used some ""Goo Gone"" and it was cleaned up relatively quickly. The helmet is thick, strong, and appears quite durable. If I had two of these I would love to see what kind of abuse it could handle. It comes unpadded, just as others have mentioned. As of now it is wearable, but not battle-ready. It fits over my chain mail coif, but without being secured with padding it tends to tilt downward and squash the nose. I doubt that the arming caps I've seen on amazon will adequately pad this particular helm. Vertical visibility is somewhat restricted, but that is too be expected from any closed helm. Because of the work that needs to be put in I'm giving it 4/5. If I can find a quick solution I will gladly give it a 5/5 score and share what I know."
4.0,"Cute but they run small, also the material is thin."
4.0,"It’s a cheaper quality than I thought it would be. More like a thinner, light and stretchy T-shirt almost. It’s cute and I’ll wear it, but not exactly what I was expecting! Also rides up if you don’t have boobs lol."
4.0,Shirt arrived pretty early! But the material was a little rough feeling. It's not so bad since I washed it though.
4.0,Ordered grey and received purple. I use them anyway. They do the job.
4.0,"Love this luggage set, strong, light and durable."
4.0,These are pretty nice. Very light and the spring is quite strong which is a plus. They are however a bit on the small side. I would like to see it be a little bigger and it'd be perfect. I think I get where they were going with these for the size but a larger option would be nice and then perhaps use this size to hook on the larger one if you wanted to segregate keys in to groups for easy access.
4.0,It is cute but really small. Beautiful gift but you get what you pay :(
4.0,A great Handbag. .  I was worried about the bag being too heavy but it is not and it holds a lot of stuff.
4.0,"Fits as expected around the bust. I’m 5’3” and 34B so had no problems except that the straps are kind of flimsy and the double straps get tangled often. It otherwise looks really cool.<br /><br />As I’m also 5’3”, there is extra fabric that I have to get hemmed, but I expected this."
4.0,"Nice keychain, a bit small but nice"
4.0,Very preety
4.0,Graet looking
4.0,Fit as expected. Good Material.
4.0,Soft t-shirt great for games.
4.0,Loved the bag in the purple it was just to big for me so had to return
4.0,Was definitely smaller than expected but I'm a skinny guy (6 foot 140 pounds) so it for fairly well. The only thing that I didn't like was the sleeves were too short. I use it for a jacket to use while riding my motorcycle and the sleeves aren't long enough to go over my gloves when hunched over.
4.0,"Just as they are described,fit perfectly!"
4.0,It was not durable<br />It was little loose so didn't use it much still got teared threads came out
4.0,"I should begin by saying that this is really a 4.5 star review. I asked my husband who enjoys wearing wristwatches to try out this BiDen Men's Chronograph Quartz Watch. He was a little apprehensive when he first saw the Amazon listing photo as he thought that the watch seemed rather busy with possibly too many colors. When it arrived, however, he was pleasantly surprised by how nice this watch looked. He said that the Amazon photos really don't do this watch justice. The watch's blue dial and blue/red bezel look truly stunning against the 2-tone case and bracelet. The stainless steel watch also has a solid feeling, weighty heft. My husband thought that it felt much more expensive than the current Amazon listing price of about $36. In terms of functions, besides timekeeping, the watch features a date calendar window and a chronograph stopwatch. My husband tested the functions and found everything working well. The watch also has a unidirectional rotating diver-type bezel. My husband noted a little back and forth play on the bezel, but it still clicked well as it spun around the dial. He said that he sometimes prefers to use the dive bezel for timing things rather than the chronograph, so it was nice to have both options in this watch. My husband was also very pleased to find that the watch has glow-in-the-dark luminescent hands, hour markers, and bezel pip. This is very handy in low light conditions. Additionally, the watch comes with a bracelet resizing tool which made adjusting the watch links to my husband's wrist size very easy. The 2-button push deployant clasp works well and includes 3 micro-adjustment positions. On the wrist, the watch is definitely not small. Although it has a great deal of wrist presence, the watch still looks handsome on my husband's 7-inch wrist. All in all, for such an affordable price, this watch is loaded with features, works well, and is surprisingly attractive."
4.0,"I really like the purse, but wish the straps were a little less clunky."
4.0,The title sums it up. I hope in the future a better solution is given for the master chief helmet with the lanyard. The flimsy ring holding the helmet patch had been bending in my pocket while I'm at work and have my work keys attached with the lanyard itself.
4.0,I thought I wasn't going to like it because of the fleece color but it turned out to be gray color instead of this ugly brown and I really like it. It'll be perfect for my toddler to wear this winter.
4.0,Nice product but I could have used a smaller size
4.0,"Daughter loves this. However, be careful. it will snag your top you are wearing.  Daughter's brand new (expensive) blouse was ruined."
4.0,It's a hat; it covers my head. It will cover your head too. Buy one if you like this kind of hat.
4.0,"Nice looking, but not as good as Docs purchased as recently as two years ago. Thinner interior, especially footbed; feels cheap. As a result I need to wear two pairs of Dr. Scholl's inserts instead of my usual one. Thick socks might also do the trick. (Sigh!)"
4.0,I love the shirt need a size up they run small
4.0,"Nice shorts for the price!  My son is 14 5'8"" 135 lbs. and fit a small perfectly fine.  He wasn't too happy about the length but again these are work out/running shorts so not meant to be long.  Exactly as described!"
4.0,Shine to it..it's ok except for neckline is baggy/saggy..if your a D cup you'd be better off in it than C.
4.0,It fits me very nicely but I do recommend wearing a garter belt to attached them.
4.0,So cute and light
4.0,"The top is adorable and very versatile. I bought the yellow, it's not as bright as it was in the picture, but still very pretty. It's just a nice cotton blend w/some stretch too it. Not clingy at all and fits true to size.  I don't dry any of my tops (I toss them in the dryer once they're dry to soften and remove the wrinkles), so as far as shrinkage goes, I can't say."
4.0,This is a well-fitting hat with a substantial fabrication. It's less warm than real fur but more comfortable in my opinion. The exterior is indeed waterproof and I've done some hiking in the rain with this. The liner is a nice smooth cotton and the chin strap is thin but adequate. My real criticism is the consistency of the quality. The fur lining sits a little uneven over one eye and the interior lining is not fully stitched on one side. If it becomes a problem I'll just repair it myself but the company isn't getting a 5 star review for sending me an unfinished hat.
4.0,I haven't been able to wear heavier scarfs; get to heated in a school where I'm constantly moving.  This is the perfect weight for me to accessorize but not feel overheated.  It is described mid-weight but I would say it's on the lighter side and definitely great for winter to spring..  Love the color palette choices too.
4.0,"hello,<br /><br />i ordered these two pairs of glasses got them at a a speedy time, i noticed when i received them one of the pairs had a little defect on them, the vender contacted me and i told them about the problem and they sent me new pairs no charge overall they are stylish but also help with being on the computer and on your phone all the time. i recommend purchasing these. They are good !!!"
4.0,"I have size 12 US, and went with 48 according to the chart.  If I put the straps on tight to minimize movement on the upstroke, I notice my feet compress too much and will lose circulation.  According to the sizing chart, a US 12 would be a 47 or 48, so in a way, these fit just as expected.  Perhaps if I went with a 47 I would've had a tighter fit but the toes wouldn't have been as comfortable in the toe box.  Being from AZ where my feet could expand in this often hot weather, and since I'm using this for commuting/light gravel and mtb work, then I still prefer the 48 to a tighter racing fit.  Still working on clipping in my SPDs but that's another challenge.<br />For $60, you can't go wrong if this is your first pair of shoes.  I have Look Keo's on my road bikes, so I do have experience with clipless."
4.0,"My daughter loves these, but they are flimsy. I don't expect them to last long with a rambunctious 6 year old. Cute for the price!"
4.0,Beautiful gift just what I ordered
4.0,"I wear size11 but bought a size 12 because 11 was sold out, but the strap on the instep is very large, I took it to a shoe shop and they cut a piece off, then i put sole pad so my feet does not slip. I really needed that color green, i will wear it, if i had returned it i wouldn't have got it back on time."
4.0,"Good quality, very well constructed and is thick and heavy, needless to day it's not going to fall apart after a month. (Or atleast it doesn't feel like it will.) The frame dimensions and size on the temple is a really nice touch, and in general, I can't really find much to gripe about.<br /><br />However I do feel the tortoise shell is a bit too bright, and makes it seem somewhat, cheap. It's not a huge issue, just a nitpick really, would love to see a brown or caramel plastic option or a darker tortoise shell.<br /><br />Either way, love them, really do, I would also say I'm almost expected the clip on sunglasses to break, so an option to order those separately  would be a huge plus.<br /><br />Overall, good glasses. May even get my prescriptions in them."
4.0,The order was processed quickly and correctly.  The product is as advertised and pictured accurately.  It has been helpful.
4.0,"This is super functional, super cute, and super reliable. It has a lot of 2-sided card holders for those who have a thousand credit cards. It fits pretty well in my purse. It can be a bit bulky if you want to put it in your pocket or a clutch purse. Otherwise, I'd say get it."
4.0,The fit of it works for some heels and some not. The thicker heel works well. The skinner heel does not work well. Don’t know if there is different sizes and I didn’t see any. But it still works so I’m still satisfied.
4.0,I am pleasantly satisfied with these sunglasses. The mirror effect does hide well your eyes and the design is real stylish. I do think some people with more wider faces might have an issue because they somewhat have a snug fitting on mine but I like it but others might not.<br /><br />I recommend these sunglasses but be aware that it might be too tight if you are a person that has a big/wide face/head.
4.0,"I kept it, as it was not worth returning..."
4.0,Perfect size... easy to insert
4.0,"These earrings are really quite lovely.  They have a beautiful sparkle in the coloring and you are less likely to lose them with the lever back closure.  If, there is anything negative I would say, it is that they are a bit smaller than they appear in the photo.  All and all beautiful earrings for the money."
4.0,"This is super cute, wish it came in more colors."
4.0,little small low cut
4.0,"This umbrella was smaller than I expected, but functions without problem, with a one-press button on the handle that opens up the umbrella."
4.0,I have a lot of Kangol Mowbray caps but this one fits kind of large. This one seems different than the other ones I own.
4.0,"These glasses aren’t as comfortable on my face as I expected based on reviews I had heard, but the lens really block the UV rays while still allowing you to see everything clearly."
4.0,expect a good night's sleep
4.0,"I had no idea that these underwear would look so well and fit so great.<br />I am so excited to have purchased them and at such a great price<br />I showed them to my sister, and she immediately purchased her own."
4.0,"I loved it! the color and the perfect size just a detail in the front seam two horizontal lines that mark do not look for my taste and for the rest very comfortable, soft and warm, I recommend it!"
4.0,"I love the boots and get compliments from people every time I wear them! The only negative is that they are a bit hard to get on but once on, very comfortable and cute!!"
4.0,fits like a charm and adjusts easy. worth the money.
4.0,Fit just right. Delivered fast.
4.0,"When I saw the great quality of my new  red, blue and black bandanas, I was happy I hadn’t given into the temptation to buy a cheaper alternative.  The bandanas feel nice and are nicely finished. After several times through my washing machine, the colors remain bright and there are no loose threads. When I lay the bandanas flat, they dry without wrinkles. The bandanas work well to hold my hair back. Since the bandanas are also shown as face covering, them 4 stars, instead of 5. The bandanas have a loose weave (low thread count with light coming through the cloth) which is attractive, but much less protective than more densely woven cotton. While these bandanas do not make the best cloth covering, any mask is better than no mask."
4.0,For play tennis
4.0,"The pendant is beautiful. I've seen a lot of reviews stating that the color is not as dark as the image. With natural amethyst, that is to be expected. I love that this gem is not lab created, it's not treated -  it's 100% natural. That's exactly what I was looking for. The chain is very delicate, but it is sterling silver and it looks great with the pendant. The purchase arrived in time. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was the packaging. I understand the need for the plastic bags, a jeweler once told me that keeping sterling silver in plastic baggies will help keep it from tarnishing.  However, with such a delicate item, i would have loved for it to arrive packed in a box, rather than an envelope. It would have been a shame if it had arrived broken, because this is a mother's day gift. Overall, everything was fantastic and I'm pleased."
4.0,"I love it, just wish it was wider"
4.0,I love this dress.  I am a 5' 2&#34; size 16 and 38D the fit was great.  I took it to my tailor and had it hemmed and added a pocket on one side.  There is a zipper on the left side.  The fabric is heavy and of quality. I have bough other cheaper dresses online and you can see through them and they are cheap cotton.  I bought the red and it is a dark red not too bright just right.
4.0,Cute dress! Not very high quality but very cute! My two girls wore them as flower girls and we got lots of compliments. I went off the sizing chart and it worked out. Theres more front embroidery than I expected from the pictures but it looked nice.
4.0,"Good quality, but runs small. I would suggest getting a size larger."
4.0,"Very bright colors, just as shown. Well constructed, light summer-weight robe."
4.0,"Today’s the first day I putOn the socks. I like that they are thin and they feel comfortable. The only complaint I have is I have a size 8 foot and they seem a little bit long. They have not fell down in the back but they also have some type of silicone or some type of material to help keep them on your ankle. Because they run a little bit big they are socks that can be seen in my shoe. If I had bigger feet, which I don’t need to have I would be very very happy with the socks."
4.0,Got it for my boss loves it. Writing a little too small .
4.0,The design looks really pretty. Some gold-colored accessories turn out too shiny but this one has a muted gold color which is great!
4.0,This works really good.
4.0,"This outfit is really really cute. The sweater is a little large but that is the way it is supposed to fit, like an oversized sweatshirt. The problem I had with the sizing was with the pants. My LO is tall for her age and these pants are way too long. If you can sew then they can be easily hemmed to fix the length issue but this is why I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5."
4.0,Liked everything about item.  Nice material alsonice material..made well
4.0,Served the purpose for purchase. Worth the price but the material could be improved for longer lasting usage. Its quite good.
4.0,"Nice looking watch, however the face diameter was smaller than expected. If you are looking for one of the<br />large face watches - check the specs forth on this one. I would say that the diameter of the face is standard<br />/ typical watch sized. Time will tell how it holds up - too early to tell."
4.0,I am 6’2 and pretty lean and ordered the large because of my height. The shirts go down to about mid thigh and are baggy on me around the middle and the arms. Might have been better if I had went with the medium.
4.0,"Super cute, lightweight and good color."
4.0,"I absolutely LOVE the color.  I was very shocked as well to see that I could fit the small band.  My current band that I received with my original Alta Fit Bit was a large; and it fits great.  I did receive a small band and was shocked and surprised that it fit my wrist just as well as the large one.  It was very comfortable, and as stated before, the color is beautiful and true to what it looks like on the product preview.  Unfortunately, I am back to wearing my original bands because I almost lost my Alta twice in one day.  The clasping mechanism is similar to the clasping mechanism that came with my original Alta, but it didn't seem to &#34;lock&#34; as well as the original bands.  Also, the bands seemed to be a bit flimsier than the original bands.  It easily came off in my car and fell between the cars seat and the floor panel because my hand brushed up against the seat belt.  Later that day, I lost it at a wedding reception on the dance floor while picking up my daughter.  I happened to look on the ground and there it was.<br /><br />Love the color, love that it is a little lighter-weight than the original, but the clasp &#34;grip&#34; I could be a little more secure...but this could due to the fact that I ordered a small instead of a large.<br /><br />I received this item for free in exchange for my unbiased and truthful review."
4.0,cosy and casual
4.0,Great dress sizing incorrect
4.0,Arrived timely. Cute. I did not give 5 stars due to one being broken.  See picture.
4.0,Only took off a star because no crotch opening.
4.0,"For the price that I paid, the product exceeded expectations, however the piece were much bigger than expected, but this was not an issue."
4.0,I will be redoing the obi and tabards but i knew that b4 i even looked at ANY cotumes
4.0,"They're comfortable, have a good fit and a bargain"
4.0,"Great quality and nice fit, the only issue was the two hold downs  are a little big and slide around."
4.0,The dress runs a bit large and didnt come with a tag so im not sure the material or how it was intended to be washed. Also theres a hole in the seam of the pocket (fixed in 5 seconds). Those are y I gave it 4 stars. That being said the dress is super comfortable and the fit is flattering. I wouldn't hesitate to order in other colors which says it all!
4.0,"My wife wears between and 8 - 8.5 so I grabbed the 9.  They are a little loose but according to her, not bad."
4.0,"Love the colors and love Happy Socks but the pair I bought are too big. Not sure if it’s sizing or the they are knee length instead of crew, which is my preference. I’ll keep for winter wear."
4.0,"I love this shirt. Great feel, fit & texture. The one issue is the problem of the button that should hold the sleeves in place. The button is sewn on the inside of the sleeve, an awkward position and can be very difficult to button the first few times you attempt this. Once the button hole has been stretched and you get the feel for this it gets easier. Great shirt, love it."
4.0,4/5 only bc some threading around the waist looks loose. Otherwise I'm so happy!!!!!
4.0,Good alternative to spending $30 at the park. I wore them the whole day and they didn’t hurt my head. They a pretty but not the same quality as the ones at the parks.
4.0,"Some of the studs were dull looking, but overall I like them. I sleep in my studs and I haven't lost the first one yet, about a week in."
4.0,Product delivered as ordered  and my wife enjoyed the surprise .
4.0,Great product.  Got exactly what I expected. Would buy again.
4.0,Awesome for the price. Would recommend
4.0,"It fits good. The size is perfect. But  it does not raise my bust like in the picture , instada it makes them look apart. But still good product"
4.0,Nice belt and fit as expected.
4.0,The edge does snag a little and the magnet does slip but it hasn't opened all the way to where it would fall off.
4.0,Good price and speedy delivery.
4.0,Only one length
4.0,I liked it well enough. Making granddaughter a birthday bracelet.
4.0,Just need to see how long they last with washing.
4.0,The elastic band was too short and I don't have a large head. Left a slight bruise on forehead. Still better than the one my doctor provided.
4.0,"I do like this hat as far as quality and fit are concerned. My only complaint is that the ears are smaller than the pictures show. If they got any smaller, they'd be missed altogether. I'd say I'm okay with my purchase because it'll keep me warm."
4.0,"They run slightly small and the sleeves are short (like in the photo). They are overall comfortable and soft but I wish I had sized up. The draw string waist isn’t very comfortable and I’m worried it will get twisted over time. They remind me of Soma but less comfortable, same fabric. Hope this helps!"
4.0,Ordered a large and to reorder an xl. They run small.
4.0,"It's cute, it dangles a little too low and id be careful not to snag it on something but I like"
4.0,The price was excellent but I was disappointed in the color. I realize that colors can change as leather is dyed but it’s so dark blue it looks black. I specifically wanted a blue wallet. When the time comes to buy another one I will just need to look else where.
4.0,"This is my second lanyard from this company, the price is a bit high, but it is a very beautiful lanyard, and it is just the right length around my neck, love it highly recommend I will order different colors if they make them, love it,"
4.0,I bought it for a trip but it is bigger and bulkier than I thought it would be.
4.0,"They were smaller than I had pictured so he won't get too much wear I'm afraid, however, he loved them and would not take then off.  They were a gift for a friend's son."
4.0,"These pants are absolutely adorable but not very durable. They worked for the performance but not much more. For full disclosure, my 7 yo daughter spends lots of time on her knees."
4.0,"Size is what matters the most in slippers and these fit just as I hoped. They are comfortable and not too hot just because they may look that way. I'd recommend these to anyone looking for a comfortable ""ride""."
4.0,"good product , but my 10 years old son says he wish if it has more features . also the metal part that keep the ban comes off and we had to put it back . also the volume not that loud enough"
4.0,This little beach hat is just too cute. Can't you just picture your baby's little head under this? This has upf 50 protection to keep your little one from getting sunburned. It is lightweight. It has a chin strap and sits out from and above the eyes so that baby's gets maximum protection. It is made of 83% nylon and 17% spandex. This only needs to be rinsed afterwards and hang dried. It is not recommended for machine wash and should never be cleaned with bleach. You also do not dry on wire hangers or leave in the sun to dry.
4.0,Husband loves the rubber shirt stay at the waist. Wash and go is a plus...no iron needed. Update...the Hook and eye closure at the waist band fell off. After the 2nd wash. Slide in hook is now inside of the waist band .
4.0,Slightly larger than expected
4.0,"Light not as intense as some may expect, though quite visible in a darkened room. Only worn once so far, but battery lasted entire evening."
4.0,"Personally I would give it the full 5 stars, but they were a gift for my mother. She didn't enjoy how bright the lights were. She likes to use them to not trip over the dogs and cats that sometimes sleep in the way. Doesn't seem too bright to me, though."
4.0,"Fits fine, a bit on the loose side. The dress length is perfect. The material is thin and fluffy, good for dress."
4.0,"These are just like I remember. The glasses are very dark, I would recommend them to anyone. Just a little tight but not bad overall."
4.0,"The transfer paper is a little difficult to remove, but after a wash on cold finally came off.  My kid is having a great time with the masks and capes."
4.0,Love how soft and lightweight the robe is.  Also really appreciate how the wrist can be rolled and pushed up arm to keep sleeve out of way if necessary.  Only thing I noticed that is somewhat bothersome is it sheds lint on anything and everything it touches.
4.0,Looks like the picture and but hard to wear because material doesn’t stretch and doesn’t have zip
4.0,works as described. a little small tho
4.0,i loved it except i didn't get any industrial bars! i got some weird horseshoe rings but other than that i love it! definite will buy again!
4.0,"The 027/4002.44 (the M likely refers to the Milanese loop which accompanies it) adds 4mm of diameter and a date complication to what is otherwise an authentic 1960s Max Bill design.  The extra size and the silvered dial emphasize the design‘s cleanness – the narrow, silver second hand can seem ghostlike as it flits across the face.  The play of light through the domed crystal adds subtlety under the right illumation.  The Milanese strap is easy to adjust and use, though some may prefer the authenticity of leather.<br /><br />The movement is not in-house.  It uses a Swiss-made ETA 2824-2, an excellent and ubiquitous option.  Junghans has added their own touches to it, including customized decorations on the rotor.  While it would be nice to have a German-made movement in a watch so quintessentially German (Junghans‘s marketing slogan is „die deutsche Uhr“ – the German clock) the movement‘s pedigree is impeccable.  It‘s about 5-6 seconds per 24 hours (that is, about 3 seconds by evening) fast compared to my cellphone.<br /><br />Day-to-day maintenance doesn‘t extend beyond setting it from time to time if you care about on-the-dot precision.  The “hacking second hand” – which stops when you are adusting the hour and minute – is ideal for this.  Winding isn‘t necessary if you wear it during your normal daily routine, and in fact letting the rotor wind the watch is preferable to using the crown.  I haven‘t taken the watch in for maintenance yet, but given how ubiquitous the movement is I don‘t anticipate any trouble there at all."
4.0,I love the easy on and off and the color is cute.  If only the color didn't peel over time it would be perfect.
4.0,"These are ok. Nothing to write home about, but no complaints. I'm 5/6, 36c bra, 140lbs, fit was slightly small."
4.0,Shirt was a little shorter than other workout shirts on Amazon. Shorts were a little too tight compared to other pants on Amazon of the same size.
4.0,"Soft, flexible and comfortable. But it is so short that it rides up. Those who have a little meat around your abdomen area will not be happy with this product. Overall: an excellent product but reluctant to recommend until the generous length is added to the design."
4.0,Dress just as pictured.  Cute for day in the office or a nice night out.
4.0,Daughter likes the mask and the volleyballs look realistic.
4.0,"Good quality, it just didn't fit my body type right and a little more coverage than what I wanted. I'd still recommend it because it's well made and looks more expensive than it is. The colors are vibrant as well."
4.0,"Great sweatshirt, son loves it.  Runs a bit small though it seems, especially for Adidas which normally runs on the large side, I feel."
4.0,Deff a great fit for what I was looking for however the fabric is just a little “stiffer” than my other waffle knit top but also slightly thicker making it just a little warmer. Good length for leggings I’d say true to size
4.0,My son is 4 and a very tall 4. This fit him but my son is also slender and the shirt is pretty wide on him. Nice quality and cute!
4.0,I really love everything about this watch except that the face of the watch is so large that you can't tighten the strap properly as the face is wider than my wrist.
4.0,My 8 year old autistic grandson just loved it!!!!  He has such an imagination.....it was a big hit at that house!  I know what Adyn will be for Halloween!  HeHe
4.0,"Definitely on the cute side but not for those who are allergic to certain metals...even sterling silver. Other than that, it's eye-catching and compliments arise when others see!"
4.0,I like the material and they quality of the pants. Unfortunately even ordering an xl size my butt doesnt seem to quite fit into them comfortably.
4.0,"Super cute pattern but made of your basic cotton off the bolt. It was super stiff out of the package. Plus it was also super BIG, like a Fival hat. (If you don't understand, Google that reference.) The inside forehead band is nice and soft. It is not lined anywhere else, and the buttons press against my ears. I've been fussing with it all shift. I really want to like it, but..."
4.0,Love the design and the colors. It's a little weird the way the snaps are positioned.
4.0,"received in a timely manner and item as described.  The pocket is small once cards are inserted, but can still hold additional cards and some folded cash.  I'm not going to use the retractable clip but just use it as a front pocket mini-wallet.  item seems to be durable."
4.0,"nice belt, easy to adjust"
4.0,"The colors are great, but I do wish the beanie was a little slouchier. It's more of a sit-on-top-of-your-actual-head beanie rather than the picture depicts. Or maybe my heads big?<br /><br />;D"
4.0,Heavy chain. Robust seems to be real durable.
4.0,"Good price, good size, arrived earlier than expected which was nice. The only thing is that the fake rhinestone for the eye is not yellow. Overall I am really pleased with this product."
4.0,"Nice case, but a little big for my purse. I love the Vera Bradly glasses, however, I prefer their smaller zippered cases for my handbag. My old zipper case finally bit the dust after 4 years of constant wear. Looking for a new one."
4.0,I like the color. The mask should be larger.
4.0,"It's fine.  I'm not thrilled with seatbelt material, but it's not as obnoxious as most.  It doesn't keep me from wearing the watch, which I think is the main priority of a watch band."
4.0,"The patina isn’t quite as pretty on the earrings I received as it is on the ones in the photo. I’m going to wear them, but I’m a little sad I didn’t get something closer to the photo."
4.0,"Nice jewelry, arrived in a timely manner."
4.0,My husband really likes it. The only complaint is that the bill of the cap was bent in on both sides because the way it was shipped.
4.0,My son loves this jacket. It is NOT heavy.
4.0,"I like it a lot but it's REALLY hard to breathe because the holes on the nose are too small. Other than that, great purchase. And it comes with a little alien that glows in the dark!"
4.0,"The shorts seem to run small so they didn't work for my husband, but the seller was very responsive to my complaint about the sizing and issued a full refund immediately. Other than the sizing issue, the shorts seem to be very good quality"
4.0,Ok so I will give this 4 stars only because the material is very nice not cheap at all.  BUt omg is the bottom oh so very tiny.  The top actually almost fit.  I ordered a Medium and I'm 5'3 115 size 2 and busty up top 34D.  If that's any indication. But im gonna return for a Large and see how that goes.  If your unfit especially in bottom area your rolls will pop out all over so beware.  :)
4.0,"I love the polka dots, but the top was tight."
4.0,"Really great masks, my kid had lots of compliments. Fit him perfect in 4th grade, 9 years old. My biggest issue is that the string came apart on two of them and I had to mend them. Otherwise no complaints!"
4.0,"I received may compliments when i wore it to work, I wear leggings under it ."
4.0,"Cute!!! I gave it 4 stars because I had to purchase a thicker necklace but that was only a few bucks right here on Amazon. Gift was loved for Christmas, thanks!!!"
4.0,I love these slippers and am only giving 4 stars instead of 5 because I’m not used to wearing slippers with support (although I need it) around the house. I’ve discarded my old UGG slippers and will be wearing these from now on.
4.0,"The glasses work well, but the frames are too big for my face."
4.0,like this little knock off belt - leather is a little cheap and need to be careful with the beads.  But it's way better than the $1k Gucci price tag.
4.0,I needed these for a pair of Merrell shoes and they are not selling laces online for a few weeks.  They seem to be an exact match.
4.0,"I used the necklace because it's very pretty, but I paired it with another pearl, as the one that came in my oyster was oddly marked.  Overall, I'm very please considering the low price."
4.0,This is a little snug for our great granddaughter but I love how this hat keeps ears and neck covered from the cold
4.0,"very pretty,wonderful price,somewhat small though."
4.0,Fits over temple piece but often slides off. Maybe good on another temple piece.
4.0,"The top is very soft and very tropical, but I guess I'm to thin because it made me look pregnant"
4.0,"They look a lot bigger when you take them out of the bag, Our babe is consistently wearing 12-18 and sometimes 18m stuff and these fit maybe run slightly large, in the length and in the pants cube cause our girl even has chunky thighs and these are a little baggy.<br />Also love that the bow is long enough to easily tie!"
4.0,"a little tight on the sleeves and shorter than it looks, but it's very pretty and ione can use with shorts or pants"
4.0,"the charm is a reasonable size for a small charm. I am pleased with this purchase, it looks like the photo on amazon."
4.0,"Awesome dress, order a medium I am 5 feet 1 inch 130 lbs fits great below my knee"
4.0,"These seem expensive for what they are so I searched for and purchased a cheaper alternative, I'll be buying more Hoo-Rags next time."
4.0,bought 2 pair of &#34;SockGuy&#34; socks as a gift for my son-in-law because I know it's his favorite brand & he was quite pleased.
4.0,I LOVE THE SHIRT i WEAR A LARGE ALMOST EXTRA LARGE IN SHIRTS AND IT FITS BUT THE SLEEVES ARE A BIT TIGHT
4.0,"The box is a little broken upon arrival, but still works great for organizing my eyeshadow powders! Easy to use and looks better organized."
4.0,"If you are looking for the authentic Air Force PT shorts, this is it.  It's reflective material is nice and the webbing inside as well.  I normally wear medium to large.  But these must run slightly smaller than normal shorts because there were a little tight but still very usable."
4.0,These are cute. My daughter likes them. They are good quality and wash and wear well. Too small for my big 9.5 size feet.
4.0,"I have no experience with other similar products but what I received was about what I expected. The extra storage pouch that comes with the pair I thought was a nice visual addition but for me doesn’t serve much purpose. One thing I didn’t like was the little black locking mechanism that locks down the larger locking mechanism. It’s ackward to release and it wasn’t designed right at least with the batch I received. One of the pair that little black piece broke off upon first use of it. But all that said, it works now more like I would have thought where just the larger piece locks/toggles down and doesn’t really need that extra little clip. So all in all tho, the company was really responsive and refunded the cost. I sent them a pic of the broken one and they said they would work to provide a better model. I gave them a 4star because I have no idea if I just happed to have a random defect or what but the were really responsive."
4.0,"Looks good, plenty of room.  Would prefer that the inside lining was not loose.  Worked well for an extended trip."
4.0,I bought these as a gift for someone else.  They seem to be very nice ties and they arrived very quickly.
4.0,I was suppose to get 2 key chains with it and I only got 1. other then that i am happy with it
4.0,"The fabric seemed a little rough upon arrival, but after washing the kids seem to love it.  They say it is super comfortable & one of their new favorite sets of Jammies!"
4.0,We love these but with all the use they get - they do snag easy so they don't look very pretty for very long!
4.0,should have ordered a darker color if available? Stained pretty easily.  Nice size and easy to store everything you need.
4.0,Just ok..
4.0,"Absolutely love the look on it. I wear a large, and I will admit it was slightly snug near the chest, but fits great and is definitely worth purchasing"
4.0,"Nice, simple cuff links. Nothing too fancy, goes with most shirts."
4.0,"This hat fits great and I love the ponytail hole! The only issue is that the drawstring is sewn on unevenly. This makes the drawstring basically non-functional as tightening it up makes it either feel funny on your head or turn sideways, which doesn’t work if your ponytail is through the hole."
4.0,Huuuuuuge i have a large nose and its pierced high and this is huuuuuuuuuge. And it unhinges easily which could be good and bad easy to remove but i would imagine one nudge or harsh sneeze and itll be in your tissue. Overall good product and fast shipping. Not 5 stars because its so big
4.0,"Were good for the price. The edges were a little frayed on one side though, but still wearable"
4.0,Perfect size for my traditional charm bracelet. I love it but I do not expect the gems to stay after taking a daily wear beating.  If it's for occasional wear should last in my experience and opinion.  Will order from this company again.
4.0,Fit was perfect. These pants are just the right weight for year round wear. Just a little flex to make it totally comfortable. Bought 1 and ordered 3 more pairs after the first fit. Would give it a five if they we a little cheaper. Marshalls is but fishing though the hit and miss racks is not worth it.
4.0,"Buy it!! It’s absolutely beautiful, the material is very nice and soft. I got the small size and it was kind of loose on my hips.  I’m 5’2 , 140 lbs my measurements are 36, 29, 40."
4.0,"Super thin material and elastic. I gave it a four bc it was cheap, easy to breathe through, and bc I was able to change the elastic to sit on my head and not my ears. Also the material is really soft.<br /><br />My husband has hearing aids and needed something he could take on and off so sending his hearing aids flying. Not as big of a deal but I wear glasses. We tie the elastic like surgical masks, this keeps the mask more snugly on our faces.<br /><br />The fabric is about as thin as it gets. It may keep some stuff out but if you are serious about not getting sick, you’ll need more than this. But if you are looking for a face mask that allows you to comfortably follow the rules at a bare minimum, this is for you!<br /><br />Honestly, this could be as good or better than thicker masks that attach around your earlobes. The mask is only as good as it’s weakest point. Or it’s biggest gap in my case. The earlobe ones have large gaps for me."
4.0,Little pricy. But free shipping so is not bad
4.0,The ears dont stand up on their own.  I filled them with foam surrounding chop sticks.  That worked for me.
4.0,"I am 5'10&#34; 135lbs, I ordered a Med. and this covers me about like the photo of the model. This is a nice, comfy, easy to care for, well fitting piece."
4.0,Cute shirt. Thinner material than expected but if there is an undershirt you're fine!
4.0,Bought for my Harry Potter fan daughter. It’s cute.
4.0,"Doesn't seem like it will last long, easily creased then won't lay flat enough"
4.0,Buena presencia esperamos la calidad y durabilidad sea igual
4.0,"I gave four stars instead five because I want to buy more medium size : I look, I look, months go away and impossible to have it !!!!! just small or large :-(((((((((("
4.0,seems strong and solid gold.. VERY THIN though. But good good quality
4.0,Very light but does scratch easy but very well priced
4.0,Great eye catcher!!
4.0,"Good quality shirt, fit is more athletic than loose, but not tight by any means.<br />Sleeves could be a tad longer.  I am 6' tall average build male with long arms, I waiver between L and XL, If the sleeves were just a bit longer it would be perfect.  Overall I am satisfied."
4.0,"If you’re looking for pandora quality- this isn’t it, but for the price- it’s pretty"
4.0,"Nice concept, but first one only half worked, but they did replace it with one that works well."
4.0,"I love this purse!  I'm petite (under 5ft) so everything that seems to be trending is just way too big for my short frame.  This is a small bag, but has plenty of space for all of my modest necessities.  Also, the color is fun and vibrant without being overwhelming.  The material is durable and easy to wash and doesnt appear to scratch or scuff easily.  The purse has 3 sections (2 with snaps and the center zips) plus an inside zipper pocket and two inside pouches, so organization is easy.  I would have given 5 stars if the over-the-shoulder strap wasn't so long.  Even on the smallest adjustment, the purse hangs to mid thigh on me, making it uncomfortable to walk.  I tried wearing as a cross body but the purse is a bit too boxy to pull that off.  It's detachable,  so I removed it and I just carry the bag by the handles, which can be troublesome when you need 2 free hands.  Overall, I'm very pleased."
4.0,"Greatest Wallet I have ever had,just wish the zipper closed off the whole thing and didn't leave one side open"
4.0,"No sizing chart, didn't fit. I would say it's a misses 12/14. Also the belt is a little too wide for the buckle, which is kind of shoddy. Gave it to my daughter who it fit. But it was intended for me..."
4.0,I read the reviews and ordered a size X-Large (normally wear a Medium). They fit perfectly! The are nice and long (I am tall and always have trouble getting leggings/jeggings that are long enough) and feel very soft and comfortable. I like the brown color and plan to wear a beige chunky sweater with these.
4.0,I love this dress it fits perfectly the only thing is it's a little sheer in the sunlight you can see A little too much haven't bought a slip ever ever so don't know how I'm gonna solve this part of the problem. But  otherwise a nice dress
4.0,"The purse itself is beautiful and high quality. The only downside is that it is very small. It barely fits a wallet, phone and a few other little items. It is a great purse for a night out but I'm not sure I would recommend it for every day use."
4.0,"this item was ordered prior to an event that my husband needed to attend.  it arrived the day before we departed and was packed, inside the plastic bag it arrived in, and placed inside the wardrobe luggage.  When it was time to wear the jacket, it fit perfectly and was of a very nice quality.  thank you"
4.0,"Bought this to replace a Tumi messenger that was way too heavy. I was also tired of the poor ergonomics of a messenger. I researched for a couple of weeks and tried a few bags and this one got the most right. I didn’t like the ebags name but I got over it. I like the compartments a lot, it’s a very good size. I wish it was a tad bigger like the weekender they have, except the weekender doesn’t come in this LTD color combo.<br /><br /> Very practical, fit a lot in it... even a large 3” binder after some serious cramming! Love the outer U pouch. You don’t realize you need this until you have it.  Other bags with slit pouches are totally useless when the bag is full... too much tightness when it’s full to even use them. A U pouch solves that, you get full access no matter how full.<br /><br />The L zips are ok tho I wish the middle was a full U. Still good tho because at least you can access the compartments while it’s upright or in briefcase mode.  The material seems thin though, I’m not sure how long it will last.<br /><br />Quite comfortable to wear and I like the adjustable sternum straps.<br /><br />After seeing it matched up with my travelpro I can’t get myself to get the weekender unless they make it in this color.<br /><br />Loses a star Because could be a hair bigger, and L zip main compartments, and I wish it was ballistic nylon. The material doesn’t seem durable.<br /><br />Still, it’s excellent and I’m very happy with it."
4.0,nice watch. the stone is bumbed a bit high
4.0,The backs of the posts were kind of long so i just trimmed them and the earrings were good to go. 👌🏼
4.0,"I am pleased with the material and design overall, but I could/should have sized down. I ordered a medium - I’m 5’2”, and 130ish. These would have looked better if I’d ordered a small."
4.0,"Runs smaller then expected so order a size or two larger.  Nice clean printing with vibrant colors, no loose stitching."
4.0,I like this shirt. But I wish it had more stretch to it.
4.0,"Pros - beautiful color, dress does follow the size chart, price is reasonable, easy to put on and take off, it’s stunning and elegant<br />Cons - material makes you itch, loose on the stomach area but extra tight on the legs, open back will have a lot of extra room if you do not pick the right size"
4.0,Great price and did their job
4.0,"This hat and glove set is cozy and warm for the current fall weather. The gloves are comfortable. The ability to use my phone while wearing them wasn't the greatest - my phone did not detect the touch when the screen was locked but did detect it once I unlocked it. I don't see this as a huge downside as the only time I would use my phone while wearing gloves is if I get a call or something that can't wait until I get back inside.<br /><br />The hat is so nice, but there are inserts in the ear flap area - one of them was slightly curled when I opened the package, so I had to spend some time shaping it back flatter. This is likely not a hat that I would shove in a pocket or bag because I would be too worried about bending that insert. This hat is also warm enough that I'll be able to use it all winter long!"
4.0,Fun pants and quality reflected by price.  Inexpenive so quality of item isn't great but still adequate for casual wear.
4.0,I tried these on at a local store but they only had size 7 and up. I figured I could order my usual size 6. I think a 5 1/2 would have been better. But I like these shoes mainly because they have a built-in arch support. Like a little foam pad right at the arch. And they are cute.
4.0,Very comfortable. I wear them for jogging and do not even notice that I have them on.
4.0,"Fits nicely,  material was just unexpected. Many complements the night I wore out to dinner."
4.0,I think the chain is too light for a man. It was as described but it was my fault I didn’t know how thin it would be. I wouldn’t hesitate to shop with you again.
4.0,Love the color . These pants are well made and not see threw . I would definitely  recommend  these workout pants.
4.0,"These socks are extremely comfortable and stylish. I've only had mine for about a week now, but they seem like they will last for a long time."
4.0,"I love this set. Oddly- mine looks nothing like some of the other photos. It’s a nice thick ribbed seamless knit. Not see through at all, and I got the white (I mean maybe if I was wearing brightly colored granny undies and bent over or something)<br />My only comment is the neckline on the front of the bra is a little uneven. Other than that, it’s awesome. I will definitely be ordering another. I hope it’s the same!"
4.0,"They’re so cute but I think I’ll be returning. They just look smaller than they should for the size I ordered. I’m waiting for my daughter to try them on after she gets them for Christmas to decide if I’m returning. If I’m wrong and they fit, I’ll come back and give 5 star"
4.0,"Used it over a bathing suit in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.  Looks very nice.  Can also be used as a coverup over<br />pajamas.  Price very reasonable."
4.0,"I really like this anklet/bracelet.  I wear it on my wrist and love the color of the beads.  My only issue was that the connector to the clasp fell off  when I opened it.  I can fix it though, so no issues since I am still able to wear the bracelet."
4.0,The four stars is because the nylon strap slides on my shoulders and is very annoying.  I swap a cloth strap to put on it.  Doesn't match but works.
4.0,"I bought it as a gift.  She wasnt really feeling it and accused me of having bad fashion taste.  The material feels quality and I think it’s a nice shirt.  If you like the pattern, buy it. I usually do good getting her a large but this time a large was too big."
4.0,Arrived quickly and was exactly as seen on the picture. Really looks elegant and suitable for everyday use.
4.0,"Super cute, my boy loves them, but we ordered blue and red. It’s not red, it’s pink. Won’t stop us from using them, though."
4.0,"Very decent sweater for the price. Versatile and can probably be worn three seasons of the year. I was concerned that something &#34;one size&#34; would be too small, but it fits loose and comfortable on my size 14, though not as gigantic as it is shown on the model picture obviously. I have worn it a lot. So far over a tank and skinny jeans and also with leggings and a long sleeve tunic in colder weather. I think it would look good over a simple maxi dress too. I ordered the beige color and it's pretty and then later ordered the charcoal too, though it looks black in person, which is fine with me. Didn't give it five stars because the synthetic material it's woven from seams to be matting and looking worn pretty quickly."
4.0,"They're okay, not just like the picture shows. I will still recommend it."
4.0,Could use bobby pin to keep in place
4.0,Sort of seems fitted on my husband. I thought he would return it but he likes it.6
4.0,"Perfectly functional top. Odd gaping in the armholes, might work better on a smaller busted person (I'm 36C)"
4.0,Very nice. Where the chain meets the ends before the clasp it's a welded blob. But for the price it's very nice.
4.0,Good deal 👌
4.0,Looks and fit adjustment is great.  They only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the edges could have been finished a little more to take off the sharpness of them.  This would have made the band a lot more comfortable to wear.  It was delivered quickly and was well packed.
4.0,I've had this bag for about 8 months. I haven't gotten to use it but 2/3 times due to covid. I'm out on vacation and the main zipper broke on it as I was walking out of the hotel. I love this bag but am disappointed.
4.0,"Very nice except I didn't like the thick strap of Velcro or the fact the hood did not have the elastic like it said. It is too big for my newborn but overall I'm not too upset  oh, the Velcro is at thr chin and hits and rubs"
4.0,Very pretty. One stone was loose. But they look good on.
4.0,"These sunglasses appear to be good quality, came in a nice felt pouch, but they are way too big for my almost 3 year old, who has a big head :)<br />I’m going to save them for when he gets older, but I would say these are kids sized, not toddler. Can’t speak to the durability or sturdiness, but they are very nice."
4.0,Nice product. Glad I made the purchase.
4.0,"I like, but, I'm so hoping for TRUTH when you say, 'ULV Protection ' cause that's the true reason i need them, so, is it true?"
4.0,some of the brown colors have an odd X at the bridge. I had to return mine and buy another
4.0,These collar stays are great. different sizes are convenient and the price was perfect. I use them every day. The only thing that would make these better is if they were magnetic. They were accurately described and shipped quickly.
4.0,Seems to be a nice necklace
4.0,"One of the rings was a bit stiff, making it very hard to open, put in, and close again. Other ring was perfect. Note the size - the hoop is a bit bigger than I thought from the pics, but the quality is fine and the price is good."
4.0,Very nice shirt overall. There were several loose threads at the hem so hope this won’t affect it in the wash. Order up for the loose fit like in photo. A bit thicker then expected but still good running shirt.
4.0,Small trinket size
4.0,Bought these for my adult kangaroo-loving daughter.. they are pretty!
4.0,Charm holder broke to easily
4.0,COS Instant Face Lift is fabulous!  Best product of this type I’ve used.
4.0,Lots of possibilities. Love it.
4.0,I wanted to love this dress (pale pink with rufflea). Im sure this is very flattering on some people. I thought it would be maternity but the cut doesnt lend to that. I thought I'd like it better once I was no longer pregnant and I don't. The ruffles look awkward in person. It was a bust for me.
4.0,"Beautiful scarf, lightweight, hands nicely. It is more of I a mint green than teal, but still lovely. Vender shipped much faster than expected!"
4.0,Great fit and stretch.
4.0,"Appropriate thickness. Comfortable also. I do have to say, the last 7 inches of material on the sleeves is very snug, so you can't roll up the sleeves. The bottom panel is tight too, to give it that tapered look. I generally wear small but I went with the medium and I noted this. Not so tight that I would call it fitting small, but I think it was done that way to achieve the look."
4.0,I was worried about the size but it ended up being perfect.  I have to be careful when ordering because I'm large on top and smaller on the bottom. I ordered a medium but was concerned it would be too small on top.  It was perfect.  I can put a cute little sweater with it and wear it to work.  I can wear it as is and be great for a sunny day out.
4.0,They take a little to get used to. But they keep your ears warm even in the wind.
4.0,Helps a lot while you are working.
4.0,"I have purchased these leggings in 2 colors. They are great! The pockets are great for carrying small things, especially if I am wearing these with a dress. I love the high waist too (actually high waist!). I'm not sure it is very tummy controlling, but that doesn't bother me.<br /><br />The thing I don't like is that the fabric between the two colors was different! The purple was a delightful soft polyester blend that was warm and perfect for lounging in. The black was a standard nylon/spandex blend, which was disappointing because I wanted the other fabric. It is unclear from the description which leggings will be made out of which fabric."
4.0,"I bought these for the compression aspect, but it doesn't really compress. The one size would probably be O.K. If I were a man. Me being a lady, I guess my arms are smaller which gives less compression. I will say that it is comfortable to wear and cooling despite the black color. Also, when I washed it, the thread started to come out so I took a star away for that! (Sad face)"
4.0,Looks good on my son. I'm satisfied
4.0,"very good quality, the gloves are very elegant! and the presentation is excellent ... the only negative thing is that the index finger does not work to use the phone"
4.0,"Cute enough. I mainly wear one or two from the set, but worth the price."
4.0,The bands are like the original one I had.  They are all hard to fasten but the price is good.
4.0,"I got this for my husband to wear to my daughter's Christmas party at school (the theme is Elf). Overall the quality is what you'd expect for the price. You can wear it a few times, but that's about it. I purchased a XXL and the pants were barely long enough for my husband, and he's only 6 ft. The pants are thin and show off every leg hair, so I would recommend wearing long johns or some other pants underneath. The shoe covers are large. My husband was able to fit them over size 13W tennis shoes. The tip at the toes didn't want to stand up so we plan on stuffing it with cotton or some other material. I'd recommend not putting the covers on until it's necessary. I could see the bottoms tearing up pretty quickly. It's like any other costume you purchase - there will always be problems. Overall, it gets the job done."
4.0,I can't really explain it but they look matronly in person. The quality is fine but not my style I guess.
4.0,My doctor requested that I wear them for a 16 hour flight.
4.0,"Like the material, space and the handles construction. It would have been great if it had an additional strap to carry it on the shoulder. Still it is a good purchase and the price was great!"
4.0,"So I have a bracelet exactly like this that I got from box store many years ago. Was excited to find this necklace to go with it, since it matched perfectly.  I like it, but my only complaint is that it's almost too overpowering as a necklace.  It might be just me and my body type, but I'm not sure where to wear this.  The beach?  The gym?  The BBQ?  I intentionally got it long to hold a pill carrier as well, so maybe a shorter version would have worked better for fashion, but overall I still like it a lot."
4.0,I like the length and fit of this top. The white is a little thin - I would not feel comfortable wearing it without a shirt that closes in front because you can see the shadow of my belly button and the waist of my pants.  But the dark colors would probably be fine.
4.0,I love the way it fits and covers my breast so I am not showing clevage
4.0,"Good goggles, but probably for a more serious swimmer than me.  These have an attached set of earplugs that really just got in the way as we bought these for playing around in the pool with our kids vs swimming laps.  The lap swimmer would probably appreciate this feature more than I do.  Of course the easy fix will be to just cut the ear plugs off.  The goggles are very comfortable and no issues with fogging or leaking.  The strap was easy to adjust and has a quick attach/release buckle on the back.  These goggles were sold at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.  Oh, the set did come with extra earplugs and a nose plug which was a nice bonus."
4.0,Cute dress. Very thin material so it will be great for where we're going on vacation.
4.0,The dress runs small. I normally wear M/L (8) and ordered a size L and it was just a little too small. Will need a steam or ironing because it arrives with a lot of wrinkles.<br /><br />I wish it fit! Really pretty and staple dress!
4.0,"very fashion, nice"
4.0,Runs small. Size up. Very cute
4.0,Cute and dainty yet hole for stone is extremely small and time consuming to put on.
4.0,If the written instructions were just a little bit bigger it would've been better.
4.0,They’re very pretty! Smaller than I expected though.
4.0,"THIS SKIRT IS SO CUTE, BUT DAAANGG IS IT SHORT IN BACK! THE SEAM IS ALSO A LITTLE UNEVEN IN THE BACK."
4.0,"Absolutely obsessed with color!  Yellow backpack is a vibrant color but I figure overtime it’ll start to mellow yellow (lol),  perfect size for daily things or traveling,  The only trouble that I noticed with it is the non-custom sizable strap moving it unbuckles but it still leaves that hard buckle strap flapping  and the material of it isn’t like a backpack material it’s more of a hard carport like material but I figure that’ll also soften as I use it, All in all four stars I give it just because I was super excited about getting this backpack!"
4.0,"I like it at the price. The clip could have a little more tension IMO.  I didn't buy  it for credit cards but was tempted to try that pull tab feature...don't.  My credit card got stuck in there because the opening was smaller than the width of the card. Had a heck of a time getting it out.  Hence, 4 starts."
4.0,"This is a good quality shirt. It came quickly and it looks great. The reason I give it 4 stars is that my usual shirt length was a little large so I’m sure if I ordered a smaller one it would be fine, but beware"
4.0,"These are nice earrings, however, if you have smaller ears, they are a little bit large. Other than that, they are nicely made."
4.0,Doesn't stretch as well as other pairs I have
4.0,The fit seems to be good for 3rd and 4th grade kids. I coach basketball and needed some jerseys to help keep track of the teams during practice. These work well but some kids seem to be confused on how to put them on since they are not like traditional pinnies.
4.0,"These are beautiful for the value. My only issue is they are not flat on the back as in the picture, it is tapered which doesn't work for me but my daughter appreciates them."
4.0,"I bought this looking for a sexy but simple dress for a night out with the girls. I didn't realize it was a V-neck when I bought it but that's on me for not paying close enough attention. If it had been a scoop neck it would have looked a lot better. Overall the dress was a soft material, somewhat stretchy, light and super comfortable to wear.<br /><br />However, I'm returning it for a few reasons. #1 the neck hole is so small. I prefer a V-neck to show some collarbone and it was a really high neck. #2 it's so long. I'm 5'6.5"" (what I consider average-ish height?) and it was long enough to be work appropriate. The front and back are a few inches above my knees and the sides are not that much higher. It is cute and comfy but NOT a mini dress. #3 it's not sexy. It's cute and would look great with a pair of converse during the summer."
4.0,"This is my new ""go to"" jacket this winter. It's so soft and warm!"
4.0,I ordered these for my tweens to trick or treat.  The bags fold into their own carry case so now we each have one in our purse for when we’re out shopping.
4.0,"This is really a 4.5 star review. I asked my husband to try out this Ultra Thin Quartz Fashion Watch and he really liked it. He was impressed that it came in a rustic looking cloth case, and included a small screwdriver for adjusting the bracelet clasp. He was also impressed by the watch's beautiful blue minimalist dial. My husband said the simple 2-hand dial is uncluttered and modern looking. The white hands contrasted against the dark, sunburst blue dial makes it very easy to read the time. He also liked how the lugs are hooded and cover the area where the watch case connects with the mesh bracelet. It keeps all the lines of the watch clean looking. The watch has been running well and keeping the right time since it was set last week. The only issue my husband found was some stiffness when turning the crown to set the time. Other than that, he gave the thumbs up to this attractive minimalist watch."
4.0,"It is a fine pair.  I suggest when you order, get 1/2 size larger."
4.0,Looks great very lightweight basic Timeless look.
4.0,"Seemed to be easily breakable, but I have had no problems thus far and it came in 2 days before the expected arrival date!"
4.0,"I'm a size 14/16, size 38G bra, 5'4 and purchased the XL in the burgundy color.  It fits perfectly and is very flattering on my figure, even with my tummy.  Not too short, coming right to my knees.  It emphasizes and conceals, if that makes sense.  I wanted to purchase another in black, but it's sold out in my size.  Don't hesitate on this one, ladies!  Fantastic value for a great dress that you can wear casual or dress up a little."
4.0,"Sturdy quality, which I was looking for to replace the cheaper ones I always get for motorcycle riding. Had to bend the nose pads various ways before they were comfortable enough. They are still a little uncomfortable on my nose after about an hour."
4.0,"Fits as expected in waist, chest, shoulders. The outfit length however is super short. The dress will need to be worn with leggings I  order to cover all necessary body parts from showing."
4.0,"little too big, but ok to wear, the text draw some eyeball."
4.0,"They work. I bought the 2+ reader bifocals and the magnification is right. The reader portion is, I'm guessing, the lower half of the lens and the top half is just clear glass with no magnification or distortion that I notice. Frames are pretty cheap and flimsy but they work. These were inexpensive... less than what I would pay at the drugstore so I have no complaints. These really work best when I read and watch tv at the same time or at church reading Bible while watching the pastor speak."
4.0,Fits a little snug for an extra large.  May need to go up a size.  Other then that loved the shirt
4.0,runs a little short for liking but it was fine
4.0,"Purchased this dress to take on vacation to the Caribbean. This was my fun dress. Love the vibrant colors, free flowing and made me feel good. Had lots of compliments. The dress is light and airy and takes up little to know room in your suitcase."
4.0,It's very warm and comfortable. Extremely durable. My only complaint is that the collar gets folded kinda weird and doesnt want to stay strait. I'm sure a little ironing could correct that though.
4.0,Love it perfect length
4.0,Buyer's remorse...Don't fit well enough over my glasses.  I can wear them to drive the distance from friends' homes but no longer than that.  I wrongly assumed any of the glasses would fit the same.  I'll try on before I buy next pair.
4.0,"These dresses are the perfect length for a shortie like me. I would have liked the top part a little longer, just one ot two more inches. It falls above my waistline, it could be because I am busty. But the fit is comfortable."
4.0,"Pretty good product , will buy a size smaller.. I guess I’m just not as built as well as I thought I was"
4.0,TBD
4.0,This is a really nice checkbook cover. The only thing I didn't like about it was that you can't put a pen inside of it and have it fold closed properly.
4.0,Beautiful necklace. Perfectly dainty.
4.0,I just didn’t like how it fit in me.
4.0,"Decently made, lot of great pockets."
4.0,Very nice... very comfortable
4.0,"I really do love these pants to wear around to class, or errands, or pretty much anywhere but the gym. They are definitely not squat proof. They are see-through anytime you squat. They are very flattering and very comfortable."
4.0,this watch was just what i was looking for but its just a bit to snug for my wrist so i will be sending it back :( wish there was a link i could add.
4.0,"I purchased a 9-10 after reading reviews on this product. I usually wear  mens 9.5 U.S. sizing. Too small. I should have gone one up to an 11-12. When in doubt, g o up a size is the moral of the story. In spite of this, I am very pleased with the seller, as they did all they could to make the order right, and ensure a satisfied customer experience."
4.0,Ordered this as a gift. Nice weight & fit. Would recommend. Difficult to find snap front.
4.0,Perfect shirt! This is made of plain t-shirt material so it's pretty lightweight. The design is cute. I would give it 5 stars if it were a little softer or fleece-y on the inside.
4.0,"Good quality, but a little small. My 8 year old wears them. They are too small for my 11 and 14 year old."
4.0,Really like the bands and the price. I have smaller wrists and they fit great. Not too sure that they would fit large or medium wrists. Great product!
4.0,It's very cute but the top does run a little small.
4.0,"Fit was perfect, lenses a bit thinner than original. All in all happy with purchase."
4.0,"This is a decent size and looks professional! It even came with a re-sealable plastic case for storage, which is nice since since I plan on travelling with it. Downside is the backing is cardboard; it's sturdy, but I probably wouldn't put too much weight on it OR leave it near liquids~"
4.0,Beautiful jacket!! Well made :) I have broad shoulders so it fits a little snug but it's still a keeper.
4.0,"Im 5.2&#34; tall and 125 pounds and it fits perfectly, the fabric is ok and the quality is good for the price I paid for it.<br />My only complaint is that the color pink is more like<br />peach or coral and not really  pinky but overall I'm happy with my purchase."
4.0,wife found this necklace a nice addition to her stock
4.0,"The shirt fit as it was supposed to. I actually wore it tucked it this time, as I did not want to look bigger than I already am, so by tucking it in I felt somewhat slimmer with a belt on. However, the color of the shirt is beautiful. I love that the green is great for summer and early fall. It is lightweight for the summer and can be paired with a sweater for the fall. I may buy another color of this one."
4.0,"Its a bit difficult to get off my wrist because it just loosens (but will not detach). Other than this issue, its exactly what I wanted."
4.0,I am a small but I ordered the smallest size which was small/medium and it was a little baggy but overall good quality and did not skrink when washed.
4.0,"the XL size was labeled as up to 5'9"", i would say im about average build (only a slight muffin top above the waist) 5'8"", the belt it came with was to short to velcro it, was able to tape it in the back to fix that problem, but it felt to short length wise barely reached my knees at all<br /><br />so i would recommend going 1 size up<br /><br />also the earrings took a while to notice they were with the wig, and they make a decent decoration i suppose"
4.0,"I bought these since my daughter hates footed tights and I haven't come across cheaper footless tights, only convertible tights. I bought expensive dance store tights that ripped after a few wears. Right now they're okay, but tight on the ankles. My daughter says they're not too tight or uncomfortable."
4.0,"The dress is nice. The tunic is well-made. The bottom of the dress is made of tulle, so it is a little stiff and not flowy as pictured. The lack of movement and flow is why I gave it 4 stars. The picture featured for this dress is a little deceptive."
4.0,"I was able to wear these right out of the package.  Length was just right.  Cut is full enough that they are confortable while sitting, like driving on long trips.  The extra materal at the elastic wasteline is bulky, though and I do need a belt."
4.0,Ordered for my wife. She loves the yellow stripes. Flattering and fits well. She’s 5’7” and 180 lbs.
4.0,Not an actual scarf but super cute print. I wore it as a top and it was super cute. Looks like a versace print
4.0,"In 5 months it broke at the buckle. It is held together by to little pins, not like a normal watch where the pin goes all the way through the hole in the band."
4.0,Buy a size up. Think fabric so you'll need dark underwear or something underneath. But fits nicely and colour looks great. (Size up!)<br /><br />Hips: 40&#34; I got xl and it fits snug but not tight
4.0,"I love this cardigan coat hoodie. It’s for fashion, not to keep you warm. The material is a little cheap but only when looking really close. The green is very solid army green. The hood is dramatically oversized.<br /><br />I’m 5’9 200lb athletic built male and this is the right fit for me. The sleeves DO NOT come to my wrist but I wear those pushed up to my elbows anyway."
4.0,"I orded a small. Could be a little more fitted, but very cute. Fabric a little on the thin side, but can't really see through them very much."
4.0,"Fits small. Order a size up, especially if you have larger arms."
4.0,"Super comfy and stay on very well but they get holes in the toe area very quickly.  I just sew mine back up really quickly, but it’s annoying.  There are better quality out there."
4.0,Like the product not very easy to move in and makes u smell like burnt tires but does work in regard to sweat production.
4.0,"The material is much softer and more comfortable for all-day wear than the cheaper competitors.  I am docking one star because I agree with other reviewers that these are not ""easy on.""  I'm a 57-year-old woman of average strength and it takes me a lot of effort to put them on.  If I were older or disabled I would not be able to do it.  Other than that, these offer perfect support for a long day on your feet, and they are not scratchy against the skin."
4.0,"I just didn't like how it sat on me due to the neck line, and it hunched up around the armpits, BUT it's an item of clothing. What looks bad on me might look fantastic on someone else. Otherwise, seemed like a great product."
4.0,"Very comfortable fit, even for 2X people!  I enjoy the compression support it gives you and the UV protection.  When RA starts to act up I can put on the Sleeves and give instant relief!  I strongly recommend this product!"
4.0,Just a wee bit small.  The &#34;girls&#34; aren't going anywhere in this.  Definitely high impact.  Slightly difficult to get on and on.  Seems well made/high quality.
4.0,runs quite large. the material is not great quality but isn't bad at all.
4.0,"I purchased this top for family photos & honestly I love it.  I was disappointed to find a seam that wasn't sewn all the way but it was such an easy fix that I stitched it & moved on with the photos.  I would've given this top 5 stars but with a seam error, I felt it deserved 4 instead.  That didn't stop me though from ordering it again in red & honestly I love both.  The colors are very pretty & somewhat muted, and the chiffon detail at the bottom adds the perfect touch.  The material is stretchy & it fits true to size.  I would suggest this top to anyone!"
4.0,Arrived quicker than expected. Seems well made. Only complaint is that is it to big. The velcro in back isn’t long enough to make a secure fit for me. I would say I’m very average in head/neck size so I was surprised by this. It’s an easy enough thing to fix by adding more velcro but still kind of annoying.
4.0,"They are nice earrings; the quality is good.  However, they look smaller on the internet.  I would prefer  if they were slightly smaller."
4.0,"Sadly I had to return this suit.  I loved the look, the bottoms fit great, but the top was way to small....and smashed the &#34;girls&#34; and they don't need to look smaller!  It did not come in a larger size, so could not reorder."
4.0,Exactly as pictured.  I am pleased!
4.0,Go up like 2 sizes no stretch cute fun piece
4.0,"The bag is very cute and holds more than you would think. My only complaint is that, after a few month's of regular use, some of the stitching is coming apart."
4.0,"Material is a little thin, but nice style and fit"
4.0,"Comfortable.  Easy hand wash, dries fast."
4.0,"I ordered one of these, it got lost in the mail (as reported on the shipping tracker), so Amazon sent me another pair. A few weeks later the other pair did eventually show up, so now I have two. And they are not even close to the same color!! They should be identical but one is a deeper true navy (though still seems a little gray) and the other is basically a dark lavender/purple color. It's fine, I can't complain since I got two for the price of one, just be prepared even though you are ordering navy it might not be the true navy you're looking for."
4.0,The white shirt underneath was a bit shirt but overall a nice outfit
4.0,"Decent skirt for the price. Fabric has a little sheen to it, but isn't excessively shiny. It's somewhat sheer, but the fullness of the skirt keeps it from being see-through when worn. Lightweight for summer."
4.0,2x fits like a 1x but very pretty
4.0,Great dress. Bust could use a little bit of improvement but overall great quality.
4.0,Although it was a little more snug than expected… very flattering.
4.0,I purchased it for shoulder surgery
4.0,NO GOOD QUALITY
4.0,spring pins are thinner than original pins on my diver watch and therefore had to use Zulu's pins to fit into their watch band. Also the buckle has no spring bar to change out to use buckle came with my watch which is black ion plated.
4.0,It's a belt. I used it to hold up my pants.
4.0,Pretty. Doesn't fall as well as the picture makes it look though
4.0,"I wear a small band with my charge 3, and this will fit any wrist.  Just too big for me.  I did love the two tempered glass screen protectors that were bundled with it, so I wear it occasionally when I need a brown leather band.  I may have it cut down.  It is good quality leather."
4.0,"I ordered a size M. The dress is actually very very pretty. I love the colors. I am 5' 6"" and unfortunately it was a little shorter than I would like. I have ordered a large to see if maybe it will be a little longer.  The only other issue I have is that the armholes are pretty small ... a little uncomfortable."
4.0,"I bought this for my mom for a Christmas gift. She of course, is a mom and easy to please, but she did say that she likes the necklace.  One thing she mentioned, which I thought was interesting, was that she likes how easy the clasp is to do and undo.  I never thought about that feature in a necklace, but for older ladies, it seems like a good one! She likes that she can put it on herself and not bug my dad to do it...I rated it 4 instead of 5 because I never actually saw the piece, had it sent along to mom (out of state) directly from Amazon."
4.0,"Wearing in the cold weather , and they stood test for me."
4.0,Nice polishing cloth. Like it.
4.0,i gave this bracelt to my best friends 15 year old daughter who is a country gal. she loves it. it is realkly unique!~~~ wish i would have gotten a few....the only complaint i have is shipping was EXTREAMLY HIGH~~~~~``
4.0,Fits as expected.  Was a gift for the wifey and she loves it. Great quality!  5'8&#34;. 115. Ordered a Small.
4.0,Love my jacket true to size
4.0,This is a replacement to the one I bought my husband years ago that is falling apart. He really likes these wallets because they are so much thinner in his pocket.
4.0,So cute! I ordered a medium and was a tad too big for me in the arm length and waist. I'm 5'4 145. I probably could have ordered a small but it was comfortable. I received several compliments while I was out and about.
4.0,"I'm waiting for a size smaller to come in, I went by measurements and it was just a little too loose to be perfectly flattering. It's VERY long. I'm 5'6"", got the xxl, and I'd have to wear wedges or heels or get it hemmed to even walk in it. But I guess it's better than it being way too short. I'm really excited to see if the other size fits better and isn't too long, because otherwise it's very comfortable and pretty (and, you know....pockets!)"
4.0,"Beautiful bracelet! The only negative is that it's a bit big, but other than that, I love it!"
4.0,it's okay. And very light and confortable. it comes with the box.
4.0,This is my third and last  pair of these ear rings I'm buying. Had to replace the first pair because one got lost. Had to replace the second pair because the post broke off.  I hope this pair is for keeps. I love the way they look. I love fresh water pearls.
4.0,Lamentablemente pedí una talla menos a la mía.<br />La tela es como satinada<br />Pero son lindos.
4.0,Haven't used the wallet yet but I like that it has many slots for various cards
4.0,"These are nice but the legs slide up the my thighs big time. Wish I would have sized down but I didn’t based on other reviews & recommended size. I’m 5’6”, 120 lbs and got a small. Extra small probably would have fit better. Nice material and love the pockets but not practical for any athletic activity bc the legs basically slide up to my crotch."
4.0,"Nice product - fit well; my boyfriend likes it, but the seller tells me it's hand wash only - that cost them one star."
4.0,Has a sapphire crystal and high quality citizen auto movement. The band is a poor simulation but is leather. The setup is great and I didn’t need instructions. Luminosity was good. Great for what is available on Amazon for the money.
4.0,"These sunglasses are super cute and have a glam vibe. The dark lenses are perfect for the beach. The solid nosepads are comfortable and do not leave any pressure marks - and they don't get tangled in your hear when you flip them up ""headband"" style."
4.0,"With the changeable weather of fall, I have been looking for some comfortable clothes I can layer. This jacket is a great addition to my wardrobe.<br /><br />With 95% cotton and 5% Spandex, the fabric is lightweight and breathable. It’s got just the right amount of “give,” but doesn’t lose its shape. Contrary to what was indicated on the care label, it can be machine-washed in cold water on the delicate cycle—preferably without an agitator—and then tumble-dried. Be sure to remove and hang it immediately, to prevent wrinkles.<br /><br />The style is cute, with the ruffled edge along the lower edges of the jacket and the sleeves. The collar with lapels makes it suitable for a professional environment. Or it can be paired with a patterned T-shirt and jeans. It was a perfect compliment to the tiered black Bohemian skirt I wear to church! I’m not sure this is a $25+ item, but it’s definitely a great addition to my wardrobe."
4.0,"Loved it in this hot weather,Great airy fabric  but a bit uncomfortable getting in and out of it when going to the rest room"
4.0,Nice pants. They are a little snug by the waist but sit right and they will work! You do have to press them some after wash but that’s ok. Arizona gets hot and these colors and fabric will work!
4.0,"Cute high waisted shorts that are tight but not too tight. I'm 5'8"" 150-160lbs and XXL fit perfect! You can see very visible sweat through all colors so I recommend them for lounge/casual stuff only. For the price, I think they're worth it. XO"
4.0,Basic functional harness
4.0,"Good quality , very Fast Delivery"
4.0,Great product! I will definitely buy more of these. Maybe a little snug is my only complaint.
4.0,"This is a fine product.  However, I bought a different brand that my husband likes better."
4.0,"I like this leotard, it is a little bit larger than what I expected but it is a minimum detail because I can wear it without issues."
4.0,They don't provide the best arch support but my daughter loves them and has no complaints about wearing them all day.
4.0,"If you like form-fitting as I do, this shirt is for you. If you wear a medium, order a large though. Men must be slighter of build where this product is manufactured. Looks sharp on an athletic body."
4.0,"I have worn Hanes cotton briefs for years; they're my go-to.  Nothing more comfortable than simple, trim, classic cotton.  However, I must say that I think the quality of the cotton knit has declined a bit lately.  The fabric used to be a bit more substantial.  Hope to see that again soon."
4.0,"I ordered based on the sizing chart, and they fit me a tad small and thats that I ordered them a size bigger. But other than that they are good quality for the price. Very comfortable and soft."
4.0,very happy it arrived on time and was exactly what I was looking for ...my son loved them perfect gift for him
4.0,Dress fit a little big. I orderrd a US- S. Seems to be made for women with big hips.  Had to take it in at least 2 inches on each side by the hips. After alterations dress fit perfectly. I was a little shorter than  I expected but that was not a problem for me.  All in all the dress was beautiful.  Good quality material.
4.0,"It's more grey than silver.  I was expecting a bit of sparkle, which this doesn't have, but otherwise it's nice."
4.0,"I liked this so much I got the sleeves taken out. It was just too short in the sleeve for me. But I loved the look, colors, fit and pattern. A lot of these on the site are HUGE! This one is not. It's more fitted for a professional look. My arms are about 22.5 inches long."
4.0,"pretty dress, my husband loved it. Fits perfect."
4.0,I like them. Maybe a tad too small for my face but fine!
4.0,"I really loved the style of these and I was excited for these to arrive. Unfortunately, when they arrived, I discovered that the frames were WAY too big for my small face (something that i was afraid of with these)."
4.0,"Soft material. Super cute dress, worth the money"
4.0,when ordering order a size down i normally wear medium and it was to big
4.0,Feel like cotton blend didn’t dry as fast as I expected it to dry. I guess I was hoping for a more performance fabric
4.0,"Product was as described, fit correctly and arrived ahead of estimated date."
4.0,Fit perfect but sent back because I was wanting a dress with all black beading and sequins. This hs silver ones. It is a beautiful dress.
4.0,Like it my son look 👀 good with those
4.0,"I have been wearing a pair of this model in size 11 4E for the past 15 months and love everything about them. However, when I tried to find another pair in 11 4E, I could not, so I tried this one. I'm looking for a similar Nike shoe in wide to replace it before I decide to return them. In the meantime, they remain unused in the box."
4.0,These do a great job of blocking the sun and they're cute while they do it!
4.0,"I do like it, But wish it was slightly larger.  The average bracelet size for the adult woman is 7 1/2 inches. This is a slightly under 7-inch bracelet fitting only a smaller petite wrist."
4.0,love this top but when i got it it was a bit too small.
4.0,COULD BE LARGER BUT IT IS VERY NICE AND GET LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS  ARRIVED ON TIME<br />NICE PACKAGE AND GREAT PRICE
4.0,"I love my jacket! I get so many compliments on it! The only problem I have is that, it doesn't zip, bc my hips are too wide. I am 5'9"" 170lbs and I have pretty wide hips. I'm about a size 8-9 in pants. I ordered a Large going off of the reviews and size chart. But the jacket won't close, should've gotten an XL. So, instead I just bundle up I underneath the jacket if it's really cold and that way I can wear it open. It's a pretty warm jacket so, I don't need to bundle much."
4.0,I was a little disappointed in the color. It’s not as “wine” colored as I expected. The pant is nice & stretchy. Overall a good fit & it has good pockets which is why I wanted these. The back seemed plain. I thought at least one seam or design would go all the way around from front to back.
4.0,"I was nervous about sizing for these gloves.  I've been wearing a pair of Specialized Body Geometry gloves size large for a few seasons, but a recent crash demolished them for good.  These in a size large fit okay through the palm, but the fingers seemed a little too long.  After one ride I ran them through the wash and let them air dry, and they shrunk a tiny bit, just enough that I'm convinced a medium would be too small and I'm quite happy with them now.<br /><br />Do they feel lighter than air, like you're not wearing anything at all?  No.  If I get up to really high speeds on a downhill I can feel a bit of a breeze across the back of my hand, but other than that they feel like normal closed back gloves.  However, not any worse either.  I do like the padding in the palm--I was wearing a backup pair of old Specialized gloves with less padding while waiting for these, and had noticed my hands vibrating unpleasantly after every ride.  That vibrating is gone with the Airius.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is the small flannel which basically only covers my thumb.  My Specialized included flannel over about a quarter of the back of my hand, so I'm used to wiping my mouth with that area.  If I do that with these I get scratchy and abrasive mesh, so I'll have to retrain myself.<br /><br />I do like the retro look, and hopefully these will hold up for awhile.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/12/18:  Here we are, more than 2 years later and I'm still wearing these.  No signs of wear, no complaints.  Very, very well made."
4.0,"Me ajusta un poco en la frente, pero en cuanto a la visión que brinda es excelente."
4.0,Works well.nice soft leather!
4.0,"Great quality for the money I spent! It works well with many of my work outfits and looks professional, elegant, and classy. I highly recommend this product if you're looking for a cheap necklace to add to your work rotation!"
4.0,"My GF really likes the scarf, keeps her stylish and warm"
4.0,My only complaint is that it came in stiffer than I was expecting.
4.0,interesting way to put in on (no hole)
4.0,"I got this Jeff & Aimy Pom Beanie for Women Crochet Knit Skull Cap for my mother, who, as she has gotten older hates the cold more and more. This hat fit and although it looks a bit weird, seems warm enough and that is what my mother is looking for."
4.0,"I wore it for my office Christmas party. It is very elegant. Material is really soft. But for me, the material stretches a lot. That’s why 4 stars. And it was hard for me to keep the knot in place. I had to redo it often."
4.0,Beefy for the price.  Really cute.
4.0,I would've given this five stars had it not taken so long to get to me. They kept changing the delivery day and I finally got it over the weekend first week of January. The necklace is beautiful and the pendant is absolutely gorgeous. I love it!
4.0,Very nice color.  Dainty.
4.0,"Took a chance on this because it had no reviews. It’s super cute and sturdy! I wish it was a little bigger, but I love it anyway and will get a lot of use out of it!"
4.0,"Great holiday outfit for our 3yo, she looks adorable. The collar is itchy so she needs to wear a shirt under it."
4.0,I am not sure if I did not read the description clearly but I thought this was something totally different.  It did the trick for the cosutme aspect but was a little small in sizing.
4.0,"Very cute on, somewhat small and am concerned about it shrinking."
4.0,"Really like this tankini top!!! It is VERY flattering & hid exactly what I wanted hidden. The colors are beautiful!<br /><br />Very SAD that it was a size too small... Thinking that it may not have said the sizes offered when I ordered it (but that would have been strange). I contacted the company as I tried to order another one in the correct size, and saw that indeed it did NOT say what sizes were offered, didn't say what size(s) they had in stock either. Received an email back from the company stating they did not have the size I need.<br /><br />Pretty frustrated, they should just say what sizes they have in stock. Now I have to send it back :-("
4.0,"The medium and smaller cubes are great for small stuff (socks/small clothing/accessories/miscellaneous hygiene products) so that it I don't have to go digging through my bag to find one item, everything is together. The bigger cube would be more useful to me if I were to share a large luggage bag with my husband so we could easily tell whose clothing belongs to whom. If I'm the only one traveling, the large cube isn't as necessary because my clothing will fit just as well into my carry on bag without it."
4.0,"Compré esta banda para mi hija y ha funcionado bastante bien. Es linda y le sirve mucho para practicar sus estiramientos. El único problema que tiene es que con el tiempo las costuras que separan los espacios de la banda se van soltando, haciendo que poco a poco la banda sea solo un círculo sin separaciones. Pero en general es muy buena."
4.0,Very cute! A little cheap but they are still super cute! Hearts are pretty big for my nipples but whatever!
4.0,Did not fit my body type and straps too thin for me. The quality was good
4.0,"Maybe I ordered them too large, but they are not compression.  Still, they are nice, light tanks for summers at the gym. Comfy, too."
4.0,These hurt between the toes after 4-5 hours.  I need to take them off.
4.0,"I buy for weddding,because it is long dress/red color/.i am very like,but only a little decolorization"
4.0,Cute necklace! My 9 year old loved her birthday gift!
4.0,I am 5”5 188 pounds with thick thighs and a big butt I ordered a large and they fit great only downside to these pants is that they are completely see through even wearing white no show thong my boyfriend could still see through.
4.0,"They're key rings.  They hold keys.  Seems well made and durable, and I like that they're black.  My car key is pretty thick and it bent the ring a bit so that it doesn't close as much as with a regular key, but I think that would happen with any ring."
4.0,"Nice, for a while, the material balls up after numerous washing"
4.0,Very nice but ordered the wrong size. Still a keeper for when I loose some more weight.
4.0,Beautiful and quality watch but I was disappointed when it came in with the faceplate looking more purple than the blue in the picture
4.0,"I like the watch, but it has several drawbacks.  The band is very cheaply made.  You have to line it up carefully or it won't close.  The stopwatch part is so small, you have to have a magnafying lense to use it.  If you're buying a watch for the stopwatch, buy another one.  If you want a good looking watch buy this one.  It's waterproof, but only slightly.  Don't go scuba diving with it.  But it is a very good looking watch and it's inexpensive.  BTW, It keeps good time."
4.0,"These were gifts to each of my daughters.  They loved them.  I am planning a cruise and will be ordering two more.  One will be for my friend going on the cruise with us and one for myself.  My daughter used hers when she went on her honeymoon and said it was perfect for keeping up with her phone, picture ID and credit card."
4.0,"Quite a bit bigger than expected, but still good quality and looked great for a wedding I went to"
4.0,"Cute, thin sweatshirt.  It's not quite tshirt thin, but it's not plus or suited for blustery days.  The fabric is soft and smooth and the graphic is clear.  While it fits, it's not as oversized as the image appears."
4.0,I received the island paradise color. I did not find it to be see through.  It is very cute and comfortable.  I liked that you can wear it with an open back or tied.<br />I did notice it does get wrinkled if you don't pull it straight from the dryer.
4.0,Consider a size larger
4.0,"It’s pretty comfy and flattering! I’m a 32C and got a size 6. If I had less lats and a smaller rib cage I’m sure I’d be fine with a size 4. I would say this color is somewhat darker in person though. Beware that there are some brands out there who are taking this product and marking up the price, so you might as well buy it here or on AliExpress."
4.0,"They stretch out a bit with wear, but are very comfy."
4.0,Lovely outfit but larger than other clothes that size.  She will take a while to grow into it.
4.0,this is definitely by far the best price for this style of scarf that I have found anywhere. I only wish that they had a few other colors to choose from but overall these are light and so cute and I have gotten a lot of compliments on it!
4.0,"Needed some bags to use as dunk bags to clean some playground equipment. They are well made and look like they will last (time will tell), just a little pricey for what you get."
4.0,"well made and tailored. quality fabric, stitching, and snaps. very lightweight fabric."
4.0,"I've never worn ear jewelry like this before. Nice, but a little awkward to get used to a cuff on my ear.  That's just me though."
4.0,Dislike: that I had to order 2 sizes bigger than what I normally wear.<br />Like: that its material and colors are very nice. yes I will order again. I'm recommending to friend.<br /><br />received card in package for free bathing suit?? if I email beautifulswimsuit@gmail.com??<br />how does that work no place to put in size and color for free suit?<br />Please explain
4.0,Will buy again. The material is stretchy and the gray is a lot lighter than in the pic but still nice
4.0,It is comfortable and fits as expected.
4.0,Doesn't fit people with wide feet buy the product is good quality
4.0,"Comfortable.  A little lighter in color than expected, but still nice mid-color blue.  Fit as expected.  The tears are  a LITTLE on the big side, but not too open."
4.0,"Bold, awesome briefs that put your best feature forward."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:eb720f19e6d906837d3c5ae383b2d198]] Overall this was really cute. I could’ve went a size up though. But I love the color and the material.
4.0,I love this hat!!!!!! Just what I was expecting:)))
4.0,Shirt was perfect size. On time delivery
4.0,Every bit as soft as expensice lularoe. And they haven't torn like my lularoe's. Only draw back is the waist is not like lularoe's.
4.0,"I use it for my PT workout & its very comfortable, feel cool specially when ur already sweating, lastly looks good."
4.0,Better for those with longer torsos.
4.0,"Very cute, soft material. Looks as shown.<br />I ordered small and it's a good fit. Sleeves are long, fit very well.<br /> Only thing...being a round neck style it feels like the back neck is in the front. There's no way to fix it.<br />I've worn it once. I was pulling the collar down in the front. Bothered me.<br />I'd send it back for a swap but in sick, don't wanna deal with it."
4.0,"I’ve spent up to $250 on custom orthotics and these are just as good. Not sure if the longevity, but for the price I can buy damn near 25 pair."
4.0,Decent cheap sunglasses. Not the sturdiest but not too shabby.
4.0,"Smaller than pictured, so I will be returning but they seem like quality earrings for the price!"
4.0,comfortable and stylish. I received a lot of compliments!
4.0,Wish it was a little bit chunkier as it appears in the picture. But overall very cute and goes with a lot of stuff.
4.0,I loved these. It was almost perfect. The waistband of these pants is a little weird and not as stretchy as the rest of the sweats.
4.0,I didn’t expect it to be a baggy one. I thought it was normal. Still great quality and pretty
4.0,I'm completely satisfied with my order. They were delivered in a timely manner. I would highly recommend these shoes and Amazon.
4.0,"Should have been more thorough in reading the reviews on this dress.  I'm a size 16 and this dress in a 3x was wayyyyy big.  It's still very comfortable,  great t-shirt fabric.  Great length for me because I'm tall 5'9, one of the only dresses that wasn't ridiculously short.  Color was vibrant red also."
4.0,"I like it, the charm is ok, the strip its to cheap and rigid,"
4.0,"These earrings are super lightweight and fluttery.  Less substantial than the pictured earrings appear.  About what you would expect, inexpensive."
4.0,I really enjoy my Acura Hat.  It is made with good quality!
4.0,"Slight rubbing on the toes, but they will break in"
4.0,Fit pretty well. Just a smidge bigger then a size 2 should be. Beautiful dress though.
4.0,"great girl gift materials, also I can add new stuff. thank you"
4.0,"I ordered the tan colored wallet/wristlet and it looks exactly like the picture. I really like the design, it's modern and matches with everything. The inside though is kind of cheap. It has 4 credit card slots on each side and little pockets that fit all the other cards that I have. Over all, I think it's a good purchase, i really like it. I wish it was a tad bit bigger considering the price."
4.0,This dress is super comfy!!
4.0,The size and color.
4.0,Beautiful color but the material is like spandex and a bit larger than expected. The neck line is large too.
4.0,I love the shape of this dress! The fabric flows nicely too. I did not realize that this dress had a zipper up the back but it works well. The deep color was exactly what I was hoping for :)
4.0,The belt doesn't fit so I had to use a different belt but the dress fits great.
4.0,They look flimsy and ineffective but I sprayed an aerosol into it and NOTHING came through.<br />They are comfortable. Your breathing is not hindered and they don't fog up your glasses.
4.0,"I got these for my husband after he got some bamboo socks off the tool truck and he loved them. They have done way better than the brand the tool truck was selling, after a couple weeks those ones had holes in the toes. But these have held together for months now. Great socks ! They also help with foot odor which is a huge plus"
4.0,These rings a beautiful. Hope my son's enjoy them.
4.0,"Nice shirt, fits well, wore it on the golf course. Then I put it the wash so I thought I better read the laundry instructions. What a surprise! They must be way behind us here in America as the instructions said to line dry it!. Clothesline’s disappeared at least a half a century ago. Had to improvise. Oh well!"
4.0,"A nice top, I’m 5’ 1”, 135 lbs, 36B, and wear petite clothing: I purchased a size Small and it fits just fine: for some reason I thought it might be long enough to wear with leggings, I guess you can but it isn’t a tunic top length: the color (the pink-version) is true, and very nice, I have been wearing it with my thinner jeans instead of leggings. The fabric is NOT heavy, it reminds me of a T-shirt however in areas where you might want a thinner fabric, but long sleeved top, you should be able to wear it longer than expected-I know I am."
4.0,Good stylish watch very affordable and holds up nice did have to take a couple links out though but it comes with the supplies to do so
4.0,"I ordered this necklace and had a photo of my parents put in the stone as a gift for my sisters. They all love the necklace. The necklace is beautiful and well made. The chain is a little short for my liking, so I will probably replace it with a longer one, but I absolutely love the necklace."
4.0,"These are really pretty earrings! They are very lightweight, and you do have to be careful on how you store them so they don’t get bent. However, if you’re not a rough person on your earrings you should be fine. They have great packaging if you’re thinking of gifting them. Overall they’re very nice!"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:8d19ee8a46ed0a53e5128b2b3207daef]]Now i do really like the dress and love the print on it. I went by the size chart and ordered a large because of my measurements. I am 5'3&quot; and my measurements are 34, 34, 40.  With that being said i ordered a large not thinking about that the waist  and hips doesn't really matter when it comes to this dress. This is a flare loose fitting dress from waist down. Also another thing for me is since i am only 5'3&quot; this dress is super long on me and you can not see my feet in this dress. Even if i was to wear my heels you can not see my feet and i would step on my own dress. However it is a very pretty going out dress or an evening dress with a super cute print to it. Another thing for me that i did not like and will cut out is the boobie pads that are sewn in the halter part of the dress. I should of taken in the fact that this dress is loose fitting from waist down and i should of ordered  a small. Overall really cute print and the fabric feels great against my skin and you can not see through the dress . Also when wearing this dress i did not wear a bra and you could not see through the material .  I did receive this dress complimentary for my honest thoughts and unbiased review."
4.0,They are pretty good not amazing
4.0,Nice flowy dress! Worth it! Wish they had other colors!
4.0,"They arrived on time, and were just like they were described."
4.0,"Well, they are for fashion only."
4.0,"A little too tight, not suitable as a goalie cut jersey even at 3X is big, it's not cut for our equipment."
4.0,I had to sand these down a bit to fit my wife's ears. Where as other ones listed at the same size fit no problem. Not a big deal and they look nice.
4.0,These came looking like old Hollywood glamour. So pretty but they are too heavy for my comfort. Just trying them on I could tell I wouldn't be able to wear them very long. Im returning mine for that reason alone.
4.0,"Put it in my pocket, it won't feel like a hard object, it's very good."
4.0,They aren’t purple and white. Still super cute.
4.0,"These run small, I can usually wear an 8.5 or 9 but I have a high instep so I ordered a 9 and I could barley get them on my feet. I returned them and was going to get a larger size but they were out of stock."
4.0,Love the fabric just doesn't fit me the way I thought it would
4.0,"but great quality, nonetheless."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:a5208bb849e3f04705033a065d87d751]] I’m 5’5”, 136lbs, and 36B and I ordered a size small. It fits perfectly and I’m extremely satisfied. The only negative thing is the bottoms are very see-through so beware of what kind of underwear you wear."
4.0,"Good bands. I got the Royal blue and the color is exactly as pictures. It's a little stiff though. I don't like to sleep with it on, but it's fine for everything else."
4.0,"I really like these bras. They are stretchy and I love the design. The only thing I didn’t like is the padding. The padding is a strip, not a pad for each side. When I put it on, the padding barely covered both sides. It does have openings on the sides so I will most likely replace the padding with separate pads for each boob. Overall I like them!"
4.0,Pretty little pop of color for a great price! Comfortable enough to wear all day without feeling too heavy.
4.0,I really like the look of this suit & so does my husband. I like the fact that I can tie the straps in the front to make it strapless.
4.0,My little monster loved it
4.0,Bought usual size and fits well. Hangs straight and covers more curvy areas well. Light weight and soft feeling.
4.0,"Cute, but one of the front flowers was sitting in the bag upon arrival."
4.0,Doesn’t look or fit like an oversized tshirt it fit like a normal shirt.
4.0,"I love this dress - great color, great style, the pockets!  I normally wear a size L in dresses, so I got the same size for this one.  I'm 6'1 and the dress hits me at the knee, so it is a good length for work.  It fits perfectly in the chest area but is a little big in the waist - I might have been able to get away with a Medium.  Love the dress, it's just not a perfect fit."
4.0,"Best features: It's versatile & practical. Not too floppy, it has some structure with adequate coverage. I like that it's adjustable under the brim and that it has a chin strap.What I don't like is that I ordered 89323_beige and the picture shows a pink band but the one I got has a light blue band. No idea why, because that wasn't even an order option. But, I will probably keep it because I don't know how fix that & I think it will still work with my outfits for my trip. I see a lot of people asked how to attach the chin strap so I'm attaching a picture."
4.0,"Love these earings. I have very sensitive ear lobes and I have a hard time finding earings that don't irritate my ears.  I love the look, the size, the colors and the fact that I can wear them all day with out any irritation."
4.0,"these shouls have been huge on me but they were just comfy so sizing is off, vut they are nice pjs"
4.0,Darling little dress! Fabric drapes nicely and the flutter sleeves help disguise less-than-perfect upper arms. Very surprised to be so pleased with it!
4.0,Good to wear underneath clothing
4.0,This was cute well made but missing a small on the crotch. But good quality and looks super adorable
4.0,It fit and was delivered right on time
4.0,Bought it for Halloween but I still use it from time to time. Great material and great color. Can't go wrong
4.0,"This ruffle mini dress is a great summer find. It has a fun, loose, swinging shape and fits as expected. The material is opaque and just slightly stiffer than slinky, soft material. The length falls a couple of inches above the knee, but it feels modest and feminine."
4.0,And fashion. It is a little too loose for me. My face is at least average.
4.0,"I loved it but there's one problem with it...it's the size of a coin purse. It's small...like more of a  purse for a little girl. Seriously, my  chihuahua could use this thing."
4.0,"The cups are roomy, the band is kind of tight. The straps are crazy-long! I think once I sew the straps shorter, these will be great. Fabric is decent, comfortable. The cups get kind of wrinkly, even when washed in a bra bag, so I'd handwash those separately."
4.0,"I found it useful for my purposes, which is occasional recreational travel.  It looks nice, secures your passport and allows enough room for a handful of credit cards and some cash."
4.0,"Dress is pretty. Lining is pretty cheap material/see through. If you are at all concerned about fit - there is no stretch in the dress at all. If you want to know for sure if this dress will fit you, take your measurements."
4.0,"I like it. I would like it bettr if it didn't say country music, as I play many types."
4.0,"I initially bought this dress in black and I loved it! It isn't the best quality but for the price it is great! I love the style, the length and the comfort. I came back and also bought the dress in army green and although the fit is the same, the fabric is a little different. It is slightly shiny and a bit more see through in the light. I still wear it and it is fine, but I don't love it quite as much as I did my first one. Bottom line, I will still come back and buy more when these ones are worn out because they are cheap and cute!"
4.0,May not run small for yall but it did a little for me.<br />! Still fits and its super cute
4.0,I'm giving them 4 stars because the color doesnt match. The dark purple in the photo would have been perfect but I got a lighter (barney the dinosaur) purple instead. Other than that the sewn in glitter and see thru cape is beautiful and perfect
4.0,The metal locks that connect to the watch do not secure correctly. I switched them out with the original band locks and it now works perfect.
4.0,"I ordered this in mauve/medium 6-10.  It's a beautiful bodysuit - the stretch velvet is very soft, comfy and warm to wear, but also very sexy.  The problem is that the bodysuit doesn't fit me very well.  I am 5'4&#34;, busty, and usually wear a U.S. size medium (size 8-9.)  But this medium is a bit too big on me.  It seems to be fitted for figures with longer torsos.  Maybe the small size would fit me better."
4.0,"My daughter loves this purse.  She uses it as a sofa when she plays with her LOL dolls.  It's not very big or practical as a purse.  While there is a mirror inside, you'd almost have to break the purse to actually see yourself as it's under the seat of the couch, forcing you to bend the back to open which is pretty much  thick cardboard covered in material.  The chain is really long and not adjustable, so that may be a negative for some.  Overall, it's cute."
4.0,Installation was relatively easy and the product works as advertised.  The only issue is that within a few days one the clips on the ends of the laces came off and was lost.
4.0,Was very satisfied with this product
4.0,The ones I really wanted came broke other then that you get what you pay for
4.0,I ordered the small and should have ordered the medium. The top is snug. I prefer loose. I am 5’3” 135 lbs. I do like it and will probably order a medium.
4.0,The backs keep sliding off is the only complaint I have. We put them on a messenger bag and they kept falling off until we put them through an area with an unused pocket so the backs wouldn't get bumped. If you have rubber backs I'd use those to make sure they dont fall off but the badges look fantastic and I get comments on them a lot.
4.0,My mom purchased this dress fir a church function and was somewhat disappointed. This is more like a t-shirt dress and that is not what she wanted. She has decided to keep the dress since she may be able to wear it in the summer. I am not sure if the dress has pockets or not.
4.0,Great variety pack for Halloween fun!
4.0,Got this for my husband. He likes it so far.
4.0,they kinda heavy buh other den dat they good
4.0,Looks and fit good.
4.0,The top fits large I usually wear M-L shirt I got the small and fits loosely-Colors aren’t as vibrant as the picture
4.0,A bit unconfortable in the decorations
4.0,"Very nice ring , fits as he should but miss leading from the picture that they show you , it doesn't come in red white and blue like it shows you  in the picture,  it comes just plain gray and it does not look as nice as the red white and blue , The reason I ordered this rain was because it looked very nice in red white and blue with the stars so I did not get the product that they were advertising but yet it's still a very nice ring  but not what I wanted, that's the only reason I give it four stars is very misleading, thank you"
4.0,It was a little smaller than I expected. Other than that I hope my husband likes it. He had one similar but lost it. I have not been able to find one like he had.
4.0,Bought for my son after he saw one while on vacation.  He loves it.
4.0,"Awesome style,<br />Very little lining,<br />I’m 5’7” the pant leg is perfect, the suspenders are a bit long.<br />A bit on the small side of XL<br />The sides unzip and expand to give more room.<br />I’m looking forward to wearing them to work."
4.0,"Great pins! They were all metal but the donut, that was plastic.  Which is why I have 4 stars."
4.0,I'm s bit shorter than the length of the pant. Costs about $10 to have a seamstress make it right
4.0,"I ordered my size according to the measurements but it ended up a tad small. I'm 5'4 so not tall at all and the first thing my husband said was sweet cameltoe! LOL THANKS. Anyway whatever size you think you need go up one. Personally, I'd rather it be too big than slightly small. Also, I'm certainly not rail thin but not overly large either so hope that helps!"
4.0,To big it was sent back
4.0,Is amazing 😉
4.0,They love it thank you
4.0,Cute for the price. Waist is higher than I would prefer.
4.0,"Very cute necklace especially for the super low price.  I have to give it 4 stars because it's SO bling-y that it doesn't fit with a lot of things.  If they had toned down the sparkle factor a tad, it would have much more versatility.  For this type of inexpensive jewelry made of plastic and cheap metal it looks pretty fantastic though."
4.0,"This is a pretty good hoodie for the price.  It is not real heavy, so it won't do the job in super cold temps.  But probably perfect weight for more moderate temperatures.  It is not quite as long as I would prefer.  If it shrinks after laundering, it would be useless, so I will probably hang it to dry.  The color I ordered (dark aquamarine) is absolutely beautiful!"
4.0,Quality of the materials is good.  A little different than you might expect in that the sleeves open from the back of the insert.  Takes a little getting used to but it means that the cards or photos are more securely held.
4.0,The white pants are really kind of light grey heather color but they are very soft and pretty much what I was looking for.
4.0,"Love this dress! The color is bright and really stands out, got lots of compliments. I gave it only 4 stars because the quality is not great."
4.0,Very cute and nice quality but a bit smaller than expected. It fits all that I need and is really cute.
4.0,Took on vacation bc of how it folds into practically nothing...comfy and love the design!
4.0,"Very thin material, sheer doesn’t look like it will hold up very many washes"
4.0,Very comfortable and good tight fit
4.0,Loved this .. but it was listed as a wallet wristlet.  Not realizing it had no wristlet strap I had to return it. :(
4.0,Accidentally ordered too big but the material was nice. Had I gotten the right size I’m sure it would’ve been nice to wear.
4.0,"It's a great hat, I misplaced the last one, and this is a replacement, I also bought an extra- good price as well"
4.0,"This yoga pants and bra set were too small for me.  My daughter tried these on, and they ended up being a tad loose on her, and a little long.  The bra was too small for me as well.  The pants were a little see through as well when bending or stretching.  This set will most likely be given away.  I wish it did fit, cuz the sewing quality and the material seems to be good.  I did receive a discount in exchange for my review."
4.0,Grand daughter loved this watch and it was simple for me to setup.
4.0,A little snug but ok.
4.0,"Quite nice but not perfect, better than anything else available."
4.0,"This is a very lovely blazer.  The pure white color is so stinking and versatile, you can dress it up with a formal pair of slacks (or skirt) or down with jeans.  The fabric, stitching and construction are all very high quality.  It has a nice, smooth lining and button closure, if you wish to close it.  I ordered a small and it is quite loose on me, but I will make it work.  This blazer is a great staple to have in your wardrobe, I know I will get a lot of use out of it."
4.0,"I love this bag and have bought it twice. Both times the strap has broken when i was out and about. I would get it again but i will bring it to someone to strengthen the straps connection points before using it. This bag is a great size and holds a lot (which is probably why i have broken the strap twice). The actual bag part is strong, no rips or messed up liner. Love it"
4.0,The materials are not top-notch but the shoes and accessories serve their purpose for play time.
4.0,"I think I had to cut off the extra rubber for my application, but still works well, good quality boots and terminals!"
4.0,"The shoes are wonderfully made and of good quality. It is a little tight for what I was expecting, but still wearable without too much annoyance. Would love to order other colors if they were ever available (I have bought both black and brown so far)."
4.0,Excellent design and fit.  Very comfortable to wear.
4.0,Was shorter than expected. But that's fine
4.0,"They're very sparkly,but too small for my ears. They'd make great 2nd hole earrings."
4.0,"I ordered the safety ear muffs to try with my son that in on the autism spectrum. He gets so frustrated with noise that he can't think straight at times. Although he can use his regular headphones and music to tune things out, we would like him to also start trying to tolerate a little bit of life around him. These worked wonders for that. They muffle the noise but do not completely block it out. He can sit in the living room with us while reading a book, but still be able to pay attention and hear the conversations we are having. Sometimes now, he will even take them off and join into a talk about something that interests him. Before, he would have the music so loud to tune everyone out, that he rarely talked to any of us. I tried these myself as well. They make it sound like you have your hands tightly covered over your ears, but I can clearly still hear the kids and what is happening around me. If you are seeking complete silence, that is not what you will get from these, but for our needs they are perfect.<br /><br />I received the safety ear muffs free for evaluation and honest feedback. My review is based solely on my experiences using the headphones to muffle normal, everyday sounds."
4.0,Very cute bathing suit but material not appropriate for the water.
4.0,Nice watch band hard to replace on watch
4.0,"I'm 5'2"" and this came to my knees. I liked the pockets and sleeves, though I wish the fabric was a little bit thicker. For the price it's a good, simple dress!"
4.0,A liitle too narrow and the side placed on the skiln is coated with some thin plastic which doesn't absorb as much sweat.
4.0,"This dress is so pretty, it could easily be priced higher and still be well worth it. They paired seamlessly with the &#34;DREAM PAIRS SAPHA Women's Summer Trendy Print Gladiator Back Zipper Flat Sandals &#34;"
4.0,"Cute sports bra. Love the charcoal grey color. They didn’t offer an XS so I bought an S. I’m usually either or depending on the brand. But since this was smallest they offered I figured it would be fine. It’s a little loose when i like a tighter fit. It’s mostly the straps. Would’ve liked a little more support there or adjustable straps. Because it does cover my chest.<br />I cut lable right off. Made the huge mistake of putting in washer (in a lingerie bag) and dryer (on low) which always is fine with any other sports bra u have owned. I was actually hoping that maybe it would tighten up a little bit. Well, there is now a hole on the inside where the lining is sewn at a seam. So I got one wear out of it before this happened. I’ll still wear it for now but not sure how long it will last. Guess I should’ve got on the listing and read how to care there."
4.0,"SUPER NICE DRESS!<br />I don't often write review but I have to say: it's a super cute dress<br />I read the reviews before and ordered a M. I normally run by a L but the M is definitely ok and still lose (which I live because I have kind of a big butt).<br />Don't hesitate to buy it! ^_^<br /><br />Oh and I have a skirt of mine underneath, the little black thing is not included."
4.0,"These are ok for the price , fit is good"
4.0,It does help with the glare in night driving.
4.0,Like this watch. About have all colors I need. Thanks
4.0,Not bad ! A little stiff but still super cute<br />I will be ordering more !
4.0,"All in all, this is a nice vest. It's longer in the back, & if we ever get some rain or snow where I'm at the hide away hood in the collar will come in handy. It does fit a tad smaller than I am used to for an X-Large. I'm thinking that with wearing it, it will loosen up some, so I'm keeping it."
4.0,"I wanted something small and easy to carry. This met my expectations. However, the first big gust of wind just about ruined it. So then , if you need something just to keep  a gentle rain from soaking you, this will be fine. If you want protection from a rainstorm, buy something else."
4.0,"i wear a lot of pantyhose. no nonsense pantyhose are the pantyhose i wear the most. i do have leggs pantyhose and other pantyhose and nylon pantyhose. leggs pantyhose, silkies pantyhose, silky silky pantyhose and nylon pantyhose. im wearing my leggs pantyhose sheer control top pantyhose right now and they are very sheer silky pantyhose. these pantyhose feel wonderful on my pantyhose legs. i like reinforced toe pantyhose more than my silky sheer toe pantyhose. i wear high heels that show my pretty pantyhose feet and dont mind pantyhose that are reinforced toe pantyhose. my reinforced toe pantyhose look like sheer toe pantyhose. im going to wear my leggs pantyhose more, very silky sheer pantyhose."
4.0,Comfort not hurt by price. Would buy again.
4.0,"Great dupe. Once it came it was kinda scratched up as if it was already used but wasn't that noticeable. After a few weeks of keeping it it began to rust and turn into a dark red-ish type of color, not the pendent just the beads part of the necklace that goes around your neck. Delivery was very fast though"
4.0,I like the design of this wallet and the stitching so far seems durable and quality. However I had the wallet in my pants with a set of keys and I guess the keys clashed with the wallet a bit and damaged it the leather (or whatever material that it’s made of). As u can see in the picture with this review it didn’t seem to take much to lay a good bit of damage to it. For the price this product is alright but I don’t believe the durability will hold up for more than 3 years at best based on my experience with it this far. I could be wrong I don’t know we’ll see but at least it’s stylish and cheap so if I like the wallet and u can get it at about $15-25 you’ll prolly get your money’s worth at that price as long as ur not very rough with it. If u work or ur life involves a lot of rough and abrasive materials this wallet might not hold up the way you’d like and u might want to look elsewhere.<br />Now other than that it’s great it’s pretty and stylish and I like the design and it’s got some nice inlayed interwork and design that is fun and neat but u can see it unless u remove ur license. Overall not too bad just a bit of the fragile side
4.0,"Really cute! Not made for people with large breasts. I would saw my boobs are pretty average size, 34C, and the buttons pop out a little bit. I'll just wear an undershirt. But super adorable and great for breastfeeding!"
4.0,"There are some plastic pieces on the inside over your eyes that seem to come off easily. I use these for pickleball and there are a variety of lenses. Nice case and having different lenses for different light condition.When it's hot and I'm steaming from my face, using it with no lenses works well too.  A great value and product for the $."
4.0,Nice finish. Stong magnet.  Does pull hair on your arm
4.0,"HOW TO<br /><br />Start by using an eyeglasses Phillips head screw driver to remove the 4 screws in the back of the DS4.<br />Careful to keep the triggers in place and away from the shell while prying controller open.<br />Next the clip INSIDE to connect the halves.<br /><br />After the battery removal comes the clip to the touchpad. (this one is slightly harder to remove and put back, it is nestled in a tight area)<br />Next is the silver screw behind the battery nest.<br />Gently pull the joystick platform up and out. The joy sticks will be pressfit onto a shaft with a flat on it. Match the flats and press firmly back on.<br />Replace the joystick cradle back into the controller and put back together.<br />Good chance to clean out the seals of the controller with a Clorox wipe or toothpick"
4.0,Pretty ring for the great price. But b rde its a thick ring.
4.0,I like it. I didn't pay attention to the size so I passed it on to my son who also loves it! I will recommend this to anyone who want to buy it.
4.0,"just the right size. however, i do have to agree that the card pockets are a little too deep. but still cute"
4.0,I am ordering a bigger size. Great quality & comfort. They run small. I am 5’2 & 140 lbs. I ordered a medium. It fits but really tight. Ordering a large next time.
4.0,"I like the colour, but it could have been a little longer. If fit great."
4.0,Cute chokers but not the best quality
4.0,The color pink is a very light pink almost a peachish pink. The easiest way I have found to attach the watch is to push the pin in first then put the loop in second. I do wish that they did give us the option to pick if we needed a small or a large. When we purchase the Fitbit Blaze originally we have to pick &#34;small&#34; or &#34;large&#34; for people like me that have small wrists we need a small band. When we order a large band the large band wraps almost completely around.  Not in a bad way but I know for me I &#34;pin&#34; this on the second in hole which gives me the entire rest of the band to push through the slit that needs to rest on the inside with me. I have received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.
4.0,"They are kind of big, they would be suited for men but I like that they are long and go up the sleeve. So I have worn them pretty regularly. But because they are bulky, they look like hobo gloves rather than sleek stylish ones for women. The material doesn't bother me but I do understand wool makes some itchy, I haven't experienced this. My only complaint is the size."
4.0,been washed twice and the shirts decal is cracking
4.0,"This fits well, and I bought a Large and the waist and bust isn’t anywhere near tight. However, the elastic for buttons isn’t taught, so it stretches thus making an accident possible. I sewed the lining shut the whole way down in the front, to avoid any oopsies, and works well."
4.0,"Wore once, washed, put on and there's a hole in the toe area already."
4.0,Good product so far also good insulation
4.0,It's cute but it's orange and not faux leather.  Well made though.
4.0,My husband is a 9 1/2 we got a 10 but it was still snugg.
4.0,"THE FIT IS GOOD, COMFORTABLE, BUT THEY ARE ALREADY GETTING KIND OF PILLIE."
4.0,The title is what Fratelli CS told me when I found that the gloves given to me by my kids did not fit.  My largest hand measures 8.5 inches so I had them order a size 9. The size 9 glove did not fit. I called CS and got the above quote.  CS paid for return shipping and shipped a size 10 to me within a week. A size 10 fits a 8.5 inch hand perfectly. Great CS. One star off for having to wait before I could test drive my new gloves.<br /><br />The gloves deserve all positive reviews.
4.0,"I really like this wallet, specially since there's a warranty on it. Unfortunately I'm on my second one because the little clip broke that keeps the wallet shut but other then that it works great."
4.0,"Cute belt, but the band is cheaply made."
4.0,It was a gift for my DJ brother and he loves it! Thought it was the coolest gift.
4.0,"It’s super pretty, I think you’ll need to take care of the chain though a bit thin"
4.0,"Great fit, however the white is see through."
4.0,Smaller than expected. Dress is cut well and the material is a decent quality but is is smaller than expected
4.0,"Everyone at the Halloween Party I attended absolutely loved this mask. The only real con I could think of is that maybe it would have been better to have the mouth open up slightly through the lines of where his fang like teeth meet. I had to take an exacto blade to the teeth at the party cause it was just too hot in the mask and I had to remove it everytime I wanted a sip of my beverage. After the precision cutting, I could at least use a straw and breathe a bit better. It's exactly what is expected from a latex mask though so you can't take that away from it. Just need a little creativity... All in all an awesome mask and will probably enjoy it again."
4.0,This dress is stunning. the only issue I have is that it should have an hook and eye clasp above the zipper.  I had to sew one in myself.  There's a bit much space between the corset and zipper.
4.0,"I mean it serves it’s purpose but I’d like to share with future costumers, yes it does say one size fits all but I am 5’2 170 pounds and I felt like it was very loose fitting in a length sense. The middle portions was just way to loose and felt like it was in the wrong spot because I wasn’t long enough. Keep this in mind if you are on the shorter side."
4.0,I love this skirt i love how it feels and stretchs so i will buy it again thank you
4.0,Ordered fir my granddaughter. She likes the look. It fits her pretty good. Item is on the thinner side but still pretty good and stretchable.
4.0,"NICE BUT TOO LARGE, I DID RETURN THEM."
4.0,"Price is good. I normally wear an XL in shirts that typically fit a little snug, and this was a perfect fit."
4.0,"The material is really comfortable, the design is awesome, but the pouch allows for things to get out of their designated place. I personally prefer the David Archy Separate Pouches"
4.0,Only problem I would’ve like to use it under my work out gear and I can’t to bulky for the gym clothes. Overall happy
4.0,Sturdy enough for a few light items
4.0,"These are so cute. I made a necklace for a friend that recently started working out. She loves it. Many of the beads are somewhat large. I would have preferred more of the smaller ones. I really don't know what someone would do with so many large ones, so I took a star off. The quality is fine. Nothing super fancy or anything, but there wasn't a lot to choose from, so I'm ok with that. Since my friend likes the necklace I call it a win!"
4.0,"There's already a hole in the inseam, but I mean, what are you gonna do?"
4.0,"The hat is nice, however the reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that mine came in a bag not a box. It may have been crushed I got lucky others may not. Sturdy straw good fit."
4.0,I like the price for the 2 cases. They come with drawstring bags and cloths to wipe lenses. I was pleased with one case while the other had lining already coming apart from the shell when I opened it the first time. Still usable but not 5 star quality
4.0,"I have two of these shirts.  I bought them to attend a professional conference in a hot, dry area of the US.  I really like the style of the shirts - they have a more professional style than the Ex Officio shirts that I use for hiking.  Unfortunately, the fabric of the Royal Robbins shirts is a bit on the heavy side.  So, they aren't great for walking any distance in hot weather."
4.0,My baby girl just turned 12months/oneyrs old and she's around a size 3 in shoes... wanted to know what size would fit best for her from the list ? The sizes on the list are a bit confusing to me
4.0,"They look great and have a really blue color too them, but when I first got them I didnt even think they really screwed apart until my stoner ingenuity took plyers to them. havent tried it yet but I bet storing stuff in my ears has never been easier!"
4.0,"The shirt is fine, and a good deal for the money. But I do wish that it had the Bible reference that it quotes (Psalm 139:14) printed at the bottom. Also, the shirt took over a month to be delivered, but delivery was cheap, and they tell you ahead of time that it will take that long.<br />The printing and the price make this a perfect tool for promoting the Christian pro-life morality. What a great, inexpensive gift to hand out at a baby shower."
4.0,These make great give away items. They often fall apart so I don’t recommend selling them.
4.0,"Just got my bag today.  Was hoping it would be a little roomier than the smaller one I've been using the past few years, but due to the configuration maybe not by much.  This is a pretty compact bag.  Lots of neat organization inside though for all kinds of things.  And the large compartment holds my Kindle Voyager...and can also hold my small Samsung tablet at the same time...though that would really pack the bag.  My Note 8 phone slips into one of the interior pockets as well as the outside slide-in pocket - not sure yet which one I'll use.  But it does fit a decent sized phone either way.  The Smoke color is not quite what was shown on the screen, but I do like it.  It's kind of a smokey gray with a slight purple hint.  We'll see how the features and bag hold up over time.  What not to like?  Well, the stitching detail is sloppy on the front of the bag, the back of the bag is very, very wrinkled (hopefully that will flatten out over time) and there are some ooky spots on the back of the bag.  And the metal logo on the front is very lopsided.  Pretty obvious.  Someone wasn't paying attention to detail.  Overall, though, I think I'll be happy with it."
4.0,I love the look and style of this lanyard. Unjust wish the magnet was stronger. I've been wearing it about a week and it has fallen off an average of once a day.
4.0,"Was well made, but much longer than I expected. Model must have been tall. I'm 5' 3&#34; it's more like a dress. And somewhat sheer. But still a keeper. Love the quality."
4.0,"The size has been amended to my size, it's  good product"
4.0,"Beautiful,  exactly as described.  Will buy again."
4.0,"I wear a size 8.5 shoe, so I got the 8-11 size socks, but I really probably should have just gotten the next size down because they're pretty big. I was going to just give them to my husband, who wears a size 11, but they squeeze his feet in a weird way that causes his toes to cramp up. So I just wear them around the house and will wear them in winter boots to keep my feet warm. They're comfortable. Feel like they'll last quite a while."
4.0,"I love cuff bracelets, this one is my favorite."
4.0,"The shirt is as pictured. Soft, stretchy material. Size down unless you like a more roomy fit. Ordered xl. Trying to decide if I’m going to exchange for a large or return for good. The neck of the shirt is a tad wide not sure if that would be different on a smaller size. The design is a little dressy for the casual material so I’m on the fence with it. Maybe I’m just being too particular..."
4.0,"Ordered these as a backup to keep in the extra car, and have found myself using them more and more. Solid build, heavy poly and stiff hinges, they feel like brand name glasses. The polarized lenses are legit and the shape looks pretty good. They are a little smaller than I expected, but I have a big head too. 58mm would be perfect. Would order them again!<br /><br />For under $10 it's hard to go wrong... As a bonus a very nice soft case and cleaning cloth are included too. You could give these as a gift and people would think you paid 4x as much."
4.0,"They are noisy when I am walking. Other than that, good purchase for the price."
4.0,The reason I gave this product a 4 star is because is a bit uncomfortable and when you put it on your self you can’t move well you feel stiff maybe after using it a couple of times it will feel better .
4.0,Nice. Good material and very comfortable
4.0,"I real like the headband. The elastic could be a little stronger/tighter, but still uses the purpose. Received one band that was miss stitched, but the company stand behind it."
4.0,I bought this for a gift to other fans
4.0,great wedge!
4.0,"The shoes are beautiful!  However, they are a little wide in the toe area and I have a wide-ish foot. I put a foot pad in and so far it is fine. They are very comfortable and at 5'0&#34; I love the extra height without an uncomfortable high heel."
4.0,Fits as expected. Well packaged. Good seller follow up. No problems
4.0,So I am a big girl in the stomach area. But they fit my breast just fine. 42DDD. The only part I have a problem with is the middle part staying put. The color is banging
4.0,"having recently lost a couple of items from my old keyring,,  this was a must replacement.  Design works nicely and is very secure,"
4.0,"This tank fit well and is super comfortable. I definitely would buy again and am already planning to do so.<br /><br />Please note that although I did in fact receive this item at a reduced price to what it is currently offered at, my opinions and views are of my own personal experience buying and trying this item and it did not sway my ideas on this product what so ever."
4.0,"I bought this for my 5 year old, product is just like the picture. The pom poms we’re all bunched up on one side so you have to move them around yourself. Also not much stretch!"
4.0,"looks good, fits well"
4.0,I got to wear with costume
4.0,"Very lovely and looks elegant. If it wasn't so high waisted, I would have kept it."
4.0,"I bought the headbands for my nephew who plays soccer and who can SWEAT! They are great for what I bought them for, he just mentioned that they are a bit bulky and too thick. I would still buy for the affordability."
4.0,"This was a good watch, but unfortunately I wasn't able to wear it as the strap was too small."
4.0,"Material was good. I read reviews which said it ran small. I'm 5'1 and 115 and ordered a large, it was still a little tight around the butt area and flattened my chest out. The padding it comes with is akward as hell lol. I removed that and replaced with another swim suits padding and it looks great! Definitely order at least 2 sizes up!"
4.0,This dress is very stylish amd comfortable.  I got a lot of compliments when I wore it to work.  I am giving it a 4 because the fabric is somewhat cheap feeling and I'm not sure how well it will hold up long term; it's the kind of fabric that usually gets little pills on it over time.
4.0,"The jewelry was purchased as a gift for my granddaughter and she loved it.  The earrings were beautiful, but were not the color of this picture.  they were more crystal in appearance with no pink color which I liked.  However, my grandaughter loved them and we are keeping them.  Fast service and arrived as promised.  Will buy again."
4.0,A little loose and big for a small. Shirt fit fine overall.
4.0,"these pants are really comfortable and stylish, the quality of the clothing seems to be really good and they are well made. I am giving it a 4 because it run a little small but I reordered one size above and they are just perfect."
4.0,"The material is thick, but more cotton feeling than I was expecting. I ordered a M, which is my size and it fits well on top (bigger busted), but the bottom balloons out more than I prefer. It’s still a cute and comfortable dress, just not as flattering as I was hoping. I have a more curvy figure, am 5’ 2” and the dress goes down to my ankles."
4.0,"The blouse is made well, I just wish the elastic seam in the breast area could’ve been  3 inches lower, it rides a bit high in the chest area, beautiful color"
4.0,It is large but I like it like that so everything is alright
4.0,It was great and really pretty. The only thing i do now like is how the buttons feel a little loose so I got nervous I was gonna lose a strap and it was loose on the top since I have a smaller chest. Other then that it was great and felt very flowy and nice. I am 4'9 and 90 pounds so it went down to about my knees.
4.0,Pretty scarf! I like it a lot and very warm.
4.0,"The chain is WAY to short for this size medallion and it was Very cheap looking. But a new, longer, chain made this look GREAT!"
4.0,cute hope the stone doesnt fall off
4.0,"No doubt that these are nice earrings. But they are not for everyone. Not at all.<br /><br />My wife tried them. Now, when we ordered, we knew it said 'large' but we didn't realize it meant LARGE, maybe HUGE. These are, in a word, gigantic. When my wife put them on our daughter asked if she was going to tell our fortune. A bit of a stereotype, perhaps, but it fits.<br /><br />They're nice enough in appearance, just way too big and way too loud for someone above a certain (young) age. If you're going for effect, fine. If you want to wear them as mood pieces, all well and good. But ordinary wear? Daily wear? Formal wear? Never.<br /><br />We give four stars because of relatively good quality. But my wife won't be using them."
4.0,"very beautiful seashell. Just like illustrated on the picture, but the cord is different from one on the image. On the picture the cord consists of several thin cords but the cord which arrived is one whole. I would like the one on the image."
4.0,Love these boots but was a bit intimidated by how these were going to fit as I have thick legs but once they came in fit like a glove and were not tight at all on my thighs! the actual size of the shoe was a little bit big next time I order I will deff try a half size down also a bit disappointed with the type of material the boot is made out of but overall satisfied with this product.
4.0,I lost my favorite wool and nylon sweater so bought this to replace it.  It is not as soft as my old one but is certainly warm.  I like the soft fabric on the collar because wool usually itches me and the collar prevents that.  Nice everyday sweater.
4.0,"This cap is warm and comfy,, certainly a good value for the money spent. It's well made and should last a good many winters."
4.0,Am impressed by the quality. This hand bag was just what I was looking for in style & ease of use.
4.0,"Be warned that the bar that goes through the helmet strap is a little thick, if you have a small female end on your helmet it might now work, mine wasn’t particularly small but I still had to sand it down to be usable. It’s a good small lock for your helmet if your handlebars or another part of your bike works for it though, be warned the lock itself is not the most durable in design so if looking for high security might need a different lock."
4.0,"I’ve bought other Patty tops and have always been happy. This lovely top is no exception.  I purchased a small and it fits as I’d hoped. Actually I was concerned the neckline would be too wide, but this was happily not the case. My only criticism, if anything, is it is a bit too long on my 4-11 frame (full bum coverage). But not so much it looks odd. The material is thick with some stretch and washed up well."
4.0,"But they wore out really really really fast, I used them for about 3 months and then the heel broke off."
4.0,Flimsy but pretty
4.0,Nice blouse. Doesn't breath super well so just don't wear it on a hot/humid day. Otherwise very cute
4.0,"This is a super cute set!  The fabric is a nice high-quality cotton/linen that feels very substantial.  The fit of the shirt is great!  It has that casual ""oversized"" fit that is so on-trend.  The sleeves are at mid arm so no need to roll them up.  My challenge is with the shorts....I ordered the size small and these shorts are VERY small.  You may want to size UP to get a more loose fit in the waist and hips.  The length of the shorts is great:  short and sassy but still with enough coverage."
4.0,Cute and nice tight fitting! Prepare for a more legging vibe.
4.0,"Love love these earrings!!!! Sooooo cuteeee!! They are a lot smaller than the picture., but they are a good size. Great price for them!!"
4.0,I was a little disappointed my stone fell out. I was able to fix.
4.0,Seems like a good quality bag but it is much smaller than it looks in the pictures.  I would not consider this a large tote bag
4.0,Feels simple and great
4.0,Not as squishy as I expected but still nice and comfy.
4.0,"I really liked the short wrap because it is a little shorter on one side and makes a nice knot.  The larger wrap is just piece of cloth with no form, could be a scarf, shawl, anything, but not shaped like a wrap."
4.0,"Not my favorite, but a great representation of my fandom &#60;3"
4.0,Love it. Light weight and can shop more comfortably. And it is pretty!!!
4.0,"This is a good choice one-piece for a long torso; it also camouflages tummy bulge pretty well. Don't order if you are in a hurry to get it. It took a couple of weeks. It has not been beach-tested yet, so no idea how it will hold up with swimming, salt water, or laundering, but the material has a substantial feel and opacity.<br /><br />Follow up: I bought this for my daughter, and I had to take it in on the sides. Even though she had an ample bosom, the suit still gapped at the sides. With the tucks in place, the suit performed well in the ocean, sand, and sun. It is great for tummy control, but I don't recommend it for a smaller bust because of the gapping."
4.0,Soooo cute received many complaints but I broke one trying to stretch it a little.  Should have been a tab bit bigger
4.0,"The belt is very cute, but it is unfortunate how it only comes in one size. I have a 27inch waist and had to poke extra holes in it so it would fit properly. Still a very cute buy for the price!"
4.0,Very comfy. Shipping took a bit but i am happy with these new bras.
4.0,"nice band, softer than what comes with the fitbit, i however do wish it had size options as i could use a smaller one."
4.0,"This purse is super cute and the PERFECT color! (I got the maroon one). I only have a few complaints: one that the gold chain sits funny on the loop, making it difficult to lay in the front. It also sometimes get caught on the loop, making the front flap difficult to close all the way. The second complaint is that the crossbody strap hook comes undone fairly easily. It has happened maybe three times so far in the week or so that I have had the purse — I don’t carry it often though. Not a huge issue but still annoying.<br /><br />Overall I still love the purse! For the name on the front and the price, I expected a little better, but I do not regret the purchase. I would give it a 4.5 if I could!"
4.0,Fits well. Very comfortable. Stays in place when wearing it.
4.0,"Good material, true to size and a fair price!"
4.0,Great quality. They just seemed a bit smaller than 1 inch. I had to trim down my photos
4.0,Very light A-line dress. Feels and looks great. Looking for another print!
4.0,"Definitely light-weight lounge pants. The fit around the crotch is a bit large for my taste, and the back hem doesn't come as far up as I would like to appease my bigger bum, but other than these small issues, I love the product. I would definitely would recommend it."
4.0,Nice compact size. Hard to get cards out of. Seems durable
4.0,The watch is really nice... A little small.. But wearable..  Goods good on my wrist.
4.0,It's just a tad bit long but nice to have a shirt to cover the back side for modesty.
4.0,"The fabric is different from what i thought, but is ok.  It is very comfortable and beautiful.  It fit as expected."
4.0,Cute shirt for my daughter but it does run small
4.0,Really cute pants. Fit is perfect. I am a size 16 and they fit great.
4.0,"Good fit. Materials appear to be good but waistband could be a little taller. No shrinkage or color fade after first wash. Too soon to say how durable they will be, but look promising."
4.0,"Perfect for my three year old, sturdy construction will surely outlast her interests, and be good to pass on to the next inspiring ballerina!"
4.0,Good little rechargeable keychain lite with variable brightness. It's a little noisey - clanks on my keys all the time - hard to go into stealth mode  =-D  Maybe R&D should design one with a rubberized housing. Good value!
4.0,Fits great but the factory smell is hard to get rid of. I recommend using fabric softener when washing to soften it up.
4.0,These earrings are so adorable! I love them! The only reason I gave  them a 4 star rating is because of the way they're made. The cuff part sticks out way too far and wouldn't stay on my ear  or fit properly. So in order to avoid returning these adorable beauties I had to bend the metal part of the cuff to fit.
4.0,"Originally I expected these to be about the size of a quarter. When I opened them, i was surprized at their size. They are pretty big. 2 inchesX 2inches.<br />Bigger than I usually wear but the are so light that i will keep them!"
4.0,Pretty. Not quite what I expected.
4.0,Very light and cute.  Larger than I anticipated.  My only complaint is that the back on one earring broke after one use and it flops forward.
4.0,Not as strong as I hoped it would be
4.0,very stylish worn look very comfortable if you prefer a tight fit.  I'd rather have a loose or relaxed fit in this style
4.0,Did their time. Very comfortable but will wear fast.
4.0,Lasted a fairly long time
4.0,"Love these shoes, I have put on at least 100 miles on these puppies under the rain and my feet are still dry!! Why 4 stars? They are a little on the heavy side, but I'm definitely buying  an extra pair just in case they dissapear from the shelves."
4.0,"Very nice set.<br /><br />While the rings don't line up 100% perfectly, they're not mismatched either and they do look really pretty.<br /><br />They can easily pass for real jewelry and the stones are nice and shiny, without being very fake looking.<br /><br />After about a year of use (not daily), the metal has suffered a bit of damage, mainly the part that is visible on the underside of my hand, which is good because that means it's not easily seen. I think it should remain in decent, wearable condition for another few years, at least."
4.0,Jumpsuit is a thicker material than I thought it was going to be. Also may not be for us tall girls. I’m 5’7” and around 200 with 40C and it’s cute but if it was a little longer in the leg like the picture it would be a slam dunk. Also it’s a tad hard to get out of since the straps do not adjust. If you notice the arm holes go down a bit so keep in mind your bra will probably show. Could be for house lounging or dressed up with heels.
4.0,"These are super cute! A little sheer around the ol curves, but I always wear a long jacket/shirt over my behind (removed a star).<br /><br />Very cozy and stretchy. Make sure you don't wash these on Hot! My husband did and they pilled up a little 😔. They stayed perfect on cold (as directed)."
4.0,I like the bag but it's much bigger than I usually buy. Could actually use it as an overnight bag.
4.0,"I ordered an extra large and it was pretty small, make sure that you are double checking your measurements before ordering"
4.0,The top got here a week before it was due. It looked exactly like the picture. The fit was perfect. I ordered a medium and I'm 5'4 and 150lbs.
4.0,Quality material and true to size.
4.0,Doesn’t have a draw string to tighten and they fit a little big.
4.0,"This ring is adorable and I love wearing it! It adjusts nicely which is good because I like to move it around to different fingers and also wear it as a midi ring or as a regular ring. So far, no issues with adjusting the size."
4.0,The material seems kind of cheap but it fits perfectly
4.0,The hat is really cute. The gloves are just a decal heat sealed on as opposed to a stitch design but if your little one likes trakkors this is a big hit.
4.0,Very cute earrings. A little bigger than I expected but they still fit my small ear lobes.
4.0,The colors look better on screen than in person.
4.0,Beautiful bracelet with green inlaid stones. Looks very elegant on the wrist.
4.0,"Just got it today and it looks and feels nice. Bold rich and bright colors. Material is soft but a bit sheer so wear your skin tone undies. I'm 5'2 120 lbs and it falls above my knee - yay! I'm petite so it's a bit big all around, but can be cinched in the waist with a belt."
4.0,Nice blouse. Nice color. Nice fit. Will need some ironing.
4.0,"The quality and construction of the item were fine.  However, I should have paid more attention to other comments about this item running small.  I don't have a very large neck and I couldn't even get this to button.  But, liked it well enough that I'll just move the buttons."
4.0,"Nice quality and color selection--- I bought the maroon, grey and black for my boyfriend. This turtleneck does run small and know that the cable pattern is only on the front the back is more of a rib pattern."
4.0,"This dress is perfect for summer. Soft and stretchy material, but I do recommend going up a size for that perfect fit. I ordered my normal size of 22 but it felt snug a bit so I ordered the next size up and it was perfect. I prefer comfortable, loose and not too clingy.  Very long for my 5'3"" frame, but I'm use to that. I just tied up the sides for a cute summer feel. Definitely would recommend."
4.0,Some were nice and some weren't what I wanted
4.0,Very nice and figure flattering. The material is slick and a bit on the cold side but warms up after you put it on.
4.0,"They look nice, fit comfortably, but my only gripe is that the frame is a little bit flimsy. But, for cheap, they're great mirrored aviators."
4.0,ordered too large of a lens. stay small if you want for Santa
4.0,This Costume looked so precious on my daughter and was a perfect Dorothy dress! Great length and very comfy. She is an average size 10 year old and the 10-12 fit great with room to spare. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was a button popped off the front Halloween night. Could easily be sewn back on though I guess. I would recommend this!
4.0,"Great wallet, nice and sleek design, but leaves marks if something is pressed on it for too long, nontheless this is a great wallet."
4.0,"I like them overall, but the fit was a bit snug. Good material."
4.0,"I wear linen dresses all summer and I usually spend much more Than this for them. I figured that I would try this one since it came with free returns. I was pleasantly surprised, only a few things to note...<br /><br />I am a 38DDD and the large just fits across my chest. However the bottom is overly roomy. The armholes fit well and cover my bra. The belt loops are way too high, those will have to be moved/removed. I am 5’1” and the dress falls right above my knee. The fabric is thinner than my other dresses but it still covers well. The dress was inexpensive and some small alterations should fix any obvious issues."
4.0,They fit smaller than we expected but still really cute and will fit for a while. Thanks!
4.0,These are very comfortable pants. Might want to size up for the waist. Others have mentioned the snap does let go but doesn’t seem to be a problem after wearing .
4.0,"This is the perfect beach vacation dress, flattering and lovely."
4.0,It's too small!!! But it's cute!!!
4.0,"It's a very cute dress.  The cotton is a bit thin, but I imagine it would be great to wear on a warm day.  Unfortunately, the zipper is under one arm, and that just does not work for me.  It was very difficult to get the dress off."
4.0,Love the fun flip up aspect and they look great and normal with the shades down. The flip up is a fun feature for when it’s not sunny and makes it easy to transition without having to remove glasses. I just wish the lid was more secure or it came with a screw driver to tighten since the lids sometimes fall down.
4.0,Liked how they looked and build quality was very nice but returned them only due to were tighter than I wanted on my temples.
4.0,"Cute and comfy dress. It runs a bit big so you may want to size down. I usually wear a Medium, but ordered a Small and it fits perfectly."
4.0,Got these for my wife. They look great and are well made but the taper on the ends is quite large. She can't wear them because she can't get past the taper. We are going to file it down and see if that helps.
4.0,"quality is not as nice, but it was still very comfortable for my 2 yr old to wear!!"
4.0,"Cute, soft shirt for casual work."
4.0,"The crystals are prettier in real life, but the color of the glasses was more opaque/darker than expected. I ordered the pink and it looked more dull or mixed with grey."
4.0,"The length was awesome, though it fit a little snug through the arms and shoulders and I ordered a 2xl. Wasn't really anticipating the arms being snug because all the other measurements were bigger than my actual measurements and I figured it would definitely fit, if not be a little loose. It's not loose, but it doesn't make me like it any less. I don't have huge upper arms, so maybe if I lose a couple of pounds it won't be snug on my arms. I'm eligible for free returns, but honestly I like this too much and got it at too good a price for me to want to give up, so I just pull the sleeves down a little and it's not super snug. Will take pictures to add to my review when I get home."
4.0,It's snug but not bad.
4.0,"Just like other reviews, some of the zippers (large teeth) would get stuck, but I used the bar of soap trick and after a few back & forth, they now work just fine.  This is a light and very versatile bag.  I just toss my smaller cloth bag into it when in a hurry; it is large enough to throw in a sweater, or notebooks/books and water!  Glad I got this bag."
4.0,A pretty bracelet - received it yesterday and started wearing it - hopefully this will help as it claims to do :)
4.0,"Glad it fit loosely, perfect for my 5'6&#34; frame, 200lb frame, wish all my leggings fit this way... Provides extra warmth"
4.0,Socks are comfy and good grip. Keep my feet moderately warm.<br />But one pair was larger than other. Not sure it was intended. More over the first order I received has one damaged. Amazon was great at shipping me a replacement right away.
4.0,I loved this dress but ended up returning it. It fit and looked great (I'm 110 lb and 5'4 )but its actually two pieces and I was just nervous that with moving around a lot and dancing I would have to be pulling at the inside slip to stay in place and I just didn't want to have to worry about that all night.
4.0,"Super cute top but the small was a little too big for me. I’m 5’6 and 120lbs. The top felt like it fit the way a medium would. If it was an extra small, it would be closer to my preferred fit."
4.0,"Heavier than I expected. Work good blocks blue light, hard to see my cell phones screen with them on, blocks uv."
4.0,My son is all into minecaft. This was the perfect gift for him. It takes more energy to have him take it off than to wear it.
4.0,"Necklace was beautiful, but the earrings were cheap looking."
4.0,"It was a little difficult to tell from the picture just how minimal these earrings are.  If I wear my hair down they are barely noticeable, slightly more so if my hair is back or up.  The description say sterling silver, but it's hard to tell by looking because they are so thin.  They appear polished but not shiny.  I would describe the finish as flat. Not matte.<br />They range in size from 2 inches to 2.25 inches.  I like that they are lightweight and don't pull down on my ears.  If you're looking for thin, lightweight minimal earrings then you'll be happy with these."
4.0,"I purchased these as favors for the little ones attending my Halloween wedding and I am sure they will be a big hit!  I am giving them only 4 stars because I received different patterns than those described. A little disappointing since it doesn't state any where that patterns my vary... Overall however they are super cute, really soft, and appear to be well made. Plus the price is right!"
4.0,"Cute,cozy,comfy"
4.0,I love the design but it fit a bit snugged. overall quality and design are great!
4.0,"I would purchase it again, but I would get a larger size."
4.0,rly nice when u get them! i used these for house slippers for maybe a year then they broke:/
4.0,"Great shirt! I love the design and the product but is way larger than other similar products I have purchased.  I am usually a large in most shirts, but I buy XL compression shirts.  I did the same for this one and am swimming in it."
4.0,great value and good looking sunglasses. Would certainly recommend
4.0,we are a family of four and my once weekly shopping is drudgery but these save me a step and they do cause people to ask where you got them.  yes the two extra bags are small but I was able to fit two boxes of cereal and a carton of eggs on top of one and in the other you can fit two loaves of bread.  the insulated bag is huge and sturdy.  the price is amazing.
4.0,These fit q bit larger than expected. Go down a size from what you think you are.  Very stretchy material!
4.0,"Although it’s much smaller than I expected, it’s a lovely bracelet. The color is really pretty."
4.0,I like this eye glass holder a lot!  I have it by my bedside and the lining doesn't smear my glasses like some of the fur type lining.  The bottom isn't weighted but the way it is made it doesn't tip over.  For the price it's a great product and looks nice on the night stand.
4.0,it fit well but I did not like the way it looked on me. Just a personal issue. Very pretty dress and light.
4.0,Great product-Looks just as stated in the picture!!
4.0,"Nice Try.  This is a good attempt at putting every possible way to keep glasses on the head.<br /><br />The rings worked great for about a week, BUT then the natural body oils penetrated the rings and they slide off.<br /><br />The ear hooks have same problem with added issue that they often go on upside down and have to be corrected on the ear.<br /><br />The head band had the highest promise, but the loops also slid off the end of the ear piece.<br /><br />Additional design is needed to create something that will hang onto the ear piece after a few weeks of use, particularly on ear pieces that are strait or near strait"
4.0,I would like it to have fit more like a spanx
4.0,"Fits the huawei watch perfectly, the band is a little stiff but seems to be of quality construction, a great purchase!"
4.0,Fits well. Had to lace them a few times to get it just right but haven't had to adjust them since. Works great for my sons Nike's!!!!
4.0,"I gave this as a gift, and it was well received. She loved the beads"
4.0,Quick buy
4.0,It was a big large but I'm rather small framed to begin with. I love this belt and hope to use it more than once.
4.0,These raincoats do the job at a good price.
4.0,"This sweater is very warm, well made with a thick lush weave. Buy a size bigger than you normally would and you'll be happy."
4.0,"Then if you wanna add this to your Batman collection, do so, it's a great item for Batman fans new and old."
4.0,"First of all the only reason this shirt got four stars?  My intentions were to use these as fitness / workout tee shirts.  However, the material is a bit too sheer and if you sweat, it will cling to your skin as you attempt to remove.  I need a material that is more like that used by Nike and Under Armour just a bit thicker.  However, the reason for the four stars is it is a good &#34;tee shirt&#34;.  Very sheer and will work for those who want to use these as an undershirt.  In my opinion, I suggest you order the appropriate size for your needs.  Since I was intending to use as a fitness tee I wanted it a bit loose like the in the pic.  However, if used as an undershirt get the size that's more fitted.  Unfortunately I will be returning my purchase."
4.0,For the price you really can’t beat it! Bought this as a last minute wear for a wedding and recieved compliments all night! It’s not as tight as it looks but it’s super comfy and easy to move in!
4.0,"My son was excited when he opened the box and saw these, he wasn't too happy about the fact that I have to return them for a bigger size. He didn't want to tell me that they did not fit, I noticed how small they looked on him. I ordered a 30 aka 13 in the US, so I now have to find a seller with these in a US size 1. Overall they are very cute, affordable and the LED lights worked fine."
4.0,Muy lindas!
4.0,"a little larger then i expected i'm 34 - 27 -36.5 measurements weight of 124 at 5'7&#34; got the medium and could have gone with the small, stretches. medium wasn't too much bigger but not as form fitting as i would have liked. still an awesome jacket, just be careful cause it can snag on things quite easily. keeps me pretty warm on a chilly night"
4.0,Very pretty and I received sooner than I spect!
4.0,"i only rated 4 out of five since these were really tight and if you were to try and pry them open to fit your ties and you go too far, you might not be able to get them flat/tight enough again to fit othe ties"
4.0,"Bought it for my mom for Christmas. Was great width, But it was boarder line crop top length."
4.0,I've gotten many compliments on this garment. Very stylish!
4.0,Didn't like ruffled sleeve cuff. I had to tuck them in. Going to attempt to fix them permanently.
4.0,Its tricky to pick the shirts from Asian countries but the are so nice and well made
4.0,"This is a nice watch. I love the hourly notification feature, reminds me how fast time flies. My only concern is that sometimes when the button that alternates 24h/12h time gets hit by a sleeve or when bending my wrist. I wish that setting were a little more hidden, as if you have a preference over the two you likely don't need to change it at the push of a button.<br /><br />The back light is weak, but it is just enough for reading it in a pinch, even out to the seconds."
4.0,"Size was accurate, and material/quality seems good.  I’m happy in most respects, except that I got a sunburn through the pants.  Doesn’t seem to offer any UV protection."
4.0,This is adorable. Beware it is see through so you will need an undershirt and I know my 4 year old will heed help putting it on or she will get tangled in it. Now worries there but it does have a panel type thing in it.
4.0,"I'm 5'4&#34;, 120 lbs, curvy but small-boned. I ordered a Medium & it fits as expected--great in the legs & snug around my mid-section (where I carry my extra weight). These leggings fit like panty-hose: be prepared to pull them on the same way! Skin-tight is how they look & feel, so if you're having a good day, you'll feel sexy af. If you're bloated, you'll feel like a hippo.<br /><br />They do have a synthetic &#34;fishy&#34; smell to them, so either hand wash them or deal with it the first few wears.<br /><br />Overall, I'm pretty happy with them!"
4.0,Bought these as a father's day gift and have lasted for years. The only issue is that the lens scratch fairly easily but they are easy to replace.
4.0,I liked that the size gave me some room to breath.  However I can't use it in hospital as they require the KN95.
4.0,"These are pretty and work with my metal allergy. They are not super shiny but I like the look. One complaint, the hook is open super wide so pokes behind my ear and the earring doesn't sit quite right."
4.0,This outfit is absolutely adorable! Runs a little big but he will grow into it!
4.0,A great shirt to hang around in. Comfy and soft but not too thin. Fit is wonderful and flattering! A great find!
4.0,So far so good.  I always have a hard time finding &#34;girl&#34; shorts that aren't too short.  These are perfect!
4.0,Nice for the price but the wristband is too short.
4.0,"I ordered a 2x for room. I have a 30"" waist but saw they run a bit small....BRO THESE ARE MICROSCOPIC. 2X WHERE? super soft and feel pretty nice but I'm going to have to return, which bums me out because I was excited for new comfypants"
4.0,"Super soft, material is doubled so definitely no see through. Pocket on inside is cool but makes a weird line, won't be hiding anything in there. 5'3, 125-130#, got the XL, not compression fit at that size, definitely could have went with a L but they didn't roll or slide down."
4.0,"It's very cute , the necklace as I knew already was plastic no big deal.  I would probably buy again ."
4.0,this Dress is super cute. I love the length and the buttons all the way down. I’m not quite sure how to wash it- the material is a little bit stiff but I like it- I got the white and it’s not terribly see through with how thick the material is. The only thing I do wish is that it came in an XS. It is very loose fit! But makes for a good casual summer dress for those super hot days!
4.0,"I am not sure if it is simply that my body shape is different than the model's lol but the slit is way bigger on mine. Other than that, very comfy"
4.0,"I just received this winder today. Reasonable build quality, discrete controls for each turntable with turns per day settings (650-1850) directional (CW, CCW, both) and off. I would have preferred the band to start lower as 650 is pretty high for the lowest setting and I'm not sure what watch needs 1850 turns per day. Possibly some older automatics require that, I'm not sure. It is completely silent. I have a hard time hearing the motors with my ear right next to it.<br /><br />The box is attractive and my watches look nice spinning away inside. The drawer is a nice touch to store quartz, lesser used automatic watches or other jewelry. Be aware though, this is a big honkin' box. The product description says 8.5x10x10&#34; LxWxH. The actual dimensions are 14x10.5x10&#34; LxWxH. That's not terrible, but it does occupy front to back of my dresser and is not what I expected. The shipping box was enormous. I wondered who sent me a mini-fridge when I found it in my hallway.<br /><br />This is my third winder in less than two years. The first one was a dual table Diplomat that cost (I think) $70. It was straight-up junk. It had annoying blue LED lights that you couldn't turn off and was noisy from day one. By 6 months it was stupid noisy and I didn't even want it fixed, I just threw it away. The second one was a dual table Belocia that had a leather clad stitched finish and cost $100. It was attractive, silent and the left turntable died shortly before its first birthday a couple weeks ago. Although I never registered for warranty, I contacted Belocia one year to the day of purchase for a warranty claim and they never even bothered to reply.<br /><br />I really hope this Heiden lasts, but I'm starting to think that maybe Wolf winders cost a small fortune because they're the only ones that don't die in short order. Time will tell. Today, I'm happy with this winder for day-one form and function. I promise to update this review if it turns out to be another disappointment."
4.0,This dress worked for my Halloween costume!  I got the size medium and I’m 5’2 150 lbs athletic build. The material was decently thick - I didn’t notice any see through areas. It wasn’t as stretchy or soft as I would of liked- more of a thicker cotton. Felt a little snug around my chest area. I was wearing a sports bra and typically wear a size 36 C/D bra.<br />I liked the scrunchy look in the mid section which gave it a little more style than just a flat tight maxi dress. Overall it was cute and fit nice.
4.0,Tuve que pedir in size mas grande
4.0,"5'5, 135 lbs. Normally size 6-8 for womens clothing, have normal body frame but wide shoulders. Ordered size 2x and suit was painfully tight under arms and could barely zip around waist. Had to return to ordered size 3x!. Material and product is amazing for the price. Looks better than other high price wet suits, just recomend ordering larger."
4.0,Nice earring but ad did not clearly specify quantity as only one each. Otherwise I like this item very much.
4.0,good goggle quality but the lock could be easily broke if not carefully. so must be stored in the case after use to avoid any accident.
4.0,like the pattern and how it fits.
4.0,"The dress was beautiful and well made, but ran big over all.  I've tried many of these dresses and the tops are all made quite large with big breast cups with the breast cups being down further than what they need be.  That being said my daughter is 5'1 and 92 lbs. I feel like most anyone wearing a size 0-2 dress will definitely not be able to wear any of them without alterations.  Most of the sellers offer custom made by measurements and that would probably be best.  I had to return because all the alterations she would need would compromise the dress way too much to work."
4.0,"Other than fitting a bit small for my 3 yr old, it was a good value!"
4.0,"It's my fault, but I actually thought the sweater was longer. It actually worked out nicely though."
4.0,"Plenty of compliments, great quality for price"
4.0,I really like the dress but it ran too small.
4.0,Really cute. Get a lot of comments on it. Well made. Good buy for price.
4.0,"Love this dress! It is a bit thinner than expected, but the square neck is very flattering."
4.0,"Bought the bags to easily attach a stitched piece of needlework.  The bags are made out of a rough burlap  which appears to have a stitch count of 14-16, but for me are too coarse to stitch on directly. Can't rate the sturdiness as I haven't started to use either of the bags yet, but on appearance they appear fine.  Four stars since the (most likely faux) leather handles are not big enough to sling over shoulder."
4.0,This is an open ring which makes it adjustable I guess. I was expecting a closed ring but it doesn’t change the look
4.0,A little thinker then I expected but very soft and warm.
4.0,"I wear a xxl normally but ordered a xxxxl and it fits pretty good. Feels great on skin and really looks good. I wish they had other colors. If you get the size right,I suggest 2 above normal ,you'll love it."
4.0,"The handles on this bag are very comfortable, very easy on your shoulders. Withstands regular wear and tear. Used this bag for a year, every weekend. Still in top notch shape. I only wished the material of the bag was more appealing/softer - but maybe if it was it wouldn't be as durable. Either way it looks great, is comfortable, durable and can store enough while still being small. It's one of my smaller weekend bags but holds all my cosmetics and enough clothes for a weekend."
4.0,This is a beautiful cuff.  It gets 4 instead of 5 stars because I can only wear it on one part of my ear or it will fall off.  Great price!
4.0,I received the goods and the product is wonderful and excellent and I recommend dealing with the seller to his degree
4.0,"These are comfy! I got a L, M, & S. Pictures attached to show the difference of fit! Usually a size 4 but everything fits differently! Most likely keeping size S. Hard to decide between keeping M for comfy clothes or bloated days.. they are all comfy fits tbh depending on what you’re looking for! There is no extra “support” here, if you were looking for workout leggings & Also very thin."
4.0,Took awhile to get here and starting to tarnish
4.0,"Nice bright t shirt. Great quality. Soft.  However , ran much smaller than my other large t shirts<br />Fit like a medium."
4.0,Comfortable fit. Would like to see added padding for additional cup sizes.
4.0,Semi small but super cute details. I definitely recommend it!
4.0,"I think this dress fits well, my only qualm with it is that the back can have a tendency to fold over itself, but nothing a little fashion tape can fix. There is also not as much support in the breast area, so if you're a bit bustier I recommend getting a bracelet or backless bra to accompany it. Overall satisfied with this purchase"
4.0,Received it today. It has weight to it and the charms are nice. Wish it was a little brighter.<br /><br />UPDATE: a bit small. Teen daughter got it for Christmas and it was tight around her wrist. Could all so use a few more beads to give it a full look.
4.0,"I love the color and fabric! Made in the USA. Personalized tag is a nice touch. It was made relatively quickly for a customized shirt. I think the measurement algorithms still need a little bit of tweaking. I entered all the info as asked, as well as the pictures & the shirt was still a bit long in the sleeves - minor issue. I would re-order in a different color."
4.0,I had to return and order a size down.
4.0,The quality was great but the shirt was alot bigger and looser than I expected
4.0,The left side zipper takes a little to gets used to.
4.0,"It's a little cheap, as should be expected. The clasps aren't so good quality. They're actually pretty bad. But. I like the design though its cute. I coated it in clear nail polish so it will last. I'm a little upset the price just dropped on this."
4.0,"It’s good quality, it’s just a little big for my wrist because i have very tiny wrists."
4.0,Love this dress and it has pockets!  The only thing I wasn’t fond of was the sleeve length and I plan to alter it
4.0,"Lobster clasp doesn't open, but easy to replace. Worth the money."
4.0,"Very good fit! Go one size above what you normally wear though like I did. The zipper is a bit cheap and sometimes hard to zip up, which is my only complaint. The material is no thicker than a shirt so layer if you plan on using it as a coat. Great for my freezing office though!"
4.0,"Wear this all the time, had to put it on a leather strap because the chain is very small."
4.0,Very cute and nice looking for the price. Gave them to a cat loving friend for her birthday and she lived them.
4.0,Wish this came in a pack of 10 or 12! Very comfortable and adjusts to fit for the whole family. Thanks!
4.0,I don’t like the texture of the skirt. Does not feel like cotton.
4.0,The material is soft and they fit well. Very comfortable!!
4.0,"For the price, thus us a great buy."
4.0,"Very Nice!  I like it a lot.<br />If improve on the quality of the material, would be even more satisfying!"
4.0,"I love the smell of the leather.  I love the compartments, and the way the leather feels.  The one thing I would change since it is a bucket bag, is the size.  I think if it were at least one inch wider, I would make it a 5 star review."
4.0,"these are an above ankle sock, 1st  ones  I opened  got holes  where the joiner passes  thru them, it was probably my fault,  was more careful with next pairs and no dime  size holes.<br /><br />they are  very soft and comfortable, and best of all, no treads like hospital socks"
4.0,Love t.  Fits great.  Not too heavy.  But it sheds a lot.  I had fur all ver my pants
4.0,Hat is a little snug at first but loosens up with time. Had to take a star of for the tightness and it being a little short
4.0,"Cute fashion piece.  Gave to one of my daughters and she loves it.  Has held up nicely.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's BRIGHT YELLOW.  On my screen it appears cream colored or neutral.  Not sure if I missed that in details or it doesn't state.  However, I'm still happy an so is my daughter as it's a cute piece."
4.0,I really like these slippers. For some reason the left ones opening is smaller than the right one. I am hopeful that it will stretch to make putting them on easier.
4.0,Nothing special. U pay for what u get.
4.0,Worth your money. I wear this ring all the time and it's still holding strong. Very cute.
4.0,"These $2,000 sunglasses only perform like $1,800 sunglasses. :(<br />If you find them for $1,800 or less, go for it!"
4.0,"The A6 top fit perfect, no complaints. Although the pants are about 3-4 inches short. But, I’m tall as hell (6’8) so that’s expected. I’ll try to find an A7 the same color & use the pants. I wish more companies sold “tall” sizes."
4.0,"you probably get more for your money on this band than most others.  it looks great and has not faded at all.  the only issue is that the retaining loops continually slip and the end of the band pops out.  if you wear the band more tightly than i do, that might not be a problem.  in any event, great product and totally worth it."
4.0,"I like this bracelet.  It's pretty.  I guess I expected it to be more bulky...it's kind of dainty.  I bought it as a gift, and I think she'll like it too."
4.0,Nice selection. Great price. Good quality. Nicely packaged.
4.0,"Unfortunately, this shirt did not work for me. I needed a shirt with functional buttons due to an upcoming shoulder surgery; this is a “button-down pullover”. However, it is otherwise a nice shirt. I normally wear a M/L and ordered an XL, anticipating needing the extra room due to my surgery and it was still a pretty decent fit, didn’t swallow me."
4.0,"Watch arrived in timely fashion, and was in great shape.<br />However, was too large for my granddaughter..so I have returned it and<br />purchased another one.  Bling has been most helpful throughout the<br />entire process.  Thank you!"
4.0,"Love Frye. Have quite a few pairs of their boots, all size 8. These run a bit big. I'm on the fence about exchanging them for a smaller size. First pair that I've run into this with. Still quite a nice boot."
4.0,"Cute belt, buckle doesn't stay connected very securely."
4.0,Bought this for travel slippers. They are a little bulky but warm and do the job.
4.0,"Very cute, love the show! My only main complaint is that the fabric is not very breathable. The fit could be a little big on some people, but I thought it was perfect on me."
4.0,Really like these pants! They look like a skirt when walking and are great for a semi casual office look.
4.0,"This dress fit fine, but just didn't work on me. If the material stretches, it does show white underneath. Not the best made, but comfortable for the part."
4.0,"This jumpsuit is stretchy, so go one size down, it was big on me."
4.0,"Tolerable product. Had cracks in the inner shell at opening but since I don't know how they got there (possibly due to rough handling in transit) I'm not going to make a mountain out of a mole hill. Since I'm going to be modifying it anyways it only means I'll have to do a fraction more work to get it how I want it, that's all. I'm satisfied."
4.0,Thick sweater. Perfect fit for my granddaughter 👍
4.0,"Good weight, comfortable, and very stylish.  Is keeping excellent time three days after initial wind and stays wound over night when I take it off.  The glint from the beveled face gives it an excellent appearance, and the size and color make it easy to read and fun to look at.  Only taking off one star because it lacks the release mechanism when the spring is taut.  Just don't go nuts winding it when you first get it, 20-30 winds seem fair.  As long as you don't damage a gear over winding it, this seems a perfect watch for its price, style, and mechanism.  The auto-mechanism seems to be working well keeping it wound, the cost is just right, and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a low cost watch that looks like a million bucks."
4.0,"Love these! They are a little tight so they tug on your ears just a bit, not too bad."
4.0,I have a 31 inch waist and even the tightest notch on the size small was too big. Disappointing because it's a really nice belt. Also arrives in very nice packaging.
4.0,love the frog but he could have been just a tad larger.  have trouble keeping him in place.  unfortunately will probably loose him too soon
4.0,"Yes, it's as beautiful as the photos show it to be and it's probably larger than you'd expect. About 1 inch larte. This 'Heart of the Ocean' pendant, provided by vendor at a significant discount as a 'for review' item, could make for a spectacular Valentine Day's gift, well-suited even for a special (as different from casual) person for as long as that 'blue' agrees with that her.<br /><br />The crystal is just beautifully cut, the design is original, the chain it comes with matches the pendant and it all comes in a nice gift box that has a black velvety bag inside. So, why 'four' stars? There's only one issue and it could be just a defect that doesn't affect everyone but the pendant that I received does not glide freely on the chain. Yes, it does glide but the key word here is 'freely'."
4.0,"Very pretty bracelet. This has the large green/orange color beads and than between them are smaller shaped beads. There is an apple on a dangle. A leaf.  A frog. Another apple. A snake and a bag of money. I assume these may have some significance to certain people. Green and orange being earthy colors and green being the color of money. You can remove any of these beads and replace them very easily. I do have to have someone help me put this on, kind of hard to one-handed and I did notice a little bit of discoloration on clasp and the dangling bead. Nothing else is discolored at all or fading. But when I wear this I have done dishes, washed hands etc I don't recommend that as of course it can damage things. Other then that very pretty bracelet. I have had a lot of compliments and it wears well with a lot of things. I'm going to have to get some of the other colors now.<br /><br />I received this product for free for my honest review."
4.0,"They work well enough, but they're kind of stiff and harder to put on than my son's other pair. He can't out them on by himself, which is annoying."
4.0,"Very very comfy, love them ... :)"
4.0,I tried an 8 on in the store and it was too big. I ordered the 6 and it didn't zip up all the way.<br />I guess the dress wasn't meant to be.
4.0,Soft. Will order through them again
4.0,Protects my sunglasses against scratches.  That is why I bought it and that is what it does.  What more can you say about this product.  Nothing.
4.0,I ordered a size larger thinking it ran small but it doesn't. My regular size would have been fine
4.0,"This poncho is waterproof. It's large enough that I can use it on my bicycle and the front flap covers my handlebars. The material is very heavy and thick, but in some places it is already starting to crumble and tear, like around the edges of the hood. I don't think this will be much of a problem in the long run."
4.0,"I'm 5'5"" and 180lbs and the XL fit well. I'm glad I sized up. This is a very conservative suite and covers more than I wanted to. I think it's going to leave a funky tan but it's really cute."
4.0,"Cute top! Very lightweight and fits true to size. I am 5'5, 34B, and a medium was perfect."
4.0,The tops were nice however it definitely was a return from another customer because there were deodorant marks all over one of the tops as if they tried it on😣  not happy about.
4.0,"It fit nicely, but I just got it so not much to say."
4.0,"I use this with my fitbit all the time, but the screws have a tendency to unscrew so keep an eye on that. Otherwise it looks really nice on and keeps the fitbit in place.  Get a small screwdriver to open the cage, the pick they give you is crap."
4.0,A beautiful watch but  i hate the leather strap
4.0,Received the earrings and they are wonderful.  Love the backs and love the sparkle.  I would urge anyone to try these
4.0,"The color is a little bit more bright than on the picture (on the picture it looks like blue-gray when in reality it's cobalt blue) Russian Shawls of Pavlovo Posad are very lightweight and warm, the patterns also very beautiful."
4.0,"The material is pretty thin, so I just wear them with tunics and t-shirts cuz I love the print. They're great for a humid day when you want something lightweight."
4.0,"It is beautiful and very dainty.  I needed for a prayer box and it looks beautiful, just wish I had ordered a little heavier chain to ensure that the prayer box doesn't snap the chain!!"
4.0,These work great for my dogs anxiety drooling in the car.  Just wish they would be a bit thicker to be more absorbant.
4.0,Gift for great granddaughter
4.0,Run smaller but looks good
4.0,I’m 5’7 and 150 lbs and the jumper fit perfectly. It was a little uncomfortable with the sequins at times. The ties around the neck were a little flimsy but fine for one night.
4.0,"Great and cute product. Very sturdy and adjustable. I did have to hot glue some of it back on, but otherwise very nice."
4.0,The band is a bit small
4.0,Great belt and very Professional
4.0,This product is nice but a bit larger than expected.
4.0,"Had to get a size bigger (according to measurements size 3, but had to return to get size 3.5) and it fits snug so there was no concern of losing a shoe in the water. My daughter used these at the beach and  to snorkel and she was very comfortable in them never had a need to take off. They work well as sneakers too with comfortable grip."
4.0,"Perfect for intended use as a Hetalia costume piece. Daughter loved them. Not the most solid construction, but not expected to be."
4.0,Heels couldn’t help with the length if I tried. I did expect it to be long though. I love the color. I’m gonna customize it😊
4.0,Cute shoe way too big for me. I wear a 7 1/2 ordered a 8. My daughter wears a 91/2 they fit her perfectly
4.0,"I love the cut of these pants- very flattering, especially at the front. I've gotten lots of compliments on them. However, at least for the light colored pants, you can see right through them. Be prepared to go commando."
4.0,"cute shoes, true to color as shown but to small had to return"
4.0,So I am average sized 5'9&#34; 200 lbs. and this fit well and with room for a padded garment under it. Also fast delivery.
4.0,Good product! Does what I need them to! Scratches easily!
4.0,"It is a great mask for the price, leaving 4 stars as the paint seems uneven and cracked in spots. This is not going to affect my costume project though, I am happy with it as is. My mask is also matte and not glossy are the photo."
4.0,Super comfortable! My first pair. More than just socks because it has a sole. Will definitely be ordering more in different colors.
4.0,"Very cute, nice quality.  About nickel size, I’d have preferred larger and wire rather than posts, but all said they’re still cute."
4.0,"Adorable set, it's difficult to find girly dinosaurs so this was great to find. Fits a little snug but these sets usually do."
4.0,Very comfortable and stylish.  Comes with a sturdy case.
4.0,"Simple, clearly not real turquoise, looks just fine."
4.0,"It’s a nice bag.  It was very inexpensive, and I wanted one that I don’t worry about.  I’m an artist and get paint on just about everything."
4.0,"All is good except the spring mechanism is a little ""sticky"""
4.0,Good size for elementary aged children.  Print has nice detail.
4.0,I'm a convert to the holeless belt.  Looks and functions great.
4.0,Works great as a gym dirty cloths bag!<br />Delivered quickly.
4.0,"Smaller than I expected, but that's my fault for not looking closely at the posted dimensions.  Still a cute, useful pouch to keep small items organized inside a bigger tote bag. Compass print is very pretty."
4.0,I washed it before I wore it and it faded a little. Still pretty it just looks worn already.
4.0,would have liked a smaller neck
4.0,The bow and sparkles flaked off fast but is still a wearable shoe
4.0,I ordered S but still it was too big. But looks okay. I like the design. But poor material.
4.0,"Super cute but runs big , I’m 5’2 165lbs I got the xl , it’s like to sizes to big ."
4.0,Returned due to sizing being a little off.
4.0,We have been pleased with this item. It is good quality and a nice size. It is bigger than we thought it would be.
4.0,"We sent back and ordered size up, maybe should've ordered two sizes up. Only wore the second size for Christmas season. Super cute though!"
4.0,I bought this chain to wear with my work outfits because of its simple and elegant design.  The necklace  was also available in a longer length which I prefer.  It works beautifully and I am pleased with my purchase.
4.0,"Very nice product, well constructed and good fit. Previous gloves I owned had more padding on the palm. Can't wait to try out once weather permits"
4.0,Product is beautiful...shipping took a really long time though.
4.0,These aren't as pretty as I expected them to be but they work great. Seem to be a quality made product. Customer Service is great. Fit fairly well.
4.0,heel is a lil offset but very comfortable
4.0,Great for a starter kit.
4.0,Just what I was looking for. A Basic Simple watch with  a few extras.
4.0,Pretty baggy
4.0,"The quality is amazing, but it does run quite small, I ordered bigger cause I wanted it to be a bit baggy and it's more fitted."
4.0,This is a very cute and flattering swimsuit however it is not the same color as the picture. Still very cute though. If you’re a curvier person than I recommend getting an extra large unless you like the smaller sized look. I bought a Large and it fits well for the most part.
4.0,"Nice fabric - has a light linen feel to it. Stripes are very classy looking. You can dress it up with a nice pair of heels for dinner on a lovely summer night or dress down with some cute sandals for a day of shopping. For reference I wear a medium / large, curvy 5'3&#34; so I ordered the large and it fits very nicely, not too snug, not too loose. My only complaint is the elastic in the sleeve opening is extremely tight so I will have to have a tailor fix that so that I can wear the sleeves high up around my elbow. All in all, it was a good purchase."
4.0,"This product protected my Coolife suitcase while traveling overseas. However, I bought as advised, a size larger and the wheels kept getting caught in the fabric, and I t got pretty beaten up pretty badly.<br /><br />I tried it on  my largest bag before and after the flights.  Before it seemed very tight, didn’t couldn’t get it on the larger bag. After the flights, it is tight, but I could get it on and zipped on the bottom.<br /><br />The two largest Coolife bags are the only bags I will check when flying.  Get yours a few weeks before you go so you can check the fit. The company is very good about returns.<br /><br />I returned the XL after I found the L now fits my biggest bag.  I just ordered a medium for the bag I used for this last trip. I’d advise for Coolife not to go up a size. On your biggest bag, muscle it on. Clearly I like the product as I just purchased the medium. I may be muscling on my medium.  We’ll see. The only reason I’m giving a 4 star is because my L one got beaten up pretty badly and going up a size wasn’t good advice for Coolife people."
4.0,"Fabric is thin, but good for price."
4.0,It is really hard to find much of anything that is nickel free.  I love the cross.  I only wish it would be a wee bit larger.  If is small and that's my only reason for giving the necklace 4 stars and not 5.
4.0,"fits well, rugged good match for work watch."
4.0,this item took FOREVER to get. the product itself isn't bad. it fits my ear. does not fit my sons or boyfriends ear so i can only hope it fits the ear of the person i bought it for. my suggestion would be for amazon to publisize WHERE the product is coming from (not just the company). i hate ordering items directly from Hong Kong due to it takes way to long to recieve.
4.0,"Too large for me, the heel cup keeps turning and I have extra space in toes, I wear size 9 shoes."
4.0,"I LOVE THIS TOP. its so cute and the color is gorgeous, i got the gray. believe me that you will love how it looks and feels no matter what the occasion is."
4.0,Absolutely love these biker shorts. Can dress up or down in theses. They are Great for my workouts and yoga classes. They do run a little small in my opinion.
4.0,"Product is good - not too tight not too loose.  But the beige color is off-white, not the oatmeal brown pictured"
4.0,"So far so good. The leather is soft and does seem to be genuine, and the wallet is a great size. It could easily hold 11-15 cards, which is plenty. There were no scratches or scuffs. I bought it as a gift and haven't given it to the recipient yet, so I don't know how durable it will be. I will update the review if any problems arise. I also had to contact the seller for something regarding payment, and they responded immediately and were very helpful. Overall, my experience with this wallet has been great. I only give it 4 stars for now instead of 5 because I don't know how it will hold up to constant use yet."
4.0,I haven't worn earrings for some time but I didn't want the piercing holes close up so I wanted something to leave in all the time. I chose these because they're nice simple and pretty. They fit the bill and I've been wearing the silver ones since I got them however the piece that goes through the ear is unusually rough and that made it hard to put them on. I did use a file to smooth it off of a bit and now they work fine.
4.0,"Original review (1 Star) : Terrible quality. The metal rod broke within 2 weeks.<br /><br />Updated review (4 Stars): They reached out to me after my original review and sent me a replacement. We'll see how this one goes, but they get 3 more stars from the original review due to good customer support/relation/PR."
4.0,"Fabric quality is ok isn’t uncomfortable or itchy, however the dress fit pretty big on me and I usually fit well into a small and sometimes medium"
4.0,Good color. Does what it's supposed to do.
4.0,Its okay. Hot to wear. Nice design
4.0,"I was looking for a small clutch for when I need something dressier to carry, but I needed it to be large enough to hold my Note 5 phone, as well as a small credit card case and other necessities--I'm kind of high maintenance. :) This bag is the perfect size for all these things.<br /><br />I didn't realize how handy the double zipper would be until I actually used it. It's nice to be able to have my phone on one side by itself and have my money and credit cards on the other side so that I don't have to fumble around one set of things to get to the other.<br />The faux leather has a nice feel to it.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the zippers are a little on the flimsy side and don't feel like they'll last very long, so I'll have to be sure not to over-pack this clutch. I've had it for a couple of weeks now, and so far, it's done just fine.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,I liked this a lot but the rose gold sections don’t really match the apple color. It still look lovely.
4.0,I loved this product and I am ordering another pair. I am also spreading the word about them as well.
4.0,"I work in fine dining and have to wear a white shirt and a tie. It’s so hard to find a shirt that fits my bust. Although I loved the no iron light material, I had to send it back. Unfortunately it doesn’t come any larger than XXL."
4.0,"Im a size eight, 140 lbs DD boobs and a big butt.  I bought a medium and it fits great even if I gain a a little it would still fit!"
4.0,"Great for hiking, easy to zip off into shorts."
4.0,True to the picture shown. It is pretty but I took off one star because -the deep red cotton thread is attached to the pendant with a tacky wire ....
4.0,"I wanted a vest similar to the Scottevest with lots of internal pockets without the $100 price tag.  This is the closest thing I can find anywhere. While there isn’t as many functional internal pockets as the SCOTTeVEST, there is ample room to store an small tablet (iPad mini). I wanted a vest for either travelling or just commuting to work to store my electronic devices. It is a softshell design so it should repel light rain.<br /><br />I wish they would have posted a better sizing chart. The medium size was slightly big but should be good for layering. Since it’s relatively inexpensive compared to the SCOTTeVEST I may get a smaller one next time. For size reference I am 5’-7” & wear a 15-1/2 32-33 dress shirt (medium build). I’m sure the smaller size would have a slimmer fit.<br /><br />It would be nice if the made more colors like blue, khaki. This vest is good for fall thru spring. It would be too hot to wear in the summer."
4.0,"Wish it opened flat, if need be. Otherwise it is great."
4.0,They just didn't look good on me. They fit nicely. They were cheap though so I'm still glad I tried them out.
4.0,Bastante bien el material un poco grueso Pat mi gusto
4.0,It’s good but the rainbow looking one didn’t come out to be metal it’s acrylic with sparkles with come off after a while the side of it also bothers me since the whole I the middle isn’t big enough for my liking but it’s still the sizes I want
4.0,"In a hard year, it is nice to recognize people. This is a simple and beautiful gift for teachers."
4.0,Fits a little small but needs to be so they don't slip.
4.0,Ordered this for a friend of mine. Looked quite nice. First picture is without flash and the second is with flash.
4.0,Loved the patters. Right size to carry just what you need.
4.0,"Overall very pleased with this purchase. While I expected this style to be slightly oversized, it was a little more than that. The ""V"" neck really wasn't as deep as I wanted and expected. Not really low enough for a modest person to have to wear it layered over something to help cover up. While the material is comfortable, you can expect it to catch every stray hair and piece of loose lint (so if you are blonde, don't order black!). It is not a particularly warm sweater for cold weather. Worked great with temps in the 50's. I've enjoyed wearing this three times over this past cool week!"
4.0,Happy with the purchase.  Does require some ironing or else it get very wrinkled.
4.0,I'm 5&#34;5' 130 and ordered M and it fits very well.
4.0,Need better Belt in back of the hat
4.0,"Blouse was a bit to loose for me. I'm a 38D with 34 inch waistline. I did have to alter it. But overall, I do love the blouse and it looks nice on. So, I would recommend this item."
4.0,I'm petite 4'11 and a small is a little big on me.
4.0,"The bra that says khaki in the description and looks nude or ivory is actually an odd cross between a creamsicle, light orange color, and a bandage, yellowy tan color.  I wanted it to wear under a white racerback bodysuit, but this color shows through it, unfortunately. I'm a 32D and got a small, it's a comfortable bra, though the padding is very thick padding and a bit too much, so I would remove it and replace with thinner pads or wear nipple covers."
4.0,Looks just like the picture and fits well
4.0,Causal dress...Its great!!!!
4.0,"This is the 8th Life is good t-shirt I have purchased so far, and they fit and look as expected."
4.0,Arrived just as advertised. Patch looks good now I feel I'm really a part of the massive empire!!
4.0,"I love the quality, material and price of this outfit. However, it really fades after being washed. I have had this issue before with cheaper clothing from Amazon, so my advice would be to let this outfit air dry, instead of going into the dryer in order to help prevent fading."
4.0,Has not been worn yet but the medium looks a little big in the waist and might need to be taken in a bit. Nice material.
4.0,was smaller then size
4.0,"Cute and comfy a little large. Ordered a medium and I'm 5'3 135lbs, should've gone with a small."
4.0,Order medium-size get large. Large fit.... easily shrink.
4.0,"The problem I have with them is the lack of arch support and the memory foam flattens in spots.They are made well in other areas and if you don't need arch support they would be good. I have plantar fasciitis in my left foot, so not comfortable for me. I didn't want to return them so wear for short periods,until get pain.They are good looking and liked the color."
4.0,"Dress was as advertised, and is about a half-size large.  Beyond that bit, nothing at all to complain about."
4.0,Just a tad bit loose around the ankle but I can fix it so I'm happy with it.
4.0,"Great bag, holds alot of items. Excellent for gym or beach use.<br />Highly recommended."
4.0,"I love this sunglasses because not only they're stylish, but they also big and protect half of your face. The only downside is that if you wear bobby pins on a daily basis like I do, this sunglasses will scratch easily. Like they say you get what you pay for."
4.0,Thanks I am happy with it.
4.0,"Shoeslocker Women's Soft Round Toe Ballet Flats are a cute denim blue ballet flat, with a twist of material over the toes.  They are super cute, comfortable for around the house ~ these are the shoes I slip on after a long day at work to lounge around the house in!!  Great little shoes."
4.0,Soft and fitted. Aline dress
4.0,Fogs up a bit but really cute and stylish
4.0,"Great shirt, it is rather long in the back which I didn't realize. Would buy again!"
4.0,My granddaughter loves it. She thought it was very pretty.
4.0,Ok just sizes run big
4.0,"This packable down jacket was the best thing I purchased to bring on my Alaskan cruise. It's so thin, but warm, and it can be layered with other tops/jackets. I loved the fact that it was packable so I could roll it up and put it in it's little bag and throw in my backpack on port excursions. It DOES shed to your shirts a little, but if you want an inexpensive, thin lightweight, warm, packable jacket.. this is perfect."
4.0,"The band was perfect width for my Casio and included extra pins and a tool for installing and removing.  The buckle is good and the band material soft and pliable.  My only complaint is it's a bit short, so I'm using holes 2 and 3 from the end and the free end has a hard time staying in its retainer.  The second retainer is just out on the band, which looks odd.<br /><br />Pins in band are retained and have a small knob for tool-less installation or removal.  The 4 spares are conventional pins.<br /><br />Overall, a good value.  If you have a large wrist, be sure it's Prime with free returns when you buy.<br /><br />Review of: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KXF9HMT/<br />""WOCCI Silicone Watch Bands - Quick Release Soft Rubber Replacement Straps (...)"" in black, 18mm"
4.0,"Not bad for an inexpensive plus size dress. The material is somewhat thin, but that is good for warmer weather. The decoration bottom lays rather flat, but there are no obvious flaws in the workmanship. It is a good purchase and worth the money spent. If I am dressing for a more formal affair, I'll shop Lord and Taylors."
4.0,"A bit larger than I like, but they’re nice."
4.0,I saw reviews of people who stones fell off but mine did not and I’ve had them in for about a week now. They are comfortable and look absolutely beautiful
4.0,"I orderd a medium and I'm normally 5/6. They fit perfectly, super comfy. But, I only have 4 stars because I thought they would be darker as pictured. They are light. I'm still keeping them."
4.0,"I really like these huggies earrings, they are cute and come in fun colors, I just wish they came 8n pairs inside of one color per hoop. I still wear them just mix and match."
4.0,they are not premium plastic but are satisfactory for my needs
4.0,though these are bigger than the Pandora bracelet and don't screw on they are quality made thus far.  I'll update the review when I go to have my bracelet cleaned to see how it looks in comparison with the other charms.  you def want to have a chain protector or screw on spacers because they will otherwise just slide off.
4.0,"These cuff links are pretty thin, but are priced just right. The flag isn't as visible as I would like but given the size of this piece I get it.  Also a nice box would have complemented them better than the plastic bags."
4.0,great stones and a lovely color.
4.0,comfortable and simple.
4.0,"I gave this a 4 star due to its compact size. It's perfect for a slim phone, ID, credit cards, and a few pieces of make-up. I think it's well made, super unique and adorable. I will definitely be wearing it when I don't feel like carrying  a purse full of stuff. Hope this helps:)"
4.0,Came as expected. Just not too much support.
4.0,I'm 5'4&#34; and 140.  It's a bit short wasted for me and the sleeves are a little tight but I still like the dress.
4.0,"They look a little silly but they do the job very well.  I was worried about them popping off but they stayed on they whole time, even thorugh gravel and wet grass.  They were made of softer rubber on the top so they didn't damage my shoe.  Once the wedding was over, I was able to pop them off, put them in my purse and head to the reception.  I didn't have to change my shoes.  Great invention!  (Others were a little jealous.)"
4.0,"Nice t-shirt, somewhat thinner than expected."
4.0,Love the dress but too big. I'm 5'6 125lb<br /> I ordered a small
4.0,Easy to use. My dog decided my front hooks on my bras was a great chew toy.
4.0,You get what you paid for.... had them for almost 3 weeks then they broke ;(
4.0,It is good for the price.  The quality is not the best but it is nice compared to its price.
4.0,"Im 5'9&#34; and I ordered an XL of the black 3/4th length sleeve dress. The picture shows the dress as floor length but it hits me about mid-shin. Otherwise a nice fit and dress. Material is pretty thin, mildly see through."
4.0,Nice material but too small.
4.0,"This is a nice watch, and I really like the belts. The only complain is the outer ring is not chrome-shine type, looks a little dull in fact. Overall it is still a good watch to own."
4.0,The clips that hold the mask on are not very strong.
4.0,"Pretty well made for the price, somewhat smaller than expected"
4.0,I really like the style. I would have given it 5 stars but the sleeves are more 3/4 length than long.
4.0,Comfortable light weight true to size
4.0,Great little bracelet for the price.
4.0,"The shirt is fine, but the sizing is off. Ordered a 2XL and it is too small. The size chart(either) were no help."
4.0,"Like the ""jeans"" though they are not as ""jean"" as I thought. They have A LOT of stretch(30%) but do hold their shape well for multiple wearings. They are super long so I had to take off 6 inches. They wear more like a dressy stretch pant, than jeans. They do hug the curves nicely. I've washed them several times and they are doing great but because of the amount of stretchy fabric(?) they get a lot of lint!"
4.0,I'm 5'1. Weight 140. I bought a small. I usually wear a medium. The split is not obvious. I altered it
4.0,Comfy and snug. Like them!
4.0,Quality suede but very thin ( I think the inside of the strap is made of plastic). The hardware is very good quality. In general a good strap and confortable but I think the real price should be $15 USD.  For the price is a good quality strap. If you want something that will last find elsewhere or spend your money on a 50 USD strap.
4.0,Only reason that I deducted a star was that they had been removed and it caused a bit of misshaping. I used hair dryer to try and get the large foldover spot to smooth out and this made it less noticeable. They are very cute and totally comfortable. My go to church Sandle
4.0,Beautiful stylish bag ! My husband loves it!
4.0,"Looks pretty good! Material is kind of thin, will probably only wear this as a swimsuit cover."
4.0,Product works as advertised. Good quality and the price was right. No complaints. If it fails or a problem crops up I will return here and report my findings.<br /><br />I'm back.....Bought another pair for the house. These are the only ones I have found that actually block the UV making everything look clear as a bell. Try them...you will like them.
4.0,"I had to return mine, it wasn't suitable for me<br /><br />Service from the seller - excellent<br />Quality of material - excellent<br />Cut/shape of the product - is too square, it should have been more V shaped<br />The shoulder holes were too small"
4.0,"I love that these glasses are so slim and lightweight. They fit very nicely and don't budge when you shake your head. I have only had them for a few days and so far so good. My concern with these glasses is their long term durability. Since they are so slim, I am worried how they'll hold up to repeated use and general wear and tear. They came very quickly and even came with a carrying case. I wish that the carrying case was also a little more rigid and durable. Overall, I am happy with the style, color and design."
4.0,They are a half bigger than expected bet are great
4.0,This is very adorable and perfect for hanging bows someone crafty could honestly make this but I won’t lie I’m a lazy person and don’t have time for crafts lol
4.0,"Mine also broke right away as many of the other reviewers stated.  As soon as I pulled it out of the box the chain broke. But that is a quick fix and for $3.00 who's complaining?  It looks great, just like in the picture and it's got some weight to it.  The chain is pretty long and I've been hanging it from my rearview mirror without any more issues.  I wouldn't recommend buying it as a gift or wearing it because of it's tendency to fall to bits but I'd definitely buy another one for myself as decoration in the future."
4.0,I will say they are wonderful looking and my granddaughter loves them! She doesn't want to take them off! However I gave them to her yesterday and by the time I got home from her house her mom texted me and the unicorn came off. I thought it just came out of the clog top but it broke off the black peg it was sticking too! It will have to be glued on I guess. I think it shoulda stayed on more than just a few hours.
4.0,"These are soo cute. They feel very cheap but they do not look it. My little sister bought these same necklaces from other sellers for $20 and it was not as pretty as this. All together it is as big as a thumb (about 1.5in) the half moon and pendant move individually but they are attached together to the chain. It comes in a small black jewelery bag, one of them had white letters on it made it look bad but i scratched the letters off with my nail. I gave these to two of my friends and they both loved it."
4.0,Ok so the fit is good for taller people. This is size medium I'm 163lb 5'7 my friend is 160lb 5'10 Pros:<br />It's good breathable. The fit isn't too form fitting which is a win.<br />It fits people with thicker thighs and the prints cute. It also helps hide tummy pug.<br />Cons:<br />The strings are hard to get through the hoops of the outfit. I was able to find a safety pin and push it through.<br />Overall 8 out of 10
4.0,"Beautiful dress! I wore it to a beach wedding and it could be more than perfect. It has a slip underneath that isn't too short, just right.  I received compliments all night!<br /><br />I am 5'4 and a size 18. The length of the dress was good and I wore flats. The chest area is really large. I had to pin it for the wedding of I would have been flashing everyone! Also, the sleeves near the upper arm area are tight in comparison to the chest. Weird sizing. I had to dock a star for that reason only."
4.0,"This is really a pretty piece, but makes me feel like I have on a maternity top.  I ordered large and it is.  I'm a generous size 12 and this is even more so.  The material is light and swingy and I do love it.  I wish I could find more tops like this to cover my tail and not look dowdy."
4.0,"These are gorgeous, heavyweight vests with usable pockets and seem to be well made.  They are just about 2 sizes smaller than US sizes."
4.0,"Fabric is a good weight, not too thin"
4.0,The paternal is really cute.  I ordered a size. To big.  It still doesn’t fit right.  But I’m sure my granddaughter will fit in it soon.
4.0,Awesome shirt. A little smaller (shorter) than the patterned version. Would prefer a little longer.
4.0,"Soft material, cute fit"
4.0,Fits great. The fabric is a litter thinner than I expected but that's ok. Nice and stretchy and comfortably holds your pony.
4.0,I got these as a Christmas gift for my mom and step/dad. They lived them
4.0,"These socks are low and no show, for sure.  There is some rubber stripping on the inside of the heel that keeps the sock from sliding right off your heel, but does still feel strange to be so precariously balanced on your heel.  Also, there is this small yellow strip around the back of the heel that is meant to help it stay in place.  That is totallly fine if I'm wearing these with exercise shoes, but not sure I want yellow peaking out first with my flats.  These are a bit more of an athletic type of sock, so I'm not sure if I would wear them in my more formal work shoes, but they are a nice sock overall Depending on what you plan to use them for, they could work nicely."
4.0,"This dress was very comfortable and constructed well. Wore it all evening to a 1920s themed event. As for the fit, it was prefect. For reference I’m 5’3 and 160lbs and ordered an XL.  One negative was it was shorter than I expected it to be while sitting."
4.0,It's a little larger than I thought it would be but it does hold a lot.
4.0,They are kind of thin so black panties at all times ladies. They are the type that can catch a snag. I am 5ft 1in they are really long.
4.0,Well made and sturdy. We like the pulley/rope in opening the umbrella although a crank is probably better for larger/heavier units.
4.0,Cute and sturdy.  Grandaughter loved them
4.0,I like the color and it's cute on but it does slide off sometimes.
4.0,"I love this dress, not a dress to wave your arms around in when dancing. I used nipple stickers. I decided to see my taylor and have her make the top straps come together. Shaking booty tyoe of dress not salsa."
4.0,Perferc
4.0,The velcro on the back of one pair came off the very first time I used them.  More than one stitch is needed there.
4.0,These are sweet! Great color we chose. Only thing is that one earring is a different thickness than the other (?) not sure why... one is supple and soft and one is thicker and stiffer! Packaging was nice... guard drawstring bag and earrings on paper backing that slid into the bag.
4.0,I really L❤VE this dress!!! As you can see in the picture it fits small. So I usually wear it as a top but it has some stretch & absolutely be worn as a mini dress!
4.0,Nice material. Color fast and fits well. Satisfaction.
4.0,"A few were dead on arrival, but rest work great.  Thanks"
4.0,"The shirt in the pictures looks like it can be worn casual, but its more of a dresser material."
4.0,"This dress is loose, lets the air flow freely, it is perfect for hot summers. I liked it."
4.0,I love the dress but didn't love it on myself is all- no complaints really
4.0,Way to big! Had to reorder 2 sizes smaller.<br />But love the style!
4.0,Doesn’t have inside pockets
4.0,I spent some money getting it tailored but when I did I got SO many compliments.
4.0,"Very cute for an ""UGLY CHRISTMAS DRESS"".  The fit was a size small.  it's a little long so having it hemmed up a bit.  Will wear with leggings.  Nice material!"
4.0,"For the price, not bad. They did arrive with a scratch on one lens, not directly in my vision. One person told me that the glasses are very attractive.<br />I would say the quality of the plastic is not the same as you get for many dollars more, they seem to attract more dust and dirt than my previous regular plastic lens glasses, but the price is right until I have my second cataract removed and can get better eyeware."
4.0,"My son it tall and lean, so pants are hard to find. If want the waist to fit then the pants are too short. If the length is right,t he waist is too big. But with these pants, BOTH the waist and length are perfect! Bought another pair for him black."
4.0,"The colors, oh my goodness, the colors. They certainly make wearing my fit-bit a lot nicer. Now I can change it up without a problem. The bands fit around my fit-bit with no problems. They are a little soft but not too flexible that you would worry about the bit falling out of the wristband. I like that there seems to be a seamless transition from the original wristband to these more colorful ones. I wish they were a little more flexible, but for the 10 you get at the price is a steal! They came super quick and the packaging was very nice. Definitely worth it.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product for free or on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions. However your own opinion might vary.

4.0,"The skirt is nice, giving 4star as it was little longer for my daughter. Okay quality and worth the price. I will alter it at home. It can be worn as western with just a top or indian with top and duputta. I like this skirt."
4.0,"I was looking for a dress for a funeral. I tried this on and it was very cute. I’m also pregnant and it fit very nicely and even made my bump look cute. I ended up not going, so I returned the dress, but do plan on ordering in a different color for work."
4.0,Wish I new the bottoms were plastic before I bought. They are noisy walking on wood floors.
4.0,"I ordered a Medium which is what I usually wear. I have to get my husband to help me zip it, but once it is on it fits decently. It's a little tighter than I'd like but still wearable."
4.0,"I was worried that this would be too ""blousy"" and not flattering to a figure,  but it looks great with jeans to professional skirts-"
4.0,"comfortable and breathable and were worn in high temps! One pair tore at the seam, but otherwise all around good purchase!"
4.0,I thought it might be a little shorter but it works.  I have a bigger bust line so it is a great accessory for these new off the shoulder styles.
4.0,Just like a t-shirt! Comfortable but nothing stylish!
4.0,Copper quickly when worn frequently but for the price it's a good product.
4.0,"The shirts feel great but do run small. Order 1 or 2 sizes bigger. I am 5.5 and 135lbs, 36B and I'm a Med. I ordered the Lrg and it fits right in me. The med would have been tight. I'm going to order the XL so I feel more comfortable wearing outside without an other top over it. Great price."
4.0,Nice quality material that maintained shape.
4.0,They are very cute and love the color.  Very comfortable
4.0,For the price this watch is great and good looking. It’s a bit stiff at first but loosens up over the first few weeks. Recommend if you want to buy a budget watch at a great price.
4.0,"It's a disappointment from my original 3D crystal Merkabah, but it's growing on me cause I don't have to take it off at night. The original fell and a piece cracked off.  I ordered this as a replacement. I found the missing piece days later and glued it back on; looks perfect, fingers good. However, I'm still wearing this little charm which surprisingly never seems to poke me with its metal points."
4.0,The bows fit great on my 6 month old daughter. The fabric is soft and doesn't hurt her head. My only complaint is that the ribbon part on the headbands don't always match the exact color of the bows on some. It looks a little weird on some of the colors. So I just don't use those bows.
4.0,Love it<br />Light weight<br />Very pretty can be used as overnight back carry on diaper bag or just a really nice hand bag
4.0,"great cheap driving sunglasses, the UV protection makes the sunlight easy ony our eyes without killing detail much, although windows on cars look funny because you can see the UV blocking builtinto them  with these glasses"
4.0,It does snag really easily but it isn’t meant to win a beauty contest. It does what it is designed to do and looks good
4.0,"Cute dress, fits well!"
4.0,"Fit and comfort above that of the typical sandal.  Plus the bottle opener could come in handy.  If you reside in a Bluth model home, this will save a few countertops."
4.0,This was a Christmas gift for our hockey playing son-he loves the tie clip and cuff links
4.0,"Fits more like legging than joggers. Material is dreamy. However, mine probably won’t leave my house unless to the gym."
4.0,Like these gloves.  They are perfectperfect for keeping my hands warm while typing in an over-air conditioned office.  My only issue is they tend to fray around end of the fingers.
4.0,"I was excited to receive this in the mail. It looks even nicer in person than on the website. It fit beautifully. But the proof in the pudding is how it behaved on a hike, and there’s a downside to it... if you look closely at the photos of the heel, from the side and the back (magnify it) you will notice that it's curved, like a ball. So that can’t help but you give you some relatively uncontrollable tilt when you’re clambering over rocks and uneven ground. Well, maybe you can control it, but you have to be conscious about it every second, which takes away from your enjoyment of your hike/ walk. After almost losing balance a couple of times, due to there not being a hard, flat surface on my foot to meet the slanted rocks or ground, I decided I would have to return them. The reason I got these to begin with is because I didn’t want to be like most other people and get the Moab 2. I like to be a little different But there is a reason the Moab 2 is such a best seller. So I bought those instead, and the stability is wondrous, and they’re even more comfortable than these."
4.0,I loved it although I didn't get a chance to wear it because it was too big (my reason for not giving it 5 stars). The material was of a nice quality. Not thin or cheap looking. I returned it but will definitely be repurchasing a smaller size.
4.0,"Very nice for dress cloths, nice and warm!"
4.0,"This dress is cute, comfortable, and flattering. I got plenty of wear out of it this summer and it held up nicely in the wash. I’m 5’0 and usually wear a US 6/8 and the medium fits me perfectly. 4 stars instead of 5 because the stripes on the navy dress are black and not navy as expected."
4.0,"We will see how it last, it is really a nice belt"
4.0,"The print on this mini kimono is really cute. It hit me just below the waist. The front tie is convenient for keeping it closed. The sleeve holes are quite generous. I typically wear a L/XL and this provided me with plenty of room. It was both cute and comfortable. It is a looser fitting top, so it's not incredibly flattering on me, but it's a great option as a coverup or to wear layered over a tank top."
4.0,The quality on this boots is great! It looks very expensive & the shinny toe heel is cute! I'm a size 5.5 and this fit like a size 6 ladies.
4.0,"These are stunning.  The size, color, and shape are identical to the product shown in the Amazon listing.<br />The sparkle factor is very high - they shimmer and shine beautifully.<br />The size is exactly as expected.<br /><br />The fit is really great.  The post is a bit longer than the length of traditional earring posts, but only by a few millimeters or so.  Long enough to be nice, without being annoying.<br />The earring ship with a longer and thicker back, but arrive with the traditional earring backs as well.  Options for earring backing is great, backup earring backs are even better!<br /><br />I would love to have given this more stars, but my set seems to have made it through quality control without a thorough review.  One post is bent, to the point where the earring leans downwards when wearing.  The posts are very sturdy, so it has been impossible to bend this back into place.  I will reach out to the seller about replacing it, but I cannot give a full five-star when damaged and defective products can make their way to the buyer.<br /><br />I was given the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted rate, in exchange for my unbiased review.  Based on my experience, with the specific product that I have received, I would recommend this product to family and friends."
4.0,Fits nicely but would have liked it to be a little thicker.
4.0,Good product for the price and excellent delivery time.
4.0,"Its OK, pretty yet its sewed wrong it twist when I walk"
4.0,"I'm between a size 8 and 10... I ordered a size up and bought a large instead of a medium based on some of the reviews. I would've fit in a medium instead of large, but I can just sew it to take it in a bit. I'd say the top is true to size and not too small as some reviews have stated."
4.0,"So it's a decent quality in the dress and tights material, however neither of them fit me exactly. I chose size small and the tights are too tight and the dress is a little big. In American sizes my pants are about a size 3. I'm just petite tho. The tights are the strongest tights/pantyhose I've ever worn and I may wear them with other normal outfits. The earrings are cute and they are clip ons so anyone can wear them, but I may replace the clips with regular earring hooks because my ears are pierced and earring making is a hobby of mine. I don't like the headband it feels cheap, but it's what I paid for and it looks fine. If I can edit this later I'll post a picture of when I'm in full cosplay, wig and all"
4.0,"More of a novelty tie, served it's purpose."
4.0,I loved it! Great design and fits great!! I gave 4 stars just for the fabric. I wish it was cotton or something similar. But I'm more than excited to wear it! It's great
4.0,I love the style of this sweater. ..fit is perfect ....wish the material was a little thicker....Nice item for the price
4.0,"My fiend loves those shades. Wearing all the time , still as good as new, and they fit well."
4.0,Looked just like picture. Order a size up runs small
4.0,"Warm and toasty! My S-I-L loves it!  The vendor is great to work with, very reasonable!"
4.0,My son likes them.  He says they are comfortable and stable and look great.  He can run jump and play at school and still feel comfortable walking the halls.  He says they are great and feel good.
4.0,"Beautiful piece, packaged very nicely but it came missing a stone which wasn't even in the box for me to fix unfortunately so I took away a star for that."
4.0,Material looks nice and fit is perfect!!
4.0,"Love it, this is definitely an elegant choice."
4.0,New Apple Watch
4.0,"Got this as an elephant gift and it was very popular (stolen a few times).  The final recipient vows he will use it, if he can pry it out of his daughter's hands.<br /><br />The material isn't all that soft, but it does feel like it would be warm."
4.0,"I normally wear a medium in underwear and large in everything else. I just like the tighter fit. But these are much smaller than normal underwear. Once I realized this, I looked closer at their size descriptions and realized it was my fault. The max waist size for Medium is 30. My waist is 33. Most brands the Medium size is 32-35 inch waist. So I just assumed.<br /><br />Overall, these are really high quality and should be very comfortable. Just make sure you look at the size chart closely before ordering."
4.0,Great Watch but it does slip out of various links so we are putting in back together often. Great price though so it's hard to complain about things. This is more information than anything. If you have large wrists this won't be for you. Fits my daughter's wrist really well but mine it's almost too tight. My wrists are average size I think so I was surprised but I still wear it because it's super cute:)
4.0,"I adore these they are super cute and girly. I have hard time finding right length for me being tall. These leggings/yoga pants hit above ankle bone, but seem long enough. That's a big deal for me anyway. Very thick material so not a very stretchy material. I machine washed cold delicates line dried after stepping evenly on each leg and pulling vertically on top of pants to make little longer. Features four way stretch across waist band. Hidden pocket on waist as well. Floral pattern material is: 87% nylon 13% Spandex. Black part material: 87% Supplex 13% Lycra. It has a second-skin fit and feel and sculpts and smooths. Flatlock seams to reduce chafing. Side pockets. Lined gusset. Thick quality material, flawless stitching. Price is high for me though"
4.0,"Super cute, but you need someone to help you tie the bows so they sit right.. also it is on the shorter side and boxy just like the picture"
4.0,I bought this for my girlfriend and she really likes it but the size was a little off. Overall very good quality product
4.0,"Fast shipping! Very cute to, just wish there was a tag in the back. Took me putting it on backwards to figure out which side was the front 🤣🤣"
4.0,"Um 6' tall, so I wish they offered a tall length.  But it's gorgeous and flowy and I love it"
4.0,"Love this bracelet and get tons of compliments. My only complaint is it is too big as I have very tiny wrists so I can't wear it as I want to, but I still wear it every day and love it so much. Pretty colors, words are inspiring, everyone who sees it definitely falls in love too."
4.0,"I love every set of earrings I get from Modogirl. It's hard to find comfortable clip-on earrings, but these were pretty much perfect."
4.0,my granddaughter kept pulling the top up. she never complained but i saw her continually pulling the top upward.
4.0,It fits perfect but I have big breast so it needs a pin between the first two buttons
4.0,Runs small - I'm a size 7
4.0,buy bigger size to compensate for support insert
4.0,Dress is smaller than stated.I usually wear a L but ordered xl  because I prefer loose fitting.The dress felt very snug.
4.0,They're cute and comfortable. You have to like boy shorts though.
4.0,"I used these charms on jewelry and have no real complaints other than don't be surprised at how light weight they are. Not so thin they will bend, but they are very very light."
4.0,"I bought three of this exact sports bra. Two red/black and one blue/black. The red ones fit perfectly, are quite cute looking too, but had different clasps on the back. The blue one fit but the under panel was a bit puffed up behind the crossover outer part and didn't look as nice as the red ones."
4.0,"Just as expected, very easy to make your own custom size belt."
4.0,"Wore this dress with a small crinoline to give the skirt extra swing.  Small fit well (I am 5 foot, 114 lbs.)  Super flattering.  Nice material and color.  I got lots of compliments."
4.0,"Cute but if you want this for the fall then it's probably not warm enough, the material is thin"
4.0,"Looks like the picture- does not feel like soft cotton. It not stretchy at all. Sleeves are slightly long. Nightgown would need to be pressed to remove wrinkles, fabric is rough, not soft, or stretchy. The place where the decoration is placed around the neck is irritating and causes the throat to itch when it rubs the skin. Does not have a flattering fit. Basically, like wearing a potato sack. But I only need it for that few minutes from the time I take a bath time I go to my room.it will work for that. It has good coverage. Not see. Through. Falls below the knees. Covers the chest. Good for when you live with roommates or want to maintain modesty. If it has soft fabric and some give I’d like it much better. Without those two, I might have to use it until I can find something better. Best to you!"
4.0,I'd been looking for surgical steel earrings in color forever. I wear the black and blue everyday. Comfortable to sleep in. Very happy. Would have given 5 stars but the silver and gold are too shiny. Cheesy
4.0,"I have been a faithful customer of Hanes for a very long time. The price for the value one receives in this item is exceptional.<br /><br />These particular briefs are unbelievably comfortable especially when Ballroom Dancing. The material is extremely soft. As a result, when dips or any other type of extreme dance moves, especially with a larger person occur, this underwear will always provide comfort, without losing its' shape. Comfort is the key word in this evaluation. in fact I would say that these briefs will afford any person a new found respect for the type of material used in these briefs.<br /><br />Without question that from an athletic point of view, they are very comfortable with any movements, and could easily be used in most sports including baseball, football, and basketball. As an aside I wear these when I play the position of catcher in a nine inning semi pro baseball game!<br /><br />You will not regret purchasing this item especially at this low price."
4.0,I got 2 sizes bigger due to not being sure if it would run small... It was a little big but exactly what I needed. The only issue I would say it the area for the boobs don't line up
4.0,The post is a little thick.  So if you have tiny piercings they won’t go in.  Super cute!
4.0,Soft fabric and falls well on. I will enjoy using this as a light cover.
4.0,"Came a week early, but when they say it comes small,. THEY REALLY MEAN IT! I got a 32 A bc I am that in Victorias Secret, but it was WAY too small. Also, I have an athletic build with TINY hips and the underwear was too small -_- Its still wearable tho"
4.0,"Cute outfit, great colours and designs, pants just a bit small."
4.0,"Really cute.  I just have fat calves and short legs so they're a bit tight and a bit long, but still very cute."
4.0,"I ordered the brown/tan pair of leggings and they are a tad see through, but would do good  under a long shirt, sweater or dress. They are kind of a thinner slick material and have a wide elastic at the top to help keep them up better. There is only one pocket on the right side of the pants which I wasn’t expecting, but fits my phone just fine. I’m 5’10” 140lbs and ordered a size small and they fit just a little big on me, but they are long enough which is saying something. Overall for the price I think these are great leggings."
4.0,The dress runs extremely large. I ordered a large because I'm a size 12/14. A medium would have been better. I decided to keep it since it's specifically to go over my bathing suit and just tie it in a knot
4.0,"I really like this top, but it ran a little small, so I don't wear it very offten."
4.0,"Make sure to read the reviews/size chart. These feel great! They do slip and slide down. They also create a pooch in the front due to the stitching but overall, I love them!"
4.0,Cute and comfy boot. Chunky heel is bit loud on hardwood and tile floors. Do not attempt to unzip the decorative gold zipper. It does not zip back easily.
4.0,They are ok.  But they dont last  My daughter uses them to work in the cooler at a local grocery store.  Perfect size & weight but she wears holes  in them in about 3 weeks. I will have to keep looking.
4.0,They do what they're supposed to do look nice
4.0,They are pretty but a little heavy and bigger than I expected. At this price I am going to keep them. Got the clear and pink set.
4.0,work very well to dampen the sound of 12 gauge shotgun
4.0,Round labradorite beads  a  bit too gray for me- only a few blue flashes(3) in all the beads.  Charged with some labradorite friends and with your & my  own selenite-- seems a bit better. All in all I love labradorite.. worth the money.  I was disappointed also-- no free present like the apache tears mentioned so often in the reviews.  Thank you!
4.0,"I think this blouse is just okay... it is very loose. I think it fits larger on me. So I am not sure if i like it. Good material, it’s soft and comfy but I am not very impressed with the way it looks on me."
4.0,"I love it but I was expecting it to shrink since it's 100% cotton. Sizes seem to be true to fit without shrinking. Having known this at at size 6 34DD, I would have went with a medium. All in all, great product, well made and would buy again but to my true size."
4.0,"Love the earrings, very comfortable and look good. Would have liked a little bit thicker posts to make them a little more authentic looking, but they are so comfortable that it is ok👌"
4.0,I love this dress and is perfect for the summer. The only downfall I have is that because it is a lighter fabric I ordered a large instead of my normal medium because I am bigger chested and it is still see through.
4.0,"I will stick to simple dresses , the ruffles were to complicated for this old gal to figure out :)"
4.0,"Based on the other reviews left for this product, I really wasn't expecting much. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I received my knitted hat in the mail. Some of the other reviews mentioned that it looked like a Santa hat and I can see where that was coming from, but just because of the fur rim being a staple of Santa's cap. I got the black color, though, so that really wasn't an issue for me. If you ordered the red color, it might look similar to a Santa hat.<br /><br />As far as the quality goes, some of the fur does fall out, but if you brush the loose hairs out right when you get the product, then it shouldn't be an issue because the hairs that were going to fall out will already be gone. The fur is nice for faux fur and does not have a super plastic-y look or feel.<br /><br />As far as the size goes, I did stretch the rim out a little bit to cater more towards the size and shape of my head. After I did this, I don't have any trouble with the hat falling off my head. It seems to fit pretty snugly and hasn't fallen off my head once since I got it.<br /><br />When it comes down to it, this hat does its job --- it keeps your head warm! This cap is great for those winter days, especially when you want something a little warmer and neutral. I find that the black color goes with everything and is easy to match with everything that I wear. The hat is comfortable and stylish. I live in Colorado, so this hat will definitely be getting some use, especially until we start to see Spring in late march and early April. Overall I am satisfied with this item, especially for the low price! I received a discount on this item in exchange for an honest and unbiased review of the product."
4.0,The dress is super cute and fit as expected. The bottom is just tulle and needs steamed
4.0,"Arrival time great, product as expected"
4.0,"The Sandals are good as expected, but my question is how is it that a purchased it for 19.99 and the price tag says 16.99?"
4.0,"I love this skirt.  So soft and flowy, perfect length, love that it has a thank n built in slip.  The only problem is this skirt runs very small in the waist.  I normally wear a small or medium and bought the large in this skirt and it's still tight in the waist.  It's not uncomfortably tight so I wear it, but it does have to be worn higher on my waist.  I'm considering ordering another in different pattern/color, but will order XL next time."
4.0,"Super cute dress, nice material.  It rides up a little but I am larger on top. Wore it to a wedding with a cardigan."
4.0,"Good standard, simple, easy to use wristwatch, a real find in the midst of watches which are depressingly expensive and claim to do and show everything that you do not need.  It is easy to set, the face is simple and uncluttered, and it is a great buy."
4.0,"I loved the fit of my new romper. The waist fits a little low, but thats just fine.  All in all, great value, comfort and style, all good."
4.0,"Purchased this for my 5 yr. Old daughter. She loves it, and I like it too. Looks nice in person and fits her pandora bracelet nicely."
4.0,"These are so wonderful looking, and I get lots of compliments and comments (&#34;those are fun&#34;).  BUT, for whatever reason, they seem to slide off my nose a bit.  They at least double as an awesome headband lol."
4.0,"Not the highest quality but definitely cute for a teen/tween.  These were a Christmas gift for my 12 year old, and she loves them.  They are lightweight so do not tug on the earlobes.  So far the stones have stayed in place."
4.0,It's super cute. The only negative is that the torso/mid section could be a little longer. It fit a little snug in the private region. Also the bust could have a little better support but I think that would be for any halter top. The bust was a little too loose and I would have liked it to be more snug and close to the body to keep my bust up. My breasts kind of just fell out of the cups. But other than that it is a great suit.
4.0,"Looks just as pictured. One of the feathers broke off at the tip upon arrival and one feather fell out so I had to glue back and make sure that the rest is secured before using it. For the price it's not bad at all. I would recommend but be cautious since festers are delicate you may have to tape, glue or sew some parts back on as I did. I don't like that it fits around my head like a cap so I plan to remove that and sew strings to tie it around my head instead. For $20 it's not bad at all....just don't let little kids near it due to its delicate nature!"
4.0,I got a medium size I'm 5 5 and 160 pounds and I guess I should've got a xl
4.0,"I'm a size 10-12, and this suit actually fits, and even looks nice!  The skirt is longer than I expected, but it still will work as a swimsuit.  The seller said it could be worn as a dress- I, personally, wouldn't go that far! But I like that it has such nice coverage.  If I had my choice, I would prefer that the back wasn't so high, but other than that, the fit is good. My only complaint is that the padding in the bra top slides around.,- easily fixable, since there is an opening to reach it.  I may actually tack it in place with a couple hidden stitches.  I recieved this product at a discount in return for an honest review, and can honestly say that I would happily buy it again."
4.0,runs a little big in my opinion...I would have ordered a size down had I known. very pretty and versatile
4.0,Cute earring. Thought it would be redder but its a little on the pink side. Still nice
4.0,"It's a really beautiful dress, however the bust was a bit smaller than expected. I had a bad case of forced flat chest. The dress fit perfectly otherwise. Had to return it due to the bust issue."
4.0,"Fits well, nice colors, decent price, fast delivery...definitely would purchase again. You may need to run a quick iron over though.."
4.0,Great for wearing with leggings. A perfect addition to my holiday and winter wardrobe. I’m a size 12-14 and the large fit well.
4.0,"I liked the look and feel of the dress, and the fabric was high quality, but this dress was way too small on me. I gave it to my younger sister who is two sizes smaller and it fit her as expected. Would take this into consideration before buying this dress."
4.0,Able to see to read while using these. Have only had them a few days so will see iff they hold up.
4.0,Lovely dress size is right on my daughter looked beautiful in it
4.0,"This is my second shirt.  Colors are spot on.  These are a mid length shirt.  Maybe not long enough for leggings but plenty long enough with jeans.  Can be tied at the waist, tucked or worn out.  Just big enough but not oversized.  I would say True to size.  I am 5’7”<br />Approx 156 lbs and a large is perfect.  I’m not real chesty so I have plenty of room buttoned.  If you are bigger than a c cup I would say order up."
4.0,"It was nice and had potential, but to go out in public in a swimsuit I need it to be perfect. I returned it, though it might work beautifully on a different body shape."
4.0,These shoes ran very small. Glad the price was so low. Turns out they made a good Christmas gift. I bought 13's should have bought 14's.
4.0,Cute band. Feels nice. Color is lighter than expected.
4.0,"Pretty necklace, but the heart is so small you can barely see it."
4.0,"Wore this for part of my Halloween costume. It's cute, but kept coming off my hair at some points during the night."
4.0,"Love these earrings!!! Super fun and quite. I wear them to work and get SO many compliments. The only downside if they’re bigger than I expected so they’re a little heavy. I also have very sensitive skin and react to the metals in these earrings, but I just deal with the pain lol cuteness outweighs slight discomfort 🤷🏻‍♀️"
4.0,This top is cute
4.0,It’s very elegant. It’s very thin. Tangled easily but able to detangle. I love it.
4.0,"The chain is beautiful and strong. I wear it 24/7 with a pendant attached and it is sturdy. The only issue I can find with this chain is upon arrival the chain had several knots in it due to shipping. It is a petite chain so I was worried that it would break while trying to unknot it, but it proved to be very sturdy and is stunning."
4.0,It holds a lot of products.  I may need a bigger one in the future.  I tend to carry a lot with me when I travel.  I definitely like that it has many different pockets that are see through.
4.0,Very nice watch - has been working well for me - love the colors - wish the band was a little wider.
4.0,"Dress is very comfortable to wear. I slightly bigger than I expected but size small I felt would be a little snug. I was going to send it back, but it is so comfortable that I decided to keep it even though it is slightly big. I did order another dress but the colors are nothing like on line, the black and white is fine, but watch if you are ordering colors."
4.0,"This dress was a welcome change for a nursing momma. The fabric is a little see through on the bottom part of the dress, but was pretty forgiving with hiding the post baby tummy. The top is very comfortable and a cotton stretch material.  I would not say it is as easy to nurse in the dress as others but you can make it work. The fabric stretches enough to allow this. Note this is somewhat low cut so either wear a tank or flaunt it! This dress can be worn for both a nursing dress and a regular dress!"
4.0,Love these. They fit right and look exactly like the picture. Only problem is that they offer no support.
4.0,"I am a 40 ddd and it fits well. It is soft and comfortable and wonderful for around the house and occasional errands. I had hoped it would be a bit more supportive, however it does exactly what i needed it to do. I purchased it to be a soft bra to comfortably wear at home. It does not pull at the shoulders which is so amazing! It would definitely not be supportive for working out, but I am happy with my purchase. The liner cups do tend to fold on me, but can be easily fixed."
4.0,Great shirt - was different material than expected
4.0,"Overall a decent bandanna, The printing worries me that it may rub off after extended wear under a helmet or other object.  Cotton has a standard rough but soft feel.  It is worth noting that the print is not all over the bandanna like the photo, the one i received has about an inch of plain black border around the edges, this didn't really bother me.  It is slightly small on my head but that may be because my head is kind of big."
4.0,It fits nicely and has a nice feel to it. I just wish the pockets weren't partially sewn shut as I had to carefully snip the threads so I could open the pockets correctly. Snipping it didn't affect the pockets nor the jacket in any negative way.
4.0,"I don’t have any good pictures before I lost them lol, but it’s exactly like the picture. They come a bit crooked so you have to bend the frames into place to fit your face but that’s expected with cheap wire frames. Used these for a matching prom theme worked perfectly for the purpose!"
4.0,I really like this case. I'm obsessed with it. I love watching the sparkles and stars move around. It's a great case but it doesn't cover the front which is what worries me. But I love it non the less.
4.0,"Hair and dust sticks at the bottom, very static. If you wear it for long hours, probably not good for your ankle."
4.0,Prefer better material.
4.0,"Over all its a good mask. The light works great and it fits great. My only complaints are that the glue was not set very well on the left part of the light strip or where the wiring comes down from the right ear, and the head band is not easy to set up. Would reccomend using a different band. Other than than that it looks and feel great."
4.0,"I've bought a couple of ratchet belts from other vendors as well, and although this one is a little flimsier than those, it is very attractive and well worth the price I paid."
4.0,Great purse for my daughter! Fringe was all straight and looks like high quality
4.0,Cute outfit. Fits looser then expected. Shirt rises up when I pick up baby. I bought it for my baby to wear on Valentine's Day but it's not holiday specific so he'll get more use out of it.
4.0,Cute dress but if you have any sort of chest it will feel tight up top. I'm a B cup and this squishes my boobs.
4.0,They fit but not as much room as other brands.
4.0,This is a preset shirt. I got it for $10 so it was worth the price. It runs a bit large and is long enough to cover my bit. I am 5’10 185 and purchase the xl but could’ve gone with the large. The only complaint is that the chest part bunches kind of weird. The color is really nice and it is comfortable.
4.0,Darker than I expected but have bought a cute too to match it and wear them with jeans and a pair of heels that match it perfectly. So it all worked out.
4.0,Neck line looks slightly twisted
4.0,"Overall, I really like this shirt. It fits and drapes very well.  It doesn't cling to your less desirable ""curves"" and is a pretty color. The fabric is very soft and thin but surprisingly, it doesn't feel like ""cheap"" thin. It's just thinner than expected (you can't see through it though).  The only issue I have is that it is kind of low cut - as in, not work appropriate low cut.  It definitely reveals too much when bending over or when it slides down. I am only 5' feet tall so maybe that helps create the issue?  With a navy tank top, sports bra or fabric inset right there, it will be wonderful.  I would order more of these."
4.0,Cute but larger than I thought they would be
4.0,Hood material and good fit
4.0,It is somewhen large on me but i can make it work. Love the way it feels on. Very nice
4.0,"Don’t like the fact that it seemed like it was just thrown into the mailing packet, but it’s cute"
4.0,"My boy looks very cute in it. As it is little big, I should keep the pants until he grows.<br />Material is soft and T-shirt is very cute."
4.0,"Finally a ""cotton"" shirt imported from China that is actually made of cotton! I can't tell you how many t-shirts I have ordered over the years from Amazon that say they are cotton in the product information page, they even come labeled as being cotton, but they look and feel like a silky athletic shirt and are quite flammable. Not the case here! It says 95% cotton 5% polyester and that is actually what it looks and feels like, it is soft and breathable on your skin. The graphic is super cute and so far has held up well to washing! I washed it inside out in cold water and hung it to dry. There was minimal shrinkage, no pilling, all seams and hems held fast.  My only complaint is the fit. It is cut short and wide and the neck is kinda high. I am fussy about things on my neck and this hits me kinda oddly, I keep pulling at it. It's not tight, just too high for my liking. All in all, I like the graphic and I am very happy with the fabric, it's just the cut of the neck I do not care for.  For reference, I am 5'4 150lbs 36b and in the picture I am wearing a size large that has already been washed and dried."
4.0,This hat is very cute. I like it
4.0,My 8 yr old son loves them and is happy to have a quick on/off waterproof shoe for summer and the airport!
4.0,"I quite like these sunglasses. They have a nice heavier feel to them, and I love the shape. I like the coloring of the lenses except that they make my phone screen look really strange. I dropped a star because even though I like the glasses, I think they're a bit overpriced. I would expect them to be $10-12."
4.0,"Up super close these look and feel cheap, but they are actually strong and don't look too bad for  a dual wear.  Very nice for the price"
4.0,"These HOMEHOT Men's Moccasin Slippers are pretty nice so far. They fit well and are comfortable. I worry that the material will wear quickly eventually, but, right now they are perfect and very warm and comfy."
4.0,"The antler necklace is cute enough, but looks a bit stiff where it meets the necklace, so sometimes it connects at a bit of a weird angle. It's about right for a necklace costing $5, but probably not worth the current price of $14 on Amazon"
4.0,"This is a lovely and well made short-sleeved shawl type sweater. It however is designed for someone with much skinnier arms than me (and I'm petite but with muscular arms). It fits fairly well across the bust area, even with me being well endowed, but it's uncomfortable on my arms, which makes it unpleasant to wear. The quality is absolutely lovely, though, and I will be giving it to a friend. The &#34;one size fits most&#34; is pretty generous, actually, as I'm used to rarely being able to fit into those due to my bust. If you have skinny upper arms, this will fit you great!<br /><br />I received this at a discount in exchange for my review."
4.0,"it is an attractive bra with a large band, it has a water filling with unexplained loose beads in it. Not that you feel them on your skin, but odd"
4.0,Fits about the same size as my boot size.<br />Great for using at the gym showers or any public shower.<br /><br />Only annoying thing is that the notch between your big toe and your middle toe on the Sandle is a bit of a discomfort.
4.0,Muy bonito pero necesita ajustador para el cuello
4.0,The watch is very nice. Good quality.
4.0,"Hate the fact that some rings are rusted but it is a very nice piece of armor and quite heavy.will probably return-due to the aforementioned rust.<br />I am 5'7"" 142 lbs and 40 chest and it just about fits. anyone bigger, I think will have a tough time fitting in this piece.<br />Update: I got an exchange from Amazon-fairly quick-and  it's great not a rusty link in sight!...actually good value for the money,can't wait to wear it at the Ren.Faire"
4.0,Came a little small
4.0,"Look very nice. I wear them at work and they are comfortable, though I wish these ran in half sizes. I need a 12.5 and I'm wearing a 13."
4.0,The only dissatisfaction is that the clips are very small in their ability to accept the size of the waist.
4.0,"This product is easy to use with a nice pump mist and pleasant scent.  It's not like other cleaners where you have to open all the windows, etc.  You don't need very much.  I just spray onto my boots and wipe with a towel.  I can tell that this bottle will last me a little while."
4.0,"Not slip on, but good pair of shoes"
4.0,I like the sports bras. The colors are great. I gave it four stars because it did not have a good stretch.
4.0,"nicely made, like the roll up sleeves"
4.0,"I like it. I buy for my daughter, she love it. Take long to get it, when I open it, the dress have a hole. Look like who sew it doesn't attention."
4.0,Tight in tummy!!!
4.0,"I like this pendant a lot. It's got good heft and the leaves look exactly as they do in the photo. The leather necklace is a little difficult to adjust, but I think with time I'll get the hang of it and be able to do it quickly. Overall very pleased."
4.0,"This dress was really nice. The material was not very thin which was surprising since the dress was such a low cost. I'm 5'2 195 pounds, small waist, this hips and butt, small at top. I ordered a large at first but sent it back for the xl, the reason being is that I wanted to wear the dress to church and though the large fit me it's really revealing and tight. So if you want to wear this dress to work or church I would recommend going a size up. I'm very happy with this purchase."
4.0,"The hat was nice and packaged well. However,  the hat is a little snug."
4.0,"It's a little big, but she's a little small.  This is the go-to swimsuit now."
4.0,"I love the fit of this dress, the style is beautiful, the material is comfortable and not see through. I own three of these dresses now. Everything is perfect except one thing... the colors are way off.<br />The color is not a big deal for me, but if you're ordering for the color then I would advise not to."
4.0,"The color is right on. And I love it. I'm going to buy my daughter one for Christmas. The fit was a little off. I sould have ordered a smaller size. That was my fault though. I ordered a xl, but a large would have been fine."
4.0,Too small; good quality
4.0,I got this top  in blue. It’s a pretty shade. It is nice and soft on.  I do like this top but it run a bit small.
4.0,I love it...but it's too small
4.0,"Nice robe and great for the price! I ordered this to wear in the hospital after i have my daughter, so i ordered the larger size to accommodate my large belly, but it is definitely much bigger than i expected it to be! But it will otherwise serve its purpose!"
4.0,"Right out of the box they're smooth & soft to the touch, breathable, and fit as expected."
4.0,"The shirt is so cute, it’s made really well, it came in very quickly"
4.0,Very soft. Only complaint is that it takes up too much room in my travel backpack
4.0,"Wonderful bag. I needed something big, but that wasn't very structured. This is perfect, and I may buy in a different color!"
4.0,"however it doesn’t actually cover all and protect all of the eye, at least for me the entire shield is gapped away from the surface of my eyes. even after putting the glasses on best i can, there’s space between glasses and skin"
4.0,It was what I expected.  Gaiter mask with the shark face
4.0,Fits well in my pocket and has a clear I'd holder
4.0,Saucony is a great shoe but they typically run small. This one is no exception.
4.0,"Cute dress! The material is OK but not terrible. I like the style. I think it needs some kind of belts though. It would be nicer on someone with a smaller waist. I have a very straight figure so it doesn’t really look that great on me but the style is really cute and also has a very awkward long string for the neckline so you don’t know whether to put it in a bow or just have it hang there. Overall it’s cute though! I ordered a medium and that is my usual size and it fits fine. I’m 5’6” tall, 145 pounds, 34B chest. It’s also a good length and not too short. Blue/Gray color is pretty!"
4.0,"I'm used to bigger wallets than this, so it makes me do a double-take because it's not hiding stuff. It is easier to find items because it's less complicated. The color is exactly like the photo. I don't like the writing on the outside."
4.0,It's a great suit but wished it had more support for my large bustline.  I can still wear it but like a little more support.  Beautiful colors.
4.0,"Good quality and good price, super cute. :)"
4.0,Metal clips locks tight but it digs into my wrist a little. This could be use some improvement for better comfort. Leather feels good though.
4.0,"It's good quality just make sure to get a size up (American size up) from what you usually are. I am an American small, so I got an American medium and it is still a little tight in the shoulders. (5'8&#34; 120 pounds)"
4.0,Ordered a size smaller (Large) and it’s still a tad bit big on me but still good 🙂
4.0,"I would have given this a 5 star but it was a tad bit tight in the arms and across the chest.  I'm 5'5"", 174 lbs and ordered a Xlarge.  Guess I should have went with the 2X.  Ill make it work.  I need to drop a couple of pounds anyway"
4.0,Seems to be put together well but just got it so time will tell whether it actually holds up or not.
4.0,"This is the same boa  that I could have picked up at a Hobby Lobby craft store for half the price. I actually went and did just that to have a fuller look for my costume. However, the product here is nice and full for a regular boa. The feathers held up well."
4.0,Its not chain its a golden thread which I did not like it
4.0,"I used this product for a Juneteenth celebration. I absolutely loved this outfit for my daughter, I just wish the straps for the arms were not pre tied because it kept falling down off of my daughters shoulders. This is not a deal breaker but I also wish the headband was pre tied. Other than that I loved it and I would order it again if I didn’t have it already"
4.0,These were backup earrings for a wedding. Haven't worn them but have gotten tons of compliments from those that have seen them.
4.0,"The product is good<br />I didn’t like the assortment, different than what was picked"
4.0,"Nice product, except some if the seams weren't sewn straight. Not a fan of crooked seams."
4.0,"This is a well made watch from Grand Seiko. Handsome polishing and attention to detail is what you would expect from GS. But be very careful here, this watch is only 40.5mm in diameter BUT the dial is 35mm making this watch look like is a 43-45mm watch. It is alot bigger than what the numbers tell you. If you’re looking for a sporty look then its fine but to think this could be a dress watch might not work. I would discripe this watch as like a sports sedan.<br /><br />The bads: the polishing is nice but easy to scratch. Also the bracelet has no micro adjustment. Nothing at all! You only have a few smaller links and thats it...what!??! You would expect a $4k watch to have at least a few micro adjust at the clasp...nothing! All that being said, I got it to fit on my 6.5inch wrist perfectly but I will need to put in an additional link in the hot summer days which takes more work without any micro adjustments."
4.0,Adorable pair of sandals. The leather in these is so soft and the cherry design is well stitched and placed. Unfortunately I received 3 sizes too big for my daughter to currently wear these so I can’t comment on wear yet. I do like that they have large divers in the bottom of the sole to allow for traction and not to slip around.<br /><br />Holding these up to other pairs of the same size it seems like these might be a little shorter from toe to heel so I would recommend a size up. Also the strap to secure does not have much Velcro so it only allows it to be tightened or lose Ed so far which depending on how skinny your child’s foot is may be a problem.<br /><br />Otherwise these are a great shoe and I’m sad I have to wait a few more summers for my daughter to wear them.
4.0,This pendent is very nice but super thin and light. Other than that I really like it.
4.0,"I love this product, in fact have ordered more in different colors. Feel free to order a couple of sizes down as it runs very large."
4.0,Runs a little small. I would order 1 size up.
4.0,Quality was not quite as expected
4.0,I bought this as a gift for my father-in-law. He's retired Navy. He seemed to love it. It seemed really well made and I loved that the emblem was embroidered.
4.0,This is very cute.  It fits as expected.
4.0,I've bought 3 pairs of the Nurse Mates shoes for my clinical rotations. I'm about to finish nursing school and I will ALWAYS wear compression socks when I'm on the floor from now on. These have saved me when I haven't been able to sit for 8 hours or more. I also always get compliments on my socks. Everyone thinks they're really fun!
4.0,"Ring fit great. Super cute, I love it."
4.0,"Fits well if you order slightly bigger so it can be flowy as intended. I will make slight modifications: the slits come up quite high on the thigh and I will see them up a bit, and the buttons on front look cheap so I will replace with less noticeable ones. Other than that, quite happy with my purchase."
4.0,Looks good on granddaughter but was supposed to be mine
4.0,"Cute socks that will go with baby's tuxedo onesie for wedding. Would have been 5 stars if just a little less in price.<br />Arrived in expected time frame, packaged well."
4.0,"I ordered this in size twelve even though I mesured 10 by their chart because so many reviews said order up a size. I should have went by their (ever pretty’s ) measurements. It was too big, especially in the bust and I’m returning it. The padding seemed to be a little bunched too. But I thought it was quite nice for the price and I  plan on reordering in the right size."
4.0,This scarf is really soft and such a pretty design. I like that the material is not too thick. It is such a large square that it is a lot of material around my neck and I feel that it is just too much and not very comfortable. I would like it so much better if it didn't bulk up around me neck. It is actually better as a wrap since it is so large.
4.0,Cheapest quality watch on the market
4.0,Got them for my boyfriend and he loved them!
4.0,Good caps!  Fits perfectly!😃
4.0,The onesie is too large for the size and fits very loose. The pants are better quality and fit as they should. The head bands are huge and will never fit the age it was bought for. My 9 month old still does not fit the headband and the pants are now too small on her. The onesie and the headband if compared to each other do not even come close to being the same size. The headband will fit a 2 year old.
4.0,Ok I like it.  Looks like photo.  Could be longer but nice.
4.0,"would have been perfect except the hip area has too much fabric for me.. I read the reviews and ordered a 12 because I didn't want it skin tight.. I'm a normal 8 or 10 in dresses in most brands, but I have narrow hips, fuller chest. I didn't fill out the hip area, and it looked a bit frumpy. May return for smaller size; I could probably shrink it because there is some cotton, but it says no dryer. could be very flattering if you fill it out."
4.0,This is a very cute set and my kids enjoy playing with it. Everything fits well and they love the pockets on the apron. I wasn't anticipating the fabric type that was the only thing that I wasn't thrilled with :-)
4.0,They took forevvvvvveer to get here (from China during COVID19) but finally came yesterday. Fit great on my chubby foot baby. One of the eyes already came off but luckily we found in and superglued it back on. 15m old thinks they’re fun and they seem comfy. Glad they got here while they still fit!
4.0,"Nice little necklace, comes in nice package, with gift bag. Has a little gift card , pretty cute."
4.0,"Awesome price, yet beautiful.<br />It is platinum plated. Does not look really cheap.<br />It looks ok. Fits well, and great as a gift deal..!<br />glad I got this for my mom."
4.0,"I really like it, but wish it would have come with a wrist strap as well as the shoulder one."
4.0,I was very pleased with this product and the amount of time it was delivered! I will be buying more!!
4.0,"Good product.<br />Little big which I dont mind.<br />But the velcro started falling apart in one month, not heavy use."
4.0,What I expected if my 99 yo Mom will use it
4.0,It's a very pretty red.  Seems to be nice leather and holds plenty of cards but the change falls out every time you open it. I don't know if the blocking aspect works or not.  How does one check on that.  Nice size but because of the change falling out I gave it 4 stars.
4.0,Great looking polo for any Arsenal supporter.
4.0,"My kid liked them initially, they look exactly like daddy's sandals! It took him a bit to get used the them since they're not like the cheap flat flip flops. He did like them but after wearing them for a couple hours, he wanted to take them off. He said they hurt is feet and left red marks. The length of the sandals were fine but they fit tight, especially since my guy has chubby little feet. Should have ordered a size up."
4.0,"The flag embroidery is very nicely done. I wear a size large and ordered this in a large but it fits like a medium meaning it is VERY tight.  Wanted it for a party on the 4th so didn't have time to reorder. I wet it and stretched the shit out it which provided little benefit, still very tight. I wore it anyway, good thing I have an athletically toned body because it would not have been pretty if it was fat stuffed in that shirt. I will likely buy one again next year because it looks good but I will order a size up because if necessary, it's probably easier to shrink a little because, as I found out, it will not stretch."
4.0,I loved everything about my ankle bracelet.
4.0,Bought this nightgown for winter evenings. It is soft and comfortable to wear.  I tend to be warm even in the house in the winter so I appreciate the shorter sleeves.  The tie gives the nightgown a shape. I don’t feel like I am wearing a tent or muumuu.  The length is graceful and fluid.  Machine washes well in cool water
4.0,As described. More see-through than I had expected
4.0,"The product it is lightweight, comfortable, non-binding, easily adjusts for waist size, can be comfortably worn either against your skin or over a light weight shirt. Either way you sweat! I wear my waist trimmer to cut the grass, tend my garden and at the gym. When I took the waist trimmer off I could see and feel the moisture. No rash, no itching: just comfortable. Easy to use and is adjustable for many sizes. It has a rubber padding inside and does not slip while you are doing your daily routine. The fact about waist trimming belts is that it not only helps to compress the abdominal area, but also promotes increased blood circulation which has a direct effect on metabolism."
4.0,Very pretty but even though same size I ordered but fit is tight.
4.0,It was okay just small the fur wasn’t the best but I would have kept it if the sleeves weren’t  so short .
4.0,Bracelet was lovely but the ring is tiny
4.0,"this item is cute for costumes, which is what i bought it for but it is suuuper tight. I have a pretty long torso, so for bodysuits I usually get larger sizes and this one still did not fit very comfortable. The only thing that allowed me to put it on somewhat properly is the fact that it is a halter top that is adjustable."
4.0,Love the shades just wish the lens were a little bigger!
4.0,"Easy roll wheels, zippers are smooth, they held up well through a round trip from Texas to Phoenix and we really packed them full. The plastic shell is not quite as durable as I would like, but for the price, a great deal, and when one was dented at the corner, my husband was able to pop it back out, but you can see where it was dented."
4.0,"Love these. The top strap is a little awkward, but once i wore them a few times, they have become a fave!"
4.0,The bars break off on some of them
4.0,"These were for my son and they fit great. He seems to really like them and they look awesome on him. They got here quickly, seem to be holding up really well and are easy to clean. I will definitely have to look for more pairs in different colors. Thanks!"
4.0,Fun toy glasses. I'm going to Canada over the summer for Canadian Day and I'm so excited. So I picked up a pair of Canada Sunglass and they are fun. They are &#34;toy sunglasses&#34; they are not like high end glasses but they are fun and cool. They are the kind of sunglasses that if you lose them it is not the end of the world. It is a great way to celebrate the country that you love. Great for a fun day but not high end.<br /><br />I received this sunglasses for free in exchange for my honest review.
4.0,Love them. They look just like I thought they would and they arrived on time.
4.0,"It's a nice belt for the price. Just runs a bit small. I normally get 34-36, so I ordered that. The first hole barely fits me, so I'd get a 36-38 next time. So if you normally get a 40-42 belt, get a 42-44 instead."
4.0,"Nice very thin jacket , not for everyday wear. Runs small, instead of medium I got XL"
4.0,This is pretty comfortable and definitely cute. The straps are adjustable and has a pocket for extra filter protection. Pretty soft on the face but it does muffle the voice a bit more than some other masks.
4.0,"What a steal. Quality is great, comfortable, and fits exactly as I was hoping. Material has a slight spandex feel to it but not so form fitting that you feel like a stuffed sausage. I'm 140lbs, 36D Chest."
4.0,I really like these and one went on my key ring for our new house keys and the other on an ornament for the Christmas Tree.  It's beautiful and makes a wonderful gift.  The only complaint I have is that the jump ring holding it together keeps getting loose and I almost lose the disc with the etching every once in a while.  I am replacing it with a small overlapping one after the last time it happened so I don't lose it.
4.0,Fits good not to baggy n not to tight. Only negative is the picture could be clearer
4.0,Awesome shorts! 4xl is a USA large. Pockets are great!
4.0,Very comfortable!  Love the longer sleeves so they don’t ride up. A little clingy because it fits tighter than expected for the size I bought.
4.0,I liked the amount of compression with these socks - not too much nor too little. The color choices are fun too. I mainly plan on using these when I work out for some added support or at night when my calves can sometimes ache. So far so good.
4.0,"These are a really cute pair of boots, very stylish.  Genuine leather too, the only prob is the toe is not leather and a sort of spandex-feeling/looking material and I feel like if my son were to scrape it on concrete it would rip, snag and not look good.  It hasn't happened yet though, we'll see."
4.0,"The quality of the Spiewak jacket is amazing. I just had to get it because of the brand shares the same name as my last name. The size is a bit snug though, and I kind of wish I had gotten one size larger. This will keep you warm."
4.0,Does NOT fit the Samsung Gear Sport.
4.0,I love the idea of this bra. Sometimes the band is kind of hard to keep attached as I’m<br />Putting it on. Maybe because its pretty stiff and a little bit of an awkward position when putting it on. But overall love the look of it. Really solves a lot of outfit problems for me
4.0,Dress looks great. My 4 year old loves it. It does run a little wide in the bodice.
4.0,"Comfortable and well fitting, this mask is nice. Pocket holds a filter and the straps do not pinch my ears. Most people love the design. Only startled one person."
4.0,The product i received has been worn before.  It had a knot tied in it and smelled strongly of perfume. Fit was okay.  Just hope the stretched out area from the knot straightens out.
4.0,"When I looked at the Yoga pants, I didn’t think I could even fit into it.  I received a Size Small.  I was pleasantly surprised that I am able to fit in it, and comfortably, too!  The material is 79% polyester and 21% spandex, so it’s very stretchy.  As a 5’3” and 120lbs person with a middle-aged tummy, the tummy area stretched and accommodated the area.  The length of the pants from waist to hem is 29.5 inches.  On me, the hem falls to mid-calf.  I was hoping for it to be longer.  On the larger sizes, it may be longer.  Aside from the short length, I found these pants to be comfortable and affordable."
4.0,"Big bottom, small waist so would expect top would be loose"
4.0,"Loved it, though I do wish it could have fit on my tiny lil wrist. Chunky and classy looking for an fun event!<br />Took a star away due their sizing statement which was obviously wrong."
4.0,Good value for the money.  Great colors and design.  The only reason for the missing star here is beacuse the inside of the boot (where the feet is) the inside fabric is getting worn out easily. But still worth the money.
4.0,"Okay, so it DOES drape like the model. It’s really cute in that way but it has A LOT of material. I am 5’3 and 113lbs. I cut about 16in off off the hem so that the neck wouldn’t hang so low because of the weight of all of the fabric. Now it sits mid-calf and I am happy. It does like look it’s going to shrink like heck in the dryer but I like it so much that I’d just buy another one."
4.0,"Quite a bit larger than expected, but pretty nonetheless. The stones are sparkly, but the size gives them a bit of an &#34;of course these are not real&#34; look, especially when you wear 3 of them (the smallest 3) together in your ears at once."
4.0,Very pretty. Love the dangle of the pearl. I wish they had a stopper to prevent them from falling out. I tend to loose them unless the wire is long or has the back stopper.
4.0,"Absolutely love this dress, can be worn for that special occasion"
4.0,Battery still works. Owned since December.
4.0,"I am using this band for my Garmin Vivomove 3S. The finish is a little more mat than the shiny rose gold ring of the garmin but I don’t mind. It has a nice and secure fit at the watch connection. Removing the links was VERY difficult. You have to line it up perfectly or the little tool with bend and break. Fortunately they send multiple of that piece. It was frustrating to get to size and the clasp was stuck shut, I had to have my husband bust it open. It’s easier to open and close now. I docked a star because of the difficulty to size, but overall love the band. I actually forgot about my frustrations with sizing until I saw the other reviews on here, so time heals all wounds!"
4.0,"Okay, first off, the boring stuff: I received this item free (sometimes heavily discounted) in exchange unbiased and HONEST feedback. As in, if I wasn’t planning on buying the dog-gone thing anyway, I don’t review it.  I’d rather not accumulate 25 selfie sticks and 30 watermelon cutters, but thanks anyway!<br /><br />Now, the fun stuff…<br /><br />I can't get past how dang cute these actually are.  They're stylish, edgy, and fun.  The materials seems to be of a decent quality, the laces relatively durable. Despite the platforming, be aware these are still a good 3-4 inch high heels.<br /><br />The one thing that docked these a star is that you have GOT to make sure you order a half size up (for no socks) or full size (for socks) up.  The way the toes are shaped is an intense point, which made it so my normal size seven did not fit comfortably.  I went through the process of sending these back and exchanging them for a half size up.<br /><br />Finally, be an informed consumer, read good and bad reviews, and make sure they apply to the product listed.  Feel free to ask me any questions below (I check my reviews every other day for questions) if I can help in any way in making your decision.<br /><br />And thanks for reading!"
4.0,Nice dress the material is soft and looks like it will hold up better than the t-shirt type dresses at  the local wally world. I like how there is no seam mid waist very comfortable but reds not my color I was looking for more of a burgundy. If you find this review helpful please like. Thanks
4.0,"It was a flattering dress, true to size. Hard to see in the pictures, there were darts in the front— not my favorite on a dress. I returned it. Fabric was nice."
4.0,I like the sunglasses I bought a few pair. The only thing is that I don't know if they change the style so often that it was hard for me to find replacement lenses or where to get them.
4.0,Pretty good for a used one. Did not have the complete feature like all the flashing modes. Overall it serves the main purpose of brightly lighting your path.
4.0,Very thin! Not the best quality.
4.0,"The grey is not grey, it's blue, not what I was expecting since I ordered the grey, but it's still pretty. The flowers are bright. Fits as expected."
4.0,The chains are a bit delicate so be careful. Order a size up. It is a good sun bathing outfit
4.0,"I got this band because I wanted one for dressier occasions. I have a Milanese band but I don’t like how the sharp edges snag on clothes, etc. This band is way better. It was hard to get the links out with the tool they supplied so I had to use a hammer and pliers.<br /><br />I can’t speak as to the durability. I haven’t had it very long but so far, no scratches."
4.0,"This fit an adult man's head, but was a little tight. I actually stretched it on a melon for a few days before I had to wear it so it wouldn't give me a headache.<br /><br />The style is great for costumes. Doesn't look too cheap or childish."
4.0,"I didn't like the texture/fabric. The size runs small so I ordered larger. I wish the length was a little longer though, only goes to belt line even with a larger size."
4.0,"If you must wear reading glasses, these are great.  Can't honestly say that I would 'love' any pair of glasses."
4.0,Very comfortable but already falling apart on the bottom a little.
4.0,Love them... Except the stain on the posts didn't match the backs. I got 3 blacks and only 2 cherry wood. Otherwise awesome.
4.0,"Bought it quickly for an emergency and it saved me. Materials are cheap, construction is not bad. I liked how it fit. Would like more with better quality material."
4.0,Nice goggles and they work fine.  No large complaint against them.  The optics look good and clear.  I do not see any distortion.  They form a good fit over my eyes.  No significant problems with fogging.  They do not fog any worse than any of my other goggles.  They are lightly tinted.  No problems with seeing in the pool.  My only complaint is that they are a little big.  The silicone sealer is very thick.  This causes the goggles to protrude outwards.  This results in my being able to see the sides of the goggles in my peripheral vision more than my other goggles.  This is slightly distracting.  Not a huge deal but enough to make me prefer my other goggles which have a thinner sealer and fit closer to my eyes.
4.0,Very nice pendant.  A little heavy though.
4.0,"I like wearing fishnet gloves when I go out.  These fit well.  They could have been made from a better material, started to fray the first time I wore them"
4.0,These are basic key label tags. Nice and get the job done. The label is a bit small for those who need to write bigger.
4.0,No me lo he puesto x que no me quedo muy pequeña
4.0,"Great dress. Great quality. The neckline is beautiful. I only wish it was a few inches shorter. Dresses right below the knee look funny. I’m 5’7, it should be shorter on me. Going to try and hem and it will be perfect!"
4.0,I made a mistake on my part overall if it was the right band size its perfect.
4.0,Love this sweater!! It is really warm and looks just like the picture. The only thing is I would check the sweater and tie off and weave in the ends where the sleeves are connected before wearing it so it doesn’t come undone.
4.0,I bought this necklace for my witchy Halloween costume. It was perfect! Looks nice on a turtleneck.
4.0,The males was little big but easy to fix but they are great I work with kids so jewerly always gets pulled on and it has been doing good
4.0,"Great shoes, but a little large for my daughter. Since there are no laces, we might just need to wait until her foot grows a bit. Still highly recommend the shoes. Very cute design."
4.0,Its a beautiful bracelet.
4.0,They are good for the price. Adjustable. But they do turn that ugly fake silver color after a few wears. Paint w clear nail polish when u get them.
4.0,Looks smaller than the picture.
4.0,The dress fit well and was comfortable. The material isn't very thick tho so I'm not sure how long the dress will hold up.
4.0,The earrings are very cute. I believe the posts are sterling silver. The price is good and they look real. Make sure you remove them daily before you take a shower and don't put them back on until you have completely gotten ready because chemicals can mess them up. Wipe them with the included cloths to keep them new and shiny.
4.0,"When I read the other reviews that said these earrings were really small, I thought that would be good because I prefer smaller jewelry. However, these are EXTREMELY small, to the point that even the ear wires look like they are made for a child's ears. The earrings are beautiful and well made, but they are the same size as a dime, as in they are as long as the radius of a dime, so be aware that when everyone says &#34;small&#34; they really mean tiny."
4.0,"Really great cosplay scarf! I think the scarf is a bit too large, but it is the best Mikasa scarf I've found! Great outside of cosplay as well!"
4.0,"I believe that I need a large. Other than that, I love the dress."
4.0,Overall great product!  Some spots on the jacket are not as fluffy as others but improving as it sits outside of the vacuum sealed bag.
4.0,"A little too small to wrap completely around as in picture, and a little too long to have across the shoulders without it slipping (I wear a 4-6 in women's).  Well made though, and super warm.  Very pretty on!"
4.0,Nice color combo.
4.0,Not recommended for heavy items
4.0,Super cute jacket!
4.0,"Love the purse, took awhile to receive it. But it is exactly as pictured."
4.0,I had bought other tie from other brand also but those tie didn't fit properly the knot its either smaller or its bigger in my neck. But this has proper width as well as length so we can easily wear this and the cloth quality is good. The color is attractive to wear with white and other color shirt. I liked this and recommend others to buy.
4.0,"I love the look, they are very gorgeous on. They feel kinda cheap but for like 10 bucks I ain't complaining I can keep buying them if they break on me lol. One thing that kinda bugs me about them is the reflection on the inside of the glasses, I can see behind me."
4.0,Received on time and fit perfectly
4.0,"I don't love it but I don't hate it. The first time I tried to wear it I did not like it at all...it's very awkward. The second time I figured out how to manipulate it to fit correctly. Once you get it positioned right and the straps lined up correctly in the back, it's much more comfortable"
4.0,"White top is actually an ugly faint lavender! It looks like it just came out of the club still glowing from the black lights. Hoping it'll fade with a few washes. That being said, I really like the fit, form fitting but not too tight. So much so, that I'll be buying the black one. Should've read the reviews a little closer about the &#34;white&#34; color..."
4.0,"The leather is great, the soles are a bit thin, but we have worn them a lot the last month and they still look new. And super cute."
4.0,"A little heavier than I imagined, but beautiful."
4.0,Lots of room!
4.0,Not big enough.
4.0,"I would like to have known how difficult it is to keep the wings in the place you want them to stay while wearing the necklace. They are gorgeous, but do not always stay in the position you put them in. Otherwise it is a wonderful piece and I like it very much. It it very eye catching."
4.0,Love! Hooks on so easily and is very much in style! I used it as a gift! The only thing is that if someone is allergic it is not real gold - obviously! Very stylish!
4.0,I like the shirt!
4.0,"good quality material, well made."
4.0,but you can tuck your hair in and still works good
4.0,"Okay ladies, let me give you the run down. So I'm giving this 4 starts only because of the way this fits. It is bigger in the chest area than expected. I ordered a medium because I'm a 36B.<br />When I started liking for suits I wanted something that was cute but modest. This suit on me is anything but flattering. I feel it's loose and the padding in the best area is awkward because of its looseness. You can actually see how loose on the picture I've posted of my back.<br />I'm a fairly new mom of my own with 2 step children. Having my own child though has made me more conscious of how I present myself. I was fortunate to escape stretch marks but I'm at that age where sexy doesn't meaning letting it all hang out.<br />The material is great quality. It's Very thick. This seems like an older woman swimsuit. I'm not saying old, just older than me (25). I would probably recommend for my mom who is pushing that half a century mark.<br />Overall this bathing suit is great quality. It's just not for me. I willing be looking for another style and will likely be returning this. Hope my experience helps."
4.0,The whole thing fits pretty well except the arms. The sleeves feel baggy and not the good baggy either. Like to baggy to look good. Tried to wash it into making it a bit of a better fit but those sleeves.. just wont budge
4.0,"I ordered this on Thursday and got it Saturday thanks to prime 2 day shipping. It is a little hard to judge this shirt by its picture but is very pretty.  It looks boxy when you hold it up but is semi-fitted, meaning its not a tight fit but still flattering.  I wear between L - XL because I'm body conscious. I am 38B, 40in waist( including my stomach) but if it does not shrink I will be happy with my L."
4.0,I like them. But they are a gift so I will see if they are a success.
4.0,"Super comfortable but quite big on the upper chest part, I am a 38C.  The fabric feels really nice 👌<br /><br />I don't think it was cut with real silhouettes in mind, it feels more like an Asian sized pattern that was enlarged all around without the proper adjustments.<br /><br />I still love it."
4.0,Returning. Way too small
4.0,Nice robe for $20
4.0,Good variety of colors for every outfit. Good quality material.
4.0,Multiple colors
4.0,Super cute dress! Fits slightly oversized. Love the pockets. I am wearing a small. I am 5’4” and usually a size 6/8. Pretty decent quality.
4.0,Very pretty and comfortable to wear
4.0,Perfect. Nice a comfortable! Supports the weight of the beer easily.
4.0,Very warm and soft socks - would have given 5 stars but part of one pair had loose thread right out of package - am concerned now about long term durability - at present crossing fingers and enjoying their warmth
4.0,Very comfortable for the kids
4.0,The sleeves left much to be desired as they are very tiny and it felt really tight in the top. I ordered a 3x (im a 44d) and the material is super clingy. itll be very nice with a shaw over it.
4.0,Nice yoga pants.
4.0,I sent mine back they are cute but way to small I ordered an 9 fit like an 8. One thing I did learn was never ever order a name brand anything from a 3rd party
4.0,Good quality fabric and sturdy. I brought other TOURIT packing mash bags but the others are lesser quality and this is better.
4.0,"I'm a fairly &#34;beefy&#34; short guy, I will agree with other reviews go up a size and even that may fit a little odd in the chest, pecs start coming out the sides, I bought XL and may not be able to wear it after a trip thru the washer/dryer.  But, they were cheap, so if ur a gym rat, go up a size, if u wear skinny jeans it would be ok ;)"
4.0,"Got an XL, my size is large. Fits nice. Love it!. I recommend 2 sizes up and everything will be fine."
4.0,"A little thinner than expected but still very sturdy. It came in a drawstring pouch with extra parts, which was pretty cool."
4.0,I do like this shirt and it fits nicely.
4.0,"The shoelaces were great in theory but didn't work for our son's shoes. The tip makes it pretty easy to put in but after little use some pop out which defeats the purpose of him being able to put shoes on by himself since he isn't able to put them back in. He did say they were comfortable and comparable to his regular shoe laces. The company was very helpful and despite having some issues, it was a positive experience."
4.0,What I like most about my purchase with this outfit is that it came with everything as described and that it fits very wonderfully and comfortably
4.0,Only problem was that some of the balls were broken but otherwise my girlfriend loved them
4.0,"These pants fit in the waist perfectly. They are a bit long, however. I normally wear 32 inch length pants and have done so for well over 10 years. These are the first pair of pants that are too long for me that claim to be 32 inches. I wish I would have gone with a size 30. I would purchase again, but get a shorter length. Otherwise, I love these ones. The zippered pocket is perfect for a passport if you are traveling abroad with these."
4.0,I’m new to the Apple world.I brought this beautiful band didn’t pay attention to my watch type. The band fit but the bling bling watch cover was to. Big  but I still love the band
4.0,Title is misleading These are not so oversized.. Not as wide a original Cazals but still cool
4.0,Love the piece but definitely is more suited for a navel ring vs VCH due to the weight and gauge size.
4.0,"Really like the suit.  Got it to work out in for water aerobics.  Reading al the reviews I went up a size - glad I did.  I'm tall and that's the one thing I couldn't tell from the reviews is how the height worked.  I went up a size- I'm a 6-8 and did the XL.....I don't think I could have done a bigger one but height wise could have used a bit more room.  Colors are great, design is great, it was good for the money for sure."
4.0,Looking forward to giving this to my brother at Christmas.<br />Love the LOGO....  was a bit surprised that the material was so thin.
4.0,"I had to fix it, since it was very large, although, it is super comfortable, and nice, but it is great."
4.0,Beautifully crafted wallet without being overly bulky and protruding.
4.0,"I use it under my helmet when cycling, and under my ball cap when running.  It is comfortable, and does not add significant heat (order the white one, not the black).  I have skin cancer and am trying to be cautious.  The black band is not as elastic as i would like it to be, but it stays in place."
4.0,Too soon to say if they last but cozy and comfortable.
4.0,This item in the 0-3 months size is too big. The item is of a very nice quality though.
4.0,"The slippers are very nice but unfortunately they did not fit.  This was my fault, I ordered the wrong size.  My husband loved them though.  It's a shame size 11 is no longer available though."
4.0,Excited to use but made from very cheap material. Excited to wear my oils without having to get on my skin :)
4.0,I love it nicer than I thought for .01 wow
4.0,Perfect non traditional Christmas sweatshirt
4.0,The shirt fit perfectly it the skirt was a bit to big. I had to roll it up in attempts to keep it in my 2 year old.  It still would fall down though.
4.0,"Would probably have preferred a simpler band, but it serves the purpose."
4.0,Nice look. You may have to remove links if you are slim or medium built.
4.0,I loved the design and quality of this shirt. It is long enough to reach my hips as I wanted but I felt that fits a little too tight for the look I expected (I usually wear XS and I ordered S). I would totally buy another one in a different color.
4.0,Its good for the price..
4.0,"I bought this for my sister for Christmas, she likes it very much. The only thing she says is that is a little loose on the top and she had to have it fixed fit. The material is good and works great"
4.0,"Cute shirts. My daughter loves them. She is usually a size 6. I ordered a 6x and they are kinda small. Definitely size up at least one, maybe two sizes."
4.0,very nice but runs small if u are to be kept warm
4.0,"Very big and pretty, the first one tarnished and they had to send me another. if you buy just make sure you just wear it for out and then take it off when you get home, don't want to sweat in it."
4.0,Adorable shirt but runs small
4.0,"Love this top, the colors are spot on and the sizing is pretty true to the measurements. The top IS elastic, I was able to not where the extra strap and just chill out around the lake all day without worrying about a slip. However if you're going to be doing some rough water playing you'll probably want the strap on."
4.0,"This bag is beautiful. Very good quality. I would have given it 5 stars, but the bag is smaller that I expected. I would not return the bag just for the size. I do love it. I may order another one in a different color."
4.0,"Received this quite quickly, which is awesome. It looks exactly like the picture, color and all. There was a few black spots on the purse, and a few indents, but it isn't too bad. They aren't super noticeable unless you get close. This purse isn't a big purse by any means, it's a medium purse. It can fit my wallet, hair brush, lip glosses/chapsticks, cell phone, basically everything you'd need to go to the store/mall, or any where you'd normally go. It isn't made for carrying a TON of things, but quite a few. I really like this purse, and it stands up on it's own. It also came with an extra strap. Very cute. I love it. (Some of the pictures I took the purse looks orange, but it is not. It is pink just like the first picture I took with flash)"
4.0,"The maker of this item needs to consider that some women have chunky wrists to match the rest of their chunky bodies; at least, in this case that is true.  If i search ""large cuff"" I'm doing so for a better fit.  Nice cuff; uncomfortable fit."
4.0,"They do the job and reduce buckle bulkiness, however, CV these are very cheap looking."
4.0,It's a nice top. Lightweight but not sheer. Runs a bit big.
4.0,Cute earing.
4.0,For the price this is a really cute bracelet.  The silver looks to be of decent quality and it's nice and sturdy.  Arrived quickly and in great shape.  Very happy with this purchase!
4.0,"I wear these every day, and they don't tarnish which is awesome. The only thing is the prongs are a bit loose on some of them. Great buy for the money tho!"
4.0,These are cute lightweight tote bags. I think they would hold quite a bit. They are lightweight material so I'm not sure how heavy of a load you could put in them.  They are like a plastic type material that actually does seem to be pretty strong when I try to pull on it.  I bought them to use as grocery bags for when I go grocery shopping. If I've got to do the chore I might as well look good doing it right? LOL  They fold up nice and flat so I can store them in my trunk.  They arrived in a timely fashion and they were as described. I would purchase these again.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was offered this product either free or at a reduced cost in exchange for an unbiased review of the product. The opinions expressed are my own.

4.0,"So, it’s ok. It runs smaller than the other Warner’s wire free bras (like the no dig with convertible straps). Overall, it’s just a meh fit, meh in “lift” and meh in comfort."
4.0,This dress is cute but the sleeves are much shorter than the photo.
4.0,"I love the jacket, but it still is not the color I expected. This was my second one (I returned the first). I know greens are hard to match. I'm wearing it with different clothes than what I had planned. It's beautiful, comfortable and very luxurious. I might buy another one in a totally different color."
4.0,Christmas gift. Pretty good tee.
4.0,will be sharing these with family members
4.0,Loved the dress and it does look like whats pictured but it is sheer.... You can see through it
4.0,"Very cute, fits as expected, and the color is perfect.... just not comfortable to wear for long periods of time (or if you are standing up for awhile)."
4.0,"I like this SONJA BETRO Women's Red Floral Printed Smock Bib Ruffle Trim Sleeveless Babydoll Tunic Top, and didn't notice the ""Plus Size"" in the ad, because i thought this was a Medium when I ordered it... There is no sizing on the tags, so I can't be sure. At any rate, it fits me right across the shoulders and top, and hangs comfortably loose in the baby doll style as advertised, with a stretchy part across the chest that would be comfortable for many sizes. I'm a 34B to 36B. The top is great in hot weather, and flows lightly and comfortably around me being 100% polyester and a looser fit. The shoulder ruffles makes this top look a bit squared, but not too bad. The main issue I have with this is that it is really long on me, with the back hanging past my butt to mid-thigh. The front is cut slightly shorter.  Overall though, it's a pleasant top for summer."
4.0,"Bought for wife for upcoming diving trip.  She really likes it and doesn't snag her hair.  Still have to make sure it hasn't snuck under the mask seal, but no real issues.  Looks good on her, too!"
4.0,Ran just a little small so if you want flowy or loose size up. Soft. Good length for leggings.
4.0,Great item. Fiancee loved them
4.0,Very tight stitching in thigh area
4.0,"Love the color. Love the style. I’m 5’7, 115 lbs and the medium fits—not perfect, it could be a little snugger, but a small would’ve been too small. The only issue I had was the lining and where it’s stitched to the dress. It seems it was off just a tad at the bottom of the zipper. Otherwise, I loved the dress and it was a hit! (This brand always seems to be better quality than the others on amazon.)"
4.0,"Great colors, but wish they were a little larger.  Still, they stay in the pocket holder with no problem. Glad the edges are finished."
4.0,It really beautiful and I love it except the chain snags the heart charm some. Other than that I love it!
4.0,"fits well, stays on really well, helps support my back and i sweat really well"
4.0,"It fit great and I mostly just bought it because the strap goes under the other and prevents it from slipping out loke most conventional watchbands. I haven't had it very long and the pin that connects the band to the watch tore along the length of the pin. Not sure how that would happen, seeing as how I don't do any particularly strenuous activities in my day to day as a chef. I just missed the return window, so I chose to buy a similar band from a different maker. Again, great band. I just wish it lasted longer than a couple months"
4.0,a happy Dr. Who recipient!
4.0,"I saw BojoJen wearing it and I knew I had to buy it! It definitely is a bit overpriced since you’re paying for the name “Twitch.” The hoodie is comfy and thick great for chilly days. The ‘strings’ serve not much purpose, I saw many people cutting them off but they didn’t bother me at all. Btw, elastic string are yellow, not black as shown in the product picture."
4.0,Nice--Somewhat heavy
4.0,I thought they would work for my grandson but are not adjustable....they are fine for me!
4.0,Love everything about the outfit but the waistband is TERRIBLE
4.0,Love the case. Kickstand broke a month after getting this.
4.0,In the photo the product is blue & white<br />I received blue & pink
4.0,"This is a great casual watch.  I really like the dial.  Nicely detailed, plus the lum is pretty good.  I do have two minor issues with the watch.<br />First, the outer part of the dial with the minute markers is ever so slightly misaligned, which results in the second, and minute hand never exactly lining up.  Not a big deal, but annoying, and an indication of quality control.<br />Second, I have not yet been able to get the watch to fully charge.  I think the rotor is a bit tight, causing it to not spin as fast / much as it should.  I can only get the charge indicator to make it to the 20 second mark, instead of 30 which would mean a full charge.<br /><br />My conclusion is, this is still a great watch for the money."
4.0,Great deal for four. I could have sized down has they are very stretchy. Still keeping them as they are still good.
4.0,Nice accent to outfits
4.0,It is just as it appears and is not nearly as heavy as expected.
4.0,Great for back pockets just a hair big for front pocket carry.  Got another same company it is perfect for what I needed.  Look at all they offer you will find something that you like.
4.0,Cute top. Fits a little loose not form fitting.
4.0,They’re a little smaller than I thought but cute
4.0,"My husband like it , he will definitely be wearing it alot , value for money"
4.0,The fit was great but the strap on the back was weird and kept pushing his feet to the front of the shoe
4.0,"I was somewhat hesitant about buying this shirt, mainly because most of the time when you order clothes online, they don’t look as pictured. So I ended up buying t this shirt for my brother  to wear for his trip to Europe this fall since it’s going to be really cold and he was in need of thick and warm clothing. I bought him the blue combo color one in medium and it fit perfectly. He is 6’1 tall and a 32 waist. The Polo oxford is comfortable, and it's a classic. It can be worn with or without a under shirt. It’s got a good, heavyweight brushed flannel material, and it has a nice design. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

4.0,Very nice...quick delivery
4.0,What I liked most was that the pearls were beautiful.  As was the beautiful box they came in.  Unfortunately when we opened the box one of the pearls were broken off of the post.  Hoping this was just a rare case given how much they cost.  Grateful it happened before we opened them and not after we gave them as a gift to my daughter.  Most likely would not have known if it was a product default or my daughters fault.  Oddly enough the break was in the middle of the post and not from pearl to post.  Hmmmmm
4.0,This jumpsuit was all of that. I wore it for my birthday party. The compliments were never ending. Caution it runs small so up your size from what you normally wear.<br />Love Love Love
4.0,I love this shirt and the material is so soft. I got a XL and I should of gotten a M or L.<br />Will be using it as a sleep shirt.
4.0,Not as light as the picture make it looks. Kind of a darker tan.
4.0,This shirt fits great. The only thing I don't like about it is it's not wrinkle free. Other than that great product.
4.0,"Fit was very tight. Bought the 2x, but I don't think a 3x would have fit if they had it."
4.0,"I really like this bag - the color, the style, the zippers. The reason I have deducted one star is the decision they made to split the main part of the bag into three thin parts - it doesn't make it easier to organize and it actually frustrates me more when I try to find something. They have basically sewn together two bags and the middle part makes for a third pocket in the middle. I'd much rather have it be one bag and remove the extra fabric in the middle to make more room. Also, I've had the bag for only a couple months and the bottom corners are starting to show some wear, which is odd considering I use the sidestrap and this bag doesn't sit up on it's own, so the bottoms aren't touched a lot. Overall I think it was a cute bag for a good price, but could use a little tweaking."
4.0,I love it! Cheap material
4.0,I got the band about a month ago and it has already last one side of the stones. I would only recommend getting this if you plan on wearing it every now and than as it is not for everyday use.
4.0,It was tight in my busy. The skirt is long. It definitely is as it looks the 1950s style.
4.0,"It’s a smooth, comfortable ring. Sturdy and pretty. Looks more expensive Than it was!"
4.0,"These are a good character boot for a lots of roles.  The lacing is a little wonky,though."
4.0,cut 2 fit
4.0,Very Good Item.
4.0,Im 5”4 200lbs !! To me personally the sizing is off depending on how you like your clothes!! I got this in a medium and to be honest I feel like I still could have went down another size!!
4.0,Get ready to hem.  I am 5'6&#34;and I hemmed 3 inches and still wore high heels.  Can be fancy or laying around the house.  So comfy.
4.0,"Got these for my nephew for Christmas! He is obsessed with Batman so he loved them , would be nice if they had more size options!"
4.0,"Very flattering and great material. It is thick and almost has a velvet texture, or microfiber. The straps are not adjustable, and feel a little loose, but not enough to return. I ordered a small"
4.0,"I love the softness of these socks, foot fit is perfect although the ankle is a little small."
4.0,Theses are super cute! I thought they were supposed to glow in the dark!? They fit as expected.
4.0,Runs small. Seller sent one out no charge though! Then it was great
4.0,This shirt is a very well made shirt. It is very heavy. Can wear it in the winter or colder time.
4.0,"Arrived early which was great.<br />However,I found the bottoms to be too large for me. The top fit great though,and an added bonus is that it doesn't really look a pj top so it can be worn as a regular shirt! So it's a win either way."
4.0,"Very pretty &amp; just right with casual summer dresses, cruise wear, jeans...<br /><br />A little tight across the top...where the decor is."
4.0,Cute costume. My 3 year old had fun in it. I didnt like how the Cape is connected to the mask and the closure in the back needs a bigger piece of velcro. Over all not bad. If you child has a large head (like mine) the mask may not fit properly. He wore it above his eyes.
4.0,"Nice soft fabric. Not like a regular t-shirt. This material is a bit clingy & fits about a size too small. If you like the fitted look, this is the shirt for you."
4.0,"They fit well, and are comfortable, but they're maybe an inch shorter than what I wanted."
4.0,I love this sweater. I got the yellow one thinking it was like a dandelion/mustardy color. And it is… in my house. But when I get to work it looks different. A coworker said it was closer to lime green. I sized up because I’m personally between sizes right now and wanted it to be comfortable.
4.0,Really pretty! Can’t tell yet if it may shed some so that would be my only complaint. But I really like it!
4.0,Beautiful addition to bridesmaids' jewelry.
4.0,"Nice size, want fit a whole lot but a nice gift overall!"
4.0,"This necklace is one of the prettier Victorian lace like chokers I've seen in awhile. The necklace itself is rather delicate in my opinion with its lace cutouts, chains and pendants. It also quite literally is a choker; as I must admit that the necklace is rather snug. When my item arrived; I must admit that I was beyond ecstatic, for me the shipping was not prime available and had a good couple of weeks wait time; which was perfectly fine. Considering it arrived two weeks ahead of schedule, I couldn't have been happier.<br />When I opened the package I found the necklace hanging/wrapped up around a piece of cardboard that showed it off wonderfully. At first glance there seems to be an extension chain hooked to a little hole at the bottom corner of the cardboard which couldn't have made me happier because I was worried about the necklace being too tight. Once I unwrapped the item, it became clear that there was no chain on the necklace itself to allow you to wear it as depicted in the item photos. What I thought was an extension chain turned out to be part of the necklace itself--unattached.<br />On closer inspection it also seemed that the chain was just clipped onto the cardboard because the connecting end was tightly closed, and the item was seemed highly protected in the package it came in; so any chance it was a shipping issue seems unlikely. Upon finding this issue I contacted the seller who was cordial enough to email me attachment instructions. To be honest, the attachment is straightforward and exactly what I expected it to be prior to a response. All that really needs to be done is twisting open the connecting chain just enough to slide it through the hook on the necklace, then closing it back up. Because I have strength issues in my hands, I required a pair of &#34;needle pliers&#34; to get the connecting chain closed again. To be safe I also clamped it with said pliers as tight as I could.<br />The necklace is to me, a bit on the delicate side so I use caution when handling it and the few times I've worn it (with absolutely no problems by the way). Because of this I also do not just let it hang from a necklace stand; instead I keep it pinned flat, or laying flat, or wrapped around the neck of the cardboard piece it came it so that the chains do not get tangled up or rip off. It is a rather stunning artsy piece to have especially considering just how hard it is to find such pieces.<br /><br />I received this item at discount in return for my honest and unbiased review of the product."
4.0,"Great lenses, especially for the price. They fit perfectly and do a great job in the sun. Not as mirrored as I had hoped, but they're a quality product."
4.0,"Bought a turquoise pair on vacation so thought these would be a nice addition but this is a different style & they were too big, although same size I bought previously & fit really awkwardly.  Returned with no problems."
4.0,The tail part was cute. Although as an XL(usa) woman it was hard getting into it. The waist band was very tight.
4.0,Good design and construction. I like this product.
4.0,"This Pink Microfleece Pajama Set is super soft ~ it's made of a soft, stretchy material that is great for sleeping in, but a little warmer than I am used too.  I had ordered a size larger than I usually do, and I'm glad, because these run about a size too small.  I really like this set for a lounge set, super comfy to hang around the house in."
4.0,"Colors fade a tad bit, but otherwise not bad for the price!"
4.0,I like the way it lays
4.0,"This is a decent winder for the money. After over a year, mine stopped working. It was easily fixed by replacing a broken rubber drive belt with a rubber band. I am looking for an o-ring or little drive belt for next time it breaks, but even a box of 100 o rings is cheap.."
4.0,Really cute dress. The only thing that I was concerned about was the lining underneath was rather short. I kept it because it was too cute.
4.0,Fit perfecr. I got a lot of compliments.
4.0,"Ordered a 3X and I usually buy a L or  XL when buying a bathing suit.  It fits in the back, bum, waist and torso.<br />I'm large busted and the cups are small. Some of that is the design - as it is more of an under cup, shallow cup design. Which mean there is a bit of spillage on the sides near my armpits. Smaller busted women probably wouldn't have any issue with this.<br />The bathing suit is a one piece & the lining is one piece throughout. The top because it is ruched - is a separate piece of fabric from the bottom , but sown to the bottoms along the back., This is so you can adjust the amounts of rouching around your middle, which is probably really nice if you are shorter waisted, or want to accentuate a thin middle."
4.0,"Beautiful top, I ordered a small but the neck part was a bit too big for my small neck."
4.0,"It fits well, the material, is comfortable, and the print is great!!  I am satisfied with the tee shirt, and would purchase again."
4.0,"I am 8 months pregnant and 5'10&#34;. I ordered a XL, this is what I normally wear. It fit my belly perfect! Only downside is it is about 3&#34; to short. I am keeping it. Great buy for the price."
4.0,"Like:<br />good for walking, light and comfortable.<br />Dislike:<br />The text (writing) on the back of it, is wearing off and it's less than 6 month old."
4.0,"For what ever reason, the sizes for this set starts at medium and goes up from there.  I’m typically a size 4-6 so the medium was perfect. I would equate that to a small. I was a bit skeptical of how this lingerie would really feel.  To my surprise, the description of this lingerie dress is true! The lace that covers the breast area is soft, even at the seams.  I couldn’t get over how it felt on my skin.  I was not impressed with the quality of the ribbon that was used.  As part of the dress, it seems soft enough, but the section of ribbon that you would tie a bow in the middle of the dress was a bit stiff.  I would’ve preferred a more satin type of ribbon for that part.  The mesh (?) for the remainder of the dress was fine and it is pleated at the chest as pictured.  The straps for the dress will do, but they have these little loops on the edge of the elastic that I’m almost certain will get caught on something like your ring. The G-string that is included is made of the same material as the dress itself so it too is soft.  The seat of the G-string runs right down the middle of the panty, which visually is annoying.  I like to have an extra cotton layer where your lady parts would be.  But, because the mesh/lace is soft, it doesn’t seem to be a problem in terms of comfort. Overall, I like it.  I would heed the directions to hand wash though. I don’t think it would take a tumble in the wash too well.  Pictures included with the dress over a camisole.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion."
4.0,"I bought this dress for overseas flights because it was 95% thick cotton, full-length, long sleeved, roomy and black. I got a small, I'm normally a medium. It looks like an extra large in terms of the width.The sleeve length and overall length is perfect, however, so had I gone down to an extra small the sleeves may have been too short as well as the length. So wish this was a wee narrower bc I love the thickness of the material, the arms, pockets and full length for travel and chillin' around home on a cool day. XOMB"
4.0,"Very nice quality, much better than I expected for the price! I’m very satisfied, however I rated four stars because of two reasons. 1st the end of the strap isn’t made to fit around the wrist, not a HUGE deal but it would have been nice. 2nd, the opening of the bag is so small and has no give, not meant for more than a sippy cup and some snacks maybe. Again, not a huge deal but would be nice to have some stretch for such a small opening. I love this bag and would definitely recommend!"
4.0,"I like it, does what it’s supposed to.<br />The metal buckle makes it bulkier than I’d like."
4.0,"I was weary because this hat looks really nice in the picture and the price is so low, but it actually looks the same in person. I mean... Yeah the material is a little more rigid than I expected and hey the color is a little more green than blue, but he seller warned me about that in the description so I wasn't all that surprised. Honestly, for the price- it's actually a really good deal I do not regret buying this at all!"
4.0,What you see is what you get the only difference is the green cast in the picture isn't really there in person
4.0,"I need to find out how it gets through cleaning...<br />But out of the box, it is what I wanted.  It is light and comfortable, not at all like the expensive shirts that aren't so soft to the skin and heavy to boot"
4.0,"Very cute except the color was a little off. It looks red in the picture, but in person it's almost a hot red orange color, very bright"
4.0,"I was initially a little put off by the dress when it arrived.  It has a bit of a shine to it and reminds me a lot of the material for Halloween costumes, so I was afraid that it might look obviously cheap.  Still I wore it with a black wide belt and to my surprise, I received a lot of compliments when I wore it to the office.  As others have commented, the pattern isn't super obvious and it was only after I would have the people who just complimented the dress really look at it, that they realized there were dinosaurs on it.  I loved seeing their reactions to it!"
4.0,"Actually really pleased with this jacket. Fits great, keeps warm and super cute"
4.0,"worked great, very nice, we doubled ours and hung and but bats on it."
4.0,Perfect color for a Louise (bobs burgers) costume. Really short though and has a higher part on the side of one leg. I sized up to get some more length and mask the uneven hem. Overall I was pleased with it!
4.0,"The fabric is a stretchy knit and the cut is flattering.  You do need to follow the manufacturer's sizing chart, which will size you up at least one size.  I was afraid the fabric would show every lump and bump given that it's a cheap knit, but the cut of the dress is not clingy.  If it were tight, it might magnify imperfections."
4.0,After reading other reviews I got these in a size bigger. I'm 5'6&#34; 135 lbs and ordered a large. I usually wear mediums but the large fit perfectly!
4.0,I ordered this for my 2 year old and it could fit even a 3 year old which is nice because it would last. Just needed to modify the length
4.0,"I bought this jacket for a New year's Eve party. I looked a little under dressed last year, so I decided to pick up my game a bit this year.<br /><br />For the price, and very likely a one time wear I couldn't have been happier. The jacket was true to size and actually looked really good. It was a solid slim fitting jacket that looked like it was significantly more upscale. No one would guess that it was around $50.<br /><br />Pros: great looking for a super cheap price. Material was pretty nice. Clearly a cheaper material than more expensive jackets, but still well above expectations. The cut was fitted and exactly true to size based on my other suits.<br /><br />Cons: it was clearly an of the shelf looking jacket. But who expects more than that for the price. My guess is that it'll show some wear pretty quickly based on the fabric used<br /><br />Verdict: for the price and event this was the perfect jacket. I'd be tempted to buy another color, spend a few dollars having it tailored and see how it goes. If you need a good looking jacket for an event I wouldn't think twice about buying it again. It's at least as good as what you'd get with a tuxedo rental at your local formal wear rental place."
4.0,Very thin bit nice style. I order XL Asian size for my medium husband.
4.0,"This is a nice summer beach shirt and short set. The material is 70% Viscose, 30% Linen. It seems a little stiff now, I'm hoping after a few washings it becomes softer. The garment care tag says that washing (40C/104F max temperature) is OK, but it suggests not to tumble dry. I guess that means it needs to air dry after washing? The material is fairly thick, and it appears to be well put together and durable. The actual color is more grayish, it appears more blue in the ad. I prefer the color shown in the ad over what I received, mine is a bit bland looking. The fit is good if you go with the size you normally get and ignore the size chart in the ad. Per the size chart in the ad, I should be a medium.  I haven't worn medium since college (and that was a long time ago!). I typically wear a large, so that's what I ordered, and it fit well; so medium would have been way too small. Overall, this is a well made garment, which I'd give my recommendation."
4.0,"Material is very thin, it was cheaper looking than I expected. But it was soft. Had an 8lb baby and this was huge on her in the hospital."
4.0,"Nice size, perfect for slacks or jeans.  Bought it for hubby and he really likes it.  Would have given it a 5, but since it's new, I'm waiting to see how it holds up"
4.0,"My son loves his unique backpack. He loves the hood, perfect for rainy days. Zippers are still working a few months into school."
4.0,"I like them, but wished they had memory foam insoles!"
4.0,Love this purse. I have gotten tons of compliments. It did smell a little funny when I first got it but I left it out of the plastic bag for a few days and the smell faded.
4.0,Keeps you dry
4.0,I read all of the reviews and decided to try it for myself (or actually for my daughter). The color is fantastic. The fabric is what I expected. The design is nice. The only issue is that it's long. My daughter is 19  and 5'3&#34;. The dress was great and fit super; it was just way too long - to suit her taste. I would highly recommend this for an adult! Great dress. Great price. Didn't work for us though!
4.0,The clothes are a little to smaii.  But he likes the designs.
4.0,"I'm a classic RayBan fan, but I keep losing or destroying those expensive glasses. Was looking for a low cost alternative but with the same retro cool look. These zeroUV's have done the job."
4.0,"Wore this to a wedding, and got so many compliments. Everyone was shocked I bought it on Amazon :D<br />I'm 5'2 around 137-142lbs bought a Medium but I could've easily fit a Small"
4.0,"My husband bought this for me. It is very pretty and I receive compliments every time I wear it. Not sure how well it holds up, but if you take care of it, should last. The chain is plain and has a very basic clasp, but is still cute!"
4.0,"Gave these as a gift, and was told they are super comfortable. Worn daily without any problems"
4.0,"Super cute, seems sturdy enough. Wish it had a way to keep the sunflower closed as it does lay open. But my daughter will love it, the rose gold color is exactly the rose gold shade it should be."
4.0,Size runs big so I would suggest ordering a size smaller than you normally would.  I am normally a small and these are definitely big on me.  Very comfortable pajamas and I would purchase again (in a smaller size).
4.0,Got here sooner than expected. The coat is very nice and the material is good too. I am 5'5 120pounds and ordered a medium. A large would have fit much better. A little tight around the arms and I'm kind of petite too. I want to put sweaters under because it's not that warm but I need a large for that. Hopefully I can exchange it.
4.0,Somewhat small but works great
4.0,I purchased this bracelet for my 15yr old daughter who loves Japan.<br />she likes the design and bright color.<br />I'm happy that I purchased this bracelet.
4.0,Perfect. As described. Wear shirt under clothes without notice. Posture training shirt.
4.0,I received lots of compliments on this sweater. It's so soft and warm. It runs true to size.
4.0,"I really like it, bottoms fit perfectly, top piece a little too big-only the straps though, the straps are quite a bit bigger and I cannot adjust them but it still fits enough t wear it. Very comfortable."
4.0,Nice thin gloves. Great for just wearing and walking around outside in colder dry elements. They are like base layer gloves that can fit into my actual snow gloves.
4.0,"Came as expected, super cute"
4.0,"This is as described and works well for the purpose of keeping warm in the cold. It pulls on easily and is easy to wash. Overall, I would describe it as quite good, because it is soft and warm. I can't give it five stars because the color was slightly different in person and it doesn't work for a person with a larger head. I can use it but the men in the home have trouble, because they say it feels a bit strangling. It appears to be a better fit for a smaller head and neck. Still, it is quite good and works well for the purpose. Good luck finding what will work for your needs."
4.0,"Bought these for my boyfriend. Was expecting more of a hunter green and they came out looking like candy buttons. Not a problem, but perhaps not the manliest set of plugs! I like em, though. Also the smaller sizes look quite round in appearance (as in they aren't flat-fronted)."
4.0,"I ordered two of this outfit in different colors black and wine. Size medium. I'm 5'4"" 135lbs. Both are good quality. Love the outfits.<br />No issues with the black. Fits perfect.<br />The wine is thicker fabric, fits tight... it is smaller. A laid the both flat and compared them. Wine is smaller."
4.0,"This affordable version of the ""strawberry dress"" isn't an exact copy, but it does the job for a reasonable price. I chose the version with the pink short sleeves, which has a different waist construction than the original. This version of the waist construction isn't as defining as the original, which is more akin to the ""pink sleeveless"" version here. That said the size medium fit me very well, and was comfortable enough to move around in (I am 5'7"", size 8, 150 lb). As shown in the picture, the cut is rather plunging, so you will need to figure out the right kind of bra to wear with this dress (or just tape it to yourself). The sequin net is a little itchy when it meets my skin, such as around the sleeves and lower legs. It didn't bother me too much but I would stay away if you can't deal with fabric textures. If you can deal with the itchy net, you will probably be pleased with the rest of the dress."
4.0,"They are a bit longer than i expected, im 5'2&#34; 130lbs. Nice soft cotton, no extra push up pads, which i like b.c these engorged tatas dont need any pushing up. Easy clip, lace is pretty & not irritating. Great to wear alone on warm days or when sleeping but too long to layer & its like a babydoll top design, so loose around the belly...which is amazing for mommy belly but not when trying to wear as an under shirt, unless top shirt is loose too. Thats why i gave it 4 stars."
4.0,Comfortable but small
4.0,"The exterior was perfect, but the inside is not for me.  I like an open interior.  This purse have a center divider, which makes me loose space to arrange my items.  Returned."
4.0,The strap is well constructed but it is not for a classical guitar. It is too short.  It needs to be longer.
4.0,Good value for the price. Nice big pockets. Medium fits fine; I'm 5' 5&#34; 130 lbs.
4.0,Nice scrubs but I went with other reviewers advice and ordered a larger size. I normally wear a 2/4 and ordered a medium. They were HUGE. I'll probably try again with a small
4.0,This is my first pair of compression socks and they are very comfortable and well worth the money.
4.0,"I love the sweater it is thinner than I expected, it's more like a pullover. Graphics were great and I received many compliments."
4.0,Beautiful suit but way too big needed for a 15 month old  it looked like a size 4-5
4.0,"The shirt itself is nice & I love the material, I'm just not a personal fan of the way it looks on me."
4.0,"Super cute! Also SQUAT PROOF. I am 5”1 and about 155 pounds. The color is amazing and the design on them is very flattering. Only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because I wish they were more compressive in general since I like a more put together feel but they are comfortable, and the light material seems breathable. The length isn’t too long for my short little legs considering I ordered a large."
4.0,like this neck lace lot....... but the anchor is a little too big for the other two charms<br />the anchor stands out so much you cna't tell there are two other charms
4.0,"Great dress, great material, great fit"
4.0,"These shoes are so cute! I cannot wait for spring to come around so I can rock these bad boys. The only drawback is that the sole of the shoe seems inflexible. It will not keep me from wearing them, though!"
4.0,So far all good. Has held up in the wash.
4.0,"I like the purse and gave it 4/5 stars.  It is soft leather and has high quaility zippers on it.  My one disappointment was in the strap.  The strap was made of cheap looking string and did not totally match the color of the purse.  Fortunatly, I had a beaded neclace that I was able to turn into a cute strap."
4.0,"Like everything about it, except the fact they charge you $21.94 when it comes to my door with a price tag of $17.99 on it"
4.0,"I ordered this for a Bachelorette weekend. I will say I was super nervous to order it after reading the reviews. I got it in pink, and when I tried it on I was a little confused as to how to put it on because it is literally a pair of shorts with two long straps attached to it, and then you wrap them around to make it look like the picture. I got a M because I was worried it would be too big, but I definitely could have gotten a large. It was tight in the coochie area, but still wearable. As for people saying it is see-through... the straps for the boobs are very sheer, but I was able to wear them out during our night on the town bra-less without being able to see my nips. I probably won't wear it again, but for the price, its an awesome little romper, and it definitely got the job done. (I am the one with the long dark hair in the picture)"
4.0,Perfect for my pirate costume- better quality than I expected!
4.0,"I received 9 of the correct 22mm size and 1 that is probably just 18mm, shown at the top of the row with the other 8 that I haven't used yet. The 22mm size is a perfect fit for my Garmin watch. Can't do much with the smaller one as I have no bands that size."
4.0,"It is an oversized fit and flowy in a very flattering way. It was a bit too short to wear to the office without leggings, but it was a very nice look with them on. I came to right about 2 inches my knee, and I am 5'8"""
4.0,Bought this for my cousins birthday. It is really cute but not so much as a necklace I told her to use it as a keychain. Good quality tho
4.0,VERY cute shoes and quite comfy. However  the listing states the shoe is clear and in reality the straps are slightly opaque and the platform is solid white. I was looking for a clear strapped sandal and this wasn't it. If it were truly clear I'd re-purchase them.
4.0,Not very durable but very comfortable
4.0,The print of this dress was not what I expected. I thought it was an animal print( leopard print).
4.0,Very cute and nice material. Fit like the photo.
4.0,"These little necklaces are the cutest. Decent quality, especially for the price. We will likely have 3 of each real soon."
4.0,Good fit and very durable
4.0,"The fabric on this top feels super soft and it was thick enough that it didn't feel like it would be see through if not wearing a bra.  But this top runs small and was too tight in the waist portion.  It would hold my larger chest just fine, but the band around the waist really was nothing like what an XL should be.  Especially if you have curves since then it's all going to just ride up and bunch into a wrinkled band under the boobs.  So you have to have the right body shape for this, and also I'd recommend sizing up a size."
4.0,"Very comfortable, can be a lot of cleavage though."
4.0,"My guy loved them with the exception that there is no opening in the front of the pants when it came time to use the bathroom.<br />He said having to pull the pants down was a bit inconvenient, other than that they were just what he needed."
4.0,Love the color!  only thing is it is pretty thin so does t help squeeze u in and the boob part kinda says when it gets wet. So can show too much of your girls lol otherwise it's ok for price
4.0,I ordered a 2X
4.0,super comfy and warm.
4.0,Beautiful but was too small. Didn’t have larger size
4.0,"I bought this watch as a daily casual/semi-formal timepiece that I wouldn't have to worry about being damaged, lost, or stolen.<br /><br />The package arrived in about a week and in good condition, but it wasn't in protective packaging, only wrapped in plastic.  Fortunately, the watch was not damaged. At first glance, it has a bit of a Carrera ([[ASIN:B001GBMO0Q TAG Heuer Men's CV2010BA0794 Carrera Black Dial Watch]]) design to it, but without the luxury quality. That being said, everything about the watch case looks more expensive than it really is. The dial details are impressive, with the sole exception of the date window, which is a little too small for the date wheel numbers. Also, the dual second hands aren't exactly in sync, but I suppose this can make the watch look like an automatic chronograph at first glance (auto-chronos usually cost over $1000, so this can be a good thing). The glass scratches easily, which is to be expected with a mineral crystal.  The pushers for the month and day functions are good quality, but the crown mechanism is poorly made. It does have three positions: manual wind, date, and time set, but I feel like a few gears are going to break unless I am very gentle with it.  The exhibition case back and Kr&ouml;nen & S&ouml;hne rotor engraving are nice touches, and the mechanical self-wind movement keeps reasonably good time (gains about 4 seconds per day), though I would be cautious with quality control from a Chinese manufacturer.  The power reserve is good, but I haven't exactly measured it. It'll definitely last overnight.<br /><br />The case says it's water resistant, but based on its appearance, I wouldn't test it. It can probably handle a few rain drops but definitely not being submerged.  You get what you pay for.<br /><br />The stainless steel bracelet looks great, but the build quality is average at best.  The links are loose, and the steel brushing isn't very good, though the double locking fold-over clasp was a pleasant surprise.  In retrospect, I probably should have purchased the same watch but with a leather band (Also on Amazon).<br /><br />The watch is eye-catching, and has received a lot of compliments.  Overall, for the ridiculously low price (for an auto-watch), this is an excellent timepiece that looks great and performs acceptably."
4.0,"Love this bag! I missed my chance to grab a pumpkin bag in 2017, so I jumped to get a 2018 version right away! It doesn’t fit my iPhone plus, which sucks, but it’s pretty roomy otherwise!"
4.0,Very pleased with this product.  Worked for what I needed it for.
4.0,"Quality seems good, shipping was fast, looks way too big."
4.0,Hat is as pictured and fit perfectly but its definitely dark brown not OD at all.
4.0,kinda stiff shirts. fits well
4.0,Some of the designs were cut at an odd spot so that you couldn’t tell what they were
4.0,This dress is very pretty. I didn't keep it because it was very heavy for a summer event.
4.0,I gave this 4 stars because the puff are not as big as picture....
4.0,"The dress fits nice.  I ordered one size up after reading reviews and it is perfect.  I am not I fan of the sleeves and may have them tailored, but overall, great dress for the price."
4.0,"These are warm and work great. May be slightly small. I have small, but wide hands and they just barely fit."
4.0,"The keyring inside the leather case is way too small.  Kumeed Team, please adjust (increase) the size of the keyring inside the nice leather case.  I struggled to securely connect my Mercedes-Benz key."
4.0,If you have curves the pants will slip down need more supportive waistband.
4.0,It's a little on the small side and not very breathable. Really cute design though
4.0,Nice but size off a bit. Had to alter.
4.0,"Order a size or 2 up. I usually order smalls but this was TIGHT. I kept it because I actually like a tighter fight and it is surprisingly very comfortable. It's a great shirt to workout in, lounge at home, and I get free drinks everytime I wear it out to a club 😅 I'll probably order again but in a medium. The only reason it's not a 5star review is because the sizing was so off"
4.0,"Worked very well in the beginning, but after 3-4 usage, it doesn’t hold anymore. Otherwise nice shape, discreet, comfortable."
4.0,"My daughter ordered this for herself, and I was pleasantly surprised!  It looks nice, and the whole item is of higher quality than I  expected it to be.....again, I was pleasantly surprised!<br /><br />You can't go wrong, considering it only cost a few buck$."
4.0,Great boot for the price.
4.0,Fit as expected with vibrant colors.
4.0,Nice blouse priced right fit work. The blouse fits as expected.
4.0,"I'm 5'11"" not ""big"" but xl made by most companies are too tight. Fit it is good as a 2x. Not as warm as the other vest I purchased but fits much better. I'm happy overall and like control over heated areas."
4.0,3 rings didnt work but the rest worked fin so I ordered more.. They wont go to waist I'll give them out when I travel again... problem solved.. I was happy never the less.
4.0,"Really nice-looking band. Very glossy black.  It seems to match the Space Black Stainless Steel Apple Watch perfectly. They'd probably sell more of these bands if they mentioned Apple Watch in its description (the Apple Watch can work with all standard 20mm, 22mm, and 24mm bands), it just needs lugs.<br /><br />Something to note is that while this is listed as a 22mm band (and the end links are 22mm), most of the band links are actually 20mm wide. I'd prefer a real 22mm (or 24mm) band!"
4.0,"I wasn’t sure if I would want a pair that had the hole in the bottom, but I’m glad I got these. They a squishy, but not squeaky. They’re comfortable for lounging and running to the supermarket and those type of shenanigans. Got mad compliments from other adults ."
4.0,The night shirt was fine. Next time want to try cotton version.
4.0,"It's a very nice captive bead ring. I used it in my septum. 4 stars because it's a little bigger than I expected, and I don't like that it takes up so much room on my face. It's fine if you don't mind grabbing people's attention."
4.0,definitely great shirts for the $.  shirt material isn't bad at all.
4.0,I like the velcro length adjustment. It lies flat and doesn't show a bump under my shirt.
4.0,This dress is super cute but the material is very thin. I will probably have to wear a tank top/shorts underneath it so it is not inappropriate but it would be cute to wear with tights in the cold. Overall I like the fit and will wear it.
4.0,"UPDATE:<br />I can confirm that the RFID blocking functionality works perfectly every time, even with a Tesla key card.<br />---<br /><br />The Leather Architect wallet looks good, is well-constructed, and for a tri-fold wallet, is reasonably thin and comfortable in the pants pockets.<br />I like the feel and the finish of the genuine leather, and even the stitched blue stripe that adds a dash of color and personality without looking showy.<br />The wallet holds all of my cards, yet is thinner than one or two of my wallets that make me choose which cards to bring.<br /><br />The wallet is not good at holding cash. The cash pocket is sized so close to the width of American currency that each bill has to be gingerly tucked in and aligned. Even with that effort, the wallet cannot fit more than about 3 bills without them crumpling and making the wallet much thicker. If the cash pocket was just 1/4&quot; wider, it would be much more useful for cash.<br />Obviously most transactions today are via credit card or through a smart phone, but there are times when you need to carry cash.<br /><br />Another less significant problem, really more a preference of mine, is that the wallet has a clear plastic ID window. These usually split, get scratched up, and yellow over time. I don't know that I have seen them used more than a handful of times in my entire life. Usually when an ID is required, the person examining it wants to see front and back.<br /><br />This wallet is very good other than for those that frequently carry cash."
4.0,Love it and have received a ton of compliments on it.
4.0,"My daughter wore these for indoor soccer practice and they worked great. Fit well and looked cute. My only gripe is they were super-stiff, even after wearing them in around the house to break them in for 2 days. They remained stiff even after her soccer practice (which is saying a lot considering its pee-wee soccer), but began loosening up. My kiddo didn't get blisters, but her feet are pretty narrow....so if your kid has wider feet or gets blisters pretty easy, order these sooner than you need them so you have time to break them in before using them during a game. Overall, good shoe."
4.0,Fits well and very pretty leather
4.0,Shows way too much cleavage pushing breasts in. Tags were not on bra. Can not return because of this. Contacting amazon
4.0,The silver and white were beautiful.  Fits me and my 10 year old.
4.0,This is a super cute dress for summer. I ordered the 2XL and fit pretty nicely. 🦄 My only problem is that I didn't know what shoes to wear with it.
4.0,Great watch and a time tested design. Excellent value. But too small for a man - I went for the entry level gshock instead for forty bucks and love it. My 3 year old has this one now.
4.0,"Good value, used for brthday party. However there were about 8 duds. I just threw them out. I had more than I needed."
4.0,"You get what you pay for. Nice bit mot the nest quality.  Tore the 1st time I wore the pants, the jacket is still fine but again, I didn't pay very much for the set."
4.0,"I really liked this item, I am only 5'1&#34; and it was a little short (came mid thigh) would be perfect for leggings"
4.0,I love this swimsuit! Pants are slightly too big out only because I’m wide top and small botrom shaped. More Lycra would help
4.0,These arrived and were just what I needed for my son's decade dance.
4.0,Hard to ibe color. A bit thin and clingy
4.0,The belt buckle was larger than I thought and the sizing seemed big but you can adjust it.  It is nice belt and works well on low-rise jeans.
4.0,"So these run pretty tightly with less stretch that I would like, but I expected that. I can get them on but it takes some tugging and perfectly dry skin! What a smart idea though! I haven't seen this type of nylon before! It makes total sense especially if you are working or something and don't have 15 min after using the bathroom to struggle back into your nylons! Great for open toe shoes when you still want something around at least part of the foot to absorb a bit. I cannot stand going totally sockless in anything but really open strappy sandals! It just gets too sticky and ends up messing up the foot bed lining in the shoe!"
4.0,"They are original, specs are on point. Only issue is the packaging could have been better. Box was a bit damaged. Still satisfied with my purchase :)."
4.0,Very pretty and a nice size. Unfortunately one of the loops came off.
4.0,Supple band and doesn’t make me sweat.  The face is pretty and the color I can use all year long with any outfit. It would make a great gift for any age.
4.0,The stones are really green not a faded green as seen on the picture.
4.0,"As soon as I received this, I was impressed at the fabric quality.  It is much nicer than I expected- it's medium thin, but soft and a little stretchy.  Definitely good enough quality to get away with at work.  The style is flattering and I would buy again, maybe in a different color.<br />I think this is meant for a loose slouchy fit, I ordered large but I would get medium next time and still have a nice loosely casual fit - size is pretty true (I'm 34D bust, 5'3&#34;, athletic 140lbs, usually wear M-L)"
4.0,"Nice bracelet, a little on the smaller side.  I would say this would be more for a young person than an adult."
4.0,I use it for everyday errands. It slips on and off easy and looks very special
4.0,"Cute socks. Appears as photographed. Wore once, so far so good."
4.0,A little large but great socks. Keep my feet toasty at night.
4.0,My daughter LOVES these because the material is so soft. I’m not completely thrilled about how tight they are.
4.0,i look great with these on
4.0,They look pretty.
4.0,My only real issue is how the aquarius symbol looks. But they are as pictured.
4.0,Cute simple dress. Fits well
4.0,Smaller than seen... but I love the and can even sleep in them
4.0,"Functional bathrobe. It's not velour, fleece, but with a looped weave "" towel "" fabric. Perfect for drying off after bathing. My son loves it. I like that it dries quickly and is soft enough to be comfy."
4.0,I really liked it worked out great for my Dino costume. I read the measurements and should have know that an XL would still be little snug for DDs and because of the top being snug it did make it too short to wear as a dress. I put some leggings on underneath and overall it worked and i was happy  with it.
4.0,Quiet pretty small earring
4.0,Seems to be good quality.  I would purchase these again!
4.0,Great fit over my prescription lenses. The clips that hold them in place are almost invisible. The wife says they look great and don't even look like clip one. Ordered a second pair to keep in her car.
4.0,"I prefer to use vented golf umbrellas because they're much sturdier than travel umbrellas - but sometimes you just don't want to lug one of those around. This is a suitable alternative. After breaking dozens of cheap umbrellas in slight breezes, I got fed up and bought this one. I've used it several times without incident, in a torrential downpour in Ireland, in wind and rain around home, etc. No issues, no bending inside out, and no rusting (so far). I've had it about 4 months."
4.0,Warm winter hat which fit just as expected. Was satisfied with my order and will try other products from this brand.
4.0,Good material and fits as expected.  Good value for price.
4.0,"If you like your rings large-and-in-charge, this handcrafted Indian ring from Praanjal was made for you!  If you are petite like my lady, you may have to become creative to wear this piece.<br /><br />The ring featured an inner portion that looked like a flower or sunburst pattern, while the outer portion of the ring featured simulated pearls and gold beads.  The ring came packaged in a small plastic bag and an unadorned outer cardboard box (see photo).  The portion that affixed the ring to the finger was a (really cheap-appearing) adjustable metal loop.<br /><br />The diameter of the ring fell just under the circumference of a Kennedy half-dollar coin.  Thus, you needed sizable hands and a love of the unique to wear the ring comfortably.  My lady decided to repurpose the ring since it was far too large for her hand.  She snipped off the adjustable ring portion, and affixed a pin to the back of the disk portion.  Thus, she now had a small, but eyecatching, broach/pin.<br /><br />As a pin, this design worked much better than it did as a ring. Since a hobbyist could make this ring into something new, I give it a tentative recommendation."
4.0,My 10 year old son loves this hat. It's stylish and it keeps him warm. The material is nice and durable. I bought this for him when he went to science camp and he wore it everyday.
4.0,It's good comfortable it's pretty thin
4.0,"Very good product, I get it in time and with the rigth package. it`s verry important for my sonn too.The size was not the one we expect."
4.0,Watch performs as advertised. Great for hiking in the mountains.
4.0,"This is a very nice belt that came in a very nice metal box, which would be great for giving to someone! It has no defects. It runs a little smaller than I expected it to but it still fits. The buckle is high quality and it doesn't seem like the holes will rip like a cheaper belt. It seems very durable and well made. I've certainly paid more for belts in a department store that broke from being worn tightly daily. The stitching is well done and has no stray threads that I could find. The buckle feels substantial and the leather is thick. Hard to believe the claim it's real leather at that price but it seems to be with how it's holding up. Claims it's reversible but its not! Well it is but the buckle isn't which is dumb and uncomfortable. I love the pattern on it. If that buckle would just swivel around it would be awesome! But it loses a star for not!<br /><br />** I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. If my impressions of this product change I will update this review."
4.0,A little lightweight but ok.
4.0,This is a fun ring!  It's simple and has held up under the daily abuse I put my hands through on a regular basis.  I am really enjoying it!
4.0,"Faux wrap, but still a nice dress"
4.0,Good fit overall<br />By the end of the day though they are very stressed out and riding up...
4.0,"The first pair I purchased of  PajamaJeans I purchased fit me perfectly (size med, dark denim color). The second were so small , I couldn't even try them on (same size of course, but a turquoise color). I returned them which Amazon made very easy. It has been a while since I got up the nerve to order again, same size, med,, brown this time). The pair I received this time fit a bit more tight but acceptable and also were a inch or so longer. The first pair has held up through many washes. No shrinkage on either pair I have kept. I am 5' 6&#34;, 150 lbs"
4.0,Great band.  Fits very well and comfortable.  Only reason for 4 stars is I wish the band was a little longer.
4.0,"Good quality, they run a tad small, I normally wear a medium and they are kinda tight."
4.0,Xmas present for granddaughter.  She’s 7 and starting to grow.  Not quite old enough for training bra so thes are perfect!
4.0,"Really liked this dress, hide the areas that needed to be hidden and was completely wrinkle resistant. Only problem was I ordered the wrong size and it didn't comfortably fit my chest. I didn't want to be uncomfortable for the event I needed this for so I returned it and kept another dress that fit better."
4.0,The hat was very comfortable and easy to put on. It was warm and cozy. It was a nice product.
4.0,"These are really cute, but they are quite a bit smaller than I expected. Would be perfect for a young girl."
4.0,Perfect fit comfortable a lot of compliments
4.0,"Purchased in the light blue, in both small and medium after reading the reviews. I normally wear a medium in women's (5'6, 140, athletic build) and while I like my t shirts loose I don't like them over baggy because I layer a lot.<br />The small fit like a larger medium so the medium went back.<br />I wish the design was screen printed but it's vinyl hence the one star off. I'm not sure how well it will hold up to repeated washing and drying without it coming off and I'm not about special caring for a cheap t shirt. It did make it through the first round of washer and dryer fine.<br />The shirt itself is cut nice, not too boxy and a lightweight. It has some stretch and is not see through.<br />Overall a great purchased at this price point and if you're a mountain mama I recommend it."
4.0,a little tight on my wrist! hopefully it stretches out.
4.0,Love big Sunglasses. Love these. Great price. Great quality.
4.0,"I needed a dress for an upcoming Christmas event and this one really is both comfortable and cute. The fabric has a nice amount of stretch to it, especially through the top. As a larger-chested person, I found that this had plenty of room without coming down too low.<br /><br />The shoulders have a strip of elastic and you can wear it on the top of your shoulders or you could even slide it down for an off-the-shoulder look.<br /><br />I'm 5'3 and the skirt falls below my knees. I felt like it was a flattering cut with a more fitted top and a pleated skirt. I ordered an XL, but I probably could have gotten away with a L (I'm a little in between sizes)."
4.0,Excellent for yoga class.  Bought 2 pairs
4.0,Doesn't seem appropriate for outside wear. Kinda thin. Very comfortable. Wear it as pajamas.
4.0,Light material nice fit
4.0,my son loves these no shoes he says they look and feel great.... awesome buy!! i did receive this item as a discount for my opinion
4.0,"It is suppose to fit ages 1-3. My son is 1 and the hat had to be loosened a bit to actually fit him. I don't think it will last until age 3.<br /><br />It's a cute hat, though. I took a star off because you can't read what it says and I had a few loose threads I had to trim."
4.0,Really good looking and fits well.
4.0,"Great keyring, Fits my key fob perfectly. The only thing I did not like was the inside of the leather started to peel"
4.0,"good quality, looks beautiful"
4.0,"Inexpensive, but very cute. “Sheds” a bit when adjusted."
4.0,"It's a very cute wrist band, especially compared to the original Gear S3 wristband. You have to cut to adjust to size. It is a bit loose on my wrist, but if I cut it anymore I fear I won't be able to get it on by myself. It falls off every now and then while I'm ringing or scrapping the store (work in retail). -Lamarcus' wife"
4.0,A little stiff but it fits perfectly.
4.0,"It's ok for the price. The decorations are in two colors: silver and golden as shown in the product picture. But please be aware the decorations are only on one side. It's very basic, don't expect a movie replica. Still I'm sure my daughter will enjoy it."
4.0,"Really nice wallet! The only thing I did not like was the logo on the front, other than that, I had no complaints. It’s exactly as pictured."
4.0,I weigh 135 and had to get an XL
4.0,"I bought this for my daughter who is loves all things gymnastics. She was excited to receive it and loved it from the moment she saw it. The pendant is great quality and the details are fantastic. The only thing I disliked slightly was the chain, but that was easily replaced with a better one and now my daughter couldn't be happier! The package also came quickly and on time. Thanks guys for the wonderful gift. I received this product at a discounted price for an honest review."
4.0,"I like the coverage of the material to go bra-less I ordered a L based on their sizing chart to be sure my front would be completely covered.. I am 5'4"" 150lbs.<br />I like the quality of the top however once you tie up the strings in the back the sides of the top end up with a funny wrinkled up finish - which I don't like. You could probably add double side clothing tape but I haven't yet to experiment with it. Other then that I would give it a 5 🌟. The open feel of the strings in the back gives you an extra touch of sexiness."
4.0,Everyone loved them! Highly recommend for the price
4.0,"This PJ set is comfortable, soft, and pretty. It is a simple design, but fits well, good material, and easy to sleep in."
4.0,"Looks good, the brass looks good, the leather looks good the face looks good. I wind up and set the time when i leave the house. Took me a while to figuire out how to wind up energy correctly, instructions unclear. Turn the knob on the side clockwise, without pulling it out."
4.0,Make sure to wash it right away. It caused my daughter to break out after trying it on but she was fine to wear it after I washed it. I hung it to dry it
4.0,"I've bought more than one Poetic product over the years and have never been disappointed.  They are not as high quality as if you were to purchase a brand name case, but you're also not spending a whole lot of money.  I ended up getting the case for just under $10, but I'll be honest that I'd pay double that any day!<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />I love the addition of the elastic on the back to slip your hand in.  I'm not one to drop my tablet, but this makes it even more less of a chance.  The other nice addition is the Auto Sleep/Wake function.  It doesn't work every single time, but I think that might be an issue with the Nook instead of the case.  Even then it works perfectly probably 4 out of 5 times.  The extra pockets work fine, although I don't personally use them.  Although it doesn't show it on the images, both the one for the HD 7 does also include the micro SD pockets, which are potentially an awesome feature, but I'm not sure how well they work as I haven't purchased one yet.  Finally, the other elastic band that holds it shut or open works great and is a much needed improvement over the past Poetic cases I've bought for other tablets.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />The case is cheap, but it doesn't look cheap (I guess that's a half pro half con) Not so cheap that it'll fall apart within a month, or even a year, but there are certain aspects of it that might disappoint you.  The Nook HD 7 isn't that heavy, so when you set it up horizontally, the case has a problem standing.  You can get it to stand after moving it around/pushing down on it for a bit and watch a video or use a BT keyboard, but if you try to use the touch screen, it'll fall over and you'll have to move it around to get it to stand again.  Your best bet is to pick it up, use it, and set it back down.<br />Related to this when it's folded backwards in reading mode, it folds kind of funky and can get uncomfortable holding if you have bigger hands like I do.  Considering I sometimes read for up to 3 hours at a time, I guess that probably can't be avoided, but if it was designed a bit differently, it wouldn't have been so bad.  Finally, the stitching has started to come loose in the area that it ends.  I don't think this will lead to any problems other than aesthetics, but it is still annoying (and something I've experience in other Poetic cases)<br /><br />All in all I HIGHLY recommend this case.  I bought one for my niece and will continue to seek out Poetic cases in the future!"
4.0,I wish large size items came as larges but it still fits me well just not like I thought it would.
4.0,"Soooo soft! Very lightweight, but still so so warm. The wristbands are a little oddly long, but cuffing them looks great too. I'm a size 12, 179lbs, and bought the XL. I definitely could have gotten the L, or for a more fitted look the M. Very oversized. Love it!"
4.0,Great buy. Love this sweater.
4.0,I like it it was a good gift to my mother.
4.0,Belt loops fell off already whomp whomp
4.0,its pretty just a little to big.  Get your normal size!
4.0,"The fabric is really thin for the top part, but overall everything about the dress is super cute and comfy! When I received the package, I noticed a little hole in the center of the chest where the fabric was perhaps punctured. I decided to keep it instead of returning it because I have cats who will probably tear more of the fabric in due time."
4.0,"I love the color of these shoes, and that they match so much of my daughter's wardrobe. Very pretty design, and seem well made and sturdy. My daughter wears an 8 Toddler, and the 8 is a little big on her, but they do stay on her feet."
4.0,It is a pretty necklace but I actually ordered it because of all the colors that are shown in the picture. The colors really looked like the colors you see from atop of the Ferris wheel at night. The one I received has all clear stones except for every other one is dark blue around the main part of the design. I bought it for my future daughter in law. My son proposed to her at night on the top of a huge ferris wheel.
4.0,"looks amazing, the fabric is very nice. just let it sit for a bit and fluff it after you get it. it then opens up and looks like the pic"
4.0,Hello. I collect and sell rate USA Coins. This loupe is easy to carry in a pocket and can quickly focus on the coin and its details.[[ASIN:B001T4OWZ0 SE 30X Illuminated Jewelers Loupe]]
4.0,"The top of this dress is adorable! I just wish the skirt wasn't as long. It looked shorter in the picture! Very cute for a holiday party! Very flattering! I am 5'5 155 with 36b and ordered a large, and might have been able to do a medium because the fabric is very stretchy!"
4.0,"I bought this as a cheap replacement for my fitbit blaze that started draining battery quickly. the battery life is fantastic, it lasts about 3 days. It seems very accurate with step count and calorie count, which are the most important features to me. My only complaint would be that the sleep tracker is pretty inaccurate. I know I wake up multiple times throughout the night, and the watch will say i slept all the way through the night. It is also wrong about wake up time frequently. But other than that, i love it. the app is user friendly and easy to read."
4.0,"Very elegant and pretty. The material is a bit heavy, but otherwise I love it!"
4.0,It has a really pretty neckline but it’s a little long and kind of boxy.
4.0,I love the dress - My sister fix the slip.
4.0,Super soft and comfortable. Pink color as pictured. I ordered a small and it is a little oversized but very comfortable to layer and feel cozy.
4.0,"Easy and simple to use, something I’ve been wanting for a while."
4.0,"Very good for the price, but some of the crystals are on crooked. If budget is of greater importance, this is a good buy. This is a unique shape, which I like!"
4.0,These sunglasses are awesome. There so durable. There comfy on my ears. The bottom of the lense is not dark. But that's not a big problem. I would buy them again 😁
4.0,wish the circles were a little smaller
4.0,I was hoping to get more colors and less of the same pair. I gut 6 pair that are very similar. Overall though I'm very pleased.
4.0,"I’m always searching for stylish readers. These are definitely stylish but just don’t look great on me.<br /><br />The frames are a great variety of look but they are wider and thicker than I prefer. The lens itself is good quality and I’m sure on the right face they would look fantastic.<br /><br />They come with cases for each pair as well as a cleaning cloth. Overall good glasses but not for my petite face shape and size.<br /><br />Please View my Included Picture.<br />I Hope you find my Review Helpful, Thanks for Reading."
4.0,"This is truly a blanket type garment, there are not “arm holes”. For myself, at 5’0 and 150 pounds, this is a bit big. The front corner pieces drape down nearly to my knees and I feel somewhat frumpy in it. The material is very nice quality and the pattern and colors are nearly identical to the picture. I’m not sure if I will wear this out or if it will be a closet sitter, due to the overwhelming amount of fabric that flows everywhere when it’s on. I’m giving only 4 stars for the fact it doesn’t come in different sizes."
4.0,Fabric isn't the softest but its alright...
4.0,very strong !
4.0,"Love the material, style of the shirt. Just wish it wasn't so long and and the sleeves either. I am 5'9 and the sleeves run pretty decently past my wrist, I like wearing very snug clothes and figured this brand is Asian sizing so it would fit more snugly..."
4.0,It’s thin and the picture is a bit blurred. It did come with some filters to slide in though. I don’t dislike it but I’m not wowed. It’s pretty standard for what quality I expect from China though I hadn’t realized it was from China
4.0,Nice hoops but the clasps are a little hard to open and close.
4.0,Nice fabric and lining.  A little bit smaller than the usual XL. Sleeves a tad long but easily fixed. Paired it with navy slacks for the office.
4.0,Good product. Only wish was lining in the top.
4.0,Only comment - the color is a little orange.<br />Love the way the bag carries and the compartments are great.
4.0,"Nice for exercise, and will be useful in the winter for wearing to the gym.  They fit well and wick away the sweat quite well. Thank you."
4.0,Did not like waistband
4.0,Cute dress can’t wait to wear this summer
4.0,"I like the fit and flow. Not exactly as pictured,  but cute"
4.0,The light is useless.
4.0,"This shirt is comfortable and fits well. It's on the small side, but I like it!"
4.0,"As other reviewers have warned, this pendant is quite small but it is lovely and appears to be well made.  Not a fashion statement that cries out for attention but one that is more subtle and soft.  A gift for my 18-yr old niece's birthday - she will LOVE it!"
4.0,I bought these for my son who was washing cars outside as part of his job. He came home with wet shoes that I just couldn't get dry over the heater vents. I bought these after reading the reviews of many kinds. These do work. They take a little time (hours sometimes)- but they do get the shoes dry. It has temp settings which is very nice. His leather Romeos dried in a couple hours. It was nice to be able to dry them out before they could start to smell!
4.0,I mean they work that’s all I got to say about them.
4.0,Girlfriend seemed to like it. I think it looks good on her.
4.0,"This swimsuit is such a cute swimsuit!<br />I've always wanted a basic, white one-piece to keep in my collection.<br />I really like the one sleeve design.<br />It's so cute and trendy.<br /><br />It's good quality & material is well-made.<br />It's soft & comfy for the most part!<br /><br />I would suggest ordering a size up, it does run somewhat on the small side.<br />My only complaint is that it does tend to go up my butt.<br />It may just be because mine is huge, but just wanted to give a warning.<br />Other than that, it's a cute one-piece."
4.0,Very classy looking skirt!
4.0,My 19yo daughter loves this dress.. she is gifted in the northern region.. And tiny everywhere else.. This dress fits her like a dream. she can let it out in back or tighten it.. She's a 6 and I at first got a small.. fit but snug.. then a Med.. fit wonderfully!!!!!! hangs nicely!!
4.0,What a cute handy tote purse....it's nice...trendy!
4.0,The chain is thin but sturdy so I hope it will last.
4.0,I bought this dress to wear at an all inclusive...it's exactly as pictured. It was a bit tight across the bust but other than than that it's perfect.
4.0,"This dress is stunning! Exactly what I was looking for to take our family photos in this fall.  The material is lightweight, but still looks elegant. I think it will transition well to everyday office attire.  I generally wear a size 18W, however that was not available. So I took a chance based on the reviews of others stating the dress runs slightly large. I ordered the 16W and fits like a dream!  The sleeve length is perfect. The material is nice and stretchy. I feel like the dress will be very comfortable. The color is exactly as pictured. My only complaint is that the neckline seems like it won't stay in place because the fabric is so light. I'm sure with a little double sided tape all will be well. I'm also considering a small petticoat or something of the like to puff out the skirt a little and give it a more retro feel."
4.0,Cute and well made. I just wish it was all on one latch.
4.0,Such a pretty dress. I was nervous because it said Asian sizing. I ordered an extra large and I wear women's 6. It's a bit too big ordering a large now and shipping back one of them
4.0,work good for night riding.
4.0,Useful and compact.
4.0,"It's cute but on the longer side (fits me below the knee), wish it was a little shorter"
4.0,My little boy looks so handsome in this!
4.0,Very nice. It didn't come with a chain but the amber ring is cute.
4.0,"I'm 5' 10&#34; and size 4. Based on all the other reviews, I ordered the XXL. It was still an inch above the ground, but it was long enough for me to keep. (I also ordered the pink skirt in L, but it was only to my ankles and wouldn't work) I would have preferred it a bit longer, and also the elastic ended up being loose enough for me to pin (the pink skirt did NOT need to be pinned, but was too short), so it seems the waist size does go up with size. Though it's not perfect, it was a better option than others and I'm overall happy with it."
4.0,"It is very beautiful and I like it, a little thin but it's fin"
4.0,"The patterns on the socks are adorable, but the socks are a little tight. They would better fit people with smaller-sized feet. For reference, I am a size 8. They don't stretch much and I am very nervous that there will be a hole in the toe after a few wears."
4.0,Comfy glasses
4.0,"I bought these frames from my eye doctor and i love them.  They are very light weight and the most comfortable I've ever worn.  They have a classy, &#34;rich&#34; look too.  The weight makes me feel like I don't have glasses on at all.  The price here is awesome!!  I paid a lot more for them.  The only downside is that they are delicate and have to be handled carefully.  If you are a take your glasses off and throw them on the desk type of person, find sturdier frames. Otherwise, you'll love them."
4.0,This ring is really pretty but the width doesn't look good on short fingers like my own so haven't worn it yet. The size is correct and it arrived quickly.
4.0,"couldn't get a new battery for a watch, at the price paid, and lets me know the time."
4.0,"I love these plugs! The only complaint I have is that they are a tad small; I'm at a 0g, and I find that they're constantly slipping out of my ears while I sleep or am active. But with stone plugs that are slippery that's somewhat expected anyways, especially when you've had your holes gauged for so long like me. Other than that, the quality is amazing! They're all so cute and look exactly like the picture! Would definitely order more, just maybe a size up!"
4.0,"Delivery and quality was good, but the size seems small compared to other garments of similar design."
4.0,"Sizing is way off. I am 5'10&#34;, 155 lbs and wear size 12. I need a XXL in this to layer as it is way too small. And I never wear larger than a L. So go up 2 sizes. If you are a smaller person than me, it is a nice soft shirt that I would like to have worn."
4.0,"satin net is of good quality, but, the adjuster doesn't stay put. you'll have to sew or pin it to stay."
4.0,"I like how clear and sharp,everything much easier  to see."
4.0,"good product, just a little bit tight."
4.0,a little tight getting on but for the price I can't complain. shipping was a while.
4.0,Nice shoes. Really pretty.
4.0,"A little big, but it's still cute."
4.0,I used this as part of a costume and it worked out great. It was nicer than I was expecting.
4.0,"Fashionable and stylish. Comfy too but I doubt this one will work well for the midwest winter. The base material is to thin. That being said, for spring or maybe for a southern winter, this one would do just fine...<br />If my review helped you in any way, please let me know by clicking the ""helpful"" button below.  Any questions you may have, feel free to ask… Thank you!"
4.0,Beautiful dress! It surpassed my expectations and my daughter looked beautiful in it for her 8th grade dance!
4.0,"I really like this. The material is warm and soft and all the pockets are great. The problem is I am caught between a M and a L. The medium is fitted well but the arms and shoulders are too tight for good movement, and when zipped the chest is snug. The large fits more comfortably but has an awkward amount of room in the stomach area. When zipped its very loose around the torso and when unzipped there is a lot of extra fabric that kind of sticks out. If that were taken in a bit it would be perfect."
4.0,"They look a little cheap, but they are inexpensive, so I wasn't surprised. I gave them to my eight year old niece for Christmas, and she literally hasn't take them off in the three weeks since, so I guess an eight year old would probably give them 5 stars."
4.0,"I don't usually wear orange, but I love this dress! I usually wear a size 2-4, so I bought the small. It is a little loose, but not noticeably. I could have bought an XS, and it would have fit a little more snug. I don't mind the looser fit, though. I'm 5'6&#34; and I can wear it with flat sandals (I'm wearing them in the picture)."
4.0,It does run small as the reviews said. I wore it w/white pants. Looked cute.  The color was very vibrant and it was comfy to wear. I wish I'd bought larger size to wear as a dress. Overall good buy for the price.
4.0,This dress is very pretty! Based on all the reviews and pictures I was in love. Purchased it and it come quicker than expected. Im 5'8 and I ordered a Large and it came below my ankles! So that was a huge plus in my book!<br /><br />The only reason I didnt rate it 5 stars is because it was smelly. I didnt wash it before I wore it. --I bought it for an out of town wedding-- I packed it in my suitcase in a garment bag and it stunk up all my clothes lol I had to go and buy fabric refresher spray while I was on vacation. So that was a pain.
4.0,"Great quality hoodie, definitely runs a size smaller though. I bought a XXXL and it fits exactly like several of my XXL hoodies. So don't be afraid to get this, just be sure to buy a size up from where you normally would."
4.0,A tag too tight but I like them.
4.0,Nice and thick. The stitches is off a little bit. Lent was heavy so we used a roller to get it off after going through the wash. I recommend not laundry drying.
4.0,"This gown came packaged in a small flat envelope, it smelled  like chemicals. The sheer material was full of static and flat. The dress went directs my to the dry cleaner and came back gorgeous. I purchased the hoop skirt that was recommended it was a little short it made the bottom of the dress awkward."
4.0,"Everything was perfect about the dress except that I ordered and small and when it came in I tried it on and it was still really big. Luckily I sew, so I just sewed in side darts and now it fits but bottom line the bust runs really big."
4.0,Cool masks the kids loved them.
4.0,It’s a nice set but the color isn’t the same as the picture online
4.0,My husband actually enjoyed dressing up for Halloween this year.
4.0,Looks and feels very well. A quality product.
4.0,Oversized!!!--I tried on every hat I wear to choose size. Very inaccurate sizing. Oversized by far!!!
4.0,They feel and look good
4.0,"It is very comfortable, I like the fit and look.  The pockets are nice!  The fabric is very easy to wrinkle so that is a bummer for me, I do not like to iron!"
4.0,It's great! ! Love it
4.0,"I don't have a problem with the product. The watch is pretty and is working efficiently, purchased for a reasonably economical price. But I rather a seller not contact my personal email  implying I wrote a negative review. The product being a nurse's lapel watch. At no point in time did I write a review, specially a negative one. It's strange I was instructed to answer to the link they provided,  which I did not when providing this information. My advice is to answer any doughts directly through the Amazon app when someone similar happens. That's why a 4 instead of 5."
4.0,"I love the bathing suit! I am 5 ft 2 in and weigh about 140 pounds. According to the online size chart, I was in between the sizes. The instructions say to order up if in between, but I ordered the one that was most my size which was the XXXL. It happened to be the smaller size out of the two that I was in between on. It fits pretty good. I did here a tiny bit of popping the first time I tried it on, but I do not see any seams ripping or loose thread, so not sure where the noise was coming from (however one of the straps has a whole it in, that will probably get bigger and rip). I was a little nervous about the crouch area as it looked so long. I'm short and when I. Held it up against me, the crouch hung down pretty low on my legs. Once on, it fits great. The straps at the top are adjustable so you can make it as tight or as loose as you need depending on your bust. It also has a strap that ties underneath the bust, so again, you can make it as tight or as loose as you desire. I ordered the red, navy blue and white suit. Instead of red, it also comes in yellow. The material feels like typical swim suit material-not super thin or cheap feeling. It has a little padding for &#34;the girls&#34; to cover up the nipple area. It also has mesh where you stomach goes holding up the bottoms, but it is all one piece. I like this, but I don't at the same time because it's hard to remove a wet bathing suit to use the bathroom. It would be nice if the bottoms where separate for that reason. I have not actually used it in a pool yet as it is still a bit chilly outside and not quite swimming weather.<br />All in all, I would recommend this bathing suit.<br />I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for a product review. The thoughts and opinions expressed above are of my own and were not influenced by any means by the discount."
4.0,"The bracelets are fine, but they are too big for girls.  I have to figure out how to make it smaller now."
4.0,"It is a very pretty dress! I am glad though I ordered size Large. I am 5'2&quot; and usually wear M, granted I am large on top. I would recommend you order at least a size up! Other than that it is well made and looks very close to picture."
4.0,Order a size up…fits a bit too small
4.0,"The hat is great quality, but I wish the gloves were made better. The shirt ran a little small for my 5 year old."
4.0,I love these crystals. They are so beautiful. I do have think I will return the punk quartz and get the tumble quarts because I don't care for the thin string it's on .
4.0,Probably the most comfortable underwear I have right now.  Soft cotton and stretchy material make for a good combo! Good job putting these together.
4.0,"Love the style of this dress. Ordered L which fit everywhere except yoke & sleeves. I'm busty, but it was too big in that area which required professional alterations. Would buy same style dress again, but would perhaps order M to see if yoke & sleeves would be a better fit & not require alterations."
4.0,"Loves these bows!  Fit great without leaving a mark on my baby's head.  There are a couple colors that won't get used, but besides a few odd colors they are beautiful!"
4.0,The dress was sewn well.  It fit me slightly larger than expected. The fabric a little on the thinner than I expected as well. I got a lot of compliments though!
4.0,"My son really wanted these for his Halloween costume. They didn't cost too much, so I figured why not. He wears them EVERY day. They plug in to charge, but he hasn't charged them for a while now. They didn't always work well 100% of the time, but that doesn't bother me much since they were so cheap and I feel he's getting use out of them."
4.0,"This is a very nice jean jacket. It is well-made with reinforced seams It seems very durable. It is not too stiff, as some jean clothing is. This jean jacket has a button front, two generous breast pockets and two deep side pockets. It also has two very large hip pockets on the inside of the jacket.  It is fairly lightweight but warm. It has a contrasting collar of faux leather. That adds a nice touch. It is machine washable and dryer safe. It runs small, though. It is made in China."
4.0,Really cute dress. I bought it for my daughter to wear on Halloween for her Wednesday Addams costume. It is really thick so it will definitely keep her warm. It runs a little big on and is kinda heavy. She will have to grow into this dress but it's so cute I have no problem with that. I would recommend this dress for winter months or cool fall days.
4.0,"Course, he already broke one of the blades off and we still have 16-days to Halloween!!!  But that’s on him!!!!  Great product, great quality"
4.0,Not for busty women.
4.0,"This two piece pajamas are without a doubt cute. They are well cut/sewn with a fashion forward plan, and the fabric is soft and stretchy. We ordered a medium and it fits as expected. The fabric was a little thicker and thus, warmer than expected, so this is obviously better for autumn and winter seasons. Of course, that was the intention, as these pjs are adorned with little Christmas trees. If these were &lt;$20, I would have given 5 stars and purchased more of them. However, at $30, the value is questionable-- especially when they will only be worn for 1-2 seasons each year."
4.0,"Beautiful color and look. Runs a little bug in the waist. Snags/pills very easily. I've worn it 3 times and is starting to look a little shabby, but is still wearable. Worth the price."
4.0,"This tank top is the softest most comfortable tank top I own.  It is so stretchy that it will fit anyone. It is definitely the perfect maternity tank top because it will stretch with your belly and, because it is seamless, it won't cause any odd pressure points or be uncomfortable for you.  It is also very long, so you won't have to worry about having enough fabric to cover your baby bump when you near the end of your pregnancy.  However, I actually bought the top for normal wear, as I am not currently pregnant, but man do I wish I had this tank when I was prego!<br /><br />The coral color is very pretty and this tank will make a perfect camisole/under shirt for me for summer.  My only complaint about this tank top is that, if you are on the heavier side like me, it does not fit nice and loose like it looks in the picture.  It is very tight and revealing so I won't be able to wear it just by itself.  But it will look really great under some of my shorter tops because it is plenty long enough to peak out from underneath and create some nice contrast.<br /><br />Overall, I think this tank top is perfect for pregnancy as well as for everyday wear for someone who isn't pregnant, as long as you're not worried about showing off your figure ;)<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. These opinions are 100% my own and have not been influenced in any way. I am in no way obligated to leave a positive review."
4.0,My daughter just loved this. She has been asking for this and it just fits her right.
4.0,"Nice, the only problem I had was that I ordered purple but the color was light enough to be mistaken as clear"
4.0,Need to make 4xL
4.0,Rating sunglasses_not shoes!
4.0,"Hat is very good looking and constructed well.  Only flaw, not made in USA.  Sad that a product displaying American Flag not made here."
4.0,Cute and light. Would recommend.
4.0,Definitely a little off looking - you can tell it's not official but it still looks really good.
4.0,"The design and pigment are gorgeous. Have gotten many compliments on it. Was hoping for something a bit looser and slouchier, though; will say this company sizes a bit small."
4.0,Great value watch. Has an expensive look. Shipped on time.
4.0,Lightweight and great for layering.
4.0,I love my robe but got charged more money for shipping.
4.0,"The fabric has a soft buttery feel on your skin and the fit is perfect. The shirt is attractive and flattering on. However, the fabric is<br />also very thin and see through. I found the I need to wear a full tee-shirt under it or it just looks tacky."
4.0,It does what its supposed to.
4.0,Very nice bag but I am missing the scrap
4.0,"These are great in door slippers. I don't wear them outside, but they are pretty comfortable and the insides are soft. I have wide feet, but have no problem with them at all. I will definitely buy another pair of these if they get ruined."
4.0,"Needed this to wear on a lanyard.  It does the job, pretty easy to read, good quality watch for the price."
4.0,"Loved the scarf didn't love the  inch long snag but I'm not going to go through the return process  for that,other than that the scarf is very nice and pretty,well worth the money!!"
4.0,The hat is pretty thin but does an alright job as far as warmth. The only real benefit for me is that with it being so long it doesn't mess up your hair like most hats.
4.0,"Update - The company saw my review and provided great customer services. Much appreciated!!!<br /><br />Even though I bought this two sizes up it does not fit as large as it does the model. The fabric is not soft, and it is a darker shade of grey. I do not recommend this product."
4.0,"Top part slightly larger and requires adjusting. Overall though, very nice dress. Good stretch"
4.0,"I ordered this a few weeks ago & when I got it today, I freaked out a bit when I noticed it was a size small. I didn't remember what size I ordered but usually when the item comes from China, I always order up a size or two. BUT, that wasn't the case this time! The 6/8 that I apparently ordered (it was just marked &#34;small&#34; on the tag) fit PERFECT! It's a thin material, but doesn't feel cheap, just feels comfy. I am 5'6&#34; and 115 lbs & the 6/8 fits beautifully."
4.0,"I like it and the clock is working, but it lacks the aged look that I saw in the image. Probably wishful thinking."
4.0,"I'm 5'2 and 160lbs (post pregnancy). I bought a size Med & it fits great, but I def need a belt otherwise it's shapeless. I plan to wear a tank top under & leggings otherwise it's way too revealing. But overall very pretty & arrived in a few days. Reminds me of much more expensive brands."
4.0,"As for my first impression definitely love the colors and how it fits. It is tightly fitted, (which I believe it’s suppose to be for its purpose), but I decided to size up which make it still fitted, but not hugging my skin. The fabric is not see through nor it’s super thick, just right. So far so good!"
4.0,"ordered these running boots, used them first time in 2 feet of snow. kept my feet dry and warm. comfortable for running. a little heavy, but warm feet makes you forget about the bulkiness of the boot. well worth buying."
4.0,really pretty and &#34;spectacular.&#34; it is quite heavy so be prepared!
4.0,Pretty light. I travel alot but have only used it one time. We will see.
4.0,"The fabric is a touch stiff, not like the other shirts offered by this seller. Still a great shirt though!"
4.0,"Looks nice and appears to be good quality.  It was a gift to my daughter, she hasn't had it very long but good news is still no green skin :-)"
4.0,These fit perfectly and are very flattering. I have only hung dry then to keep their shape and have them last as long as possible. But they are already getting a little too worn for how much ware I have put in them. I would still consider buying them again.
4.0,"I got this as a gift for a friend so I haven't personally used this and just seen it through the package and it's cute and sweet, but it doesn't have that shiny of a look."
4.0,"Very nice ear warmers. They sometimes get pushed off if I am wearing a scarf or a coat with a collar, but overall, very comphy and cozy. I can wear them at the same time I wear my glasses. The really keep the wind out, but don't totally block sound. They don't fold up, but stay in the shape pictured, so I did not pack them on my recent trip abroad, but they do work very nicely for hikes and walks and going to/from work."
4.0,Outfit was cute but to big.
4.0,"I really like the design and the crepe paper-like fabric. It doesn't drape as nicely as it does in the photo. I wanted to try going down a size, ordering in the blue & white, but it was no longer available so I guess I'll never know."
4.0,"This hoodie is great, good quality for the price (as far as first time wear as far as I’m aware) and very comfortable. The hood is a bit big for my liking but overall great hoodie :)"
4.0,"(Andy's girlfriend here, in case his name shows up) -<br />I LOVE these! I have only worn them once so far. The only downfall is that they were a little bit too tight right when I put them on (only reason for the 4-stars). I walked around in them for a few minutes with the tag on, and the tightness didn't bother me enough to want to return them. If you don't want skin tight, maybe go a size up. Maybe it is just the material, but most of my yoga pants have a little bit more breathing room than what these did. All in all, they were rather comfortable all day and I got compliments on them when I wore them to a party that night! I recommend these."
4.0,Truly as described!
4.0,My breasts are full on bottom but lack fullness on top. This bra is very comfortable and fits well but the elastic on top will sag and pucker if you're not even fullness or full on top.
4.0,It's a nice watch. It looks like it's quality. The wearer can tell it's fragile though so be careful wearing it. I actually bought this for my wedding since me and my fiance's rings are rose gold I thought that this would be a good accessory. The color matched up pretty well.  My one complaint is that when I got it in the mail there was a sticker attached to the clasp and when removed it some of the paint also removed from the watch. All in all it was worth the money just don't wear it a lot.
4.0,I real love this top ! I love russhed(tyo) clothing! When you have a little extra here and there. I really has a complimentary fit !
4.0,Velcro top is very stiff
4.0,the glasses are fully mirrored which is what I was looking for but after a day of wearing they seemed a bit larger than before. Maybe it was just me but this product is over all GREAT !
4.0,Fit as expected but was shorter than expecting it to be
4.0,Looks just like the photo.  It is longer in the back (below bum) soft stretchy material...very comfortable
4.0,"Kids use for covering during covid pandemics.  Tighter on my 13 & 15 year old.  Fits perfect on my 8 & 11 year old.  Seams on one of them tore after a few uses, had to reinforce seam with extra thread.<br /><br />Overall, great colors and kids love using them when we are out and about with no complaints from them."
4.0,"I bought this dress a size up so the cups can fit my boobs better. I’m 5ft 8in and weigh about 160lbs. The large would have fit me, but I ordered a size up knowing I can tailor it down. The reason I’m giving 4 stars is because the straps for the pentagram were very confusing. No matter which way I twisted and turned them, one side was still twisted too much. The buckle for the back neck was not put on properly. I had to tear a seam in the straps to restring it together so it didn’t look so twisted up and I had to resew on the buckle (which involved poking a hole for it). It was a two hour ordeal trying to figure out the straps and then sewing and fixing them. There was an elastic strap sewn on where the buckle was, but I took it off because it dig into my neck. Now it looks great and the material is not transparent at all, but I really shouldn’t have to fix the straps like that."
4.0,I like it especially when I don’t have pockets. Having a pocket in the scarf was different. Most people who sees it liked I just want to say if the pocket was longer it will be better.  In that way I can push the phone 📱. More.
4.0,My 9 y/o daughter loves it.
4.0,Pattern is nice and leggings ate comfortable.
4.0,"Bought for a female. I need aluminum frames bc of metal/nickel allergy and I didn't want to spend a lot. The glasses look good, are light weight, built well and really work in the sun.  They are a little too wide/loose around my head but I'm using them mainly to drive so it's no problem."
4.0,"It came in very good condition and looks exactly like how it does on screen, though it looks a little bit cheap on the clip."
4.0,Fits nice. Thin material.
4.0,The mask is very well made  and it got here faster than I thought it would
4.0,"it was alright but missing a few small details, like the blue stripes on the socks and the star on her headband. came earlier than expected tho."
4.0,The strings always comes untied
4.0,I like the lightweight material of the masks. I wear mine at work and it’s a hot environment And I had no issues breathing. The material is soft and did not bother my skin. Only reason for 4 stars is because I feel like the masks didn’t ‘give’ or stretch as much as they should. Seemed a little snug and I have a fairly small head. That would be my only complaint. But great quality and quantity for the price.
4.0,"These were a part of 4 Christmas hats for a family.  They fit children well, adults a little tight. But wait until the Christmas card comes out for next year!  A definite hit for 2014!  Came promptly, packaged well."
4.0,"Love the fit! Fits exactly how they are supposed to. The material is cheap, but works for what I got them for."
4.0,This hat is definitely great for protection from the sun. It's a little bigger than it looks so I gave it a four star. I bought three different colors.
4.0,Wish it had ear loops
4.0,Fit big but great and comfty
4.0,"I like this shirt a lot but since i mostly use it for bike riding the only thing I don't like is that the hands covers are not held fast, so I don't get protection from the sun on the back of my hands."
4.0,"looks great, keeps the wind at bay"
4.0,"This shirt is so cute but be warned.  I usually wear a medium and sometimes size small in shirts.  I ordered an XL in this and it was still very snug in the arms.  Thank God I have thin arms and was able to wear it anyway.  Speaking of arms, one sleeve was TIGHTER than the other.  I've never seen anything like it, but it was not noticeable because both sleeves are tight.  I made this work because it was so cute.  I wore this with a black skirt, pumps and Mac's Ruby Woo lipstick and got compliments all day."
4.0,"Best watch I have ever owned.  Stylish, futuristic.  A little bit so links had to be taken off.  A little difficult to put on but awesome."
4.0,"I like my new elephant shirt.  The color of the shirt is a grayish taupe color and will match most any bottom, especially since it is a neutral solid color.  I really purchased this top because of the beautiful elephant print on the front.  This is a high quality transfer and not a cheap iron on.  My daughter loves elephants and I'm hoping to share this with her.  It has a loose fit and is so soft.  Recommend.<br /><br />I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review"
4.0,Too small to fit around my sons (8 year old) head comfortably but my fault for not measuring his head. For the price it was worth the try.
4.0,"I like this dress - it's comfortable, summery/beachy and is a cute style. I ordered a 2XL and a 3XL because I was worried about these dresses running small. They're both a little too large on top. The 2XL is OK. I will probably return the 3XL and order a smaller size (maybe just XL). They are really cute and I will be wearing them during summers/at the beach.<br /><br />I ordered the star print and the elephant print and both look really nice/fun."
4.0,"They are really comfortable. In other words, not really strong belly control. Pockets are a plus! The only thing I didn't like was that the ankles are a little wide... won't give you the perfect silouete around them. Overall, good product."
4.0,"I am 5'5 150lbs and went for the L, great fit!"
4.0,Looks great and love to wear it
4.0,"My 8 year old picked this out to wear to a fancy birthday party. I was skeptical about how it would be based on the amazing low price, however, it was a WIN WIN! She looked beautiful in it.  There was only one tiny issue, but no one noticed it at all. The floral area on the front was not completely sewed on... but it never fell off and she got her wear out of it. Good Buy."
4.0,"This is a very nice lounge set. However, the top was more fitted at the bottom than I’d like so it doesn’t hang loose as is shown in the photo. The sleeves are more of a balloon sleeve.  The bottoms fit great."
4.0,"&#34;Yeah, it's neat&#34;, she said."
4.0,I like it but it fits as a size large
4.0,"I'm a size 12 and I was able to use them. They are very light weight so they are not to sturdy, meaning, I wouldn't use them for nicer shoes. However for casual leather shoes and the like, it works perfectly."
4.0,HAT FIT FINE.  MATERIAL SEEMS DURABLE.  WILL PURCHASE AGAIN WHEN NEEDED.
4.0,Nice enough for price. Took forever tho
4.0,My grandsons' smiles were worth the kinda high price.
4.0,Very cute set except for the weird tree because you would think they would be Christmas tree but it's not but still a cute cheap set that got to wear different ones each week during Christmas
4.0,"Not bad. Doesn't fool anyone it's real fur, but it's sewn up as well as if it were...good lining, etc. Prompt shipping, well packaged. Real fur has more gloss, but this looks pretty good, for the price."
4.0,"When I opened the packaging, the smell was fierce! Stank to the high heavens of some type of acrid, chemical fumes. It really smelled terrible and I was little taken aback. However after hanging out in the open air for a few days, the smell has dissipated. I am going to hand wash it in some industrial grade laundry detergent and fabric freshener. I think should do it. Otherwise, the material is stiff and nice, the pattern quite attractive."
4.0,Great product for the price. But I wish it was a little bendy to shape over the glasses. Overall a good product.
4.0,"i thought i was getting a bigger size by getting a 2x. still to small. I am a pants size 18. Not for women with hips, thighs and booty."
4.0,"My wife was really excited to get to try these. She has never had any lingerie that she liked waring. Most things were too uncomfortable. When we found these she thought they would be perfect, not only for behind closed doors, but for everyday use as well. The package no more than arrived than she changed into them.<br />The first thing she noticed was that they were a little too long. They went up the entire length of her leg with more room to go. They are elastic enough that it is ok, but they are definitely designed for taller women. The grippers that come from the belt to the stockings are a bit awkward to use, but they hold quite well.<br /> The material used in the product seems to be good quality. They don’t appear to be cheaply made, which is surprising given the low price point. And, they are definitely sexy.<br /> If you have any interest at all in this type of garment, then by all means, give this a shot. I would recommend this product to anyone! I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my fair and honest review."
4.0,I do love it. It was a bit larger than I imagined. I put in on my middle finger and it is georgious!
4.0,Good quality made ring however very short glow time.
4.0,These are great. I'm a 5&#34;6 and bordering 4-6 and these fit like a glove!
4.0,I thought I might be able to ride my bike wearing this but it's not really see-through. I might cut holes out for my eyes.
4.0,The dress is not cheaply made. It is good quality. I was really inbetween sized and got the medium. Really wish I got the small. It got to me quickly without issues.
4.0,I would like the fabric to be of higher quality.
4.0,"Beautiful.  Arrived with a small hole, but I could cover it so I kept the item.  Knocked off one star for the hole."
4.0,"I love this piece, it is a very pretty piece."
4.0,"To be honest, I had bought this dress after i failed to find anything in the stores. I was looking for something silver for an event. This is somewhat metallic greyish silver. But it looked perfect for the occasion. the fitting was nice . A little lose from the underarms . The strap quality is not the best."
4.0,Awesome band for the price
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:f34f29bc916d5b4d59abae91576d5292]] way too big around waist, stayed up for squats but causal walking makes them fall down. insta is akingsley_ 5’8 & 220 lbs also there is no butt scrunch"
4.0,"Great hoodie, especially for the price.  I like that it is not promoting something.  Fits right for a big guy."
4.0,Works fine my purposes. Using it with a rectangular half umbrella for my large south facing living room window.
4.0,It will work for the joke picture for our Christmas cards. Somewhat small for our 16 month old who is 25 pounds and 33inches.
4.0,"Well made and very, very warm."
4.0,"Been wearing it for a few weeks showered with it my ankle isnt green and it’s not uncomfortable, fits good , pretty good quality as well"
4.0,"Fit as expected, very girly n feminine, I like it and would recommend"
4.0,"I wear a size 7 1/4 hat and these feel kinda of snug, might get annoying after a long day unless they stretch out a bit."
4.0,"These boots are so cute and very reasonably priced. My 14-month old has only been walking for a couple months, so she still falls quite a bit and will also still crawl every now and then. I found that she walked okay in them, but since she was crawling around and getting up and down and twisting around on the ground so often, the boot shaft doesn't really keep the shoe on that well and the boots kept sliding off. I returned them for now, but will likely order a pair next year when she's a more experienced walker."
4.0,Great shirt. It arrived really quick too!
4.0,Love the color.😊
4.0,Perfect!  My girls love Beanie boo's and these were great Easter gifts!  Super cute!
4.0,"The fit is great , long enough , good flow but material is thick"
4.0,Great hoodie for the money
4.0,The Kiwi design is painted on in shiny black paint.
4.0,The fabric is thin and not terribly soft. My son still likes wearing it but he has to wear a long sleeve shirt under it to keep it comfortable.
4.0,"This hat was purchased for my husband.  He has wanted this style for a while.  It was one of his Christmas gifts!  He really likes it!  It's comfortable, lightweight, very warm, and just right fro those cold windy days!  Thanks for helping me to make my hubby happy!"
4.0,"I ordered these boots for my wife for Christmas. She does have a somewhat flat foot, so I had her try them on when they came in to be sure they would fit. Unfortunately, the drop from the heel to the toe is pretty substantial in these boots and resulted in a very uncomfortable fit around the arch of the foot. She does own another pair of Corral boots without this issue, so I was disappointed with these. However, they are still high quality boots, and the picture is accurate."
4.0,"Great product, excellent quality."
4.0,"I'm a slim petite, and I wanted something to drape over my bare arms in the hot sun of SE Asia while on a vacation.  This did the job well.  To get 5 stars, it would have to be about 6 inches wider - it's a long narrow piece of material.  I wouldn't wear this as shown, because I'm too short, but I did stash it in my travel purse and pulled it out numerous times to drape over my bare arms and legs - on whichever side was in the sun.  Perfect!  I also soaked it in water to cool me off in Hue, wrapping in over my head and across my neck.  I didn't care about looking cute, I cared about sun protection and not getting heat stroke.  This worked great, and I'd use it again.  It was just wide enough to cover both my bare arms when draped across my shoulders.  If you're super tall, or a regular size toward plus size, I might consider another of their wraps in the same Aerie fabric."
4.0,I read the reviews so I ordered a size larger than what my daughter normally wears.  The larger size fit her perfect.
4.0,Very comfortable the mouth isn't very viable though but it's good overall
4.0,"I would give a 5, but it was a little smaller than expected, it still fits & it's still super comfortable, it's so cute & would go perfect with leggings! It's also really soft :)"
4.0,Seem to be good quality…<br />Nicely packaged and LOVE the keychain eyeglass<br />Repair kit (screwdriver) THAT is handy!<br />Picture through polarized lens taken too …
4.0,Beautiful headband. Only issue was the tie up. The front was heavy and the ribbon wasn’t sturdy enough to support it.
4.0,these are cute and nice for around the house but if you go hiking in them you'll get blisters
4.0,Great gift for a young Star Wars fan. Definitely kids' jewelry.
4.0,Fits great only complaint is the buttons i might try to replace them with more sturdy ones. For the price its a great product. I really enjoy the inside pockets perfect for my cell phone.
4.0,I was in a rush to replace another skirt for a concert; would have preferred a different fabric.
4.0,"I like how soft these pants are, and they are very comfortable to wear around the house. I have always been picky about my leggings, because I think that a thicker fabric offers a bit more support for the “softer areas.” This fabric is very lightweight, and doesn’t really offer the same kind of support I was expecting… But they are comfortable for wear around the house."
4.0,"Well, these were interesting having never used a strapless sticky bra before! They fit...sort of? Maybe I don't have enough boobs for the cup because they look nice on the model and in other pics of other customers. Mine sort of did some weird creasing and my husband and I had a good laugh as I pulled them off. Anyhow, they server their purpose and didn't move all night so, it seems they got the job done!"
4.0,"This is so cute, I really like the colors and design overall. The only issue I had was with the cup size. Even with the pads removed they just don't hold the &#34;girls&#34; in well. I ordered a medium (o wear medium in shirts as well). My typical cup size is a &#34;C&#34; and like I said, it didn't not provide good coverage. If you're just relaxing in this then you'd be fine but I was worried if I bent over a certain way that I'd be giving a &#34;free show&#34;"
4.0,i brought yhis item for my son college graduation. it went well with his cap and gown. great color and quality.
4.0,LOve it but the bottoms are a little tight.  I can fit in them but a tad small.  I think the next size up would have been too big.
4.0,Used all week at gym. Great size and plenty of pockets for everything. Lightweight. Would recommend
4.0,Sizes run smaller than expected but good quality!
4.0,I bought this for my grandson who is a tall 8 year old.  He loves it and it’s very soft<br />Haven’t washed it yet but can’t think why it shouldn’t wash well.  I bought age 10.<br />Hope this helps
4.0,Nice dress. Just as pictured except the pouf on the sleeves are not as poufy...the material stretches a lot BUT.. the front material is different from the back and the more it stretches the less opaque the dark appears. I bought the largest size which is a 2x and it fit fine---it is short for reference in 5'8 & a size 20
4.0,"Very warm, fleece lined, seem durable enough so far. I have fairly small hands and they fit me perfectly, with a little room to spare in the mitten area.<br /><br />I am glad that I ordered my husband a different brand of glove, though ... it's doubtful these would be very comfortable for anyone with largish hands.<br /><br />My only complaint is the button loop. It's a pretty tiny loop. I don't expect to actually need to secure the mitten with the button all that often, so I'm not that worried about it. But if you're looking for split mittens that you can quickly/easily secure, these might not work for you."
4.0,Excellent size for my big head. Very lightweight plastic frames and cheap plastic lenses. But what do you expect for the price?
4.0,"Nice watch only problem is with the band.  The end piece that holds the holes does not lay flat.  It protrudes from my wrist and no matter how many times I move the clasp holders back up onto it, they continue to slide off and the band sticks out . Otherwise a nice watch.  Looks good as well."
4.0,Beautiful shirt goes well with everything. I ordered a large but material is very snug especially in the arms so order one size up an xl would have been perfect.
4.0,"Lenses fit the fames very well and seem to be of good quality, I would purchase them again."
4.0,"Took a star away because the dark blue is not as pictured, it's navy.<br />Otherwise I love it!  Thin but not see through, flattering to curves, just above my knee(I'm 5'1&#34;).  I'll probably order more colors."
4.0,comfortable but looses it color pretty quickly
4.0,"These are super cute and easy on and off. Did a great job protecting baby on his first beach trip. The price is ridiculous, of course."
4.0,"I was able to wear the bra a few times before the edges started not sticking as well, but overall it still stays in place. Each time before I use it, I make sure to clean my skin and after I'm done using I replace the plastic film to try to preserve the stickiness. I'll probably get another 3-4 wears out of it for a total of 10 which was about what I expected. Definitely does the job, but with the edges starting to roll a bit, you can see it through clothing a bit more."
4.0,mom loves this dress
4.0,"Fit as expected, the underlining to high thigh is great to ward off any unintentional see through. Very vivid colors!  Material is a bit shinier than expected."
4.0,Really liked this dress and will likely use for a bridal event (either shower or engagement photos.) Usually between a 4-6 and ordered both the small and medium and kept the medium.
4.0,"Super Cool Matertial, Soft, Breathable....polyester is the feel!<br />go for it...great look!"
4.0,"Liked them. They are comfortable...the different colors are very cool,too. Very happy with this purchase."
4.0,perfect for my sons girlfriend arrived on time no proiblems
4.0,It was sticky at first and caught much lint.
4.0,Super cute swimsuit. My daughter is in love with it. She is on the smaller side so its a tad big around her bottom but a quick stitch will fix that.
4.0,These are very handy to condense packing.  You can get more organized and put more into a suit case.
4.0,"From partial coverage to full masked coverage & able to see through! It's soft fabric was comfortable, the design I chose was flattering & pretty for my Halloween mask!"
4.0,"better quality material than expected for the price. I can wear this with slacks jeans or shorts.  The color stated orange, but definetaly pinks and purples.  like this even better"
4.0,"This was a gift for our Grandson.  It looked nice on him.  This is not an expensive necklace but just what it looks like.  The ""Hawaiian Maori Fish Hook"" is made from some composite material and looks nice.  The fact that the length can be adjusted makes it easy to put on and easy to wear at just the right length."
4.0,"Super cute outfit! I was expecting black, but the black in the outfit is actually a dark blue. Still very cute and I don’t mind. Decent quality. My daughter is 14 months but can wear 2t clothing, I ordered a 18-24 months and it is a little too big. But she will be able to wear it for awhile."
4.0,This is a great waist trainer for the gym especially. Easy to put on and wear great fit overall as I said but go down 1 from your true size
4.0,"This is so so soft!!!!  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because it's a strange length.  It's not full length, but it's not short either so it feels a bit awkward."
4.0,Great little wallet. Love it
4.0,Carry it with me.
4.0,"These socks are soft and warm. I did think they would be longer, and I would have given them 5 stars if they were. But they're still good and I'm pretty satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,I bought this for my daughter but I have to learn you can’t buy clothes for teenagers.  I gave it to my niece who loved it.
4.0,"Comfortable product. Installing somewhat annoying since pins fall out easily. Not the right strap for the office I think, but great to wear your favorite watch more working from home. Can easily be worn even while sleeping."
4.0,Very pretty.  Love wearing these.
4.0,"Over all, better than the same design brand I've already tried. The only issue is with the front cover. I think it would be better if the sides are attached to the main at least until covering the hole area. The cloth material is good. Support to the front is better indeed the hole size is ok (logically) but again that small flaw. I'll (for sure) fix it.<br />I ordered this single one for test and already placed order for 4 (the other selling package). What is also good is that the sizes are US adapted. No need to risk it or scratch your head about it.<br />Again, the idea is good! May not be good for every man out there but why don't you try it? Maybe later the design will be improved and it will become more available."
4.0,"My shoes didn't have a completely circular heel which made these not fit. However, the little bit they were awkwardly shoved up on my heel they seemed to work well. Should work just fine with regular round heels!"
4.0,"I thought the material would be a little more sturdy, but it’s a great bag.  My growing little girl can fit a week’s worth of clothes and a couple of stuffed animals in there with no problem, and she can tote it on her own."
4.0,Slightly larger than I expected but still a great suit
4.0,"The color is not the one I picked. Not bad, but I expected the blue to be darker."
4.0,Dont like the material is more cotteny than polyester and doesnt flow as good as expected but its pretty and fit is good
4.0,I fits pretty good i like it.
4.0,"These jeans are absolutely beautiful. I ordered bigger than I wear, but these were too small. Way too small. And I love them & want to wear them"
4.0,"Nice print, funny design if you're into that kind of thing. Holds up well under wash. Fabric is super scratchy though, definitely want to wash it a few times with fabric softener."
4.0,"The material isn't the nicest and the stitching is a bit suspect, but for the price, it's a very flattering shirt and fits well. It's one size, but it's a tie back so you can tie it tighter if you need. I'm 5'2, 113 lbs but felt like the shirt was still a bit loose even when you tie in a little tighter than it's supposed to be. Still very cute and ended up buying another color."
4.0,"I like it, the size is right, feel comfortable, good looking pair of Adidas. I have another pair of Adidas (busenitz) and that one is very narrow, the Lucas fits perfect. I took a star out because I feel the back is too low cut, if was just a little bit higher on the back, will be perfect, probably I would have buy few more pairs.<br />Update*. After one year I still love those shoes and I bought another pair, just to make sure that I will have for the next few years good shoes."
4.0,"My daughter loves this bag,I would of rated 5 stars but came in a bag not a box and was a little bent when I received it. They should of package it better. Colors are bright and fun and it will be great for pride. Thx"
4.0,Very nice material just runs a little small buy a size up!
4.0,Long but I'm short 5'.  Nice skirts.
4.0,"I bought two pairs of these slipper socks.  They remind me of the old Muckluks that I used to get every Christmas as a child.  These fit as I needed, but I wear a size 6.5-7 shoe and my toes were at the very end of these.  Some people commented that they were short and their toes made holes very quickly.  I think that would be true, because a small hole of the inside material developed after 3 weeks of wearing nightly.  I am very please that these did not pill excessively like almost all the other slipper socks that I have purchased.  I really dislike the look of all the pilling on the current socks and clothing purchased, regardless of how expensive the clothing items are.  These were better than most on that account.  I find them VERY comfortable.  A woman wearing socks larger tan 9 should probably go to a small men's sock."
4.0,"I love this as a simple cotton robe to wear when it's hot outside. I bought a size up thinking they ran small, but they definitely run large!"
4.0,"Good, cheap sunglasses. They get the job done. If you are just plain awful at hide and seek with sunglasses I recommend you give these a go."
4.0,"When I first held up the dress, I feared that it was too see through. Erring on the side of caution, I wore spanks/bandeau and nothing showed. I received lots of compliments and the material was very comfy."
4.0,"My ring fits nicely and it's great to have the protection for my solitaire when I'm banging my hand around in a sink full of pots and pans.  I wear the large and it was a tiny bit snug at first, but after a few days it's quite comfortable.  There is often condensation inside, but I wash my hands frequently, so it is to be expected.  I really like the clear color, personally, and I like that it is stretchy.  I have shared the product with my local jeweler; I definitely recommend it for people who are rough on their rings."
4.0,"I love the design on the back of this sweater, but the front is really quite simple with no design.<br /><br />The fit wasn’t great on me but that’s probably due to my short stature and built. If you’re taller, this would be a great sweater for you!<br /><br />The sweater is really soft and pleasant on the skin. It’s not too thick or thin, and an easy casual top for every day.<br /><br />It does run kinda large. I’m not sure whether it’s meant to run large, like a loose sweater. So if you like more fitted, I’d suggest you size down. But if you like the loose sweater look, there’s no need to size up as it already gives that impression.<br /><br />ETA: the color is different than what is pictured. I attached pictures for reference. I ordered what appears to be a deep blue/navy but it’s in fact a lighter washed-jean blue."
4.0,"When I first saw this shirt, I thought it was super cute and I just had to try it. I was so happy when it came it and tried it on immediately. It fit a little bigger than I was expecting, but nothing too awful. Unfortunately, my boyfriend didn't like the way it looked on me at all! It was too big in the shoulders and hung off of them. I don't think this was a problem with the shirt at all, but rather just the way I'm built. I ended up giving it to my sister who broader shoulder and a larger chest than I do (I'm pretty flat) and not only did it fit her but it looked awesome.<br /><br />Even though it didn't work out for me, I would definitely recommend this shirt to anyone.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for a product review. Since reviews heavily influence the products that I buy, I do not guarantee 5 star reviews, just honest ones. I strive to provide the most honest and impartial review I can to help others.

4.0,"For the price I don't really have complaints about this hat. It came folded up. That I didn't like, but as I was packing for the beach I realized how convenient it was. The creases from folding it takes away from it, but it still works. I would have paid a little extra to have a box for it. For the price and for what I needed it for it wasn't a bad purchase."
4.0,"Pros:  Super comfy and stretchy fabric.  Loved the style.  Quality felt good and durable.  Excellent stitching.  Looked just like the picture.<br /><br />Con:  Need to go up 2 sizes if you have any chest at all.<br /><br />She normally wears a medium so I ordered a large, but it was still too tight in the chest.  Was afraid that if it shrank any at all during washing and drying that she'd have to give it to her little sister.  That being said I still recommend it just buy a bigger size."
4.0,Absolutely beautiful and stay in place!!!  Only 4 stars because I wear a size 10 shoe and they are way to tight😥.  Please make larger.
4.0,"PRO= It’s cozy, comfortable, good material and stylish. CON= (One Size) does not fit all, this is more of a China size. The sleeves were not as loosed as advertised, it hugs more to the arm. GF experience on this product"
4.0,It fits great but I have junk in my trunk so no swim suit bottom really fits me but the to fits great :-)
4.0,It was a little too shiny but it works.
4.0,Super tiny....so tiny I am using them as a nose ring .Real cute and real silver. The pics make them look bigger than the tiny baby ear size they are in reality.
4.0,Fit perfect at first.... snug after washing.... but i would buy again!  Well Made AND Excellent support! (But will order 1size larger next time)
4.0,I ordered a medium for my daughter being her size but it was a lil loose but for her it was okay because she doesn't like things to tight or else I would of returned it for a small
4.0,The jacket is nice just fits bigger than I expected.
4.0,Love this little secret treasure!
4.0,Runs a little large for a size small. Fits like a medium.
4.0,"This dress is cute as hell, I have only tried it on so far because every opportunity I’ve had to wear it has fallen through but it’s super cute. I was very worried about the sizing (had a baby 4 months ago and that baby weight has not come off at all lol) but I 100% could have sized down to my pre-baby size. I got the XL and could have gotten the L. Even the M to be honest. It has a lot of stretch, and a zipper which seems kind of pointless. But it’s a nice quality dress and I like that you can adjust the length. It arrives rather long."
4.0,"Im shocked that this fits and is so beautiful on! Decent thickeness tobthe fabric, not sheer, free edges all surged with proper hems in place in the majority of the garment, proper tag in place stating 80% cotton and 20% linen, which, it does feel correct. Will update with a strand test if threads work loose. Flattering fit on a 200lb 38dd 5ft 8 inch tall person."
4.0,Ordered for my husband he loves it!!
4.0,"Fits great, delivered quickly. Seems a bit cheap in the lace on the top, but Im not complaining."
4.0,They were a little small for my 2 1/2 year old.  But she is on the taller side.
4.0,"I'm 5'5&#34;, about 125 lbs, and ordered a large and it fits almost perfectly. I have a larger backside lol so it's difficult for me to find a suit that is long enough but this one was better than I expected! The only thing I'd be cautious of is the boob/nipple area. It puckers out to a point with a little extra material there, but nothing a little sewing can't fix."
4.0,"It did shrink a little after washing it, but I love the material and how nice it fits. It is comfortable."
4.0,put a hat sizer tape inside. fits great now
4.0,"Seems to meet the waterproof test. Case is somewhat harder plastic than expected, so not sure if it will cushion a fall."
4.0,Very elegant... Nice and long... Silky material
4.0,Nice bags for gifts but not as replacement grocery bag.
4.0,"It was a gift, yet the feedback provided is positive.  The only drawback was the clasp can be trying at times, when in a hurry."
4.0,"The only reason I can't give this sweater five stars is the pockets! They are definitely too high for me. Other than not being able walk around with my hands balled up in my pocket, this sweater is great. It fits nice. It washed really well. Nice for cool weather. Looks awesome with high waisted outfits."
4.0,Had a pair of Nike foam sandals for 5 years. These for too small and are uncomfortable. Will not buy more
4.0,will reorder
4.0,"Lightweight, comfortable, I am 5’7 ,  it falls below the knee. Fits just right. The white is a bit see thru tho."
4.0,Great cami for the price!
4.0,"I’m 5’3” and it’s hits a few inches above my knees, which works for me.  I’m between a small and medium and the medium fit me. I got this at a much lower price than the original one, so it’s a great value for me. Fabric is on the thin side, but fine for summer.  Good purchase!"
4.0,"Great color. Comfortable fit. A little large, but hats are often too small for me, so that's welcome."
4.0,"Got them as a gift for my younger sister, she's a teen. It says unisex but I know they are mosyly for men. They fit her a bit big but she can manage. She just loves them"
4.0,"Really like this dress, but the slit at the front needed a pin as it showed my underwear when I moved!  Great price and recommend."
4.0,Beautiful color - just as rich as described. I am 5'5&#34; and 140 lb. and wear a Med and this was perfect !! Soft and flowy!!
4.0,Nice swim wear . I had to return it though because the top area was too big.
4.0,"These are really really cute. The posts were bent when I got them, which is why I gave them 4 stars. Easy to fix though and I got a lot of compliments! I was hoping the diamond ones were bigger but oh well."
4.0,"My son loves this place silk. It does not seem as soft now and I think will start to fray soon, but he plays peekaboo with it and just holds and plays with it by himself. I got it for him at nine months, and he still loves it at 11 1/2."
4.0,"sleeves are just a bit to wide, even after washing and drying"
4.0,"Love this sweater, except that it pulls really easily and the cowl neck is overwhelming at times, but you can pull it down over your shoulders if you feel you are being swallowed by it or if it gets too hot."
4.0,"I bought a pair for my wife and she loves it. Its alot more beautiful than it looks on the picture advertised! The only dislike is the method of putting it on. The rings shown below of the picture is meant to be squeezed by your fingers in order to create a larger diameter for fitment onto hand. However, my wife found it to be abit difficult to squeeze and i had to assist in this regard. The mechanism could of been easier for women!"
4.0,"Just got the black and white ones this week. Styling is nice and the quality looks good. Runs pretty true to size. I am a size 12 but if you are in between sizes like a 12.5, definitely get a 13. Padding inside is good and boots are comfortable all around. The new fasteners are easy to use as I prefer not having so many buckles. Have not had a day of riding in them yet but I expect them to be comfortable all day long. For entry/intermediate level and/or occasional MX or trail riding, I think these boots hit the mark. I only took off 1 star due to not having spent an entire day in them yet so I can’t give a thorough review just yet."
4.0,The earrings are beautiful and you can't go wrong for this price! The backs are a little flimsy but I just replaced them with the rubber stopper type.
4.0,"Length is good.  The shirt is a little thin, but not terribly."
4.0,"My daughter is 9 months old, 16# and 30 inches tall and this fits her so well. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I was a little disappointed it wasn't fuller. But it is still a super adorable skirt. The stars have a &#34;hologram&#34; done to them."
4.0,"Bought it for my daughter to play a part in a play, love the color, fit good, material feels cheap, hope it will last the 2 days for the play!"
4.0,Length is little more considering my wife is 5'3&#34;. Delivery is good and on time.
4.0,I am satisfied with the quality and fit of the product. Just what i wanted.
4.0,"This is a very pretty necklace, it's a chocker and is pretty tight.  So keep that in mind, it's still a chic piece!"
4.0,Lenses a little light.
4.0,Style at a great price. Plus socks!! Well made
4.0,Shirts were great and fit true to size.
4.0,Very cute outfit. The only thing I don't like is that you have to tie the headband. The headband is not already tied in a bow or elastic.
4.0,"Fits nicely, lots of stretch. Cute details. I'm a small/medium, but I'm sure it would fit up to a XL. Seems to stay in place. Great price."
4.0,nice scarfs but 3 are so similar in color that you almost can't tell a difference. A better mix of colors would be better.
4.0,"I really like the design of this shirt. It is slim fitting and if you're a bigger guy, defintiely order a size larger than normal."
4.0,"Great for any whovian collectors out there! It's a great toy version of the Doctor's Fob Watch from the TV show and it can also act as an actual functioning watch! Downside is that it's larger than what the TV version looks like and the button for the lights and sound effects can be easily pressed, causing it to go off while in your pocket."
4.0,Fits the baby well
4.0,Awesome workout shirts ....Can't wait to start wearing them..
4.0,"Fabric is thin, pockets are on the verge of negligible, but the dress is super comfy. I am 5'3, bottom of the dress hits the tops of my feet."
4.0,"I love them. I’m a 34DD and the medium fit perfect. They looked super small at first, and I accidentally put it on backwards so was disappointed at first, but it’s all good now! Only complaint is the straps. The tan straps are super long and so I had to tie them but they’re slippery, the black straps are fine, could be a little shorter but they’re fine. I was so worried the thin straps would hurt, so far so good. I don’t like being uncomfortable or for sports bra type tops to dig into my shoulders. I’m going to buy another pack. Worth buying."
4.0,I think these will help keep everything organized. Well designed and well made. I love the color and how light they are. I only wish it had more of the large size and less of the really small size.
4.0,Very good cuff links. I got them as a gift from my kids.
4.0,"strap placement for me was a little wide, but I have a small frame. The color isn't quite as expected but I really do love this shirt!"
4.0,"They weren't  quite as I expected, but they are really fashionable. I like them."
4.0,Not the highest quality and fits me very big. But since there are no holes I can easily tighten it and it stays put! Very good for the price!
4.0,Good for this money
4.0,"This dress is super cute and would be the perfect summer dress! The fabric is soft and the colors are so pretty. It does run small, though. I’m a large typically and on me a large in this dress is fitted, not flowy. The next time I would order a couple sizes bigger."
4.0,Fabric is soft and feels durable around the neck area. Love the way it fits. No complaints other than the fact (maybe cause mine was a XXL) the headphone chord stops a few inches short of the edge versus how in the pictures it shows the chord not being cut off.
4.0,"I really like this maxi dress. I am 5'4 and 180 lbs. I bought the large and it fit perfectly. The dress fits EXACTLY in length. If I were an inch shorter, the fabric would be dragging on the ground. With my extremely large chest, maxi dresses are hit and miss for me.... (Usually a miss) But this dress looks nice! No matter what your chest size, I would say it would be best to wear over a swim top or something because the white is a bit transparent. (Not very much but I might worry on a bright day. haha)<br /><br />The fabric is sturdy and the dress flows nicely. I wish they had sent a chart with it that explains how to make it work all of the different ways. I figured out a few based off of the pictures and really you can play with it and make your own cute ways but it would have been nice. Honestly, I think that just wearing it the obvious way of tying the straps behind your neck is great though and I'll likely mostly do that or the one where you slide them over your shoulders. I like the way the long straps flow behind me when I tie it at the back of my neck especially.<br /><br />Overall, this dress is great! If the white stripes were a darker color that wasn't a bit transparent, I would give it five stars. It is SO hard for me to find a maxi dress that I really like, I'm really picky about them so four stars is saying a lot for me - and this dress is almost perfect and I would definitely recommend it!<br /><br />I received this dress at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"I received this tank top in size xx-large, this tank top fits me very well. The material feels nice against my skin. The only issue i had wad it's slightly see thru, so I have to wear another tank underneath<br />I received this at a discounted rate for my bo est review."
4.0,"I got the 10 multi-pack These work pretty well. They are about exactly what you would expect - scrunchie on your wrist with a watch. Great deal for the price. I actually will still be returning them though, for 2 minor reasons, but significant enough to know I'm just not probably going to use them.<br />1) the elastic is just *slightly large for my wrist (I have very skinny wrists) and so, my watch tends to kinda fall off to the side sometimes, but oddly enough, it's tight enough to leave marks on my wrist when I take it off (it's not that big of a deal, but I am VERY picky and sensitive about how things fit and feel.<br />2) the other thing is that the material is satiny/shiny-ish, so some designs look a little cheapy - really not too bad, but I am 41 & I just don't love it. About half the patterns were ones I might actually wear & about half I probably almost never would."
4.0,"Wish it was bigger but it works for what I need USB port is a nice addition to, it however the USB cable that it comes with  could be better quality, Over all I think the bag is good quality"
4.0,My daughter likes this brand compared to a few others.  It holds up well with washing and fits as expected.
4.0,"I thought these were kinda pricey, and well, they kinda are for a synthetic.  But I like them and feel they can be used more than I’d originally imagined.  In the photos, I have them slightly scrunched and covering the top of a short boot.  I am 5’9”.<br />They can be connected while storing in a similar way as some mittens - there is a little storage bag that at least fits one of them.<br />I don’t find them tight, constricting, or uncomfortable.  I can really only wear natural fabrics around my neck/torso due to my dysautonomia and overheat easily.  These give me some lower warmth but no issues with non-breathable synthetics there.<br />I really like that they could be worn over bare skin, or leggings, even under certain thin pants, while wearing either a sandal or a short boot.  For me, this makes them a winner and a more versatile choice than other Amazon offerings.<br />I had Danskin (I think - it was a dance wear brand) tall leg warmers from eons ago that I loved - no top band, just ones that stayed up during heavy activity, had matching shorts, were perfect length, and super comfy.  I guess those no longer exist.  You really do have to hang onto something when you find it cause you may not get another chance.<br />I could pull these right up to the knee crevice, but they are a smidge short that way for my preference, at least with this kind of boot.  Under a coat, they’d look almost like a pair of pants.<br />Pleased."
4.0,Feels amazing. It is solid and durable with an added premium finish. I only wish that it were a little shorter as it adds quite a bit of length to your keys.
4.0,"It is a good wallet in all respects except for one feature that is missing:  a divider between large and small bills.  For the price, it is a good deal."
4.0,"I'm 6&#34;0 and wear an 18-22 depending on the product and brand. I have broad shoulders and a large chest so I ordered a 3X and thought it would be a little big but it wears like a 2X. The sleeves are a little short, which what I was expecting. I was surprised to find it even buckles. Very nice coat and is very warm. I would recommended it and buy again if needed."
4.0,"I like the style and other than being just a little big for a large, it's very wearable.  The fabric has a slight shine to it - I was expecting more cotton but there's something in it that gives it a slight bit of glam. I'll still wear it, perhaps to work now, but it was just different look than I expected. The craftsmanship is not perfect quality as there are many threads coming from the buttons and whatnot - seems quickly made.  Overall it won't be a 'goto' shirt for me but it will be good for when I need a slightly shiny henley."
4.0,This is a really nice coat. super soft I bought the pink and it goes well with black top and jeans!
4.0,"Fairly light, not terribly sturdy but sturdy enough to last a year or more with careful use, looks great"
4.0,Bought for Christmas gift.
4.0,The purse is very pretty but is much larger than expected and the lining doesn’t seem to be well made. I chose to return it and the seller was very helpful.
4.0,"The length is good, the quality is great for the cost the fit was ok"
4.0,My feet slip out of the slipper. It may be the material or the fact I have very dry feet. Very pretty though and use them for stepping out in my Garage or front or back porch.
4.0,"Great material. It's probably my fault for ordering XL, but some clothing that's labeled XL is smaller and some is larger. We need universal size dimensions all clothing makers will follow."
4.0,"This was cute for my son's baptism, much preferred to a traditional gown since he was about five months old.  However, my son is a moose, so I figured I'd err on the big side and ordered him a 9 month since most people said it runs a bit big.  Overall it fit pretty well, but the legs were a little bit short.  I didn't care enough about it being short to return it or find something else though.  I have other 9 month clothes for him that are long enough, so it may just be a variation.  (Or this place took people's feedback and started to adjust sizes smaller?)"
4.0,Works fine labeling is challenging
4.0,"Just rec'd...using one (usually only one leg gets a bit swollen)...had cardio check..OK....Sitting is an issue at my age...so trying one out for several hours today while sewing, etc....do wear sz 9 shoe so got L-XL ...not so bad pulling onto foot...feel comfy for now...will check back to review later today.  Price was very good!"
4.0,Like it very much...good fit
4.0,Fits good couldn't ask for any more
4.0,"This is a pretty bathing suit. It is really unusual. It is a lot of fun. It fit okay, but for me was so so on flattering (I'm about 5 pounds overweight). But I think the suit would be flattering on someone who is thinner or has a different shape than mine. The fabric was good. I think it is a quality suit."
4.0,"This dress is a cute style and good quality. It looks just plain grey in my photos but is more black/white heather. I ordered a medium, I’m 5ft, 145lbs, 34DDD and this dress is pretty short. It’s appropriate but I can’t bend over, so not really practical. I have OTK boots on in the photos, I think it’s cute for that style. Arms were a bit long on me too, but they do gather at the wrist (I have t-Rex arms so I imagine it’s way better on normal people)!"
4.0,"I wanted the posts to be short because i knew i wouldnt be able to take them off frequently as small as they are. The long posts gouge my neck behind the ear. These do not.  But, wow, was it hard to get them on with the back on the right notch to keep the crystal from sinking into the pierce hole. They fit perfectly now but I do worry about taking them off and having the same experience again."
4.0,These fit nice and look nice !<br />Warning ! They are see through
4.0,Great sunglasses for the price. Nice for a beach pair that you're not too worried about getting sand on.
4.0,"It is a very pretty little chain with a high polish,.<br />that makes it Stand out. The only reason I can't give five stars<br />Is becase of the clasp."
4.0,"When I saw this latest version of the Blue Angels Skyhawks I knew I had to have it. It looks amazing, has a sapphire crystal and micro adjustment on the bracelet. However it is th bracelet that is a total miss. It has very sharp edges and is just not comfortable over the course of a day. I take it off several times throughout the day and it feels like a sense of relief. The bracelet could also use a half link so that you can get the fit just right. The micro adjustment works but without the half link you might wear it too tight for summer and humidity or too loose the rest of the time."
4.0,"Just received my nose rings in the mail and for the price, you can't beat that.(plus free shipping) But for something so small, I recommend putting them in something other than the package itself. But hey, the jewelry so far is holding up and looks great!!"
4.0,"Fast delivery , nice quality , love the design , and seem like it will be warm. But it was kind of big and kept falling down. But I don't know if there were sizes when i ordered it. But it is for men, so that maybe why its to big. But it was  good quality."
4.0,"Not all of the toggles have the spring in the right place, some also look like it's been sanded down so the finish looks 'used'. I'd say 7 out of 10 are good."
4.0,Great quality for price. Ready for any occasion.
4.0,"A bit oversized but not enough to really be a bother.Last one got taken, one day, when I forgot to pick it up at the end of the day. Light enough to wear all day and not get hot. Also good for layering in moderate weather. would buy again if need be."
4.0,"I am a size 9 shoe, definitely should have ordered 10."
4.0,"They get the job done for that extra coverage.  However, they are a bit firm.  Hoping after some washings they might soften up a bit.  We girls don't need a shield people, just a little extra coverage for modesty thank you!"
4.0,I ordered a medium but I think I enjoyed the holidays a little too much it will fit perfect in 2 weeks :)
4.0,"beautiful cardigan, although it did ripped a tiny bit after a couple days of wearing."
4.0,"Definitely get a size or too bigger! Other than that, fits great! Very cute and comfortable!"
4.0,"I highly suggest sizing up! I'm normally an XS (I'm 5'2&#34; and 105 lbs) and the medium fit me well! It could have been a little tighter but I wouldn't want to risk it and buy the small. This is actually a pretty full coverage swimsuit even with the low cut neck. You really don't have to worry about your chest showing too much which is good! The only thing is that I wish it showed a little but more back and hip and booty but that's just my preference. Overall a great buy for a price that can't be beat! Also, I'm thinking this could possibly be worn as a bodysuit when for going out which is pretty exciting!"
4.0,I like the color and fit.  I can wear this anywhere.
4.0,Good hat. Fit's good.
4.0,Feels great around the neck.
4.0,I really love the look of this swimsuit. Very cute! Nicely made. Love it in grey. The only problem it is the top wants to slip down. Especially the right side for some reason. Ahhhh I can’t have parts hanging out in the pool! Maybe I can get someone to tighten the right side somehow?
4.0,"Fits well, happy with."
4.0,"My son , who at 29 is still playing soccer ,loved it!"
4.0,"good quality,  lots of compartments, vibrant color (maybe too vibrant). would prefer strap be a little shorter."
4.0,"This is the perfect mom purse. Plenty of space and pockets to properly separate the bandaids & snacks from you wallet, phone & keys! I'm giving it 4 stars because the seam at corner of strap into handbag is starting to come loose. It's nothing a little stitch can't fix, but I've only had the bag 3.5 weeks."
4.0,"this shirt is pretty true to size, it fit as expected for me. the quality is good and the shirt itself is super cute. only complaint i have is the lace at the top is a bit itchy at first but you get used to it as you wear it."
4.0,The material is soft and stretchy. It fits true to size.
4.0,Kiddo loves the pattern and can easily put them on herself. The string is just the right length for her 5-6 toddler size coat.
4.0,"Very nice quality, recommend them! Got lots of compliments when wearing!"
4.0,"So soft,shipped fast,love the colors<br />I ordered another one because I love it<br />Great product definitely going to buy more."
4.0,It was perfect but he could have been a little bit longer. This was a medium I am 54 175.
4.0,"These fit pretty well.  I'm in the process of losing weight - I'm a muscular/athletic build with some extra pounds (5' 4&#34; & ~160lbs right now) and these fit just fine.  I have large thighs (26&#34; around) and these are not see through.  I also have a thigh tattoo that is not visible through the leggings.  If I try to 'over stretch' them, I can see the tattoo through them.  So, if your legs are much bigger around than 26&#34;, they may get a little see-through.  The colors are a little bit darker than the image looks - brown, grey, & purple are definitely darker but all look great.  My only complaint - these are long.  I have to either fold them under at the ankle, or wear them down under my heel/bottom of the legging around the arch of my foot.  But, I'm short - so it's not surprising they're long on me.  Great value for the variety & price."
4.0,My daughter loves it. It's just a bit short.
4.0,"I like the look of it.  Quality is good and seems to hold up well.  I wish there was a way to lock it a little easier, but not enough of a issue to reduce the stars.<br /><br />Good purchase, would buy again."
4.0,"Its a nice top , i like the fit and design, only issue is the neck part keeps riding up which is a little bit annoying."
4.0,No mucho es muy muy pequeño  para mi hija pense que venian mas grande
4.0,I like the colour and shape but the material and quality is little bit cheap but it’s works good for price.
4.0,"Really nice looking watch band.  This is my first experience with a watch strap so I had a bit of a time figuring out how it goes on the watch but I found a good YouTube video here [...] .  It is not for this brand of watch strap -- is just basically how to install a strap-type band.  I love that it comes with 4 spring bars and the tool to put them on.  With the tool it was super easy.  The material is nice and thin and easy to manipulate on the wrist.  It really does dress up my Samsung Gear S2 watch.<br />May 5 edit:  even though I love this band, if you are using a Samsung Gear S2 watch, this band will not work.  It blocks a little sensor on the back side of the phone and you will stop receiving any notifications."
4.0,They are very comfortable good for showers I like them.
4.0,Beautiful but runs big
4.0,"Pretty good shoe, but not as good as the 360 or regular Stride Rite versions of this design. The Velcro around the ankle rides a little higher on the Munchkin version and doesn’t lay flat. The decorative bungee detail is very cute but one broke within a few weeks (shoe still works without it so we just cut the other one off to match). My toddler loves them and doesn’t try to take them off and that’s the biggest win, so they still get four stars."
4.0,This is the perfect summer dress.  Light and flowing. It fit a bit larger than I expected so you might want to consider downsizing.
4.0,i really like this shirt  looks great with jeans
4.0,Went to a reception. Dress was a little long. Overall it was comfy. Not figure flattering
4.0,"This top is comfortable.  It is loose, but has a nice feel for summer.  The sleeves are not constricting, but provide coverage without being hot.  The colors are delightful!"
4.0,"Purchased for my son for Christmas.  The tie has subtle sheen, and is a little rough to the hand, but looks nice on him.  It is a little short on my son, but given that he is 6'5&#34; tall, that's not unusual."
4.0,I have a lot of different ones these are my go to
4.0,Nice shoelaces but were to small for my shoes. I should have measured.
4.0,"I got these for a friend of mine who is a &#34;dapper gentleman.&#34; He enjoys wearing his suits and likes early 1900's inspired fashion.<br />If you have a friend like this, I highly recommend."
4.0,Likeed it works very well
4.0,Bag is more orange in color than brown.
4.0,Very comfy and nice casual shirt.
4.0,"I wore this as part of my catwoman outfit for halloween. It was awesome! just wish it was a bit longer, but i was looking for a body suit when i ordered this."
4.0,"I got this for my husband as a Christmas gift; I got down on my knee and asked if he would marry me again! He can't wear a metal ring to work, but they can wear these. It's very comfortable and true to size. He forgets he has it on. On the weekend he wears his real wedding ring. They only complaint is that it looks like a tire and I didn't think about that when I ordered. They are so reasonable I might get him another one."
4.0,It’s pretty nice pendant I think my daughter will like it for her birthday. The only thing I would like better is if it had Galaxy Pendant or something like that on top of the case that it is in.
4.0,"Fits loose. Different cut than my usual bootie style, so I gave them to my daughter and she is very happy with them."
4.0,like the detail
4.0,"These slippers are definitely nice and warm...but my feet never get too hot.  I wear them with and without socks and have never had a problem with them getting sweaty/stinky as have some of my slippers in the past.  My favorite feature is how easy they are to slip on and off.  The only downside to these slippers is that there is no arch support. As a stay at home mom running around the house much of the day in these slippers, I would appreciate a bit more support."
4.0,"very impressed with it. I can actually set my phone down in one room and walk into another, and the signal is still pretty strong. only down side that I have come across is that there is no way to remove the speakers to wash the hat if needed."
4.0,"Very useful , I recommend"
4.0,Great skirt. Have the black and dark blue. Normally would order a XXL but had to return for a XL.
4.0,"Beautiful blouse, runs very small. Buy 2 sozes up"
4.0,"Cool hat, it's a bit wider than I expected, but it still looks great!"
4.0,"I love the way Lior pants fit.  I have a number of them in full length and wanted the capri style for summer.  Since these fit so good and look great, I ordered several more in different colors."
4.0,"Easy to use.comfy, great space saver<br />Practical.gone be use in a demanding weather área so better still working as godo as ay home."
4.0,"Wife loves them. I suggest slightly stronger material but currently is in great condition. I expected a little thicker material but no complaints at moment but I can anticipate longevity. Fashionable, especially for price"
4.0,Width
4.0,"Stay true to size. The color I got was the pink it’s not too sheer but I would still wear a tank top underneath. Depends on what your comfort level is. Washes well, did not have any issues."
4.0,I would not recommend for ladies with a large bust though...a V neck looks better...this is a bit too closed on top
4.0,"I feel this is an exceptional, BEAUTIFUL, well made dress!!  Really impressed with that since there are so many cheap, shoddy dresses out there these days.<br />Sadly, it doesn't work for me. I'm going to see if it fits my daughter, because it's just too gorgeous of a dress not to &#34;keep it in the family.&#34;  ; )<br />If you are even thinking of buying it, DO IT. It is that nice!"
4.0,"PROS:<br />- Perfect to wear at a Gala or a fancy event<br />- The sleeves flow beautifully<br />- Length sits perfectly above ankles<br />- Slit is the right size<br /><br />CONS:<br />- I wore beige heels and added a belt to accentuate my waist, and they both got stained<br />- Material isn't the best<br />- Probably best to hand wash it - dye might come off and dryer will probably destroy it"
4.0,a little bulkier then expected.
4.0,I got the good vibes and the black with white lines. They’re two different materials and lengths. Good vibes is like a rough-ish T-shirt a feels a little short. The black one is slightly shiny/stretchy and the perfect length. Both cover your butt and pooch.<br />44B.
4.0,Very cute pants. They are made of very thin fabric. I only wear them around the house. Fits as expected.
4.0,"I am usually a size S, but I ordered M just to be safe. When I received it and tried it on it was to short and also to tight so there was no way I could wear it. I had to return it. I loved the style."
4.0,A bit snug around stomach
4.0,"Very pretty. Inexpensive so I don't expect them to hold up long, though."
4.0,I love my wrist let. I have been using it for over 6 months and the logo plate has started to scrape off. Keep in mind that I use it EVERY day but with this price I expected it to last a little longer with out it wearing off...<br />The rest of the wrist let looks perfect! I put my phone in the wrist let and pull it out a lot and the wallet is holding pretty nicely.
4.0,The purses are perfect and great price
4.0,Size was a little snug but she loves it and the quality is great for the value!
4.0,"Super cute and adorable but wish it was longer.  Great for a shorter person. I'd be happy if it was more like 3-4 inches longer.  The cut, sleeve length and the style at the bottom us cute.  Looks good with leggings or skinny jeans."
4.0,"its a nice purse, haven't carried it as of yet, got it for Easter. It appears to be a little  thin hope it holds all my belongings without breaking the straps, really seems thin"
4.0,"Beautiful skirt and perfect for Spring! My only issue was the waist band was a little too snuggle for me. I am 5'5 and 140lbs; I usually fit somewhere in a grey area between a small and medium in most stretchy maxi skirts and leggings, reading the Q&As I went on a limb and ordered a small. I sent it back and ordered a medium because the small squeezed enough to give me an unflattering muffin top. Fingers crossed that the medium fits all the right curves"
4.0,Wife purchased to wear at work. Material is breathable and didn't become moist on the inside for the 8 hours she spends at work. Little rubber adjuster on the ear pieces split down the middle very quickly though
4.0,"Very cute, the crisscross is adorable but I had to wear a cardigan because it was a little small. The dress is still amazing and I got tons of compliments!!! 💚💙💜 great material thought."
4.0,great but=the  inst.don;t tell you=has 4 buttons doesent tell you which is for what=i could not either=gave $ back
4.0,Looks like picture. Fits well.
4.0,"Top fits perfectly, but shorts were REALLY tight. I usually wear a size 8 bottom and these were more a size 4. Worth the purchase to acquire the top, though. Whole outfit was very well made. Would purchase again."
4.0,Cute dress fits well
4.0,"I love these boots! They’re great for the price and well made, however they run very big. Since they’re lace up and go higher up the calf we made them work."
4.0,as seen
4.0,"Fits well, good quality, good price."
4.0,"I like it! I am a 42D and usually wear a size 14. I read the reviews and got a size XXL. It fits me well while showing off my curves. Very flattering for a curvy figure. The fabric has some stretch to it, is thick but not coarse and does not wrinkle easily. Wish the sleeves were longer (under elbow) but it looked good. It is embroidered and the red looks expensive."
4.0,"This is a nice athletic bra that offers light to moderate support. I'd say that it runs just slightly large compared to some other brands that I wear. I love the criss-cross design in the back. However, after washing, the padded inserts are difficult to get back into place, which is a common issue that I have with sports bras. However, for the price, this is a nice option and is comparable to more expensive brands. Worth a try!"
4.0,I loved the dress overall however there was a spot where it looks like the clothes alarm may have been. I couldn’t wear it when I went away as that was the reason I purchased it.
4.0,Fits my face better than those blue ones do.
4.0,Love the look and feel. Zipper is not very smooth so you need to be patient with it.
4.0,"This is a lovely bracelet, ideal for gifting as well as a motivational reminder to oneself.  It comes in a cotton-lined box with an outer sleeve.  The bracelet is stretched over a card that has an inspirational quote that echoes the mountain charm the bracelet holds.<br />The beads are strung on what seems to be a very strong elastic cording, but still,  I think this bracelet is not suited for larger wrists as it doesn't have a generous stretch. I have very small wrists, and as you can see in the photos, it's hugging my wrist rather well.<br />The mountain charm has very delicate blingy stones that are set nicely. There is also another smaller charm that bears the LENNY+EVA logo.<br />I do wish there was a bit more dangle to the charms as they get caught up between the beads and sometimes stick upwards.<br />I posted some photos to give you a closer look and sincerely hope that they, along with my thoughts, help you out a bit with your choice.  Thank you!"
4.0,"This bra is gorgeous, I've ordered it twice. The first one I ordered was super tight on the girls so this time I went a size up. Its still really small.  I'll go up two sizes next time."
4.0,Great shipping great for my Halloween custome. Thanks so much!!
4.0,"The design and mechanism are very good ; only one thing that puzzles me ,  there are 40 days in the calendar .<br />Overall it is worth what I paid  for . I  highly recommend it."
4.0,"I generally don't wear hats except when I'm gardening, but I saw a lady wear a hat similar in design to this one and it looked nice so I figured I would try this one out.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I like the velvet band of Orchid Row Women's Fashion Wranger Hat with Velvet Band Navy/Heather but I do like the design, fit and overall look of the hat. It goes well with most of wardrobe. I wouldn't wear it often because I'm not used to wearing hats, but it was fun to wear in that it changed up the look a bit and it is also convenient for days when my hair just isn't cooperating."
4.0,"Came in a timely fashion, cute, not for everyday wear but that's to be expected. Condensation gathers a bit and that can't really be helped as well. Great for wearing with socks with designs on them; have received compliments on these boots! They squeak a little when I walk, though. Kinda like Spongebob's squeaky boots. But it doesn't bother me TOO much."
4.0,Bigger than what  I expected  but still decent.
4.0,"It is very pretty,but a little too large.  Will still enjoy wearing it."
4.0,"I choose this rating, one of the pieces was stretched a little larger than the other three. I have very small wrists, therefore if I were to<br />wear it alone, it would fall off. I can wear it with the bracelets and it won't fall off. I still like it.<br /><br />Luvtravel"
4.0,The light is weak but for the price you can't beat it.
4.0,"Good product, warm but not too warm."
4.0,"Bought it as a dress and although i like it it is ver short, you have to ware tights"
4.0,"A little more lightweight than what I thought is was going to be. Also I am 5'7&#34; and 130 pounds I got a medium which is almost too small. I do however like my hoodies a little bigger, so maybe it would be fine for others."
4.0,"I like the charm itself, but it came off twice."
4.0,"First thing's first: I'm a 21 year old female, stand at 5'1&#34;, and weigh around 120 pounds. I've got tiny breasts and a fairly short torso.<br /><br />This fits great! It's tight enough to prevent gapping while loose enough to be comfortable, the back is super cute, and the color is a perfect match. My only complaint is that -- well, I've got a short torso. I had expected this to fall a bit higher on me, but it goes pretty far down and causes the fat on my stomach bulge in a way that isn't, ah, flattering, particularly when I bend over. That problem is easily solved by folding the band up under the rest of the bra (it isn't obvious at all, and is still comfortable), which makes the end of the bra fall higher on my body and prevents the bulge.<br /><br />I will say that the stitching on the neckline makes the fabric look a little funny in that it folds out instead of laying perfectly flat (I added a photo of that, I'm not sure how well you can see it). Other than that, though, this is wonderful! The material it's made out of is really sturdy and soft, and the straps are super secure, so I don't feel like they're going to rip off while I'm sparring in Jiu Jitsu and Muay Thai."
4.0,"These are good pants. They're very comfy, have real front and back pockets, and because they're a snug fit but stretchy, they're safer to order online than most pants. I have trouble finding pants that fit because I am curvy but have a narrow waist, and I was really pleasantly surprised by these. Length-wise, I wear petite sizes and they look just slightly cropped on me. I'd look into getting these in other colors too."
4.0,"This dress really does bring out the perfect feminine silhouette. My boyfriend picked this dress out for me for an upcoming wedding because it &#34;makes your butt look amazing&#34;, he was right, the dress is the perfect fit and length for accentuating curves in a sexy/ chic way. The fabric is also pretty thick and durable, a heads up to dancers: it gets a little warm. I am 5'10 and very much a pear shape, I usually wear a size 10 and ordered a medium. There was a little room to spare in the top but snug through the hips. It looks good, but movement is a little tight. I will be ordering this dress again in a large in future just to have a little extra room and take it in on the top."
4.0,I like them. They aren't as light as my previous pair from another brand. But they don't get 5 stars because they keep collapsing on their own. Thank Gawd it hasn't happened while I have been on a peak or cliff.
4.0,Good hat at a great price.
4.0,This skirt is super cute! However I had to dock a star because it is quite sheer.  I will definitely need to wear a slip with this one.
4.0,"I love pretty much everything about the purse, except that the holster for the gun is not ambidextrous, so if you are truly left-handed, that protection is not available for your gun. In order to truly be ambidextrous, it should have velcro on both sides of the holster, not just one. If that were so, I would definitely give it a 5!"
4.0,"They are great for my daughter who runs through shoes. Easy to tie (for her) I gave 4 starts because the bottoms are a bit slippery until she runs around on them. But other then that, easy to clean, great price, comfortable, and they look cute!!"
4.0,The shipping was fast! My daughter loved how brightly the shoes lit up. They look well made. She wears them to daycare so the true test will be how they hold up to daily wear and tear.
4.0,Love them! Work great for my 1 year old and 4 year old girls! The only thing I was disappointed in was that 2 of the headbands were really stretched out.
4.0,"Good dress, fits nicely, colors are vibrant and material is light."
4.0,"love the material and the color, fits as expected!"
4.0,Night driving recommend highly.
4.0,"Haven’t used it yet. Bought it for my husband as a Father’s Day gift to use as a gym bag. Will have to write new comments later. But, the bag looks great and looks like it will fit his needs well."
4.0,Very comfortable lightweight material. Runs a little big
4.0,Fit was excellent but the dye used stained my hands and nails.
4.0,This fits small and it’s not a tunic or shirt dress.
4.0,Zipper is a bit stiff but that is because of the watertight seal surrounding it. So far I havent had to try the waterproofing and hope I never have to..
4.0,Stones have a nice color and weight to it.  Good quality .  Received many compliments!
4.0,The charm was a classic. This was perfect for my wife. Her signature saying. Nice and large writing to be able to see what it says.
4.0,"Cute shirt but not what was expected from photo. Tag states 100% cotton but I suspect it has 1-2% spandex due to stretch factor which is fine with me. However- fabric weight is heavier than expected and u won’t get that silky, slinky drape that’s shown in vendor’s photo. It fits like a classic cotton shirt. That’s disappointing but not a deal breaker, just won’t wear as originally planned. I purchased the pink in size S and it fits like a S (I’m 5’6”, 135 ish lbs., 36C ). I also purchased the grey in M to wear like a tunic with leggings (hasn’t arrived yet) but am guessing it will be too small for that look. Hem detail, slub texture & V-neck add a little oomph but it’s a pretty basic cotton T.  Directions say to hand wash cold - ya right! I wash everything in cold so not a prob there but it’s in with the normal cold cycle now. I will line dry & hope there’s no shrink. Will update if that occurs. Overall : paid $10 ~ worth $10!"
4.0,My husband and I took our plugs out a few years ago and decided to re-stretch back to where we were originally.<br />These plugs were perfect and did the job just fine! Wish I had these back in high school when I started stretching in the first place.
4.0,Like it but there was not a paper showing you what the different colors mean.
4.0,"Very cute, granddaughter loved them.  Shipping took a LONG time (4 weeks+)missed X-mas"
4.0,"My daughter, who usually wears adult small to medium, fit comfortably in the large, but I don't think any smaller size would have worked.  Ordering through Amazon was cheaper and much quicker than other options."
4.0,"This works well, easy to use and does the job.  I can still breathe through it with ease.  WOrks better than a lot of the other ones on here."
4.0,Painting these for my Halloween theme this year.
4.0,"Nice wallet, and it's represented well online"
4.0,They were a gift for my color blind son...so the jury is still out.
4.0,Wish it fit tighter on my arm but it is cute.
4.0,They acre soft and comfortable. Just a little long for my short legs. But rolling over the waist. And solves that
4.0,"These are so cute! True to size, they are so tiny. I wear them in my third lobe piercing and they fit perfectly and snug. I like that the gems are only on half of the hoop, so you're getting two looks in one pair. The closure seems pretty secure on mine. I'm only giving 4 stars instead of 5 because I've only had them for a week and I'm not sure how durable they are."
4.0,"Nice, but size up."
4.0,Bought this since the other color was out of stock. The clasps work well and the design is super cute. It was a little bigger than I expected but that’s a good thing. I am pleased with my purchase!
4.0,"Luckily, I ready reviews on getting a larger size than you are because mine fit perfectly.  I bought an XL but usually wear a L.  It would've been too tight for sure if I would've bought the L.  The only issue I have with this one is that the seam at the bottom of the flowy part started unraveling within 2 washes.  It'll be an easy fix though.  It was super inexpensive though, so you get what you pay for."
4.0,Cheap kids beanies for like .50 a piece. They are for emergency kits-so the fact that the colors are ugly doesn’t matter to me. They are as advertised!
4.0,"I got these as a backup pair to keep in my car. But, they are pretty nice and have become one of my favorite pairs."
4.0,If it had pockets it would be perfect.
4.0,"Cute pattern, thin"
4.0,The dress looked awesome. I wore it for a birthday party and received many compliments. The only thing I didn't like is that there's visible tuck line in the bust in the front. But I forgive that for the overall look
4.0,"A couple of tassels fell off within minutes of wearing it, but really a cute group of boho bracelets."
4.0,Cute but I got my order with black marks on both sleeves!! I bought all 3 colors. I’m so mad!
4.0,LOVE my dress for Christmas dinner! The material is a little on the thin side. but that's alright for me so I don't get too hot. The zipper is hard to get on and off by yourself. There is a slip under but it isn't the same length as the skirt. I ordered my usual size which is a medium.
4.0,"Very bright, the material is very thin. Nice colors , I am not sure if the color will stay if I wash it. Very nice size."
4.0,Its nice. Its made in china so lets see how long it lasts.
4.0,My friend loves dragon flies and dangly thing so this hit it right on the nose. colorful also.
4.0,The material is thinner than I thought but is a great and flattering design.
4.0,"medium is way too small for a 5'10''-5'11'' man. XL would fit, but medium is 4 inches too short."
4.0,I am 5'7'' and this fits about the middle of my butt. I wanted to wear this with leggings for when shirts ride up but it is a little too short for this purpose. Also I wish the straps were adjustable. Otherwise the quality seems good for an undershirt tank top.
4.0,"The sleeves are a bit short, I just push them up."
4.0,"It looked great but I should have gone with xxl and not xl for my athletic but tall (6’3”) brother in law. It’s not too long and while it fit in the chest, I should have gone up a size. It would have perhaps been long enough but looked boxy. I am still rating it four stars because usual may work for the average built guys well."
4.0,"I am average height, 5'4&#34;-5'5&#34; and 128 lbs. I bought a size medium and it fits perfectly except the sleeves are slightly too short. I feel like I'm constantly pulling them down because my whole wrist is exposed."
4.0,"Very cute design, but not practical for big bosomed ladies. It works well enough though even with high intensity workouts. I was hoping for more coverage but because I am well endowed the top of the bra was pulled down low. I was hoping it would be tight enough to give me coverage like the picture. It's not a bad buy at all and I would buy more because the price is so good and they are comfy. But if you want a full coverage sports bra and you are bigger than a C cup, this might not be for you."
4.0,"I'm 5'1&#34; tall and 145 lbs weight, and this top fit ok. A little short on the shoulder but still ok. My friends also said looks great on me. Very comfortable fabric. I ordered the black one and asked to change to the navy one. The customer service is very responsive and helpful. Hope they keep the service that way. I order my second one in white."
4.0,I bought this as a gift for my friend. She loves it.
4.0,I wear a 10/12 and have thicker legs and got this in a L and it fits great.<br /><br />1. The pattern is cute and the fabric feels good on. They are thicker cotton and dont feel like flimsy workout shorts or anything.<br />2. The waist band isn't overly tight so doesnt squidh out any rolls. You can easily tighten with the adjustable waist band if needed.<br />3. I personally like the length! I am 5'3 and I like that they are short but not buttcheek short. I feel comfortable wearing thesr chasing my kids and not worrying about showing my ass or looking frumpy. If you *do* prefer shorter shorts yoi can easily roll the waistband<br /><br />Overall these are good shorts for warmer weather!
4.0,"Ultimately, too fragile for every day use. But it looks nice."
4.0,"I like the money clip, it makes getting money out easy."
4.0,Very satisfied! The shoes are beautiful and super comfortable with the exception of a little pinching on the back of my heel from the zipper.
4.0,"This is a very nice watch. Just the right size, not too big not too small. Very nice. Looks better than the pictures. Arrived on time."
4.0,"John's wife speaking:<br />These are very nice earrings. I like them a lot and plan to wear them a lot. If I could, the only thing I would change is making the chain part a little shorter. They dont have the style of long dangly ""black dress earrings"" but the length makes them seem like they're trying to be. It's kind of an awkward length."
4.0,Love wearing this shirt and remembering when the Broncos were great.
4.0,"Made in China. Definitely take note of the pic of the model. The waistline sits high and may not work for larger busts sizes. Note also the high neckline so you do need to use zipper to get it on.<br />The color is a very dark teal green (more green than blue and much darker than the pic.)<br />I plan to get a coordinating belt or ribbon, because the elastic looks unfinished IMHO.<br />I wear it with skinny pants because it is only 36.5 inches in length from shoulder and sits higher than I would like above my knee. I have wide shoulders and the sleeves are not long enough. About 2 inches above my hand joint.<br /><br />Other than that I think this dress is cute and well-constructed. The high waist hides a belly. The lace is heavier and durable and it is lined with a lightweight polyester. It has a zipper going down the back which zips fairly smoothly. There is matching delicate lace trim around neck and cuffs."
4.0,Used it on my guitar. Like the pick holder very handy.
4.0,I should have ordered a size larger. normally wear a 36C should have ordered a 38C.
4.0,"The dress itself is nice, material and quality wise. It's just too big for the size."
4.0,Nice material. Ordered x large. Still a bit small. Comfy. But I'm sure after 1 wash. It will shrink.
4.0,Product fit good but material seems rather thin!
4.0,"wife loves them, they are alittle small for the size"
4.0,"I live them, they are fashionable and the colors are beautiful, they could be a little softer"
4.0,Nice red tone. Fits as described. A tad thin though.
4.0,"I bought this for my 9 year old. The hat is well made, but the bill is HUGE, even for an adult sized hat. It looks very awkward."
4.0,Its nice but I tried to put a pendant on it and the end of the chain was too fat
4.0,Light and clear lenses.  I was hoping for some cat eye affect.  Good glasses though.
4.0,"Nice Does what it supposed to do, has a slight odor though. hopefully it will vanish."
4.0,"They look cool,"
4.0,This was a gift and the person loved it...fit was great.
4.0,Estas si fueron de mi agrado
4.0,"The watch looks amazing. Build quality is pretty good on it. Has kept time accurately for several months now. My only complaint is that it’s hard to see the time, sometimes even in well lit places. Overall, well worth the price but if you’re constantly checking the time on the watch, I’d get something else."
4.0,These are very comfortable and even with a bigger belly they do not roll down when exercising.  The print is cute and fun.  With pockets on each side it makes it easy to carry your keys and your phone.
4.0,My son loved it. The fit is just st right. It looks fashionable on my boy but the fabric seems thin to me.
4.0,"I love this top, it has served me well this summer.  I didn't care for the bottoms at all (tight, uncomfortable, and unflattering) and ended up wearing other swim shorts with the top."
4.0,They are ok.. not as thick as I was expecting.
4.0,This product is greatly recommended for adults use not best for 9year old kid. Waterproof. Good product!
4.0,"It arrived quite stiff as if ironed, but after an initial laundering it has been very comfortable and roomy. I really enjoy it on colder nights. It seems to be wearing well, better than expected from some other reviews."
4.0,"I really like this dress. The colour and pattern is exactly like the picture. The dress is a little larger than expected though. I ordered my usual size and I definitely could have sized down.  The material is nice and light. Also, the dress is a lot longer than it appears in the picture. It hits me mid calf, so I will be getting it altered. Otherwise I love everything about this dress!"
4.0,"Product needed a little tweak with changing around the straps on the top cover pouch but seems good quality, could use more organization pockets inside."
4.0,Cute shirt! Fits true to size  but I wish it was a tiny bit longer. Ordered a medium but I’m pretty tall so can’t really wear with leggings. Other than that it’s super cute!
4.0,"Super cute! The straps are a little cheap looking and the cup holder is basically useless if you have the bag somewhat full. Other than that, I really like it."
4.0,I like these because acrylic doesn't react with my skin. I was slightly disappointed there is no 10g but still a good deal.
4.0,"I love them,  very comfortable and sturdy"
4.0,"Muy bonitos, solo un poco fragiles. Excelentes por su precio."
4.0,"Super cute top but it was a wee bit too small... decided to regift it to my mom who is smaller than me and she loves it! The material is really comfy too, I would size up on this one though"
4.0,"Very well constructed of nice sturdy material. Gone are the days of flimsy inferior products. This is a product in line with its retail value, which I might say is fairly inexpensive. The product has many zippered compartments and the zippers work well. It also has th standard sleeping bag compartment below and the water bottle holders, but it has some nice zippered smaller areas for wallet cellphone keys etc..."
4.0,Beautiful and trendy but the earrings loosen quickly. They haven’t fallen off yet but I won’t be surprised if they do. But for the price it’s worth it. I also like that you can wear them two ways.  These are a great dupe for the designer version. At this price I’ll probably get a back up pair.
4.0,Nice not bad but the one I got looks darker in color.
4.0,Nice love it only reasons give 4 flower is too big uncomfortable to wear
4.0,"Seriously was a well made dress...very heavy and a beautiful pattern. I truly wish it did fit, but was WAY WAY WAY too small. I wear a 14-16 US size women. I am 5'8&#34; about 170 and very curvy...barely got it over my shoulders and totally squashed my boobs. Not sure what this company uses as a mannequin for sizing and proportions...but it's certainly not a  'normal' sized woman. Had to send back...which was very easy to do thankfully."
4.0,"They are high quality, but I don't like things tight. Once I get the elastic stretched out a bit I will love them!"
4.0,Original purchase was smaller than expected--replaced by vendor very quickly and easily. Kudos!!<br />The shirt itself is very cute and good quality.
4.0,"Appear to be good quality. Nice leather, nice color. Can't comment on durability as I've only had them  a week. Fit true to size. (My hand measures 6.5 and the 6.5 fits.). Fingers are slightly long -- about 3/8s of an inch. This is not unusual and not the worst I've experienced. My middle finger measures about 2 5/8s inches long, for reference."
4.0,These were just what I wanted. A cheep light wight bag for my glasses. They protect my glasses in my pocket.
4.0,"I love the way this bra looks and feels, however, it’s a pain to get on and off."
4.0,It’s a nice sweater but the only complaint I have is the button for the eye fell off the sweater.
4.0,Just the right amount of sparkle and priced right.
4.0,What I expect them to be
4.0,I love these glasses. I use prescription lenses. But these work well. I’m still able to see things fairly well. They are great working outside in the bright light. And they look great.
4.0,"Super cute and comfortable, and decent for price. Only negative thing I have to say is when I opened the baggy, one of the gem rings came off the jewelry so I had to super glue it back on, which isn’t terrible. Easy fix. Other that worth the buy!"
4.0,"I really like these earrings, but the backs don't stay on very well.  I thought I lost one and found it the next day in my baby's crib!!  Just make sure you put different backs on them before you wear them!"
4.0,"Very nice material, however I feel it’s gives a lot of room so therefore it’s stretches. I wear an XL, ordered an XL- and it was big- I could’ve gotten a Large. Also, the pants are way too long, even with heels. However, I think it’s pretty but will need alterations unless you’re really tall.<br /><br />Plan to sell....didn’t wear."
4.0,"Great joggers, even for shorter people.<br />Light weight, soft fabric. Very comfortable and stylish. Likely I’ll buy another pair."
4.0,"Lovely, DAINTY threaders. The &#34;eye&#34; is about a 1/4&#34; wide and 1/2&#34; long. Nice quality, though. And when I wore them, I got compliments that they sparkled, so this was a happy accident."
4.0,I am very pleased with this and recommend to anyone having trouble getting up in the morning no dought that it saved me from losing my job
4.0,The product is good but poor packaging
4.0,"Fits great, Looks good"
4.0,This is adorable. Im really happy with it
4.0,"Wish this dress came in xs! I am 5’2”, 130lbs I belted it to look a little more fitted and it worked for Florida winter weather! It is heavier materiel so keeps you warm!"
4.0,"I like it's no iron, but I think I need a cotton blend for comfort."
4.0,Top of the boot is snugger than i would have liked.  Makes wearing any sort of pant other than skinny jeans or leggings difficult as there's no room to push down extra fabric.  But the design is so cute and unique I'm keeping them anyway.
4.0,Another cute dress. I wouldn’t put it in the category of show stopper but a cute dress that you will likely get compliments on. I’m considering getting a wide belt to wear with it.
4.0,"Wish it was a bit longer but I'm tall...oh well.<br />Cheap material, but you get what you pay for."
4.0,Ideal coat to travel with. Rolls up with ease and makes a great head rest to sleep on when on the plane! Warmth factor isn’t that high but suitable enoghy fircwhen transitioning from destination points! Overall a great bang for your buck and fits the bill for traveling?
4.0,"This is a very cute outfit! Was a big hit at my xmas party! It is slightly shorter than I expected, barely covers my behind but bought velvet leggings and looks great. I wear a small and it just fit maybe slightly tight. The belt was a little large so I used one of my own!"
4.0,A few lights did not work and many of them had the stuck buttons.
4.0,They feel like a regular sock not big at all
4.0,Nice top over all. Fast delivery.
4.0,"Happy with my purchase. Runs a little small in the bust, but overall, I'm pleased. 😊"
4.0,I use it to tie up my natural hair. I almost bought a natural hair tie for 10 for one. Then I read about how the tie was made of satin and decided to buy this instead. By the way got two hair ties much very cheap.
4.0,"Beautiful!!! I absolutely love it and shipping was fast, the only problem is that I've noticed it doesn't keep its glow for longer than 2-3 minutes no matter how long you let it charge in direct light."
4.0,"These Kissing Whales are really cute. They look exactly like the pictures. Some things to be aware of: these keychains are not magnetic! I thought the whales were magnetic and attached to each other by the mouth, but they just put them together that way for a better picture. Second, these keychains are very heavy, far more so than most other keychains.I put the rose gold one on my keys. It makes me smile, but also feels like the weight of my keys has doubled. The dark grey one I put on my bag as a zipper pull. I tucked the end of the zipper inside my bag because I didn't want the keychain swinging around and banging into the hardware on my bag. Good thing I did because the silver chain attachment snapped off one day after I put the grey whale keychain on my bag. I found the silver whale inside my bag, which I'm happy about but I don't know what to do with a keychain that can't be attached to anything. The rose gold one has managed to stay on my keys. For now.<br />These are very cute keychains and worth buying, so long as you keep in mind that they're inexpensive and are not meant to last long."
4.0,"I'm a solid small based on their size chart and these ""compression"" shirts are baggy. They fit like a normal shirt would, with some room to move. If you want a tight fit and have that compression feel like it's advertised for, I'd size down."
4.0,"My stats: 5' 3.5"", 143 lbs, 38” bust, 32"" waist, 38"" hips, 26"" inseam, 10” front rise.<br />Item: Medium, Pale aqua, 82% polyester 18% spandex.<br />Pros: Comfortable and leg length is good. Pockets are deep so my Pixel 3 XL phone with Moment case doesn't stick out at all.<br />Cons: Something about the material, maybe it's too thin or stretchy, that you can see every bump and cellulite on my legs. Not very flattering.<br />Decision: Returned."
4.0,"I love the cap.  The pom is a little fuzzy, but it  still is really cute!"
4.0,Runs a little small. Otherwise love them!  Keep me dry and warm at outdoor sporting events.
4.0,I like em alot.... I just don't love em
4.0,Very cute. I Was hoping the ball backing behind the lobe would be larger but overall happy with them for the price.
4.0,"This dress is very glamorous, and fine for short term especially for the price.  The zipper must be handled carefully. The tail of the zipper tends to flip up and out prior to zipping and the sequins must be carefully navigated at the top of the upper back. Threads could use some knotting espeically at the tail of the zipper. As others have said it is way long, fabric is thin, sequins a little rough where the arms meet the dress.  I usually wear a large but ordered a medium due to reviews. So it is mostly a bit snug on me, but works with spanx.  I bought 3 for a stage routine with 2 other women. The other 2 women wear medium and it was great on them. One was very tall and we shortened hers about 2&#34; still.  We all had to take in the underarm area of the dress as it gaps, but that was a quick fix."
4.0,I haven't had a chance to wear them yet but I was very pleased for the price. They are very nice.
4.0,"The lenses are nice and clear, and they work well for those of us who need progressive or multi-focal correction.  That said, the frames are flimsy and the lenses scratch easily - I would have given them two or three stars if it were not for the low price.  I will keep looking for a better product, of course at a higher price."
4.0,These shorts were fine. They were okay in comfort although I wish the waist were a little more adjustable. They looked okay. I am short and I felt like they may have been better for someone a little taller. The look was fine. They seemed well made and durable. They were an okay thickness.
4.0,It's soft but not very flattering on
4.0,"well made, leg holes a little loose but ok, I guess these are designed to handle ex footballers"
4.0,Delivery was quick.<br />The outfit was nice.the top was my fav<br />The fit log the leggings were okay a little baggy in the crotch area and I got a size small and I'm 5'6 145lb
4.0,My 8 yo liked it. The glow does not last long though.
4.0,"Bottom is too small, but it looks real nice."
4.0,I almost love these! They are NOT see through which is a huge deal to me and pass the squat test and they are very soft. I’m normally a Large but read reviews and ordered an XL BUT I wish I had stuck with the Large...for reference I’m 5’5” and 170 with a butt and hips! They are just a little too big. But I will order again and get a large.
4.0,"Vibrant colors. Easy wear. Fabric feels a bit cheap.but, for the price, I’d say it is a great find for Halloween. Love the cat graphic!"
4.0,"It works and looks good and I do wear it frequently, but it is definitely not a plus size. Buy a couple of sizes bigger. Does not slide around or roll up either. Does it's job. I just use it as an insert in low cut clothing, not as an actual top though."
4.0,maybe a tad small but my last pair 20 year old I mite ad was a tad big so they fit ok size. 45
4.0,Bought for my girlfriend. She loves them.
4.0,The pants are super comfortable and soft.  The fit is true to size.  I love the print.  I would give 5 stars except that they are slightly transparent in the butt when I bend over.
4.0,"This dress is well made, fabric is thick and substantial.  I thought I would love it but the color purple was not a vibrant deep purple as my monitor showed, it appeared a bit faded even though I am sure it was not.  I was just hoping for a deeper purple color.  I ordered a size 10 which is XL via China sizes, it was snug in the hip area maybe because I am 39 in the hip and the dress measured 39.5 in that area. I am 36 29 39 and weigh 137 lbs and am 5'5'' tall.  The waist is a bit loose but will be ok.  I guess I could take up in the princess seam in the back.  But I do like it, it is a pretty stylish design, and unusual.  Will be nice to wear in colder months with tights and black boots.  Hem hits right at the knee. Hope this is a help to any of you  ladies thinking of buying,  I really wish I would have chosen another color."
4.0,These bottoms and the accompanying short sleeve top are my go to ensemble for working from home during COVID.
4.0,"Ran quite large, but it should shrink in the dryer. My granddaughter liked the fact that it was footed and voted to keep it. Colors were pretty and fabric soft and comfy. Overall, pleased with purchase."
4.0,a little thin for athletic sox.
4.0,"I ordered this as I was about to attend a party and I am glad I ordered it! So many good comments from people, what else do you need! It made my day!!"
4.0,"The hat in it self is fine, just the clasp for hat size is something I've never witnessed before.  In trying to adjust the size of the hat the clasp broke off first try!  I'll have to jury rig it right off the bat."
4.0,It's cute but it's good for a cheap watch it's a little brown on the inside but you get for what u pay for
4.0,I really likes this blouse but the size seemed to run small. It was tight through my shoulders so I returned it. The quality was good and it looked like it would wash well. I wish it had fit.
4.0,These are a great deal so I didn't expect them to be so warm and soft. I actually bought a  couple more for gifts and I highly recommend!!
4.0,"I am a XL I bought a XL and since its very stretchy its a little big, very comfortable but I like it feeling tight in me or else I think it's going to fall"
4.0,Ordered two one of them is perfect and it’s easily my favorite hat. Easy to use all around. The 2nd one one of the lenses came right out after opening the package like it never had glue on it at all.
4.0,Somewhat small but they stretched out over after a couple of days.
4.0,"It looks better in person. Ruffle is made well. The sleeve on the off the shoulder side is extremely small & cut off my circulation,  so I removed it."
4.0,The dress fit me great! I got a medium. Love how the top is more fitting & bottom is more flowy! Also super comfortable material!
4.0,"Very pretty but too small for my arm. I'm not a huge person, just an average size American woman. I had to add a few links to it but it wasn't a problem since I make jewelry I had the supplies at home."
4.0,These are nice leggings but it doesn’t live up to the hype. I bought them because so many ppl loved them. They fit too high on the stomach so it rolls down. I thought maybe I bought the wrong size so I sized up and that wasn’t it. Maybe because I’m short. It’s nice for going out and about or around the house but I would not wear them for workouts.
4.0,It's cotton and it's very comfortable. Alot of washes will wear it out quickly but  it's a reasonable price. For work they a practical because of the pockets.
4.0,Cute top... heavier material than I thought. Runs true to size
4.0,"I would have given these 5 stars, but the red and blue pairs fit perfectly, and the black fits as if it's 1 size smaller. It's a struggle to get them up all the way.<br /><br />Aside from that, I love the material. Very smooth feeling, decent compression. Nice sized pockets, good length."
4.0,Comfy material!
4.0,Color size and style and price
4.0,"its good, cute"
4.0,"I went my the chart pictured with the dress, due to the stretch in the material I should have sized down one. I will be altering it slightly to get a more snug fit."
4.0,"Such cute earrings! Perfect for summer. My only complaint, the earrings are not as big as I expected. I was hoping for larger earrings but they are lightweight & cute!"
4.0,Very small. But good and cute!
4.0,"I'm 5'2&#34; and 130 lbs. I bought a small and it fits great. Not too tight and not too loose. It looks very nice. However it is very thin...more like a blouse material which doesnt bother me but I just didn't expect it. I have somewhat muscular arms due to lifting and the sleeves are RIGHT there. But since this jacket has a nice amount of stretch to it, there is zero amount of feeling uncomfortable"
4.0,"Love this band. Seems to be made very well and is easy to use. Love using this band while working out, to help my wrist breathe."
4.0,Like this top.  It fits well and seems to be well made.
4.0,"They are slim fitting, order size up.  Cute and comfy!"
4.0,"Larger than I expected, but very pretty."
4.0,"while i like this good quality hat that looks good, it does seem hot and i would like more ventilation"
4.0,These are really pretty and it's very hard to find earrings that dangle like this for non-pierced ears.  I really like them.
4.0,I disliked design of the u pouch it cuts up on the inside of the scrotal sac behind the testicles after a while. This is very uncomfortable so I could not enjoy them all day !☹️
4.0,"Wondered about the sizing… But the fabric is stretchy and yet not clingy,… I’m only 5’2” and 140 pounds and medium fit perfectly. Fabric is much lighter/thinner  than I thought it would be but that’s OK with me here in way too hot Florida."
4.0,"I was looking for a pair of non polarized glasses to wear over my prescription ones that would allow me to see my phone.  These do that and being somewhat large, cover the others."
4.0,Nice but didn't match.
4.0,"Overall good gift, stopped working after a few uses"
4.0,It’s pretty but I haven’t has a chance to wearing it!
4.0,"Fit is perfect. Material is stretchy, was hoping they would not be.  SUPER soft. Will get in more colors"
4.0,Love this swimsuit. The front of the top is just a bit smaller than in the photo but it's still cute.
4.0,"This was a gift for a Japanese friend. It was supposed to be her name. I don't know the Japanese language, all I can say is the necklace looks nothing like the way she writes her name. In hindsight it would have been nice to see what I was getting before submitting the order - perhaps there are different ways to spell her name in her language.  Anyway, I want to say the necklace was very nicely made and appears to be a high quality item. It came quickly and was in a nice box. I did order it in Rose colored gold and it came in regular gold..... Not happy about that but it really doesn't matter because it's going in the bin,  I can't really give it to her because it's not her name - don't really know what it is. Yes, I gave 4 stars for the quality and quick delivery, don't know if the wrong characters are their mistake or not. I'd have liked to send them an image of her name in Japanese, that wasn't an option."
4.0,Its a lil smaller then i like but looks ok. Thank u
4.0,"This band breathed new life into my Casio MDV 108, 200m Diver's Watch.  It is a great replacement to the stock plastic band which inevitably cracks and breaks.  Also it looks like it is custom made for this watch.  The only downside is that the band is pretty hard to install.  On the one I received the metal flanges that the spring pins go through arrived slightly bent and thus didn't line up with the holes in the watch.  This was extremely frustrating until I realized the problem and bent the flanges out a bit to allow the pins to line up.  I pulled a star for the frustration.[[ASIN:B009KYJAJY Casio Men's MDV106-1AV 200M Duro Analog Watch, Black]]"
4.0,Nice for hiking
4.0,This product was great the second day i got it it the metal part broke but it was an easy fix
4.0,"I didn't really know what to expect when I ordered these, but the price was right. I am letting my hair grow out and it is at that awkward stage that is hard to bare. I am having a hard time keeping hair out of my face and eyes. I had been looking for bands, but either they were uncomfortable or too tight for my head and my hair is too fine to be held for long by a clip or barrette. Checked Amazon and found these ""buffs"". Love the color combination and at about $1.25 each, the price was right. When I got them I tried one on and found it a little tight but doable. I like that there are MANY ways to style them. I would have given 5 stars, but I feel that they pull up in the back a little more than I would like. I am sure that as my hair grows longer that won't be a problem. I can use these at the gym to keep my hair out of my eyes and to help keep sweat from dripping into my eyes. The colors vary so much that most bands will complement my outfits. I got 12 of them so don't expect to order another set soon, but I would recommend them. The size says fits a head circumference from 22-25 inches. Mine is 23"" and like I said they seem a little tight--but I expect them to loosen up a little after washing and use over time and, of course, when my hair is longer."
4.0,"Cute - really like the pockets although they stick out a bit, which makes the dress look more casual. It is also rather short, which is fine when I'm standing but sitting can make it look super short."
4.0,"This band has outlasted three cases for my watch! I've had it for about five months now and the magnet is still as strong as when I first got it! The color is starting to wear off at this point, but only because I have to take my watch off often at work. The rose gold is a different color than the watch, but not noticeable unless you're really staring at it. I'll likely get the Champagne color next time in the hopes that it'll be closer in color.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/6/22:<br />Woke up suddenly in the middle of the night and didn't have my watch. I was worried as to where it has gone; turns out the side that doesn't have the loop just pulled out from the socket. Glad it happened at home and not at my workplace, where there tend to be sticky fingers. Not sure if I'll be ordering a replacement yet. Lost a star for a concerning break."
4.0,"Doesn't  have sweat bands them. But other wise good, will give the pink skull one to my niece to use."
4.0,So this dress is beautiful and I love it however I followed the instructions and ordered a size bigger and it’s huge. Also it’s very transparent so have white shorts and a white bra to put under it
4.0,Great material<br />Light weight<br />Love the colors
4.0,These are great for walking my dogs at night time. I have a black Chihuahua and he's almost invisible at night. The only complaint is that I have arthritis in my hands and it's a little difficult sometimes to turn these lights on. You have to push hard to turn them on. Easy to clip on their leashes. Love the extra batteries too.
4.0,It is extremely high waisted so the elastic sits right below my bust. Would probably be great as maternity dress! Still super cute & comfy.
4.0,Cute! Mask a little &#34;cheap&#34; but overall great for a 5 yr old!
4.0,"little small, but still great"
4.0,"I bought these gloves to wear in bed when I apply cream to my hands overnight. They are thin, but durable, and they keep my hands warm. The fit is not the best oh, because the fingers are. A bit  long, but this doesn't matter"
4.0,"Chain looks exactly like the picture, beautiful color. The only thing was i order a 20 inch and the company or amazon sent me a 16 inch size."
4.0,The same observation of Karen Anderson.<br />In line with the price and description.<br />The packaging has deteriorated considering that is not the first time I buy an article CHUVORA.<br />The gasket 925 Sterling Silver Open Celtic Butterfly Pendant Necklace Jewelry for Women Silver Snake Chain 18 'was much better.<br />The presentation is also important.
4.0,"I like this shirt! It is roomy even if you order a size down like I did, but then you do have the right amount to tie in front of you. (For reference, I am 5'10&#34; and 150 lbs and I ordered a small, when I am normally a medium. The material is definitely a weird polyester, but it is pretty breathable. What I will say though, is that if you order the one with navy blue stripes, the color is a very dark navy. If you try to wear the shirt with black pants, you'll look like a referee. You won't look like a referee if you wear it with any other pants though. So, honestly, it's a plus for me--I have a cute shirt and also a Halloween costume!"
4.0,"Where I live in NYC atomic clocks are unreliable and reset only occasionally. This watch resets the time several times a day from my smart phone. Overall, the watch seems to be working very well.<br /><br />There is a design problem. The only way to see the battery level is on the phone via the app. The watch does not display battery unless the level is very low."
4.0,"This is a very comfortable outfit. Not sheer to the point of see thru. I didn’t like the belt at all, looks like a piece of unwanted string. If belt was wider I would have gave this outfit a 5 star, but the belt made it a 4"
4.0,really really nice!
4.0,My girls loved it. Color rubs off a bit when used in pool but great fit and durability
4.0,"The dress was soft and fit well. However the dress did not ship in the color I ordered. The tag and sticker on the plastic bag say purple however the color is clearly burgundy which I did not want. I’ll have to return for that reason but the dress was pretty and comfortable. If it was the correct color I would have given 5 stars. (Update) in the daylight the dress reads slightly more purple. I am on the fence to keep or return. Their purple might just be this weird plum burgandy color.<br />Update : I ordered a second one just to confirm this burgundy color really is the purple and it wasn’t just the wrong one sent. They sent the exact same color. So their purple is actually a plum, burgundy color. Not the magenta, jewel tone pictured."
4.0,I ordered these masks for an upcoming Disney World vacation. They arrived fast and they are so pretty in person. I love the fabric and the colors but sadly they are much too large for my average size face. The fabric hangs below my chin and makes my face look long. Thank you Amazon for free returns!
4.0,These are very cute. But I did not give 5 stars because they are obviously an off white or almost yellow (see photo).
4.0,Looks very nice and not cheap looking.
4.0,"More of an orange red, not red red"
4.0,"Well made, sturdy and convenient"
4.0,So cute! My daughters all wore a version of this for Halloween. They looked good and it held up so several events. They have even worn the outfit to school.
4.0,Very pleased.  Purchased for my Wife and she loves it. Fast shipping and Great item for the price. Thank you
4.0,Cute and adorable. Vibrant colors and fit true to size.
4.0,"They go perfect with many of my favorite looks. And they also complete the &#34;messy bun and sweatshirt&#34; look! I love them. However one thing i noticed is that it is a little crooked, but it is not very noticeable."
4.0,Same above
4.0,Looks fine but haven’t used yet I’m sure it will work fine.
4.0,"I usually wear underwires, but once in a while I need a break. These are very nice bras with stretchy lace and good form that offers moderate support, enough to wear to work and look nice. I usually wear a 40C but I ordered the XL because I thought there would be a little more room for comfort; however, they seem to run small. The cup size is okay, but could be a touch bigger, and I have to adjust a bit when I put it on. The plastic boning in the sides had to be taken out of the beige one because it was very bent out of shape. It supports just find without it. These will be great weekend bras."
4.0,"My daughter wanted this, and I'm guessing it was fine, because she never complained about it."
4.0,"Ahh so good looking, great design. But, I do not have a large wrist and it doesn't fit. What's up with that. Measuring my wrist and the measurement given, how could this be? I have 2 more in my cart. If I cant wear them and want one, who is listening? I guess gifts for tiny tiny wrists.<br />Perhaps an accounting of accuracy in manufacturing and come on, another inch?<br />Contacted seller, was surprised that item is made in China. Anyway an extra inch out of the question."
4.0,"the color is great, but the fabric is thinner than I like"
4.0,"Great stretch and fabric but did run a little large  and it has a little hip added to it instead of just a straight down ,soooo that could've been a factor i have slender hips , so I'd order a size smaller the stretch is great ,and even though it's not a perfect fit for me , it's an easy fix and I still love this dress"
4.0,very good product that does a good job of polishing tarnished jewelry.
4.0,My wife loved these boots for christmas. She only disliked the fitment. While it was ok in the toe area the width was on the small side. Good quality overall however.
4.0,"They were much bigger than expected and fit as if they were at least 2 sizes bigger than labeled, however they were also quite short. The material is nice and high quality, but we were surprised to see that there wasn't a single real pocket in them. They served their purpose and were a good deal at the discounted price, but I would never have purchased them at regular price."
4.0,"Not the best I've owned, but still great."
4.0,"This outfit is adorable! My daughter is just growing into 2T, she’s a chunky baby, and this was way too tight on her. I’ll have to order again in a bigger size."
4.0,"Size 7 g-gold, length is the same as size 7 crocs but definitely narrow. This size has velcro closure and a half inch wedge-heel. Pretty color."
4.0,The tools were just what I wanted in excellent condition.
4.0,This is a perfect little necklace/bracelet combo for the price
4.0,"This was my first time wearing a chocker. It is beautiful on and well made. I received many compliments. However, the bracelet was awkward. It is hard to put on and almost impossible to make it tight enough to say in place. (Changing the way the bracelet hooks my help). Other then that, I would have given 5 stars."
4.0,"Nixon packaging is always great and I'm never disappointed in the product itself. The band itself felt like a durable nylon strap. Great for your everyday casual men's look. I bought as a gift for my boyfriend, the one disappointment is I needed to install a new battery the day it arrived. It came with the battery but the watch wasn't working."
4.0,"One thing about Gloria Vanderbilt you can count on is that they think all women need a long zipper in front.  I don't.  I fold my pants over once in the front.  Other than that, these are great!"
4.0,"Love the umbrella<br />How ever, when taking the sleeve off, the velcro tab that holds the two ends together, one end is being held on by a single stitch"
4.0,"Like many others said, the ruching is on my lower back.. Not butt. That's ok for me because I use them with a tunic or dress. Very see through! I'm a seamstress so I know a teensy bit about fabric and this will definitely snag and run easily. I would prob purchase again."
4.0,"Definitely great for the price. The material looks good and the fit is great. The only thing I would say is that the stitching is not the greatest, some reinforcement could be good. The wiring that holds part of the tootoo needs the reinforcement. I would recommend it overall."
4.0,Runs a like a slim fit. Order size up.
4.0,Runs small nice material
4.0,Fit well while working out.  Gives flexibility and comfort
4.0,"I like that it’s easy to put it on and take it off. Good price too I recommend this to others. Only one thing, I was also looking for In navy color too."
4.0,I thought it would be more like a solid cotton tee shirt.  It's nice but not what I expected
4.0,"Cute cheap dress. Not great for an awards show Like the Emmys but if you have an Amish wedding to attend, grab a bonnet and this dress. You’ll fit right in."
4.0,"I really havent had a chance to wear them for only a moment since i have had them.  They seem to cave in when i walk around the ankles, but not uncomforable for the short time i have wore them.  I did buy a size larger as most of the reviews state they fit small.  And the size larger fit well.  So far no complaints.  As i am a huge fan of under armour.  I havent bought an under armour product yet that has dissappointed."
4.0,Comfortable. Good Value
4.0,"These seem to be comfortable and not cheaply made. Fabricia slightly thicker than I thought it would be. Only available in the one size fits all but I figured I'd give it ago. I am 5'3 and weigh 170lbs and am in a size 11/12 in pants right now after having my baby and still have looser skin on my stomach. I wish these came up a little higher on the butt, (I do have a rounder backside) but otherwise fit great!"
4.0,Order one size larger if you want to get into it. I wear an XLarge or in some shirts a Large but I need an XXLarge for this shirt.  The XL were way too tight.
4.0,The glasses are very cute. I've received many compliments on them. They shipped and arrived at a decent time
4.0,Umm. Kinda bummed. Thought I ordered a size bigger so the hoodie would be a little baggy but even at large it barely fit.  I like the look and quality of the fabric but I may have to return it.
4.0,"A great value.  The material is very soft, which does not allow it to keep a crisp shape, but it is very functional for a $9 bow tie."
4.0,"I love the leggings. They are super comfortable.  I am like a size 10/12 and they fit great.  I'm not sure if the solid colors would look the same, but I love the prints and how they camouflage everything. I'm giving them four stars merely because I have not washed them or had them very long.  I do not do the expensive ones or know anything about the expensive ones… but for the price I paid for these I will definitely be ordering more."
4.0,Very detailed and accurate look at a Ouija board game.<br />Only 4 stars due to size. Everything else about these earrings is very good.<br />I also bought the matching necklace. Which is larger detail.
4.0,Large fits nicely
4.0,"I just got this Samsonite piece today. The size looks perfect for my needs, which will be used as a briefcase to and from work and for traveling. There was some debating in the reviews if computers could fit in the front compartment. My 15&#34; MacBook Pro does not fit in the very front pocket that zips (not even close), but it does fit in the other larger compartment that zips. There is a pouch that has snaps inside and it will fit nicely in there. I do agree with other reviewers that the handle does not feel secure and is a little wobbly. I am not sure if there is a way to make it sturdier, but as long as it works and doesn't break I am ok with it. I like all of the pockets and the wheels are smooth when pulled along the tile in my house. The wheels also work fine on the back two if you want to pull it behind you during travel. I think one reviewer said it dragged, but it was very smooth. The material of the bag seems like it's good quality too. The real test will be when I travel. Will it fit under the seat as it claims? I will update my review once I find out. I may also update my review again, once I actually fill my bag up and use it to and from work."
4.0,Returned it because it was very long.  Please credit my account.
4.0,The dress was a bit too long for me but that is an easy fix
4.0,"all the socks fit slightly differently, the black and purple ones in this set didn't fit me at all though."
4.0,Nothing negative.
4.0,"Look great, fit great all around good"
4.0,Nice material and very comfortable. Fit as expected and actually went back and ordered 2 more pair in different colors.
4.0,"These leggings are OK.  They are kinda short, not very thick, not really great in any way, but acceptable.<br /><br />I wanted really nice leg warmers like the ones I had in 1983 ..."
4.0,I am 5'7 and wear a size 14. These are great quality but on the large size in both the waist and the legs. They are actually big around my calves which makes them look kinda weird because they are not fitted where they should be. Other than that- the material is great and not see through like alot of legging. I would recommend going down a size.
4.0,WAY TOO SMALL<br />Update.  Originally reviewed for my husband's hands but they're ok for my hands. Perfect for my 10 year old.
4.0,Love the socks from the standpoint of style.  I just wish the fabric stretched a bit; they're somewhat tight on me.
4.0,Love the quality of the shirt and the graphics. The one down side is the use solid reflective striping that doesn’t have a lot of give to it. And it is 360 deg. around your torso then add in the shoulder stripes and your actual size shirt feels a little constrictive.
4.0,"This fit as expected, and color was right, as I needed it to match a jersey."
4.0,"I do wish the card/wallet section had the separate zipper.  Great color and pretty good construction, good buy."
4.0,Very nice. I get a lot of compliments on it. Only bad thing is that the chains are delicate.
4.0,"I bought these for my nine year old, and everything fit good but the hate is just smaller."
4.0,The US equivalent of small is fine but I wish it could be tighter. The color is pretty accurate and the mesh hits in just the right places. The color mesh (as opposed to black or white) kind of gives a double take before you realize what you're seeing- a fun look. Would be perfect if it was more fitted/structured in the back but for the price it's great.
4.0,"I own a similar pair that I purchased at target.it is about the same with the convenience of the pocket,  different texture comparatively with the one from Target. the Target one is very breathable whereas this one feels a little heavy on the skin. but both did the work and I am satisfied with the outcome."
4.0,"I loved the color and it is super comfortable.. a little larger than I expected.  I am 5'5, 180 pounds, 36DD...normally wear a size 10/12.  I bought the large but it is very roomy... almost too wide, I think I should have gone with the medium."
4.0,"It's wonderful and the magnet clasp is perfect. The only issue is that the size was not posted and this is much shorter than I would have liked. If you are a petite or skinny person this is wonderful but for those of us who are more voluptuous, this won't work LOL."
4.0,rings are sturdy and split rings are small just enough for one or two keys. split rings are tight so you need to be patient when adding keys.
4.0,"This is a preliminary rating because I've only worn the pants twice and have yet to launder them. However, the fit is good and they seem durable enough hiking through South Florida swamps. There is no rear hip pocket on either side, which is a bit of a drawback, but the front pockets are ample and two have zipper closings."
4.0,Very Comfy. A little big.
4.0,"This was a nice dress, you would need to wear leggings/tights under it. Lightweight material and true to color. It runs larger than expected, so I had to return."
4.0,"It works, very cute but is made of nickel so your skin will turn green if worn constantly or wet...rotate sites or put on another piece of jewelry and don’t get wet."
4.0,I ordered a 3x and it was a tad tighter than I expected but I wear any way.  I love the t-shirt and always get a comment about Paris when doing so.
4.0,They did fit my boyfriend's feet. He has long narrow feet & they fit perfectly.<br /><br />My feet were just to wide for these socks despite the fact that they are made with some Spandex.<br /><br />They stretch a little bit but not as much as I expected or needed.<br /><br />I found the sock design a little odd with the weird lines of colors but my boyfriend didn't seem to mind.
4.0,"Thay arent crazy too small but they are snug compared to my non-fleece ones that are one size down. Still like them and they can fool the eye as if youre wearing regular jeans, but also was sent 2 of the blue pairs instead of one grey and one blue which is fine i will wear them but definitely wanted the 2 different ones."
4.0,came out a bit rusty right off the package.
4.0,"Pretty much what you'd expect for the price and description. The lenses are HUGE and one of them keeps lightly suctioning itself to my face, but that's a tiny complaint."
4.0,"Very pretty, just like the photo.  Only problem, it was way too big for my daughter who wanted a small.  She is usually a size 3 Misses.  It is difficult because of the style to buy a dress like this without trying it on first.  Had to return it."
4.0,"i got a small, regularly an xs, and i think it fits well but runs a little big. i wish there was an xs options. cloth is nice and i like how I can tie the waist to fit my own waist. length is nice. I am 4’11 and it comes right above my knees after tying and fluffing up the top. it’s a super cute dress overall and I like how different it is"
4.0,Love this bag!  It's not too big or small.  Especially like the separate shoe compartment and open air panel.
4.0,Its a nice assortment of belly rings that fit as expected. I only gave it four stars because it arrived a day later than I was told it would.
4.0,"Runs small. I ordered an extra large and it was to small I’m normally a large, also it’s wider than it is long.  But quality was as expected"
4.0,"Very comfy, soft and stay in place. Still show with some of my flats unfortunately."
4.0,Fit the purpose very well
4.0,I did not wear it yet. I bought it cause it’s cute and pretty
4.0,"Love Amanda jeans.  Very comfortable.  Ordered High Rise waist, however, got classic rise.  Not too much difference, decided to keep it.  Longer than expected even though short was ordered."
4.0,Should have ordered a size up.<br />Still comfortable though :)<br />But my husband likes them so 4 star
4.0,Had hoped for a little larger gobbler but otherwis good value.
4.0,Bought them so long ago and they still work well
4.0,I gave these earrings to a former Furman graduate for Christmas and she absolutely loves them!
4.0,"Style and pattern were great, but too big and long on my short frame. Also, I wish the sleeves were a little looser. Product arrived quickly and refund was a breeze!"
4.0,"5'4, 145lbs. Purchased medium. Slightly loose around waist but i love the style and look. Purchased in various colors. Worth it"
4.0,"FYSA this spring/summer sweater is adorable, but (1) it runs small AND (2) is super short.  Like almost croptop short... You might be like me and not like to show off your belly button if you've popped out a couple of kids so yeah, take note!  Otherwise this is super cute."
4.0,"Does the job, no frills, but I didn't want any..."
4.0,"Love the way the dress fits and how the material is breathable, it's Perfect for those hot summer days."
4.0,"Very cute, feels well made, love the pattern. It is a loose fitting top, as the product title says, but for me it was just a little too loose fitting. I didn't feel pretty in it, maybe if it was slightly shorter like a loose crop top I'd like it better, but it's just a loose square so it looks very boxy in person. Ended up returning it, but I wish I liked it more cuz the graphic is so cool. :) Oh well..."
4.0,"I am glad I read the reviews about sizing.  I wear a 14 and choose the 3XL.  The suit fits well, is comfortable, modest, flattering  and easy to get on and off without stretching the seams.  I like how the shoulder straps are constructed for swimming, ease of movement and stay in place.  I also like the padding in the bra as it helps keep the suit in place and maintains modesty.  I really appreciate the price.  I was taught that you should spend money on a good swimsuit because it is the only thing you are wearing when you swim.  The fabric is thick and feels high quality.  I have paid much more for swimsuits that are lower in quality.  I would buy this suit again.  Another tip is to soak the suit in salt water for 24 hours before using it to prevent fading.  I have done this with all my swimsuits and haven't had one fade yet."
4.0,"Cute shirt, good fit."
4.0,Fits just fine and is comfortable.
4.0,Nicd
4.0,Fit as they should. 9 yr old says they're comfy and he loves them
4.0,"These aren't sweatproof, but they are sweat resistant.  They are more breathable than dress socks or cotton.  I still sweat in them after a full day's work, but my feet just get damp instead of soaked.  They are good at preventing blisters and peeling skin."
4.0,"These ear warmers are very comfortable to wear, and warm. I can get away from wearing a hat on most winter days, just by wearing these ear warmers. On occasion they can ride up on you while wearing them, but not that big of a deal. Overall a good purchase. I recommend these  for cold winter days."
4.0,"The cat pendant is very beautiful and quite unusual.  My only problem with this item was the chain -- it was overly thick for the product and came with a kink in it.  As I have quite a bit of jewelry, finding another chain was not a problem."
4.0,I love how this dress looks on and the design. My daughter kept giving me compliments. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the fabric is thin.
4.0,"Somewhat larger than expected but still looks cute. I'm 5'9 135lbs. And ordered a medium. I haven't washed or dried yet, but seems like a good product so far!"
4.0,Im usually a medium so I exchanged for a small which was still to big... They look great on I just needed a smaller size :(
4.0,"Smooth. It’s real ceramic. I have a Citizens eco drive to compare. It is true white, glossy, and heavy. Just like ceramic should be. Butterfly closer is medium quality. I expect it will need replacing with a better quality in a few months. Time will tell. I had to take out a few links, which need to kept, as ceramic does not hold up for marmalade wear and tear. It’s meant more for looks.<br />It is a basic band, not particularly showy, but FANTASTIC for the price."
4.0,"It's a little bit small, but I expected it to be, judging from the pics.  Very nice material & color.  Fast delivery."
4.0,Most comfy pair of shorts I’ve ever worn. They tear pretty easy if they get snagged on something. Like really really easy
4.0,100% polyester. Soft and warmer than it looks. Comfortable and I hope it wears well.
4.0,Overall not bad pjs
4.0,"Love them. With repeated wear, I can feel the non slip padding through the sock but I still really love them!!"
4.0,Ran too small - we ranch and they are perfect<br />But he usually wears a large and in These we  need xxl-  do they come in that size
4.0,"smells of chemicals when it arrives, air it out for a week minimum before use, but other than that, it's a good functional carrier, classy looking and protective!"
4.0,The dress was okay. Bought for the holidays but ultimately returned it. The material felt thin. The fit was nice and the length was good.
4.0,"This was a little tight at the neck, and definitely a unisex shirt, not for women. I ended up cutting the top to make it an off the shoulder top, and it's pretty  soft after washing. Overall I really like this for a lounge top."
4.0,narrow shoe; wore them 3 times and are beginning to break and mold to the width of my foot. love the detail that was put into the shoe product looks the same as advertised here on amazon
4.0,Love these cardigans. Good fit and comfort.
4.0,This bracelet is well made really secure bracelet.  The diamonds are not very clear but that's why the bracelet was not very expensive.  The craftmanship is excellent.  Wish the diamonds are more clear.
4.0,"Super Adorable and comfortable. Great to wear while I'm working with a headset. Only downfall was the ears don't stay straight, but that's not a deal breaker. Shipping was slow, but I expected that. Overall, a great hat."
4.0,Excellent item to wear when I am out doing bird surveys.
4.0,Very pretty. Runs a little big.
4.0,"Very cute....however, wrinkles a lot"
4.0,It made a great Christmas gift!
4.0,Lost all my hair due to chemotherapy. This will keep my head warm.
4.0,"I live in this. It is so comfortable. It is big, order the size you think you should or a size smaller."
4.0,"I love this cover. I got it in black and doesn't get dirty at all. The auto open feature works great. Only drawback is that the elastic outer band is starting to get lose, and I have only had it a few months now."
4.0,"Great quality. Bottoms I expected to be loose based on normally taking a medium in yoga style pants. They work, but a little small. Top fit as expected."
4.0,"I give it a four out of five because it is a little tight on the waist, but it fits great in the cups. Wearing it will help loosen it,  but it's a sports bra, so it will stretch and snap back into place, so maybe go up one size for the sake of comfort,  but the material is well made and the support across my back has improved."
4.0,My concern about it too small.  I bought small and medium. Small won’t fit. I usually buy size small. Medium just barely fit. It hurt my front. If you buy this and your bra size is 34b medium just barely fit on me. Large is better.
4.0,"I love it!!! At first I was concerned about the back being too stretchy. But it's perfect and very comfortable and supportive without making fat bulges. - My only issue is that it didn't show the 'push-up' padding in the picture. I was going to return one of them because of it, but it's so hard to find bras that fit as well as this that I just gave in and kept them. - Very comfortable. Love the wide straps. And the smooth cups look nice under anything."
4.0,"They were super cute. Unfortunately, i wore one for one day.. and the ball fell out ☹️."
4.0,"Got this for Christmas for a Hufflepuff friend. She loved it, but I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because DAYUM Universal;, you need to not up-charge your stuff so much :("
4.0,"Love the pants! They do run a little on the large side, but they are nice and warm and they are long enough for me at 5’ 7”. Being on the border line of medium and tall, I often have trouble with the length of pants, but these are awesome!<br /><br />It would be great if they offered them in two different weights. These are really thick fleece, perfect for extra cold days. Wish they also had a lighter weight for when it’s not so cold."
4.0,Great scarf to wear on ST. Patty's day!
4.0,"Super cute but runs small and a bit clingy, definitely size up one size."
4.0,"Can be dressed up or down with jeans. Soft material, but it does look a bit cheap in my opinion. I got the champagne color. It is see through. Overall worth it!"
4.0,"The dress was a perfect length, but the top was too low for  my comfort."
4.0,I love the shirt but unfortunately the size is smaller than expected<br />Despite the mishap I was able to pass it on to an appreciative family member
4.0,"I really enjoy these socks, very comfortable and very useful for daily activities. My one complaint it after you wash them the edges do start to curl a bit but after wearing them they return to normal."
4.0,"Super cute, but NOT practical to use in a pandemic. It’s a costume only. You can’t really talk well in it.... but you look chic!"
4.0,These are really cute and don't look cheap.
4.0,I like the product. they should size it better The medium size is just a little to small.
4.0,very big<br />get two sizes smaller
4.0,Love my earring have to buy more stuff to put in them
4.0,"It was waaaay to big for my normal, adult-sized face at first, but after washing and drying on low heat it fits pretty great. It breaths well, so it is comfortable to wear.<br />For those concerned about really keeping your germs totally to yourself, be aware that it does redirect air to the sides, which is probably why it is so comfortable.<br /><br />With other masks I have tried, they suck to my face and make me feel like I'm being waterboarded. This one doesn't do that.<br /><br />My one complaint is about a design flaw. I wear glasses, so if I don't want my glasses fogging up, I NEED a mask with a wire nose piece. This mask does not have that.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's still my favorite mask, because it looks decent and I can breath.<br /><br />I have not worn this mask with a filter, btw."
4.0,"These glasses are a great value for those of us who scratch, break, or lose our shades often..... can't beat this price!"
4.0,Great! More of a warm hot pink in person rather than a mauve.
4.0,"I just change the locks for a better look, otherwise it's good enough to match my outfit color."
4.0,"Dress is very beautiful, but the straps could be better. Looks only like tiny ropes for going over the shoulders and not adjustable."
4.0,"Nice Size & Convenient.  I use it with the wrist lanyard. It provides convenient organization and access to my phone, credit cards, and a couple small items (such as, lip gloss, cash, coins, small pill holder ). I'm thinking that I'll end up preferring it to my old phone clutch (Galaxy Note 4  phone clutch [with wrist lanyard] that holds 3 credit cards & folded cash bills."
4.0,These are good for the price but thin and a bit big.
4.0,This was perfect for my daughter's Halloween costume.  Very nice quality
4.0,My junk dont stay in the pocket to well.. its only attached to the front and bottom is free hanging.
4.0,The shirt did not look like it did in the online photo. I decided to keep it anyways even though i purchased it to wear with a jean skirt. I just threw it on over a full leotard. I ordered an xl and if fits perefectly. My bff loved it so much she asked for the link immediately lol.. I am 5'4 38-36-46
4.0,Like the stretch and feel of material
4.0,"This dress fits as shown in pic, it’s super cute, and comfy. It is a very thin material, and straps are very thin too! But overall a cute, cheap, comfy dress"
4.0,Wonderful --- fits great.<br />What else is there to say about a belt?<br />It is black --- goes with everything..
4.0,This cardigan is gorgeous! The fabric is thick and so soft! Colors are rich.  Runs a bit long.
4.0,"Love the soft feel of these house slippers, and they fit as expected."
4.0,These sunglasses are perfect for any baseball or softball or even kickball. Perfect for fishing. The screws are very small though.
4.0,Overall pretty nice glasses. They are extremely convenient as 'cheaters' to slip in your pocket of briefcase because then are compact. They fold down into a pretty small volume. The clarity is as good as any you would find in a drugstore.
4.0,"Same thick,  stretchy fabric as all their dresses. Cute pattern. I'm a size 10/12 depending on the cut.  Bought a XL per the reviews and am glad I did. It's a bit loose but after washing, it could shrink and would fit perfectly.  The bow is removable, but my only complaint is the poofy shoulders.  I want expecting them to puff up like they do.  Will probably get them tailored down."
4.0,It was a different feeling fabric than I expected.
4.0,They look super nice.  I like them!
4.0,"I LOVE this top and I will be getting so much use out of it once it's summer! This would look great with shorts or jeans, and would be great for layering. It's very lightweight and flowy, which will be great in the 100+ degree heat we get here in SoCal. The material is also super soft. The straps are a little thin and long for my liking though, and it is very thin in general so a lighter color would definitely need a tank top under it. This is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. The material is also very clingy so if that may be an issue get two sizes bigger but otherwise one size up should be okay. I went up two sizes and I would've been fine with a size smaller but it fits perfect. I ordered this in the color fuschia and it's not as dark pink as the photo, which I actually prefer. It's also very stretchy and most importantly, fits well in the chest. I'm a 34F and have no complaints whatsoever in terms of how it fits in the bust, it's not too tight, it covers well, and is very comfy. I'd recommend taking care when washing it though because the material is very thin."
4.0,Love it! I get many of compliments!
4.0,I think they run a bit big but they are very durable.
4.0,"Great colors,  Just too small for me."
4.0,"These are super easy to paint and decorate, but have a hard time staying on your head. They’re so too heavy they tend to slide forward or back- definitely need to be secured. But good quality!"
4.0,The feel of them
4.0,VERY CUTE LIGHTWEIGT JACKET
4.0,Bought this item as a gift for my son. First order was sent with wrong size. Corrected order was received and fit and quality were great.
4.0,Obviously that is also my review. These dresses are cute and the price is right. I gave it 4 stars for those reasons. I left off 1 star because it just makes me look fat and dumpy.  I will wear it around the house. I bought 2 different prints. They are pretty and very comfortable but not attractive on me.
4.0,"I bought this as a maternity coverup to wear with tank tops and t-shirts because I am a little self conscious of my arms currently, have yet to wear it out but it fits nicely!"
4.0,Great kit for the money. The user must read the directions and follow the directions showing patience. Don't rush the job or you might have a big mess on your hands. The end product will be just as good if not better than you would get from the average gun smith.
4.0,"Needed them for a costume party, roaring 20s themed."
4.0,Great quality robe.  The color was not as dark as depicted.  I bought the purple and it's a bit paler - more of a pale lavender shade.  The little one I purchased this for it a bit thin and tall but it fit well.  Definitely great quality and will purchase again.
4.0,"Super cute. A little tight in the arms and the buttons in front are stressed, but I think I can use safety pins or just sew the front closed and use the side zipper. I'm 5'10 and it's just above knee length. Light, crisp material.<br />I bought this dress in Navy and I really liked it, so when I saw that I could get a discount for it, I bought another one in yellow. I did get a discount for this review, but I left the first review after getting the navy one, and I just got the yellow because it is super cute and why not have a brighter color too?<br />the material has stretch to it, so it is forgiving."
4.0,Item fine...but package soaked from rain...could have been put in screen door...
4.0,"If you're familiar with Patagonia's classic fleece vests, the best way to think of the Piton Hybrid Vest is what happens when a Synchilla Vest goes on a diet and gets serious about staying active.<br /><br />The two Polartec fleeces used in the Piton, Wind Pro and Power Dry, are thinner, lighter, stretchier, and a lot more compressible than Synchilla. Both fabrics have a smooth outer finish to make donning a shell over the vest easier. The overall design of the Piton is geared to people who want a very close fitting garment with a long hem (the extra length helps the vest stay put under a harness or backpack waist belt) for climbing or backpacking.<br /><br />In actual use, the Wind Pro does block more wind than regular fleece, including technical fleeces such as Patagonia's R1 or the material used in Marmot's Alpinist Tech Jacket, but definitely isn't windproof. The Power Dry sections wick and breathe effectively while providing some heat retention. As you would expect, though, the Piton doesn't insulate as much as the similarly light and thin Nano Puff Vest.<br /><br />So think carefully about what you want out of your vest before picking up a Piton Hybrid. The Piton is not soft and cozy like Synchilla. It won't store as much heat as a down or Nano Puff vest. It has a slim and clingy fit. But the Piton is extremely lightweight, has lots of stretch, works well with packs and harnesses, and layers easily.<br /><br />Four stars, keeping in mind the Piton's intended users and uses."
4.0,These shark slides are so cute! Sizing is right on and they look just as pictured! My kiddo says they're very comfortable too. The thing I don't like is that the top fins are removable and the foam broke off within a week. So now we have sharks with no fins on top but still cute
4.0,"Perfect fit, my son loved it."
4.0,I got great reviews from my German friends.  Great for a Bavarian polterabend.  Embroidery is a beautiful touch to this outfit  Runs small.  Had to size up.  Very comfortable.
4.0,"These are great earrings. They look just like the picture. A Little heavy, but very unique and appear well crafted."
4.0,Love this purse and so does everyone else...I just hope with time it becomes more relaxed so it doesn't feel like I have to shove everything in it.
4.0,Nice sweatshirt but runs small.  I suggest order at least a size up
4.0,"I was so surprised when I took this out of the packaging and it fit perfectly! It literally made me so happy I almost cried. I got this as a birthday present for myself and thought I'd have to lose some weight to get into it, but it fits perfect! It even hides my stomach a little! :D I'm 5'10, 240lbs, and DDD cup, so it was really surprising that this fit so well. I did take the belt out of the front loops because they're on the middle of my boobs. It sits just under the ""shelf"" now and sits in just the rights spot so I don't have to undo the belt when I sit down on the bus. The only reason I didn't give this coat 5 stars is because it doesn't have any pockets. That's the only drawback, but I plan on adding some when I find the right fabric. It's thin, but fairly warm. It's enough to keep me comfy while waiting for the bus when it's 35 out, a scarf/gloves/hat make it work if it's windy or around 30 without sun. I love it!"
4.0,These pants are comfortable and great for the not weather we’ve been having.
4.0,Great shoes just a little snug. Wish I would have went up a 1/2 size.
4.0,I loved the dress I didn’t like the flap though because it kept showing my arms underneath everytime I lifted my arms
4.0,"good for the price, but very fragile"
4.0,Love this item but it looks dingy against a black background.  A little disappointing
4.0,"these are very cute, however they are very tiny.  I was not expecting them to be so small.  they were a gift, and for that reason I was disappointed in the size.  But the price, delivery, etc was excellent and I will purchase from this seller again.  Next time. however, I will ask questions regarding size, etc."
4.0,"Well made and comfortable, except very small for advertised size."
4.0,"These are a nice glossy type black, durable, and comfortable. They're just a little hard to get in, but they look great once you get them there!"
4.0,Didn’t like how the arms fit return it
4.0,Warm legging with reasonable price.
4.0,Replaced my original 8801 strap that broke while mowing.  Seems comfortable.  I will update down the road regarding durability and if it maintains comfort.
4.0,Fits true to size. Good quality. I'm happy with the purchase.
4.0,Not as large as I thought it would be which is a good thing.  Love the front pocket (great to toss keys in).  Straps are adjustable but not by much.  Overall a good bag for the price.
4.0,"I really like it! Fits nicely and looks super sexy. You can tell the fabric is pretty cheap, but for the price, it isn't bad."
4.0,"Love Stance socks, great quality for a great price with style!"
4.0,"These didn't sit as closely on my ears as I had thought, but they are fun and the little bit of bling is a nice offset to the skull design."
4.0,"I love these!  Not very supportive and I wouldn't wear it running, but for sleeping, lounging, or a casual day, they are perfect!  The material is super soft and it's so comfy!"
4.0,I bought this for my GD for Christmas<br /> Looks very sharp
4.0,I normally wear a small/ medium. I ordered a large and it fits like my other tank tops. The only difference is this the tank top is about an inch longer. It is definitely thin so it's more of an undershirt.
4.0,Nice shirts at great price. But the sizes differed from each other.  They all said 10/12 but some fit correctly and some were more like size 8.
4.0,Cute ! Love the colors!
4.0,Overall these look like the photo but they're a dull teal instead of it vibrant green I wanted. I do like that my laptop fits well and the purse is an okay size though not my taste. I only got this set since it was on sale cheaper than buying a laptop case only from this brand. Though I'm curious if the separate laptop case actually comes in green?
4.0,Surprisingly comfortable for my bf’s flat feet. He really bragged about the comfort. Good buy!
4.0,"Get a lot of compliments, however it does stretch out over months, but at current price not expensive to replace"
4.0,The fit is nice but the neck was too big for my taste.
4.0,"Overall husband liked this.  Didn’t expect the device to be as big as it is, thought it would be thinner.  Like having a plastic block sewn into hat.  Can’t judge battery as haven’t used enough yet. Worth the money"
4.0,"These tights run small I checked the size chart and still preferred a bigger size. My thighs are pretty big so the seam of the thighs was cutting off my circulation, so of course I had imprint lines once taking the shorts off. Advice: Size up"
4.0,"Tal cual como se aprecia en la foto, muy buen precio y calidad."
4.0,These are cute boots and I would definitely make this purchase again.
4.0,I like baggy shirts. I’m a 4/6 and ordered the medium to be safe. I probably should have gotten the small because I always end up knotting it. But I love the loose open back. And the material is nice. It’s more cotton than synthetic.
4.0,"I was satisfied with these, with a caveat. You definitely need to order one size larger as they shrink in the first wash. But since this is an economical cotton set, I pretty much knew they would do that, so ordered a size larger and am happy with the fit and comfort for sleeping.<br />They’re woven, not knit, cotton, so they don’t give much, but then neither do they sag as cheap cotton knits do. They’re loose and non-constricting. They’re comfortable enough I wear them around the house in the morning sometimes. For the cost, I think they’re a good deal. I’ve had them over a year, wear them often and they haven’t fallen apart or unraveled, so the quality is better than I was expecting it to be. I would buy them again, though it would be nice if it came in more colors."
4.0,"All the rings look amazing bought for my 15 year old and they run a little small so the do not fit like in the picture, she is able to wear maybe 2 on one finger"
4.0,Great item. Very easy to install and seem durable.
4.0,Not lined inside with fleece but it does<br />keep you warm. Collar is a bit bulky. I took a large and I’m 5’4” and usually<br />wear a size 12. Fits fine.
4.0,Thinner than I expected based on Hanes socks like these I had previously. Still a good product.
4.0,"I really like these, but one of the rhinestones was already off, I’m glad I ordered the 2 pair pack."
4.0,"This necklace makes more than just a fashion statement, the symbolic message it sends is one of feminine strength, power and endurance. Well designed and well made."
4.0,Great! Especially for the price. I does hang awkwardly but I used my jewelry pliers to rearrange it into a shape I lime and that hangs well on my body. I wanted to post a photo but it will not let me from my phone.
4.0,These are comfortable boots I use as business casual wear.
4.0,It runs 2 sizes smaller
4.0,Fit was small nice dress
4.0,"Love these, I have trouble finding glasses that look good on my because I have a round face but these looked so good"
4.0,nicely polished and has held up well.
4.0,"They run large and only come in whole sizes but if you can get a pair that fit they're great. Breath well, protect your toes, are comfortable, super light, look great, and are affordable for good safely shoes. Asterisk on the comfortable part: that's after a week of break in. The first few days they hurt like hell."
4.0,Just a tad big for me but very durable an high quality feeling. I love them an happy with my purchase! Well worth the few bucks.
4.0,About 5 didn't work out of the package.
4.0,"I really like the design of this watch and bought it as a gift for my groomsmen. I ended up having to buy several extra though because there there was a lot of variation in the build quality and wood color. I also question if this is real walnut wood, I would guess it is just dyed."
4.0,"Cute sweater! Little short for my torso, but tucked in it looks great!"
4.0,I love the shirt...I just wish they had an XL or XXL available. I would have purchased more.
4.0,So fun to have for camping! It's a lot but there are 2<br />Or 3 that don't work
4.0,Very high quality pants.  I wish they would have fit my husband.
4.0,I love the logo
4.0,The shorts are pretty nice! The only problem is the size. I am 5'2&#34; 150 pounds. I read the reviews and ended up ordering two sizes up (I like my shorts a little loose).<br /><br />The only other complaint I had was the flower material on the inside. It was very rough and scratchy. Im not sure why they use it. It isnt necessary.
4.0,I thought the color was a little off versus what we seen online. But the dress came on time and fit her nicely
4.0,"This top is actually fairly decent considering it's from Amazon, I have been let down so many times but this top is pretty cute. If you order and wish to wear it as the pic by tying it order 2-3 sizes up. I'm normally an XS is tanks but to be safe I went with a medium and it fits fine although I will note I am about to order another in a different color but will order a large so it gives the same relaxed look. If you're on the bigger side this won't be for you considering the medium fits me a little tight but this is perfect otherwise. Again don't order one size up, order 2-3 sizes up. For comparison I am 5&quot;1&quot;, 120lbs and bust ranges between 34DD and 32DDD (implants). If you are short like me this top is gorgeous, especially for the price. I won't return the one I have simply because it's doable and I'm a loyal customer but my next purchase will be a large."
4.0,These leggings are very cute but not exactly but lifting .  I also noticed the leggings leave imprints from the pattern all over your legs after wearing them for a while.
4.0,"Super cute and fit great, but the crown was flexible and made of faux leather and not a plastic. Meaning it doesn’t retain its shape as easily. It has Bobby pins to secure it, which is great, so it worked out well anyhow."
4.0,"This is a great, well-sewn, and attractive shirt.  I was surprised, considering that it is all cotton, that it comes out of the washer and dryer as nicely as it does.  It looks better with a bit of ironing but it is not very wrinkled when I take it out of the dryer after using the Permanent Press setting.<br /><br />This is a tailored shirt, and don't take that lightly.  I got it for my hubby who usually wears an XXL size, but this XXXL size was too small for him.  You have to have no belly for this to fit as expected, and to look good.<br /><br />Given that, unless (or until) my husband shrinks, I really like this as an oversized nightshirt for me."
4.0,Very pretty lightweight and sparkly 👍🏽
4.0,VERY CUTE but super long.
4.0,So cute! The case is too small glasses do not fit in it.
4.0,I like it because it fit my daughter perfect but the only thing is that is not thick enough.
4.0,My fiancé loved the variety that came with this package of socks! The package came quickly in the mail and was in perfect condition. My only feedback is that the brown socks were not as rich of a color... looked like a dark mustard to me more than brown.
4.0,Love this dress only thing is the fold on the top is kinda strange.
4.0,I often wear a 9 1/2 which I ordered and was too big....I returned for a 9 but still a bit big so one foot the heal would move and caused a blister<br /><br />which can likely be remedied with a heal insert<br /><br />otherwise the shoe is nicely cushioned and like the rubber bottom.......was just surprised the 9 was not a better fit
4.0,I loved the style of the top and it fits just didn’t realize how short it was. Got my normal size but very short.
4.0,"I really wanted to love these darling pants.  Like many reviews, I found these an awkward length.  The length is clearly noted on the description, so it wasn't a surprise.  The side hem has a drawstring to raise or lower, which is a very nice touch.  If they were longer, I would have absolutely kept them!  The reason I am returning them is the color.  It is actually beautiful!  However, being shorter, it is more of a summer pant, but the color is darker, more of a winter color.  If it were a brighter and happier color as the photos depict, I would have made them work."
4.0,Cute. Stretchy. Tight but also slowly.
4.0,"Warm, comfy, cute. Will buy again but not too durable if u know how to sew u wont have too many problems"
4.0,great ring  the ring itself is on big side
4.0,Fits well. Little thin though.
4.0,Looks a little cheap. But not too bad for the price.
4.0,they do what they say...just hurt after a while
4.0,"this is a very nice dress, it did run a little small. the material was very nice and worth the value."
4.0,"These are so cute! I wear a size 9.5 and I'm 5'8&#34; and they fit perfectly! I actually already ordered more because they offer the best fit I have found so far in compression socks. The only downside is they are pretty thick and warm which is going to be nice this winter, but right now during summer my feet sweat in them :/"
4.0,These earrings were very nice for the price.
4.0,"I liked the stone. It was beautiful, but not the best quality. I had hoped for better."
4.0,"Pros: The watch is flashy, bit heavy and superb. Fits me just right and looks gadgety and macho.<br /><br />Cons: Only because I dont know what the other dials and circles are showing."
4.0,Super cute purse. Gave it 4 stars for the clasp unhooking a couple times. Very sturdy. Not thin plastic at all. Shoulder chain is a little short but it’s nothing you’ll notorious much.
4.0,"So I love this because it’s easy to wash, dries fast, I can actually breathe, but it is a bit heavy. once you wear it (at least for me) for at least 10-15 min, it’ll leave a little dent like Mark on your nose. The redness goes away and over time it does feel a little heavy but still worth being able to breathe. I noticed because this is essentially plastic- I don’t break out like I normally would with my fabric mesh."
4.0,"These leggings are extremely comfortable and flattering and you can not beat that price. I really like the high wasted aspect of these leggings, helps you feel more secure in the gym. The only complaint I would have is that they are the type of material that collects easily; I have a white long haired dog, so i have to spend a couple minutes lint rolling myself before heading into the gym. Small price to pay!"
4.0,"I researched this dress for about a month and wanted to get it for my birthday. I read all the reviews and decided to get a 4x. I typically wear a 16, but I know my breast and thighs are BIG.<br />Upon getting the item, I will say it was too big. The waist could be taken in, and it does not fall off the shoulder. The arms fit pretty well, but It was rather long and looked square. I hope to return the item and get a smaller size, maybe a 3x. Hope this was helpful."
4.0,I bought these for my daughter for work as a server.  Very comfortable and more dressier looking than leggings.  Great for bending.
4.0,"Comfy, pretty colors and true to size!"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:e0c9dc118a0de3ad5f03f9890085a580]]I received this case from the manufacturer for evaluation during the product's launch, and here are my thoughts.<br /><br />This sturdy leather key holder looks and feels very well constructed. Made of thick vintage looking crazy horse leather, the case is immaculately stitched, has a smoothly functioning zipper, and is about the right size for a man to comfortably carry in a pocket without being overly bulky. There's a sturdy brass hook on the top of the case to hook to a belt, but I used it for my car key instead since I would have to leave the case unzipped when the key was in the ignition if I stored it inside the case.<br /><br />The inside of the case has two slots to hold gas or other cards, a car key holder in case you prefer to keep your key inside the case, and 6 hooks to hold other keys. Credit cards fit into the slots well, all hooks are brass and feel very secure, and the keys are easy to put on or take off as needed. Overall, it's a nice looking case that appears to be well constructed, but I'd suggest keeping your house key on the inside ring rather than your car key."
4.0,Love these! Look great with jeans or tights. Comfy enough for office all day!
4.0,"We paid six dollars for twelve glasses so for the price they are ok.  We used these as party favors at a kids birthday party, and the kids liked them.  They are made out of a thin cardboard and there is a very small hole on each side that you can kind of see through.  It is nice that you get a mix of these so they are not all the same."
4.0,"These masks I was pretty excited about getting after another one I tried seemed to have a single layer and offered no filters which would be able to be purchased anywhere but Korea. That being said, this mask would be great for smaller faces and children as they are not easy to fit on bigger faces like my husbands and my own. I do appreciate not having to layer up as I always have to do with others, but the only tip I can offer you as a buyer is if you are petite or have a smaller face, these would be amazing. They wash well, they just need to have another size option to reach their full potential, a bit added to the width and length. For context I am not overweight, I just have a big head and these are not going to be the best for bigger faces and most definitely would not work for a bearded mug. Fantastic for everyone else, however."
4.0,"Cute, looks cute with tights and shirt boots or sneakers. Very cozy fuzzy hoodie"
4.0,"I have worked with leather for quite some time.  I have also got a friend who has worked in leather most of her life.  When I got this belt, at first I was not sure what to think.  It smells like plastic, yet it says leather..  Let's take a closer look..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This belt is black and has design pressed into the front.  It is smooth on the back.  The buckle is a hematite looking silver buckle with red and silver trim just at the loop.  The edges and front look like they are covered in plastic/rubberized stuff and the back looks like a very thin layer but you can see leather grain in there if you look carefully.<br /><br />PACKAGING<br />This comes in a satin drawstring pouch which is nice for gift giving.<br /><br />IS THIS LEATHER?<br />This says full grain leather, but the overwhelming plastic sort of smell makes everyone wonder if it is PURE leather.  My friend who works in leather thinks it is what some call bonded leather where they blend up leather pulp with a binder and call it 100% leather.  When I look really close, I see in the holes for the buckle that it does seem to have some leather fibers in there, so it just could have a heavy coating on it.<br /><br />WHAT SIZE?<br />This is a size 40.<br /><br />UNISEX?<br />This can be worn by men or women easily.<br /><br />STURDY?<br />After wearing for a day, I can see where the hole is pulled but not separating as some belts (claiming to be leather but weren't ) have done after only a day.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although we all disagree what kind of leather this really is, it seems like a sturdy belt and well made so it will be nice to wear.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  The smell is overwhelming but hopefully will fade over time.  I will update if there are any problems with this belt or anything else that needs to be reported about it."
4.0,"Vinyl wallet windows seem extremely hard to find in the local stores. The dollar stores used to have very cheap dreck and since they wear out every few years, it is good to find the relatively study Buxtons online."
4.0,Good quality but the sides are more like a bronze then gold.
4.0,Really nice pants but run small.  I re-ordered one size larger.
4.0,Quality shoe lift at a good price. I used them for a Halloween costume. They did the job.
4.0,"These are great pairs of goggles and totally worth the price. They come with clear storage cases to keep them from getting scratched. They also have a clasp on the back of the strap for easy removal. They fit very snug and seem to be well made. If they were anti-fog, I would give them a perfect score."
4.0,This dress was absolutely gorgeous. I wore it to my prom and it was definitely a head turner. The only problem I had was by the end of the night it had random holes around wear the zipper was.
4.0,Since I have just tried it on but have not worn it out I  like  it very much but I shall see when it becomes late in the fall and in to the<br />winter which is here in New England yet.
4.0,"Beautiful colors, fabric is soft and comfortable to wear. This runs about 1/2 size big."
4.0,Function well.
4.0,"This is a really nice choker.  I expected just sort of a wire, but it's really a piece of jewelry in itself. It truly is a choker so measure 17"" to make sure it's big enough for you if you are a bigger person.  It fit me just fine.  It is bigger in diameter than a wire choker so your jewelry piece that goes on it will have to have a larger opening for the necklace to go through."
4.0,I love the look of these earrings... Was looking for something fun and a but classy for work... Nothing too fancy and these are perfect. They brighten my face and the square is unique. Wouldn't suggest sleeping in them - they are too big and hurt. Do wish the hole was in the middle rather than too too.
4.0,"Pretty cute ""dress"" but not really flattering. Little see-through in direct light. BUT as a nightgown with pockets (what I bought it for), its absolutely great."
4.0,"Doesn't help much with glare as noted, but I look good wearing them."
4.0,The push-ups is really big
4.0,Just cool. Fits good
4.0,"I have a large head.  Measures about 23&#34; around at the forehead.  This hat fits snugly but not in a constrictive manner.  I cut a hole in the rear for a ponytail and it's working really well this way.  The brim covers my face and neck from the sun very well, and I can roll it up (think 90s TV show &#34;Blossom&#34; or any 90s style) or make it pointy as necessary.  It's a bit warm when the sun is beating down, but not like a lot of hats I've tried.  Maybe the UPF fabric keeps it cooler.  The only complaint I have is the fabric attracts pet hair.  I purchased the black one.  Overall a really good purchase!"
4.0,Nice glasses  a little on the big size for my face
4.0,Easy to use and very versatile.  I use it for many things including coloring my hair
4.0,"They were for my son and he absolutely loves them,  but now he wants ones with The Flash on them.  Smh."
4.0,VERY cute top. A little too thin of fabric but cute nonetheless.
4.0,"Nice, but keep in mind - you get what you pay for.  These don't feel like $100 watches, but they look pretty nice"
4.0,I like them but my son doesn't. He doesn't think he needs new shoes. They run a little too big. So you might need a half size smaller.
4.0,Love the style but the ear loop band is not sturdy enough. Didn't last very long.
4.0,They fit and feel really nice.
4.0,"All four of our girls like handbags so i ordered this GLADON MODA Women's Crossbody Bag as a Christmas gift. It is a see-thru bag that contains a second bag that can be used as a separate clutch or as shown below. The bag comes with the see-thru crossbody bag, the separate clutch, and a backpack type see-thru bag with the Moda Decal on the front [see the picture on the left]. It is a nice crossbody handbag that seems to be fairly sturdy. It should appeal to at least one of the girls."
4.0,"After reading reviews of others I did go one size larger but if it had been possible, I would have gone 2 sizes bigger since I like my robes to be a little extra roomy so that it is not snug no matter what I may wear beneath it, and this is snug with out any thing but undies being worn. I would say this is not something for an X-large or bigger=sized gal. I chose this sweatshirt-robe because it is 100% cotton; wished they had more colors to choose from like a similar brand which I had also purchased. The zipper is METAL and works smoothly but it is COLD against the bare skin!!!. The hood's ties are just strips of the sweatshirt material instead of a braided or twisted cord, and they are STRETCHY which made it more difficult to pull tight and tie. With both pros and cons, this is a decent piece of clothing. Yes, it is made in China."
4.0,"I like these, but they were not packaged well for shipping. The lid was broken on one of the jars."
4.0,"My daughter just received the coat, so we need a bit of time to see how it holds up. I was expecting it to be a bit heavier in weight, since it is described as a winter coat. So far, we love it!"
4.0,"This watch is lighter and more comfortable to wear than it looks.<br />At first, it looked like a cheap product, but after wearing it, I changed to thinking that it felt pretty good. I think it is a product that goes well with many clothes. Willing to buy again next time. I thought it was a good purchase."
4.0,"My son wears a 14 in most things.  So we ordered the xx-large (13/14) first and they are huge...really, really big.  That's ok, it gave me something to go on...or so I thought.  I then ordered the x-large (11/12)...but after looking at how big they are...I ordered the medium & large too...one of them has to fit...right?  Well, no.  I will say that the x-large, large & medium probably run true to size and needless to say, they were all way too small...all of them are being returned, except the xx-large.  Although the xx-large is too big for now...they are super cute.  He'll just have to grow into them...they fit like an adult medium.  Yes, I know this because my husband tried them on and this is what size he wears and they were only a tad snug.<br /><br />So, if you are purchasing in one of the smaller sizes it'll be ok."
4.0,Could be a little bigger but fits nicely. Love the colors!
4.0,"Robe fit as expected & works well for costume, but came in a day later than the guaranteed delivery date so it was too late for my son to wear it to school for costume day."
4.0,"Pretty, light and functional"
4.0,This is a little frail.  Isn't as pretty as I thought it would be but it is still nice.
4.0,I’m excited for the watch. Can’t wait to wear it. BUT! I can not figure out how to get the battery in!
4.0,"Good hat, warm and waterproof... but extremely small. Unless you are a very petite adult or child, always order the larger size"
4.0,really  bright in color and has a good weight to them
4.0,Nice pair of earrings they dnt fade or itch I have been wearing all day & sleep with them on!
4.0,I bought he dress in blue. It fits perfectly and looks great!
4.0,love this hat.  I’m a nurse and used it at work.<br />Washed well and got lots of compliments. Fun to wear at work
4.0,"I originally bought this charm bracelet for my step daughter who LOVES ANIME. She's big on My Hero Academia and Demon Slayer right now so this was very on-brand for her.<br /><br />She a 10 years old but a little heavy set and it fit like a charm! The sizing is adjustable which was perfect for us.<br /><br />She wore it for a few months before it broke but she loved it so much I had to buy it again for her, she's had the 2nd one now for about a year and wears it fairly often"
4.0,"Bear in mind that this sweater comes in Asian size. Order at least 2 sizes up. My daughter loves it though. We got a medium, and had to exchange for an XL. The return process was wonderful.<br /><br />The sweater is super lightweight and a little see-through. But the pattern and colors are beautiful. We got the light gray with pink flowers and black accent."
4.0,The mask is beautiful. they are delicate but still sturdy. I wore mine for a masquerade party. It's breathable but i did get a little warm behind the mask.
4.0,"A well-crafted hookah is an expensive purchase. This hookah is surprisingly inexpensive, so to be perfectly honest when I purchased it I was expecting it to have at least some minor defects, but it was all I could afford.  As it turns out, I was right; there were a couple of very small defects.  But overall, I was incredibly impressed with the quality and function for such a small price. I would definitely recommend this product.  Here, let me break down my experience for you.<br /><br />I suppose I'll start with the cons:<br /><br />* First, the picture shown was taken in an orange/brown light. It's not really bronze-colored. It's a dark silver, almost a metallic black, really.  Like this: [...]. I think it's beautiful, but the pic was a little off.<br />* Next, one of the hoses leaked significantly at both ends (the other was perfectly fine). I wrapped it in black electrical tape where the hose connects to the wooden mouthpiece and now it works fine (and still looks nice, as it's a black hose).<br />* There is also a small leak where the hoses attach. It doesn't inhibit my smoking whatsoever, but sometimes it annoys me when I notice it.<br />* This is VERY common among lower-grade hookahs, but I didn't know this when purchasing so it's worth noting. The hoses are made of a rubbery/nylon material wrapped around a long metal coil, and as such they are not washable. They would rust and then your shisha would taste nasty if you washed them.  The result of this is that they have a certain shelf life before they build up enough smoke particles to affect the taste of your shisha and you have to replace them. It's hardly a con really, because it's standard for reasonably priced hookahs. Just...just know that going in.<br />* Finally, the bowl it comes with is pretty small. If you're hoping to smoke this in a group, you may want a bigger bowl. I bought a vortex bowl for $10 with free shipping and it's treated me beautifully.<br /><br />The pros:<br /><br />* First, it really is beautiful in form and color. I keep it on my dresser and it really adds to the room.<br />* It works great! I can take big deep drags on the hose no problem, even though it's somewhat small. It really does work very well. I've used it several times alone and with friends and it's given me spectacular results.<br />* The base is flat and wide enough to sit on surfaces without risk of falling.  I use it outside on the grass and don't have to worry about it tipping over easily.<br />* The vase is mostly colored a very dark blue (pretty much black), but has a transparent stripe around the neck so you can see the smoke moving as you inhale, and can tell when you've run out of shisha.<br />* It's stinkin' cheap!<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />This is a darn-near unbeatable hookah for the price.  Since it's so crazy cheap, you should probably expect it to have some minor defects upon arrival (minor leaks, etc.). But the bottom line is it works very well overall and it's gorgeous despite being cheaply made.  Definitely worth every penny of my $30. I would recommend it to anyone looking to buy their first hookah on a small budget who is still looking for a very positive experience."
4.0,"Love the colour and style of this belt, but - My waist fits into the higher end of the sizing spectrum stated (about an inch and a half below the maximum measurement) for this product yet it fits a bit too tight and is somewhat constricting. I removed a star based on the thought that if a sizing range is given, it should fit comfortably as long as your waist falls within the measurement. Wish they made larger sizes. If they did, I would re-order one size up, same colour."
4.0,Somewhat difficult to get the zipper up
4.0,"Nice dress, fit is flare, you get what you pay for."
4.0,"A decent belt -does what it's supposed to do: hold up your pants. No need to spend $30+ on a daily staple, I may try to get this same belt in another color."
4.0,Item is very pretty and got here quickly.
4.0,was big for who i bought it for (ordered a xs or s and got an m)
4.0,Bracelets are pretty but the cord slides too easily and you have to tighten then multiple times each day
4.0,It was a little large per the chart. Go smaller no matter what. Material is a little thinner than i thought. But still ik
4.0,"Was given to a friend and she loved them, she took off her old ones and put these in as soon as I gave them to her"
4.0,"I like it; it's funky like I thought it'd be. The quality is a little less than I expected, but it's completely worth the price for a cute piece of jewelry for a conversation piece. A strong four-stars!"
4.0,"Looks just about like the Omega Sea/Speed Master bands; metal looks a bit cheaper quality though, since it is.  Fits very well on wrist, would recommend for anyone looking for a cheap alternative to buying a real one for about 30X's more."
4.0,"These sterling silver gold plated earrings are smaller than a penny but they are so gorgeous and as far as they are hypoallergenic, could be used for little ones too. I love the silver color and those shiny diamonds on it.<br />They could be used as a gift if they came with a box not the small bag!"
4.0,Fits pretty well but could use some tape to stay up since it keeps rolling down
4.0,Nice. Went up a size and fits well. Very comfy
4.0,"These are the best no tie laces out there. I buy an xl for kids size 3 shoes. The only downside is the red metal tab did leave red marks on a white pair of shoes, but it was easily cleaned"
4.0,I bought these for my wife and they look great. Love the color.
4.0,"These are so cute! I bought a size up to pull them up over pants and thigh high for the fall, winter, and early spring for extra leg coverage while baby wearing. My only wish is for grippers on the sole. I wasn't thinking ahead when I bought these but when they actually start to fit my daughter will be a toddler and she'll slip all over our hardwood floors in these. They'll be great with shoes though!"
4.0,"I bought these as a gift for my young daughter. She loves them. They are pretty and fun. A great gift for a girl who loves gymnastics.<br /><br />The reason that I knocked off one star is that one of the pieces had a jewel that had fallen out. It could have happened during shipping, but I'd guess it fell out long before it was shipped to me. Luckily the gem was still in the plastic bag with the necklace and I was able to put it in place with a little super glue gel."
4.0,"Pretty good, didn’t like that they called it Rey’s but it’s Disney. And sadly most people like Rey these days."
4.0,"Super cute and fit my daughter perfectly! She is 2.5 years old but wears mostly 3T and 4T. She’s very tall, so it was nice that this fit so well."
4.0,"My husband thinks they are a little struggle to put on, but likes them better than his previous pair."
4.0,"I ordered three of these shirts. Im a 14/16. A white one with the double pockets and two dark green single pocket shirts. The white is a xxl and the fabric was soft and flowy. Fits really well. The green was puzzling. An XL was sent to me by mistake but had the “fashion” tag. It too was soft and flowy, just too small. The company quickly sent me the correct size of xxl. The second green shirt had a different tag of “1st Nature”. The color was much darker and the fabric was stiff and scratchy. The xxl fit was smaller than the xxl white one. So it was returned."
4.0,It was somewhat small but I like my jammies loose. Very comfortable though and seem well made
4.0,"I like it, although it is a tad shorter than I expected and a tad more tight as well."
4.0,"Very cute on, a little stretched out looking in the neck but pretty cute, fits somewhat large as well"
4.0,"It's a relatively decent costume that you can get in a pinch. As a guy who normally wears Large shirts and 32x32 jeans, I can say the largest size fit, though you might want to have it adjusted at some point. It's a durable-ish material, and at this price with Prime shipping, I can definitely say this saved me at a last minute convention."
4.0,Cute top. Runs really small. I typically wear medium but ordered a large and probably could have ordered XL
4.0,Magnet weakens after a while.
4.0,the fabric is go but it is too small
4.0,excellent detail and fits perfectly on my wrist .
4.0,"This looks like it is a decent sized container in the pictures, but it is very small! I was surprised for sure. I have used this product on a leather purse and it works well. Soaks in after a while, and leaves the leather looking beautiful."
4.0,The fabric is Absolutely wonderful. It feels good against your skin. And the dress looks like the pictures. It was just to big
4.0,Post is flimsy like many others
4.0,Nice everyone likes but needs to be longer
4.0,The sneakers come as expected and they were delivered a day early which is a huge thumbs up . Packaged great !! Only problem I had was the sizing u do have to order a half a size up being these specific sneakers run small . I ordered for my mom and they are right as all hell but she’s happy with the product . It isn’t worth the return being she wore them outside already . But for the future and anyone looking to purchase this product they are AMAZING sneakers very comfortable and the seller is very accommodating. Just make sure you have ur right size and always remember these shoes run small a half a size up from ur original size will fit comfortably. Other than that everything else is immaculate. It is as if I went to foot locker . Only from th comfort of my own home . Good job guys !
4.0,Very nice!! I just wish that the smallest stone was a bit smaller but other than that they are very pretty. Very please with my purchase!!
4.0,"Fits great, looks cool.... a great purchase!"
4.0,Looked super cute!! Only bad thing was i had to cut off hanging thread all over the jacket.
4.0,Love the style but ran too small and not stretchy at all
4.0,Nice shirt but small.  Exchanged for large
4.0,"Overall I love the bag, however I did return as the small bag was much smaller than I thought it would be.  This bag barely fits a iPad mini (without a case on it) let alone a wallet and a few odds and ends."
4.0,"I bought PD1676, 3 black sub-dials on white dial.<br /><br />The watch is well built and looks very beautiful. The only downside is the dial color. The white looks pale, not as good as that on PD1718.<br /><br />The bracelet only looks nice. The edges of the bracelet and clasp feel sharp and uncomfortable on the skin.<br /><br />Overall a watch worth buying, but I will replace the bracelet."
4.0,This is a nice piece I am worried it may break it is a bit thin but I’ve owned it for about a month now and I wear it to work lifting pts and moving them and it has held up so 4 stars for me.
4.0,"Absolutley thick amd warm, may like or dislike them if you have sweaty feet. I have freezing feet so love these. Used for snow play, snowboarding, cold weather only!"
4.0,I love these. They don't look cheap. I took one star away because idk how durable they are yet.
4.0,"Not the best quality, but will do the job"
4.0,I fit into a women's US large. I ordered an xl. It's a little tight in the bust area. I'd order a xxl if I was to buy it again. Nice quality though.
4.0,It’s very cute and the colors are nice. I’m 5’10 so I’ll need to wear something under or all my bum will be showing. I need to either wear a corset or lose some belly fat so I don’t look pregnant in it. Overall it’s good.
4.0,"I could tell these were good bibs as I first pulled them on.  Good compression and fit and they look sharp.  I won't be trying them on a ride longer than two hours until next spring but they've been comfortable so far.  Capo appears to follow ""American"" sizing.  I got them in Large like I would Perl Izumi shorts (6' 1"" / 177 pounds).  They're a bit longer than the Castelli Free Aero bibs I tried recently but had to return because I couldn't get a good fit.  I'd give these 5 stars if they stayed in place better but that may just be the way it is with bibs if you are taller or don't have big, tapered quads."
4.0,"Was as described, color is accurate to the picture.  Lays nice, great buy for the price!"
4.0,This seems to help some joint soreness and looks good to wear. Will buy again.
4.0,"I really love this dress.  I am 5'4"" and 215lbs and bought an XL and it just barely hits the floor. The feel of the material is fine. Not insanely soft. But it's good quality. Doesn't feel cheaply made.  We are having family pictures made today and I'm very happy with the choice I made!"
4.0,Likes the hat it's a little high but when the wind blows it stays on his head. Very comfortable
4.0,"Simple, yet classy!"
4.0,College dorm use
4.0,They fit perfectly and are so comfortable.  It's like walking on air. Very happy with my purchase it just took awhile to get them
4.0,"Nice protection. The clasp is difficult to use at times, cleans up well with soap and water."
4.0,"I bought this shirt in an XS for my slim 12-year-old daughter. She loves it and it fits great! Her middle school has strict dress codes, and this fits the criteria as well is very fashionable. She loves the lettuce edging!"
4.0,"These pants are hot, super cute and comfy!! However, I bought mine less $ at shophomefitness.com"
4.0,"perfect, my nice looked very nice in it."
4.0,I am 5'1 and 89 pounds. I ordered a size xs. I typically wear an xs in juniors and a 00 in juniors. These fit my legs from my thighs up to my waist the fit was loose. Might of fit if I had more junk in the trunk? Sad these didn't fit
4.0,"I bought this for my 11 year old son. He normally wears large (size12) but I decided to size up, thinking the 14-16 (which should have been XL) would give him room to grow. But it fit him like a large. Not to mention, the collar on dri-fit shirts were sooo small, his head barely squeezed through. Also, the set comes with 2 dri-fit shirts and 2 cotton shirts. I thought it was an entire set of dri-fits, but it's not. I've bought from this company many times before for my son and I love their clothes but I'm disappointed in this order. The quality is not what I expected."
4.0,"Hangs a little long, but very nice"
4.0,"The product looks GREAT, and was well made.<br /><br />The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because there is one con....the magnet is so strong i have not been able to bare wearing the earring for more than maybe 30min-1hr.<br /><br />Although the magnet is too tight, at least its less likely to fall off for no reason. I am trying to train myself to get used to how tight the earring is."
4.0,Got these for my daughter.  She's a big Dr. Who fan.  Only issue was they were heavy and really pulled down on her ear lobe.
4.0,"I bought this dress for my daughter to wear to my nephews's wedding. Its a beautiful dress. She's normally a size 14/16. I bought her a 14 thinking she would have to loose a few pounds. Unfortunately, its way too big. She won't get to wear the dress for atleast a few more years."
4.0,"The earrings are gorgeous. They are genuine Sterling Silver. The fire opals are fake, but they are still pretty."
4.0,Nicely made. Quite heavyduty. Is very stiff when new so needs some sharp bending to loosen it up a bit before use. The wax smell a little.
4.0,not what expected.
4.0,"I took a chance on ordering this dress-- in the summer, I try to wear only linen and cotton because it's so hot! Other dresses similar to this one said they were a poly blend. This particular dress is cotton/linen. I usually wear a 4/6 in women's dresses and I ordered a size Large according to the size chart (I wasn't sure if the dress would run small). The red dress is a bright, pretty color and fit as I expected. The pink dress was looser in the waist than the red dress; in addition it was much more sheer. I am returning the pink dress to try the navy blue color instead. I think if you are in between sizes you are better off sizing up. Thanks!"
4.0,This is a really beautiful dress but it was too long in the arms for me. That is the only reason I am giving it a 4.
4.0,The sunglasses are good but think of are big for cycling.
4.0,"Lots of activities, not the greatest quality but kept kids busy for a bit. Some better quality in but stuff was good for 3 yr and 5yr olds so they each had their own."
4.0,Cute and colorful.  Wish it was a different fabric
4.0,"I am a size 8 pant, so I purchased a medium. Not very much give in the stretch of it, so it fit a bit snugly but was not uncomfortable. Not the most figure flattering, but still very very pretty."
4.0,I love these earrings. They are made with good material and arent heavy. Ive gotten a ton of compliments. They have an edge on them so they make the gauge look a little bigger. My only complaint is that after a few months in the sun and daily wearing the picture is turning a greenish and fading.
4.0,"Cute necklace. Bought it for my daughter. It's small and delicate. I hope when the silver plating wears off, there's no nickel underneath. She's highly allergic. I thought it said sterling silver, not sterling silver plate."
4.0,"Bought this bag as a beach bag because I’m always going to beach. Good quality, lots of space except, the zip broke the very first day I went to use the bag. That was a bummer."
4.0,"While it's a bit frustrating not being able to get out of the house much these days during the pandemic, that doesn't mean we cant get dressed up and have fun.<br /><br />Tonight we decided to get a few of our new outfits together, turned on some music, made a couple cocktails and had an in home photo shoot.<br /><br />This dress was purchased for a vacation we had to put on hold, but it made for some nice photos.<br /><br />The dress fit as expected, the color looked good against my skin tone and the material was soft and comfortable.<br /><br />The dress hugs and displays every curve whether you want it to or not.<br /><br />I would recommend this to those who are comfortable with having everything accentuated for all to see.  Its s great dress for a night out on the town when we are all allowed to get back out in the town."
4.0,"Beautiful light weight fabric , great for summer .<br />Fit true to size wish it was a few inches longer . I  am 5’4 order the size small ."
4.0,"I like the way it looks,but it gets very warm"
4.0,"This is an attractive watch.  I'm usually not a fan of diamonds/crystals on watches but here it looks pretty good in my opinion (obviously these aren't diamonds).  Additionally, my wife and I both quite like the design on the watch face.<br /><br />Anyway, beyond being an attractive design, the watch finish has a nice bright polish to it which also looks quite good.  The clasp is also a nice little upgrade over traditional clasp in this this has a ""hidden"" clasp.<br /><br />The watch IS lightweight (almost no weight to the metal bracelet) and you know this isn't an expensive watch when you pick it up, but the finish is good and coming from Fossil I expect it to keep good time. And for an affordable watch with a nice design and good fit/finish this is a good purchase in my humble opinion."
4.0,"I am Tall, so often sleeves are too short on me.  Not this one!  YAY! Nice cut, nicely fitted, and long sleeves!"
4.0,The magnet wrist band is my favorite type of wrist band. However the magnet comes out easily. It does go right back in and works just fine afterwards but if it’s placed on something metal the magnet can pull right out of the little slot it sits in.
4.0,"I didn't realize that the pants were not actual denim... i like them regardless. They're comfortable standing, sitting, or even crouching. I would buy them again... in black next time."
4.0,great shoes at a great price on Amazon!
4.0,The holographic effect in the photo is only noticeable if you have a flashlight on it. Otherwise it is a dark grey with a slight holographic sheen.
4.0,"I'm 5'0 and it is hard to find a maxi dress that is short enough.  This was perfect, I still to wear a small heel to prevent it from dragging on the floor, but definitely a lot shorter than most maxi's.  The material is thinner and slightly clingy, but I'm still going to keep it.  I did not have any problems with the dress being see-thru."
4.0,Fits perfectly. Its not a no show socks.
4.0,"Not a big fan of the 100% Polyester material, but nice feels like it’s well made-good quality. Fast shipping"
4.0,Was too long
4.0,Very cute bracelet. My only problem is that it's very flimsy and delicate. I'm constantly scared that'll it'll break
4.0,"Trying to give this as a gift yet, it came with no idea as to how to wear it. Contacted the seller to see if they can forward me a picture, instructions-something. I've noticed that things that come out of China usually don't have any instructions and come in cheap packaging-takes away from the products (is very irritating)."
4.0,"When up a size and it still feels a bit small, but it's still a great product."
4.0,My girlfriend is very happy with them. Now I'm looking for a matching bracelet. They are a good price and look great.
4.0,Very cute but the lens scratch easily. Make sure you have a carrying case.
4.0,"I bought this for my 14 year old Supernatural fan.  For the price, I expected a small, insignificant piece. I was pleasantly surprised by the weight and feel of the charm.  Can't wait to see her face when she opens it on Christmas morning.<br />Also, the shipping was much quicker than expected.  The original estimate showed the necklace arriving January 10- way late to put under the tree. The necklace actually arrived December 20- all the way from China."
4.0,"It's cute and all, but the gold lines are shiny and make it a little hard to see if any light is shining on it.  I like it just fine but you have to hold your arm just so to see it.  :)"
4.0,This would’ve been five stars except even with stretch it was slightly tight fitting<br />Is funky though and I like it in my wardrobe anyway
4.0,Inexpensive but looks OK if not high class.  How does one open the case to change the battery?
4.0,Excellent short but the sizes are one size off.
4.0,A little smaller than what I thought they would be and the stones aren’t very pink but they’re adorable on my 1 year old!! The locking backs are great so she doesn’t pull them out!!
4.0,"My son likes it! The seller is very quick on responding my concerns. For the price, it is a good buy."
4.0,Cute band. Looks nice with my gold watch
4.0,"Okay, I knew this bag was going to be big but it is HUGE!!!!  Way to big to be practical in most situations.  Good quality and very sturdy though!"
4.0,I received alot of compliments as the print and color of skirt is very pretty!  It is very comfortable too!
4.0,"These are pretty nice jeans in terms of look and feel. They are a slim fit, but since there's an elastic give, they don't feel tight or uncomfortable. The waist and length sizing is true (34x34). The overall build quality is good. It does have a rather short rise, however, which means the jeans sit lower than I like on my hips. The zipper, while of good quality, is also rather short, which is annoying.<br /><br />Not perfect, but a decent (4-star) pair of jeans. If the rise were a little longer, as well as a longer zipper length, it would be a 5-star pair."
4.0,"Very comfy shirt! Definitely order up though, as sizes run small."
4.0,bigger then i was expecting them to be
4.0,"A very pretty dress. Bought it for my daughter's dance. The quality is not bad at all. Delivered super fast. The sellers even contacted me with a request for actual measurements... Still beats me why the dress fits so tight, that it looks like if she gains even one more pound, she won't be able to zip it."
4.0,"I like everything about this apron except the ties in the back are for skinny people.  I can't imagine why they need to skimp on the length of the ties, but they did.  If you have a generous girth, it might not fit."
4.0,The only reason I gave it four stars is because I have fuller breast and the top is not supportive for me. The quality of the 2pcs is great. The pants fit amazing.
4.0,"Very comfortable to sleep in, although one of the caps had a slightly loose elastic band, so I’ve been using that one for day time only. These are really nice for preserving curls overnight, but be advised: if you have a looser curl pattern and medium hair or longer, you WILL need to pineapple your hair before putting it in the bonnet, otherwise you WILL look squished and lopsided in the morning. When used correctly, however, curls stay defined and shiny, even sleeping with damp hair. Great experience overall!"
4.0,love it but it way to big. cant wear it
4.0,This shirt is a little small for a mens medium. The quality of the shirt is good but that doesnt do much good if its too short and too tight around the chest area
4.0,"First of all this a great dress, very forgiving.<br />I am a size small even though I'm 140 lbs and usually medium to large so I would definitely size down.<br /><br />I originally got a small in green and loved it, so I contacted the company to ask when the purple would be back in stock in a size small and I was told that they wouldn't be restocking at all in that size.<br /><br />So I went ahead and got the medium.<br />By the time it arrived they had restocked the size small!<br />So some miscommunication there with whoever answers the emails.<br /><br />Anyway I ordered the small and was able to compare the 2 sizes. They are definitely different materials.<br />The Small in both colors is a slightly thinner slipperier material with a slight sheen. It drapes beautifully and the color is a bit brighter in person. The Medium as you can see in the pictures is a slightly warmer purple and a bit duller in person. The material of the medium is an opaque matte jersey fabric that clings a bit more and is thus a bit less flattering but nonetheless a lovely style.<br />Basically with the small size I wouldn't feel the need to wear shapewear underneath whereas the medium I probably would.<br />My stats are 5ft 4"" 140lbs 36"" 28"" 41""<br />And the small is definitely the winner."
4.0,"The gold extenders change color after you wear them, but still work well."
4.0,"I have a 00 waist but definitely I have something on my behind, my legs aren't stick thin they're toned (as a runner 5'0 100lbs) and these fit slightly loose. There are small crinkles and I have to fold the band; however the quality is very very good for 18.99 and the leggings are SOO comfy. Xxs should be made."
4.0,"I really liked the style of this suit, it was just too large for me."
4.0,"works well for what I need it for.  pretty accurate for a cheaper watch.  seems to wear well, so far.  it is light, and not too big."
4.0,"definitely order a size larger than you normally wear and if you plan to use these more than as a short use costume, you will want to reinforce the stitching and  change the buckles and maybe even the buttons.  They are cheaper than they need to be to keep the price reasonable."
4.0,Very well constructed.  Would have been a five star review but the straps are quite thin.
4.0,"Work very well, good comfort level. A little thin for me or I would have given 5 stars."
4.0,"Billabong didn't disappoint in middle school when it was social suicide not to own a billabong cord jacket, almost 30 years later, still doesn't disappoint even for my teen who can't get enough the hoodies!!! Nice ice blue, cool comfy hoodie."
4.0,I was looking for a thin wool sock and this fits the bill except the band is tight at top. I may clip one and see if that helps without the whole sock unraveling.
4.0,Pretty necklace. A tad darker than I would have liked but it's still pretty and I'm sure I'll still wear it!
4.0,Fun dress but did need to gem just a tad long
4.0,"I got this bra to wear as a bralette under my baseball jersey, it looks so cute! I have a rather large chest (36 DD) and the XXL fit ok. I’m not uncomfortable in it but I’m glad I followed some reviews and sized up. I’m happy with this purchase and enjoyed it."
4.0,"I love everything about this nightgown except that it is too small for me. They are out of larger sizes so I can't even order the next size up.<br /><br />I love the colors and style, feminine but not girly or obnoxiously sexy. The lightweight material is perfect for summer sleeping. I'm so bummed that it didn't fit me. It was just too tight around the shoulder and upper body area. I like my clothes to fit in a relaxed loose fashion or else they drive me crazy.<br />I'm 5'4"" and 140 lbs.<br /><br />Returned for a refund.<br /><br />I noticed another reviewer saying the small was too large, so I am surprised that the large is too small. This is why I am thinking the sizing for these nightgowns must be off. It's such a shame because it would be an awesome nightgown otherwise. I'm hoping they will get more in stock and I can try an extra-large some day..."
4.0,"The package came within the time it said it would and came exactly like the picture, other than the fact that it was a bit squashed. It has a few bent bits like the straw but its not too bad. A bit oddly shaped but I'll go ahead and blame postage for that one &lt;3"
4.0,Runs large. Comfy.
4.0,My daughter is between sizes right now. She normally wear crocs. 6 are too small right now and 7 are too big. So I read the reviews on these saying the sizes typically run a little big. So I bought the 6-6.5 and they truly fit like a 6.5 which is perfect for us right now! The design is cute. And I bought these during a lightning deal so got these for a great price!
4.0,"The belt is overall nice. I won't know the quality of the belt until I try it as my other inexpensive belts usually crack and peel so we shall see if this does the same. As far as the belt buckle, print design it looks legit in a faded sense. The print logo is basically the same except light however unless you're analyzing it as a bystander you can't tell. Even my husband says it looks legit to the 600$ belt.<br />Cons:<br />Packaging was good HOWEVER I believe in the process of being made I see some ink marks on the inside of the belt and scratches on the actual belt buckle and that is with it being covered with a plastic cover. So it had to have happened pre packaging. Overall it is a nice fake."
4.0,"The top part is a tad too slouchy for liking as it just seems a little frumpy. The material is nice and comfy, so that's a plus. My friends and I all tried it on as we are all different sizes. It wasn't really flattering on any of us, but it's cute enough for super casual wear."
4.0,Cute top to wear with Jean's or yogas.
4.0,It a little large
4.0,Nice dress for price but order it 2 sizes bigger for a comfortable fit
4.0,"Very cute and looked just like the pictures. But not very durable, I guess you have to be gentle with them."
4.0,"This bra is really nice, I love that it zips up the front. the material is nice and soft. The only thing I really have a complaint about is that the bottom of the zipper rubs and irritates the skin. There is a piece of fabric that is meant to cover up the closure but it doesn't work."
4.0,I really like it but it's on a small side.
4.0,"I really like it, comfortable but it would be a bit small for a guy."
4.0,"Fit is somewhat small (or maybe I'm somewhat big). They are a little snug, but with a long shirt, I can hide the bulges. I like the lace...very pretty. Nice stretch to the fabric."
4.0,"Super comfortable, true to size, great material it's soft and looks great!! Love it"
4.0,Their for my husband so I haven't worn them obviously.  They are soft and look size appropriate.
4.0,Larger than anticipated.  Very comfortable.
4.0,"Good light weight cover up. I don't put it in the drier, just the washer, on gentle cycle and then onto a drying stand, so the color holds up, doesn't look faded."
4.0,"I like the incredibly silky feel of the plush fluffy material, and the length fits true to size; however these are pretty stiff and the space between the thong and the footbed is pretty tight so I need to kind of scriggle my toes a lot in order to get them all the way on. I've got feet with normal arches and normal width. I'd still recommend them though!!"
4.0,"This is a very pretty watch.  When the sun hits it , it sparkles and even reflects light on the wall.  The watch has a well made feel to it.  Its nice that it is water resistant.  The watchband however has a cheap feel to it.  It is a comfortable watch to wear.  Overall for the money this is a good deal.  It would be a nice gift for any important lady in your life."
4.0,My son loves them! Well worth the money!
4.0,I bought this as a birthday gift for a friend. It's exactly as advertised and the chain is longer than I expected. The owl is really cute.
4.0,"I received the bracelet of Pietersite beads today. I am happy with the beads but I would be happier if the bracelet would have been longer to about 7 1/2 or 8 inches in length.  It measures about 6 1/2 inches so when I stretch it for wearing, it becomes tight and uncomfortable on my wrist which is about 7 1/2 to 8 inches. The beads are beautiful."
4.0,For the price this is a nice accent peice. Easy to adjust lenght myself.
4.0,It is exactly as described. Perfect for the kids. They loved it!  Came fairly quickly too. Was pleased overall with the product.
4.0,"As I person who was a teenager in the 80s, these belts took me back.  Everything comes back into fashion. These belts are cute, and fit my currently plus-sized waist. The set comes with two styles of belts. Each of the belts are in silver and gold. The metals are little antiqued in color. I prefer the leaf belts, but the rose belts are also cute. I have a maxi dress that is so cute, but I couldn't find the right belt for it. These belts are perfect. I love that I can use either silver or gold. I might even try combining the two leaf belts and connecting the gold to the silver leaf and vice versa. I love mixing metals.These would look great on a maxi dress or with jeans. They would also look cute to cinch a shirt or jacket. They would look  nice with a dressy outfit, but equally nice accessorizing a casual outfit. The floral belt hooks and goes straight across. The leaves on the leaf belt go one over the other. I do like how they bounce back after being stretched. This product was purchased at a discounted rate for an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"This dress is cute. Zipper seems iffy. Feels like if I bend over wrong, it's a wrap. LOL Overall, decent for the price."
4.0,"I purchased thie LILBETTER dress in navy/white and red/white.  The fabric is the softest rayon and the dresses are adorable and perfect for the extreme heat and humidity  here in Charleston, SC.  My only drawback is that the dress is a little snug in the chest area.  Now I am quite top heavy and I have gained weight this summer, so I cannot fault the dresses.  I do advise that if you are top heavy and broad shouldered, just be mindful.  But I love the little dresses.<br /><br />If you don't like to iron also, these are dresses that must be ironed after being hand washed, but the ironing is worth it because the dresses are crisp and cool for the summer."
4.0,"Fits as advertised, but I wish I'd gotten a size up, which is just a personal preference on looser fitting shrugs. Not sheer, light enough for a summer wedding outdoors."
4.0,I am usually a xl-2xlg. I chose a 3 xl. It’s really tight! And the material is weak. Absolutely no compression effect!
4.0,"I really like this vest.  It fits well, its warm when you need it warm, and comfortable once you get inside.  There's only one complaint I have.  The snaps.  They work well but it seems like there's a thousand snaps and rivets.  I have the black vest and all the snaps and rivets really take away from the great look of the vest.  So I got a black permanent magic marker and colored a bunch of them.  Looks much better now.  Don't know how the marker will hold up to being washed but I can always color them again."
4.0,"I ordered these expecting them to be th same size as other septum rings I own but they were very very small and I'm finding that it's really hard to screw on the little spikes/balls. They look fine, and they do fit my 16g piercing as they should, but definitely smaller than I would've expected."
4.0,"I might have missed product specifications in the web description, but this bag is much bigger than I expected.  Not a problem really, but was just surprised by the size.  It's good to carry a note pad, work folders, yogurt/lunch stuff, even an extra pair of shoes!  So the bigger size is functional!!  Love the color, that's pretty much spot on with the photo online.  Lots of good inside pockets, too.  The only thing I wish is that there were 1 hook or loop inside the bag to attach keys -- because it's big, if I put my keys in the main compartment, it's hard to root around to find them.  But there are enough outer pockets that can be used instead."
4.0,I like but size is smaller that I expected.
4.0,I gave this to my Daughter for Christmas she loved it she can put my Grandson and Granddaughters birth stones in it
4.0,"I can't honestly give a full review yet, since I haven't delivered this gift to the designated recipient. While I  could judge the appearance, I didn't actually wear/use the masks myself. The thickness looked good and they probably were comfortable,but those two ratings are a guesstimate."
4.0,"Very cute, soft and fits well"
4.0,"Good quality shirt fit as expected. Giving it 4 Stars instead of 5 because it was a little boxy in design, not very flowy."
4.0,"I like the look of these sunglasses as well as how lightweight they are! They also stay on pretty well behind my ears & don’t pinch after a period of time, which I have had issues with other sunglasses. Great price point for a trendy style."
4.0,"This shirt fits loosely and comfortably.  The first time I wore it I got several compliments. The shirt fits a little loosely and the sleeves were frequently getting caught on my desk chair, but this is a perfect Summer to Fall work top.<br /><br />I received this item from Amazon Vine and voluntarily give my review"
4.0,"Fit me well, I typically wear 2xl but the xl fit fine (it was the biggest size available)."
4.0,"Decent shoe that looks good, but edges around fabric wear out pretty quickly. We'd still buy again for the sturdiness of the shoes soles."
4.0,This meets the need.
4.0,FIT TIGHT ARUND MY THIGHS
4.0,Very cute like the picture but the material is very silky and thin.
4.0,"Kind of cheap material, but I needed to represent my country so who cares. Thanks!"
4.0,"I love this bikini! The fit and fabric are both very comfortable. My only complaint (and it is a very minor one) is that the bottoms have a bit more coverage than I was expecting. For reference, my measurements are as follows: 5'3&#34;, 115 lbs, 32B, athletic build"
4.0,Purse was cute. Workmanship could be better.
4.0,Very nice so far.  The RFID definitely works.
4.0,Sizing chart was a little off. I can wear these but they feel tight. Good product but wish I got a size bigger. I ordered according the size chart for size 10 shoes. My advice is to go up a full size.
4.0,"These are fabulous glasses. I wanted to love these, but that are too heavy for regular wear. So buy them and wear them when you want to look fabu."
4.0,"Dress looks great,  slightly tight around the midsection but nothing proper under garments cant fit. Received lots of compliments."
4.0,grandson picked these out & he wears them all the time
4.0,"Great material, beautiful dress. Little too tight in the upper chest area."
4.0,"I bought these for my son to replace the ones he left in Florida. These are a great value - they leak a bit, but are otherwise solid quality. Recommend!"
4.0,"Plus size woman, fit as expected. Like most lace lingerie, fragile and tears easily. Worth the money, would buy again."
4.0,"I love these except for the fact that they're plastic...which is bad because they are prone to break a lot faster. Besides that I love these glasses, I just wish they were made of sturdier material."
4.0,Great looking shirt but runs small
4.0,a darling shirt but a little snug for me.
4.0,I wear a large in shirts and a large in the hoodie fit me. There is no stretch to it so if you are on the larger size of a large I would size up. The colors are not as vibrant as the photo otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.
4.0,"I have several of these dresses in different colors. I can comfortably say that if you are looking for something simple and relaxing for everyday wear (move from work to the bar), this is it! Be mindful that it is slightly see through so be cognizant of panty choice."
4.0,I have not had any problems. Well labeled bottle. Mixes well. Serves its purpose. I plan to get bigger bottle when I need more.
4.0,"This is a beautiful skirt and the material is high quality.  It could get a bit warm in the summer months.  I am a size 16/18 and purchased the XL and it fits perfectly.  However, I am on the short side at 5'3&#34; and will have to get several inches taken off of the skirt because it is super long.  Nevertheless, I am pleased with this purchase and will probably order another one in a different style."
4.0,"Product is what it's description says it is, I guess I must have a big head as it does not droop back like in the picture, but I still am going to keep it and wear it.  Good quality for the price"
4.0,Muy buen reloj excelente para regalar
4.0,Sharp looking belt
4.0,"I absolutely love how soft these sleep shorts are! The fabric print is super cute. However, the fabric hasn’t been super great in the wash. I haven’t had pilling, but there’s been a lot of fading."
4.0,Top fit as expected but the bottoms were tiny.  I ordered the red too in the same size and those bottoms fit.  I'm not sure why these were so small.  It's a very cute suit though.  The fringe provides some extra coverage but still looks sexy!
4.0,This was so cute and girly. Husband approved.
4.0,These are very cute yet very very small and flexible.  I wore them daily for about a month til i lost them because of the type of closure.
4.0,"Great price, somewhat snug fit. Material isn't the most durable, and the packaging could be better (I cut the shirt of one opening the package with my letterman because the package bad no filler."
4.0,"Super cute, but the stitching on the handles needs to be redone"
4.0,"Hold up well.  I have small narrow feet and they are just long enough,"
4.0,"This product is nice but you get what you pay for. I have only worn the belt once but it already shows signs of wear.  The golden buckle part shows some discoloration that I only expect to get worse quickly. But overall for less than $10 I do really like the belt.  I would not get this if you're on the larger side as I don't think it would be comfortable.  The band is elastic and does stretch but it would probably get tight quickly.  For reference I am 5'3&#34; and about 105lbs, the belt fit me very comfortably."
4.0,"This is a nice, thick sweater. Great quality for the price but the sizing is a little small. I would size up if you want to close the sweater. I am a size 16 and got the 2x. It fit more like an xl. Just a little bit tight. Def not large enough to close but it's pretty and looks exactly like the picture!!!"
4.0,I was incredibly shocked because I had low expectations for this- the pictures made the pants look short but there not at all! They were perfect length- I’m not big but have a little belly n the top rides up a little n has to be adjusted often but overall I love the set!
4.0,"These pants are very comfy. I wear them on the weekends with sneakers, but I have also worn them with a nicer top and shoes. The band is very comfortable with a little elasticity. They wash well also."
4.0,So cute otherwise
4.0,Love the design and the base color.  I bought a similar style top in the 4x which was the same brand but the black and cherry.  It's a tad longer and streachyer.  This one you can like other comments put it on without having to unzip it but it's pretty snug.  I give it a 4 out of 5. I'm not a big girl that shows off her gut and like I said these shirts are short.  Stop at the belly button.
4.0,"I like that this can be used in your hair, around your neck, around your waist, on a handbag, or even in the household as a decor accessory. It's large, considering some other necklace styles are thinner.  It is long enough to play with."
4.0,"Love love love this dress!  Ordering another!<br /><br />I'm 5'2 160 lbs, 34DD, I ordered the medium! Material is great!"
4.0,"This bathing suit was cute but not as sheer as I would have liked. I read reviews prior so I did size down.  The one problem I had was that even though I sized down, once it got wet the straps became loose/baggy and I had to keep pulling them up for support."
4.0,Print quality is good but it does run small.
4.0,They fit as expected. Not tight around the legs.
4.0,"Very comfy and cute. Didn't like the shoulder pads, though."
4.0,Looks great. A Little hard to keep untangled.
4.0,"Ordered this as a last minute option for vacation, so happy I did! The bottoms are a perfect fit & super flattering! The top didn’t fit too great, I probably won’t wear it again. I had to tighten the straps so much that you couldn’t see the criss cross in the back at all and the front is quite skimpy. I wore nipple covers to be safe."
4.0,A little thin material but not quite see through so still will wear
4.0,"I followed the advice of a previous review to size up and it was great! I’m usually a medium-large (5’7” and 155lbs) and got the DOUBLE xl. And I like the fit. A little longer than I would like but that’s ok. So comfy and definitely loose. Just wearing a pretty sports bra under it, love it so far!"
4.0,Good quality and a lot of pockets for cards which is great =) Very convenient and also cute. One of the buttons came off but was easily fixable with some glue
4.0,"I have had several of these slim, great storage wallets in the past, and this one is very nice.  Love the deep ocean blue color.  The ones I bought in the mall had the strap break where it bend to snap over the credit cards.  This one seems pretty strong.<br />The only feature keeping me from loving it:  it is lacking a pocket next to the zipper to slide bills or receipts into.  I have to cram those into the zippered part...and that's where I would normally just put coins."
4.0,"I bought these for my toddler for winter and they served the purpose. They were better quality than I expected and my toddler really liked them.<br />The soles are a nice think rubber which is perfect for winter and there is fur on the inside to help keep little feet warm. I like the zip on the side because you can skip them on quickly. The bunny is cute as long as it stays clean.<br />I give the shoes 4 stars because they started showing wear after 1 month of continuous use. I was expecting them to not show wear so far. The ribbon on the bunny came apart and started I weaving. Eventually the treads on the lace becoming fray.<br />Overall, cute and practical shoe for the price but will only couple months."
4.0,Really nice stainless steel watch.
4.0,"Good party outfit for the price. Nothing exceptional about it, but definitely worth it for the one time use!"
4.0,"These are great, but even if your waist is 30 inches or smaller you may want to go for the medium instead of small.  Specifically, if you are not rail thin."
4.0,"I love skulls, and purple is my favorite color. This arrived as quickly as expected, and in good shape. It was a little stiff as new bandannas are, but quick hand wash took care of that. My only issue is that the actual color appears more pinkish/lavender than purple."
4.0,they run small but they are still cute
4.0,This sports bra is supportive and fits as expected. I like the color and that you can remove the pads if you want. I prefer it without them.
4.0,"Nice material, well made. I ordered a large and it is tight."
4.0,Only reason not a five star like the other ones I bought same brand is color description off on this one ...
4.0,"Love the pants, they just run a little small"
4.0,Nice works really good
4.0,"These black socks are solid. They go up to about low calf. They are easy to stretch and put on.  I have worn more comfortable socks.  That is not intentioned to say they aren't.  Extremely washable, too. I do like them. Great value."
4.0,"I opened the box and was pleasantly surprised.  The watch was exactly what I was expecting.  Good looking face with a comfortable band.  The case was slightly deeper than I expected, but it was exactly as it was spec'd out in the description.  Additionally it came a day earlier than expected.<br />It came with an online warranty and instructions.  Excellent.<br />I will comment again if the battery life goes sooner than I expect."
4.0,"A little small, but beautiful and comfortable as can be!"
4.0,"Love it! Great value for the price. Fits perfect. I love the high waist and whimsical print. I will buy more in other patterns. I only gave it 4 stars because the hem is a little narrow, so in my opinion it could've berm sewn a little better. However, for the price and my purposes it is fine."
4.0,"I have problems with my glasses slipping and I don't like getting glasses with the wired nose pads because I don't like how they get stuck in my hair if I put them on the top of my head for a minute. I got these to see if that would help the issue of my glasses sliding down my nose.<br />They were easy to install and fit decently but what I don't like is the ""treads"" on the nose pads. I am sensitive to fabrics and materials and so these don't feel the nicest on my nose. I could see that the treads might be helpful if you were in a situation where you are sweating. They would probably stay on well and probably add a little bit of breathability. I am going to try soft silicone ones to see if they will feel better and stay on as well as these do.<br />I marked them down for the treads and comfort. They are not horribly uncomfortable but not that I would consider them soft and comfortable to wear for long and they leave a little more of a mark on my nose."
4.0,Fits well but a little long at the bottom for a short woman.
4.0,"Well made, cute. Recommend."
4.0,"This baby shoe is so cute and I love it. I bought it when my daughter was one month old, but the size is way too big for a newborn or infant. In fact, my daughter is 6 months and she still can't fit this shoe! But it's made well and it very soft. I can't wait until she can fit it!"
4.0,This item dresses up any outfit. It’s lightweight and charming!
4.0,"This Brass Tacks Leathercraft Heavy Duty Canvas Vintage Buckle Strap Briefcase Messenger Bag has an authentic feel and look. Lots to like with only a few concerns:<br /><br />LIKES:<br />+ Well made.  All fabric, leather, stitching, and brass work seems to be top notch.<br />+ Multiple ways to carry it. I especially like the shoulder strap which has sturdy &#34;quick release&#34; connectors to attach it to the bag's D-rings. When it's on, it's ON.  The strap will not come off unless you choose to take it off.<br />+ Easy off shoulder strap. Following up on the previous bullet point, yes, the strap stays on, but it's also easy to take off. MUCH easier then other bags I've had. But the way the strap attaches, it's not going to come off by accident.<br />+ The leather has an awesome antique look, and the canvas is sturdy.<br />+ You get lots of pockets of various sizes -- and even zippered ones.<br /><br />CONCERNS:<br />- The write up hints that the bag is padded. It's not. Specifically, the write up says, &#34;Padded Inner Bag Included.&#34; This is referring to one smaller pocket built into the satchel.  The outer canvas is NOT padded.<br />- I'm wishing the bag was just a bit bigger. Yes, the dimensions are listed (15&#34; x 11 x 3.1&#34;), so you know what you're getting. But it's a really nice bag that could get used for more things -- if it were just a tad bigger.<br /><br />FYI, the buckled straps are just for show. The flap actually closes using magnets.<br /><br />Overall, it's a really nice bag that can serve multiple purposes. I think my daughter wants to use it as bag for toting around her sketching / art supplies, and frankly, it has a great look plus lots of pockets for that. But it could also be used by students as a book / school bag for those who don't want to use backpacks, among other uses.<br /><br />For a rating, my first impression is 4.5 stars. The quality is REALLY nice on this bag, and I think it's going to last a LONG time. From that perspective, it's definitely five stars. But the lack of padding on the outer shell and slightly smaller-than-optimal size makes the bag somewhat limiting, so I'm going with four. That said, it's definitely a &#34;recommend&#34; from me if you are okay with the size and the padding issue. It's a high quality bag, for sure."
4.0,"Obviously lower quality fabric but for the price, totally fine. Fits great at waist but the top was a little baggy on me. Colors are fantastic and length is cute as is for an old-school below the knee look or for use with a petticoat so it's more like the picture."
4.0,I am a size 4 and probably should have ordered ordered a medium.  The small is snug but they really stretch.
4.0,"I usually wear S, ordered M as per the size chart of the seller. It fits very well, will be a little tight if I gain some weight on my waist. Love the fact it's cotton. The color is not peachy pink as on my pic, very light pink I'd say.  Not see through. Loved the back part of the dress."
4.0,Small fit though
4.0,The dress was great
4.0,It's shorter than what it looks in the picture
4.0,Order a size up. These run small. And aren't breathe able. Rub the skin right off his finger.
4.0,It fits a little smaller then expected. I brought two but in different colors the other fits fine of the same size.
4.0,Very pretty earrings and an excellent value. My wife loves them - which is all that really matters- because they are light and very simple. Elegant but not overstated.
4.0,Brings elegance to any scarf
4.0,"I’m normally a small, and boight the medium based on the reviews, and that was the right call. Cute top. Interesting fabric. It’s not cotton, but it’s a knit."
4.0,Super cute crop top! Shiny spandex.
4.0,"Very cute charm, but details are a bit less so in person. My daughter loves it though since it has her birthstone and a horse."
4.0,"love the booty scrunch, on it, I'm normally a medium but bought a small and it fits great, the only down side is that is not well made, after my first used some of the stitches were coming off, i had to resaw it but for the price i was ok with it"
4.0,This is a high waist bikini. The bikini bottoms come up to your belly button. The bikini top has no clips or hooks. It ties in the front in a knot. The back of the bikini top looks almost like a sports bra. It covers a lot. The material is soft and comfortable.
4.0,"LOVE the dress.  The color was a bit more mint green than I expected, but that's not a huge deal.  I received so many compliments when I wore it!  It's comfortable, I felt great in it, and the midi length and long sleeves are perfect for fall."
4.0,I love it ! Only thing is; I.have to watch what I wear it with because it sheds.
4.0,Beautiful glasses I love them but my only concern is that the handles are cheaply made
4.0,Does fit slightly big and the elastic back isnt very flattering but i used it under a blazer dress the entire time and it looked great from the neck. Probably needs tailoring if you want to use it without a coat.
4.0,The only thing I don't like about the boot is the tag on the back says AMY where it would say Bearpaws or Any other popular brand. Everything else is great.
4.0,I purchased this dress for my daughter's pinning ceremony for Alpha Kappa Alpha and the dress fits her perfectly. It's a nice dress for the money.
4.0,"I could have given this bracelet a 5 becauae it is stunning and beautiful but, unfortunately, it is loose on my wrist. I have a small wrist so this bracelet is not fit for me. Luckily, my daughter, who has a bigger wrist, liked it much. So Injust gave it to her. And she's happy."
4.0,This is very pretty and sparkly. The piece feels quality and the silver is very nice. The only negative is that the slide loosens throughout the day. I have another similar braclet that stays tight. This one does not.
4.0,"This is only my third clothing item to buy from amazon, sight unseen, so I wasn't expecting much.  However, the dress is much nicer than I thought it would be.  I need it for a naval ceremony for my son, I have been unable to find anything and this was a last resort.  First, sizing.  It helps when you have a reference point, so I am five foot four and weight 130 pounds.  I ordered a small. I can go small or medium on dresses, so I just went small since it's more loose on the bottom and fitted on the top.  I'm small in the bust, A cup.  The dress hits me right at the knee, which is what I wanted.  It's hard to find a dress these days without it being so ridiculously hoochie short.  This one hits you where the advertised picture shows. Usually on these types of dresses, I have trouble with the bust area.  It falls open, because I don't have enough to fill it. Not so on this dress.  It's just snug enough that I can bend over and it doesn't move, nor do I need to secure it with fashion tape or a tiny safety pin.  Thank god.  The fit it good, the color, almost just like the picture.  I feel as though mine is a slightly richer purple, so that's fine.  I really don't see this as a vintage dress, but then that's not what I am using it for.  It just looks like a nice wrap dress.  The fabric does not feel cheap, but it isn't heavy.  When you live in Texas and you are going to Florida for the ceremony, you don't want it heavy, that's for sure.  The dress looks very nice, considering how reasonable the cost is.  You should know that because it is that clingy, soft material, you can see your bra lines and underwear lines.  I am one of those people that is bothered by this, but I have no line underwear I will wear with it.  The bra can't be helped, it's just that type of material. I hope all this helps someone, I know when I read reviews it helps to know what size the reviewer is etc.  I am keeping the dress and I hope to update this review after I attend the ceremony to go over the comfort factor. But if you are on the fence, go ahead and get it because it feels and looks like a nice dress you would find in a regular store."
4.0,You get a LOT of belt I mean this thing is huge.
4.0,It was a bit small. The zipper leaves an uncomfortable indentation on your skin and it doesn't go over the knee. Also the zipper bunches up in places and gets irritating. I was so hopeful for these. I would buy it again if they would fix these issues.<br /><br />Update: the seller contacted me and offered to refund me because I was not happy with the product. I thought this was excellent service. They also said they would notify the producer of the product to let them know that improvements can be made. I would have lived for this to work. It's so much easier to put on myself than to have to ask for help everyday.
4.0,"One less star because it's really overpriced, but the item worked very well and was comfortable during travel and lots of walking. Much less bulky than other products and flexible so the fabric expands in thickness as you pack more inside."
4.0,"These socks were made for women with small feet. The notion that one large size range fits all never works for me so I look for a smaller range to minimize the length--if possible.  These are great. If they were a tad softer, they'd be perfect."
4.0,I really Ike it it dose run small so get a size bigger.i like it it is not to heavy.its nice for this time of yeat
4.0,Fit very nice....
4.0,5'4 - 176lbs - 36D -12 pants<br />I normally wear a large but this was super tight. Size up if you want fitted but still be able to move freely and not shop your lumps/bumps to much.<br />Its very cute and a comfortable material.
4.0,"Great for nurses and a long shift. I wear them 5 days a week at my job as a nurse. My only complaint is the compression level is a tad less than I’d like, but overall well worth the price for the quality of sock."
4.0,"Nice socks. I liked better when is more cotton made, but this are ok."
4.0,The clasps is too long. That’s the only problem.
4.0,Love the style and look of the glasses. The only down fall with these sunglasses is the metal nose piece. There's no cushion all metal and it's kinda uncomfortable and leaves a mark on my face after I take them off. And the arms are all metal kinda dangerous if you're are not careful when putting them on.
4.0,Well it kinda rough i dont know how it feels buth it hard. Im afraid it can hurt neck of my woman.
4.0,"Great wig, the curls stayed even when I fell asleep wearing it. It was a little small on me but I also have a lot of hair."
4.0,"well made socks, very colorful, a little small for boys feet but they are good socks"
4.0,Great actually amazing for the price.<br />Only issue isnthe black jewels is resin or plastic so it chips and scratches REALLY easily
4.0,"These pants were pretty comfortable although I could have gotten away with a size smaller. If you don't want a snug fit, then order the size indicated in the size chart but if you want a tighter fit, plan to order a size down since it is a stretchy material. For me, the pants come up to about 2 inches above my ankle."
4.0,The only thing I did no like about the cap is the material under the brim is white and it is easily soiled just taking it on and off even with so-called clean hands.
4.0,I needed a few masks for the hot weather and these are perfect!
4.0,"The length of the foot is fine, but the strap that goes over one's foot is very loose; I can nearly stick both feet under one sandal's straps. Not too much a problem while walking on a flat surface, but if the surface is tilted to the side, my foot wants to slide off to the outside; also while sitting without my feet on the floor they tend to fall off."
4.0,"Like the color. Shipping charges seemed excessive, however."
4.0,i like it alot..nice design! love the extra bags and pouches to help keep me organized.  shade is exactly as eppected.  not sure how long it will last but i won't wear everyday .....
4.0,I wear these when I'm shooting guns and they seem to work very well. They are all plastic but appear to be well built and definitely suppress loud sounds
4.0,"It is pretty cute, it is two separate pieces which I did not expect but overall I like it!"
4.0,"Nice quality, thick cushion. Couldn't tell from the pictures but the seemingly white thread in the gray slippers is actually glittery thread in person. I wear size 6 in sneakers and the small was not to loose or snug."
4.0,The back length is a little too short
4.0,Fit is a little on the small side but overall I really like it!
4.0,I like the band! I only wish that they had gold details instead of silver to match the Garmin Vivoactive 4s but it’s only a small dot that shows so overall not a bad mismatch! There is a tiny scratch in the silicone as well but not a big deal for a fraction of the price. This band is actually more comfy than the original garmin band!
4.0,"They come in a good packaging that makes it look good quality and the sunglasses are not bad, but they’re uneven. After adjustment maybe they’ll be way better"
4.0,It covers about four cards. Two on each side.
4.0,Nice little touch for my Vulcan motorcycle
4.0,Very comfortable. Fits snug at the very top nut that's just my big calfs.
4.0,"These silicone nose pieces last much longer than the last style that I purchased, however they still only stay on my glasses for less than one week before the glue dissolves and no longer sticks. I hope to find a brand in the future that uses a more permanent glue."
4.0,Love it to use with my blue dress. Recommeded
4.0,Do not expect anything fabulous. The quality is “ok”. True to the size.
4.0,"Well when I bought this dress I wasn't sure how it would fit, but I was not disappointed with the way it fitted. It wasn't large nor was it small. I am glad."
4.0,"It's really hard to put on because it's so tight but it's job is to make sure your fat don't hang out!  There are also metal bands that come out easily, that's why i gave it 4 stars, but some people may find them uncomfortable anyway."
4.0,"The material feel is awesome, they feel so soft and they are comfy but they run small. I wanted them for jammy pants so I order the large so they would be extra comfy but they are a little on the tight side and more like a medium than a large so if you want them to fit looser then order the next size up."
4.0,"I realllllly wanted to love this top! The material is thinner than I hoped it would be and it is pretty form fitting so it looks wrinkly with a cami underneath. I still wear it occasionally and it's cute, but not one of my favorites from PattyBoutik. I will continue buying their other tops though, as I feel like this is a quality brand. This one was just a miss for me, in particular."
4.0,It's really cute and fits great got an XL
4.0,"Great bag for toting around a galaxy tablet, bluetooth keyboard, and a book. Simple, functional, and well-made. Only complaint is that it's difficult to pick up quickly or carry by hand since there's no handle, but the shoulder strap is just right for hands-free carrying."
4.0,But they were too small....I would suggest sizing up one size if you are unsure.  I always wear a small in these types of pants...I'm 5'4 and 130 lbs...I should have ordered a medium.
4.0,"I wear a 36"" waist and bought an XXL. They fit fine and are good for the price. The quality obviously doesn't rival a $60-100 pair of riding shorts, but they serve their purpose and seem to hold up OK."
4.0,I have lots of socks this brand and fit.  They're great and really last.  Of course the themes are the coolest thing of all!  A little tight in the calves though.
4.0,cant complain for the price
4.0,"Great scarves for the price! A little bulky, but al in all I’m pleased."
4.0,"I love this bag! It's my go to bag for everything. I tried switching bags recently but went right back to this one because I love it so much! When I got it the top zipper was sown on funny but I rigged it with a safety pin so problem solved, and I don't think it deters from the bag at all."
4.0,Good fit For my 6’2” son
4.0,It fits my BIG HEAD : )
4.0,Pretty shirt a bit larger than expected
4.0,I love this outfit!  Only problem is the zipper is in the back and really hard to undo or zip up.
4.0,They run a little smaller than last pair but they are made well
4.0,"It was a lot larger than expected. I want my sweatshirts to be loose, but it is very loose. Order your normal size, they have already taken in account it should be loose."
4.0,I was looking for a white 14mm silicone watch band because the leather one my watch came with was so worn out. This band was easy to install and should fit perfectly as long as you measure correctly. 14mm is hard to find so I'm glad they had it here. The only drawback is that it's not as comfortable to wear as other materials like leather or metal perhaps. My wrist is small so maybe it was me...since the band silicone is pretty sturdy/not flimsy. I still like it and don't regret my purchase. Worth a try.
4.0,Liked it very much. Might buy another
4.0,Needed something sturdy that would last on a flights to/from Europe with layovers.  Didn't want to go with plastic or leather in case they ripped off.  These work perfectly and once attached take a bit of work to disconnect.  Exactly what I was looking for.
4.0,Really nice yoga socks... fits very comfortably although a little thin allover. Use it all the time during my weekly yoga classes.
4.0,Mask are thin.. However they're very comfortable and breathable. ear loops are not bothersome at all. Would but again
4.0,This dress is so beautiful. Its very low cut and very small fitting.
4.0,Only reason not giving 5 stars is because they are bigger than expected but will still work in my cartilage
4.0,"This sweatshirt was super comfortable and cute, but the size was just a little bit larger than expected. Overall, I'd say go smaller if you're deciding between two sizes, and would definitely recommend for a great cute and comfy fall or winter sweatshirt!"
4.0,I love these but I didn’t realize they ran soo small I would like to keep them but I need a bigger size
4.0,I have a high instep and these are tight across the top of my foot. Love them so much I’m keeping and going to try to figure out how I can loosen them a little
4.0,"Cute, fun glasses. Quality is as much as you could expect for the price. I've had no bending in the metal frames or scratches on the lenses. Arrived sooner than expected. Check the color before you order - there are multiple options. I got red and love them!"
4.0,"Ordered these shirts before and my husband loves them.  This time they came in the manufacturers bag soaking wet, yet the outside of bag, the shipping box, and other items in box were all dry, so I know it wasn't UPS fault.  Im washing them now praying they won't smell mildewed..."
4.0,"Very stylish and comfortable. I gave it a 4 because the color is MUCH darker than pictured, very close to black."
4.0,I mainly bought this watch for the stopwatch in the gym.  I like that it’s not bulky and the numbers are large.  Only negative is in low light the numbers are a little hard to read.
4.0,quite different but nice
4.0,"Nice Bib, Warm and Comfortable, I would buy again."
4.0,The jacket fits good and it is cute. But a little thin
4.0,"The sleeves create a very elegant look. The top is meant to have a loose, drapey look. It is  a pullover top with no neck closure (button, hook, or zipper etc). I ordered my regular size and would not recommend sizing down as the neck hole might then be too small . The see through section on the sleeves is more stiff than I expected."
4.0,The Dress fit fine but I was disappointed on the length of dress it’s pretty long in back but the front is also long just a tad shorter an it go’s past my knees so it pretty much looks like a long dress instead of a high low on me iam 5”5 tall
4.0,I didn't notice New England wasn't on the shirt. But I'm a fan so I love it!!
4.0,Soft fabric. It has stretch and i not fitted. I love the color and everything about the pajamas. Love that it has drawstring waist to make wearing more comfortable.
4.0,"This is a good “one-season” (maybe two) scarf that looks like something soft and cuddly that your grandma would make.  The yard isn’t super high quality and there are some little inconsistencies in the knit, but because it’s got that casual, cuddly look, it’s still perfectly wearable even after it gets fuzzy from wear - and wash.  I doubt it’ll last more than a couple winters because of it’s open-weave style, but at this price it’s great for winter and then off to donation!"
4.0,"The wrap robe is warm and comfy but I wish I have bought a small size as it is a bit bulky. Great for watching TV, though!"
4.0,Only complaint is it falls down at the chest even when tied on your baby.
4.0,But fun nonetheless
4.0,"This hoodie is very soft and the sherpa lining is super warm. I find this pullover to be perfect as the layer to keep me cozy when I need to take my dog out in the crisp fall air for his walks. I like the deep pockets for my keys and tv remote. It is almost too warm indoors, but cozy enough to chase away any chill. The outside fleece is luxuriously soft to the touch. It covers me to about my knees and is roomy enough to pull over the legs when sitting in my favorite recliner."
4.0,I love PM5K and now I have a shirt which may express my love. :)<br /><br />Only note: Neck hole is like a bazillion sizes too small to squeeze even my tiny girl head through. Had to cut the collar off to feel more comfortable in it.
4.0,"Over all, the size is good, the quality is good, and it fits very well. Thanks!"
4.0,I am 5'8'' 155 lbs and usually wear a medium. I ordered a medium in the black and it was a size too small and too short. I think if I would have sized up to a large it would have been perfect.
4.0,"Unfortunately, the graphics on this sweatshirt leave very little to the imagination.  Bought for my granddaughter, but no way I can allow her to wear to school, as it would be considered R rated.  Guess it's Grandma's now!"
4.0,A lightweight T-shirt came with out a tag so was a plus for me I usually cut the tag out...  I got the shirt really quick....
4.0,"I ordered the color Rose in Large. I'm a size 10, hourglass shape. 40&#34; bust, 36D, 32&#34; waist, 40&#34; hips. The dress was too loose at first, but it fit much better after I washed it. The dress is comfortable, pretty, and fit as expected. The only thing I don't like is that there is an off-center seam in the front. Seams are usually in the back or on the sides. Unfortunately, my dress was sewn with a front seam and it's crooked. It's aggravating. The fabric is stretchy, so you have some wiggle room when ordering based on the manufacturer's measurements. I recommend adding a petticoat under the skirt to give it the flair it should have."
4.0,The diamond studs are lovely. My daughter was very happy with them! They are beautifully made. I would commend them!
4.0,Much more purple in person. Falls to cleavage length
4.0,"I got this dress because the price said $4 and it looked like some comfy. I later realized I was charged $9.99 for shipping. But anyways It’s very simple and airy. I like to wear it at home or when picking up something from the store. If it wasn’t for the shipping charge, I will be buying more."
4.0,love the shirt.. Be aware that it is sheer in the front.. But I love it..
4.0,"Nice weight, fits well. It's better-made than most thermals I've seen lately. We'll see how it holds up, but at this point I'd get another."
4.0,Need to order a size bigger than you usually order
4.0,"Looks good, fits my 19' laptop with accessories along with portfolio and  has plenty of pockets."
4.0,"Very cute but there are a few minor setbacks. The chain and the triangle hooks you attach the chain to are a little flimsy. Only a big deal if you'll but rock climbing or moshing with this cross body.  I suggest just using it as a clutch. Secondly, it is shiny acrylic so it is prone to visible scratches.  DO NOT SET IT DOWN ON CONCRETE, it will quickly loose its luster. Lastly, the inside accommodates literally three things: a car key, a lip product and an iphone (that is not a + or XS model).  Even with only these three things there may be need to assemble them in tetris like fashion to get it to close.<br />But did i mention it is very cute!"
4.0,I’m 5’7” 200 lbs. I ordered the XL 16/18 and they are snug around my hip and stomach. I wear a 16 normally. I suggest sizing up at least 1 size.  They are a light weight linen type material.
4.0,"Beautiful and comfortable, however, the smallest ones are nearly impossible to clip in. Because of this its a fairly painful experience to try and put them in and get them closed."
4.0,smaller than I wanted but nice. clean look. shipping took a bit. but nicely made again just a touch small for French cuffs
4.0,I like wearing this bracelet!!  It's so pretty!!!
4.0,"Style, comfort great watch for the price."
4.0,"I wanted to love this suit. It’s decent quality and the color blue was nice and vibrant. Unfortunately it was too short for me. Because of this, the suit cut into my legs and bum cheeks. I needed it to be longer through the torso. Otherwise, the fit was pretty good. I’m 5’8”, 170lbs and  a 38C."
4.0,These earrings are so cute. Not very expensive looking but who cares - it's for one day. Nice addition to my holiday jewelry.
4.0,"Good quality, works well."
4.0,"These socks are soft, quality construction, they only thing I am disappointed in is the green is not as solid of a color as the rest.  It is still pretty.<br /><br />My son caught me photographing the set and quickly stole the red pair and put them on.  He said ooo these are nice and fresh and soft (he is 7).  He proclaimed he is wearing them on Christmas!<br /><br />I would buy again and in all fairness they are more of a 4.5 then a 4."
4.0,"My complaint was the straps were not sewed on straight and are slightly off, but it doesn’t affect how it’s suppose to be worn. The jean like bottoms are super soft and won’t chafe their legs. Would definitely buy again in a bigger size when she outgrows this size."
4.0,"I really like this dress. The cut is very flattering. I'm glad this brand now offers XS for my petite build. I'm 5'1"" 120lbs. I have other patti dresses in S and this fit a lot better. It is kind of thin as other reviewers said. But I'm keeping it because it looks great on."
4.0,I love how the fabric feels but it is a little tight. Still pretty comfortable though. :)
4.0,My wife like these very much. They have a bit of weight on them.the metal is nice and polished. Not any complaints just would like them to weigh a bit lighter.
4.0,"i have purchased 3 pairs of the boots. i work in them every day and use them for casual wear. after a good while the soul will start to separate from the shoe. i am rough when working, so this is understandable. i take a small amount of super glue and repair them and keep going with no problem, they are very comfortable. i recommend them to friends and family"
4.0,"This product was oddly sewn together across the chest and was pulling in the strangest of areas. The length was perfect, as were the sleeves. I loved the look, and it fit great. I tried stretching out the chest part in the oddly sewn section and after a while the fabric gave way to looking appropriate. I felt nicely covered in the chest though, and the west was nice and stretchy too!"
4.0,cute dress. I love it. a little short for me though.
4.0,"Super cute, love the cut of the dress. The fabric gets hot in humid weather but it’s pretty. The ties are a bit high in the neckline so it makes it hard to get your head through. The are knotted so it’s not easy to re-lace but ultimately not a huge problem."
4.0,"This was the only kids size in this hat which was why this was purchased. The fit was perfect, but the ears were off. Stuck out a little too far and were really flimsy. Luckily I can sew and with a few stitches are much better."
4.0,Cute but this is very transparent so you will need something under it. Not great quality but I am ok with that for this price.
4.0,im a 34DD top was ok but bottom was a bit big not too much. over all its wearable
4.0,The picture is not the same at the ones I got. You need to update it.
4.0,Great summer casual dress.
4.0,"The black one it a bit bigger then the white one which I hadn't realized, but that was on me for not looking into a bit more. Other then that really good. My friend loved it too which is the most important thing since it was a birthday gift haha"
4.0,"Sizes were good and as ordered, the material is titanium indeed, the balls is secured tightly so I'm not afraid I'll lose them, I only wished the silver color was a bit more shiny, I understand titanium is not as ""polished"" or overly shiny as other materials but they look a bit too dull in my opinion, nonetheless good piercings and great for the price."
4.0,"You will need a nude slip, it is thin and shows every line."
4.0,colorful for the right person
4.0,Runs large so i got a full size smaller and they are too narrow now. I am stretching them out because they're sooo cute.
4.0,exact fit as expected
4.0,Actually not bad for the price. The quality is fair and all parts fit together with no hitch. Pretty sturdy also. The only complaint I have is I couldn't saved some time with some instructions. Cmon I just paid a load of money and you guys can't include some assembly instructions?<br />Took 40 minutes to put together
4.0,Cute but it does not stay in place when you move. You have to keep fixing it. Nice for taking pictures.
4.0,"I am very particular about my black tops. The lace around the mesh and the whole top, in general, are not a true black but a very dark gray but are a blue/purple undertone. I am pretty sure I will have to redye it after a few more washes. Its a bit stiff overall and the mesh has a plastic feel to it. It is work appropriate for me and doesn't show too much boob if I wear a camisole under it."
4.0,"heavy weight, sturdy, pretty"
4.0,Love this too. It is a little shorter than it appears on the model but true to size.
4.0,Not as long as the photo indicated
4.0,"This watch winder works extremely well and it is not expensive at all.  It isn't the most glamourous looking, but it does the job.  Ordered another one for my brother-in-law."
4.0,"It was cute, a nice weight material, and fit correctly"
4.0,This was sooo gorgeous on my niece my only issue was the pearls were hot glued on and some were coming off. It got the job done... cute photos (i covered her face) hope this helps
4.0,"This was pretty and good fit but short on torso. .i would order again if tall was an option. Otherwise,  nice suit.. happy"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:b4bbc2943c7e1a3ac84d6f46d1ae558d]] I liked it, but it was a little snug. I am 5'4"" and i wear a XL petite. Weight about 180 lbs now;) it has no pockets its cute fuzzy soft i wish i was a little longer on the legs to cover my ankles over more."
4.0,My typical issue is how long these last. As much as I use them if they get pass 6 months I will raise to 5 stars.
4.0,"This hat is awesome! My son wouldn't let me take any pictures of him in it, but he truly loves it.<br />Pros:<br />Soft and warm.<br />SUPER easy to connect to a phone. (He accidentally threw away the directions, but as soon as he turned the hat on, he saw it on his phone screen to connect to Bluetooth, so easy peasy connected!)<br />Long battery life.<br />Easy to charge.<br />Easy to operate while you're wearing it.<br />Insanely bright light.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Even at low volumes, others can somewhat hear the music outside of the hat.<br />It's a little big at the top; no one's head is that long.<br />Somewhat tricky to get the battery in and out, but that's not really necessary because there's a hole so you can charge it while it's still in place.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic hat and at $20 (the price at the time of this review), it's a steal!"
4.0,"I'm size 8, big butt and somewhat small chest . hips fit perfectly fine but chest part is big....like if I swim the suit jiggles under the water but overall cute looking suit"
4.0,I love the material and softness of it.  Perfect for dressing up or casual.
4.0,Fits great except sleeves are a bit too short
4.0,Christian!  He loves it!!
4.0,very cute and fun. well made
4.0,Bought the costume got my daughter and loved it do much that I debated getting a 2nd 1 for myself
4.0,It is really fluffy but it sheads quite a bit !!!
4.0,"The medium fits true to size, and it's a relaxed, comfortable fit with very soft material. It works well with a traditional bra or with exercise attire. I like it and plan to wear it through the warm months. It isn't overly sheer either. Sorta like a lightweight t-shirt in thickness. 95% cotton and 5% spandex."
4.0,Little ones just love these dresses and they look great but the fabric isn't really the best fabric which explains why they were so affordable I guess... These do make greqt birthday party dresses though.
4.0,"Update 2019: I lost weight and went down a size, but the fit in the waist/thigh for the smaller pair was different in the last 4 pair. The mocha and white (the latter also being see through) fit a little snug but good, the black was a tad looser and the burgundy had to be the next size up. I will hope that my reorders go well otherwise Ive got to find a new near perfect brand. I’m not looking forward to that<br /><br />This purchase turned out so well I bought 2 more in the other colors. They fit well but not tight. The crotch length or rise is perfect. I don’t mind the semi stretch fabric because it gives enough to move but doesn’t sag. My only compliant is that I wish they were a .5 to 1 inch longer. I’m heavier in the thigh area which catches the pants in a way that make them look shorter. I can fix that though. I took away a star because I need an alteration."
4.0,because i like to play princess and pearls are very necessary for this purpose..  i like this bracelet. its cute and affordable and looks great with my pink dress
4.0,"Looks awesome,Granson is gonna love it!"
4.0,Great for what I wanted.  I anticipate using them a good deal.
4.0,Very nice. It lacks of coin storage.
4.0,"the pink color is so cute & vibrant!! the skirt is a little baggy on the top area of the skirt, but it's easy to finesse since it has a ruched look!"
4.0,SIZE is so off I had to get a xl and I wear a Small but the quality is great so if u want it so 2 sizes up
4.0,Really like this bracelet bought this one to replace one I had years ago good quality good design
4.0,"Super cute on. Light weight, washed up very nice and didn't wrinkle."
4.0,Didn't quite hang as I hoped.  Returned it.  But nice fabric and would be cute in a larger size.  I ordered Large and I'm 5'5&#34; 170.
4.0,purchased for dance recital.  Will work fine
4.0,Really like the gloves! The seam is a little weird so grabbing things can be a little hard but they are comfy and perfect for cosplay and costumes
4.0,This is more casual than I was expecting. The neckline in particular keeps this from looking dressier. The model shows a more draped look that probably requires you to size way up (or be a size 2 to start with). It didn't look at all like it does on the model but it is S0 comfortable and soft that I'm happy with it. I work in a casual office so this works for me. The buttons on the arms help make it more work appropriate and black work pants will dress it up. I normally wear a size large in shirts and this is a large.
4.0,it’s pretty ! the chain is pretty thick and long though so just check measurements before purchasing ! it’s not a small dainty one like i thought it was going to be . cheap quality but you get what you pay for !
4.0,"I go through a lot of cords like this in my jewelry business, but I usually make them myself by buying a spool of rat tail and attaching the crimp ends myself.<br /><br />This takes a lot of time and while I usually sell them for $2 (a cheap add-on for a nicer pendant), it's a time consuming way to make a profit. So I saw these and figured I would order them.<br /><br />I haven't opened the package yet (I'm working my way through my current stock of neck cords), but it's a clear bag and you can see what you have here. So as far as I know the clasps are adequate but I have not checked them yet.<br /><br />The cord is a lesser quality than the craft store version. I guess you could say it is not as well compacted. Rat tail is made up of a core surrounded by a lot of thin polyester fibers that until now I hadn't given much thought to. I guess they use some kind of sizing or glue to hold the fibers in place, maybe also heat fuse them together a little?<br /><br />These ones are more free-floating so there are wisps that will easily snag on a jump ring.<br /><br />I will try running them over a candle flame to see if that helps keep them from fraying on my customers. I don't want to get a bad reputation from these. If that doesn't work (sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't with other rat tail) I'll reuse the clasps and replace them with the craft store stuff.<br /><br />Rating this 4 stars for now. If I have trouble with this I will come back and adjust the rating and update my review. If you are reading this and it's been a month or longer, then assume the clasps are good and the candle trick worked."
4.0,These were the softest pants ever but I’m 5’3” and they were incredibly long on me. I’m very sad they didn’t work out. The waistband also comes up very high. I’m sure they’d fit nicer if you are a bit taller than I am.
4.0,The shirt is cute it didn't work out for me but the seller was very helpful and offered a 30% refund.
4.0,Looks Great.  Easy to install
4.0,"I haven't washed them yet, but out of the package they seem to be well made, comfortable, & sturdy.  Soft and thick.  Might be too warm for summer.  Slightly big, but I do a figure 8 with the ear piece to make masks come down further from the eyes.  Nice feature of fabric under the chin to keep the mask from riding up."
4.0,They’re smaller then expected the one for your septum was to bug on me and the hole on one of them is very very small so idk how it will fit but I’m wearing one of them in a picture and it looks alright
4.0,IT IS GOOD TO THE WINTER WARM PRODUCT.
4.0,"Very cute tutu, it hangs more like a skirt so it was too long for my 4-5year olds but the stars are such a cute touch!"
4.0,Love having the ear plugs attached and the back clip instead of elastic.  Clip is a little awkward but that's probably me having to get used to it. Leaves a little mark but doesn't have to be too tight to create a seal.
4.0,Super comfy except the part that goes in between your toes rubs and hurts after a while but if you're just lounging around and not doing a ton of walking around the house then they're fine. I bought these for a spa night and I wanted to have comfy slippers on but still be able to see my freshly pedicured toes so they were perfect :)
4.0,"It works well, does its job. I just wish it looked better."
4.0,These are much bigger than they look. I wanted something daintier. But guess that I'd my fault. They are cute though.
4.0,"No complaints for the price, light weight, comfortable to wear, work well , it's plastic, but it is ok for me, will buy buy more"
4.0,I just received my order and they look nice and are very comfortable. I haven't used them a lot yet but I look forward to doing so.
4.0,"He is big and tall and I bought these for him. He only wears the boxer briefs now. That was because the leg holes are too big in briefs and the opening in the front of the boxers is too big. Either way, if you get one or the other, something shows. I don't want to see it. With the boxer briefs, I don't have to. These are the best things ever made. Wonder if a woman designed these?"
4.0,Besides being super right I Love it
4.0,"They are made to fit snug, but my son didn't complain about them being too tight.  He said he was a little warm when wearing them under clothing, but didn't bother him enough to refuse to wear them."
4.0,Straps fit well on small heads.
4.0,"Comfortable to wear, not too heavy. Comes loose easier than I thought it would."
4.0,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my 5 year old. She loves it! It's very cute for a little girl and small enough that it doesn't dwarf her little body, but big enough to hold all her necessary items. We put a little comb and brush, chapstick, a small coin purse, sunglasses, and a few other items in it for her and now she feels so grown up going out with me to the store or wherever.<br /><br />The reason I rated it 4 stars is because the strap is way too long and it's not very durable. I shortened the strap by cutting it and sewing it. It was easy to do. But the strap also got caught and my daughter pulled on it and broke the little link that holds the strap right off of the purse. I sewed it back on and reinforced the other side, so hopefully it will not happen again. It's just not really high quality materials, but still fine for a little girl to play with."
4.0,"Was shorter than expected, not quite making knee height, otherwise is a great sock and does the compression job."
4.0,I just got my bracket yesterday I love it ! So pretty for only 2 dollars .its a little small on the wrist but I love the design and the shine.
4.0,"I want to love them. But they're just too uncomfortable. The material is stiff and not soft, so it squeezes my big nose. Look awesome though."
4.0,They snapped right in!  One felt kinda loose.  Seems to be ok now and hasn’t fallen out.  It’s like having bring new glasses in a 10 year old pair of Oakley’s !
4.0,This is very nice. Although it is a snug git
4.0,"the shirt looks exactly as the picture. I ordered a medium, I'm 5'8&#34; and id like the shirt to be a little longer but overall if fits well. I received this product at a discount in return for my honest review."
4.0,"I liked the dress but it was kind of sheer, so I returned it."
4.0,"I really wanted this to be a cute warm-up set that I could wear around the house, and maybe even wear outside for grocery shopping or errands.  But it is lightweight for Colorado, more like a pair of pajamas...other than it is not forgiving enough around my middle.  The shirt comes down low enough and clings enough that I would have to ""suck in my gut"" at all times for it to be attractive...on me, at least.  So, I did send it back.  To get an idea of fit, my pictures show me in the size medium.  I am 5'6"", 130 pounds, usually wear a size 8."
4.0,"I like it very much, my long runs are a lot better because of this vest!"
4.0,"These were a liiiitle tough to get on the first time but after that, they were great. I'm 5,4'', 185 lbs. Backside is average; these were squat-proof! They are nice and thick and yet you forget you're even wearing them after a couple minutes. These are VERY high-waisted, coming up to my bra. I am short though."
4.0,"Runs big, but are the perfect accompaniment for the Joules rain boots."
4.0,"It is small. Just right for the cell, wallet, car keys and lipstick."
4.0,Very soft material very pretty just a bit small but not too small would size up in this
4.0,Arms could be bigger.  shrinks in wash.  wish I would have ordered a size larger.
4.0,"I got these gloves as a sale item and was overjoyed when they arrived. We a currently experiencing blizzard conditions and these gloves do the trick. Going from car to building, like church, they are warm and very classy. I would not recommend them for playing winter sports."
4.0,Looks great. Good material. Fits well
4.0,"There nice, just wish the lens were darker"
4.0,"they look really small, like baby small, but they fit very well on my feet (I use Woman 6 shoes), they look very nice for the price"
4.0,Shirt is a bit small for 2t
4.0,Too long to wear comfortably
4.0,A nice looking pair of shades. I was highly impressed when I received the glasses.
4.0,"A little small for my size 10, but still like them.  Great deal overall."
4.0,"Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend at his request. Packaged nicely, looks like great quality. Made well & seems like it will last for a while. His only complaint is the coin pocket. He says it adds unnecessary bulk to an other wise great product."
4.0,I didn't dislike the product I just needed to return two
4.0,Not exactly as bright in color as the pictures but they are really cute
4.0,I was skeptical about how this would fit but I'm happy that I decided to go for it. Love the fit!!! I'm ordering another one in a different color.
4.0,The elastic stretched out pretty quick but it still has the ear loops. It’s really cute and I’m so glad it came with filters. The material is soft.
4.0,This is good for the money.
4.0,"Not perfect, but not a piece of junk either. Comes in a small box, indicating it being manufactured in China. Fur is genuine. Not the nicest piece I've bought. I'd say it holds a retail value of between $35-45. So, it's pretty much right what you'd expect for $50. It comes with like 16 small button loops sewn onto the edges of the satin liner, as well as buttons to match, presumably to you could attach it to a hood or collar, for the purpose of having a removable fur piece."
4.0,"So here's some helpful hints about this sweater  that I did not know when I bought it. No tags in it, looks to be a homemade sweater. Came in a zip lock bag. Turned the sweater inside out to show knitting seams. Not a big deal to me, but I thought I was buying a store item. It is see through, which I did not know. No biggie.... I'll wear a tank under it. I order a XXL as I am a size 14/16 pants with broad shoulders and a good size width around my breast area. Over all happy with my purchase. Just thought I share these details."
4.0,"good deal, thanks.."
4.0,i have owned this watch for 2 years now... its still running like a champ!
4.0,"got here on time, fits a bit snug, but ok.  Using for hiking.  Worked well on a misty day hike."
4.0,Gloves fit OK<br />did not remember to check where they are from; nothing of origion posted on the box (at least printed in English)<br />all information on the back of the box is printed in Oriental graphics.
4.0,"A nice roomy bag, great color. I was just hoping for a softer feel to the leather."
4.0,It's a little bigger than expected and size 9 is bigger than the store. Still pretty though.
4.0,So pretty!! I wear it everyday!
4.0,"Really cute, but it's a bit tight on me."
4.0,The dress fit really cute.I added a black belt and wore black and white accessories. The only thing is be careful with your bra because if it has lace or patterns you can see it through the dress. Just stick with a plain dark colored bra and you'll be fine.
4.0,"I really like this jacket - but I can't use it.  I measured very carefully and ordered per the chart provided (XL), but it runs small.  I could squeeze into it, but if I were to zip it it would be very uncomfortable.  I would have exchanged if for a XXL, but the shipping time indicated it would be over a month to receive that size, so I ended up ordering a different product with a shorter lead time."
4.0,Not something i wear everyday. I bought them for the 4th. But other then that they're great.
4.0,This one came in as pictured very good quality.
4.0,Like this item.  Kangaroo pocket comes in handy.  Wish it were a bit heavier fabric. More sweatshirt material. This is thinner.
4.0,"This watch is definitely an athletic, rugged looking watch, yet the watch gets many compliments on how nice it looks too. For the price there is non better, HANDS DOWN!"
4.0,"It wasn’t what I expected…,but I like it, it wears well and made a statement..for the cost you can’t go wrong."
4.0,Very comfortable! Hands always stay warm! Only problem is my hands feel like size 15 shoes are on them when the hand cover is pulled over. Too baggy but a great glove!
4.0,"This is cute and my son loves it.  The zipper is a bit chinsy though and is hard to zip.  I'm afraid it will give out in time, and it is too &#34;tricky&#34; for my son to zip himself."
4.0,"The product meets expectations, arrived quickly and is accurate to the description page. Great price point for what you get and the magnetic clasp works great and secures strong because once connected you can slide to secure."
4.0,"It's a charming little bag but not what I know to be satin, which is smooth and shiny.  The material in this bag is not smooth and shiny.  The back has a very subtle pattern which seems to shimmer slightly, and the front really IS woven of a similar but not shimmery gathered material.  It takes my iPhone 6s plus with a case on it but very little else, but without the phone it will take smallish items easily.  There is a card pocket inside, and a chain strap.  The closure is a silver-colored base metal with a floral and crystal decoration.  It's fine for evenings out and proms and some weddings, but not good enough for super formal occasions as it will look cheap compared to other more expensive bags.  For the price I paid, it looks pretty good."
4.0,Love the shoe. Only down part is that it's heavy like full size boots!
4.0,"This is a very nice, well put together night gown. I love the pockets and the v neck. My only complaint is the material is little heavy and while that's great for fall and winter I'm worried about summer. We will see."
4.0,"This suit is okay, but it's definitely made for a smaller girl. It fit, but it cut into my legs and made my thighs look like a couple of sausages! Cute suit, just not for me."
4.0,I like this chain.  Very pretty.  Seller sent it right away.  Actually got it before the rest of my Amazon direct order.
4.0,Very cute but for just a little bit smaller than listed/expected.
4.0,Looks great until you get close up.  Pretty to wear but a I wish the links were smaller.  The larger links makes the chain look cheap.
4.0,"This dress is subtly sexy. Kind of Jane of Tarzan meets, Carmen Sandiego, meets spa robe. I bought this dress in an XL, but am returning it for a size L. I'm 5'6'' 180lb, athletic build, big hips, narrow waist, 34D. I bought a deep plunge bra to go with this dress because of the reviews. The neckline on this dress IS DEEP. The deep plunge bra I bought wasn't deep enough. I was considering sewing the neckline a little bit, but thought maybe the size down would help with this.<br /><br />The open waist is not obvious while standing or walking, but a strong breeze would definitely split this wide open. I'm thinking a pair of nude slip shorts would be alright for this. The waist is really stretchy, mainly for he gathered look. I would go a size down from what you think.<br /><br />This dress is not for the modest."
4.0,"The dress, seems to be junior size. I usually get medium size, but this was little tight fight. I would recommend to buy a next higher size. But overall the quality is good for the price. It is kind of evergreen fashion, the strap denim. I like it"
4.0,So far like wish it had magnet instead of pin
4.0,Just like the pic cotton t-shirt and comfy.  My daughter liked it so I brought her one too.
4.0,"It’s a one size fits all but I’m a healthy girl and it’s big on me. I am 5’7, 156 pounds with a 36d chest and I can still swim in it. However it’s beautiful. It’s the best looking one I have found. It’s very nicely made and much better priced than everyone I have tried. So I took it to the seamstress and had her take off 3 inches each on both sides. Seamstress are cheap so don’t let tat scare you. It only cost $7. So it’s still better priced than other cover ups. Now it’s beautiful and has the sexy fit like on the photos. Love this beach cover up."
4.0,No issues.  I am 6' 3&#34; and weight 200 lbs. and the XL fits just fine.  I wish they had a drawstring but that is probably just my preference.<br /><br />Not going to give 5 Stars because I have only worn them once and durability is not yet known.
4.0,"Love the bag, but I gave it 4 stars because I didn’t like the velcro closure and it was a little too small."
4.0,just turns lights yellow.
4.0,I love the fit of dress as it hugs the right areas. Thick enough fabric. Color held true even after a few washes.
4.0,"My son wears this to school and it helps him keep his hands to himself, as he fidgets with this instead. We call it his focus necklace."
4.0,"Cute sweater, but runs a little big."
4.0,"Band and cups run small, but with a few extenders, it can be extremely comfortable, and creates very dramatic cleavage and push up support."
4.0,"The bracelet is beautiful. I really like it, however, it is a little tighter than I thought it would be, but is still comfortable. I wear it all day and take it off at night. I am feeling less joint pain after 3 days of use and anticipate further relief as I continue to wear it."
4.0,"I ordered this Casual Short for my dad as a father's day gift and he absolutely loved it.<br />The size and color were as expected. It has an elastic waist with drawstring including<br />2 back pockets, 2 cross pockets and 2 side box pockets that can be used for wallets and other items as well."
4.0,"Great quality, just a little loose when I put them on."
4.0,It has a little more poofiness than I thought it would. But love the color. Many compliments.
4.0,"I passed these off to a friend, who likes them a lot. They are comfortable and the cups are all easily washable."
4.0,Really great fabric
4.0,"Cute dress, but it was just not the right shape for my body. It on the hunt to find something similar!"
4.0,Nice quality and good cut. Holds up nicely to washing and beating from early crawler. This is the second item have purchased from them and love how well they hold up and keep their color.
4.0,Nice...a little large
4.0,"This shirt fit swimmingly, I found it to be very comfy and enjoyed wearing it for wherever I go.  I recommend it to anyone.  The only downside that made me give the shirt a 4 instead of 5 is that the collar feels tight when laying down in which leading to a choking effect."
4.0,"These are the 4th brand of these types of liners/socks that I have tried and they are by far the best! All of the other brands I got from Target and they all slipped off my heels almost immediately. The most expensive pair (from champion) fell off the fastest. I'm only giving these 4 stars because ONCE I did have to put the sock on my right foot back on. But that was over an hour after wearing them! And to be fair, my right foot is smaller than my left foot, so that's not surprising. These socks/liners are probably twice the thickness of any of the other brands I've tried. I could tell that before putting them on. Love the bright colors and am so happy to have finally found a sock/liner that works so I can wear my cute new shoes! Highly recommend these!"
4.0,"The swimsuit was nice, ans fit pretty well. My only issues with it were its purple, not as red as it shows in the picture, and the cups in the top made it weird ro wear. I cut out the bra piece inside the top and it fit much better."
4.0,"The size is definatly off.  I usually wear a med, after reading the reviews i bought an xl.  Fits great.  It's way shorter than in the photo and the sleeve colors are a bit different than pictured. Happy with product, just glad I read the reviews first."
4.0,"I think it was made pretty good, like the way it is put together, but could have been just a bit longer. would have liked to have seen real tourquise in front but then this was very cheep price for  what I got. I am happy with it"
4.0,"I wanted a bohemian-ish purse, but not one that screamed &#34;I'm a hippie!&#34;  This one fit the bill perfectly.  The embroidery on the outside looks good, with muted colors in a pattern which reminds me of purses I'd see back in the 70's without being too &#34;old&#34; looking.  The purse is a decent size-- enough to fit a wallet, small brush, phone, and other small essentials.  Inside the purse the material is like thin canvas or sort of burlap looking, and the stitching on the inside seems like it could weaken but I don't know that for certain yet.  The zipper on the inner pocket misaligned, or came apart while zipped, as I was examining the purse but after zipping it back and forth once or twice it seems okay.<br /><br />(It was purchased as a gift, so I can't say anything about what it's like to use day-to-day.  I'll have to ask the recipient for her observations after she's used it for a while.)<br /><br />My impression is that this purse looks nice, but I don't know if it would stand up to the rigors of everyday use by busy women."
4.0,"Got tons of compliments! I'm 5'6 and bra size is a 34D, I ordered Medium and the length was perfect but it was tight around the chest area. I unbutton the first button and my chest area felt better. Hoping it doesn't shrink after the first wash. Super cute and good quality... so far."
4.0,"I like this dress! The material is pretty thin, but not see-through. I don’t like the extremely long ties on the side, but that is an easy fix with some sewing. The color is unexpectedly pretty. I think I will really like this in the summer, which is what I got it for!"
4.0,It's ok I mean it does it's job . The thing I like most is it's not all big & bulky wearing out my neck . It's a small chain & I'm ok with that .
4.0,"I normally wear an 8-10 Medium,  ordered the large, I'm gkad I did. Still a shade small, but not bad. Very cute dress."
4.0,"Thanks to everyone else who posted a review I ordered the size I needed.  They do run a bit small, so if you have hips you may want to order one size up from your regular size.  The mesh liner was a must for me and the fabric held up well.  They are comfortable and the cargo pocket really came in handy when I went to the water park.  I liked them so much that I ordered another color.  I only gave it four stars because of the sizing issue."
4.0,I have had my piece for about 3 weeks and it is showing wear on the back and edges turning a copper looking color. I do not get this wet or wear it in the shower so we will see how far it turns color but what do you expect for the price. I think it is a nice pendent except for that.
4.0,"This retro dress is made with a heavy cotton/poly blend.  It does have some stretch and it is more a forest green than an emerald green.  I ordered a size up as many had suggested and the dress fits nicely.  It hugs my curves and then flares out.  I deducted one star because the dress would have been perfect with lining.  If you are top heavy, you are going to need a good bra."
4.0,"Great as a car coat but if you want something for very cold weather, this is probably not the coat for you.  Worked well for what I needed but glad it wasn't really cold.  Well made."
4.0,"So this is another one of those things that look better than they do on the computer. The shoe fit me rather nicely, tho i would warn people with wide feet to order a wide width size. The shoe is absoloutely wonderful but some of the paper on the heel looks like it's about to peel off. What's up with that Amazon?"
4.0,"Very cute, bought as a gift for my mother so i was a bit disappointed that one of the poles was bent in the bag they sent it in. We were able to fix and she loves them."
4.0,"I can't say much, yet, because it's a gift, but we got the product on time, and it's an upgrade from what she is expecting."
4.0,I got the dress for a wedding. I got lots of compliments. I pulled the sleeves to my shoulders for the ceremony (in a chapel) and I pulled it lower ( as shown ) for the reception.
4.0,Metal rings for drawstring ripped out in first couple of days. Very comfortable though
4.0,As described. Fit great
4.0,"it's pretty, but the center ring stone is huge, so not very believable as genuine.  Still, it has a lot of sparkle!"
4.0,"I really like this hat, good fit and very warm"
4.0,"I like the band, but it was too short, and I had to contact Speidel for some expansion links ($3.99 shipping charge).  Speidel was very cordial and the free extra links arrived within a few days.  My wrist is only around eight inches in circumference, so I didn't think I would need anything larger than the largest size band on the website, but the real world caught me again."
4.0,"for the price i didn't expect much but it is really cute, and so far, keeps great time, find myself reaching for it to wear more than I thought... cute!"
4.0,"I received this tank top in the snakeskin print. It looks stylish when worn with jeans or black slacks. It has a low cut, plunging neckline. The thin straps are adjustable for fit and comfort. Because the straps are so thin, this looks best when worn with a strapless bra. This top is made of a very thin material that is on the sheer side. It has a loose fit around the waist."
4.0,"Super cute and fun.  But if you're ordering these for a man I would order a size up.  These would also work as ladies lounge pants; I wouldn't say they're exclusive to men.  In fact, I ordered them for my sister.  For ladies, order your regular size."
4.0,Fits well and looks terrific! Lightweight and easy to breath through.
4.0,exactly as pictured... colors are good.  the quality is on the cheap end but much better than you'd expect for the price.
4.0,"Wish the lapis had more color variation, but the blue was lovely"
4.0,"Nice fabric,  heavy weight. Perfect for Fall and Winter Sundays."
4.0,"These are great for babies and toddlers. They lasted a good while, these are nice but the headband and bows don't really match but they're useable and nice."
4.0,"The watch band is great quality and looks slick. The band matches the buckle color, a nice detail.<br /><br />I knocked off a star because the silicone around the pin is way too thick for my watch and pops out, whereas i have no problems with other strap brands. Unfortunately i am returning."
4.0,I love this dress!! I ordered a large because I wanted it to be fitted. The only problem is girls with big bust like me will have a problem with the straps revealing too much.
4.0,I love the style of these pants with the drawstring on the waist. They are not made  thick fabric but don't let that fool you. They're soft and they will still keep you warm. They're a tiny bit long in the leg. One style has pockets and a different style does not. I like having the pockets more.
4.0,Slightly larger then I expected
4.0,I got this in a medium. 34-D 29 inch waist. 5 foot two 125lbs. It was skin tight but looks just as pictured. Nice soft material.  Then I bought it in an XL so I could wear it to work. The XL pattern was shifted and the white portion was not centered. XL fit looser and safe for work. I would SIZE up 1-2 if you don’t want it skin tight. If you like it to fit skin tight order your size. Great product. Really soft and comfortable.
4.0,"Nice, easy to wear dress.  I'm tall (5'11&#34;) and so the waist sat higher on me but the &#34;midi&#34; length came right above my knees, which was exactly what I wanted.  A very bright blue.  Will prob re-order in black too."
4.0,"I like them,Ive tried shrinking but thats not happening,I still wear them tho.I just know to get small next time.lol"
4.0,Very Fitting. our little one likes them very much.
4.0,"I’ve had them over a year now and literally never take them off. It is true some of them will eventually come undone over time, but as a 24/7 wearable it feels worth it. Plus, customer service has replaced a few for me."
4.0,"Decent quality leather belt, made of thick material that matches jeans. Mine is a little short. It says 32, but it doesn't fit my son who takes a 32. Perhaps the total length is 32"", rather than longer to fit a 32 inch waist.  Nice belt, though."
4.0,Somewhat large. good buy for the price
4.0,I like the eyewear; the frame color is not as vivid as pictured.
4.0,I love sports bras and these are cute and fit well.
4.0,"Charming necklace. Can wear in the shower, no problem. The only issue I had is with the chain. Although I LOVE the look and feel of the chain, it gets caught on my long hair and sweaters. I'm bummed that I had to change out the chain, but I still really love my sea turtle."
4.0,"My baby loved this and would not hold still or want to take it off this material is very comfortable on her the green material is made of this semi latex fell and the pink part seems to be a little bit of cloth this was a big hit and she was the center of attention because it's just so cute this looks very small once you receive it but this fit my niece who is 12 months and my 3 year old  which is a good age range but then again it does go by each individual body, I gave this 4 stars because of the cloth since I was expecting all swimwear but this is way cute for photo shoots and bbq or summer parties so cute.<br /> I hope this helps you out, if so please click YES! Lol thank you for your time it is greatly appreciated.<br /><br />* I did receive this at a discount for my honest opinion *<br /><br />Jetzali"
4.0,"This is a great shoe. This is my 3rd pair - and I finally managed to think about to order online. I still have pair 2 to use in the yard, while this pair I use in the gym. Good support, doesn't roll on me."
4.0,"I am female, my head is on smaller side, and these fit great and I like the look.  The sides (temples) are flexible.  Like others have commented, they do fog up."
4.0,"gets rusty very quickly, smells weird if you get it wet once. but i loved it for a long time."
4.0,bought this as  a gift for my daughter-in laws 11 year old sister and the feed back that I got was that she loves it and wears it everday. so i can only say good product worth the money!
4.0,This backpack is durable but the color is a bit darker than the picture
4.0,"The top fits great, but the bottoms are a bit large. True to picture."
4.0,The 6 and 3/4 inches is the sole of the slippers.  They are a little bigger because FLUFFY and CUTE and SUPER SOFT.<br /><br />Plus they have that whole UNICORN thing going on.<br /><br />I would have understood the sizing better if I had seen the 26-27.  Live and learn.
4.0,Nice colors!!
4.0,Comfortable dress.  Could be cheaper.
4.0,"The watch looks nice and arrived working. I liked it. The only caveat is the band is quite short. Only one notch to spare on my average sized wrist. If you have a larger wrist, the band would not fit."
4.0,"Very soft leather, just what I had hoped."
4.0,These are very cute:  very thin fabric so nice for summer.  The lace on the bottom is very nice but I think it would curl up easily after washing/drying.  They are too long for my height so I reluctantly returned them.
4.0,"Good lenses, but just a bit TOO oversized.  I'm keeping them anyway!"
4.0,I wanted to give it a 5 but because they are so tiny and smaller that on the model on the pic I gave them a 4
4.0,"Beautiful and elegant ring, love it!"
4.0,"I am 5’9” 180lbs 36/38B chest and have this in the Large.  The material is standard swim style, the coloring is really pretty.  The fringe isn’t annoying as I though it would be.  The back of this is completely open with only a small string closure at the back.  If you don’t like your back showing then this isn’t for you.  The leg openings are high cut so if you are all natural your hair will show.  Overall, this is a cute and well made suite but not something I would want to wear at my local swimming spot, at home no problem."
4.0,"For the price I loved this necklace my granddaughter ordered it, the quality and beauty were so surprising for the cost I would have never ordered it because of that cheap price now it's one of her Christmas presents."
4.0,"I bought these a few months after my carpal tunnel surgeries when I planned to go from team driver to solo driver, and would no longer have my co-driver doing the hand-intensive stuff for me. They are one of my favorite pairs of gloves. They are super grippy, but also very flexible. I have had other gloves that had a nice outer surface, and were fine for things that required my whole hand (e.g. fueling), but were so stiff for doing anything that required finger dexterity (e.g. pressing the unlocking lever to close my knife) that I would have to take them off to complete the task.<br /><br />These aren't very thick, and don't have any padding to add warmth, but are very comfortable for using day-to-day. Under the grippy surface, they use a nice material that reacts normally to grime and moisture (a previous pair of another brand of gloves that I bought exclusively for fueling weirdly turned ICY COLD if they got a drop of diesel on them! These do not.). I haven't had any need to wash these, but they seem like they would be more washable than many other pairs of gloves I have had.<br /><br />The rubbery surface rips relatively easily, but I kind of think the way it only partially covers the inner glove is by design. When you get a tear in the rubber, it only affects the one tiny part that was torn, and doesn't spread to the rest, because it isn't really all connected. So don't be disappointed if you get a pair and snag them. I've been using mine daily for months, and even though my first tear happened in the beginning, the gloves are still perfectly functional even now. I don't think it's a flaw. I think they were made that way on purpose. (I uploaded photos of both sides. You can see where some of the rubber has torn, especially on my middle finger, but since the coating is perforated anyway, the tear doesn't spread.)<br /><br />One thing to note: I am a woman, and though my hands are normal-medium sized for a woman, I assumed I would wear a small in these gloves, as I assumed they were really made for men. I bought one pair in small, and one in medium. The small are very tight and uncomfortable, and I would not buy them again. The medium fit perfectly. I ended up buying several more pairs in medium when they went on sale. Love them! (Note, I haven't even opened any of the new pairs yet, as these are still going strong. I read some reviews that said the fingertips wore off, but my fingertips are still intact after months of use!)"
4.0,Not quite as dark as I was hoping for but great fit and look good.
4.0,This shoe fits as expected. The shoe looks just like the picture. Rather comfortable without a &#34;wear in&#34; period.<br />Nice for a daily shoe.
4.0,"Looks great.  It does have a strong smell at first, but it is fading fairly quickly."
4.0,Like this dress. Very pretty one. A bit big in the bust area for the size I purchased but fits lovely everyplace else.  Wish the bust area was a bit more form fitting like the rest of the dress. Overall a nice item to wear anywhere.  Can dress it up or keep it casual.
4.0,"It goes with my  earrings, ring, and necklace and other various blue jewelry.<br /><br />As you probably can tell, I like my jewelry in sets."
4.0,The color is great but it's not for me.  The frame is just too bright for my taste.  I had to return it.
4.0,"One size fits all... Makes long legs a disadvantage for this costume. My daughter had trouble walking because of how the pants fit. She described it ""like my knees were tied together and I couldn't take a full step or it could have ripped the costume"" so she hiked it up to allow for safe walking."
4.0,I bought this package of underwear but some of them are smaller than others well the pouch fits too tight
4.0,"Nice, lightweight camisole."
4.0,Comfortable and pretty well-made. Color as pictured and washes well on gentle cycle and/or hand wash.<br /><br />Bottom line: I’d recommend it
4.0,The product arrived and wonderful and the goods are excellent as you come on the site and advise you to deal with your credibility in the product
4.0,"its a good hat, not that slouchy though, maybe my dome is just big."
4.0,"Great fit, plenty of room in the toe box."
4.0,"Really cute outfit!  Fits pretty much true to size. I’m 5’2” 114lbs 34DD. I say “pretty much” true to size because my chest is large and it is a little snug there. But overall really cute! Not see through, but it’s not the thickest material either. Just no dark undergarments and you’ll be fine!"
4.0,For a 4yo it fits well.
4.0,feather was bent when i received it. Super cute costume wear! The chain does look pretty cheap. Perfect for what I wanted it for.
4.0,"It looks almost black under normal indoor lights. I imagine in the sunlight it would sparkle nicely though, as my flash made it shinier. There also is a logo (which after reading the description I saw that is stated) although I hadn't realized that before due to the pictures not showing it. That was my bad. Other than that: the way the time reads is cool, it feels sturdy, and it arrived sooner than it was supposed to so I'm still pretty satisfied."
4.0,Did not fit my wife
4.0,I wear it everyday.. it's a little bit pointy but that's to be expected with stars
4.0,"These convertible dance tights definitely do the trick if convertible tights are the type needed by the dance studio. And the 2-pack is a great value for the price. They are a bit on the stiffer side, however, and aren't as soft as some other tights I've purchased elsewhere. But on the flip side, my daughter didn't get a rip in them the first time she wore a pair, either, so we've got that as a check on the pro list!"
4.0,"Pretty neat item. It comes as described and I was happy with it. My only complaint would be I gave as a gift and it's basically just wrapped in plastic wrap with a tiny, short description of what the item actually is. A bigger size sticker with a distinct logo and a quick explanation of the product would be cool."
4.0,"They were missing a screw for one of the nose pieces and they're not very well made. I don't think I'd wear them as actual sunglasses, but I needed purple tinted aviators for a cosplay & these will do fine. They look exactly like the picture and the lenses are very, very purple."
4.0,As a size 2 I went with 34 and loved the way it hugged my body! however if comfort over fashion is what your looking for...go one size up.
4.0,The quality is not very good. The threads along the toe holes are coming off in just one wash.
4.0,So soft! Shorter than I thought it would be. I should have gotten a large.
4.0,great shirt for breastfeeding but all the seams started stringing and looks tacky
4.0,"Pocket holes were tight to place hands inside, so I had to pull a little to get them out. Great material."
4.0,"This is a wonderful purse for organizing and staying organized.  I wish it were made of a little classier fabric.  It looks a bit on the cheap side, especially the bright green interior.  But it is well made and keeps me organized.  Good for travel."
4.0,Scrubs and Lab Coat are verry good quality. Size 7 was too big for a 6 year old. But room to grow.
4.0,Cute dress. I wore it with leggings and boots. Nice coverage( I did order a size up as I wanted it to be flowy).  Only problem is its sone kind of polyester blend so it was staticy and clingy when moving around. I should have read the description better.
4.0,"Love the hoodie, just wasnt black, which is what I ordered. But the dark gray is nice too. Very comfy and warm."
4.0,This is exactly what I needed for my pendants! Decent quality for a decent price. Nice!
4.0,Thought it was bigger but I've gotten to like it's daintiness!
4.0,"A kind of awkward length that you cant change,  but still really cute and fun"
4.0,I love the bag! I was thinking of using it for school however the space is small like I have 5 binders and only 3 fit. if you are a  hoarder like me this is not the bag for you. But it's a great traveling bag.
4.0,"Nice material, good fit. Overall a great purchase."
4.0,I usually wear a large but I ordered an extra large by accident and when I got them they feel like a large. There is no way they are an extra large so then they must run small
4.0,"I'm normally a large. However, based on reviews I ordered the XXL. It fit great and I'll be wearing it to my baby shower."
4.0,"Quick delivery, and a very good product."
4.0,Top definitely needs something to fill it but super cute
4.0,"This one I was satisfied with,<br />Thank you"
4.0,The stones are lovely with great fire.  My gripe with these is that the backings are not very good.  I had one fall off while I was sleeping and took a couple days to hunt it down again.
4.0,"First time using them. A little hard to handle , but that could be due to first time use.."
4.0,Couldn't get the phrase I wanted because it was too short even though it is pictured as an option
4.0,"These glasses worked. When I got new glasses they were bigger so I did some research and these glasses would fit. So I ordered and they do work nice. They are to expensive for what they are. $25. I've dropped them and the lens pops out but with determination you can pop them back in. However, they do break. I bought 3 to start with and managed to break all of them. This time I just bought one. I had 3 so that I could keep a pair at work and each of our family cars. I do get sweat build up since it covers your eyes so you have to take them off occasionally to let your eyes dry up."
4.0,Loved the new style fit great
4.0,I bought these for my bf for the gym. They are super great! I only gave 4 stars because they snag easily or the material can lose threads quickly. But he has worn them a lot and they have stood up to constant washing. They also make those back muscles stand out!
4.0,The wonder woman pajamas look like the type of swimsuits worn in the olden days. They are cute though and you could get socks that go up to their knees with the red and white stripes too. Really cute look for a kid and will keep their feet and body warm.
4.0,Is all came in one bag wich was a little annoying and some of the balls were off and alot of them werent in the picture but a lot of them are very pretty and hood quality
4.0,"Loved the colors, liked the fit."
4.0,Material is good and stretchy. Not too lose and not to tight. The lower part is not as tapered as expected but easy fix with a pin. You may get away with a smaller size of you like a tight fit.
4.0,"Nice sweater. Beautiful olive green color. My only complaint is that the fabric pilled after just a few wears. It is still wearable, but there are little balls all over it."
4.0,Extremely thin and delicate. Pretty and silk. Stitching pretty good. Dont think this scarf will last long.
4.0,This shirt is very comfortable.  The fabric is soft and stretchy.  The V-neck is comfortable.  It fits well and can be worn as an everyday shirt.  My only complaint is that it is somewhat snug in the forearm section.  I wish that was looser.
4.0,"It seems like it would be a very cute top. I usually wear medium (5'4"" 125 lbs). but this was very small. Tight in the shoulders, waist and very short.  ."
4.0,It's a super cute dress just a tad more under boob than expected.
4.0,"These were a great value, and the frames were very flexible. The only reason I returned them was because they didn’t look good with my face shape."
4.0,"Buying a couple sizes larger is the perfect thing to do. Pay attention to the size chart numbers! Frustrated that the chemise is a cream color when the text at the top clearly says “...pure white chemise...”. It’s mostly polyester so it won’t bleach. Other than that, it fits ok. Kind of thin & needs a long petticoat."
4.0,Nice dress. Heavier than what I expected. Not too fond of the polyester feel but that's a personal thing.
4.0,Arm ruffles are a little bit big and long but still cute
4.0,They are pretty good. Not much “holding in” but are comfy.
4.0,Purchased for a trip. They luggage worked well and was able to utilize all of them for a 7 day vacation.
4.0,The mermaid tail fit perfect and the quality is very good. But I was disappointed to recieve it 1 week after the supposed delivery date and was not able to surprise my grand daughter on time for her Bday.
4.0,The mm size on the packaging would be helpful. The 12mm is more like 13mm and the 10mm is more like 9mm making the jump from 00g(10mm) to 12mm more difficult than it already is when the sizing is accurate.
4.0,"cute socks, washed many times, still loved by my daughter, soft and comfy"
4.0,"seemed to be exactly as claimed.  use it to improve night vision,"
4.0,"I ordered this shirt in an XXL and it definitely was too big for me.  I am 5'10&quot; and usually wear a size XL top and size 12 pants.  I would say this top probably would have fit me better in my regular size XL.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS TOP<br />1: Cut generous<br />2: Cute neckline<br />3: Easy to take care of<br /><br />WHAT I DO NOT LIKE AS MUCH<br />1: The cowl neck tends to open wide exposing the whole white shirt, instead of just giving a little sneak peak.<br /><br />Overall a cute shirt that would look great alone or with a cute little blazer.  Seeing it is a little big I would recommend ordering your regular size or even one size down.  I purchased this at a special discount in exchange for my review.  I rate it 4 stars based on my personal experience with this product.  I took off on star because the white part shows way more than I would have liked.  If you have smaller breasts that may not be an issue, but for larger breasts the black part does not stay in place."
4.0,"Streamlined a-line workout skirt. Fits pretty decently. I’m taking it on my Costa Rica trip, as I want something that isn’t short to hike in!"
4.0,"Well made, well fitting casual chambray shirt. My husband finds it comfortable, and it looks good on him. Material is a little heavier than some but not hot because it's cotton. Launders well, and if you pull it right away from dryer and hang, it doesn't wrinkle badly."
4.0,Bought for a work bag to tote my laptop and things around. Different style that is really interesting. People always comment on it and ask where I purchased it. Great size and fits my needs.
4.0,wish they were a bit more loose on the top otherwise not bad at all.
4.0,Runs really small . I bought a medium and gave it to my roommate. I bought a large and still too small. I was going to buy an xl but it was out of stock. I did go by the sizing chart
4.0,"I would have given 5 stars, however the timer stopped working after about a month. The heater and fan still work well, I just have to remember to unplug it. Would I purchase again- yes."
4.0,Nice product. A little larger than expected but still very cute.
4.0,"My daughter used it as a bag for summer camp to carry her swim stuff. It's very roomy, has zippers, love it"
4.0,im very happy they came on time.<br />i like most of the designs except one .<br />im using theese for my web piercing its very easy to hide and it won't be as hard to talk as the horseshoe ring  is bigger<br />so overall IM HAPPY I WILL RECOMEND IT WAS VERY CHEAP for 20<br />cant wait to use them<br /><br />btw they are small but its good for hiding (web piercing)
4.0,Great bag! Exactly what I was looking for!<br />I am Very happy with this bag.<br />I can fit my laptop and so much more.
4.0,Fits well. The 1&#34; strap might be better at 3/4&#34;
4.0,Beautiful wallet. Hoping it stays durable.
4.0,"Wife loved them,simple and elegant..."
4.0,"I love the look of this cuff.  The top clips to the ear and I am not accustomed to clip earrings, so I am having to adjust the clip or it can be painful. The look is almost worth the pain."
4.0,Nice shoe but was uncomfortable
4.0,This is a beautiful bag that holds so much! Goes out to dinner too. Love the outside zippers and pouch!<br />I would have given it five stars if it had little metal feet to protect the bottom<br />when I put it down somewhere.
4.0,Love the colors but just not long enough like the band that it came with
4.0,Performed nicely. It was a little warm but when the bugs were bad it was the only thing that saved me from being eaten alive. Well worth the money spent!!
4.0,Quite beautiful and worth it for the appearance alone.  I just got it so I'll wait to see how much of a positive effect it has. Then I'll come back and update to five stars.
4.0,"Very high quality material, but the LARGE was a little tight on me, and large normally fits me perfectly."
4.0,I purchased these to go with child's Halloween costume. The shoes are well made. Fit their perfectly. Were a little difficult to get the straps tighten but once we did they completed their costume.
4.0,I would buy one size down. It’s suppose to be loose but it’s too billowy.
4.0,"I normally wear an XL; ordered an XXL and it was too small in the shoulders/back; the quality is good, and i love the lining... just rather disappointed that I can't wear it; I'll just give it to my granddaughter."
4.0,Didn’t quite reach the ankles of my 66” frame but quite stretchy and comfy after having a baby
4.0,Nice shirt that fits well. The fact that it has spandex in it makes it very comfortable. But in my opinion it's a little too high priced for what it is thus four stars.
4.0,Tiene calidad y está bien hecho
4.0,"excellent belt, but Buckle I did not like I wish they would have Convenient Metal Buckle design"
4.0,LOVE the pattern. Pretty tight. If you are bigger than a 10 US womens size.... probably too small.
4.0,"I bought this dress to wear with leggings and tall boots.  I love the look!  It's colorful, and the pockets are a plus."
4.0,Very nice material but they were too small had to send them back they sent the refund as soon as possible a pleasure to do business with
4.0,"I found a cap sleeve bikini top at a thrift store a few years ago and LOVE it. It covers my shoulders from the sun and is good for more sporty water stuff. So I've been hunting for the perfect top to replace it, as it's threadbare now. That's when an angel delivered this top to my door. I absolutely adore the fit and the style is unique. It pairs well with my standard beach coverup/outfit. It doesn't emphasize that armpit fat that I don't even actually have but seems to show up when I put on certain tops. The neck in the back is higher, too, for added sun protection. The bottoms are tight around the waist and I heard a tearing sound when I pulled them over my hips. But I like a boyshort to hide my curlies because I refuse to shave in order to conform to some beauty standard set by the male gaze, so I won't be wearing the bottoms. They do reveal a bit more cheek (and a secret tattoo from a lost weekend). I'm thinking of buying all of their stock of medium so I never again have to spend days searching for the perfect bikini top.  I gave 4 stars, only because the bottoms are tight. For reference: I'm 5'4"" 153 pounds, 39 y.o. with a build like an Eastern European farm peasant passed down to me from generations of Eastern Euro farm peasants."
4.0,It fits well and it trims your mid section down when you wear it under your clothes. Ireally like the pocket for your phone.
4.0,"I have no clue what ""AAA Rated Zircon"" is, but it makes me smile.<br /><br />Who are we fooling, these are cheap synthesized stones, but who cares, right? They're pretty.<br /><br />The shiny parts shine and the sparkly parts sparkle.<br /><br />The design is good and everything else looks as it should. Nobody will suspect these to be anything but what they are, but I still think they're pretty."
4.0,"It's great, my daughter love it."
4.0,very nice. decent quality for the price and fast delivery'
4.0,These earings are very pretty.
4.0,Earrings keep falling out of my ear
4.0,The sleeves are tight.  The length and chest are fine.
4.0,Ordered for my wifes use. She says that this item is perfect. I'm pleased with the service.
4.0,The graphics on the shirt is very detailed. The material is very thin though so if your looking for something thicker like cotton this is not for you. My son enjoys the shirt and wears it all the time.
4.0,"The material wasn't as soft as we expected and the shipping took MUCH longer than it was supposed to.<br />However, my daughter wears it ALL the time and if she's happy, then I'm happy."
4.0,"Why are the pockets sewn together? There is a small opening as if I'm supposed to pull out the thread or cut it? Size is good according to my measurements, and quality is great, but no pockets?"
4.0,I like the products..but I have only had it a week and the watch stopped running!  Bummer!
4.0,"Comfortable fabric and fits well, conparable with other dresses I tried on in stores but a better deal"
4.0,Color selection kind of boring.  Fit is great!
4.0,Beautiful for summer and very light and breathable. Awesome for summer!
4.0,"seem well made and comfortable, but the instruction sheets that come with them describe the color inserts to use if they seem somewhat large!  if they came with the slippers i didn't see them and am at a loss where they are available."
4.0,It's actually to short
4.0,"Bathing outta this world about it but it's a nice passport holder. Great que qulaity and for the price I would def recommend. Got it for my boyfriend and he really liked it. Loves all the small pocket/compartments for money, credit cards and airline tickets. Very functional!"
4.0,they fit well. they feel comfortable.
4.0,will need to use a pin to hold it in place but otherwise great investment
4.0,I really like this but the neck part is very stiff and after a bit starts to make my neck sore. If they made the donut with a memory foam this would be awesome!
4.0,"This item runs small it was a tight snug fit, I suggest you get a size bigger.  However,  the material was soft and it was comfortable and the color was pretty."
4.0,The problem is a very long time to bring from China
4.0,I am about a size 16 and usually wear a XL or 1X.  After reading EVERY review I ordered the bikini in a XXXL for an upcoming Vegas trip. When I got it it was ADORABLE but WAY too big. I initiated a return and jumped back online to order a size smaller.<br />Due to my travel plans the XXL was not Prime available and I took a chance and ordered the XL. To my delight it fit! The bust cups are a bit awkwardly shaped and gap a tiny amount (I am a DD) but overall it's cute and great quality for the price.
4.0,"These are great shorts. I’m only taking away one star because I had to go through three sets before getting the correct ones. They accidentally sent two different sizes, and then one had a hole in it."
4.0,fit just right- would buy another rbx pants
4.0,"2nd time buying, the first time it snapped from wear and tear? (maybe) at least i know i can continue to purchas"
4.0,"I needed a eyeglass chain since I only use glasses when reading.  It was a pain putting them on and off and keeping track of them.  I even lost a pair of glasses at a garage sale because I left them behind.  I was happy to retrieve them when I noticed I had lost them.....<br />This chain is nice looking, which is why I purchased it.  The ONLY complaint I have, is that the rubber piece that goes on the stem of the glasses didn't hold on one side.  In fact, my glasses slipped off on that side as I was wearing them with the eyeglass chain.  Not good.<br />I had to use the extra pair of rubber pieces that was sent.<br />Worried that if those rubber pieces fail, that I will not be able to wear my eyeglass chain as intended."
4.0,It’s a very good looking face shield and easy to clean but it doesn’t have cover over at the top of the eyebrows. So bacteria can still enter in the small gap between the eye brow and the shiled.
4.0,Good hat - just not quite the style pictured.
4.0,Love this sweatshirt.....warm and cuddly.....cute too.  I originally thought  I needed a large but the medium is really the correct size.
4.0,The pad is a 2 hour pad at best. They are warm down to 40 degrees depending on wind speed. They are fairly straight so if you have a thicker thigh they may not be a good fit. I am 6 foot and 215#. I bought the XL. The thighs are tight but the length is spot on.  Nice value.
4.0,"I ordered 2 different colors, both are very nice and pretty soft. However the smell is horrible, almost like burnt plastic. Washed them twice and now they are perfect!"
4.0,"The shirt is really cute! Soft and looks just like the picture. I ordered a small, it’s a loose fit! Which is fine with me. But not if you want a slimmer fit. I would recommend"
4.0,"good, but little small."
4.0,This is absolutely gorgeous and bought several because it is so unique. One note though is the blue-black one is really a sky blue versus teal. The photo looks teal so took off a star since I would have preferred a more teal detail for the color block but the blue they used is actually still really nice.
4.0,I bought this dress in a small because according to the size chart that was my size. it was too small. I had to buy a medium which fit perfect. the dress is a little on the heavy side when in comes to the material but it's perfect
4.0,"I bought US M/Asia XL. It fits fine. I straddle a US S and M. For reference: I'm 5'2&#34;, 125 lbs, 17&#34; shoulders, 36&#34; bust (30FF/G), 29&#34; waist, 37&#34; hips. Now, I typically fit into a small, but my bust sometimes forces me into a medium. Looking at the provided size chart showed that I would be able to fit into a small if not for my bust. I went with US M because of that, plus I figured its easier to get it tailored if it's too big, and I'm glad I did because it fits my bust perfectly. Had I gone down a size, I would not have been able to button it up. It is a bit loose on the rest of me, but it is tapered so it doesn't look like a tent. For someone of similar proportions too me, but a smaller bust, I would suggest going with a US S/Asia L.  It is a bit sheer (white with dark polka dots), and I would suggest a skin toned bra or a cami underneath. I have not worn it enough to say for wear and tear, but it is light and good for summer."
4.0,"They are nice leggings but I usually wear a small and the small on these were super tight! I had to pull and stretch them and now they aren't so bad, but id recommend sizing up as I think a medium would have been better for me!"
4.0,Granddaughter liked them a lot ! Size runs large.
4.0,I liked this shirt a lot. Bought it mostly for the Sun screen capabilities to use frequently when I mow the lawn or work or play outside.  I've recently bought another one.
4.0,Nice compact wallet. Wasn’t impressed with the magnetic clip. Ended up cutting it off and had a serviceable wallet to meet my needs
4.0,Like the color and material
4.0,"This is a super cute dress. I always order a size large in dresses in the event that I need alterations (for reference--I'm a size 6 and tallish (5'7""). It fits me perfectly, save for a little extra fabric around the armpits. The slip underneath is a tad short, which I think is due to the fact that it is attached to the outer layer of the dress vs being a separate piece. I may get a simple alteration made to the dress to extend the slip. I looked at some of the other reviews prior to purchasing the dress and my advice is: SIZE UP! and you will most likely have good luck like I did."
4.0,grate color
4.0,"Loved the purse part.  Needed something small to hold passport and minimal items while traveling.  The strap is flimsy, almost shoestring-like.  I bought a silver chain at Michael's crafts in the jewelry dept for $3.99 - heavy, rope-like, and swapped it.  Now its perfect."
4.0,The fabric is quite thin but very soft.
4.0,"For the moment I am giving  this bag a 4 🌟🌟🌟🌟 rating because it was just exactly what I wanted, the size is just right, not to big as to where you feel your hauling a boulder on your back, but not that small, so that I couldn't fit my day-to-day crap that I use on a regular basis. Two decent sized pockets for there indeed purpose, I particularly like the two side pockets. And then you get this matching mini zippered bag, big enough to fit all your small individual stuff but not to big as though you feel like your carrying second bag."
4.0,"Got this for my son. They’re a little too tight but we think we’ll just use them for our daughter instead once she’s old enough. They’re cute and he said they’re comfy, just too tight."
4.0,Liked the items but it had horrible odor to it and needed to be washed thoroughly before use..
4.0,"I am knocking one star off for the crazy sizing, but otherwise they are great!! I m a size 6/8 and bought the XL. I think a Large would have fit as well but I don’t like anything too tight. They look great for work, stretchy, comfortable, and have nice detail. Wide waist band and high/mid rise are very flattering as well. Will be buying more colors! I hope they don’t stretch out."
4.0,"The only reason I’m not giving 5 stars is because they have a very odd fit. Skin tight in my calves and legs but a little loose in the waist and hips. I run on my treadmill almost every day and by 6 minutes in I feel the sweat starting. I literally have to peel them off in my bathroom and they are dripping with sweat. I rinse them off in the shower and hang them inside out to dry. I feel like they are going to split apart taking them off, and if that happens I will buy a different brand."
4.0,It's nice; but the side that touches the skin is rather rough.
4.0,My toes  were numb for 3 days after wearing these for about 5 hrs
4.0,"This is a really high end wallet. It's leather is very thick and all of the stitching is very well manufactured.  In the photo the light brown wallet is standing next to a brown box that it comes in - I couldn't figure out what that brown box was when I was shopping for this :)<br />The only reason I am giving this 5 stars is that this wallet is quite bulky. This would be good for carrying in a bag or briefcase, but my husband has a hard time fitting it in his pocket. It's definitely not inconspicuous. Retail sample provided at a reduced price for honest evaluation and review purposes."
4.0,"These folding travel duffels are nicely constructed of quality fabric.  The handle straps are sturdy.  I wish the attached pouch were a little wider, because the handles on my luggage are about 7&#34; wide, a little wider than the opening.  I love the idea of attaching the duffel to the handle, and I hope the company will consider making the opening wider.  Otherwise, it's a very nice bag."
4.0,Anything to do with the Cubs is great.
4.0,Very comfy. I ordered the same dress different colors.
4.0,"These shoes are great...my daughter wore them for camp and was able to swim with them, and participate in water activities at camp. They are also very stylish. Highly recommend!"
4.0,A NEW FAV. CASUAL SPORTS BRA LOOK FROM THE FRONT. SEXYNESS IN THE BACK!
4.0,Shorts roll up on legs and down at waist but are not to tight or to big.
4.0,like the unique design
4.0,"OK, for the price"
4.0,I love the style and size but the lenses aren’t pink like they were supposed to be so kind of disappointed with that
4.0,"These are handy to have around. I have used them for hair ties and key rings. I wouldn't give them as gifts; I was asked to rate their giftability. They really do hold my hair and not tangle it, nor pull it too tight. They seem to be made of a matte texture silicone. Their stretch memory is fair to good."
4.0,There was no pink pair
4.0,Very happy  with it
4.0,The waste<br /><br />band broke on 2nd day of wearing them.not the best quality
4.0,"Super soft and very comfy, but a little larger than i thought they would be"
4.0,These are hard to get open.they work well for a home made sling though.
4.0,"Was a good fit , price is reasonable"
4.0,This was the perfect match to brown dress shoes and the belt fits as expected.
4.0,"I loved these boots. After a year though, they got some holes. But that was with LOTS of heavy use."
4.0,"Super cute perfect size for my daughters iPhone 5s, only problem is the tail fell off the second day she had it...it's otherwise sturdy and useful if you are worried about younger kids damaging phones"
4.0,Decent belt and subtle designs
4.0,"Does its job, just not the most attractive thing in the world."
4.0,I love snowflake and this show so it was a great combo
4.0,I guess my grandson liked ok
4.0,I get compliments eveyone I wear this shoe. I need one in every color.
4.0,The style looks expensive
4.0,"I really love this skirt and I'm glad I bought it. However, it was WAY bigger than I expected. Usually things run pretty small, and I'm about a medium in the waist, so I ordered a large. I think that I might have been able to make a SMALL work.<br /><br />I was too impatient to exchange for the correct size, so I altered it myself. I do love it, though. It's nice quality and I love that there are pockets."
4.0,Runs very large. Consider next size down
4.0,Love selection easy and price is right
4.0,great colors and i think these will last very well.
4.0,These were perfect for the price. they definitely done look like real leather but work for what we needed them for!
4.0,"Item looks handmade but does what it is supposed to do, with some practice. The wooden handle could be a little longer..as I don't think I have large hands. This helps when no one is around to help get on those difficult bracelets.<br /><br />I purchased this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I take this very seriously as I rely on reviews, like many of you, to make purchases. Nothing has been asked of me other than to give an honest review of the product, and as you can see from my review history it has no effect on my opinion. If this review has helped you make a decision, please hit the &#34;Yes&#34; button below. Thank you"
4.0,"I love how soft the fabric is and it feels comfortable. But the reason I gave four stars is because it’s too loose on me. I’m 5’0 and 110 pounds and got this in XS, but it was still big. I expected this to be a more slim fit so it could look better when I play sports... Would’ve gave 5 stars if it fitted like I expected it to."
4.0,these glasses are exactly as advertised.  I am not sure of their durability yet but they seem well made and not too cheap.
4.0,Functional and comfortable fit
4.0,Great item. Thanks.
4.0,Purchased as a gift.  The recipient likes the gift and wears it often.  It fits him well.
4.0,"This dress was soooo super comfortable! The high slit on the leg gave just enough breexy air flow and sexiness for my Hawaiian vacation. Originally bought it in a lighter solid color, but the material is thin, so it showed every lump and bump. The top stretched a little thin over my chest too, hence the four stars. Not bad for a casual dress for vacation or the weekends, but definitely go with a darker patterned color if you'd like to leave the full body spanx at home."
4.0,"Arrived fast, better than I hoped.  Thought that they would be sheer and see through.  They weren't, perfect for costumes."
4.0,Need to be more flexible.
4.0,"The photo shows a woman with her purse and shoes on, I wouldn't wear this outside of the home, as the material is a bit thin.  I got it in grey and love it.  It appears to be well made but the material is very thin.  That's not a bad thing at all, it's just not for outside of the home wear.  The pants are more fitted than the top which I like.  I've not washed it yet to see how it holds up.  I will update this if it doesn't hold up."
4.0,"My husband has had these for over two weeks now and says they feel good.  VERY well made, and a very solid and sturdy platform under the foot.  Loses a star because the arch support isn't as great as other products we've purchased (Orthoheel) but it still is a good and comfortable shoe.  There definitely is more support than a normal shoe or slipper.  Bottoms are sturdy enough to often walk around outside as well."
4.0,"Pretty large for an x-small but that’s okay, it’s comfier that way!"
4.0,"I am 34 B, I got medium. Slightly large. Material is good and very comfortable."
4.0,"This was a strange order.  It came four days early.  It is a package of 4 New Rhonda Shear Ahh Bras.  Ok got that.  However odd for ‘new’ bras that there was no packaging. No labels or tags, missing the standard Ahh Bra Removeable Pads. Just clean and neatly folded.  For me, really no issue.  I see they are clean and appear unwashed. I hate the stupid swivel pads anyway.  They are such a battle.  So I am OK with this sale.  Others might not be."
4.0,Like the material of this shirt! Very stretchy!<br />It was too big for the size so I would definitely go a size down.
4.0,Durable  & waterproof. Was smaller than I thought. Nice inside compartments!
4.0,"These are thinner than I expected but they still keep my feet warm at night. I also bought these socks and they were exactly what I was looking for, thickness wise: [[ASIN:B00QN3OTX2 SDBING Women's 5 Pairs Soft Comfortable Socks]]"
4.0,Tops a little sheer and it will shrink so order size larger or don’t put in dryer. Otherwise soft and comfortable
4.0,Good products but missing 1 ring
4.0,"fashionable and comfortable, i may have ordered a size too large for myself tho"
4.0,This dress is so comfy!  After one wash it looked faded a bit and I was disappointed. All in all great buy. Can add a Jean jacket in chilly weather.
4.0,Very soft and nice fabric.<br />Would have loved to keep it but way too big (size xs).
4.0,Soft and comfy! Love them!
4.0,"Loved this necklace! The design is perfect! The peace design is beautifully designed. The only thing is after a few uses the actual necklace broke. Even so, I would recommend this necklace if you love peace signs and retro designs. Super groovy design."
4.0,"They work pretty well for me--34 C. Tip--take out the pads to wash, my machine has semi destroyed them."
4.0,Beautiful bracelet! Very elegant and well made. Love that it extends to your wrist size.  My wrist is not super tiny ands this fits well. I gave it 4 stars because the string keeps opening up and you have to keep tightening it. I had to make 2 knobs in order for it to stop opening. It doesn't take away from how nice it looks!
4.0,Love the look of these on but they are not your typical fabric and tend to slide down as you wear them.
4.0,These shoes run just a tad small... go up
4.0,Not a bad hat. I bought it to exercise outside when it’s really hot and the sun is too strong. It’s a bit oddly shaped so it doesn’t fully stay on my head. The tie dye is nice.
4.0,Overall comfort
4.0,THe dress fits as expected
4.0,Cannot locate
4.0,Purse is nice. Not white As pictured.
4.0,Beanie is very soft and comfortable. Even though it's lined it's not too hot.
4.0,"Good quality,  my child loves them!"
4.0,"Dress fits well.  I am 5&#34;8 the length is just fine, just below the knee.  A great buy for the price!"
4.0,"The dots don’t match up in the front, so I returned it. But everything about it was great besides that. If you don’t care about the pattern in the seams matching up (and you might not!) it’s a great dress for the price. Size was accurate!"
4.0,The bracelet is very nice but the elastic tie that is holdimg the bracelet together is loose and actually rolls off my wrist. It is a beautiful item in person so I will cherish it but I need to wear another bracelet with this one on my size 7 wrist so it wont roll off when I am dont things. Great pick especially if you have a bigger wrist.
4.0,Just like picture shows
4.0,"Roomy, sturdy and weatherproof. Great for grocery shopping. Big enough for an overnight bag too, tho' black lining makes it hard to find things - otherwise would be 5 stars."
4.0,Made very good and are comfortable feels good has nice grip on bottom of shoes
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:7832f424bc2b6a7675382f9fb59b7d79]] I don’t dislike anything about these shorts. The only problem is the zipper was very hard to zip up, i thought i was going to break the zipper because it constantly was getting jammed"
4.0,Daily wear- like work or casually
4.0,Professional and fun
4.0,"Runs small, order size up. My husband is a 31 pants and he needed the large"
4.0,"Glad I got a medium, this would’ve been form fitting if I hadn’t. I am 5’6” and a size 4 for reference."
4.0,Jacket is a great color but the arms are a bit too short. Like just short enough for me to notice ya know?
4.0,Loved the dress and I received it very quickly.  The only problem is when my daughter tried on the dress the side seam ripped very easily requiring fixing.  But overall a great purchase.
4.0,"This is a two piece item. The tank top was pretty long, but both pieces are thick and fit well."
4.0,"This dress fits as expected and it super comfortable. It has pockets which is nice and fun. It a solid color so I add a scarf, necklace or something else to add a splash of color. I wore this green dress for St Patrick's Day."
4.0,Served its purpose. Wore as part of Minnie Mouse costume. Good price
4.0,"Great product, does exactly what I wanted it to.  The only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's a beating to wash.  You have to take out the pads and then try to maneuver them back into the bra....I wish they were just sewn in so I didn't have to mess with it."
4.0,"I like this bra, it does the job. Nothing spectacular but nothing wrong with it other than a 40ddd is a little tighter than a 40ddd in torrid so I'd say try to size up at least in the band."
4.0,light material but fit good
4.0,"If you need a watch that you can read easily at night, this is the one for you.  Illumination from the tritium is excellent even on the second hand.  Fit my critical use perfectly."
4.0,Very pretty. It is a bit tight.
4.0,Fits a little loose. I would order the next size down next time
4.0,Theses are lovely! I got two for gifts and will be pleased to give them to the peoplb
4.0,"This is the second set of these underwear I have ordered because they are so comfortable.  Like most of the other reviews I do agree they could be a bit higher in the back.  But for me it is not a game-changer.  Also, I had one of the four in the package was labeled as the size I ordered but was much smaller compared to the others.  I contacted the seller and received a prompt and effective resolution.  So working with the seller is definitely good."
4.0,Definitely runs big but comfy and not crazy frumpy.
4.0,They fit my 5 year old Spys. They get 4 stars because they are a tiny bit thinner than the factory lenses and therefore wiggle around a tiny bit more. It's honestly not that big of a deal and would buy again if needed.
4.0,"Very pretty, but it stretches over time."
4.0,I like that it fit and when washed it didn’t fade
4.0,The dress is shear and very transparent. It is very short in length. I bought 5 based on the measurements and now I will have to figure out how to alter then for my 88yr old mother in law who only weights 85lbs.
4.0,This earrings are great shape and quality materials. The look lovely and my daughter. The only downside and the reason for my 4 stars is the pushback came off often. They can be missed for that.
4.0,"It seems to run a little smaller than expected, but I can tell the fabric is high quality.  As long as it doesn't shrink, it should fit him just fine.  I'd definitely order from this seller again, I'd just order the next size up."
4.0,"I like that they offer some stretchiness, but they run small in my opinion. The finish is nice and they feel sturdy, but with shoes like this at the age my son is at he won't be wearing them for very long before he outgrows them.<br /><br />They're an inexpensive alternative to higher quality shoes, but maybe order a size or half up."
4.0,"The tulle skirt portion is gorgeous. The top material is lovely. The only consideration is that the model's pose hides how deep the sleeve angles into the chest area. They reveal quite a bit of skin and don't have a particularly flattering look for the chest. I wear it with a black bolero, and it looks wonderful. I don't think I'd purchase this dress if I were large-breasted."
4.0,Super cute. But does fit a little smaller then expected May want to order one size larger then your normal scrub size.
4.0,"Look closely at the size. The photo and description say 17&#34; Wide.  That is at the top, MAYBE if you pull open both sides at the same time,  as it sits I got 16&#34; at the top, and a little shy of 13&#34; across the bottom. Very cute bag, so dissapointed that it was too small."
4.0,"Bought these for my daughter she said they were ok, just kinda hung on her & were stiff.  But really shiny!  I thought they were cute bought a silver tank top to go with it."
4.0,"Of course, buying bras in person is hard enough, compared to buying them online.  But these bras fit nicely.  It is very comfortable, and had the feel of an underwire bra even though there were no underwires in the bras.  The colors are beautiful and it holds up very well in the washing cycle."
4.0,"Like the heavyweight material, and it's soft.  Longer than I would like."
4.0,love the fabric and the feel but it runs small
4.0,It's so cool!
4.0,"I'm becoming obsessed with my CowCow dresses... I have three so far and I just ordered two more! I'm a preschool teacher so I LOVE wearing all the different prints at work, and they are super comfy to pair with leggings and sneakers. My preschoolers always love them and I get tons of compliments from adults too, haha. For this particular dress though, I only gave four stars because after only one wear, the black fabric has gotten a bit pilly with fuzzy little white specks all over. Haven't put it in the dryer or anything weird. It must be just this print though, because I haven't had this problem with my other CowCow dresses."
4.0,They are cute but they run too big. Order size down!
4.0,Love how comfy these are. Will be buying more.
4.0,The acrylic is nice to prevent tooth damage from my lip ring. Would purchase again. It would have been nice to choose stone colors instead of the lots all being multicolored but I would still recommend.
4.0,Great top.... definitely runs big because I am wearing a small and I am definitely not a small. Usually wear medium or large tops. For reference I wear a 34 D bra.
4.0,"I really like this band for my Fitbit Versa 2. I wasn't really enjoying my Versa but thought I'd get a different band and this has made all the difference.  I'm allergic to plating and really struggle finding comfortable bands.  This one is comfortable and I love the colors on the band (pink, gray, and navy blue).  There are 3 things that kept me from giving the product 5 stars:  1) over time the band slips and gets bigger (you'll notice it before it's so big you lose your smart watch), 2) It makes using the charger a little awkward and 3) it wasn't easy to attach the bands.  None of these things are bad enough for me to dislike it."
4.0,It was a gift for my granddaughter and she loves it!
4.0,"It is SUPER small where you're supposed to fit your bills, and at one point I accidentally ripped a dollar bill trying to get it out of the darn thing. There's also very limited space for the cards to be put in, and you'd more than likely have to fit at least three cards in one pocket just to hold all of your stuff.<br /><br />Still, with that said, it's a super cute wallet, and made from extremely good materials. If mine broke, I would have no other choice but to buy another one of these, just because they're so adorable and, you know, include all of the turtles in a flashy manner.<br />*Leonardo is the best turtle*"
4.0,"They are the kind of sunglasses you can wear indoors no problem. I have a huge face and they fit perfectly, they are just really see through. If you wear sunglasses so you can stare at people and not be noticed, then these are not for you."
4.0,"Good quality and fits nice. Its a tad short on the torso however the arms are long enough. I'm a medium, but I usually get a large to accommodate for shrinking after washing. I had to return this item and get an XL."
4.0,"The material in GV denim gives in all the right places.  Because of this, I could have ordered a size smaller.  These Bermuda shorts are very comfy."
4.0,"These a well made ballet slippers. My 5 year old ballerina actually prefers them to the expensive pair I bought from her ballet school. They're easy for her to put on herself. Though both pairs are the same size, my daughter says the ballet pink pair feel too tight, so she only wears the pastel pink pair."
4.0,"These leggings are adorable and so freaking comfortable. They are made of this super soft, stretchy fabric that hugs everything perfectly and stays in place while not being too tight. Color seems true to the online photo and they seem to be squat proof. The only thing is with the fabric and fit, they seem prone to showing that “v” crease and potentially a little camel, but you can always wear a longer shirt if that bugs you."
4.0,Very beautiful so far I love it. The only thing I have a issue with is that it seems to run on the small side. We'll see how it holds up over time.
4.0,"I am using this product with my face mask. It does a good job, though not a perfect job. Nonetheless, I am happy to have purchased it."
4.0,exactly what i expected for the money. fabric was a little thin though.
4.0,Flows well and fits beautifully...
4.0,The jeans are really comfortable. I was surprised by how dark they were. I like the more subdued jeans. Though the darker fabric made me look slimmer. A good thing always.
4.0,Slightly &#34;harem&#34; like... more like sweats with a wide crotch area. My son loves them and thinks they're super comfy.
4.0,seems to work well to remove pvc from coins.
4.0,"These are nice masks. They have a flat metal band, which makes them form to my face better than those with a wire.<br />With the filter they work well, easy to breathe through, although they are a little much when exerting myself. Be warned, when washing in a machine, fold the metal band securely in the middle, or it could move to the side. You can move it back, but not easily."
4.0,Very nice swimsuit.  Rich color has not faded.  Great value
4.0,These run small so order a size up!
4.0,"First pair of real silk socks for me.  Bought to wear in my Ugg boots.  I like these.  They are thin and wick moisture from my feet, keeping the shearling sheep skin insoles dry.  Thanks"
4.0,"I’m 5.4 and it is way too long. I love the softness of the material though and will be keeping it, but I’m not sure if the length varies because other photos of people same height didn’t show it lying on the ground. I bought size M, I’m 156 lb and probably could go for a smaller size."
4.0,My ears can’t take any weighted earrings so I usually wear posts or VERY lightweight hoops. These are nice because although they are thicker looking they are hollow so don’t weigh much. Would have given 5 stars but the clasps are a bit flimsy. Very happy with these
4.0,For now its great. But putting vinyl on the rain slicker wont hold up.
4.0,"I'm a size 32&#34; waist and the medium fit me great.  I found these were very helpful on long rides at least on my seat.  I'm wearing regular biking shorts over these and have been very comfortable.<br /><br />Although it's not spandex the material feel is similar to it.  These kept my nether regions relatively dry for the whole ride.<br /><br />I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it."
4.0,"I appreciated that the measurements of the model were included in the picture, but they didn't say what size she was wearing.  And since some reviewers said it runs small, I ordered a large for my wife, but it was very loose.  So, I ordered a medium, and it fits pretty well, and she says it is comfortable, but I was hoping for a tight fit.  :)  I wonder if the other reviewers wanted it to be loose.<br /><br />But, a small is probably too small, lengthwise - my wife is only 5'3&#34;, but she is concerned that if she sits down, it will ride up too high, and so the small would definitely be too small.<br /><br />The zipper is kind of heavy for the light fabric.  When the zipper is a little way down, the weight of the zipper makes it flop around a little strangely.  It looks nice, but I'll keep an eye out for something better.<br /><br />The return process was easy came in a resealable package, and it was easy to print out the return label, etc. and drop off at the UPS store.<br /><br />Measurements:<br /><br />Hips: 37<br />Waist: 31<br />Chest: 30<br />Bust: 37<br />Height: 5'3&#34;<br /><br />I've attached pictures of the medium and the large.  Now looking at the pictures, it is actually hard to tell which is which.  There is a bit more puckering/loose folds in the large dress in the picture.<br /><br />Looking at the measurements on the size chart - I really wonder what size the model is wearing, because it seems very tight the whole way along, but she is six inches smaller in the waist than my wife (and 8 inches taller) so can she really be wearing a small in the picture?"
4.0,But not flattering in the midsection.
4.0,"It's a bit above the knee than expected, but then again i needed to measure myself from my end to get a better length estimation before purchasing, yet I was unable to. I now have my measuring tape, but over all I'm excited about the dress because I now have a different view on how to dress for work, versus how to dress everyday :-) My little career makeover is what i call it."
4.0,always get compliments on the Southern Attitude shirts I buy
4.0,"I travel a lot and love compression bags.  It's like putting 10 lbs of poop in a 5 lb bag :)  That being said, these bags  are extremely durable but I detracted one star because I like to at least get a peek of what is inside when I open my suitcase.  A bit of clear or screen  on top of these would put these at a 5 star quality.  The zipper is nice and sturdy which  is an issue with compression bags.  People (myself included) have a tendency  to over-stuff the bags and blow out the zippers.  If  you travel often and are always struggling to get the most space out of your bag, I highly recommend these!!"
4.0,"Such a pretty necklace! The color is gorgeous. It's very simple and goes with many different outfits. The Opal is sooo pretty, I've gotten many compliments wearing it. The only issue I have is the chain is pretty thin. I'm afraid I might end up breaking it. It's a rose gold color and besides the chain it's absolutely a wonderful necklace.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest unbiased review of it.

4.0,"NIce hat. Can't adjust the brim, so I pull it down or around if sun coming at me.  Adjustable inside drawstring works well. Just wish it had a chin stap for winds."
4.0,"I bought this suit for my son twice. The sleeves were too short the first time so I bought an XL for more arm length. Because of the sleeves, when I bought a bigger size  I had to pay an extra $40 to have the width altered otherwise I would've given a 5 star. He is 6'2 and 190 lbs. With a 6'4 wingspan. I loved it.  I would say purchase it because the quality and print is pretty good."
4.0,"When they say push up, they're not kidding. These bras push the girls UP! They're very comfortable and look great. Only reason I didn't give five stars is the back band is a little weird fitting on the sides but no big deal. And six bras for the price? Well worth it."
4.0,This dress is adorable in person. The fix was just right for the size we ordered. We had to return it sadly because there was a big section on the side that wasn’t sewn.
4.0,This was my daughter's favorite birthday present. I just wish it was so expensive!
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:8326e938359a50a34fd57e34406c61a3]] A little tighter than I thought it would be.  If you have medium or large wrists, go for the larger size.  But I'm a medium size, and I still have a little wiggle room.  It shines really well, but I will see tmr if It shines nice in the sun"
4.0,"Fit is as expected (i.e., I wear size 11, ordered 11 and they fit fine).  Since I've had (and recovered from) plantar fasciitis in both feet at different times, I was hoping for a little more arch support.  That being said, these slippers have more support than any other that I've tried.  I like that you can remove the insoles and replace with other insoles if needed (but I haven't needed to do so yet).  While they're supposed to be leather, not sure if that's the case.  All in all, glad I purchased them and would do so again."
4.0,"This is a fine shoe for maybe a nurse or someone working in an office.  As a Paramedic I found this shoe to be unstable for using out in the field.  I like to use a wedge of some sort but the dynamics of this shoe isn't meant for my kind of profession.<br />Nicely made shoe and I do recommend these for nursing or office work.  Quite comfortable, like walking on a cloud, just doesn't work for me."
4.0,"Fits well. There are three snaps that are very secure. It is slightly sheer, I wear it with a black bra and it doesn’t come off too suggestive. I am 5’7” 140 and a medium is perfect."
4.0,Love the colour of the stone. Have seen several like it for a much higher price.
4.0,It is for Christmas
4.0,Little snug but nice shirt.
4.0,It came right when it said it would and the metal of the necklaces is the right thickness along with the face that it is not a huge necklace (whole or in half) as I had thought it to be which is pleasing since I do not like large necklaces.
4.0,"Stylish and very light weight for comfortable wear. But, the dial window cover is easy to be scratched. And, it is hard to make repaired."
4.0,"Blue mirrored lenses - not actually blue plastic lenses.  Not a huge deal, but worth mentioning."
4.0,"These are absolutely adorable! My daughter is generally a 7 1/2-8, I got these in a 9 and they are perfect so they definitely do run small."
4.0,Nice quality and comfortable
4.0,it's super pretty but mine broke after a week ...
4.0,I was so surprised how adorable this suit was. I ordered three more to take on vacation.
4.0,"I really like this necklace! Nice quality. Nice Price. Yes, I'd recommend this necklace..  It's worth the (small) price.  )O("
4.0,The clasp doesn't stay closed
4.0,Super cute patterns but they constantly need readjusting to stay on
4.0,works as stated.  We'll see about battery life.
4.0,"I love this shirt, but the screen print is a bit heavy for my taste. I’ve had shirts printed that heavy in the past, and it seems like they start cracking in a year or two. Aside from that, the quality of the shirt is great, very comfortable."
4.0,Inner lining has come undone but nothing a little fabric glue can't fix
4.0,"Like: good lengthy, decent material<br />Dislike:  its more teal green, not money/forest green. Loose/modest fit, not fitted. I can tell the material may get dingy over time."
4.0,We bought 2 sets of these for a project for my daughter’s dance company. We were looking for travel charms. There are a lot of excellent ones. The quality in nice. There are just a lot of houses and birdhouses which we were unable to use. Still a good value.
4.0,I am 5’5” and about 130.  I ordered an XL because I like oversized so I can layer and longer for wearing over workout leggings just like it is depicted on the model.  I received mine today and it is comes to just under my bottom and is not tight but not loose fitting like the model.  To get as loose as the model I would have to probably get an XXL or XXXL.  It’s more like a sweater knit than waffle knit.  I don’t mind that.  I will still wear it.  I was just disappointed in the sizing.  It is a really nice style with the offset buttons.
4.0,"would like better if sides were a little firmer, so it stood up better"
4.0,It’s cute but kind of small. I would upsize it one or two sizes...<br />Besides being a little small for size it also has a very fitted make. No flare.
4.0,"Good material that is thick but doesn't add bulk. Top of leggings comes to my waist which is nice (doesn't hit right above hips creating that dreaded double muffin look). Flattens stomach area without being too constricting and DOESN'T ROLL which is a nice bonus. Material is soft and warm and not see through. Shipping was prompt and the leggings arrived early. The leggings, as many reviewers mentioned, had a horrible chemical odor! I washed mine twice and it came out. If you purchase these, wash them alone or your other clothing will reek also. I turned mine inside out to avoid pills. Despite the noxious chemical odor, I'm a satisfied customer."
4.0,"I'm usually a small, but reading the reviews I bought a medium. It's a good thing I did cause the medium fits me exactly. I would have liked it slightly looser but it's fine."
4.0,"The dress is a nice dress, but it really didn't do anything for my body type, and the sleeves were too long for me. I think the dress would be quite nice on different body style. The fabric is light and breezy, and quite gentle on your skin.  My stats for those who are considering this purchase are 4'11 - 110 lbs- 35, 26 1/2, 36"
4.0,Very nice simple looks like the photo
4.0,"This necklace is so pretty and inexpensive! I just wish it didn't tangle constantly.  I still wear it, though, because I like it."
4.0,This is an excellent product for a young lady.<br />I bought each niece an initial gift for Christmas and I found this design to be charming.<br />It is good value for the money.
4.0,"I ordered the size medium for the hubby. It fit well. It was a little tight fitting, but that helps so that he is able to wear in under clothing during winter weather. He normally wears size mediums in shirts so it was nice that this compression shirt was true to size. The womens shirt was not true to size.  With it being summer time, He hasn't really worn it outside much, but he is excited to try this out during winter time as an undershirt to keep him warm. I will update when he is able to do so. Overall, we would recommend purchasing this compression shirt.<br />*Disclaimer: I did receive this shirt at a discounted price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. This has in no way altered my opinion. I am in no way affiliated with this company."
4.0,Many compliments on this blouse. My only negative feed back is the button in the back. It would’ve been ideal to have a hook clasp rather than the button.
4.0,"Soft, cozy, graphic as pictured. Fits true to size."
4.0,"It was  pretty but gapped at the top.  I couldn’t get it tightened enough without discomfort.  If my neck were just a half inch longer, it would have been perfect!"
4.0,Nice house shoe for the price.  Comfortable with a  hard sole in case you need to step outside.
4.0,"I like them, they look really nice, they were just smaller than I expected"
4.0,"I've been wanting seamless leggings for a while, and after seeing a Youtuber say good things about these leggings, I decided to try them out. I knew they weren't completely seamless (they have seams along the inside thigh/leg area) but liked the look anyways. I am usually a Small and ordered a S/M, which I thought would be perfect. Surprisingly, they were a bit loose. They still look fine, but don't provide much compression or support, so I'd say these are best for lounging around. I wanted to wear them to the gym, and even though they were really thin, they passed the squat test, which is a huge plus. They're also very soft, so you can definitely wear them on any regular day. The high waist band also supports my stomach well. Essentially, even though they aren't very supportive, they are still very comfortable."
4.0,Very comfortable and wears well.  I was also very happy that the sleeves are a good length.
4.0,Wish it was bigger other then that great
4.0,Well made hat might bring a look or two.
4.0,Worked just fine for me and I'm a guy (used for Halloween)
4.0,"These are awesome. Only thing is, they're not labeled what size they are."
4.0,Just the right width my husband wanted. Quality is fine! Arrived on time and fits!
4.0,I'm satisfied with the gloves. They are on the thinner side but that was as expected. I haven't washed them yet but I would assume they'll be fine in cold water and after air-drying.
4.0,"The quality of the material of this waist trainer is pretty great. The pink color is beautiful.  But the size chart is off, it says a Large for a size 12 and even though I'm a size 10, I ordered the Large and it didn't fit me, is too small, i couldn't even close the first hook. That's why I gave it 4 starts. Even though is of a really good material, a really strong latex, it runs small.<br /><br />**I did received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion."
4.0,"Overall, the product does the job well. The material is also comfortable. For me, it could fit better over my ears and forehead better when worn with the face shield down tahn it does, but I still am pleased with the product."
4.0,"I love the color and look of these pants,; however they do not stay up with exercise which causes them to be uncomfortable."
4.0,I should’ve ordered up a size as some reviews suggested. This dress was tighter in some areas than I liked. And the yellow striped material was very thin and quite see-thru. I returned the yellow and re-purchased a larger size in the blue striped  and it’s perfect!
4.0,"Love the necklace. However, they need to package it better. I spent almost an hour getting it out of one giant knot."
4.0,"A little cheap feeling, and mostly a piece for festive events. But it is still very elegant, with shiny buckle, and I'd buy in other colours as well, especially considering the price.<br />I am a size 4, and 115lbs- and the belt was only a tiny bit snug around my bellybutton area. I wish it had been a bit tighter, though.<br />It's best worn with a tunic dress."
4.0,"Received these as a gift =) a little lighter quality than i would have expected, but overall good sunglasses"
4.0,"Super cute, but I think the gage is bigger than it says because it really hurt my piercing."
4.0,"Cute, exactly as described but very short! I'm 5'8"" with long legs and it barley covered my butt."
4.0,"Really nice item for the price. Nice material.  want to order more, but item is not available."
4.0,"It is really large. To wear this dress you have to be as thin as a stick, as tall as a model. Otherwise it wont look great at all. Delivery was fast, return was uncomplicated. I liked the material though. It is heavier, more suitable for colder summer evenings."
4.0,Well  fitted
4.0,Fast shipping and a very nice product.
4.0,"DH: a dress or pajamas arrived for you<br />DD: is that a new bathrobe? (Later: I love it!)<br /><br />Do I keep it?<br />Update: I kept it. I wore it today to a kids pool party and got lots of complements. It’s a nice dress for a casual event where you still want something nicer than shorts. It was in the 90’s and I didn’t overheat (bc it’s rayon not poly).<br />Two downsides:<br />1) up close the fabric looks cheap. But you do have to be close (see photo, which shows the pattern even though I could not get the color accurate in the pic). From a few feet away it looks like the Amazon photos.<br />2) waist is too high, bw natural waist and empire. This would be a good maternity dress though for that reason. However I’m not pregnant and won’t be again so I wish the waist was at the natural waist.<br />Overall a good dress for what I paid (about $30). I’m 5’5 125 and usually wear xs on top; S fit me fine.<br />I would buy this dress again ."
4.0,"I liked everything about this dress except the sizing. It was way off. In dresses I’m usually a small/medium and the medium was so tight that I’m not sure even a large would fit. The quality and design was great, though."
4.0,"Quality is not that high for the price, but definitely higher then cheaper models. Sits well, but has strange, unproportional ruffles on the sides. Kinda like maternity shirts do, but different on each side. Not sure why they’re there anyway. Other then that, it looks fine."
4.0,Decent shoe for the money
4.0,Muy buenos para esta temporada de usar tapabocas por el Virus !!
4.0,Such a cute little dress. It fits really well and true to size. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn't have any kind of snaps in it for quick diaper changes. The whole thing has to come off.
4.0,"While the item was true to the picture shown, it was not what I expected as far as fit. For me a blazer is a bit longer and thicker. The material is truly lightweight as it says in the product name however, I would consider this a lightweight cardigan. Now I did purchase a small and that could have been why it was a bit shorter on me and fitted on the sleeves I am 5'6 152lbs. However even with a bigger size it would not have made me think &#34;blazer&#34; just a cardigan where you could wear only a sleeveless tank top not a short sleeve fitted shirt. See the photos to get a better since of what I am speaking of. I gave the product a 4 because it is as pictured (the look when not worn) however not a true blazer."
4.0,Attractive charm for a bracelet.  Antique style is good. Clip looks like it will hold up.
4.0,It does slightly ride up in the middle thigh area but other than that they are rather comfortable wear for work and for home purposes. Good flattering to the figure as well in terms of shape fitting.
4.0,"This was much nicer than expected and my daughter loved it.  She still sports the hat 2 weeks after Halloween.  The straps are way to long, but done hot glue took care of it."
4.0,LIttle difficult to get on and off. But they dry very quickly and are quite durable. Perfect for getting in and out of the shower.
4.0,"For the price a very nice little dress. Great for travel, packs well no need to iron. With a cute shrug it’s the perfect little outfit. I would be sure to wash in cold water and hand dry to preserve the color."
4.0,"This is a beautiful piece with bold bright colors. It looks really good with my dark wash jeans. It dresses up a casual ensemble but isn't TOO dressy. I do wish it was maybe just a tiny bit smaller, but that is the only thing I would change about it. And it is perfectly gorgeous as it is. Smaller would just make me a little happier with it."
4.0,"Looks great, easy to install. The band is a little short, for fitting over a man’s hand. But great in every other way."
4.0,Little piece around the ribs could have been a little larger other than that it fits great
4.0,"The dress is just like it was described, however it is  little big in the breast area"
4.0,Nice Boots Bought An 8 Based On Reviews Their Snug But Nice Suggest Go A Half Or Full Size Up
4.0,Description and colors were great!.  A little tight but workable.
4.0,Very easy to wear. Full coverage and just a little fancy to it.
4.0,They were great addition for spirit week.
4.0,I love the cap
4.0,"Love it! I wanted a pretty robe and works for me. I first got the greenish one and it was too small, but will fit my smaller size 4-6 sister. Then I ordered the red one and its perfect, almost too big for my size 10-12 self."
4.0,For what I paid it was very nice. Considering it was about 2 bucks
4.0,"A very nice looking watch.  Feels light on the wrist.  It has a big face/dial.<br />One thing that would help would be directions on how to remove a link and/or marks to designate which side to remove the pin - I ended up splitting a link because I forced the pin out the wrong side - oh well, I wanted it removed anyway.<br />Im thinking of buying one of the other varieties/colors to have fashion accessories for different days ;-)"
4.0,Fits good could be a bit smaller and the matrrial is very thin but overall a nice dress
4.0,This is a nice top. I bought it to go under other tops and really expected it to be longer. Or maybe I was just hoping it would be longer.
4.0,"The quality of the product was perfect, just runs small."
4.0,Very nicely finished bracelet.  Looks more expensive than it actually was.
4.0,Love the case. Just as pictured. Only draw back is that its slightly slippery so it doesnt give a good grip on the phone. But the design itself is beautiful.
4.0,Not too flattering but very comfy and cute. I ordered the medium thinking that small always seem to run a bit small. The small would have been perfect. Good material. I would order again.
4.0,"The clasp works perfectly if you use your fingernail to open it. The heart sparkles beautifully, along with the entire bracelet. I had to return mine because I chose a size way too big."
4.0,I make earrings and I give these away with the silver earrings.  They work with a little bit of elbow grease.
4.0,"It is as described, I would've love if it was a little softer, which it would probably happen after the first wash, other than that it is fine!!"
4.0,son likes them a lot
4.0,I’m a fan of this dress as a Floridian. It is very sheer so it will make a great cover up or staying home day. My husband wasn’t mad at the look of it. It’s comfortably sexy. I’m 5’5” and I guess 140lbs and the Medium fits perfect. However I will not be putting it in the dryer to preserve the fit and length.
4.0,"Very nice and organized compared to some I've gotten.  Each group is bagged up separately and came with a pouch to keep them all in.  Only have 1 issue.<br /><br />I didn't realize until I went to put in the 4ga spiral that I have 1 4ga and 1 2ga spiral.  I double checked all the other sizes and they all appear correct,  just this one.  Although disappointing because I prefer the spiral, and will be at a family wedding this weekend without them in.  I am able to use one of the other 2 types of plugs that came in the kit though so I'm not completely dissatisfied."
4.0,Very nicely designed. Worked great. Will buy again.
4.0,"It was kind of a pain in the butt to get in my watch band, and it dosent fit very well"
4.0,"These are good, lightweight to the point of being a bit flimsy, but alright. There is a cloth bag for the glasses, which won't substitute for a carrying case, you will need a separate carrying case. The magnification seems accurate.<br /><br />Update: I've been wearing these a couple of weeks. They're lightweight and comfortable, they've become my favorite pair of reading glasses, but they really need an anti-reflective coating."
4.0,"This jacket is an interesting addition to my wardrobe ! I love the material and the print of the grey, it is truly unique! the only problem I had was when I tried to zip it up. The jacket is better worn unzipped or half way. I got the size 12 and it was a little bit too loose unzipped, and snug but not uncomfortable zipped around my 32&#34; waist. If you do not like tight clothing I would order the next size avaliable. 4/5"
4.0,These shorts are so dang cute! I ordered a 5 which is my typical size and they are great! A little tight to pull over my thick thighs but fits perfect around the waist. So comfy and stretchy.
4.0,"Very comfy, but not push up."
4.0,Leggings are lightweight and comfortable for summer.
4.0,Just don’t get wet only for day use
4.0,Was the perfect gift!  My grand daughter loved everyone of them.
4.0,"I bought these for a hard covered suitcase. On the way to our destination, they stayed in place perfectly. But on the way home, it come completely off."
4.0,"Based on reviews I ordered a larger size, unfortunately it was too big for my daughter. So I am sending them back. Very cute sandal."
4.0,"Got it to keep rain off pants pockets when walking in the rain; fit is decent (size 42 R, so I picked large; wished it had drawstring of some kind in midriff though."
4.0,It was as adertized
4.0,My son loved this hat. He's an average 5 year old so the hat is a bit big. I was expecting it to be a child size but its more of an adult size. Good thing in that is it will fit him for years to come. The only reason I gave 4 starts instead of 5 is because the pink nose feel off withing first week of wearing and it was lost. Hat is still cute but which stitching held up.
4.0,"Work great, and very comfortable."
4.0,Got this for a friend who loves the movie Mean Girls and she loved it. Nothing too fancy but simple & gets the reference across. Hard to go wrong with hats
4.0,Would like a beefier material. Just a bit thin.
4.0,"I purchased this twice.  The sizing runs large.  The second, smaller size fit as expected."
4.0,The rain poncho worked great on my recent trip to Seattle. Took it on a hike and when it started raining it covered me and my daypack. I would have given it 5 stars but once you open it up there are no instructions on how to refold it. It is made to be folded back into itself for easy carrying.
4.0,Lovely color and style.
4.0,Nice for making bracelets to use with essential oils.
4.0,"Nice suit, top is somewhat small. Went by sizing chart and reviews...does run small. When in doubt order next size up. Overall nice suit."
4.0,I love this shirt but it runs really small.  I am usually a large but even the XL is tight
4.0,"I just got it in the mail, two weeks after I ordered it which is much sooner than I expected it to arrive. The metal is low quality and the stone in the middle is not as blue as its advertised but its still really nice, definitely worth what I paid for it. I recommend this item, its good for a gift or just to cos-play."
4.0,Not 5 stars for me because the neck is too wide for my style.
4.0,"I recently switched from an older Apple Watch with a 44mm face to a new 40mm model.  Hence, I am in the process of replacing all of my watch bands.  I previously had success with a stainless steel, single-strap watch band with my prior watch and decided to give this one a try as it is compatible with the smaller watch face.  Here are some thoughts:<br /><br />• Contents: The box comes with the watch band, detailed instructions on how to add/remove watch links, a pin removal tool, and some spare accessories.  Other than a small pouch to keep everything together, this has everything you would need.<br /><br />• Size/Fit: This is a single-strap watch that can be resized by adding/removing chain links.  I have fairly thin wrists and can confirm that this only fits my wrist on the absolute smallest setting.  So keep this in mind for thinner wrists.  The instructions are useful at first, though it becomes a fairly quick process to add/remove chain links once you get the hang of it.<br /><br />• Comfort/Feel:  The wristwatch is relatively comfortable considering the stainless steel material.  As I have this on the smallest setting, it sometimes takes awhile to fit this past my hand and onto my wrist.  It may also take a few tries before you can consistently avoid having this pinch against your skin when clasping the watch band into place.<br /><br />In summary, this is a nice watch band that provides a simple, yet classy look.  This is probably better for a medium-sized wrist or bigger, but it does fit mine on the lowest setting and I look forward to utilizing in the rotation."
4.0,"For the price & quality it is a great value. Only 2 minor issues kept this from being a 5-star product:<br /><br />The fit of the glove seemed slightly off. The knuckle holes were offset by less than a 0.5''. And it seems like there should be more give around the area right below where my thumb meets my hand. However, I did order a size 8 and my hand is 8.25'' around, so that might contribute to the issue.<br /><br />The leather is thin which results in crinkles after it is worn-in. I feel like a higher quality leather would not have this problem, but it is barely noticeable when the glove is worn."
4.0,"Based on reviews, I ordered the extra large size (I wear a 34D) and it's a little too large. I wish I had ordered one size smaller."
4.0,These bras DO fit a 38 DD in an Xl. It is manageable but I still think I'd be more comfortable in an XXL if there was one offered. I would not rely alone on bra-size comparison charts.
4.0,"This is a very pretty gold satin evening clutch bag with an embroidered overlay on the top and a 10&quot; detachable chain that tucks away into the bag invisibly so it can be used as a clutch. Measuring approximately 10&quot; x 4&quot; x 2&quot;, the bag has plenty of space and compartments inside to store makeup, money, keys, and whatever else.<br /><br />The inside is satin lined as well, and consists of two open storage spaces divided by a center zippered compartment, with a long elastic topped pocket on the back wall designed to hold lip balm or other small items. When the clutch is closed there is a small open space on each side that provides the opening for the chain, so you might want to store slender items like eye liner inside the zippered compartment rather than the open pouch to ensure they can't fall out through those openings.<br /><br />I have long hair and found the chain pulled at my hair when I tried wearing the bag over my shoulder. Luckily the chain is easy to detach, or you can just leave it attached and tuck it away inside the bag if that's a problem for you as well. All of the sewing work appeared to be neatly done, and the bag looks even better in person than the pictures show. It's a beautiful clutch that would be a lovely accessory to an evening dress, a prom dress, or for bridesmaids.<br /><br />This clutch bag was provided at no cost by the manufacturer for evaluation and review."
4.0,"This eyeglass retainer appears to be of better quality than others I have ordered. The loop that fits on the eyeglass temple seems sturdier. I would have given 5 stars, but I do not know if the metal parts are rust-proof (and won't know until the weather turns warmer next spring). This was an irritant in other models because sweat tends to cause rust very quickly. My hopes are high for this model."
4.0,"I wanted oversize sunglasses and diligently explored my online options. I was about to pay $125 for a similar pair when I saw these! The price was right! I ordered one in black with dark lenses and the other in brown with gradient lenses. They serve my purpose with the exact look I was after. I didn’t give them 5 stars because the temples are not as wide as I’d have liked. However, for the price, and as I have been known to lose my sunglasses, put them in my purse and scratch them etc. I can enjoy these without guilt. I also got two pair for far less than the price of one! I’d buy them again and just may have to! Lol!"
4.0,"These rings look nice, but after a few months the one I have been wearing is not stretching. The stickiness of the rubber gets snagged on my pants pocket all the time. This partially contributed to the stretching. Overall, I like the ring. Maybe for the price the time that remain wearable isn't a really an issue. It would be nice if they were more stable."
4.0,"I should have bought the smaller size, but it's ok for just hanging around my house."
4.0,I love this cap (dark blue) and just ordered another one in a different color. It's very comfortable with a soft feel on the head. The quality is pretty good. I use the most open snap position (there are 3) to fit my head size: 22.75 in = 7.25 (M) hat size. It's a little bit loose but I like it that way. The middle snap position is wearable but tight. I would have rated 5 stars but for the packing. The cap came folded which left a crease over the top from ear to ear. I blocked it with moisture for 24 hrs which mostly removed it but will need to do it again. No biggie but why crease your caps like that leaving the buyer to fix it.
4.0,"Nice! Fits well, good product for the price"
4.0,"I bought these because I felt like I was always squinting when driving at night due to the brightness of new headlights and other aftermarket lights people put on their cars.  I've been using these for about a week and have noticed that I don't have any issues driving to and from work in the night any more.  You can still tell which lights are brighter than other, but they don't hurt my eyes or make me squint when wearing the glasses.  I would highly recommend."
4.0,Bought a size 4 which is a small. My daughter is petite and the fit is loose and not tight on her. Shirt is a bit boxy. Fabric is thick and comfortable to wear. Great lounge wear for the price.
4.0,"This cap has an overall good fit, isn't too heavy and is pretty comfortable. It kind of looks like a mini chef hat when it's on but it fits more hair in compared to the traditional surgeon-cap."
4.0,Cute blouse and comfortable. But fabric not good for very hot days. Not an overly breathable fabrication
4.0,I just received my ring today and I love it!
4.0,Beautiful and true to picture but I don't know how to wear these kinds of earrings. The weight of the earring doesn't allow for it to stay on so I just keep them in my jewelry box because they're so pretty.
4.0,I purchased a larger size but I should have ordered the correct size. The dress is soft and comfortable to wear. I would like to know what other dresses this company has because I would like more. I would definitely recommend this dress.
4.0,"These boots caught my eye immediately when I saw they were for sale.  They came through regular mail and were packaged in a shoe box in a bag.  Both boots came with dust covers.  I have the light blue color.  These have khaki colored soles and stitching, and silver like rivets.  The laces on these are also a khaki color.  These are true to the color that is advertised by the seller.  They seem very well made, the only issue may be around the ankles.  This part seems like it will wrinkle after a lot of wear, so taking care of these is a must.<br />I ordered what is a US size 8, my normal shoe size.  Length is ok, but the width of these is a little thin and I will have to wear a very thin sock so my feet do not get too uncomfortable.  While the heel has a flat bottom, the front is rubber with excellent traction, so there is no worry about falling and slipping.  The comfort over all is like any heel, there is no avoiding an aching foot if you wear these all day or go dancing in them.  They are about average when it comes to a heel being comfortable on my feet<br />I had received compliments on these the first day I got them.  I think they go with pretty much any outfit and you can dress them up or down, very fun.  I'm pretty sure I am gonna buy them in another color as well.<br />As I said the size is a bit narrow and the ankle part may wear down if not taken care of properly, all in all they are a great shoe."
4.0,"Great dress, especially for the price. The fit is just slightly big around the waist but it's not noticeable. The fabric is nice and thick (no worries about it being see-through). Would definitely buy again."
4.0,Not sure how I bought 2 north face jackets in same size and this large was too small
4.0,"The belt itself is well-made and lovely. There's no discoloration at all. The buckle has a nice finish, but I had to finagle the fitting just a bit."
4.0,"This is a very beautiful dress, nice fabric, exactly as picture, flows beautifully. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that it looks a bit matronly for someone in their 20s. The wide straps coupled with the below-the-knee under-layer make for an older look instead of the easy breezy young look.<br /><br />However, I cut the bottom layer out, making it just a sheer skirt which I pair with shorts and that made the dress much more appealing."
4.0,"They are super cute, and have put up with a super active 4 year old. They have blown out a bit on the toe but thats after 3 months of hard wear!"
4.0,Nice watch for the price. Slim and elegant.<br />Case size is bigger than advertised.<br />I like this watch.
4.0,"I'm 4'9 at 100lbs. It's a bit loose around the knee and ankle area. Form fitting around the buttocks. It has a nice smooth, silky material."
4.0,Very comfortable! Fit as expected and arrived on time. The price was right too!
4.0,Appeared to be a good crisp quality.  Ran small.  I would have reordered a larger size but the red had a pinkish tint to it.  Not true red.
4.0,Cheap.  But worth it and cute. Work professional
4.0,Once assembled and adjusted product is excellent.  Instructions could be improved small parts and big hands make assembly and adjustment difficult.
4.0,Nice cozy gloves good purchase overall.  Which u could use smart phone with them on but you cannot
4.0,"I really like how it looks, but it's quite transparent, and you have to wear heels if you're gonna wear it"
4.0,The sweatshirt was well made and comfortable.  If fit my husband perfectly.
4.0,"I returned these as they were smaller than I had thought, nevertheless they were lovely."
4.0,Great quality. Seems true to size. Looks exactly as pictured. Only problem is it is way too long for me. I'm 5'3 but I can always just hem it.
4.0,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F31JY9S/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_4
4.0,Pants part is a little too short for me but overall it’s a nice party jumpsuit.
4.0,Nice color but very small.
4.0,I just wish the black braided part was smaller.  I'm not able to adjust it to the size of my small wrist so it's a little big.
4.0,Was as described.  It was a gift and receiver loved it.
4.0,"I wear a US size 16/18 and ordered the largest size XXXL. The bottom fit fine, but the top area of the jumpsuit felt too short. I was able to button the jumpsuit up, but kept pulling on the crotch area. I am 5’8” tall. If the size were larger I think it may have more room & fit my long torso. Quality was nice and jumpsuit was really cute."
4.0,A little warm for the summer time but I can get over that....They feel great...really enjoy them...
4.0,"The material is good, it was little bit small but can work with...."
4.0,It was nice fit is a little off in the chest but other than that as expected.
4.0,"It's a cute bracelet, but it's larger than indicated."
4.0,"Fantastic price .this is not a math brown,but for the price,you can't beat it with a stick. Not all of us can afford a mercedes."
4.0,"It was a bit small in the bust section and showed a bit too much so I decided to return it. However, it you don't mind a bit of cleavage showing it's a beautiful dress and seemed to be well made! The color was also very alluring"
4.0,Very comfortable.  Received compliments on the dress
4.0,"I purchased this bracelet because I'm Buddhist.  I didn't pay close attention what it says on it but I realized it didn't say om mani padme hum. So I started research about what the writing means and I finally found it!!!<br />[...]<br />According this site, the writing means a Tibetan greeting!!!<br />And it's not Sanskrit, it's in Tibetan script..<br />Anyway, I love this bracelet!!!<br />I already had a lot of compliments ;)"
4.0,"I ordered a small and didn’t have to make any adjustments. I’m 5’2”, 142lbs, 34C. The arms were pretty tight(which I expected) but the bust fit just right. The material is stretchy. The height of the split was just right but I didn’t like the alignment, hence the 4 stars. The split didn’t fall over the thigh area like I thought it would."
4.0,"heavy, but looks great."
4.0,"This was a gift for my sister in law and she loved this. The pendant was a little smaller than I expected, but the size is listed in the ad."
4.0,"This is a beautiful, lightweight coverup. It has natural, unique buttons (two on each side) that do not unbutton. It can be worn in a few different ways. Please see the photos.<br />I purchased this item as a coverup but also to wear it as a piece to accent and/or modify my work wardrobe as it dresses up nicely. I love the versatility in it. If you look at the other options, (this one is sky), they are a little bit different. The fact that you can wear this piece in three or more ways is pretty cool on its own.<br />When I took the coverup out of the package, I was expecting it to be larger.  I am 5’8” and I anticipated it covering my swimsuit area but it ends before my waist. The fabric is very thin and lightweight but it already has a couple of snags in it.  That is probably my fault as I have calloused fingers.  It may iron out with some steam.<br /><br />I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback."
4.0,I wear a size 4 pants/skirt these beads could fall off. Lol. But nice beads
4.0,A bit large but attractive and comfy.
4.0,Fits nicely and it is comfortable
4.0,"This dress is very well made. I paid $19.99 (it was on sale) and was blown away by the quality. There is no need for a slip. The lace is just beautiful and has reindeer all over it--something I did not notice when I bought it. That being said, I would only feel comfortable wearing it during the month of December. I gave this dress four stars because the small was big on me. I am 5'4, about 115 lbs, athletic build. The dress was big in the chest and waist area. If you are bigger chested and have some tummy to work with, this dress might fit you better than I. The length was excellent as the dress came right below my knees and the lace overlay was approximately two inches lower than the dress. It was just lovely and I received ample compliments while wearing it; I just wished it fit better."
4.0,These baby shoes were very cute for our Christmas photoshoot. They are lightweight for babies.
4.0,Good hoodie for the price
4.0,"The dress was really cute, exactly the length & color I wanted. My only disappointments were that 1) the material was REALLY thin (I had to be sure to wear spanx underneath so it couldn’t be seen through), and 2) there was a slight sewing imperfection along the side seam (it was hidden by the blazer I wore it with, so it wasn’t really noticeable)."
4.0,"Fits like the original band that came with my Fitbit. Where the original has a notched band loop to hold the tail of the band on place, this on does not, so it has a tendency to slide around and sometimes slide off. That allows the tail to flop around some, until you slide it back into place."
4.0,Thin material but will be perfect for summer ! Fit as expected.
4.0,"Lovely dress! Fit and color as expected, the fabric is thinner than expected but nothing I would rate as a complaint."
4.0,"I purchased this pin as a gift. The pin was a little smaller than I imagined it to be, but was still super cute. The recipient loved it!"
4.0,"Looks good in photos and in person. Knocked a star off since the stitching on the pocket squares was bit rough. The finished product was not a smooth as I'd have liked, but was passable since I could tuck those ends in."
4.0,Make sure you follow the measurements closely. We ordered a bigger size and it still didn't fit.
4.0,"Item is really nice, color is exactly as pictured. Size can be a little snug but it's long enough and I would not categorize as Asian size. I'd definitely recommend ordering a size up. One little downside is, fabric is very thin and, if you choose a light shade as I did, I'm afraid it's somewhat see- through. I usually don't mind it much considering the price, but since I wouldn't want to wear an undershirt with this particular item, I've decided to return it. P.S.: The high rating goes for honest item description and price."
4.0,It’s cute! It’s for Christmas I think it’ll fit her wrist.
4.0,"This wallet can make an excellent gift.The wallet comes in a gift box wrapped up protectively with cardboard inserts on the inside. The wallet has  so many card slots - 21 card slots, photo id slot and have four large partition windows and then one larger pocket which is a zippered pouch. The zippers and clasps seem to be very sturdy. I purchased this wallet for my MIL as she needed the clutch which jas more room so this wallet will give her plenty of room for cards, cash and keeping any other valuables. It is shiny and glossy learher material. It doesn't smell funky which is most of the time case in leather stuff..."
4.0,"Great unique gift, only thing I didnt like was the wings are suppose to hold ball together but doesn't do a very good job, it was very loose and the ball comes undone very easily. Over all very cute gift and person I gave it to LOVED IT."
4.0,Good fit and very durable!
4.0,"So when I first got this thing in the mail to wind my [[ASIN:B000EIA0LW Invicta Men's 8928 Pro Diver Collection Automatic Watch]], it didn't work at all.  I'd plug it in, flip the switch both ways, nothing.  After a few days of frustration, I decided to try to figure out what was wrong before totally giving up on the thing so I tried different outlets, turning the plug upside down, trying to open the winder up, spinning the case--everything.  Or so I thought.  My last idea was that maybe something was wrong with the cable, and so I had the brilliant idea of licking the jack at the end while it was plugged in.  Turns out, the cable was fine.  Plugged it in and the winder worked like a charm! Pain in the neck but worked out eventually"
4.0,Not an expensive piece but pretty and one of those things perfect for everyday wear
4.0,"Love this winter sneaker,  my feet are warm and dry. Good fit too."
4.0,"I use this for work, I work out side on the elements so when it rains like today it freezes a little bit, but for the price it's good"
4.0,"I bought a pair of these that were on sale and a heather grey color and loved them for comfort and walking. I decided to buy them in the army green bc I love the darker green color and thought I could wear them to the gym. The green that I got was not as pictured and was more of a sage lighter green. The color was disappointing but the comfort and fit were still on point!! I am curve with a big booty, normally wear a size 10-12 and can range in M-L workout gear. The large fit great for comfort, compressive but not too tight. Could have also probably fit into medium for a little bit of a tighter fit."
4.0,As of now no issues.
4.0,our daughter loves it.
4.0,"Nice shirt. Very fitted, so buy a size larger than normal.  Gets compliments.  Pretty comfortable, wish it was 100% cotton"
4.0,Great lightweight sleep shirt
4.0,"This dress is so cute. My only complaint is that the buttons pucker a bit at the chest and waist. But I’m just contributing that to I need to lose some weight. I’d suggest going up a size, though, to prevent the puckering. The length is great though. I’m 5’9 and it hits a little above the knee which I like,  not too short."
4.0,Fits great! True to size .. My only issue is the blouse has a vitamin smell that is very strong and hard to remove!
4.0,"The back of this dress needs to be laced up (like a shoe) too close. I found it too cumbersome to bother with all that. It comes with the laces wrapped separately. So, while it was a pretty dress, and seemed well made, it was just not worth keeping for me."
4.0,Looks hot. Wouldn't wear in public.
4.0,It was some small but pretty
4.0,I usually wear a size 13 shoe with room to spare. Ordered these in US size 13 and they BARELY fit. Size up
4.0,These fit perfectly. I didn't think the skid on the bottom would be adequate to keep my LO from falling but it is and is working wonderfully. They are a bit expensive in my opinion but he had the money to spend and was okay with it. We may purchase them again in the future.
4.0,I loved the designs of the masks and the feel of the fabric. One thing I didn’t like though was that some of the masks were bigger than the others and the ear loops were loose so some of them had trouble staying on and up over my nose. Other than that I really like the masks and enjoy wearing them!
4.0,"Awesome piercings.  Look great, but they lost a star because they really irritated my ears.  Could just be me, but be aware when buying them.  But for the price they are worth a try!"
4.0,It’s kind of thin. But my daughters still likes it
4.0,"I’ve ordered 2 sets from this brand so far -in the same size-and compared to both of those, these seem to be constructed a bit different. I ordered the all “nude” set. The material feels looser and doesn’t have as much “compression”? “Taught-ness”? There is a looseness in the fabric between the seams where my thighs curve to my torso. And when handling them during laundry day, I did a stretch test b/w this set I ordered and my previous set and there was an obvious difference in feelings of elasticity. They still fit and are comfortable but I feel a lot more of a “hug”, I guess is the right term, from the other two sets I ordered in Winter and Basics. Idk if ordering a smaller size would be a solution because I wouldn’t want them to dig in around my thigh. I’m not sure. Maybe it’s a fluke. I plan on ordering another color set to see if this becomes the new construction consistency for them. Because these became my “holy grail” pair of underwear. We’re pretty much seamless, hugged me in all the right ways, and when I put them on it was like “ahhh”. So happy. Lol. And never have issue of riding up. I get a Large, and for reference I’m an 14/16 and I have a curvy hourglass shape. Also wear an XL in pants at Target and in Daily Ritual (Amazon) brand for more reference. So 4 stars for the set of all “nude” because I’ve been spoiled to the embrace your predecessors give me."
4.0,I loved this set.  Very comfortable and washes well.  Wish I could buy more.  Amazon says it's not available anymore.
4.0,Very soft & comfy! Look great! Give some as the day goes on but not so much to be a problem.
4.0,cute but cheap. good for the price
4.0,"I loved these sweatpants... the one time I wore them. It's my own fault for not reading the wash directions. I washed and dried them as I usually would, and they shrunk down what seemed like a whole size. They became tighter than what I like sweatpants to be and shorter. I ended up giving them to my sister who is shorter than me, and she really likes them."
4.0,"Good, not great. Could have more cushion."
4.0,Size is a bit big and fit is different than others I have but still nice
4.0,"Runs smaller then size. Luckily I have ordered up a size. Otherwise we are happy with it, little girl loves it."
4.0,My only complaint is that I got sunburned thru the top in a short time. It made me feel like I was on fire when out in direct sun. Otherwise it’s very comfortable
4.0,"On picture, it looks matte but it has more of a sheen in person. I didn't mind it too much. It still looked great! The quality may not be perfect, but for the price I think it's worth the buy. I'll be wearing it more often in the future for sure."
4.0,Love this dress! I did take off one star because there was a stain on the first one I ordered. I exchanged it and the second one came without a stain. I always get it’s of compliments when I wear it! The length is also great for a 5’ 2” gal like me!
4.0,A gift to a friend for valentine. I hope she enjoyed
4.0,"Very cute phone strap, can also be used as a key chain. Some of the beads are a bit soft and they broke in a couple of days"
4.0,"Super cute and comfy but they’re not the material they look in the photo. I still really like them. They fit good. I ordered the 2xl. I think I’ll order a second pair, as it’s been really hot and though we’re home a lot more, they’re cute to just wear around the house."
4.0,Love the color and it is the perfect size for the stuff I need to carry
4.0,Love this little romper. True to size. Fits comfortably. Bought a L
4.0,They're fine. Just too small.
4.0,I really liked the color and style it just  wasn't wide enough for my wonky feet
4.0,"I liked the fit, style and color of hat. The only thing I did not like was the clip used to attach hat to head. It only has one clip and does not stay in place very well. Too hard to add bobby pins to help hold it because material is too thick to get bobby pin through. Also it did not come with a headband like most other hats did. It would have helped a lot had it come with headband or a better clip or maybe two clips on the underside of hat to hold hat in place on head."
4.0,"This black velvet cap looks and feels great. The material is pleasingly soft. There is a tie with which toadjust in the back. I wasn't convinced I would like it or that it would hold but my fears were unfounded. Itis simple to use and quite comfortable. It is a well made cap, perfect for cooler weather."
4.0,"I really like the look and the magnetic lens. They are very Big! the field of view is not as big as the high end Oakley or electric goggles, but I wasn’t expecting that at this price. There is a slight fish bowl feel as well but you don’t notice that after a few minutes. I’m happy with the purchase"
4.0,I'm 7 but in this model I'm 8. Ask one size up people!
4.0,"These fit well, as expected, but they're not as durable as I had hoped. They're breathable and comfortable as I work out, yet the thin material just doesn't seem to be durable to long term use. A bit disappointed that it wasn't a bit thicker."
4.0,"Seems to stain easily, and stain sets in"
4.0,"These slippers are just what I wanted. They are warm and comfortable. I appreciate the hard sole that has a bit of traction, especially when I go out for the paper and the pavement is wet. The slippers were a bit difficult to put on at first, but with use this is not a problem. The reason I gave them four stars instead of five is that the great cushioning inside flattened with just a few wearings."
4.0,The bras work find. I am very pleased with them.
4.0,"Cute design, decent quality"
4.0,Happy!!!!
4.0,Nice think comfortable fabric. Great nose piece.  It just fits large on my face.
4.0,Order a size up. This outfit looks just like the photo but mine does not have a zipper in the back (As pictured)so it's very( hard to get on and off but none the less I love it(once I get into it)!
4.0,"Beautiful dress, nice fabric but too small. I would say that it is 2 sizes too small."
4.0,Like the fabric. This dress is long for me as I’m only 5’2”+ but otherwise I’ll be wearing it
4.0,I ordered a 24 month and it is a bit larger than a 24 month. Luckily I have a chunkier boy so he fills it out some in the tummy area. Length was pretty spot on though!
4.0,This is a nice summer light weight tunic. The only negative would be some loose threads.
4.0,"My daughter recently joined the school track team and needed a gym bag just for track. This was the perfect choice - cool color, big enough for change of clothes, after school snack, water bottles and even a special area for her sneakers."
4.0,Great for work! Love the color. The material isn't bad. It's what you pay for! The length is great on this too.
4.0,Not good for very sunny days but improves vision on days that are less sunny. They make everything more clear.
4.0,"Beautiful coat! I purchased a medium and since it didn't fit, I gave it to my friend. I will order a size up."
4.0,Don’t care for the feel of the fabric
4.0,"These are really comfy, light-weight sandals for casual wear.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that my feet ache if I stand or walk in them for too long.  I would recommend these for light wear."
4.0,"Beautiful with wonderful leather smell. It is small so you cannot fit a lot of things inside (and hardly anything in the front pockets) but it can hold a phone, smaller wallet, and keys."
4.0,"It is really soft like the description. However, do not expect any support or firmness for carrying. It is like a good, cleaning handkerchief."
4.0,Love the style waited a while for delivery but worth it. The watch has a cool look.
4.0,"It was either me spend' large on shoes or tipping my door man for Christmas.  That door man can get a second job, cuz these shoes are shizzel!  My money, my life, the doorman can have may change if I drop it.  I will wipe my can with these after a few dayz"
4.0,The Bottom falls right below my breasts... totally cute as long as there is an under shirt- i bought 2- one in turquoise and one in purple-  both are darker than showen in pictures
4.0,"I found these to be a great pair of running shorts, though probably not in the top two I own. I like the side slits, for easy movement when running, as well as the back zip pocket to keep my house key secure. I went with size small, even though I am a size 0/2 in clothing, to ensure they were easy to move in when active. I actually would have been fine in the xs size but with a tie waist I kept the small. I prefer a wide, soft waistband in my running shorts, which these do not have (they are mesh and a narrow band) so that was a downside for me. But they are lightweight and comfy. Only other negative for me was the side slit style created a bit of a “flippy” appearance from the front which isn’t my favorite, but doesn’t make me regret the purchase. Maybe being slightly bigger than my body size added to that. I’ll continue to wear them on my runs regardless.  I’ve bought Baleaf activewear before and find it to be very nice quality."
4.0,Good fit; pretty comfy.
4.0,I like the sweater. Only thing is that a few of the stones have come off and it's my second time wearing it.
4.0,I bought this as a gift for my daughter-in-law who is a nurse and she really seemed to like it.
4.0,Love the quality I wish I have ordered one size smaller
4.0,Bought it for my 16 year old. Nice set but didn't realize the earrings were so small. My one year old could wear them. I though she would complain about the size of the earrings but she said she can wear them in her second ear piercing. It all worked out in the end.
4.0,My daughter is in love with these. They fit her perfect. I got her normal shoe size.
4.0,"I wear a size 13 normally and these slippers feel a bit snug. However, I still use them occasionally and they're really comfortable. Great for using around the house, on your lazy days."
4.0,"We found the coated leather a bit stiff, I'm sure it will soften up in time...."
4.0,"So, not a small guy wear 38/40 waist or XL.  Originally ordered 2XL as reviews said go up a size, returned those they fit kind of ""painted on.""  Got the 3XL and they fit, a little narrow in the hips and slightly large in waist but use for work outs show they are good, but not a perfect fit.  Also, bought TBMPOY Men's Active Lightweight Elastic Waist Athletic Jogger Pace Shorts in 3XL and they are roomy so much so I should have ordered 2XL but had return fatigue.  Overall these are good shorts for the price and they do the job and note the TBMPOY 50% more expensive."
4.0,"shoeslocker Womens Ankle Boots Slip on Side V Cutout Pointed Toe Faux Leather Chunky Stacked Low Heel An<br />Size 9 - I normally wear a 9 or 9.5 shoe and the 9 fits perfectly.<br /><br />The shoes look great; however, the edges near the ankle are a bit rough and hurt without socks. Maybe they will soften up over time but initially the leather is hard and a bit rough on my skin. I really do like how they look, and with socks there is no problem. 4 stars! I am hoping they will soften up with time. Hope you find this review and pictures helpful. Cute with dresses."
4.0,"Liked the cross and chain was pretty and delicate, but, was very short.  No option for chain length."
4.0,Gift for my 13 year old son.  He loves basketball!
4.0,I love the dress but sizes run too small.
4.0,"Fit was a little snug, but the next size might have been too big."
4.0,I love the dress but it's too small around the middle. Clings. I thought it would have a wider swing. Will be returning reluctantly.
4.0,"The Joyours dress is very practical. It is black, so a neutral color.  It has a round collar and a layered skirt.  The sleeves are long, but don’t come to the wrist (so not really 3/4). This dress seems to run a little large. I ordered up but didn't need to. You can layer (with a denim jacket or blazer) and wear with heels or sandals. Overall this is a great dress that I will wear often."
4.0,I really like the handbag and the color but it was just a little too big for me.
4.0,"I love pink and I love ombre, so I bought this bag. Based on measurement though it was smaller than I thought it would be because it widens at the top and this is deceiving as to how much it can hold. I was going to return but decided to keep as a once-in-a-while cross body since all my others are even smaller than this."
4.0,"with it has an adjustable sound to it! When you play the games, it is sooooo loud!!!!!!!!<br />But child is a Frozen fan, so this was a hit!"
4.0,Perfect for keeping me stable on the mat. Excellent grip and the small size fit my size 6.5 feet perfectly. Also the stripes make me ridiculously happy!
4.0,These glasses look really nice in person. The polarized lenses are perfect. These glasses also fit pretty nicely on a small/medium sized face. Only critique would be that one of the lenses had a small indent on the top. For the price I can not complain but that indent definitely bugs me.
4.0,"Beautifully constructed. Love the black and teal. Classic look with a little pop of color. I really like the zippered change pocket on the back, but there's another zippered pocket inside and you can use that one for change too. There are an ample number of credit card slots and other spaces to store reward cards and receipts."
4.0,Daughter loves this product.  Fits very small so I had to do a little adjustment on it
4.0,"This is a neat ring.  For the price, very happy. Been wearing it everyday for a couple of weeks.  No issues.  Thinking of buying another from this company."
4.0,Got this for Halloween and it worked great for the night. It was very comfortable. The only issue is it is very light weight and therefore feels cheap.
4.0,I really liked it around my hips but it kept crossing too high over my chest to wear a tank under. I'm a 40D and I figured I'd be big enough to have some gapping. I'll give it 4 for softness and the overall fit. Really comfy.
4.0,"Soft, warm, well made. Fit well."
4.0,"Great product, the packaging looked very shady but the item is great!"
4.0,"These are really fun and cute, but they're a little small. They also seem to be a cheaper quality than the image shows here, but I still wear them pretty frequently. I like them a lot and they stay in really well."
4.0,This is a shorter than normal pareo. But it is very cute. You can wear it a number of ways and it can fit a number of sizes. Want that vacation feel? This will give it to you
4.0,I'm a curvy girl with a long torso so it wasn't as long as I'd hope for but I kept it... Not bad for the price.
4.0,Soles are a little on the thick side almost a platform style for toddler. I prefer a more thin and flexible sole for little feet to move and less of a trip hazard. Doesn't keep these on her feet yet but otherwise good for price.
4.0,"The sizes listed are UK sizes. I got the 34G thinking that was US size, but it's a US 34I. For anyone wondering, here's the sizing on the label for the bra listed as 34G: Australia 12G, Europe 75G, France 90G, UK 34G, USA 34I.<br /><br />It's a cute bra, true to color (the purple panther print), and the band size is true to size (34 as listed). I returned and re-purchased based on UK cup sizes, and it fits true to size.<br /><br />[Updated 9/9 to reflect re-purchase in proper UK size.]"
4.0,This toiletry bag is exactly what I needed to keep my luggage compact and neat.
4.0,"The suit is pretty well made and nice but it fits pretty small, so if you are even thinking about it, order a size up."
4.0,They are just the right size.  After awhile my ears start to hurt. I'm keeping them anyway  :)
4.0,Cute but unfortunately it ran small across the bust
4.0,"Used this for the first time today.  It was a little work to get into it, but I felt great swimming in it."
4.0,Got these for my elderly mother who didn't want to pay for prescription sunglasses.  They work great!  If she could just remember to take then with her when she goes outside.
4.0,"This is really great for a bargain priced mask. It looks pretty much identical to the picture. Overall well made. The mask fits a bit big however so this would probably be better suited to someone with a larger head as it’s got quite a lot of extra room. Would fit big on a kid. No strange mask smell. I’d recommend. Can’t get much better than this for the price. Will have to do some adjusting to get it to fit just right but after that, I’m sure it’ll be a hit. The hair looks good, the mask is creepy.( in a good creepy Micheal myers sort of way) Not bad at all. I am impressed considering the low price it’s listed at. Super affordable Micheal Myers mask for the win! Good luck! Happy Halloween! Thanks!"
4.0,"My wife liked it because of the RFID blocking. Good size, but zippers are hard to use."
4.0,I love these maxi dresses! So cute and with pockets!
4.0,"This item is very pretty and I am happy with what it looks like.  It's a Christmas gift for my mom, so I can't give much feed back since I'm not the one wearing it.  The peals are of a nice shape and color."
4.0,"had to return will be buying a med, sleeves are a bit long and cant roll up, my daughter loves this show.."
4.0,"Nice and sturdy, esp good if you are looking for a heavy keychain."
4.0,"I thought these looked cute, but was wowed when they arrived. They are larger than most threaders and make a great statement. My only problem was that one got caught in my hair and was lost the first time I wore them (they are so lightweight that I didn't notice). But, because of the great price and how much I loved the way they looked, I ordered another pair. This time I make sure to put backs on them!"
4.0,They were snug as far as width but the size was on point.
4.0,These are just alright. Check your local party store for better and less expensive options.
4.0,"A little tight around the arms, but other than that PERFECT fit. Great quality and a beautiful dress."
4.0,Pretty but odd fabric so doesn't flow as nice as others I've had that are the same style.
4.0,"This is the size I wanted as it fits in my pocket. Although it has enough slots for my use, these slots are VERY tight, I could barely fit my health card. Still, I like it and hope that the slots will loosen up a bit in time."
4.0,"Fit seems a little snug...but expect they will stretch out as worn. Have only just tried them on, not really worn them."
4.0,"They work, but I'm not sure how strong they really are. I have some doubts based on using one for a few days, but it hasn't broken yet."
4.0,"I really like the glasses. They are comfortable, stylish and I especially like the protection I get in the outdoors with the UV also they are polarized for added protection.<br />One thing I need to stress is I bought them because they had the added feature of the bifocal, but it isn't large enough I literally need to raise the glasses up to see if I 'm reading outdoors, not helpful at all."
4.0,"These tights are slightly thicker than stockings but made of the same material. They are snug fitting so it was a bit challenging getting them on but once I had them on it fit great. I'm 5'7"" and about 200lbs and the XL fit perfectly. They really do provide tummy control. As a postpartum mom with limited time to workout this feature is definitely appreciated. These tights aren't like your typical lazy wear around the house tights. These would work perfect for wearing under a dress to a club, church, work or anywhere that you need to look more dressy."
4.0,Cute little trinket. Great for a giveaway or grab bag
4.0,It was very large needed to return this.
4.0,Really cute glasses with fun Aztec patterned frame.  They are light weight and were a little big so I heated the arms with blow dryer and gently bent them.  They are now a perfect fit.
4.0,This is a great bag.  I really like it.  It is better than I expected.
4.0,"This is the sort of watch that will be noticed!<br />Some will love it, some will hate it and that is seen in these reviews.<br />Mixed reviews and for a good reason:<br /><br />This is a beautiful watch, design is awesome, weight is somewhat light but it doesn't feel plastic and that's because it's stainless steel. Not heavy, like some reviewers mention but it i think that makes this watch very confortable exactly because of that.<br /><br />At this price, i thought it was a good purchase, and i'm very happy with it.<br />Keeps good time, mine doesn't loose that many minutes as some said but this is not the kind of watch you look for accuracy, it's a fun watch to wear and in that case, it's very cool.<br />It's flashy, too much perhaps. I agree that this watch seems very ambitious since everyone will notice that golden ""thing"" in your wrist and it certainly seems like a expensive watch.<br /><br />It has indeed a chinese movement so this is not that great jewerly many were saying it should be but it's not expensive and as such i think people are beeing a bit harsh when saying this is not a high quality piece. You get what you payed for: a fun, cheap enough watch that looks awesome. Design is above all other qualities with this watch but that's ok for the price and i can't find anything like it anywhere! That's great! :) It is unique and impressive!<br />You will not find another watch in this price range that looks like this. Compact and nice to look at, perfect for parties! ;)<br /><br />Like our friend from Moscow says, be carefull when using the watch in dangerous places because it will atract attentions and seems very expensive. That could get you to be robbed with such a shiny thing in your wrist!<br /><br />Pointers are difficult to see in anything but good light but then again, you buy this watch for looks, not function. ;)<br />Not the easiest watch to wind because crown is too close to case but other than that, i have no complaints.<br />Nice to have in your collection unless you only like superior, non chinese watches.<br />Very happy with my purchase, seller was very fast in sending the watch and arrived in perfect condition. Like many said, the wooden box is a delight and i use it ( as manual describes ) to keep some of my unused watches."
4.0,"I like it because it is just a bit more compact than the run-of-the-mill cases.  It's stylishly done and has a nice clean look to it.  The red color is a nice contrast and makes it easier to find at the bottom of my bag. It snaps shut so just be sure your fingers are limber and fast not to be caught.<br /><br />My only complaint is the red strip is kinda lumpy.  Well, not enough to see if one is not looking for it, though.  Just me and my OCD. My guess is that it is due to the glue underneath.  Not a big deal but it would have been nice if it were smooth.  Taking away one star for that but all in all a good deal for the price."
4.0,These slides are comfortable out of the box and provide great quality for the price.
4.0,they stay on very good
4.0,Cute little bracelet. Thought it would be just a little larger than it was but it still looks cute on.
4.0,We loved it for Christmas but runs small. My daughter is 3 1/2 years old shes 38 pounds 3’4” inches I got a size up for her 4t-5t still was a little small but I kept it still I would go 2 sizes up a 5t-6t other than that its a nice dress 😃
4.0,"I love this baby poncho. I gave it four stars because it does not fit in the carseat while on baby as I hoped. BUT it is much easier to snap on and off than a real coat and lays on top of him like a blanket very nicely. It is thick and warm, perfect for running into the store with mom or watching his big siblings play outside when its chilly."
4.0,Fit great but where a little thinner than normal. Great light weight swim trunks.
4.0,I want to order in another color fits well in my chest area and waist.  Was a little skeptical I normally wear a 14-16 because of hips and chest and I ordered a 2x was almost thinking would need a 3x but 2x was perfect.  Thinking of getting red for the holidays.
4.0,Ideal for a party.
4.0,A little big on the top
4.0,I ordered black and this has way more white in it than black making it look grey. It appears lighter in person than in my picture. I do like the cover up it’s just not as dark as I wanted.
4.0,"For those who have a lot of piercings and go threw jewelry semi frequently from loosing the back or the gem from unscrewing, these are what you would expect. My only bad thought is, the dark rainbow gem just looks black unless you look close and move it in the light :/"
4.0,Cute sweatshirt that you could dresss up or down!
4.0,"It's a great color, nice size for neck. I chose it over the very large shawl &#34;scarfs&#34;, which were too large for the look I wanted. I recommend it."
4.0,"I wore this dress to a dinner date, sleeves were too short, besides that was an oaky dress fro the price."
4.0,I ordered a large because I am a size 10/12 in jeans but because this skirt already is a stretch material and is poofy I had to return it for a size small I have a smaller waist so to each his own.  I haven't received my size small back yet but so far the seller has been really professional and has responded to my messages properly
4.0,"I ordered a small when I should've gotten a medium (5'3"" 125 pounds). Other than that it's a sturdy made product and would've worked fine."
4.0,Cheep but cute. Kinda wish the chain was longer.
4.0,Cotton is harsh and not soft. Needs to wash it few times.
4.0,"The dress is super comfy! The best part is the top, it’s a good amount of padding, not too much but enough for you not to have to wear a bra with it. The only complaint I have is it’s not the color I was expecting. I got the “light blue one” and it can as more of a greenish blue. Other than that it’s a hoid"
4.0,"The light blue and dark blue combination color is my favorite. The other two are nice, but not my favorites. I recommend buying the trio. They can be mixed and matched with an abundance of outfits."
4.0,I love the way this fits and flows. It's very feminine and flattering. My only complaint is that it's VERY low cut.
4.0,"Great leggings especially for needing something warm under jeans for those really cold days. But be warned, do NOT PUT THEM IN THE DRYER! They will shrink. I wash and just hang to dry. The also bead up a bit after a couple wear/washes. But I just wear them at home or under jeans. Love the high waistband and so comfy."
4.0,Cute. This style is not the most comfortable but it’s good for what it is.
4.0,A little bit bigger than expected otherwise they’re ok
4.0,"The first time I wore it, one of the straps ripped right out. The vinyl eye shield is kinda blurry, not super clear/easy to look through. But once I fixed the war strap, it served its purpose."
4.0,"Very good bra. Adhesive has worn down rather quickly though. So if you can deal with a little unstickyness around the edges, I recommend."
4.0,"Product came early. Its a nice watch. purchased for my son, but its a really huge watch the band feels like plastic. But for the price its cool.."
4.0,Looks nice and fits well.  Riding has been good so far.
4.0,"Love this seller! I'm always happy with their products. They come well packaged, are well made and look great."
4.0,Fits nicely! Arrived as expected.
4.0,"The sheepskin leather Potopok winter gloves are great gloves! They are great for every day use, are sensitive to electronic touch [screens] and are incredibly soft. The Potopok winter gloves have a great grip and they fit both women's and men's hands comfortably."
4.0,"Its had a good finish, it fits very well. Will use it and see how it handles marks and dulls from useage"
4.0,"I liked the glasses, they are alittle large, but work well for my needs.  I use them for computer glasses<br />instead of my regula glasses for work."
4.0,Super cute and fun. Only 4 stars because it is a bit small and comes off of my head easily.
4.0,I like three colors I change the clip when I want different colors.
4.0,"havnt gotten to test it yet, so not sure how durable it is. Appears to be made well. will definitely keep your face warm. Fits comfortably, almost too snug though"
4.0,"It is beautiful, a nice and shiny silver, has some weight to it which I think is good, and does not seem cheap at all. Only I'm not sure where the extra battery is (if it's in the item itself or a separate battery is sent along with it) but other than that it is a nice beautiful piece which I do plan on wearing."
4.0,"The jacket fits great in the body. The sleeves are too long though. I don't have this problem with my other jackets or shirts so I'm sure it's the jacket. Nice leather. I really like it but I don't know if I'm gonna keep it because of the sleeves. :(  For people trying to determine ttheir size, I'm 5'5"", 125 lbs, with a 38C bust"
4.0,It's a beautiful dress. I received so many compliments. But it runs small. And I wanted it to touch the floor.
4.0,Bottoms fit as expected but top gapped around the underneath as if the elastic wasn't doing its job.
4.0,Works great... but the title and description is listed as cute. It’s a baking black Pokemon gotcha holder ... there is nothing cute about it...
4.0,"Mostly cotton which I love and soft, doesn’t wrinkle and fits me perfectly!  I really like it as it is flattering and pretty."
4.0,We ordered this for a pageant. This fits my 6 year old who's in size 6/7 PERFECTLY! The length goes right above her shoes so she can show off her heals. The quality is a lot better than I expected as well! The only downfall to this order was this dress was not anywhere close to the mint green it looks in the picture is is more of a teal blue. My daughter still loved it though!
4.0,"A bit smaller than expected, but still awesome!"
4.0,The shoe is cute but I had some issues with the size. Ds will eventually grow into them and the shoes match a lot of his clothes so I am keeping them😌
4.0,"this was super cute, but the ends wouldn't stay tight so I constantly had to make sure they didn't fall off."
4.0,It is not easy to get into or out of<br />I am thinking that an underarm side zipper opening would add some ease to the garment making it easier to get into and out of. Otherwise its very nice.
4.0,"Love the glasses, but as nice as they are they came in a POUCH and not a CASE. I find that most of the men’s shades come in a hard case 90% of the time. Change that and I give this product 5 stars."
4.0,My son loves them. And the were the only &#34;boy&#34; color that I could find.  He is a tall 4 year old and the wings r a little to big for his arm reach but he loves playing with them
4.0,"Great top, very flowy.  Only wish is that it was a touch a longer in the front, but ok with high waisted pants."
4.0,"This is exactly what I thought I was getting... great price. I bought a few different necklaces at the same time and it seemed the shipping took forever, but you can't beat the price."
4.0,"Sorry, the pads in this bra do remove.  It's a fine bra made in China."
4.0,"I love the product; but, the delivery was unexpected.  They made 3 attempts before delivery was made on 10/26/21.  I am keeping the item and will not need a refund."
4.0,"The Dress had wonderful fabric material very cute and flattering the only thing is the neckline does come down very far, I would have like it more if it didn’t have as low of a cut I am 5’6 148 pounds and I got a size medium for reference :) hope this helps"
4.0,"Good quality, very soft, and flattering"
4.0,"The buttons aren't functional. Its velcro and if you have larger breasts, please order a size or two up or the velcro will pop open and you will have flashed Santa, a line full of children, and their dads with cellphone cameras out and ready."
4.0,"I absolutely loved the color of this bag. I hated to return it but it won't fit much more than a cell phone and keys, unfortunately."
4.0,I like these they are light weight and comfortable
4.0,"Comfy but ""leather"" looks cheap to me."
4.0,But cute.
4.0,"I bought this dye for some supposedly &#34;ivory&#34; shoes that turned out to be quite white. Another customer complained that the ivory dye is &#34;darker than ivory,&#34; but I would say it is merely a darker shade of ivory than she was expecting. Someone also complained that it removes the shine; this is a very valid criticism, though any &#34;dye&#34; that can change the color of synthetics will probably do that, I'm guessing. Synthetics don't really dye, and this is kind of more of a paint; based on the consistency I believe it has a latex component to it. A bit of sparkle does still come through, but from a distance they now look like they might be leather rather than satin. This is okay with me, but be aware of it. Also note that any part of the shoe that is not satin--for instance, the &#34;leatherette&#34; interior of my shoes--will not take this dye. Again, not a problem for me but something to be aware of.<br /><br />I have included photos so you can see the difference in color and shine."
4.0,Definitely a value!
4.0,Zipper us difficult.  Coat for as expected and is warm.  I live near Buffalo NY so cold and snow are a given!  Coat keeps me warm even with windchill below zero. Gets a 4 because of difficult zipper.
4.0,"Went with the size chart...and shouldn't have.  Got a XL US size 8.  I'm a size 10, so I thought it would be small.  Nope- it fits like a US XL!  And evn with washing and drying, it didn't shrink!  But I've gotten so many compliments on it!"
4.0,"I read the reviews before purchasing! I would usually wear between small to medium I decided to purchase an extra large due to the reviews. Fit perfect for how I intend on wearing it, tucked into my pants or shirt."
4.0,Very thin but makes you look thin so it is worth wearing a coat outside to me. I liked it so much I now own the blue and grey. I'm sure it would be a great workout top of I did that. But I have ordered a few yoga tunics and this has been the only one I've kept.
4.0,The piercing is nice but you will lose the rubber bands asap
4.0,These charms was the best ever. My friends love them as gifts.
4.0,Very pretty and a great price. The wrap is a little stiff but the fur is very soft and will more than serve it's purpose.
4.0,A little small in breast area.
4.0,The sandal has a good instep and helps with your arch.  Recommended for those with problems.
4.0,Good looking heavy and big pen. It's a very wet writer and I like that. Looks much more expensive than it is. The shirt clip however is quite thin and flimsy and feels very likely yo break at the at the slightest mishandling.
4.0,"Initially they sent me the wrong color.. pink instead of black. The pink set was really pretty, but not what I was looking for so I returned it and waited for my black pair.  When the black ones arrived, the box it came in was in a much worse condition than the pink pair. So definitely a good thing that this wasn’t a gift!<br /><br />The black pair’s coloring was a lot more green and brown than black when in good lighting. But overall I’d still say it’s a nice set of clover studs, and appears a lot more expensive than they are. It came with a pair of rubber backings as well as a pair of metal backings, which was a nice surprise."
4.0,"Very figure flattering, however it’s very thin. I’ll wear something underneath on cooler days."
4.0,"its a very nice ring, with a great meaning. it's like a promise ring for your girlfriend/fiance/wife... i just hope it fits my girlfriend because it only comes in size 6."
4.0,Great fit very dark glasses.
4.0,"super cute, the color is great but the needle of the smaller flower pin is wonky and seems as if it would fall off . sort from that it’s good"
4.0,This is a printed image on a sweater might find something with a bit more texture for the price. It good the job done
4.0,"Fit well, check measurements. Denim is soft and has just enough strength. Good pocket placement. Looks good with heels , ankle boots or flats etc. Ordered these in 3 colors now!"
4.0,"They seem ok except that they are too small and other large football pants fit my son. He was not comfortable in these and they were too short, didn't cover his knees!"
4.0,"Loved this dress although I could not lift my arms all the way above my head, it's still a perfect dress for the season."
4.0,"I am a boxer briefs guy, but decided to give these traditional briefs a try.  They are actually very comfortable and seem to be pretty good quality for the price.  My only criticism is that out of the 5 pack, one of the pair were noticeably smaller than the other 4.  The tag SAYS they're the same size, but they aren't.  The one pair crushes my balls.  So I gave 4 stars for 4 perfect pair of undies, and left one star off for the ball crushers."
4.0,Logo around the top of the band was too many characters to go all the way around.  Merchant promptly reached out to make it right.
4.0,Shoe came as described.
4.0,Band is very pretty and top it off for the price it came with a 1year warranty. Downside to it comes big but you can take links out and it also comes with a tool to do so. The tool isn’t the greatest but it works!
4.0,"Good product, I air-dry to prevent shrinkage.  Wish they made similar product with a longer cuff to  come up higher on the ankle"
4.0,Look great and doesn’t  aggravate my skin when I wear them. Took months and months and months past the expected date to get them.
4.0,"I am 5'3"", 150 lbs, 39/32/42 and ordered a medium. It fit well overall, although it did stretch a little over my bust. I am two months postpartum and the drape and pattern of the fabric camouflaged my belly well. The way the dress is cut, you could absolutely use this as a maternity dress, too. The fabric is very soft and stretchy. Because the pattern is printed on the fabric (rather than dyed), the design becomes lighter when the fabric is stretched beyond a certain point and the white base underneath the print becomes visible. This happened over my bust, but as you can see in the picture it wasn't bad enough to be super noticeable. The sash on the dress is sewn to the right side, so you don't have to worry about losing it in the wash or fiddling with belt loops. The bottom hem has a faux wrap detail, and the sleeves are tulip-cut, which was a nice touch. The neckline is fairly plain and rests high on the chest, but a statement necklace would help make the neckline more interesting. Overall, it is a very soft, comfortable, modest dress that I will absolutely add to my wardrobe!"
4.0,Están muy bonitos todas a mi hijo le van a encantar! Solo 1 venía rota la negra del orificio para amarrar la cual pues no servirá. Llego a tiempo todo. Gracias!
4.0,"We get TONS of compliments on these shoes. We both them for our kiddo who was in a play and they are a bit wide and large but he wears them with thick socks. Everyone LOVES him in these shoes. He said they are comfortable, too."
4.0,Very nice watch. Would have been better to have a rose gold clasp to match watch.
4.0,"very moisture wicking, will not get soaked in sweat after a long workout. Only complaint is it is not that warm."
4.0,"Its cute and I love it. How it was shipped was kinda dumb, and I thought it was a clamp. But other then that's I love it"
4.0,Nice tux shoes
4.0,It would of been  nicer if it was an 8 inch or 10 inch instead of being a 6 inch pin up
4.0,Super cute with great quality!  Just a little too small on the shirt.  May want to order a size up to be safe! I wish my daughter could have used this more than just once!  Don’t dry the shirt you really will be mad!
4.0,Flows well and fits well
4.0,Expect to iron this in order to get the look in the picture...otherwise it's very crinkled.
4.0,I have a big head so I own a hat stretcher and it fits fine now. I would recommend if you don't have a problem buying one off the shelf that fits like I do.
4.0,Just don't like how long it is they roll up
4.0,Good workout shorts. I bought with the 2 in 1 so I would not have to wear too much clothing in my workouts. Fits fine. It does ride up at times and dislike the zipper in the back. You can feel it when you are on back/butt is on the floor.
4.0,Just needs a longer chain.  My daughter lost her son this year and I put his picture inside.
4.0,"I really wanted to like this shirt. It’s actually really cute but not what I expected. The pictures made it look like a bleach stained, baggy, cotton tshirt. I like my shirts a little baggy and this was more fitted. It’s also not a traditional cotton tshirt. It reminds me of a dry fit material. The bleach stain isn’t a bleach stain, it’s more of a printed design. I’ll probably give it to a friend instead of returning it because it is cute and I’m sure someone will like it. It’s just not what I was looking for."
4.0,Well the top was too tight in the medium but bottoms fit good.  In the large the top fit good but the bottoms really large.
4.0,I loved it. Was the perfect birthday outfit!!
4.0,"Very light, Like it."
4.0,"got this for my boyfriend but it did not fit his foot, so now I have new socks and they fit my feet as expected and I wear a size 8"
4.0,Makes packing simple
4.0,I got a size too small but it holds everything in tact. I love the pockets and it’s breathable and I can stil stretch
4.0,"Very nice product . . . old boots now look really new! It does tend to make your boots darker and brings out the color of the leather . . . so if you don't like a spit shine, don't use it."
4.0,This cover was much nice than I thought it would be.  I bought it as a temporary cover for my Bible until I have a custom sewn one made but now I think I will stick with this one!  It's sturdy and the inside fabric is really cute (kind of an abstract polka dot).  My only critique is that the inside is a little loose and floppy and the things I've put in the pockets tend to slide around a bit but that's not even that bothersome.
4.0,"Crystal clear, much better than the glasses I bought at the local job lot.  I'm slightly farsighted so I use these for distance vision.  Frame hinges are a bit stiff."
4.0,"I order this and it was amazing for my cosplay! It fit me larger then expected but I like it oversized. The quality isn’t good but it’s for cosplaying, overall it’s very good."
4.0,Very good cost/bennefit
4.0,"This shirt looks aweaome on my son!! I wasn't sure what he would think about it (being a teenager),  but he was thrilled! It fits great and he can use it for working out! I only gave it 4 stars as it is slightly see through...but to use it for working out isn't a big deal for him."
4.0,Cute an helps to block the blue lights and helps reduce light from uv. My daughter wears them all day to ease the pressure of overhead lights in classrooms.
4.0,"Great top. It is a little long but it is also little bigger than expected. Order down a size. Beautiful color and nice fabric. Unlike a few others I have purchased, which were so thin they were almost sheer, this fabric was covered nicely. Perfect for work or casual. Over a skirt, leggings or even dress slacks."
4.0,The color is not as shown on the picture.  Now I wanted to buy another color in the same size but that's not part of Amazon prime.
4.0,I really like the style and the elegance
4.0,It'seems alright.
4.0,"So far so good, but they do let a lot of wind in. Nice looking and fit is good. Appreciate the great cleaning cloth."
4.0,"Rhodochrosite calls one's twin soul, their eternal lover. It's a must for someone in love OR someone who hopes to be."
4.0,"I loves this ring! This is my second time purchasing it! The 1st one tarnished fast, but my friends told me I should have polished it! So I bought another with the intent to polish it! I received so many compliments despite the fading!"
4.0,I just love this little blouse.  It looks just like the picture and is very comfy.  I am 5’3” and weigh 200lbs.  I’m pretty large in the bust area and the 2XL fits me perfectly!<br /><br />If I were to make one tiny complaint it is that I prefer my blouses to be just a little longer but…I really am happy with this and even ordered different colors!
4.0,"The hat is good looking,well made and appropriate for a young girl.  Neutral color makes a great accessory for many outfits."
4.0,A little too small for size 10 shoe
4.0,Great price fast delivery
4.0,"I bought this hat so I can wear it at a lady gaga concert and it's overall a great hat! It came in fast, the colour matches the picture. The only downside to the hat was I had to remove the gold thing on the hat so it can actually fit my head."
4.0,It's nice<br />wish it was more adjustable to smaller wrists
4.0,My son and his friend really liked their key chain.
4.0,Does not make me feel as sexy as I thought. Seems a little too loose in the waist.
4.0,Love this shirt! The material is a little rough but I'm hoping it softens after a wash or two. If it does I'll change it to 5 stars. Lots of compliments at the last Packers game!
4.0,Nice.  I like that you don't have that &#34;lump&#34; in the ball of my foot that I would normally have with ballet shoes.
4.0,"[Reviewed by Julie] These Panvbo No Show socks are very soft and comfortable. As advertised, they do hide out of the way inside the shoe, and the rubberized strips inside the sock at the back of the heel do a good job of preventing the sock from slipping down off my heel. I took away a star because they are a little large for my foot. I have a small foot (I wear size 5-1/2 shoe), but am generally fine with standard size 9-11 socks. And these socks are fine until I put on a shoe. The extra material (for my small foot) bunches up toward the heel, but the rubberized strips that hold the top of the heel in place prevent the sock from moving up my ankle, so it just bunches up underneath my heel. I can adjust it while putting on my shoe, but it’s a slight bother that I don’t have to deal with in other sock styles. For most people, though, I’m sure this isn’t a problem, so wear them in good health!"
4.0,I can't sew for nothing. This gadget puts buttons on shirts quickly and easily.
4.0,"Just what I wanted for my best friend but it came with Winnie the pooh charms??? That was not advertised but I make jewelry so ill just pull the charms off with my pliers. But other then that i love the saying, perfect for my best friend who moved"
4.0,Nice looking shoe. Comfortable to step in. Unfortunately the straps were not tight enough to keep the sandal on my foot. Too bad they don't make half sizes because I wear a 10 and a 9.5 may have worked better.
4.0,"I purchased these swim goggles by Splash Pro 2016 to use when swimming in the pool at the new life center my family joined. I have been highly impressed by the quality of these goggles, as I did not expect too much because of the reasonable pricing. I swim several times a week for exercise, and since indoor pools sometimes have an overwhelming chemical presence, I wanted to protect my eyes. I have been very pleased with the comfort when wearing the swim goggles, as well as how easy it is to adjust the size. I purchased the swim goggles with grey accents, and how found that these are the perfect unisex style and color.I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest product review. All thoughts and opinions regarding these swim goggles are my own."
4.0,The mask is high quality and well constructed. The issue is that there is no real scale in the photos... this would be better suited to a child than an adult.
4.0,"Tried on 9 swimsuits in the last 2 weeks. Only kept 2 and this was one!! Fits as expected, the peep hole is cute and not too much! I was worried because I am often challenged finding tops that fit my 34DDD without having spillage or cutting or being way way too big and this one fit!!"
4.0,Okay cross-body wallet.  Not the best leather but for that price it is okay.  I was hoping it was a little larger but I think it will hold everything I need.  Outer pocket does fit my Iphone 6 (with case).
4.0,i like it a lot im very glad that i bought it
4.0,I didn’t like the material very much but only time will tell how well it holds up. It did fit as expected and there is a few ways to wear it which makes it a versatile dress.
4.0,"Great sunglasses. Solid, should last."
4.0,The shirts arrived on time and I was really happy what I saw....they fitted perfect.....look great....sharp looking....now for the big test....lets see what happens when I wash them....stay tune
4.0,"I always buy oversized, loose, baggy sweaters and tunics.  This Tournesol Women's Long Sleeve Color Block Tunic does not disappoint.  I'm 5'5 180lbs and I got the large.  I really like the fit for me, loose and soft and comfortable, great for the office."
4.0,"I’m usually a medium but ordered a large glad I did, if I shrink these in the dryer they would not fit at all. 5’6” 145lb the fabric gets static-y so put on some lotion or get some static guard. Somewhat see through so you’ll need to wear nude underwear with them"
4.0,These work great for the early morning and night driving with the clouds and rain
4.0,Very nice and heavy. Great details. Only the chain is to weak for this peace. I paid a lot and don't want to lose it so I replaced the chain with a leather strip and tied it on. I don't take it off. It holds up great in the shower. I've had it for awhile and still looks great
4.0,"Received these glasses and while removing the packaging noticed that they where already scratched on the End Pieces and close to the Temples.<br />Called Amazon and received a refund had to return to seller via UPS. Unfortunately they did not offer a replacement since it is out of stock.<br /><br />Love the glasses they have a great fit, color is nice, fit is good and the polarization is cool.<br /><br />I ordered 2 pairs while they had a lightning deal glad I did because the wine colored ones arrived in good condition.<br />But I really wanted the black ones they just look better on me.<br /><br />I would recommend these glasses for the price and great stylish look."
4.0,"Great product. Nice finish, well polished and a true tribute to the famous King's sunglasses. A great way to make a (maybe funny) impression!"
4.0,It looks and feels nice.  It's a little small for holding much but it can hold a few bills and cards.
4.0,"The material is very comfortable, with a soft and stretchy feel. It fits well and is figure-flattering. I like the design (the funnel neck), which gives it a unique look."
4.0,"Very comfortable, versatile, and easy to wash and wear."
4.0,Love it but wish it was lined.
4.0,"Very nice watch, and it looks so elegant for such a good price."
4.0,The only thing I minded with this dress was the pockets were totally useless. Due to the fabric being so soft if you put anything in the pocket it causes the pocket to droop down. Would be perfect a nice color purple everyday dress if they left out those pockets.<br />I got complements while I had the dress on. The color is a very pretty clear purple.
4.0,Good seemed a little big
4.0,Bracelets are very nice! Tricky to get them off. Practice first before you put it on.  Slight odor but you have to put it right to your nose to notice it.
4.0,"Super soft material, however it is a little on the short side."
4.0,Bought as a gift for my mother-in-law. She loved them.
4.0,My husband really likes these Locs. Identical to the ones I lost. Could be a little darker on the tint.
4.0,"good size, feels comfortable"
4.0,"I've ordered these straps before and love them! However, the color states teal green and this is definitely blue."
4.0,"I am very pleasantly surprised by this shirt!  I ordered it because I need a long gray top to wear with a costume on character day at school (I'm going to be Gerald the Elephant from the Elephant and Piggie books by Mo Willems -- big ear, trunk and all...only for my kindergarteners would I EVER dress as an elephant!) and I need something to cover my rump while I am wearing gray leggings.  The shirt comes down below my backside and fits well everywhere.  It is as roomy as you would expect a top like this to be.  I will probably wear a long sleeve grey shirt under it because the sleeves are a little too short for me and show a big more arm than I would like - partially because I am very cold natured, but mostly because I am not crazy about my arms.  I think it would also look great with a cardigan over it.  If there were a tad length in the sleeve I would have given this shirt 5 stars.  I have a couple of the Lularoe Irmas and this shirt is comparable to those, but I actually like this material better AND it is much more affordable!  I have only tried it on, but it feels light and like it will breathe well.  I am usually a xl/xxl, so I ordered the xxl to make sure it is roomy enough, so I would say that this is true to size.  (picture of shirt worn with elephant costume to be added after character day!)"
4.0,So pretty and looks so rich in color and look in the gold. Extremely happy with this purchase and I wear it all the time I shower and never take it off and it has held its color and no tarnish since I got it. Extremely happy
4.0,I received lots of compliments on these. I bought them for a Halloween costume but like them so much I still wear them on occasion. The hooks are cheap metal and I would not recommend these for anyone with sensitive skin.
4.0,"Cute, a little cheapy but It's a good small gift for someone."
4.0,Purchased as a gift and were very well received.
4.0,The bottoms fit well and if you pull the top really tight it stays pretty good .
4.0,"I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by these compression socks.  Usually I can't wear socks like this because they are far too tight and uncomfortable, however with these socks the compression factor was a lot less, this meant that my legs felt somewhat compressed but blood was still able to flow freely.  Also there were no harsh lines left by over compression.  The heart design is nice and appealing and they do look rather well with some casual shoes.  The only thing is that they are warm socks even though thin, so great for autumn days but not summer ones."
4.0,The pants are comfy.  Attractive.  Recommend
4.0,I love this except it needs to be three inches longer!!! I’m pretty slender and 5’10. I ordered a small because I didn’t want the chest to be baggy. the top perfect but the length is too short.. especially when sitting. I’ll still wear this but I’m so sad it’s not a little bit longer.
4.0,"The product arrived quickly, the fit was as described.  The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that the material is a little thin.  I will definitely wear s slip under it so no one can see through the white in the sun light."
4.0,They are perfect for on the computer or using a smart phone helps protect my eyes
4.0,Great feel but a little smaller than I expected.
4.0,"Are as advertised, would recommend them"
4.0,"Nice necklace. I've bought a few items now from this seller. Great price, but the necklaces are a bit stiff. I suppose they'll loosen up a bit after a lot of wear, but I don't wear Pearl's every day."
4.0,"I love the fabric and the feel of it on my skin, it was just a bit smaller than I was expecting.  But still love it."
4.0,Kept me in place. Did not hurt when taking off.
4.0,"Fits as expected. Not the most flattering for a plus size woman but it gets the job done and I got lots of compliments on it. The one caution that I would give is that if you have fibromyalgia, by the end of the work day you will be quite uncomfortable. Polyester and rayon are uncomfortable against the skin."
4.0,Love the design -the latch  is so very small and therefore somewhat difficult but manageable.
4.0,"Wear them everytime I work. ER nurse and I am on my feet a lot, my feet don't hurt as much anymore."
4.0,"I love these leggings! I am 5""3' 144 lbs of mostly muscle and ordered a size small. These are definitely squat proof. I have the ombre dark grey to light grey. The fabric around the waste is thick and very supportive/compressing and the fabric along the legs is of a thinner material but breathable. Yet again, SQUAT PROOF. My only issue was the consistency of the seams in the inner thigh. The inner seam on the left leg was very comfortable but on the right leg it tended to pull in a weird direction. Definitely a good buy either way!"
4.0,"I enjoy wearing this blouse, it is comfortable. It is exactly as pictured."
4.0,"I liked the style, the support and general fit, however, the shoes were a bit loose on my heels, which I do not like, and for that reason had to return. May work well for other folks."
4.0,"Super cute dress that I got for my 11-year-old.  Size 14 fits perfectly except the arm holes are a little big so her cami shows through.  Since she has a pink one, I think we will keep it.  Design is adorable, super bright and great for spring!"
4.0,"I'm giving this 4 stars even though I need to return it. I don't know how I ordered a small, I'm a medium in most things but most of the time when purchasing on Amazon I have to size up. The small actually fit, but it was just too small for me to be comfortable in. I'm REALLY disappointed it is out of stock, or not in more colors or patterns because I'd probably buy 5 of them."
4.0,Fit just as expected.
4.0,perfect for summertime!!
4.0,I like the weight but runs a little small. Wish I'd ordered a 2XL.
4.0,Nice wallet. So far it's holding together.
4.0,The sleeves are too long for me so I have to fold them under. Otherwise it's a very comfy top and I had several compliments on it today.
4.0,"Product as described, timely delivery"
4.0,"These are kind of like the perfect base layer for so many outfits with a flattering fit. After receiving, I just wore them and they fit fine. The neck area was a little wider than I was expecting but still wearable. I was also expecting the red shirt to be more red but it’s more of a burgundy/wine color."
4.0,I like the shape & color
4.0,"I was hoping the material would be a bit thicker as I was purchasing it for a midwest winter hat (I wasn'texpectingthe mittens to be snow friendly as they are flece). Still the product is cute, soft and will stay put on my child's head. The mittens fit well too!"
4.0,"Great quality, wore it to a wedding it was comfy and classy."
4.0,Print looks good. Bright colors.
4.0,Very cute dress. Seems like it would be flattering on most shapes.
4.0,Nice color. A little big.
4.0,I don't remember buying this and don't remember who I bought it for
4.0,"I'm 5' 5-1/2"" tall, 36C, 135 pounds. I got the small/medium, and it's a really snug fit (it shows my rolls and my belly button). It is a very nice top though, and I'm sure it'll look great on me when I finally get in shape. If you like a looser fit, go up a size."
4.0,"I love the look, feel and functionality."
4.0,"As a prescription glasses wearer I wanted a helmet with a visor so I could wear either my regular or my sun glasses. I ride at pretty good speeds so like the air and bugs being kept from my eyes especially since I do a lot of city commuting/riding. Helmet is comfortable, easy to adjust and lightweight."
4.0,i have a small head and this is too small even for me. Otherwise it's good.
4.0,Great price. Wish it was a bit longer.
4.0,"Really happy with this tank! I ordered a 2X and so happy I did as this top runs a bit small, so size up. Haven't washed it yet so not sure how it will hold up.  Arm holes are NOT big, which I was expecting them to be. I am going to purchase a few more tanks!"
4.0,"I think they run pretty big.  I now have 3, first one I ordered was much too big and the armholes are gigantic.  Ordered 2 more one size down.  Still to big.  I think I will order a 4th another size down.  As many others have said, it is a bit longer than I would like.  Lace on red is a bit more scratchy than black but they are both pretty comfortable after a few washings.  Holding up well.  I have had them for several months and just throw them in the wash and dryer with everything else.  WARNING:  wash a few times before wearing (at least the red and black)  the dye will rub onto your light sheets.  Fortunately it washed out of the sheets."
4.0,I'm 5'2&#34; 170 40AAA typically wear 1X<br />Fabric/construction was fine.  Cute dress.  Was a bit small for me.  Think I ordered wrong size.
4.0,Nice glasses . Good quality and it fits great for me . Packaging on the other hand was bad. There was no box to protect the glasses just a plastic wrap in a bubbled envelope . Thankfully was not broken .
4.0,PROS<br />- Nice design<br />- Nice aged color<br />- The interior looks good<br /><br />CONS<br />- The chain looks as poor quality
4.0,"THIS DRESS RUNS VERY SMALL. I cannot stress that enough. I am a 12/14, 38DD and ordered a 3XL. Other than that, I really like the dress. I purchased the green one and it's almost identical to the picture. The only real complaint I have it the drawstring: it's like a sweatshirt drawstring. Wish it was little more dainty but I guess the sturdiness will make it last longer. All in all Inwoukd recommend"
4.0,I love the shades can't wait to wear them when it's that time again.
4.0,Construction seems to be pretty good.  Mom's care-giver seemed rather pleased with the gift.
4.0,"Great hat! Wore it on the beach this summer and at the pool. It would try to fly off my head if the wind got strong. It would be nice if it stayed on my head a little better,but that is probably true of this style of hat."
4.0,"Comfortable, though not as much as others."
4.0,I do like the PJs and the color is great! I am a size 14 and I am 5'9&#34;. I bought an XL and they fit well. .<br /><br />My only complaint is: the shorts are a bit longer than they appear in the picture.
4.0,"I am 5'8&#34; and 140 lbs. The LARGE is too small at my 30&#34; waist. By about 1-2&#34;. Tried to return, but since this came from China, the seller negotiated a refund, since there is not a larger size. The skirt is awesome, and could be worn year-round. Fabric is not as heavy as denim, but could be paired with tight,s boots and sweater in winter.  I love the length - almost to my ankles. Perfect! Maybe I should just lose 6-8 pounds, hmmm?"
4.0,Nice for Halloween
4.0,Like most shirts advertised as “soft” it is incredibly “thin”.<br />Can see a light bulb shine right through both sides of shirt at once.<br />Feels like wearing clingy nylon.. not for me.
4.0,This is a cute & fun addition to my swim suit but it is very large.  I'm a size 14 & have a hard time keeping it on my shoulders because it's so big.  It's made to be big & flowy...it is manageable but I do wish it was a little narrower in the shoulders
4.0,"These rings are amazing! They are beautiful and they fit perfectly in my cartilage piercing. The only drawback I have for this product is sometimes the rings like to unscrew themselves so I had to buy these babies again. But, the second pairs don't unscrew at all."
4.0,"These fasteners are take a little more getting used to than the Snappi's. I cut myself a few times on the teeth :(. But, they work great keeping nappies in place, look cute, and are a great price!"
4.0,Looks fantastic on my finger.  Too early to tell if it will fade or anything but will give an update if it does.  So far it is a great ring.
4.0,"The only thing that i don't like about the earrings is they tarnish fast but other than I love them. They make it  look like my ears are pierce, I buy all sizes."
4.0,Glad I listened to other reviews and went a<br /> Size up. Runs a little small
4.0,I liked that it was long enough for me.  I am 5-8 and sometimes it is hard to find a dress that will be long enough.
4.0,"The buckle needs to be a little left of center so it doesn't accidentally release if you are a ""softer"" body type. Other than that, this belt is excellent."
4.0,Will work perfect for what I need.<br />Material is very thin and jacket is a tad snug for being a 2x
4.0,"It looks great! The Dream Warriors glove was exactly what I was looking for. The fit is a little bit weird, the metal plates line up a bit wonky for the glove's finger movement but it is a display prop, after all."
4.0,Quality of glasses seems ok but gems are misaligned and just look raggedy.
4.0,"The outfit is very cute and fit well.  Perfect for her mermaid themed gymnastics birthday party.  Unfortunately, though, the plastic piece that lets you adjust the length of the straps had sharp edges that irritated my daughter's skin."
4.0,"Love having pockets on this dress, it flows well. It’s a bit long but heels will take care of that."
4.0,A very nice bag to take on job interviews.  It protects the important papers and I can also keep my purse items in it. There are  2 compartments besides the center which is meant for the laptop.  One side has two pockets and a zippered pouch which is good for storing pens and business cards.  It would fit a small laptop or tablet. It doesn't fit my 10&#34;x15&#34; laptop
4.0,"They are a bit on the thin side, but I really like them! The fit is spot on, or large. Being large out of the package makes me not worry I've sticking them in the dryer. 4 star only because I was expecting them to be thicker."
4.0,this was a nice 1 selection of gloves for me 3-5 year old grandchildren who are always losing one or both gloves. made nice stocking stuffers and extra stay at Grandma's house.
4.0,Cute box holds everything
4.0,I thought it would've fit a bit small so i ordered a size up and it was too big. However the material of the jacket and pants were of good quality the shirt was a but flimsy
4.0,Very large bag.
4.0,"It's a nice t-shirt and made well and the graphics are stable and well done.  I usually get large when t-shirts are 100% cotton, wash them and they fit perfect.  These, after two washings, still wear like a large that's unwashed.  So, the quality is there but the size dropped it a star, particularly around the neck."
4.0,"The dress was very nice, but seemed very tight around the shoulders/armpits area. I would have loved putting a crinoline under it to make it more full! But I it was too late to order one. I wore this for my rehersal."
4.0,Thay fit nice
4.0,"This is a really cute crop sweatshirt. I love wearing it with leggings especially. The tiny pinky promise design in the corner is really sweet as well. I will say it's a little bit thinner in terms of the material than I was expecting and not quite as finished on the inside, but it's not scratchy at all and I really like the overall look."
4.0,"Keeps feet wonderfully warm especially on cold floors! My granddaughters wear them all day until their bed time. They are so, so soft!"
4.0,"Beautiful dress made from a simple fabric but does not look cheap and is very well made. Returning it just because the style does not look flattering on my body type. I always shied away from mermaid style dresses and I was right. It accentuated my hips in a bad way making me look bigger and bulkier. The dress does have a stretch to it so it hugged all my curves (Specially my mid lower section). I am 5,3, weigh around 136 pounds and I ordered the Medium. The length was perfect while wearing 3 inch heels."
4.0,"CONSTRUCTION &amp; SET-UP<br />-These swim goggles came packaged a hinged acrylic case that was easy to open and close<br />-There was no discernable odor or off-putting smell when these goggles were received<br />-The goggles are lightweight and come with a silicone seal to help maintain suction to keep these goggles on your face<br />-The goggles are adjustable by pulling on the straps<br />-The lens have a light tint to them and are mildly reflective, but not in a mirror-like finish as other swim goggles<br /><br />WHAT I LIKE<br />-Stylish (but that is a personal preference)<br />-Lightweight swim goggles do not add significant weight when used for swimming or other activities<br />-Suction is reasonable and goggles are fairly comfortable to wear, even when straps are adjusted to stay on face tightly..  I wouldn't say they are the most comfortable pair of swim goggles I've owned, but the silicone used to help create the facial seal is soft<br />-Light tinting is nice (but I'm not sure if these offer UV protection even if the product description claims &quot;100% sun protection&quot;)<br />-Comes with acrylic case that can be reused<br /><br />WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE<br />-Construction is average.  I agree with a previous reviewer that the front rubber seems a bit unfinished and unpolished.<br />-There are arrows that can be depressed at the hinge of the strap and lens (see picture), but I'm unsure what these are used for.  The instruction manual does not provide any guidance.  If it's used to detach the strap from the lens, it's not easy to do so (which I guess could be a good thing?)<br /><br />CAVEAT &amp; DISCLAIMER<br />-I received these swim goggles at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.  I am careful to write my review from the perspective as someone who purchased these at full price as I depend on other users' reviews to help make my purchasing decisions on Amazon.com.  That being said, I also typically only give 4* if I &quot;like&quot; the item; to give a product 5*, I must be amazed by the product.  These swim goggles are nice and what I expected them to be, and I'm sure most people will be happy with their purchase (as suggested by the 90% 5* reviews this product has received)<br />-I have only owned these swim goggles for a few days, so I cannot comment on the durability of these goggles.  Should this be an issue, I will update my review to reflect this.  It is nice the company does offer a 90-day guarantee, but I have not tested this policy (and hope I won't need to!)"
4.0,Love the fit and color- so flattering
4.0,Nice design but too small for a man
4.0,"Great fabrica, nice shirt, but a have to fix it because it runs little big for my taste"
4.0,"Went with a parka this year because puff coats make too much noise and I still get cold in them even living in CA. This is like wearing a duvet cover, which is probably overkill for what I need, but I love it! Well made, soft, doesnt poke me with feathers or shed fuzz all over the damn place. Feels way more expensive than it was.<br /><br />Waay too big. At least on me it is. I am 5'7&#34; 180lbs and I ordered an XL just in case. It fits me comfortably everywhere except the waist where I'm smaller, so it makes it look like I'm actually wearing a duvet insert, even with a bulky sweater on underneath. I was going to exchange it for a large, but I am broad shouldered with bigger arms and it fits me perfectly there, so I might just go and get it taken in a bit or have a drawstring installed. This coat definitely needs a drawstring! Shipping could be better as well. I ordered the day after christmas and it didnt get here until the 4th even after having it expidited.<br /><br />Otherwise, Its very nice and I highly recommend. I am debating getting the white one or the longer model as well and will try out a smaller size."
4.0,I like how comfortable the dress was. Be careful in purchasing your size. It is cut large. I would suggest to purchase a size smaller.
4.0,"The charm is very cute and the message is beautiful, I’ve ordered several other necklaces from Bryan Anthonys before and I was very surprised on how small the charm was (1/2 the size of a nickel).  It would good be a good necklace yo layer with others.  The most disappointing thing about it typically Brian Anthonys items are purchased as a gift for others and have come in a small white box with a lid that fits the card and necklace perfectly that all it needs is a ribbon and you’re good to go…this one came attached to the card in plastic sealed bag.  The item was not any cheaper than other items I have purchased from them but it looks like a cheaper and less personable gift without the box:..so now I’m needing to find a small box to put it in.  It’s those little details that everyone likes."
4.0,This product is made of wool and protects from cold weather and windy weather. It is a great wardrobe piece to wear with jeans and boots
4.0,Good fit and comfy .
4.0,Great fit. Washes well. Great quality!
4.0,Did not fit as I expected. Will have to see my wife in the outfit again tho to make a final decision. I might go a size smaller and a different colour.
4.0,I haven't worn it yet because i'm having it monogrammed with my business name however it looks nice out of the package.
4.0,"My son really enjoys this bike, however when it arrived the bike rim was bent. We were able to repair with no noticeable problems."
4.0,"I ordered the size that was recommended on the size charts or my measurements and the swimsuit was too big although it did look great on. Unfortunately after having to wait 2wks to get it, I shipped back and ordered a size smaller which is again on back order for another 2-3 weeks."
4.0,"Good quality, fit perfect and item arrived very faster. I love my dress"
4.0,Loved the dress! Looked amazing on and was pretty comfortable! The only thing was that it ran a little small and felt tight through the chest area. Otherwise super fancy dress for a great price!
4.0,"Seems like a good pair of shorts, if I had ordered the correct size. never wore them. Put them on but immediately took them off - too small. They have been returned. Will probably order a pair the correct size."
4.0,"Size and durability are great.  I don't like the drawstring system much, but maybe thats just me"
4.0,Looks great and it's very soft and comfy!  I bought it xxl to be able to wear it over other sweatshirts as a jacket and it works great - very true to size.
4.0,My wife loves her necklace. Great buy!!!
4.0,"It is a nice bonnet, but the ties aren't long enough.  Also, I didn't read the description close enough as I thought I was getting all three, but only got the pink bonnet."
4.0,"Like a tank top, but doesn't make me look like a fat version of kid rock"
4.0,This is a very cute and light shirt great for summer! The fabric is still thick enough that it’s not see through. Shipping was fast and easy. The detail of the floral sleeves is perfect sometimes the print advertised isn’t what you get but with this shirt it is exactly as advertised I ordered an xl and am a size 16 it’s a bit snug around the belly but I think that’s more of a personal problem!
4.0,"Cheap and flimsy, but will work for my husbands Halloween costume."
4.0,It's nice feels nice haven't tried in water yet
4.0,It is a nice mask just not happy with the thin elastic that goes around head feels like it is stretched out already
4.0,"Really cute.  If the dress is just the right length, the cat faces peek out from beneath.  They are a good substitute for black tights if you don't have any.  Thick and warm.  My daughter loves them."
4.0,Dress runs large returned for a better fitting option. Fabric was nice and thick.
4.0,Beautiful dress and the color is a touch brighter than the picture. I'm 5'5&#34; and the skirt just hits my knee. The only issue I have had with mine is the the lining in the neck line is waaayyyyy too big. It's almost saggy. Luckily the top fits me well so it's not noticeable to anyone else.
4.0,"Its a nice product, downside is everyday i have to adjust it 1 min."
4.0,"Far bigger than I anticipated.  I was able to fit two 19 inch laptops, my almost 20 inch footed ergonomic keyboard, a footpedal, 2 mice, 2 power cords, earbuds, my Kindle and its power cord, wifi pack and its power cord, plus notebooks, pens and a couple other last minute items and STILL had room left over.  Awesome bag."
4.0,the blue ones are defective.  How can I exchange them for another pair?
4.0,But tinker doesn't quite look exactly like tink But does look like a fairy still
4.0,"Very cute top but way shorter than it appears on the picture. Thin fabric which was nice to wear under a cardigan. Purchased a small, I am 5'6'' and 130lbs"
4.0,"I like it. It is short. But with dark tights or leggings should be fine. I'm 5'6&#34; 120band fit the small, but maybe medium would have been longer...overall very cute!"
4.0,"I bought size 16-18 and they fit very well. I'm 4 months pregnant and they come up all the way over my bump and were much cheaper than maternity swim suit bottoms and good quality.  I knocked off a star because the waist band tends to twist and fold over easily, which I just find annoying."
4.0,"Got this as a gift today, and the charger doesn't work. I got 2 extra batteries, so it is not the battery. After doing some searching, this is a common issue. Total crap! I guess this is what happens when buying Chinese junk! I wish that Amazon had an option to filter out Chinese products. Drone is still sweet though. I give the drone 4 stars because it is awesome and flies great. It loses a star because it doesn't have a lot of features, but is is a great drone regardless. Order an extra charger because the one that comes with it won't work."
4.0,These are very cute and sturdy but wasn’t expecting the green patina leaves because it’s not in the description or picture. Not that they’re an ugly color bc they’re not......It’s just disappointing when I don’t get exactly what I order. Nonetheless I will not send them back bc I will still use them for what I intended to use to them for.
4.0,"Nice fabric, fit is good. I have a small top and large bottom, lining is flowy like the top so there is no binding thru the waist and hips."
4.0,This pants are very smooth  and light fabric for a summer boat ride which I got them for . I’m surprise I am 5”3 and the length is perfect even with low wedge shoes. I would have gave it a 5 star but they are a little See thru I would purchase in other colors . I purchase a medium and they fit perfectly and I’m usually a large !!!
4.0,"I love the fit of this swimsuit!! But when I tried it on , my strap wasn't sewed!! For the money I absolutely love it!! I took needle and tread and sewed it best I could!!"
4.0,I love these! The only down side is if you use these on a labret the star and square shaped jems are pokey and after awhile irritate your skin.
4.0,i got the watch for my husband and its really nice and its suits him well Im glad that i brought the watch.
4.0,"I bought this purse to replace another purse. I was wanting a everyday purse. It had to have a shoulder strap, have enough pockets, and be made of a nice material. This purse covers all those requirements. I do wish I could put more stuff in it. The inside has two divided areas. I had to really organize my things, because it made the purse too bulky. It is hard to just reach in and grab things. Also, the outside pocket looks big in the picture, but it is small. I used to put makeup in the outside pocket. Now,it my lipstick and powder is all it can hold. Having said that, I liked the purse. It's very pretty. I just got it today, but I think I will get a lot of use out of it. The zipper and stitching are very secure. I recommend this to anyone."
4.0,"Great for keeping my hands warm and dry. The touch screen feature was not such a success. The material was too bulky to use with my phone with ease, so that aspect was a disappointment."
4.0,"Very nice, my brother really liked so I gave them to him but great buy for the price."
4.0,"I love my new dress! Based off the reviews I read I ordered an XL, I am a dress size 12.. The dress is a little long but wearing wedges will do the trick. The dress is colorful, comfy, and a great deal for the price.  I received many compliments throughout the day!  I plan to wash the dress on delicate and let it hang dry.."
4.0,"My daughter wanted this for her Halloween party and it was very cute on her.  I was not expecting much considering the price but it turned out to be better quality than I expected.  She can definitely use it again, which is rare for a Halloween costume."
4.0,Only 4 stars because the box came ripped.<br />Otherwise it's a great product but the battery won't last after the 15-20th charge
4.0,this was cute but it was just too big for me.
4.0,It was a gift. But it was so pretty.
4.0,The color is more of a rustic red. Darker than the picture
4.0,"Very beautiful, a bit small in bra area and had bought my regular size."
4.0,"I love the dress but I ordered a size large and it is still too short. I am 5'9&#34; and 120 pounds and it was almost like a longer shirt. I recommend buying a size or two larger than regular wear. The dress looks just like the picture though, super soft, and very flexible, I LOVE IT!"
4.0,Very CUTE dress.looks formal.looks just like the picture.arms fit exactly perfect. Material does have some stretch in which is good if your arms are large like mine. Will need to have an additional hole put in the belt if your waist is lg like mine or you can try to lost inches around mid section. Plan to wear this beauty at my daughters up coming wedding in August.
4.0,Yeah it’s a watch and it works but that watch is too damn small but since it’s 14$ you get what you paid for haha.<br />Still comes in handy at time so that’s a plus
4.0,"Aloha!<br /><br />This was a gift for a hawaii-loving twenty year old. She loves hibiscus flowers, and this shade of blue is her favorite color -- so this keychain was a no brainer. At such a great price, when I came across this, I couldn't say no.<br /><br />It's an adorable keychain, and is the absolute perfect size to hook on your keys. It's small and minimalistic, doesn't cause any bulk at all. It feels dense, high quality, and the graphic is sharp and crisp. She hooked it to her car keys and has been using it for about 5 months now.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this keychain does not hold up. She noted there are multiple scratches and chips just from the keys clanging into it (which is normal and shouldn't impact a keychain -- hence the words, ""key” and “chain""), and the paint/ faux leather on the loop completely degraded, so it's now just the exposed fabric underneath. When I saw it the other day, I was really disappointed.<br /><br />She still continues to use it, loves the design and coloring, gets compliments all the time, but it just isn’t holding up.<br /><br />PROS<br />- adorable<br />- lightweight<br />- successfully holds keys without fail 👍<br /><br />CONS<br />- not durable<br />- low quality<br />- doesn't smell like hibiscus.. or the ocean.. or Hawaii. Oooooo they should make a scratch and sniff one!<br /><br />For the price, I think I recommend it (it hurts saying that because I don't like buying junk, but it's just too cute). If you do buy this, know that this purchase isn't for an item that'll last for years to come if it'll be on your daily key set. This is a relatively cheap keychain that's not made for the long haul, so it may not be the best gift for someone, but there's no doubt it's adorable.<br /><br />If you like Hawaii, keychains, or compliments, then for sure get this. You won't regret it. If you value quality above all else, you're probably better off continuing your search.<br /><br />You're Welcome 🎶<br /><br />4 stars for giftability, cuteness, pretty colors. Docked a star because it’s not holding up with everyday use."
4.0,NICE ENOUGH TO WEAR OUT CASUALLY
4.0,"My kids wanted to dress up as PB Jelly and a baseball bat so they each wore an outfit and we brought along as baseball bat. super funny and everyone loved it! great thing about this costume is one size fits all and it just goes over whatever clothes you need to wear underneath. My son wears a men's medium and this fit him, my daughter wears a youth 10 and this fit her. My husband and i decided to go to a costume party and we used this PB and jelly costume as well. Threw it on over our clothes, he wears a 4x and i wear a 2x fit us both also. We WON THIRD PLACE in the contest! so it is well liked and a good idea to dress up as. four stars because i think the jelly could look a little better but overall everyone knew right away it was PB and Jelly. Just as pictures is how it looks in real life."
4.0,Cute warm hat that would’ve gotten 5 stars if it wasn’t such a tight fit. I ended up cutting the hidden elastic in the back to get a proper fit.
4.0,"Decent, but would have expected more for the price. The barbells are small, especially with the shield. I have very small nipples and they barely fit; if you have larger nipples I don't recommend. They are good for my skin that gets irritated easily, but I can already see the barbells tarnishing after two/three weeks of wear. I would say I'm satisfied, but not overjoyed."
4.0,fits great love look and feel
4.0,The fit was as described and the the material is good quality.
4.0,"A little larger than I expected for a &#34;medium&#34;, but good quality for the price.  I'll keep it!"
4.0,It's a fun product. I can't wait to have my nephew hold it in my wedding. The only thing is the glasses are meant for an adult while the case looks like its meant for a child.
4.0,"Nice pocket areas, bought as a Christmas gift."
4.0,"Quick shipping, fit as expected. Seems to be of very good quality, though the price is a bit high. Would recommend to others and buy again."
4.0,Purse is NOT Purple.  It's closer to red. It is a good deal for a cowhide organizer purse.  It's got enough room. It is a bit heavy but I'm keeping it as it is still pretty and roomy.
4.0,They have no heel or arch support but I love them at the pool.
4.0,Turned out much smaller than I'd expected though. But it's lovely. Delicate-looking. Sparkles.
4.0,"I ordered this dress over a year ago and LOVED it. I ordered my normal size and it was slightly too tight so I sent it back. This week, I was looking for a specific colored dress and kept coming back to this one. This time, I sized up, and it fits perfectly! Yay!"
4.0,"Very pretty bra. The only thing I don’t like about it is the fact that there isn’t an eye and hook closure. I have RA and putting on and taking off is tough on stiff and painful joints, however, that’s my only gripe.  I still like it a lot. It’s actually very comfortable to wear."
4.0,"I have arthritis mostly in my shoulders, so I can step into it. It is not tight at all."
4.0,"I love these! They are soft and comfy, fit is great. Im 5'5 and 140lbs and got the medium and it fits really well. The material seems very durable and well made. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because they are just a tad short on my legs and I'm not tall, so be aware if your taller these will be above your ankles. But not a huge deal to me, I love the fit"
4.0,Great little bag. Made well and holds all<br />my tech stuff and little extras.
4.0,Im a size 14/16 bought a 2x to be safe. It fits well because i like the extra room and falls close enough to the knee that i dont need shorts (5'8). I definitely could've went with the xl and been comfortable but the bigger size added to the length. Plus the material is of a soft tee which will probably shrink a little anyway. Bottom line im getting Atleast 2 more lol<br /><br />FOR REFERENCE THE XXL HAS A 16/18 SIZE TAG😊😊
4.0,Very nice but smaller than pictured. Super fast delivery.
4.0,"This nightshirt is indeed very comfortable. The longer tail helps keep the shirt from riding up and the material is soft and stretchy. I wish it buttoned up closer to the neck, but that’s just me. Overall it’s a fine sleep shirt."
4.0,"This is such a pretty romper! The material is lightweight and very comfortable. The length of it is just perfect, not too short and very flattering. I love the charcoal color. Pleasantly surprised at the quality! I am so happy with the fit and length, it would be great as a romper but also would work very well as a swimsuit coverup! I look forward to wearing this on our upcoming trip to Mexico! I was skeptical if this romper would be see through or too thin to wear as an outfit on its own. To my surprise it is lightweight but not see through at all. I love how the arms actually fit and don’t hang down like other rompers I have tried in the past."
4.0,"Like the purse, super cute!  Don't love the straps, they constantly fall down because of the weight of the chains.  Fits my carry piece well."
4.0,"I got so many compliments on this dress at my friends wedding. It’s beautiful, fits great. It’s incredibly long though! I had to take it to a seamstress. The sequins also have a mind of their own and fall off a lot but it’s stunning either way. I would get it again."
4.0,The metal cover that comes with the band could easily be scratched by banging against any surface it’s kind of pointless to be metal but so far it looks great on my wrist
4.0,Great Socks.  Delivered as expected.  Would definitely buy again.
4.0,"These were purchased for a Christmas present.  So since it is not Christmas yet, I do not know how the recipient will like them.  Sometime when things are purchased for gifts asked too soon to review."
4.0,"Runs small, usually a 26 in rag n bone, needed a 27.  color and fit is great. ankle length, higher rise, but not too high."
4.0,"Bought for a friend.  It's a bit smaller than I thought it would be.  It will fit, but not generously."
4.0,I got this dress by mistake. I had ordered a different one from the same seller. Still it's quite cute and my daughter loves it. It seems very comfortable.
4.0,I like the body jewelry it sometimes gets caught up on my shirt.
4.0,"Adult size, not kids. But it works."
4.0,The masks are very pretty and well made. I like the adjustable straps. They are slightly shorter in length but it still does the job.
4.0,Upon arrival the magnet attached to the base came off.  I bought gorilla glue and put it back on.  Other than that I think it's cute.
4.0,"I love these Forcool socks! I received a size small that fit me absolutely perfectly (I wear size 6.5 to 7 shoe). The sizing may be confusing, however.<br /><br />These are too warm to wear in the summer, but for spring, fall, winter hiking they will be perfect.<br /><br />Super soft and comfortable.<br /><br />They laundered well - in washer and dryer.<br /><br />These come to just under my calf, which works for the hiking boots or snow boots I wear. They fit snug enough to stay up but didn’t bother me (weren’t too tight on my leg).<br /><br />The colors are nice, as well—pretty little socks. They aren’t overly feminine, however, I don’t see these really as men’s socks, overall. However, why not?<br /><br />I’d order these again, if the price is reasonable—I can’t see a price right now to know price vs value to what you receive. I’d pay up to $15 for these.<br /><br />Really nice socks to hike in that will stay up without any slipping down and are soft and comfortable with slight padding."
4.0,"Very cute cardigan! Love the print and it's a good quality. Runs a little big, so I would recommend to size down 1 from your regular size."
4.0,"I'm only giving 4 stars due to the design.  The graphics are printed on the shirt and there was a part where the shirt folded so there's a small white rather blank space that's not printed.  Since this was purchased as a gift for my son, I'm not going to return it.  The graphics are nice & rich."
4.0,Great cubes but the smelled a bit funky after opening them.
4.0,Snap button is not long enough.
4.0,Gorgeous graduation gift for a friend. She was graduating high school and I wanted to get her something meaningful. It’s great piece and looks really nice. Great for any age!
4.0,Band is great but I received the wrong shade of brown. Worth it regardless.
4.0,they run just a little small but looks great on me
4.0,"These are very soft and warm, but -- I bought them two sizes larger than I wanted, because the description said to.  Big mistake.  I should have gone by the waist measurement, not the letter size.  My mistake, so I should probably give them 5 stars, but I can't wear them, so I'm not sure how they'd actually feel to walk around in, and how they'd last...<br />I'm going to have to give them away, so glad I got them around Christmas-time."
4.0,First package was lost in shipping and seller shipped another one. It is just as described. I like my t-shirts very loose so I could have added one more size but it fits comfortably. Just what I wanted!
4.0,"The watch is solid.  Nice heavy construction with nice brushing and great bezel action for the price.  The leather strap is ok, not great.  The buckle could be better.  Make sure you check the screws in the strap, mine were a little loose.  I tightened them with a little blue loctite to make sure they dont come out.  The automatic movement runs at -1/+1 a day which is great at this price point."
4.0,"Honestly, this is pretty expensive for what it is. As a gift for a true Elvis fan though, it may be worth it. My grandma has Alzheimer’s and dementia, but her love of Elvis will never be forgotten so this was perfect for her and was able to spark joy especially during her rough moments. Do not expect this to be a super durable, high quality bag. I’ve bought similar ones with Disney characters, etc. for gifts for about $3"
4.0,I ordered it a bit large but still fits great! its loose and comfy!
4.0,"Comfortable, light weight, not too tight in the elastic. Would have given 5 stars if one of then didn't have a whole in it. you don't expect a brand new pair to have a hole. But there were 12 socks in the package and 11 were perfect."
4.0,"Great looking shoes, they seem like they are well assembeled. Sizing is off I would have gone up another size as they are almost impossible to wear with socks and they will be out grown way too soon."
4.0,Exactly what the description said.Love it and I do feel protected from the evil eye people cast. Id give five stars but shipping took forever.
4.0,"I had a Lavishy wallet for years that I loved and just  replaced it with this new one one.  My old one had a strap across the top and the snap placed wisely on the outside.  With the new one the snap is on the inside of the wallet, so it won't actually snap shut and the placement of the snap means you can't use one of the cardholders (the snap is in the way).  It seems like a minor oversight in design that could easily be fixed.  Beautiful stitching and sweet designs!"
4.0,"I got these for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas.  They are very nicely made but quite large, especially for a 9 year old.  She'll grow into them!"
4.0,The fit is awsome.like the feel.
4.0,"One of the earrings does not close properly! That being said, I love the rainbow earring and they are very cute. I wear the rainbow earring alone bc the plain hoop does not snap closed."
4.0,Looking forward to wearing these during warm weather.
4.0,"Was satisfied, have had these for a year, and no tarnishing. And they are budget friendly  I recommend!"
4.0,"I'm wearing an XL and I find it snug. I prefer a looser fit, but I'll still wear this. The color is perfect - a peachy pink. The material is soft and the shirt is a good weight (not heavy, not flimsy). The font is easy to read and the beach is always calling!"
4.0,"Beautiful and well made, but too big.  I am 85 lbs, 5'1&#34; and this dress was too big (wide) and way too long.  The model must be like 5'10&#34; or something."
4.0,"I've purchased several of these tights in various colors.<br />I like the material for working out.<br />I'm 5'3"" 125. M is perfect."
4.0,"Really like these. Wish they were a lighter grey, and the 'cuffs' are a bit high as well. Doesn't stop me from wearing them though."
4.0,Cute accessories. Got this to wear to an 80's costume party.
4.0,I wanted some new Christmas earrings and these are perfect
4.0,Soft material but they are too tight for an adult. Too small. And the loops that go around the ears are too wide for comfort.
4.0,Nice<br />Strong
4.0,The color and material of this shirt is awesome. I ordered a large and it fit somewhat bigger then expected so I will order a medium next time but he loves it! The fish design is great!
4.0,It is very cute and somewhat silky
4.0,"Comfy, enough support for me, but I don't really like the toes and heels...the purple is a bit much.  I'd get another pair, though. They're cute."
4.0,"The fit is great, but the fabric is a bit thin, so I wear a camisole underneath. The drape of the cowl neck is pretty and lays nicely. I'd buy again."
4.0,The description is misleading. These are very pretty socks and very soft but they are not very warm. Good for southern winters (and summers) but will not be taking with me to Colorado or anywhere cold.
4.0,A good looking bracelet if you have a small wrist.
4.0,Beautiful watch for the price it’s hard to read time sometimes it’s the lighting is not good !
4.0,"Fit good, cute design. The fabric is thin though."
4.0,I love these colorful docks. So fun to wear. They are however less stretchy than a regular sock around the cuff. I have very small ankles but really have to pull to get them on. But I don't regret the purchase. Love wearing them.
4.0,"I love the way it looks, but Its a little more awkward than I thought to take on and off."
4.0,Shirt is nice.
4.0,"Using this as a gag prop for a video I was creating, it satisfied my requirements.  I've noticed negative reviews for things such as the ears not standing up, but I received mine in new condition.  It is soft to wear, not heavy and secures satisfactorily under the chin.  Not bad at all for the price."
4.0,"I sent this to my (not TECHNICALLY related, but closer than any that I share DNA with) aunt for Mother's Day. She was moved to tears when she received it. For the past 30(ish) years, she's been the mom of 2 sons. However, prior to her boys, she had 2 little girls-- lost (at ages 3 & 5) when a drunk driver ran a red light & hit the backseat of their car. This small token was my way of letting her know that EACH of her baby birds are remembered & that even though her girls aren't here, I've ALWAYS thought of her as a mother of FOUR..."
4.0,"These rings are surprisingly nice! They really do look just like sterling (in fact the moon & star ring actually has a sterling hallmark .925 on the inside). They have a nice weight and the pattern is as described. Only points off are because I'm not convinced it's actually an 8, it's smaller, and it doesn't come with gift boxes as stated."
4.0,"Didn't like the fabric and was a bit short to be worn as a dress, which was how I wished to wear it. Returned."
4.0,The pin is too small. where it is hard to fasten
4.0,"I really love this dress. It fits a little snug, but wasn't shock because I did check the size before. If you are a little big at the top please read the size chart, and my length is ok. Can't wait for summer, I am in the North East."
4.0,"granddaughter use for costume party, was great accessory,,,"
4.0,"I was not used to wearing compression socks. I guess they are supposed to feel snug. They fit just below the knee cap. I have long legs I'm about just under 5'9&quot;. 142-146 lbs. I wear 91/2-10 ladies shoe. I'm used to the tighter fit and love the comfort they give me now. I don't do a lot of standing because my ankles swell up at night. If I wear the nursemates My ankles aren't swelling anymore now. Usually if I am standing too long cooking or cleaning they are very swollen at night.  and I can really feel a difference in the pains in my legs. Especially if I'm doing a lot of standing in stores shopping or cooking. I am really noticing that after I remove the socks, the vein doesn't stick out and throb below my shin, as long as I'm wearing my nurse mates.  Now I can stand and watch my grandsons at their baseball games. I machine wash them but hang them to dry because I am afraid they will shrink. I am definitely going to be ordering more and  I love the colors!!"
4.0,"My granddaughter loves it!  She isn't a dancer, just wanted one"
4.0,Yes I like the bracelet very much
4.0,"I am in love with this necklace, it has the perfect colors for my wardrobe and lays at the right length as well. The price was great, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because 2 of the jems had already fallen off in the packaging when I opened it, but you get what you pay for and it was easily fixed."
4.0,"Encredibly soft, extremely tight in calves"
4.0,😊👌
4.0,CUTE BUT LOOKS A LITTLE CHEAP
4.0,Mangas muy largas pero hermosa
4.0,"This works great far better than expected, I wish it would be able to carry more cards. The extra length I feel is rather useless in terms of overall use."
4.0,Children really loved it!
4.0,Has neither light indicator nor battery within as the Samsung gear S original charger.
4.0,Product arrived on estimated date. Feels comfy enough. Hope the birthday boy likes it. :)
4.0,"These are not the highest quality (I would have given 3 stars), however the price is hard to beat (hence 4 stars)."
4.0,Liked the price for the medical grade. Didn't like how the waist is small and difficult to pull up. No elastic in the waist.
4.0,"It’s really cute! Fits my iPhone 12 Pro. But not too sure about the quality, hope it lasts!"
4.0,"The price was okay, but it broke after a short while. The material doesn't do well with regular exposure to water, so I need something different. Quality was good enough."
4.0,"The shirt is cute, but expect a long wait to get it even with amazon prime.  It fit's small so had to give it to my daughter but is still really cute. Material is that soft t shirt material. Order big!"
4.0,Bought to help stop over sleeping. It's has helped out so far. Been using it for about 2 weeks. The app you have to download to use the shock clock isn't the best but I would recommend it to anyone who needs help waking up.
4.0,Very small and very nice.. My dolphin-loving friend has worn them continuously since I bought them.
4.0,Clasp didn’t allow me to make them as tight as needed but they keep his hands warm!
4.0,I love it the only problem is that the top was to small I might have to go buy just a top next time all buy bigger the bottoms fit perfectly
4.0,The wig was just a bit small for my big adult sized head. It shed a bit too.<br />Otherwise I loved the colorful look of the costume itself as it did not look cheesy.
4.0,These bracelets are very nice. Both men n women liked them. Attractive in subtle way
4.0,"Bought it for a gift, he found the material thin, looking a bit cheap, thought u paid to much but I thought it was fine..."
4.0,"Color darker then in add, so I deducted one star. Other then that it's a very nice sweater."
4.0,"Top is a little &#34;narrow&#34;, meaning the breast cups are pretty close together - I'm a C cup so it was barely noticeable, but if you have a very large chest it might feel a bit... mashed haha. The suit is super cute and fits as expected! I love it!"
4.0,Bought for my wife to beat the coming summer heat.Fits good and looks better!
4.0,Have not used it yet but seems sturdy and is very cool.
4.0,These socks are a good buy. I never bought no show socks before but I thought these were fine.
4.0,Nice looking and not TOO large!
4.0,"These sunglasses are sharp!  The wrap-around aviator look is awesome.  Ray-Bans' polarizing lens can't touch Maui Jims, so I was already expecting an inferior lens.  These things are heavy, but I kind of like that.  They're great glasses, but I won't be wearing them for any sports activities-These are made for cat-calling. I might even become that guy who wears sunglasses inside."
4.0,I was afraid they were going to be to small because they looked it. They were so comfortable and I love the lace around the straps.
4.0,Really nice product. Great design. Would have like to have seen a bigger version for more cards to be held. Other than that would reorder another.
4.0,"One out of the three didn't have the drawstring in it, (black one). Other than that they are comfortable, soft and stylish. Just wish it wasn't always a crap shoot on getting what you ordered with a lot of these vendors. Quality control is super laxed with just about anything you buy these days."
4.0,"It looked as expected, very good value.  I was pleased.  Would prefer a fuller tutu but I was prepared for it not to be full.  Quality was good."
4.0,bought it for my daughter she loves it but says it runs a bit small
4.0,"looks good, should have ordered the next size smaller, that's the problem with ordering clothing on-line."
4.0,Nice appearance and appears sturdy but have not had it long enough to comment on durability
4.0,Very pretty dress but little too much cut in front
4.0,"This dress fits perfect. The quality is good; however, it's a lil sheer. I figure with proper under garments it will be fine. I can't wait to say I do in my dress."
4.0,"Fast delivery! however, The 36&#34; chain I got was put in a super small pocket and was all knotted together when I took it out, it took me a while to untangle it. The chain looks pretty , but is a litte thinner and the peace sign is smaller than I expected, I put a size 7 ring next to it in the picture so you can see how small the sign is, about 5mm, better to go with a dark color shirt when you wear the chain.  It will look good on a small frame, though. I will keep it anyway since I can wear it in a double stack look, which looks nicer for this chain. For this price, it is a good buy!"
4.0,Looks great feels great i just  played musical sizes till i found one that worked  it was a lil to big not much but i worked it  so  know your size and grab one and go swim
4.0,Fit nicely and was very comfy and warm for cold winter days
4.0,Shirt is pretty but it does not have a tag and the front and back both have a v neck cut so it’s hard to tell how to put it on...
4.0,"Appears to be well-made, like the tan leather color.  I hope the leather loosens a bit as I have difficulty removing credit cards from their slots."
4.0,"Small and it looks a little cheaper than I expected, but still nice enough to use"
4.0,"I honestly love it gonna be the exact same as the real thing but if you just want to take a little bit of photos and show it off just a bit you can really pull it off. To the seller who buys these and put them on Amazon I really need you to get the other one. Like the red one, the pink one. Because that’s K-pop idol name Lisa from blackpink. Wear one of these like one time. And a lot of people want to get this necklace because of Lisa. soo I know I’m just giving you some ideas 🥴"
4.0,"Return is complicated. I asked Amazon for a return label to do not pay the shipping due to I bought same dress in bigger size already, and after a month of communication with amazon I still did not get a simple label to return it.  The dress is GORGEOUS though!!!!!!!"
4.0,"I have been ogling this dress for a while, so when it went on Amazon Prime I had to buy it. I was so excited, I love the print and the concept of the garment. Unfortunately, it just did not look good on me. I have broad shoulders and violin hips, and this is just not a style that suits my particular body type. However, the dress appeared to fit as it was supposed to and seemed to be well-made. The pattern was beautiful - I really wish it had looked good on me."
4.0,"I was expecting a staple shaped septum retainer, but instead got a retainer with flared ends. It is 16g, so it does fit well, but wasn't the shape I thought it was going to be. It is short enough to be flipped up into the nose and is still pretty cute when it's flipped down. I do like it, but please beware you're not going to get a retainer that looks like what's being advertised. Also, it arrived before the estimated delivery date."
4.0,"they pitch a bit, and hard to keep on"
4.0,"Love the message! This is very cool I love it! The bracelet was pretty big so I adjusted it and cut off all the overhang with sharp scissors , a shame to have to cut extra ends but it looked funny just hanging. Thats the only thing I didn't like Is I wish it was easier to adjust."
4.0,These socks have a homemade type look that makes them appear cozy and festive for the holiday season.  They aren't quite as thick as they look like they would be and I haven't found them partiularly warmer than my other socks.  I do like the way these look and feel though.  I don't know how many people are okay with hand washing their socks but it's something to consider.  They look nice and have good variety in the colors.  It's a great pack and they won't be too thick to wear with your casual shoes.  I wear a 9.5 and they fit me and don't squeeze my big legs.
4.0,It was a lil smaller than I thought it would be. But other than that I like it
4.0,The opal point is a little crooked sitting in the black stud. Overall good quality.
4.0,The dress is good but size S is way too big.
4.0,"I typically wear an XL, but I bought in a XXL to be safe and that was the right move.  It is so cute.  Just be warned though, for some reason looking at the picture I thought the knees were like ripped, but it is actually two pieces - one above the knee and one below the knee- that are sown together on the sides. It was surprising but still cute."
4.0,Well priced.  Easy to read.  Reliable.
4.0,"It is authentic, it's Coach, I love the style, but when I read the purse was of &#34;mixed leather&#34; I just assumed it was two-toned. When it arrived in the mail, the mixed leather was actually a snake-skin which covers the middle zipper pocket and can be seen on both sides of the purse. I personally do not like anything with a snake skin look, it is not my style. I used for about a month to see if it'd grow on me, but it didn't. So I gave it to my friend and she loves it."
4.0,"Great shirt, but the white one is pretty see-through in the back. I don't like wearing undershirts, so I've been wearing it under cardigans and it's fine. The material is really soft and comfortable, and it fits really well! I'm bustier, so I was concerned about the top being too revealing, but it's really not. Good for work, everyday, or can even be dressed up. I'm usually a small or medium, and the medium fits great."
4.0,"Great buy, dont be in a rush for these, 2 months before i received pants, made to order"
4.0,"Shipping was excellent, color is lovely I normally wear size 8.5 in women’s but this 8.5 guess is too big"
4.0,Both my bf and I got one. It’s so warm to wear when skiing and outside I use it instead of a scarf. Easy to put on and stretches. It pilled after I washed it only once so it doesn’t look like it did when I first got it. As the little fleece balls are noticeable. But still warm and good for the money.
4.0,Makes a nice gift and works well on a purse. The leather tassel easily adorns your bag. You may want a caribiner to attach it to your bag. The tassels work well on a brown bag and will also work well on a backpack. I like the little pompom. This is a nice gift and comes in a drawstring bag.
4.0,"Used all day at work. Wish that back material wrapped further around towards face to protect sides of face. Need metal slide to hold neck tie instead of flimsy plastic, but love hat otherwise."
4.0,Esta bonita pero quedo pequeña
4.0,Does what it job not as fancy as other ones but gets job done
4.0,"Round, yes. Metal tipped, yes. Waxed, no.<br /><br />I guess the silver gold selection is nice to match other metal trim (buckles, clips, watches, etc.) but I prefer silver.<br /><br />Very classy."
4.0,Loved it. Very comfortable and had no issues wearing the dress.
4.0,My wife likes the wristlet. Nice size but the handle broke a couple months in. Would not purchase it again.
4.0,Cute dress and good material for the price
4.0,Hood is amazing the waist is tight.
4.0,I measured and read the reviews and yet still needed uo sending it back and reordering. And the replacement prices went amazing n
4.0,"So cute. Double sides. Mine came with a little tiny mark on one side. But still worth it, especially for the price."
4.0,"Unfortunately, they were too small to try on so I returned them."
4.0,"This is more fitted in the bodice than I expected. There is a bit of crooked elastic in the waist line. But it's the perfect maxi length for my kiddie, and I will probably buy the other colors in this dress."
4.0,Great for sporting activities.  Polarized lenses are great for fishing<br /><br />and they won't fall off your head into the water...
4.0,Para k Crees ústed!!!
4.0,"The Bible cover is very well organized and protects my new Bible very well.  I couldn't believe it was offered for such a low price.  I wasn't expecting it to be as good quality as it is.  It is pieces of leather stitched together, but this is not obvious without a very close look.  I had it some time before I noticed it.  I love the storage of the pocket and compartment for a notepad and pen or whatever you need to carry with you.  Pleased with my purchase.  Barb H."
4.0,Comfortable (especially no seam toes); easy to get on; nice material but a little thick for the summer. Just the right amount of compression for circulation and diabetes.
4.0,The robe is soft and absorbent without being heavy like terrycloth.
4.0,Nice Cheap Shirt.
4.0,The dress fit good but the fabric wrinkles easily.
4.0,This has been a great cross body purse for me. Love the size and the color. The only problem is the outer snap does not stay snapped. It’s the section where I put my phone. Other than that I really like the purse.
4.0,"nice and cool, good material."
4.0,"Purchased a size medium for my Mom who wears size 10 and it was too tight.  Returned dress and re-ordered a large and it was too large and I returned it also.  She loved the dress, but the fit was not for her."
4.0,"The product fits well. I thought the top would have more coverage, but it is very comfortable.  I am between a small and a medium for most clothes. Pants fit great.<br />Washes well. I like e dry the outfit"
4.0,"Igual a la foto , pero corre un poco pequeño para mi. dice de 6-7 años , yo diria de 5-6 años.<br />a mi nena le quedo exacto. espero le dure bastante."
4.0,"Wish I looked like the model, but the suit still manages to be flattering"
4.0,I bought the &#34;red&#34; top. Its really cute BUT its more of a pink color. Material feels great but I'm not sure how the stings will hold up after washing. Product arrived in time. Also if you'd like a looser fitting I suggest ordering a size up.
4.0,"Pretty much what I expected, nice looking cap. I'm not sure it is worth $18 but its what I wanted."
4.0,"I would have given five stars but it's hard to get a clean cut if you need to trim them to fit, which I do. Other than that they do the job and hold their shape well."
4.0,Nice bracelet and it looks great on ! Would buy again ! And the girls love it !
4.0,"The color is a bit lighter than advertised, I still like them."
4.0,"Large size was impossible to pull up over calf. Compression sleeve is heavy duty weave, almost no give. Would be great if you just order a size up than you think you really need. Measurements don’t add up to actual fit. I have to return them unfortunately."
4.0,"I'm very pleased with my shirt, got here on time and fits just how I imagined. I wear an Xl but shopping online I normal order an xxl so not too tight, but I'm sure glad I went with my usual size. I would order again."
4.0,My mom really like this.
4.0,This medieval dress was for my daughters high school choir concert. It was beautiful and she looked beautiful in the dress. It wasn’t cheaply made. The only issue was putting strings through the corset it was difficult
4.0,"One pair arrived broken!  However, the overall set is very cute and lightweight.  Some earrings are a little awkward to wear because of the shape"
4.0,Really cute and good quality but it's more small than I expected.
4.0,"Perfect fit and look good and the carry bag is very nice as well!!!  I took a star away because, from how they the lenses are discribed, they should repel dust and dirt but I find that it's the opposite."
4.0,Item shipped fast. They do run a little large around the waist.
4.0,Great socks nice quality fits a little snug so keep that job mind.
4.0,I washed it to see how it would fit. It actually fits much better out of the dryer than first purchased.
4.0,Be sure to wash alone - color bleeds in the wash machine and discolors other items - even if they were like color.
4.0,"Doesn't feel right, but wearable.I might pass this on to someone that it can fit."
4.0,"Product is as described. Hard shell steel toe! Light weight and breathable! Incredibly slip resistant. I am a Chef and work in a HOT kitchen. I was looking for a tough, durable, sturdy breathable shoe. I found it! This shoe is not water proof or water resistant, which I knew, so any spills will seep through but I'll take that risk because they are breathable! I'm on my feet and in these shoes for 10-12 hours.<br /><br />The shoes do need to be broken in and I wish they had a ""wide"" size but so far so good. i haven't had the opportunity to test our the Kevlar inserts yet (which is great) but the soles do keep my feet at least 1"" to 1.5"" off the ground so my feet stay dry when mopping or dealing with liquid on the floor."
4.0,"these are super cute, a little cheap, a little seethrough but cute nonetheless"
4.0,"Smaller then I imagined it would be,  but that makes it dainty. I love it."
4.0,It is going with me
4.0,"Initially, I had thought to return this, as there's no shape whatsoever to the tank top. However, I am keeping it as it looks great with a skirt tucked in or dress pants tucked in. Maybe I could pair it up with a belt, but definitely a NO by itself."
4.0,They're really cute and not overbearing.
4.0,"I am very happy with this product and the fit is just right for me ,<br />I’m not sure about the material though,it easily picks"
4.0,"I love the swimsuit, but the padding that came in it was bad."
4.0,"Too big for my 8 year olds face. I will add nose strips to the top to help contour to his face, and sew the bottoms to help seal the gaps."
4.0,"The support and springiness in these socks is as advertised. They are, after all, from the ACE bandage and brace people. Compared to basic socks, they can make running or brisk walking more fun for longer. So chalk up a win on the main purpose. They are useful for any activity, not just running.<br /><br />You do need to know that the sizing is peculiar, with a break at shoe size 10 between the S/M and L/XL socks (i.e., choose big socks or little socks). Since these are tight-feeling support socks, you won't be able to wear the ones that are too small, and I imagine that any looseness in the foot is going to be massively annoying.<br /><br />You might also want to consider whether you want an over-the-calf sock in warmer weather; if you want a similar sock in a shorter length, you'll have to look for another brand.<br /><br />Still, there are a lot of reasons (shin splints!) that athletes and others might want the comfort and support of the compression socks.<br /><br />The price is on the high side, but considering that these socks feel like they'll last forever, I would grin and bear that."
4.0,"vendors don't seem to make them as functional as before.  i had a buxton's key wallet years ago that had a front insert for an id, credit or security card.  it was easy to take out of the pocket to flash or scan it.  i've looked all over and could not find a similar one.  the fossil one is okay and am satisfied with it but i would have preferred the old buxton model with the front id insert."
4.0,"I am so tired of every company thinking that plus size woman with underwear over their stomach! Just because we are bigger doesn't mean we don't want bikini underwear or hipsters. Most heavier woman like their hips covered and not their stomach. These fit great! very comfortable! I'm 289lbs 56 inch hips and the 14 in the hipsters fit perfectly. Absolutely love the fact that they are COTTON! Don't mind paying a little more for cotton. Edges could use to be a stitched a little tighter and would like it if the trim around was slightly wider so they last a little better in the wash. Overall very happy with this purchase, I will definitely order again!"
4.0,"For the price point, these are great. I bought them to use as maternity scrubs. The stretchy side panel works great. The pants have a tighter waistband than I would like, but they work for now. The material lends itself to lots of static cling, might be able to be fixed with fabric softener/dryer sheets, I don't use them. They are a little scratchy but far better than other sets in this price range. I am undecided if I will purchase more sets."
4.0,Los dedos no tienen un buen acabado y no son para temperatura de -30f
4.0,Handy medical info and a small gear clip in one
4.0,Material is thinner than expected but still nice.
4.0,Great tank. Runs a bit big so I recommend sizing down.
4.0,These are really medicated! They are great for if you need an emergency pair!
4.0,Just like heels you gotta break them in. The photo they give is justified. I was dying wearing it to look cute just breaking them in took a while. The pointy toe took me down a star because i don't like looking like i have elf feet. The tip is very flat i ordered a 10 and it still felt like i could not fit it. Its a great boot you just have to be used to wearing this type and break them in to your foot and its shape.
4.0,"Good elastic and works well with a helmet. One thing I found annoying was its tendency to curl up slightly while wearing. Overall, I'd buy this product again"
4.0,"I enjoy this product. It uses good quality leather and it looks really nice. My only negative comment is that when I attach the strap, the leather attached to the hooks is not stable enough. That is to say that it causes the rest of the leather lining to move upwards, changing the shape of the bag to an extent. It's not a great issue for me since I usually hold it, but I worry if it might affect it in the long-term."
4.0,"The belt seems sturdy but the buckle I'm not so sure about.  The buckle works well but time will tell if it holds up.  Also, there is very little stretch in the belt.  I guess I was expecting a little more stretch.  However, for the money, this is a good deal."
4.0,It was a comfy shirt
4.0,"The fabric is a little bit too slippery to stick in place very well, but it does still work. I just have to pull it back up more frequently than I'd like. It's pretty tight on my head, too, but that may not be the same experience for others. It's not suffocating or overly tight, just slightly more snug than I'd like. It's overall a well-constructed, with great seams at either end and good stitching, so I'm confident in its longevity. It feels like it'll be pretty durable when it rubs or bumps things, like I don't need to worry about it tearing easily. It ends up making a much better do-rag than face cover, but it still functions as either fairly well. I don't think I'd buy it again, but it works as a backup for me."
4.0,Very cute. :) I wore it for my Valentine's date with my wonderful boyfriend! He loved it on me.&#60;3
4.0,"This smells so good! I put it on my hands at night and my hands smell great next to my face as I'm falling asleep. It is thick but absorbs right away and isn't greasy at all.  Both smell the same, which sort of surprised me since one is white and one is purple, so I thought one would be coconut and one would be lavender, but they're both coconut and lavender. But I love using these and they make my hands and feet soft. I think it's a little bit pricey though, so that's the reason for the four stars."
4.0,I like them but I though they were bigger.
4.0,The hard cardboard that's it's made of makes it kinda bend
4.0,"Really nice purse, although I received one that had a nice shape and 2 more that had odd shapes"
4.0,"Even though this watch is unisex, this is a bit big for women. However, the style is really good and it matches to almost every clothings becuase it's multicolor. Love it."
4.0,I wear one color a lot and it tends to get stretched out now but I could mess with it other than that you could a lot for a little with great quality I wouldn't say these would break even if they get caught
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:32925783fb64014687e8d260fb72a756]] I really like squishies for stress relief and this one was a little stiff on the yellow part. Compared to another one I got on Amazon, it’s nice. Just give it a bit of time out of the package, it may be a little deflated, but no worry! Good product"
4.0,"I wanted to add a vintage field watch of that type for a wile. It's a bit thick bit it is comfortable on wrist and ""Indigo "". The watch looks great and the strap is thin bit soft and comfy. Over all I am supper happy with this watch."
4.0,"This dress is cute, but I feel the waist should be lowered."
4.0,"Fits as expected, super cute and pockets! Material is decent, but good value for the price"
4.0,"Because several reviews said it ran small I ordered one size up and it fit great.  It's pretty comfortable, however the clasps on the back are a bit frustrating because they can come undone if they're not in exact.  The trouble is they are hard to get in exact without someone else helping.  But if you have a spouse or friend willing to help you, it's just fine."
4.0,"I love this dress. It is a little tight for someone like me who is a little bit bigger in the bust, but still fit good."
4.0,I liked how it fit and the look
4.0,So cute! We received a lot of compliments but it was too small for my 3 year old.  The sleeves were up her arms.
4.0,"JUst not good on me, too bad it was pretty"
4.0,"I absolutely love this coat.  It fits perfect and keeps me warm.  Its lightweight and warm not bulky like most down coats.  Order 1 size up,  the coat fits your curves and is kind of sexy for a winter coat.  I received several compliments thus far."
4.0,I love it. It is very cute. I give it a four star rating because it only fits square style keys. It was impossible to fit a more rectangular key.
4.0,"I have to were glasses with my face mask and with this covid thing going on, my glasses fog up bad. So I started reading reviews. I thought I would try this stuff out. And to my surprise it worked very well . It actually work better than I thought it would. You need apply it just like it says. You will get the best results after you apply it and do not clean it again, because it will remove it form your glasses. If you do this, I have found that it will last for 3 to 4 days. It does keep your glasses for fogging up but does not keep moisture off your glasses. There is a difference. You can't see through the fog but you can see through the moisture. I have noticed that the all around clarity on my lenses is must better. I did not expect that at all. That was a bonus. Oh yea, My wife and I have been using it for about 2 weeks. I am going to have to get her, her very own  bottle."
4.0,Wish they ran a little bigger.
4.0,"Nice item, haven’t worn yet."
4.0,I love the quality of it! Thought it’s too small for me so I would order a size of of your original size.
4.0,It not what I expected but it will work well with my white wool coat.  Looks furry in the picture but it more of a cloth material
4.0,The fleece was soft and warm. Its also good quality and thick enough to wear in cooler weather. I bought a large because I like it roomy and layer up for cold weather. I'm 5'3&#34; and I usually wear a medium. I would buy it again another color just for variety.
4.0,"Great shoes, used by my 6-year old at summer camp and went through lots of water play,"
4.0,"Super cute ring.  Very dainty.  Bends and moves VERY easily - I'm worried it's going to wear out (from moving too much by getting caught on things).  In the mean time, I like it!"
4.0,Nice belt for the price. If you have a larger waistline it will not lay correctly.
4.0,"These are a Great Find! Ive ordered a couple of these and they are consistantly light weight, comfy, and a soild value for the money. Its rare to find a solid -6.00 in this quality online without a prescription. A great backup plan till you can get your eyes checked."
4.0,"Good fit, good quality and feels like it will last. Adidas quality"
4.0,"This item came very fast, I loved that it had a zipper in the back. Only problem I had with it was I ordered a size too big... I'm normally a size M ( 5'4, 150 lbs) but ordered a size L because I wasnt sure they were true to size... size L ended up being way too big and I returned it. Too bad they didnt have an option to just send me a medium and I send back the large. Ended up buying from another company."
4.0,"This shoe is very comfortable. I would have given it 5 stars if it did not run small. I had to order another, one size up. I'm an 8 1/2 and had to get an extra large. That fits just right."
4.0,"The jacket fits nice and I like the color, however the scarf was not included. I messaged the seller, hopefully they can send it."
4.0,"I ordered this in a small and I would say that this was true to size, but size up one if you want to be safe. The shorts are comfortable to wear and the waistband hugs the waistline that adds to the nice fit of the shorts. They are very short, so they will be used more for loungewear rather than exercise. The pockets were a bit awkward because they are not very attached to the shorts, so they have the possibility of falling down and peeking out from under the shorts."
4.0,"I love these glasses, but they are smaller than expected. I love they way they turn everything a light pink."
4.0,Seemed to run big. But on a positive note it didnt shrink much in the wash! Comfy and soft material too.
4.0,"I had this top saved in my shopping cart for the longest, I absolutely love the style but was skeptical after reading other reviews about the fit. I haven’t purchased a patty top yet that I haven’t loved so I went ahead and got this one. It’s not as form fitting as most styles and like another said can’t be worn with most regular bras, which is something I’m uncomfortable without. So when it came in I paired it with a lattice front undershirt and that solved the problem without it looking silly. Glad I made the purchase!"
4.0,"Glasses are fine, slim and fit well. Sometimes it is difficult to slide back into the case, but a worthwhile purchase."
4.0,"I like the shorts overall, ordered a 2xl and just a bit too small for my thighs. I’m 6’6 280."
4.0,"Nice looking watch, very stylish on my hand. Band is a little bit broader than a regular watch band, but this is a great design since it matches the<br />the face and size of the watch. Overall a very eye catching time piece which fits nicely into my collection.<br />Andy-Trinidad W.I."
4.0,Its a little tight in the arms and the Sherpa is not quite as soft as I had expected.
4.0,How do I return product?  Not a true clear!<br /><br />Diane Newton
4.0,"I love the color of the stones (rasberry wine) and that the bracelet nests wonderfully with my similar style bracelets. I have other items by Carolyn in this stone and they look great together.  Every time I saw this listed at Carolyn's web site it was out of stock. Carolyn's Customer Service suggested that I look on Amazon. (Thanks Liz!)The only down side is it's a tad small, but looks great."
4.0,"I had been working from home, but went back into an office setting about 6 months ago.  Unfortunately, when I made the home to office transition I noticed my wardrobe really needed to be updated.<br /><br />When I saw this dress I fell in love with the design.  It is so unique.  Something you don’t find in most stores.<br /><br />I tried it on right away and was so happy!  I never know how something I order will fit, but this one put all my doubts to rest.  It is made of polyester and spandex and had a nice stretch to it.  The colors are absolutely brilliant.  The design is just how it appears in the pictures provided.  The dress is well made and all of the stitching is even.<br /><br />I usually wear a 10 and got an XL because I don’t like things to fit really snug.  This fits great for me.  I am very happy with it.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,More Peach colored than blush pink
4.0,"Honestly, it's much bigger than expected. Otherwise, it works really well.  I haven't had any complaints or challenges with it, and I travel quite often.  It's held up well, although there has been slight fraying on the seams.  Overall, good wallet just a bit bigger than I had hoped for."
4.0,this is perfect for any hat collector. One note I don't know if it was just my package but when I opened it up it smelled like smoke .
4.0,"This is a really cute, lightweight sweatshirt.  I love the colors and makes it much more feminine and adorable.  Definitely size up, especially for curvy women.  I usually wear between a size M and L, but ordered the XL based on reviews, and it fit perfect.  The bottom band is tighter, as it hits at the low hip on me, so a M or L would not have fit well."
4.0,"These are super comfortable and fit me lengthwise perfectly.  Getting the top tied and waist folded and staying has been a challenge (it slips and falls).  Color will definitely fade over time, first wash got lots of other clothes stained (temporarily hopefully)."
4.0,Skirt is pretty. A bit heavy but I kept it because it is pretty and will be great in the winter
4.0,"Its a great looking dress, the material isn't  too thin and at 5'5 it falls right on my knee, the only thing for me is that the dress could have a bit more stretch/spandex since you have to put it on over your head but other than that it looks great and can be accessorized"
4.0,bought this for my brother..he loved it but i had to make some alterations to it. like the hands were too big and long so i had to make them shorter and smaller...apart from that it is beautiful and it pops and it is beautiful again lol
4.0,Some balls were too small and some threads were stripped allready
4.0,These are a perfect gift idea for a new mom. This will be very helpful when you're on the go and have a wet diaper or messy items. This will keep the diaper bag very organized and easy to find what you need. Great quality too.
4.0,"my daughter loves everything individual, she was disappointed when the first one broke (the tail is a little flimsy) but it was replaced quickly and there have been no problems since. the seller was amazing"
4.0,OK - I have a thing for red handbags.  I just do.  This is a great bag - roomy and holds all of my stuff well without too much exploration of the Black Hole that comes with most larger handbags.  The only thing that keeps this from being a four-star review?  It has a weird smell that I'm hoping will dissipate in time.  I would like to buy a black and navy bag - does anyone know if the navy is a true navy?
4.0,"These pants are interesting. The fabric is a very tight weave with no stretch, like dress pants. Since there isn't any stretch, there's no give as far as sizing. I think the overall style, though, is rather casual. The quality is perfectly good. Probably similar to something you'd pay $15 for at Wal-Mart."
4.0,It wasn't the correct band for my tracker so I had to return it. But it is beautiful!
4.0,I love this dress! The only reason I didn’t give it 5 star ⭐️ was because I wear a 2x and ordered a 5x and it fits perfectly. So because it is not true to size I cannot in good conscience say that it was 5 stars. But pretty dress.
4.0,I really have no idea how this works because I've never used it. I just wanted something cute to put in the glass part of my bathroom cabinet. The container is plastic but it is cute.
4.0,"It is a nice chain and very inexpensive,  My granddaughters keep breaking my necklaces so I got this so it wont matter if they break it.  It is not as shiny as I was expecting but it is nice for the price."
4.0,"This is the 2nd time purchased, 1st purchase, the I watch clip, broke after 2-3 months"
4.0,"Cute, and it really does charge your phone!"
4.0,"Love the look, the sleeves are a bit larger than expected especially at the wrist. There is some elastic but still much too loose. I had the wrist altered (tighten) and am now delighted."
4.0,"Runs fairly true to size if not a little large. The text printed on it does look more ‘screen print’ than the picture makes it appear and a different kind of camo, but definitely better in appearance than some shirts I’ve purchased online. The heart accent on the sleeve is my favorite part!! I feel it is more sweatshirt material than some of the other reviews made me think it would be."
4.0,The fabric is very soft and comfortable.  The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that the grey pants and trim color is kind of dull grey.  I may order another pair in a different color they are so comfortable.
4.0,"The sleeves are cute. The material is okay, not uncomfortable, but not super soft. It’s not clingy on me wish it was a tiny bit longer I feel like I’m always pulling it down."
4.0,somewhat stylish...need this color for my dark navy blue suit....gets the job done
4.0,"I cannot button the coat, but is super cute."
4.0,"The outfit was very soft and thick material. Mine was a little bigger than expected, but I’m going to try to wash and dry it a little. It says they’re lounge pants/pajamas, but it’s rather thick. Also, I wanted to wear this as an jumper for every day wear, but I’m going to save it for the fall. Mine"
4.0,Debating on getting the real one and this is a great substitute! It does hurt after wearing it a lon of period of time but it did what it was supposed to do!
4.0,Super cute! Obviously a little cheap but it is cute for minimal use
4.0,Looking for boots to go with winter new born fit a size 3 infant.  Not looking for arch support (non walking) with socks and shoes feet do tend to sweat.  I loved the look and the fit was great
4.0,My daughter absolutely adores this nightgown. Her only complaint is it’s a little itchy by her armpit. It doesn’t stop her from wearing it (which she has been known to do) though.
4.0,PROS<br />looks great and feels great<br />CONS<br />battery stopped after 3 months
4.0,Much better quality than anything I can find for women's athletic socks in a department store
4.0,Arrived looking nice in overly expensive packaging (tin box).  Higher quality than others I have ordered that came with splotches.
4.0,These  were cute buy rip easily
4.0,Love It! A lot of space for cards
4.0,Recommend buying 1 size up since it did shrink in the wash.  It's a cute top.
4.0,GIft
4.0,I have a Luau housewarming party to attend and all guest are asked to wear Hawaiian themed outfits and I got these lays because they are unique in color and not the typical rainbow colored ones in every store that every person will be wearing.
4.0,They are thinner than I anticipated- not meant to be an individual insert but a doubler. They are a quilted cotton and very soft though.
4.0,The look and price.  I have a small face and these aren't so overpowering as some sunglass models.<br /><br />But unfortunately they are no longer available and the company could not say when or if they would get more in.
4.0,"Had one of these for a couple of years. Wore it every weekend for 4-10 hours. Blocks the sun, so don't need sunblock. Traveled with it. Set heavy luggage on it. Always kept it's shape. Even though white, never got dirty. Good look.<br /><br />Lost it.<br /><br />Ordered another, but too large. Knocking off a star because customer needs to pay for shipping, which is not cheap because it is quite a large box."
4.0,"nice watch band, fit perfect on watch. no complaints at all"
4.0,"I wear it on a leather cord as a pendant. I get lots of compliments!<br />I took off 1 star because the latch doesn’t work great, it gets stuck in the open position and must be manually maneuvered closed."
4.0,I sized up and it still barely fits. Cute..thin my decent material. Great for the price
4.0,"This necklace is a terrific piece that can be worn with casual clothes or a nice dress for a night on the town. The chain is thinner than I expected, but it only adds to a delicate, feminine look. My only complaint is that my hair has gotten snagged several times on this particular chain. I don't want to have to always wear my hair in a ponytail in order to wear this necklace, so oh well! Losing some hair is worth this pretty necklace, I guess! :)"
4.0,My niece seemed to like this. Material is what you should expect from SHEIN. Meh.
4.0,This is a very pretty shirt. I was surprised by the heft of the material-very nice quality. However-it is vey snug. I wear an large and orders the XL-which fit me like a medium in the breast and stomach area. That cost the shirt 1 star out of what could have been a 5 star rating.
4.0,"This is a really beautiful dress, soft material, fit exactly like I knew it would after taking my measurements. It was wonderful the one time I got to wear it. When I was doing my laundry I missed pulling it out before I put the clothes in the dryer and it looks like I won't ever be wearing this dress again, it shrunk immensely. I love the dress, I will be ordering another one. but I just wanted to put this warning out there, don't ever put this dress in the dryer 😄"
4.0,It’s a beautiful top but thought it was going to be a thicker material.
4.0,"In many ways this is arguably the future of custom fits. It’s convenient, simple and fun to experiment with. I would love to see more customization options - such as an oval shaped collar, rolled and stitched cuffs, maybe more color options. Will definitely buy again."
4.0,"This bonnet is really cute and well made, but it’s a little too big for my daughters head. Granted she is only four months old, and she’ll grow into it. Would recommend for any mom wanting to protect your little ones hair!"
4.0,Nice dress but to small and short for my all legs daughter
4.0,They were super cute for my outfit and they fit pretty good!
4.0,good mask.
4.0,Very pretty but it's alot smaller than I expected and I don't like the black cord that it comes with so I'm getting a chain to put the black heart on
4.0,"These were a little longer than I wanted, but were easy to trim down and make smaller. Colors are beautiful."
4.0,I think the fit is fine. I only wish the material was better. It doesn’t seem like it will air out well on a very hot day. Other wise I like it for the price.
4.0,Order a size up to fit more comfortable
4.0,This was the second purchase from the Allegra K line. The material the shirt is made of was very soft and the fit was exact. The only problem I had with it was it had one sleeve that was too big. It was if a large sleeve was sewn onto the shirt. I did contact Amazon customer service and will be sending the shirt back. I will try try ordering it again. Hopefully quality control is better this time.
4.0,It’s a very nice case but I (mistakenly) expected it to have a shiny (glossy?) surface - which I would have preferred.
4.0,"Can't beat these for the price. They're roomy and ideal for weekend trips or week long trips if you can travel light. I am a little concerned that the zippers may not be super strong, I'd avoid over-stuffing."
4.0,"I was impressed like me any said the pins holding the bad together are difficult to remove to resize the band. However, they were no more difficult than other watches I've had. The watch actually has 3 watches in it the analog hands and main digital face as well as another digital watch accessible by pushed by the start button. The back light only stays on for a second or two but if u push it a few times then hold it the back light will stay on. It fairly heavy and seams to be well built. The instructions kinda suck but it's night hard yo figure out"
4.0,"I love this item, but it was just a bit tight for my anatomy (not the bar itself, but the cross pressed into the top of my ear a bit) other than that, its perfect!"
4.0,"Good wrestling/MMA/karate socks for training on less than desirable surfaces.  If you have to train on substandard surfaces like carpet, linoleum, woven indoor/outdoor AstroTurf type carpets, weight room pad tiles, etc.  These will protect your feet, but not grip excessively .  Easy to clean by hand/mesh laundry bag.  Breath and fit well, as are mostly lycra/nylon cloth with the minimum amount of neoprene .  Other brands are all neoprene and would be too hot, plus not fit as snug. Since they have begun to stretch slightly, I'm going to buy another pair one size smaller. Been using them 2 days = hours/week for almost 12 months in a karate class held on very rough synthetic mesh outdoor carpet. The least amount of neoprene of all brands, so they breath better. Size M fit a US Size 9.5 foot, but after 2+ months of wear loosened up a bit so the sole slides/rotates around the foot by ~10%. Smaller size might be too narrow in the top/neck of the sock to get over the ankle/heel, though.  I can't find a better alternatives other than going to a full martial arts shoe."
4.0,"This is somewhat comfortable to wear but after a few weeks of use, the plantar fasciitis is as awful as ever"
4.0,The shirt was a little to short put love the outfit . Run true to size I'm a sure large and order a large ...
4.0,When we recieved the item it was soaking wet inside the plastic wrap and the box was dry. Washed it and everything was fine.
4.0,"It's rugged, protects my stuff and is just the right size. It's great for going from laptop bag to tiny dress purse. It's easy to throw in a pocket, bike carrier or diaper bag. I especially like the outer band so I can slip a few bills in. I slip my hand through it and carry it when I'm doing a lot of walking and don't want to carry a bunch of stuff. I'd give it 5 stars if the darn clasp didn't break. It did last a year, so that's better than the previous design with the clasp inside. I'm buying another one. Haven't found anything I like better."
4.0,"These are a great pair of pants. You can't beat the price. I would pay 2-3x as much at a brick and mortar retailer. The material and stitching is as high-quality as similar pants at Nordstrom. I can see wearing these for Casual Friday and easily transitioning to Happy Hour after work. With all of that being said, I am 5’9” and 125lbs and these pants ride up uncomfortably. Regretfully, I am going to return these because the discomfort. I would recommend these for anyone well below a 32” inseam."
4.0,Beautiful outfit but the skirt is too large. My daughter wears the shirts all the time. Its very well made and holds up to several washes a week. I would still recommend this outfit.  Definitely worth the money and I know we will get good use out of the skirt later.
4.0,Wallet came promptly and is the same color as the picture.  I like the individual sleeves for the cards and the other compartment holds money well.  It is a little smaller than I need but I'm making it work.  I have too many cards in it (over 20) so I sometimes have difficulty zipping it.  I also think that over time the zippers will fail -- they are getting caught alot.  It is great having the RFID protection and I love the color and convience of the wallet.
4.0,"Very pleasantly surprised by the quality of these sunglasses. Clarity is fantastic and the flex at the temple makes for a comfortable fit.  The caring case, microfiber case and cleaning cloth included were a nice touch as well.  Definitely satisfied with my purchase a especially considering the low price."
4.0,"The order of the tights came with two pairs. The material is thick, very soft and flexible. The size runs small but it fits well to your form. The bottom of the stocking has an opening with seam around which keeps the tights in better shape. Also works well as transition tights to pull the tights up around the calves."
4.0,Instructions were poor. But web site was good.
4.0,I sent this outfit back because I was giving the shorts  that was shorts shorts.
4.0,"I love this sports bra. I was looking for something that has a high neck and extends down to about mid-torso, and this was just as expected. It does run small. I normally wear a size medium sports bra and I purchased the US M/Tag L. It was a bit tight getting on which leads me to believe I could have perhaps sized up, but once it's on it fits nicely. For reference I am 35"" around the bust and wear a 34C. The broadest part of my shoulders is about 43"" -- I lift weights and have bigger lats, and this bra doesn't squish them down too much which is nice. Overall, I would recommend, but definitely think about sizing up if you're on the brink of sizes."
4.0,"I bought the wine red infinity scarf and it's exactly as pictured. It is soft, not scratchy or itchy. I like the way it nicely wraps on my neck. It is lightweight and not too bulky which is how I want it to be. It is a bit thin and see through and I dont know yet how it will hold up with repeated washing. I have only washed it once and the fabric is still soft and not falling apart. I think this scarf is good for low temperatures but can't really protect you from very cold temperatures. It came with a nice little pouch that is perfect if you want to give it to someone as a gift."
4.0,"The fit is tight and stretchy, I would’ve preferred cotton but the nylon material with the colors makes for a nice look. They also aren’t as lowcut as they appear."
4.0,I love it it was just a bit tight fitting for me.
4.0,It works as intended for my Apple Watch.
4.0,My daughter loved this gift! It was actually much better quality than I expected for a children's bracelet. The only thing is the size is not adjustable so it runs a little big.
4.0,This HoundsBay shoe horn was purchased because I need assistance to put on my shoes after surgery and needed something sturdy. It is the right length with great quality & sturdiness. I will be purchasing another one in a different color.
4.0,It doesn’t hold big natural boobies in place. Your boob won’t fall out but they sure will shift with a possible nip slip on the sheer part. Not for a mommy of a baby unless your boobs stay in place. Well made tho. Just not for me
4.0,The dress fit ok hiwever the pleets on the chest werent made correctly so they came out shortly after wearing it.
4.0,"A little tight for big heads,sounds good.<br />Will see how it holds up this Winter."
4.0,It was nice but the fit was quite a bit larger than the size guide.
4.0,"These are pretty nice. I got the black and brown colors and they look decent. They seem to run a bit large, so they are very loose on my wrist. The latch also works well. Haven't really had any issues. I wear them in the shower as well and they haven't frayed or shown any damage."
4.0,You need to order two sizes bigger than your normal size if you want these overalls to fit good.
4.0,Item was a little tight but still great.  Fabric is nice and smooth.  Not too thick or thin.
4.0,"purchased this for my  son who is obsessed with Phantom of the Opera. Its a little big, but fits well. Professional looking without the price."
4.0,So cute! Get compliments all the time. The only thing is that they can be too warm sometimes.
4.0,"The overall fit of the mask is nice, but the photo is too large. If the goal is funny then they’re successful. If the goal is to look realistic then the printed face is too large."
4.0,Beautiful..... classic look.
4.0,"Said to size up, so I did, so it's big and looks more like lingerie than any jacket."
4.0,It's very comfortable. I like the product. Will see how it will hold up after a while.
4.0,"I love this shirt, great for the gym.  Runs a little small."
4.0,Very nice looking and feeling shirt. Looks great on and fits true to size
4.0,"It is very pretty and exactly what I expected,  but I found out that I could have purchased it for a lot less on a different website."
4.0,Nice hat. Tighter than expected bit fits fine and still really cute.
4.0,"Product came fast. The whole thing was silver, no plastic. The studs itself are very hard. Especially the prongs. It looks nice. As long as you don't feel it."
4.0,"I love these shorts, they’re comfortable and they look really good end but overtime the material is not strong enough to hold the weight of the faux leather edges of the pockets and they start to rip."
4.0,Fits well however the bottom rolls up easily.
4.0,This pendant was a great value. The stone looks fine.
4.0,a little bit bigger than i'd like...but definitely a 'small' shirt...im just really skinny
4.0,"Buying gym clothes can be a hit or miss experience.  The majority of clothes like this are manufactured in China, where there sizes run a lot smaller than US sizes.  Fortunately I have a lot of shopping experience with ""Made In China"" items & I generally order 2 sizes larger, 3 if they are available.  I'm a large in typical American sizes *wear 38 jeans*.  I decided to order 3 sizes larger (XXXL) in these compression shorts & I'm very glad I did.  I've ordered 2xl compression shorts before & they fit but were a little too tight.  By ordering these 3 sizes larger it was just perfect for compression shorts.  There is NO bunching (if you know what area I mean), the shorts don't ride up & you aren't constantly pulling them up from them slipping off the hip.  This includes regular weight lifting like (bench pressing, etc.) but where it's important to not keep fixing your shorts like deadlifts, squats, leg extensions, etc.  They are nice looking shorts (I love the color) & are made of good quality fabric.  Of course I wear them under regular shorts or sweatpants because let's face it no one wants to see tight shorts only in the gym.  So if you are wanting to order them go 2 - 3 sizes up.  I took a star off just because the confusion for most people to buy gym clothes made in other countries.  I love them though & am happy with my purchase"
4.0,Thsy were a little bit larger than expected but they are extremely comfortable.
4.0,One star deduction for crease that I had to iron out.
4.0,"Like the quality, pretty sturdy. I wasn’t as ceazy about the style"
4.0,cute on me :)
4.0,Nicely made and as sheer as expected.
4.0,"This dress is very comfortable, for those days when nothing seems to appeal. It was a little smaller than I'd like in the bust ( 36D size L) but not small enough to return the dress. The length was as expected as well as the Fabric. I used 1 and 1/2  inch ribbon, fastened with velcro, to make a belt. Black belt on dark grey...very pretty!"
4.0,"The table is a good design & the wood & finish are beautiful.  However, there are 2 scratches & a wood chip in the top.  The top was also assembled offset & does not line up.  Packaging was in thin Styrofoam which was broken up by the table legs.  It was in little pieces everywhere.  It was stuck to the table & ended up over the floor.  This table could easily be wrapped & packaged in a more sustainable corrugated paper.  Green Amazon should eliminate Styrofoam from their supplier shipping material."
4.0,thought this was a spaghetti strap but the straps are loose and it has to be tied to your neck
4.0,I like this top
4.0,Producto de buena calidad
4.0,"It's a pretty pendant, but I did expect the crystal to have more of a reddish tint than it does. This is what caught my eye in the photos. It's going to take me a while to get used to the rose color of the chain. It's a much darker color than I expected and kind of cheapens the look a little to me. I wish they offered the pendant and chain in silver like they do the blue crystal. I think once I wear it more often, though, and get some earrings and maybe a ring to go with it to pull everything together, I'll like it a lot more. I'm not going to give up on it yet."
4.0,I bought this outfit and it fit perfect! I had so many compliments all night long on it. Its super soft and stretchy. My only problem was that the skirt is very sheer once its stretched out. I wore spanx under it and that worked great.
4.0,I bought these for my husband who works in construction.  They work great without the bulk of toboggans and scarves.  Quality made and great price!
4.0,Best Walter White replicas I could find.
4.0,I love this poncho. The only problem is it sheds every where. I am hoping that it will stop as I break it in.
4.0,"Much bigger than I thought, despite having an identical picture as a pair I previously bought - be sure to check the dimensions.  These are much too big for me to wear in a professional context."
4.0,I really like the outfit! Super cute and fits perfect. The only thing I dislike is after the 1 wash the elastic band in the pants and top gets all twisted and just doesn’t fit right anymore. So maybe hand wash or something. I got a size large.
4.0,These pants are very cute.  I have washed and dried them as instructed and they did not shrink.  They are a bit longer in the picture than they actually fit.
4.0,Very nice water shoe but runs on the small side. They do stretch so we were able to keep them
4.0,"Fits well, looks good! Not &#34;crushable&#34; as far as I can tell."
4.0,"These are great, they are light, stylish and breathable but the black one will not tighten in the back for me so it does not really work which is disappointing. The other two work well."
4.0,"It is pretty, the color was more of a orange. It is well made, excellent<br />bra for the price. I would buy again at this price."
4.0,It's a nice coat. Definitely runs small around the chest and shoulders. If you're a C-cup or bigger buy one size larger. I had to return the first one because it was too tight. The second one fits well but doesn't have the extra button or any labels. Even the little label with the size is cut off so I'm actually not sure if it's the size I ordered. But it fits so I'll keep it.
4.0,"work perfect for me, easily adjustable."
4.0,It has a round applicator and makes it s little hard to apply to hard to reach areas. But works real well.
4.0,"Can't beat these for the price. If you are not hung up on the name brand plastered on the edge, these are great."
4.0,Excelente producto para acudir al gimnasio
4.0,Too tight in the arms. Gave it to my teen. She gets lots of compliments on it. It is a very cute shirt.
4.0,"Very pretty earrings. The clasp seems like it might get loose quickly, but I guess only time will tell. The stones on the back of the earrings are unnecessary since they cannot be seen, and probably drive up the cost of these earrings. Though pretty, they are overpriced for what they are."
4.0,Fits nice. She wears it often.
4.0,These earings are very nice for the price. Not to heavy so it dose not pull on the earlobe. The rose quartz was more transparent than the picture. Overall adorable trendy earings for a great price. Will be buying more.
4.0,They are easy to lose
4.0,I like a little big. But I like.
4.0,I really liked it a little dmall bu cm but I love it I sewed it from the bottom and wow even better I love it so much 💓💓
4.0,"The lenses are big but, good quality I ordered a few pairs"
4.0,"I like this dress, except that its about 1-2 inches shorter than I expected.<br />Im 5'6 tall"
4.0,It fits the 5 cards that it says it does but sometimes the slide out card holders get stuck which can be kind of annoying when trying to get out a credit card to make a purchase. Overall it does what you need it to do but it can be problematic sometimes.
4.0,They're cute I got them sooner than expected.They don't look exactly like the picture (the pearls are smaller) but they stand out nicely.
4.0,This wallet was priced great and made well
4.0,"Fit is fine, warm, a fly would make them a 10."
4.0,"I got what I paid for.<br />Pretty good quality.<br />I like it, it's soft and stretchy."
4.0,"These don't really look like the one's in the pic advertised. I like them though, they have stretch to them and are really comfortable which is good for me because I have about 10 extra pounds around my belly right now..so they fit now and they will fit if/when I lose some weight!😉👍 They are pretty short..I'm only 5' and if they were any shorter, my butt would be hanging out! Haha I am glad I got them."
4.0,Enjoy these but they roll down. I'm constantly pulling them up to keep from sagging.
4.0,Shirt is very cute. My daughter loves it.  Material is very thin & see through.
4.0,LOOKS LIKE THE PICTURE GREAT FOR THE SUPER CHEAP PRICE
4.0,"impressed to find duck boot/shoe that comes in half sizes.  Fits like a glove. Appears to be well made, comfortable, good quality strings, good grip on slippery surfaces, decent insulation, and my feet aren't wet. Could be improved with a little pull tab on back of shoe to assist pulling the shoe on. Have only owned for a few weeks and have only walked a couple miles in it so far,  but--so far--so good."
4.0,Nice it was a gift he loved it
4.0,It fits well but the length is a bit long . Definitely looks better tucked in
4.0,"I'm shocked. I honestly expected to ship this back.  My body type is ""petite plus"" - large bust, smaller waist than hips, short waisted.  I took up sewing so I could have things that fit.<br />This fit great.  I can't speak to longevity yet, but I'm very pleased so far."
4.0,These were perfect for my 8yo child to keep her mask on her. Easy for her to attach to her face mask and adjust as needed. Only dislike was after 4 months the flowers broke or fell off.
4.0,a little tight around the arms. But overall good dress.
4.0,Goodhat
4.0,"Fun, sufficient quality, sized well, comfortable, and can dress up and down. It’s a winner."
4.0,"This dress is cute, my only complaint is the bottom material feels cheap and has a little sheen to it."
4.0,"I was surprised at how small these earrings are.  I thought 6mm would be bigger, the picture looked bigger.  I do really like how shiny they are, they are very pretty and delicate.  The next pair I order will be bigger. These would be perfect  if you have smaller ear lobes."
4.0,Pleased with the quality.  It was a gift for a friend.  She loves them.
4.0,"Good quality for the price.  It does keep twisting together though, just minutes into wearing it."
4.0,I think if you walk in to a building and you forget your sunglasses are on best it really does brighten up the room you got  something good
4.0,"Light weight, dont know if it will hold up.  My teenager really liked it"
4.0,I received so many compliments in this inexpensive top. I want to buy them in every color! Super cute but the upper arm sleeves are extremely tight. They are too narrow. I can live with it. Just grease my arms to get the thing off. It's worth it because it's flattering.
4.0,Nice comfortable material.  Long enough so it doesn't ride up when I lift my arms.
4.0,"Watch band seems of good quality. It feels good and looks great. But, I will have to take it to a watch jeweler to have the band put on. The fit on my old Seiko Titanium Kinetic watch is too tight for me to be able to get the pins secured in place."
4.0,Nice tee shirt. Good fit!
4.0,Very feminine and flows nicely.
4.0,I finally was able to make this work. It took a little while to get the straps to snap in place properly. Please disregard my previous review.
4.0,Pocket zipper came  dry and wouldn't zip. Other than that.... Lovely
4.0,Good but the color is light gray
4.0,Super useful! I have a LOT of cards and every single one of them has a space. The only thing I would critique is that the 2 zipper pouches can barely hold my phone (I have a Galaxy S9) and its hard to put  the money inside completely sideways. But it's not a deal breaker. Still super useful !
4.0,It's a little small and the fabric is very thin.
4.0,"First let me comment on the color, it is gorgeous. True to the image shown. The fabric on this is very flowy and light feeling. Great to wear during the summer during the hotter months. This is a longer shirt, think tunic length. It has some ruching at the bottom which adds a little extra flair. The neckline is nice and open, almost what I would call a boat neck top. The sleeves are nice, 3/4 length. The shirt is casual, however I'm sure with the right bottoms and accessories you could easily dress it up.<br /><br />Sizing is pretty close to USA standard sizing. I might recommend ordering a size up from what you normally would wear just to be on the safe side especially if you are ordering one of the plus sizes. I got the 3X and it fits me a bit snug.<br /><br />This washes wonderfully, however because of its thinner material, I put it in with my garments that I was on the delicate cycle just to be safe. Dries very nicely both in a dryer and by air drying. No shrinking issues.<br /><br />Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review."
4.0,"Just as described. Don't love 'em, don't hate 'em. They work fine."
4.0,real leather. snap on buckle.
4.0,Soft and cute.  Runs small though.
4.0,This bra is just what I have been searching for. I am a size 42DD and was looking for a bra that I could sleep in. This bra does not allow my breast to spill out. I have purchased 6  bras.
4.0,It's fitting as I expected but quite . overall I am happy with the purchase.sleeves are a bit long but I just push them up and gives it and looks pretty good!
4.0,"Have not given to wife yet, but they are large and she is not a large lady.  Liked the design, just not the size of them.  Hope she like them as the window has passed."
4.0,I ordered a large and it fit fine but that being said I wear a medium at most American retailers.  The fabrics are impressive for Amazon usually these are made of some cheap material/ slightly shiny.  Loved it immediately unfortunately the bust line is crooked and very noticeable as the buffalo plaid makes it pop. So sad to return and cant reorder a different one because out of stock.
4.0,The change compartment comes open too easy and the dollar bill area is on the wrong side.
4.0,"This top is fun to wear and looks great.  It is starting to pill a bit, and that's disappointing."
4.0,"Great support, breathable, and comfy! My &#34;go to&#34; for my morning workout."
4.0,"I ordered this in hopes that it would fit me but again I am disappointed in how clothing fits from sellers on Amazon. I did how ever give this to my 12 year old and it fits her wonderfully.  Its a Junior sized slim fit cable and popcorn stitch knit sweater. Material is medium-heavy thick weight and you can wear this alone with no under shirt. Finally fabric that is not see though!!! Nice material which is warm and cozy. We just got 13 inches of snow and it kept my daughter warm out side sledding. Only down side is that this runs small! Love the feel I want one in my size!!! If you look at the before  picture my daughter is wearing this and its form fitting. Only tag that is on is the one connected on the outside left hand side. No tags on the neckline to bother or irritate you. I received this item at a discount  in exchange for my honest  review. This had no effect on my opinion of this product, and i would have said the same thing if I had paid full price."
4.0,It has on and off weather for a trip and these came in so handy.
4.0,Work as expected and are a great price for a 2 pack. Would recommend. The ear plugs leave a lot to be desired but I haven't has success with any earplugs.
4.0,Fit as it expected. My books were just as big as expected.
4.0,fit as expected.<br />Good quality
4.0,Shirt was medium but smaller than a man's medium.  Hope it fits as it is a present.
4.0,I ordered a small.  Fits as expected.  I'm 5'1.  Will have to hem about 3 inches so it's not dragging on the ground.  Fabric is rayon.  Will need to iron after washing.
4.0,The necklace was great and the price was excellent too. I of the beads fell off the first time I wore it but I was able to reattach. Many people have commented in it - I will buy another !
4.0,"Like it, but it does pinch a little need to widen!"
4.0,I was thrilled to be able to design my own tshirt!  I would like for there to be more options in necklines...sleeve length (quarter sleeve) and the black color i ordered looked more like a faded black or gray.  overall I was happy with the fit
4.0,"The purse itself is good. It does take a couple of months to stretch out. My normal full size wallet (which is fairly empty) didn't fit in. You're going to have to work at it. Now after a couple of months I have my regular make-up bag(fairly empty), my favorite wallet and my eye glass case crammed in there. It's stretching out nicely. It's not perfect but, neither am I. :)"
4.0,"Cute dress! Has two layers of fabric, and if you wear dark undergarments they will definitely show through the dress! Also, if you're short, this dress will be longer than the picture."
4.0,"Cute top, soft, but a little snug in the waist. I usually wear a large but being pear shaped I should have sized up because the material does not have any stretch.  I think XL would have been too loose across the chest though."
4.0,Good for the price. Light is very dim
4.0,"I really like this necklace, the dove /pigeon is brilliantly shiny against the skin, and a good size (not too tiny).<br />The (other) round gem attached is nice, however because these 2 pendants are not freely moving on the chain, the round piece can throw the dove off center at times....I think due to weight competition."
4.0,"This is very nice for the price.  It arrived very wrinkled, but my steamer took care of that.  The material isn't bad. The fit was spot on and the length is good for me (5'2). I did go one size up - there is no stretch. I bought it in red and it is a nice color - not see through..."
4.0,"they fit well, not too much compression to make them difficult - just enough to help with swelling."
4.0,I love the print on the fabric and the back is very cute. It's very flattering. The small is a little big for me because I normally wear an extra small.
4.0,I bought this in white to wear with a denim jacket.  It fits perfect but not sure how I'm going to wear it because it's completely see-through!  Order something to wear underneath if you order white!
4.0,"Well....I first noticed the great price on a &#34;awesome deals&#34; website, so I quickly jumped on it....without really looking  that its not D&G its......DG .But I am the one to blame for that, nobody else.<br />Beside not being a true designer sunglass ( hello... its less then 7$ with shipping), its a generic sunglass nothing more, it is fairly large but it looks great on my wife ....although she will never probably wear it.<br />They where out from the black one , so I settled with a brown one after emailing back and forth with the seller.<br />I am a little dissapointed because of the label of the product being so close to a true designer one, I feel cheated .....but otherwise it would be unfair to say that its a bad product.<br />So if you don't mind that its not D&G ....go ahead ...be funky ....buy it!<br /> So I will give 4 stars because it DOESN'T SAY anywhere that its Dolce&Gabbana."
4.0,"Good Quality, fabric bit too thin so in light colors almost its almost sheer. Still they are beautiful and sexy with the Rhinestone straps on the side like higher end brands."
4.0,"This is a fine sweater knitted top ( almost like Italian knit) a bit heavy for hot weather,  with lace at bottom that is frayed.  Sizes run very large! Quality is good.  I am a size 4 and purchased a &#34;MEDIUM&#34; .  I have to return as it is to large for me and a bit heavier then I wanted.  Hence the 4 stars"
4.0,"Nice belt, came in a little darker yellow than picture, but still pretty."
4.0,"These earrings come with a cleaning wipe. That’s a very nice touch. They are smaller than I’d hoped. I have included a photo of them next to a dime. I like the CZ’s. Those are alway fun. The gold plating seems thick enough to keep me from having allergies to the darlings themselves. Overall, not bad for the value. Just remember, they are roughly the size of a dime."
4.0,"Very cute, shorts are bit wider then expected but still cute and pretty pattern"
4.0,A lot larger than expected good quality just really big
4.0,I just received my new band and I love it. Feels good on my wrist.  Lightweight and perfect for my workouts. The free cover cases also a plus.
4.0,Bought for my 5 year old son.. he loves it. But it’s very Large. Adult size.
4.0,I have a big dome. It’s a bit on the right side. The visor is not made for big domes.<br />I love the shade it provides.<br />Great for the pool and beach.
4.0,Moyabo womens short sleeve dress. Cute style and color. The overall fit is accurate and the dress fits good. I recieved a size medium and I am 111lbs 5'4 and a 34D. The top is not really fitted but it is not baggy either. The rest of the dress is straight fit so a bit large on me but given my chest and weight I am used to this type of fit in dresses. The straight line made it ok that the dress was larger on me everywhere else.  Cute ruffled sleeves and hem. The dress is decent quality and is not see through. Cute for work or a date night. I really like the deep rose color.
4.0,Earring was broke when I recieved it
4.0,Very good gloves quick shipping.<br />One seems to have developed a tiny tear in it but otherwise great
4.0,"While this flower was very beautiful and specific to my sister's birth month, I really wanted it daintier. The necklace is larger than expected with the chain thicker as well. The design makes up for it though with a beautiful pearl color with gold birth flower."
4.0,I have several pairs of sunglasses and the multi-pack was convenient. I wish they were slightly longer but I'm  very satisfied overall
4.0,I ordered size medium. It's a really nice looking skirt that seems very warm and well made. Mine arrived with the sizing tag cut off by some scissors and I can only just *barely* zip it up if I suck in everything I've got. I can't tell if they sent the wrong size or if I should have ordered a different size up since the tag was mysteriously removed.
4.0,This robe is super warm and comfortable. The only reason I gave it four stars is due to the sleeves being a little shorter than I would like. I purchased the black and love the color.
4.0,Im 8 months pregnant ordered a xxl it was wayy to big among other things. So returned it and got a large or med cant remember but its so much better. Great dreas.
4.0,I love the material; it’s very comfortable and good quality.  I like the pattern as well.  I just don’t think it’s flattering because it hangs like a bag instead of fitting curves.  But it is comfy.
4.0,"This pocket watch is just beautiful. The gentleman I bought it for will love it. Smooth classic style in gloss black with no un-necessary frills. It's perfect! I hoped it might be a hand wind, but I still love it."
4.0,"I loved this dress. It was everything I was hoping for, cute but sexy at the same time. I get lots of compliments every time I wear it. I only gave it four stars because the lining on the top needs to be stitched but it's a minimal thing."
4.0,It's not really a sweater it's more of a light Jacket ..it's real soft has a silk feel to it  fits true to size will purchase from this company Again LOVE IT
4.0,Snug but very cute. Order up sizes.
4.0,"Nice feell to the material, colors are as shown. The sleeves are a little long but not terrible. Has had limited washings so no feedback on durability/fading."
4.0,They were a lot smaller than expected but still cute
4.0,Very soft and comfortable from the moment I put them on.
4.0,"This was an impulse buy for me. I randomly realized that my entire family had flannel plaid shirts, except me.  When I was looking for a flannel shirt, I found this.<br />I was a bit concerned when purchasing this dress that it would be a lycra like texture or like workout gear. I've run into that issue before.  But when I finally pulled it out of the package, I considered moving it into my pajama rotation it was soo soft.  My husband and kids kept petting me.<br />As for the fit, the arms were a bit tighter than I'm comfortable with, but I have thicker arms and run into that a lot.  The length was perfect for wearing with leggings or stockings. I'm 4'11"" with short legs and a normal torso, so the hem hits me right below the knee.<br />I recomend this dress to anyone who wants to feel like a PJ Queen: comfy, warm and good lookin!"
4.0,Love this dress! The fabric is a bit stiff but other wise this dress is awesome!
4.0,"Good leggings. - don’t know  what else to say.  They fit well, wash well and we’ll see how long they last."
4.0,"Buy two tiny screwdrivers and expect to replace the battery in a few days, other than that, very cool, unique, functional watch."
4.0,"I like this dress but because most of my excess weight is in my stomach, it doesn't look quite as good when I wear it as I hoped. It is a pencil dress so it is form fitting and on top it fits great, the middle area though makes it look like I have an innertube on underneath the dress. I think putting on shapewear underneath would help slightly but not completely eliminate the problem for me. I think most women though would look good in this dress provided you don't have a big stomach and your weight is more evenly distributed. The maroon and black color blocking give it an unusual but nice look.<br /><br />I am 5'6"" with a slightly long torso for that height and the dress comes down about 2 inches below my knee. I washed in cold water on the delicate cycle and hung it up to dry and there were no issues."
4.0,"I've only had these a week and they're some of the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. I got them to treat plantar fasciitis so I'll just have to wait and see whether they help eliminate that problem. My only complaints are that for slippers, these shoes are fairly heavy and &#34;clunky&#34; to wear around the house, not to mention pretty expensive. Nevertheless, so far I really like them."
4.0,Smaller than a usual man's watch.  But it is good to have.
4.0,It it perfect but just a bit short.
4.0,The dress is pretty but te elastic is unconfortable
4.0,"These are a bit loose. However, they are soft, comfortable, and really like the roll top."
4.0,Perfect! Exactly what I wanted and really cut with oversized sweatshirt!
4.0,"This skirt is very cute and looks almost exactly like the picture. I deducted one star because there were many hanging strings/seams so the sewing could use some work. Other than that, it's very cute!"
4.0,The waist is too large. The pants slip down. I'm 5'9 140 lbs and quite fit. I ordered a medium. They are good for yoga but not for running.
4.0,the item just arrived today (Dec 27) so I was unable to give the gift to the person with her other Christmas gifts.<br />But it looks  good and was well received (finally) by the receipient
4.0,"Baby has not worn yet, her head is so little yet. Hoping she will wear it this summer."
4.0,"I really like all the compartments. Holds all my gym clothes, my change of clothes, water bottles, and shoes. Minimal design and size, so I'm not lugging around a duffle all day."
4.0,"Exactly as pictured, size matches description. High quality. I think they are a touch heavier than I like & therefore they became loose. I might reorder in a size larger."
4.0,"Should have got a medium, but it was still cute!  I received several compliments."
4.0,"I am 5'2&#34;, 115 lbs.  I ordered medium size, it's a little loose on me but looks good.  The fit was comfortable so I kept it."
4.0,"This is a purse, not shoes, as you indicated in your review questions.  Great color, nice size.  My only complaint is that the strap is a bit uncomfortable after a few hours, wish it was wider."
4.0,Put them in my shoes and felt immediate relief from ongoing discomfort.
4.0,Purchased as gift. Do NOT yet know how gloves perform.
4.0,"Nice many pockets and warm. It does a bit small and fits really snug, so size up."
4.0,I did not rec. bracelet with the watch.
4.0,Love the fit. feels really comfy. Will buy another pair
4.0,Nice but the straps are a little too short.
4.0,The fit was a little tight but it seems to just be the fabric isn't as stretchy as other pairs I've had.
4.0,It fits well but my only issues are that it's not bathroom friendly and I wish I had options to choose for a clear or dark lens on the mask
4.0,My wife was very happy with Jewelry!
4.0,Liked the shoe did order a size larger like other reviews suggested I didn’t like that the size 13 wasn’t part of prime and I had to pay for delivery that sucked because all the other sizes were prime and if they didn’t run small I could have ordered his size without paying extra.
4.0,"Great quality material. Not thin like others. Only problem, seems to run a little small in size. My daughter 7 and wears a size 6x or 7 so figured it would fit. When I tried to return it I was told to keep it and got my refund. I will purchase from them again but will probably go a size bigger."
4.0,Good solid shiry
4.0,Love the style  - front pockets and small back zipper pocket. But these run small. I ride almost exclusively in Irideon tights - summer and winter styles - and only these mediums are a little too tight.
4.0,I am very suprised with quality - these are awesome!  They are heavy as part of the frame is metal and do not feel cheap.  I bought them for my brother as a birthday gift and i told him they were knock-offs.  He told me the next day that he was pretty sure they are real and they must have made a mistake!  No joke.
4.0,I really liked this dress. I ordered a size 10 and my sister in law a size 12. She had to alter hers a little. I did not but probably could have around the straps. I wore it as a bridesmaid dress to my sisters wedding. It takes a long time to tie and put on though but it’s very pretty. I only gave it four stars because the side ripped out. My sister in laws did not but but mine did.
4.0,My nephew was so happy to receive these in the mail. Star Wars is a favorite of his. He doesn't hesitate to wear hat and gloves on cold days now.
4.0,"Very comfortable. The material might be a little too impermeable for working out in, so I'll update after I do. But they are super comfy. I general wear a size 5-6 in jeans and bought the L in these. They fit great. I recommend."
4.0,"This chain is great, made well, nice design and look good with many different pendants."
4.0,"very good, came with a case too."
4.0,Good and versatile. It will last a good while.
4.0,Comfortable and looks good.  Little support but I still like them.
4.0,"I like the back straps that criss cross so no strap slippage. The colors are flattering. Is a good suit to swim laps in, or partake in water aerobics. It is not chlorine resistant, which is why the one reviewer had the issue she did with the deteriorations. It is the perfect suit for what I want."
4.0,"The fabric is stiff and makes a rustling sound. The fabric is durable and washes well and fairly comfortable. I just wish it felt and sounded less plastic like, it is quick drying so expect some compromise."
4.0,Nice hand fill looks sharp. Only complaint is item received is NOT what’s pictured. What was pictured is a two piece case consisting of a soft inner shell and a hard outer shell. What I received is a one piece case u get at a mall kiosks.
4.0,It fits perfectly. It comes just below the ankle.  I would have loved it if it could cover the ankle as well.
4.0,"Fits so well. Its fitted, can be dressed up or down. Super Cute!!!  A Must Have😜😜"
4.0,It was good for an 80s party I went too.
4.0,"Runs small. Don't buy if you have boobs lol I have a 32DDD and got a large, which fits in other styles. My boobs feel like they'll they'll out in this. It's cute but I can't wear it out. I only paid $7.99 so I'll keep it for private parties/stuff since it's not worth the return and does fit. Also a Thong bottom so expect like zero butt coverage."
4.0,"The bottoms are super cute and super comfy especially for a plus sized lady. But the top, however cute it may be, does not have a lot of support. I didn't expect that it would, but if you are large breasted like me you may be disappointed in the way your tatas look in this. However my man loved it and that's all that really matters right?"
4.0,very nice some what small
4.0,Fits just about right
4.0,"I love this pretty little ear cuff! The delivery was super quick and the cuff is the perfect overall size. The other great thing is that it is sterling silver, meaning it should not have issues with tarnishing and is great for sensitive skin. My only issues were that I had a bit of trouble fitting the cuff to my ear. Being handy with a pair of pliers, this was not actually a huge issue for me. Now it fits snugly on my ear and does not hurt like ear cuffs I've had in the past."
4.0,not ban
4.0,"I liked it good price,my girl loved the butterfly design cool"
4.0,I bought four packages of these.  Love them.  Wear them daily.  Breathable and clean well in the laundry.
4.0,They look better in the picture. When I got them home you can see large stitch lines and lose threads. Not the best made shirts I purchased from Amazon
4.0,Did come sooner than was supposed to outfit fit great other than the stockings they did not fit at all they look like socks in the picture but it's actually stockings would have gave it five stars if the stockings were actually socks
4.0,I like that this dress can be dressed up or down. I've worn it  with some chucks and some heels. Every girl needs a versatile LBD
4.0,Bought these for my great niece who is 7 mos old and very petite. They’re so darn cute but they are much larger than expected especially in the width and keep falling off her feet. Hopefully she’ll grow into them before the end of the summer. Did I mention they’re so darn cute lol.
4.0,"I love this sweater. The color is the same as described. It's soft.  The sizing is on point.  My only issue is, why is there no tag to distinguish the front from the back?"
4.0,"Great dress for the price. The material wrinkles somewhat easily, but that’s just something that goes along with it. I got lots of compliments!"
4.0,Nicely put together - cushie sole - zipper nice feature - still breaking them in - 4 out of 5 STARZ!
4.0,"I like the product however, it isn't Alex and Ani.  I find it to be a bit smaller and more difficult adjust."
4.0,Very cute and stylish. Great product for the price.
4.0,Straps hard to stay straight and get even but besides that great bag
4.0,"I normally wear a small or extra small, but ordered the medium and it fits very nicely. The knit fabric has a slight sheen and drapes nicely, and I ordered a second one in white. Make sure to read the sizing chart, as the sizes are not typical, but they are true to the measurements in the chart."
4.0,"It has finally hit 85 in the city tonight and this is the perfect night to wear this robe around the house while the AC is cranking. The material is thin and the size runs on the small side but is otherwise a nice and plain robe in a pretty color, like wearing hubby's t-shirt but more coverage!"
4.0,"It was way too small. It's not U S size, it's actually Asian size. But on the plus side they have wonderful customer service."
4.0,"I got this in navy blue and paired it up with some navy blue tights. Looked great, my only issue is, was I felt the arms were a little tight. So I would probably size up one size."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:da281525afb0d1c05fd75b67c76893a7]] I gave this band 4 stars because I wish it were a little wider. As you can see from the video I have the Apple Watch Ultra which has a wider face. I want all my bands to be wider to compliment this new size watch. I would say this watch band is slightly slimmer than the original Apple silicon bands. As you also can see from the video it does fit an Apple Watch Ultra…lol I love this color! That’s what drew me to get this watch band. I love having a pop a color for dreaded NY winters and a fun color for the summer. This band is water and sweat resistant. It’s easy to clean with a wipe or a damp cloth. One other slight con is the C-hook started to slide out but this was at the end of the day. I had also been carrying a lot of bags at once and taking off my backpack. But if this is suppose to be as durable and rugged as the Apple’s band then it’s not living up to those expectations. I just need it for everyday use and for $10 it’s a good deal.
4.0,"I really like this band, the only small problem I have is its not long enough for my wrist, I wish they came in a longer size for bigger wrists"
4.0,It fits right and looks exactly as it did online
4.0,Cute and small.
4.0,"Stay on all day, daughters like them"
4.0,"These leggings came faster than expected and are super adorable!  They are indeed way too large, but I can't wait for my daughter to wear them (maybe when she's 6 mo to a year)!  If I have any complaints, then i'll be back to update this post."
4.0,This top is very pretty with nice detailing. I purchased two of them but they are very baggy not well tailored. Hangs down at chest and shoulder area.
4.0,I bought this for a cheer competition that required clear bags.  It did the job and held up fine.  The only thing is that I wish it had more pockets/separation.
4.0,Bought for cos play its true to size and color the only thing was the details on the front I thought should go around to the back but they do not. Other than that I have no complaints.
4.0,"Margrine Women's Long Sleeve Open Front Chunky Knit Cardigan Loose Cardigans Sweater<br />Size Large - I'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs. The large is definitely too big but I wanted it oversized!<br /><br />The knit is loose, soft, and snuggly. The one thing I don't like about the sweater is the care instructions which recommend the sweater is hand washed. However, I always just put all my sweaters into laundry bags and toss them in the washing machine. This sweater included. Then I toss it in the dryer for a few minutes and hang the rest of the way to dry. The sweater has long sleeves that are puffy! So comfortable! 4 Stars! Hope you find this review and pictures helpful!"
4.0,My kid loves these goggles and they fit her perfectly. The only downside is the lenses scratch easily.
4.0,Super cute - good quality.
4.0,This skirt is described as having an elastic waist band which it DOES NOT. It has little stretch and enclosure has a zipper.  Will have to gift it. Beautiful material but this is not going to work for me. I ordered an xl should have gone up in size.
4.0,Not as small as I thought but still worked great
4.0,"The chemical smell is pretty bad.  But I soaked them in Oxi Clean a couple of times and they're good.  I also reinforced the button stitching based on the other reviews.  All things considered, I'm buying another pair, another color.  :-)"
4.0,"This is a nice shirt, the only thing I didn't like is ,that it does wrinkle easy. Personally I don't want to look like I just slept in it."
4.0,"I would have rated the MODA ESSENTIALS MEN'S SHERPA LINED ZIP UP HOODIE SWEATSHIRT a five, but the wrist and waist bands could fit a great deal better. Here's the problem. The MODA ESSENTIALS MEN'S SHERPA LINED ZIP UP HOODIE SWEATSHIRT purpose is to keep one warm. However, the wrist and waist bands allow one's body heat to escape, diminishing it's purpose. The hoodie is warm and light weight. This makes is perfect to wear in the house. I forget I have it on. As a result, I'm able to lower the heating temperature in my home."
4.0,"It is was a little hot to wear and hard to see out of the keyhole, but other than that the mask worked great."
4.0,It is a very nicely made metal wallet. Only issue is it is a little bit of a pain to remove cards from it. If you pinch the bottom the top opens up making it much easier to remove cards from it. This is still well worth the money and is a well made product.
4.0,"Very sturdy bags and I love the teal color. They’re deep and easy to fold up. I have to say, however, that I was really bummed when I opened my package to see that the items were packaged in a PLASTIC BAG, which is why I’m rating this 4 stars. I see that they asked to “reuse” on the bag...but come on. It seemed really counterproductive to the company’s mission and I would like that the company considers an alternative to their packaging that aligns with the greater purpose and cause here."
4.0,"Two years later, and this cheaply made dress is still kicking it!  Used at least 6 times and washed half the time, because the glitter gets on anything."
4.0,"Heavier than I like, shrunk a-little but ok.  I will have to wear in colder weather."
4.0,This was My daughters fathers christmas gift from her. He seen them and was a bit confused at first. But once using them said he loved them.
4.0,They look cool and they work as advertised.  Would buy again.
4.0,"This is the summer belt I've been looking for! Perfect straw look, stretchiness, and size. The one thing that would improve it is a loop to keep the loose end from flopping down. I used a  blond ponytail holder to unobtrusively keep it under control until I can crochet a loop for it."
4.0,Great bag just not for me
4.0,"I like the breath ability but for me and my large head, they are too tight and a bit hard to get over my head to put on.  They also arrive with a bad plastic sort of smell."
4.0,Love the product. I was scared at because there was no reviews on it it was bigger than expected but overall nice necklace.
4.0,"A little bigger than I expected, but it'll do. Great value."
4.0,"Worth the price for sure! Hard to see that the arms are glittery from the picture, but that is fine."
4.0,The pants are much longer than i expected and I'm 5'7'' but otherwise great semi-formal pants. Overall... I'm very satisfied with this purchase.
4.0,"This is a very pretty, well made, and comfy cozy, soft hoodie. The seamstress in me loves the fabric content with the poly, cotton, and spandex blend. It makes a more soft, plush, and stronger fabric blend than just a poly or poly/acrylic and spandex blend. But, it also has less stretch, which may account for the sizing issue.<br /><br />I ordered according to the chart and the sizing is a bit smaller than expected. It is too small in the width of the top and the width of the sleeves. The sleeves could also be longer. It seems shorter in the back than the front, even though I'm more busty and than booty, so it should be the other way around. And, standing at only 4'11, it doesn't quite cover my whole backside, which would be nice, so I could wear it comfortably with leggings.<br /><br />I haven't washed it yet, but when I do, I will try stretching it by laying it flat to dry. Anything with spandex should always be washed in cold water either on a gentle cycle or in a lingerie bag to help prevent pilling. And, it should always be air dried, as heat will quickly cause the fabric to degrade.<br /><br />If you order up a size or two you will love this top, it will be great! I do like the top, I just wish the sizing was proper."
4.0,"I can wear this and I will. The material is great and it will work, just not with the skirt I purchased it for. Mainly because it is not really white, but an off white."
4.0,"A very comfy dress. I usually have trouble with one piece dresses unless they are petite because I am short-waisted but this fit perfectly, and the bodice was not too low cut."
4.0,Not a true size 11.
4.0,I got these yesterday.  they seem cheaply made but for the price I cannot complain. They seem to work perfectly for what is needed. and I am thankful
4.0,I love how they feel on but my only complaint is the back pockets flip up since I got them showing the white... if it didn’t do that definitely 5 stars
4.0,"This dress is as adorable in person as it is in the pics! I got SO many compliments when I wore it to a work event I was hosting and it was actually really comfortable, considering I was running around all night (definitely more comfortable than my shoes! lol) The length was a little long so I had four inches taken off and probably could have gone five or six to make a true cocktail dress. The bust area was also a little tight but once I had my Spanx on, it laid pretty well and I didn't need to sew the gap shut. Overall, I was impressed with the make and design, as well as the materials themselves. The skirt is a little prone to wrinkling; have the dry cleaners starch and press it and you'll be good to go. I'm definitely happy I made this purchase, especially at such a great price!"
4.0,The material that makes the colored parts is a little fragile:(
4.0,[[VIDEOID:e33e888bb41bdbe0e81c3c338b30e326]] What do you expect for the price. Not bad quality. Hinge/attachment could be better.
4.0,"I love it! The only issue is it doesn't go off the shoulder like the photo. Everyone else was right, it's almost like a boat neck top. Otherwise, it's very versatile and comfortable!"
4.0,There cool
4.0,It was smaller and more cropped than I expected. I have very large boobs and purchased the biggest size. I ended up returning.
4.0,"I got the blue and the color is nice.  The bottom band seems smaller than in the pictures.  It fits as expected but as often the case, the items in the pictures seem to be a better quality than the product I received.<br /><br />It's okay for the price."
4.0,"For the price, it's a good value.  It's not very rugged, but it's fine for a season's wear.  I wear it often."
4.0,This is a good set. The Knife steals the spotlight and it has great realistic size and look. Mask fits my relatively large head well but the neckline is not long enough and it has a very unpleasant smell.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that you will find my review helpful.
4.0,"This boot is a nicely made fun boot; I purchased the pair to wear at a Hallloween Gala masquerade costume party to match a pirate outfit I will be wearing.The boot is large in the thigh area and can not be adjusted and I am short so they come up very high on me;I gave them four instead of five stars for this reason.The boot itself fits great in the base(shoe) area ,the inside is soft and not rough,they lace all the way up the frount of the boot to the top.They are very comfortable to walk in and are made good and are not slippery when walking in them I'm going to wear them to the party but not sure how much use I will wear them after that.I hope my information was helpful to you :-)"
4.0,"Love the color and design, but a little bit soft"
4.0,It was very easy to set up. I cant wait for thw garage door updates.
4.0,"Nice dress and material, a little heavy. Just washed it and it seems to be fine, no shrinkage or bleeding colors."
4.0,It's a beautiful bracelet and feels great when worn!  Could easy give it five stars if it wasn't for the sizing tool.  The sizing tool is cheap and low quality.  I screwed it in to push a link out and the point on the tool bent.  Fortantly for me I had another sizing tool I bought to work on watches.  It easily pushed the pen out and I had the two links out I needed removed.  I took the bracket a apart and put it back together in about five minutes.<br /><br />I bought this to replace a cooper bracelet that broke after many years of wear.  It did not have magnetics.  In just a short time I can tell the magnets really do help.  Wish I had gone to copper with magnets sooner!
4.0,My girl friend liked it so much! Lovely
4.0,"I heard and wouldn't doubt that the images printed onto the sweatshirt might come off, but it is soft inside and good material aside from the print!"
4.0,She likes them a lot
4.0,Shoes are cute have not worn must find the right outfit the outfit I bought from Amazon with it was too small even though I bought it in a big size
4.0,"Pros: it's a terrific looking watch. It keeps great time. It self-winds.<br />Cons: sometimes it just stops for hours at a time and I have no idea why. Then it will start up again and keep perfect time.<br /><br />Mostly, I bought it because I enjoy having a watch on my wrist and this one looks good. If I really, really need to know what time it is, I can always look at my cell phone."
4.0,"Material and design are great, but it runs small, so sadly I had to returned it"
4.0,I love the way they feel and the fact that you can not see any skin while wearing. My only complaint is the top rolls down constantly on me. I'm very sure it is because I am a bigger female with a belly but other than that they are very nice!
4.0,I sell compression socks for my company and the socks is perfect for female or small Men's feet.
4.0,"Maybe I didn't read the information right before I ordered, but it was too long for me. it's a little longer than the one I've been wearing and I didn't like how that looked. otherwise it seems fine!"
4.0,"Great little earrings, but the metal and crystals are much darker than pictured."
4.0,"For my 12yo petite daughter. The top fit great, but the bottoms not so much. The back part shows too much of her buttcheeks. She didn't like it either(thankfully!!)"
4.0,Bought these for my girls and they love them. They use them for dress up and they are still in as good of shape as they were 1 month ago which doesn't normally happen with their play clothes.
4.0,I bought a pair for my sister's birthday May 2018. She loved them! After 8 months of constant wearing from sipping her morning coffee to running down the street after a kid she asked for a new pair for Christmas. So of course I got her another pair. They are extremely comfortable. She's on her feet all day as a stay at home homeschooling mom and loves them.
4.0,Shoes are surprisingly light weight. Fit is on the big side but within fixable limits.
4.0,Love it looks great. The only reason I gave 4 stars is the elastic strap is a little tight for my big head.
4.0,"Ok, design is interesting. I was trying to replace my existing flower sticks, a cheapy set I found at a Goodwill and taught myself with.<br />These.... hmm... they remind me of what you would get if your were looking to take your practice to a nice comfortable hotel room. Compact, lightweight. However, the weight and size difference are just a little beyond my comfort zone. Final judgement: usable, but not optimal. I might teach my littles how to use this set, however."
4.0,"I like the shoes, but they do not fit my baby's feet. The mesh is non stretchable, was hard to put on."
4.0,"I loved it, only think I disliked is that it doesn’t sit flat on shoulders since it’s just a straight fabric, it doesn’t have the crevices like a normal stole does to fit nicely on the shoulders without weird bumps or it lifting"
4.0,Nice shirt but two of the button holes were sewed shut. Easy fix...just an fyi.
4.0,"Nice looking, very practical usage, right size to store my intelligent car key hooked on my jeans belt loop. Strong hook clip. However, I found that the leather attachment from the case to the hook clip could have been better reinforced, since with use there has been some 'play' in the material as if it got slightly stretched from unintended tugging back and forth.. As a result, I have a somewhat fear that one day the case may break off from the hook clip with the possiblility of me losing my car key.."
4.0,"Looks pretty awesome. However the quality of the materials are not that great. I guess we get what we pay. If you are batman fan and doesn't have many cards to carry, It's recommended."
4.0,Nice sunglasses.  The wife uses them for tennis.
4.0,Project came wrinkled and was hard to even remove them with the steamer before I hand washed it
4.0,"I got this SONJA BETRO Women's Printed Knit Wrap Dress Plus Size in a 3xl for my mom who is still recovering from breast cancer surgery. The dress at first they thought was a weird night gown due to the material being so thin and silky.<br />The dress fit her well but as you can see in the photos is very thin. She has a full white tank under it with the built in bra as she only can wear them while she is recovering. You can clearly see the top in the photo on her from behind.<br />It may work for her if she was to wear only nude on the undershirt, but just be aware that this is a very thin material."
4.0,The color is like dirty dishwasher with a blueish very tint. Not what I was hoping for. Otherwise the quality was fairly good. No other issues
4.0,Wazhable
4.0,"Nice top... see through which is why I bought this top... It wrinkles easily though, reason why i didn’t give it 5 stars"
4.0,Very pretty.  I enjoy wearing it.
4.0,"This thing really works. It would be better for me,  personally, if it was a smidge bigger or a touch smaller but it definitely works."
4.0,"This jacket is way thicker than I thought it would be. It’s very nice material. Keeps you very warm for a sweat jacket. However the sleeves are ridiculously long, I have to fold the sleeves up twice just so I can still use my hands. Also not only are the sleeves long, they are very wide. I feel like I can wear 2 jackets underneith and this jacket would still be comfy. That’s the only negative I have about it."
4.0,"I have an artsy side to me and a colorful personality! I love the print. I did receive many compliments on the print and turtle neck. The fabric is ok, it's not the best but certainly not bad for the price. I suggest to anyone to order a size up. I am glad I did and I am comfortable when I wear it! It washed very nicely, I did not put it in the dryer I dried it flat on a towel. It does hug you..."
4.0,Love the fit and the pockets but the design was a little much one me.
4.0,"Love the dress! Four stars only because of how thin the material is, I have to use a slip underneath."
4.0,Good looking product.Love it.
4.0,"Ordered this for an upcoming trip. It does not flatter my shape as I'd hoped, but it does look pretty good. Hides extra belly weight rather well for those like me who had a child at 40... It is a bit heavier material than I thought it would be, so I can't see wearing it on a hot day as anticipated. But I definitely like it and look forward to wearing it in the evening when it's a bit cooler, or out to a restaurant."
4.0,This is a standard nice terrycloth--not super soft nor plush--does the job just fine
4.0,The fleece is not what was expected.  They grip the snow very well when walking my dog.
4.0,I really liked this even though it was bigger then I thought it would be.
4.0,"This little hat is so cute and they had a variety of colors to choose from. The quality is great and the texture is not abrasive at all. However, it is not made of the bathing suit material. It is good as a little sun hat. Fit my niece well. Her face is perfectly shaded from the sun. It has little straps on it to tie it under her chin to make sure it does not fall off. My niece had a hard time with that because she is not used to having things on her head but she quickly got used to it and did not even realize it was there. After a fun day at the beach I checked under her hat and there was no burning or rash from the hat. She stayed refreshed the entire time. She was not sweaty a lot due to the hat. The quality in material was great and there were no loose strings or frays on the hat. The stitching was done in great quality and I definitely recommend this hat to anyone looking for something stylish and cute for their little one to wear in the sun. The designs are adorable and this is so simple to use and wont get hung up on anything and risk choking the children.<br /><br />I received this child sun shade hat discounted in exchange for my honest and unbiased review on the product. The fact that I received a discount doe snot affect my review on the product."
4.0,I have received the above item Today . Thank you for reaching me just on time.<br />The specifications and make of the specticle is excelent .
4.0,"I got this for my tragus and it was too big. Granted, I have small ears but I don't know how well it's work for any tragus piercing, plus the ball screws on in the back so it would be hard to screw on in your ear.<br />Otherwise, good quality. I was worried because of the picture but it looks good."
4.0,Quick Delivery and good price!
4.0,Cut to fit easily. I put a lot of miles on my shoes and time will tell...
4.0,"I prefer a large cosmetic bag - this one holds enough, but I wish it had separate compartments.  Aside from that, it's a great bag and looks nice."
4.0,"This dress is cute - I think I ordered one size too big because it gaps around the bust area so that you can see my bra from the side, but I wore this as a swimsuit cover so it wasn't a big issue."
4.0,Perfect pair if soccer cleats
4.0,"Much better than the short torso one that I previously bought, but this one can sure be tricky to get on and adjusted correctly!"
4.0,These are for a wide face or men. So many compliments for the style and reflective rainbow coating.
4.0,As a belt this works well.  The only drawback is that the buckle clamp on the belt can work loose; you almost need to tape it shut.
4.0,"Very adorable suit! The material is good quality and it is not see through at all. The bottoms are full coverage and there is padding in the top. I ordered a large from reading other reviews and I am 5'3, curvy, and 125 lbs. I typically wear a medium, but ordered a large because it runs small. The large bottoms fit perfectly and the top was slightly loose but I think it was because of the clasp, I took it off and tied it instead and it was a perfect fit. The pattern is not fluid, but you can not tell unless you are staring at it intensely. I am very happy with the price of this suit and the quality!"
4.0,Quick shipping and great quality for the price. Super cute
4.0,Nice design and comfortable.  Washed well with little to no shrinkage.
4.0,"XL is more like a Large, and it does fit, but they run small"
4.0,They are very nice even though they are not the color I ordered.
4.0,"Very cute.  Now that it has been worn intermittently by a young adult (gently worn) for several weeks, the stitching on a seam came loose.  Easily repairable, but shouldn't have to."
4.0,"First things first, going into it I knew the bottoms would be too large for me.<br />I'm smaller framed 5'2'' a US size 8 in bottoms, but I have 34 D's so unfortunately I have to sacrifice bottoms never fitting for chest comfort.<br />That being said the the XL top fit my D-cups PERFECTLY, I couldn't be happier!<br />It shows just enough cleavage through the mesh and you can tie it as tight/lose as you need to(though I do prefer straps over tie-back tops)<br /><br />The bathing suit as a whole seems decently made, no obvious issue with it so far. The mesh seems sturdy.<br /><br />Sad the bottoms don't fit, but again it was expected and I was in it for the adorable top anyways!<br />They would probably fit a US size 12(give or take) perfectly."
4.0,Good quality goggles for good price.
4.0,Nice quality. Thanks.
4.0,"I was worried about the quality with the price I got these for, but they are good quality and our groomsmen looked amazing in them."
4.0,"I really love this shirt, the only issue I have is that the lettering started to peel off after one wash (not even put in the dryer).<br /><br />This needs to be washed on gentle with your fingers crossed."
4.0,Pockets very convenient for holding phone and keys. Would give it a 5 star if the fit was more comfortable.  The short move lower in the back when bending.
4.0,"I found this dress on amazon, after my daughter found it on another website. The price was approx $20 cheaper on amazon. It took 3 weeks longer than was promised due to getting hung up in customs. The blue color was more blue than teal, as in the pics. The size is about one size smaller than expected, but thankfully I ordered a size larger, anticipating tailoring. It's higher quality than I expected. Looks beautiful on my daughter! Overall very happy with the purchase!"
4.0,"Mmmm...not really my style but it looks ok.  The material kind of soft, feels like cotton material with a little spandex. It does have a little stretch! I have the size small (5'4 195lbs curvy).  It didn't fully meet my expectations...it doesn't really mold to my body the way I would like but it fits decent. The arms are big and floppy as pictured (Lol)."
4.0,Very feminine & cute.
4.0,"First off, the dress came two or more weeks before the estimated shipping date. Yipee! Anyways, when I got it, it didn't have any problems with it. There were no stains from the sewing machine, no flyaway strings, nothing! The only problem was that it needed to be ironed badly!<br /><br />Overall, I really like this dress. It's really cute! My biggest issue is how thin the top part it! It's incredibly easy to see through and see your bra. I'm guessing skin colored bras will work and all but you might be able to see the cup of the bra. MEH! WORTH THE PRICE!"
4.0,Cute although I have yet to wear it out. I've traveled with this product and i'll say its done some bending due to my carelessness yet the product remains in tact!. I am pleased.
4.0,I am in love with this leotard.  It fits very well!
4.0,"Great band, but one of the pins didn't lock onto the watch. Had to use the OEM pin."
4.0,So far the shoes are wonderful but I have yet to try them out in action.
4.0,Like them a lot. Only complaint is that they are still a bit long in the foot and I wear a women's 11.  Makes them a bit baggy right before the toes.
4.0,"Not often do I buy something that hasn't been reviewed but these boots looked really cool. For the price and it was a ""prime purchase"", I just had to try. They are adorable! I put them on as soon as I got them today and the fit great, I bought my actual size 8. The only thing I don't like are the laces. They're very thin and way to long. Easy fix. No arch support either. Again easy fix with some insoles. Overall I'm very happy with them."
4.0,The print on the purse looks nice but the inside of the purse smells like fish
4.0,Cute necklace. It is a very bright gold.  Would have liked a more muted gold. But my daughter likes it.
4.0,It fits perfectly on my medium built body but it has a con: not thick enough like cotton to absorb my sweat.
4.0,"Love this, especially for the price! Easy to just throw on and go - not heavy at all. Love that the lining is a texture that resists wind so stays warm. Only thing is, no pockets."
4.0,My stepfather loved his Christmas present. Great job seller👏🏾 It made my dad happy so I’m happy 😃
4.0,"Overall lots of space for backpacking essentials, lots of pockets make this a great option to stay organized and bring what you'd need. What I would have appreciated that this bag did not have: a hole for the hose part of a bladder bag (not a big deal), better adjustment for arms/chest (the weight and lack of adjustability makes it pretty heavy when fully packed on a backcountry trail-bigger deal)<br />Overall I was glad to have this for the ample space. Really wished the shoulder/chest/waist straps were better but will definitely try it out again for another backpacking trip."
4.0,"Needed another pair of running tights for cooler weather, and these do the job. Not too heavy, and provide enough warmth, but do not get hot. Perfect for what I was looking for, very comfortable."
4.0,"These are good quality shirts, they fit a little looser than other compression shirts, but are still quality shirts. Will definitely recommend them to anyone who are looking for good compression shirts. Shipping was fast and they came well packaged. Definitely a good product."
4.0,Not the best quality but my son loves it. We had to size up.
4.0,"I like the design but looked washed out the black color, and ran tight."
4.0,"Very comfortable band, got the navy blue and the color is exactly what I wanted. The only minus is that the sometimes it catches on my purse or pockets and the band releases pretty easy. Hasn't fallen off yet, but comes unhooked. Worth it for the price though."
4.0,They fit great and are as advertised
4.0,Great for the price.  Just took a long time to get here!
4.0,Very pretty necklace. Looks very nice for everyday wear. Would recommend.
4.0,I've never liked the mirror bright badges. While I was in the military I went as long as I could before I had switch over to the mirror bright stuff. During my service I never had the need for any of the miniature badges. I purchased these for use on my VFW head gear and such. These are as well made as any other service badge or pin and I have no complaint. Unfortunately I find the chrome mirror bright finish to look toy like and cheap even more so on the minis then on the full sized badges. I know this is my opinion and I tend to be somewhat old fashioned. I just think it makes the pin lose a lot of detail.<br /><br />As so as I'm able to find older brushed miniature badges I'll buy them. Just like none polish boots and no-iron uniforms this stuff is for the millennials and they can keep em.
4.0,Great material.  The chest area is made for large muscles pecs!  On someone like me who is fit but not yoked they fit a bit strange.
4.0,Large square sunglasses.  Just the right size to fit over square lenses on your eyeglasses.
4.0,"This mask is pretty fun, and is great for scaring family members and any pets you have. Construction seems good, the rubber doesn't feel like it would tear easily.<br /><br />A few downsides are the strong rubber smell, the fact that it's difficult to see out of, and the shape is not quite the same as in the images. Note that your hair and face WILL smell like rubber after you take the mask off. This also isn't a mask that you'd be able to wear for say, trick or treating or a costume party- there's a couple of very small holes in the nose and mouth, but those provide very little visibility. Also, the shape is quite different than in the images- the neck is very loose. In the image it appears to &#34;suck in&#34; underneath the cheeks and chin, but the mask just kind of goes straight down from those areas, so you end up looking like a really obese squirrel.<br /><br />But still, if you're just looking for a novelty toy, this is a pretty fun mask!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review."
4.0,Just got it...haven't used it yet so hoping it will work well and hold a good charge.
4.0,"I like the dress overall, I just wish the material wasn't so cheap. You get what u pay for I guess."
4.0,"The boxers fit me well, the fabric is comfortable."
4.0,"The color is vibrant and the fabric is sturdy, but the length is way off for the size. There is a defining seem where the pant leg meets the knee , and the inseem to the knee is just 9 "".  But the waiste size was accurate."
4.0,thin material but fit well. I actually ordered the pink outfit as well. I got a 3t and it fit my daughter somewhat baggy as she wears a 2t.
4.0,President for grandson
4.0,I would give this dress 5/5 but I'm a stickler for details. This dress is a knock off and DOES NOT SCRUNCH IN THE BACK AS PICTURED. HOWEVER! It is verrryyy cute. I'm 132-136 lbs with curvy but muscular build. I bought a medium and it fits like a small. I love it!!!
4.0,"Lighter blue than I expected, but love the solid colors and bouffant look (not a pattern person)... protects patients, and keeps hair clean and free from breaks of elastic hair ties/bands."
4.0,"If you have small wrists, this watch fits well. It's very cute and feminine."
4.0,"they are good, but i ordered 2 sizes smaller than I wear and it was still too large."
4.0,My dad had on them very comfortable!
4.0,"It's cute. Everything about it is fine. No zippers broke and leather is great. It says it's water proof but I was walking in the rain and my stuff inside got wet, other than that I like it"
4.0,"The problem about buying things online is that you don't quite know how well they fit. These fit fairly good, but I usually have to adjust them a once or twice so that they are not sitting on just one side of my nose. They would fit small and medium sized rectangular wire-frame glasses. I do not think they would fit over 'hipster' glasses. These look much better then the giant oval glasses that I was using before. And it is hard to beat the price. My only caveat is that I do not wear them on high wind days (I live in the desert) because they do not protect well enough against the sand. Therefore this is my 'car' and 'work' pair while I take the big oval ones with me on my hikes or while cycling."
4.0,"This is my new go to black purse. It's a good size and will fit your wallet, phone, and keys with no problem. It's adorable and it's a great price for a quality bag. My only complaint is that the gold on the moon started to peel after a few weeks. But it's not that noticeable."
4.0,"It works pretty well and the watch part is great, but it doesn't look durable and there was no extra battery"
4.0,Wore this for a church function and it was so cute
4.0,"Lovely, but huuuuuge."
4.0,Good product. Made well.
4.0,"I live in these pants, this is my third pair. The first two pairs I got in early 2019. I'm still wearing them! This pair is good but not as soft or thick as they were in past."
4.0,"I love bamboo socks, and have spoiled myself so I can't wear anything else.  The material on these is a bit thin, hence the 4 instead of 5 -- I'm going to end up wearing holes in them pretty soon.  But I wear them pretty much every day and am sad when I haven't done laundry and have to wear something else.  Would love it if they added reinforcements to heel and toe for extra longevity.  Definitely worth the price, though."
4.0,Don't plan on being able to wrap this robe around you or close it; which I didn't anticipate doing; which makes the 'belt' mostly useless and it easily falls out of the loops with little movement.  Fits well in shoulders and the length is great.  The material is much more sheer/silky than I anticipated but feels great against the skin.
4.0,Love them but they're starting to lose their color.
4.0,"smell like chemical when opened, but goes away in about a day  after opening package."
4.0,The ring itself is exactly as described. It just was too long for my nose.
4.0,"The bracelet is very beautiful & the box is too good. It looks very expensive but, it is light on your pocket. I have purchased multiple  of these as gifts. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 star is because the clasp is not easy to open & the size of the bracelet is small much fit for teenagers or kids."
4.0,Nice item. Didnt get the tassel for the key though.
4.0,"Works fine, noticeable relief from long hours standing"
4.0,No magnets on the legs so getting the bab’s legs and hips into it is a little bit of a process if the baby is squirming. I like the fabric. It’s nice and warm.
4.0,"Haven’t worn them for a long period of time yet, but tried them on when they arrived. To start off I had absolutely no intention of ordering the size I got. I typically wear a S or M in leggings depending on the fit. Well somehow I managed to order a Large in these. To my surprise they fit just right. I would’ve never thought that the large would fit and they did. Thought it was kind of weird but have no complaints otherwise"
4.0,"Surprisingly this pajama set actually fit me!  I'm tall - 5'9"", 144 pounds and the pants length was just right.  The legs were wider than I would prefer but still very comfortable.  The material is super soft and light enough to wear in the house this summer.  The top is a camisole top and the straps can be adjusted.  The drawstring is really a belt made out of the same material that goes through a couple of belt loops and can be used to tighten the pants around the waist.  I will definitely be taking this PJ set with me on vacation this summer.  It's really soft and very comfortable."
4.0,Hilarious misprint. Super warm and soft.
4.0,"Runs a bit smaller than the other Twotwowin shirts that I have purchased, but still very nice."
4.0,Perfect size and absolutely love the color!
4.0,"I bought this for my nephew as a birthday present.  It arrived quicker than I thought which was awesome.  I read other reviews about the sizes running small so I ordered one size up, XL/US LRG, and it fit like a women's medium.  I say this because I had my 14 yr old daughter try it on. Also, the pocket was torn a bit on one side.  Graphics look good. I increased my initial rating from 2 stars to 4 because the response and action from the seller that I received was friendly and so quick and painless with positive results :)"
4.0,"A little big, but other than that.....there good!"
4.0,"I LOVE KUT jeans. They fit my body well, have just enough stretch, and I like the range of styles and colors. I love the color of these jeans — much more rosy-pink than in the photo — but they are much looser in the leg on me than on the model."
4.0,"It's not the softest athletic item I've ever gotten, as much as I wish everything was as soft as Champion/Nike/Adidas. I did order a size up because I wanted it to be roomy and I'm glad it did. Since it's mostly poly with low spandex/viscose, it's got some stretch but not THAT stretchy like some athletic items can be. The material is on thin side, I imagine the lighter-colors would make it obvious what you're wearing underneath.<br />For reference, I'm 5'7"", about 170lbs, with an average build, and a large would have fit fine but the XL has a little more room for movement and that was the idea. If in doubt, just a size up would be fine.<br />Minus a star because it's a little scratchy at the seams before washing and not the highest quality fabric in the world."
4.0,Good Christmas gift - no complaints thus far.
4.0,"I've had a similar bag previously that broke, so I decided to try this one because I loved my old purse.  I wish I could have my other one back, as I don't like this one quite as much, but it's still a good purse.  It's a bit heavier than my old purse, and there are a lot more zippers so I feel like I spend a lot more time digging around trying to find things.  Overall the quality is great and it's still a really good purse that I'll use for a long time.  I also am not one to switch out purses."
4.0,Great for slipping into.  Very comfortable.
4.0,These vests are the hype right now and this one fit my expectations. I honestly underestimated how amazing this would come out and it was super cute! I got so many compliments on it and so many people asked where I got it from! They were shocked to know it was from amazon. Definitely worth the money!!
4.0,"My 2.5 year old daughter goes through a lot of sunglasses and so far these seem more flexible so I'm hoping they outlive her previous pairs. The tint is nice and dark, which is good for my light sensitive child, but the ear pieces are just a tad too long for her."
4.0,"Love the color! Looks great! 4 stars only because its kind of hard to take off. Not as easy as taking the original off, but I still like it."
4.0,When they say fits small - they are not kidding...the 2xl that I ordered are now being worn by my step son with a 26in waist...but he loves them!
4.0,"Beautiful, comfortable.  The face is easily readable.  For the cost, I am well pleased!"
4.0,"Cute shirt....but it runs small. I'm a true blue size 18 and this shirt fits like a size 16. It's cute but remember the fabric is NOT very forgiving. I'll be returning because the sizing is off, but the top is still very pretty."
4.0,Love the blend of colors. Downfall is the strap keeps running away from the loop that is supposed to keep it in place.
4.0,"Warm and durable, they have quickly become my daughter's favorite."
4.0,"After I buffed off the cheap finish and oiled them ( a LOT), they are pretty comfortable and do a better job at holding up my tool belt than my flat butt."
4.0,Kind of weird one of these tanks shrunk badly after one wash while the others did not.
4.0,"I am a huge fan of wrap rings and this one is my favorite!  It isn't too heavy given the amount of crystals on it and I like the green crystals for the eyes. I was a bit nervous it would look cheap but was pleasantly surprised after receiving it to find that it actually does look like something you would get in a jewelry store. The rose gold has a nice warm tone and doesn't look brassy at all.<br /><br />I did have two small complaints. First, I lost a crystal right off the top of the ring shortly after I got it. Second, the rose gold platoon is wearing off a little on the inside of he band. I do wear the ring everyday so it could simply be the heavy use it is subjected to. I think it would be handy if the seller provided a few spare stones withy the purchase for the sake of replacing any that go missing.<br /><br />I received a discounted sample of the product for my unbiased and honest review."
4.0,This celtic cross is a great cross i love it wear it all the time have had it for about a month but there just one thing i really dont like and i think some people over shot this little fact that the cross while being cheap it made from some cheap material it bends and sometimes when im working or moving alot the cross will bend and im scared to bnd it back feels a little clumsy but you just have to be careful with it like the other guy said its a real nice cross dont get me wrong just wish it was more durable than this
4.0,"This has to be one of my favorite go to rings.  Really cute and dainty.  It is a little delicate so you do have to be careful it doesn't get snagged.  I accidently bumped it by the door, and the ring got a little out of shape.  It was an easy fix tho, and i was able to fix it like how it was before but I'm def more careful with it now.  For the price point, I don't mind it, and it hasn't turned my finger green and I have washed my hands a couple of times with the ring on.  Hopefully the color stays true since it's silver."
4.0,"Definitely gives an elegant look, but it does get small scratches here and there."
4.0,They look nice. The back has quite a bit of wiring.
4.0,"was missing a gem, but thats fine"
4.0,A little short on some of the lengths but over all loved it
4.0,"I like it, though I wish the material came in different options"
4.0,"These shorts are great for bike riding, though it stops there. In that sense they are perfect single-use shorts. They fit as expected, they are comfortable (for the most part). However, if you're not riding a bike, they aren't comfortable to just have on. The gel seat is a great idea. Its brilliant, and it works well to give comfort while riding. However, if you're just wearing them, sitting, its very uncomfortable, much in the way a general bike seat is.<br /><br />If you want them for riding, they're great. If you want them in general for athletic compression, look elsewhere. These won't be comfortable. They are priced well for what they are, and they're made well, also."
4.0,The material of the dress is extremely soft. It’s a bit thinner than I had hoped but will work great for thanksgiving. Only thing that would make this dress better is pockets.
4.0,It is very good quality but the lengths of the two chains is really different.  I know they're supposed to be like that but it's so different I don't wear the short one because its too short.  The A one is cute and good quality and it hasn't tarnished yet.
4.0,Lovely classy dress.  Fit well
4.0,I like my charm. I got a different necklace so that it looks better. It is serving its purpose very well.
4.0,"Really, really cute!  Warm, too!  Only complaint is they are getting lots of little fuzzballs on them.  :(!  Oh, well,  they sure are cute!"
4.0,"Very thin material and it sits very awkwardly on my shoulders, but I love it. It is one of my favorite light wait sweaters for over tank tops."
4.0,"The dress was for a church banquet, it’s very beautiful the only thing is the front was a bit long for me."
4.0,Nice fit...stretches and flatters.  But the sheen goes away after one cool wash.Stains easy. Other than that I like it
4.0,They are pricey but soft and good quality.  Have not come apart at the seams from washing like some cheaper ones have
4.0,"OK quality, strap is a bit thin and Buckle could be better quality."
4.0,"Seemed durable enough, but the fabric was stiff and scratchy and not comfortable"
4.0,I have a tall skinny kiddo so these are way too big for him. Even with the cinchable waist they were just huge.But the quality seems good I'm sure they work for other kids.
4.0,"I needed a bag with a long handle, big enough for my Kindle 7 that has a case. The main pocket is plenty big for that and should fit a standard 16 oz soda or water as well. I would say it would be big enough for the Kindle 8 in a case, but not anything bigger than that. Lots of other smaller pockets for everything else. The colors are darker than the photo looks like, for instance the palest of the flowers look like a cream color in the photo but is more the dark tan color of kraft paper or a paper bag. I think I will like the more muted colors for myself, but I did take away a star because I thought there was more of a difference than a variation in monitors should explain."
4.0,"Had to buy a watch band . The band was broken  . I tried putting to back together, didnt work. Took it to a jeweler,he fixed it but said he didnt no how long it would last. Because I liked the watch so much I felt it was worth it to me to replace the band."
4.0,"Definitely a nice pair of leggings, however these snag and peel easily. Love the way they feel and fit, just hate the peeling, especially when I haven’t worn them for that long."
4.0,"Ordered this bag for my husband. He uses it to carry his lunch, his Nintendo Switch, keys, knives, etc for work. It seems a lot smaller than the picture looks, but it ended up being perfect.<br /><br />The straps are kind of short, they just fit over my husbands shoulders. They are also not sewn in, I need to finish the ends for him. Not being sewn causes them to just slide right out, he put safety pins on them to keep them from sliding out until I sew them.<br /><br />The zippers and seams seem strong and durable. It feels like it will last a long time. For the price I feel that this was a good buy."
4.0,I really like this shirt but it's smaller than I thought it would be. I ordered a Large but I am usually a size small on shirts and it still was snug and not quite long enough. I still wear it around the house but I wish it were a tad longer.
4.0,The necklace is beautiful the only thing I didn't realize is that it doesn't come with any pads to put the oils on.
4.0,Packaging was really worn out when it arrived
4.0,"I ordered the shirt in a size bigger (L) than I would usually wear (M). It was roomy, but not too big.  I wore it with a pair of jeans and some cute boots to complete the outfit. There were a lot of loose strings, so I'm hoping it will stand up to numerous washings and not fall apart after a couple of wears.  It was warm enough without being too hot on a cold fall day. I loved the hood and pockets. Overall, very pleased."
4.0,"Did not wear it yet, nice material, below knee, desine great. Good for the price."
4.0,fits nicely goes great with my dance & rave outfits
4.0,Nice jumpsuit fits nice loose the holes in the back of the knee unnecessary
4.0,This little guy showed up on time and intact! I don’t know how durable he will be in my motorcycle keychain
4.0,GOT IT FOR MY LITTLE SIS. SHE LOVED IT
4.0,gave this as a gift and my friend had to play with it so water did not leak in and she did and likes them
4.0,"It has a really weathered look that you can't see too well on the images. Makes it look really dirty, but thats my own fault I guess for not checking properly before purchase."
4.0,Had a strong odor when I got it so I had to give a wash and I would definitely say size down I’m usually a large but a medium fit perfectly
4.0,"Very beautiful dress. It's well made and the material is great quality. However, the dimensions are off, despite the fact that the sizing guide was reviewed before purchasing this dress."
4.0,Cute and casual but feels more like a nightgown than a dress. Not thick enough material.
4.0,"I purchase these for upcoming 1920 party. I tried them on, they fit well."
4.0,"Just a nice, cheap maxi dress. The length was good for me. Maybe would have sized up."
4.0,Fits as expected. Works for what I needed it for.
4.0,Some are smaller than others
4.0,"Very lightweight cardigan. I purchased a medium and that is normal for me but I could see how this could possible be on the smaller side. I am more of a petite person so I usually drown in standard clothing and this was a normal fit for me. But I would consider this a summer cardigan. It’s very breathable and would not keep you warm. As in dictated in the photo, the model is wearing it with shorts to give you an idea. 😉<br /><br />But this could also be a great addition to your layering routine if you need allll that. Lol"
4.0,"I am nearsighted. Recently I lost my glasses that have transitions lenses. My back up pair does not have those lenses so I thought this product would help bridge the gap. Essentially they are are a pair of frames with clear (non-prescription lenses) and clip tinted sunglass lenses. I found the sunglass portion acceptable and actually quite helpful when driving. I wore them over my regular prescription glasses and they were fine. They are supposedly designed for nearsighted people but on their own, they really made no difference whatsoever.  Still, they served the purpose in my time of need."
4.0,Beautiful.  A little big for her
4.0,"Coin section zipper opens up by itself, so it’s broken. I didn’t get to put any change into"
4.0,Release your hippie-chick!
4.0,The color and pattern are nice. It's soft and silky feeling but I should have sized down. It still fits fine but I feel that it could be a little more form fitting. I wish that either I could tie it a bit higher or the ends weren't as long they tend to get in the way. Overall for the price it's a cute top.
4.0,"They are darker in person and you might<br />Get swamp nether regions if you wore them<br />70 F while humid out . Other than that I like<br />Em.<br /><br />* update as of April 17,2019 the button came<br />Off after 2 washings."
4.0,"Such a cute and comfortable outfit for preschool!  The shirt images are bright and fun to look at, and the pants are very soft and the waistband is not too tight.  The shirt runs a little small, but the pants run true to size!"
4.0,great sunglasses would recommend
4.0,It's really nice I like it a lot
4.0,Well made. Color was a little off. I thought it would be gray but its shades of blues
4.0,The only complaint is that it’s quite short and I have a longer torso. Other than that it’s a nice quality and soft.
4.0,Fits a little on the snug side. Just have to break it in though. Solid hat
4.0,I bought this sweatshirt as a gift for my friend and she absolutely loves it and wears it all over!  It's a nice medium weight hoodie that is perfect for cool days.
4.0,"Love the way this hat looks and fits, but DARN the 2 inch leatherette tag that is securely sewn in . I thought it would be an easy thing to snip it out but...not so simple  without leaving holes. :("
4.0,"It’s smaller than expected, but it still looks great!"
4.0,"Glasses are great for night driving, removes glare.  Just wish they were about 1/4 inch wider to fit over my regular eye glasses. Tight fit."
4.0,"Overall I am pretty happy with the purchase, it meets my need of being very lightweight and rain resistant. The only minor issue I can state is there were a lot of strings hanging off the seams,<br />I just took a pair of scissors to it."
4.0,Very pretty and not too hard to put in.  Does have a tendency to slip occasionally but all around an attractive accessory.
4.0,Love it looks great and I wear it comfortably
4.0,"I love this shirt - A LOT! The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because although it fits great, is thick and comfy, it also has started piling after only 1 wash. I hope that I can get the little balls off, but I am a little disappointed that it's an issue after only wearing it a couple of times."
4.0,"Likes the way it feels on my skin, order small, will be ordering again but in ex-small"
4.0,"I'm 5'5&quot;, about 115 pounds, and I ordered a medium. It fit perfectly and looks really cute. I haven't had any problems with the button in the back so far. The under - shirt comes about an inch or less above my waist but the lace part covers the rest. However, the shirt is a bit see through - but that is expected with a white lace top. I recommend finding a tank top to go underneath if you buy the white shirt."
4.0,Soooooo cute! As described and pictured. Cheap material for the slacks but still very cute.....
4.0,"I went to halloween party as a jackolantern and wore this on my head as the pumpkin lid.<br />Its very comfortable ..not tight at all.  The band fits an adult head and would also fit a child.  The  topper is rather small and probably would look best on child, but it works ok for adult."
4.0,"Tired of tightness, these stretch where you need them too. I occasionally work on roofs and that seemed to do the damage as shown."
4.0,I haven’t washed it yet so it might shrink! I’m 5’8” and usually wear a large because of broad shoulders and long torso… this is a large.
4.0,Very nice except I had to cut the elastic because it was too tight
4.0,Cute but i had to sew the back the seams were ripping apart
4.0,"The threading made my ear bleed putting it in (5 months healed but i have a habit of knocking it around), but it did its job and was nearly invisible in my ear."
4.0,I'm 5'10&#34; and this is long! I usually wear XL in sweaters to give some room for shirts and this one is pretty roomy! Sleeves are long which is good. I like it and I would suggest going a size smaller when ordering.
4.0,"Bought to wear for belly dancing, and they work great by providing just the right balance of &#34;grip vs slip.&#34; They were a little snug at first, especially around my bunions (boo), but they loosened up a little over time as I broke them in. I wear a size 9.5 generally, and I purchased a large."
4.0,"I loved this dress. Nice weight of fabric and super well made!  But the size small is  a little snug. I'm 125 lbs, 5'4. Wear size 4-6. Still zips and I could wear it, but not to corporate office.  Here's the deal.  If you're my size and want to look sexy, go for the small!  It shows all curves. If you want it for work to look business-like, get a medium. I'm returning and ordering a medium because I like it so much. Gave 4 stars only because size chart is slightly wrong. Otherwise it's a 5."
4.0,"I bought this specifically to take along as I hiked the Camino de Santiago in northern Spain. Although it added weight to my pack, it performed well on the three days I had to use it. The length kept me dry to about mid-calf on my 5'6"" frame. It's generously cut so that I could carry a day pack underneath without losing any significant coverage, as well as wear warm layers for the 45-degree temperatures. The drawstring on the hood helped keep it in place in winds that were high enough to make me stagger. The sleeves were long enough so that I could pull my gloved hands back inside and grip my hiking poles through the plastic. With snaps on the sleeves, the jacket, and the pockets, no rain was able to get in. The one drawback is that this jacket doesn't breathe, so any sweat wasn't able to evaporate. Having anticipated this, I had worn layers that stayed warm even when damp.<br />Overall, this inexpensive jacket did what I needed it to do in some pretty miserable conditions. I don't think it was the best choice for a 500-mile hike because of the weight and bulk, but I was grateful to have it. I plan to keep in it in my travel trailer from now on. It will fit just about anyone, and it will be useful for those unavoidable trips outside on rainy days."
4.0,"I like this shirt and the fit, the fabric is linen like and a little heavy which is nice, however a little wrinkly which makes it look a little casual."
4.0,I didn’t like the fact the sleeves didn’t stretch at all. I couldn’t really move my arms but overall I loved how I looked.
4.0,"One of the handles was bent when I received them.  When I tried to bend it straight, the handle broke off.  I had my friend reconnect it and it's fine now."
4.0,Although socks fit well after just 2 washes with Woolite on cold the material started to get little &#34;pills&#34; of lint build up on them.
4.0,"The cut off the skirt is longer in the front than in the back, which makes it a bit awkward. But it's comfortable and has survived through two washes and a waterpark so far."
4.0,The quality of the material is good. The sleeves were a little short but can easily be pushed up. You will need to wear a camisole under it but it's super cute. It fits true to size.
4.0,Loved the shirt but it had a defect in the material that showed as a small light pick on the front
4.0,"On my foot, which is an 8.5, the 9 was too big and the 8 fit well -- just snug enough to stay on my foot. These turn out to be particularly good for the beach. For some reason sand doesn't seem to stick to them as much as other sandals, and they don't have crevices into which sand can wedge. Very lightweight, comfortable."
4.0,Nice shorts and good price. Order 1 size smaller
4.0,Bought these from Costco for $30 in summer 2016. They are a great pair of sunglasses. However exterior finish on the frame is starting to degrade after 2 years
4.0,A little too short... but all around a nice shirt
4.0,"Purchased this for my grandson and he loved it,  Cavs or Lakers fans will love this necklace"
4.0,Exactly like pictured. Lots of compliments
4.0,The quality is good and I have always bought X-Large in case of shrinkage.  I sometimes wonder if Large would have been more appropriate.
4.0,Fit as expected. The only thing I didn't like about them is I thought they were going to be a little more rubberized. For some reason only 1 pair had the rubbery texture. SUPER fast shipping.They are just a tad less neon than it shows in the picture but they are great if you're looking for a cheap pair of sunglasses that you don't have to worry about breaking or losing.
4.0,Really pretty bracelet! It was a Mother's Day gift for my mom and she loved it!
4.0,"they look smaller online, they arent toooooo much bigger in real life but yea! they r cute! can be a bit heavy, but my ears are kinda weak."
4.0,Nifty little elk antler.
4.0,"Looks the same as the pictures if you follow the reviews for sizing. I usually wear a medium in t-shirts, small in loose shirts like this. But I ordered an extra small and its still pretty loose. Also must be ironed because it gets wrinkly pretty easily. Lace is really pretty though."
4.0,It was a little short.
4.0,"Cute but order a size of two up. Thin material so you will need a cami under it. Also careful if you are a little larger with the ladies, might not button all the way."
4.0,Lightweight and pretty. Perfect for dancing costume
4.0,There was no cotton crotch.  But they fit very well.
4.0,I got a medium and it fit well. If I bought another I would go a size up in hopes it'll be longer. It's shorter then picture if you get the navy. My friends black was perfect length and she got an XL. We're both 5'4&#34;. The length isn't ridiculously short but I would have preferred it to fit like the photo. Overall still a fun dress with pockets!
4.0,"This is a nice looking, and very comfortable shirt. Lost a star only because the material is quite thin. Bought it for a vacation, it's been washed about 4 times, and seems to be holding up well, time will tell. I normally wear XL but got this in 2XL, and it's is just a tad loose, but is good to have a little extra room."
4.0,I love the design of these earrings but I have to admit the weight is on the heavier side.
4.0,"I don't really know what to think of this dress. It's beautiful. Somewhat too big on me. I ordered the size small based on my measurements, 36  30  35/36  @135 lbs and 5'5.&#34; But I can still make it work. It's just not my style. I thought it was. It's not! But will be keeping it."
4.0,I hate the material.
4.0,"they are basic tank tops. the brown is more grey/beige than brown. they're a tiny bit see through but i have a larger chest so that could be why. otherwise, i have no issues!! i wear them basically every day."
4.0,"This shirt is amazing!! it fits just right!! i ordered an XL although i usually wear a large, just because a lot of times online stuff runs small. it fits great though so no complaints there! Very on trend style and i can't wait to wear year round! the only thing i would have to say is the fabric is fairly stiff and wrinkles easily. i iron or steam mine though and it comes out easily! Overall, i am pleased with my purchase!!"
4.0,When you buy on line you can not see detail in the material . When this arrived and ir arrived very fast . The seams had loose threads that needed trimming. In a store you would just put this one back and look for a better one . I just trimmed the threads and it looked fine . That is why I gave it a 4 instead of 5 I shouldn’t have to trim the threads the seamstress  of  done it as she was going along .
4.0,Comfy and stretchable
4.0,"These pants are okay for pajama pants or lounging or doing yoga at home. The material is very comfortable. They are fairly low rise. They are tight through the hips and thighs and then flare out at the bottom. The XXL fits like a plus size 1X, not a 2X, and they are longer than I expected (I'm 5 ft. 4 in.). I'm not excited about the instructions to hand wash them, but I will make the best of it."
4.0,Super cute and comfortable. Great to wear with winter boots
4.0,I love the color. These are really cute and stand out.
4.0,A little cheap and the night light doesn't even function the way it should!
4.0,These pants are great for cosplay
4.0,Would have preferred a thicker material.
4.0,I love these for summer and spring. They are lightweight and breathable but not too thin. I ordered the mint color and was worried they may be too thin and show underwear through them. I will definitely order again in various colors.
4.0,"Liked this - looked really nice on.  Didn't wear it for very long though, so I can't say how it would do for an entire event.  But it was fun.  Nice style."
4.0,Unique and stylish at a low cost.
4.0,It was very long so I have to sew the hem. I used this for a Christmas party and I got a lot of compliments. The fit is good and it looks very pretty.
4.0,it is very pretty
4.0,Looks good on pic but style is  not as expected
4.0,"In the photo, it looked like a black background. It is actually blue."
4.0,They work well.  I love the butterflies and the different colors.
4.0,Thinner than what i was looking for. But the fuzz is comfortable. Sizing is good I ordered up just to have more room since they are house slippers.
4.0,"It looked long and tight, but once you pull it on, fits comfortably and the length is perfect. I'm glad I bought the x-large, as I've gained a lot of extra weight in the past year due to health issues. Hopefully, now that I'm doing better, I can &#34;comfortably&#34; begin a more strenuous fitness regimen!"
4.0,Cute but not a high quality material
4.0,Lovely-smaller than I was expecting-my fault for not checkig the specs more carefully but very pretty!
4.0,"Super cute, a little narrow in the diaper area. A lot of diaper was left exposed, other than that it's perfect and adorable!"
4.0,Loved it got many compliments on it but the clasp broke on me it made me sad.
4.0,"After just  a few, 2 or 3, washings the material started to fade. I use Tide Coldwater detergent and OxiClean colored clothes bleach. Sad because I really fell in love with the material pattern and it feels nice against my skin too."
4.0,"pretty good, squat proof, but no pocket and pretty bad cameltoe"
4.0,Fits well. I'm excited to wear it.
4.0,"I wear these, but was hoping I could pull them onto my glasses as it said they flip up, but they do not come off to fit onto regular glasses."
4.0,"Excellent quality. However, the link between the chain and the clasp should be enhanced for the better function."
4.0,Helps you keep up with your pet especially on night walks. The battery life could be better. I have a black and tan Chihuahua that’s hard to keep track of without this light.
4.0,A little bigger than I expected! Good lens though!
4.0,Back side is too short.
4.0,At first without trying it on it didn’t look very nice when I tried it on it fit really nice and elegant
4.0,I usually buy size 12/14 and  a L  was skin tight on the top part.  Going to return. Other than that is adorable. Ordered an XL hoping it'll fit. Fingers crossed.
4.0,The dress is very soft and comfortable. Quality is good and the deep blue is very beautiful! I didn’t keep the dress however because I didn’t find it flattering on me. I am 5ft 4in and weight 145lbs. It just didn’t suit my body type. Made me look very wide.
4.0,Nice for the office.
4.0,"really like the feel and fit .. great shirt , ordered more"
4.0,I did not like the style
4.0,"It took a very long time to arrive but consider the price on this hat and I guess that is the trade off.<br /><br />I love the way it looks but removed a star because I did not really want a distressed hat and had no idea this particular style with bling was going to arrive with distressing on the brim( worn away/missing fabric in spots meant to look aged/used/distressed).<br /><br />It was unclear- at least to me- that this particular hat came with this effect from reading the description.<br /><br />While the hat is gorgeously blingy- the distressed part does not fit in with the hat and brim being loaded with bling.<br /><br />As in, the effect seems out of place on such a blinged out hat.<br /><br />I still think it is a great hat, I just would have preferred to NOT have the distress marks added in."
4.0,Fit perfect...loving it
4.0,I bought these for my grandson. They are easy to put on and they stay on while he’s crawling everywhere!
4.0,"The size is almost as shown in the chart.<br />However, the bra part is small without cups, so it is not suitable for people with big breasts."
4.0,"They are beautiful and well made, but thinner than I expected."
4.0,Very poor belt design. The G clip broke in half. Otherwise excellent pair of pants.
4.0,"My husband really liked the color (green) and for the most part the fit. He is a 6'3"" guy with a long arm/torso length, so the sleeves and shirt itself were a bit short. However, he typically rolls the sleeve anyway and the length was decent enough to not look like a slob not being able to tuck it in, ha! It also did not shrink after a wash/dry!"
4.0,I have very large calf's and it can be hard to tighten these because of that. I cant close part of the boot all the way on the top between the 1st and 2nd strap. it still gives great ankle support though.
4.0,"My baby love them. They are cute but they are too exact she won't have room to grow. But it's okay. If she loves, it i love it too."
4.0,"Very nice purse that can be a clutch or over the shoulder.<br />Perfect for the special evening out, wedding/prom accessories or just to add a little dazzle to an outfit.<br />One drawback is that it barely holds a cell phone which means you have to figure out just what you want/need to put in, otherwise it would have earned five stars."
4.0,"Not a bad looking watch for every day use. Keeps good time. Cant go wrong with its price. I bought it because of the price which makes it disposable if it breaks down. I wear my better watches for family dinners, going to shows, parties, etc."
4.0,"Yeah, It didn't come like it said. It came with one rubber O Ring. And the eyes come diamond not black. So I don't know what happened. It still cute. Wish they got the eyes right. I'm going to keep it."
4.0,"Keeps mask off face, improved breathing and help with voice. I don’t sound muffel"
4.0,Beautiful ring. Many compliments as it caught the eyes of those I conversed with who curiously asked to see it once they noticed it.
4.0,Real warm boot but best to order a size up of ur normal shoe size for best fit.
4.0,"I got these sunglasses and i love them!!!!! They are my favorites out of all of my sunglasses! But one of the side band things bent out of shape or something, and now i can't wear them anymore. Be careful where you wear these too, cause they could break but other than that i recommend"
4.0,"A little tight, but works."
4.0,"**Update** I did receive a new pair of shoes both left and right. They came 4 days later but fit wonderfully. I changed it to a 4 star as the return process for an exchange was very simple. **<br /><br />Buyer beware. I only received two left shoes. I was holding my breath for them to get here with excitement. Then as the picture shows. Two left shoes. It is an amazing left shoe. Total comfort. One I tried to share with my right foot.<br /><br />I am returning the shoes with a replacement SET on the way. If they do not send me a left and a right shoe, I will have to hunt for another shoe style. Yet, folks, the shoe is everything they market it to be.  It feels perfect. Which is the only reason I ordered from them again.<br /><br />I will update with what happens next. Meanwhile, do not hesitate to purchase a pair. They are true to the size of my left foot. :)"
4.0,Bought for my grandson. His dad wears ralph lauren shirts. :)
4.0,"I ordered this in small. I’m 5’ 105lbs. It fit, but i it was a little long and bigger than I wanted. Took it to my seamstress and she did a little bit of work. Now it’s a favorite. Just wish y’all carried CS"
4.0,The colors are vibrant and very pretty.
4.0,This dress is so cute! It's perfect and loose but I had to send back because the arms and bust is runs tight. I'm 5'7. Usually wear 18-20. I can wear 2x but unfortunately there was not enough room for movement up top.
4.0,"I ordered extra small, it seems to fit, but not as I would have wanted. The bottom fits alright, but the top is a little lose. I guess, my bust is not big enough for the top, but oh well, i still wear it for my wake board, it doesn't seem to bother me,because the life vest keep it in place, but my only complain is the padding that comes with it, it is too thin."
4.0,Work great. Occasionally the rubber bits come off.
4.0,"I love the look and feel of these earrings. They’re absolutely beautiful. They’re some light material like thin plastic or aluminum, so they’re not heavy at all. They come packaged with many earring backs to keep them securely on your ear, depending on the size of your piercing. I have larger holes and can wear small plugs. This means I need an earring back that won’t go through the hole and there were some included.<br /><br />The only reason I took one star is because one of the sequins fell off the first time I wore them. Luckily, I’m slightly crafty and had a hit glue gun but those can be messy and some glue got on the face of the sequin next to the one I was putting back. They’re still very pretty but I am afraid they’ll come apart again because I have long curly hair that behaves like Velcro sometimes. It draws things into it very easily. I did notice the dangling threads getting messy from my hair a few times. I needed to fix the threads a few times but this isn’t the earring’s fault. I just wasn’t happy that a sequin came off so easily. It really was quite easily and the reason was because it hadn’t been secured at the end of the run. It appeared to be dangling a bit from the earring to begin with before I ever wore it, but I thought it maybe been meant to be that way. I didn’t want to mess with glue & securing it when it was brand new. I’ve always found it difficult to glue sequins. It’s so easy to get glue on the face of the others surrounding the one you’re affixing...<br /><br />All that aside, they’re gorgeous and match a top I wear perfectly. Would I buy more? Or buy these again? Yes. I’d take that chance again. They’re that pretty."
4.0,"These pants are soft, comfortable for kids. They are good for spring and autumn, not thick enough for winter at all."
4.0,Runs small so go a size up
4.0,"The quality of the skirt is very good for the price. It looks to be made well and was exactly as pictured. However, I would recommend to order 1 or even 2 sizes up if you have ample hips like I do. I wear and xl and ordered that size, but it's about an inch or two too narrow. Overall I recommend this product."
4.0,Very warm gloves but long in the fingers. I think a small would have been tight but may have fit the fingers better. Will keep my hands warm this winter.
4.0,comfortable flip flops
4.0,"As a pair of sunglasses, the sunglasses are excellent. Nevertheless, when I was in Florida and using them daily, one of the arms broke off. The only consolation is that the sunglasses are inexpensive and easily replaced."
4.0,Very Cute the color was a bit bright from the picture. It was a gift for a little girl who has trouble with car sickness. I gave her peppermint essential oils to use with the necklace. I got a very sweet card as she really liked the necklace.
4.0,I re
4.0,"I really like these sunglasses. I have a wider head and often get headaches when wearing stuff on my brow and temples but these glasses are great and feel great. A little problem that I found that wasn’t huge but still a bit disappointing was that the nose piece isn’t adjustable as I was lead to believe. Still they rest on my nose well enough and don’t slide at all.<br />The frames and arms feel sturdy and not cheap. I still get some sun glare from the sides of my eyes but not a problem for me. I do find myself cleaning them quite a bit because fingerprints tend to show up on the darker lenses.<br />Overall I’d highly recommend these to anyone who’s looking for a stylish, functional, sturdy, and inexpensive pair of sunglasses."
4.0,I got this to go along with the two butterfly plaques for the wall. It is very pretty...and fits well with them.
4.0,Love it. Some are very small but they work or fit. None of them are the same color. No 2 pair match.
4.0,Really loving the dress I ordered. It fits very well and is extremely comfortable.
4.0,"These panties are a heavier material than I expected but they fit really well and are very soft.  I love the vibrant colors, so sexy and fun to wear.  These panties have a nice wide crotch area which is good for guys like me that like to wear panties."
4.0,"I ordered this fully expecting it to be too small - I got an x-large and was hope maybe, just maybe it'd fit. Something about Asian sizing or something but I gave it to my little sister."
4.0,The only reason I’m giving it a 4 star is because I’m not sure how it will wash yet. It’s very cute and looks great with leggings!
4.0,"It isn't the heaviest, highest quality piece of jewelry. I expected that. My wife bought me one from a jeweler in the mall years back that is far superior...and 8 or 10 times more expensive. I wanted another one to mix it up. It is what I was hoping for. Clasp isn't that strong as I expected but I don't put it threw it's paces. If you take care of your things they last longer. Could pretty easily solve a future broken clasp problem...or buy another with change I find in my car. Good purchase."
4.0,"Had a weird smell, I don’t know what it is; but I like it’s large and everything fits perfectly"
4.0,Only set back with this dress is the fabric. Good otherwise. The colour contrast ie great.
4.0,Shirt looks good & was a hit in public.
4.0,"Shirt looks great on my husband, and he loves it! The shirt is very thin, which is great for hot weather, but the graphic does look like it will peel when I wash/dry it. All in all, nice shirt, wish it were a little better quality. Great buy!"
4.0,Very cheap fabric and fit was very large. But customer service was fabulous.
4.0,Good editing tool - have used Print Master for a very long time - easy to navigate through it
4.0,"Loved these earrings that went with the necklace, butttt they are not make good. Took it out the box and the stone was out of one of the earrings. By the end of the night I had lost that stone it fell out the earring frame again. I know I only paid $5.99 but they could have lasted at least one night."
4.0,I like the dress but the one I received was a little different than the one I ordered. The lining underneath was short and the one in the pic was long. Also the neckline was different than I saw in the pic. Fit as expected. Just fit.  I'm 5'4&#34; 127 lbs ordered small. Any taller or few lbs more go with a med.
4.0,It's a little big but otherwise decent shirt for the money comfortable seems to do what it's said to do
4.0,"The fit is great, they're just a little thinner than I thought they would be!"
4.0,"This is a gorgeous necklace! Beautiful stones, well set and stunning. A real statement necklace!  I have one little issue with the clasp. It's brassy and flimsy. I'll replace it myself with a sturdier version from the craft store."
4.0,"True to size... the knotted side is just a little short. However, it makes a good dress to throw on over a swimsuit."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:c325ddee8b275ff3d174fcdd181a2fc3]] Lightweight.  Doesn't dent in your nose by the weight of the glasses.<br />Clean lines.  Smooth, wrap around design.  And without all that girlie bling or brand names on the stems that I can't seem to avoid these days when buying a cheap pair of glasses.  Thank you for making these basic black.  Simple.  I love that.<br />Stays in place.  Doesn't slide down my nose or shift off ears.<br />Dark, grey tint to the lens.  Effective at reducing glare.  I also like that they physically cover my crows feet so they will not get additional sun exposure.<br /><br />They're a little larger than I typically buy for my small framed face but for most folks, I suspect the size will be perfect.  Because I thrash my sunglasses and don't have any interest in changing my ways, I prefer to buy less expensive sunglasses.  And these TOTALLY get the job done and meet all of my requirements for a good pair of glasses.<br /><br />While I did receive a discount in exchange for my honest review, I do believe these are a good value at full cost and that most folks will be totally happy with the purchase.  Check out the video if you'd like to see how well packaged these are and to see a quick comparison to my typical glasses."
4.0,"Great shirt! I'm 5'4&#34;, 130 lbs and the medium fit well. I have a larger chest and it did pull across the chest a tad, but great with a cami and a second button open! A large would have been too big otherwise. I got the rodeo color, and it is beautiful- word of warning, the &#34;red&#34; is more of a brownish red than a bright red as it appears in the photo. Still love the color combo though!"
4.0,"I was honestly really hesitant about ordering but I'm so glad I did,  it fits Great and it's lightweight so prefect to wear out on a hot summer night and over all I felt so attractive in it."
4.0,I'm changing my review. I didn't pull the bottom of this down for some reason (it was bunched up) and didn't catch on to that the first time I tried it on. I tried it on again a few days ago and it actually looks amazing. It's made of great quality and looks way more expensive than it is. It's actually one of my favorite shirts. Funny how that happened..
4.0,"This watch is very pretty and looks as nice as the picture. I bought it because I like that the watch is thin, however, it's surprisingly heavy. I've had it for about a month with no issues and it keeps time well."
4.0,I love the first series but the second had misspelled wording. I thought it was a page error so I ordered it anyway because I didn’t want all the kids to have the same bracelet. Nope it was wrong on the one that came. Overall I they loved them but I am going to replace the misspelled one
4.0,"The hat is so cute, works great and is well made.  Watch out for the very hard plastic packaging,  The ""pull-apart"" dots on the edges do not separate without a cutting tool.  We ruined a pair of scissors getting it open, and then scraped our hands on the sharp cut edges.  Took a while to get it open."
4.0,"Very good buy!! But next time I would take a small but it fits well, I just like to feel a Lil tightness with my bras. Quality is good and feels comfortable."
4.0,These are so very fun! I had to return because they were too large and they didn't have a smaller size.
4.0,I brought this mask for my 3 year  old and it fits great. He’s 31/2 now and is out growing though
4.0,Seller states size of BOX it comes in. Not size of bag. In reality it is 5x7x1.<br />Love haiku bags but this one is too small.
4.0,Great wallet with plenty of storage. The only complaint is that it is kind of bulkier than I anticipated.
4.0,Comfy fit!
4.0,They are sturdy and a good size for shopping. I really like them
4.0,Great light weight
4.0,"Really pretty top. Unfortunately,  there are pink button markers that are visible. Otherwise this is nice."
4.0,Fully extended it fits what i need. Seems to be good quality but its matalic in color. Not what i was looking for but not worth sending back for.
4.0,"I fell in love with this necklace when I first saw this on amazon.  I was born in South Bend and I am a huge Notre Dame fan.  I was so excited to get this necklace.  I opened the tin it comes in and yes that is cute as they say the ONLY down fall about the necklace is that the chain is very small.  The chain fits a little girl not really a woman unless you’re alright wearing it as a choker, because it is definitely a choker."
4.0,"Deciding whether too keep or exchange. But, it fit,s snug, like the adjacent photo, and is probably better than being somewhat large. I have odd size.<br />The color and style are perfect!"
4.0,"Earrings lovely, inexpensive."
4.0,"The size was much smaller than I expected but it is very neat and has a classic look to it. The material seems quite sturdy too, I really hope it can stand the test of wear and tear. I am considering buying the wine colour."
4.0,A tiny bit snug red bled to white tights with minimal sweat. Just for casual wear and dance practice and exercise. I bought 3.
4.0,"Yeah, big sailor moon fan growing up, so there was no way i wasn't going to buy them"
4.0,Nice product.  As described.  Shoulder strap not firm enough.
4.0,I really like how easy it is to get on and off.<br />Durable.  I run with my watch on. It stays put.<br />I
4.0,"This is the second one I purchased from this seller, because it is a nice minimizer bra and I  was thinking about give the color another try; and again, it is comfy to wear and does well on compression. The only problem is the color does not match with the picture...!"
4.0,It's really cute and comfortable. The fabric is very soft on
4.0,"This is a very cute dress for a great price. I ordered a small (I’m 5’1”) and it was a bit shorter than I expected, but certainly not too short (about 2” above the knee) The material is on the thin side, so be prepared to layer. I bought the leopard print pattern and wear it with black opaque tights. Overall, a good buy. Because the dress is on the sheer side, with some colors/patterns you will probably need to wear a slip underneath."
4.0,"This is going to be a go-to weekend tote here this coming spring. Perfect for my essentials, but room for a book,  few diapers, & snacks so I don't have to lug the diaper bag for quick trips. Also, such a deal!"
4.0,"Cute design and works perfectly! Just hard to use because of my small wrists, very hard to adjust the size"
4.0,"Ring is beautiful, but from the side, you can tell the center stone is a bit loose and crooked. For the price it's absolutely beautiful though. Shipped pretty quickly."
4.0,Fits a little big but overall looked very nice
4.0,"Me encanto el modelo del pantalón, pero la tela no me precio de la mejor calidad, pienso que pudieran encontrar una mejor"
4.0,I love this shirt! It’s so pretty and I received so many compliments! The only drawback is that it’s a little tight around the bottom. The arms and chest fit perfect but the belly area needs a little more flow
4.0,Wasn't bad
4.0,"Great trainer, comfortable to wear throughout the day and inexpensive."
4.0,"nice sweater , fits well, but color differs from what advertise, still a nice sweater"
4.0,I like it but I don't love it. One of the hooks pop just today when I was trying on. The dress is long I'm 5'3so with my heels on it will be lifted without the heels the dress will drag. Now the ruffles going down the butt could have be done a little better. It's like the dress is inside out because the material lining is showing where there should be ruffles. The top is tight but the bottom fits good. Overall Ok dress for the price. The material is ok color is vibrant. The zipper does get STUCKED so be careful zipping up and down.
4.0,"I generally expect ""slim"" things to not live up to their name, but this fits the bill. I'm 6 feet, about 150 lbs, and this fits me nicely -- not too long, not baggy in the arms or armpits. Nice and stretchy and seems like it will hold its structure through washing. I kind of wish it had some more structure at the collar, which would make it look better when worn over, say, a long T-shirt. But worn with a collared shirt, I think it looks ok."
4.0,"Super soft and warm, a little tight though. I have a larger calf and its hard to slide them on. Great for people with long skinny legs. That said it is still a fine quality wool and fantastic product."
4.0,"I like the design. The material is silky, very much light weight. And it fits as expected!"
4.0,"I REALLY want to love it, but...  I ordered to 1 xl and the upper part of the sleeves are tight (I do have chunkier arms tho) and the bust area is a bit snug too (not horrible).  I'm 5'2&#34; (200 lb.) and the length is just at my knees and was hoping it was just a bit shorter, but I don't hate the length.  The colors are way brighter than in the pic, but that's not a deal breaker either.  Not sure if to keep or send back.  I'm torn about this one...  If I can figure out a way to let the sleeve seam a bit, then I'll keep it.  Otherwise, I'm going to sadly send it back. :-("
4.0,"Nice overall, esp. if u can get the thermals off season for under $12... could be warmer and fleece more up on inside but sufficient for southern winters. You'll feel like Robin Hood and stay warm in Sherwood with these!"
4.0,This dress is as comfy as a nightgown but good for a casual sporty dress. Not sure what the fabric is though.
4.0,Very nice dress.  Good material.
4.0,Easy to dress up with a scarf for church!
4.0,Very nice looking watch goes well
4.0,"This skirt is really cute, it actually looks like the picture, and the pockets are nice and big. I usually wear a dress size 14 and the XL fits perfectly, hits directly under my bust and goes to my mid-calves. My only complaint is the material, which I guess should be expected for the price. It is a very thin, almost sheet-like material, and I think that it would be possible to see through it with the wrong mix of lighting and underwear/skin tone. It is also already pilling slightly. That said, the thinness also makes it really comfortable to wear in hot weather. Overall, it's a nice skirt but I wish it was a little sturdier."
4.0,"Its super cute, on the picture here it seems like a thicker jean material. Its light weight which is good. Distressed patches here are not the same spots mine have."
4.0,I like them. They tend not to get foggy very quick.<br />I wich they had more colors
4.0,Love the dress. Good length. But it is see through.
4.0,"I like this shirt. It's a little bigger than my normal size, but not too big to be unable to wear."
4.0,It's crib shoes. My second son was just born but when he can fit into these they will be just​ fine. They are nice.
4.0,"It took a while to come in the mail but I don't think it was the sellers fault.<br />It fits just as expected and is a nice, light sweater."
4.0,I didn’t end up wearing this dress but it’s ok
4.0,Super cute and well made but beware of sizing — women over size 6 shouldn’t buy.
4.0,"The bracelet is beautiful. When ordering this I thought I would be getting two of them.  One for me, one for a friend! Only got one.  It said buy one, get two.  Please advise."
4.0,"A bit too large, but very nice!"
4.0,"Pretty color and very comfortable to wear.  Bought a size up for comfort and it wasn't too big. Hit me just below the knee and I am 5'4""."
4.0,Not as big as I thought it would be and not very good quality but will still serve it’s purpose!
4.0,Product seems to be fine. Four stars because it does not come with pins to attach to watch.
4.0,"This is a thick leather belt with a robust nickle-plated buckle. It has a casual style and can be worn with khakis, but I think is best with jeans. It's sized properly. The quality of the leather isn't what you'd find with a high end belt, but it's fairly good. The belt comes with a small cloth bag for storage. There is no labeling as to the belt's origin, but it looks like belts I have that are made in India and China. If you need a good quality jeans belt, this one will do the trick."
4.0,This crab costume is well made and fit my wife as expected. What is really nice is there is a opening behind the claws to free your hands for use. The downside and the reason for the 4 star is the costume is designed to where your arms have to be held up permanently. There is no way to comfortably hold your arms to your side. Your arms tire out after a while. This makes trick or treat or holding/carrying anything difficult in this costume. I recommend this costume if you do need to wear it for long periods of time.
4.0,Love the material but the pants is too big. I recomend order a size down
4.0,"I love this so much, I wear it every day. It’s a bit bigger than I anticipated but not enough to bother me. I will say that the metal covering wears off super quick, but again I wear it every day and usually end up touching it frequently. Love it for the price."
4.0,"I gave this as a Christmas present to several nephews, and apart from being VERY fashionable, they loved the Egyptian touch of the god.  And it has a multi fit fastener, making it suitable for various ages.  A quality product."
4.0,A beast to put in... but mom has 9 piercings and loves these.
4.0,Looks great. It's a gift.
4.0,Very cute but felt like it needed some underwriters to hold in the books.
4.0,I like that i feel secure know my mask is with me at all times the necklace is the perfect length no to short or long
4.0,I only gave it 4 stars as it shrunk quite a bit after washing. However - it's comfortable and perfect for beach / summer wear!
4.0,Nice looking hat arrived in great shape. From other comments I expected it to run a shade large and needed a slight adjustment to the size. This was easily done. Really like the hat and look.
4.0,"sizes run small, be careful"
4.0,"I LOVE THIS SKIRT. THE FRONT HAS A LONG OPENING , BUT I LOVE THAT IT STRETCHES AND IT MOLDS WITH THE BODY."
4.0,Good deal. Comfortable and looks nice. It broke finally after a year of use every day. I put this through multiple tasks from my work to home chores and outdoors. Held up nicely until just recently.
4.0,"It wasn't thick and fuzzy like it looked in the picture, but nice just a little thinner material than thought it would be."
4.0,size get a size up other than that I love them!
4.0,"Nice boot, but I bought a size 11 (I wear a size 10) and the calf was still too small.  I will purchase Pleasers again, but not in this shoe."
4.0,"As with any over the head bra, it’s tight to get on and sometimes takes some maneuvering to get into it. I like how it feels on and the lace. I have washed several times and they have held up fine in the washer and dryer."
4.0,"This is a very pretty shirt. It's light weight and breezy and so very comfortable. It has thin straps that are adjustable, a v-neck that goes down to the perfect spot. Not too high and not too low. Just right. The neckline has some beautiful embroidery going across the top front of the shirt.<br />This is a shirt that will look terrific with a great pair of shorts or a pair of jeans. You could also easily pull off wearing it with a great pair of leggings.<br />This is a beautiful shirt that I definitely recommend if you are considering it. It's so summery and cooling that it quickly became a go to closet staple."
4.0,Nice shoes like the details unfortunately it was too small
4.0,"I was hoping that this would be stretchy leggings with pleather on the side even though some of the other reviews stated otherwise. The side panel is definitely more of an athletic material down the side. They are still super cute. These are more like a small. Don't let the small/med misguide you. I'm 5'5'' 125lbs and I wear a small. If I was any bigger, my legs would not be fitting into these things. Very happy with my purchase though."
4.0,"Nice tassels, good length.  The rhinestones are pretty - sparkly and doesn't look cheap.  I would prefer a different chain, but overall a very nice necklace.  They should sell matching tassel earrings!"
4.0,The color is true the size is ok. Buy i guess it would be far better if it has a lining coz the cloth is see through. You need to wear a cami bra or a tank top in it.
4.0,"I really like these!! They are just as pictured and do a great job of adding some interest to the wrists of sweaters or other tops, and you can’t beat the price.  Wish they came in more colors! Also arrived super quickly.  My only complaint is that they are really small.  They are stretchy so they do fit a variety of wrists, but my wrists are larger and they are so tight that it feels like it might start to hurt or affect circulation after wearing them for awhile.  Hopefully they will loosen up a bit over time.  However if you have very thick wrists you might not like them."
4.0,I ordered an XL but it was slightly big around my waist. But other than that....it was the perfect accessory for my dress.
4.0,Looks good on the bar had a lot of people ask me where I got them.
4.0,This is a cute winter outfit for my daughter. I ordered a 3T for her & it fits appropriately. The buffalo plaid material itself is a little stiff out of the package but I am confident it will wash well and soften up. The pants are soft with a lot of stretch in them. Very cute outfit.
4.0,"Really great for wearing around the house. I've had a few friends ask where I got them because they are so soft and furry. The soles are foamy but a little thin; not uncomfortable, though. The slippers are a little wider than I thought they would be, but again, not uncomfortable. The &#34;fur&#34; doesn't shed and feels really nice! They are surprisingly warm, too, in addition to being comfy, which was a nice surprise because they are sandals. Would buy again!"
4.0,Definitely runs small. My 22 month old is 35&#34; tall and weighs 25 lbs fits into the 2T/4T perfectly. Thick fabric and fits well besides running small. Just read the rest of the reviews for tips on sizing.
4.0,Works very well! Material is a little itchy but not a deal breaker
4.0,does the job !!
4.0,Really nice material I was impressed for the price!!
4.0,They’re comfortably snug fitting and surprisingly warm. The material has started to unravel after some use but not a bad purchase for the price. Likely intended for smaller hands than my own but I have still enjoyed them
4.0,"Very cute, only thing for me is my face/head is small. So adjusting it appropriately is a tad challenging for me."
4.0,"I love the idea of these, but they miss the mark in a couple ways for me. First, the ring that attaches to the ear is uncomfortable and consistently falls. Second, the chain you run through your ear is small, but still a little bigger than I'm comfortable with. It's not painful, but unpleasant to put on. That being said, the fact that two of these only cost $10 makes me feel better. I think that's a fair price, the jewelry itself looks really nice in person and it's cute when on, so I would feel comfortable recommending this to others at that price."
4.0,"Loved this dress, only negative was the smell from the packaging."
4.0,"I can not wait to see the look on the grand sons faces when they open these!! I have already experimented with them and had fun. I did notice some of them are VERY hard to turn on and hope it does not turn out that most of them are that way. I figure with 40 finger lights they will have enough to share with their friends. I would recommend these for kids and adults that want to have fun!!! And the shipping....came on time, well packaged I would also recommend the seller."
4.0,These are so pretty! I wasnt sure if they would look ok because I have multiple piercings in my ears but I love how they look! I have worn them often and always get compliments on them. they also haven't tarnished or irritated my ears
4.0,I really love this suit . The quality is great for price . I bought this one size up and it fits great (I am usually a size medium / 6 . I only have one complaint that I wish the bottom was a tad bit higher and was one piece instead of having to clip the top strap .
4.0,"I bought three of the Russell Athletic Met's Dri Power Crewneck Sweatshirts. Living in a cold region, they are a nice comfortable shirt to put over a lighter shirt to help keep me warm.  They fit as advertised and the price is reasonable for the quality. I wear them regularly and I feel confident they will hold up for quite a bit of time. Given that, I think they are suitable for everyday casual use."
4.0,"Nice and light, great amount of yellow and the floral print isn’t bad; I’ll be having my prescription put in them."
4.0,"Flattering dress. I’m 5’7” and 200lbs and the XL fits perfect. It falls to the knee and isn’t too form fitting, so the mom bod isn’t a problem. Warning, the neckline is VERY low cut, so the girls will be on display. Overall, very nice dress."
4.0,"who knows what normal head size is, but I think my head is normal sized and it is a little small. Not quite tight enough to be uncomfortable. I like that the beard is removable."
4.0,Bought this for my wife and she liked it. And she id tough to please with online orders. It looks and feels as expected.
4.0,"These were really cute, but a medium was wayyy to big for me. I highly recommend going smaller :)"
4.0,These are exactly what I expected... Just a friendly gift to say &#34;have a great day and I appreciate you&#34;. Came very fast so would use vender again!!! Thanks
4.0,Great ring for price. Has not tarnished and have worn for a few weeks. I Have recieved compliments on.
4.0,"A bit small, but it will work for traveling"
4.0,"Wore all day,  Very comfortable.  Love the pockets."
4.0,Very pleased with this item.  Good quality and cool print
4.0,"I bought this to use when going to events at public stadiums. It’s a good purse. It could be a little wider but I don’t pack it like my regular purse, just take the minimum."
4.0,"Beautiful bag, expected it to be slightly bigger but it'll do."
4.0,Nice gift for Aunty
4.0,"great product, fits perfectly, durable, comfortable and it looks good too"
4.0,"I got 3 of these shirts already different logo & color. You can use it as a big large sleep shirt like your sleeping in your bfs shirt, dress it up with leggings, use to workout in, or pair with biker shorts. Its loose & a stretchy feel, not like a solid cotton shirt that feels tight around collar, chest, or arms. They feel so comfortable i got 3 and waiting for more."
4.0,Beautiful but one of the sticks was broken when I got 'em. Couldn't wait to try 'em so super glued 3 coats. It worked! It is steady enough to wear all day.
4.0,"I will admit at first I did not love this when I received it !  At first it was very uncomfortable to wear I guess my wrist is more of a medium not a small and it did fit a little tighter than I wanted ! Also where it clasps together it is uncomfortable. The piece of metal has a sharp spot that kind of goes into your wrist !<br /><br />All that said, I really do like the item and as I have wore it over the past few days it seems to fit. Better and better!<br /><br /> This is a great option to secure your fit bit and not have to worry that it's going to fall off !"
4.0,"I got this pullover for my daughter, and she loves it! She likes this type of hoodie big and roomy and I ordered XXL and it fits perfect - she typically wears XL. It's very soft and cozy and she machine washes in cold water and hangs dry. She's accidentally dried it in the dryer and it seems okay. As of today, the price is about $31, and I feel that's a fair price."
4.0,"It's cute, portable, and it's my favorite color. Four stars only because it could be wider so it could hold more stuff. But, it's in great condition! Love it!"
4.0,Very pretty but stone was if centered in its setting. I'll wear anyway.
4.0,"While a bit large, this definitely protects from the cold.  A good product!"
4.0,Love how they fit and wash
4.0,"Great fit, looks terrific. Gets snags fairly easily but they can be pulled thru to the back."
4.0,"Love it! Great value, thick fabric, beautiful color. The only negative thing is some of the seams around the bust are a little obvious. But of course, if someone is staring at my boobs long enough to notice, I think the problem is on their end, not mine."
4.0,I really wish this came in a 3X because I feel like it runs small. I bought the 2X and it fit more like a 1X. Such a shame because it's really cute and seems well made.
4.0,Nice jacket. I would have ordered an larger size but the large is okay with a light shirt underneath
4.0,I did not know the fabric was polyester when I ordered it. Good thing I ordered xlg  because the sizes run small. Only 2 pockets instead of the usual plethora in Bibb short denims. Comfortable though🎭
4.0,Nice summer sandal but they run a little big.
4.0,Good stocking stuffer
4.0,Refer to the photos attached; 46 Inch stated is not matching to the actual goods I received - only 41 Inch as hsown  in photos.  I think goods itself is acceptable
4.0,"Definitely on the snugger side of the spectrum, but the XL I received still fit. I recommend sizing up if you want have a more relaxed, baggy it."
4.0,It’s a little small but looks like pjs! Very disappointing for pictures.
4.0,"Kept little hands protected. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they are not very long so if jacket slips up, snow will get in the edges of the gloves. Didn't happen often nor did it seem to bother him. He loved the design and kept his hands warm. So over all good. He is 7, average size for his age and these seem snug. Like they wont fit in a couple of months and definitely not next year when it snows again. Perfect for younger kids"
4.0,"Not so tight fit for the size, which is expected to look sexy. Metallic layer is shiny as pictured, but I worry how long it can stand before rubbed off."
4.0,Great fit<br />Soft material<br />Nice length
4.0,Bleh ok
4.0,"I do love the look of this coat, it appears as wool but isn’t (allergy to wool) the one piece I did not like is the belt. For the price you pay it shouldn’t feel so flimsy, it does run larger, I usually get a L and purchased a M, I am 5’10 175lbs. I can just purchase a different black belt to complete the cinched waist look, overall definitely worth the price."
4.0,Nice socks. I hope they will launder well over time.
4.0,"A great winter boot, but was a little snug around my ankle. :( liked the style a lot."
4.0,Like the floral look and the nice way it flows.<br /> This was an Easter dress from the husband.
4.0,"The good:  it’s soft, warm and comfortable. I like the soft fabric.<br /><br />The not-so-good (for me):  I ordered a small but it is a lot bigger than I wanted.  It’s definitely more of a jacket to go over another shirt.  The bottom of the shirt is 4 inches above my knee and the width of the material when laid out is approximately 44” (I’m not a big person so I’m swimming in it).  Also, it is to be washed by hand or dry cleaned.<br /><br />So this could be perfect if you want more of a jacket or if you have a larger build."
4.0,"A beautiful piece! I like the idea of a fairy whispering in my ear. Unfortunately, no matter how I adjusted it, it would not stay on my ear (is my ear too big?).  Maybe I can turn it into a pin."
4.0,A little pricey for a keychain but my daughter loved it.
4.0,Perfect for my uniform
4.0,"This shirt is too long for the short people like me who stands at 5'2. I imagine it may be too long for those that are average height of 5'6, but it is a beautiful piece."
4.0,"I wear a size 16 pants and ordered a 3XL bathing suit.  Fits very comfortably and well, especially with my 40DD girls.  I will leave an additional comment after I have a chance to wear it in water."
4.0,"Really cute, with fun vibrant colors!  But order up a size or two if your little one wants to wear it as a dress.  My 6 year old wears it as a shirt, and my 3 year old wears it as a dress."
4.0,The hole in the middle of the dress is cut to big. Overall the dress was beautiful and for the price you can’t beat it! Got a lot of compliments.
4.0,Good quality but runs a bit tight.
4.0,Top portion is somewhat bulky
4.0,this shirt is a gift item that I was decorating for the Christmas season. I had to was it & then dry without softener due to the type of decoration. I laid it flat to dry @ it wrinkled very little without being put in the dryer & a light steam iron took care of the remaining wrinkles. fabric is soft to touch & should be a welcome gift.easy care shirt
4.0,These are lightweight and super fun!  Will add a touch of chic to any outfit.  I knocked off a star because the tassels do shift.
4.0,"I was so excited to find these! They fit great, and the band on the top is really fun and unique! The stitching on the pockets came undone after the first wash. Had to hand stitch them back and haven't had any more issues. Other than that I love them!"
4.0,"To whom it may concern;<br /><br />Thanks, I always bought plastic watches and then I decided to purchase a more stable watch? It's doing fine?! Thanks?!"
4.0,"I love this suit minus one thing. The back of the botttoms ‘folds’ a little while being worn, which wouldn’t matter except the inside is white and looks strange when this happens. Otherwise it would get 5 stars."
4.0,Unos son muy bonitos pero otros no
4.0,Well made. I wish it had more features but this is a fun bracelet that has a lot to offer.<br />It seems sturdy and solid no no problem wearing it every day. I love the whistle :)
4.0,"I love the way this pendant looks and fell when I wear it,With the names plainly written. My favorite purchase so far."
4.0,A little too fake looking for my liking
4.0,Keep the sun off my arms works great.
4.0,"Overall happy with shirt. One small problem, hard to tell front from back. No marking/label along collar and only minimal difference of neckline contour so often put shirt on backwards"
4.0,These is a great Jersey for the money. I actually bought another one as soon as I received it. I just wish they had more colors to choose from.<br />They run a little small so size up for a perfect fit.
4.0,Box is great but the lock is a bit of a pain. I have to jiggle the key to lock and unlock it. It's not bad for the price if you don't mind an annoying lock...you'll love it if you don't plan on locking it.
4.0,Thick but still good quality.
4.0,"Not the jj brand perfection brand which it states, but I really like it.  It is a bit wrinkled, but the fit is very flattering.  Can wear with leggings, dress, jeans."
4.0,So I love this septum ring. It’s very pretty and sturdy the magnet stays in no matter what but it hurts really bad when left in your nose for over a minute. It pinches it really hard and it makes it feel numb.
4.0,The fit my son really good. He said they are comfortable and feels great. My only complaint is that I pick A-grey camo and I received the army camo. I would purchase again hopefully I get the correct color next time.
4.0,"This cardigan is overall pretty comfortable. It is soft and lightweight, perfect when you want to be a little warm but not too hot. The only thing I do not like it is it is very oversized. I am 5'4 and heavy-set and usually I am an XL but this is even very baggy on me. The arms are loose and it can look a little baggy. I would suggest sizing down one or two sizes if you want a more normal fit."
4.0,"I am giving 4 stars because I while I love the what I received, I did not receive what was advertised/pictured. The color is as pictured, but the neck is rounded, and there are no buttons on the sleeve. I did order the style with this description (there are multiple styles in this listing).  I sized up based on other reviews because I wanted a looser fit, and the fit is great. I still love the color, but am disappointed that I did not receive what I had ordered.."
4.0,"I am 5' 4&#34; and this was a little long but otherwise was a nice fit. Ultimately, it wasn't that flattering on my body type so I did return it, but I could see this looking great on longer ladies with slender bodies!"
4.0,"Unfortunately the colour blouse I received was not the one I ordered, was disappointed but kept it anyway as it would have been too much of a hassle to return. I ordered the same style and brand in a medium before and it fit great but this one felt a bit more snug because the material was different.  Nice blouse otherwise."
4.0,a bit tight on the shoulder but very well made. can't wait for the weather to cool down so i can wear it
4.0,Fragile but pretty.. difficult to fasten
4.0,Very sexey...not to short. Love the back overall Very nice I will buy again in different colors.
4.0,"Slightly tight, but not enough to keep me out of them."
4.0,Received several compliments. Felt comfortable
4.0,It feels a bit matronly... perfect Mother of the bride dress. Not so sure for a cocktail party. Skirt fabric was a bit odd & makes a lot of noise. Looks great on.
4.0,The tone of gold color is a little too strong (too yellow) for me.
4.0,"Sizes run a little small, but nice fabric and construction"
4.0,Just as pictured and so soft!
4.0,I really like the urn and feel good about purchase. My only complaint is that they didn't come with a fill kit as others I've seen.
4.0,They fit great look good
4.0,a little long on one side
4.0,A little heavy for me to wesr regularly
4.0,"I wore this for Halloween 2017 and it was a huge hit.  I ordered late, so had to take what I could find in terms of size.  I ordered a large men's size.  I'm a 5'9&#34; woman.  The jacket and shirt fit quite well, but the pants were too tight (no surprise, being a girl).  The sleeves were a bit long, but it worked.  I think it would have been well worth it to have it custom tailored, if I'd have had time.<br /><br />The quality was good overall, especially the coat.  It's well-designed, made from quality fabric, and even has a lining.  That said, several buttons fell off the pants and coat almost right away.  I had to sew them back on (not a big deal).  I didn't have time to reinforce the rest, so I lost at least one more button on Halloween night.  Both the coat and shirt were really wrinkled upon arrival, and it took some time to iron them out.  Steam worked best.  The overall costume effect was fantastic and worth the extra expense and effort.  It didn't look &#34;costumey&#34;.  I accessorized with a curly black wig, lacy white gloves, big round sunglasses (like Prince wore in Purple Rain), etc.<br /><br />This is a good quality costume if you don't mind a little extra and effort and expense to bring it to life."
4.0,"A little smaller than usual, but otherwise fine"
4.0,The style is perfect. Be aware that the lens scratch very easily.
4.0,Love the top!! A little too big and had to be altered...  my wife is tiny!! Can’t believe that anyone would send and item in the condition this one was!! A big hole?!? Really?!? Thanks to Amazon for the refund and for helping us deal with the situation! Good job 👍 !
4.0,"Exactly as pictured. They’re cute and they don’t irritate my ears. Only gave 4 stars because one broke immediately upon putting it in, but for the price I can’t complain too much. Still a good deal, and with so many sizes, I don’t really miss that pair."
4.0,"The dress is really beautiful! The bottem is gorgeous and well made. The black top part id a bit cheapy and thin but that comes with the price. Some complaints, I’m 5’9 and the dress was dragging. But most of all, this dess is not very flattering. I’m a plus size woman, so I’m always looking for sliming clothes but this dress made me look pregnant. In the pics you can see it gave me a belly that I don’t really have.  HOWEVER! If those things don’t bother you,than I would really recommend getting this dress."
4.0,"I'm guessing these are a men's size SM/MED as I am a woman & they are quite big on me. The fleece is the thickest & warmest of all the tech gloves I've tried (e.g. Olympia, Brookstone). The palm & much of the palm side of the fingers are a rubber-like texture, making gripping door knobs, steering wheels, phones, etc., easy. However, since they are so big on me, it is difficult for me to get the fingertip touch pads to work on my phone. I have examined the inner seams & think I can turn the gloves inside out & stitch them shorter & narrower to make them fit better. No one I've contacted has a similar glove in women's or teens' sizes, so that may be my only option, sewing them to fit. Otherwise, they are a wonderful pair of gloves. (If only they had fit better....)"
4.0,"I received this dress somewhat later than I expected but I have to say that I am not mad any more - this dress is so beautiful, so different. When I first saw it, I was a little worried that it would look a little old fashioned and strange on me. I am 5'4 so not one of the taller women, and this dress goes right down to my feet, just covering my ankles. But when I wore it, I received so many compliments that I actually completely forgot my concerns. But not only because of the compliments, also because I felt absolutely comfortable in this dress. The material is a rather thin one and, unfortunately, it's not the greatest sewing quality. A few threads stood out on the chest area and the seam on the bottom is not sewn properly. ( That is the reason I am not giving this 5 stars) But I ran it through the sewing machine and now it's all good.<br />The price was absolutely fine for me and I have been wearing this dress a lot so it most definitely has earned its value in my closet.<br />I am very happy with this dress and like wearing it.<br /><br />One thing though - for heavier chested ladies the top may be a little tight. The material doesn't give much so that may be a problem. But as a smaller chested woman this dress fits me perfectly, top and bottom."
4.0,Fits & feels great! Cute & comfortable
4.0,"Nice and soft, slightly see through, but it’s a cute comfy dress."
4.0,I loved the cost and the weight of bracelet. It looks like it will last for some time.
4.0,"I like it for what it is. There's a line that goes across the bottom of the skirt that I can't seem to get rid of because of the pleats, but it's still cute. I spilled a cup of water on myself while wearing the skirt and it dried off really quickly, so that must account for something. I'm pretty happy with the purchase. The waist is fitted but stretchy enough to let me breathe."
4.0,I just bought this for halloween and I just wanted something fun and scary for halloween to entertain the kids. So i was looking for some scary masks and I came across this one and I thought this had a pretty good scary look to it. I just received like a couple of days ago and it comes with a charger wire for it lighten up in the dark and it looks pretty scary when you wear it in the dark.
4.0,nice looking necklace for the price.  seems sturdy as well.
4.0,"A little bit long to use it as bracelet, nevertheless, I liked it."
4.0,I bought the green medium. I and 175 lbs 5’8. It fits perfect in terms of size but the side which goes off shoulder needed to be a little lower off the shoulder. Other than that I love it and the color looks great against my skin.
4.0,It's easy-going summer pants. A bit short but not to the point it is becoming hot pants. It's comfortable. not a see-through material but it's linen. Need a bit of ironing or steaming.
4.0,"I really love this cute winter pajama set, but be sure to size up. I am typically a small or medium and I ordered the medium. The bottoms are a little too snug for my liking, so I would size up one to two sizes depending on how relaxed of a fit you like your pajamas. Otherwise, these are awesome!"
4.0,"Took forever to get them, but they are exactly what I wanted/needed."
4.0,"I love these, they are great for work. The only reason I don’t say 5 stars was it was falling off my face all day long, they’re just a little big"
4.0,Turns your finger green
4.0,"I liked it but unfortunately it was bent, which cause it to be hard to open. Glasses was also bigger than expected."
4.0,Nice top but form fitting
4.0,Like that they are very light
4.0,I love this so much I came back and bought 2 more. Thank you
4.0,"It is hard for me to rate these because I think they would be an excellent choice for someone with a fairly small head. I have a large head, and they were too tight for me. But I would not want to discourage others. Just be aware that if you have a large head, they may not be comfortable."
4.0,"I liked the purse and seemed to be in good quality. I think the shoulder strap would be better a bit wider. The zipper tab is in an awkward place, but I haven't yet used the purse. I think it will be handy, though."
4.0,"The scarf is very true to color and design, I just wish it was a little longer.  The only issue I have, and the reason its lost a star, is the metal around the stone is a little jagged and catches on clothing, it should be easy enough to shave down though."
4.0,"I expected this to be a little more tapered, but it looks a bit baggy on me. I still like it alright, though."
4.0,"Too much material in the calf area can trip you up.  Had to hem the regular length a lot, but the short length was really too short.  Call them my ""goldilocks"" pants.  They dry super fast when wet and are comfortable to wear, but def.  not a ""winter"" pant for many as they are a very thin material."
4.0,It's a beautiful band and works like it should. Only thing I have a problem with is one side pops off from the watch face randomly and I almost lost the entire watch and all.
4.0,L is like XL but great thick material with streatch
4.0,My husband loved the color and that it fits as expected.
4.0,"Ordered the purple and blue. Not as rich in color as the picture shows( purple not as dark and blue not as royal), but the dress itself still fits great and floor length. I’m 5’3 and had to hem them a bit but it’s by preference."
4.0,"This purse is exactly as advertised, and I have no complaints that it didn't match the description or picture. Having said that -  I didn't love it - and I think it is actually made from pleather - but it might fit the bill for someone else."
4.0,"This case is just a little too big for my needs, but all the other cases I had were just a little too small.  So, I prefer to not have my glasses crushed, and this case does the job.<br /><br />The dimensions are slightly smaller than the stated 6"" long x 2.25"" tall x 3"" wide, unless my ruler is broken.  I measured outside 6"" long x 2"" tall x 2.75"" wide.  Inside 5 1/2"" long x 2"" tall x 2 1/2"" wide.  The lining touches the bottom & top of the case on the inside, but the sides are sort of flared, and that eats up some of the side to side & front to back space.<br /><br />As other reviewers stated, it does seem to shed a little in the beginning...I've had mine for 10 days, & it seems to have stopped already.  I didn't carry a cloth to wipe off, I just used my breath to blow it off & that seemed to work fine to clean the lenses of the ""fluff"".<br /><br />I would buy again if I needed to.  For the price you can't really beat it.  The outside construction is very sturdy.  The lining inside is also very nice, but, I'm not too sure how it is attached to the outside, so that will be interesting to see if it reamins attached.  If I remember, I'll update this review after some more use."
4.0,I received my earrings and I love the look of it. I am concerned whether it is genuine silver though because one of the earrings was bent and while putting it on the post was bending fast. It seems a bit flimsy to me for silver. Real silver is supposed to be sturdy and not bend so easily. I love the grade of the stones though...they are shiny and nice. Overall the earring is nice but is the quality of the silver I am worried about.
4.0,Small but perfect. I'm not a purse girl at all but this is perfect.
4.0,"Delivery took longer than expected. The quality of the product is exactly as stated, 4th quality. There were a lot of pieces that were were not cut of extra plastic and a few screws missing that I needed to replace."
4.0,Fit is for adult. Definitely costume wear
4.0,"Love the cushion and fit, just wish was taller on calves"
4.0,Cute. Will wear it this summer.
4.0,"Cute dress, fits well, held up well after a wash. Got a lot of compliments at work"
4.0,The only suggestion I can make is to put something in the details as to how these locking earring backs work.  So that we are sure to use them properly.  I thought MAYBE something would come in with the product - there wasn't though.<br />I can certainly understand how it's more efficient to put the info online.<br />Happy with the product so far
4.0,Just a little too long but we still love it!!
4.0,"I received the product right on time as promised, I was shopping for a foldable duffel bag as I don't want to pay for a check in bag in a round trip flight when I need it just one way and this bag serves the purpose well. Additionally, I can use this bag for gym as it has seperate pocket for shoes too. The quality is good for a foldable bag. The bag has lot of wrinkles when opened, but that was expected. Packing it back needed couple of minutes but that should be fine provided with other advantages being it foldable saving space when not needed."
4.0,Orange on boots looks more like pink
4.0,I love these I live alone they’re cozy they’re comfortable but I wouldn’t wear them in front of anyone else because they’re a tad bit see-through and I’m not sure what others might see it might scare him too much. But if you’re looking for something really soft and cozy and comfy and you’re alone these fit the bill.
4.0,"It's a little snug in the cups but that's ok. There are these weird seams under the arms that rub, but I'm hoping that goes away with wear. Overall a good supportive sports bra."
4.0,Really nice a little wide for me I have a narrow foot but nice quality and pretty .
4.0,"I think the dress is beautiful! I love the material and style of the dress, unfortunately, I had To send it back because of the sizing issue. The top area was too large, while the rest of the dress fit fine."
4.0,Colorful really like it!
4.0,"I loved the fabric' and style (all 4 stars for that), but fitting is very loose on upper body which makes it look little I'll fitting."
4.0,"I have several of this brand of dresses and they are really good quality. The only issue I had with this is the bottom part in the back seemed bigger than it should be. I bought a small, like all of the others I have but it just seemed bigger. I'm 5'6, 127 pounds."
4.0,Good bag and pretty but shoulder strap isn't long enough.
4.0,Nice looking boots but do run a little small in size 10. Very nice leather and look better than picture. Not for large calves.
4.0,I gave an overall rating of 4 only because the top of sock is too snug under the knee. That being said I do have large calves. I live in Arizona so I must say I didn't have them on 10 minutes and I could feel the heat. I don't know that there is a compression sock out there they would feel cooler in the summer. It is a nice sock. I get overheated easily
4.0,Cheap plastic backs
4.0,"the wings are fairly good and the wire allows you to adjust them. they even fit a older teenager for a halloween costume. they tend to lose some glitter and you will probably find your back to be covered with it, but overall pretty good!"
4.0,"MIGI Colorful Novelty Socks are a nice blend of 80% cotton, 15% polyester and 5% spandex.  They are comfortable and stretchy and stay up well.<br /><br />I machine washed them in cold water and let them air dry.  There was no shrinkage.  There are loose strings on the inside but they are trimmed which helps avoid those annoying toe catching loops of thread.<br /><br />These MIGI socks are delightful, bright and cheery, and designed to add a bit of whimsy to an outfit."
4.0,These are nice but they are WAY bigger than I thought they would be.
4.0,It could've been longer. I'm 5'9&#34;and it only comes to my ankles.
4.0,"Love how it looks on me. However, a zippered front would be next to keep it completely closed.  I wear a full slip underneath."
4.0,Good gift for a pre- teen.
4.0,Ordered extra large and it was still a bit small. Love the hoodie though and is comfy. will just need to lose a couple pounds to fit perfect which I planned anyway.
4.0,"I got an XL I am about 175 lbs and 5'3"". Like the other reviews, this is not really an ""off the shoulder"". It just has a larger opening at the top and button closure on the back. Decent for the price, I mainly bought it to lounge at home."
4.0,It's very stretchy fabric and the design is very vibrant. It looks just like the picture and I'm very excited to wear it. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the seam at the bottom wasn't stitched which made me think it's not going to last too long. But I am super excited for Christmas to come so I can wear it.
4.0,"Very cute summer tank or cover up. The unique back is fun and I received many compliments on it. I washed it carefully ( I'm not going to dry clean a cover up, as it suggested) and it shrunk only a little."
4.0,Good size for a girl
4.0,"This is excellent quality, but too heavy for me to actually wear without hurting my neck. If you don’t mind heavy stuff, it’s really beautiful."
4.0,I really loved this bag! I got it to use as a gift bag knowing it would be used for many other things as well. It was a good quality!
4.0,"A little tight, but made them work.  Completed 20's outfit, won 1st place."
4.0,really cute! Some were a bit white trash but was worth buying the whole set! Never unclipped while doing activities :)
4.0,"Very pleased with this passport holder. The snap stays securely fastened and I am able to put a few credit cards, eliminating the need for a wallet."
4.0,Love my pig slippers a little snug at the top and got the largest size and they like just fit with no wiggle room that god they’re a slip-on slipper but still cute and happy purchase
4.0,"I am 5’5 and weigh 116, so I ordered a small. Way way small. Sent it back and ordered a large and that fits! Want to wear this under my black leather jacket and it will do fine."
4.0,"I purchased these to wear around the house. For the price, I am content. The fabric is soft. I ordered a size up and the elastic still feels snug around my hips/waist, but nothing crazy. I typically like things looser around the hips/waist to avoid muffin top. The leg openings are not skin tight, which I also like. The length is great, my butt is not hanging out from back. I am 5'3-135lbs and ordered L. Depending on your preference you can get away with ordering true to size, but if you are between sizes, size up."
4.0,"I recently went through some health issues that landed me in the hospital for 2 weeks and in a skilled nursing facility for 6 weeks.  I got tired of wearing hospital gowns, so I ordered a couple of these in different colors, and they worked fine.  The fit is great -- I usually wear a size 2X in Worman Within, or 3X in anything from QVC -- I ordered a 4X in this nightshirt and it was perfect -- a little loose but that's how i like it.<br /><br />Colors are nice.  The only drawback is it can't be dried in the dryer.  At this point, I wash by hand and dry on a hanger in the bathroom.  It works fine.  Love the colors and style."
4.0,"The watch light is a bit dim and not really easy to read at night, but overall it's a great watch! Very stylish and perfect for work."
4.0,Absolutely love it! Perfect fit.
4.0,I ordered having read the reviews and deciding I was okay with whatever color that came but it is definitely red. Would love one that was orange as well! It's cute either way.
4.0,I love it. However it's not a full bangle and it can be difficult to fasten. The edges dig into your wrist
4.0,It’s a pretty necklace.
4.0,The fit at the top is a little right and that is exactly what you want. I don’t want to spend the day pulling up my shirt.
4.0,"My brother loves it. He says it is really warm, but it is not quite as thick as I was hoping. I personally would not use it as outdoor wear right now (I live in the Midwest) but I am a female and perpetually cold...<br />The imprint is really good, no mis-registers and the red lining in the hood is a nice touch. It matches perfectly with the red in the imprint so if you are particular about that stuff, this item is perfect."
4.0,I get lots of compliments.  They're comfy.  I wish they were soft.  Perfect option from your traditional sweat pants.  The drawstring comes out when washed even after I tied a knot.
4.0,"of course, great sweatshirt ! It is a Russell"
4.0,It’s a little snug but I have a big head it comes with Styrofoam  padding I don’t need except for on the bridge of the nose a little rough on the nose but says that it’s an amazing mask definitely going to use it for my next convention
4.0,I would like to get the old time cotton shorts from years ago that would be great but these will do for now you can't get them anywhere
4.0,This is actually nicer than I expected. Lot's of compliments. I love the box link.
4.0,This is not very long. I ordered a large and am normally a 12. It is more fitted and not flowy. It fits more like a regular cardigan. I actually like how it fits but the fit does not match the picture.
4.0,"The thing I like about this Men's Casual Skinny Polyester Silk Necktie is that it’s fun. I did not grab it thinking it would be a top of the line - or even middle of the line - kinda tie. I got it to wear to be fun and memorable. I liked the dragon and the cool blending of blue and black, knowing it would pop with certain outfits.<br /><br />From the get-go my wife and I loved the cool look - it does look great in person. The color and the dragon really pop nicely. But it also looks cheaper the closer you get. There are lines in it - texture - that look cool - but while I’m not a tie expert, there is no way this is silk. Polyester, yes, but not silk. I’m also pretty sure it’s just a died/printed on pattern - the wash/care instructions say not to wash and don’t rub too hard - I’m guessing because it would rub the color right off. As you can see from the pics - the back of the tie, the two sides of the material are not even aligned down the center - but are “stitched’ together off to the side. And that little flap on the back - the material is not even colored under there, supporting the color theory. This is NOT an expensive tie. This is a fun tie. This is a wear out, but knowing it probably won’t last long tie. I’ll enjoy wearing it, but no, I’m not expecting longevity. If you go in knowing that, you’ll be good to go.<br /><br />I decided to give this Men's Casual Skinny Polyester Silk Necktie a 4 star rating because 1. it does look cool in person, 2. I like the design, 3. I went in with certain expectations and they were met, but also it does not rate 5 stars because, 1. it is on the cheap end, 2. the color and design are put on in a way it could easily come off (I’m not going to test, but we did question out loud what happens if the tie gets wet). 3. they barely even tried to line up the material, and 4. it’s not good enough to be 5, but also did not go as low as 3 stars because of... everything above. I felt 4 was fair for what I wanted, expected, and got."
4.0,Good fit but beware of sequins falling off and getting caught on things. Lighter and thinner than expected.
4.0,Very nice quality. Fits my 9 yr. old fine
4.0,A little thin but nice
4.0,"Very cozy & comfortable. My new go to pants! I ordered the large because reviews said to size up but they were kinda big in the crotch area. I then ordered the medium, form fitting but a better fit for me. I’m 5.5 & 150lbs."
4.0,Not as thin as i hoped. But lots of space for credit cards. Looks like it's decently made.
4.0,This belt is too short I am a 34 and a half and It Don't Fit
4.0,Looks nice. Kind of short. Fits as expected. In reading other reviews I was expecting a boxier and bigger fit.  For me that is not the case. I would suggest to order your regular size.  Shipping/ delivery was quick
4.0,This is a nice watch from Fossil.  I also got it at a great price.
4.0,Four star product
4.0,Great set of inexpensive glasses. I love the style. Nice change from the basic brown and the pink is just enough. (not an overbearing or bright pink)
4.0,"Very cute, run about a half a size bigger - big socks for winter make it ok so I will be keeping them."
4.0,"The material was poop, the the jeans was cute!"
4.0,I like the comfort of no buckle.
4.0,"This isn't the best backpack ever (it needs more pockets), but for the price it is spectacular. I used it for a 3-day backpacking trip with some other ladies. It held up really well and fit my needs perfectly. Another woman on the trip had gotten a very expensive hiking backpack at the local store, and hers ripped. This one didn't. It still looks as good as new, even after some rough treatment. It is big enough to fit most of what we need. I wish it had straps on the back that were more removable than these are. It was difficult to hook up a sleeping bag and roll on the outside."
4.0,"Fit well, but fogs up."
4.0,"I am a 6ft tall 163lb guy, I love the shirt but it shrank a little and now is tighter and shorter than I'm comfortable with, I might reorder a size up."
4.0,"Too big for kids, mostly for adults but they are nicely made."
4.0,"Being the first lingerie piece that I've ever owned, I would have to rate it as a 4 simply because the design of the product doesn't particularly work for my body. Reading other reviews I went with a size xxl, regularly wearing a medium or large depending on the brand, and etc. It does have some adjustable straps, but the torso seemed to be too small and the crotchless seam was entirely too big in the front, coming up to my belly button and making the whole thing just a little strange in my opinion.<br />It arrived in two days with prime, which was great and came just in time for valentine's day.<br />Overall it is a well constructed piece and I would definitely buy other pieces from Avidlove, I just do not like how high the crotchless seam comes up in the front, leaving an odd open area that takes away from the piece as a whole."
4.0,"Really nice and well made. The material is very thick, which is nice but also prevents it from falling the way it does in the pictures. Still a very pretty piece of clothing."
4.0,They fit my daughter perfectly as next size up is what she needed. She seems very happy with them. They are easy for her to put on herself as well with the velcro.
4.0,"Wore it this past Halloween, and got a lot of compliments. Loved It!"
4.0,"I love this shirt, smooth comfortable material, lightweight, and it looks nice. The fit was perfect. I like the designs style and colors. It’s a nice blend between casual and golf shirt haha"
4.0,My daughter loves the hat and gloves set. It goes perfectly with her coat.
4.0,I recently had surgery and my doctors said to wear comfy clothing so this is what I chose
4.0,Nice casual pants
4.0,Fabric could be a bit more supportive.
4.0,fits nice however too short.
4.0,Button fell off really easy and the right pocket already had a hole in it
4.0,I have had the band for about a month. Some of the paint is wearing off. I like how easy it is to put on.
4.0,Nice dress but to small good quality just order size up.
4.0,"This dress is beautiful. The fabric is soft and flowy, the length is perfect and gives a very sexy feeling. I would recommend."
4.0,3 1/2 stars!! Good product and fit just know the fabric skirt is thick stiff material. Top/tank is stretchy.
4.0,"Me encanta el color! Tal cual esta en Amazon, lo que es un poco dura al usar los compartimentos internos.les pongo la foto para que se pueda ver"
4.0,So I'm rating the product 4stars only because the picture is misleading.<br />Other than that<br />Package came in a week before expected due date.<br />Shirts feel snug and size fits well.<br />Worked out in them<br />They make me sweat.<br />Overall for the price it's good.
4.0,I love those loafers but they were too small.
4.0,dopest graphics but sized in china. I ordered a xxl and I'm 150lbs and skin and bones and its too small. also really thin. not meant to keep u warm
4.0,Decent quality for the price.<br />I’ve actually worn these in nice restaurants and nobody gave me a second look and had no idea I was wearing swimming shorts.
4.0,"This is very see through. I really like the print and the cut, however. I make it work with a tank underneath."
4.0,top is amazing bottoms are too thick!
4.0,The handbag has a good design & is functional.  The Zippers are not too small.
4.0,"I got this dress in the mint color and it is very pretty. I am 5'7 with 30in waist and 42in hips. The large fit me well. The fabric is stretchy and forgiving. I gave four stars because the lace straps are a little rough feeling. Overall, great dress."
4.0,"I ordered a size large. From the sizing chart given a large is a size 6. I am almost always a US size 6. I'm 5'11/160lbs/36C, long torso and a 6'0 wingspan, athletic build.  The sleeves are perfect size for my long arms, and hangs down past my hips! If I could reorder, which I probably will, I'll order a medium next time. There is a lot of room in the large, but that's me. So if your around my dimensions, I'd order a Medium.<br />The actual flannel is awesome, super soft and great colors! This will be perfect for Winter in the South."
4.0,"I think this glasses are very beautiful, they are light and fit comfortably. I just wish it would also have some magnification in the top part of the lenses. Overall it is a good product, I'm glad I bought it."
4.0,Nice glasses ...very fancy
4.0,like to much very nice
4.0,"Fits well, but wrinkles easier, even after a light ironing the wrinkles come back."
4.0,A bit costly and nothing special about the quality
4.0,Bought it for my sister and she is ok with it. Good bargain for the price.
4.0,I have a big head and this just fit me. I really like it but the fabric is not that thick. So wouldn’t wear on very cold days. well made and really like the locking cord.
4.0,Worked and fit great
4.0,Good fit. Like the alligator clips. Love the stirrups.
4.0,"Longer than I want, but I think I can adjust. But goes perfect with the necklace I have! Looks like the photo and came packaged nicely."
4.0,"The recovery of the Jersey is not that great but fits well, and comes for the most part as you’d expect"
4.0,Sandals work much better than I thought Great relief for my neuropathy I highly recommend them
4.0,Cute sock. Thinner then most stance socks.
4.0,"This is a good mask, it stays in place during workouts. It can hand in neck when not using and easy to put on as soon as you need it. Only complaint is, it could have had more space in front of the mouth to breath little easier."
4.0,Great cover-up!! Cute for a summer dress..
4.0,It beautiful but the zipper broke
4.0,Spouse has used for glasses - much improved vs. no treatment.
4.0,Wish the had Powder coated and a Satin stainless colors
4.0,These are very very cute sandals just run a little big for my little girls feet
4.0,"A little big for a size small .. will have to have it taken it a bit . Otherwise I love it , just in time for summer 😍"
4.0,"Great fit and soft, quality material"
4.0,Fits as expected.<br />Tends to look a little faded after a few washes.
4.0,Cute hat. A lot heavier than expected. I wore it all night for a Halloween party. Decent for the price and fits as expected.
4.0,"I have trouble breathing when I’m required to wear a mask. Luckily, this gaiter doesn’t rest on my nose and mouth. I also like the ear loops that hold the mask in place but easy to put on and remove."
4.0,love the material but kind of see-through
4.0,I broke about 2months after but over all good product
4.0,"These are practical and look very nice. I ordered the green.  True to color.  It was slightly difficult figuring out how to open the silver ring and then lock it in place.  But once I figured it out (Directions are included, nonetheless.), it was not hard at all. I am satisfied with the purchase."
4.0,"I like it. I little small for me, even i am a person size small and thin. But Is pretty."
4.0,"Fit and quality as expected from the description and reviews. Comfortable, come just above the ankle bone as desired, and don't slip or shift. Price for pack of 3 provided very good value. The only reason I didn't award 5 stars is that I haven't had them long enough to assess durability, which I expect will be very good."
4.0,Cute but they are not adjustable unless they was talkin bout the elastic but still was too tight for 4 year old
4.0,"Bought @ Costco (~$20). Not breathable enough for typical summer day, but will keep for spring/fall weather.  Love the chin strap & adjustable internal wicking sweatband (although cotton rather than synthetic might absorb better).  -1 point for being too hot for summer use."
4.0,"We ordered 2 of the fire and ice wolf design for our kids. For some reason the kids 6-8 size arrived within a week or so, the next size up will take about 2 months to get here. But that's not the weirdest thing. The worst part is that the kids 6-8 is gigantic on our 6 year old son. It's more like a woman's size S. I could easily wear it. Too long and too wide. Both kids of course adore it and want to wear it at the same time, the design looks beautiful, although I have yet to wash it. The fabric is very smooth and not lined, so it won't keep you very warm. It's more of a fashion piece. I wish the delivery and sizing were more consistent. I am nervous to see what kids 8-10 size will look like, and if my petite 8 year old will be able to wear it at all."
4.0,Very cute shirt and the colors are nice and bright. It seems a little bit smaller than average though
4.0,"This is more of a closer to the body fitting jacket.  Keeps you protected and warm w/o the bulkiness to hinder movement.  Plenty of pockets, detach. hood and sleeves w/inner cuff keep arms warmer..Nice looking too"
4.0,"We had to exchange for a different size, but my first impression was quite positive.  It's hard to find pajamas with feet in larger sizes, so I was glad to find these."
4.0,I love the concept of mismatched socks.  These are the best.  I wish you could get more in one pack!
4.0,Charms are sideways
4.0,"This is a very pretty, well crafted ring of good quality. Its true to size and<br />arrived in a timely manner. In this case the ring pictured is slightly prettier<br />than in person. The pic is more vibrant and blue than the darker shade it actually<br />is. I would have preferred how it appeared in the pic, but it is attractive and has that<br />great gothic/vintage look that I come back to time and again when buying jewelry.<br />A good purchase at a more than fair price."
4.0,Bought three for a party.  We love ARGGGHs!
4.0,"I love wearing these earrings. They are sparkly and shiny and look great on. They are fairly small, and not heavy.<br /><br />The clasp closes securely so I was not concerned about the earrings falling off. I wore them all day comfortably."
4.0,"Pretty fricken cute!! A touch shorter than i thought it would be but not to the point where anything is hanging out. Its pretty loose on top, unless i had fashion tape to keep it on my body id be flashin my boobs to people so i will likely wear a black or white bandeau or a bralette underneath! But i love it! I cant wait to wear it!"
4.0,I bought this for a sleep shirt and it is great for that purpose.  I have actually bought a second!
4.0,"The model in the picture must not be very tall. This sweater is much shorter on me. I'm 5'8 and ordered a small, the sweater does seem relatively true to size as far as shoulder width. The sleeves could use another inch in length and it could be a bit longer for my taste. Hoping it will stretch a bit over time. Seems well made. Slightly itchy out of the bag, but I believe that will subside once it's washed. Took over 6 weeks to arrive. Overall a decent purchase."
4.0,Love the look. I have a small head and the medium is a firm fit.
4.0,"I didn’t listen to the other reviews and ordered regular size for my child thinking it would be fine if just a little big he can grow into them, but was way too big so I returned and went down a size and they fit. Look like nice shoes otherwise."
4.0,"I purchased this product for support to a pair of tired and weary legs. This is my first experience wearing support hose but I wish I had started five years earlier. They’re comfortable.<br />I’ve found them (2 pairs) to be well constructed and durable, although I’m not wearing them 12 hours a day- yet.<br />I must disclose that I can’t compare these to other brands, because I have not worn any other brands."
4.0,"Bought this for my son and he absolutely loves it! The quality isn't the greatest, but for the money spent, it's pretty good. The material is nylonish, so it isn't as warm as we'd hoped, but I would definitely recommend this. Perfect for those jeans and t shirt days when the weather is chilly, but not snowing.  💙"
4.0,I love the boxy look this top is lovely.  Can be worn with jeans leggings or any type of pant.  You can make s casual look fun and put together.  This is a top you can wear alone or anytime of the year under a blazer for a nice look. I'm a satisfied customer. Delivery & packaging perfect just hang up & ready to wear.
4.0,I like the style but the fabric was a little lighter than I wanted.  I was hoping it would be a heavier fabric.
4.0,It is a little snug. I will have to make some adjustments but I love the look it will give my costume. I hope the sacrifice is worth the discomfort. Cute but breathing room needed
4.0,Looks great but the stitching is already coming out
4.0,Fits true to size and extremely comfortable. Enough support for stomach and hips. Just ordered another
4.0,These are some great socks! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is one of the pairs' openings were too tight and I had to essentially tear/break it to get my whole foot in. But since then that pair is also fine.<br />Size seems accurate. I am a size 12 and these just barely fit.
4.0,"I have a very prominent brow (a Scorpio trait I’ve been told) and most other goggles have a problem with fitting because of this.  They would leak like a sieve and I’d have to stop every few laps to empty them out.  These fit perfectly, don’t hurt, or squish my eye sockets.  The only problem I have, and I think it’s a big one, is that everything is out of focus under water.  Everything above water is fine and in focus.  But under water, lane lines are blurry, other swimmers are blurry.  I’ve read the questions and answers on the item listing and understand that it’s possibly a function of a curved lens?  If they had a flat lens that fits this well, I may have to invest in those when I wear these out."
4.0,"I love these sunglasses.  They go perfectly over my glasses, just like they're supposed to, and I especially love that there is a tinted &#34;hole&#34; on the sides, so I'm not feeling boxed in by my shades.  They are not very dark, however.  This is the only reason I will not give them a 5 star rating.  They are definitely better than no sunglasses at all, but I do wish there was a darker tint to them so I could wear them and be comfortable at the beach."
4.0,I ordered twice.
4.0,Love these! I’m ordering another pair as backup. Had one of the screws fall off just yesterday 😩. Would be nice to have an extra screw or two thrown in with the purchase of these glasses. By far my all time favorites!
4.0,nice and light weight
4.0,Bought for a friend. Love them. Just didn't fit.
4.0,"My son likes all the typical gamer stuff like Fortnite and Minecraft, so I thought these masks would be fun for school. They held up pretty well after like 10-15 washes, but now the seams are starting to give out. I was able to save one by sewing it back up, but I’ve had to throw away 2 of them from the ear loops breaking. Overall not a bad deal, the masks fit my 8yo son pretty well. I do wish they would’ve lasted longer than a few months, but I would probably consider repurchasing some if need be."
4.0,Great fit and look.  The nose pads take a little getting used to with this style of sunglasses.  One issue with them is that when I pull them onto my hair the nose piece sometimes snags my hair.  I'm good to go as long as I remember to NOT do that.  :)
4.0,"cute shirt, nice fit.  I read the reviews so i brought a large, as i can normally go for a medium in most Women shirts.  Simply wear a cami underneath to deal with the sheerness and low cut of the shirt."
4.0,Used the size chart and item description and it fits perfectly. Good quality and good stitching. Would recommend!
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:78601c4b297407e2af086917293a6114]] Only a couple of small imperfections but overall I'm very pleased with this purchase! Yes the crystals are real, I ordered the Red River Jasper."
4.0,"This type of bracelet don't Close properly, its open in your hand constantly. But is really pretty."
4.0,"Fit good, but a little too long"
4.0,"Cute tee, fit is a bit small - I sized up a size based on other reviews, and it fit perfectly. Fabric is a bit stiff, but otherwise awesome design."
4.0,Was easy to make necklaces with and fast. It’s kind of cheap fashion jewelry. Don’t get wet. We made these at a bookclub meeting activity.
4.0,Used it for a few weeks and no issues
4.0,Adds style to wearing a fitbit!!!
4.0,I loved the ring. But had to have some of the pointed stuff under the stone smoothed out. I wear it alot.
4.0,I feel like I embody the opening credits of ‘Saved By The Bell’ when I wear this and it makes me tear up with joy just thinking about it.
4.0,watch head is small
4.0,This watch is pretty good looking for a casual but classy look. You can wear it pretty often without it looking worn so I would say its good quality. The band is rather thick though which makes it slightly uncomfortable but that isn't too big of an issue for me.
4.0,Looks good. Sturdy.
4.0,Amazingly comfortable first day worn. Cushy footbed and adjustable straps allow you to adjust for comfort. They are not as bulky as some sandels currently popular so good for casual or more dressy. Have received lots of complements on these. Love that they also come in low-heeled version in same style.
4.0,"Be aware that the&#34;se are NOT clip earrings. I thought they were because I found them after doing a search for &#34;blue clip on earrings. My sister has pierced ears, so I'm giving these to her. Cute earrings but they are pierced not clip ons."
4.0,"i measured my hand prior to ordering. fit was shown as medium which is what i usually wear. the garments material is really nice. it is well sown. the fingers on me are about 1/4"" too long, i will keep to wear under other gloves , but would not wear by themselves"
4.0,This is exactly what I needed. I have a Cartier watch with a black band. Cartier was asking $300. for a new brown leather band.<br />I took a chance with this one and it turned out perfect.
4.0,This product was easy to apply as I followed the instructions. Although the product did not last as long as I liked it. I had to re-apply every 2 hours. Still a viable product to use for my glasses.
4.0,"I liked it but returned because it was WAY too small, i recommend a size up."
4.0,"Very useful product,easy to install and very comfortable to go with,the perfect solution for people who don’t like or can’t ties the  shoelaces ."
4.0,My grandson has thick ankles and these were too tight for him.  I gave them to another grandson and he wears them all the time.
4.0,I ordered a size large fit wonderful in the waist the thighs were a bit larger. I would have like more of a spandex feel around the waist. But overall nice product!!
4.0,"Based on other customer reviews, I ordered a size larger than I normally would. The material is soft, stretchy and comfortable. These are really long in the legs. but I am only 5'4&#34;, so they might be made for taller women? I also love the hidden pocket where I can put my phone when I am doing things around the house."
4.0,Very soft and comfortable but the medium is very tight across the chest. It is a long very slim shirt.
4.0,I ordered the ears for my daughter's birthday party. I was not satisfied that I could not rush the order because I needed the ears with 1 week. I didn't get them until after her birthday party but was able to use them for Halloween. The quality of the ears was a lot better than the ones that I bought from Party City to use on her birthday. I would recommend the ears for everyone but would suggest to order them at least 2 weeks in advance.
4.0,"Anklets are definitely cute! Only issue is I had to frequently re-tighten the strings, as they do not stay in place at all. Only knocked off 1 star because of that, though, since they are so inexpensive. I’ll probably end up just re-threading/stringing them with my own thread & fastener. So they’re worth it to me just for the charms! Cheaper than craft store charms already."
4.0,"It’s really cute jumpsuit, does lean a lil to the smaller side, And wat you can’t see in the picture is that it has very shiny silver rhinestone like or lil studs all over it, let’s just say I was called Elvis and everyone laughed, it was pretty funny, so you definitely will stand out. I still really liked it though. I ordered a medium and for more comfortable Loser fit I wud go with a large, and I’m short and have the thick booty and thighs, unfortunately I had to send back do to a few issues of missing items and the stitching  issues with the zipper. I’m not rich, this was me treating my self for a new outfit for my son’s graduation party.. so didn’t have time to order or trade for different one and for the price these issues were big deal to me, since I can’t afford to buy items like this."
4.0,"Came exactly as depicted, Nicely made, and comfortable to wear. Comes in a nice little pouch which is nice so I won't lose them. They are a little big on me so I can't wear the double necklace one but other than that it's a nice product."
4.0,Perfect! My daughter loves them.
4.0,Great replacements for Oakley frogskin. Cheap! Great quality too.
4.0,nice color on the stone. Pay attention when ordering they are very small earring.
4.0,Good quality. But would rather pay the mall a trip and get sized.
4.0,Did the trick. Color right on the ball
4.0,To longer to arrive than I expected
4.0,They run a bit long
4.0,Good Quality sock for men or women.  Socks are tight and good for compression of ankle and leg.  Not tight at all at toes.
4.0,"Shopping time was acceptable. Purchased in the size I thought I'd need it in, and was surprised to know that I could've sized down and would have made it the perfect look. But with it being a bit oversized, wasn't too too bad, just preferred tighter. Would order again, it's still cute as seen in other customer photos."
4.0,Love the fit. Better than expected. But just tried them on and theres a stain that appears to be permanent on the thigh :(
4.0,"This was a cute design with a lightweight fabric suitable for summer. However, sizing runs large causing the cut out neck line to be much lower than it appears on the model. Company graciously made a quick refund when requested."
4.0,"I purchased this for my niece who is graduating from high school. I did have to put it together each piece is not attached to the ring. The box is great and I can use the same box, each piece is protected by a plastic film. I can't wait ti give it to her at her graduation dinner."
4.0,These came has expected for the price. They are great
4.0,Plastic turtle frame started wearing away after 1 month of moderate use. Wooden frame was made ok but had loosened after some use as well. Overall decent quality as they will hold up to wear on your head. But the lens frame doesn’t seem up to be as sturdy as more expensive alternatives. The cheap cost is preferable as it would be less expensive to just replace them for another pair if they do break.
4.0,"Originally purchased to wear on a cruise, I opened the earrings to wear on a date night with my husband. I lovvvve the earrings. The bracelet and necklace are also really cute, I’d probably wear them separately so I’m not too matchy matchy."
4.0,"I loved the blue color, and the fit was okay, the neck was too tight - even tho I ordered it over-sized.  Had to send back."
4.0,Decent quality but too small for a mans head. Wish they were clear about the size.
4.0,Cute. Fairly comfortable.
4.0,"Perfect fit, wish it came in more colors"
4.0,"This dress is very well made.  The built-in bra is one of the best I've ever seen in a gown.  The lace bodice is soft and stretchy.  The skirt part is double layered, with chiffon over a solid under layer...both stretchy.  The skirt is gently gathered at the waist, which on me came a bit higher than my normal waistline.  The fabric at the waist is a bit shiny, and very pretty.  The neckline is finished off nicely, and the ends of the sleeves are scalloped lace.  As you can see in the photo, the built-in bra has the silicone edging to help hold it in place.  The deep purple color is rich and dark, a great alternative to black. I got the dress in a 12, which fits like a 10. Follow the size chart measurements, as they are accurate."
4.0,"It does give u a slim look which they actually claims on thighs area but could have been better at tummy area. Although, I am very happy by my purchase because this does not slip down my tummy atleast. I ordered and tried quite a lot of these and I always prefer black color to look slim as well everytime however ever one of these had some issues. But when I M wearing this one it does look good and stays in its place. I hope you find my review helpful for atleast xl size people. Because I am a xl size person myself and have suffered a lot."
4.0,"I have paid the same amount for a single pair before... these are good, but the edges are a bit odd."
4.0,I’m scared to washed it but the designs are cool.
4.0,"This dress is very stretchy, but the material is a bit thin. It's also not the color I expected, it looks more rust than camel. I bought it to wear in winter, but I will need to wear very thick pantyhose under it."
4.0,"Way to small, ordered a large and it fit more like a small.  Gave to my daughter."
4.0,"A nice product. Could use an instruction sheet--for instance, you need to glue the cord ends into the grips."
4.0,Great style for the rxtemely affordable price!
4.0,"This garment os for a very petite woman with small or no breasts. I still liked the top, but had to give it away."
4.0,"It took me awhile to find lighter fluid for this lighter. Be careful when striking! Do not strike toward the opening or the inside will light! As far as the lighter itself, it's very attractive and should last. I do have concerns about replacing the wicks on the striking end. I'm sure they'll burn out eventually.  As for camping or keeping it near the charcoal grill, I think I've got a winner!"
4.0,Fabric is very light weight but I liked the style & fit
4.0,Strap can be used little longer
4.0,"I have students ages 5 to 9 and we did an art project decorating masks. The problem was, they were too small for even the smallest kid. I bought some straps to sew on to lengthen them"
4.0,2x fit like a large. Or 1x
4.0,i loved the fabric! ships fast
4.0,Maybe not as cute on me as on the model
4.0,It’s a cheap watch and does the job. It’s kind of thin so next time I’ll get the slightly clunkier one.
4.0,"As described, a bit pricy! Front pockets poorly designed, when you set everything falls out!"
4.0,This was so cute on my niece and she loved it. Only problem is it missed her birthday. It took a really long time to get and it was a prime item so bummer on the shipping.
4.0,"I'm 5'2&#34; and ordered a Medium. It hits the floor even when I wear 3 inch platform shoes.  It's a loose dress, and I could have ordered a smaller size, but the dress doesn't seem to be much shorter even if I order a size down."
4.0,"I like the blouse.  However, not a fan of the brass loops needed to hold up the sleeves.  I think buttons would have been better."
4.0,"After washing, shrunk a bit. I don't like tight fitting socks. For that reason, only 4 stars."
4.0,"Ordered a large black. I like the loose yet clingy fit. Only complaint is it looks exactly like a thermal pajama shirt, just thinner!! Softer material & cuter, but not quite as attractive as I hoped it would be. Still will wear around the house."
4.0,"I'm 4'10"" and the front goes past my knees. It's very pretty though,  but I returned it."
4.0,I love it but the pants is too thin
4.0,"Wow, this really runs big!  I am 5'2&#34; and 145 lbs (hourglass).  I love the length-- it hits right at the floor with  bare feet for me.  I am usually a 10/12 in pants, M/L in tops, and I got a small.  I'm hoping it shrinks a little in the wash because it is BIG.  The material is great-- thick and well made."
4.0,"Very quick shipping, and good quality for price, but the necklace is very tight-fitting and stays close to the neck."
4.0,"For the price an the material that it is...it was a great buy, great gift, an overall react reaction an satisfaction I got from it!"
4.0,I LIKED EVERYTHING ABOUT IT EXCEPT IT WAS STILL TO LOOSE EVEN AFTER I PUT IN BOTH INSERTS. I GUESS I WILL NEED A THICKER INSERT.
4.0,I like it still i will put a t shirt under it to cover the back ..but it srrves its putpose
4.0,"Very nice shades, however the frames did have scratches on them."
4.0,"Update: About 4 months ago the purse started to get worn, still using but the cute print is slowly disappearing. I honestly plan to just buy another one since it has lasted.<br /><br />Very Cute but smaller than excepted."
4.0,"I felt this piece was good quality, however I returned because it was slightly too big."
4.0,"I really like this dress, it's a little small but nothing that takes away from it, it's still super comfy and I enjoy wearing it. However there's rubber lining on the top of the dress to help it stick to your skin and for me it was always shifting. Nothing a little tape couldn't fix."
4.0,"A little bit larger than expected, but great sizing and adequate number of card slots and space for cash to be kept without having to fold before putting in wallet"
4.0,"For sleeping, that's all this can be really recommended for. The legs are pretty stiff, so don't drop anything, just lay in bed. The shirt has a better fit, though I recommend a size up."
4.0,Super cute. The writing isn't as dark as the picture though.
4.0,"I really like this purchase.  I had been looking for some basic gold studs that weren't too small or too big.  These fit the bill.  I do agree with other reviewers however when it comes to the silicone earring backs.  One night sleeping in them and my earrings were almost lost for good.  The back on one was lost completely and the back on the other was recovered after careful inspection of my bed sheets.  I ended up replacing the lost back with an earring back from a pair that I no longer wear.  If you do decide to purchase, I would recommend either being careful of when you wear them or purchase some separate spare backs to keep in your jewelry box just in case."
4.0,"These are pretty decent shoes. You can tell they are not originally made for the US market as they don't have tags indicating what they are made of or US sizes.<br /><br />The style on the shoes is not at all attractive, but I am not reviewing the style and the build quality and the materials on the shoe are pretty decent. They work well for light jogging, do have a little bit of roughness from the tongue. Stitching is used around holes to prevent them from coming undone."
4.0,I should have gotten a small I got a medium I’m 5’4 168 they r too long but over all they r great just should have gotten a small
4.0,These dresses fit large! I just had a baby and am still a little fluffy 😊 But I should have gotten a medium. They really fit huge!<br />Even still I love the dress!!!!
4.0,These are great earrings and do the job nicely for the price.  I bought these earrings for my daughters to avoid spending large amounts on earrings that they end up losing.  These so far have been wonderful the clasp is tight and secure.  They were just larger than expected.
4.0,"These 18k round cut diamonds are the perfect accent to any outfit. Can be worn classy or trashy, casual or fancy., hip hop or bubblegum pop. Now instead of just feeling like a boss, you can be the boss in style. This necklace literally sparkles and is a bold statement piece that adds to your shine without overpowering your outfit."
4.0,"small for large busted women, beautiful color and material"
4.0,Nice houseshoes
4.0,"5‘8“, 170 pounds. Usually wear a large ordered an extra large, fits gray roomy, flows but not jumbo sized. Material is soft a little shiny, no smell. I ordered black gray and white. I would stick with the darker colors, they look more expensive. Sleeves long length long. Good for me,I would order again."
4.0,Much larger than I expected (ordered a medium) but comfortable and casual
4.0,"Nice product. Having trouble locating refills, though."
4.0,Definitely size down if you want a more fitted look.
4.0,I'm considered short at only 5'1&#34; and this is a bit short on me.  I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the length.
4.0,Pricey but comes in handy
4.0,"I was searching all over for a pair of boots similar to my ones that unfortunately finally broke after 4 years. These were the closest I could find in similarities. Yes, the boots do have the size written on the flap when you fold them down. However, I took alcohol and cotton swabs and rubbed the writing off without damaging the boots so it is possible to remove the paint. Second, the shoelaces are very stiff which I may be biased bcs my older boots were custom fit to me at this point lol. Overall I liked the boots they’re comfy enough, very light weight. The one thing I didn’t like is the tongue of the boot when you fold it down is also plaid and they’re different in color from one another (L&R). I prefer the all black tongue so it’s not as “in your face” with the color of the plaid but it’ll do. Sizing was accurate but I will say after wearing them for only 4 hours my feet smelled HORRIBLE. Not sure how to fix that bcs I’ve never had that problem but goodness it was a lot. Overall though good boots hopefully get them broken in with some heat and use they will be just like my old ones."
4.0,"Pretty earrings, but the green is slightly dull - over priced is best description- I’ll post pics later"
4.0,"I bought these for my Mom, who has intermittent swelling in her feet, as the strap adjustments should have made these wearable on any given day.  However, as some other reviewers stated, the toe area adjustable strap is nowhere near long enough to accommodate her foot.  If the velcro had extended further they might have been usable, but it stops too far down on the strap to provide much expansion.  We will be returning these."
4.0,This item was a gift and the person loves it
4.0,"It's a warm, comfortable coat. It's worth what I paid."
4.0,"Such a cute dress, my 3 y/o daughter loves it. But like the reviews say, the sparkles do shed ALOT. Not a huge deal bc I’m already vacuuming all the time, but they do stick to the floor, skin ect. Still worth it!"
4.0,These are cute shorts.  they fit well and are made well.  these are great distressed denim shorts and are stretchy.  I like the color of the denim and the fit/style.  very fashionable.
4.0,"It's super cute, but it tends to often be turned around or oriented wrong on the bracelet.  Might not be the case on everyone's however.  This is one of the cutest angel beads that I've seen."
4.0,"Looks nice, but not very durable"
4.0,"These run a bit small, so I had to return them and get a larger size. They are super cute and my son loves them, but they aren't made super well, they are canvas after all, and he is a boy, so they were torn after about 2 months of wear. They weren't super expensive though, so it's not too bad, I was just hoping they'd last a little bit longer."
4.0,Anime fans will love it. I got it for my 12 year old sister and she cried she was so happy. Its not a cheepy wallet but its not high quality. You get what you pay for especially when most good anime stuff comes with a high price.
4.0,"I originally wear a woman's size 10-12 I ordered 2X and it fits before drying. Until I wear them out a bit I won't dry them. I love them because they cover my butt and they go down about an inch and a half if not two inches in the thigh area. In addition to, the seller is awesome for making my order special by giving me the colors I asked for. Plus some colors as stated by the seller are different. I notice they are darker, which I LOVE, just letting you know. But the seller, I believe, has more variety"
4.0,"Very nice color, thinking of buying the other colors as well.<br />Can't go wrong with the price here  as well.<br />Great addition to anyone's casual wardrobe..."
4.0,"Don't count on the chain AT ALL! It broke right away and just by pulling it slightly pieces kept breaking off.<br />The charms seem strong and are very pretty. I am separating them into 2 gifts, so didn't really need the chain. Would have been happier if the charms were sent alone, I couldn't believe how cheap the chain was."
4.0,"Very nice.  I have received a lot of compliments.  Not very heavy, but for the cheap price I was not expecting an exquisitely made timepiece."
4.0,Nice beading.
4.0,Cute but came pretty wrinkled..
4.0,"I'm pretty surprised how cute this is for the price. I personally wouldn't wear it as a dress, but it looks great as a tunic with skinny jeans or leggings. I ordered my usual size (small) and it fits great. The side pockets are a nice feature! Photo includes Urban CoCo Velvet Cardigan which I highly recommend too."
4.0,"5'3"" 140lbs. Ordered M and L. Medium was the winner."
4.0,I like the style of this cover-up. I am petite so this is big for me. But like it nonetheless.
4.0,"One of my favorite watches, dainty and very striking."
4.0,"Just got these in the mail and was excited to finally have new bands. Upon first glance, I thought something was off. Going back, I realized that two of the bands were slightly off-color to the photo displayed on Amazon (which I've attached). Not a big deal to me, but it's why I'm giving this item a 4/5 instead of 5/5 – I was expecting the ""Cactus"" one to be more green and the ""Smoke Violet"" to be more grey. The ""Milk Tea"" color is otherwise spot-on to what I was expecting.<br /><br />Aside from the color distortion/expectation, these bands are super comfortable, easy to put on and take-off. So far upon first wear, it feels like my old band from Apple with the a bit more security because of the latch instead of punch-hole style of normal sport bands. Same comfort for everyday wear and workouts. Still highly recommend, but if you're picky about colors, just beware of the Amazon posting vs. how it may appear in person."
4.0,VERY THIN!!! But very soft. The image is a little too faded and aged but its a cozy shirt. Just dont get it for warmth - you can literally see through it!
4.0,"I like the root beer color of these sunglasses, I thought the height of the lenses was much bigger"
4.0,"These biking shorts fit as expected. They are super comfy while riding. The waist seems to stretch a bit, as they feel like they are getting looser as I ride, but luckily there's a drawstring. I like that the side pockets are zippered and large enough to fit my phone, and there's also an unzippered back pocket. These seem like they'll hold up a really long time. The only reason for 1 start deduction is that when I am walking in them, the material swishes loudly. I don't need another reminder that my thighs touch lol :-) Other than that, this is my 2nd pair of Club Ride shorts (2 different styles) and both are really nice looking and enjoyable to ride in."
4.0,I’m 5’3 and the length of the medium was very long. I’ve gotten long dresses from Amazon before and didn’t have this problem
4.0,Comfortable fit and great for hiking
4.0,"I really wanted to like and keep this suit, it looks so cute and the reviews were great. But I would either need to grow bigger boobs or a bigger butt, because it was just too big for me. The material was very loose around the sides/hips where the suit swoops down to meet the butt. I typically wear XS/size 0 and this was just too big so I will have to return it.<br /><br />It did seem well made and the print is very pretty, so I would still recommend it to most women (just not the tiny ones)"
4.0,"It's a good pair of sunglass although I was a little disappointed when the arms got bent while in my back. Good sunglasses, okay build quality around where the arms connect to the frame."
4.0,I didn’t like the product because they had baggy pockets and I returned them and re-ordered a pair that didn’t have pockets which I like very much now I’m being charged for the pair that I returned that evidently you never received it. Not happy
4.0,More attractive than pictured.  Fits well (bit large but he will be there shortly) nice material.  Decent value
4.0,"Could be a better quality. Material was a little flimsy, otherwise a good product for fun for kids"
4.0,"Didn't end up using it as dress it was purchased for didn't have large enough skirt. :( Still fit ok, though."
4.0,"These are pretty, well made, lightweight, and comfortable. The only drawback is that they are a wee bit smaller than the half inch I ordered. They slip in a bit too easily and feel loose enough to lose if touched the wrong way. They do stay in place but just aren't truly half inch."
4.0,The material is thin and it's borderline on having that cheap feel to them. Overall though they are very comfortable and I would buy again in a different color.
4.0,"They are ok. They are for children but I am an adult woman and they work fine. That is, they make back of shoe strong so you can slip in your foot. I bought them because they'e cheap. I bought 4 of them to leave in different places in the house so that I can get shoes back on easily no matter where I take them off."
4.0,"This Christmas mask is soft, adjustable,  comes with 2 good quality filters, vibrant colors, a real value."
4.0,buckle is a little odd to start but I have tow of these belts and love them.
4.0,"I love the faded lenses look so I thought I'd try these. I never look good in the cat eye shape but I I though, since I was given an option to try at a discount in exchange for my review, I jumped in. They are a bit cheap looking. I like my glasses a little bigger. These are not very big at all. The faded lense looks ok, its subtle. Not as faded as I thought would be.  The lenses are very thin so it makes it look cheap. Pretty flimsy. It may be a cute pair to wear around, not ones that will pass for an expensive pair by far. They dark lenses part isn't too dark at all. If you are looking for that it isn't the one for you. I got the black from and lense glasses. I wouldn't buy the same pair again."
4.0,New bandanas. Nice colors
4.0,Perfect for winter boots. Not too thin.
4.0,"This is a super cute outfit, but the pants are WAAAAAAY too big for a newborn.  I am a newborn photographer and the pants are big even on a 10lbs (older baby).  The outfit is awesome though, if you're using it for a bigger or older baby. Makes for some awesome photos!"
4.0,Not great for my concealed flimsy but as a belt its good.
4.0,"This is one of the most comfy hoodies I have now. It’s lighter weight than most hoodies, but I don’t mind. I normally wear an XL hoodie, but ordered up and got a XXL, because I know sometimes clothes run small on here. I am glad I did. It fits a little big, but I’m okay with that for hoodies. The fabric is soft and not clingy at all, which is a plus. I love the floral/solid pairing too. I got the grey roses version, and I really love it. I only wish it had pockets like most hoodies."
4.0,"I love this. I only wish it was a little thicker material, it's pretty thin material. It's nice though."
4.0,"It is bulkier than I had imagined, but it did work for the purpose we bought it,."
4.0,It left the leather supple and looking new!
4.0,"too big in bust, tight in waist but freaking cute! even had lining...sad I had to return☹"
4.0,quality product but fit is smaller than expected. will have to do alterations
4.0,I bought these for my Niece and she absolutely loves them! I did not give it 4 stars based on the material of the pant was not what I expected and they were a little see through (she wears her leggings under it to prevent that problem) She loves them in spite of those issues
4.0,These shoes are very comfortable and well made. The sneaker bottom makes it perfect for kids so they don’t slip and slide on the floor. The only reason I gave a 4 star is due to the fact that they run a big.1/2 sizes would be perfect.
4.0,"ETA: After speaking with the company, they promptly sent me a replacement necklace. This one has held up after two wears. It is delicate, and shows off the decolletage well.<br /><br />I bought this necklace to wear to an event. It was smaller and daintier than I imagined, but that was okay, it still looked nice. However the fringed attachment fell off halfway through the night, on my very first time wearing it. Clearly very poor construction."
4.0,Haven't worn them yet but just got them and tried them on and they're super comfy!! Like others said they don't wrinkle too bad even right out of the bag. About to order them in a different color already. I'm 5'8 135lb and ordered a small and it fit better than the medium.
4.0,I actually was surprised how nice this bra fits! I wore this to dance to give it the ultimate test and it was nice! I wished it came up a little bit higher in the front (less cleavage) for when I jump and lean over but otherwise I love it.
4.0,"This was really cute, thankfully not quite as big and droopy as pictured. it looks great with a white long-sleave onesie underneath (in the winter). My daughter has probably worn it 5-10 times and the seem next to the zipper, at the ankles, broke apart. I don't even ever open the zipper seem, just using the buttoned shoulder to pull on and off, so I am not sure what created the tear. Seems like it's made well, but not great."
4.0,"This was a beautiful shirt and great quality but VERY slim. I would order 2 sizes up. Im 125 and 5'5"" average build and a medium was not only tight but the sleeves were also too short for being more formal. Other than suzing, very elegant and flattering"
4.0,Good product. I was looking for some compression sock that weren't really thick and bulky these socks are light weight and still apply plenty of pressure. They really don't look like accurate ekg's but they are still cute.
4.0,The charms are beautiful but the chain is too inexpressive looking.<br />I knew my bff had a prettier chain at home so I just presented the gift without the chain and she loved it!<br />Worth the money!
4.0,"Fabric is very cheap, but the price should tell you that beforehand. I’m 5’4” 125lb ordered small."
4.0,Lint magnet
4.0,"I love how soft and light it is, but, It isn't very solid.  More for looks than warmth.  It's very nice though."
4.0,Love this. It's adorable but does run big. My daughter will have to wait until next year to wear it but its worth keeping
4.0,"I ordered this dress for my cousin's wedding. I read a lot of the reviews and I ended sizing up.  I'm 5'4 and 125lbs. I am a size 2/4  (depending on the dress).  I ordered a medium.  I received the dress in 2 days which was awesome (I have prime).  When I received the dress, the material did not feel cheap at all for the price.  I tried it on and everything fits except for the top.  It was way to big but the bottom fit me perfect. I sent it back and wanted to order a small but there wasn't a small. I ended up ordering a small from a different seller and it was way to tight so I sent it back. I recommend you ordering up a size and getting it alter at a local alteration shop. It was a near perfect dress for it's price."
4.0,my kinds inner spiderman.  Socks quality is good
4.0,Like easy care
4.0,"I liked the pattern for Christmas, but I don't feel comfortable wearing it on another occasion."
4.0,"These earrings are very pretty, but much smaller than they look."
4.0,"This is a gorgeous piece that fit like a glove! It looks beautiful on stage, and I will definitely be buying this in every style. My major complaint is an extremely flimsy zipper that gave out after two wearings."
4.0,"The mouse pad does function as advertised, in that it contains small blue LED lights that make the unit ""glow in the dark"" when you have the lights off. And I want to emphasize that the LED blue effect is really only visible in a dark or semi dark room. It does have four working USB ports, conveniently placed, and these also function as advertised. Mind you, these are not ""Powered"" USB ports, so don't expect to run your printer off of them.<br /><br />My mouse pad is a different shape than the pad pictured. My mouse pad has concave sides, whereas the mouse pad pictured has convex sides. Maybe it's a different model, but I kept it because this wasn't a deal breaker for me. BTW, in a dark room, this thing is REALLY bright."
4.0,Like it☺
4.0,Beautiful!! But too long as it passed the knee. I need to be taller to wear this.
4.0,"shoes dont fit, but i am giving 4 stars because they are that cute - might reorder in a bigger size"
4.0,"These are weird (in a good way) and oddly fabulous pants/culottes.  I didn't notice until after I'd washed them for the first time and hung them up to dry (as directed) , but they are made very simply: it's just one huge rectangle of fabric, folded in half and then with another fold over piece in the front with the elastic sewn into the middle to create a waist. So there aren't really ""legs"" to these pants. It's more the corners of the fold at the bottom that are left open to create the leg holes.  I wish the pockets were deeper (too shallow for an iphone or wallet) and that the front flap/skirt section went all the way around in the back (it's only in the front). All told, they're comfortable and easy to move in. I'm 5' 7"", 140 and the elastic waist fits about right - not too tight.  If I knew how to sew, I'd slap together a few pair myself, but since I don't, I'm going to enjoy wearing these and getting compliments."
4.0,fits nice and is very high waist
4.0,I have small breast and bought the large which fits good....boyfriend likes the design of the feather cup...it's a looks only bra....no support which is what is expected....flirty fun
4.0,"I really wanted to give five stars because I absolutely love this necklace!  The only reason I had to knock a star off is because it breaks very easily.  I've purchased three of these over the past six months and they definitely don't stand up to my kids little hands, which are attracted to anything pretty."
4.0,It's a tad small for my head but it works great!
4.0,so far so good.  They look and function great.  Durability is yet to be determined.  I have only had them for 2 weeks.
4.0,socks are doing the job. not excited about colors. I am 78 years old and some of the colors are a little to bright. nice that they are not going all the way up the leg
4.0,For someone without a flatter stomach it isn’t ideal - I felt myself picking at it/putting my hands in the pockets to try to cover up a little more. If I did a few crunches it would be perfect! It’s soft and comfortable and super cute.
4.0,Replacing the original strap on a fenix3 HR from 2015. This was a Quick install. Feels good. Looks good. Let’s see how long it lasts.
4.0,Very modern and should hold up a bit. Nothing really lost if pieces are misplaced.
4.0,Works good so far
4.0,Great shoes. My 8yr old daughter plays hard and wears out her shoes fairly quickly. She says these are comfortable and they are still holding up after about a month of wear
4.0,Really like them. However only 7 of the 8 pairs came and I was really looking forward to the Opal set and that’s the only one that didn’t come. Trying to contact to get the pair sent.
4.0,Love the earring and it arrived sooner than expected. Just wish it was a pair.
4.0,Cool and comfortable for summer
4.0,Love it! Its different! Nice color
4.0,They great for clients as gifts.
4.0,"Cute racerback sports bra with a scoop neck. The pads are removable. The material wicks moisture to keep it dry and you drier and cooler. It is pull on and off. It is a nice material that looks waffled in some areas, so it looks like it has a bit more texture than a sports bra of spandex or similar material."
4.0,This material is soft. Sizing is smaller than expected. Material is very thin & cheaply made. It will be nice in the hot summer months around the house.
4.0,A piece keeps falling off were the belt goes in there are two not.just one n one falls off
4.0,Definitely cuts the glare but they are a bit too dark for me at night.  Good during the day though.  Not crazy about the yellow tint but they do work on cutting out the glare.
4.0,VERY PRETTY AND SO SOFT.  VERY LIGHT WIEGHT.
4.0,Good stuff. Price is acceptable. And quality is good. I'm satisfied with this. Only cons is light weight.
4.0,It isn’t off the shoulder like in picture. It’s thin kinda see thru. I will wear a tank top under it. Kinda scratchy and has some kind of white threads all over it. I’m 5’6 and curvy I usually wear a medium but bought  The large. It fit perfectly maybe to perfect prbly get another one if they have another color and get an ex large so it will be loose like the pic.
4.0,"fits perfect, the boa feather is smaller than expected and should be relocated to front angling slightly to the rear but other than that I like it.."
4.0,I was looking for something light weight and pet hair resistant. This robe totally fit my needs.
4.0,"Pros-soft,  inexpensive,  cute<br /><br />Cons- a little see through,  a little tight,  and the lace started searching after only a month."
4.0,Socks do not stretch much. Fit ok once you get them on. Otherwise love them when they are on.
4.0,"Unlike others,  after more then 2 years of owning this dress,  I still love it... I ALWAYS get compliments on it... Several friends have tried to buy it.  I keep coming back to find ot when it's going to be available again.  Please bring back!"
4.0,"this was a gift for my son who lives in seattle so he gets plenty of rain on his way to school. he liked it very much. he is an adult, thin and not very tall but it fit just  fine with room for wearing a light jacket underneath."
4.0,Got this for my wife and she has been using it a couple times a week.
4.0,"NIce vest, runs small had to return for larger size.  got a very quick turnaround on replacement."
4.0,Bought for a Babe the Blue Ox costume and it was perfect. Stayed in for hours and looked legit!
4.0,The belt is bright and comfortable--just like the one I ordered in black.
4.0,I thought it was exactly what what my princrss wanted.  I'm pleased.
4.0,"The pros: dark blue looked nice on, not cheap. It was really comfy & has some stretch. Balances sexy shoulders & neckline & slit w a longer length so you’re not flashing anyone. Looks pretty good in pictures. I’m pretty short but it was a good length w shirt stack heels & didn’t drag on floor even when I changed to flat sandals for dancing.<br />Cons: it is a bit thin so u need quality undergarments, also found myself fussing w the neckline a lot- shoulders of dress kept moving & had to be adjusted. You also need to tie it closed really well otherwise it could expose more than u planned. Also The Ties may not be flattering for every figure."
4.0,"It’s a nice band but a little stiff. It may soften over time. It was what I had expected. But, don’t expect to get the extra pieces as pictured. You will get the band along with 2 silver pins. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend it. I didn’t want to spend a lot for a replacement band. I gave 4 stars because the photo is misleading."
4.0,Pants are ok. Zippers on the pockets are hard to operate with big hands.
4.0,Love the bag hated it took forever to find stuff.
4.0,"Cute, but I feel like I'm in a big sack. After putting a little brown belt, it feels more comfortable & looks better."
4.0,I am a little  disappointed the colors of the key rings and chains are silver and the colors of the tassels are gold.This mix of tones makes it look not so cohesive.
4.0,I wear this to spiritual gatherings and it pairs well with a shawl. I had to wear a slip under it because you could still see an outline of underwear. I received many compliments.
4.0,"It was cute & comfy, but the color wore off too quickly."
4.0,"Got this for my teen grandson after he admired his grandfather's more expensive one. Nice price, good quality for that price point. He loves it, wears it often."
4.0,Love it but to little
4.0,"Product arrived on time and fits well. The only thing I don't like is the threading on the back. It can pinch sometimes if you get your skin too close to it while you're screwing it on. Also, be careful to keep these clean, and don't wear them until your ears are completely healed or else putting them in hurts!"
4.0,Es buena no más que se le sale lo brillos es buena calidad cómoda y fresca te para el calor
4.0,Reasonable replacements. They are slightly smaller all around when compared to the factory lenses which makes the frames feel less “sturdy.”  The frames have more wiggle to them now. For the price I have no complaints. Clarity is just as good as the originals.
4.0,I Would order a size smaller but loved the feel of it
4.0,"This is a great bag for the gym, it is lightweight, breathable and durable.  it has a couple of zipper compartments to hold keys, wallet, etc."
4.0,I am required to wear a name badge everyday for work. It is hard if you like to dress up  and yet find a way to wear the badge. I wanted a pretty lanyard. This is very pretty and still does the job! The ability to change the  color of the stone is nice. I would have given a 5 star review if the chain was a little heavier/ stronger..although so far this has been just fine!
4.0,It's exactly what I thought it would be and came on time
4.0,"Runs small, I have this in the army green in a XL and I had to get the 2x to achieve the fit I was looking for.<br /><br />That was this one and I am happy that I went up in a size will probably be getting more in other colors"
4.0,"Guest review from my wife (because it wouldn't fit me well):<br /><br />Soft and comfortable, but lightweight.  Good neutral color, and good value for the money ($30 at time of writing).  Length is good, neck is comfortable, sleeve length good too."
4.0,"Durable - heavy duty, yet light weight"
4.0,"Beautiful crossbody purse that matches with any outfit. Unfortunately, it's a bit bigger than I expected. Also, the straps aren't adjustable so if you are a person with a small torso like me, you are stuck with its length that may or may not reach past your butt. For reference I posted a picture of the brown bag I ALWAYS use because its casual and fits me perfectly in comparison to this new bag. I hope this review was somehow helpful."
4.0,It is beautiful and it reminds me of my Mom she was happy that I choose to add her to my braclett
4.0,Bought for my son. He loved it and feels that it is helping his arthritis!
4.0,I have only had the product for a short time. But so far I have not complaints. Holds money and cards and I love that it comes with the wrist strap! You can also fit your lip gloss and a small mirror in here if needed! iPhone 6s Plus fits in the wallet with ease! For the money spent its worth it!
4.0,Very cute. A little thin but thats ok cuz i will be wearing my Spanx underneath!!
4.0,This underwear is comfortable and I love that it is adjustable for added comfort.
4.0,"These are really cute, but not totally user friendly. It's easy to assemble the crown, but there is no way to attach the string to wear it without adding a hole punch. I ended up running out of time to assemble these, but put little fake votives in them and used them as decoration, which ended up being really cute - but not  what I was hoping for!"
4.0,"I adore this dress. Color is rich, style looks elegant and is made with fine fabric. The fit is perfect too!<br />I have to return it, though, because there is a seam right across the middle of the right upper arm (the left side is smooth and in one piece.) Not only it looks awkward, it also feels uncomfortable on the skin."
4.0,These made me feel like a &#34;Man in Black&#34; and I didn't even have to give up all my memories. They really came in handy for Halloween.
4.0,Perfect..my 7 yr old loves it
4.0,"Super cute, big arms"
4.0,"An affordable, no fuss take on French fashion. The silhouette created by the form of dress is so inherently feminine. And while the material leaves a lot to be desired, pairing the dress with the right accessories, shoes or handbag could make for a really chic look.<br /><br />I gave the dress only four stars because while it hasn't broken yet, the zipper is not easy to use and I feel like it could break at any minute. Also, I ordered the medium and while the midsection is very tight, the top, especially the sleeves, is a little loose. Granted, I just had a baby and everything is a little tight in the midsection but I would expect the top and midsection to be proportionate and it's not, at least on my postpartum body.<br /><br />All-in-all I really like this dress and I'm thinking of ordering it in more colors. ❤️"
4.0,"It is ok, I wish the material was a bit slinker and the neck cut was a bit more graceful"
4.0,Happy with the shirt but had a different fit then we expected. Not cut like a t shirt but we were still happy with this purchase
4.0,"I normally wear a 2X and this was way too big. I am 5'2"" and I will be returning this for a smaller size. It's a cute piece, just runs big."
4.0,Cup size and bra too small.
4.0,Loved the dress just to big
4.0,"Light, really comfortable."
4.0,The dress is very comfortable.  I purchased the green color. The color is not as vibrant as the picture.  My husband did not like the zigzag look on the front of the dress. I will wear this dress around the house mostly.
4.0,"The back right under waist gathers some, but shouldn’t affect my wearing it."
4.0,Lightweight. Best user for weather above 40 degrees.
4.0,"I received it today. It’s beautiful i love it! It is long tho, but I do not mind that. I’m 5’4 and the charm rests right in between my chest. I’ll definitely be back to give a 3-5mo review🤞🏾"
4.0,"Very cute! I bought this for a themed party. It made a cool decoration and photo prop! Some people in the reviews have complained that the umbrella is see through.  I wouldn't buy this to use as an actual parasol to block the sun or rain. But if you want it for a costume, party favor or photo prop perfect!"
4.0,"Shirt is okay, neck is higher and tighter than pictured unfortunately…. Which I do not like"
4.0,"I like this case. It is slim, fully in closed. The only part I think could be improved, is the cover for charge cable and headphones. It is one monolith piece and to plug in my phone, I have to open headphones as well. With that said, I will definitely consider the same case for my next phone."
4.0,"Went into my sunglasses easily. Seem to be just fine. Interestingly enough, I received an email from the manufacturer stating that there was a problem and they would be replaced. Waiting to see what happens."
4.0,Really long. Going to use it as a swimsuit coverup
4.0,"I’m a solid size 16 and bought an XL. If I was less... ahh.. squishy, it would be great! Alas, I need a size up!"
4.0,Super cute & comfy! True to size!
4.0,love this style hat and the fact it embarrasses my kids make it even better.  I like this hat so much I have purchased 3 different colors from this seller. very pleased with product.
4.0,I am 6'2&#34; slender build (42 long suit jacket) and their US Large &#34;3XL&#34; size is a little tight in the chest and the sleeves are a little short. Great jacket otherwise
4.0,"Too long for a person who's 5'5 tall, but soft fabric and looks good."
4.0,Looks just like the picture..
4.0,"Very cute. The flowers are actually bigger than pictured. I thought it would be a little daintier, but it's still cute and pretty nonetheless. Very hippy looking which is a look I like to pull off often. Great to for spring and summer! I'm happy with it."
4.0,"I purchased this as a gift for my other half's eccentric aunt, along with red leather gloves and a cashmere scarf.  I inspected it pretty closely before wrapping it.  The quality was better than I anticipated.  The color was not quite as expected - a bit more orange than I would have thought."
4.0,"Nice shirts at an exceptional price. Not sure what they'll look like once washed, but I won't know because I'm returning them for the next size up. Can't risk them shrinking."
4.0,Nice and stylish. Not so comfortable.
4.0,"Lovely soft stretches the fabric. I'm 5'5&#34;, 75kg, and hour glass shape.  Purchased M, but too small for me by 1-2 sizes. Definitely order 1-2 sizes up as fabric has plenty of stretch and is form fitting. Very flattering for slim waisted ladies. Cannot see through material when stretched, so no need to wear flesh-coloured undergarments. Nicely made."
4.0,"Everything is pretty much perfect. With one exception, the main plate isnt curved it is flat af. That being said its still a great belt. 8 out of 10"
4.0,"Soft cotton blouse, great with jeans."
4.0,"This is a delightful dress by Aisize. The style is retro chic. The fabric is comfortable, a blend of polyester and spandex. The color is eggplant with a wide, black waistband, accented with a bow. It zips in the rear. I ordered up, which I am glad because it seems to run small. It is very slimming and flattering. You can add a jacket and wear it to the office. Overall, a decent dress at an affordable price."
4.0,Dress is nice and comfortable ... runs a little big on the waist ...
4.0,"I love these.  They are a little loose in the waist and I hope the material doesn't stretch out with time but I love the stiffer, stretchier fabric. These Look and feel classy.  (I'm 5'3&#34; and they fit good) Nice length."
4.0,Nice Necklace.
4.0,The dress worked for the occasion but the material is very thick and not too comfortable . The dress was very long but I am short... but this was defiantly a one time use for me.
4.0,Very comfortable and cute. I gave four stars bc a lot of sparkles were off on one side. Not a deal breaker though. I will buy again in blue when back in stock 😊
4.0,This cowl is perfect for staying warm during the winter. It looks nice and is easy to put on.
4.0,Very nice to wear.
4.0,"After reading other reviews, I ordered 1/2 size larger.  The gloves fit my son well.  He was happy with them and liked the fact that he could use his smartphone while wearing them."
4.0,"I suggest ordering 2 sizes up.  Otherwise, very pretty."
4.0,"The only issue I had with this bandeau, is that I got shorted a second bandeau. It is supposed to come in a pack of two for the package I received. Other than that, it was comfortable enough. If you can get someone to help you in the back and sides so you don't have rollover or under."
4.0,"This jumpsuit is super cute, I usually wear size 8 and ordered  a medium, which fits super nice. This is a cute summer outfit. Fabric is more rigid than I thought, but still good quality ."
4.0,It’s as good as I expected . The size was smaller than I expected . Better get one size big than your usual one
4.0,I ordered this necklace for a graduation present. It's very pretty in person but the chain is shorter than in the picture. She loved it anyway and it arrived sooner than expected.
4.0,Comes in handy just a little bit of a tight fit getting your money in. All in all cool product
4.0,"3 months later and they are in great shape! None of the stones have come loose or are missing.<br /><br />These are really fun. I wear them every day and because of the variety, I am able to coordinate which set to wear with whatever outfit I am wearing that day. They are cute enough for every day, or a special occasion. I think the square shape is my favorite.<br /><br />The package arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition. Nothing was missing and nothing was loose. I would definitely buy from this company again.<br /><br />I plan on purchasing a set of these for my niece when she gets her ears pierced in a few months."
4.0,"This dress looks exactly like the photo--well-made and a beautiful bright color, which I love.  On the model, the shape of the dress fits her well.  On me, I felt as though the waist was unflattering because it was too large.  I ended up pairing it with a thin belt to give it more of a shape.  I do love the slits in the sides of the dress, which make it feel fun and young.  This would be great for the beach!"
4.0,"I found these shorts while browsing and I fell in love, I just had to have them. I was a little worried about how they’d fit because there aren’t many reviews on them, but I was pleasantly surprised. They were delivered on time and they look exactly like the photo. They are kind of stretchy but I advise people to size up for a more comfortable fit! I ordered medium (I’m 5’2 130 pounds) and the mediums fit well, but I would’ve gotten a large if I would’ve known that the stretch isn’t that great. Still comfortable and look good though, I’m just worried they might shrink. Anyways I am very happy with my purchase."
4.0,"This is a nice tie, but somewhere on here I saw a reviewer note that this tie is a LITTLE shorter than you think it's going to be, and I agree.  It's listed at 55 inches, which it is, so I knew what I was getting, but if you are tall, which I'm not, this tie would be too short for you.  So, just be aware, if you are over 5' 10&#34;, I wouldn't pull the trigger on this particular tie.  But it's pretty!"
4.0,These are great but i didn’t get any silver pieces. i only received 8/10 pieces.
4.0,Use in shower. They don’t slip.
4.0,"This a cute little purse, about 5 inches by 8 inches. It is convenient for cash and cards, or cosmetics and things, or a cell phone, or whatever. It is mostly cotton, so it has a nice feel.  It is kind of water repellant, so i expect it to be pretty easy to keep clean. The zipper and seams seem durable."
4.0,"Like it very much, they're comfortable, and unexpectedly very lite weight. The color goes with everything. I wish someone can design the piece between the toes a little more comfortable. But love the shoe!!"
4.0,I had planned on purchasing a saber after binging Star Wars Visions-- and ALMOST spent money I would have regretted on a $600 customer saber. I'm glad I didn't and went with this one instead. This is more saber than most will ever need (want.) It does all the cool saber effects and it can indeed be used for duels (mind you I'm fighting a 3 year old.)<br /><br />It's not without it's weaknesses-- The crystal on mine is a little scuffed and rattled until I tightened it. The blade itself is low quality and there's some distortion/warping near the hilt from being whacked against things. Luckily higher quality blades are cheap and readily available. The sound quality is fine for someone like me. Reviews complained about this kind of thing but I don't care about to knock it for that. My main complaint about the sounds profile is Luke's seems to have disappeared. I had it day one and it was my favorite-- But now I can't find it anywhere. I'm considering ripping it apart to find out whether it's worth attempting to flash higher quality effects or maybe wire it for one of those fancy neo pixel blades but I'll probably grow bored of it in a month or more.<br /><br />Anyway-- if you can get it for the ~$100 price point it's more than worth the price.
4.0,Bought a 2x and it fits like a large.
4.0,Pretty but a bit on the heavy side
4.0,The top is great.  The  material and stitching are even.  And it’s a great top to mix and match with.  The bottoms are just ok.  They are a little off with the cut.  The material is fine  and but stitching is weak and the seam shows on the butt
4.0,"I really like the style of these pants and bought them for the plane on my upcoming trip. Although I haven't worn them yet, I only gave them 4 stars as I wish they were a little longer, they are a bit short. I ordered a large and I usually order a size 12 in pants."
4.0,"This product does what it is intended for, however. it does feel a little cheap. Also, I didn't see any size availability  to choose from. It hasn't fallen apart, so that's why the 4 stars."
4.0,"As most of you know I have only in the last few months fell in love with Handbags, Purses, and Totes. The only thing I enjoy more is when all three come in a matching set:) Now, I ordered this particular Tote/Handbag in the Black. I wasn't sure if I would like it. However, it arrived and I just loved it. When this was designed someone put some serious effort into the Organization Components Each Section, Pocket, etc. has a function, what is Amazing about this Bag is that it still Appears Rather Polished, Classy and Trendy. It's been my experience that the more Functional a Handbag is the Less Stylish it can be. But Not This Bag, This Bag Has The Best Of Both Worlds, Sophistication and Extremely Useful. This is an Absolute Fabulous Find. My only regret or with is, I wish is was a little bit larger, but that is a preference of mine and mine only.<br /><br />Would I buy this Large Tote Handbag Again? You Are Damn Straight I Would, it is so Very Functional and Chic that I am Ultimately Very Pleased with My Purchase.<br /><br />Even though I was given a discount for this item, the discount has No Bearing or Impact on my Review Whatsoever. Reviewing is Serious Business to Me as I Use Others' Reviews Prior to Making My Own Purchases. I Depend on Those Reviews. My Reviews are Genuine, Dependable and Sincere. I hope you found this review to be helpful, thank you.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01HBF2PE0 Hynes Victory Womens Nylon Large Tote Handbag (Black)]]"
4.0,"I love my new XL skirt. The material is very soft and I love the way it flows. Very airy and the tiers really add a special touch to it. Will look great with sweaters and boots. I ordered a couple more in different colors and styles. Only thing I did have an issue with, is it’s a tad too long for my 5 foot 4 inches. I am planning to hem it one or two inches, so it will work better for me. Other then that, it’s a great skirt!"
4.0,"The picture makes them look stretchy, flowy, and comfortable. They are comfortable but they don’t stretch like you want them to. They are also kind of high waisted, which is not like the picture shows. Not five stars, but for the price it wasn’t bad"
4.0,"Great dress. I like how unique it looks. I get a lot of compliments when I wear it. It definitely accentuates my curves in the right places.  BUT, the zipper is difficult and gets stuck easily.  I'm not sure if it's my dress, or if other people are having the same issue."
4.0,"The length was perfect for my son. He is between sizes at the moment. 10-12 is too short and 12-14 is too big. I purchased 12-14 so he can grow into them but when he tried them on, the length was perfect. The waist in the other hand was very big. I had to tighten the draw string a lot. He really likes them tho, so I'm happy."
4.0,Will not last
4.0,"I would say this qualifies as fast fashion quality. I don't expect them to last too many more washes before being moved to home only shorts. I worn them a few times and they are already starting to pill.  They are however, super comfortable and I do not regret purchasing them at all."
4.0,Very well made ring. Fits fine.
4.0,Size was just right.
4.0,5'3 135lbs I purchased a small its long and loose on top 34dd
4.0,"Very cute and light weight - a little on the expensive side, but I like them"
4.0,Would rather not have the stark white inside especially if I wear makeup. Also disappointed there is not a silver one. Fine for the money tho.
4.0,"Very nice.  Only problem was I did not look at dimensions before ordering.  It is huge.  If you like big, this is the bag for you. Only used it twice.  I've put it away only because of size.  To much for me to handle.  Nice quality leather, very pretty."
4.0,Love the style and color. Just wish they would block out more sun.
4.0,Great for the price. I love them!!!!!!
4.0,Good quality for the cost. Imprinting was well done.
4.0,I liked the color and the shape
4.0,Looks same as shown very beautiful
4.0,Fits perfectly. I'm 220lbs and I ordered an XL.
4.0,Really warm nice fit holds up well
4.0,Sleeves are a little long but it’s a cute shirt and comfortable.
4.0,Very pretty watch but battery was dead when arrived and I had to buy a new battery.
4.0,"I ordered this dress in a 2x. I'm 5'5 and 256 pounds. The dress is amazing, it hits the right length and feels fabulous. My only issue is that it is sheer. No choice but to wear a cami, unless you have something similar in color."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:96cc49c193cfd7a1f67c69047f52ebe3]] Happy with our umbrella. Easy to install. Love the color. It arrived sooner than expected.<br />Since we wanted it for our wood deck and it was not stable and leaning forward we screwed it to the floor, also we live in a hill near the ocean and it is always very windy so we were going to do it anyways.<br />When installing keep in mind there are 2 lengths of screws, the longer ones are for the legs and the short ones for the rotary piece, the instructions do not specify.<br /><br />**** Today April 14 *** We have to inform that our umbrella simply broke, See pictures for reference. We only used it twice. Also the color started to fade. We noticed that the pieces are that broke inside are plastic.<br /> Now we are sad and disappointed.<br /><br />*** new update June 3, 2021*** talking about great customer service... I was contacted by the Customer Service Manager of Wikiwiki on April 26 with an apology and the offer of getting a new and upgraded umbrella at no cost. We accepted because we believe in second chances. I have uploaded the picture of our new umbrella. We are trusting this time the product will resist our winds and won’t color fade."
4.0,shirt quality is eh. design is great.
4.0,Lower cut than I expected but cute
4.0,"Bought this for my hubby and after he fixed the one piece from the buckle that fell off when he went to the bathroom the first day he wore it, it is great! He loves the way it goes and the fact that he can tighten it to where he needs it. He has the problem that he is usually between holes and this works great!"
4.0,They are very nice but too large.  I'll order a smaller size soon.  Ty
4.0,Pretty Decent.
4.0,Ioved this dress.  It is very thin t-shirt material almost see-through  Ordered a size up and it was to large.
4.0,Really like this shirt only complaint is it feels a little stiff when you wear it not very soft material
4.0,Great color. Great fit.
4.0,The product itself was a great material and the patterns were bright. I have a smaller head then what these are designed for and I was unaware until I tried them on. They concisely fell down and I spent more time trying to keep them up then I care to admit.
4.0,"Too small wanted 18"" chain."
4.0,They don't sit tight to your face and are cheaply made. But they look good and come with soft case and a carrier bag. And a cloth cleaner. For the price they're great thank you.
4.0,"I liked the style of the dress, very pretty only thing is that it was a little more yellow, not so much, but not entirely white, size wise I am 5'1, 120 lbs and a size small was perfect,"
4.0,"It’s a great shirt. Kind of odd material. Sort of feels like 50% swimsuit/moisture wicking material, but it’s not a bad shirt. It’s a little cropped, but over all a nice shirt. Can’t wait to wear it!"
4.0,"very happy with the shipping, only took 4 days from when i ordered it! the ring is adorable but the details are difficult to see since its so small. still satisfied with the product and would order again in future!"
4.0,"I like it so far, about two weeks in. Comfy, looks nice, affordable, and links fairly easy to remove."
4.0,"I wear between 8, 8.5 and 9. It's all about the shoe maker. These boots did not fit me in 8.5 but I think 9 would have, except that they were not available in a 9. I returned them. They are super good looking! Well made, high quality leather, and if they would have fit well I bet they would have been very comfortable. Sad I could not fit in them."
4.0,It's nice.  no issues
4.0,"It’s pretty but it seems as if it would break easily, I have to be careful with it."
4.0,"Fabric is rough, perhaps will soften with washing.  Very attractive pillow fits 18&#34; square pillow form."
4.0,The fabric on this onesie is dreamy; it’s soft and breathable and I love the print. It’s cute a non footed onesie that snaps (zipper onesies are preferable in my book but the snap ones are always so dang cute). This would make a cute gift idea for a new mom/mom to be.
4.0,just as seen in the advertisement
4.0,Tight in the armpit area
4.0,"It’s a basic suit nothing special! Cute still. I’m 5”9 175 and the large is ok, alittle tight. I’ll keep it though."
4.0,"The colors are great especially for Fiesta here in San Antonio (also Pride Month). However, seeing as I live in Texas, the Con of this dress is the material is HOT!!!! Definitely only wearable at night in Texas."
4.0,I like these boots...but wish they had a side zipper instead of a zipper in the back.
4.0,"Flops too much when walking. The straps should insert further towards the heel. Still, have the quality, support and do for of Birkies."
4.0,"I have owned these glasses for several months. I had been looking at Oakley Nanowire 2.0 sunglasses, but I didn't really want to spend $300 on them.  After looking around quite a bit, I discovered these ones from Ray-Ban.  The look isn't exactly the same, but it was close enough for me.  I was especially drawn to the frameless, polarized lenses.<br /><br />Overall I would say they are a good set of sunglasses.  They aren't overly dark nor too light, and the polarized lenses reduce glare.  I definitely like the styling and the way they fit on my head.  Often times glasses will give me a headache after a while because of the way they ""pinch"" my temples, but I haven't noticed these ones doing that.<br /><br />The only drawback to them (and the reason for the reduced star - if I could only knock off a half star, I would) is the nose pieces move around and are noisy when you aren't wearing them.  This might not be a big deal for some, but it give the glasses a ""cheap"" feel/sound.  That was my first impression when I took them out of the box.  Since then, though, I've experienced the positives that I mentioned above.<br /><br />In summary, I would definitely recommend these glasses to a friend who wants the benefits of a better quality set of sunglasses without paying the extreme high prices that you'd find with a pair of Oakleys.  Thanks for reading."
4.0,"The dresses are lovely. I ordered several of them for the summer in different patterns. Do know that the material is thin and there is some slight pilling even after washing them inside out and hanging them to dry. At this price, I don't mind replacing them every so often though I think $15 would be more reasonable given how thin the material is. In the lighter colors, you'll want to wear nude colored undergarments. That said, they are flattering and I would order them again. I'm a women's size 8 and took a Medium."
4.0,Color looked a little faded.
4.0,"So far I like these sandals. They seem sturdy, look great, and fit well. Have not taken them on a hike yet so am not sure how supportive they will be."
4.0,"I just wish it didn't have the stripe on it. Otherwise, cute and functional!"
4.0,My son wore this skiing in Colorado. He said it worked great and kept him warm. I was impressed fabric quality.
4.0,Nice worked
4.0,"I use the bad as an everyday bag.  I go to the gym right after work so I pack my shoes, clothes and my lunch in this bag.  I am more of a backpack person than duffle person so went for this over the OGIO bag.  I've had the bag for a few months and it is great.  I had an issue with shelves sagging, contacted GLO and they sent me new inserts.  I hang the bag in the locker and it fits great.  I have even used it as my carry on bag when I travel and can fit a couple days of clothes in it.  Would highly recommend the bag."
4.0,"Nice, and pretty. It is look great, but it is a more short that I expected."
4.0,Fun for the bday party I had
4.0,"It is a light weight pullover. Like a long sleeve shirt really, super thin. It is comfortable and the sleeves fit great. I sized up one size and glad I did. It is short in the body compared to the sleeves. The sleeves fit as expected but the torso does fit short. The embroidery is great and feels strong."
4.0,"The bust is a bit tighter than I thought it would be, but otherwise the fit is flawless and flattering!!"
4.0,"It is important to check the size link. I ordered the 3x and it fits like a regular large.12-14, which is what I needed."
4.0,"Items look good, fun accent for a costume, it is itchy, switched to a better quality hat, will continue to use it."
4.0,Liked the fit and the overall cut. Wore it to a wedding and got a bunch of compliments. Not a huge fan of the zig-zag edges though. Hence the 4 stars.
4.0,I wear a large and ordered a 3xl and it fits perfectly except the head hole is really small. The botton fell off withen the first hour. But its comfy
4.0,"I bought for a friend's lingerie shower. The color was pretty true to the picture. Everyone was impressed with it and the &#34;hidden&#34; opening. It did fit slightly smaller than expected though. If I needed to buy it again, I'd buy it one size bigger, but the quality of the material seemed nice for the price."
4.0,son danced all night in them!
4.0,Fits me perfectly. Bought it for golf and looking forward to wearing it and see if its airy.
4.0,This skort is perfect for pickleball play. It is aft and comfortable. I purchased green but the real color is more blue that is why I give one less star. I bought one size larger because they don’t have my size.
4.0,"Great cheap sunglasses. Only thing is the lens is VERY dark. Not the best when driving, but great for everything else!"
4.0,Missing leg warmers. Wig isnt that great but glad it came with one
4.0,"Ok, so I ordered the Reef Phantoms on here a while ago, and they were the most comfortable flip-flop I've ever owned to date. I went a half size up from my shoe size; 8.5 to 9, because I read sandals should be a size larger than your shoe.  They fit perfectly to say the least.  Then I had my brother order these for me, and I just received them yesterday.  I got the white and brown because they are just stylin'; what can I say?  What I did not expect is the leather is pure rawhide leather!  Awesome flip-flops, but rough leather on the top of my feet with no socks is pretty uncomfortable.  I think once these are broken in they will end up being my favorite sandals ever.  The leather actually grips my toes and feet a little better than the synthetic material on the Phantoms, so mainly its a matter of getting used to the chafing on the top of my feet (the only reason I gave these four stars instead of five,) and wearing the leather down to a softer texture for more walking comfort.  On top of that, judging by the durability of these (finer stitching, better molding, etc.,) these will probably last 5+ years where I think I'll be lucky to get 3 years out of the Phantoms.  All in all, I love Reef sandals, and as soon as I get used to these, they will be five stars to me."
4.0,The motor has nice detail.  The ring fits great.  The only down side.  I just noticed the letter HD on the sides.  I don't ride a Harley but I still like it
4.0,Clasp of chain kept getting stuck in hammer. Kind of annoying. Ended up breaking the chain and having to purchase a new one. Overall beautiful pendant.
4.0,It's greet dress!
4.0,"The only thing about this product is that it was huge. I expected a medium size handbag and instead I receive a very large size bag. The colors are beautiful. The cats pictured on the bag captured my interest.<br />Anyway, I love this bag and I will be using it this weekday and weekend for 3 overnight stays.<br />I highly recommend this bag and the price was well worth it."
4.0,Gave as a gift. She loves it!
4.0,It was a little small but cute
4.0,"I got a medium to small, I typically wear a size 9 in juniors. I also returned because the front of this showed most of my underwear that I had on underneath it which is not what I want showing when I wear these."
4.0,"These are a soft stretchy knit, very basic but they match everything because of that! They go right above my elbows. (I wear a L/XL in tops for reference) The only complaint I have is that they are a little big at the wrist area, but my wrists are really tiny and I get around this being noticeable by wearing smaller wrist length hand warmers or cuff bracelets over it."
4.0,Mido 5.4 y peso alrededor de 140 libras. Ordené talla L y me quedo perfecto. Simulaba bien mis curvas sin exponer mucho mi abdomen. La caída del hombro es muy bonita y casual. Ya llevo meses usando la blusa y el material es bastante resistente y los colores se mantienen intactos.
4.0,"heel a bit bigger than I would like, but will need to break in to feel comfortable."
4.0,Not at all bad.
4.0,Ordered for my sister while in hospice care. Arrived too late.
4.0,"Fits better than I thought it would for the price.  I wore it for a VERY long summer day.  An afternoon wedding that went into the evening.  It started to slip and be slightly less comfortable as the night went on, but I'm not sure that's a product flaw."
4.0,"This was a purchase for my wife. The built in bra is a plus. Great length and the material is not see through. My wife is blessed with full breasts and had to arrange herself to keep the girls corralled. Overall a fun, flirty beach dress and at a wonderful price point."
4.0,Bought this as a gift.  She was very pleased with it.
4.0,This is really cute but gets turned easily. I really like it!
4.0,"Great skirt. I love the fit and length of this skirt. I'm 5'5&#34; and I could wear this with flat or heels and it looks great. The waistband has no stretch to it, so it fits great standing up, but after too long of sitting I wanted to sneak a little unzip. I love the pocket in the skirt too. Overall great purchase!"
4.0,"Jersey material was stretchy but thin. I do wish the Ruffles extended lower, but as is, these were still super cute. I would recommend."
4.0,It's a cute shirt but the only reason it's 4 stars is because it fits short. I even have a short torso. I was hoping it would have been something I could wear with jeans but it didn't happen. Still a cute shirt though.
4.0,"I like my Access Denied RFID Blocking Women's Nappa wallet,it's a great size, and so far well made. Let's see how well this wallet will hold after many uses.It seems sturdy,and it has a place for everything. I'm very happy with my purchase."
4.0,"This fits as explained in the sizing chart.  (Not american sizing.) This was a cuter on than expected. The main thing was the red straps were basically under my arms.  I cut them off and moved them over.  I haven't swam in this yet so I don't know how it will hold up but for the price paid, I was pleasantly surprised."
4.0,"I Really really love them. They do slide a little, but not to much. I'm 5'9 I thought they would be to short, but they come just right below my knee. They are tight enough with out being to tight. I have to say I would buy another pair."
4.0,"These are a nice shoe but run very small.  I wear a 44 MTB shoe but could go down to a 43 in most weather.  I had to get the size 48 to fit a thicker sock so I would be set in the winter.  Warmth wise I have been very happy with them, they keep me warm down to 10-15F.  The recessed cleat is harder to get in and out of but it is easy to walk in so that's the tradeoff."
4.0,It's impossible to take a photograph of these because the lenses are so mirrored! So I'm really happy. You feel like very sturdy frames and extremely durable. They're a thicker frame in general but very comfortable to wear. Super happy to have them! And I love that they came with a cleaning cloth and case.
4.0,"These pants are so comfy cozy.  The material in the back is really nice also, you can't really tell in the photo how nice they really are.  I'm very happy with this purchase! Thanks."
4.0,"These are very nice! Four necklaces for a great price. The quality is as good as you would get buying costume jewelry at a regular store. It’s not fine jewelry, but it is nice fashion jewelry. Each necklace came wrapped in a cellophane packet, and all four packets were taped together. There was one velvet drawstring pouch if you want to gift it — a nice touch.  I love the animal print tassel necklace the best; the coin layered necklace the least (the coins are kind of lightweight and feel a little flimsy). The other two are right in the middle. I am pleased with my purchase!"
4.0,"I wish the spring had a little more tension, but it worked, and worked well."
4.0,Fits as expected! Lovely dress great for a summer wedding
4.0,So cute! Love them! kinda flimsy and bend easy but still cute
4.0,"This is a true to size blouse, very cute with jeans. It's lightweight and I like the print.  I like it, don't love it, don't know if it's the cut or the fabric, it just doesn't have a wow factor for me."
4.0,My wife wore this for our wedding. Her words &#34;very pretty but a little big for my wrist but it turned out great in our pictures.&#34;
4.0,"Tall girls....you've found your dress! I'm 5'9"" and 145 lbs. I ordered a small, and it still goes all the way to my ankles. I washed it and stretched it even more and now its floor length even with 2 inch heels (wearing heels in picture). This is a beautiful dress. Very flattering and flowy. Love the v neck. I'm pretty flat chested, but it could be a little revealing if you're busty.  The only thing I don't like (hence 4 stars instead of 5) is how low the dress is on the sides! It totally shows your bra....  you couldn't possibly wear this without a bra, but it dips so low under the arms that it shows. Hence the little shawl I put on over it.... kind of annoying. But I'm hoping to sew up the sides a little to fix that."
4.0,Item it runs a bit big.
4.0,I really liked this shirt. I like the navy and yellow. Seems to run small
4.0,I bought a medium. The shoulder area is a bit too big on me. I’m pretty sure I would have fit in a small but I went a size up because the other reviews recommended it. Also its see through so I would recommend wearing a tank top underneath. But overall it's still really cute.
4.0,We bought these for partner twinsy day. Love the fit of the body. The face mask screen print was not centered. Would buy again if this was fixed.
4.0,"The shirt is soft and comfortable. My house was on the cold side when I got home, after putting the shirt on it helped alleviate the chill off my arms. The material felt soft on my skin which is very nice. I was worried that the sleeves would be on the short side, but the were perfect. Came past me wrists so I know after a couple of Washington it would still fit. Now the one very big CON the washing instructions! Hand wash, hang dry, do not wring or dry clean. A little too much work to wash this type of shirt. The washing instructions are the only reason I can't give this item 5⭐️s.<br /><br />*** I did receive this product at a discount for my honest review ***"
4.0,Nice stockings but they run a bit smaller than normal. They tummy control is awesome on these for me though. They are see thru so make sure you put something on over them. The footless style works really well with flip flops and ballet style slippers.
4.0,"I love the colors and design of this scarf, but in spite of being very lightweight, it's still too bulky to wear as an infinity scarf wrapped around my neck twice.  I'm planning to have a seamstress cut it in two to make two beautiful infinity scarves out of it."
4.0,This is a very cute & vanity pin.
4.0,Super cute but runs a bit large
4.0,Cute dress. &#34;Straps&#34; cut in quite far in front. Shows a little more bra fat than I'd like.<br />Green color pretty. Flattering shape.
4.0,"The seller didn't put a size on this listing, so I took a chance. (I needed some new clothes for vacation!) The shirt is very nice, great material, etc. But the size is a little small. It would help to include the size as stated on the label. Measurements would be helpful too."
4.0,They are beautiful and have a side view that attracts attention.<br />I have not had them long enough to wear them a lot due to Covid.<br />I do not go out much!
4.0,"I use this for my vertical labret at work. They function just fine. Nothing fancy, but practical.  The ring can be a pain to put on but it gets easier."
4.0,So I thought wth why not? And now i wear it all the time just because lmao
4.0,"It is excellent, I love it"
4.0,"I ordered medium based on the measurements provided and it worked out in my favor.  Measurements are 36"" chest, 25"" waist Normally I might have gotten a small if there was any stretch to the fabric.  You might consider sizing higher than medium if you measure more than 36"" because it might get too tight and make gaps where the hooks are.  The waist is adjustable by the drawstring.  I only removed a star because it needs more hooks at the bust, but it was simple to sew more on.  Overall I am thrilled with my dress and it seems well made."
4.0,Love it.. I just wish with this price I could get 2 ..
4.0,"A bit baggy through out. Looks as described and pictured. I washed in cold water and allowed it to air dry. Material is good not great and honestly as described, however not soft."
4.0,"I understand the reason for traded marks to protect IP but on a ring it looks cheap and toy like.<br />Having the Flash logo on black ring awesome but the TM is to prominent.<br />Also, the ring size is off by one.<br />You may want to go up one size when ordering."
4.0,"Fits great with a climbing helmet on, keeps ears covered from wind and cool temperatures. Also looks good."
4.0,"When I took this out of the package I though that it was going to be way too short for what I wanted it for but it really is a wonderful tank top. I am not big/huge chested but thanks to taking after my fathers side I am not petite or small boned so this was a little snug in the chest for me and it is very thin and see through, but it fit my purpose of wearing it under a open cardigan."
4.0,"Bought my husband this for a music festival. It was definitely out of his comfort zone, but overall he was pleased with it and comfortable wearing it for 12+ hours. The material is breathable and decent quality. The zipper is long and allows for easy access for restroom usage. Keep in mind it is a tad short (mid thigh) and for the pattern we bought the bottom part is fairly sheer and you will need white or light colored underwear. My husband is 5'9"" and 150lbs for reference. I wouldn't suggest any men taller buy this product unless you're comfortable in short shorts."
4.0,"Love the graphic, the material, the color everything! But I bought a Medium with intentions on it being slightly oversized and it fits just right. Definitely would be afraid to dry it being that it's 100% cotton."
4.0,My son loves this robe. It does run small. He is 8yrs old and I bought him the size that corresponds with his age but he will grow out of it quickly. Nice robe but I would get a size up next purchase.
4.0,Too small for these hands
4.0,I wish it was metal
4.0,I don't normally ware a helmet and i have sense i purchased this one! Its comfortable and easy to adjust. Looks good to!
4.0,Love the fit but the color/pattern is not the same as the photo shown. More navy/blue with different shading.
4.0,"This halter is a nice and stretch piece, but my 3DD's are a bit to large for this, plus there is no support. The color I ordered was purple, and it is very pretty and sexy. I will not be sending this back, because even though it is on the small side....I LIKE IT !! I don't think my man will be complaining at all about my breast support."
4.0,I read all the review's and it said large would fit 160lbs. Well not 7 one. Although these panties are made very well they are like a sz 7.  I prefer 8s. Giving most to daughter. She loves them.
4.0,"Two things. Sizing is off. Order a size up. I’m a medium in everyday sizing and the measurements seemed to match. But no, this medium is more like a small. The fabric and design though are perfect. Great cosplay for Eda.<br /><br />My other comment would be is to order this a month in advance of when you need it. I was given red pants by mistake so after working with the seller (who were very easy to work with), I received the correct costume. But the whole process was 3-4 weeks due to their shipping. So time this out accordingly. Otherwise the product is great!"
4.0,I wear a medium in almost all my tops and I should have ordered a large on this. I could wear it and it looked nice but I was looking for a loose fit like in the picture. Happy with it though.
4.0,There wasn't a category to check.  We purchased two jackets one in Navy and one Black.  Both fit but the black one made in El Salvador was slightly smaller in size then the Navy.  The Navy fit perfectly and was made in Honduras.  Extremely well made products and very warm.
4.0,"Pattern run ended mid chest, looks odd has a straight line on flowers right there in front in the middle."
4.0,Look great on my active 5 year old
4.0,se me rompió una rapidito pero en lo demás todo bien
4.0,The style and feel are very nice. Only reason it got four stars out of five because I wish the back was a little taller. So my heel would stay inside the shoe.
4.0,"Costume is pretty nice.  Hat is my only complaint as it doesn't stay together very well.  Should be all one piece but it is held together with velcro...weird.  What kinda pirate hat is that?!  Otherwise, costume is cool looking and seems fairly well made."
4.0,Nice but writing is small and hard to read.
4.0,"really nice, but it is really short"
4.0,loved it only proble it broke within a week of use.
4.0,They look nice but these are intended for narrow feet.  If you wear Nike's this will likely fit you.
4.0,I loove these earrings so much!! They literally go with everthing.
4.0,"It came with a black burn on the bottom edge of one of the earrings and the particles from it all over the other one. A napkin cleaned up most of it but the burned part is still there. It's not that noticeable but still, I would have preferred it not be stained/damaged on arrival..."
4.0,Like how easy it was to put on
4.0,Great color and material!
4.0,"Great aviator glasses. Very light weight but super comfortable to wear all day. Retro look, very cool! Comes in a nice hard case with micro fibre cleaner. Wold recommend to anyone looking for a retro pair of sunglasses!"
4.0,"Very tight. I’m 5 foot 4 inches, 115 pounds and the medium fits so tight it’s hard to wear anything under it.. order 2 sizes bigger than you normally would."
4.0,"My daughter really loves these shorts. The only reason I gave a 4 star review, is the inside of the pockets seem to be cut short. You can see the inside pocket material poking out the edge of the pocket.  See picture"
4.0,It is very soft. True fit.
4.0,"These rocks arrived on time as advertised. Although a little bit too much money, they are great for painting friendship rocks."
4.0,"This is a very nice visor, I am super happy with it. The only reason I gave it four stars is because it is pretty tight around the head and I’m hoping it will stretch out."
4.0,It is pretty nice kid summer shoes. Worth for the price.
4.0,"These fit well and are very comfortable but are rather frail.  Best hand washed or, as last resort, washed on delicate/cold water in the washing machine.  Do not dry in the clothes drier if that can be avoided."
4.0,"Good quality, balloons as described.  The balloons looked full and colorful.  The only reason I didn't give it a five-star is because $15 is a bit high for three balloons (you have to get your own helium, mind you).  To the seller's credit, this is the best deal online but it is still $15 for 3 balloons.  The Seller shipped in a timely manner, arrived in two days."
4.0,"The fit is too exact. I'm a muscular guy and this fits good, but it's too snug. Once it's it's on you can't get it off! Definitely order a size up, especially to accommodate shrinking after washing. Fabric is kinda stuff."
4.0,"A bit larger than hoped, but a great deal,."
4.0,Mom is enjoying her socks. They are comfortable and wash well. When these wear out I will reorder from the same vendor.
4.0,"This is cute and comfy. I bought my regular pajama size and it fits a little big,which is great for sleeping. I could never wear it out,as some suggest.Maybe a smaller fit would look acceptable to run to the store."
4.0,Graphical and color for those who love DC-3 or C-47 airplane.
4.0,Nice polishing cloth....really removes the tarnish from my silver jewelry without hard work...does get your hands dirty but they are easily washed clean after use....makes my bracelets sparkle!
4.0,Very comfortable and fit is perfect
4.0,I got a large mainly because my boobs are D and the top is pretty small but it works .. I like<br />The bottoms they are a tiny tight on the booty but not bad !
4.0,"I absolutely love the pattern and quality of the shirt, but it fits rather snugly and does not fit like the picture of the buxom girl on the ad.  It is not flowy and I would consider it an athletic fit."
4.0,I usually am a small and this fit great (a little baggy in the chest) great quality i received lots of compliments. I’m 5’7 so i wore it like a tunic instead of a dress
4.0,gave this 4 stars because one of them were broken as you can see in the picture. other than that they were all good and came with 10 as it was supposed to.
4.0,"A little flimsier than expected, still a cute gift for the Chicken keeper."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:dd038038e85c0ee2bf15c5c81272cfab]] Review is for Size 5<br /><br />I am never getting married so I thought I would gift this to myself haha. This is a “created opal”, which means the natural stone was reprocessed in the lab. It says so in the description so they’re not deceiving us. This is better than synthetic/simulated stones. It is a thin band but is durable and well-made. I currently cannot see the price so it’s hard to say if it’s good value or good quality for the price. I assume it’ll be budget-friendly though. From far away it looks expensive. It comes in a velvet gray gift box with a cleaning cloth. The box is top heavy so it tilts back (as shown in my photo). I noticed I have been liking a lot of the jewelry offered by this brand Milacolato. If you’re ever in the market for an affordable jewelry that’s decent quality, I think it’s worth checking out this brand."
4.0,"They're really nice, simple, and look realistic. I do warn you that wearing them for hours on end will create indents on the inside of your bottom lip, so I wouldn't wear them for more than a few hours at a time. Beside that they work perfectly."
4.0,Nice large tags. Very visible.
4.0,Super cute! The neckline is higher than pictured
4.0,It's a bit small in areas and not the areas it should be small in. But it does the job after you get it laced correctly in the back. I needed an extra human to assist. If you are big busted beware that this thing will squash you and you may not be able to get key buttons fastened no matter how loose the lacing is in back. My boobs are a 38 D cup and they were shoved up some and flattened. It also makes you have super straight posture and shoves everything up if you are a larger girl like myself. It works great though. But should they ever offer one I'd prefer one that came up just as far on the back but without the bust portion so I don't get so rearranged.
4.0,"TURNS HEADS IN THE AIRPORT, CAN'T FIT IN SOME OVERHEAD SPACES"
4.0,Little boy loves these!
4.0,A gift for my son. He graduated from UAF
4.0,The charm is really good quality. The cord is thin and broke in minutes. We figured out another way to make it back into a necklace and it worked great as an accessory for a Link costume.
4.0,A Little big but gets the job done.
4.0,. Nothing fancy. Still Cute...
4.0,Bigger than they look. Metal petal earrings. Got squished in purse.<br /><br />Love these and will buy another.
4.0,Very pleased. Thanx 😂
4.0,Beautiful but pendant is much smaller than expected!
4.0,The only problem is the black pair rubbed off a bit on my hands because I wore them once before washing them. Washing them solved the problem.
4.0,"Well made boot for the money but don't expect a comfortable fit out the box, they will take a little breaking in. I've had mine for about a week now and they've started to soften up especially after I started applying boot grease on the quarters at night."
4.0,Material was a bit thinner than I expected. But nice all the same.
4.0,"Fits nicely, true to size. Good quality. I will buy additional colors!"
4.0,"I bought these shorts and to be honest it's my first pair that I've ever bought!  I am currently using them for spinning class but later plan on using them on my bike in the summer!  The only thing I find frustrating about the shorts is that the croch doesn't seem to fit me very well.  It tends to be loose which then catches at times on the seat of my bike when I'm doing standing, sit backs etc.  The only thing I could think of that may help is ordering a smaller size which means the sizes don't run completely true.  Overall though I am happy with the product."
4.0,"Finally I have the right size! No matter what brand I’ve tried (4) I finally found out I no longer wear [7.5/med 7-8]...slipper-wise. I took the dive and Now know I fit [6/small 5-6]. Never mind my foot is a perfect 7.5/B. These are nice, warm & comfy. It’s just that the memory foam isn’t remembering & after 2 days are flat. For the price-they’re comfy & they fit!"
4.0,I wanted a navy but it’s more bluish gray. Didn’t go with the sleeveless dress I wanted it for.
4.0,3x is XL USA
4.0,"I really wanted to like these but the material was just too shiny and seemed like it would easily snag. Comfy, but I've returned because I didn't like the shine."
4.0,"This dress was true to the color.the fabric is very nice,soft and durable. It makes a great dress for the winter. My husband ordered it from my wish list Erich was a pretty painless way to buy.the item came in the time expected,albeit on the latter end of Rhode time frame. It's a truly luxurious feel and we'll made."
4.0,"These look really nice in my ears, but I ordered 14g and these are noticeably smaller than my other 14g earrings. They get a bit wider by the area that widens out for the design, but not much. Also, as soon as I popped the bead out to put this in my ear the black chipped off the metal where the bead pops in. Once I put it in my ear it wasn't noticeable, so they still look very nice, but I just wish they matched the size of my other 14g rings!<br />These came with a card that shows the sizes down the side and compared to that card the size doesn't match the 14 or the 16, it's in between (but closer to the 14), so maybe this was just a machining error or something."
4.0,grandma loved it
4.0,Shoes fit pretty good.
4.0,I like the way they look!  They do have an odd chemical odor though.
4.0,I like the quality of the skirt and its worth buying it for a good price. Its a cute skirt.
4.0,"When you first put it on, you immediately notice how much more comfortable it is than the stock band. The only issue I have had so far is that it comes off easier. Multiples times I have woken up to find it under my pillow. I can imagine that since this band is made of a softer silicon, that it probably won't last as long as the stock band, but the comfort is definitely worth it."
4.0,"I adore this swim suit. Got it on time, brand new, but even with the measurement guide it's still a little snug in the important places."
4.0,"Love it cute, But smaller than I thought but still like it"
4.0,"Almost returned this because the front closure was hard to figure out. Once I mastered it, though, it was a great buy. Sturdy and stylish, stays in place, excellent support. Victoria's Secret tends to cost more, but the quality of their sports bras makes up for the cost."
4.0,"Good deal, nice shading."
4.0,"I love the colors. I bought it as a swimming suit and it fit a tad loose but I had gone up a size. So it fits true to size. However, it has no cups for support in the bosom but a sport bra will fix that."
4.0,"This dress fit amazing and felt beautiful in it! Fit perfectly around my curves! I’m 5’8 and #19, bought a size L."
4.0,"This isn't cherry red! Think more 'cherry stain on wood' rather than 'bright cherry red,' which is what I wanted. Otherwise I love it, it's compact, it's sturdy, it holds everything I need it to. I did rip a dollar in half once trying to get it out of the center because the wallet is so small, so now I fold my cash in quarters instead of half, so it gets a bit thicker. Other than that I would certainly buy more of these if I needed another one for some reason."
4.0,Wow.  Extremely large.  Will wear with a tie.
4.0,"It is a very stretchy and thin fabric hoodie, so might wanna wear an undershirt if it is a cold day. The pattern did as advertised changes color in the sun and returns to white in the house. I took a pic of it in the sun. My niece liked it more than me so she'll probably end up with it I wore it today, it's comfortable the image on it all looks good I gave it 4 stars because of how thin it was. (some people my like that though) I thought it would be little warmer but oh well. My niece loved it I think it will look better on her anyways. It will probably swallow her because I got it for myself I just didn't like it for myself.<br /><br />Take care, I hope my review helps."
4.0,Nice material but too long.
4.0,"would serve great as a quicky slim wallet for those occasions when you don't want to lug your monster wallet... you get what you pay for, regarding feel and construction... probably wouldn't last a long time... here's the one i purchased and am using on a daily basis instead:  http://www.amazon.com/Osgoode-Marley-Cashmere-Gusseted-Wallet/dp/B000VS88IW (again, you get what you pay for)."
4.0,"I would have given the glasses another star, but they sit on my cheeks and then they make a mark on my face when you take them off.  The glasses are well made and feel very sturdy.  I have just been diagnosed with Macular Degeneration and I wanted wrap around sunglasses for our vacation to the beach."
4.0,Product looks as pictured. True to size.
4.0,Super cute dress! Fit as expected.
4.0,"They aren't super black like the photo, they have a denim material and they look off black. They are very comfortable however and when I wear them and look down they look black so I'm okay with it. Look forward to wearing these!"
4.0,"Good value for the money, but no front zipper"
4.0,Great little bag super cute made nice great price
4.0,Ordered size Small and I usually wear a Small or sometimes Medium. Based on reviews I went with Small which fit great. Got a lot of compliments on the dress. BUT the red dye bled into the black n white striped pattern :( that is my only issue with this dress
4.0,[[VIDEOID:dcb2cc5a7573ea9bef35aa24de2426b6]] Some look like care bears others just look like bears
4.0,"I bought these for my wife since her old pair finally gave out after 4 years.  We were looking for them in stores but never finding any.  I have always been a bit skeptical about clothes/shoe buying online, but I thought this would be different.  I knew exactly what size and style I wanted to replace the older ones.  True enough my wife never noticed the difference, true to size and form.  They are her go to yoga shoes and she loves them.  Great product at a reasonable price."
4.0,"A little bit large, so you could order a size down if you’re a true size normally. It’s way more see-through than expected, so HAVE to wear another solid layer underneath. Very light-weight & comfortable."
4.0,This one has a little more weight than the blue evil eye version.  I would buy this again.  The price is painless for cute plastic jewelry.
4.0,"I may have to return this, because the ""olive"" color on the item with pockets is - as shown, tbh - more of an ""evergreen"" color. The other olive hoodie looks like a true olive. It's a subtle difference, but I just don't wear that color well. The product itself is just what I wanted: lightweight, flowy, and creates a nice slender line. I'm 6'-0"" 190 lbs and the XL was just right for me."
4.0,"Cute shirt, but is see-through and will have to wear an undershirt."
4.0,"Beautiful coat, decent fabric, very warm. Had read reviews about the belt being crappy - it is, and one of the belt loops was off before I had finished my first wear. I am a seamstress, however, and had planned modifications before the coat ever arrived. I took off all the remaining belt loops and threw them and the belt in my scrap bin in case they might be useful for future projects. Am now using a standard kilt pin to close coat. Looks AMAZING and am getting tons of compliments. Very good bargain, and if the coat eventually falls apart, I will just use the pieces as a pattern to make another. All in all a good use of my money."
4.0,"Looks great, little large but comfortable and no issues with wearing it."
4.0,Fits good just a little hard to get on
4.0,"This band is quite comfortable, and exactly what I was looking for. But before you buy it, note that its length is small. I'm a guy with what's probably a slightly small wrist, and it barely fits me - if you're a beefy guy, go for a larger size.<br /><br />Just a note, the little peg that fits through the center holes to secure the band is a pretty tight fit, tighter than other similar bands I've seen before. This is probably a good thing, I imagine that makes it harder to loose - although this kind of band would be pretty hard to lose in the first place."
4.0,"Bought these earrings for a friend who is a huge Sailor Moon fan.  As noted by other buyers, there is a black writing on the back of the yellow moons, but that can easily be removed with nail polish.  They are a little heavy, the moons are metal coated in paint.  Regardless, I think my friend will love them.  Perhaps not worth $13, given the material.  But, way better than the $29 plastic ones I've seen from a different Amazon seller."
4.0,"This is a nice dress.  I had actually ordered it to be a shirt.  I'm 5'11 so it would have worked well for what I intended.  It is well stitched, no lose threads or anything.  The only problem I have with it is that it is too small in the bust for me.  I wear a 40C and the bust on this just flattened my girls.  Otherwise it seemed like a good dress.  Disclosure! I was allowed to review this product at a  discount in return for my honest opinion.  All opinions expressed in this review are my own and the rating given is a reflection based off of my personal interaction with the product.  I keep my reviews fair as I also make my purchasing decisions based off of other's reviews as well and would hate to be led wrong."
4.0,"Just got these in the mail today. They aren't the best quality but they are good for the price. They look great, and look nice under a t-shirt. However, they seem like they will require a little bit of breaking in. The straps are a simple elastic band that chafes a little bit, but as I said will probably ease up after some use. The fit was as expected."
4.0,Wears well. I wish it was made to have an extra link because the size of the band is small and larger people can't wear it.
4.0,"Right size in almost every place except the neck.  It must be for a 15-16 inch neck.  I ordered a large, and while everything else was good, I could not close the tip button.  I have a 17.5 inch neck"
4.0,It certainly is a different kind/style of Tank Top-Muscle Rib A-shirt. Bought L for a man who usually wears L. Gave 4 because they are longer than expected. I’m sure the length will be ok for someone taller than 6 feet.
4.0,"I ordered these March 6, 2016 and got them two days later. Although the lenses are a bit circle-y and non-heart looking (hence why I only gave the product four stars), but the color is fantastic and they look incredible!"
4.0,Beautiful dress and fit my 7 year old well! The only issue was that the flower was completely smashed and so I took the flower off-that was why I gave it 4 stars. Otherwise the dress was perfect and I'll put a flower in my daughters hair instead since she can't have it on the dress.
4.0,"Very pretty and flattering dress. Looks just like the picture, and the material is very nice and soft."
4.0,I love this dress. The shape is flattering; this is so comfortable. You can extend the wearing into fall by adding leggings & a cardigan on cooler nights. The colors are bright - compliments my summer tan well.It have shallow pockets would have preferred a little more depth.
4.0,Nice color not a fan of the material  but in all not bad
4.0,"Perfectly matched my peacock dress. A tad bit larger than I excepted in size, but for the price I paid I could not complain."
4.0,"The main complaint / con if you will be the presentation box on this. The whole thing, and the presentation box would be your presented gift for them to open and find what's inside. The presentation gift box came looking rather cheap like it had too much glue making it (like water damage look). But it was usable still, but you have to set it all up. I'm sure this is to prevent tangles, scratches to the presentation box display card.<br /><br />The seller should put the presentation box and the jewelry in an overpack bag to place the barcode label on it. This one was the daughter box, and the barcode goes off the ad title and said wife.  It was a o'boy moment before getting it open and flipping the card. I do wish the presentation box and card where maybe an inch or two taller in portrait layout instead of a small square box. This would make the gift look bigger and bold, and it would also give those with grip problems an easier hold to open it. Overall, the actual jewelry is very pretty. The package that is part of the presentation needs to at least have some quality control with it.<br /><br />I would recommend this to others, but caution around holidays as you want bigger and bolder. This is that excellent gift that says, ""I was thinking about you today, all day,"" as you receive your warm happy hug in return."
4.0,Very nicely made and pretty romper!
4.0,"Look warm and useful, but way to BIG for a woman.."
4.0,"I loved the way this dress fit! I bought a medium, I am roughlt 5' 8 and 160lb. It hugged me and did not run too short on length. It reached about the middle of my quads. My only complaint about the dress is that the colored part on the chest (the red part) was so overwhelmingly large, that it distracts you from the rest of the dress. I often have this problem because I am vary large chested, but I felt they tried to accommodate this by making the red accent larger than it should be. It could also just be my build. For reference, I am a 32GG in UK size.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good quality<br />Comfortable<br />Hugs, but not too tight<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not recommended for large busts"
4.0,This is a very cute workout set. The quality is good too. It is a thick material. I would say it is not for high impact workouts. The bra comes with padding but is not super supportive.
4.0,Looks sweet but you can really feel the stitching on the chest. It is kind of see through as well so if you are going to get this shirt i reccomend getting or using undershirts with it for comfort.
4.0,The light up lights for the gift is inside the box and have to open up the gift in order to set up lights in gift box
4.0,Should have gotten polarized.
4.0,The dress looked beautiful on my daughter.
4.0,Beautiful soft Fall colors.  I wore it over a tan sweater!
4.0,Pleased with this dress very comfortable!
4.0,The hat can I ordered is pretty but it does not look nothing like the picture shows show picture shows a lot more detail more threading and the other one comes with less but my husband still loves it
4.0,"This little case is just what I was looking for. It is just a bit deeper then I thought it would be, but I don't mind because it holds everything I need it to hold. Looks like quality that will last."
4.0,The top is a little Meh and the bottoms are pretty cute; Worth the money. I got a Medium and I’m 5’2” 115lbs.
4.0,"after using this for a few months, the inside liner came off, unable to re-glue, still using it though. It matches all the other stuff in my purse !!"
4.0,Bought these for my teenage daughter who wore them all day as soon as they came. She loves them!
4.0,"Lanyard works great, kind of elastic so it has a bit of a bungee to it that can get caught if you sit on it or catch it on something, but holds the keys well, only qualm i have is that it's a bit long for keeping keys in your pocket"
4.0,Product fit needs
4.0,Worked very well for my needs.  It was a little large but still could fit into my front pocket
