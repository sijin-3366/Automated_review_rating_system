3.0,Arrived broken. Easy to fix
3.0,"I loved this and put it in for my wedding, turned out great.<br />Didn't swap it out and after 9 months, I started having a green discharge coming from my ear. The same color you'd see on cheap nickle that's been coated in silver.<br />Took it out today after seeing it for a few weeks, sure enough, there's a nickle color where it sat in my ear.<br /><br />Changed it back to the one the piercer put in my ear for now which is surgical steel."
3.0,"I ordered the white one as shown, but got a darker stone instead, which I did not like as well.  It was a gift and I had no time to get another, so I presented it.  The recipient seemed happy;  I hope she was."
3.0,Fit a little tight but it was see through.
3.0,Needs to be more durable
3.0,"This jacket, despite purchasing a size up and referencing the size chart is still too small in the shoulders.  Beautiful color and lovely look but if you have full or muscular arms you want to buy another size up in my opinion."
3.0,I really like the design but the coating of the ring peeled off and hurt my skin the first day of use.
3.0,I ordered a size larger but they were too small I re-ordered 2 sizes larger and they were ok. I only gave 3 stars due to the hassle of return and reorder plus I paid extra for expedited shipping and they were still too small (the first time). The newer ones/larger size won't last a very long time.
3.0,Strap Velcro isn't long enough. I added Velcro but now the strap hits the ground.
3.0,As cute as these were I had to return them upon receiving them as they are extremely heavy. definitely going to have to spend a little extra for some actual lightweight sneakers
3.0,I bought these leggings thinking that they would be the same fit as another pair of leggings from the same &#34;Viv&#34; collection. They turned out to be much smaller and too small for me. They were by another company.
3.0,The size was smaller than expected.  Ordered rings in the same size and this was much smaller
3.0,They were very tight at first. I've ALWAYS worn this size. Not sure why they are so tight but they hurt my feet after a long day.
3.0,"Super cute glasses. I took various blue light blocking tests, and saw lessening in blue light but wouldn’t say that they work as completely as a more high end pair of glasses. I noticed that in a harsh desk/computer work environment they were definitely a helpful improvement in blue light, but weren’t as noticeably helpful outside of work. If you're wanting to try blue light blocking glasses without the steep price tag, give these a try and see what you think!"
3.0,Very fashion forward.
3.0,The set did not come with laces. That was disappointing.
3.0,They look really great but are a bit uncomfortable.
3.0,hard to see the Merry Christmas
3.0,"According to the product picture, you can see the design while wearing it. When I actually received the product the scale of the design was much larger and it just looks like a blue/green blob across my face. :D Still a cool design, just wish you could see it while wearing it."
3.0,Just ok  nothing special.
3.0,Nice quality. Too short also.
3.0,my 16 year old granddaughter coud not wear it...she would have to literally be flat chested and she is not a big girl
3.0,"According to the measurements it should have fit but was to big. Other then that,<br />I was please with  the quality of the dress."
3.0,"The shorts are comfortable, but I hate this top. It is so unflattering. You can see everything through it. I feel like I have to wear a bra with these pjs. I love the shorts though."
3.0,"Like the idea behind the product and am using the wallet. However, it's larger than I would prefer. Likely, to opt for a smaller wallet."
3.0,Wonderful for everyday comfort/ lazy days.
3.0,I requested 2 pairs of Mia Sarin earrings ones they were round and the 2nd pair oval form the first time that I purchase this earrings I love them but now number one her name is not written in the bags and both are oval earrings a bit disappointed really
3.0,"Pretty, but I was hoping for beautiful."
3.0,A little larger fit and didn’t expect the front part to be a flap you pull up and it constantly fell down
3.0,These were way too small but I’m loosing weight so I might keep them. They are not an xl according to my other leggings
3.0,The size runs to the T. I’m 5’2 130lb I order a LG I’m very busty D and it show lots of clevage. I gave it a 3 star because the bottons they need more down the bottom. But I love it good quality
3.0,Fits really weird in the hips. Not loops for the belt to go through so it’s always sliding down.
3.0,"I ordered the camo print (love!), but the shirt took so long to arrive that I actually forgot I had even ordered it (like 4+ weeks). I am 5'6"" and 122 pounds for reference here. I ordered a small knowing it wasn't supposed to be super fitted, but the shirt is really really really large on me. I will probably keep it, but I will just wear it around the house instead of out, like I was planning too. I'm swimming in it!"
3.0,Quality is not so great.
3.0,This sweater fit tts and was very cute but the chemical smell was so strong that I doubt it would go away with washing. Returned.
3.0,"I'm 5.6 , 149 pounds"
3.0,"It kept my arm dry in the shower but was much tighter than others I've purchased in the past. The compression marks were quite deep. Also, the ""mitten"" end is not only useless for a hand, it totally prevents you from using your hand at all."
3.0,Smaller or tighter knit than the other colors. White and black were nice and comfy and stretchy but the grey with black collar was tighter and doesn't pull down like the other ones.
3.0,"I suppose you get what you pay for.  The apron appears to be well made for the price and is attractive.  Unfortunately, it had a terrible, strong, sulfuric chemical odor to it.  Knowing it was new, I made a point to wash it on its own, as to not bleed into other clothes.  Thank goodness I did because it left what looked like black ink in the drum of the washer and still had an odor.  I soaked for about 6 hours in an OxiClean mixture which removed most of the smell, but the bleeding of color remains.  Lesson learned - the money saved wasn't worth the effort after arrival."
3.0,"I really like this company. The tunnels and plugs I've purchased have always looked great. However, this pair I just purchased came with one of the tunnels &#34;disassembled&#34;. The dangly part was not attached to the main part, and it was just set in the box next to it. I ended up reattaching it myself, but I'm a little annoyed that I had to."
3.0,They get the job done. But upon opening 2/3 had small holes in the fabric. Nothing bad but they’re there and seeing that upon opening was sad. Still usable so oh well.
3.0,Size and color are off.  My daughter wears a small but the small top was too small and looked odd.  Ordered blue but the suit was a gray color.  Looks good quality though.
3.0,Ok....does not look the picture.  Looks better in the picture than in person.
3.0,"Not nearly as big as pictured. I bought this bag because I no longer needed a diaper bag, but I still need room in my purse for a few diapers and a small pack of wipes, but this bag is no bigger than my regular shoulder bag. The bag is cute, it has a bunch of pockets inside, the zipper is lower than I expected, so that reduces the usable space in the bag. I am keeping it, I did have to air it out as it did smell, but I think once my toddler is potty trained then I'll use it as my regular purse."
3.0,It was ok. Kinda cool .
3.0,I’ve had other Bluetooth beanies but wanted a larger one that I could tuck my long hair up into. It fits great and is warm. Also has long battery life. This is ok for podcasts but can’t imagine listening to music on it. Any bass creates a buzz in the audio. Might just be the one I got. Decided to keep it since I just listen to podcasts and audio books during walks
3.0,"I am 5""2 and 110lbs, I ordered size S.  It was good length, however it didn't stretch too much.<br />I really love the color and pattern.  I wish it stretches better."
3.0,Very cute style and print but disappointed in the sizing.
3.0,"Look great at first, but once they are pulled up, most of the design is non recognizable.  Not long enough for a child's soccer sock."
3.0,"It wasn't the greatest, but it worked for the costume. 2 downfalls for me were; it was hard to get the tail to look right since it is sewn together with a crook in it, and the pink &#34;hair&#34; around the ears looked very matted."
3.0,I liked this product but was disappointed when a hole appeared in them after one washing.
3.0,"it's was pretty but too tight around my chest.  I'm a 38 triple D and got the largest size they offered, but when I put it on it looked like I only had one huge boob across my chest.  gave it to a friend because it would cost more in time and money to return it."
3.0,I got this dress in a small size after reading other reviews. I saw where someone said the dress was a little snug in her ribcage and that she considered herself to have a bigger ribcage than most. But sadly it was too small for my ribcage. Great fabric and quality though! And beautiful dress too!
3.0,Cute but way to small !!! I'm 5'9 & 215 lbs !!<br />Looks exactly like the pic and seems pretty sturdily made! It's pretty! I guess I need a diet before summer! I'm just disappointed bcuz I have a carabean cruise coming up in dec ...& I guess it's  what I get for ordering a swim suit online!! Duhhhh bad idea! Dummy me for thinking I might be able to find anything cute for a plus size... I'm not fat but I'm also not skinny I'm TALL W BIG CHEST AND SOME CURVES! I don't want to wear a grandma looking swim suit for old ladies or tank n shorts swimming!  Time for ppl to get REAL w their sizes!!! Make CUTE STUFF FOR PLUS SIZE GIRLS THAT STDNT DYSTVED TO DEATH WALKING SKELETONS!
3.0,"Good product, took forever to arrive"
3.0,"Usually a large but got an extra large and it fit, it’s super cute but fits more like lingerie as my butt completely  hung out the bottom"
3.0,"Couldn't get the ball off of one, even with a wrench and my father's help. The other is nice though."
3.0,They shrink when you wash them
3.0,I wear a 9.5/10 or 40.5/41. I ordered a 43. They are a little large but work ok for my wide feet. Next time i would order a 42.
3.0,Had to get a<br />Larger size
3.0,My boyfriend bought me this ring and I LOVE it soooo much. But within two days it's already started turning my finger green :( I am so disappointed.
3.0,Good quality! The shorts were way to big but the top fit perfectly and is really cute on!
3.0,"So many things to say about this delightful little sack with shoulder straps. Going to try to be as helpful as possible for anyone who stumbles upon this. Bare in mind I bought this with the intention of lounging around my house with my kids and sleep in, which I think it’s perfect for. I personally wouldn’t recommend it as anything else. But there are some things I’d like to mention:<br />1. It fit just about as expected. I’m a 14/16 depending on the brand and I ordered a large bc the one other reviewer said it runs big. Fits fine, quite comfortable actually.  The straps are adjustable, which is nice bc if I couldn’t loosen them the seem would be right up my ace and I’m 5’4”. So if you’re a tall person, I’d hard pass on this one unless the ultimate wedgie is something you’re into.<br />2. Being 100% cotton, the fabric is nice and light. I can’t imagine it ever not being wrinkly though, which I can live with. There is a flaw in the fabric of the one I got (I included a pic). Time will tell how that wears, but you’re not paying for quality here so I recommend getting one of the cheaper colors.<br /><br />Overall, I’m happy with my purchase and if they went down to about $10 I might consider even getting another color. Can’t wait to see my husbands reaction though, I expect a very confused expression and he might even be speechless."
3.0,"I bought this in a medium and the top didn't fit it was a bit too slack I usually wear 32D bra and the top wasn't tight enough for a bikini, I will be giving it to my cousin."
3.0,Not bad but not the best. Good for summer. Thin and see through
3.0,"I didn’t pay attention when ordering but this label runs really small in size, But I really like the dress and I’m hoping it inspires me to lose weight"
3.0,Wrinkles easy
3.0,The sizing seems ok but these dont stay in place. The edges roll and bunch up. I didnt return them but will never wear.
3.0,They are super cute and the designs are great. They are cheaply made tho but I mean for the price you get their good. The only thing is that me personally I would wear them in the shower and they would start to rust and turn my toe green. But if you wear them every once in awhile they are good. Also I was wearing one and it just snapped in half.
3.0,The dimensions were a tad smaller than the previous ones I had ordered. The materials are less impressive.
3.0,"Not enough waistline... too small. The tights fit fine but the top portion didn't even cover my butt. Felt like it was falling down the whole time I wore them. Unfortunately, the crotch ripped the 1st day. Definitely for tiny women & juniors."
3.0,Don't drop your phone. No drop protection but convienent wallet.
3.0,"The fabric has an unpleasant drape and somewhat clammy feel to it, clingy, uncomfortable. Otherwise as advertised."
3.0,Well basically they are nice looking and fit over my old metal frame glasses. They do not fit my present glasses that are larger plastic frames.  So I can use them with the old glasses. I really thought with the measurements in the comments that they should have fit the new ones.
3.0,V-neck way too big
3.0,El color no es tan intenso como en la fotografía
3.0,For way too big for a small and the material was extremely thin. I returned it for a refund and looked for an XS but they don’t make one.
3.0,Cute but a little see through and not as soft as I'd hoped
3.0,"Fabric is not soft at all... Very stiff and unflattering... Pockets are too high to ever use them... Pattern is cute though... It’s what you should expect for $10, but we hope for more..."
3.0,"Nice quality for the price , run small."
3.0,"The material is cheap, but the dress is nice."
3.0,they look a lot larger than what they realy are. they are small and dont even have screw on backs so they are easy to lose.
3.0,"It did not fit snuggly on my 12 year old son, so I figured I'd just take it. It's doesn't fit me well either. It's just...floppy ...and shifts around, especially with stiff in it.<br />Also, it's ""Splash resistant"" at best."
3.0,Cheap material quality of the sitiching is not present. Cute style but looks very cheap. I returned this item
3.0,It'll be fine after I drop a few bags of groceries.
3.0,"Very cute, but it is short..."
3.0,Tarnished super fast and loses shape after putting it in and taking it out.
3.0,"It is OK , nothing wrong with product but design and craft look not much attractive like the real military ."
3.0,Nice but bulky!
3.0,"The earrings are cute but, I haven’t worn them yet. I’m sure to receive compliments. The color is bright and bold and can be worn with many different outfits."
3.0,Belt holes wore out and the rivets fell right to the floor after a couple months of sporadic use.
3.0,The straight ones fall out if you rub your nose the wrong way.
3.0,The snoopys are upside down
3.0,So I love the lenses  but the frames are huge! Was not expecting them to be so big!
3.0,Didn't look like they were the right size but fit daughter perfect
3.0,Did not like anything about this garment.
3.0,"Perfect length, sleeves are dolman type, taper to wrist. This T-shirt fabric is good quality, not light and flimsy.  The body is very loose, you could wear a parka under it.  I wouldn't wear it around town, this is more of a lounging gown."
3.0,"This is NOT a sports bra as advertised. This is a bathing suit top. From the material and padding to the clasp, classifies it as so.<br />It is cute, yes. It feels a little uncomfortable and silly to wear as a bra since it's not."
3.0,My 4&1/2year old loves loves those shoes.  The only thing is we are having problems with some side not coming on even when charged.  I can't send it back because he will have a fit.  We will keep trying to charge it to see if there are any changes.
3.0,"I bought these because I like tabi socks & wanted some quality ones. I won't deny that they're quality socks & the print is nice. They fit perfectly, running a little small compared to American socks, which the buyer should expect. However, they're thin, like the cheap tabi socks you get out of martial arts or costume catalogues. They feel like rough dress socks & shouldn't be expected to be warm. If you like slick, thin dress socks, these are great. I like soft, warm socks so this isn't something I'll order again."
3.0,"I ordered these for work. The coverage is what I was looking for, but the lens itself had a dizzying warp to it? They look crystal clear but when I put them on, everything goes wonky. Maybe I got a lemon? I’ll keep them for brief stints of home improvement but I couldn’t take it for work, I had to take them off after 30 minutes."
3.0,"When this swimsuit arrived I was so excited. I really love the look and colors. The black online on the blue suit is perfect, in my opinion.  I ordered a small (size 4-6) since most of my clothing is a size 4 or small or x-small.  The top fits me perfectly, it's nice that it has the straps that can be added or removed. They don't offer a lot of support, but I imagine that they would keep it from falling off if you were actively swimming or diving into the water.  The bottoms on the other hand are WAY too tiny. I honestly can't guess what size it would fit. Maybe a size 0? I included 2 photos. One photo is the bottoms from this size small over a pair of bottoms from a size Xsmall that I wear occasionally. You can see that these small are considerably smaller than a pair of Xsmall swim bottoms.  Since the top and bottom come as a pair it may be difficult to find the perfect size unless you are a larger size on top and smaller on the bottom.  It is unfortunate because I was excited to wear this suit this summer.<br />While I received this product at a discount, all opinions in this review are my own."
3.0,"Decently made, but the head hole is small. And since it's not made of straw, you can't reshape it. Good for costumes but not everyday use"
3.0,"I am a small person at 4'10 and 85 pounds, but the size chart said that a small would fit me just fine. Now I expected it would be a bit loose on me and that is cool. I work from home so comfort is key. The material is nice and the dress is well made, but it is huge on me. Like a moo moo on Honey boo boo big. As my momma would say, it swallows me whole. It is not a good dress for sexy time or even to wear in public, but I kept it anyway cause it is real darn comfy and I do like the pattern and feel of the material. And if I really wanted to, it would be easy enough to alter to fit perfectly.  I wouldn't buy another one, but I'm also not returning it."
3.0,I looked like Moira from when she was in The Crows.
3.0,The size is right but they are too big for a woman's hand but for the price they work.
3.0,The bust is small and the sleeves are very tight!
3.0,loved them but one broke after a month or two wearing them
3.0,"The material  was not cloth iI bought  one from you before its not the same. I LOVE MY FIRST ONE , this was like paper or plastic  I didnt like it."
3.0,"I ordered the large (5'3&#34; 135 lbs), and this can be worn as a shirt, not a dress like in the picture. The material is soft and washes well, which is a plus. Just bummed because I really didn't need another shirt."
3.0,"Does hold lot of cards, but difficult to get in and out. Inside pockets are useless, there is nothing you can really use them for"
3.0,Some of the seams were already coming apart when I took it out of the box. But it is beautiful I got lots of compliments.
3.0,I recommend using for LOOKS ONLY. It is plastic and will not hold back a medium or large dog. Looks great on tho! We bought for a 5 month German sheapard and it fit great
3.0,Adorable shoes. Very small and no tabs to pull on baby's feet. Cute while they lasted!
3.0,I would not consider this to be 5 star quality- thin material.  Note - this product ships from Hong Kong.
3.0,I thought it had no plastic but I was wrong.... The good thing is that I like it
3.0,I’m using these as pajama pants. They are too large to wear out. The material is really soft. Very comfortable for jammy pants
3.0,"Overall this is a nice pin. However, it is extremely small, about the size of a nickel overall which means each flag is even smaller and that makes the text on the US ARMY flag hard to read. In my opinion I think the price is a little high for such a small pin but it is fair quality."
3.0,I order a size to big. I have the correct size on order.
3.0,This sweater is like wearing a big comfy blanket. I like it a lot but I've had it for 2 months and the fabric is pilling pretty badly. If it wasn't for that if give it a higher rating. If you buy this id say don't put it in a washer and hang it up when not wearing it. Maybe it would hold up better
3.0,"I originally thought this was gold. Checked the product & it does say silver, fine, my fault...<br />I ordered this beginning of June- I think the 8th? Just getting it today, July 29, from Turkey. For less than $3, not even worth returning.<br />Nothing special..."
3.0,"The tshirt doesn't look exactly like the one on the model especially the open area around the shoulders and it doesn't flare at the bottom. It's  shapeless. Some may like the way it looks on them but I'll be returning it. Not cheap looking, decent. I'm a 16 and ordered the xxl. If I liked it more, I would have gotten 1 size smaller."
3.0,I like the look and feel of the boots but unfortunately they slip to easily on my food service  trailer ramp.
3.0,"Quality seems pretty cheap, won't fall apart after one wearing or anything like that but I would wash it on very gentle settings. Package took 3 months to get here, actually got a refund from Amazon because they said it never actually shipped, item came one month after I got my refund. Seems to be the theme with this item, comes very very late but does eventually come. Plan to buy this WELL in advance of when you are going to need it. Fit is super weird, I am a 6ft female, medium build, and I had to get the extra large. Sleeve length was great, super baggy from the waist down, reminded me of a saggy diaper. In terms of width, I could fit a whole other person inside the onesie and still have room around the waist. Given the price, I would say it's a fair buy. The tail and ears seem to be sewn on fine, no worries about them coming on on accident."
3.0,"The quality of the print was a little poor. Not too expensive, and it's definitely a novelty item, so it is what it is I guess."
3.0,Little too large and bulky for my liking
3.0,"I ordered my usual size per the size chart but this shirt is certainly TOO small. I can wear it, but only if I want everyone to see every role of fat on my midsection! Haha, yes I wish I had ordered a size or two larger than my normal size. Otherwise, soft fabric, pretty print."
3.0,I had 2 of them break<br />I only used them once and they  Broke
3.0,"I can't complain for the price i paid. i did go up two sizes as suggested by others. and the fit is not too bad, just the arms are a bit snug and I don't think i could wear it if i'm wearing anything with thick sleeves. it looks nice, though it sounds like it is lines with paper.<br />It would make a pretty good base for a costume. which is probably what I'll end up using it for."
3.0,"The dress is made more out of a jersey stretchy fabric and is very comfortable. It’s sheer so you can see undergarments underneath so you will have to adjust for that. It does cling to your curves so if you do not want it too tight, order a size up.  Overall it’s comfortable and a really cute dress."
3.0,"It was ok, but nothing incredible. Would probably be adorable on anyone that is smaller, but definitely not for plus size women."
3.0,"I bought this for myself because it looks roomy and pretty. I'm 5'5 170lbd bought the XL and holy crap it looked awful. The fit was so strange I'm not totally sure how to describe but I will say it really brings out belly and butt. I loved like oversized gummy bear😅. Anyhow, my daughter who is 5'7 around 130 pounds, tall and slim wears it beautifully. She's normally size small-medium but in this dress it fit perfectly. She could wear a large and do fine but I already had this one so she's looking<br />Loving it👌. So my advice if you have curves is size up for sure"
3.0,Wish I got the one with the make-up brush holders but otherwise it works!
3.0,"Giving the benefit of the doubt, maybe I got a bad pair, but for $25 I expected it to last longer.  I've purchased $5 shorts from Walmart that still have kept together.  So a little annoyed, but can't say I look bad in them, I do very much like them.  One suggestion would be to have deeper pockets."
3.0,Short in  the torso area. Definitely size up a size. For the length.
3.0,Decent lense however as other posters have noted the frames are somewhat brittle and break easily. Overall not bad considering the price but not really good for long term use.
3.0,"The color is good, but the bag is obviously not leather."
3.0,I was so excited to get  these and when I tried them on they fell off my feet. I was so disappointed. I usually wear a 5.5 sometimes a 6 so I was thinking they would fit of course they didn’t. So thinking about sending them back. So bummed.
3.0,"I've never even wore it! I thought it was a sweat shirt material! So disappointed, the picture was so deceiving!"
3.0,I bought these for my son as his are getting to be small thses earmuffs are even smaller!! They state they will fit from 8 months to small adult well my son is 5 and they don't cover his ears and I have no idea how they would fit an adult they don't adjust save your money buy a different set<br />Great customer service
3.0,A button came off the first day I wore the jacket. The fabric looks very poor quality.
3.0,Gift for the wife. She seems to like them however I expected the fabric to be be heavier and better quality hence three Stars
3.0,The dress is not bad at all however it came ripped!!
3.0,These were a good buy for a bridal party get ready party. However they ran small. The girls ended up wearing tank tops under them.  Overall they fit our purposes for that day. If you’re buying I would buy larger than what you think. A size 10 girl wore a large.
3.0,"Súper cute and soft, loses it shape"
3.0,"These are very well made and look good. The lenses are very clear. The temple pieces have a solid feeling hinge action with good spring return. Very compact and covenient to carry when folded up in the case.<br /><br />These are not so useful for me though. They are in focus only when my face is 7” away from what I’m trying to read, but not for normal reading distances. About the only time I would use these would be when quickly reading fine print on a small label. Maybe this is an issue with my eyes in particular. I did select the glasses per manufacturer’s guidelines."
3.0,"Really cute rings for the price! However, the pink ring came missing a stone, which is sad since I ordered it mainly for that color. And they aren't adjustable, so if your nose is smaller like mine, it'll feel very loose and from the side you can definitely see it's fake. But so far it, even with it being loose, it stays in all day without falling out"
3.0,Love the size but they are a bit flimsy.
3.0,Very small and tight. Fits more like a child’s than an adult.
3.0,the little nose pad fell off after wearing once or twice
3.0,They are very cute. Bought this a yr ago but since they are huge my daughter has not been able to wear them. Hope she still likes them when they actually fit.
3.0,The shoes looked nice just too narrow so back they went sadly
3.0,shrinks after wash
3.0,"Cute, but way too small!"
3.0,"I bought these so I’d have them for my daughters 1 year photo shoot. I received an open bag with a missing onesie and bow, just the skirt.<br /><br />Received my replacement package after I already had the pictures. This one did come in whole and packaged well.<br /><br />Pretty disappointed. It is a cute outfit."
3.0,"Absolutely loved 3 things about this order:<br /><br />1) The (water-blue) color is simply beautiful!  Just as depicted.<br />2) The packaging was excellent.  Very well wrapped.<br />3) Shirt arrived in 2days!  Very impressive.<br />4) The fabric is nice and strong!<br /><br />Not so good stuff:<br />1) This shirt would be absolutely PERFECT if it had that 5% Spandex mentioned in the description).  It doesn't. not even 1%.  It is stiff :)<br />2) Because the shirt lacks the flexibility it says it has, the arms fit a little too snug for my liking without any forgiving/flexibility<br />3) The rest of the shirt was too big, SMILE.  They have the idea, but the shirt was SO big around my body that I feel I need to have it taken in below the armpits and down to my waist to make it not look so frumpy :)"
3.0,"It's pretty cheap as far as construction goes. Would be good for a wear or two, but expect it to fall apart fast. It's super thin as well. Don't expect to be warm outside in the winter with this suit."
3.0,Earring was bent when it arrived.
3.0,Okay  scrub cap.
3.0,This cane with two anklets. The butterfly anklet arrived without the clasp to open the anklet and one of the butterflies detached.
3.0,"Ya, I know it's cheap. Wasnt planning on making it a family heirloom but thought it'd be cute for a wear or two. Oh, ya ""two""... that's what I ordered, and only half of ONE showed up. I got exactly one dried up looking piece of leather. At first I thought a snake had crawled in the package and died but upon closer inspection it had knots in it. No anchor, no ""love"" no nada.<br /><br />After this review I recieved another package in the mail with exactly what I ordered. And they actually look pretty nice. Would have given 5 stars if I felt the first shipment had just been a mistake and not a scheme."
3.0,"Basically ripped the skin off when tried taking it off and left me with scabs/scars. Would give it zero stars if I could. UPDATE: seller contacted me and offered a refund. Happy with the customer service, not the product"
3.0,Pretty but way to large..going to return
3.0,"Beautiful jumpsuit, runs smaller than others I have bought."
3.0,"This is a large, it was too tight thru the chest and waist. Will be returning for extra large, hopefully the shirt length won't be too long. Other then that, the fabric, color, weight is good quality. Only a 3 star because of the sizing issues, otherwise a 5star for quality."
3.0,Works good but striker can work itself loose and fall out.
3.0,"Good glasses, ultra dark. Unfortunately, the side shields pop off every time I put the glasses on. I've had to take them off completely for fear of losing them and that was the main reason I purchased them, bummer."
3.0,"These are really pretty, but they hurt the tops of my feet. I have tried just about everything, but they still hurt."
3.0,"I expected this to fit like a silicone oven mitt - the kind about this size. Unfortunately, it is smaller. I have small hands and struggle keeping this on to do it’s thing."
3.0,"Would have been cool enough. But one worked, one did not. Sent them back, didn't want to chance a replacement."
3.0,"Arrived on time and fit. Just looks cheap, but it was for a costume."
3.0,i bought it for my boyfriend. & it's already rusting from regular use. it's really cheap material. and could have had a warning about it rusting.
3.0,"So this was a fun buy for a summer, but the quality not so much. Won't purchase cheap dresses on here again."
3.0,It runs a little big. If there was an XS it would fit better. This color combination is odd… the camo shorts part (grayish colored) doesn’t match the army green stripes. Below the stripes the material is a mesh and not solid black material. Other than that I decided to keep it because it’s “different”.
3.0,Purse was much smaller than I thought it would be - can't get much in it.
3.0,"I loved the price and prompt shipping. However, I only wore it for one say and there is a crack in the star. A little disappointed, but overall, good."
3.0,"Waistband is small and lose fit. So if you got a little gut, doesn't suck you in and does not feel flattering. However if you don't have a gut I imagine this be very comfortable bc it is loose light and soft material."
3.0,"The dress is huge! I’m thinking I will return it. I ordered an xl, I am usually a l-xl. A medium probably would have fit well. I was not looking for a tight dress and I definitely didn’t get one. It’s seriously double the size I would need. Overall it’s okay. The top seems a bit see through. There’s so much fabric from below the chest that it can not be see through."
3.0,Not worth the money. Item came broken and rhinestones scattered all over inside package.
3.0,"Although I love the style and the way the rings hold the zipper part, the rings consistently come apart and I have cut myself twice and I am speaking of cuts that have caused bleeding."
3.0,Purchased because it had bright yellow background and bright blue fish. Upon receipt not the case.  Very dull mustard color and the blue was muddy.<br />Function was fine but returned due to lack of vibrancy
3.0,"The gloves are great and are quite protective in temperatures just above freezing.  Unfortunately, one of the gloves developed a tear at the bottom after just 2 months of use though. Very disappointing, since I really liked the gloves otherwise."
3.0,Cute suit !! Never came with a belt !!
3.0,"It’s superrrrr soft and passes the panty test. I just had to keep pulling them up, I’m usually a size 3x in leggings and they kept falling down. This has no tummy control if anyone is looking for that."
3.0,Too small but I love the materia
3.0,Really cute print but it's a juniors fit so it's small I usually wear a med or large top and I order XL in this and it's tiiiiiight but still cute I'll wear it when I don't feel bloated lol
3.0,"For dress up, a halloween costume, or a play this hat would be great! However the quality is on the cheap side, and I would say a little on the cheaper of the cheap side.<br />First off the box my hat came in was too small, so my hat is now deformed and bent in an odd way. I MAY be able to reshape it over time....but because it's cheaper I'm not 100% sure I'll be successful. Once I opened the hat from the plastic wrapping there was a smell that was so bad! It was terrible! I had to let the hat air out for about 3 to 4 days before the smell was completely gone ( Luckily I had the time in order to air it out).<br /><br />The hat material is very thin, so thin that you can see through it (although if you're wearing it you cannot tell you can see through it) I like how the creases are sewn into the hat to make it more realistic, I thought that was a cool aspect.<br /><br />The hat is NOT adjustable. It is I'd say an ADULT hat and on my own head I'd say it runs a little large.<br /><br />It's comfortable to wear and it won't make your head hot and sweaty, so that's a pro to the fact that the material is so thin and light.<br />The two &#34;brass&#34; buttons on the side are nice and detailed and are attached well.<br />The &#34;bill&#34; of the had is nice quality although I wish the vinyl on the top of the bill wasn't sewn so you could see the threading and the bunching of the vinyl. It doesn't look bad, but it would definitely give the hat a nicer quality look if it was only sewn on the bottom side.<br /><br />Other than the cons that I've stated above, all in all it's an ok hat and it would get the job done. Just remember it's on the cheaper side of cheap.<br /><br />*I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review which I did leave above."
3.0,I love the mask but not the shield because it's so glumly looking and not clear.
3.0,"Fits great, good quality. I gave it 3 stars because the color runs when washing"
3.0,Love the hoodie but don’t love the material :/
3.0,"The size is a lotttttttttt smaller than what it says. I am out of US and I had to sell them here because I size 41 and this was like a 36... They seem pretty nice, but never had the oportunity to know if they are resistant.<br />Be carefull with the size."
3.0,One pair already ripped. Poor stitching
3.0,Smaller than we thought
3.0,Runs big.  I ordered a medium and it's baggy and boring. Material feels fine though and it was wrinkle free
3.0,"I ordered one size up (as per the reviews); otherwise it would not hang off the shoulders like product pic. However, the smell is soooo bad, I can't handle it"
3.0,The dress is cute but WAY TO LONG!
3.0,"I was so looking forward to receiving these earrings.What a crushing disappointment,the day they arrived.The pretty blue part that looks like  stone in the pic is in actuality a flat tear dropped shaped piece of blue plastic😞"
3.0,Very light and see through. Didn't like the cotton material
3.0,"I'm on the fence with this purchase and may be returning it, but I can't quite put my finger on why. It just didn't feel &#34;right&#34; when I put it on and I feel awkward in it. Something about the way it lays across the top doesn't look right. (Maybe my chest is just too big for this to fit properly?)<br /><br />I'm 5'5, 230lbs, 44DD and I ordered the 2X.<br /><br />Overall, the shirt is well made, soft, and the color is vibrant. The material is fine, as far as I can tell, not at all see-through. Rayon/spandex material makes things slightly more dressy than cotton, but also is much less forgiving. I'm curious to see how well it holds up after washing it -- not going to wash it til I'm sure I'm keeping it. Having to dry-flat can be a pain in the ass.<br /><br />I like that the neck is lacy. It's one of the main reasons I bought this. If I wanted a plain-ole-boring-collar shirt, I would have bought one of those. I also like that the arm holes aren't so large that you can see any part of my bra.<br /><br />Unlike other reviews, I don't think this looks like underwear/PJs.<br /><br />I wish the shirt were longer. I would not be comfortable wearing this with leggings.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />UPDATE:  I decided to return this, as it just didn't look right on me.  I was able to return it without any problems."
3.0,Very flowy.
3.0,I like this case but the glass screen protector started bubbling and the corner pealing off after just 3 days.
3.0,Arrive with missing part👎🏻
3.0,Yea l like but don't knw how to wear ve t y fiff from what l'm use too. Could hav sent some kind ofInstruction
3.0,"I didn't realize it was actual copper as the base metal. I am trying various methods to keep my skin from discoloring with each wear, but no luck yet. I like it and get many complements, but am not happy it wasn't coated to prevent turning your skin green!"
3.0,Not the quality I was expecting. They are very thin.
3.0,These socks are adorable but they start to hurt your toes after wearing them for a while.
3.0,chain is too short for me and the tag has scrached already it would of been nice but it not what I thought.
3.0,Very pretty colors and value for the money
3.0,"These are very nice jeans. The product has great reviews so I bought a pair of the loose fit, straight leg jeans. The pair I received seems more like stretchy, skinny, taper leg jeans. Not exactly what I was wanting it ordered."
3.0,"While the strap is what I expected, the opening for the ear pieces was too small to fit my rayban sunglasses.  The neoprene did not expand enough to get over the ear piece."
3.0,"These are soft. The fluffiness squishes right down, though, so they end up feeling pretty thin. They are also a bit short, such that the heel and height don’t line up *quite* where I want them. I wear 7-8 in shoes, which I think is average for US. I kept them because it’s not horrible and they work for around the house, but a better quality sock would be thicker and fit the average woman’s foot."
3.0,The item write up and pictures didn't make it clear that the top of this umbrella is black
3.0,"Cute but cheap material, strap brokethe first time i wore it."
3.0,"This watch was beautiful! Unfortunately, it comes in three different wrist sizes, which is not mentioned in the description, and this one is the smallest size. It is tiny, almost child sized. Check on Swatch's website and do the wrist measurement first. I have a small wrist and I can't even begin to fit this one. Wish I could find this watch in a normal size, it would be 5+ stars then. The seller did take it back and do a refund, but they should have put size in the description."
3.0,Kids said it was tight
3.0,Ball cap was shipped in a black plastic mailing bag and it arrived with the bill all bent. I’ve tried to straighten it out but haven’t been able to yet so haven’t been able to wear it. Nice colors and cute though.
3.0,"Like the fabric but don’t like the strap too long wish I can make it smaller; I’m not a tall person, 5’2"
3.0,Didn't fit like the pic.
3.0,"Love the bracelet. It it first came in, the pink color was so beautiful, but the color started to fade and now its white/clear.:("
3.0,"These earrings are very cheap, I pulled the post off them just by removing the earring back."
3.0,So hard to get up on to your body. Doesn’t fit well and is slightly unflattering. Definitely wished I had gone up a size.
3.0,Super big. Not my style but cute.
3.0,"Shirt is exactly how it looks, yet it didn't fit very well with the straps, I'm not even sure mine included the spaghetti straps to hold it on. I ended up returning it."
3.0,Won't lay smooth as in the picture. Sits in my closet
3.0,They’re cheap and look/feel cheap.
3.0,"This product is super nice, but I returned it because it was a little too tight for my usage. I also bought it to cover up my back with an open back dress and you can see through the lace VERY easily so it defeated the purpose of having it there. I expected the lace to offer more coverage than it did."
3.0,I am 5'4 and it is too long that i would step on it if i wore it
3.0,I am tall and it is a bit short from the arms to the body.
3.0,Order 2 sizes above yours...
3.0,The shorts fit fine and the elastic waist is wide and feels good. The material is very thin. I wore one pair for one day and it already developed a hole on the thigh.
3.0,Did not fit right and the padding in the breast area was seen through the fabric.
3.0,Very pretty but turned my finger green in a couple hours
3.0,I did not know it was that small but it's very nice and neat.
3.0,"This is definitely meant for young children's heads not adults. There was glue around most parts showing. Honestly, I've seen comparable headbands at the dollar store. These won't last more than a couple uses since the headband is flimsy flexible plastic. 3 stars because the design was cute and it might work for a child who just wants something fun for a party"
3.0,did not like how it fit returned it
3.0,"Super cute shoe however runs wide and big, I'm a size 10 however this size 10 is too big. I went to a sporting goods store and tried the same shoe on  turns out with this particular shoe I'm a 9.5, so order half the size u normally are."
3.0,"I ordered this shirt to go on vacation. It arrived 2 days late, not in time for my departure which was disappointing. Once I returned, I was pleased with the design and sizing however it had a strong odor on it.  I had to wash it before wearing.  Had it not been for the delay in shipping, I probably would have given it 5 stars."
3.0,The hat is rolled up and stuffed into a celaphane bag. It comes bent out of shape and creased badly. The jewelry is nice but the hat is too bad to keep. I had to return it.
3.0,"loved the pattern, hated the material and the fit was a bit off but I am a curvy girl"
3.0,These are very cute but they are very thin.
3.0,Very cheaply made and not from America so the shipping took forever. The item is cute though.
3.0,Product is ok.  It fits better if you have a small neck of which I do not.  Otherwise it is ok.
3.0,"My 15 year old daughter purchased these to wear while playing volleyball.  She usually wears a medium size shirt.  We ended up with an XL to get a good fit (she wears a D cup bra).  It was not loose, but just the right amount of fit with this size.  I would definitely recommend going up at least one size - two if you are larger in the chest area."
3.0,"Pouch arrived pretty early, but buyer beware pouch is not as big as appears in photos, really is no bigger than a debit card."
3.0,The overall style of the frames is nice. The width of the glasses and frames is okay. The length bottom to top is too much. It covers way too much of the face to be attractive. It just looks like it doesn't fit right when you wear it.
3.0,"Reviews seemed positive, so I took a chance.<br />Not realizing there are no returns was a mistake. The watch looks nice, but gains 10 minutes per hour, so not really much of a watch.<br /><br />Update:<br />I ended up fixing the time issue by opening up the back and adjusting the regulator to dial in the timekeeping.  Shame it didn’t come set correctly. So it worked out in the end. Daughter now happy."
3.0,"I purchase this vest in an ex-large to large and then in a large it is to small, well I an giving up. The quality of the vest is excellent. But it is not for me."
3.0,"I washed before my kid wore this and it the black paint on it started to come off in my washing machine before they wore it. Kept it because they wanted to wear it, but if it had been up to me, I would have returned it."
3.0,Hard to put in and was even harder to take out I ended up tossing it in the trash cuz it annoyed me more than anything.
3.0,"Very pretty dress. The style is as expected, except the fit, I'm usually a size L but with this dress on the bottom had to be an XL but the top a size L, why? Because I have very small boobs so when I try to pick something from the floor and I bend a little the dress from the top widens a lot and people would see my boobs very clearly. So sad, very pretty. I will have to return it."
3.0,It works as advertised. But because its packable it is a little flimsy. But that comes with the territory. I wouldn't be setting out on a multi-day hike with it.
3.0,"The glasses were super cute. However, my son had blue on his nose from the nose piece, and when he had them up on his forehead there was also blue everywhere. The blue from the glasses made my child smurf like."
3.0,Havent worn suit yet so I dont know it will really hold up when wearing product.
3.0,Shaft is pretty long and prongs catch on stuff very easily.
3.0,"Soft, very nice looking except for the noticeable flaw in the weave."
3.0,They are much smaller than I expected.
3.0,"As wool socks go, they don't smell - but they are starting to pile after just a single wash.  Ughh!"
3.0,"I'm keeping this sweater because it is so soft, but it's going to be loungewear.  The sweater isn't as long as the picture and the pockets constantly fall out and I have to push them back in."
3.0,"I purchased this item as a portion of a Halloween costume.  I dressed up as Castiel 😂  This item arrived quickly; however, the feathers were already coming off revealing the cardboard underneath.  I had to glue a couple pieces on before wearing.  Since it was only going to be worn once, it was fine for the price."
3.0,Fabric quality is not consistent.  I own several different colors and they all fit and feel different.  One has a shine to it.  Not very flattering no matter your size.
3.0,"size too small compared to my others,"
3.0,"As others have mentioned, the black wears through pretty quickly - but every black or dark metal watch band I've ever had did the same.  The band is well made and easily installed - but I guess I expected the black to last longer that 4 months."
3.0,"Cut but not flattering if you have wide hips like me, I'll wear it though"
3.0,"Very cute and easy to pull on and off of my 8YO’s feet. She didn’t feel like the footbed was very comfortable however, as it is very thin with little-to-no arch support. I added insoles and now she will wear them."
3.0,Super cute but they were way to large for me. I recommend going a 1/2 down. My other complaint is the packaging. The bag was not sealed all the way so the shoe box was literally hanging out.
3.0,"Dress is good quality but material is thin. Red color is vibrant and garment is very soft. Runs large, I am size 8 and usually go for size L when ordering on line. I ordered size M this time per reviews. I should had ordered size S, it is big. Not a dress for the office because material is thin, good dress for a day off or best as sleeping gown because is so soft."
3.0,The adjustable straps at the bottom of the shorts broke the first day but everything else about them is great they are long below the knee just as my son wanted.
3.0,"Cute, colorful, exactly as pictured. However, they fit so tightly that they pinch up on the head and end up popping off when you exercise. My daughter is 8 and on the petite side, and I was surprised at how tightly they fit her. We can't wear them but if you have a smaller head, they might be perfect for you."
3.0,"This skirt is a very attractive design and is true to size.  I would be in love, but for the poor quality of workmanship.  Sending it back."
3.0,Product arrived and fit as expected. My sone was happy the shorts were long. One of the shorts had a hole in the bottom of the leg seam. I just requested a replacement.
3.0,Something is off - the ruffles lay in an odd spot and it's just not a favorite purchase
3.0,"Material is great, not hot, however shorts could have a wider and lower waist band. It is a bit tight and high."
3.0,I loved that this is an automatic watch. I loathe that the setting of the calendar is so difficult.
3.0,"The necklace has an interesting design of latticed silver and 7 dangling coins that says “Queen Elizabeth The Second”.  I am not sure what Queen Elizabeth II has to do with the gypsy tribal look.  The chain is a decent length and is a double chain.  The chain is approximately 24 inches.  I could not wear it for a long length of time, because it is HEAVY.  It weighs down my neck and I start hunching over.  It comes with a little drawstring burlap bag for gift giving.  I wish I could wear it, but it’s just too heavy for my neck."
3.0,"I love the bikini, but I had to go a size up, or two, I ordered a medium because of the reviews,but I guess a L could be better"
3.0,"I'm 5'9"" and these looked super cute on all the short instagram ""influencers"" - unfortunately when I tried them on, they were above my ankle and looked kind of silly. I ended up returning them."
3.0,"Cute but....Buyer beware, this is not a biketard and there are no shorts, photo is a bit deceiving or I didn't read closely, it is a one piece leotard which is not what I was looking for, sent it back."
3.0,"The dress is ok. It’s go elastic around the waist. I don’t know how comfortable that’s going to be after it gets worn all day. It’s a couple inches short. But now that I look at the picture, it’s short in the picture too. I got the black and white chevron striped dress. It’ll be all right as my belly gets bigger because I’m pregnant. It’s not something I would wear otherwise because The waist doesn’t fall in a flattering way."
3.0,Love it but arms are a bit snug. I wouldn't size up but because I don't think it will make a difference on the arms.
3.0,"This shirt is very cute, and it looks great looking from the front and back. But, looking from the side, it has this shape/form ( or fall ) that looks like... a tent. Very wide, boxy, and unflattering. Makes you look huge from the side. I keep re-checking to see if this is maybe a maternity stuff or something, because this is just weird. Maybe this is just not for my shape."
3.0,It is cute but it is a bit sheer so plan to wear a tank underneath. It runs pretty true to size BUT the collar is a bit too wide for me personally and therefore hangs to one side or another. I kept it and thought I'd get used to it but to be honest I haven't worn it again. It just hangs in my closet. I should have returned it.
3.0,Pros:<br />-no show around ankle but fully cover toes<br />-have a no slip grip on the back with a taller height<br />Cons:<br />-price is only for one pair!<br /><br />I'm reading the socks three stars because while I absolutely love the socks I think that the price is ridiculous. When I was reading over the description of the socks it says that the package includes 5 o'clock start… I thought it was kind of weird that they were going to be sending five socks rather than six but I figured oh well I'll try them out anyway. This package only includes one pair of socks… And eight dollars for one pair of socks is in sane. That being said I do love how the product is made. I love that it's a no show socks but it actually covers passed your toes and doesn't slip off like other socks do. I also like it has a nonslip grip on the heel but it's not as thick as the ones that you would see in a pair of vans socks. The socks are nice and thin so they keep your feet cool but protect you from any blisters. I just wish that they costed less.<br /><br />Review by P. Thomas- I received this product for a discount. This is my honest opinion of the item and is not influenced by any discount. I don't  give good reviews just because I received a discount- you can look on my reviewer page to see I give a wide range of 1-5  star reviews.  I am NOT paid to leave reviews. Thank you!
3.0,"Very large and baggy.  I wear a large in Nike, and it fits me perfectly.  This shirt swallowed me."
3.0,I’m kind of upset about the color. I thought they were going to be light blue like on the picture. But they are darker blue
3.0,"Super cute but didn't last long. Probably because of how I washed it, but very fragile for sure."
3.0,"The Filgate Lateral Card Holder Wallet with Pull Tab Slot (Model # HSW181W8) is made of genuine 100% leather.  It feels and smells like genuine leather.  I own numerous articles, such as coats, belts, and Bible covers, that are made of genuine leather.  Despite it arriving inside a sealed plastic bag, there was a small spot of residue on the front of the wallet.  I had to use a damp paper towel and some hand soap to gently rub on it for at least five to ten minutes before the stickiness was completely removed.  I was very disappointed that Filgate would ship this product out to a customer with this type of damage.<br /><br />  The wallet itself (though it appears durable with its leather material and tight, careful stitching) is tiny.  It is totally unsuitable for my personal needs.  I could only stuff seven cards into the card slot and a few folded bills of currency into the actual wallet itself.  I found the pull tab slot to be useless.  This wallet, however, may be appropriate for a teen or preteen who only has a few cards and only a few bills in their possession.  A young woman may want to carry one of these in her clutch purse.  Because it is very small, this wallet can fit inside most anything.  One can easily place it inside their purse, camera case, shirt pocket, bound notebook, zipper pouch, etc.<br /><br />  This wallet is good for keeping a few cards and bills together.  Perhaps, if I was going to an amusement park, night club or beach, I would carry it in lieu of my larger, bulkier wallet that has all of my life in it.  I could use this wallet solely for the basics such as my driver's license, health and auto insurance cards, one major credit card, and some folded currency.  Teens and preteens who don't own as many cards as adults would benefit more from this wallet.  Overall, I only recommend the Filgate Lateral Card Holder Wallet with Pull Tab Slot (Model # HSW181W8) if you have a special need for it."
3.0,From the picture it looks like a metallic gold design on black. But it is not it is Brown and yellow. If I had know that I would have preferred it to be blue instead of brown and yellow.
3.0,"I have 42"" chest, 32/33 Sleeve. I ordered a Large. This was Seinfeld's Poofy Shirt.<br />I wanted this burgundy color, no one else had it in my size.<br />I'm returning it and trying the Medium.<br />Material not lush -- thin. Will wash carefully, not wear it more than 2x month during cool/cold months."
3.0,"Great product,  however speakers glitch randomly."
3.0,"Received  in 1 day with Prime. Fun suit for my teenager's Hawaiian-themed school dance. Low quality, but fit great. Unfortunately, he had to leave the dance early, because the pants completely ripped out! waiting to hear from the seller."
3.0,"Pendant is a lot bigger then I expected. Not really a good outline of the state, but figured it was just too small to be accurate.... I was wrong"
3.0,"cheap material and not very flattering, size up"
3.0,"Band seems nice, included hardware is hot garbage.  You're probably going to need to have it put on professionally.  The little tool included broke immediately, and the blue device didn't fit my watch at all."
3.0,"Sweaters do not look like the stock photos on the models. Unfortunately, they’re very basic and I will be returning the 2 I ordered. Disappointing because I was excited to put them to use come fall season."
3.0,"They were delivered in 2days and the pants fit nice.  However, I almost sent them back because of the strong chemical smell they had when they arrived. But I took a chance and washed them a multiple times and let them air.  Most of the smell finally went away. I won't buy them again though because they are quite expensive to smell like that. I expect that smell on very cheap products made in china. Also, they are jeans not pajama-like. I would not wear these to bed. My other regular jeans are just as soft."
3.0,Very cute but didn't stand the test of time and therefore was overpriced. I only had it a few months.
3.0,Kept it for a shirt ... I'm only 5' tall and sz 6 ... So this is very short & small
3.0,"I wish the shorts ran true to size. The shorts run super small in this and the top runs super big.  It's weird. But I buy it anyway because it's really soft, helps with the sweat wicking thing for hot flashes, and is really baggy.  I wear the small top and donate the shorts. But it's weird."

3.0,"Excellent design and comfortable to wear, more so for those who cannot wear wrist accesories or feel uncomfortable wearing silicone bands. Nice colors, but expect them to be a little bit different than the photo. The materials are pretty good and seem sturdy enough, plus there are no edges to scratch you with. It's also pretty simple to put your fitbit tracker in and out of the &#34;box&#34; of the clip.<br />Unfortunately I still can't find a place to clip it where I can get an accurate count of my steps. The flex was designed for arm movement and it does have issues reading steps when you clip on your shirt, bra and waist band. Maybe for strenous exercise it will work better, but for everyday movement you will read much lower depending on where you attach the clip. So far mine has read anywhere from no steps at all to about 40% of the steps. I will attach to my shoelaces next and I expect that will make it very accurate."
3.0,"A bit heavy on the ear. I am just not accustomed to it, but these are beautiful.."
3.0,"The bracelet looks really nice, the watch... well it kicks like it won’t survive if you hit it against the wall by mistake. Still fancy and elegant look, just be aware it looks like a short life product."
3.0,Baggy and scratchy.
3.0,"The quality of these pants are wonderful. As good as Nike or Under Amour. Unfortunately, they sent me an XL when I ordered a L. Didn't notice until I spent the day pulling up my pants. Not sure if I can exchange after wearing."
3.0,Definitely not as cute when you get it but it's not so awful that I need to mess with returning it. I have yet to wear it. Weird spandex material.
3.0,"Loved the 1st one I bought, but the 2nd one I ordered in the same size fit way different and was smaller."
3.0,We ended up using this as a shirt because it was too short for a dress. It either runs small or it’s an incredibly short dress. Garment is fading after a couple of washes
3.0,I ordered a size up and they were still to small. They are cute so I'm hoping you return and get a bigger size.
3.0,It’s a nice strap but it doesn’t fit in the whole of my wallet case so it was a waste of money
3.0,"This is a cute bracelet, but the leather is shinier than I'd like. Also, it doesn't close tight enough to not slide around my wrist. I'm between a size 6 and 8 so not super thin. The bracelet was just tight enough when I bought it, but now has stretched somewhat."
3.0,The 2XL fits like an XL. And the arms are too short:-/
3.0,"I like the way this shoe looks but the top band squishes my toes together. I would order one size larger than needed with this shoe. Overall, good purchase for the price."
3.0,"Standard white button down. Nothing special, but would have served my purpose if it was true to size. If you are an  XL, this shirt will not fit you."
3.0,"When I first got these I loved them. Perfect fit, nice and soft and super comfy. Now I can only wear them around the house..definitely not at the gym because they pilled awful and attract piece of lint. I used a  lint brush and one of those shavers for pills and they looked better but I don't want to have to work so hard to wear a pair of sweats. They are great for around the house cleaning because of how comfy so I still like them just don't love."
3.0,Cute but smaller than I thought.
3.0,It fits the breast nice gives good operation to the breast but the outside  edge of the cup cuts into my armpit weirdly I was think the rib cage size was just a little small but and expander didn't seem to help at all.
3.0,Don't go by the size chart! I went by the measurements since all of the reviews mentioned it running small. I ordered a 2XL because of my bust being 39&#34;. It was WAY too big. I can't return it since it came from China and I would be responsible for shipping- which is the cost of the shirt. I gave it to my friend who loves it and I will order one in a large instead.
3.0,Cute but much smaller than I expected.  Smaller than a pencil eraser.
3.0,good quality construction and overall a solid belt but the sizing and description was off so what I got was not what I expected.  Not the end of the world by any means and I found a use for it.
3.0,These are very weirdly sized/shaped. I feel like the sides should have been sown down or something
3.0,"It says knee high socks but it really is mid calf socks and I have small legs. They look nice, but shouldn't say knee high."
3.0,"I understand this a quality piece, I just wish they had inserted the stone correctly into the setting. Hey my wife still loves it so it's not a total loss."
3.0,"Very thin, clingy material."
3.0,I thought this sweatshirt was going to be made out of the regular sweatshirt material but it’s not. It’s made from a shiny polyester blend.  It’s okay.  But not what I expected.
3.0,Took a really long time to arrive plus has a chemical smell to the fabric. The color is pretty!
3.0,I am disappointed in this watch band for my Apple watch.  It is hard to put it on especially if I want to wear it on my right hand (I am a righty).  I find I'm constantly adjusting it which sometimes causes my activity counter to pause.  And it doesn't lay smoothly on my wrist.  There is a lump where the band attaches.  I had another band before this with more of a latch and it worked way better.  I can not recommend.
3.0,I love the material and it's very comfortable but the fronts are too narrow so it sits under my arms and doesn't go over my breasts.
3.0,"They don't stay on the bottoms of my feet very well, and they stretch out easily and move around in my boots, so they don't really protect my feet from my boots, but they are super warm, and super cute on and oh my gosh are they soft! i just wish they didn't stretch out so much."
3.0,The boob area was too small.
3.0,"Does not look quite the same in person as in the photos. (Looks more like bones than bamboo in person) Also, smaller than expected. The hunge was well made, did not pinch. Sadly this bracelet did not meet my needs, will return."
3.0,Me quedo muy ajustado
3.0,"Nicely made, lightweight windbreaker. Easily folds up for taking backpacking or even just sightseeing (in case of a random shower). Where this falls short is in the sizing. This runs very small. My son is thin but tends to wear a large (due to his height), he had difficulty zipping this up (was too tight on him). If  you buy this, definitely size up. Not sure he will ever wear this due to the fit, I may take for use for myself when traveling."
3.0,Very thin material. Comfortable for around the house. Wouldn’t recommend for extreme workout.
3.0,"Even though I ordered one size up, this cardigan runs a bit small, especially at the bottom. It's a nice, lightweight fabric, but it's silky, so it tends to pull way open instead of falling down straight if you leave it unbuttoned. Just keep that in mind when you order."
3.0,"It’s cute but the fabric isn’t a typical T-shirt fabric, it’s more like nylon"
3.0,Comfortable and lightweight. Print design is not top quality. It’s cheap for a reason.
3.0,Ok material. Comes a little big.
3.0,"I have a very wide feet!(eee) so the size was a bit tight, however everything else was just fine. Shipping was super fast!  Thanks"
3.0,Pretty dress but I ended up returning it. The fit was not great for my body.  I’m self conscious about my stomach and this dress didn’t flatter that area.
3.0,"Quality is ok, size was a bit too big, but not bad."
3.0,It would be cute but it is super tiny and short
3.0,"I ordered this dress in black and received polka dot. I have a medium that I really love but it's too tight in the chest. So I ordered an xl, it's a bit baggy by wearable. I just wish it were black. Not worth returning for the price.<br />Oh. The pockets are great, and make the dress more comfortable."
3.0,"I liked the size, color and the fabric but the rhinestones made it look cheap."
3.0,"The dress is much longer and larger than expected. Was sure to return it, but it may look better with a belt. The quality is not great, loose threads need to be cut."
3.0,Tee shirt material on top and polyester or silky on bottom. Gathered seam didn’t stretch so stitching popped when put on.
3.0,The bottoms fit poorly because they are cheap and the white lining of the bottoms show while you wear them.  THe top however is so cute and fits very well
3.0,"The sizing works perfectly.  I only had my baby a week ago, so I haven't used it all that much yet as I'm still recovering, but it fits very well, arrived in time and the quality is just as expected."
3.0,Love the color... The lens yellows everything I guess that's the blue light blocker. They look super cute in though...I will use them!!
3.0,"Jeans fit nice and snug, I got the black ones and they are VERY opaque black"
3.0,LOOKS LIKE A CHEAP DOLLAR STORE TRINKET
3.0,Wasnt loose enough fit for yoga type pants.
3.0,It was very confortable and fresh. But it seems as if the shirt was cut wrong at the bottom. Each size was totally uneven and noticeable.
3.0,I used the size chart and the top runs super big. Nit what I expected.
3.0,"A little small, but nice detail."
3.0,"Break easy, although sent a new one"
3.0,The material is thinner than I expected.  I could see my undergarments through it.  It was a bit small for my typical sizing and I questioned whether it would shrink in the wash making it even smaller.
3.0,Looks as pictured but is definitely not a sweatshirt. More of a long sleeve T-shirt. I ordered up a size to have a very baggy look and I love it!
3.0,"I am a fairly normal sized person, and a Medium pretty much always fits me. These fit great through the legs but couldn't accommodate my backside. They were quite soft though, and I'm sure would have been lovely if they had fit."
3.0,"some panties were sewn wrong but ones that fit, were ok"
3.0,not happy with it even tho when Grandson graduated from West Point it rained so hard. As soon as I put it over my head the one side of it tore right beside the drawstring so much for a good quality poncho. Not happy with it but did like the thickness of it. people around me wanted to know where I bought it so I told them but 5 minutes wearing it  it tore. It was nice and long I am a small lady 5ft 1 inch so it covered me well and my SIL is a bigger man and it fit him fine also and did keep us dry. I thought about sending it back for a replacement but didn't feel like going through the hassel.
3.0,"All the boutonnieres were fine not damage but quality is so so. The some of rosettes were not folded as tight, making the rose look bulky and losing its shape.  However, they are really cute. I pay close attention to detail that was my only dislike."
3.0,Given as a gift for a granddaughter who just joined Theta which my wife joined in 1954. She was very pleased. Had some difficulty opening the clasp which is small and her mother finally got it open. Little smaller than expected but looked good on her and is attractive.
3.0,"Let's put it like this: they are perfect for the price you pay and horrible as glasses per se. Therefore, as a compromise between the two, I give it 3 stars.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- nice colorful frame<br />- the aviator style<br />- price, again<br /><br />Cons:<br />- cheap plastic, and it is obvious once you touch them - everything is so thin and fragile!<br />- horrible joints. Whatever it is supposed to be kept in place with, it is not kept. I broke mine in literally a weak after the purchase. I just tried to get them out of pocket, and once side broke entirely. Yes, with no push on it, I barely touched it, and it just fell apart.<br />- smell of plastic. I sensed it immediately after I had unpacked them, yet I hoped it would be gone in a couple of days of regular wear (and you can imagine, in Miami, it is more than easy to do that). Nope, by the time they broke and went to garbage, they still were smelling as if they were two hours out of a plastic-producing factory.<br /><br />Overall, I will never buy it again (and I haven't, in fact). Instead, I bought normally made glasses at $10 at my local TjMax, and have been more than happy with them for last 9 months."
3.0,But was smaller then expected. Sizes should be easy to find by price tag in description!
3.0,These pants will look very nice until washed a few times. Very cheap material. If you want them to last longer wash on gentle and hang to dry. I don’t ever see dress pants in long so it’s kind of my only resort.
3.0,I'm 5'4 and 120 lbs and read a review that suggested I get a medium. It's not as flowy as I would like it to be and wish I would have gotten a large.
3.0,"I find the belt a bit small and the side chain is not long enough in order to get the look.  For the price, is of good quality and pretty."
3.0,Posts were both on the same antler for each earring...made one look like it was laying funny.
3.0,"The shirt runs large, and material is too thick to be worn on hot weather. There price is ok and I received it on time."
3.0,Ok. Not as comfortable as I would have liked. The nose bridge is always an issue.
3.0,Dress is really see though. I ordered the yellow to wear as a Winnie the Pooh costume. Must wear tights under.
3.0,"These do the job for a casual hiker and fall hunting boot, but the big drawback is the fabric area that shreds when caught on thorns and such.  They pulled after a few hunts and are blown out totally after a full season.  Won't get them again unless I can't find anything else. For the price, ok...but pay more and get something a little more durable."
3.0,I thought I ordered a L but got an XL which could fit a little boy. Sleeves way too short
3.0,It’s nice but very big like for a necklace charm. I wanted to add it as a bracelet charm but it’s too big.
3.0,"I was ify about buying these. I was under the impression they were big lenses but they aren't, they are actually small & I wasn't too happy w/them only until I put them on and seen what it was like looking thru the lenses and OMG THEY WON ME OVER ASAP!! NO, the tint is not the color as the appear on the outside but omg they are a very beautifully bright, lovely, comfortable shields, like a neon tan. It's hard to explain. They are amazing!! But they are not worth $14.-. But they are cute. I have a really fat round face so it's hard for me to find glasses that fit comfortably and I was worried about that but when I put them on they fit so comfortable. They weren't tight fitting and uncomfortable. Loved them. The lenses do look just like the photos."
3.0,"Super cute shoes,  beware they run like 3-4 sizes smaller than advertised. I ordered a 13 for my daughter and it was a solid 2-3” shorter than her other 13s"
3.0,The magnets on the band are so strong that it sticks to a lot of things so it is hard to take on and off.
3.0,"I initially was very happy with this top. I wanted a soft, lightweight sweatshirt-type top and this one seemed perfect. I am a size small and ordered a medium and it fit great and wasn't oversized at all. The tag says it is 98.5% cotton and 1.5% elastane so I thought I was safe from shrinkage. However, after washing in gentle cycle and hang drying, it shrunk in the length and the arms and now is beyond cropped and can’t be worn.  The care instructions say it can be washed and put in the dryer, which is clearly not the case.  The caramel color has a hint of pink in it. I am very disappointed that this didn’t work out. Perhaps if I ordered two or three sizes up it might have been ok."
3.0,"I ordered two of the same pair and one is pull on and the other has a button/zipper 🤔 Decent material, panty lines show through though and ordered short and are still too long."
3.0,"You know what? the shirt is as expected. IT is huge around the torso, which is what is advertised, and the sleeves are slightly skinny. But overall, that makes this shirt the oddball that I expected it to be. I have to say that I really would have liked it if the FABRIC was not so thin!  Seriously, peeps, it is stiff like cotton, it feels cottony in sheen and texture, but if you stand against the light and have uncontrolled little or big love-handles (and who doesn't when wearing slightly-slipping leggings), I would venture out to say that they will be silhouetted against the light. So, what's a viable solution? Well, hell, wear it at night when playing with Dracula. Or run through bright light pretending you are Dracula rather than standing like the model in the picture. Yeah....no.<br /><br />RECAP: Love the funkiness of the shirt and it's hidden pockets on the sides, but the fabric is totally stupid. Go spend money on slightly better fabric and just be you."
3.0,One of the earrings came broken and im so sad. I was expecting to use them for a special occasion and now it’s too late. Overall the quality of the earrings was great and i bet they would look amazing on.
3.0,Two of the earrings came broken
3.0,"Pretty thin material, and the ends are not hemmed to keep from freying. I have worn it 1 time and it is already coming apart at the ends."
3.0,"So, when I placed the order for these pants the title said they were linen.  It appears the seller has since changed the title because these are NOT linen.  The FNSKU on the packaging even says ""linen"" so the change to the listing and title is very recent.<br /><br />I am keeping the pants because they still fit fine and are somewhat what I was looking for but the material is a bit heavier than linen.  The waist fits snugly, in a good way, and the legs are very roomy, in a good way, so I won't dock this purchase more than 2 stars.  But I really wish sellers would stop trying to falsely make sales and just make a good product that stands on its own."
3.0,"Nice inexpensive shades, with a good moderate light lens, great for early evening. Construction is a little light and I get the impression they wont react favorably to even minor abuse, haven't had an issue yet though. Generally they are comfortable, but the shape/angle of the lens isn't perfect for my face, my wife however says they are quite comfortable, so fit is obviously pretty subjective."
3.0,So big it's like wearing a diaper.  Good quality<br />Though
3.0,"I bought this in red and I love the shirt with one major caveat, the color transfers. I wore this with a pair of light yellow jeans and the red transferred on to the belt loop and waist band of the jeans. Since all of my jeans are light in color, I am not sure what I can wear this with because of the color transfer."
3.0,"I like how heavy this necklace is, and it truly is very pretty.<br />My ONLY dislike is it doesn’t fit around my neck like it showed in the picture.<br />It was supposed to be a men’s necklace, when in fact it’s more like a teenage boys size."
3.0,"The picture shows it at more of a silver base and rainbow colors, this is gold or brass. I had another one that was silver toned, this one is not."
3.0,"I gave these three stars instead of two because you get what you pay for and I didn't pay much. Very thin, tend to pick up all the dirt and fur in the house. Yes, fur.....lint collectors, nice bright colors."
3.0,A little disappointed because my top is S and fits perfectly but my daughter's size 2t XS is way tooo big for her so I need to wait until it fits. She is skinny so maybe this 2t is made for chubby toddlers. The fabric it's very good I like it.
3.0,Unfortunately it didn't fit through my tragus but I can still use them for my helix.<br />1 of the gems was already out of the earring when I opened the package :(
3.0,its a good fit. delivery on time
3.0,"It was cute and fit well, but I returned it as it did not seem at all like it was 100% cotton, it had a very polyester feel to it. there were no markings to indicate the content."
3.0,Very spacious. But zipper does not like to work half the time. Bigger than I expected.
3.0,"The belt is very cute, but it has a long chain that hangs down the back.  I really hate that, and have to clip it to the belt with a clip, which then, I can only wear it with something like a jacket over the back."
3.0,"Pulled them right out of the package, noticed that they weren’t clean right away. They had little bitty fuzz balls on them and I even found blonde hair on them, I have dark brown hair. They also had a smell, like someone had worn them.<br />Now for the positive part. I like them. I decided I didn’t want to go through the trouble to send them back, I can wash them good. They look to be in good shape. They are soft very stretchy, not completely see-through but when stretched far they can be. They didn’t hold my tummy in as much as I would like. But they may have if I had ordered a medium. I wear a large and I would say these were a very comfortable large. Again I think I could fit into a medium but the large fit me well."
3.0,"Very nice cap, a little small to be a men's hat."
3.0,"Loose fitting, especially in shoulders and chest.  I am short, but full breasts, I haven't been able to wear it"
3.0,Ok considoring the price.. suprisingly hard to find glasses like this i bought 2.5+  it works  perfekt . The glass is Good bit the rest is a little cheapish and bulky  .. if you plan to use them together with a helmet  . Cold be an issue ..  im only happy to get rid of my  bifocals
3.0,Hard to put on. Breaks easily.
3.0,These sandals are lightweight and comfortable.  Overall they are cute looking but the quality is poor.  The craftsmanship is sloppy.  Materials are cheesy.  They looked better in the photos and in person you can see they’re just a cheap shoe. I’ll keep them because they weren’t super expensive but I was disappointed for sure.  I’d have bought other colors but I don’t think they’re worth it.
3.0,Wears good but the color comes off easily.
3.0,too small returned and did not reorder
3.0,This one is okay for the price
3.0,"I liked the color and material,  however this is far from loose fitting.  I looked like a stuffed sausage.  Would be ok as something to wear as a base layer or order a size or two up."
3.0,I like the belt but the roller slips and I constantly have to re-tighten the belt.
3.0,"Too large for women I feel, also super hot and sweaty"
3.0,They function fine. I don't like the feel of the over-the-glasses product. Good value.
3.0,The dress was a bit larger than what i expected.
3.0,"This tie is a beautiful print.  However, the photo was a little confusing.  We thought the background of the tie was cream or ivory, but when the tie arrived, it was pink.  Lovely tie, just not appropriate coloring for her wedding party."
3.0,This earrings are small more so for kids
3.0,Nice boot. NOT waterproof!
3.0,Love the brand just expected a better material.
3.0,"Color was not as expected , and very cheap material"
3.0,Terrible smell out of the bag! Must be the plastic. Otherwise.. Looks cute. Works well. Slightly different color than pictures
3.0,Cute but very thin i'm 54 165 and i got a small
3.0,"Color was not as bright as I expected for the coral, more of a rose. also, very heavy, stretchy spandex is not at all flattering. Quality looks decent otherwise. Returning."
3.0,"I got 2 different patterns both in medium. The blue one was pretty big on me, and the red one was pretty small.  I may order a few more to get the correct fit and return the ones that dont fit.  I like the material and the cut."
3.0,Super cute for my one year old but the straps were too long so I had to tie a ribbon on the back to keep them up. Also after the first wash the straps broke off the back.
3.0,"Great selection and amount for price, but breaks easily."
3.0,Highly upset!! This is not 16 inches! It is 17in  exactly ! Change the description ! Now I have to return it what a headache.. Such a pretty necklace but I wanted more of a choker length... :(
3.0,For the price what do you expect? Looks like a cartoon version of the picture shown. Is decent material and is comfortable. Runs small for sure. Got for daughter Normally wears a large got an XX large and it was still a little bit tight.
3.0,"I ordered these in size 52 rec 15 for my glasses and in size 54 rec 15 for my husband's glasses, based on the size of our eye glasses and the dimensions found on the Solar Shield website.  My glasses lens is actually 51mm across, and the 52 rec 15 are slightly too small.  The spring is almost fully extended, and there are edges of my glasses that aren't covered by them.  My husband had a similar experience with the 54 rec 15.  Luckily for me, the 54 rec 15 seem to fit my glasses perfectly, but we'll need to order the 56 rec 15 for him (hopefully those will fit when they arrive).  These are easy to put on and take off (even one-handed) and otherwise work well.  Bottom line: order the next larger size."
3.0,fit fine but once laundered a few times it seems to lose some of its elasticity.
3.0,Just ok but it is only for showering
3.0,Cute but it runs a bit large.  My toddler is a size 9 but these fit more like a 9.5.  The heel area is also a bit wide but the ankle strap keep her feet in place.
3.0,It was an interesting piece of cosmetic jewelry.
3.0,"Much too big, I don't like the fit. Extra wide elastic waistband is too wide and looks ugly."
3.0,"too long, but otherwise, the fit is ok"
3.0,These very thin socks fit fine on the foot itself but the toes are really thin and tight.  It's hard to get the toes which leaves the toes feeling strangled for a time. There is also extra room at the top of each toe.  Eventually they stretch and mold but it's not an easy start.  The non-slip foot pads could be a little bigger for a better grip.
3.0,"I bought a medium in these. 5’3”;  a small probably would fit, too. The medium works though. I like the length and softness...I really like these. My only complaint is that I put them on and noticed a small hole at the bottom around the stitching. It’s not worth shipping back, but I assume the hole will get bigger soon."
3.0,"I like the fit of these however the seam on the inside of the waist band was not sewn together and causes the waist to not fit properly.<br /><br />The navy blue pair that I bought was a different material and rides down or feels like it’s falling off when I run.<br /><br />The black pair fit well, no issues"
3.0,"These feel good as far as the ones that work. Out of 2 packages 5 of them did not work. (5 out of 20). That is 25% of them defective. The lever does not snap back and are very hard to push in. I send back one package with the defective ones. I bought another style clasp from the same brand with the same type of issues. Expect to have clasps that dont work from this brand. Also, here is a picture next to solid brass hardware for color reference."
3.0,"Low cut socks that are used with loafers, etc. These are comfortable and have padding without being bulky. It's possible to wear these without having my shoes feel tight. I like that they wick away moisture.  I have found that they slip off a bit though."
3.0,"This dress is okay. It’s pretty clingy and not at all what is pictured other than color, but I’m still keeping it. It came with tacky black laces up the back which I’m cutting off. It has a side zipper closure with half a clasp at the top, no easy fix for that sadly. The cloth for the tie up is also very stiff and doesn’t fit with my hair, but I’m hoping a wash will help that. It is not a neckline as shown, it has more of a V shape."
3.0,"I got an XL and it fits great.  I'm 182lbs 5'2"" for reference.  The only downside is that after showering and putting on lotion I guess it absorbed the lotion and it has what looks like oil stains.  I'm keeping it though since I don't mind it for sleeping."
3.0,They are very very tight and loose most of their color just after s few washings
3.0,Love the vibe of this but after getting it and looking at it a while…. The 3/4 moons are reversed. They should be shadowed on the opposite side in both cases.
3.0,"they are okay. I have quality dress socks that are pretty  thick. Because of this, they seem to not want to stay buttoned to the socks"
3.0,It is very difficult to put on. You will need 2 people.
3.0,These glasses work great order them just before vacation got a chance to use them in the Atlantic Ocean and then got a chance to use them in the Gulf of Mexico the straps are easy to adjust. BUT back at the hotel pool STRAPS FASTENERS BROKE putting them on.  POOR Design.******  I will buy New Straps from 3rd party*****
3.0,Was extremely nice but was way too small.  The fabric was also excellent quality but I had to return it.
3.0,"I purchased a size medium based on all of the reviews of running tight. I am 5'6&#34; and 110 lbs. It was definitely too large and boxy, even fully loaded with all my devices. I really liked all the pockets, and things fit nicely in them, but I decided to return it.  I opted for a different manufacturer and hope the fit will be better.  I could have also tried a size small in this model, but the length of the vest was already shorter than I preferred, and just not flattering in shape.  Great design and fabric, just needs to be adjusted on fit."
3.0,"Bangles are beautiful but the color rubs off on your skin. Also, glitter gets all over the place."
3.0,Like many others the eye holes are not  shown in the product description of the product some adjustment is needed to eliminate  the eyeholes specially since you can’t see to the eyeholes<br />Luckily I have a mother in law that’s a wizard at sewing
3.0,This is a decent sports bra if you are doing low to medium impact workouts. It fit good around my bust but the straps are a little big. It is very comfortable but really isn't going to hold the girls in place if you are working out hard. I have mixed feelings about it because of its comfort. I am a 36 DD and ordered an XL. Maybe I should have gotten a L instead.
3.0,I purchased this to take with me on a trip to Costa Rica where I would be hiking around a lot.  I bought it because of the molle straps and also I liked the idea of having a smaller pack.  My iPad Pro fit in it perfectly.  There is a pocket for a hydration system which was kinda nice.  The molle straps work well as I tied a first aid kit to the front of the pack.<br />Unfortunately that's  all I liked about it.  The pocket layouts are very strange and weren't all that well thought out.  I like to be able to quickly dig into a pack and bring something out without having to take it off and unzip everything.  On this pack it's not that easy.  The large compartment has a strange interior pocket for something that I didn't figure out why you'd want to use it(not the hydration pocket).  That interior pocket ripped as well so I just cut it out altogether.<br /><br />Overall I wouldn't buy this again but for the price I'll keep it for short day trips where I don't need to pack much.
3.0,Size is on the teeny side of large!  The ad said to order normal size.  Needed to order one size larger.
3.0,Uno de los filtros se cae con mucha frecuencia al ponérselo en el rostro.
3.0,One of the bottom corners was bent inwards. Not a great presentation for a gift. I would have rated it higher if the corner was able to be straightened and if I could exchange it.  Exchange is not an option.
3.0,"This piece is not my favorite. I think it was strappier than I had anticipated and feels a little like a web of strings on me. Plus I was not a fan of the bathing suit type closure in the back, I would have preferred a pullover like other bralettes have"
3.0,"These neck gaiters were the largest ones I found on the Amazon site, but they're pretty snug.  It was a good value to get 6 in the package, but we're going back to our masks because they are warm, uncomfortable and just not big enough so they kind of cut into our noses."
3.0,"The hat looks good, fits well and the letter stitching if ok (a few loose threads on a letter- remains to be seen how it holds up). Unfortunately, as another reviewer noted, and I rolled the dice and lost- the lettering is crooked. After measuring it is about 1/8th of an inch higher on the last letter from the first. It is noticeable enough to make you wonder &#34;is it..?&#34; when looking at it but not glaringly askew. I haven't decided if it is worth the hassle of sending it back. I have another cheaper hat on the way and I will compare. If the cheaper one looks better I might send this back. That is unfortunate since I really liked the flex fit and profile. But since this is for a duty hat I might decide to be a little more picky,(or if the chief notices). I"
3.0,"I love the style but the ribbon is off center and the bodice could be a little longer to have a better fit (proportion wise). So I read someone else’s review saying that they wished they went a size up, so I got a Medium instead of a small but now I wished I did get a small. But with bigger sizes you can always alter it to get it smaller so that’s what I’ll do. (photo is the before alterations, honestly I’ll make it into a skirt instead because the top can’t be saved)<br />I received the package earlier then expected but Amazon thinks the package is missing."
3.0,Definitely does not look like the picture but it's still a nice jacket. Seems like if I would have ordered the small the arms would have been too short. Also the sleeve had a few loose threads at the end. Overall I don't regret the purchase.
3.0,beat up and out of shape.
3.0,"The first time I wore it, it was a little big but pretty. It seems to have stretched out and is too big to wear now, even though I can't figure out how that could have happened."
3.0,it ran smaller than usual  and I was expecting a thick quality product
3.0,They look very cheap! They are heavy.
3.0,I think it is okay but it was not what I expected.
3.0,"I thought these looked cheap, but they are $7 sunglasses so I’m not sure what I was expecting. They also arrived scratched."
3.0,"I purchased the 8 pack of these as stocking stuffers for Christmas but I am just going to give them as a gift in a nice box. They are much cuter than I expected. Nice chain and they glow bright. The reason for the three stars is that the purple ones didn't glow in the dark. I did receive two neon blue, two peach/orange, and two neon green that work and for the price its still very worth the six that worked. The glow colors remind me of glow stick colors. When they are not glowing they are a subtle color like a cream/white. They are silver or a pretty rose gold color.  I may purchase more if they are a hit."
3.0,"Fit well, however didn't like the style."
3.0,It does not hold well to garments.  It is a good idea but wish it held on better
3.0,"Lenses are a bit rough on the cheeks, but they rarely touch my cheeks. Feels like a hard plastic. Cheap, but cute."
3.0,definitely more feminine than masculine. Bright red and woven design can work well for most dressing occasions that you would wear.
3.0,I gave three stars because the bottoms and see through and the top is big for us smaller chested ladies. I sized up like the reviews said but the top was big and bottoms fit fine. They’re a little cheeky but not too bad
3.0,"I received it as a gift.  It looked and felt durable.  Very comfortable on the toes and sturdy all-day wearable bottom sole.  When I first wore for all day shopping at the mall however, within 10 minutes of walking, I could not continue.  The top brim of the boot was cutting through my skin.  Felt like a hatchet.  I couldn't throw it away or give away as donation.  It's my birthday present from my son who couldn't afford more.  I came up with a perfect solution.  I cut around the boot, about 2"" at the front and back.  Now, I wear it with my favorite jeans and leggings everywhere, all day long, comfortable, stylish, and happy!"
3.0,I thought there'd be more room in the cup for myself.
3.0,"Not ""colored jean"" fabric..thinner cheaper fabric. If you sit -the back waistband dips down to show much of your underwear! Too deep a V for decent ""on you"" feel. Pine color is great. Fabric really uncomfortable. Feels sewn against grain CHEAPLY."
3.0,The size chart must be off. My son is 4 and these gloves were very big for him.
3.0,Cute outfit. The tummy control is great but the material is so-so.
3.0,You'd have to be a size 0 to really fit into this thing
3.0,"Top small, I ordered a SM per the chart (I'm 5'7&#34; 136 lbs, 34D). There is one small snap on the top to keep it closed.  Fabric nice, print is pretty but one hug from my kids and the top would be wide open.  This is a wrap dress, with the belt going through so the front flaps open to show too much leg if you're not careful.  Returned."
3.0,Fits small and it looks cheap in person I wouldn’t buy it again if I had the choice...
3.0,Chain looked nice but the medallion was weak.
3.0,This one is passable.
3.0,It was ok but clasp kept opening up almost dropped off my wrist a few time.
3.0,"I bought this set of rings a few months ago for my young niece.  She loves rings but isn't always responsible and somehow a lot of her rings just &#34;go missing&#34; so I was looking for an inexpensive ring for her and ran across this set and thought she would really like these.  The price was certainly inexpensive so I thought I would go ahead and purchase them and if by chance, one or two (or maybe the whole set) is lost, I really won't be out a lot of money.<br />I didn't expect the rings to be made of great quality because of how inexpensive they were and they aren't but they are really cute and my niece seems to like them.  She wears them with cute outfits and takes a lot of selfies and makes sure that her hand is showing with the rings in her photos.  I guess that's a teenager.  Go figure.<br />I'm not sure how long they will last but so far she has been wearing them about four months off and on so I believe I have got my money's worth anyway."
3.0,Love black and white so chic but too plastic like a kids toy!
3.0,"If you're even the slightest bit claustrophobic or have a large head, wear a ponytail or bun, or curl/style your hair, you may find this item frustrating. The neck opening is long and VERY narrow, requiring the thick fabric to be bunched up then pulled down over your head with some force, taking everything down with it. The fabric is not stretchy, so pulling it on is a real pain. I wear a 7.5 hat and I could barely get it on without a struggle. The volume of my long hair also made the neck fit a little more snug than I like, and the fabric snapped me constantly with static. I can honestly say it's such a pain to put on and so uncomfortably snug, I'd rather just be cold. Maybe I'll give mine to my little niece.<br /><br />Let me just say this - I love the idea and the design. But I feel this definitely needs to be redesigned in a substantially larger size to accommodate those of us with large heads and lots of hair/styled hair."
3.0,Toes hit the tip of the shoe....
3.0,"Not the best quality, very rigid."
3.0,Run on the small size.
3.0,"Very cute, but teeny-tiny!"
3.0,Calf is not wide enough
3.0,"Although I chose XXL but it did not fit . It is narrow from the hip,I think because it made in China  . The material is different from what I have seen on the picture ."
3.0,The necklace just didn’t look right to me. It left a huge area of the back of my neck with just the thin chain over it. It was just too small. The earrings and bracelet are beautiful. Necklace is beautiful too…. Just too small for an adult woman.
3.0,"They hurt my nose (hard plastic) , they fog after not too long at all, and the clip on the back hits my hair in a bad spot."
3.0,"I like the swimsuit but the top is huge! Unfortunately, the top was so big I had to sew it to fit me. And I wear a DD bra."
3.0,"The mask part on the front is only a foam material, not plastic like shown. The front also does not conform fully to your face which allows air to get in at the top, but not enough to where the mask offers no protection. Looks very cool and does keep my face and ears warm like I was hoping. All in all, it's an OK product, with a few adjustments it would easily get five stars from me."
3.0,This was a little thinner than my friend was hoping for. Got it as a gift. Color is nice and it was a good size.
3.0,This bathing suit is really cute but very small and not stretchy
3.0,Imaga was smaller when I received the purse
3.0,The jacket is great. Looks just like the picture. Except i got a small and the arms are super big. I might use it it be comfy on flights something like that. The inside is not the same material as the outside. Also the color is more brown than beige.
3.0,I am size 8 I order 8 1/2 after reading the reviews but was too tide so I order a size 9 it was too small Lol i returned again and ordered a size 10 fit perfect but if you like a little lose to wear with thick Socks 11 might be a better option. I never had to return a shoes so many times I did because I really like the style
3.0,Really comfortable but is a little small. I got a medium and it rides up a lot. The shorts under it don’t hold down like lululemon ones do.
3.0,"Too big, not tight at all.  Looks good tho"
3.0,"Very pretty but the cheapest flowers, I expected more dried than poorly made cheap flowers 🤔"
3.0,"I ordered two sets in different sizes, and when they arrived, they were exactly the same size, which was too small even for the youngest. I have no idea who sizes these things."
3.0,Just ok. Wish they had cup sizes to accomodate ...
3.0,Not bad for the money but I expected better
3.0,Didn't like the print
3.0,"I wanted to love this, but the dress is not full enough to be flattering unless you are thin. I bought a medium and the top fits nice, but the mid section fits awkwardly. It’s just cut wrong."
3.0,The zipper looks cheap. I would also go down a size. It’s super cozy but the quality is lacking.
3.0,The socks are quite thin and I would prefer that they had more grip. They fit okay but I am always slightly concerned that they will slip off as I move from one pose to another. I have another pair of socks with grips on the bottom that I prefer over these because they grip the mat much better.
3.0,The material is really crinkly almost like paper.
3.0,Width slightly small
3.0,I don’t know if this was starting to turn my finger green so I took it off. But it’s so cute! I love it
3.0,Its definitely comes in small and on top of that its very sheer so not the best to work out in...
3.0,"just not what I was expecting, looks big on my face"
3.0,"The idea of this necklace is amazing. I was so looking forward to it. Once I received it and opened the package, I couldn’t help but laugh. The part where the seed is in is a big bulky ball, two half’s glued together. You can see the seem like it’s a child’s home project!<br />I wish it wasn’t so bulky and if you look at photos, it looks like it has bubbles in it, I’m not sure it’s supped look like and act as shimmer or what. It does add a neat effect to it.<br />Now I get it, some may think “well how would they have gotten the seed in there?” Or, “what was she expecting!” yada-yada...<br />In the picture, provided by the seller,  the part where the seed is in looks smaller and like one solid piece, that’s what I was expecting. I was looking forward to gift this, but I guess you get what you pay for! I think I rather let my daughter keep it as a play necklace. Hopefully she won’t swing it around and knock someone’s eye out 😂"
3.0,Every1 loves it but the strapped popped just from hanging on the wall
3.0,"sits high, more like  boys cap.."
3.0,"But this one had a few too many.  I cannot believe I just said that.  I love frills and ruffles.  I bought a small but it felt very frumpy, still.  I'm 5'4 and it was a little too loose and came to my knee.  I'm sure the model must be much taller than I am because it looks cute, short and fitted on her.  Also, the extra ruffles down the sides did not fall well on me at all.  It was just too much.  I have a larger bust, so maybe this was the reason...?  I don't know.  However, I absolutely ADORE the color.  The color is absolutely beautiful and I think it would look fantastic on any skin tone.<br /><br />For your reference, my personal measurements are:<br />Bust: 35<br />Waist: 29 - with a higher natural waistline<br />Hips: 36<br />Height: 5’4<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful!

3.0,not so good quality
3.0,Touchscreen does not work.
3.0,This dress is very voluminous. It bubbles out much more than it appears from the photo and the way the pleats are attached to the top make it very puffy. It looks better with a ribbon tied below the bust to make it an empire waist. I would think you'd always want something on under it as it billows out enough to see everything. I intended to use this as a maternity dress but even in my third trimester it overwhelms my figure. I give it three stars because I do think some people would like wearing it with a ribbon and leggings.
3.0,Couldn’t put it on
3.0,"In the photo it shows two, I only received one... It works fine, just thought there would be two."
3.0,My fault though my grandson in between sizes now. 4t to small 6t to big around waist at least he can grow into them not a waste.
3.0,extra large is sized closer to large
3.0,"These gloves are fairly fragile. The no slip coating on the palms is very quickly gone. By the end of three months all fingers on my gloves are reinforced  with duct tape. They are possibly four star for warmth (though definitely not five), but only three star at best for durability."
3.0,"The material itself is very nice, bright colors! After reading questions and answers I went with an XL but it was too big! The sizes are not true to size in my opinion."
3.0,"Cute jeans, fit really well but I returned because the back pockets had too many rhinestone embellishments for me, which was not pictured!!!!"
3.0,exactly what you pay for
3.0,I love the design but the finish looks more like brass than gold.  A little gaudy for my taste.
3.0,the package was shipped on time I was expecting it to fit better but it is a nice set
3.0,"Pay attention to measurements and pic.  I didn’t.<br />I just went by the word LARGE fabric rose and it’s not large at all.  Then, when i went back to my order,  i see it on a hat.  So it’s larger than a quarter, It’s the size of a half a dollar.  Disappointed."
3.0,Very pretty and soft. Needs some sewing near the hood though. A little tight in the shoulder and button latch is fake leather crap that will crack if water damaged. Good for price though. Better for summer autumn nights. Not for winter really...
3.0,Wears rough. Cute otherwise
3.0,I ordered medium but i feel size is too small
3.0,the coat is well made with a good zipper. it's a little snug on me. it's not as heavy as I'd hoped for winter wear.
3.0,"I love this shapewear, it slims well, especially back fat where the bra is tight.....but my one only issue is that the part that is cut out at the crotch protection out under your clothing with is not very attractive so im gonna purchase a regular one with the crotch."
3.0,"This is a okay top quality-wise. It's lace over stretchy soft fabric with a padded insert you can easily remove and put back in. However, it is very tight and small. It's made for flat chested women who don't have implants. The M/L is super tight on me and I'm a 36B-C. There is no way anyone size C or above could wear this."
3.0,"Did not like the fit uncomfortable, disappointed sorry."
3.0,Looks what you paid for
3.0,I ordered 3 different colors of this dress. The one with the sunflowers fit perfect but this one was too tight.
3.0,Shoes are nicely made but narrow. I must return them.
3.0,"Didn't fit as expected, boxy."
3.0,"These boots close with only the zipper. For any child with thicker legs, this does not work. The laces should exist to cinch or loosen boots like these, but they are literally only there for show. I wish they functioned. The boots would be so cute if my daughter could wear them properly."
3.0,"So I have this bra and intend on keeping it (mainly because I HATE having to go through the whole process; surely you can relate).  This is a very basic bra.  The material is quite thin and I don't feel the least bit sexy when I look in the mirror.  Now I realize this is not the main intention for this particular piece; however, I'm sure many moms out there can relate when I say ""It's nice to feel cute at the very least, when you're basically a feeding machine"".  I should mention, I'm rather large busted.  I am a 34 G/H (depending on the manufacturer).  I ordered the XL.  For a sleep nursing bra...it will do.  However, I cannot in good faith recommend this particular bra.  I know there are better options available.  I actually found one at Target for less, though honestly, not the most attractive out there.  Oh well...the search is still on."
3.0,wore it as a skirt and had a different top over.
3.0,Not as sturdy as I expected. Flimsy and can easily be distorted. The fit is fine .
3.0,The waistband is a bit loose.
3.0,The pants legs were  Way too short
3.0,Fits my need.
3.0,"First of all, I  do like these Sunglasses.  What I  don't  like is when I Changed the lense, it was the Devils own nightmare to get the lense back into the frame.  The video doesn't  help.  It would help if someone would include INSTRUCTIONS  with these glasses.  Thank heaven these frames are flexible.  I  certainly put them to the test!<br />July 31, 2020<br /> Update = =  As I stated before, I won't  change lenses very often.  I just changed lenses and the whole nose piece came off!!  Is this suppose to happen?  I'm not sure if the nose piece will stay on now.  What to do, what to do.  I might need to buy another pair??"
3.0,"I loved this design style and was hopeful, however the dress smelled like hay and was very cheaply made. Returning disappointed."
3.0,"The shade of green is not as pictured.  It is a very dull, muted green, not very attractive. I'm returning it for another color."
3.0,"Love the Hoodie, size runs a bit small."
3.0,It looks like a grown women outfit.  The  young mother love the outfit.
3.0,The Pearl and mount are beautiful.  The chain and clasp are extremely fragile.  I am afraid my wife won't wear the pendant for fear of losing it.
3.0,Cleans the lenses well.However not a defogger.
3.0,Lights seem to malfunction quickly
3.0,I ordered the 3x and it fits like a 2x
3.0,"The necklace color is bronze versus silver — and more importantly, I had an allergic reaction to it. I am not allergic to much. Very few things, two tops, until this. My throat has closed up, I couldn’t breathe, I have been what I thought was sick for days. Until I saw these. I love my necklace but now I can’t wear it."
3.0,"This is the first time in my almost sixty years that I have ordered a product that has absolutely no English directions on how to use it! I find it quite amusing only because Amazon has given me a good idea on how to use it in their description and information about the product before I decided to try it. Otherwise, I think I would have been livid!"
3.0,It fit my body but the arms was to tight !! I didn’t really like the arm part
3.0,"If I wanted paper thin fabric, I’d wear paper. But the green is a deep emerald green & it’s loose where I prefer, at the waist n hips. So I’ll keep it."
3.0,"They were beautiful, however, they turned my fingers green and roasted easily"
3.0,"I like it. It's large enough for my big  head to still have that extra that droops and is stylish, but it does very little in the way of warmth."
3.0,"Very thin fabric, and unlined. My seven year old refuses to wear them because he says that we can see his “junk” when they are wet. 😆 They also run on the large side, and are cheaply made. You have better options out there."
3.0,"3 stars because the material was soft, the print looked nice. I really wanted to like it, but the design wasn't nice enough to be flattering. Elastic around the arms was too tiny, and I have small arms. Really a disappointment."
3.0,"The top is so small, meant for women without breasts"
3.0,Chunky  and a bit Blah.
3.0,"I love the way this looked on the model and I was really hoping it would work on me. Sadly is just doesn’t sit right. I’m 5’6, 125lbs and ordered a medium. It’s way way too short. I’ll sadly have to return it :("
3.0,Did not like the piece of string its on thought it was going to be on a leather like chain and the charm was real small.
3.0,"I wasn't expecting too much from lower priced jeggings, but they are pretty nice. I selected the &#34;black&#34; but it was more of a deep navy color than the deep black the pictures seemed to portray, so that was a little disappointing. They fit really well and run true to size with a good amount of stretch to the waist and legs. One of the buttons on the back right pocket did pop off almost immediately, but it wasn't too hard to put back on. Probably wouldn't buy again just because there are better products, but for a reasonably priced pair of run-around jeggings, definitely not bad."
3.0,order a size larger.
3.0,Runs big. Looks better in the picture.
3.0,"Cute style, but too small."
3.0,Hat feels cheap. Does not fit correctly on my head. Sits sideways
3.0,"Very stiff, small mouth opening"
3.0,I liked the pants overall but they were just too smal.
3.0,It is more narrow than I like. It is probably an inch wide and I like them wider..
3.0,good quality but I really didn't get to try it out because it was too small
3.0,"Very cute, but this runs quite large. It was baggy and did not fit at all like the same size, same brand in other styles of jumpsuit. One would expect consistency."
3.0,"Although it is good quality, it is quite heavy and requires considerable effort to compress the spring  to return to compact size."
3.0,It was smaller than i thought it would be.
3.0,"The tops is adorable and fits good. Dont expect to be able to use the bottoms though. They are very poorly designed. The front and the back are the same size. No room for the smallest of buttcheeks and far more room than needed to cover a hooha. And, oh, so incredibly uncomfortable."
3.0,It wasn't as sturdy as I expected.
3.0,"These were very pretty! But, you get what you pay for. They are very fragile and mine broke after just one wear."
3.0,"This took absolutely forever to ship. When I finally did get it, it was alot cheaper made them I thought it would be. I have worn it a few times and has held up better then I thought, so it's not a total loss. I would tread lightly."
3.0,"Definitely not meant for big busted woman. The waist down was adorable, super cheeky"
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:fd7e115d72346989dc912fa98d35146e]] A decent item, decently made. made of the material that you’d expect from a swimming suit. It comes with a hat so I thought that was an added bonus. Be careful when you wash it because the elastic on the waistband will twist. If you can have the patience to on twist that waistband go for it. Or hand wash the bottoms. Also the waist band has a drawstring that actually functions so that’s also very cool buy a bigger size."
3.0,the size is bigger then should be
3.0,I wish I I could rate this multiple ways. The band is really good quality and very close to what Apple sales for $100 my first impressions but be careful if you have the 49mm Ultra and order the 49mm options. It is very tight to get in smaller wrist like mine so if you have a bigger hand/wrist you will not be able to get this on. Just keep that in mind when ordering.
3.0,"Very pretty, but way too small and very short. May want to order a size or two up."
3.0,"The material is decent for the price. I'm a medium and decided to order a xxl because of so many reviews saying how small it was. It was only a little too big, which is an easy fix. Just remember to order several sizes up."
3.0,It’s a fine shirt but I was hoping for a longer tunic and it’s more of a regular cut shirt
3.0,Tuve que arreglarlo
3.0,"Bought the Small size, fits well except for the sleeves which are short by an inch. Hence can’t use it for running outdoors in cold winter. Good price for a pack of three and good material."
3.0,This is a very cute set but the fabric is very thin with very little support. I use XL but order incorrectly the Large and it fits well so it runs big. It dress well but because the thin fabric is a little see thru. I would not buy it again
3.0,"Loved the dress, but it was WAY to small so I had to return it."
3.0,Quality of fabric was somewhat disappointing.
3.0,"tacky style and scuba like material feels like a wetsuit. the neckline is cut very low and doesn't provide any support. I would say this is not a good dress for any busty or curvy gals, unless you want to be showing off everything. this wasn't a dress I could feel comfortable wearing in public"
3.0,I like them but not a comfortable fit!
3.0,"Very cute shirt, but it runs very small, really cut for jrs."
3.0,"It looks like a regular top in the photo, but it's more like high & low. It looks like a crop top from the front but it covers well down the back. It is also very sheer, undergarments are very clearly visible underneath it."
3.0,"I ordered this dress to wear to Pride. The description says Rainbow and from the pictures it was hard to tell, but when it arrived, I was disappointed to discover it is not Rainbow. It’s still a cute dress, and I’m sure I will wear it again, but the description as “Rainbow” is misleading."
3.0,"It's cute, I give it that, but it is cheaply made and you can tell it. My husband ordered this for me and a surprise and he was greatly disappointed because he thought he was getting something better."
3.0,The hat is really really cute! But the problem is that I don't like at all is how the spikes are plastic and are sew in the hat. I thought they were metal spikes punctured into the hat but I was wrong. So I'm take all the spikes out and putting real spikes through the hat.
3.0,The dress is a little big. And terribly wrinkly. I will see how well it stays after I iron it
3.0,Fit as expected sheer material
3.0,Will not keep will give as a gift.
3.0,Cute but way overpriced!
3.0,"Was great for the first few wears but after that the buckle screw unhinged and hung down, didn't look good after that and was basically useless"
3.0,There's a piece that looks like it was cut off of one of the shoes. The fabric above the lace hole (where your foot goes in) is cut off some how.
3.0,I normally wear size 6-8 pants. I got the large and it was way too small! I could barely even get it up to my butt. Very cute for someone small though
3.0,"No button holes, and buttons where too big for the size of the button space to fit. I had to cut the holes open, but need to buy new buttons that will fit through."
3.0,These are really nice and a cheap dupe for the Quay glasses but they fit quite loose.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:d17663a775f227535f98e8aefc8ee2e9]] This 3 pack of vintage ear cuffs are so adorable but sadly my ears are too small for the cuff part to actually cuff my ear. The bar is really long also and pokes the back of your ear. Overall super cute just not made for small/tiny ears!
3.0,Wore these for 1 winter season so far. I sprayed water proof protection on them. But they still got dirty really fast.  Also notice the fronts were my feet bend starting to crease. I think these are more show and not go. In other words there more for style and not weather. I wouldn't recommend these if using in snow slett etc
3.0,"This is an okay wallet, the bank and other cards can be a little hard to get out and the slots for paper bills is very difficult. That being said, it will hold everything I want it to, even my cell phone and checkbook if I don't want to carry anything else."
3.0,"It’s not like a sweatshirt with the fuzzy inside, its thin, all polyester and not a lot of stretch to it. It is cute though."
3.0,"Works fine.  Does the job.  However, asking me to type 15 more words is just a silly requirement and will make me choose to not rate anything else."
3.0,"These are so short they are way up when your glasses are off your face.  I guess usable for float trips where it's a glasses life jacket, but as a glasses chain, it's a fail."
3.0,Like the way it looks not soft stiff not horrible but not as comfy as regular ones update pattern comes off which sucks Kuz that's the whole draw of these disappointing but love the pattern .... torn
3.0,Way to wide and big way to baggie fitting
3.0,"No comment really , they are small enough but the stud is not long enough , do it does not sit flush on my nose"
3.0,"This came uniquely shrink wrapped &, luckily, the folds and wrinkles only show on the lining!<br />I have some definite likes & dislikes...<br /><br />PROS:<br />- it’s a classic bomber coat style<br />- the sizing is generous - I’m 5’8”, 140 lbs, 36B, wear a Med or Lg in tops - got this in a Medium & it fits with roominess<br />- sleeve length is good + there’s ribbed cuffs, torso length is good + there’s a ribbed hem<br />- there’s shallow side seam pockets<br />- fully lined with same color & soft, t-shirt feeling fabric<br /><br />CONS:<br />- the outside fabric texture looks like a towel<br />- “Sherpa fleece” is 100% polyester & care tag says hand wash or Dry Clean for best results. Groan.<br />- got this in the color Wine & dipping a corner of it in cold water left pink water. Gotta be careful.<br />- front is longer than the back, so I tug at it when zipped up. Fine when worn unzipped.<br /><br />(Thanks for reading this & hope that it’s Helpful!)"
3.0,"The item got here a few days ago, it's a bit too big for me but I think that just has to do with head size 😂"
3.0,Cheesy the fit is off I mean just because they didn't work for me I still recommend them because they may work for you. I got them fast and that was a plus.
3.0,"I measured myself and nearly ordered the small. Something told me to order the medium and so I did. The quality of the fabric is great, the costume would be great if it fit. It feels like the back is too small. When the zipper is zipped up I feel like the neck piece is choking me. Not a tight feel like a turtle neck, but like the back side of the costume is pulling and it is literally choking me. The reason I believe this true is the back does not fit to my body, it sticks off nearly 2-3"". The rest of the costume is body fitting, so why is the back such an issue? It is see thru. You can see even the lightest nude undergarments, so forget it if you have tattoos. The mask is easy to take off and put on, however the neck area near the chin seemed too small and kept sliding out of neck. My cape had a point on it, which I did not want. The picture looked like it may not have it, so I chose to order this one out of the many... Overall I am disappointed with the costume. For the price it was not worth it for me. If you plan to order anyway, size up. I am 5'3.5"" 125lbs and the medium felt too small."
3.0,FUNCTIONAL DESIGN: Our bib pants have removable extensions on the bottom of both legs . My item does NOT have this feature.
3.0,"Bra feels very comfortable on , but it runs very large in the band. I usually wear a 34DD  and ordered this in a  34 and it was huge and I returned and reordered in a 32DD and it fits comfortably  on LAST hook.. Would have gone down to a 30, but it doesn't come that small.  The cups have a nice fit..Good lift and not too low cut, which is often a problem in sports bras for large chests. It also does not give a bad uniboob.. The straps are easy to adjust before you put the bra on- not after (regular  back sliders) and although you really need to put it on over your head, with the upper clasp clasped, the lower clasp is then reasonably easy to reach back and fasten after that  - It is actually a lot easier to get int than  some of the  other &#34;harnesses&#34; I have tried, to get a sturdy running bra!<br /><br />Not sure how it will wear or hold up as I have not yet worn to do a full run, or  laundered. The other La Isla bras I tried were not as well made as the &#34;original&#34; models they copied, but this one seems sturdier, from what I can tell<br /><br />There is still slight bounce (more than with my shock absorber ultra, which I swear by ) but it is better than many other running bras I have tried.  Would be perfectly fine for any lesser impact sport..and even for running, I think, based on my &#34;trial run in the mirror!&#34;. Overall, for the money, (at  almost a fourth of the cost of the Shock Absorbers) it seems worth it...even to have as a spare.  Not sure yet if it will get that mildewy odor from sweat that the shock absorber gets in the center front band area - even with regular washing.."
3.0,EXTREMELY LONG!!! Quality not quite what I would have liked it to be. Don't think it will last long.
3.0,"The description said 140lb 100% cotton, which was good and why I bought it. However it did not state that it was for silk screen printing not watercolor painting. The paper gets bent very easily, like when you touch it. So getting it off the roll with out ruining it is tricky. I would not have purchased it if I had known that."
3.0,Dress was a Large but felt more like a medium. I may wear it but not much.
3.0,I like skinny clothes but these are super tight
3.0,not bad but not good either
3.0,"It is a good product ,reasonable price"
3.0,"Overall this cosplay was great for the price, but there were a few issues. The skirt was incredibly short. Like, shorts had to be worn underneath for fear of flashing someone lol. And the socks came up way too high, top of the thigh like a stocking. Other than those two things, solid cosplay once you take a steamer to the wrinkles! Fabric was also pretty comfortable."
3.0,Downgraded rating because &#34;gold&#34; has already worn off charm.  Still looks decent.
3.0,"The fabric on this color is different than on the solid colors. And the fit is closer. The print is a bit odd, like graph paper. It looks cheap compared to the black one I own."
3.0,I love anything Mickey Mouse. The shirt was advertised as a Men’s tee. I am a woman and ordered the Men’s Medium. The fit was smaller than expected for a Mens Medium. The shirt is attractive and of good quality. Order a size larger than you need.
3.0,I returned this product because it looked too cheap
3.0,Like many Halloween costumes not is not made very well. Fit is snug in the waist and big in the shoulders.
3.0,OK FOR KEY CHAIN
3.0,"Bigger than I expected, and the ""stick"" part of one of them is crooked. I did like that they are two separate parts, so you can wear the hoops separately (they are a nice size med-lg hoop) or use the sticks with other earrings - I think it looks cool with bar studs.<br />But they do not seem like great quality."
3.0,"Pretty cheap material, not sure how well it's going to hold up, but it wasn't expensive so I guess you get what you pay for.<br /><br />Print does look nice on it, identical to pictures."
3.0,I ended up returning them bc I could not walk in them. So stiff and the opening was so small and made it hard to put my feet through when I had thick socks on.<br />Made me sad bc I love the look but not comfortable at all.
3.0,The lights are a bit large for me. Kind of heavy for my neck.
3.0,"It’s cute, debating on returning it. Definitely won’t be purchasing others."
3.0,"These are so hip looking, I loved them! However I did need to return as they were just a bit tight/ narrow when I would walk so they were uncomfortable for my flat feet."
3.0,Nice dress but just size up . I bought this dress from the size chart but it was the wrong thing I did . I should’ve bought xxl
3.0,"The quality of the belt seems very good.  The leather and buckle have a solid, strong feel.  The appearance is what I expected.  I seem to be to large for the belt.  I must have confused the description of the belt with another one as I was shopping because I expected it to be extra long and needing to be sized down.  I also misunderstood the description and thought the ratchet section ran the majority of it's length.  The toothed section is just over 7 inches long and not close enough to the end of the belt to make it useful for me.<br /><br />If you are much over a size 42 keep shopping."
3.0,I wanted to LOVE this but it was an awkward shape on me. Way too big in the arms and chest. Also looked satiny in the pictures. It's just tshirt material. The color was great though!
3.0,this is a heavy and sturdy bracelet ..it was nice but I had to return it because it was a little too small for my guy other than that perfect.
3.0,I give it a three stars because the product ends can only be attached to reading glasses with ultra slim ends. The product ends on these croakies are not adjustable at all.Probably a good product but should specify the part that fits much more than it currently does.
3.0,"They look great, but the size was WAY off, at least 2 sizes too small. I gave them to my daughter. I usually wear a size 9, ordered a size 10 just in case, but they turned out to be a size 8 ( fit my daughter).  I am debating if a size 11 will fit....but for the prize, it might be worth it"
3.0,"The pants are fine except for the remains of a large sticky label on the front.  When the label was removed, glue fragments were left on the pants meaning that they will have to be washed before I can wear them.  The company needs to find better glue for the label and needs to make the label smaller."
3.0,It is ok... A little bulky and has gold zippers. I thought silver
3.0,I usually order medium from amazon for clothing as their size is smaller than US size however this is a way too big and the material is cheap.
3.0,It's pretty but I should have ordered the smallest size available. I'm 5'7&#34; and skinny. It's huge on me and the arm length barely reaches my wrists. Returning because if I get a smaller size the arms will not be long enough.
3.0,"They are cute, the foot fits to size but they just did not fit my 15 inch calves, :(  Had to return them."
3.0,"The large size is only large in terms of length. The elastic cuff in particular was way too tight on my arm.  Deal breaker.  Too bad, because I liked the material compared to 3 other brands of arm coolers I ordered. The fabric felt nice, not too heavy, not to light.  Could be great if you've got long skinny arms."
3.0,"I like it, but it already cracked on the side. I guess it goes to show you get what you pay for."
3.0,"These looked amazing, great quality. Downside is they aren’t very streatchy. I’m 5’11 and these were just too short."
3.0,The dress is cute but is a little sheer so you need undergarments. Also the belt loops are not aligned on the dress. One of mine was sewn at the waist and the other was sewn below the waist in the striped part of the dress so I am going to have to take it off and sew it on at the waist.
3.0,"Good material, I ordered a small and it definitely fits snug."
3.0,It's an overall okay shirt but I usually wear a medium in shirts but I ordered the large for this particular shirt and it fit a little snug.
3.0,"Weird fit. I’m a medium built, but the fit was really tight. Definitely but a size bigger if you don’t want these to stick to your skin."
3.0,Sending it back. It just didn't fall like the hat in the pic. Its a tight fit as well. I'm a natural black chick with a head full of hair....lol<br />It also had the wire in it like an underwire bra which I didn't like
3.0,"This is not what I expected. I think of henleys as cotton or cotton blends with shoulder stitching that veers inward from armpit to chest to neck. This was thin polyester material, ribbed. More like a tunic than a henley. I'm not a fan. Stitching was sloppy. Loose threads. Ugh."
3.0,"First, I'd like to point out that this is definitely not 100% cotton. I don't think it's even part cotton, it's some sort of Rayon. It's also a robe, not a kimono. These two things annoyed me because it clearly states that it's a 100% cotton kimono in the description. These two things aside, the robe is nice enough and it fits well."
3.0,"I like the style if these glasses quite a lot, the beveled edges make everything have a sort of prism effect when You're looking around.<br />I love the rectangular shape and that these look great on anyone!<br /><br />These are the perfect unisex glasses and my husband and I often just trade them.<br />I also have a pink pair of the same style which I gotta say He looks great in those too!<br /><br />I really like the more vintage style sunglasses and I wear them often, they are great to give a bit of softness in harsher lights.<br />Though they help with sunlight, they are obviously not as effective as the darker glasses would be.<br />But I still really like these, for comfort and style.<br /><br />My only complaint is that after several wears the glasses lense separated from the bridge hardware, and it could/should have been a simple fix, but the complimentary tools included for the glasses aren't even compatible with the hardware, so the glasses are broken and not something that can be repaired.<br />Not the end of the world, but certainly disappointing.<br />Considering price point I suppose it might be expected, but if I could suggest anything it would be to include the right tools for the hardware used on the glasses.<br />My husband said He had noticed that the screws were coming loose but He couldn't tighten them because the hardware and tools,were incompatible.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give these three stars, I think had they held a bit longer that would for sure affect the final rating as would the tools and hardware.<br />The Set comes with the glasses, a soft carrying case, a cleansing cloth, and a double sided miniature screwdriver (flat and Philips head)."
3.0,"I had this product less than a month, the straps already broke and I did not have anything heavy in there! Very few items at most: Wallet, phone, keys, and a small water bottle the straps snapped!"
3.0,Loved it out of the package! Looked great on but the plastic adjuster on the spaghetti strap broke and I had to tie it up to get through the day.  So disappointed!!
3.0,"The pieces started to come apart, over all, it worked for me"
3.0,Color is a little more purple blue than a true blue. The bottom of the dress clings to the ankles. It gets narrower. I thought it was going to be a little more free flowing. Super soft fabric and light weight and comfortable!
3.0,Nice dress but length was too short even though they contacted me for measurements.  I had added an inch to my measurement for the length thinking I could hem it if it was too long.  Quite the opposite. Now I will have to wear flat shoes with this dress.
3.0,"It's ok, not that great of quality, the material is a bit thin."
3.0,The quality of these panties looks good but they are NOT waist high. The picture does not represent the product. These are bikini panties.
3.0,"Cheap product, but worth the price."
3.0,Looks great but flimsy material. Bad quality. Not worth the money. Fits not so great. Not machine washable. Got a lot of compliments though.
3.0,It’s okay— material  is soft— but it’s poly or nylon. Large print
3.0,"This is a great product.  However the adults I know, would prefer more adult subjects than cartoon characters that no one knows.  For that reason I only gave it 3 stars."
3.0,There was white paint flecked onto the front of most of these that I had to scratch off with my finger nail.
3.0,The material is too thin and fragile!
3.0,Good idea but
3.0,"Nice Black Bandanna, 2.99 is a good price but the s&h is over priced.  I bought it anyway, sometimes shopping from home is convenient but costly :)"
3.0,Took forever to get
3.0,"These are nice quality gloves. However, I wear a size medium glove -- I wear gloves everyday at work, so I know my size. If I have my nails done then I need a large, but otherwise a medium. These gloves were way too small for me. I could get my hand into them but then could not move my fingers LOL. No good. I did not send them back b/c I gave them to my daughter, but unless you have a small hand, this is not your glove."
3.0,"Nurse in a LTC facility, I wear these 8+ hours a day. They fog, but pretty comfortable."
3.0,I ordered a small and it looks like it should fit a 10 year old girl
3.0,It took a lot of time to get this shiny enough to look good
3.0,"The design is fine, but the quality of the fabric is fatal"
3.0,I liked those slippers but they were just too narrow for my feet. I returned them. It would be nice if they had a wide size.
3.0,"The scarves are really cute! My only issue is that they're not as long as I expected them to be and they're REALLY thin 😔 (hence me only giving 3 stars 😬) Aside from the &#34;sliding off my head&#34; struggle...they're cute scarves. Also, they don't give me that fullness that I was expecting but still cute scarves."
3.0,"Really like these pants. Says they run big, but I am not sure. Order for American size accordingly."
3.0,Came with 4 but one was missing a stone. Pretty disappointed about that. Love the look of the remainig 3.
3.0,"Nice Shirt, Nice Color, Very Soft, Over Priced & Pilled On The First Wash! Found the same shirt from another seller for $5.00 cheaper! Pillled on the first wash, Should I have turned inside out to wash? My fault or just the material! IDK Fits well & Fast shipping!"
3.0,Very tiny for the $  less than a dime in size.  Not worth the $
3.0,"I had to return these shirts because I just didn't like the way they fit. I'm the thinnest I have been in a long time, but I don't care for how tight they were around the belly area. Perhaps they are fine for a different body type, just not mine."
3.0,I bought it for a wedding party.and it arrived at time<br />After this party two sones fell out!
3.0,"I would have said Great if they were not falling apart after I got them out of the packaging. I was able to wear them one time and the inside piece of the backing has come out. I will have to purchase backs for them. Other than that, they are a nice colorful pair of earrings."
3.0,I wear a 10/12 and got this in a L. This shirt material is super thick feeling and not as soft as I hoped. I was so excited about this shirt but because its so heavy it also clings to your belly/areas you may not want! A little bummed about the fit :(
3.0,"Worked well for a Halloween party, but the wig was not as full as the picture shows."
3.0,"I like the size of this bag. Not too large and not too small. I should hold my iPad, glasses,phone and a whole lot more. There are a few pockets on the inside so that should help me keep organized. The outside has enough pockets and zippers that I can put my more used items there. I chose the purple to match my luggage. I have found it had ripped on the inside."
3.0,Looks good and looks too small. Unable to tell because I haven't been able to open it.
3.0,I have a large head and it was quite large for my head.
3.0,They were wonderful when I first received them but my turquoise was already cracked & 2 of the 3 bracelets popped within 2 weeks i guess bc i never took them off & when in tried to they flew off as they popped! If the string can be replaced with an elastic stretchy type band I’d order them again! The string is not too sturdy
3.0,"This was delivered next day, with good packaging.. it heats up quite quickly. I started with high for about 5 minutes, then dropped to medium. about 10 minutes, its on the lowest setting and still works well. Only real problem, it's marked as XXL, but not even close. I would say its a large. there is a good 10 inches of space between the zipper. even tight in the shoulders<br />+"
3.0,"These are nice but the smallest size came with only one earring, not a pair like was supposed to."
3.0,"I loved these earrings, but one broke very easily within 2 months."
3.0,The sleeves fit very tight.
3.0,I ordered two pairs of these and one of them that they sent me was marked the right size but there's no way it didn't even come close to fitting me. The other one did fit but was so long that I had to cut off a good 4-in off of the leg just so I can fit in them. Now I'm short so I usually have to hit my pants but they were crazy along and super super thin. It's great during the summertime but definitely not during the winter.
3.0,Cute but a bit to small
3.0,Strap broken in package.  It did come with cool things
3.0,"this dress is small, i'm normally a L but if i had to reorder i would get a XL. The dress i received is pink not red and the color is faded in parts of the dress"
3.0,Too small for the money spent
3.0,These were difficult for my boyfriend to put on and they don’t even look like dress socks! They were pretty cheap tho so at least I’m not out a lot of money.
3.0,"I don't like that there are adjustable pads to cover your breasts. I'd rather the padding be fixed in place. However, there are slots under the arms where you can adjust the foam so it fits correctly. Just be aware that you can see the foam through the fabric (it's like a light tan foam so you can see it through the pink, green, and blue. The black one has black foam so it's not noticeable)."
3.0,Product itself is very cute. The problem was with the packaging. The hat was shoved tightly in the bag with a shirt I purchased. The shirt was fine but the hat was mangled a bit. I was able to get mist of the hat back into shape but one of the ears flops backwards and wont stay up.
3.0,I wish the arms were longer and the sleeve ends were all the same fabric. Other than that it’s warm and cozy.
3.0,It was cool for like 2 days then broke it was a good idea but you should make stronger wires
3.0,"I did not like the polyester feel of this material. I was hoping it'd be made of a stretch cotton/ spandex, like a t-shirt. I am between sizes M and L. I ordered an XL, and it was way too big."
3.0,littel to narrow
3.0,"Fit is good. Not very thick though, still feel the cold breeze when riding."
3.0,Very pretty piece. The only issue I have it that the gold coated chipped from the post of the piece when I was cleaning it before inserting. Hopefully it won't peel any further but other than that I like the piece...very flattering.
3.0,The material was nice and I liked the fit except it was too short. The tie came up above my pants line and that’s not where I wanted it.
3.0,"Love the feel, a little to short for me but manageable.  I have a feeling the threads in the waist band will not last very long as they are transparent."
3.0,"It is as shown but I don't find it to be wearable. I was under impression it was smaller but it's around 1.5 inches long and a very long chain. I gave it to my 14 year old niece and she wears it often, though!"
3.0,Too thin for me!
3.0,These would be nice if they didn’t give me a headache.  I bought them to use when I knit and crochet.  But can’t wear them for more that 30 minutes without getting a headache.
3.0,I received the wrong dress but the color was right I was going to return it but I decided to keep it. It's a very huggable dress
3.0,"Plenty of space, pockets for keys, phone, headphones, and water bottle. The main pocket is huge for extra pair of shoes or bigger water bottle too. Only complaint I'd say is the draw strings are on the thicker side, so it doesn't provide as much slack as I'd like on these type of bags, but it's a good trade-off for the amount it can carry. Plus side there's two carrying handles so you can just use your hands as well!"
3.0,It runs a little bit big.<br />The price is too high since it has no pocket for phone or key... too bad
3.0,"The look of this watch is great, and it’s fairly lightweight. I gave it to my boyfriend as a birthday gift, and he loves it. He gets compliments on it all the time! However, it does not appear to be very durable. Several links broke while trying to adjust the size, so be careful. But for the price it’s not a bad buy!"
3.0,"I have a thin wrist and have never worm a watch in my life (I'm 36) the band that come with the Garmin Instinct didn't have a hole that worked with my wrist. I found this and it works much better but isn't the best quality. Very comfortable, you don't really feel it but it does get itchy when wet and the part that connects to the watch isn't made great clearly looks like it  isn't a natural band for the watch... If that makes sense."
3.0,"Ordered a small (flat chested), but it was much shorter in the torso than expected."
3.0,it was bit large for my daughter
3.0,it broke as soon as i got it out of the package
3.0,It’s good but expensive a little bit.
3.0,"Good gloves, but with every day use, my hands are getting calluses, which hasn't happened with normal cycling until I started using these gloves."
3.0,Good fabric but too large in the waistband.
3.0,I'm a size 9.5.  These are comfortable but feel kind of tight on my feet.  I have to take them off after an hour.  They should fit nicely if you are a size 8 or smaller since they won't slip on you.
3.0,"Shirt comes with saying ""the tour stopped here"" not as pictured stops here!"
3.0,Fit good but quality is not what I expected…
3.0,Watch face is nice but band is very cheaply made. Not shocked by this due to the price.
3.0,"doesn't keep my hands as warm as I thought they would, but I added a smaller extra glove inside"
3.0,"Cute, good quality. But ran very small. Rather than do a return we just gave them away to a friend a few sizes smaller."
3.0,It was a real snug fit I expected it to be more roomier being a adult XL.
3.0,It says 16g but I can’t get it through my nose
3.0,No tiene comprensión
3.0,"It did not fit as I expected the hip down was not fitted enough for me, but top half fit fine"
3.0,Color a little too light
3.0,"The shorts fit amazing! However, considering I️ bought these shorts to workout, I️ do HITT training, the material isn’t has form fitting as I️ would like it to be. It kind of feels similar to wearing yoga pants? I️ wanted a little more compression to the shorts. The length was nice :)"
3.0,Lens scratched too easily :/ Kept them in the bag it came in and seems the material isn't the best for protecting the shades.
3.0,Looks good on pictures. In real it is bit cheap. The quality is not so great. Not sure how material would be after few washes.<br /><br />During this pandemic we had to do my son's birthday on Zoom.the dress looked okay on the cam.<br /><br />For the same price you could find better brands.<br /><br />Not very happy with my purchase.
3.0,"Donated them. we were lookin for more of a cargo pant, this was like a jeans material. Too girly for my man !"
3.0,Cute true to size but it’s okay for real
3.0,"For smaller sized feet, not for sizes over a 9. However, the material is very rich."
3.0,"The items run small. I ordered what I thought was my size and it was snug. The underwear itself is nice and looks good and is comfortable without the padding. The padding is kind of hard but it definitely makes butt look bigger, maybe too much. It’s a good deal for the price."
3.0,"I like the fit, but flared not fitted by the knee as pictured. And this was the reason I bought it."
3.0,Its pretty but if you are an older woman order 1 size up.  OK for teens with great legs.
3.0,The product looked very nice. Very hard to adjust for size. No English instructions for assistance.
3.0,"It was nice n cute looking set but the is not correctly mentioned on the site. L was max available but not the true size as stated in the size chart. Material was nice n soft, color was also very cool, liked it but could not keep it due to wrong size description."
3.0,"Aussie Chiller Bushie Perforated Hat does keep the sun off your head,but it doesn't sit far enough down on my head as I would like & although I have not gotten it wet yet I can only hope it will keep it's shape better than the one my friend has."
3.0,love the bag -- perfect size for what I need -- but strap broke
3.0,"Too short, material too thick"
3.0,I really do like the earrings but I haven't worn them. The pearl is a lit bigger than I would like. Still very nice. Will give them as a gift.
3.0,"Sturdy, but occasionally the straps will slide and create a point where it dogs in in front of your armpit"
3.0,"Earmuffs do the trick at keeping your ears warm, but the fuzz did cause my earlobes to itch after wearing for 5 minutes."
3.0,Material appeared to be like sweater cloth type but very thin not very warm for those cozy tea or coffee mornings
3.0,Pretty fabric but runs small and not at all stretchy so can be uncomfortable if too tight.
3.0,"Well first off, this is not a steel boned corset!!! You get what you pay for and you will not get a steel bonded corset for this price!  I decided to see what they would send me and kept it because it is quite nice and will probably use it for some burlesque performances. Nicer than what I was expecting for the price. The fasteners in the front are pretty cheap though and seems like they might be sharp so I will be cautious when putting it on."
3.0,"Bought this since I've been seeing it everywhere. And this was a little shorter than what I thought. I am 5'4, 7 mos pregnant and have hips, thighs and a butt. It was cute but I did order one from shein that was a more preferred material that I liked and was a bit longer than this one. I'd recommend if you're comfortable with shorter dresses/skirts. Material wasnt bad just not something I like."
3.0,Moisture from my nose can now been seen on the outside. Wanted more form fitting design it moves every time I talk
3.0,Just not totally in love with white pants on me.
3.0,"The hat is well made and it is adjustable. The emblems on the front look nice, but they would be better if they were patches or embroidered. These are more like iron-on decals. Only time will tell how long they will last..."
3.0,"Cute piece, if a bit on a cheap side, but that's what you get for the price. I was hoping that the wings would be spring-loaded or at least linked so that they open/close at the same time, but that's just not the case. My daughter enjoys it and that's what really matters."
3.0,"Although I love the material, print and the way it fit. I washed it one time and it faded tremendously!!!"
3.0,"Smaller than I anticipated, even with the model these looked bigger than they actually are"
3.0,Top part very small.  What a Shame.  I usually  wear  M size  and got XL . The bikini  was ok.  Very small  for a cup D
3.0,The pants didn't fit but the bra did!
3.0,"The Bulldog wasn’t centered, it was too high on the hat"
3.0,Good for backups... Will continue buying the Calvin Kleins as they are much more substantial.
3.0,"Wow! I prefer large purse/shoulder bags, and even having notes the dimensions, was still slightly worried this bag might be on the snug side.<br />Upon receipt, it was clear I had concerned myself needlessly!<br />This is a very roomy bag... in fact, it's not really a purse at all, but more a Messenger Bag, easily accomodating a 15&#34; laptop!  Although due to insufficient padding, I wouldn't recommend carrying one without some type of protective sleeve.<br />The outer fabric has a light coating making it likely water/rain resistant.<br /><br />The main compartment can also easily handle several Manila file folders, books, and a comfortable load of personal items (wallet, makeup bag, etc.) for daily use.<br /><br />The attached tags indicate this bag is from Oilily's 2012 Speing-Summer Product line-up. (Hence, the low price! ($28.99)<br /><br />Although not the &#34;purse&#34; I thought I'd ordered, due to its Oilily branding and charming fabric, I would've kept this llightweight, yet sturdy Carry-All to use as a bookbag, but it arrived with a large 5&#34; gash on the back side.<br />The fabric & protective poly bag were clearly slashed.<br />Since the outer packaging was intact, I can only surmise  this is a returned item that was just re-sold & sent out again.<br />It really angers me when this sort of thing occurs. Such a waste of my time and everyone else's who will have to handle this defective product once again.<br /><br />Even had the item not been defective, I still would've only awarded it &#34;3 Stars&#34;, simply because it's an odd bag in that it's not padded enough for toting one's electronics or camera gear, yet it's too large for a purse. It could be used as an office or book bag, as long as one doesn't weigh it down too much.<br /><br />For those interested in strap-drop: The attached two handles will fit over one's shoulder as long as a heavy coat isn't worn (and your arms are relatively slender). There is a long, detachable shoulder strap as well, allowing the bag to be worn cross-body.<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br />-CC, Amazon Prime Member-Reviewer"
3.0,"The ring is fine, but I ordered gold tone and it appears to be rose tone."
3.0,no compression
3.0,"These are okay, sometimes they don't lay flat on your wrist  all nice and side by side like in the photo. Also they are about $1 on E bay"
3.0,"Love the way the pad looks on the desk, the shape is cool, and size is really good. The problem is the USB connections. I have only been able to plug one thing into the pad, if I try to plug my phone into to charge as well it is way too slow. So...can't imagine plugging four things in."
3.0,The height of the hat is really tall--it almost looks like a cross between a fedora and a top hat. Looked odd. Too bad because it looked cute on the model (But doesn't it always??)
3.0,"I was impressed by the material and overall quality, but they ride up like crazy. I tried to get used to them for a few weeks but ended up throwing them away."
3.0,"It arrived over a week late.  Also, the material is technically felt (I guess) BUT incredibly hard and unyielding.  It doesn't stretch at all and the inner rim is actually sharp somehow.  That said, it is cheap so if you roll better on the delivery dice it could be acceptable."
3.0,"They are so bright & cute! They were SUPER SILKY SOFT straight outta the bag! But, I guess my husband shouldn’t have dried them in the dryer 😞 Now they just feel like regular pjs, lol! Still cute but just not nearly as silky smooth!"
3.0,Too big. Won’t stay put. Slides down face. Will have to bring in the seams. I ordered another brand earlier in the pandemic that are a much better fit.
3.0,I was very disappointed when I opened this package.  I had purchased to give as a gift but was ashamed to give it.  It is in my jewelry box waiting for another occasion........charm was way too small and looked like it should be for a child.
3.0,"Cheap, cheap product."
3.0,"I like product, but just a little more fitted around the bottom area than expected."
3.0,"Update- seller did refund our money for the broken grommets<br />We like the bag, it’s a good size and has a couple pockets. After about a month of using it, the grommets are breaking off of the fabric. Not sure how well the fabric will hold up with the string rubbing against it now."
3.0,"These ankle boots are cute but they are very narrow. My feet are usually too narrow for most shoes and these are a little snug at the sides of the transverse arch. I'm not sure why the color is described as &#34;rust&#34; because it's actually light tan and the toes are more pointed than rounded. Overall, I like them but wish they were a little wider so they would be more comfortable."
3.0,The posts are very short.  Okay if you have skinny earlobes.
3.0,Cute and my daughters loved them but after a few uses all the material unravels. I tried to use gorilla glue to put them back on but it keeps coming off and it’s too much trouble.
3.0,It fits okay but the picture in the description wasnt all tangled like mine came. I’m debating returning it since it doesn’t sit flat on my wrist but is all bunchy.
3.0,"This dress is a good Summer dress, very light weight, comfortable, and the pattern is as pictured.  The only issue I had was with the chest/under the arms.  It was way too large/wide and I had to wear a bandeau underneath.  I have a large bust and read the other reviews about the arms being too wide so I sized down and my bra was still very visible on the sides."
3.0,"these socks are pretty but they run small. there is some stretch. The black heels needed positioning in order to fit my foot. My major reservation was when I turned one inside out. It was just a tangle of strings. They didn't affect how othe socks felt on. They are comfortable but they do make me question longevity after a few washes. These are advertised as men's socks. They may be but they are definitely sized for women. size up of they will be too tight. I didn't notice any moisture-wicking. The socks are made from cotton, spandex and elastic. Interesting patterns but small sizing and quality concerns  make me less than enthuses."
3.0,"I’m 5’4, 115 pounds. Small fits well. Design and color is just as pictures; very nice. I’m not too crazy about material though. Fabric is not very soft and fits kind of stiff; not stretchy at all."
3.0,The product is as written. and for 9.99 they are pretty darn good and will fit right I  with the rest of my jewelry
3.0,"During pregnancy swelling phase, my usual nursing and regular bras became too snug. i needed an extra comfortable bra, and this was not it. got returned. More details about it below...<br /><br />Numerous bras tried:<br />-- Band Bamboo Women's Seamless nursing Bra Padded-- 1st place in best comfort. Got kept, and another purchased.<br />-- Soft French Terry Nursing Sleep Bra for Maternity-- Tied 1st place in best comfort. Got kept, along with other 1st place winner because the two were different styles of bra. this is more of a sleep bra, no clasps, just slip on and off. The elastic at base is over a wider width, so pressure was better distribuated than the other non-clasp-sleep-bras (Veami and Cakye).<br /><br />--Mirity Women's Seamless Maternity Nursing Bra- 2nd place in best comfort. Appearance more flattering than 1st place comfort, I tried hard to keep it, but because it wasn't most comfortable (though it was close!), it got returned.  I think a big factor was this had standard # of clasps at back, whereas first place winner Band Bamboo had an extra # of clasp so allowing it to be wider around if necessary.<br />-- CAKYE Women's Nursing Tank Sleep Bra For Nursing-- not even close. not ranked. not comfortable. I think it was a chinese one with foreign written tags (side point). mainly just not the best comfort.<br />-- CAKYE Women's Lace Sleep Bra Yoga Bra-- not nice, but that's subjective!  Someone else may like it! For me, the lace and overal style seemed like something my grandmother would wear. plus not that comfortable. returned.<br />--VEAMI Nursing Sleep Bra-Dune Blush-- the elastic band going around at base is relatively prominent. not comfortable. this got returned."
3.0,I didn't like it as I wanted to. It looked a lil cheap and the blue was a lil faded blue. Returned
3.0,"The Magenta -pink is a beautiful vibrant color. The cotton fabric is thinner than I prefer for salvar pants. It is not a soft comfortable fabric like my other salvars. The cotton fabric is stiff and scratchy. It has a chemical smell also. I will edit my review if I find washing removes the stiffness, scratchiness and odor of the salvar. I will keep them as they will do for now and continue to look for a higher quality product."
3.0,"The shoes looks nice,but they too narrow even for a regular feet, my son have skinny feet and this shoes are quite tie for him."
3.0,Tried to put one in my cartilage and it was to small for the ball to go on. I’m hoping my girls will be able to wear them in their ears.
3.0,I wanted to love this skirt! The pics of it are so cute. But the material feels cheap and is super thin. You will definitely have to wear something underneath. Wish it came lined at least. The quality is a bit disappointing.
3.0,"The chain turned blackish gross only after wearing a couple of times. I never showered with it on or to sleep. The pendant still looks good, but I will be replacing the chain. I would not buy this item again unless it was gold filled."
3.0,I got xl and it’s literally smaller than my large Calvin Klein underwear of a similar style. If it weren’t for that they’d be pretty decent
3.0,It’s swimsuit material
3.0,Nice pattern. Fits as expected. I’m 5’6”. 145 pounds. I ordered a large. I always order a large from stores from outsides ths US.  Not crazy about the polyester material  But for the money it’s a nice dress. BTW The skirt is white on the inside
3.0,Cute but not exactly like the photo. Expected a thicker quality sweatshirt and this was very thin. Disappointing. Size up one if you want it baggy.
3.0,These pouches are sufficient enough but I gave them 3 stars because the fabric is a little more lightweight than I expected.
3.0,"I guess I ordered the wrong size, they were to big!"
3.0,It claims that it fits ALL/MOST oversized Dolce and Gabana sunglasses. I have a typical pair of D&G aviators and they do not fit. I will be returning the product.
3.0,"The sweater fit is ok, and the style is good, but the knit looks quite cheap.  I wish I'd returned it because I never wear it."
3.0,"I don’t recived  this item white the original box, I don’t believe the original watches"
3.0,It fit alittle tight.
3.0,"Although these moccasins are cute, don't bother to size up for your kid expecting they can wear them now, and still be able to wear them next season too.  They won't hold up that long.  I bought two pairs for two kids.  The inside fur sole comes unglued and drives my kid crazy, and the outside soles also came loose at the toe very quickly.  Ugh."
3.0,The jacket is perfect size for a 7-8 yr old. The pants however look like they would fit a 4 yr old.
3.0,Very pretty but the space to go around the nipple is way too small!!
3.0,"is a little on the short side,wish it would sit higher on the head,will keep it"
3.0,"Why three stars, Because I'm undecided.<br />Ill give pros and cons you decide.<br />Pros. Very inexpensive, very comfortable. Thin everywhere except double ""pouch"".<br />Cons. Waistband not covered as advertised,  legs ride up but short so expected. Waistband rolls, 2 pair already had little holes. ""Pouch"" isn't.  Not much room.<br />Not sure how long rest will last because holes before even wearing some of them.<br />Will update longevity after some use."
3.0,"This is a very baggy/boxy shirt. The sleeves were way too short as well as the length in the front of the shirt (although I'm taller than average.) I tried to go up a size which lead to a bigger, boxier shirt with baggy, too-short sleeves. Loved the color and concept of this top but it just didn't work for me. Had to return."
3.0,"Crown too tall, does not fit well."
3.0,Just a cut red T but still looks good with ome nice Jean's and fresh shoes
3.0,"Black version of this dress fit perfectly. Bought this one in same size and definitely larger, didn't shrink at all. Will probably alter myself. Love the color."
3.0,Really cute dress - NO POCKETS!
3.0,"I was excited about receiving this maxi dress. I have an upcoming beach trip so I thought I'd get a flowy maxi dress to wear out to dinner, etc. I am 5'6"" and am usually a 10, but can range from an 8 to a 12 depending on the style of dress. So I went ahead with a Large as I also have a larger bust (34DD). It fit awkardly and when I tugged it down, it made me look like my hips were wide. If I pulled it up it made it look like I was covering up a baby bump.  It might look better sizing down, but I think I'll go with something else. The material is comfortable and the length was right at the tops of my feet. I just wish it didn't make me look frumpy."
3.0,"No me agrado la barba y el cabello que trae, porque se suelta fácilmente los hilos"
3.0,This is a beautiful heart. Chain is very delicate. The whole for ashes is very small which only allows very limited ashes inside. The funnel provided didn't work well. Had to improvise.
3.0,I got these to wear over leggings to walk during the slightly darker hours. These are too small but they are also my goal.
3.0,Too big- wouldn't let me exchange
3.0,"I am 5'6"", weigh 123 with a fairly flat stomach. The way this dress is made, it makes your stomach look bigger. It also was way too short on me so I returned it"
3.0,IT MOVED AROUND ON MY ARM. I LIKE THE APPLE STILE BAND MUCH BETTER.
3.0,"It fits as expected. On the other hand, I don't like the material. It should have been made out of cotton."
3.0,"First off, the price was very reasonable so feel somewhat reluctant to say anything derogatory.  The earrings look good but the closing clasp is too loose for my liking.  Nor sure how long it will last."
3.0,I thought an xlarge would fit me but it was too small if i raised my arms the shirt showed all of my belly area... Not a pretty sight 😂. Cute blouse but too small.
3.0,Thy are ok....
3.0,"The scarf is pretty and it's soft, but it also feels flimsy. I can already see how the edges are going to shred. For $19.00 I expected a scarf that would last more than one season. I'll enjoy this while I can but not buy another one like it."
3.0,"I purchase 5 dresses for my wife and the size number placed on a XL but the dresses are more like 3xl, unfortunately she won't be able to wear them until she hems them, Due to current situation, we are afraid that if we send them back they will take another year before they are returned to her."
3.0,Beautiful dress but it didn’t arrive in time. Was too big so it had to be taken in but design and color are gorgeous
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:9a903a44a353e12309717eb9c5318e25]] Muy poca luz, podrían conservar el modelo pero mejorarle la luz"
3.0,"This dress is super cute. However the XS is slightly too big. I’m 5’1 and 100 pounds and  the top is slightly too long. I’ll either have to return the dress or have it altered. For now, I pinned the shoulders and I’ll decide weather it’s worth paying to have it fit me properly. I think if you have a long torso, it should fit."
3.0,Would of been nice if it actually had supported in the top and wasn't too small
3.0,"My son thought this mask was cool, but he couldn’t breathe well in it."
3.0,Seams are coming apart already
3.0,Washed 1time and already unraveling.. cute but not very well made
3.0,Too small for a medium
3.0,It's a pretty pair of earrings but it is poorly made and will not last.<br />The hinge is loose and they don't clasp tightly
3.0,"The product would be sufficient if the quality was better. The 2 masks arrived in the pouch.  One had a nose wire, and the other did not (and the band was attached with the writing upside-down which lends itself to putting the chin-side up without a nose wire for guidance.  I tried reaching out to customer service but haven’t heard a response for over a week."
3.0,Twice as big as expected.  Not as subtle as I.had hoped
3.0,"It’s huge, long.  You should go down at least a size. I am 5’5” and it was super long"
3.0,"This is not a long term piece, dont get it wet ir it may fall apart. But for 2.00 it looks great on. Get a few and you'll be good :)"
3.0,Great jacket aside from the pockets. They are false vertical pockets. They’re actually horizontal pockets on the side and nothing stays in them.
3.0,"I’m usually a size 16 dress and ordered and XL. I felt like I was wearing a giant sack. Also, the pockets were 2 different sizes. I could easily slip 1 hand in, while the other was a little difficult."
3.0,Fits ok haven’t used it yet
3.0,Good sparkles but left a sticky residue.
3.0,"This bodysuit is very cute but not the best quality and made VERY small. I bought an XXL because of previous reviews. I bought it specifically for a Boudior Shoot and it worked perfect just for that. I am 5'9 with a long torso, so the snap part was giving me serious front wedgie. My normal size is a 10, 36DD. Which it fit everywhere else great just not in the bottom. Overall it worked for what I bought it for and the price was pretty cute. It arrived very quickly. My photos with Darling Boudior came out perfect!!"
3.0,"exactly as what was described , however many of mine were missing clasps or the adjuster chains, i expected 50 leather chains in exactly the same condition, i got 44 chains that were perfect  , (the others were missing clasps/chains/had to be fixed ) also , these were are stuck-in a strange position which even hanging something heavy on them wont fix, they are kinked"
3.0,We used this on a hat that we tried to hold the shape and it didnt really work
3.0,Pay attention to the description.  It is not  normal US sizing.  Runs very small.
3.0,Pretty short waisted after a washing. Kind of expected that so can't balme the manufacturer.
3.0,It’s nice but after about 2 months of use and a little bit of moisture exposure (I have not submerged under water it or worn it in the shower) it’s lost a lot of color. I have the beige color Its worn out on the bottom and edges and the beige color is very dull and a little bit darkened. I’d say it’s not for everyday wear.
3.0,"Too big, way too long. Heavy fabric. Like suit pants."
3.0,"Okay, these seem like nice shorts, well-made of a good fabric, pockets are plentiful and of good depth, all the things necessary for a favorite pair of shorts for years to come... BUT! They're WAY off on size. I wear a 35-36 waist and ordered my usual 36 in these, but they are huge!<br /><br />I was very disappointed to try them on and discover that I will not be able to wear them. They are very clearly tagged ""36"" inside on the label, but I estimated them to be a 40, at least. I could rent out space in these, they're so full and loose, so I got a tape measure, and sure enough, they are spot-on a 40"" waist size. I suppose I was glad to discover that I hadn't suffered a sudden unknown and catastrophic weight loss, but come on!<br /><br />These were ordered as part of the Vine program and thus are not returnable. I won't wear pants with wads of extra material bunched up around my waist, so unless I can find a friend with a 40 waist I suppose I'll end up donating these as I've never been near a 40 waist and have no plans to go there.<br /><br />As I said, the shorts are nice, I'm upset that I can't wear them, but as far as others ordering them, I have no idea what to recommend. A single pair is anecdotal, so read more reviews. Could be they were just mislabeled or could be that the sizes are not standard, but if my experience is any indication at all, order smaller than your size - and return them if they don't fit."
3.0,"The camis are okay, a little smaller than I would like (too tight, too short). I do wear them to sleep in, and I figure they will stretch out over time. If I ordered again I would go a size up. Otherwise, everything is as expected."
3.0,Cute top but too short. I ordered this to hide my postpartum belly and the shorter length did not hide the pooch. Pre-pregnancy this would have been perfect with high waisted shorts or jeans.
3.0,"I bought this set almost three months ago and waited to do the review to see how they did over time. Unlike some other posters, they arrived on time and in great condition. My set was blue and frankly it would have been nice to have been able to pick the color I wanted but the blue was ok, not a gaudy shade or anything. I put them to work right away and have used them daily for several hours a day at times. They held up fine to my abuse (I am a leaner, to the extreme of wearing the skin off of my elbows at times) for the first couple of months and then they started breaking down. They are now lumpy looking and don't feel like you have padding below you any more. I was looking for gel pads but the handful of reviews that these had at the time all raved about them so I took a shot. For someone who leans lightly or not at all I'm sure they would work great as they are a comfortable height for use and the memory foam is nice and soft. I would not recommend them for gamers because they just don't hold up under pressure for very long. I am back in search of gel pads, which are much more durable."
3.0,Will donate to Breast Cancer Charity.
3.0,Sleeves are a bit big
3.0,I normally wear a size 10-12 in women's clothes. I am 5'2&#34; and 150 pounds and my hip measurement is 40 inches. I ordered the XL and could not get the buttons to close. Also the stitching is YELLOW around the buttons and seams and I did not care for the way it looked.
3.0,"This shirt is just ok. It looks nothing like the picture. I normally wear a 10/12 and ordered a large, it fits fine but is way shorter than the picture, and the material is a shiny polyester."
3.0,"Ordered my normal underwear size.  They fit well - the waist sits at the natural waistline and they don't bind at the legs so they are comfortable to wear under leggings.  Unfortunately, they arrived with two big holes in the fabric on the front panel.  I didn't try them on until after 30 days from order date so I didn't notice the damage until it was too late to return."
3.0,"If you don't mind a rigid straight brim then it's fine.  I should have looked closer, thought you could bend it.  Oh well."
3.0,"The dress is tight in the bust, so order accordingly. The dress has a nice length - I'm 5'8 and it goes to my knees. The white dress wasn't as thick as I'd like and seems a bit see-through, so I will be returning that item."
3.0,They are so soft and so pretty but they lose a lot of hairs 😭💔
3.0,Dont fit as expected
3.0,"I don't love the shape of this sweater. It's comfy and chunky and I love the color, but the material catches very easily leaving lots of pulls all over it. Not necessarily the fault of the makers of the sweater, but if your lifestyle involves children, dogs or cats...maybe hold off."
3.0,Nice dress but material was too stretchy could've used a smaller size may get smaller one in another color😊
3.0,I loved the necklace online--but in person the chain looks cheap-almost like it's spray painted. At least I didn't pay a lot.
3.0,DOES NOT FIT AS EXPECTED...I ORDERED A SIZE UP AND THE PANTS STILL DIDN'T FIT. I'M USUALLY A SIZE 12 IN SUITS AND BECAUSE IT SAID SLIM FIT I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICE SIZING UP! IF YOU ARE A CURVY WOMAN...THIS IS NOT FOR YOU.
3.0,ran big but overall this was cute
3.0,It was to tight and thin. Didn't have a back piece.
3.0,The material was prone to bends in it
3.0,The unicorn hats are the only thing going for these hats. They are cotton and work best in hospital setting..The others are silky and large and buttons in odd spots.
3.0,"This is a cute shirt and decent quality for the price, but the fit is strange. I normally wear a large and sized up to XL, and while it fit in the torso area fine, it was too small across the bust and in the arms."
3.0,"I think that they are cute.  At first I wasn't going to keep them because I've received better quality products from Steve Madden before.  I usually have high expectations for leather though, so if you're ok with leather that's not the best quality but is sturdy enough to hold, then these are for you.  The style is nice and it translates well for everyday usage.  They're comfortable too so that's a plus.  I just wish the leather was better quality."
3.0,"The pendant is really cool, but the necklace is poop. If you buy this be prepared to put it on a different chain."
3.0,"You label these gloves as being -40 for cold resistance, but on the inside of the gloves, it says -30."
3.0,"Pretty, but I'm sending them back. They are for a small child."
3.0,"Colloar is way to wide, embarrassing to wear, who came up with the design needs to rethink this part... will be returning."
3.0,I like the softness of the fabric.  I like the long sleeves.  Navy color is good.  The waistline is shorter than I expected.  It should be maybe half an inch longer in the midriff.  Also would like  the neckline to be higher.  But it will be good with a nice scarf.  I will enjoy wearing the dress during the cooler days.
3.0,Cute as can be but the width of it was to much for me.  Absolutely my favorite brand of clothes.
3.0,This runs a little small. 3 stars because the XL fits more like a M/L. The length is okay. The pattern is nice and it's not terribly see through. Good bargain for the price.
3.0,Very cute. Did not fit. Too small. I am going to give as a gift.
3.0,"Purchased for my granddaughter. She really liked  them. For me, I thought they were a bit cheap looking but for the price I didn't expect much more."
3.0,These socks are very tight.  Order larger than normal.
3.0,A little young for me. I'm 80. I gave it to a 13 year old girl and she fell in love with it.
3.0,"delivery was late, runs small, doesn't look as cute as it does in the picture.  Disappointing."
3.0,Eh they are so wide I feel like people look at me as if I am blind without a stick! I wish they fit more and werent so big!
3.0,"Buena idea para las que no usamos ropa sin manga, pero el producto llegó manchado de amarillo como que era muy viejo."
3.0,"Pajamagram is a fine company - the nightgown arrived quickly, fit well, is attractive in style and well-made.  BUT, for sleepwear touted as being ""soft,"" this is definitely not soft material.  It is somewhat stiff and heavy, more like a work shirt.  After several washings it has started to relax a bit but is still a far cry from what one imagines as a soft flannel.  If it had been truly soft, it would have rated 5 stars, because in every other respect it is very nice."
3.0,"This watch was too big for my wrist.  I was trying to squeeze it smaller, but it broke.  Totally my fault."
3.0,Flap portion is too narrow. It doesn't protect ears. Otherwise the hat is comfortable and feels good.
3.0,Pretty in the photo but looks cheaply made in person.
3.0,very cheap made and pilled up when washed and some threads came lose on top.
3.0,Gift for my husband. He loved it but the plastic eyeball fell out in a matter of a couple hours.
3.0,Kinda odd shoe.
3.0,Runs small  fits more like 5/6 than 6/7. My 5.5 year old is smaller and still wears 5t shirts and this is “fits” him def will not get more than a<br />another year out of it
3.0,A Little uncomfortable when walking
3.0,"Beautiful style. Classy dress. The fabric was just too thin so it was clingy, sticking to the lining. The lining was only to the knee, I think it would have looked nicer to have a full lining. I considered cutting the lining out and wearing a full slip, but decided not to take the risk, as then it would be non-returnable. Very stylish - if the lining wouldn’t bother you get it!"
3.0,It just didn't fit my body right.  I didn't like the empire waist in this dress. The material was soft and stretchy.
3.0,"I am confused by the product description. The description is the reason I purchased this item. I thought there were 6 credit card slots and 1 separate compartment for cash. The inside of the bag only has 3 credit card slots, 1 zippered slot and no compartment for cash. I am wondering if different colors offer different features. BEWARE when ordering and read descriptions carefully. Apparently all colors are not made the same. Unfortunately, I will be returning this item, since it is not what I needed. Sad, since this is a good size. The front pocket easily holds my Samsung Galaxy 7 in a case, which is hard to find. The interior compartment is large enough to hold makeup, keys, tissues, odds and ends. I got the &#34;vintage brown&#34; color which is like a caramel color. It's nice. The leather feels stiff and fake, but at this price, is to be expected. There was a wrist strap and longer cross-body strap inside the bag."
3.0,Great hat but unfortunately It fits more like a true men's large and we needed a true extra-large.
3.0,Casual le quedo muy bien
3.0,"Not as nice as it looks.  Evident that it's paper under acrylic glued on..but it's still unusual and if people don't grab it to look too closely, it's a good casual piece to go with lots of things in my wardrobe."
3.0,"the lace is kind of scratchy, uncomfortable. i requested this during summer and i had to reglue the stone/cameo onto the necklace because it had come unglued in the heat of shipping. otherwise, quite pretty!"
3.0,"There's some pros and cons with this jacket that puts me on the fence about keeping it.<br />On the plus side, this jacket is true to size. It fits nice and long, and has a soft inner lining. The look of it is really cute and I know it will keep me warm in Minnesota winters.<br />However, the material of this jacket is the kind where EVERYTHING sticks to it. So if you have pets and don't want to deal with the hassle of sticky-rolling it everyday then I would look elsewhere.<br />Also, this jacket came bundled up in a bag causing it to be extremely wrinkled, and the faux fur hood was matted down. The fur also looks kinda cheap to me, but you have the option to take it off.<br />The price isn't horrible on this jacket, but I don't completely love it, so.. All in all, it's a jacket I'm just not sure is worth keeping."
3.0,"Cute suit as far as cut and style, but the glitter falls off after the first use."
3.0,the feathers come off immediately and I hadn't even used them yet in my class. I need them to withstand many uses.
3.0,"Very pretty but essentially fits like a shirt. Top part fits well but there was no butt coverage which makes it useless for a beach cover up. I'm 5'6&#34; so if you're a few inches shorter this might not be a problem. Other than that it looks very nice, not cheap at all."
3.0,"The arm holes are oddly placed, and there's a lot of fabric in the front. It's very long as well."
3.0,pretty but post are too soft and bent
3.0,good to wear with my kid
3.0,"These were too small, and not as expected."
3.0,"This is a Christmas gift. I will add more comments after I see if they like it😏<br />I think it vey nice.<br />I do wish it would have been wrapped in something other than a little plastic bag thing. It WAS a great price, just would have preferred a piece of felt/etc.  It would make the ""presentation"" more appealing. Now I have to find something to wrap it in to make it... Catch the eye..."
3.0,"I am very torn about this necklace because in a way I like it and it is beautiful but in another way, I feel totally lied to because the pictures of this necklace versus what I received isn't even close to being the same necklace to me or other people I have shown. The pictures make it look like the center stone is a beautiful glitter bluestone, that is supposed to be the night sky. However, the stone in my necklace looks green and not very sparkly. It doesn't match the description on the listing at all and while the necklace itself is beautiful, they should provide a better description of the necklace than what they have."
3.0,Took forever even tho it was labeled prime. The dress is cute but the bottom is unhemmed and it was definitely made by someone working at a Chinese sweat shop for 3¢ an hour
3.0,The smell of the boot was unbearable for me.
3.0,"The dark blue pair drop snubs of yarn everywhere I walk.  Very difficult to sweep/vacuum from the rugs.  Very good in everything else, but I have decided not to wear them, as I use these socks like slippers in the house and too much pickup on that pair."
3.0,"It's just that, ok.  Material is stretchy and clingy.  It is kind of unusual.  If you hold your arms out to the side the extra material is stitched to the sides of the blouse, if that makes sense.  Now, it is nice that the straps are wide enough to conceal straps and the sleeves look nice.  But, for it to look flattering on anyone with a little extra jiggle, you would have to duct tape your entire body to suck it in.  I gave it to my 11 year old."
3.0,"Purchased a size 5 for 4 year old and all though it's a little big & long it's a decent fit.<br />Pros: It's cute , fits as expected, granddaughter loved it and ripped off what she was wearing to put it on immediately.<br />Cons: It's not a $9.99 dress at all and if I'd seen it in store I'd have not paid that. This should sell for no more then $6.99.<br />It had many loose threads that I had to cut off and it is not sewn properly so I don't expect it to last very long as the threads near the seams are coming apart.<br /><br />Conclusion: Like I said above would not have purchased it at the Amazon price and if I'd seen all the loose threads in a store I'd have passed on the purchase even at a lower price."
3.0,Wouldn't recommend. Cheap looking and broke within the first minutes of wearing
3.0,They are nice shirts but take forever to arrive so if it's a gift no that it does take a long time but they are nice size is good also..material my son loves
3.0,Not bad . I'm willing to donate if any1 wants it . Used Jst once for church service .
3.0,"Good, lightweight T-shirt!"
3.0,"this dress is pretty. However, it was too big. After reading other reviews, I ordered the large. the front was too big and I was constantly pulling it back up. my boobs were out on display. I wish I had ordered the medium. I'm 5'8"" 200lbs, C cup"
3.0,"I am giving this tunic three stars because when I received it, I noticed it had a hole underneath the armpit. The hole was a few inches wide and it looked like it was due to bad stitching. Although I was able to sew the hole up, I am now nervous that more holes will start to appear due to the light fabric used to make the shirt. Otherwise the shirt is cute and comfortable, hence the three stars."
3.0,Cute but poked my daughter's hand around the edges and she said it was kinda itchy.
3.0,Smells very manly.  Probably won't repurchase.
3.0,"I loved the length and pockets of this tunic! And it’s really soft and not clingy. But, the color was way more dark “salmon” than the “red” I ordered. The ringer detail is cute but I can’t get over the speckled-sweater-look of the fabric and the color, neither of which is very flattering on me. I wish I had paid closer attention to the washing instructions before ordering as well. I washed in cold water but tumbled dry on low and lost my favorite feature: the length. It shrunk up a couple sizes. So make sure you dry as recommended."
3.0,Was not a fan of the material. Fit was decent.
3.0,"Looks nice, but didn't fit. Was a bit loose. Shoulders were large. Will need to return."
3.0,"These were far too large, and the quality of the boots isn't what I would have expected. Also, the opening at the top is far too large, causing ugly gaps between the boot and the leg. The material isn't great, as well. They almost look old..."
3.0,I would have loved this if it fit better. I ordered a small in the blue and it was so big. I usually wear a small/medium. The quality is nice!
3.0,"The top was full coverage like I wanted. The bottoms were not what I was looking for though. They showed too much cheek, and were not as high waisted as I hoped. Cute pattern though!<br /><br />Ordered: size medium<br />Height: 5'5""<br />Weight: 125 lbs<br />Bust: 36C"
3.0,The top fit. The bottoms were too large
3.0,"Good for the price and braids are actually quite pretty, but head size is small and it kept sliding down. There was no way to keep it in place- spec since the front was very thick."
3.0,"I have a 40mm SE, tried both 38/40mm and 42/44 versions of the bands, the former matched to watch width well, but not long enough for my wrist, (I am 5’6”, small build), the latter one is long enough, but bit wider than the watch, wish this seller offers longer length for the 38/40mm version."
3.0,Bottoms fit but top was too wide.  Had to order the next size down so now we have a bottom that's too small and a top that's big and paid twice.  The print is super cute.
3.0,Pajama shorts ripped after 1 wash!
3.0,Only one of the rabbit's foot keychains was really a good product.  The other three were a bit &#34;lean&#34; and the quality was not as good.
3.0,Cute cute wish it was a bit thicker for cold days
3.0,"The print is really beautiful. The fabric is so-so, not too soft and I am not sure what can happen after washing. it isn't stretching at all. The cut of the dress is very uncomfortable. the line of waist is hard and not more than 32 "" , so if you have wider waist you cannot zip it up. But the most problem is I cannot put the top on myself. It is too uncomfortable to do that and I didn't risk to break the jumpsuit. I am 5'6, 136 pounds."
3.0,"I was disappointed with this product. The images that I looked at before ordering made it appear that the material was not see-through (it is) so that was a downer. The material is not bad, it’s just not what you’re looking for if you want something that is solid fabric, and not revealing. Other than being able to see through it I think that it was an okay product. Just depends on what you are wanting from it."
3.0,"Grace Karin became my go to brand because everything is well made and the sizing was accurate for me. That's no currently true. I need a dress for a wedding and looked to Grace Karin. I ignored the reviews that said the dresses I chose ran small.  I should've listened. Every single one ran small and no, I did6gain weight. I still have other items that still fit fine. That said, this dress is the same. Well made, but runs small."
3.0,"I really wanted to like the dress after seeing other posts, but the color is not as stated. It's not a red, it's a pink. I purchased both blue and &#34;red&#34;. I returned it. I kept the blue, still debating though. I wish it was a little thicker material. It's not totally see through or anything. I tried on the blue it fits perfect, but at the armpits it's extra material and I would have to have it fixed. Need to try it on again and decide whether worth fixing or send back. :("
3.0,"I bought this for my 4year old because it takes away the need for ear muffs and scarf. The cover is very cute, it also comes with cloth filter type inserts  but we don't have a need for them yet. The cover is an ok fit, my son kept trying to keep the cover away from his eyes from the side."
3.0,It's ok. I was hoping for a well stitched bag. But it isn't. I wanted to carry groceries and such. I don't think it will be strong enough. So I just gave it to my granddaughter to carry items around.
3.0,"The material is nice cotton and a little on the heavier side. The design is good, but the shorts are too short for me and although they say XL is size 16-18 it is more 16 small. Because it is cotton don’t wash or dry on hot or it will shrink."
3.0,los postes para poner y quitar son muy incomodos puesto que no son facil de abrir y cerrar
3.0,Love the neck and design but it's rather short in length.
3.0,skirt is a very cute style and color but the fabric is a little too thin for my taste and there was a hole in the pocket
3.0,nice shades but very loose
3.0,Had to order two sizes up and it is a bit on the hard side
3.0,I bought this for a wedding.  Very lightweight but expected to train in back to be longer. Not sure if I will wear it for the wedding but overall I'm satisfied with my item.
3.0,I got the engraved C. The pendant is Tiny. The engraving is Nice but overall that is all I can really say about it. The chain is short and cheap looking. It is very lightweight. I did like the bag it was placed in. I would not pay the asking price for this necklace. I received this product at a discount for my honest review.
3.0,"My grandson waited a long time before he got this for a gift. He was very happy with it, but then the eyes, which are glued, NOT sewn, came off in less than a week. He wasn't rough with it, only had it for sleeping. I will get some eyes that I can sew onto the monkey so he can be happy again."
3.0,After I wore & washed these they seemed to loose their compression. They are looser after the wash and dry which is tad unusual. The black is a nice dark black though.
3.0,Cute tote but not worth the $22 price tag. Made from thin fabric. I was expecting something a bit more sturdy. However it conveniently folds up into a round zippered bag. Very handy. It made a cute gift.
3.0,Hard to get in but super good fit once in. Like the color and look. Giving three stars because scratch super easily. Much more than previous lenses.
3.0,"Updated Review:<br />Every time I work out/run in this shirt, the fabric seems to stretch more and the material does not seem to be holding up through the wash. I’ve decided to return it. :(<br /><br />Original review:<br />I bought this white workout top in size large (for reference, I am 5’7”, about 140 lb., a 34bust, and typically wear a small or medium in tops). I sized up to a large and am glad I did. It is a looser fit (not skin tight) and ties easily in the back still giving me a fitted, but relaxed look (see photos). The material is dry-fit and is comfortable and easy to move and stretch in. Overall, I’m happy with it. If you don’t want it to be skintight, I would definitely recommend sizing up one size. Hope that helps!"
3.0,Some of the beads shattered trying to get it into my belly piercing
3.0,"It was OK, not great.  I ended up returning it."
3.0,I bought this item discounted in return for an honest review. This is a good corset cincher. My only complaint is that 1. It's kind of short and 2. It's bulky under clothes.  I'm normal waisted. Not long waisted at all and I kept feeling like I wanted to pull it up under my chest but if I did that the baby belly pooch stuck out. I'm not pregnant it's just that little pooch under the belly button that most moms have. But it does work. It gives that hour glass shape for sure.
3.0,"I bought this mainly for the backlight to use during the night.  Can hardly see anything.  Seller approved return but I have to pay for postage which is almost half of the price of the item, so I decided to keep it as a gift.  Just want others to be aware, you have to pay for return postage if the watch doesn't work for you."
3.0,Very large for a child
3.0,"I bought this cardigan expecting that it would be a soft, pastel baby pink, and its not. I would describe it as hot pink, not as pastel pink.<br /><br />Also, I find that it fits very strange. I was expecting it to be a little more curve-hugging but instead its very loose and unflattering. Layering a cardigan underneath turns it into a lumpy mess. It has a very, very deep V-neck so layering is needed, which is also dissapointing because I wanted a cardigan I could wear on its own as a shirt.<br /><br />On the plus side, it is still a very cute cardigan, and it is very soft and opaque."
3.0,"The 1st pair I bought were mediums,  fit perfectly, and were long, I read the reviews for a long fit. I decided to buy a second pair because I liked them so much. These mediums were way too small. I had to give them away."
3.0,"Was smaller than i wanted it to be, but it's cute."
3.0,The neck part is very snug if u area bigger guy. Other than that it works.
3.0,Not compression but nice tank top
3.0,I used them for snowboarding and skiing. My hands were cold and the gloves didn’t warm me up. Snow got inside my gloves. It is probably good for less colder climates not in the snow
3.0,The piece that holds it together broke after a week R 2
3.0,this is something i can work on to get it how i would like so i guess its ok
3.0,Purchased two pairs for the flowers girls at a wedding. My daughter kept losing her shoe and my niece couldn’t wear hers. They just slip out.
3.0,Well made product but not like my other purchase from different seller. Very tin layers.
3.0,"It's so long on my 8 inch wrist that I had to cut the end off to keep it from looking ridiculous. The leather band is super thin, and shows damage very quickly. I'm hoping this will patina over time, but I have my doubts."
3.0,Cute but I'm 5'8 it's too short. Also irregularity where waist n top connect. Not even. Slight tugging.
3.0,I am fairly new to the Amazon shopping when I ordered this dress in Feb. looking the delivery date nudged me to order back then so I would have it before summer.<br />I ordered it 1 size bigger like the reviews had shown that was the best fitting....Wrong 2 or 3 sizes lager would have fit. I usually wear a large because I’m curvy.<br />The quality of it is good for the price I paid. Very soft material. I’ll only be wearing it at home for my man..
3.0,"Colors were so cute! They quality isn't very good, they are pretty uncomfortable and a little small."
3.0,"Better than expected, Worn with Pjs as well<br />As to the office for a casual day! I thought it was more of a sweater knit, but it came as a tshirt knit style fabric. Still decent for the price."
3.0,"I ordered rose gold, and it’s more of a yellow gold. Otherwise, it’s a nice ring. I wear it in my thumb."
3.0,"Just received the bracelet, fast shipping but very disappointed in the quality of the bracelet the picture shows stones or pave as they call it even with a magnifying glass you can't even see any.  All it is is etched to look like stones.  Very disappointed.  The picture even makes the bracelet look of substantial weight it is not.  Lightweight.  Think twice if you purchase it.."
3.0,"This hoodie is soft, warm, and very cute. But I was really disappointed that it didn't have any pockets! What hoodie doesn't have pockets?"
3.0,Pretty good at keeping the light out but already tearing up.
3.0,Nice material but returned dress as too short for my frame 5'10&#34;
3.0,"I did like the weight of the fabric. I ordered a large and found it too snug in my mid-drift area. Good length, I'm 5.8 and I like the majority of my fanny covered.  Did not like they way the sleeve was sewn into the shoulders.  Won't be purchasing again."
3.0,"It’s pretty, the material is a little cheap though. It depends on one’s body shape. It was a little too tight for me and wouldn’t have been office appropriate"
3.0,"looks feminine not for men with lots of ""style"" not comfort or usefulness"
3.0,"Very thin, makes them invisible for real"
3.0,"These were a little cheesy for the price.  My niece loved them, and I guess that's all that really matters.  I would have rather gone with another earring, but there aren't any that I found that are similar"
3.0,"Sleeves fit well , however the back of the sweater is short"
3.0,"I'm an XL,I shouldve got a XXL. Fits very tight..great graphics,but order a full size bigger. If u a L get an XL"
3.0,"I bought these for my girlfriend and she likes them but doesn't love them. For the price, I cold have gone to the swap meat and bought them cheaper. But they serve there purpose for the cost"
3.0,"I ordered a 2/4 (package says M when it arrived). The top part (bust) is too big (I am a 34B) so I will need to take it in at the sides. The thigh area was a little snug. It's a pretty dress though. I usually wear a size 4 (5'2, 109lbs). I don't think its worth $27. I wouldn't buy again and too lazy to return it."
3.0,Ok but not great!
3.0,A bit of a disappoinment... They didn't compress at all. They simply fit.
3.0,"Review by spouse:<br /><br />Sadly, these ran very small on me. I even sized up after reading the reviews and they just didn’t work out. They were pretty short, gapped around the legs and looked like they were pulling. The side vents made the shorts even shorter. The color was a brown grey versus a dark grey. Just a bad fit overall for my body."
3.0,It was missing the lock & it was smaller than they said....
3.0,After the very first wear my daughter’s feet were so stinky.
3.0,"These sandals were cute, but they bulged at the side every time my daughter took a step. It looked awkward and she said it felt weird. Her feet are a little on the narrow side but she hasn't had this issue with other sandals. We returned them."
3.0,"I bought this for a private NFL Party . It is pretty well made and it is real cute . Just make sure to look it over . Mine was definately a repackaged product because it was the right product in the wrong package .But it was in good shape , so we kept it ."
3.0,Lenses aren't polarized enough.  Very Very light almost like nothing
3.0,"Love the one piece for 3 year old doing swimming classes, I don't have to worry about tying pants or losing pants in water, this brand runs small...."
3.0,I bought the dress pictured with this shirt.  It's one size fits most and it's very big.....which I love!  I also ordered the shirt.  I could barely get the shirt down around me.  The sizing is completely different. 😞  I love the color and fabric.....the sizing was a disappointment.
3.0,"The necklace is nice, but less than a day after I got it, the chain broke. Luckily I was able to fix it, causing the chain to be a little shorter, which was okay because I didn't like how long it was anyways. In spite of the chain breaking, it is a cool necklace."
3.0,It's somewhat large but maybe after a wash it will fit better.
3.0,"Entirely too small. Not true to size. Ordered L in women and they were skin tight. If you buy them, be sure to size way up. The quality is still good though. Nice material"
3.0,"weird fit for the top, love the bottoms. not for chesty girls like myself. otherwise it's cute and I'll probably wear it some this summer"
3.0,"its ok. defiantly runs big so order at least a size smaller or even 2, but its a nice dress"
3.0,Seemed like a T-Shirt dress and was too tight and too short for me. I like my dresses to cover all of my knee. It was not what I expected. I returned it.
3.0,these are okay they work as advertised
3.0,"I loved these when I got them.  The band that came with my Fitbit was boring and I wanted pizazz!  However, after having these just a few weeks, one of them has broken.  Disappointing.  Glad three of them came in the package so now I have another one.  They were not very expensive so I am not terribly upset. They are cute, though."
3.0,"Bought a 2xl, was more like the size of a small XL. Husband didnt even try on cause he could tell how small it was"
3.0,"Very see through! Even nude undergarments show through the fabric.  As other reviewers stated, the lace doesn't extend past the white part at the bottom, so not exactly as the picture shows. It is a long sleeve (the sleeves are pushed up in the photo) but the sleeve length is somewhat short. The shirt fit as expected and otherwise looks really nice."
3.0,"they are ok,  smaller then I thought,  but useable"
3.0,"I think to call these non slip is very inaccurate. They are super comfortable and lightweight, but will not stay on my head. I’ll probably return them and grab some from Walmart"
3.0,The earring is nice but did not last that long
3.0,Nice but not very sturdy
3.0,"This is mostly my mistake but I didn't know they were snapbacks, and though the hearts would be &#34;full&#34; but they're flat on the end that goes against your neck. For the price the quality is above average but not something I'm use to when buying chokers/collars."
3.0,"This dress didn't look as good on as I'd like it to.  I'm sure it will look much better on someone else.  It fit as expected.  I'm 5'8"" 115 lbs and ordered a size 6."
3.0,"Like the shoe, but way to wide for medium width."
3.0,Did not like  the way it looked on. Also do not like the material.
3.0,I really love the glasses I had 2 pair that arrived broke was unable to get returned in time.  Please shop glasses better. Would have given 5 stars if I hadn't received 2 pair's broke.
3.0,The necklace is pretty but two of the stones were out. I have to glue them in.
3.0,Bottoms were a tab bit cheekier than I had anticipated but still cute & comfy
3.0,"Okay, only okay. Fits small, buy a size up. Does not launder well. Even with fabric softener and prompt removal from dryer, it has wrinkles. Husband is 6'2"" and 180 lbs. He wears a large, but this large is more like a medium."
3.0,I looked at the reviews and the size chart and ordered a medium. The top fit fine but the bottoms are way to small and barely cover my behind. They fit like an xs.
3.0,Unicorn stitching is off & the whole dress is 2 sizes too big
3.0,My 4 yr old Grand daughter didn’t really care for it
3.0,Not as soft as a kleenex but much prettier.  Hopefully will soften upon a few washings. I think I will be happier without shreds of kleenex in my pockets.
3.0,Size fills like med or large although it is supported to be x-large
3.0,"My 80-year-old mother is getting married this summer and most of her bridesmaids are in their late 50's.  We're looking for dresses that aren't too bridesmaidy-silly and don't cost an arm and a leg - this dress fits the bill perfectly.  However, you get what you pay for!  The skirt is not lined and the seams were so close cut that the serging didn't meet in several places.  There wasn't even enough fabric for me to make the corrections without altering the shape of the dress.  I'm returning this dress and re-ordering in the hopes that the next dress I receive is put together a little better."
3.0,"Very cute shirt, although the material doesn't feel so soft, feel like it's made out of the old track suit material. Going to wash with extra fabric softener to see if the stiffness will come out. Ordered a Small, and I regret that.... Not all sizes run the same."
3.0,"beautiful jewelry, but it is very lightweight and has a toy feel to it."
3.0,"Cute coat but sizes are way off!  I usually wear a medium, but based on past reviews, I ordered this item in a large and it is way to tight!  I think the sizes must be for the Asian market."
3.0,"The material is heavier than I expected. Perhaps this is no one's fault. Not quite what I was looking for in the summertime. Also, I found the actual color a bit duller than pictured in the ad."
3.0,Loved the gems but there is no give/stretch to the item.  It would fit a child more than an adult.
3.0,Cufflinks and studs doesn't shines like the photo
3.0,"Very cute, but too thin."
3.0,Came missing the hat band. Very disappointed since it is supposed to be a gift.
3.0,You get what you pay for.  Its for a play.  The ribbon doesn't exactly match in some lighting...
3.0,"Nice shirt, just thineer than I was expecting. More for warmer weather."
3.0,"Shipped ahead of schedule, great for a tween!"
3.0,The print is very beautiful and the quality of the fabric is great too. The only reason why I'm giving it three stars is because it's too small on top and doesn't cover my cleavage. I'm still going to keep it but I'll have to wear an undershirt.
3.0,Sizing runs a little large. I’d order a size down. Coloring is super pale.
3.0,"These are HUGE! My 11 year old can't wear them just yet. Somehow I missed the size of them. I'm 5'7&#34; and have a long neck, but these earrings beush my shoulders. Love  the earrings, just didn't realize how big they were."
3.0,"Just right for the price, not a very good quality. But for the price I really did not expect it to be likeStriderite. But it's a good everyday walking shoe."
3.0,"Design is great, t shirt weight is on the light side."
3.0,"These charms are ok. The elastic is extremely cheap. I ordered for the charms only. If you want it to wear, I woud suggest not to order. Not such great quality."
3.0,Was too small then it shrunk when I washed it. You get what pay for.
3.0,"Good quality and print, very stretchy. Thicker material than expected. Tight all over can be unflattering on midsection. Went below my knee and I’m 5’8”. Decided to return."
3.0,Says these are for men these sizes are for boys specifically between the ages of 10 and 14
3.0,The band is a little to small.  It barely covers my wrist.  So this is probably for young kids.
3.0,A little bigger than expected. Came from China and was expecting it to be smaller. The material is fine but the fit is a little weird. The top part set a lot higher than shown. Almost looks like a maternity dress.
3.0,"The shirt was atleast 2 sizes too small. I like the actual product, so I will give it as a gift."
3.0,This is cute but just did not look good on me.
3.0,Cute with pockets but weird fit in torso and chest area
3.0,"I wear eyeglasses with Transitions lenses (that change to sunglasses in the sun), so I don't normally need anything else. Except that they don't change while driving because of the UV coating on the windshield. After a harrowing drive into the sun a few weeks ago where I was blinded, I thought I would look into sunglasses that would fit over my eyeglasses.<br /><br />I was expecting frumpy, ugly glasses like my grandparents would've worn, but was surprised to find a more attractive version. Not the biggest fan of rhinestones, but I was only wearing them in the car, so I figured it would be fine.  I do love the icy purple color, and they do not look bad. When they arrived they fit well over my eyeglasses (which are rather large) and I could see through them very well. Success!  Or so I thought ...<br /><br />So, what's the point of a pair of sunglasses that do not filter sun? Well, it filters it to a point, where it was better than NO sunglasses, but I was still blinded by driving into the sun yesterday. I don't expect them to filter out every bit of sun imaginable, but they could do a MUCH better job.<br /><br />On the plus side, I suffer from glare issues at night from headlights due to some vision issues, and I found that because of how *not* dark they are, they are perfectly wearable at night and help immensely with the glare I was experiencing. This is the only reason I'm not returning them as defective, because they are still helpful to me. And, even in sun, they are admittedly better than nothing.  I do like that they have a bit of sunglass shielding on the sides of the earpieces as well, as that's usually a big issue with me - the sideways sun. I do not yet know how effective that is, however.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a really good, shielding pair of sunglasses, you might want to look elsewhere."
3.0,Didn't love it at first but tried it and got lots of compliments on it.
3.0,They are comfy and fit nicely but not butt lifting at all!
3.0,"I like the product, but it is too small for my wrist. I bought this for hiking so I guess I can attach it to my pack."
3.0,The quality was nice but the top was too small had to return it
3.0,"Tight fit, color is not exactly like picture. Thin material."
3.0,"I use this for a neckband instead of a headband because they are so small.  Kids could probably use them, but they're too small for an adult head; at least when you want your ears covered."
3.0,"while i did like the leggings and even though i have 2 different sizes,very disappointed in how short the back is.  you would literally need to have the flattest butt ever for these to fit you properly. So I'm kinda bummed out looking at these  in my drawer and not being able to wear them unless i want to pull them up in back every 2 seconds. should have been made same front and back :("
3.0,Already loosing it color. And turning. Leaves my finger green if left in to long :(<br />It eye is already gone. The ring is so cute yet so cheap
3.0,"The design is absolutely beautiful, but it does not carry over to the the back.  While I appreciate that it is full in the back versus flat, I wish I knew before ordering that the design was only on one side."
3.0,Sleeves Are  freakishly long<br /> But soft
3.0,"Several others have commented that the watch is small, but it really is too small for my taste.  I especially did not like that the face is  wide but not high, which is not aesthetically pleasing.  I gave it to my 8 year old son, who loves it, and I went back to my old Casio with a new band."
3.0,"After learning this product was being shipped from China, I immediately had hesitation from previous experience orders going through customs.  Shockingly the order arrived just as fast as the charm I ordered from the states.<br />I love the picture of the charm, but the actual charm does not look the same.  The charm does not have the finished polished look as the picture shows.  The heart in the middle appears to have a gold look, but the charm received does not.  Another difference is the inscription on the back side of the charm is not there.  Just a duplicate of the front.<br />I am just now starting my collection of charms for my bracelet so I am not going to return it.  I will replace it at some point."
3.0,This item I had to order twice the first time I ordered it it was too small. Very well-made and very well constructed but very small.
3.0,Size runs small.  Material not warm . And it was expensive.
3.0,"small and short waisted but very cute, wish it fit"
3.0,great for winter time
3.0,I’ve bought similar shirts without the detail and this one fits a bit more snug than the others.  Super cute though!
3.0,Not the right thread size
3.0,The item feels ultra flimsy like a super cheap scarf.  Even for a light cover up it is way too flimsy.  I suppose that given the price I should have expected as much.  You get what you pay for here.  It is a beautiful pattern but I'll be lucky to get a couple of uses out of it.
3.0,"Very pretty for the price, but it is very lightweight."
3.0,They run very small. I ordered 2xl for my husband.  They might fit  like a medium.
3.0,doesn't fit my big ass thighs but is good
3.0,The bathing suit is too large at the top. The top is also sewn at an angle. I have bought these suits for years and this one is not constructed well.
3.0,These are quite big and look a little like buy eyes.
3.0,"Although I like how small it is, I did not like the mechanism idea. The button was small, and didn’t stick out very far, and it was hard to press down to trigger the clip. Was not very ergonomic. I ended up getting a different for simple one that I have enjoyed much more."
3.0,Able to buy online
3.0,Was a little to b big but very pretty dress
3.0,Cute dress but the sizing is off runs small I would size up for the thicker individual.
3.0,They are heavy...but I torture myself to wear them to match my buffalo plaid outfits.
3.0,Purchased for my daughter ok for a child
3.0,Runs somewhat small! But definitely pretty!
3.0,I normally wear large shirts so that's what I ordered. Well...the large I ordered in these shirts fitted a little too tight. An extra large would have been a better fit but of course they're not sold in extra large. Not too happy about this so I'm going to return them.
3.0,"Not the best quality, but I guess you get what you pay for.  Very flimsy and thin rubber."
3.0,Way too big. Hopefully they will fit next summer.
3.0,"Don’t trust the size on it. I did. I cut to my size 11 and was a big mistake. Now, I have a gap in my shoe and my toes are in the air instead of sitting on  the insole. Sigh."
3.0,"The top was way to large, but I got it altered to fit perfect"
3.0,Notice the word “even” is misspelled? “Eevn”<br />Almost like saying the grad needs to go back to school.
3.0,Aren't as small as I had hoped.  Still show in some of my shoes.  Feel a little large and move in my shoes.
3.0,Runs quite large
3.0,"Loved the easy to put on but wouldn’t buy again bc they don’t fold up and directions say you have to use a special cloth to wipe. I swum competitively for many years. These just take too much space and work. Also, were not comfortable for me. But my 13yr old thought they were great. All said, these would be especially PERFECT for anyone with long, uncapped hair."
3.0,These are hit and miss. My first set were wildly mismatched. I sent them back and ordered a replacement. These ones are better but not great. Solid 3 stars but I probably won't order again when I size up.
3.0,"This is an okay cloth.  A little fuzzy, but it does remove tarnish."
3.0,Not good  material
3.0,"Fit well, but inseam of leggings ripped after only about 3 wears. Disappointed"
3.0,Ordered a larger size because i am heavier set and still does not fit. I am using them as goal shirts.
3.0,"My charms doesnt fit in the chain, I have to remove it, then put the charm, then put the chain back and I didnt read these are silk strings, I thought it was waxed cord, and the silk cord get damaged with the jump rings 😒  its not your fault, Im just saying, I was wondering if you have yhe same item but with waxed cord"
3.0,When washing it stays wrinkled...But other than that it's not bad!
3.0,They were very pretty but just bigger than I wanted to wear when I saw them. I gave them to someone else.
3.0,"Its pretty enough, but the fit just doesn't cut it, even when you bend it for placement. it still falls."
3.0,"The design is nice,the material is nice & tretchy, but very thin and see through. Runs very small, maybe 2 sizes."
3.0,rally good bit looks hot that real...
3.0,Color on the band & bow don't match on all of them. Kind of odd
3.0,I like the shirts but they run small.  I would advise ordering a size larger than you normally do.
3.0,For the cost it was ok.
3.0,"Honestly, I am disappointed with this bra. Its obviously better than an over the head champion or nike &#34;only for B's and under&#34; bra, but after reading all the glowing reviews, I really thought this bra would keep the ta tas in place. For starters, this the highest impact bra this company offers, which I would assume means that they understand what high impact means.<br /><br />Definition of high impact: LOTS of running, jumping, Olympic weight lifting (jump in air, pull weight), boxing/muay thai and other martial arts, basketball, crossfit etc... for an extended period of time.<br /><br />This means I dont want my large boobs (34E) bouncing all over the place and I dont want to be adjusting my bra straps all the time.<br /><br />That being said - I did not have to adjust this bra that frequently. The bra fits very snug, so I thought that might be a plus. However, I did bounce around a lot more than expected. It didn't hinder my workout entirely, but it was certainly a disappointment. I have decided that the other women who have reviewed this bra either don't work out with the same intensity that I do or their boobs are much smaller (I am a 34 E). Or maybe I am the outlier."
3.0,"The cheetah print scarf looks nothing like the picture. Its actually much lighter, almost a beige color. It is nothing I would ever wear [25 y.o.] The scarves are very thin."
3.0,"This item wasn't as cuddly as I thought it would be- the material is thinner than I expected. And the drawstrings started getting loose threads immediately. It's an ok hoodie which seems a bit overpriced for what it is. I love the color though and sending it back would be a hassle, so I'm keeping it."
3.0,I bought one pair and they fit great.  Lived them!  Bought another with a different pattern and they a little snug and have a small hole near the waist.
3.0,I ordered a Large ( my normal size)... this material is sooo stretchy I could have bought a small and it would have fit perfect. Wasn't what I expected ... I had to make a lot of alterations to make it flattering
3.0,"Dress was gorgeous, but way to big.  I even measured before ordering and it was still 3 sizes to big.  Working on returning the item."
3.0,"Love these little hats but even as a newborn they were tight on my little girl's head. She was an average sized baby, under 8 pounds but they were tight and she fussed if I put them on her. They are really cute though. They kind of fade if you wash them and they are a little different in color than pictured in my opinion."
3.0,"It was nice for fashion jewelry, but was missing a stone in the middle of the bracelet."
3.0,They get pilled and linty very fast - even washing on delicate cycle.
3.0,The seems are only over locked not straight stitched so these tights are no very good for strenuous activity. Given the price I decided to have them sewn rather than return them. They fit well though.
3.0,it was lite in weight but had a great look my son loved it
3.0,Looks cool and has good detail I just wouldn’t say it’s “actual size” 1:1 replica given it looks much larger in a gods hands
3.0,"I purchased the red backpack an it doesn't change colors compared to the purple bag. I ordered the purple bag from hot one before an it was flawless! I got so many compliments, but this red backpack just doesn't cut it. It's a nice backpack. It has lots of room, but I got this red backpack thinking it would change like the purple. :("
3.0,They fit her well and they're cute however even washing them with all whites made them fade quickly
3.0,They don't slide down my nose.They stay put!
3.0,Quality product however very few glasses will fit in the holes provided.
3.0,fabric is very loud and string is a lot thicker than i thought it would be not a big fan
3.0,"So the deal is this. I bought a pair on a lightening deal, got them, they fell the next day from my face to the floor and the left arm snapped off. Contacted the seller and contacted Amazon, amazon did a replacement with me so I sent in the broken pair and was sent a new set. About 3-4 days after getting them I noticed the plastic on the inside on the left lens cracked off around the screw.<br /><br />Are they a good pair of sunglasses? Sure I like the look and people think they fit my face well. Do I like that both pairs broke? No. I won't be sending this pair back because I have no interest in constantly having a set of sunglasses one week and then having to buy a new pair the next week. I can live with a little broken piece on the inside but buyers need to know that there is a potential that they will crack."
3.0,"I ordered 2, both size medium. I'm 5'8"" and about 140lbs. The white fits good. But as you can see in the pic the light green is significantly shorter. It doesn't look as good on me because it's wide and short, doesn't hang in a flattering way. The color is beautiful so I'm not sure if I'll keep it or try to exchange for another in the same color. I would have given 5 stars if they both fit the same."
3.0,I should have read the specifications closer. I thought they were made out of vinyl like a regular boat bumper and not hard plastic. My bad
3.0,"Not as nice as the picture, but fine for the price"
3.0,"Im not a fan of the cheap looking gold color on the earrings but I mainly ordered these as filler for my order. Do love the pink color of the feathers, better if it wasn't cheep gold plastic. Product has held up so far."
3.0,seems fine
3.0,"Fabric poor quality, looks real cheap nothing like the picture, very disappointed"
3.0,Seemed like good quality!! And the little shoe gems were fun!
3.0,"Nice product, but could be a bit longer"
3.0,Don't expect an adult head to fit.  More for Teens.
3.0,These do show what's under them but I suppose that's to be expected with white leggings.
3.0,All different sizes but does take shape of fingers. I like them but not sure how long they will last.
3.0,Nice leather but the liner is already ripping after a few months.
3.0,It wasn't what I expected and the dress look different in person
3.0,Fits well. Grinch “hair” gets gross once washed.
3.0,"My daughter bought this but found that one side of the bow tore loose of the backing so it doesn't sit flat on the belt now.  looks like they simply glued it together.  Seems a little cheap, but we'll have to re-glue it ourselves to make it work."
3.0,This dress is pretty and fits well but unfortunately the tag was misleading. I thought I was getting polyester and spandex fabric but when it came it was a knit and not very high quality even though the tag says polyester and spandex. After two washes it has started getting static and the ugly little balls. It makes me sad because I love the style of the dress and the way it fits just wish the fabric was higher quality.
3.0,"Nice shirt,a little baggier than expected, sleeves were a tiny bit shorter than expected too. I'm 5'3&#34;, size 0 to 2 and bought the XS."
3.0,"plastic sunglasses, very thin and simple."
3.0,The bottom skirt was great fits as it’s supposed too and looks nice but the top looked like it was made for a child.
3.0,Top fits smaller than pants
3.0,Sexy sexy sexy real cute 2 .
3.0,This is a nice bra but I wouldn’t call this a “minimizer”.
3.0,Found it was a little too small for my toddler
3.0,"This bracelet is one long cord with the circles, the studs, and the stones, in a line. It secures by friction with use of a belt like clasp. The only problem is that the excess material on the inside of the bracelet scratches and digs at the wrist. I will need to either cut it off or file it down."
3.0,"These earrings were reasonable, so I knew they would look inexpensive. However, out of the six pair I received, only 4 were actually wearable. With one pair, the problem was the earrings were a different size and very noticeable. The other ones I could not wear, were off centered. But, for the price they are ok."
3.0,"I wanted this dress to work out so badly! The burgundy color is gorgeous and the material doesn't look cheap despite it being a low cost garment. However, it was way too short on me. I am 5'6 and the slit in front just barely covered my lady parts. Any movement would have flashed my bits. Returning!"
3.0,This poodle charm is adorable. A little large for my grandmother's bracelet but she didn't care. However she cant wear it bcuz the ring on it isn't soldered  & she's afraid she'll lose it.
3.0,It runs smaller that i thought.
3.0,Far too big for kids
3.0,some fit tight
3.0,"button fell off before i even washed it, BUT it fits amazing and looks really good on me, bought numerous of these high waisted vintage inspired swimsuits and this one is top 2 in fit for sure. flatters your curves FRONT AND BACK"
3.0,"The leather is good and soft, gloves seem well done and with attention to the details. Two objections:<br />1. Only the tip of the thumb and index finger work with the car touch screen, these two fingers have a different type of leather at the finger tip of the glove which activate the touch screen. The other finger tips do not work with the car touch screen.<br />2. The grip over the steering wheel seems poor."
3.0,"while wearing one of the necklaces the charm just fell off the ""chain"" it is not fixable."
3.0,Mask looks nothing like it does in pictures.
3.0,Made nice but way too big for me. Returned it.
3.0,"I received this product not exactly what I wanted to long, but once I put it with a outfit it looks good. I would use this on a flight as a blanket cover up."
3.0,"I've aways had buffs for my dog to keep the collar from clanging and because they look good. I saw the &#34;dog buff&#34; and decided to give it a try. It's essentially a half buff with a reflector down the side. Yes the price is cheaper, but on my 60 pound Shepherd it just rolled up and looked like a second collar around her neck. I'm going back to the normal buffs for my dog now, they look and work better."
3.0,Really thin fabric. Sleeves and bottom do not have a finished edge.  It doesnt' look really bad but you can really tell it is a cheap blouse. Not really worth the money but it is not worth the hassle to return it.
3.0,"To big, would have been perfect if half the size."
3.0,"I love the design. But there is no washing label and washing instruction. When I received it, it was heavy creased. A lot of threads, badly sewed. Will keep it any way."
3.0,I got two packages of these and each one had two pair that were too small.  The others for great.  These are very thin socks which is what I wanted.
3.0,"Nice jacket, sized too small"
3.0,Comfortable but the touch pads don't work that great
3.0,"So cute but unfortunately very small at waist. I wear a 6 pants and medium size. Ordered a medium and while the arms chest and length were great, the waist was way too small. Could even zip closed. What a shame it was so cute! :("
3.0,Bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas and its really small.... I thought it would be bigger (well longer) and its really small lol thats all I can say about it
3.0,Fit is perfect.  But ordered red and received an peachy color instead
3.0,The T-shirt is super long. My husband is not very tall he is 5.9” but this shirt is way too long. The quality is ok but not soft cotton feel we bought from this brand before. I would not buy it again. He will keep this one to wear around the house and do yard work in.
3.0,wrinkles a lot! pulled out of dryer full of wrinkles.  Not as pretty as I thought it would be
3.0,"They are kinda big but okay, I’m pretty happy I guess"
3.0,"Got these for the kids for virtual school, cute and stylish,  moderate blue light blocking"
3.0,The battery ran out in 1 month
3.0,This too was WAY to small. I ordered a XL and took a chance because there were no prior reviews. The material isn’t bad but it is not a true XL. I weight 215lbs & typically wear a 12-14. It fit on the arms ( a little tight around the shoulders) however it would not button. I wish the sizing was better. Otherwise I would have kept it.
3.0,"Just received these clip-on sun shades for my frame-less prescription glasses. The delivery was very fast and the packaging protected the sunglasses. It came with the microfiber cleaning cloth and a cute little card to prove that these are truly polaroid lenses. Without wearing the glasses you see nothing on the road, but viewed through the glasses you see cars.  (you can also test Polaroids against another Polaroid lenses by turning the two lenses in opposite directions. If they are both polarizing lenses you will reach a point where no light can pass though both lenses due to each lens only allowing light waves to pass in one direction. When the two paths cancel each other, no light can pass through.)<br />Anyway, back to the review. These are very light weight so wearing them for extended periods should be quite comfortable. The appearance is just like the photographs above. My only difficulty is that the frame-less prescription lenses are attached to the nose-piece bridge exactly at the same point as the clip on legs clip on. So attaching them to my glasses requires a bit of fiddling to get them placed so that they don't pop off when flipping the shades up. Other than that, they seem well made. I don't wear sunshades regularly, so I will try to update this review after a few months to see how they hold up.."
3.0,"This a cute dress for work, or something casual the only thing is that this dress runs very small it has a pretty good stretch to it but not too much, if you have a good body shaper you will be good to go."
3.0,"The item is great, looks real good, but was advertised as 22&#34; but the one I received was only 20&#34;"
3.0,"I got the Red with flowers size XL. The pattern is adorable as well as the ruffles. The fabric is not extremely breathable, and is an odd polyester material and Is pretty dang short. I’m 5’7.5 and pear shaped, around 190 lbs. I wouldn’t wear this dress anywhere that would require bending, or raising your arms"
3.0,the gold pieces faded quickly
3.0,This is good for layering. It fits nice and the sizing was exactly what I expected. I would buy these in different colors if available.
3.0,it's cute and comfortable
3.0,"This sweater fits fine; thoug, I prefer a round collar.  Great Color selection."
3.0,They have nothing to grab on to remove the gloves.
3.0,"They look ok, the quality is so-so, but are actually a lot smaller than anticipated. Seems this would be better suited for boys and teens than for grown men."
3.0,"Too loose - will be okay with skirts, but they ride up under my pants"
3.0,"The magnet strap ripped/tore off almost immediately. Other then that, it is a functional case for my range finder"
3.0,Sleeves are much shorter than picture.
3.0,"Material was thin and a little itchy. Looks better in photo. I returned it, looks cheap"
3.0,It came with three holes in it. They're not noticeable when the scarf is worn but any clothing article arriving with holes is not a plus.
3.0,"The earrings are so cute, but I only received four not six like I was supposed to.."
3.0,Nice dress but didn't fit. Normally a medium to large in dresses. Order xl and still didn't fit. Had to return.
3.0,Ok belt but could use a real buckle
3.0,"I felt it could be better, it does not look like as shown in the photo."
3.0,It's a fun print. Who doesn't love dinosaurs? The sizing is for bigger boys though. It doesn't tighten enough for my five year old to wear it. But he'll grow into it eventually.
3.0,Never will I wear these again.  I ride about 15 miles and these had me hurting after 5 miles.  Not great for long bike rides.  They were very comfortable to wear and fit great just not for longer bike rides.
3.0,Thinner and smaller than I anticipated.  Not a jean material.
3.0,"I have worn this model of Calida bra for at least 15 years. Even though the sellers have denied it in print, I do believe the quality of the fabric has declined. This seems especially true of the gray color. I usually keep a more than a dozen on hand in various colors. The gray color got loose and droopy within a few wearings. And when putting one on a few days ago, my finger went completely through and made a big hole. [I purchased two in the gray color less than a year ago.] Still love the fit, however, the quality of the fabric is inconsistent."
3.0,Received nightgown for daughter which didn’t include nightgown for doll. My daughter was very disappointed!!
3.0,It was too long.  Didn't want to have it cut off and mess up the design.
3.0,Very stiff. Not nearly as comfortable as I was hoping for.
3.0,"I love the purple, but they are just too big for my face. The top goes over my eyebrow and the bottom hits right at the bottom half of my cheek bone.  They are also lopsided so the right side hits higher than the left."
3.0,"I like the cut and fit of the shirt, but the material was meh at best.  I purchased two, one in black and one multi-color. the multi-color had a seam that ended on the visible part of the neckline and the threads were not cut.  I snipped it off, but I think it might come un-stiched."
3.0,"These are flare, not wide leg like the advertised image. They also have three rows of buttons, not two. I like the fit of these pants, however, I can tell they won't last. They arrived torn at the bottom seam and although the material is nice and thick, seems to be thin around the bottom area and looks like it'll stretch and rip again. I expect maybe 3 wears out of this and am not sure how they'll wash."
3.0,Good for lounging around the house.  Material is too thin to wear in public.
3.0,Bought this for a school project for my seven year old. The quality of the sunglasses are good but my son complains that it is tight on his head. If my four year old didn't wear glasses I would have given them to him after the project was done. So good glasses but the age range I feel is higher then it should be.
3.0,Too wide in the legs. Looks funny
3.0,"I love the print and style but the fabric feels cheap and the fit is a bit awkward, there’s no shape to the top half."
3.0,"Earrings were pretty, but one does not clasp at all."
3.0,Was not expecting this pendant to be so big.
3.0,"The printed design was really digitized. From a distance it's cute, but up close it is disappointing."
3.0,"This swimsuit feels like quality material, but the torso is really short. As someone who already has a super short torso, I saw other reviews that mentioned this and thought I would probably be fine, but no. Also, the chest padding was in a really bizarre position, but I think this may have just been for me personally and not actually a fault of the product. Overall, if you have a ridiculously short torso and/or are wanting to wear it very cheekily, this may work for you, but if you are wanting a more modest cut and have boobs larger than a C, I would pass on this suit, even though it is super cute!"
3.0,I ordered size Large for my wife.  She normally wears Size 8/10 US.  Her bust is between a 36C and 38C.  Sizing chart indicated to order the large.  This halter was so small I couldn't even zip it up for her. That was disappointing since the garment is really pretty cool looking.  I'm thinking the vender sizes are just inconsistent and it just chance whether you get a garment that is actually the size the tag states it is.
3.0,I didn’t like how it looks
3.0,Nice but obviously fake looking.
3.0,"The dress runs small, also the purple is more of a wine red than purple the sleeves also are not the same as the picture. I returned the dress with no problem. If I wasn't so bottom heavy and the color was right would've kept"
3.0,Top is cute but the sleeves are much shorter and tighter than in the picture. There’s elastic in the sleeve so it’s not loose on your arm but fitted.
3.0,I'm disappointed in the heaviness of this ear cuff. I may wear it occasionally but not everyday like my intension
3.0,Fit is on the bigger side... i am a 12/14 and it still fits loose
3.0,"It fits like a babydoll top. Maybe it’s because I’m bigger busted, but I was very very disappointed."
3.0,"3 right ones look like the picture, 3 left ones are darker / aren't as colorful & seams well made."
3.0,The hoops should be fine. The screws are too small. Can't even get the curved part in to my piercing.
3.0,"Just acceptable.  They're very pretty, and they fit my feet (I wear size 8 shoes).  But they aren't ""warm""--just slightly heavier than summer weight.  And they aren't stitched well--one sock was stitched crookedly across the toe seam.  And it's annoying that they can't be machine-dried.  If that instruction had been included in the description, I doubt I would have bought them.  I will keep them, but I wouldn't buy more."
3.0,"Color is brighter than expected. The torso fit is good, but the sleeves are baggy."
3.0,"These appear to be made well.  I normally wear a small or medium...they fit.  They weren’t for me.<br />In the picture the outside is grey, hides dirt...not the solid white that I received."
3.0,"This style pajama set is very cute and the colors were exactly like the picture. However, the fabric is a little thinner than expected and the shorts are very long and baggy."
3.0,Fabric quality is not great. The cut and design is pretty cute but the dots are a bit big and the fabric does not breathe well.
3.0,"It's definitely shorter than the pictures show, and I'm only 5'2"""
3.0,Slightly uncomfortable but firm stay. The bit to get off the twist ons we're difficult to get off. And it took me days to finally get the horn twist ons off the extra piece.
3.0,Shoes were cute. But the size was too small. My son is a size 8 and I bought these in a 9 and they are too tight.
3.0,"It arrived on time.  Not sure if I picked the wrong option, but it's a men sized large and too big.  Don't want to deal with return."
3.0,"Not impressed by this.  I thought I would like it more, but it seems more trouble than it's worth. It's well made it seems, but could just as easy become clutter, be wary of overbuying stuff."
3.0,The colors fade in about 2 weeks.
3.0,"Purchased 12-18 month size. Our 12 month old child in 98th percentile did not fit well into the top. Meant for slender child. Bottoms fit well. Cute pattern, arrives as pictured."
3.0,"It's okay,... pretty and well-made, but because it's way to large for my head (and I have short hair), I probably will give it away."
3.0,"These are so adorable, but I am NOT happy with the quality. Since these were a gift for a newborn, I thought I'd be nice and wash them in Dreft on the gentle cycle and hand them to dry. They came unraveled in the washer, but I was able to reshape them; however, all 3 had the thread come undone in one of the corners, so I had to stitch them up before giving them to the recipient. After stitching them up, they certainly didn't look as nice."
3.0,This was a present for my husband he always wanted one.  It was a gift; but he wore it once and hasn't used it again.
3.0,I actually really liked this item other than where the pockets hit. They hit directly on the side of my hips and pointed out in an odd way that made me large. Where the bust fell was very flattering and the length ok. I'm 5'3&#34; and it was perfect with a 2 inch wedge. Without shoes it slightly dragged the floor. Its a thicker cotton material and is very soft and comfy<br />I ordered a small and ended up returning it after trying it on due to where the pockets hit. If you are a little taller they may hit you in a more flattering location.
3.0,printing quality is ok but could use some improvement.<br />fast shipping.
3.0,Decal ironed onto hat. Not a patch. A little cheap looking.
3.0,This was a Christmas gift. The person receiving this product likes the soft texture.
3.0,"It was just a cheap material. Nothing terrible, but not great. I don’t think it will last long."
3.0,"The wristband looked just like it did in the picture when I ordered it, However it was much too big for my wrist and I have a pretty average wrist size. I think it would be nice if it were to be offered in sizes (sm,med,lg), as you could make it bigger but not smaller. I was also very displeased with the clasp as it broke the first time I tried to put it on. So all in all the wristband was pretty,but as far as quality I do not think I would recommend it."
3.0,This is pretty much a bikini top. I was expecting a more cloth material. But still nice
3.0,"I ordered a small and a medium since I wasn’t sure what size to get. I the style was cute but neither one really fit great. The medium was a bit too baggy on me. The small was a bit better fitting in my body but there was a seam that should go under your boob, so when I pulled it down into place it was extremely low cut. You’d have to wear it with the seam going across your boob. The ruching is nice and the material is comfy though."
3.0,"Beautiful dress but if you are very modest, the back is very revealing."
3.0,Doesn't open the bottles that good I always have to do it like 3 times but I like its okay comes in handy . The light went out pretty fast like 2weeks . Very small .
3.0,"Fit was great and seemed to be of good quality, but my daughter somehow managed to get a run in them on the very first wear.  :( She’s tough on her clothes, so it’s possible it was user error and not the product."
3.0,I took 2 star because the fringes look really cheap
3.0,"When I first ordered, this product gave me a pretty wide delivery range (from around January 22nd to February 3rd). It came February 5th, which is one day short of an entire month after I placed my order. The dress itself is nice, and my girlfriend loves it. I think that it would have been nice if there were loops for the belt since she is very thin, and there is a lot of belt leftover."
3.0,"Im giving 3-stars because the length is awful on this dress, I'm only 5'6 and it was near my ankles. The material was nice, the color and all was just as pictured but the length is a lie. I ordered size xlarge and I was sent a 2X which turned out okay"
3.0,Much larger than for a child. I searched for young children’s face mask and this fit my adult face just about perfect.
3.0,"They look great, quality ok. Feel like it does not have enough UV protection as im still squinting to keep sun out of my eyes when i wear them."
3.0,It fit my son perfectly. Very cozy. Only thing is the zipper constantly gets stuck. You have to show it who’s boss. Kind of annoying.
3.0,"The metal rod that connects the band to the watch is too long. Luckily, my old band was falling apart so I removed the rods from that to make this new band fit. Other than the rods issue, the band looks great!"
3.0,"So I love the bag, really.  It's convenient, I love how it remains open, the amount of stuff that I can pack and how lightweight and convenient the bag is.  My main gripe - is that I have a relatively small laptop for work (about 14 inches) and it does not fit properly and has to be at a certain angle in order to fit which is nearly impossible if you have anything else in the bag.  Other than that, it's great.  I think I may want a larger one.  My daughter has the bigger one and likes it better."
3.0,"It’s cute, and looks nice but cheaply made and small across the shoulders- I sized up bc my shoulders seem to possibly be a little broader than most women and even with doing that, it was still tight."
3.0,Says XL...more like medium US size.....quality and print are good.
3.0,Cute dress but a little too short for me and tight in the chest area.  I had to return.
3.0,It wasn't quite slouchy enough for me
3.0,The keychain was great! The card that said World’s Best Dad included 2 cards but both were spelt as Wirrds Best Dad.
3.0,It's a beautiful necklace but I had to add a clasp because it didn't come with one and the necklace itself is really stiff and cut into my neck all day (I wore it close around my neck like a collar).
3.0,"I really liked these when I tried them on but it didn't take long for me to realize that they were completely sheer. With measurements of 34, 27,39 I purchased a medium in the light grey color. The fabric seems thin to me when compared to my other gym leggings and was not what I expected from reading the description, unfortunately I have had to return them. The fit was flattering in my opinion but with how sheer they were I was not comfortable wearing them to the gym."
3.0,"They are cute! Good quality, but too heavy for a key holder. Wish they were only figures, not key rings"
3.0,"Color was not as expected, its more of a warm brown coco color rather than the cool brown as pictured. Over all quality feels nice and material is thick enough but the color was just not there. Also the color is shorter than normal so it was a little odd in length."
3.0,"The bathing suit is a good quality and looks exactly like it does in the pic. The top Does run VERY SMALL, but the bottoms are true to size. I'm a 36D, and should've ordered larger than a Medium considering it looks like it could fit an 8 year old body instead of a matured one.  I'm ordering it again in the largest size possible, but so recommend just keep the sizing in mind."
3.0,Muy pobre la calidad las piedras del chakra estaban chuecas y el presio es muy alto para la pobre calidas
3.0,definitely overpriced
3.0,These are a bit cheap and they were way too small for me. Not a fan.
3.0,Cute! Great color and quality...runs small. I normally wear a large and I’m not sure an xl would have fit.
3.0,Thin material and huge unraveling string attached.
3.0,Ordered my size chart but is too small.
3.0,"I'm 5'5; 113 lbs; 34 B/C; wearing a MEDIUM.<br /><br />1. Runs Small<br /><br />2. The bottoms are a little Loose in the caboose but I also ordered a small and the bottoms were too tight so I sent them back (and I have a flattish butt/wide set hips)<br /><br />3. Clasps are cheap metal.  I anticipate they will break off quickly and easily.  That said, It's also probably an easy repair for any mediocre dry cleaner. Metal clasps are also a tad uncomfortable, but hey, the suit was $13.<br /><br />It's not bad but it is cheap. Bottom line."
3.0,"The size 13 is not a US women's 13 fit at all... 😅 they're cute, but I can't make them work. The shoe cushioning is comfortable though!"
3.0,My son loved this shirt. However a size small is way to big on him.
3.0,"They’re cute but their way too expensive for the minimal/cheap appearing material. I can’t imagine it cost much of anything to make these. Earrings super thin, foam material."
3.0,"On the positive side, this dress is a true dark green, and quite close to what is pictured. It has two real, full-sized pockets. It is a good length, hitting just above the knee on me (for reference, I am 5'8""). The neckline is an interesting shape, without being overly fussy or deeply-cut. The style and color choices definitely seem work-appropriate.<br /><br />On the negative side, the fabric of this dress is not that high quality. From the photos, I was expecting something thicker, maybe even woven. In reality, this is a lighter, slightly stretchy fabric with a sort of woven-looking and woven-feeling rougher surface texture that you can clearly see light through. When worn, that may not be much of an issue, as the color is quite dark, but this is not a substantial material. Moreover, this dress is unlined. The inner side of the fabric is a lighter green (smoother-feeling than the outer side), and there are a number of seams inside the dress, only some of which are sewn-down and lay flat. For a work-appropriate dress, especially one made of this kind of lighter fabric, I would expect it to be lined. As others have noted, the pocket-flaps are unnecessary. Finally, for me, the fit did not work well, as I am different sizes in tops and bottoms. I ordered it in a XL to fit my hips (just over 43""), thinking that it looked quite tailored and would hopefully taper sufficiently (~38"" bust). The dress did fit my lower half well, but I was swimming in the upper half, making it all appear rather shapeless."
3.0,One day a a blue panel fell out and was lost. Other than that it would have looked great
3.0,"looks much cheaper than the picture. I will probably still wear it in casual situations, but I was hoping to wear it over a black dress.....not likely"
3.0,Very good built quality but the performance is not exactly the same as described. Still good glasses to buy.
3.0,"While it appears to be high quality,  I was looking for hiking boots, not winter boots.<br />NOWHERE in the ad does it state these are insulated.<br />I gave 3 stars, as the boot appears well made, but with the extremely inaccurate listing, it deserves one."
3.0,Wound up being too big. But a good product otherwise.
3.0,Leather peeling not good
3.0,Fabric was fine but the elastic around the head doesn’t work for an adult
3.0,"I love the color and fit of this band. However within one week, the gold button that keeps the band closed began to rust. Additionally, I have had an allergic reaction to this metal portion. I believe  it is made out of nickel because that is one of the only metals I am allergic to."
3.0,"Looks like a infinity loop but you get a cuff, not too happy but I still like the color combination"
3.0,"I boughtnmy usual size, XL and it was small and very tight."
3.0,"Everything fit well but the pants ripped at the seam within an hour just from sitting down. Had to duct tape the inside to keep it together. The boot things did not seem to be the right size. They were too small to be of any use but not having them doesn't take much away from the costume so I didn't care. The quiver kept coming unsnapped as well so I eventually gave up on that. Those issues not withstanding, the costume looks great and is pretty comfortable."
3.0,"Super cute swimsuit... 5xl bottom fit me (I've got a large boots and super wide hips... my hips/butt at the widest point are around 52&quot;)  just fine, but my chest is a 38DDD and the top was comically small.<br /><br />That being said- I bought the twisted white and black stripe top with the red bottoms... the cups are not removable in that particular design."
3.0,Love these Matte shades...just wish they wouldn't break so easily...I had to replace them already within days...but I love the look
3.0,LONG “sweater Type” of a dress.<br />Not sure how it would look on anyone under 5’9.  It’s Not a Maxi Dress.<br />It’s just a LONG dress.
3.0,Cute but not dark enough.
3.0,"I didn't realize these lenses ""fade"" from very dark at the top to very light at the bottom. (Is that called ""graduated""?  Just to be clear, there are no hard lines--it's a gentle fade) Some people love this.  I'm not one of them.  I'm looking for replacements for a pair of broken sunglasses and these aren't going to be that.<br /><br />They are very light weight, which is good for extended wearing, but it does sort of lend a ""cheap"" feel to them.  Will they last?  Well, since I'm not planning on wearing them all the time like my old ones, I'm afraid I won't be able to say for sure.<br /><br />As for the style--they feel very 80s to me, but I understand that's sorta' coming back in fashion?  Still, I tend to like a little better peripheral coverage.<br /><br />My personal opinion for these is 3 stars.  If I liked graduated lenses, I would probably go for a 4.  They aren't bad, but I've had better."
3.0,"The material is great. They are very minimalist and I like the feel of them.<br /><br />I bought one size bigger than my usual size as suggested, and it's a little bit too small. I may need one size up and will try to exchange them.<br /><br />The toe box is much too small. My big toe is smushed up against my pointer toe. This might be a sizing issue, but I think it's just the shoe design. That's a big bummer because it means I can't wear them for very long.<br /><br />They are not good for running, which I didn't subtract a point for, because they don't advertise that they are. The plastic soles buckle uncomfortable. That's fine, these are intended for minimal wearing to business functions.<br /><br />I would give this 3.5 stars if I could"
3.0,"Very baggy dress. It looks nice out of the bag, but I just didn’t like the fit."
3.0,"Glasses are cool looking, but a very notciable scratch/scuff on the front part of the frame. Was hoping it was just a smudge but it was a scuff on the frame. Was hoping to exchange, but they don’t offer returns."
3.0,"Large is apparently in the eye of the manufacturer and the buyer.  I should have ordered a medium which didn't seem much smaller from their size chart.  Sleeves and chest are oversize for me, but the garment seems well made, and I'll keep it."
3.0,"Price is good.  The size scale is off, way off. I ordered them for my cousin, who waited till he had them over a month to tell me they were to small. He said they were well constructed and looked better than the  stocking like ones he wear."
3.0,chain is not gold
3.0,"The chain and clasp assembly could be a bit beefier. Fist outing, it broke. Though a very nice design."
3.0,I use this purse daily. I really like the color and the shape. The size is nice as well but if you're not expecting something large and boxy you might not want this bag. Also this bag comes with a shoulder strap which does not attach very well. I really hate how the shoulder strap works and consistently find myself at it
3.0,Larger than expected and has purple in it.  Very nice for $.
3.0,Solo tres Estrella soya m y este me quedó un poco grande después todo 😊 bien
3.0,"The shades are fine; the lens a color I like. However, the picture showed a silver sort of frame with them, and what I received was a golden frame. Doesn't ruin the product by any means, but did disappoint in that small aspect, simply because I already have a pair with gold frames and purple lens. Now, I have two."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:efa4543a25b1b35b4f62e5ad796eea2d]] I have started painting them to match my skin tone. I use a yellow or orange spray paint then cover with brown or copper glitter. I will go back with a permanent brown marker and hit empty spots before sealing paint. The shorter ears sit better on my ears. They actually feel more secure with a mask on.
3.0,For a crew sock this was too long. I returned them.
3.0,"I got these shoes twice, and both times the cute gold chain broke before the end of the night. It was disappointing because the shoes were actually quite comfortable (even for my wide and flat feet), and so cute!"
3.0,"Item returned. Unfortunately, it was too loose even when I normally size small. The color is nice and the fabric too. Great to to be worn during summer but still look casualy-dressy"
3.0,Could be more padded in the crotch area. Less quality than expected or paid for relative to others purchased.
3.0,These look very good from the package but are very thin so when you put them on the color fades. Also they are not knee high.
3.0,"Dress style was nice, looks good in quality but sizing is off by about 2 sizes and the color was more what it looks like in picture not the color as labeled."
3.0,"Despite warnings that the pants run small. I am now trying 2 sizes up. I've never been larger than an 8 - and I'm now ordering a 12. I like the fabric, and feel it offers a great look."
3.0,my sister like it
3.0,"I returned the dress because it was too long. I am 5'3&#34; 133 lbs and I ordered the Medium. It fit fine, except it was really long. I considered having it hemmed but I really want to buy a dress that I don't need to alter. I knew I wouldn't wear it as is so I decided it was best to return it. I really wish they made a shorter knee-length version."
3.0,"It was very loose around the ribcage and had too much material around the bust, so it did not lay properly."
3.0,"This wallet did not have the storage I was expecting it to have. It's a lovely wallet, just not what I was looking for."
3.0,"Looked much better quality in picture, which surprised me because I buy a lot of costume jewelry on Amazon and am normally very pleased.  I would say it was worth what I paid for it, but would not pay more, and it took FOREVER to get to me."
3.0,"I love the color of this sweater, but it developed a pretty severe hole along the seem in the armpit after the first wash (I wash my clothes on delicate, and hang items like this to dry instead of drying in the dryer). My husband repaired it and I still wear it. It's pilling pretty badly--I guess as sweaters do. I would probably try another brand over this one to order again."
3.0,The length was great and very comfortable.
3.0,"They fit very well, but one pair had a tiny scratch at the top of one of the lenses. It isn't bad enough to send them back, but I wish people would pay more attention when they are packing things to keep this from happening.<br /><br />The red pair appears to have more &#34;coating&#34; on them as things appear more yellow than the blue pair when you aren't looking at a screen.<br /><br />I am hoping these help cure the headaches I've been having more of lately from staring at a computer screen, phone or tablet all day long."
3.0,"These are quite pretty but they don’t keep my hands warm on early mornings. I think if it were simply a bit cool outside and I wanted cloves for an evening out, these will be great for that. (And I live in California where it doesn’t snow.)"
3.0,It looks wider in the picture. I was going to return it but I will change the chain and make it work. Does not fit over a collared top
3.0,Pretty top great price
3.0,The materials were very comfortable. However I don’t think it would have lasted more than few hikes. It felt so thin as to be fragile and appeared very easy to rip or tear. I ended up returning them and chose a different pair.
3.0,"The socks are thin, which I don't mind...seem comfortable.  My only complaint is that I ordered Navy Blue...& they're black.  I've already washed them, not paying attention really to the color when I opened them...I'll keep them & wear them but now I still need a dark blue sock."
3.0,Size up! The fabric is great but definitely need to size up.
3.0,Pretty but a little flimsy and I had difficulty closing it.  Had to return.  :(
3.0,Was perfect for Halloween- a bit thin- but did the job. Liked the fit a lot just wish it had not been so see through.
3.0,Looks Different whn they arrived.  Really yellowish gold..
3.0,"Hat is just okay. The material feels standard for the price. When it arrived the brim was misshapen due to way it was shipped, and though it seems you can easily remedy that I didn't bother. I decided to return this product, because while I'm sure it'll serve the purpose of keeping the sun out of my face the hat just looks frumpy and the navy color looks so dull.<br />If you really just need a cheap hat to protect you from UVA/UVB then this will work, but it's not even cute just meh."
3.0,Not as durable as lead to believe. The black of the band and come off even after a day.
3.0,I had to crimp all of the circular metal loops because one came loose and I almost lost it.
3.0,"Cute but a bit thin. I was hoping for a warmer, heavier hat than this. Fleece lining is nice, but the hat feels kinda small and cheap."
3.0,"It's ok, it will work."
3.0,"I liked the earrings, but the 3 of the gemstones fell off right after I wore them for the first time.  I was able to glue one of the stones back on, but the little gemstones on the circular earring were lost.  I think that the gemstones need to be secured better, so that they dont fall off."
3.0,"Got this for my mom for mother's day. She really liked it and it worked well with her fit bit, but after about 5 months of regular wear the rhinestones fell out around the center."
3.0,"I love the concept for our kids and it is a soft product. However, the material bleeds a lot and leaves remains on other items like his jacket liner or winter beanie.  I attached a photo.  I would not buy again."
3.0,Returned... These Fit very tight on my head and the band was uncomfortable. They were pretty but did not meet my expectations.
3.0,"Good quality. They are ok, but they need a pocket on the left front side. They have the pocket for your phone on the front side on the inner pant. And another zipper on the right back.  But a few more pockets would be nice.  They are also a little short wasted."
3.0,I love the color of this skirt it fits high on my waist (at least on me it does) so the split is also high rising when I sit down you can see a lottttt of skin.
3.0,I love them but they fit really snugged!
3.0,runs small so go up one size. It’s not a dark green kinda brighter then in picture
3.0,"The cap was too large. I have the same model cap that fits perfectly, but they have made it bigger. Very disappointed because otherwise the hat is well made."
3.0,I like the flattering style.  I never tried it on so I can't review it. The color wasn't what I expected.
3.0,"Loved the color and shape, but they are not snug on my ears. May fall off if I bend over."
3.0,Are huge on my fingers and do do not fit as knuckle rings.
3.0,Some clocks were missing. Only 18 pieces were in the small bag.
3.0,I like the style of this and color but I wish it was a bit more supportive (32D).  I also find the back digs in at the seam. I don’t wear this bra very often.
3.0,"The necklace was beautiful and dainty, however I ordered the sideways cross and received the hanging down charm cross..it was a little disappointing"
3.0,Perfect fit. I did have to polish the ring as it arrived with some tarnish.
3.0,It’s cute and I like it. But I’m usually a size large and I got this in a 1x thinking it would be big. It wasn’t. It was pretty tight.
3.0,It's not chiffon its silky definitely not what I expected but still very cute
3.0,"I wear size large in most things, this size L was a little snug in the shorts, but the top was fine. Material felt cheap. Lots of static. Returning."
3.0,No purple
3.0,Beautiful and made well. But they still hurt my sensitive ears.
3.0,Fits fine as far as size; however- wouldn’t recommend for tall people if you don’t want short shorts.  I’m 5’7 & they’re shorter on me than I’d like.  I bought these based off other comments as far as height & weight but none of the comments said anything about being short.  Just an FYI for tall people.
3.0,"If you want something similar to a turtleneck, this will work.  I wanted a longer scarf design but this wasn't it.  Seems well made and very warm.  Not as versatile with the short length since it is either on or off with no adjustment for loosening it without pulling it out of place."
3.0,Nice ring. Was to wide. Returned
3.0,"Nice and roomy, has a few different compartments which I wasn't expecting which really helps me organize so I don't have to dig around for things. I'm able to fit in my sketchbook and pencils along with regular stuff I leave in my purse such as my keys, wallet, hand cream, phone charger, etc. It did have a bit of a chemical/factory smell to it when I first got it but after a day or two of being left open it was completely gone, and it wasn't too overbearing to begin with. The only thing I don't really like is having so many handles on it as I like using the strap that comes with it. For the price it was an amazing buy.<br /><br />UPDATE: after about a month the main zipper pull just pulled right off when i was trying to close it. not a very sturdy zipper, and was too long to begin with. i can deal with it as it is and will probably get it fixed myself, but its disappointing to have it break after a month"
3.0,In the image show the flower is white I was expecting white maybe even Ivory in color. I got it and it was yellow a bright yellow. Not a color I am fond of but I still like the necklace so I am hoping it grows on me. Besides that it arrived a week early which was nice and it seems sturdy.
3.0,"Not amazing, but not bad. The pads are stiff and removable. For the price I'm satisfied."
3.0,One of the tight lace at first pull broke.
3.0,The picture looks a lot better than the mask it’s self draw a line on it an that is how mine is one side is white and the other side has all the dark tones
3.0,"These were very uncomfortable when I first got due to being too large. I washed them in hot water and hung them to dry to save the elastic. That shrunk them enough to make them fit almost perfect. I have shorter toes than these are made for but the shrinkage makes them only a tad too long instead overly so.<br />The quality is what you’d expect at this price point. They do have some spots that coming apart but I was able to mend those with some stretch thread and patients.<br />These do help keep toes apart and eliminate blisters from toe rubbing while jogging and hiking.<br />If you don’t know whether or not toe socks are right for you then these are a good place to start. If they work well then go get some good quality ones, if not then you haven’t thrown away $20 for one pair."
3.0,"The first set of jewelry I got from this company was fine, but this one had a flaw. The backs for the earrings would not go on the posts. The holes on the backs were not all the way punched through. When I tried to put the back on one of the earrings, it bent the post. Luckily, I have clip- on converters (since my ears are not pierced). The pendant was not on the necklace, so be careful when you open the package (I almost dropped the pendant)."
3.0,"Came quicker than expected (always a plus) and it was packaged well. The only thing I found disappointing was how narrow these are, length-wise. The outer edges of each lens just line up with the outer corner of my eyes and it gives the illusion that they're too small. However, they're still very cute and a perfect shade for driving (not too dark, not too light)! :)"
3.0,"the earrings are a pretty glass, but just a little large and bold a color for me."
3.0,I don't like the when it get's wet it has a very awful smell
3.0,"I like this tip, but it runs small. It fits, but not in the flowing way shown in the photo. Beware to buy a size larger, or just know it's not a loose, flowy tunic fit."
3.0,"Shirt is cool and comfy, but for me it cut off around the belly button area which I was not expecting."
3.0,This dress was very unflattering so I returned it. It was short and the elastic in the waist is not tight. The dress just fit very weirdly. The quality of the fabric seemed okay and it was very light!
3.0,"This is a lovely sweater.  It is quite large but fits as pictured...The color is a soft orange, I was expecting the rust color as pictured, After  communicating with their customer service (which was excellent) I decided to keep the sweater.  If you have cats you have to be extra careful as the sweater is easily snagged."
3.0,You get what you pay for. It is good for one night. I don't like the colored stiching. It almost looks like a child's &#34;play dress up&#34; purse. Not very spacious despite the size due. If you put too much in it it will bulge on the outside due to the thin material.
3.0,"Overall cute dress for a casual summer party or beach day BUT only for the first 3-4 wears.<br /><br />I bought the gray/white stripe and fit my pear shaped body perfectly in medium (165, 5’3.” Ideal for if you have a small bust and wider hips and even had pockets!!<br /><br />I wore this on such occasions but the product doesn’t hold up wash after wash.  The material is slightly sheer, pilled the arms and looked faded and discolored.  It’s worth the price since it’s so inexpensive but will not last."
3.0,Cute dress and I’ll probably still wear it but is actually made like a sun dress or something. It doesnt keep shape up top like it seems to on the model.
3.0,Wish it would have been bigger but good quality
3.0,"Medium weight, and the screen printing seems to be good quality. My problem is with the fit. The waist band and sleeves are tight and overall it runs small."
3.0,These were made too small.
3.0,This was a nice watch until it broke. Very nice looking for the price. The company refunded us a few months later.
3.0,"Cute top, but runs small"
3.0,hat was damaged (crushed) in box. was able to reshape
3.0,Great product for bodybuilders but I would like to see the pants made about 3 in longer for the extra large to fit a person 6 ft 2 in tall.
3.0,"If you like to show side boob, this top is for you!"
3.0,I ordered a the same type of dress and it fit perfectly. This time it was too small. Very inconsistent
3.0,"Good fit, I’m 5”2, 130 pounds, bought these for CrossFit. I bent over to do a squat and you could see my underwear. Won’t be wearing these leggings"
3.0,"This dress is cute and fits true to size, but the material is very thin. I absolutely have to wear something underneath it. If not I would otherwise feel naked. I would not purchase it again."
3.0,"I got this item pretty fast, but it's much larger than i was expecting per the pictures. I got a 14g and its much wider than it appears."
3.0,Very festive but too big for your face
3.0,An interesting style but did not look right on me. Came in a box with accessories but the frame itself is a little on the flimsy side.
3.0,I was looking for mustard. This was more gold in color.
3.0,"The straps on one boot broke the first time I wore them. Husband was able to fix it, and I do like the look of the boots. Very cheap materials, but comfy boot. Wide toe box makes for plenty of room for warm sox."
3.0,Very thin looks like the material will rip easily. The carrying pouch is bulky and awkward to carry.
3.0,"Purchased for a Halloween gift.  Larger than I expected, not as detailed as I imagined - picture seemed flat and dark."
3.0,Stylish but smelled and they fit too small😕
3.0,I really like it as it is very soft and comfortable.  I personally bought it to avoid chaffing on my thighs. I use it right on the waistline.  Because if i bringing it any higher it rolls down and it's extremely annoying. As this is the part that i hate on most shapewear.
3.0,"Firs great! But the straps on the side of the boobies are kinda awkward and unnecessary, which usually stops me from wearing it unless it's the last clean swimsuit I have"
3.0,they didn't fit. Gave them to friends
3.0,"It’s great to block bright lights although, I thought it would improve seeing better at night time."
3.0,Really a fun style. Lacks in sewing quality and not &#34;finished&#34; on neckline. Good buy for the price. I wear it instead of a jacket fall and spring. I would expect to pay more for increased quality.
3.0,The dress is beautiful but the waist is loose fitting.
3.0,too small to saty on your fingers
3.0,Very cute dress but super thin and see-through. The first day I wore it the tassles fell apart and I had to cut them off. I washed it and shrunk like none other! It is now short enough to be a shirt. Beware.
3.0,"I really do like this wallet. The only thing that bugs me is that the cards do not run flush against the carbon fiber. Otherwise, it's great and I'm happy with the purchase."
3.0,"These underwear are good but the leg band is too big even after wahing. And they ride up the but really easy qhich my daughter does not like. I would recomend ordering a size down and a different style. The brand is good, good material and soft. Just they ride up..."
3.0,"I loved the look of these sunglasses, they are beautiful! They just did not last very long, at all. But that might just be because their sunglasses. Hahaha. But they are beautiful!!!"
3.0,"The skirt is long enough (I'm 5'7&#34;; bust 37&#34;, waist 31&#34;, hips 42&#34;, bra 32DDD); it almost hits the floor.  You can see my feet when I walk.  The skirt does not get caught under my feet when I walk, which is a plus.  I'm giving it 3 stars because the upper material that covers the bust area is cheap swimsuit material.  Very stretchy, which is fine, but the pattern looks weird.  I will probably only wear it as a bathing suit cover-up.  The skirt is double lined and decent quality.  It doesn't make sense to make the upper so cheap-looking."
3.0,I liked the color of the slippers but thought they were a bit flimsy.
3.0,"Bought these because it was suggested by Amazon based on customer reviews. Unfortunately, for insoles under ""high arch support"" search results, the arches on these insoles are NOT high enough .<br />I rely heavily on high-arch insoles, but the really good ones I've gone through (Birkenstocks) were all above the $50 tag.<br />These insoles didn't hit that mark."
3.0,I got this product for a discount in exchange for an honest review.  It works really well. I really like it
3.0,Cute but is too small
3.0,I bought it for my husband got a 2xl and it fits me like a large would.
3.0,"Not sure if these face masks are for children or adults.  They are too tight, not comfortable."
3.0,"Frames are acceptable for daily use; however, disappointed that Ralph Lauren is now manufactured in China.  My old RL frames were made in Italy and had a much better overall finish. Will buy different brand next time."
3.0,"Wasnt the rainbow silver like the pic just flat silver. Definitely not one size fits all, To call them shorts is humorous. They're cheap and cheap quality. Tight cheeky and thin material. But theyre cute and for the price one can make cute bathing suit bottoms out of them."
3.0,"I bought this after I got scratched on my goggles, it gives it more protection than if I didn't have it, but it falls off often so that sucks"
3.0,I had more than a little room. The dress to me looked to be more of a Medium. It was too big everywhere so I had to return. Beautiful dress though.
3.0,"These dresses, as plain as they are, are very versatile. Easy to accessorize around. This particular one however, is see through.<br />I have same dress in different colors made by different manufacturers. The yellow one by this brand is the thinnest one so far. Poor material quality. I can't use it without a slip."
3.0,Not sure why my kid wanted this. But it’s a cheese hat
3.0,"The fabric is nice and thick, and the product is well made. I ordered a size larger than I would normally wear so that, when zipped, it wouldn't pull over my lower torso. Well, the larger size is too large for my shoulders and the hood is heavy and pulls. I kept it because it might improve with a washing or two."
3.0,very comfortable but extremely loose at the calf
3.0,"A bit thin for winter, would be great for fall. Not worth 20$ in my opinion"
3.0,Buy a size smaller than your regular size
3.0,"I love 2 in 1 shorts. Especially when they have pockets big enough for my running essentials. These do stay put so chaffing isn’t a huge issue, but they don’t look amazing. The pockets are great, but the top material lays funny and is unflattering. Overall, I have better ones that I prefer that don’t show off my belly roll, but these are fine for what I need them to do."
3.0,"Loved looks of the jacket, but husband could not even get it on.  His measurements match the chart, so I checked the jacket to find that the sleeves are two inches too short, as well as barely close to large elsewhere.  There was no size tag on the jacket, only on the bag.  Either we were shipped the wrong size in the bag marked large or the measurements are off.  Seller will not reimburse shipping paid if problem is sizing.  Will take loss, no return.  Seller sending replacement."
3.0,"Not too much to say, pretty standard item they all seem to be close in quality. I was really disappointed with the colors though. The green, black and navy are all pretty much the same if they are side by side you can tell they are different but they all could pass as black. Would not have bought this set of colors as that really was a waste of money. Had high expectations for the green :("
3.0,warm-thin but go a size up
3.0,"Mine started to scratch up on the lenses and the &#34;metal&#34; part started to peel and turn green after a couple of months. Other than that, they really did help with headaches and eye strain from working off the computer all day."
3.0,"Pendant Wasn'y quite as good quality as I was expecting...slightly disappointed.  If I had seen in person, I would not have purchases."
3.0,turned black pretty quick. i am sure it can be cleaned but i expected it to stay shiny longer.
3.0,The material is ok
3.0,"Kept our stuff dry, Exactly as advertised. Would have liked it to be more round or wider at the bottom."
3.0,"I like how simple this harness is, but it doesn't fasten to keep the mat in place -- I've found that the mat can slip out fairly easily, which is a bit annoying. But it's very inexpensive, which is nice."
3.0,"no muy buena calidad!! Y me mandaron una talla más grande, tendré que regresar las botas."
3.0,"It's a weird fit. One arm felt more snug that the other plus it's see through. Still like it though, conceptwise atleast."
3.0,"I am 5'3, 165 lbs, 36C. I ordered the dress in a large. It was a little long without shoes on, but nothing that was impossible to walk in. The fabric is not exactly cotton, more like a jersey knit fabric (it's a tad shiny), and the dress fit besides the bust, which stretched out and made the fabric look too light (my reason for returning the item, but if they have it in a larger size I am planning on reordering it). Other than that, it isn't the greatest quality, which I expected, but some stitches did rip when I initially tried it on. So if you want this dress to last a while, be gentle to it!"
3.0,I think these pins are so cute but I do not like the way they leave wholes in my hijabs. It's great to pin something to your sweater but not a good idea for certain hijabs.
3.0,pricey for what they are but they were the correct color replacement.
3.0,It’s adorable but too small for my face.
3.0,"I’m about a week in of having them.  I will say the lenses are very good, definitely polarized. Honestly as good as my Oakleys. However, this pair is less then a week out of the box and the left is lose and I feel will fall out very soon. That being said they are 16 dollars, so after I buy the necessary gorilla glue I’m all in at 20$ for what I would say is a decent pair of glasses I’m not scared to lose on the lake.."
3.0,"I expected this to be long enough to cover my butt so I could wear leggings with it, but it's not. It doesn't cover that low in the back."
3.0,In the photo the shirt appears to be loose fitting and &#34;flowy&#34; but it is not. It is more like a fitted tank top which is disappointing. I know the description about the color said it may be off but umm how does a shirt that is closer to turquoise arrive baby blue... There's no tag to even confirm if I received the size I ordered so I may not have so I will be returning.
3.0,Love these bracelets. Will cost you over $10 a piece at a boutique. The downside is the colors you receive are random.
3.0,It is ok but I was specting the case brown like show in the picture but cames in black :(
3.0,"they looked ok for price, wanted some cheap work out pants cause I'm loosing a lot of weight and didn't want to spend a lot on something that may not fit in a month or two, but I ordered the plus size and was sent the one size. not sure what happened I know I clicked plus I don't know how it switched back to onesize so make sure to double check before placing order. didn't feel up to dealing with returning it so ran them up to work and gave them to a friend, cause they were so little I'm a size 18 and couldn't get them up past my knee that's when i checked the size."
3.0,I like this purse. However the zipper is not the best and the shoulder strap broke. So I can only carry this as a backpack now.
3.0,"Muy bonito pero no es una tela muy agradable al cuerpo es plástico, en la parte de los brazos y espalda la tela no estira entonces se siente una sensación de apretado o tirantes"
3.0,Love the fit & the touchscreen works great<br />But the fingers are too Long!!<br />Maybe if I had dragon nails or something but a size small should have the shortened finger's maybe they'll shrink with use IDK other than that they're warm & super soft
3.0,I usually wear a size 3 or a small and this &#34;one-size-fits-all&#34; skirt barely fits. It is also difficult to wrap and secure in a way that it stays put and doesnt slip and gap in the front. Most of the wrap skirts I have had in the past overlap enough to prevent a wardrobe malfunction regardless the size of the wearer. This skirt would look cute with an under skirt though.
3.0,This def runs large. I looked like I was wearing a curtain 😒
3.0,"I wear a medium/large in us size shirts and ordered a 2X after looking at the sizing chart . It fits great ! Not snug on me but not baggy at all either . My only concern is I’m not sure with the “leather” . My parents both own real leather jackets and theirs are quit thick and tough feeling . This jackets leather is very thin and reminds me of pleather like material . I’m not complaining about it because I genuinely really like this jacket and I was just looking for one I liked in the first place . Just thought I’d mention it though Incase other buyers were wondering . Over all, great buy and I’m happy with my purchase !"
3.0,"The out side jacket is very thin, like a rain coat. Does ot appear that it will be warm enough for winter play, but my granddaughter loved the colors and the fleece jacket."
3.0,Okay for the price. As others have said the breast padding is akward. Suit does feel short and I'm 5'2''. Despite these things I'm keeping it for swimming with the family. Probably won't wear to the beach though.
3.0,size small was little large for me especially in the place of thumbs. so if you usually wear xs size s would be big for you.
3.0,I was hoping to replace my hobo with a more affordable option.  It's obviously cheaper made by the quality of the snap.  Maybe if I didn't first have a hobo I would have liked it more.  It is a little bigger so it's easier to carry my phone.
3.0,"I really like the style of this jacket. I have actually bought 3 different styles of it in different sizes to accommodate for layering. My only issue is that 2 of the jackets got broken zippers rather quickly. Still, I like it so much,  I will probably buy another one. The price is right."
3.0,"Good for the price.  Toe box is wide.  I should have sized down.  But, width is perfect with extra thick socks, but I still have quite a bit of extra room at the toes.  Heel to toe, it fits like a size 7.5.<br /><br />No cushioning inside!  Probably not an all day comfort boot without a cushion insole.<br /><br />Beware!  Bottom of boot has a velvety sole.  It is very slick on smooth surfaces!<br /><br />I will keep since it was such a great price, and mostly fits.  And they are cute..."
3.0,"It's beautiful. It was a little snug, so i suggest to size up."
3.0,I love it  need bigger turquoise stone /sterlingsilver
3.0,"Made a LOT cheaper than I expected, but okay."
3.0,Wish it had more credit card holders. But great other than that. Fits good in back pocket.
3.0,"I really liked the color and pattern of this dress, but the material traps heat in, so it's not ideal for being outside on a hot day."
3.0,One arm already broke off
3.0,Very pretty gift for my granddaughter. She loved it. It is costume jewelry.
3.0,"Like the hat for the price, runs larger than I expected. Medium would have fit better. I'm usually about 7.5 size."
3.0,"Hard to fit a size 10 foot, if they shrink altering washing they won’t fit."
3.0,I like this bra don’t get me wrong but I think It runs a little big.
3.0,I do like the blend of colors. The shirt runs a bit small.
3.0,Got the hat - that's what I expected..nothing special..was delivered by promised time frame. Was in envelop without plastic -which was weird. The key ring...I threw it out.. was some weird cable.
3.0,"The bag is pretty nice, roomy enough for a day to day purse but not quite big enough for a travel bag which is what I purchased it for. I took it on a trip to San Diego and it worked well but then on a second trip to Madison the backpack straps broke while transferring in Denver. Luckily the bag has the handbag strap so I could still carry it but it wasn’t as convenient. It was only used for those two trips and barely used in between. I ended up finding a similar bag at TJ Maxx for about the same price and took the handbag strap from this one for that bag and it works perfectly."
3.0,"It's not the nicest material around but it's passable. I like the design of it. The sleeves are quite loose, which I find a little strange because I have pretty average arm width. I think it may have fit better if I ordered my regular size instead of a size up? Not a bad enough fit to return I guess but I don't wear it too much."
3.0,"Beautiful dress, runs way small!"
3.0,I like it but it doesn’t fit it needs to be be two sizes bigger sin the US
3.0,"For small heads, size 7 or less only."
3.0,"These earrings were bigger and heavier than I expected. Do not buy if you're allergic to nickel. Although pretty, I wouldn't reccomend."
3.0,"I've ordered a size L and it fits like US size S. I'm about 5'3"" tall and 106 lbs. The top fits perfectly and I love the soft material of this pajama but the pants (waist) was a little small for PJ in my opinion. Length-wise, perfect."
3.0,"The quality and style of the outfit is adorable! However, I couldn't give a full 5 stars because it isn't true to size. My twin boys look like a little Winnie the Pooh bears because of the amount of their belly that was hanging out!"
3.0,"They fit well and the material feels great. Only draw back is that the material seems to hang on to stink, which isn't great for a workout shirt. First wash took 2 cycles and still didn't quite smell fresh. I add some oxy to it now so it only takes 1 cycle usually, but again it still doesn't really smell like clean laundry... even though it hangs on to bad odors, it doesn't seem to absorb the clean laundry smell like the rest of my clothes. I have a lot of athletic material clothing and haven't encountered this problem before, so I'm not sure what the deal is with this particular material. I really like the way they fit and was going to order more before I discovered this issue... but I still would if I can figure out a magical laundering solution."
3.0,Kind of baggy in the crotch area fits good everywhere else
3.0,"Pendant was beautiful! Pearls, however, were very lumpy looking and ugly."
3.0,It is a great quality mask and comes with two filters. However it is pretty big so I need to fold the bottom. The bridge of the nose has it so you can seal it to your face. I love the adjustable straps for your ears. It looks good just wish it was a bit smaller
3.0,"they work great, but the aluminum box they came in was all dented up to the point I couldnt even open it with my hands. I had to cut it open with a dremmel"
3.0,"They looked like plastic toy jewelry, but look at the price. They look matched the price. Cute though."
3.0,Very good watch but colour faded and it looks horrible but works well.  Not sure how the back colour would hold up.
3.0,"Runs small, but so cute. I’m so sad it didn’t fit."
3.0,Doesnt fit as expected.
3.0,color is not true red
3.0,"Such a cute outfit. I am disappointed that it is so small. Material is like a stretchy t-shirt that is not as thick as I would hope, as my baby will be wearing it during the winter, but it isn't too thin either."
3.0,Pads of this bra are super flimsy/low budget. They came all wrinkled and warped. Lot the fit of these bras though! Super comfy! I'll just use my swimsuit pads in place of the padding given.
3.0,"This doesn't seem like the most durable of dresses. While it's not tight on me, I still feared the seams were going to pop loose while I was wearing it. Threads were sticking out in various places. The material is also thin. The ruffle on the shoulder is cute, as long as you don't look too closely at it. The design of the ""cold shoulder"" feature is incredibly odd and I'm baffled why it was done that way. It gives an unfinished and cheap look to it.<br /><br />The pictures on this page varied, with some showing a shiny type of fabric. The one I got isn't shiny, thankfully. It's not my favorite dress, but it is cute, overall, and it was pretty comfortable to wear. It definitely needs some tweaking, though."
3.0,"This is a beautiful bag but buyer beware....it is VERY small. The dimensions provided don't really explain the odd interior construction due to the shape of the butterfly. I don't carry much (small wallet, keys, eyeglass case, lipstick and cell phone) and this bag would not accommodate my cell phone...It just plain didn't fit even with the bag empty. The seller shipped the bag quickly, which was nice. I have to pay for the return and 20% restocking. Ugh. This bag would probably work for a night out on the town but certainly not for everyday use, which is what I hoped for."
3.0,Great costume just a lot smaller than expected. Suppose to be a men’s L/XL. I’m a woman who would typically wear a M/L & this was a verrrry tight fit. Couldn’t even sit down in it.
3.0,"Somewhat large, but still fashionable. Although the studs do unexpectedly show on the underside of the bill, this product does not bare any blatant flaws or shortcomings."
3.0,"If you need to look like Mario or Luigi, this has you covered for the most part.<br /><br />The suspenders are good, the hats are alright, my Mario hat was threading out of box, while the Luigi hat was perfectly fine.<br /><br />The buttons don't come with anything to stick them to the suspenders, so you'll need to figure that out for yourself, we used velcro.<br /><br />The biggest disappointments are the gloves and mustaches. The gloves aren't good, they threading really bad out of the box, and the fit is awkward.<br /><br />The mustaches were simply uncomfortable to wear.<br /><br />Overall it's cheaper to get this and a red or green shirt than it is to buy a jumpsuit, and it worked out well for us."
3.0,Loved the look of these but way to tight at the ankle for me and the feet too long.  I thought wearing them for a while would stretch them.  No and  then I washed them so can't return.
3.0,"It’s OK.. Not great but not bad..cute, but not a material I looked forward to putting on my 2-month old.. Also seemed huge on her & I got the smallest size!"
3.0,"I just ordered the wrong gloves.  These look very good and well made, and are probably good for colder weather outdoor jobs requiring dexterity (like working on a car), but I just wanted work gloves for routine outdoor work, and that's not what they're for."
3.0,Third time I’ve bought this hat. Previous two were great heavy material and lasted years. This one is really thin and may not survive too many washes.
3.0,"Looks amazing, giving it 3 stars ⭐️ just because it hurts if you wear it for a long time and it’s a bit heavy!"
3.0,Very thin material. I think they will probably get holes in them
3.0,"Not the highest quality product but still pretty darn cute. The chain was chunky so I switched it out for a different one I had. Gold is cheap looking. Get what you pay for, but honestly not too bad."
3.0,The extender that was with it did not hold the mask like it was supposed to.
3.0,Ordered a 2XL and the top was way too small and the bottoms were way too long.
3.0,It's ok...not great
3.0,"Este articulo fue de lo peor la talla M es igual a XL, NO ES LA TALLA QUE DICE.  Yo soy 5' 2"" y peso 125 lbs y me quedo el doble de mi talla. Estoy muy decepcionada."
3.0,"It just irks me when company’s don’t scrutinized their product(s) before sending them out… one of the pieces had a stain.. it’s little but it’s the principle, esp when I have OCD and paying my money… overall, my 7 year old was excited…"
3.0,"Cute but extremely uncomfortable and not true to size. If I had tried these on in the store, I wouldn’t have purchased.<br /><br />Beware that if you return these items, you may have to pay a restocking fee. I decided just to keep mine and try to find a way to make them fit."
3.0,Too scratchy on my legs.
3.0,"Very soft, comfortable fabric. They stay up most of the time, but are not made for HIIT workouts or vigorous house cleaning. They are not ideal for long legs, as the capri often rolls up to my knees. I should have returned but I convinced myself they would be ok ... I guess I should stick with ankle-length leggings."
3.0,Love this set but the bra is way to small for a c cup. Other than that it is superb quality for the price! Lace is very delicate and pretty!
3.0,They run a little small so I am glad I got the large and they stretch well but they are a weird texture and stiff.  Hoping that they loosen up with washing.
3.0,"It broke within a couple days of having it, it was very cute while it lasted though"
3.0,I bought them in a 2x and they run like an extra large. They are cute and they do stretch but ran small.
3.0,Need more holes in the belt
3.0,it&#34;s ok
3.0,"Fits good,  a little short.  The only real negative is that it is very thin and you need something under it."
3.0,"Extremely see through!! I bought beige boy shorts and you can still see through it. Just be aware of that. But other than that, it’s very cute. Light weight for summer. I love the pockets."
3.0,Cute and it’s better quality than I expected
3.0,"The pair I received were nice quality, but were shinier than other competitors.  I normally wear a small/XS in Colofulkoala and a Small in HeyNuts Hawthorne Athletics leggings.  The small in these were too big and had zero compression.  They were also more shiny than the other brands."
3.0,Nicely! Thanks!
3.0,"Very soft and warm. If you wear it much, don’t walk in it, it tends to wear out fast. But if sitting around relaxing or in the car, it keeps your feet toasty warm and they are SO SOFT!"
3.0,"The XXL is a little small on my (admittedly huge) hands and I do not think they will last very long, either, as the material seems thin. What is this awful clarino stuff, anyway? Cheap leather would certainly last longer than this fragile fake suede."
3.0,Top is not adjustable. Back too loose. L fit chest but back was drooping to my waist. Would be better with elastic on back.
3.0,"I like my glasses with the case, but they look more brown and show very little of the blue as displayed in the photo."
3.0,Had turned shortly after wearing.
3.0,Umm this doesn't actually look like the picture. And the skirt is so thin.
3.0,The ad shows watch has hearts on the dial of the watch but the one I received did not have that.  Had a flower for second hand but no heart just regular clock face.
3.0,"The dress was good quality, but the sizes vary, so if you’re a large you’d have to get an extra large for it to really fit- but there is no extra large. I really disliked that there wasn’t an alternative for plus sized women, but it was necessary i wear this dress. if you don’t suffer from sizing products i recommend this dress. but it’s also tight at the neck and shoulders."
3.0,"While this is the product I wanted, I felt ripped off to have paid over $30 for two pair when the socks arrived, in their original packaging, with a sale sticker of $5 for the two pair.  Felt a bit scalped."
3.0,Met expections
3.0,Product was fine but it turned out to be on the small side so I could not use it. More suitable for a child.
3.0,No it what I expected it to be.
3.0,Not very hard plastic. Arrived with a small crack in the carry on that has gotten worse after one use.
3.0,They get very “pilly” very quickly. Practically come unraveled.
3.0,The sunglasses arrived promptly with a microfiber cloth bag. Good quality but small to medium in size. I will need to heat and bend the frame a bit to use. The blue trim is much lighter than pictured.
3.0,"Very stiff. Good fit, but not comfortable."
3.0,Just okay. Not really worth the price
3.0,Really like this dress but the material makes it hang and fit a little strange
3.0,My daughter loved it but she is disappointed that it does not stay facing forward on the necklace. Thank you.
3.0,Tried it on fits good. Can't wait to wear it.
3.0,I loved this sweater. It fits well though I wish I would have ordered it one size larger to get the true oversized feel. I can’t vouch for quality. I washed it one time with my delicates and the washer was half full. It split at the seam. I expect it’s because the seams aren’t very wide to begin with so it can’t take very much of a wash. If I buy again I will hand wash only.
3.0,Does not fit if using protector. Material feels cheap.
3.0,It loses its color very quickly. Within days it went from silver to copper.
3.0,"Not bad for a shirt... but after first wear, it started to fuzz up! Best if you buy a fuzz remover with it if you want to have your child wear more than one time!"
3.0,Fits good in the waist but the pouch is a little small for average size
3.0,"Very very pretty, just a Lil small"
3.0,"It fits well, being I'm 5&#34;2 not the measurement on the sizing chart,<br />The bottom half fits just have to tie a little extra so it doesn't fall off and have to work on them so they don't trip me.<br /><br />The top half though was disappointing finding just a button and part of the under layer, it gives the illusion that it is 2 pieces but really is just one.<br /> its a $40 pricetag or something to order and have to say for that medium getting up there price, for that range it would of been nicer if it was multiple pieces for the top and make it authentic instead of looking authentic."
3.0,Came in super late and they lost track of it but it still got here in one piece
3.0,"I didn't realize how the bottom of the pants wear, I ended up giving them away and keep the jacket."
3.0,"I've reviewed several minimalist wallets and think it's time to stop. So, Amazon, even if I order them, DON'T SEND ME ANYMORE!  I used to carry a traditional folding wallet, but got sick of carrying stuff around that I don't really need. Now that I'm retired, I don't need so many cards, and besides, using an app on my phone that keeps a copy of the card works for me pretty well. (And I don't often carry - or have - much cash, either.)<br /><br />I really like the exterior size of this Wise Owl wallet. It is a gorgeous piece of brown leather with a nice smooth finish. One side has an embossed Wise Owl logo and the other has a metal or plastic Owl emblem.<br /><br />The seven pockets are adequate for my needs - there are three on either side and one in the center. However, these pockets are really, really tight. Inserting more than one card in a pocket is asking for the wallet to refuse to give it back to you. Putting all my cards in the pockets meant getting a couple of dollars in the center pocket became an exercise in frustration.<br /><br />Now, having started this review by admitting that I have tried several of these wallets, I understand that leather stretches overtime. I filled this Wise Owl with my normal wallet contents and carried it aroud for three days. It didn't get easier to use in my testing and getting paper money out of the center continued to be frustrating.<br /><br />As nice as this wallet looks, as well as it is contructed with nice stiching, this one doesn't work for me. If you only carry a drivers license and a couple of plastic cards, it could easily work for you."
3.0,"(Read bottom for new review)If there was a - star I would give it..What a mess!!  Waded up in a bag...looks used  rope is  dirty,pin makes, hair..and falling apart .. I'm using this for a costume or I would be Realy mad!!....... Ive changed my mind after putting them on.. it's hard not to feel like a badass in his pants...the rings that came lose I supergluled back on and the stans whip right off.... It shows a lot of said leg!!"
3.0,"These would be great for colder weather outdoor exercise or lounging; however, they don't breathe and are too hot to do HIIT in."
3.0,"I ordered the army green and definitely got brown. The dress, otherwise seems fine. It also took forever to ship but that makes sense since it's coming from China."
3.0,The shirt is DARLING and I would give it five stars if it FIT! I ordered a size XL for my daughter who wears an American size M. It's TINY!! I plan on giving it to my niece who is a small eleven year old. It should fit her perfectly. Think child sizes when ordering.
3.0,sewing could be better. nice quality
3.0,"Good quality, right length. While hips are more than enough, the waist was definitely a full size smaller so they had to go back."
3.0,Logo looks nothing like the picture advertised. It looks really cheap. Disappointing.
3.0,"These guys are to tight on the biceps, the elastic its too thin and it hurts, leaving marks on your skin.  The size are running too small. If you have very thin arms they might feet you."
3.0,"These are decent pantyhose and as good as you’ll find for pregnancy for the price, but they only last two or three wears, even without washing, so plan to have to buy more."
3.0,"Shipping was about 25 days from overseas to nevada.  They do try to make up the ship time with free wallet pictures.  I don't like how cheap it looks, I fell it's more an item you win from a shop quarter machine but the kids happy with it."
3.0,Key chain is flimsy and began rusting after a few weeks.
3.0,"Fits small, but is pretty and durable. Not too good at keeping in heat."
3.0,No soft at all very hard
3.0,This part pattern I did not like as I returned them. BUT THE CAMO AND SUGAR SKULL PATTERN ONES ARE THE BEST!!!! I’ll give those 5 stars!!!
3.0,Missing piece
3.0,"I like the look and feel of material. I have big arms and thought it might be too tight, but it's ok. Just unexpected withering the stitch to keep pleats down..."
3.0,"they work, but considering they are supposed to be worn without socks they are a little large. They'd fit fine with socks on, but i bought the size my kid wears in tennis shoes and without socks they are slipping and sliding all over his feet"
3.0,I got these because I have had good experiences with raen but these were not great. The lenses aren't as nice as my other raens- not much protection and not very dark at all and the arms feel flimsy. Seem more like fashion glasses but if your looking for functionality I'd look at another pair.
3.0,I thought this might be a little more slimming in the tummy but it is not. There is not enough reinforcement for my post-baby belly.
3.0,"Disliked fact that it is one size.  Will not order again, way too big, only for medium to large.  I should have realized it would be way too big for xsmall."
3.0,cheap quality and cause my earring holes blacken. dont buy!
3.0,"The colors are cute but the fabric is rough.  I even washed them before giving as a gift hoping that it would soften some, but it didn’t really help."
3.0,"This is a very large shirt. But I'm not complaining; I was aware of the sizing information listed in the description!  The picture is also pixelated, but, hey, that's what you get for a $6 shirt.  The 'HANS' at the bottom is on the shirt, which is shown on the picture and I have no idea what it's there for.  The sleeves look like a regular t-shirt, and are pushed in odd on the picture.  It is a very soft and good quality material, however, and I hope my friend  will like (even though it will be a dress on her)."
3.0,It's a beautiful ring but was damaged when I opened packaging :-( tried to superglue it but not working
3.0,The measurements are wrong.  The height is only about 15 inches.  The fabric designs are cute but the bags are not easy to use.  Very small opening.
3.0,"I gave these earrings a 3 rating… Because I did not purchase them from Amazon but they look identical otherwise it would’ve been a -5. Received my earrings put them on, wore them overnight. Woke up with really sore ears bright red spots which have turned into knots and sores have been treating for four days and no better. I do not have sensitive skin I have used magnetic products before with good results. These hurt!"
3.0,"I had just had surgery on my arm and couldn't put a normal jacket on, so I order this. It was really warm, but very big! Not quite what I thought it would be. But cute and warm."
3.0,"Beautiful dress but extremely small for the size. Chose medium, feels like an extra small. Guess it's incentive to lose weight!"
3.0,Top was too big for my B cups. Bottoms were too small for my hips and butt. I agree to previous reviews on top being too lacey. I cut top lace off as well and liked it better.
3.0,Neck gaiter this is not. This is merely a tee shirt sleeve that has no hem top or bottom. This is basically an oversized seamless headband n now will b worn as such. I like the design but won't repurchase as it is already coming frayed upon delivery day.
3.0,I didn't care for the fit across the shoulders.
3.0,I'm a big fan of these shoes however even though I purchased a size up this style still runs a bit small.  I was hoping for it to stretch a bit but so far no.  They sole is super comfortable but the strap over the foot is a bit tight.
3.0,"So its nice looking and the metal peice that holds the mercades decal is great, but if you want it to work long term you are going to have to glue that bit in there, it falls out almost immediately. Once you glue it though it's just fine."
3.0,Aborable print and soft inside. Outside and inside material much thinner than I expected. Easy to get small hands into correct areas. Work okay for a short period of time out in snowy weather.
3.0,"Still slipping on the floor and mats, toes a little long for my feet. Cheap and cheerful."
3.0,"Great kit, but the actual jewelry caused some discomfort."
3.0,Great for a wall
3.0,"Like the  color, don't like the material"
3.0,…It’s more like a mock turtleneck than a standard turtleneck.  Keeping it because of the color and it will work under a v-nevk i have.
3.0,This did not fit as expected. It was much smaller and I even ordered one size larger. So I would tell everyone order 2 sizes larger..
3.0,"Super cute slippers. But if you have a wide foot, I would recommend sizing up."
3.0,"El color no es el de la foto, es anaranjado flúor, no me gusto"
3.0,I'm 5'6  and 150 lb and a little short in torso and tight. Ordered large
3.0,Not the most durable over long periods. Good for the first few months.
3.0,They are fleece lined on the inside. Not something I want on my head when it is 80+ degrees outside on a motorcycle. Would work great with the Velcro to get the band tight.
3.0,"I was hoping for more versatility, but it looks nice and feels great."
3.0,These were ok the only complaint is that they rip fairly easy. By putting them on alone I tore a hole in them. But they are really pretty soft and comfortable.
3.0,"Huh?  Only sold in Medium?  I bought the medium because I am a woman's Large, or a man's Small so I figured a non-gender-specific Medium would fit OK, but they didn't.  The fingers were very long and slim.  They would probably fit a professional pianist well.  So I'd like to just exchange them for a Small, but they only sell the one size."
3.0,"overall OK,  but the string is broken"
3.0,The first set ripped at the seem after just one day. Let’s hope the replacement lasts longer
3.0,in the picture it shows its pretty long but not on me i am 5'4 and yet the length is very short
3.0,Really tight for the size
3.0,"The fabric is way thinner than I expected. It's bordering on see-through. I just wish it was thicker, but it's super comfy and I love that it has pockets"
3.0,"It is very beautiful. However, the point on the heart is quite pointy. It pokes the bottom of my belly button when I am sitting. Again, it is very pretty but a little uncomfortable. Maybe not an everyday wear."
3.0,"My 7 year old loves this vest but the zipper continuously opens from the bottom on him, but other then that, for a kid i have a hard time getting to keep a light sweatshirt on, he doesnt mind playing hard in this vest so for me its a win."
3.0,THESE EARRINGS ARE TOO BIG FOR MOST WEARING!!! I CUT OFF THE HOOPS AND WLL WEAR JUST THE TOP PART
3.0,"The dress is cute, but the bottom does not flare out like pictured. You’ll need a petticoat to achieve the flare. The bow is a self tie bow, so does not look like image. The fabric was very wrinkly when it arrived and it was difficult to iron. It fit as expected."
3.0,"Love the look, but this is NOT white.  It is off white.  If you are looking for white, buy something else!  Seller needs to change the description."
3.0,"Photo looks great. Real life, it is ok. Material feels a bit cheap, and finishing touches lacking. Buttons are loose and threads are hanging from all the seams. I'd say you get what you pay for, but I can get way better quality for cheaper at Ross........"
3.0,En la descripción dice camisa blanca mangas largas y no vino.<br />Todo lo demás si tal como la foto y descripción
3.0,Not very will thought out on the pockets
3.0,"Doesn’t last, Turns colors within weeks<br />Looks cheap, worn within a month of wearing"
3.0,Need to buy an outfit to wear with these. Not everyday earrings for me. Sparkly
3.0,My daughter loves them but they are already falling apart
3.0,I was expecting 16g..but I got 14g rings. Didn't want the hassle of sending them back. Over all package was good. By the box that held the rings was broken. I say if you want them get them but if you have other options compare them? These were okay.
3.0,It looks fake as he**
3.0,"This does not look like a ninety dollar ring. It looks like something you would get for ten bucks or less at a psychic fair. The stone looks more like plain quartz than moonstone. The setting is ugly, just bare prongs holding it in place. On the positive side the band is pretty and it fits perfectly. It comes nicely presented contained in a branded white box inside a branded pink box. Feel mooned rather than over the moon."
3.0,I love how they started out but it isn't a good buy if you have sensitive ears. I can only wear them a day or two at a time
3.0,"I tried this because it seemed relatively inexpensive / good value, but then the flavor was not great. So I ended up sort of dreading having to cook / eat it all."
3.0,"Super cute designs. But I found them to be hot, too difficult to breath freely in them. :("
3.0,Expected better quality for the price...thin and cheap looking
3.0,Arms weren't tight enough!
3.0,I did not like the color and material.
3.0,"These things work for me. I don't have excessively long hair but it's long enough that when I go running, it whips me in the eyes. I got these and there is some sliding that occurs if I use them alone, but I use a sweatband to anchor them down and they stay right where they are supposed to. Very comfortable. The real drawback is how quickly the elastic band will break. I didn’t get crazy with them but they didn’t last all the same."
3.0,The band is really thick but the material is good quality. Some of the designs are a little weird.
3.0,Wasn't as black as I thought it was going to be a runs rather large
3.0,Does not look or fit like a large more like a small
3.0,"Material is very thin, product is a bit too small. Which I expected. It if It, just fits right and is not as long as I hoped."
3.0,"I've never purchased sunglasses as pathetic as the pair of Johnny Shades that I just received!<br />Both lenses were almost falling out of the frame....the customer service person emailed that this was 'normal "" as they are designed this way with the idea that they would eventually need  repairs and would be easier to work on.... lame excuse to cover up for the lousy quality!.. I'm still communicating with them...we are discussing replacement or possible credit as I write this review....to be continued as to final action taken.......<br />What a waste of money...The Dollar Store has better quality and are 10 times cheaper than these Chinese crap sunglasses!...............<br />Review update:<br />It has been 4 days since my dissatisfied review.. I received a surprise pkg. in the mail today....customer service sent me a new replacement pair of sunglasses...no questions asked!<br />This tells you a lot about a company...first class as far as I'm concerned in regard to customer service.<br />Still doesn't change my mind about the poor quality."
3.0,Product feels cheap But it does what it was made for
3.0,They are comfortable shoes but be careful. They run a little small so order them a little bigger than you would normally wear
3.0,Tight fitting and not soft material.  I have washed it several times now and still feel uncomfortable.
3.0,"I have to admit for the price, these seem to be decent leggings.  I've only worn a few times, so I can't speak for how they hold up, but I can speak to the way they fit.  For someone who is a bit thick, these fit great in my legs without being baggy.  However, they are a bit difficult to get up over my butt.  Another thing I didn't notice when I bought was that these have a visible checkered patter in the fabric.  Just something to be aware of."
3.0,"It's got good coverage and fits okay, but the straps across the back are thin and not very good quality. They twist, cut and pull uncomfortably."
3.0,The bottom toe of the product wore through after the first use.
3.0,I dislike how it’s extremely small on me and I followed the instructions on the sizing and still was extremely small
3.0,Stunning pieces but not enough to make words. I will be returning these.
3.0,Did realise the type of this material
3.0,It fits good just wasn’t a fan of the thick stripes so i returned it
3.0,These leggings just aren't for me. Will hopefully be great work yard work and hiking but I wear leggings most days and I was hoping these would be an every day wear type but they are not. The seams are way more prominent than I thought they would be and they are everywhere and not even symmetrical on each side which makes it worse. These leggings are thinner than I thought they would be and don't cover up any imperfections not runny tuck anything like I had expected. The seams actually make my legs look way larger than they actually are since they are so prominent. Just not flattering at all and not super comfortable either because of all the seams. They will definitely work as beat around leggings when I don't want to ruin others.
3.0,Comfortable but see through
3.0,Brought an extra large and I wear a 14/16 and it was hella small I wished it would of come larger sizes I plan on keeping it to loose weight to wear it. I really like the item
3.0,"Love the fit and comfort of this bra. Have in several colors. However with this order, 1 of the cups does not lay flat along upper border/edge of breast. If wearing a tight fitting shirt, it’s noticeable."
3.0,"This particular bikini just doesn't work for my body, but it might be great for someone with more accommodating measurements. (I'm usually a small in bikini bottoms and large in bikini tops in US sizes, if you can wear the same size in both it might be worth a shot)<br />I ordered the medium, based on the measurements given in product info, hoping the bikini top would work. (if the bottoms didn't I could just mix and match with my other seperates)<br />While the medium fit over my chest and seems like a good size, the elastic around the bottom is so loose that it provides no support whatsoever. It seems I would of needed a small top for some tighter support, but my chest is too large it would have poked out the sides.<br />So, just not for me.<br />The medium bottom was pretty baggy, so that seems true to size."
3.0,"I read the reviews and thought I was okay ordering my size, but recommend going 1 size you if you’re curvy... nice design and material but no stretch to it. Would have loved to keep my set, and loved it more if the robe was a bit longer and had pockets.. unfortunately had to return."
3.0,"Writing soooooo small need a magnifying glass to read. Small piece, may hold a couple of keys. Not what I expected"
3.0,I would've kept these if they didn't make a little fart noise when I walked. I work in a really quiet office so that could've been awkward.
3.0,"I like that the fabric color and texture looks and feels like woven cloth garb. There is some elastic in the waist, but it is not very stretchy and fits smaller than other skirts I've gotten here. I would say the 2x goes up to 44""."
3.0,"As someone who has a certain type of preference when it comes to their clothing, I definitely pay attention to sizing as well as fabric blends.<br /><br />This … shirt … is too thin to be a sweatshirt, but FAR too thick to be a t-shirt. It has rather long arms, so the thumb holes are a great addition.<br /><br />My main problem – the material blend. Advertised as 70% cotton and 30% polyester, I expected more cotton blend. Not cotton on the outside, polyester on the inside.<br /><br />That makes this unwearable for me. Thankfully my mom loved it and wanted to keep it.<br /><br />The sizing is accurate.<br /><br />It is slightly overpriced though.<br /><br />I definitely won’t be getting another one!"
3.0,"Very cute, love the way they look but sizing isn't correct.  Runs very small"
3.0,I like the pocket they are so convenient but these are run small and see through
3.0,10 year olds first watch.  It stops working a few times a day.  It’s not totally broken because we can reset and then it works until it doesn’t again.  My guess is it has to do with the part in the side that you use to set time.  Otherwise very pretty.
3.0,Should have kept this one and returned the other one that broke. May try again. I jsut didn't like this color.
3.0,"I bought these for my husband expecting a nice, thick sock.  They are nice, but not really thick."
3.0,Comes off the watch face very easily.
3.0,They were bigger than I had anticipated but very beautiful.
3.0,These are good quality but just a bit longer than I expected. For swim they’d be a bit bulky. I’m 5’3 for reference.
3.0,bit small for even my 6 yr old
3.0,Not the greatest- but they work.  I wouldn't recommend for most people.
3.0,Super cute bag and I was so excited but it arrived broken :( The closure at the top was broken in two so bag won’t stay closed. Really disappointed... Not sure if so got a bad one or if other people have this issue...
3.0,"Loved the dress, but just too tight. I’m plus size, so I ordered 2x . That’s terrible buying your size and fitting someone who wears large,which is the case for this dress that I brought. HORRIBLE!!!"
3.0,"Not bad. Not special. OK, though...Judy"
3.0,"Have to carry an epipen with me along with the phone, it is hard to find something that isn't bulky that will hold both, and this works great! However, there was no credit card knife in the package as advertised, not that I really needed it."
3.0,"Good quality, adjusting is difficult it does not come with a tool. Shipping time was very long."
3.0,I love the necklace and it looks expensive for how cheap it is; although the chain broke when I took it out of the bag but I am just going to replace it with one I already have.
3.0,"Is small, I thought that the fabric was more giving/stretching but it is not. Not very elastic but nice thick fleece. The smell is also an issue, I washed twice already and the chemical smell won't go away."
3.0,"Love this suit, it's super adorable. The reason I gave it 3 stars vs 5 is because the leg holes don't have elastic around them making them loose and not able to stay in place. After a few steps or going down a water slide the suit slides right up her butt and quickly becomes inappropriate for a 4yo. Bc of this we can only wear this swimsuit at home, not in public. If it wasn't for that, the suit would be perfect."
3.0,The purse is heavier than I thought it would be.  And the shoulder strap broke at the metal part. I ended up not using it.
3.0,"It's pretty decent for blackout, but I'm a side sleeper and it doesn't stay on very well for a side sleeper, but it's definitely better than the traditional style ones you can get."
3.0,"Just a heads up,  item says cotton in the title and description but they are actually 100% silk"
3.0,Only received one pair. Rip off.
3.0,"Pretty but very bold, heavy and gaudy. Would not fit a large wrist."
3.0,They are nice but I wouldn’t call them compression anything. They arrived a bit too big for a normal tank let alone something that is supposed to be called “compression.”
3.0,Very pretty. Very soft metal. Stones do not look as if they could come unset which is great......... BUT this ring looks as if it has been constantly stretched open and then closed again. There's a very weak spot in the very middle-back of the ring (the part that sits underneath your toe). It looks as if it will snap in half soon. I almost want to order a second one and just hope the first one was just a defect. It's just that pretty.
3.0,"Really sparkly and pretty, looks very much like the Sex And The City (1st Movie) purse that Lily carried to the wedding! But it's too small to really carry as a bag. You couldn't fit anything in it other than a standard lipstick, and maybe your keys, and some folded cash."
3.0,"I like the color and style, but the quality of fabric isn’t that great. I’ve washed this a few times and I already notice a significant fade and the sleeves are Ill fitting around the armpit and wrists. It was a decent buy for the price though!"
3.0,"Shipped quickly. But not perfect fit. Needed watch repairman and his tools to properly get adapters installed on watch case. After that, the installation is easy. Watch band is comfortable."
3.0,This is a really cute dress on. I returned it because it was made out with rabbit wool that caused me to itch. I do have sensitive skin though. I would have kept it if it wasn't for that. Ordered a size medium wear a 8 in dresses a little snug but if you wear to long enough I'm sure it would have stretched out comfortably.
3.0,I wanted to like these but just couldn’t. Ran small. Good price point though.
3.0,Material is The cheaper shiny polyester that looks cheap.... another carries cotton spandex one I like better....returned
3.0,"Very pretty, but we were trying it for a wedding dress...just not quite what we were looking for. It will make someone a nice wedding or party dress but not my daughter. She is small but heavy busted so it was not flattering on her but it is very pretty. I would have embellished it with some pearls and sequins had we been able to use it. We will donate this item to our local thrift shop because of the price and hopefully a young lady will find it the perfect dress!"
3.0,"The pack was already opened, which I did NOT like. However, there were a couple of decent cards and they were in good shape (not bent, etc.)."
3.0,Fit is too small plus it’s says it’s Polyester but it<br />Wrinkles
3.0,They’re cute but way too tiny. If you have long nails forget about getting them in.
3.0,"Easy to get on and off. The fastener at the back makes for easy on and off for kids. No more pulling over the head and pulling hair or pinching ears. This is the best thing about these goggles. They Seal reasonably well but have very poor visibility. I’ve had dozens, maybe hundreds of goggles, and never encountered any that were blurry underwater to the point of distraction. And they certainly don’t need those weird ear plugs and nose plugs! Keep looking."
3.0,"The quality of shoes are ok, but the fit are way out of line. I am true 8.5 ( rarely 8), but I couldn’t even squeeze my feet in without forcing in. The shoes most likely are half or even full size off in their food bed length."
3.0,It looks flatter in the photo which I like but I received it and it is a little lifted.
3.0,Was a bit long but tight in the chest
3.0,Not sure what all the hype is about.. these leggings suck.<br /><br />No tummy control.<br />They do not pass the squat test.<br />They do not stay put (even when walking around the house).<br /><br />The end.
3.0,The laces are already fraying im really disappointed I haven’t even been using them a month  yet.
3.0,Not sure these were made in Montana.  Found Made in China sticker which makes me suspect...
3.0,"a link was weak near the clasp. It broke and I almost lost the pendant' Love the pendant, though"
3.0,"the material is soft but it is see-through. I would not wear at the gym, probably just for sleeping"
3.0,"The socks were soft and comfortable, but the anti-slip material on the bottom of the socks started falling off almost immediately as I walked around my house."
3.0,"I like it except for the length, it’s way to short. But I am 5 9 and have long legs"
3.0,Way smaller than advertised
3.0,"Nice and comfortable, but did not last. Got about 3 or 4 months out of them before they just started to have the crotch area completely disintegrate and fall apart. Bought 5 packs, for a total of 10 pair. I was expecting a longer life of normal use."
3.0,"This looked like it could be ok, but arrived with a snag so got returned. If it is going to be on a wrist it shouldn't be easy to snag IMO."
3.0,"First things first, I love these gauges. They are beautiful. There is a small issue tho. Due to the fact the stones are real they are heavy. The weight of the stone pulls the gauge forward. I have to be careful not to let them slip out of my holes. Even with the back screwed on the gauges can pop out. I have to be cautious while wearing them. I think I might take them apart and hang the crystal on a sturdy tunnel."
3.0,Very small. Hard to see turtle
3.0,"They do the job. Good, not great."
3.0,This is a pretty blouse. I ordered a size 10 and they sent an extra large. Thought that was really weird and that somehow I ordered the wrong size. Turns out the XL was too small! I normally wear a medium \ large in tops and a 10 \ 12 on pants. I had to return item. So just beware it runs small. My mistake because I did not look at the size chart! Fabric feels cheap but does not look cheap
3.0,"Be careful with sizing, I am 5'3&#34; and 134lbs, I ordered medium according to reviews and size chart. Too small. Like a size 4/5 maybe. I returned and will try the X-large to curb the impossible sleeves and bodice fit, will report back stay tuned...Lol Very pretty dress hope it works!"
3.0,Decent quality for the price and can actually be worn- not a cheap prop.
3.0,"No me agrado el reloj,ya pasaron de moda,son muy pequeños"
3.0,"I really love the material and colors, fits okay but a little short for me and I’m 5.2  And a little to puffy on the stomach area but good for now. You do need someone to zip you up, plan to keep it"
3.0,I purchased this item for VBS fun.. It meets my needs and helps accessorize my costume. works for me Thanks
3.0,Its a nice coverup but the fabric is think and doesn't hold the thread in the seems well. I have a hole after one wearing.
3.0,"La blusa es preciosa, muy buena tela, pero la size medium queda estrecha en la cadera, por lo que para nada se asemeja a la foto"
3.0,"I've ordered a small, medium, and large in white...all three where different shades of white. Only the small size was what I consider white. The others were off-white to cream. Not good for dying IMO, which is my goal."
3.0,Criss cross bodice too tight and restrictive compared to rest of dress. Returned it.
3.0,"The fit was perfect for the size that we ordered.  The cotton isn't very thick, more of a cotton T shirt quality.  Have not washed them yet, so hopefully they don't shrink."
3.0,Love the jacket but it's way too small!
3.0,Bought this for my son's school project looked good for the price.  The strap did come off a lot an easy fix but annoying still.  Overall for the purpose of a 2 hour school assignment I am pleased
3.0,"Length is right, but since stride rite fought out robes and went to China to manufacture the shoes are waaaay too wide. Still work for around the house, but the fit is not ideal. Don’t make like they used to."
3.0,"Ordered this for a Halloween costume party that we didn't end up going to so I returned it. But trying this on, it was so super thin and showed every dimple and clothing line from bras and tights. I didn't like it."
3.0,I ordered the pink one size large. There was no drawstring so it was loose on my waist no good fit.
3.0,Ordered it a size up and it was still too tight.. But overall it was a nice dress.
3.0,Neckline is much larger than than shown in photo
3.0,"I was impressed with the quality, but upset that it arrived with stained lines right in front on the belly. They’re very visible due to their location. That’s why I’m giving the 3 stars. Because it was so close to Halloween, I didn’t have the time to exchange it. My pic is just from trying it on, & not the finished product. It is fitted, but a little stretchy. I’m 5’7”, size 8/10, & ordered the medium. The headband is of better quality than I expected too."
3.0,Ordered this in hopes of wearing for my wedding rehearsal dinner. Ver pretty but looked extremely modest and youthful on me.
3.0,Seemed solid and good quality but I could not get it to fit or stay on my earn unfortunately. I had to return it.
3.0,This bracelet is very cute! Great for special occasion but not for everyday wear as the color will be come tarnished!
3.0,"Nice fabric, but the slate gray is actually very blue"
3.0,"Unfortunately, the quality is not as expected. Bummer. They are comfy and pretty enough (for undies), though very see-through."
3.0,I absolutely love this hoodie but its not anywhere near actual size. I have another hoodie from them so I thought I would order the same size. I was wrong.
3.0,"Comfy and fun but I'm 5'8 and it did not fit as a maxi, it is short and more for girls with a smaller chest. Having said that it is a fun comfy fit can wear with chucks and a jeans jacket or around the house and be fine with it."
3.0,I like the peplum style of the shirt.  I am a solid size 16. After three washes it is tighter and the color faded a bit.  I think it is really cute and but I don't like paying for something that shrinks.
3.0,The clips don’t really latch on and they break easily
3.0,One of the backs of the earrings is broke
3.0,"It fits and feels great, however, this &#34;navy blue&#34; I'm fairly certain is black.  Although the color of the stitching on the pony is accurate to the navy blue one,  either this is black, or the one i received is at the very least 8 shades of blue off, it's no where even close to in the ball park as the color depicted in the picture."
3.0,"Thick enough and longer than I expected, but full of static and pilling the first day I wore it."
3.0,I did not receive the glasses I ordered. The ones I received were not for driving at night. I kept them because I didn't want to bother with returning them.  the ones I got looked good and will work for daytime.
3.0,"I am 5’10” and about 155lbs. I ordered a medium, but should have gone for the large. Though very stretchy, the edges do rub a bit under the arms as the material is very rough. Still, the fit is very cute and the slight shortness of it should be fine with high waisted pants."
3.0,"very thin material, looks way cheaper in person than in photos."
3.0,The zipper was broke so i returned it. But it was a very pretty outfit
3.0,"it is comfortable, mediume but it's big. however i like the material"
3.0,"Sized small. I ordered a size 9, and it fit like an 8. Tried it on, and it immediately turned my finger black. In like a millisecond. Disappointing."
3.0,"This ring looks like the living embodiment of Grimes. It doesn't fit, looks awkward, but still does the job."
3.0,"This company has amazing designs, unfortunately the one-size-fits-all was too small for my head, even with the snaps completely open."
3.0,"I wanted a replacement pair of sunglasses that looked like my current pair because of the scratches. This pair looked identical online, but they are much bigger than my current pair. I have a small, heart-shaped face shape, so big gladded make me look like a clown. I will keep these in case of an emergency because they were so cheap, but do not plan on wearing them."
3.0,"I bought it for my son. He does like it better than wearing a mask, but, the fabric is really thin."
3.0,quality not ideal
3.0,The band was really cute at first but then it started to attract lint & started to look worn out. It lasted maybe a month if that until I had to buy a new one .
3.0,"These are a quality product, handsome in design and sturdily constructed. They are also effective in cutting noonday glare, which is the whole idea of polarized sunglasses, and the price is certainly right. Unfortunately, the frames seem to be sized for a face larger than mine. They never feel entirely secure, and the temples (ear pieces) are not adjustable. I also find the curvature of the lenses produces &#34;ghosting&#34; at times, little blobs of light at the edge of my peripheral vision. My solution is to wear a hat with a brim, shading my sunglasses from the sun. It works. [grin]"
3.0,"Pretty good, but the outside of the egg is very sticky, had to poweder it in starch like I do with my other silicon Squishies, which makes it so the surface is fogged, the surface is already pretty foggy though naturally, so I chose that over it being unpleasant to the touch. Also you can't squish it very hard of the egg part balloons out, and the figure inside can stick to the inside... Because of the cost though I think it still worth it, just needs some altering and being gentle..."
3.0,"There was nothing wrong with these earrings, per say, but the hung a bit weird and pointed outward on my ears.  The earrings are beautiful and well made, definitely worth a try"
3.0,"I thought it ran big compare to Longitudes version, also straps very thin."
3.0,"The dress was true to size.  I dressed it up with a shawl.  The down side was that it was about 4 inches too long and cost as much as the dress cost to hem.  Otherwise, it was good."
3.0,"This band is nice but very difficult to connect.  The silicone at this part seems to be a tad thick.  I make it work, but now easy."
3.0,"Nice colors, i wear glasses and it was just uncomfortable to wear with them on."
3.0,"Seems like a good quality slippers, soft on the inside, warm and pleasant to the touch. The sizing is way off. XL (US size 8-8.5) is more like a 9.5-10."
3.0,"Very large, I was looking for more of a weave effect to the fabric, the brownish areas seem to have that, the navy areas look like navy felt fabric. Rather stiff fabric that does not drape the way I was hoping, perhaps that will change with wear. Medium weight and good for chilly weather. Some flaws in the fabric, not a high quality piece but for the price I feel it is acceptable."
3.0,These aren’t real leather but look quite nice. Size L fit my husband well and he said that the Lining felt good as well. Hope they hold up as with warm weather he won’t be wearing them for 6 mths.<br /><br />Received these free in exchange for review.
3.0,I like the product but it’s very hard to use- or attach the necklaces to. Good idea but hard to use.
3.0,"Need to order size 3x for my husband who is a 34 waist size.  Yikes!  Also, I asked the supplier if I would have the shipment by Christmas and she said yes.  Unfortunately, did not arrive until January 10."
3.0,"I got this for my 3 yr old. It's very cute but beware, there will be ironing to do and I hate ironing! The material is thin and lightweight but not see through.  I just hate how wrinkled it gets even after wearing them! Also the trim on the neck is a different color and it makes it look like it bleed or something. I don't care for the trim at all but I do really like the style of the dress"
3.0,"I like the look of layered necklaces generally, and this one does pretty well for the price. The 18k gold layering may be a tad too shiny but looks pretty good on Zoom where my wardrobe currently has its tests.  The main chain ends above the collar bone and has an extender but it's very very thin and extremely difficult to hook and use. The 'choker"" chain is exactly that--goes around the base of my neck, and that's at maximum extension. The product page shows several lengths for it, but that was the only one I was able to make. The layered necklace ""look"" goes well with a lot of things and this one is inexpensive enough that I'd recommend it for people who want to experiment."
3.0,I got a medium for my 7 yr old son and I’m disappointed because it was soooo tight I could barely zip up the zipper in back. I’m afraid the fabric is going to rip away from the actual zipper. Otherwise it’s what I would expect for a costume.<br /><br />Your could see the hot glue that attaches the eye pieces to the mask. Thought that was kinda tacky. We are in the process of returning and I will be searching for another Spider-Man costume that will fit. Not sure if I will order the same one again or not.
3.0,I purchased this dress after extensive reviews of the product and size description. I purchased a XL in Navy/Red. According to the size chart this dress should have fit 44.5 in chest and this dress should have fit. The hip area fits perfect and the length was perfect. I am assuming it may be that I have wider shoulders. I am a 36DD and 170 lbs and 5'2&#34; . I have ordered an xxl so we will see if there is a difference. I am a prime member and it shipped free and returns are free.
3.0,"I ordered my bra size, 30D. The cup seemed just a tad small. But honestly, I would keep it if it were for how the halter straps are sewn to the cups. It didn't fit my frame, made my breasts seem kinda cut vertically in half. Not very flattering for me. Otherwise, it seemed the band size was perfect and the width of the straps were great- I would feel secure in a pool. But I will not be keeping it."
3.0,It's a lovely shirt but go up by 3 sizes if your arms are not big go up by 2 sizes.
3.0,"This top is okay. A very basic long sleeve top and the quality is decent for the price. The main reason I decided to return is because of the fit. If you're looking for a loose fitting top, then this will work. I like my tops to be fitted, hugging my curves and this top was way too baggy around the waist for my frame (bust=35&#34; & waist=24&#34;) making me look like I'm pregnant :( I'm 5'7&#34; tall and the length hit just around my hips. Hope this helps!"
3.0,Smaller than it looked
3.0,Pretty band! My only problem was that the long silver part around the watch continuously hit the side button. I ended up returning the item.
3.0,This T is more to the fitted size than regular fit.
3.0,"This product gets stars for being cute and looking exactly like it's pictured. I wanted to love it, but it didn't fit well. I'm not sure if it's just the type of lace used, but it just kind of rolled up and wouldn't stay on my leg. I ended up returning it."
3.0,This product would be better is the straps were detachable to use with other underwear. Have to wash these after every use which severely limits the products utility.
3.0,it've quite long and rough on the bottom lace.  i know i will be wearing something underneath but stll...
3.0,I'm 5'5 and 165 pounds and I ordered a large. It does fit kind of small but it is doable. It fits tight in the hip area but I'm just gonna wear something under it. I like the way it looks on me and I would just recommend a bigger size.
3.0,"It’s okay. The sweater looks wrinkled, quality ok for price. Looks a little cheaper, lines don’t match with stripes well. I thought the brown would be a little darker, but appeared lighter in person. I kept it bc it’s comfortable and fits well, but wouldn’t have picked it if shopping at the store."
3.0,It is costume jewelry and I didnt pay much for it so for that it got 3 stars. The chain is super thin and small. Worn twice and that ended that!
3.0,"Very nice looking, but way too tight to fit over my Ray Ban Justin frames. Tried stretching it out with a pencil that is thinner than the frames, but the material and stitching tore. Definitely are not universal for size."
3.0,Overall nice but long and a little thin.  I had to roll them under to make them not to long to wear.
3.0,"Nice fabrics, well made, but run very small."
3.0,The material is nice but it doesn't tie right. The material from the front overlaps in the back. Feel awkward to wear. But I'm small so that may be why.
3.0,"Well-printed but VERY scratchy. Not sandpaper, but the polyestery-feel can be uncomfortable against the skin."
3.0,"These glasses are very comfortable, but like some other reviewers said, they feel fairly flimsy and I have some distortion in some areas of the glasses.  I bought them to use in the yard, so they're okay or fine, but I wouldn't buy them again, and because of that, I don't recommend them."
3.0,kid is not complaining but its a bit loose. he wears the same size in regular sneakers
3.0,This outfit is adorable.. its super soft.. and great for cold nights.. I ordered an XX-Large.. the pants fit great.. the top is a bit tight.. the sweater/robe is extremely small.. it barely covers my shoulders which makes it uncomfortable to wear.. if it wasnt for this one fact.. I would def give this 5 stars..
3.0,Amazing quality however sizing is off. Order two sizes up. Ordered small and it fit like an xxs. Had to return item
3.0,"I should have paid more attention to people's mentions of sizing in the reviews; the waist on this pant runs small.  The 32 waist feels like a 30 or 31.  I purchased another MK pant in a different style and noticed the same thing, so maybe it is how all MK pants are.  No, I didn't get larger around my waist hehe; I recently purchased pants in two other outdoors brands which fit normal.  Probably returning, can't exchange because price has gone up $25 since last week haha...bummer."
3.0,Great pants just size way up like 2 sizes
3.0,"Purse was great for a couple of weeks, but the zipper broke and now it is useless.  I had minimal items in it and the zipper came apart.  Thankfully I didn’t lose any important cards."
3.0,"It does not fit like a normal baseball cap, it's more like a painter's cap. Seems to be well made though."
3.0,pretty flimsy
3.0,"The top is so cute and fit like a glove. I'm a 34dd and the medium top fit great. Note the top is NOT adjustable.<br />The bottoms fit too, however they are higher rise than I expected and wasn't flattering.  I ended up returning which I am so bummed about because I really wanted to love this suit. If they sold it separately I would totally buy the too."
3.0,Zippers can be difficult to zip/unzip but it fits my Sony a6000 perfectly with the 55-200mm lens. Unsure if there is room for the smaller lens as well.<br />The reason is rated 3 stars is because it doesn’t come with a strap like the pictures show. Yes i checked all the compartments and there was no strap
3.0,It is ok. About what I expected.
3.0,The soles no longer provide as much cushion as before.
3.0,"I really wanted to like this dress... i was going for a boho chic look. it looked great on the model.. on me.. not so much! I felt like an old lady. I think this style of dress looks great on very thin girls with a smaller chest<br />For reference, I am 5'5, 145lbs, and 36D<br />The material of the dress is nice, it fits as expected, i went by the size chart<br />I did really like the double slits on the side<br />At the end of the day, it is great quality, fits as it should, but it just wasnt my style.<br /><br />Please let me know if you thought my review was helpful!"
3.0,To small had to return. Did not like the material or the way the dress looked. More of a young girls dress
3.0,Waste is really small even with the 2x and the material  is so cheap doesnt look the same as the picture  but it is cute id wear it since inalready bought it but wouldnt buy again. I brought the camo green outfit and also the leopard one.
3.0,Fits okay but rolls down from the top.
3.0,Just not what I was expecting
3.0,I ordered it in green and the dress that came in was a bluish teal
3.0,It was way bigger then I thought so I returned it.
3.0,"I actually love the dress, the material is very comfortable and it fit well, however, I ordered the yellow and got a blue instead. I will be keeping it, but I really wanted the yellow."
3.0,My son LOVES this movie so I got him this and it was too small when it should of fit and the quality of the pic isn’t that great plus it’s cheap looking I was disappointed
3.0,"Great, good fit. Will purchase another one."
3.0,"Great quality. High waisted cotton underwear. Band goes all the way up above my belly button keeps my belly supported and comfortable. Underwear has full coverage for your booty (I have a huge booty). These don’t feel like granny panties, they feel more like a retro sexy modest underwear. Great for sleeping, period days, and everything else. However, Sadly after a month of wear they are tearing apart from the seams. Why???"
3.0,The xl is to short and shrank when washed
3.0,"Not as long on me as the picture.  The colors are wonderful, but took FOREVER TO GET HERE. I ordered the largest size they have and it just fits funny."
3.0,Ordered the wrong size so they are really big
3.0,"ok, not amazing 3 stars"
3.0,"It's cotton so I think it will shrink but the arms, the waste,  the length are all too long in big! I should have got a small. Keeping it tho."
3.0,Normal simple sunglasses are feminine and the finish is very suitable for its price
3.0,It's the correct colors and everything but it's definitely small sized. 2xl  is like 1xl.
3.0,These ran a lot bigger than I expected.
3.0,Although the pic on the product page shows the tortoise look on the arms and the face piece. In the product I received only the arms appear as tortoise. The past that frames my face is black. I'm disappointed. I did not want black. The shape is devine! Wish they appeared tortoise.
3.0,"The pants are low waisted and run small. The black set is cute but just a little small in the fit. Order a larger size. The black set is to be line dried, not thrown in dryer after washing."
3.0,I attached this as a zipper pull.  Center fell out after first laundering.  I re-glued it and hope it holds.  It should have been glued more securely.  To remove it each time garment is washed is unnecessary.
3.0,Cute hat but too small for my five years old boy.
3.0,"These were a daily deal, so I couldn't pass that up. I got this pair as well as black. So far, so good."
3.0,"I purchase a XXL because I wanted a top to be super loose and comfortable (I normally wear a XL). The problem is, it's more like a large and is constricting. It's also fairly thin. Not worth the effort to return, I'll just donate it. Disappointed."
3.0,This fit me good but the waist band might be tight on you. They look really cool but the quality is just ok.
3.0,"These are OK. They shrank. I think. It is hard to tell because they are supposed to be tight. I do not like that the design leaves an imprint in my legs. I do not have large calves. After a long shift, the imprint hurts a bit when I finally get to peel these off. Otherwise, they’ve held up OK."
3.0,It's a nice watch my boyfriend loved it only thing is the face is a bit small other than that its ok ..he loves the internals
3.0,"I ordered a Medium and got what appears to be a large. Otherwise, great product"
3.0,You get your moneys worth
3.0,This was not a good buy.  I purchased it for my daughter for Christmas and I ended up returning it because it looked very cheap.  She did not like it and I don't blame her.
3.0,"This Outfit Is So Cute , But Not True Too Size At All !"
3.0,"I liked these sunglasses but I didn't love them. I was looking for a pair of over sized sunglasses, these aren't that big."
3.0,Not as heavy as I thought it would be ...have to watch it to make sure I haven't snagged it on clothing & loose it
3.0,Very cute  but it runs big. I’m 4’11 and 127 lbs but it runs pretty big
3.0,"Comfortable, fits well, and is cool, but the blue color is not colorfast and will bleed into the white areas on first wash (yes, followed the washing instructions). Had to return this one as a result. Other colors of this shirt were less problematic."
3.0,"Cute as a gift, but not practical for babies."
3.0,"What's pictured is not what was actually delivered. Like others have mentioned the eggs were replaced for beer. The packaged strawberry one next to it is missing. Also the watermelon one was replaced with oranges. As far as the correct ones go, they are cute and lightweight. Overall still good for value, but the photo and description needs to be updated or changed."
3.0,"These are so thin that they’re actually see through, but they are comfortable."
3.0,Too large for a girl and all the charms are bunched up in one place. Returned
3.0,It is made well and looks good on just need to size up since there isn’t much give.
3.0,"The dress is really cute the only thing is that the lace in the back does not fit the way it should, it seems like it is very cheap material so there is no cling in it and they did not know how to sew it to be the way it should fit like in the photo, Also the lace that is on the dress I received is very fringey looking, I am assuming this is due to the low quality. It is a cute dress and I will wear it but if I will not be wearing it to the occasion I had originally ordered it for"
3.0,Wouldn’t even fit over my 11 year olds head. Cute designs though.
3.0,nice...great material..runs really big.. order size down
3.0,The tie was okay except that it came with small mold stain on the inside neck section.
3.0,beautiful but too fragile!!!
3.0,"They are really cute, just too big for my head- slips off my face all the time"
3.0,I order this sweater in a small & I really do love it as it's comfortable & nice  however the sleeves are way to long for me & also big for a small
3.0,"The red is a gorgeous shoe but not as pictured here.  It has a gold tint. Very pretty but won't work for what I ordered it for, as I was expecting a totally red shoe. The fit was very good though and it's relatively comfortable for the height."
3.0,Super cute... if I was 6 ft. I'm about 5'3&#34; and this goes to my knees in the front and mid shins in the back. Should've gotten it a few sizes smaller.
3.0,"I was expecting it to be looser.  I actually saw this on someone and asked her where she got it from.  She was my size and told me what needed to be ordered.  It is comfortable, but shorter than expected and not as roomy."
3.0,Good for the price but holes are small on the base stand and you need to add a lot of pressure to screw the metal part
3.0,Fabric quality looked decent but the print was subpar. Printed graphics looked pixelated. I guess you get what you pay for. I bought the product as a gift but returned it before gifting so no fit data.
3.0,I loved my first one so much that I replaced it when it looked worn.  The new one is enough larger than the original that it doesn't fit in my small cross body bags.  It does hold more cards but that wasn't my goal.  I'll keep but just won't be able to use it all the time.
3.0,Great material and nice quality buttons. Fits a bit small so order size up. I’m 5”11 and They were long enough. Cut and style is okay.. not something I’m dying to wear but I’m not returning either
3.0,"Not a high-quality strap, but for the money, it is good quality and serves its purpose.  If you are looking for a decent strap for a lower end - mid range Seiko, this is perfect.  I rated 3 stars because the Deployment buckle comes undone if you don't put it on just right."
3.0,"I’m 5’2”, 110 lbs and the small was big on me. I have to tie it extra tight on both the top and bottoms for them to fit better."
3.0,Cool for a minute but charging sucks and they are difficult to use for kids.
3.0,It's very cute. It is much larger than I thought. I'm 5'7 & weigh 140 lbs. I bought large and it was bigger than I'd like. But it's very cute for the price. And the fabric doesn't look cheap at all.<br /><br />I was not paid or asked to leave a review. I like to leave reviews on all of my things because I'm a mom and love cheap deals :) Would buy again just wish sizing was better.
3.0,The dress actually fits below the knee. Kinda ill fitting. It might be better when I'm 9 months pregnant.
3.0,Fit fine with glasses. Perspire around the edges to the eyes.
3.0,The price is tempting to have work out shirts. Bought for my son for cross country- these are heavy polyester ? Not lightweight workout shirts.
3.0,They are really cheaply made boots good for wat i used them for but if u are looking for winter boots for your child or long lasting these are not for you .. they are really thin i sewed fur onto them so i like them just think they’re more like 10$ Boots 🤷🏽‍♀️
3.0,"I bought these as replacements gloves to help me wash dishes for a large hotel on my island. I tried ordering them once but they got lost in transit, I tried again and was so excited to try them out when they finally arrived. Putting them on felt great although a little tight! (The last ones I had were chemical gloves so fingers were kind of bulky/ fat when washing the dishes). So I was very happy to finally be able to feel my fingers and get inside the dishes easier. About 4 days into using them I realized my left hand was feeling wet/ cold after each wash so I finally checked them and imagine my surprise when I saw the hole.. I bought them because the tag lines in the pictures were like ""strong/ extra durable"" they even had a tool trying to bore through it. That really depressed me but luckily I have a second pair to use but when those are done, unfortunately I have to look to someone else to buy gloves"
3.0,"This purse is cute, but it just looks so fake. I got no compliments on this purse whatsoever. Really disappointed."
3.0,Love this outfit for my bday... too bad the top was small and the skirt cuts my circulation.
3.0,"Nice and thick sweater dress, but a bit scratchy in feel."
3.0,"Too large for my fiance even after adjusted to the smallest size, so she asked me to wear it. It's pretty though and I got my proposal passed, which is the most important thing."
3.0,Tightening the straps are difficult. You have to have another person do it or take it off and put pack on to make adjustments.
3.0,"Wasn’t really happy with it,"
3.0,The mask have beautiful designs.  The only problem is that the size of the masks are not sufficient to cover nose and mouth adequately without making continuous adjustments
3.0,"this did not fit true to size. I ordered one size larger than normal,and it fit small. My daughter, however , was very happy she got the dress."
3.0,"Tienen un colorido muy bonito, pero son muy frágiles, se abren fácilmente y se le salen las baterías. Llegaron varios abiertos y cuesta mucho ajustarlos nuevamente"
3.0,"The dress is really pretty but very cheaply made. There are strings hanging off the black lace everywhere- the lace looks poorly attached on the &#34;belt&#34; area and it just looks like it is not expensive. The zipper is also one of those SUPER cheap zippers that gives you a few zips before it breaks, literally. Mine arrived broken and I was in a crunch so I thought I could still try and wear it to the wedding I went to, but the day of the wedding it broke even more- totally ripping. I was really angry- but I guess, you get what you pay for. A $34 dress is only going to be $34 nice, right?"
3.0,"Thin material, rather night gown than a dress. Doesn't looks like picture unless you wear something under.<br />5xl is 3xl, actually, its smaller than it says."
3.0,"THIS BAG WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT IF THE SNAP ON THE CELLPHONE POCKET WAS MAGNETIC, IT'S NOT."
3.0,"Good quality fabric, but this is a WIDE tie.  Will have to wait another 5 years at least for it to be back in style."
3.0,These sweat bands are inexpensive and do the job.  No more sweat constantly running into my eyes.  Not a 5 star rating because they start coming apart after about 6-8 times through the washer.
3.0,"This hat is lovely, but far too much bling for me.  It would look lovely on someone younger."
3.0,Not a true deep black colour. Legs were shorter than expected. It's a good thing that look is in!
3.0,"It kind of large and the end of the sock is low quality, but overall its good."
3.0,Fits as expected but I gave three stars because the navy blue has faded after 3 washes.
3.0,"I ordered a xxl because that's my size. I'm 5'11 and 250 pounds. This thing is pretty big. And its too long.<br /><br />I ended up returning it because it looked too baggy on me, and not in a cute way. They were super awesome about the return and o got my money back fhe day I shipped it to them."
3.0,These are nice and good quality but definitely go up a size. I had to return them.
3.0,"This is not what I expected.  The black of the shirt is a poly blend, the rainbow portion of the shirt is like a silky material.  The bottom hem is banded and the neck seems stretched out.  Rainbow is not quite as vibrant as pictured either.  I am 5’3” 150 lbsand ordered a Large, easily could have ordered a medium except the arms would be too tight!"
3.0,"I wear a large so I ordered a large and I really should have ordered an extra large because this shirt runs small and is more fitted than I like.  I kept it and use it as a pajama top mostly and I do sometimes wear it under a plaid shirt as a layer, but I do not remove the plaid shirt if I do that because I don't like how it squeezes across my breasts.  If you like your shirts to be looser then you should probably order a size up from your normal size.  I have not noticed any real shrinkage after washing."
3.0,Thinner material than I thought
3.0,"Cheap cotton gloves, don't hold up long and get dirty easily. Only really good for if you want to do some typing and it is freezing."
3.0,its fragil but is amazing
3.0,Very dull stone compared to the photo. There’s no sparkle to it and the stone blends in with the black rope too much and just looks bland. From upclose you can barely tell it’s green. But from far away it just looks like a black stone on a janky rope. The stone by itself is not bad. Just too dark for a black rope. I understand that all stones do not look the alike but some should just not be used this way.
3.0,Fits very loosely. Kind of a cheap material. But is comfortable. I wouldn't wear these in public.
3.0,"I bought these for my kids to wear at the pool and to keep them from running barefoot outside while playing. went to the pool twice with no problems; however, first time playing outside and they fell apart at the toe and the soles."
3.0,Very fun but nothing special: the frame snapped after a few wears.
3.0,The item is good but it has no any tags. I just got confused that the item is new or old?
3.0,Only used it about 8 to 10 times and it's falling apart
3.0,Just a bit wide. But kept them.
3.0,"These PJ's were beautifully made and nicely packaged.  BUT, they ran very small.  If you are a petite person give them a try - but ""order up"" in size."
3.0,"I was hoping for a wider brim, but trial and error is part of finding a good hat! I focus on function and form equally, so as cute a hat as this is, the ""keep the sun out of my eyes"" purpose wasn't quite fulfilled."
3.0,Cute shirt but the xxl had to be given to my medium sister in law. She loves it. I'm disappointed.
3.0,The top barely fits over my boobs! It runs pretty small and the proportions are off for an XXL. Hopefully a friend can fit it.
3.0,The material is a little clingy but it fit good.
3.0,We had to return them because they were much bigger than expected. They do seem to be a good quality for the price.
3.0,"I loved the color, but sadly, I had to donate it because the arms and chest were quite tight.  It may just be that I have a big chest and arms though.  I'd size up for sure."
3.0,They stretched out and started falling off after about a month of wearing
3.0,nice top but too small for sizes listed on product page
3.0,Nice jersey but the sizing is way off.  Order at least 3 sizes larger than you usually wear.
3.0,Quality is great but size is way off. Xl is more like a slim medium.
3.0,Cute cosplay outfit for my teen daughter. Smaller than expected.
3.0,Sizing runs smaller than I expected
3.0,I don’t care for the material or how high the neck line is.
3.0,Really cute but zipper broke after first use!  😭
3.0,Didn’t expect the other side of the lanyard to have the Mario M logo<br />Would’ve liked it better if both sides had the coin and star aesthetic
3.0,"I rated this 3 stars because what the description doesn’t indicate is that it’s crochete, but does not have lining so it’s completely see through. The quality of the actual crocheting is really good."
3.0,received wrong size according to pkg.  They might be ok if they fit.
3.0,I'm very tall and I usually wear an xl but this Xl to me is way too small. I would say it's more like a medium.
3.0,"Waist band is really tall and vey tight. Skirt I see too long, love the color. Will take it to get fixed.<br />Fabric is not very breathable but there is a lot of it!"
3.0,"I have found the bracelets from this brand to vary in quality. I have one that I wear almost daily, but I returned this one because it was strung very loosely and the elastic didn't feel as robust as in the other one. However, the stones are always high quality. I still recommend this brand, even though some bracelets are made better than others."
3.0,"This product works well and I enjoy having it to use, though only a time or two each week. The handle is plastic and I am concerned that over time the metal clip may separate, but for the price, it works well.."
3.0,Cute but runs small and fabric is thick and uncomfortable.
3.0,It's good to have dress choices that aren't low cut or too short from bottom. I'm so tired of seeing trampy clothes.<br />This is a good dress that sits just below the knee.
3.0,"Ordered a medium. The material is good quality, just thin, and it’s not super stretchy. Wanted to add it to my wardrobe for a night out. Will be returning and looking for a thicker, more fitted top."
3.0,"Beautiful colour, well constructed, waterproof but not at all easy to pack away for storage. Shoe compartment not suitable for more than ballet slippers or squished flat shoes. Better use is for small folded items. Not able to reach items packed ...very  very deep."
3.0,"It fits cute and looks just like the picture. However, the sequin part is very rough and scratchy. I had to give it away because I couldn't hold my baby while wearing it. The sequin part was way too rough."
3.0,"This dress is very beautiful. I am pretty plus sized ,but I had to get the the dress fitted smaller and the padding was removed ,because im not a busty girl. Overall, I was not disappointed"
3.0,"I couldn’t actually figure out how most of these are meant to be worn, they’re essentially pieces of wire that have been bent to create cute shapes. However, they don’t really stay in place for me at least. The septum rings are the ones i got it for anyway, but they’re actually a bit painful to wear and really seem to pinch no matter where i slide it on whether i put it closer to the front or a bit further back. The designs are cute, but i don’t see many people being able to wear these for long at all - maybe for a photo or two. I just don’t think they look realistic either, which is why I’d originally gotten them, because I was curious whether I’d like the appearance of a septum piercing on myself. I wouldn’t get them again honestly."
3.0,"Pretty stylish, but felt somewhat cheap."
3.0,"I know it is leather. I put a leather protectant on it, but after 6 months it looks REALLY worn. I used  My last hobo wallet for 3 years and it looks better than this one."
3.0,"I was looking for a pair of footless tights to wear under my skirts and decided to try these.  The quality is very good.  They don't snag easily and could hold up to a number of washings.  The Small-Medium, however, was a bit more on the small side for my comfort.  They were very snug, and reminded me of compression socks.  I'm 5'4"" , 157 lbs, so I suppose I was on the border of wearing a large.  I think it only comes in S-M, and L-XL, and I wonder if the L-XL would be too long.  Haven't decided if I want to give it a try."
3.0,I love these earrings and the statement that they give. I always get compliments whenever I wear them. My only issue is that they have nickel on the bases of them and I'm allergic to nickel. It gives me a really bad reaction.
3.0,"I bought two of these bracelets, one for myself and one for a gift. Both broke in the same spot shortly after being put on. So disappointed, because they are beautiful. I felt bad that the receiver of my gift had the same problem."
3.0,The design spreads when you wear it. Other than that awesome.
3.0,See through ugh. Ive been buying this exact style and brand for years (I seriously have like 18 pairs. Not exaggerating) And any black pairs Ive gotten in the last year are see through. I cant even wear them out of the house :(
3.0,Cute and fits as expected. Dogs nose was already off but no big deal. I glued it with super glue. The reason i am givin 3 star is because they r hard on my sons feet and he got blister. I had ordered the crocs from other company and they r soft and nice. My son wont wear this so i wont be orderering anymore. They r cute looking though.
3.0,"UPDATE:  I've been using this bag for about six weeks and I have lowered my rating by two stars because the lining is very poor quality.  It's very thin material, so the center divider doesn't hold up and function as much of a divider.  Also, there is already a big tear in the bottom of the divider, so things I put in it now spill out into the main compartment.  Finally, the zipper on the interior pocket is broken.  So sad the interior is so flimsy!  Everything else about this bag is durable and functions well.<br /><br />Original Review:  The search is finally over!  I have gone through many large purses trying to have enouch room for a hardcover book, yoga clothes, and occassionally a pair of flats in addition to typical purse stuff.  I always end up feeling like I'm carrying a suitcase and end up back with a purse AND a tote bag on my should.  THIS purse not only fits it all, but isn't a huge suitcase.  The trick is the option to gather the top with the interior straps that snap together, pulling it in at the top, or not using them and having more space when needed.  That is a great feature, and then on top of that I love a purse with so many strap length options, from hands to shoulder to cross-body.  Three small exterior pockets for things you don't want to dig into your purse for to top it all off.  Oh, wait...there's more: the material is sturdy but soft enough to not feel like plastic or vynl.  Love it."
3.0,"I like them and the 3 clasp, but I wear a 36d without fail at every other store and the 36d here is a little too small. I think the band is ok but I have the double boob, the cups are overflowing."
3.0,"Yeah, can't wear this unless I lose some weight... be sure to order a size larger. I guess China thinks we're all fat over here.<br /><br />Secondly, this shirt is SHEER. You WILL need an undershirt, unless you a ho."
3.0,"This dress is NOT lined. It looks and fits very nicely , but completely see through. The material by the waist is not forgiving at all, look at the chart for sizing and if you’re in between sizes order up. You can see every line seam and crinkle of your underwear ... Devastated it’s so transparent, will be returning"
3.0,I liked the quality of the chain. They sent me the wrong intial had to sent it back. I would've have kept it if it was the right intial.
3.0,Boyfriend liked it...not well made..had to glue metal clasp back onto leather again. Nice for money spent.
3.0,"it didn't come destroyed or anything, but the way it was packaged made the string curl all around weirdly so i had to put it under something heavy for a while to straighten it out. aside from that, i've been meaning to get this type of necklace b/c the pearl is my birthstone & wasn't too disappointed overall ! :)"
3.0,"They  look just like the picture and ship quickly but, they run a bit big"
3.0,"The string that wraps around is what helps tighten up the closing for the chest in the front center, well it doesn’t do a good job doing so!<br />The thickness of the top for the shoulders is thicker  wider than shown in the pictures.<br />The print is pretty cute though!<br />Wish it came with little hooks to securely tighten the front chest area!"
3.0,Purchased this in orange. While the fabric is nice and the style is what I was looking for it was way too small. It fit about two sizes too small.
3.0,fine and acceptable for price
3.0,"Work well, and comfortable. But constantly fall off the glasses when you take the glasses off. Very disappointing."
3.0,I liked the comfort of the shoe but the material is a little too thin on top. I can see my toenail poking through the fabric of the shoe.  I am returning them.
3.0,Muy linda la camisa pero es más pequeña que la talla standar
3.0,"These shorts are small, meaning not very long.  They are a little bit tight on as well, where a medium normally fits perfectly.  They are a cute color and look cute on.  Not the most comfortable, since they run a tad small."
3.0,"Pants are made kind of weird, and much baggier around the crotch area than they should be. They run large."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress. I ordered a large.  I am 5'7"", 168# an a 34DD. 40""-34""-42"". Width wise the dress fit. However it came about 2"" below my crotch. -Too short for my comfort. The V neck was also too low cut. I am larger chested and used to showing a bit of cleavage as a result. But even so there is no way I could wear this even out to a bar with out wearing a tank underneith. Not for bustier or longer legged women."
3.0,This is beautiful and quality appears to be great. Only problem is that it is very difficult to get on and off. Best to keep as a primary band and not to swapped in and out. It took a lot of work not to damage my watch and band. It's also not good for small wrist. Way too big. Sadly I will be returning it.
3.0,I like the charm itself and dislikes how it turns some other colors😟
3.0,"Nice style, low quality."
3.0,These slimming boy shorts are smaller than advertised.  They do not cover much more than a pair of boy shorts so they don’t slim much of your waist.  They don’t stretch up to cover a “muffin top.”
3.0,This shirt did not fit my son. Too large.
3.0,"Strap seems ok, definitely sharp on the edges but hopefully it will break in well. Surprised to find that although I ordered 22mm size, the spring bars are most definitely for a 20mm watch. They don't even come close to wanting to stay on the watch, plus the spring bar tool provided is useless. Yes it's inexpensive for two straps but I would've ordered spring bars if I had known the ones provided weren't going to fit."
3.0,"The stones are beautiful and it came right on time but the post is super short, it doesn’t even dangle off the ear, I think it’s meant for a child. Edit: They fit fine on the person I bought them for, they were a little short but she liked them! My ear lobe is thicker than hers so that explains the difference!"
3.0,The strap placement on the back is weird. I cut them off the back and tie them like a halter. Its a little better but still doesn't fit like expected. I'll be taking in a bit in the back and then it should hopefully lay nicely. Currently it feels like a blanket with straps.<br /><br />I am very curvy and I ordered a large. Sizing down is definitely the way to go. Usually I wear an xl-xxl
3.0,Too small and can’t return.
3.0,"Really wanted to like this shirt but was very underwhelmed. Ordered a medium based on size chart (size 4- medium) and it is huge. Very lose around chest and waste, which isn’t right despite style. Material is not soft and had a crunchy feel. I gave this shirt away immediately."
3.0,Very short. Flimsy material.
3.0,Doesn't have the &#34;weight&#34; of the Stainless Steel (silver metal finish) chain that I bought with this one . Hopefully it will be as durable .....
3.0,Pros: The material is soft and a great color.<br />Cons: zipper hasn't got a good lock<br />  No cup definition so you get uniboob<br />Not recommended for full busted women.
3.0,It was much smaller than I expected and a looks cheap.  The straps were weak and broke within minutes.
3.0,Definitely better and more comfortable then plastic one but didn't like the whole extra sock and was lil thick as someone that has tried em all idk if it's jus ppl have different feet but I always go back to the Force Fields they comfortable I don't have to modify or wear nothing to hold in place and you can find 4 pair packs of same design here on Amazon for damn near same price as a pair of Force Fields. I get those and covers 4 sneaks. so I don't have to take in and out of sneaks I jus place another order everytime I buy another few sneaks and now I don't loose em like I use too. Figure $13-$15 whatever it is per 4 sneakers is good deal in my book to keep fresh.. jus fyi..
3.0,the look of it is good but my wrist does not breath well so I kind of got a rash when wearing it too long.  For looks alone folks should like it 4 to 5 stars though.
3.0,"I like the convenience of the magnetic mesh band. This is the second one that I have purchased.<br />I was not pleased with the color and disappointed that this one did not come with the matching Watch bumper ... I had to order this separately and the color did not match, (this second one is more pink than rose gold)."
3.0,Seemed like a very nice suit. The material was nice. Just wished it would have fit. Large was too small.
3.0,Corre muy pequeño. Ordene Size large y corre como una mediana o incluso una small porque la cintura es muy pequeña y no hay strech
3.0,"I usually wear a 6 petite and these are more like 7/8 leggings on me. I ordered a medium and could’ve eaSily done a large. Also, the zipper gets stuck when it’s stretched open on you so you haven’t l essentially pull them down to zip it closed. While cute, I can’t recommend them."
3.0,"i ordered black and white but it came with a grey strap instead, and installation is tricky"
3.0,"Not sure how to rate, I really liked the style of the blouse.<br />The blouse is beautiful, can be dressy or dress down depending on the occasion).  I'm normally a Med/Large depending on cut, I ordered an Extra Large and it was too small across the bust."
3.0,"These overalls have a weird fit, much wider than expected but it's almost too short for me and I'm only 5'2&#34;. The button holes on the straps were smaller than the buttons, so you have to force it through."
3.0,"They’re what I expected, but one of the opals isn’t seated snuggly and wiggles a bit, hopefully it doesn’t fall out anytime soon. Nice looking for an inexpensive earring."
3.0,"They're really comfortable, but after a couple washes the color is starting to look strange. The white one in particular has blobs of blue and other colors, just on the outside - so I wear it inside out now.<br />Also, the straps twist a lot and aren't very good quality. You get what you pay for!"
3.0,"The durability of the material is great & made very well , including the rope braid handle. The zippers, not so much. Haven't broken , but difficult to maneuver.  They are plastic & hard to zip so using them with caution . Which isn't good for a bag you use every day @ school . For the price should work better & have metal zippers , in my opinion ."
3.0,I really didn’t care for it. It pictured a loose fitting neck and I would not consider loose fitting. Also it was too short. Not usual length for a sweater.
3.0,Didn't realized was so small.
3.0,FOUND OUT YOU NEED TO TAKE YOUR SOCKS OFF FOR THESE TO FIT GOOD!!!
3.0,They were clear indoors but did not darken in sunshine
3.0,I was borderline size XL so I figured getting the XXL was my best bet. I was wrong. Not to mention ordering off the actual website I would have gotten it $10.00 cheaper. The plus size is thats its very warm. However the footies are enormous. I need this for a charity event or I would consider sending it back. If you are borderline like me still go with the smaller size.
3.0,"Small breast area for the size. Quality was ok. Did not fit, not true to American sizing."
3.0,The general quality
3.0,Great for my daughter In middle school  but looks to cheap for an adult.
3.0,"Compared to my homemade masks, these seemed very lightweight and not nearly as sturdy or protective. It appears to only be 2 layers of relatively loose fabric. The nose wire is not quite long enough and seems pretty wimpy. The adjustable straps are nice, and it feels comfy on the face, but I'm not sure if it has enough layers for real, COVID-19 protection."
3.0,"I love the colors, the versatility and the price. My only complaint is that when I tried adjusting it, the end came out of the fastener and I couldn't figure out how to put it back together."
3.0,"I'm giving this 3 stars, because, even though it is EXACTLY like the picture and so, SO soft, it ripped just underneath the collar the very first time my stepdaughter wore it. :(<br />It ripped in such a way that I'm not sure it can be salvaged, since it's right underneath the collar in a long tear.<br />If it hadn't ripped, and on the first day without provocation -- she just wore it to her office job -- then I would give it more stars because it's exactly what I'd ordered and it fit perfectly."
3.0,la verdad no me gustaron
3.0,The waist pictured at the Natural waist but in reality it falls below the bust and isn’t flattering. Fabric seems cheap also.
3.0,"I know for a fact one review on this dress is a fake review. The other one looks like it may be this actual dress but still is a false review. I am about to give you the real deal.<br /><br />This dress is a knock off version of Azazie brand dress ""Jael"". They even used the pictures from the Azazie website as well as stole the pictures of one girls review. With that being said, its not a horrible knock off. I have bought the real Azazie dress as well as this one and the only difference is material. The Azazie dress is more comfortable/soft and stretchy. This dresses fabric has no stretch but I feel like that is made up for with the corset backing. It gives you a little more wiggle room with the sizing. This dresses material is very itchy and stiff. It does not steam out well. I feel like the stiff upper half is good for you if you need a little more support but might be annoying to someone who doesn't. All in all I do not hate the dress and it seems to be made well but it is 100% not the Azazie dress shown. I will update with pictures later."
3.0,"This wallet is really cute and it has a lot of space in it and great for organizing my dozens of cards I have. The color was very true to the picture. My only complaint it on the front it say &#34;forever friends. Your Choice.&#34; If I had just zoomed into the picture I would have seen it so it's pretty much my fault, but the phrase just seems kind of weird to be on a wallet."
3.0,not quite what i thought but good
3.0,"These shoes are super cute and very versatile. But the strap over the toe is not very comfortable, hard to wear for long periods of time."
3.0,The picture is a bit deceiving because it looks like a sweater. This top is t-shirt thin throughout. Cute but basic.
3.0,"It is very pretty, very delicate, but don't think it's strong enough to hold more than one memorial ashes charm.  The top loop isn't very strong and I am afraid it will break and I don't want to lose y my loved ones ashes."
3.0,The pattern didn’t match up to the seems you can’t tell in even wearing hello kitty otherwise comfy and fit perfectly
3.0,I bought this for a 14 year old girl because she has a small wrist.  It's cute but nothing to write home about.  I am perfectly happy with the service and the speedy shipping though.
3.0,"Loved rings but the black one is either a size 6 or 7, not the size 5 I ordered. Kinda bummed about that. 😔"
3.0,The curtain is fine except the colors are overpowering. I have a different one on the way.
3.0,"I am a Daisy person so I had to have those and the ring and they are very pretty for the money, but they broke in two after a couple wears. It seems the inside material is brittle or just weak."
3.0,Shirt received is darker green and question mark is smaller than picture advertised
3.0,"You can breathe in them fine, but the nose piece is really low on the nose"
3.0,Was ok nothing special not as thick as the band it comes with
3.0,"Cute shirt,  thin material !! Wear a cami !"
3.0,It breaks pretty easily
3.0,"Wearable, but sort of cheap feel."
3.0,"First off, it took almost 2 weeks to finally arrive.<br />Second, the beads are much larger than they appear in the photo.<br />Third, the elastic cord that holds it all together does not appear to be very strong. If I planned to wear it, I don't think it would last very long."
3.0,Very nice but pocket square is small.
3.0,The material is really rough and it's not super stretchy so pick a size up if you are willing to buy
3.0,tore very easily when putting on.
3.0,"too light, seems not good material, not a good fit. Not too bad though, but definitely not good quality and too expensive."
3.0,"Skirt was nicely made and very soft, but the waist was way to small for a large and it had very little stretch in the waist. Was much longer than I was expecting too. I was looking for a knee length shirt and it was mid to 3/4 down my shin. The skirt (minus the waist area) fit very nicely."
3.0,Nice ring.  I ordered 3 and found that the edges are rough and need filing on all of them.
3.0,To match a white shirt9
3.0,"i like this scarf  its waht i thought it would be, color, size and the hand of the silk...im happy"
3.0,"These were initially described differently so I didn't expect them to be so very small. At best they are for use as cuffs because there isn't enough length in the loops to go in the earlobe. I selected them because they looked like a nice wardrobe of hoop earrings for the earlobes so I was a little disappointed that I couldn't use them.<br />However, they are very sturdy and very pretty! Lightweight so they won't drag your ears down and hurt.  The current Amazon description now reflects their true description. It has been changed a few times.<br /><br />I received a promotional price in exchange for my honest review."
3.0,i love the skirt but it is way way smaller than the size i ordered.
3.0,Love the necklace but the chain broke within 2 weeks
3.0,I ordered xs but it was too big. I end up returning it. Kind long for me since I'm only 5'0. The quality was nice.
3.0,Very cute outfit . Tighter fit than I would like .<br />Def size up .
3.0,"I found it difficult to use.  The material is shiny, so your work light reflects and makes the link pin hard to see.  Also, holding the link at a proper height  can be a challenge.  Never the less, I was able to remove the 3 links needed."
3.0,It’s somewhat small but it’s cute!
3.0,"Really wanted to give this 5 stars because the material is nice and thick, and my 7 year old is infatuated with how they look...but they arrived with one of the straps broken. Talk about a bummer."
3.0,I actually think this legging is better than the highstreets brand. It fits well and comfortable. This legging would be perfect if they made it with pocket.
3.0,Product is good for what it is. But the actual product is clearly labelled as women's but the listing is says men's and women's. Would have been nice for the listing to include the product dimensions so I could have determined for myself
3.0,"Too small, one size up is still too small."
3.0,Tight - order a size up!
3.0,Nice looking watch. I just expected it to look and feel better in quality.
3.0,order 1 size smaller... I'm 5&#34;8 195 pounds small up top I wear size 14/16...I order a XL but a Large would have work just fine..
3.0,Short and thick
3.0,"Smaller than I expected, but cute."
3.0,"Super Cute. a little low in the chest, but overall nice fit.<br /><br />The dress is a lot shorter than you would have imagined. I bought this for a tap dance recital, and will have to wear leggings underneath."
3.0,"the keychain came broken... the metal ring that holds the car to the big circle keychain came opened and completely dislocated from the big circle. Unusable, would not recommend."
3.0,Beautiful but way to small
3.0,"The dress is cute, I bought one for each of my daughters, however, I have already had to glue two of the little flowers back on. I need the dresses for Easter pictures (in two days) or I would search elsewhere for dresses. Again they are cute but I don't recommend these ones, honestly."
3.0,Too small and it had a hole in the dress
3.0,"Super cute, just runs way too small"
3.0,"The only problem I had, besides my first time buying these style of shirts, was that one of the shirts was disgustingly worn and sweated in with a dank smell of garlic nasty body odor which was totally gross.  It took me a few moments while I was wearing this particular shirt to realize this.  I don't mind it anymore, but I'm just saying that was really unpleasant."
3.0,Nice soft fabric. Print seems to be like heat pressed. Not sure how many washes the print will make it through. I ordered a small. Wish it came in x-small for a more form fitting fit. Good buy for a simple shirt dress.
3.0,"Nice Sunglasses, but I was disappointed that the lenses aren't really as big as depicted.  If you have a large face or head, you won't get Jackie Onassis look with these"
3.0,works fine just hasn't softened up much which after 3-4 weeks I figured it would.  Seems strong and durable.
3.0,These are way smaller than what I expected.<br />But very beautiful. A teenager would love them.
3.0,"Sweet and very unique key chain attachment for sure,all who saw it got a kick out of it,ak emblem is strong and won't bend wich is very good but the chain part could be a lot better,one loop opened on me but thankfully I found the emblem and put it together!"
3.0,"These earrings are very small. Would probably fit a small child. Also, the color was a very light blue"
3.0,"This purchase was a total letdown.  I loved the look of the band, and appreciated that it came with 4 removable links on each side to enable resizing to pretty much any sized wrist.  However, the pin removal tool is poorly manufactured plastic that makes it more difficult than necessary to use.  Given the price for the band and frame set I find the quality of that took acceptable, although frustrating to use.  My real complaint is in the difference in the color and sheen of the frame.  The frame itself does not even come close to the appearance of the band, and has a matte finish and a more gray than chromed look.  It really cheapens the overall look and I'm considering just putting the links back in and sending the whole thing back."
3.0,Was missing 3 rings and 2 rings were incomplete so they are unusable.
3.0,There’s not as much stretch as they made it seem
3.0,Screen/face is difficult to see and its hard to set all the options. Can't get the alarm to turn off.
3.0,Cheaper made than expected from Bebe for a product with a suggested retail price of $100. Not what was expected.
3.0,"As I title states, they aren't the most or least comfortable slippers. Just kind of average with an above average price tag."
3.0,I wasn’t expecting like name brand quality but this literally feels like it was made from a dish cloth and sewn in the dark by a child.
3.0,Not bad for a basic watch! Light weight and looks nice.<br />Con: Definitely not a touch screen
3.0,Not bad for the price...going to give it away to one of the grandkids... They'll like it. more their style
3.0,Not very well fitted. Comfortable material and an okay dress.
3.0,Really good but it came with the lights didn’t work  That’s why three stars
3.0,The bottoms were too big and the top was too small.
3.0,"Very uncomfortable shoe, but I did like the style."
3.0,They where perfect.
3.0,": I haven’t had a polarized pair of sunglasses before and now I realize what I was missing out on. They really cut down on the road glare when I am driving. I do not like that it makes looking at my phone a bit difficult. I have to take the glasses off to use it.<br /><br />These are super cute glasses and are very comfortable to wear. They do not have a separate nose piece which I am happy for. They are very well made and feel like they will last a long time.<br /><br />I don’t like the glass case they came with, it is a zippered case which isn’t easily accessible when I am trying to drive. It takes two hands to get them in and out. After trying once, I threw the case away and am using a pouch that another pair of glasses came in.<br /><br />I would not have paid $100+ for these."
3.0,"Small. Thin material. Fair lace. Upon arrival it has 2 sizes stuck to it, large and xlarge. Requested return and got prompt courteous service"
3.0,the top is cute on the model. when i orderd it I bought it in a small. But the small is too big on me. The owners was nice that i can sent it back and exchange it to another smaller size.
3.0,"I order this several months ago for the main reason RFID blocking features.  The wallet is attractive and  like that it has all the slots for card and money and plenty of room for business cards etc.  I would not repurchase this wallet, within about 6 weeks the seams were coming apart around the credit card  I really wanted to love this wallet"
3.0,"These are cute from a distance.  But when you see them up close, you see the white ball in between every stone.  I wish the ball was better covered so that the white didn't show through."
3.0,"I'm 5'8&quot; and bought a size large, hoping it would be long enough. It's a comfortable dress and fits perfectly everywhere, except it is too short. This is really disappointing since it would be the perfect dress if only it was 1-2 inches longer!"
3.0,I was not impressed with this bag and it was kind of a disappointment to how small it is when I gave it as a gift. It can hold mail that might be about it you definitely can’t take it food shopping
3.0,I thought it was thin for the price. One button fell off after two weeks. No well made at all.
3.0,very comfortable but somewhat small
3.0,"Pros:<br />1. The fit was great.<br />2. Fabric was soft<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. The fabric was shiny, which I didn't like<br />2. I have to get used to the color, because the color is a little off.<br /><br />I plan on keeping this, it will just take some time to get used to."
3.0,They where all cut different
3.0,"Items and it’s packing were fine....late but fine. I received notification via email for the delay.  However, the case does not perfectly fit my phone. The corner near the camera is a bit loose and slides very easily. Scaring me of any drop that may occur. Highly recommend a screen protector be added to the “deal”. Also, it’s a bit thinner then I thought. Again scaring me if any drop that may occur"
3.0,"I bought the white in XL and apricot in L and wear a large typically. after reading reviews that they fit as intended I thought I'd be ok with large but got an XL too, bc I wanted it super baggy, hanging off of me. They both fit the exact same, don't hang off the shoulder at all and I only gave it 3 stars bc of it. Otherwise it's a beautiful, almost crop top sweater that's baggy in the arms and underarm area only. I was so looking forward to these for Thanksgiving. Now I don't have anything to wear"
3.0,Top runs very very small
3.0,My Granddaughter loved the dress but we have to return it because it is way too wide/ short and boxy looking.  I bought size 10/12 and it hits her 2 inches above her knees way too short!
3.0,This bootie is super cute and I get a lot of compliments wearing them to work or out.<br />They're not the most comfortable after 12-16hrs but I suppose that's expected for what they are.<br />I'm also a bit disappointed at how poorly attached the grommets are for the straps. The bottom outer grommet on both boots pulled out of its hole within 5 wears....the 1st on the 1st wear.<br />I wish they were a little better made but I also realize I got what I paid for.
3.0,Larges normally fit me but this is really tight around the thighs if your around my weight definitely get XL
3.0,"The elastic at the waist is tight making the fit good but difficult to get over my hips. Better to put on over my head which is unusual for a skirt. An opening, a button would help. Once on the fit is comfortable and flattering, not too full."
3.0,Unfortunately this was too tight for me and I had to return it. The price seemed reasonable for the quality but the size chart was not accurate.
3.0,"This suit is very flattering and fits as expected. The ruched look is quite slimming. My teenage daughter, however, found the inner seams to be irritating. The metal accents on the suit also were a little ""pokey"" when she moved certain ways. It fits well and looks good but is not terribly comfortable."
3.0,Very long..very thin..<br />Otherwise comfy and true to description.
3.0,"Runs small but my best friend loved it, it did fade substantially after a few washes."
3.0,"It just didn't look nearly as nice on me as the picture. I don't know. It just looked weird and not flattering. I couldn't see wearing it. The fabric was thin, but pretty soft. It was the same general look but just didn't end up translating to a nice look. The top part just ended up looking funny. Maybe it will depend on what your body type is."
3.0,"I love the color of these tights, and they are super comfortable; however, I recently noticed that the hem is coming out, so I guess they're probably not the greatest quality, but they're a bargain so there's that."
3.0,"The hair band was too loose and big , if I bent over it would fall off my head so I returned it"
3.0,Love the shoe but it is a little snug in the toe area
3.0,"While for the most part the colors are bright and vibrant, disappointed Goku's pants are VERY faded, almost invisible! But I like the material overall a good hoodie."
3.0,Too small. Had to cut the back to make it fit.
3.0,"Runs small, very tight. I got a 3t for my son and it fit like 24 months."
3.0,"Chain is to short, hadn't worn it"
3.0,Does the job but it broke.
3.0,"Not a fan of the super-bunched up waistband on the pants, but they are surprisingly soft and comfortable otherwise. By their looks, I expected them to be a bit rough and stiff, but they're relatively soft and slinky, the shirt even more so. The shirt, however, doesn't fit as loosely as I'd like or expect given the size it's labeled as."
3.0,Weren't easy to see for the group. Letters should've been white for better contrast.
3.0,"Cool headpiece, but beads come off where only glued"
3.0,"I got these shoes to walk around for myself.  I usually wear an adult size 8, 8 1/2.  I believe I ordered a size 6 and they were still a bit roomy in the toes.  This shoes offer the most MINIMAL amount of protection for your feet and the ground."
3.0,I bought to wear around the house after work.  It seems to run large and I did return this item.  I found that the quality was not as I expected.
3.0,"I returned it because online and other girls, it looked cute but on me it made me frumpy.<br />It was tight around the chest area, im 36D, so beware.<br />The flowers weren't as vivid but the green was nice.<br />The dress hit a little above my ankles, im 5'7"
3.0,"These leggings feel great and are comfortable.  They are thicker material than the cheap leggings you can get. First time i wore them though, i got a hole in them in two places."
3.0,It was too short for my needs
3.0,I love the designed of these hooks but I can not use them everywhere. These are only good for thin tables/desk; if the table/desk is thick you won't be able to hook your purse/bag. :/
3.0,"They're not compression, but they fit nice."
3.0,Pants of course! They are cute and I love the color. Thought they would have more stretch and length. They’re a bit tough on fabric.
3.0,"I am a bit confused about the actual description of what this is. It's called &quot;Women's Leather Clutch Handbag Light Weight Wallet Long Card Holder Case&quot; which is very confusing. What I think it is is a &quot;Light Weight Long Card Holder Case.&quot; It is not a handbag or a clutch either. It seems to be able to carry a LOT of credit cards or perhaps business cards, or a combination of both. There is a place for your ID which I assume would be your Drivers License and registration. The zippered outside pocket would probably carry a bit of money but a very small amount. This is supposed to be leather, but there is no tag or embossed symbol or even words to say what kind of leather it is. The zipper on the<br />outside feel like plastic and there is a bump that has caused the zipper to snag a couple of times that I zipped it open and closed. The lining on the inside feels like vinyl. The lining in the outside zippered compartment is nylon or some kind of material.<br /><br />That said....I DO like this to carry credit cards and business cards and a few dollars if I am just running out or it could be an easy switch by just dropping this into my purse. This wallet is fairly well made. The stitching is nice and the closure snap seems to work with only the amount of credit cards that I have, which is not a lot. I do wonder if a simple snap would close the wallet if all the spaces were full of credit cards and your ID, with money in the outside pocket. If you feel the price is good for you without any proof of leather, then please read the rest of my review.<br /><br />I am giving this product three stars rather than two, because it is nice looking and it holds a lot of cards which very few wallets or even credit card holders have. I know because I don't think I ever found a credit card case that came even close. The lack of any kind of leather ID marks or tags has me concerned if it would cost the amount if it were faux leather. I know because my late husband and I spent a lot of time in Atlantic City with him at the slots in the afternoon and me shopping along the Boardwalk.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my fair and honest review, which I feel is evident here. Like you, I am an avid shopper on Amazon and I rely on honest reviews when I am purchasing items for myself and my family."
3.0,This was to small for my 3 year old to wear.
3.0,XS fits like a size 0. Cute style and matches the photos. Had to return because the dress is a bit see-through.
3.0,Luckily I have supplies to repair it
3.0,Broke after 2 wears. The stone is huge & gorgeous  so that’s why I gave it 3 stars instead of 1
3.0,"These are absolutely adorable in person but they run way smaller than the Mary Jane style in the same brand. They are incredibly hard to get on. They look real cute once on but not worth the pain of getting them on my daughter’s foot. They might work for baby’s with real skinny feet. Sadly, I will be returning them."
3.0,Kinda flimsy fabric. Fit is smaller than expected - good thing I got large. Belt that came with them wont fit through the belt loops with the buckle on.
3.0,"I normally wear a medium/large top. However, I bought this in a XXLarge because I learned the hard way on amazon. This jacket had a snug fit even at this size. I really like the cut, just sad that the jacket makes me feel like a fatty."
3.0,This jacket is missing side pockets to keep your hands warm. The only pockets are the front ones.
3.0,"I got the &#34;no cartoon&#34; print, and I may have missed a sentence somewhere about how the top part is actually flesh-colored, not sheer so as to let most of your skin tone show through. So a warning to any other girls out there who have tanner skins than &#34;ivory&#34; -- your thighs will look hilarious.<br /><br />On the bright side, the material is thick so definitely won't tear any time soon."
3.0,"I like the horizontal fly.  It gives some space for expansion in the front area.<br /><br />The front pouch is *way* too small for me, however, as the fly gaps open so much that there's a bit of a peek-a-book effect where you can see part of my shaft.  Would only recommend these for men of less than average endowment.<br /><br />The leg holes have no firm elastic, either, meaning that after a few hours of wear, the leg holes lose their shape entirely & the seat of the underwear starts creeping up my backside, while the loose legs bunch up (visibly, with dress slacks or thinner pants)."
3.0,Product fits very big
3.0,Fits much tighter than expected. Not flowy as pictured.
3.0,Not very comfortable to wear.
3.0,The dress is very structured. Like someone guessed what a woman is shaped like and just went with it.<br /><br />There's pockets. I love pockets.<br /><br />I wear mine with a wide belt and it looks good.
3.0,Good night gown but does start falling apart from constantly wear
3.0,This is really just one very long leather strand with pearls placed along it and on each end.  You wrap it around your arm and tie it as you please.
3.0,Good for the price but lenses scratch very easily
3.0,Not impressed sent them back
3.0,"the fabric is cotton, it's very simple white shirt so I am thinking on just adding a bow or probably flower on the chest so it will add something to it. But I am not surprised with the quality since it's very cheap."
3.0,One of the earing baggies was empty. I received 5/6 pairs.
3.0,"I like that it's not too thin and it's not see through. The print looked really faded, not at all vibrant like in the picture. I'm 5'0"", and the shoulders start half way down my arm.<br /><br />Overall this was an okay purchase. And probably better for someone of average height or taller."
3.0,Love these rings. I ordered 5mm and they are too small for my nose. I plan on ordering bigger ones.
3.0,The fit was too small.
3.0,"This dress isn't bad, its just not as full, the fabric is cheaper, thinner and more casual than I thought.  I wanted to use this as summer party dress but it is really more like a throw it on over yoga pants and look cute running errands dress."
3.0,Fits short
3.0,nice material but made me look pregnant
3.0,"Very, very large"
3.0,I'm 5'8 and usually wear a size large so via the suggestions I ordered a 3XL so it would fit me like it did the girl on the photo. For a 3XL I would have expected it to be a lot bigger. It actually looks good on and I'll definitely be wearing it but the reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because 1) it fits more like a XL instead of a 3XL.  2) the buttons end at around my groin area so if I do wear it I'd have to wear leggings or shorts with it! I'd considered putting a few stitches in to fix my problem but then it takes away from the look of it. I think if I was shorter it would look a lot better though.
3.0,"Very cheaply made, looks like something from the dollar store"
3.0,"cute, but i shoud have orderd 2 sizes up"
3.0,"I bought this top because I thought the colors were perfect for summer, but when I got it they didn't seem as bright as the photo. Also, the elastic on the shoulders was a little too tight so any movement caused it to slide up my shoulders, which isn't a problem I have with other shirts that are this style. I ended up returning it since it required constant adjusting."
3.0,"The fit is fine, the fabric of the shirt is really soft and comfortable.<br />I was just very disappointed with the color. I bought the orange one, thinking it would be that nice fall type of orange, instead it was a coral orange. Very different from what was pictured."
3.0,Chain catches on things
3.0,Very cute just a little small
3.0,Cute bag!  Only lasted 3 months.  All the nylon is ripping apart at the seams.  I guess for price what can you expect.  Don’t waste your money.
3.0,"The pattern is cute, but it's really big and if you are busty at all, it fits like trash bag. I'm a size 14 dress and I ordered a M."
3.0,"Nice bracelet...was expecting a better overall weight to the piece.  It feels borderline &#34;cheap&#34; due to the weight ( I read other comments about the &#34;good&#34; weight, and went with those reviews).  I would not purchase again."
3.0,Did the job well. Held my passport while go through the airport and various tourist locations. Product does shed quite a bit though. I had to pack it in it’s own separate bag so fuzzies wouldn’t get on my things
3.0,"The first time we put it on our daughter, the button holes started fraying. The fabric is all pretty thin and papery. The ruffles and sleeves aren't hemmed just stitched over so they started fraying pretty quickly too."
3.0,"The sheepskin is nice and soft and the leather seems nice. What I don't like are the soles. They are not flexible at all. They are so stiff they don't flex which causes your heel to slide up as you walk. They also pinched my toe a bit, but I think that would have been corrected with time as the leather stretched. However, if the leather stretches my heel will slide out even more so I am not keeping them to see what happens."
3.0,"These earring are what I expected for the price point. They are a little heavier than I prefer. And the turquoise is obviously plastic, but very realistic looking. The set I received was glued off center - so that bugs me a little. Overall, a cute set. Something similar to what I would pick up at Walmart or Target."
3.0,I was excited to receive this. The print is cute. It appears more like a sweater in the photo. Definitely looks like a T shirt. The arms are roomy and a bit too long. I am 5-7 and I bought an extra large. I probably should have purchased a lg.
3.0,"These earrings are beautiful but there are not the size shown on the model's ears nor are they truly 60mm. I own several pair of 60mm, amazon basics brand, and these are smaller than theirs."
3.0,"These gloves fit great and are good for driving. They are not especially warm and can't be used to clear snow as they get wet quickly. But overall, good lightweight glove for driving and walking/running."
3.0,comfortable shirts but they were a little too large
3.0,I really love this little crossbody wallet. I wish it was a little bigger. As it is can't really fit any cash inside of it and the magnet is not very strong so it does pop open. I carry it around inside of my purse and use it as a wallet because I don't want it to pop open and everything fall out.
3.0,Wand sucks! Child not happy.
3.0,"I really like this but the zippers seem to be of poor quality ( update"" zipper broke 7 months after I bought it. I only used it once in a while ) and the inside liner is to loose. Should have been secured better. Liner gets caught in zipper. Other then those to things I really like it. But those two thing are important. One the zipper brakes it will be trash and the liner is very annoying not a enjoyable purchase. A purse should make life easier not more stressful."
3.0,"I liked the cap, but it came with a defect.  Although, I cannot complain, the seller was on top of it to help me with my return."
3.0,"My vault keep falling out from the right back pocket, very scary during the entire international trip. My next trip I am not wearing this pants so I have to go and buy another one."
3.0,This hat fit was smaller than my other hats the same size.
3.0,"My wife is an ecumenical minister and wanted something non-Christian.  She nevertheless wanted symbolism that suggests what she referred to as the vertically and horizontal sacred, at least for those of us raised in a Western tradition.  This piece looks a bit heavier than others I've purchased -- more like an iron cross.  (My review's title says that the piece suggests weight, but I believe the piece is made of pewter and it is actually quite light.)  I know she'll find things to wear it with, however."
3.0,Beautiful sweater vest. Fits nicely. Just was wet and dirty when package received.
3.0,"just be aware this shirt is very thin.  wore it for a golf outing, got caught in the rain, and it was pretty much completely see thru"
3.0,The blouse has a very wide and open neckline. It really needs something worn underneath it. I have not been able to wear it yet.
3.0,Bought this for my 4 year old and it came in quickly but it does have a black stain on the front of it and it was missing the button on the back. I needed the shirt for pictures the next day so I sewed my own button on and hoped you couldn't see the black pen like stain on the front. It's really cute but for the price I would have hoped there would have been a button and hate that it had that darn stain
3.0,Little on small side for a medium to large person
3.0,"This ring is very cute, but the tip on the &#34;tail&#34;end of the snake was sharp and dug into my toe, so I had to send back."
3.0,"Nice style dress. Whoops, its a mini dress thats not designed for a girl with a lot of BASE (ass). Needed more elastisity to cover up.<br />Thumps up for the very petit."
3.0,The color looks lighter in the picture otherwise it’s ok also the model looks as if she were wearing a white top like it so I don’t know if there’s a color choice available cause it’s not posted
3.0,"I was searching Alexing and Ani braclets for a gift..,.This should NOT come up, as it is CLEARLY NOT the same..,cute, and the saying has a special meaning, that's why I bought it, but it's not the same and I have a feeling I will be encountering some issues with the material....it almost looks plastic!!"
3.0,"I bought these to replace a cheaply made pair that is sold all over the internet. These seemed like quality glasses that would hold up a lot better than the cheapo ones.  They are very well made and certainly look like quality. Unfortunately, the range of adjustability is such that I can't get them to focus at the range of my computer laptop screen - the reason I bought them. The cheapos will do that, but not these.<br /><br />So as much as I want to love them, I can't use them. They must work for some people though."
3.0,"Flip Flops are running small, I ordered a 13 and they barely fit my normal 11.5"
3.0,"One of the earrings was bent on the latch right out of the bag. I manage to maneuver them to close each time I wear them which is sometimes a nuisance but they are a beautiful pair of earrings. They were on backorder for a very long time but none the less, they are a beautiful pair of earrings."
3.0,Feels and looks a little on the cheaper side
3.0,"The shirt is darling, but waaaay too big. I'm due any day now, so I don't have time to exchange it. I ordered a small, based on the size chart, expecting a size 4. What I got was a size 6/8. I hoped to shrink it in the wash by using hot water, but no luck; technically a positive about the shirt quality. Very nice shirt, but disappointed in how it worked out for me."
3.0,I've ordered a lot of Larace shirts...they always fit as expected.
3.0,Very cute dress. Headband broken
3.0,Not a well made product. The liner of the dress is white so when you try it on the dress stretches and all you see is the white shining through the colors. Did not look good at all!
3.0,"They arrived quickly and all three were there. They fit my piercing just fine, but when I put it in and tried to close the ring, it was incredibly difficult and I found that the ring had gotten slightly bent out of shape between opening the closure and putting it in my nose. Just be careful with them since they are apparently inferior metal."
3.0,"It s a great size, my daughter took it to nationals last week.  She loves it, but she used it for only a week and the inside  fabric tore about 4 inches in the interior .  The fabric just sheared off.  I was hoping it would last the entire school year."
3.0,"This dress is not made for any one with a butt. It is like 4-6 inches shorter in the back than the front on me. The top of the dress and color are great, and it fits as expected."
3.0,"This jacket actually exceeded my expectations. I ordered it in black, and it definitely looks way more expensive than $35. The sizing does run small--I'm fairly busty (36D) and usually wear a US 10-12 in tops, and the size US 2XL/ASIN 3XL fits me fine. Except the sleeves are a bit too long for my 5'4 frame, but I'm okay with that."
3.0,Not much to say. It’s just a hat. You get what you expect nothing really special..
3.0,"Fit was awkward for me. Too tight in places, large in other areas. Fabric was too stiff for summer weight pants."
3.0,Love the fit but needs a cut out to go to the bathroom
3.0,"Fits really well, but the fabric is strange and I don't love the floral pattern in person. Returning, unfortunately."
3.0,"Shorts fit well. Shirt is MASSIVE. For reference, I am 5’6” and 115 pounds. The shirt wide/ boxy enough to fit two people inside of it."
3.0,"Fit was great, as expected, but fabric content was not as advertised in the description"
3.0,These is really nice for the price.... I love...
3.0,Did what was expected.
3.0,As a female the plastic nosepad area was big and distracting in my vision.
3.0,"So I got my band yesterday.  I am on sure yet, but I think I might like it.  I got to check out  The Apple link bracelet. From what I remember of that band, it really does feel like it.  Being unable to see, I can't personally described what the band looks like. I have been told that it does look OK with my watch, but that the color doesn't quite match up.  Also, I can't even use the band right now  because the tools that came in the packaging to adjust the band, weren't the right tools.  There were also no instructions included with the packaging. My  rating as of right now  reflects  both of these issues.  When I go to a jeweler and get my band adjusted  so I can actually wear it without the watch falling off of my wrist, I will update my review."
3.0,Good dress for the price
3.0,You would think Cotton and it would be soft but the fabric is on the itchy side and not soft at all.  Fits perfect and I look the dress but hate the feel of it on my skin
3.0,Fits loose
3.0,Not warm at all.<br />Looks cheap.
3.0,Plastic makes it feel and look cheap.
3.0,"The hair tie is not easy to get onto the band and once on doesn't stay very well.  I wish the band had a deeper grove. it is such a good idea, too bad it doesn't work."
3.0,"This is a gift, I love the picture it’s with quality but it isn’t water proof of because this I am given just 3 stars."
3.0,"This dress would be very long on someone under 5'7&#34; or for someone that had a short torso and long legs. The waist of the dress sits naturally high which works to the advantage of someone with a short torso, but the skirt is so long it does not fall like in the picture. It would go much further past their knees. Also, I would think this dress would not look that good without the petticoat. It seems to be of high quality though, very sturdy thick fabric and the lace upper is very forgiving. As others have stated, it is quite wrinkly out of the package, so make sure you plan ahead for that if you need to wear it quickly."
3.0,Really cute but runs super small
3.0,"Good work shirt. Some reviews recommended buying a larger size than normal, but could have used a large instead of the extra large.  The fabric stretches if needed."
3.0,Hip area is a little small
3.0,"The mechanism keeps slipping.  If you don't mind re-tightening your belt multiple times per day, it serves a purpose."
3.0,"Mask is great, earplugs are just soft sponge and did not reduce sound  at all."
3.0,Not as expected. If you're looking for something very light and petite then these would work. Not the most glam wedding earrings though.
3.0,"SUPER cheaply made but looks kinda cute.  Wasn't very expensive so I think I'll keep it...but should have probably been half as much as I paid.<br /><br />I usually order a medium, I ordered a large, and it still fits like a small....."
3.0,I had read the reviews and they all said to order my regular size. However needed to return it bc it wouldn’t fit... Will be ordering a bigger size because I loved the color
3.0,"We ordered these for my son to use for football under his pads.  They will still do the trick but the fit is small for the listed size.  Mostly around length.  My son is not big but the cut makes the bottom of the shirt rise above his belly button when he raises his arms.  The size is listed as the same as his normal shirts.<br /><br />Aside from that, these are great athletic shirts.  I would just recommend sizing up when ordering."
3.0,"The 5"" inseams are PERFECT! But the 2.5"" run small (at least the black colored ones I hot were). I ordered my normal size for bottoms, a L, and it was way too small fitting. Returning the 2.5"" but loving the two colors I got from 5""!"
3.0,"will not be the size you'd expect... looks nice, but too small in my opinion..."
3.0,I needed them badly and loved the look... until i put them on... they are too long!
3.0,I love the skirt but it is way to small.
3.0,"""Silicone Rubber""?  No such thing.  Feels like silicone.  Keepers don't stay put for long, especially if you regularly brush against it. Silicone feels cheap, but looks ok. Holes were all still plugged as example of poor finish.  All in all, it looks good on my Seiko 5 sport."
3.0,"I don't know ANY woman size MEDIUM that is the size of a triple 0, SERIOUSLY disappointed.  I am a size medium and this is more then just too small.  I gave it to my 9 year old grand daughter and it fits perfectly. SO, there ya go.<br />I will not EVER order from ECOWISH.. just don't go there."
3.0,"Way smaller than I anticipated. They are cute, but not corduroy at all. They’re are velvety."
3.0,The case is great however by viewing the picture I wrongly assumed that a cleaning rag was to come with it and it does NOT.
3.0,"Super cute, but a bit too small.  didn't return it, just gave it to a girlfriend."
3.0,"I like the dress but do not like how sleeves are sitting on shoulders. The shoulders holes are too wide to the back. The correct sitting of sleeves on a dress is very important. As a result,the dress looks cheap, not for the amount of money that I paid. I will avoid to order dresses made in Asian countries. We  have a different body structure and shape."
3.0,"Pretty terrible quality, but I should have expected that given the price. I used this set to re-size a watch bracelet (the links of which are connected with pins that are screwed) and had quite a time. At first, I thought I was stripping the screws, but in fact I was rounding the driver heads. Pretty darn soft metal, I'd say. The replacement bits were, quite fortunately, not the same size or thickness as the originals and only the extra 1.2mm head worked for my application. This inconsistency in sizing, terrible finishing of the heads and soft metal are all indications of poor quality.<br /><br />For barely ten bucks, I'm not going to award less than three stars because they got the job done, but do not expect quality. Get a good set if you plan to use them for more than very simple jobs that requite any force or precision."
3.0,Very cute but did not work for me.  I'm 5'8&#34; tall and weigh 195lbs. so I ordered xlarge.  When I tried it on I could see there was a problem keeping the straps on my shoulders even after adjusting them.  I washed the dress hoping it would shrink a little and help with the problem but it did not.  The dress did shrink a bit though.  unfortunately I now can't return it so I'll just donate it and hope someone with wide shoulders gets it.
3.0,The material is rough.  The color is OK.  Perhaps it will soften up after a few more washings.
3.0,"Feels flimsy and brittle... Not ment for those with thick nose bridge,,,"
3.0,I had i to donate it to a friends that is much lager than me. I will not reorder becauce of the postage cost to Norway.
3.0,Not what I expected. Will not use.
3.0,"I like the dress generally, smells a little bit, but I'm sure that will come out in the wash. Two issues. It has a 3 inch hole near the zipper that I will have to hand sew. And it runs a little small in the bust and rib cage area. The material seems pretty nice, the ecru color is really a light khaki. But it appears to be opaque, which is nice. It also is longer than I expected. I'm 5' 4"" and it hit me right at the ankles."
3.0,It fits way to small.
3.0,Very soft but I got an XL and it fit like a large. I should of gotten a 2x. It does run a size smaller. I gave it to my grand daughter.
3.0,"I'm giving this item 3 stars because of the following. It ships from China, so it will take two to three weeks to come in, unacceptably long for an Amazon order. Second, the actual size of the item is small, so order one to two sizes larger than needed. That being said, when it arrived, it looked great, fit great (I ordered one size larger) and my daughter loves it."
3.0,"I wouldn't wear  it but it wasn't for me anyway: my daughter says she can't stand wearing her school uniform(white collared shirt) and so we bought this so she can wear it under a white tee shirt. She seems happy enough with it, but from the back it puffs out a little so you can see it through her white t shirt. Why not just wear a collared shirt. Are a couple of buttons that annoying? It would like fine under a sweater, but not so much with a tight tee shirt."
3.0,The top was OK. It didn’t have the structure that I was hoping for. It’s a loosefitting tube top that comes with a sash that you can tie around the front to create the effect that you see in the photograph. The fit on me was a lot more relaxed and BoHo and doesn’t have the sexy fit that you see in the photograph. That being said I did contemplate keeping it for a casual summer top. I’m unsure how long the fabric will hold up through washes.
3.0,"The pattern of this dress was super cute. I am usually in-between a small and a medium, but this dress was only available in a small.... definitely needed the medium. I was a little bummed that this fabric was ""slick"" to the touch, not a cotton or a linen like I had expected. The shoulder straps are also very tight and I do not have large shoulders."
3.0,I would have given the pants a better rating but the size runs smaller than I would like. I rarely run into this issue but these seem to be almost a size smaller.
3.0,Pretty. A bit smaller than expected.
3.0,"It's a decent blouse.  The material is not great, but it's cute.  the rest of the shirt is cut very squared so while it fits in some areas, it is tight in others. for example, the arms and waist are fine,but the bust is tighter so the top of the blouse fringes up and the inside collar flips out with the slightest movement, so constantly have to adjust."
3.0,The product was advertised as a 2XL women’s and I usually wear that but it was quite snug. But on the flip side I was able to pass it along to my sister who is a XL woman’s and it fit her perfectly.
3.0,Smells bad.
3.0,The design is beautiful but it is not very easy to breathe through its very satiny on the material. I still wear it but it is also a very large fit.
3.0,loved the fabric but didnt flatter my body type it is very hard for a short only 5ft person with very large breast and a small waist. so maybe it will fit better on a different body type. but mine i had to pin to make work.
3.0,The underwear is nice however they sent one pack without the bottoms.  Beware.
3.0,"Colorful, comfortable. These are definitely 'crew' socks. Tops are 3-4&#34; above the ankle bone, certainly not onto the calf, so if you want longer socks these are NOT for you."
3.0,"Kind of heavy, uncomfortable wearing them after a while"
3.0,"I usually size up shirts in this style expecting the sleeves to fit tightly and the chest to be snug and I like a loose fit. The fit for this shirt is just a little strange. And I call it a shirt because I specifically bought it to go over leggings. It's enormous in the chest and midsection and still snug in the sleeves and across the shoulders. The darts and seams seem to be in the wrong places for me and the shoulders slouch so that I'm constantly pulling at the neck to keep my bra straps from showing. I might can take it in along the chest seams though and alleviate some of the fit issues, so I'm going to keep it. A black top that is long enough and loose enough for my liking is hard to come by so I can make it work."
3.0,"Very cute, I loved the look of it. Broke three days into wearing."
3.0,"I really love the dress and it fits and looks great, but unfortunately it is very stinky! Like dyes and chemicals! After two washings the smell still won't come out. Unfortunately now, I can't return it, but might try some tricks I found online to remove the smell. Kind of wish I had just sent it back due to the stink because it's now almost more trouble than it's worth."
3.0,"This watch is very nice keeps perfect time a bit too much of information dials and buttons which should take some time understanding it but the thing I do not like is the band, it's been about 2 months and both of the loops that hold the extra band tip have fallen off just like that I am not rough on it I always take care of thing I like.<br />So I checked with the warranty and it says there is not coverage with the band. The band is still stiff as new no sweat or damage to the watch band but no service on the band. You would think that with a new company trying to make a name for itself they would go all out and offer something worthwhile selling."
3.0,"Very cute dress but material wrinkles easily and cannot get wet! I still think it is a pretty, flattering style!"
3.0,"This is indeed a very strange wig, it comes smushed inside a narrow cardbox, as soon as you take it out it doesn't look at all like in the picture. You need to invest some time combing it and giving it shape for it to be somewhat close to a 50s hairdo. Once you go through the process it will look OK, but I still think I could have done a better job with my own hair. Unless you are bald or short-haired, I wouldn't recommend this wig, combing your own hair will look way better and natural"
3.0,"I loved this necklace, wore it often.  Chain was not too long on my neck, and was very adjustable.  But, the little ends of the necklace began breaking off and very quickly, the necklace was broken.  Super cute for a few wears, but wouldn’t expect top quality."
3.0,"Arrived promptly, but not what I expected...am returning."
3.0,"These do not fit over my calf's, they say for men and women.  My calf's have always been large and you advertised they would fit. to tight and won't go all the way up. They would be great if they fit."
3.0,"These are a very pretty lace and with a low cut you can wear it with shoes that have a low vamp. My only con is that the sizing states 9-11, I wear an 8.5 and these are so snug on my feet that I feel my toes really squishing and it gets uncomfortable after just a couple of hours. I would recommend them if you have a shoe size no larger than 8.5."
3.0,Straps are way to short for a 5'9&#34; person. They dig into my shoulders and are very uncomfortable. For a plus size the pads are very small and the lining came off all of them after I washed the bras with them in.
3.0,Beautiful dress but it is so small! The fabric gets caught in the zipper. Love the length but I'm altering it to make it fit my curvy body type. I have ordered dresses from this company but the fabric of this dress is different there is no stretch at all in the fabric.
3.0,"Very disappointed that there were no instructions. I was worried that I was ruining my watch while I tried to pry the old band off. Turns out that the hard plastic within that was breaking and crumbling was part of the throwaway bits. Also, the screws in the bag are not even close to matching. Glad I was careful to keep the old original screws.<br /><br />The new band is an identical match for dimensions, the plastic is significantly stiffer. The slider that holds down the loose end of the strap is far too stiff. It's difficult to undo the watch.<br /><br />I'll update my rating in the future if it doesn't last very long.<br /><br />One Month Later: watch band seems good so far. I was surprised to get an unrequested refund from the seller at their own initiative. They seem sincerely concerned about customer satisfaction, so I'll keep that in mind and possibly look into their other product offerings."
3.0,If this were a rating based entirely on the item itself I would give it five stars because I do love these finger lights and I have been using this product for years. However I ordered 40 of these and only received 35. And I wouldn't really care about that if it weren't for the fact the an additional 4 did not work. All in all it is a great product considering the price. Some of these will only last for one party but at the same time I have quite a few that I bought over a year ago and still work.
3.0,Women’s medium fit like a small.
3.0,"The material is fine but they run VERY small! I’ve never had to buy a size large for any bottoms, EVER. I bought mediums and they were tiny and got even smaller after they were washed. Sadly, they got lost in my laundry room and I didn’t find them again until long after my return window had closed."
3.0,The shoe is very nice but not as insulated and durable as I thought it would be for the price; but if it's fashion your looking for this is the shoe.
3.0,"I got it because of the adjustable chain.  When you hook it to the biggest length on the chain, it doesn't hang straight.  So I am unable to use the extra inches if I want it to be straight.  I should have realized that it didn't slide along the chain but I didn't.  I would have ordered a different one that I saw.  I wear it though."
3.0,The fabric isn't great and the shirt fits but if you wan the look in the picture I think you would need to size up 2 or 3 sizes. The front of the size small stopped at the top of my jeans.
3.0,"Was hoping for a true red, white, and blue.  Ended up with pink, white, and teal. It’s oretty and my daughter will love it but not what was being purchased. Also there is a slight faded mark on the side of the “red”/pink. Looks like it sat it the sun for awhile? Not thrilled with that."
3.0,"It didn't have a size tag, it was too big for my 3 yr old."
3.0,The zipper broke about 2 weeks after getting it.
3.0,Wierd fit for me. Didnt live it although the colors are nice.
3.0,"These are comfy, a nice weight, and the pockets are perfect. BUT the dye has rubbed off on one of our chairs and my knees are always black after I wear them. For the price I’m not that surprised but next time I will spend a little more to get something that won’t transfer color"
3.0,I love the camo shirt/jacket but it runs small. There’s absolutely NO STRETCH. I read the reviews before ordering and sized up but couldn’t fasten it over the “Girls”. I’m returning for another size....Fingers Crossed!
3.0,I REALLY wish I would have looked at this item MUCH closer before I washed it. The hem is EXTREMELY uneven and the bottom is quite twisted and uneven. Now I cannot return it because it's been washed.
3.0,"Material feels very stiff and cheap.  I returned due to fit, so not sure if washing would soften it."
3.0,"They are cute, just a little too heavy for me."
3.0,"I recieved these with excess glue on the one. I was refunded and told to keep them. Besides the questionable manufacturing, my son loves them."
3.0,"material is thin, but overall, I like-cant beat the price..."
3.0,"Cheap quality... i guess, you get what you pay for."
3.0,Not so bad. Does the job yet not the best.
3.0,"The dress was pretty,  but ran very small."
3.0,Needs more padding inside. For well though
3.0,"Dress is comfortable, details are done well and fabric is cute.  However the pockets do not lay correctly therefor I returned it."
3.0,The dress was not as nice looking in person and there was plenty of room for my breast on top however the band that separates the two area over the rib cage was very small. Which was very surprising I order it right per the chart and you’d think the manufacturer would assume if you have bigger breast your rib cage would be wider than your head which could barley fit through the opening. Overall it was too bad I liked the length and pattern.
3.0,Fits the arms in medium but a bit tight in the chest for an athletic build.  Large was way too big in the arms and I had to return it for the medium.  My shirt size 16.5/34-35
3.0,"The fabric seems thick enough but the top was smaller that expected. Instead of providing support, it smashed the girls and made them look unflattering. Definitely try at least one size up if you choose to buy it. Otherwise, the swimsuit and lemon print would be awesome."
3.0,"This is a good quality belt, but it's nothing special. Very good belt for the price.  I was trying to match it with a gray pair of jeans.  I think that it is impossible to match colors and shades from online pictures.  Some are no where near what you are looking for to match an article of clothing.  There are many color choices for this belt, so I don't want to rule it out!  You just might fnd what you are searching for!"
3.0,I got a hot spot on the bottom of my foot the first day I wore them.
3.0,"I don't think I got the dress that was shown in the picture, I received a different style dress that is similar and I actually prefer the one they sent me except it's a little too short, I have to wear leggings with it otherwise my butt will show when I bend over (and I'm already short at 5'3 so I usually don't have that problem). Besides it being short, and the fact that I received a different dress, the one I received is very cute and well made."
3.0,"I bought it to help hold in a tummy pooch, unfortunately this doesn't because you have to zip the zipper at the top which is impossible if you have a pooch, so what's the point?"
3.0,Description said the frames were size 48. I received size 52 so of course my lenses did not fit & I have returned them
3.0,Received the wrong item. I’m going to reorder & hope to receive these glasses.
3.0,"It works great, but I only gave it 3 stars because the attachers are the standard things like they use to attach price tags at the stores."
3.0,The materials feel fine.  The design is cute.  They appear pretty well made.  But it is somewhat small.  They fit well on my 8-yr-old daughter who took over these socks.
3.0,Had to return it runs way to small and I'm small but not that small  :(
3.0,"Bought the XXL and wish it was a bit roomier.  Will keep them anyway, as I will most likely wear a cardigan over it."
3.0,Had to send back because they were too small.
3.0,"Very thin string, beads are smaller then shown."
3.0,It is too short on me and I'm just 5'4&#34;.
3.0,I like it to go with other cat pins on a hat. I must be overlooking the size. Can someone provide this please? Thanks much and merry Christmas to anyone viewing this msg!!
3.0,Good quality but definitely runs a bit small. Buy AT LEAST a size up!
3.0,"Though earring was beautiful it can not be used in a daith piercing. You have to bend it all the way open, I could not get it in. I went to my piercer and he told me right away that it would not work as they are not designed to do so. Maybe in a different area on the lobe. Is unfortunate and I had to pay him to put my other one back in.<br />I put it in a different one and because I had bent the earring open so far, it wouldn't close all the way back and eventually came out while sleeping.<br />Bummed"
3.0,As expected.  Cheap fabric but nice colors. Fit perfectly
3.0,didn't fit. too small
3.0,"Great color (blue) and cute cut. The fabric feels so synthetic and not soft or breathable enough. Also, the tabs on the sleeves (that hold the rolled-up cuffs) tend to come loose."
3.0,I got this ring today for my fiance and it shipped really fast with regular delivery! I absolutely love the ring but isn't tungsten not suppose to scratch? Because the first thing i did when i got it was rub it on the concrete and now it has all sorts of scratches! A friend of mine has a tungsten ring and he has done the same thing and it came out perfect. I am disappointed.
3.0,"Basic Santa shorts. For small waisted men, 34 inches and under.<br />If you a thicker waisted guy, this will not work for you."
3.0,"Bag is VERY SMALL ! Thought it would be a bit bigger! And has a funny smell. It has a fold in it, the way it was packaged. Other than that! Bag is a cute petite bag! Very girly and dainty. Seems moderately sturdy for the price. Going to try it tonight for date night with my husband!"
3.0,Too small and sleeves are so tight
3.0,These are small. More of a child's size. They are super cute on my seven year old daughter though.
3.0,Definitely see through. I got the black color. They fit perfect I love it  the tummy control is perfect.
3.0,Very cute and warm zipper broke easily though
3.0,I liked the color but the underskirt is short and it’s very tight fitting. Doesn’t feel particularly classy or modest.<br /><br />May be good if you’re very skinny.
3.0,"Cute dress, I used it as a beach cover up.  The strap on the dress broke the first day I wore it, but I just tied a knot in it and wore it anyway.  Good for a each dress, not good for a dressy-dress."
3.0,The quality of the shirt is great. It's soft and well made. Unfortunately it runs extremely small. I usually wear an XL & ordered this in XXL to work out in but the size looks closer to a med or larg. Ima return.
3.0,ok gift for someone not close
3.0,Not quite a Scottie in design but it still reminds me of my beloved doggie.
3.0,"Very beautiful but the size is not for women, it is for girls."
3.0,"The fabric isn't what I expected it to be (I should've read the detailed descriptions). It's a beautiful dress but because of my shape & size (5'1""/140lbs), it made me look like a pregnant woman ready for labor."
3.0,The shirt looks just like the picture really cute for the price
3.0,I returned it. It appears white but it isn't. It's very off-white with a creamy champagne-colored lining.
3.0,"Very very small, I'm xxs size, so I ordered size M, and it is very small, mainly in the bobs"
3.0,"This dress is made for small petite women.  I wish it was made in 1X, 2X & 3X."
3.0,Sizing is off you need to size up twice<br />Good quality
3.0,"On the bright side, these pads did fit over the existing hard as rock nose pads on my Ray-Ban eyeglasses, which did make them more comfortable. On the less bright side, they added far too much bulk to my nose pads. So much so that my progressive lenses were pushed up to a level that made them unusable for me. I had to write them off as no good for me and order a different solution."
3.0,It's a raised sticker on a pendant...not centered.
3.0,"These are listed as size 0-3mos, however they are HUGE. I'm hoping they shrink down after I wash them, but as it stands, I would say they would fit a child 12mos +. I'm pretty bummed as I purchased these to go with another top I have. Other than the sizing issue, they feel like they're good quality."
3.0,"This dress is very flattering, but it read a little young with the shorter length. The material is very smooth but also super thin. I would definitely follow washing instructions. I returned."
3.0,This product is acceptable both price and quality. Delivery come fast and in perfectly condition
3.0,"the product arrived way sooner than i thought, so that was good! and the paint job was very well done! the only downside was that the chain is very cheap and it broke on the first day, so i had to fix it. overall, its a pretty good product!"
3.0,"They come as pictured.  I'm OCD, so I brushed out the strings & then needed to trim them a bit.  Not the best quality strings, but you get what you pay for."
3.0,"Definitely a cute top, but it is pretty sheer. I did not feel like it fit me correctly. I have a long torso and a fairly large chest. I tried a L and ended up sending it back. For reference, I am 5’6”, 160 lbs, chest 36DD."
3.0,I found the band around the waist a bit tight but love the material of the pajamas themselves.  Very cool to wear to bed though.
3.0,"This jacket would be better suited for a 'junior', the pink is brighter than the picture and the material and button/closures are very cheap looking! Returning it."
3.0,One of the sleeves has a pocket wick makes the fit a bit tighter and uncomfortable. It would be much better also if the sleeves were longer.
3.0,"It is beautiful, but it will get stuck in your hair."
3.0,"Really nice pendant for the price. Eye catching cz surround. The Sapphire colored ""stone"" is a nice size. For me, the color is a black with blue tones."
3.0,It will not let me take a picture but I got 2 of the green shirts and I'm missing blue one!
3.0,"it was not what I had expected, so I returned the skirt, a bit small and a flimsy fabric"
3.0,These jelly shoes are so cute! But i ordered a size 13 ( which is granddaughters size)  and the size is actually like an 11. Order up 2 sizes if you want them to fit.
3.0,"I bought this with the earrings and anticipated that it would be a great look with the red turquoise fashion ring, unfortunately, the coloring is not quite the same.  bracelet and the earrings are a lighter shading.  But like it."
3.0,I love these socks! Soft and don’t lose shape throughout the day. But...I just found a hole in he toe of one pair - third time wearing :(
3.0,Color was not I expected. Really a dark blue/black.
3.0,"Large is not large. Large is a medium. If you normally wear a large, order an XL."
3.0,Would of liked more padding.  I wear it when I am on my encumbered bicycle a couple tomes a week..
3.0,The dress was beautiful and the material was lovely.  I am afraid that it just did not fit my body properly.
3.0,"Nice shoes.  Lightweight.  But they pinched me around the toes.  When I look at my naked foot, I see the rough shape of a V:  narrow at the heel then widening to the toes.  I don't think I am unique.  I don't understand why manufacturers - especially sport shoe manufacturers - feel it necessary to taper the toe.  I had hoped for something more accommodating of the normal human foot."
3.0,"I'm 5'0"" and 120lbs i usually wear a US 🇺🇸 medium but this medium was more like a large. Looked cute but I'm returning and ordering a small."
3.0,Some come with color defect or tiny hole<br />algunos vienen con defecto de colores y con hoyitos
3.0,"Mine does not look as pictured, it’s basically one color of cream. Really wish it looked like the picture. The clasp also sips out easy. So it’s just okay"
3.0,Mire or less
3.0,It's a nice looking but they put the stud in the wrong position I put it at the top of the head when when it's hangs all eyes can see is the top of the head the stud should have been put in the middle of it so that would hang straight and even
3.0,Very sheer. Fits as expected. I wear a medium and ordered a medium. Fit fine. How it's made there's a little extra space from under the bust down to the bottom. Nice for someone hiding a tummy. Only problem is it's very sheer. Definitely need a slip.
3.0,I was disappointed by how basic the skirt was especially considering the price.  I honestly could have made it myself. As i walked around feathers were falling....i was molting! But it served it's purpose
3.0,A lot larger than I expected. I'm not a fan of the big face. The inside look amazing but I just hate large faces
3.0,"The material on this is scratchy, it’s not cotton or any type of workout material I’ve ever had before. I don’t think it will be comfy to work out but it is super cute. I’ll be returning this."
3.0,I love the design of this but the lid is always opening up on me.  Frustrating!
3.0,It's cute but it fits weird. Like runs pretty big in the boobs and butt area. Too bad cause it's made well and decent quality.
3.0,Design is great but I expected the towel to be thicker for the price I paid. It’s fairly thin. Nothing like the thickness of the beach towels from Sam’s Club.
3.0,Overall the shirt is good.  It is somewhat fitting through the chest torso area.
3.0,Strap wore out after a few weeks.
3.0,Decent top.  I have ordered it in medium and the fit is ok. Bought it in a lightning deal hence price is great.What I don't like about this top is the underarm stich  is not so smooth for both sleeves.The material wrinkles near the armpit.But not noticeable.So I kept it.
3.0,These socks might be better in colder weather too heavy for southeast Texas.
3.0,Bigger and heavier than I thought
3.0,Material is see-through. Fit and length are great but not recommended for anyone with medium/large bust.
3.0,"This robe just doesn't fit great and slides off easily. Also does not stay tied well at all. Okay for a sexy addition over lingerie while walking around the house, but don't expect it to really cover anything."
3.0,"I haven't decided yet if I am keeping this cover up or not. On the plus side, it feels nice and the fringe is lovely and thick (I got the white one with the fringe trip and what is supposed to be 3/4 sleeves). On the negative side... the model in the picture must be very, very petite. On her, the cover up is brushing the ground and has flowing 3/4-length sleeves that extend to her forearm. The cover up appears to be loose. On me, who is 5'7"" and 155 pounds, it certainly fits, but it stops a little below my knees and right at my elbows. It's not tight, but it's not this loose, flowing, boho style in the picture either. It also just fits across my shoulders and upper arms. I'm still trying to decide if I keep it or send it back."
3.0,I liked the pattern on the pants the material is not too thin. I was expecting the length of the pants to be longer. the pants stop right past my ankle which is not a comfortable length for me to wear heels. My height is 5 ft 5 in and I have a high waist. So when I wear these pants I am going to have to wear them with flat shoes.
3.0,5 stars for how cute it is but 1 star for how small it was. I ordered an XXL after reading the reviews (normally wear a large) 'and it was very tight. So sad!
3.0,Some of the earrings were broken
3.0,Color not pure white...sort of shabby looking.  Material very thin.
3.0,"Definitely NOT ""Fit to Size"" unless they mean Asian sizes.  I wear a L in US sizes and ordered a L in this shirt, but I could not even button this shirt.  Nice quality, but if you're going to order, you might want to order 2 sizes up."
3.0,"The rings are spaced in a weird way, and seem flimsy. I do like the regimental colors, and wish maratac offered similar."
3.0,"The hat is decent quality, but the logo is small and doesn’t look that good. Overall, it’s “okay” no more, no less."
3.0,Pretty small fit.
3.0,It’s a good wallet what’s good about it. It’s small. Where I keep the money inside. the holder came out Order was placed January 26th and I got the package on Monday  I am not returning it. it was cheap.
3.0,Poor design and look fat.
3.0,Not that cute and shipping took forever
3.0,Runs big. Had to order smaller size.
3.0,"Raw edged hem with slight stitching. Chest region was way too big, but fit fine elsewhere. I'm a 42&#34; chest (36D bra), 42.5&#34; hips, and maybe a 36-38&#34; waist. Wasn't a fan of this style and cut. I returned the item."
3.0,"runs small, but is very nice"
3.0,Sleeves were not properly made.  The left sleeve fit okay and the right sleeve was cut weird and was way too small.
3.0,"Very warm, the hat doesn’t stay on if you’re a woman with shoulder length hair. The gloves and neck warmer are great."
3.0,"Sizes run small, zipped looks like it won't last (but I don't know because I returned them). And their order fulfillment people can't read product numbers or they're color blind & cant tell the difference between red & silver."
3.0,qulity so so
3.0,Loved but had to return due to size
3.0,"The earrings visually are beautiful. The only draw backs is the earring stem is to big. I tried to put the earring in my ear and they don't fit. They seem to be made to fit someone who just recently got their ear pierced. And last the clasp for one earring would not close. So even if I could have gotten the earring in my ear, one earring wouldn't close."
3.0,I needed a break away lanyard. This broke by the lanyard material actually pulling out of the clip.  Not very good quality for the price. I need to add a badge reel. The badge reel will not hang straight because of the design.  Pretty though.
3.0,I wanted a dress with real buttons so I can breastfeed and this had it. I did return it though because the material felt much different then what it looks like in the picture and as you can see from the picture the button area made a whole kinda shape right we’re my chest is.
3.0,Nice cool material but extremely too small. I would need 2 sizes bigger than what the sizing chart goes off of
3.0,Sorry but I returned this item.
3.0,cheap and cute!!
3.0,I returned and plan to buy in a smaller size. Halloween costume quality product.
3.0,"It's made well however it's smaller than expected. Also, some parts were missing. Apparently they slipped out during packing; very disappointing."
3.0,"Too big and puffy on me.  I like the oversized look, but in real life I felt like I was drowning in material.  I felt like you couldn't look at my face first because it was not fitted correctly to my body size.  BEAUTIFUL material though, very versatile.  Also, I saw this same sweater sold from Bohme but cost twice as much. So in that sense, this jacket is a steal!"
3.0,"Super cute shoes, but they run small"
3.0,These would be the cutest and most worn boots my daughter has ever had but the buttons are barely sewn on and get popped off so easily we had lost 2 before we even realized they would come off.<br />She absolutely loved them and was devastated when I couldn't let her wear them any longer.
3.0,"The thumbs on these gloves twist to the side when you put them on.  Not really comfortable, but I guess in a pinch it won't hurt to have them.  I keep them in my glove box with other emergency items."
3.0,These earrings are very cheaply made. They kept falling apart. But they can be easily fixed. So I guess they are fine for the money.
3.0,Not the best but good for the price
3.0,"I saved up my pepsi points and purchase several of the promotional items from Pepsi.  Both this shirt and this [[ASIN:B0010Z3G8C Pepsi-Cola Men's 1971 Vintage T-Shirt]] were purchased for my husband.  He likes the soft-thin material and they wash/dry well.  He is pretty tough on his t-shirts but, thsese seems to be resilient."
3.0,"Lovely, but runs large. 5'4 140lbs and the medium could have been taken in 4 inches."
3.0,"These worked great for a few months. You have to keep a watch on the small screw that holds it together. The screw came out unexpectedly on two of the keychains. When the screw comes out the spring inside, for lack of a better word, explodes. The keychain is then trash."
3.0,would have liked this vest with a pocket watch
3.0,"the product is beautifull and really like the original frmo the cartier , but the pins are not the same so you have to chance the complete brazalet because put just one or two links dont match with original from cartier"
3.0,"I am 5'1"" and the dress fit well in the torso, but was a bit long and the sleeves are quite loose, which is unflattering for the fit of the rest of the dress. Overall it just wasn't a great fit and not quite the cute lbd I wanted."
3.0,Just ok not really flattering.
3.0,Too low on the neck.
3.0,Very pretty but broke almost immediately
3.0,"The costume was cute, but a small/medium was absolutely huge , much, much to big."
3.0,Earrings are okay for the price. I got them for my teenaged son. He is disappointed since one of the black ones will not close and that is his favorite color to wear.
3.0,Turns colors when touches water
3.0,its a bit smaller than i thought but the sleeves are not pink but a light coral or peach
3.0,Love the earrings! Great dupe. Backings came bent. Had to straighten them out but luckily did not break. Seller needs better packaging!!!!
3.0,It is good quality but the sizing is way off!
3.0,I love this shirt it’s comfy and cute but has quirks<br />I have long arms as in 98% of long sleeve font fit! And these I have to roll the cuff to fit my arms. Plus  as soft and comfy and adorable as this is it’s piling after minimal use :( sad mama bear<br /><br />Would I buy it again? 50/50…..if it didn’t start piling so fast I would 100% buy again even w long arms however I might search a fit brand got better quality
3.0,This should be labeled for a child I’m a petite female and the mask is to small and toght for my face
3.0,Very small they mean it when they say it's for girls this is not for a grown up. I guess if I ever find a Gothic elementary student I can give it to them.
3.0,"These are great, very comfortable to wear. Unfortunately after a few weeks the elastic on the legs started to give up. This causes the legs to ride up, which causes me to spend a huge amount of time trying to pull them back down."
3.0,"The beanie is nice and functions well, but it does not have the lip as portrayed in the description, photo, and title of the product. This was disappointing."
3.0,"Totally not for US sizing . Fabric quality was good , but sizing totally off ."
3.0,I ordered more of these shirts but 2 sizes up from what I normally wear and they fit. The reason being I love the fabric. The fabric is amazing.
3.0,"I have to return this because it's too small for my head (I wear a size 7 to 7 1/4 hat), so I had too much of the velcro strap showing and doing it tighter just made the velcro tear off. It's also a somewhat shiny plastic material, which looked like fabric in the photos. It's attractive enough in style, but just not for me."
3.0,"I have had my C410 for a week now and its ok. the website says it works with the free app from Argus. but in fact the app costs $1.99. i know thats a small price, but when you are told its free... the Argus app works well, but there is no way to track and trend calorie intake on the watch or the app. it shows calories burned. would be nice to track both. the sleep monitor on the watch works well, but not when it uploads to the app. there is no trending of sleep hours or quality in the app. if i spend another $1.99 i can buy Azumio's sleep tracker and then have to keep my phone on the bed all night. isnt this why i bought the Lifetrak? Great watch and activity tracker, but the app they have linked with falls short."
3.0,"I have no complaints about the company or the product, but just about the shape of this specific frame. These slip off often while working, while the wrap around style frame Method 7 also offers does not. It allows light in from the top of the frame, leaving your eyes unprotected from this angle. It looks cool, but it's not efficient. Buy a pair of chums with these if you must go for style."
3.0,"Fits decent. sheer material, would have to wear something under it because it is see-through"
3.0,"Item is nice. However, bar length is too short. Due to bar length I suffered discomfort and had to remove."
3.0,overall size and design is nice. Received many compliments on this shirt
3.0,very cool but very small - i ended up giving it to my wife who barely fits in it. Wish they made it longer.
3.0,This product was nice but they are smaller then they appear.  Even as a smaller size they still look good
3.0,"Fits on the small side.. I ordered a Large. They looked like something that my daughter would fit into out of the package. I was SURPRISED I could even get them on but I did. They fit okay. Not very comfortable, they will likely end up at the bottom of my drawer. Thin fabric, not see through."
3.0,"Cute, colorful and I get lots of compliments on it, but runs a bit big I think."
3.0,Bought for my son for xmas. Delivery was fast. But sweatshirt is super thin.
3.0,If you have large breast then this is not the suit for you. It is very pretty and but not made for D cups.
3.0,"As far as sizing goes I could've made the size work..so I labeled it as somewhat small. I'm 5'5&#34;, 140lbs, and wear a size 9 jeans, and a 36C bra.. but the reason I'm returning it is because the colors are not near as brite as the one the model is wearing the photo. Same design, MUCH more dull colors."
3.0,Very nice for decoration but is hard to wear.  Had hoped to wear while gardening.
3.0,"This dress was super cute, I'm 5/8 and weigh 160lbs and ordered a large.  It's somewhat big and I didnt' really like how it looked on my belly, so I had to return it."
3.0,"Loved the pattern but this cardigan was too big, it went to my knees. I am 5 ft...."
3.0,"A Neat piece but too pointy at top for a Dalek, but going to use as a game piece so it will be good enough!!!!"
3.0,Bought it for my son. Looks good but some of the stone have fallen out. You get what you pay for.
3.0,The bathing suit is really nice but doesn't fit. I think if I had the correct size it would have looked good on me and would have hidden my pouch from my stomach. I read the reviews and ordered bigger than normal a 2XL should have went a size or two smaller. I weigh 130lbs 5'5 tall.
3.0,"Very long. Stretchable lanyard. Wish it weren't so long, bit it's fine. I'll keep it."
3.0,The large gems aren't clear as they look to be in the picture. They are iridescent.
3.0,"Love the look, texture and feel of this sweater but it was a little large around the neck area."
3.0,Love it but poorly made coming apart first time wearing it
3.0,"This is a very pretty bracelet but is child sized I believe. I ordered a large 8” and it was entirely too small, unfortunately have to return this because of the size issue. If ordering for a child would recommend!! Would not recommend for an adult however."
3.0,"String broke off the top in the wash, and it's a bit small, but overall decent quality. The color has been rubbing off on my skin a little bit even after a couple washes. The style is super cute though!"
3.0,"Very soft robe, but the L 12-14 was way too short and a bit too tight for my 4'11 and 95 lbs son to wear at camp."
3.0,"So........ these underwear are great, but if you are prone to yeast infections, even in the slightest, DO NOT ORDER THESE. Doctors have been and still do recommend cotton underwear for women, and there's a reason for that. Again, they fit great and I really like them, but I wear them very VERY seldom, like when I have to wear leggings, and I'm very careful to take them off as soon as I get home, and I never wear a pair back to back the next day."
3.0,Is ok but
3.0,Great little heavyweight shirt. Nice fall apparel
3.0,I ordered a grey and a white. The white had different material then the sleeves. The grey one was all the felt material.<br />I wish the fabric combination would have been like the white.
3.0,Necklace arrived with a couple knots in the chain.  There are better ways to package this stuff so it arrives ready to gift besides throwing into a plastic bag.
3.0,Received all scratched up
3.0,The plastic inner frame is too delicate.
3.0,"The boots are indeed black, but the picture makes the leg of the boot look slender and stylish. The boot is actually quite bulky and unflattering. It also has a horrid industrial smell the took over my bedroom. I have to leave the boots on the balcony due to the smell."
3.0,"The colour and pattern are the same. The material is like a shower curtain. I think it spoils the dress and makes it looks extra cheap. Maybe I'll wear it, maybe I won't."
3.0,Very cute costume however the zipper broke and with safety pins we made it through Halloween.  We only wore this once and will not be able to again until we fix zipper.  That is very disappointing.
3.0,"This band is a traditional pin based band. Given that this band is intended for kids watch, I would have thought they would make putting it on easier for kids. If I need to get involved everytime to change the band, would rather look for something which is easy"
3.0,"See update below.<br /><br />This pack is well designed overall although the zippers could be improved. The rectangular shape provides much greater actual capacity than the styles that are shaped like a shallow or wide ""V"". An eyeglasses case can almost stand up inside the main compartment.<br /><br />The outer nylon fabric seems very sturdy although only time will tell for sure.<br /><br />The one design flaw I see is the zippers. They are stiff and tight. They do not zip open and closed easily. Some take two hands - one to pinch the fabric behind the szipper and the other to pull the zipper handle. Zippers are more effective when they easily pull open or closed. I lubricated two of the zippers with some solid silicone lubricating stick and this seemed to help quite a lot.<br /><br />I would probably buy it again although I must admit that I would look around first for similar styles with smoother zippers.<br /><br />Update after using for several months.<br /><br />The stiff zippers got annoying. I purchased some High Sierra lumbar packs that are equally or more spacious, have smooth-operating zippers, have more pockets, and have more-friendly features such as clip loops, key ring clips, cell phone/MP3 player cord access. See:<br />Passport: [[ASIN:B000P583AY High Sierra Passport Lumbar Pack]]<br />Express: [[ASIN:B002YQ628W High Sierra Express Waist Packs]]<br />Envoy: [[ASIN:B000P5A726 High Sierra Envoy Lumbar Pack]]"
3.0,"Truly too small for the new statehood silver coins as some other reviewers said. Their edge is a bit thicker and more broader than circulated coins. It's true, but I'd never grind or sand them to fit. I just won't put in the coin I intended it for.<br />-P.S. The post office destroyed the package, and it came bent but not broken. I had to fix it"
3.0,Fit well. I’m 5’3” 180lbs I purchased a large. I had to return it because the sequence was catching onto everything. I was afraid of damaging dress so I chose to return it.
3.0,I like that this purse has a flap to close. I also Ike that it isn't huge.
3.0,I bought this for the second time a year after my first one started getting worn out ( my old laptop weighed a ton and was hard on it) .. and am disappointed to say my the quality has really gone done.  It’s okay.. but not the great it used to be.
3.0,"I bought the black face / silver stainless chronograph with day of week and day of month displays.<br /><br />My first impression was very good, aside from some packaging differences from the videos I've seen (i.e. no cushion and no gift bag - no big deal).<br />It was easy to remove one link from either side and I quickly set the time / date, and day of week.  Nice weight / balance and looks nice on my wrist.  The chronograph works as advertised.<br /><br />Then I wore it to work.  I work third shift; 11pm to 7am.  After midnight, although the date number changed fairly quickly, the day of week value took nearly 4-1/2 hours.  It shows a single &#34;-&#34; character for all of that time.  In other words, for more than half of my work &#34;day&#34;, it displayed no value at all.<br /><br />Most people, people on 1st or 2nd shift, would be blissfully unaware of this behavior, maybe for years, and likely wouldn't care."
3.0,"From afar this is a great hat.  If you know the logo, then you know.  However the stitching is not great.  I got this as part of a Halloween costume, and it  did serve its purpose.  I love Ted Lasso, and was a bit disappointed in the hat, but I still wear it!"
3.0,Couldn't breathe or see to walk. Wore it for about 10 minutes and had to take it off.
3.0,i used these lenses for 2-3 weeks and now i have a small defect on one of my lense
3.0,Do not like the tights that they have for boys. They could have done a better job the the shorts and not tights.
3.0,I like them other than just huge for the size!
3.0,They're pretty decent for the price but the seem a lot smaller once in person for some reason. I'm happy with the purchase though.
3.0,"There were two big seams running across the chest (not shown in the photo), made it look like a wet suit. I ended up returning it."
3.0,If you're a true xsmall (size 0-2) these leggings will be baggy around the waist and ankles. They're well made and not see through.
3.0,"Purchased for my husband 5’9” 220-230lbs muscular, thinking they were fleece lined as advertised. They are basically long sleeved tshirts with a hood and a bit thinner than actual cotton tshirts. Not designed to keep you warm, or comfortable, probably okay for 60-70F. Had to return. Wouldn’t recommend for working out either, they aren’t the stretchy or thin material as athletic shirts designed to keep you cool."
3.0,Estaba reventada de uno se los hilos y estaba muy sueltas las bolitas la verdad no lleno mía expectativas los símbolos estaban  borrosos. La verdad no vale la pena la compra
3.0,Has holes after a very short period of time of wearing it only around the house.
3.0,"The shirt is a XXL in a women's cut, but fits like an XL. It is short as well. I will need to wear a long tank top or undershirt."
3.0,"Very cool piece, but a lot smaller than I thought it would be."
3.0,The directions on how to fit the bracelet made no sense we had to watch a utube video to fit the bracelet!  Not sure about how it works on your body but we think it is giving us more energy!!!
3.0,I've had these for 3mo now and will not buy this brand again. I expected better quality for the price I paid.  The elastic gussets stretched out even though they fit loose and floppy. I had hoped these would be my go to all year. To have the support I was hoping for I have to wear thick socks. I'll have to purchase something else for summer.  If you have super puffy feet and don't mind them looking old after 3mos these are for you.
3.0,Too large and long not as expected but it is a good skirt otherwise
3.0,Cute but too small for my head and my daughters. Idk who this would fit. Someone with a tiny head or a 5 year old
3.0,Good but pretty flimsy
3.0,It ripped in both sleeves after I washed it
3.0,"Beautiful coat, nice weight and feel. I don't know how the sizing is so off. I wear a size 16 and I ordered the XXL to make sure of the fit. The bust is too small, the arms are super tight, and the sleeves are super long. I would have loved this."
3.0,Poor camera quality
3.0,Thin and cheap the seams are already  coming apart after having it on two times. It worked for the purpose.
3.0,"I like the security these bring, however these are just a bit too short to cover the entire post on any of the pins I own, as the point sticks through. A good alternative to the rubber backs I have been seeing but I worry about catching clothing or my skin on the point."
3.0,"Customer service replaced this black watch because the pink cleaning cloth for the watch was missing and box was dented in several places................well.....I received the replacement watch in the box..........PINK CLEANING CLOTH STILL MISSING AND BOX SLIGHTLY DENTED AGAIN!  It is unfortunate!  I bought 2 watches, 1 each for my twin granddaughters......1 with a white face and 1 with a black face........the white face watch was complete with pink cleaning cloth and the box was not dented.......seems like the problems have to do with the black face watches......So I will unfortunately have to take out the pink cleaning cloth and just deal with the dented box!  OLEVS....YOU GOTTA DO BETTER!  THANKS!"
3.0,It did not have the back flap as described in photo.  It was smallish.  Underwhelmed.
3.0,"Decent quality material and construction, for the price, it's just a tiny bit too small. XL bottoms fit like a medium. I am a size 10 and usually wear a large. Also the jacket fit well but is very short. If you try to wear any shirt under it it hangs out the bottom and looks kind of stupid."
3.0,"i bring the contour on vakay. got the headband mount cause i got tired of holding the contour in one hand and taking a pic with a camera in the other hand. when using the headband, the edge of my hat and eyeglass frames were in the video frame.  it also attracted a bit more attention than i wanted from fellow tourists.  and if you forget to take it off when you're being photographed in front of something, you now have a pretty absurd looking picture of yourself.  but it does free up your hands."
3.0,Doesn’t really look like the picture the green and pattern is different.....  sweater is more wide short kinda disappointed .... but the sweater is really soft and warm ....  bought this for my wife
3.0,"ok so they lasted about 1 hour. at least they made it through my wedding ceremony, and on our walk out, they broke.<br />they looked beautiful tho! but the quality sucks and they  won't last if you decide to walk more than 50 yards."
3.0,"I've been looking for a good floppy hat for floating around in at the lake. It seems even with sunglasses, I'm always putting my hand up to block sun in my eyes. I don't consider myself to have a huge head, usually regular one size hats fit me. This one doesn't fit. It's too tight and it didn't really fit the definition of floppy summer hat. Once I squeezed it on my head, it was too rigid and very Carmen Sandiego. It made me laugh. It's probably the stretching onto my head that made it less floppy. This hat was a miss for me."
3.0,"This was my second order and the wrong size arrived twice. I had ordered a size 4-5t and both times I received 3-4t, however the bag it came it does show 4-5t but the tag on the short are smaller size. Material is nice and cute pattern."
3.0,Not as cute on as the pic-otherwise good quality for the price
3.0,The fabric is pretty but the fringe falls right out.
3.0,Color is definitely a little off. Fabric doesn’t feel like it’ll hold up very well. Is comfy for now.
3.0,My bag order didn't come with resize instructions or adhesive. I had to look online for resize software and didn't use the plastic cover
3.0,I really like this costume! It’s simple but very comfortable. It gives me that hourglass shape without being tight. It’s sewn to make your curves look amazing. The only downside to this costume is the head piece that is in the top of the hood; it’s a bar with 2 balls on the end and it doesn’t stay in place. All in all it is very well made and the stinger on the tush is hysterical.
3.0,"0-3 month fit more like a 6-9month. Love it ,but disappointed we couldn't use."
3.0,"Cute but it does not lay straight like the picture shows. It is bottom heavy so instead of it looking like snoopy is laying down, it looks like he's flying upwards. I will say that the quality of the actual materials seemed good, and it is cute but I had to return it because I couldn't get past the way it looks on."
3.0,"I brought a pair of these adjustable bangles for my mom because she loved a similar style that was brought for my toddler. Unfortunately, this product was nowhere near as perfect as the ones my toddler owns. The clasps or whatever it’s called on one of the bangles was crooked and caused the bangle to have a somewhat distorted shape. It was not worthy as a gift. I  ordered a replacement because I really like the design and I know my mom would love these so I’m hoping the next pair would be in perfect condition!"
3.0,The quality is okay.
3.0,Fix as expected. I loved the fabric.
3.0,"Great hat, but ordered olive and received a grey one. It look like this has happened to others as well."
3.0,"Upon arrival the pointer finger was sewn closed about halfway down. After cutting the string and part of the lining, I was able to get my hand in. Doubt they will be water proof now! The gloves are warm, but at approximately 20 degrees and outside for 30 minutes my hand were frozen. I would try them at the temperature they are supposedly rated at for an extended period of time. Over all, without the issues I had, not a bad glove for the price."
3.0,It is really cute and I like it very much.
3.0,"These are good quality, nice feel and look just as described. Would have been 4 stars but they run slightly small and are extremely tight. Yes they are for compression but they are sooooooo tight they almost cut off circulation."
3.0,"I didn't end up being a fan simply due to the odd fit of this hat; the quality is fine, there were not complaints, it was well made, stitching was solid as was the overall quality of the fabric itself. The size was standard - just the fit looks terrible. Neutral rating because the style wasn't good but the cap is fine."
3.0,"I like this piece a lot. The gold color is very vibrant. It does get tangled if not hung properly when it is not being worn. And remember these are not solid gold, so take them off at the end of the day and store them properly and they will last nicely for you."
3.0,"Beautiful pink color, slightly more on the coral pink size and deeper & trim matches well. Nice soft material listed as 95% cotton. Sizing it way off or Asian sizing. Asian sizing is about 2 sizes small than US sizing from my experience. I have a pair just like this in a blue shade by Aibrou and the Medium fits great - ture to US sizing. Per this product;s size chart I first ordered a Large. The Large was too small so I ordered an XLarge. The XL was sized very oddly. I have skinny upper arms and the arm holes on this set were uncomfortable  - too small and no bigger than the Large. The Chest area is ample and the shorts were a little big. The material did not seem see through but was showy on. For reference I take Size Small in Carol Hochman PJ's and Medium is some brands. I am usually a Women's Medium top and Size 6 pant.<br />Three 8's for the material & color. Minus 2* for the fit."
3.0,Showed up broken so I had to fix. It was cheap enough not to mind....
3.0,"Chest was too big, dress was too long. I went by the size chart but it still was too long and the butt area had ruffles the doesn’t reflect in the picture. Would order again netherless but in a medium."
3.0,Order sized up as other reviews suggested and body wise it fit good but the cup size its tooooo big I feel like I'm going to be exposed and the straps aren't my favorite either the quality it poor but the design is cute
3.0,"I like the quality of the socks, however the calves are super tight.  I mean I get it, they are compression socks... But I own several pairs and these are the only ones that literally cut off circulation to my calves.  I think I was on the upper end of the sizing scale with a size 10 foot in women's. So if you are on the cusp, I would say go up a size."
3.0,"Perfect length for leggings, looks great with tank underneath or over a bathing suit, lightweight, but tight on the chest area for larger breast size."
3.0,I didn't get a chance to wear them because they run big so I was supposed to send them back but missed my window... Buy one size smaller....
3.0,Good quality but too stiff.
3.0,"It is not as long as shown in the picture but I am short so it works for me.  I purchased a XL, the size I wear, and it fits just fine."
3.0,"Expected them to be more substantial and better made, but these will do for now"
3.0,"They came nicely packaged, but the ones that I got are a 12 gauge, not a 14."
3.0,Black size small is true to size. Red wine size small is NOT. I think it may half to do with fabric. They are different. Red is like an extra small !!! Red is a dark wine not red really at all as well. Black is fine!!!
3.0,I normally wear a size 6 and this is tight on my foot. I would say size up at least 1/2. Also the toe shape is not pointy enough for a western boots.
3.0,Not a fan but others might like them. They have a shiny spandex look which isnt the look I was going for. Didnt care for the drawstring waistband either.
3.0,"I had thought this product would be smaller(thiner), but it is<br />a pretty chunky and heavy piece of jewelry. I don't ever wear it."
3.0,I liked the value for the price but the chain is too short.
3.0,"Okay product! But the ring to butterfly size ratio is off. Ring is big, butterfly is small"
3.0,"I love pattyboutik sweaters and mediums usually fit me well but this one was way to big, had to return it"
3.0,Don't really look like the picture
3.0,It looked like the picture!!! But I have to sew a stitch.
3.0,The product arrived in a timely manner and was as described. The monocle kept popping its lens but all in all not bad for twelve bucks
3.0,it fits but its really tight and i don't feel really comfortable with it but i still like it.
3.0,Fits too loose for workouts. Pads were super lumpy so I had to take them out. Looked like I had potatoes for boobs.
3.0,"The pattern is different on each dress, and the one I received was not nearly as attractive as the dress pictured."
3.0,"My son loves them, they're comfortable but the strap is huge and when you tighten them it sticks out very far and looks bad. He doesn't want to get rid of them for that reason though."
3.0,The socks are extremely thin. Provides little to no comfort when worn in my Sperry's.  I wont buy these again.
3.0,Fits quite large but still a good purchase.
3.0,"This is very pretty (as expected). Good quality material. It is very fitted so for me, 5’ 6” and 140 lbs, it made me a little self conscious about my belly bump even in my spandx. I really like it but will most likely return only because of my self consciousness."
3.0,Difficult to get in ear.
3.0,"Beautiful bracelet, but almost lost it on several occasions. Magnetic clasp does not stay secure. Keep a close eye!"
3.0,The swimsuit fits as expected and is super cute. The style hides imperfections. All I could do was gag at the intense smell of it though. I ordered a L and wear a L/XL on a regular basis. The top was tighter than expected- as my chest is small compared to most. The stench hopefully will go away why washing.
3.0,"Initially I thought that plastic band was to hold the sock up in the photo but it's not. It comes with it. They're really comfy and great, but you could easily have an elastic band be adjustable for footing instead of a flimsy plastic film"
3.0,"Coincide con la descripción, sin embargo la tela al tacto se nota bastante mala y la serigrafía no es de buena calidad"
3.0,Very light tint.
3.0,The gloves seem great but unfortunately they just sit on my shelf and I will never use them. I did not realize they came with a warning label that wearing the gloves could expose you to chemicals that have been known to cause cancer ( as recognized by the state of California).
3.0,Son loved these only complaint is on stays charged longer than the other
3.0,"I expected more for the price, the wings are made of just cardboard."
3.0,Looks like a leather jacket...from a distance. Material is very thin. Would be perfect for a costume. The lining is actually really cute but the faux leather material is too faux.
3.0,"I loved this dress when I saw the pic on here and since I love purple, I went ahead & ordered it. However, as you can see in the pics, the top & bottom part of the dress don’t match, they’re 2 different shades of purple. The fit & quality was great, I’m sending it back because of the mismatched color."
3.0,These earrings came broken but I think their really cute.
3.0,"This suit was cute, but not for someone tall. I am 5ft 10 in, 135lb, did not fit at all like pictured. The bottoms are really thin fabric, not sure that it would last long anyway. Returning."
3.0,"I looked for hours trying to find these in a true child size. Trying to compare dimensions and descriptions.... The result? There aren't any for children. I purchased from 3 sellers. One was a little smaller than the others, but still not appropriate for a 4-9 y/o for sure. They're large-and the &#34;child&#34; sizes are even large on me! So, I love the gloves. They're super cute & we're still going to wear them at Mardi Gras, but we may have to attach them somehow to the kids so they don't fall off... LOL"
3.0,"Seems ok but my daughter was very disappointed that they came in gray rather than purple as it appears in the picture. Also, there is adhesive oozing out on the side of the sole. I was happy that they were on sale, however, had I known that they were gray, I would not have ordered them."
3.0,Pockets aren't very great but at least there were pockets.  Lightweight is definitely the word to describe it.
3.0,Not sure yet! I thought the was black but when it came in its brown
3.0,"I got the navy blue one. I thought it was so cute and a perfect size and as soon as I got all moved in, the main zipper broke off...  Also, the picture shows silver zippers and accents and they are definitely gold. So upset that I have to return because it really is a good size and nice color."
3.0,You can probably get something better locally for the same price.
3.0,The material is very thin and it might do better on a small busted person.  It is a cute design but I would recommend going up in size
3.0,"I ordered a size large in these as I am 145 lbs; 5'3&#34;. They are honestly a bit snug around the legs. I was able to stretch them out somewhat; but probably would suggest that people buy the next size up unless you like that tight feel. Otherwise, they are a good quality pant, that came very quickly to me in the mail."
3.0,"I'm giving this a 3 because it comes with the link removal tool. But overall look, feel, and quality is a bit lacking. If u look closely the metals don't match up. Infact it looks as if the rose gold is just painted on and will chip off over time."
3.0,Stitching sometimes off the edge of the leather. In other areas way too much leather meant centimeter area sticking away from stitch. I love the ability to attach to belt clips instead of strap. That’s better over the Vagabond. Otherwise Vagabond for a little more money is much better quality and higher grade leather.
3.0,It has to be wound manually to keep time
3.0,"I've been pretty happy with other helikon brand products I've ordered and given five stars. This operator style cap was not up to usual standards of the pants, jacket or boonie hat by the brand. Cap fit was a little off and didn't give a clean look. Velcro patch on front was also crooked.  Q.C. May have slipped through cracks on this one compared to the high Q.C. of other products I've experienced with the brand. I still like the pattern and use this cap on occasion. Was hoping it would've been one of my favorite caps. Now it's just a spare tossed in my range bag."
3.0,"I like more compartments, and not as much metal, but overall it has room for all my junk."
3.0,"Standing up, I look amazing but when I sit down, nope. Definitely go up 1 size from your normal size."
3.0,"These are super cute but they run really small. The color is very nice, the fabric is great, and if they would have fit I would have loved them! Just too tight at the waist"
3.0,"Cute, not for swimming. Feels like it's gonna come apart if I get it wet."
3.0,"I gave this three stars because my son hates wearing a coat the three days a year we need one in Florida, but actually likes this one because it’s a dinosaur. BUT, if I had to describe it, I’d say it’s a hefty bag over a sweatshirt. Definitely not anything close to a classic down coat like it appears to be."
3.0,"They were a little snug in the legs.  Returned them. Prob for skinny kids. Also, one of the pairs was a 6/7.  The rest were the 10/12 I ordered."
3.0,I got the men's thinking they would fit better than the others I purchased and they were the same size as the ladies that were tight on my legs
3.0,"This is ideal for smaller applications. I have larger, almost commercial,  sun shades (Phoenix Sun), and I’m waiting for this crank to snap.  Photo shows larger one, thicker, and almost impossible to break... much longer too. You shortys might struggle with your reach"
3.0,"The design is super cute but Fluttershy isn't yellow, which is disappointing. She's a weird tan/brown and it makes it look cheap/counterfeit. Lastly, it runs very large so order a size down."
3.0,La tela es resistente no encoge no mancha<br />Pero lo pedí para un niño de 12 años talla s y le quedó grande las tallas que ofrecen son para adultos
3.0,These look great and fit great. They did come apart though within a couple of months. The seam came apart and the sole wore much quicker than Uggs. Of course they are much more inexpensive as well so that's the tradeoff
3.0,This dress looks nice but it’s very thin material.
3.0,"I got a pair of Margaret Emer pants through Stitch Fix but wasn't willing to pay the $80 to purchase, so I found these as an alternative. The pros: good stretch, fit true to size, extremely comfortable and look cute. It feels like you're wearing leggings!<br />The cons: tummy control is laughable - there is a thin piece of white fabric in the &#34;tummy area&#34; but it is not connected to anything. Don't expect these to do anything for tummy control. The pants are very thin, so if you need to wear spanx for tummy control, forget about it, you'll see them straight through. These pants are also VPL (visible panty line) city. Pants feel as though they will stretch out very easily. The booty sag had started by the end of the day and without belt loops, it's impossible to combat.<br /><br />For the price, not bad. If you want something thicket and better quality, I would look elsewhere. Not sure if I'd purchase again at this price. Maybe if they were $20-$25 I would."
3.0,Love the colors and design of the stitching ...but runs big and has a slouchy look when on due to the large size
3.0,Loved the red color but fabric was rough to touch<br />Yellow one is see through so I returned it
3.0,It's short! Why is it so short? Like having half a jacket
3.0,"It’s super cute and just what I wanted but the zippered pocket compartment is sooooo small. I could even fit my phone. You can maybe hold some cash and possibly a credit card but it really is ridiculously small. The strap is also not very long. I can’t really use as a crossbody, just an over the should purse. Maybe for a child you can do a crossbody."
3.0,I couldn’t get my foot into the shoe. Too small or mismade. Very dissatisfied.
3.0,They don't really glow. But does glow in the dark items really ever glow? They served a purpose for a night event - kids were happy to have something.
3.0,I didnt like.
3.0,"Very soft leather.  Ordered  XXL, one size larger than I would normally buy.  Gloves were tight.  Returned."
3.0,Loved the look but the end pieces that go against your head came off. :(
3.0,Liked the material except it was way to small for me
3.0,Exactly like the pic but not plus size friendly. And I’m hardly plus size
3.0,"Really cute necklace, just not the best quality. One of the chain layers broke off my fourth time wearing it. Didn’t get caught on anything, just broke off. Still looks cute with the missing layer which is why I’m giving it 3 stars."
3.0,Small is now the 'new x small'. Doesn't fit
3.0,I ordered the wrong style it was to be fleeced lined but will keep as a lighter hoodie
3.0,It is most definitely not 38/40mm. It is way too big.
3.0,Looked much better in the picture than in person. Get what you pay for. Returned. Length was actually long on me at 5’9”.
3.0,"The are not water-proof. I spent 2 days in the snow and on the 2nd day, my hands got wet. Perhaps I had an opening at the wrist. They are just ok, but I will be looking for a different pair for my next snow trip."
3.0,"The picture should be bigger on the larger sizes.  What is shown is not what you get.  It must be the same no matter what size you buy, not proportionally sized to the shirt.  A little disappointing."
3.0,The dress fits perfectly order 3x but the fabric is very thin the design and the color is beautiful
3.0,Pretty bag and design but just not me
3.0,it is very cute most companies dont make alot of green the bottom fit but the top was a no go im a 44DD and the girls fell out the bottom there is no wire in it to try to hold them up and the cup size has nothing to do with the correct band size i only reccomend this if you have a B cup size and larger bottom
3.0,"Design and color are pretty. But the size is smaller than usual. I have many dresses of this brand size S before, and those fit perfectly. But this one is tighter, especially around the hip."
3.0,I did not find this comfortable to use
3.0,"This is dramatic and pretty but obviously made for very large ears. I have small ears and all the other cuff style earrings I've ordered fit perfect, but this was way too big and didn't fit at all. I ended up adding it to my garage sale stack. If you have large ears this would probably be very pretty."
3.0,"These are really cheap looking, not something I would use for my jewelry making when I only need a few links. I'll probably give them to my granddaughters to play dress-up with."
3.0,Is not like in the picture
3.0,"The shorts appear to be a good product and the color options and style is great, however I wanted a compression short that had a heavier weight. These are more similar to the weight of knit boxers."
3.0,"I wanted to like this dress so much. The fabric and print look great. But the sizing of this dress is crazy. This dress didn't even come remotely close to covering my chest. Everything else about the dress fit, but my full chest was completely exposed. It could still be worn casually with a tank top underneath, but its not the look I was going for."
3.0,"I purchased 4 sets of the capes, for some of my Grandchildren.  Three of them were 'Girl Hero' cape sets, all of which were perfect!  HOWEVER, the 'Boy Hero' set of capes appeared to have been in the sun, or in too much heat, as the Superman cape logo was VERY faded, & the Spider-Man logo was so 'sticky' that we are unable to get the packaging paper off of it!!  I would return it for an exchange, but my Grandson does not want to be without it!!  YOUR feedback to ME, as a consumer, would be GREATLY appreciated!!  Thank you"
3.0,"I returned this item, as it is to light weight and not warm enough."
3.0,The material is a bit weird but its soft and cute
3.0,It stretched to large for my head and there’s no way to draw string it
3.0,"This was a gift for my grandson, but he has chosen to go COMANDO!  That's the reason for the 3 stars."
3.0,"I purchased a size larger than I wear in fear that it would run small. Turned out that it is very large, I am hoping it will shrink some when I wash and dry it. It does look more like a men's Tshirt that a women's."
3.0,The material is super soft and I love the quality. My only issue is that I ordered a small and it fits like a large would. I am 5'1 and 130lbs with a short torso.
3.0,"I like my necklace. Its very light weight. Its a trendy piece,so you get what you pay for. I like wearing it."
3.0,Not exactly 5/16ths. Why is it so hard to get friggin labrets on Amazon.
3.0,The hat came and looked great. It would have been a great addition to my steampunk costume. Sadly it was too small. I really needed a 2XL which is not availble to be comfortable. It was just too tight on my head.
3.0,"I was expecting them to be more of a real wood look, but alas they are not."
3.0,"I’m 5’8, so I’m considered tall for a female and these shorts were so damn long!! They ended right past my knees!! I ended up pulling them below my knees, I assumed they would be right above my knee but these were just way too long!"
3.0,Shirt ran small and material was very thin. Would not purchase another one.
3.0,"Good product overall, however, it smells like a moldy potato as opposed to genuine leather."
3.0,It's a cute ring and keeps me busy when I'm fidgeting.
3.0,These run SMALL..good material & wash well but should buy a size larger.
3.0,"The belt ended up staining my white outfit as soon as i put it on. Other than that, good quality."
3.0,"The watch is a very good value and functions as advertised.  The resin band is important to me as, for some reason, I'm alergic to the metal in most watch bands.  My only complaint is that the band is about 1/4 in too short and the loop that holds the band down after buckling tends to slide off.  Not a show stopper but, then again, easy for the company to fix."
3.0,wish clips would fasten tighter on pant cuff.
3.0,"It was well made but kinda blah, no sparkle.  I returned it because I bought it for a gift."
3.0,Super lightweight which is what I wanted.  Easy to see distance over the tops of these very low profile readers.  They are a little too low profile.  I wish the lens were a bit higher.  My reading field is a bit too small.
3.0,"Before I most likely return these glasses over sizing, I'm writing a quick review.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />+ Solid build. No obvious weaknesses in hinges.<br />+ Nose guards are attached to lens areas with thin yet strong wire, then plastic grips are screwed in. Those screws are visible from direct rear view of glasses, so any repairs can be done without assuming an unusual angle.<br />+ Overall, glasses seem built to last.<br />+ Shiny gold finish looks even as it should. Haven't used glasses to be able to say how well frame finish holds up or how easily frame can be cleaned.<br />+ Lenses seem to be actual glass.<br />+ Clarity of lenses seems great on first wear. But haven't tried lenses on the go and can't vouch for ease of cleaning them.<br />+ Red plastic grips around the end of each wire look good, slightly translucent to show the wires which sit behind each ear. Seem to be as they should.<br />+ Comes with its own fabric carrying sleeve in black. The fabric has a subtle bump pattern, which makes it less than ideal as a polishing cloth but shouldn't affect its ability to serve as a case for the glasses.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Sizing of glasses is a major deal breaker. I have a small head (roughly 8 1/2&#34; inches from ear to ear), currently shaven. But these glasses' wires were still pressing tightly against the sides of my head and left subtle lines behind the ears. Without opening the glasses' hinges, the opening from widest gap between wires was just 5 1/8&#34; while the narrowest gap from the end of each wire was a mere 4 5/8.&#34; When the hinges are opened, this makes for a fairly tight fit.<br />- Wires are rigid, especially along the ends which curve inward to compress more tightly behind the ears.<br />. While the glasses are solidly built, the hinges will open up when pushed outward. However, the rigidity of the wires makes for minimal adjustment along the wires themselves - meaning these glasses really work best if you have a very small head.<br /><br />I can see these being great for children and maybe some teenagers, especially since the glasses should be able to take a beating (although as mentioned, I am unable to vouch for the lenses or frame finish holding up).<br /><br />But for adults, I'd keep looking."
3.0,"I was so excited when I took this out of the package. The I ordered the red and it came as a bright red/pink. I loved it. I ordered a size up 12/14 (usually I wear an 8/10). The suit fit perfectly on the bottom and the cut was adorable. Unfortunately the top was WAY to small. I wear a 38DD and after reading the reviews thought that this suit may work. I don't think that this would actually work for anyone more than a B possibly a C cup, unless you wanted to show off a whole lot! Unfortunately I had to send it back. :("
3.0,"Material was nice and soft,  looked very nice. Unfortunately ran small so I had to send it back, was unable to get a replacement since there were no sizes larger. But it seemed like a nice top"
3.0,Hate the fit. Too clingy and ridiculously long! Even in the short length. If I hemmed them they would look stupid. Too much stretch in the fabric so that every bump and lump is visible.... returned immediately. Very disappointing.
3.0,I like the way they look But they hurt behind the ears the end of the arms is sharp and unforgiving.
3.0,"Gorgeous neckline, beautiful flattering fit from the waist up...but the skirt is many inches above my knees (I'm 5'7"" and ordered the Medium). The Large would be way too big in the bust/chest area, so I can't order up a size to get a longer skirt. Sadly I have to send it back. (If it were decorated in sequins, I could totally wear it at a Latin dance contest - nice full twirly skirt, bare back & deep neckline, very short skirt...but alas it has no sequins.)  If you need a super-short skirt (mid-thigh), then this dress has a lot of positives. Otherwise, keep looking."
3.0,It's a wide cut not long and narrow as pictured.
3.0,"These are little bigger in diameter than expected. The backings of the earrings need a thorough cleaning due to discoloration of metal. I thought the metal would be shinier. The image, however, is sharp and clear. This is an OK item which would be better as a necklace or pin, not a set of earrings."
3.0,"I absolutely loved this jumpsuit when I first got it. I’d been looking at it for weeks, and finally decided to order one. However, after only wearing it one time one of the straps ripped out of nowhere while I was wearing it a second time. Really wish it would have lasted longer."
3.0,The nose piece broke pretty easily
3.0,Decent quality I suppose but just too small for my head.  Gave it to a friend.
3.0,el vestido es bonito pero los colores son mucho mas claros que en la foto y la tela es como de estambre
3.0,"I have several pairs of compression socks which are good for fall through winter, but do make my toes too warm in spring and summer, and wanted thin stockings with some sort of design, since I already own a couple in solid (bland) colors.  The design options from this manufacturer were great, but the photos do not show the seams which will be visible when you put them on--basically, you have a thin line going down the side of your leg on right and left, on both legs.  Also, the product description states the stockings provide moderate compression (15-20 mm Hg) but these really have mild compression.  I'll keep them for shorter work days."
3.0,Too small with no size adjustment feature
3.0,Pretty dress but it runs small. Thank you seller for your help. You have been very nice!!
3.0,"not too bad of a jacket, but it did not fit me.too small so i sent it back."
3.0,Runs a little small but nice!
3.0,dog hair sticks to it like glue
3.0,cute but not great for those with a long torso
3.0,OK.  not awesome.
3.0,"Extremely small, super cute though"
3.0,I’m not a fan of “dry clean only” items for infants—as I wash my children’s clothes a lot more than my adult clothing.
3.0,I own 4 Joes hoodies and they’re all my favorite hoodies. They fit perfect and are true to size. Except this Kelly green hoodie. It’s shorter/boxier than the others and there’s zero elasticity in the waist and wrists. Bummer!!
3.0,This bag is really cute. It's the right size for running errands. I wouldn't use it daily but it serves my purpose.
3.0,"Bought as a gift for a Brittany lover, nice tie but overpriced"
3.0,"I would love to have given this shoe a 5 star, but in spite of the really great arch support, the shoe runs large in the sense that the top of the shoe is so large and loose  that I tend at times to walk out of the shoe. I bought a size 12 because that is what all of my shoes are. I have to wonder now if an 11 would have been tighter or just shorter."
3.0,This dress is too big so it is not body forming it just kind of hangs like a sack.  It would be a great dress for someone who was a little fuller and not petite. In fact if you have good curves this would be a good dress for you.
3.0,"They look exactly as described, and the craftsmanship ain't bad, but man are they dark.  They're essentially unwearable in anything but the brightest light.  Don't try to wear them indoors unless you fancy tripping over stuff."
3.0,I like these earrings and how light they are. They matched my costume perfectly and made it look great when all put together.
3.0,Was too small. Did not fit my arms
3.0,"The sleeves seem to be very long.  I have another Cutter & Buck Drytec shirt purchased somewhere else that is the same size XXL, as the ones that I ordered.  The sleeves in the new ones are about 1 inch longer than the one that I had.  Otherwise, the fit is fine.  If I had tried these on in a store, I probably wouldn't have purchased them."
3.0,"first of all let me start with the positive. These are really cute and stylish shoes, the quality is also really nice. I got these shoes for my daughter because she has trouble putting shoes on and really liked the double zipper aspect of this shoe (Wedges). What I did not realize or properly read was that is was a wedge.  The last image I posted shows the top of the wedge, which I feel is too high for a little girl. The wedge is also narrow and not good for wider feet. My daughter has slim feet and it was narrow for her. If your child is stylish and ok with tall wedges then it will for. I would totally wear this if they came in my size."
3.0,I don't love this swim suit. The plunge of the top is more than I like and the bottoms are so narrow cut that I feel like my whole butt is hanging out. I'm pregnant! My butt has gotten bigger I'm already feeling more exposed because of that. With Covid stores dont have any options so ordering online is an only option. The top fits and had a little belly room to grow. I had ordered a different one a size smaller and it wouldn't last me through my last 2 months. This one is identical and will last me all season.  Its also fairly thin. I wore it to the lake and it stayed down over my belly good enough. The other one I ordered was a xxl and there isn't any room to grow. I got the XXXL this time and it seems to have enough belly room to grow my last 2 months. I wore a 16 pre pregnancy. I've gained 35 lbs
3.0,Pretty necklace. Very cheap chain and clasp
3.0,The dress was really nice but not true to size. The 3xl was more like a 1x
3.0,bright white in color and they are very tight fitting
3.0,"These are super for scrambling weeds up lickity split.  However the &#34;claws&#34; fall off easily and I already lost one in the dirt.  Without all of the claws, they don't work very well"
3.0,Its a preety good mask but the strap broke on me within 2 days
3.0,"I got this as part of a Mothers Day gift.<br /><br />I ordered it nearly three weeks before Mothers Day, and they ended up having to express ship it in order for it to get to me in time ( I got it JUST in time for Mothers Day).  So - horrible shipping.<br /><br />It was nice, but thought it would be a nicer (higher quality) piece from the pictures. If I saw it first hand not sure I would have picked it up."
3.0,"The bottoms fit perfectly; however,  does not accommodate a F size cup."
3.0,"I am 5' 5"" and 180.  I ordered both an XL and a 2XL. The 2XL top fits, but the bottom gaps.  The XL bottom fits, but the top is a bit tight.  My biggest problem is the amount of skin showing.  I looked at all the pictures before buying, and the top seemed to overlap the bottom.  However, as I'm wearing it, the top does not touch the bottom, and there is a LOT of skin showing on either side of the ""V"" in the middle--much more than in any of the model pictures or actual people pictures.  I do not have a long torso."
3.0,"After only wearing once had to glue bow back on, but is a cute belt."
3.0,"Wife is size 8, 5'5"", 150lbs.  Ordered in size M.  The M fits a bit loose in some areas, but at the same time, the material feels painted on.<br /><br />Not all of the product photos seem to reflect the actual material.<br /><br />The material wears like a second skin and telegraphs every detail of what is underneath; it is quite thin and like cling wrap and looks painted on.  This dress isn't going to work very well unless you are a fitness model or you are wearing a slip underneath.<br /><br />This dress can work if you have the right body type, but I think that the material isn't going to work for the majority of women."
3.0,I wanted to love this!! But it’s a bit bigger/wider than expected. Disappointed
3.0,It's ok I bought a XL for my daughter who wears a medium and it just fit her ..I would say buy a 2 sizes up if buying this product
3.0,"This is a very dainty chain. It is pretty,  but will only support a very light pendant"
3.0,overall nice shirt.  is a bit short
3.0,"Excellent gripping ability which I really need for my exercise class.  I'm a size 9 women's shoe and these are really too large for me.  Otherwise I'd give them 5 stars.  While the grippers are gripping, my feet are sliding forward in the excess sock.  Maybe they will shrink over time."
3.0,"In general, I like this watch quite well.  It has a simple design and the dial is easy to read.  I normally wear a watch with an expandable band but I have gained weight and haven't been able to find one that will comfortably fit around my 8 inch wrist.  This leather band fits fine with 2-3 holes to spare.<br /><br />However, 2 of my ""must-have"" criteria in a watch are a lighted dial and a day/date display.  This has both but neither is adequate; otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.  The day and date display are behind the face of the dial and are displayed through a rectangular window (see photo).  However, unlike the photo in the ad, the window opening is barely as big as the day/date display and unless the day/date is being viewed in bright light, the shadows from the small window make it difficult to read.  When I turn on the light for the dial, it lights the dial nicely but does not light the day/date.  This is a problem for me since the 2 features that are inadequate are pretty important to me.  I tried to get used to this watch in spite of this but finally determined I could not and was going to return it.  But, alas, the return by date was a week ago.  That's my fault for not being more diligent."
3.0,"I kind of liked it, but it was too short comparing it to the one I saw in youtube, I had to use youtube since it comes with no instructions at all!"
3.0,Like the look and weight. Run big- slide off face when looking down
3.0,"Love these for the support, but more are unraveling in the weekly washing. Disappointing."
3.0,A little &#34;puffier&#34; than I would have liked but it fits my big head and works in a pinch.
3.0,"The material is soft, but it doesn't feel like 100% cotton. In addition, it is for short people. I am 162 cm (5.3 feet) tall wearing M-L. This underwear set size L definitely is not for my arms and legs."
3.0,Really cute necklace but cannot take a lot of stress my eight-year-old broke it in the first hour he had it. But we bought a second one and he was gentler to it and it was fine.  Do not buy this product because of its stability!
3.0,"If you have anything above an A cup....look elsewhere.  The logo is adorable, although it causes the tank top to bubble, which looks odd.  It is cut wayyyy too low, so if you have a chest, it’s popping out honey.  I could only wear it without a bra and it was annoying to keep pulling it up.  So, it will be a sleep shirt and bikini top cover up.  But if you sleep in it.....don’t be surprised if you’ve ‘spilled’ out of it in the morning."
3.0,A little smaller than the expected but verry cute.
3.0,the yellow cushion pad on the left one was not glued on properly so I returned them. ok otherwise.
3.0,I loved this sundress I purchase it for my trip to Hawaii and loved how it looked on me
3.0,"These are really cute sandals. They fit well because they lace up, but the material is somewhat thin. I thought that they were leather, they are not, but they are super comfy.<br />The actual color is pewter, not gold."
3.0,"Nice, but so small."
3.0,Things i liked - stoned are Champaign tone and sparkle real good! Things i dont like - metal. Yellow cheap shine. Keeping it for hallowing or comstiumed parties only.
3.0,"This is a very form fitting, body con dress. I went up a size and it fit like a glove. I am very impressed by the fabric-it is much nicer than I was expecting. It has a compression effect without being uncomfortable. However, you really do need a decent size bust to master this look. I don't have that so I had to use silicone inserts or ""chicken cutlets"" to achiever that. This isn't a dress for the modest or shy type, so if you were this, be sure to tune the confidence level up the max."
3.0,"Feel great, big fan of compression clothing.  However, I would NOT recommend these if your entire reason for purchasing them is to combat shin splints as they did nothing for me with that.  At first I thought it was going well, however last week they came back with a vengeance.<br /><br />I've read some complaints of them being too tight, I did not have this problem.  They fit as compression socks should, so maybe these people weren't familiar with that?  Either way, really good product but don't buy if only purpose is shin splints."
3.0,Fits as expected I'm a 9/10 and the medium fits well. The red looks more orange though.
3.0,"For the money these aren't too bad--not as thick as I would like, but I didn't feel like I got gypped, either.  I'd buy them again--"
3.0,"The dress is nice, however it is knee length not the length that it shows in the pic. One other thing is just trying it on the tassles are already coming off. It's still a cute dress overall"
3.0,If ya sweat a lot it’s not for you
3.0,"The sizing for all Dr. Warm gloves is not ""normal"".  I'm a large, and had to return my original gloves as they were too small.  The extra large are okay, but after having received them, I probably should have gone extra large.<br />The gloves stop my hands from going numb, but doesn't keep them toasty when it's in the low 20's."
3.0,Ordered a 3x. And it's absolutely not true to size.😔 But it made a wonderful gift 👍and
3.0,"The style is so cute, the sleeves are my fav. The problem is the material. It’s like spandex or something. And it gathers on the sides which makes it look like a maternity top. Since I’m not pregnant I’m returning it. Disappointed for sure."
3.0,I wanted to love this dress... I read the reviews but still maybe should have bought a size smaller. Looked far better in the pictures than on me.
3.0,"Front pockets aren’t sew in right so it’s lumpy looking when you wear it. I ended up cutting out the pockets so that it looks normal. Other than that, really cute"
3.0,Very cute. Don't recommend for big breasted woman. Cups are made small.
3.0,They look nice fore the price but the red surface (the Wonder Woman logo) was tacky to the touch right out of the box.
3.0,"I received this a day later than promised. so much for paying for a prime membership. The horn itself is very small and you cannot see the stones,  the chain came in knots. I spent a good hour trying to untangle the chain. also the chain is very short. I am not impressed with this at all. I will most likely never recommend this item to anyone."
3.0,"I had unfortunately read the reviews and thought these would work as piercing retainers. Since they seem to be the only ones sold in the US, I got them, but they're not piercing retainers. They do a good job protecting your ears from metal posts, but they won't work for sports, etc."
3.0,The zipper kept getting stuck so I had to use like leggings and had to slide them up. I’m 4’11 and they’rea good length
3.0,Was way to small for my face
3.0,"I returned this dress for a couple of reasons: the color pictured looks like a nice Fushia shade of pink, which is what I was looking for. But when I received it I was surprised to find it's actually a lighter, almost bubblegum colored pink which just really cheapened the look. Also, while I think the fabric was a nice quality because it was thick, combined with the pink color it looked almost like athletic wear (think of the type of fabric you would want a thinner sweatshirt or yoga pants to be in!) I honestly think in black or any other dark color this would look nice, but it just doesn't work in the pink shade!"
3.0,"I want to love this shirt. It fits much smaller than other Mediums in the same brand. Very well made. It is a tight fit. I am 5'9"" 140lbs. for reference I bought a medium."
3.0,"I ordered a size up to be safe.  I am a petite 5' woman 110 lbs and the M was too big.  The dress isn't &#34;as gorgeous&#34; as described.  Extremely sheer, I had to wear a slip and cover to help deflect the opaqueness of the dress.  the rhinestones fell off all night long and I was just walking like a princess in my home talking with people.  The fabric wasn't sewn correctly and caught in the zipper on the first unzip, thus tearing a 3 in area along the neck top.  Good thing it was, big, I had to pull it over my head after that.  For a one night affair with kids, this was fine, I was thankful I wasn't at an adult costume party, I would have been kinda embarrassed."
3.0,They keep water out pretty well for about a week. They rip easy so that doesn't last long. I'm a dishwasher at work though so I am hard on them
3.0,"They were cute, but the Velcro is not strong enough.  Keeps coming undone.  Have to replace the Velcro for something stronger."
3.0,"I actually love the gray capris and wear them all the time. They fit perfectly, are made of nice material that is not too thick but doesn't get flimsy when washed, and the color hasn't faded. They are really comfortable and I really do love the gray ones!<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend these EXCEPT for the black ones. I purchased this item twice and both sets of black capris stretched out after the first wear. The material stretched nicely to fit, but then never tightened up again like the gray capris did. They seem to be the same material and are made the exact same way but for some reason the black ones did not wear well.<br /><br />I should have asked to return them but I didn't. Instead I purchase the second set because I loved the gray capris and I had the same issue with the second black ones. Again, I should have returned them but didn't - my loss."
3.0,"They look good, but just don’t fit right. Quality is good.  But they give me a headache, not sure why. It’s not the bifocals, been wearing them for years. I really wish I could wear them because they look great. Don’t know that I can fault them since I can’t point to why they don’t work for me."
3.0,"The top is truly non binding, which is a plus for those that need that feature. My feet are small so these tended to slip constantly but I am sure they would have better results with a proper fit. They are soft and comfortable and on the thinner side. Again, I believe they fit the bill for those with the needs of these features, yet they are not the docks for everyone."
3.0,The saying on the front makes the shirt but the shirt quality is poor; it’s does stretch much and is very tight at the neck.
3.0,"as i said little too pricey it should be in 20 dollars watches range , the hour and minutes hands are too thin its hard to read time in, picture shows hands are little thicker , overall its an ok watch but too pricey ."
3.0,"In my opinion, at this price point these watches should come with a sapphire scratch proof crystal and at least 50 meter water resistance.  However the watchels ARE beautiful."
3.0,Right out of the package a snap broke...
3.0,This product did not fit me well. I’m a plus size woman on my weight loss journey and I ordered a couple of these shirts for the gym. They are great quality of fabric and the way they are made totally worth the money I spent. I just don’t think they are true to size. They run small which is why I’m returning them. Yes I did see the size chart and yes I measured myself but still didn’t fit correctly.
3.0,Not really oversized unless you have a very small face
3.0,The shorts are okay but the top has a strange cut making it unwearable.
3.0,It's an inexpensive tie and it shows but it will do.
3.0,good watch quality but its super heavy and thick
3.0,Ok for that price..
3.0,"The belt is not bad, but the leather quality seems pretty poor.  It's kind of stiff and not wearing very nicely.  I'm using it but I will be looking for one of a better quality."
3.0,Costume was cute and my granddaughter enjoys playing dress up in it.
3.0,I was not able to dissemble the lenses.
3.0,This was nice. Made well and pretty BUT it was see through so I returned it. I was using it for prayer so that wasn't acceptable. If you are wearing it and can manage the thin (nice feeling) fabric then this is for you.
3.0,I don't think that this jacket will protect me if I crash.  Material n armor is mediocre.  I returned it.
3.0,Cute but to small for me.
3.0,It’s ok but the reproduction of the picture isn’t great quality
3.0,"Bag fits more than you think and is perfect for those weekend trips. It follows both Frontier's and Spirits carryon requirements. Unfortunately my strap broke while traveling in the airport. I was able to connect it to the handles so it still did the job, but I wasn't too impressed by the quality. I still love the bag though, so I'll probably to continue using it for our getaway trips."
3.0,"Its a cool concept, but its just a very cheap product, and i don't really know if it protects my information from anyone"
3.0,Doesnt include the metal pins that keep the band in place
3.0,Very tight needed to buy a boot stretcher
3.0,Top is suuuuuuper cute and looks great. Fit was perfect.<br /><br />Be aware the bottoms do not cover a whole lot of your bottom.
3.0,"Seams cheaply made. I wasn't expecting top quality stuff here, obviously we bought it for the characters, still disappointing."
3.0,"Bought the see through yellow (no mirror) and I'll be returning these. The diameter is much smaller than shown in the picture, the product img shows these as much bigger. These fit more like tiny John Lennon type glasses lol. They're also like, barely tinted. Won't work for my upcoming Mexico trip unfortunately"
3.0,"The robe itself is fine.  It is very lightweight and roomy.  It appears well made and is comfortable.  I ordered a plus size robe.  The belt that came with it belongs with a much smaller size robe.  It is barely long enough to tie with not more than an inch or two left over.  If your usual size is larger than an 18 US,  you might not be able to tie the robe."
3.0,"The shoes were quite a spectacle when they worked. I wore them a total of three times, the first time they worked perfectly, I was the life of my job and got compliments left and right. No work was accomplished that day, everyone was busy staring at my shoes. And the fact that they responded to sound and music had everyone green with envy.<br /><br />The second day I wore them the right shoe went out after about an hour, I figured it was maybe me not charging them right, went home and charged them for the 2.5 hours again. I tested them and both shoes lit up. On the third day I set foot out the door. 30 minutes into the opening set and the right shoe dies, I take it as a loss and keep dancing. Half an hour later the left shoe dies.<br /><br />I cry tears of sadness while I returned them. I hope changes can be made to make them more reliable and consistent in quality. They were quite comfortable shoes, I loved the fabric and look of them."
3.0,"Cool charms, had markings on a lot of them though and like random black paint"
3.0,"Let me start by saying that I so wanted to give a stellar review to this blouse.  The color is exquisite! The sleeves are gorgeous, and a perfect length for me. It is also a well made garment.  The problem is the blouse part was too large, way too large.  It not only dropped and bagged at the chest but also the waist.  I tried adjusting it but to no avail. It was almost like a large sized blouse was attached to size small sleeves.  Very pretty!  Perhaps if you are built differently than I am with larger bust and waist it could work out for you.  I can’t recommend this blouse due to this flaw in construction."
3.0,"Way smaller than I thought... barely can see any of the tinyy details, but my friend still likes it."
3.0,The dress is cute! I can’t give it more stars because I received the wrong size twice! The issue still hasn’t be solved
3.0,"I like the tights, however it ripped after I wore them 2 times.  Good thing I got 2 pairs, haven't worn the 2nd one yet."
3.0,"It is a purse, holds my stuff, only one pocket, cheap zipper. The zipper was kind of the most annoying part. It doesn't go across the entire opening."
3.0,"Nice shirt, very very slow shipping."
3.0,Not exactly thevquality i expexted
3.0,"This is a cute, comfortable shirt.  However, the sizes are more like junior's than women's.  I got a medium and it was snug.  The fabric is also a bit thin.  Overall, it's a fun shirt that I'll probably wear a few times, but I will only cold-water wash it and hang dry to ensure it doesn't shrink or fall apart."
3.0,Would've been a cute top for someone looking for a completely off-the-shoulder look.  Didn't appear that way on model.
3.0,"Love hate mixture of feelings. I guess it's more my fault because jersey just doesn't do right by me. See every little flaw, not see through but rather the fabric is way too thin. I wear a tight long sleeve white shirt under and it makes it look a lot better"
3.0,It's hard to buy from an online store  and it just didn't work out for me.
3.0,Such a shame it's a nice looking mask but the part that goes around the ear is so super TIGHT! Maybe good for a smaller kid but not adults
3.0,It’s okay but doesn’t fit over glasses
3.0,"It's a little see through, but cute."
3.0,I bought my son these sandals in Feb. And one of them was broke in Jun. I have to look for another one. The size is a little bit smaller than regular.
3.0,"Product was as shown and described, I had no problems with it, I got what I paid for."
3.0,The shirt has pink leopard print not tan as specifically shown! Also it has a scoop at the bottom not straight across the bottom.  Almost awkward fitting for someone shirt like me
3.0,"It seems pretty light and flimsy but then again, it was only $10. I wouldn’t recommend it though."
3.0,Overall a nice ring but better buy 1 size up
3.0,"I purchased these throngs to wear around the house. The first time I put them on, they were very uncomfortable because there was a plastic tube that kind of spreads your toes out. I decided to keep them anyway, so I cut off that plastic tube, and now they feel fine. I give them only 3 stars because I don't really like to have to repair things that I buy. Still, that was my experience. If you are used to thongs, the plastic tube might not bother you."
3.0,I have a normal size head and this hat is tight.  No stretch.  It’s cute and I’ll keep it and hope it stretches out.
3.0,"A bit disappointed in the quality of the checkbook cover.<br />Overall, fits well."
3.0,"They're nice, but the sticky substance that holds the stocking on your legs can be somewhat uncomfortable."
3.0,I like the design but the quality is not what I really wanted.. It's a low quality knit and I am afraid after washing it once or twice it won't be good.
3.0,"They are not as vibrant as the picture, the colors are faded."
3.0,This shirt serves its purpose for play. However i could barely get it over my 26 month olds head because the hole was too small. Also the bottom on the shirt was about 1/4 inch longer on one side then the other when flat.
3.0,One leg pant is tighter then the other. I can't believe I paid 30.
3.0,"I have had this band for just over a month. I loved it at first, but quickly noticed it snagging very easily. I also work with my hands, this band has started to come apart on the edges and bend weird. It would probably be great for someone with an office job."
3.0,Threads were pulled and blouse was wrinkled like it had been balled up thrown in a corner.  It looked like it was very used.
3.0,"My husband was very excited to get these slippers because they were exactly what he wanted. They are warm and look great. Unfortunately, they did not fit him. They were just a little smaller than he needed - and I got him the 13's. If they had fit, I would have been raving about them."
3.0,Got a large and it’s super loose. Figure if I get the only other size it’ll be for a toddlers head. Other than poorly fitting its a neat hat.
3.0,Hugitout 14k gold plated necklace. So I think that this is a cute necklace but it looks somewhat cheap. The design is nice and the pendant is cute it is not overly sparkly so that was nice. The chains both look on the cheaper side and made it feel like costume jewlery. With a nice chain it would have been a diffrent story. The rose gold color was a fake rose gold and it was to shiny and the color was slightly off. Now the necklace is cute and delicate and I would still wear it with casual everyday clothes. I would give this as a gift to a preteen or a teenager. I would not give this to my mother.  Cute necklace for a sentimental gift or a nice stocking stuffer.
3.0,"Great product, terrible for full figured ladies.<br />I wear a DD, and I just spilled out over the sides, but the bra fit otherwise, so I didn't need a larger size. Disappointing because I really wanted a zip up sports bra"
3.0,5/5 excellent product. Only thing I didn't like is its kind of heavy but besides that its nice.
3.0,Runs small....chest area pops open
3.0,"Love the fit, and length  granted they are really high though and extremely see through"
3.0,not good for thick hair
3.0,"I like them, they are cheap polarized sun glasses, they served exactly 1 week on vacation. Lots of sun and fun, the day we landed back home they broke. The arm fell out of the little hole.  We glued it back, but it fell out again."
3.0,I'd give this shirt a 4 star if it weren't for the fact that it's very thin and see-through. Wearing another shirt under it just looks bad with how thin it is.
3.0,Thin material but soft. Color is pretty but black stands out versus blending in with shirt. It is just a vinyl on top of shirt. Wish it was a little longer.
3.0,"Love the bathing suit, but there was no elastic in the butt."
3.0,It was tiny and not cute
3.0,This skirt is very cute and fits the body well. I personally didn’t like the top
3.0,It is such a beautiful dress with such nice fabric it's such a shame that it runs so small.  I usually wear a US 10 and it does not cover my bust (36D)
3.0,"Looks great but small. There is no size tag, so I'm not sure if it was returned before. I kept on looking for the size but there's none. It was too small for me. I ordered a medium. I had to return it. I thought about getting a new one but got skeptical about the sizing. So,I decided not to reorder.<br /><br />Too bad it was actually very pretty.<br />I ordered another nightie together with it and it had the size.amd fits me well."
3.0,"They are pretty, but not soft. I was looking for something gentle on my nose. Even after washing they are still too rough for me personally."
3.0,"the sole lining came out a couple times. overall, they seemed comfortable to my son, next summer i'll either buy a size up or try another brand."
3.0,"Nice dress, the XS is a good fit for me. I'm 5'1&#34; and 110lbs, however it's too long and I had to get it shortened. I ended up making the skirt into a high-low look to add some more interest. I also did not like that the skirt is not lined. The dress being white is very see-through so this forces you to wear a slip, so I had the seamstress sew in some white lining at the waist."
3.0,Ok for the money. Broke 2 weeks later
3.0,"the colour is nice however, I found the size to be pretty small. I have worn it a couple of times and I like the look. I am hoping that it will not change colour."
3.0,It is nice and comfortable. A bit smaller though. The material is not as soft as I’d expected.
3.0,"bought for my son, he loves PvsZ.  There are a lot of seams in the hat and they did in such a way so that the majority of the designs are cut in half or even less, I feel like they could have done a better job sewing it so that more of the pictures are shown or even lined up so that it looks better.  The quality is pretty low but if you want PvsZ apparel you won't find much so you take what you can get."
3.0,"I really like this ring. I have some concerns about how long it will last, as the setting seems flimsy. However for the price I expected it wouldn't be the highest quality setting. I'm hoping it will last a little while. UPDATE: As I suspected the ring broke off at the flimsy weld. I got about 20 wears out of it before it broke."
3.0,"Let me just start by saying that they are SUPER comfortable boots. I also love the color & style. I always buy boots a size larger so I can wear thick socks in the winter, so I feel like they fit true to size. I loved them from day 1 & was happy with them. HOWEVER, about the 3rd time I wore them I looked closer & noticed the surface material &#34;peeling&#34; away in several places. Now I know $40 is not a lot to pay for boots, but I didn't expect to see this after only 3 days of wear. I have a dark brown pair of riding boots I bought from Goodwill for $10 that (after much more wear) still look perfect. All that being said, I still can't resist wearing them at least once a week, that is until I snag a better quality pair of cognac riding boots from the thrift store. LOL"
3.0,"The fit was a little weird (kinda pointy so my toes felt a little cramped).  The wide calf did fit nicely however because of the uncomfortable pointy toe and heel, my foot seems to slide forward, cramping my toes even more.  In the end, I sent these back."
3.0,"Quality poor, lens popped out of frame after only wearing a few times."
3.0,Love the way the band looks! It just rubs off real easy. So other than that its a great buy!
3.0,Okay for the price but they shrink and fade. Not totally upset because they were cheap but after washing them they won’t fit the same. But a size up so they fit after washing.
3.0,"Arrived late and mildewed, washed clean perfectly fine though. I’d also say size up and get yourself a slip to wear under because it is very see through"
3.0,Nice concept but the gold print was too garish.
3.0,"Looks great. Almost just like the picture. Except a slightly different color. It's more of a gold. I don't agree with the reviews saying the cuff was put on wrong. It looked right to me. My complaint is that it's very difficult to get on. And when you do get it on, you have a bit of trouble getting it to stay on. Also, the cuff part isn't very comfortable because you have to push it into the back of your ear to get it to stay. To add, I knew when I bought it that I would have to adjust it to get it to fit right, but as I was bending a little to try and shape it a little better, it snapped in my fingers. I'm giving it three stars because of how pretty it is and the fact that I can fix it with some super glue and possibly glue an earring rod onto the point of the tail to make it easier to keep on."
3.0,"Chain broke within a week. The charm is nice though. But while i read reviews saying that the charm was large, it didn't seem very large to me."
3.0,"I love the fabric of these masks, but the nose and chin really are a bit pointy. Not terrible but not really great."
3.0,"This dress is beautiful and the fabric/print are very nice. Stitching is well-made as well. However, the fit is quite bad: the empire waist is a little to high and too wide, plus the ""skirt"" part is way too full creating a nearly pregnant look. Pockets are sewn in such a way that it makes the dress almost hold its full shape, adding to the fullness of the skirt part. Basically, it doesn't flow. It makes a person look larger than they are. I am 5'3'' and 130 pounds, I ordered medium and it fits well with the exception of the skirt part that makes me look pregnant and larger than I am."
3.0,Runs small she probably won’t be able to wear it…
3.0,"The first set of these suspenders that I got did not have a working button. The battery had to be removed to make the light strips turn off. I requested a replacement and the second pair had a working button. However, the battery housing/switch were very flimsy on both pairs."
3.0,Do not care for these too much! The shirt seems tighter than the pants so not comfortable Nd the pants are heavier than expected. I waited to long to return!!
3.0,Too big. Ordered newborn and was sent 9 month. But it’s cute. Quality is good. I’ve just come to realize if you order newborn size clothing on Amazon from shops like this you’re not gonna get the right size.  I’ve ordered multiple outfits in newborn and they are all 3 month or bigger.
3.0,"When I first put on these shoes, they felt very snug across the top of my foot. In time the strap loosened as I kept stretching the strap. Now the strap is comfortable. The buckle in the back is hard to fasten. The shoes are stylish but I do not like having to buckle the strap every time I put them on and off.  I will not buy this style again."
3.0,"The shirt is cute...after we cut the loose strings off. The pants were very long. The hearts do not line up with the knees as it appears in the picture, they're much lower. We were able to use the top, and received compliments, but it is not very well made and I doubt it would survive many washes."
3.0,Nice product for price but runs small. I generally wear Large on all gloves but these are a bit to tight otherwise fine.
3.0,"I love this costume... but it does run a little small, and SUPER see through!"
3.0,I really like them it’s just a little tight in my thighs because I am a little bit more pear-shaped.
3.0,These were great for like two weeks
3.0,This dress runs small and is unimpressive in person
3.0,"Fabric quality was not what I expected, but I guess since many things are made in China.  It'd be great if it was made of better quality material and would be willing to pay more for it."
3.0,"Run a little small, and have very little grips on the bottom so the baby still slips in them a lot. Sadly I haven’t found anything better so these are better than nothing"
3.0,"It fit but kind makes u look frumpy without any shape wear underneath. Dress is kinda shear and the white dress is also very long and I'm 5'4"". It drags. I'm also 42D, 235 lbs, and got the 3X. My twin is a little over 200 lbs 42D and 5'2"" and also got the 3X. We returned then for something that wasn't so long and we opted for a 1 piece outfit for the renfaire instead of this 2 piece."
3.0,"Very cute, but design was already peeling and showing signs of deterioration. Maybe something went wrong with the application. My daughter loved it so we kept it anyway."
3.0,"Have to get used to trying the bracelet Mate, but handy for sure."
3.0,"Not really worth the price, not cotton, easily wrinkled"
3.0,This is swimsuit material. For some reason I pictured it being more t-shirt material. It will be a swimsuit cover up.
3.0,Very thin but nice on top of a top
3.0,Donated leggings to good cause.  Runs too small for me.
3.0,This product tight fit for large bust
3.0,Gorgeous but it broke quick
3.0,"I like the product in general, but why do manufacturers always make the arms so short on these extra-large jackets.  The shoulders fit me just fine.  I have a long arms, 36 inch long sleeve shirts is what I typically buy, and that's not excessively long.  When I did wear the jacket on vacation, it worked well as I brought the sleeves up just over my elbows.  It is a little tricky to get the zipper engaged and I hope that's not going to be a problem going forward."
3.0,"The hat is very cute. The googles are plastic and rubber, easy to move around. For an older toddler to wear them it is great. For our one year old it's a hassle to keep the hat on and the googles in place. Overall happy with it but not worn as often as desired."
3.0,It's a very thin unattractive fabric.
3.0,Cute little bag for bringing shoes back and forth to dance but zipper broke and lining tore within the first few usues
3.0,"Not bad for $10. The blue pair is smaller than I ordered so it goes right through my ear, but the other 2 seem to be ok. Each pair has one bigger than the other, but not a whole size difference."
3.0,It's not good for people with small wrists
3.0,"This band is very nice, but I have a few complaints. I enjoy the idea of this band. It makes the watch more comfortable. I have an allergy to the bands that are rubberized. This band allows me to wear my watch as tightly as I need to maintain HR connectivity. However, it has worn out very fast. The band is already frayed and I do not wear it every day. There are also noticeable signs of dirt and wear on all visible areas of the band.<br /><br />It fits my watch and wrist well, but it will wear out quickly. It is cute and the utility is great, but you get what you pay for."
3.0,"For the price of the item I was expecting a little more than dollar store quality.  This is a cute item however, I would expect to find this type of quality at a fair or dollar store. The packaging is a clear, thin plastic bag.  The writing on the item is bunched together and a little difficult to read.  I believe the cost should be at most<br /><br />$5.00."
3.0,"for a friend so I saw them, but can't speak to wear or comfort. Cute idea and nicely delivered."
3.0,It does help you suck in and keep your back straight but it cuts into your skin bad. I wore it out and had to take it off because it was cutting into my skin so bad and I didn’t have it super tight either.
3.0,Everyone in the clinic and lab I work in enjoyed these
3.0,"Fits as expected, & it's very comfortable."
3.0,"Much shorter than expected,  and I'm petite. The quality otherwise was excellent. I was sad they didn't work out."
3.0,Chains are too long
3.0,"It's very thin, I wonder if mine came a little bent? I still like it, but I can't recommend at what I paid ($30 roughly)."
3.0,Skirt is cute but the elastic waist band twisted after 1 wash
3.0,"Nice color and great cut, but much smaller than expected.  Put it in the back of the closet in hopes I'll lose some belly weight."
3.0,Adorable but not true to size. Definitely size up 1 or 2 sizes
3.0,"Pretty much what you'd expect. Don't know why it's so expensive, but it was the only one that really fit the bill on Amazon."
3.0,I would like it to be softer
3.0,Don't know what I expected but it just wasn't what I wanted. It definitely works and wears well but just wanted something smaller.
3.0,Pretty but tight through arm area. Was surprised dress was full length. Was expecting tea length.
3.0,Bought in my size and it's a tad snug.  So prob wanna buy size up.
3.0,The hat had a hole in the top of it
3.0,The hat itself is pretty standard. It's exactly what you would expect. I'm a little disappointed with the decal of the great lakes for two reasons: (1) it is smaller than pictured and (2) it looks cheap because it's not embroidered on the hat. It looks like a sticker and was probably just ironed on. Maybe I'm naïve for thinking it would be embroidered at the $10-11 price point.
3.0,Too wide of a dress for where it hit mid thigh.  The fabric is not breathable. My arms and chest felt suffocated just from the fabric. I would never wear it but couldn’t bear to part with it. I  Ended up tailoring it myself to a skirt since I liked the pattern so much. It makes more sense fit wise as a knee length a-line.
3.0,"The glitter and stencils are super cute and easy to use, the glue how ever was useless. I contacted amazon and they took care of the issue."
3.0,"The sneakers came in on schedule, and looks great. These sneakers are extremely bulky so if you dont like your feet to look big, these are not for you<br />Sizing is completely off. I'm typically a 6.5Y in boys so I ordered 6.5 in boys<br />These fit more like a 5.  I could barely get my foot in so I loosened the shoe strings all the way. Too small, I got my foot in and my toes were screaming bloody murder lol. I grabbed a pair of Nikes and put them side by side, definitely way smaller. Size up by one full shoe size (I promise I'm not exaggerating). Colors were vibrant though, hate to have to return these. Oh by the way, it ships as 6.5C not Y, in case it makes a difference for you. 38.5 EUR and 5.5 UK for 6.5c USA. Hope this helps."
3.0,I like the style of the top but wasn't pleased with the material.
3.0,Shirt a little small. Pants fit big. The top and bottom not proportional. Cute set tho.
3.0,Ordered the watch size I needed and the band was short. I need a longer band but it seems the only way you get a longer band is if you have the larger watch. Ugh!
3.0,Pretty thick and stiff but looks nice.  Unfortunately my strap experienced the same cracking in the band as a previous reviewer.
3.0,Not as cute on as I had hoped.  But nice for church.  Comfy.
3.0,"Try on review:<br />As stated in other reviews the knee padding covers most under the knee and less above the knee. However, when I sit with my legs bending at 90 degrees the knee padding seems centered. While legs are bent at 90 degrees the knee padding is more towards the outer side of the left knee and more towards the outer side of the right. If you deal you them in hopes to solve the issue. It'll be the same issue but more on the inner side. The white padding that comes with it seems to protect the lower side of the hips and seems it can be used on either side. To me these could be bought to be used as just for now pants or kept as backup pants. However, if you manage to improve the knee pads yourself. They can be good as primary or secondary pants."
3.0,I liked the style of these shoes except that my foot is wide and this shoe style is for a thin foot. I thought maybe they just needed to get broken in but the shoes material doesn't stretch. I'm neutral on recommending.
3.0,"It’s a decent shirt. However, the fit is yester-year!"
3.0,"Nice belt for occasional use.  It's the right size for me, but the elastic is already showing itself to be &#34;stressed&#34;.  Won't last long, but now I know not to wear it every day."
3.0,Quality is ok. But what do you expect for the price.
3.0,I definitely should have ordered a size bigger and it seems a like thin material.
3.0,"As others have mentioned, for “one size fits all,” these are small masks, more like a child / teen fit.  The mask is too small to go over the bridge of my nose AND fully fit *under* my chin at the same time. I can still get a seal at the bridge of my nose while the bottom fits on the edge of my chin, so it works, even if not as comfortably as I’d hoped. I’m an adult male with an average sized face. The stitching and cloth are not flexible, so these masks don’t have any stretch to them aside from the elastic strings. If you have a small face, or are a child, these might work really well for you. Finally, for those who care, my pack of 2 masks came with a little paper insert indicating they were made in China."
3.0,Cute but fits slightly big.
3.0,"Nicely made, soft, lace-up bodice in a pretty floral print- just what I was looking for for Ren Faire!  It fits well across my chest and torso, but I'm 5'9 and it just looks soooo short. :(  It needs to be 4-5 inches longer to fit properly.  I'm going to see if I can make it work with a skirt and belt instead of wearing it over my skirts like I had planned.  So disappointing because it's really cute!  A Tall option would be great!"
3.0,I really like the shade of pink on these lace Face Mask & a Scrunchie Set. The scrunchie doesn't tangle my hair and I like that it comes with a carry bag. My only gripes is that the face mask are double layer so it's a bit thick to wear which makes it hard to breathe.
3.0,"Expect to have this dress fitted no matter what size you get. It cost me $50 to make it fit perfectly to my body. It was very beautiful, and I got a lot of compliments. The only two things I didn’t like was that it was itchy, and you would leave sequins everywhere. They constantly fall off. I still think with all the little issues it has that it was worth it because it looked so good."
3.0,"The locking key rings will work perfectly for what I need them for, however, they came in a busted open, shoddily taped, package, and 10 of the keyrings were missing."
3.0,"The product was fine and fits well, but the vendor won't stop bugging me for a review.  I doubt if I will deal with them again because of the constant annoying review requests!"
3.0,The earrings were more rectangle than ovals.  They were a bit heavier than I liked and the finish was onesided.
3.0,"I received this with half of one of the chains missing... It definitely didn't break en-route because the links that were broken were completely missing from the jewelry and the packaging entirely. That was a little annoying because they couldn't even quality control the product before shipping it. It looked decent other than that, not super cheap or anything, but it's a 10 dollar chain."
3.0,Very soft and liked the color
3.0,super thin & silky like
3.0,"I’ve ordered dresses in size Large from this brand in the past which is always too big so I went with medium this time. This dress fits remarkably well as a Medium except that the straps are too short which makes the upper part of the dress a bit uncomfortable. I’m 5’9 which is on the taller end of average and usually when my height becomes an issue with a dress it’s because it’s too short at the bottom, not top, lol.<br />If the straps had more length, it would be my favorite dress ever since it has pockets and it’s very flattering. I got complements the first time wearing it, but I’ve only worn it once because it hurts and makes my chest look weird. The short straps pull the top part of the dress up too far and puts the bust seams just above my bust, making the dress unwearable. I will probably cut the straps since they are actually attached with tiny circular hooks that could potentially be replaced to allow for some extension. I’m pretty crafty but I hate working with fabric and was not expecting such a trivial issue especially since the straps are already adjustable…they’re just not long enough."
3.0,was to small had to be returned
3.0,"The shirt is a really nice quality and fit bit the decal is stiff, bright white and cheap. I don’t know that it would withstand many washings without peeling off. It’s NOT printed in the fabric.. actually, when I u folded it, parts of the decal were sticking together like they had just printed it and folded it up to ship out. I’m returning it."
3.0,Didnt like. I like the style but not the fabric. Look cheap and sized small.
3.0,Doable but runs small and it's see through. Good for beach wear. Very sexy in style. Wish it came in a better material.
3.0,All to small in bust :(
3.0,Cute design and great price.  After being worn a couple of times the necklace looks very worn and unappealing.
3.0,This necklace is pretty cute. The cat is a lot bigger than I thought it would be but we liked it nonetheless. Shipping took awhile.
3.0,"The size 3xl was snug and I am a size 16, other than that great sweat machine."
3.0,"Love the look of these socks, I even bought another as a gift for a friend.  Only had them on for a few minutes and I knew they would not stay up.  They were already sliding down my calf.  I planned on wearing them with a low pair of boots but knew I would be adjusting my socks all day.  I gave them 3 stars for cuteness and figured I would just wear them to bed at night to keep my feet warm instead.  For me, these socks will not be something I wear throughout the day.  I have no interest in having to stop throughout the day and pull up my socks.  Bummer"
3.0,"You get what you pay for. These sunglasses look okay, but aren't durable . One pair broke about a month after arriving. The other pair is holding up, but only gets worn while driving now. Quality of lenses is also fairly cheap with some bending/distortion in the lenses, but not enough to be too distracting. About the same as a cheap gas station pair of shades"
3.0,"Loved the look of these shoes, unfortunately they did not fit probably need to size up"
3.0,"Fit as stated in the description. However, stated it would come in 4 different colors, I received two pair black (with different stitching color) gray and a dark blue. Definitely was expecting a little more variation in color."
3.0,"These are very nice quality Shemaghs and the material is very light. However, they are definitely not 100% cotton. My burn test melted the fibers into little black balls. I just ordered a couple more and I am debating trying to get a refund due to the false advertising."
3.0,"The magnetic bands seem to be made well, but it tends to loosen up. One of the bands would not slide into place on the watch frame making it unusable.  Unfortunately, I missed my deadline to return them."
3.0,Haven't had a chance to wear it out yet but...it's OK looking. Not dreadfully cheap but a bit fragile. Be carefully around doorknobs!
3.0,The design of these bracelets are really nice especially for older boys but the rope is so scratchy and stiff it makes it hard to enjoy it.
3.0,"I found it incredibly unflattering. I wear a 14 or 16 in a dress. I'm 5'7 and about 207lbs. It fit it was just very baggy and frumpy looking. The material doesn't fall nicely. There was nothing wrong with it, just didn't find it attractive. Returned this dress."
3.0,They turn yellow after about a week :/
3.0,"I like the styles and patterns. The ends of the fabric roll up though and create a weird look. I didn't realize they were so wide and they had to be folded so much. Thought they would be already scrunchy or have the ability to look good while scrunched. Since the material is thin and stretchy, they are not as soft and loose as they appear to be in the picture. I'm ok with the purchase just expected something else."
3.0,"Theyre a good value and seem built well, but my daughter doesnt like wearing them often cuz she says they make her feet sweat a lot and they get uncomfortable"
3.0,look good put pearl broke right off after a while.
3.0,"The dress seemed to be of good quality, however the dress was huge in the chest and fit awkwardly. If you are bigger chested I think the dress would fit better."
3.0,Very cute suit but the top is not adjustable enough & the whole suit gets a lot bigger when wet
3.0,Las tallas se encojen y luego de dos meses no le sirvió más a mi niña.
3.0,"Good bra, but super tight even when purchasing larger than your normal size."
3.0,Fits good but too long
3.0,Looks cheaply made and too small.
3.0,"I thought I was buying a style of Spenco but upon receipt realized they are not.  The material used on the upper is thinner and flimsier.  The soles are wearing out much faster than I expected.  But they are comfortable and the size is comparable (i.e., not larger or smaller) than the name brand."
3.0,Small writing.
3.0,"The only thing I have to complain about this sunglass organizer is that for some reason it smells so horrible, like old tuna and it's honestly so gross. I had to literally hang this outside for a few days to let the smell fade. I don't know if it's the glue used or what but the smell was horrible and rank. Otherwise, this is a great organizer, and the fact I can keep my glasses organized in a drawer is awesome. It's great but mind the smell.<br /><br />Update: While I have been using this the smell has only gotten worse and just smells awful. I have left this out in the sun to air out and nothing is helping with the horrible dead stench that comes from this. I am just glad that the smell doesn't transfer to anything else."
3.0,"It was cute but not very flattering. Where the swimsuit changes into the bottom portion is a line for that divides the swimsuit. That line crosses the tummy at your fullest section. It's ok if you have a flatter tummy, but not so if you may be bloated or fuller in that area."
3.0,"Beautiful,  but it was way to big for my ring finger.  When I tried it on my index finger, it cut my face and would snag on everything.  I gave it to a friend who can wear it on her index finger and she loves it."
3.0,It's all good except for the battery. Dead on arrival. The nice thing is that others also work in the band. Rumbatime works and that's what's in it now until I get a battery.
3.0,"I'm 5'6 and 190lbs, I ordered an XL and the fit was fine but it didn't end up looking as nice as it did in the photos. I wanted to wear it for NYE but decided it was a little too tacky with the sequins. I ended up returning it."
3.0,"fits okay, I might have gotten it one size to big, but I am a seamstress, so I can always fix it...and I do like some of my clothing bit baggy, I just dont like the lining they have inside...as others have said, it only goes down to the knees ..and just doesnt feel right..but I will fix that..and this is not as light and airy as ya might think...is a tad heavy for such light material...but all in all...nice and comfy"
3.0,These are good for the gym and don't show your butt when you squat! the labeling peels off almost immediately.
3.0,I like the looks and the warmth is alright but the size was smaller than standard and hurts my feet at times.
3.0,Fit is Not so  good for busty girls
3.0,It is a good product for the money.
3.0,"It's just &#34;okay.&#34; I was surprised it wasn't longer, I'm 5'2&#34;, the sweater only comes down to my upper thighs/very top of the leg. It appears longer in the example photo, to me.<br /><br />The neck is a double layer and very tight.<br />The sleeves are more 3/4 quarter than over the wrist.<br />All and all, it's nice material, but I have purchased  better fitting, nicer looking, at Target for half the price.<br />I bought both colors. The black is basic and the &#34;black-green&#34; is just your normal dark green. Nothing exceptional about these sweaters and as I stated, the fit is just &#34;off&#34; from what is pictured."
3.0,I liked the dress it was too big for me have to return it.
3.0,not good sizing...not what I expected..I usually wear a medium in a tight like this but this was an XL and t barely fit
3.0,Gorgeous dress. But i typically wear a 4/6 and this dress was tight! Rush ordered the size up for $17 shipping and it was way too large. The sizing is clearly off. But a very nice dress. I squeezed into it anyways. Also note that the back slit is pretty high up.
3.0,"This looks great from the top, even the inside of the shoe is fine.  But the soles.... they look like dollar store flip flops.  Very thin and zero cushion.  Keeping them since they were cheap and only bought them to wear around the house."
3.0,"Feel nice , but the color more like orange . It is not dark red shown in picture"
3.0,Fits very well. Nice ring.
3.0,read past reviews and ordered two sizes up and worked out great!
3.0,"This hat had a cheap thin ribbon around the hat. My husband replaced it with a piece of woven leather. What a difference it made in the appearance. Also, this hat was sent with the brim totally up so he had to wet it and shape it. Other than that, it fit fine and he is wearing it to work."
3.0,Soft fabric but slides up your body as you move...somewhat irritating.
3.0,"I bought these about 2 years ago and wore them quite infrequently (as I did not want to lose them). Just a couple of days ago I wore them, and when taking them off at the end of the day, one of the posts came out from the earring back. So now it is broken! I will try to fix it, but just wanted to warn folks."
3.0,"These are really cute, looks great on my toddler. After the 1st night the back did bend in her ear. I was able to undo it."
3.0,Super soft and colorful!!! Wish these worked for me but they are super long and I hated the waist band. they are just as pictured so my mistake for thinking they would be different!
3.0,"I had to send it back. Other than it being to large, I would have loved it"
3.0,"The quality of the belt is good, looks legit for the price, sizing is good too.  I just got one where the belt buckle itself and the logo on the belt are facing opposite directions.  Had to return since it's too noticeable for me"
3.0,Very cool belt but unfortunately way off on the size. Had to return it.
3.0,Comfortable but after wearing just a few times the &#34;finish&#34; is almost gone.
3.0,"They look like pants for cooler weather when they really are short. I ordered 3-6 months. My son is a little over 2 months and 23 inches tall, about 10lbs 8 ounces or so and they only go to his knees. They fit find in the tummy area."
3.0,"I originally gave this company a 1 star rating.  However I'm changing it to a 3. After waiting over 6 weeks and inquiring where the coat was, i received a notice that the item was first thought to be lost in the mail...I contacted Wensen and they QUICKLY refunded my $$$.  That was GOOD.  2 weeks later the coat did arrive but it is WAY WAY WAY TOO SMALL I ordered a large but in reality it fit my 8 yr old granddaughter not me.  So I sent it back. The coat is nice, fabric thin but would be good in the springtime..not winter. Wensen seems to be a very organized vendor but unfortunately the Asian sizes are not quite the same as those in the U.S.  I give them a 3 for their efforts."
3.0,I love these socks !!! Unfortunately one pair had a snag in the fabric. When I tried to remove the string it got worse.
3.0,This is not what I ordered exactly. I picked the one with vertical lines these lines are pretty sideways... when I took it off I noticed a few stains.  The neck area was very loose like someone pulled on it...I wasn’t expecting the gray I thought it was more antique coloring... very sad because I’ve been eyeing this dress since last year!
3.0,Has a gift.
3.0,"Fits ok, size was right on, the brown in the chevron is an ugly brown... the material is a shiny nylon clingy material, not a soft cotton that I wanted... should have read the materials better, this material is not breathable... probably won't wear it much but too lazy to return it :/"
3.0,"I wasn't happy with how this fit, more a design issue than sizing.  I was going to return, but be aware this item needs to be shipped back to China, and at the post office the price quoted to ship was $17.25. Buyer beware."
3.0,"Very cute for a young lady who likes mermaids, but only a decoration, not much of a phone protector."
3.0,"Ordered this in Silver White, and I have to say as someone who's owned a lot of Amazon wigs to use for cosplay this is very disappointing even for its price. The fibers are soft but very thin - almost cobweb thin - and they allow the netting at the top to show too much. And because the fibers are so thin, they don't have much durability and they look too frizzy. The wig itself is not even on all sides, I have to do some trimming here and there to make it even. I also tested if the wig is resistant to heat by straightening it with boiling water and curling the ends -- yes, it is!<br /><br />Unfortunately, as pretty as the color and length are, this wig won't last me more than a day at the convention. :( Definitely not suited for cosplay or heavy styling...<br /><br />If you want to try a different brand, MapofBeauty has been considerably good quality for a similar price."
3.0,These are nice and cool and fit nice. But make a pretty loud zip zop sound when you walk lol
3.0,I bough the bw striped and purple in us xl/3x.  Bw striped fit like a small large. The purple fit like a small xl. I wear xl as my go to size. This was very small. No consistancy on sizes. I wish it came in a 4 or 5x so that it would fit because I love the jacket itself. The style of is absolutely perfect and would have fit if I was a us m or us l.
3.0,"I bought this as a joke for a contractor that always had an excuse not to work;  too hot, sprinkling, etc.  It turns out the joke is on me though because this thing is barely larger than the size of my hand.  Pictures to come.  It might cover my 5 yr old boy, but not very well.<br />To be fair, it might come close to covering my shoulders, but when I was comparing them I swear I bought this because it said large as the size although I don't see that listed anymore.  The frame is a lightweight metal with plastic ball tips and plastic hooks that hold attach the headband to the umbrella.  I tried it on and it doesn't feel uncomfortable to wear.  It is small enough it probably won't be in the way while working or playing."
3.0,"I’ve been looking for a waterproof apron for washing dishes and frying foods. Love that these aprons have cute designs, are adjustable around the neck, ties are long enough to reach around my wide hips, and the length is long enough to cover my chest down to my thighs! And they have pockets!<br /><br />Buuut there’s one major flaw with their design. The apron is not 100% waterproof. Water sneaks through the seams where the divider is sewed in for the pocket and leaves my shirt wet.<br /><br />The aprons still serves its purpose for protecting my clothes while cooking but I’ll definitely need to continue my search for a waterproof apron for washing dishes."
3.0,Fits sloppy. Pants look cheap
3.0,"Did not like this very well in person. I just didn't like the way it laid on me and I think I woud have been better off in a 2x, but I didn't like it. The pink was pretty. I returned it."
3.0,"Much longer than expected, reaches your jawline. They are quite beautiful."
3.0,Kind of cheap looking for the price. The edges were a not smooth
3.0,This runs very small! I wear a medium in all other brands and this fit like a extra small I couldn't even get both arms in at once. I does feel like a good quality though! I will be returning and sizing up!
3.0,"Shirt was too small 4 me, so order 2 sizes up, yes 2. Other than being too small shirt looks nice and seemed well made"
3.0,I love the look of this product - it is exactly what I was looking for - except it is a little smaller than it appears.  Also the inside pocket zipper is broken - it does not stay zipped.  I am looking into returning this item simply because of that zipper.  If I pay over $50 for a purse I feel that everything should work correctly.
3.0,tail falls off every five mins. didn’t use the gloves but headband isn’t very sturdy.
3.0,"These shoes are super cute, but they are not goo for running. They have ZERO traction! You will be sliding all over the street if you run in them!"
3.0,"I am satisfied with my purchase, but the model picture makes it seem more like these are thigh-highs rather than knee-highs. I was hoping the socks would reach further up my leg. As of now, they reach to just at and a little over my knees. The material seems thick and of decent quality. The 'manufacturing' smell was pretty strong when they arrived. After a few washings, I can tell that the smell is starting to go away. Shipping was relatively quick."
3.0,"Don’t care for the short torso of the shirt and the material isn’t the greatest, highly recommend getting 100% cotton sweaters from h2h, they are much better quality. The color red is also more of an autum leafy red."
3.0,Good jumpsuit - fit my son but kinda short on the ankles - the mask needs to be aired out once you get it - smells very much like paint or chemicals - just leave out for a few days and it dissipates and is fine to wear
3.0,It’s too small but works OK.
3.0,Great shades but very fragile one slight twist in the wrong way and they're toast.
3.0,"These were smaller than I expected it to be. But then again, I didnt really think about the measurements. I just ordered what I could afford but these are super cute. Unfolding them were alittle tricky, it was abit stiff. So you have to really be careful when handling so the white paper part doesnt tear or make a hole."
3.0,Runs very small. 2xl fits like a large. Colors an quality good.
3.0,It's ok  anchor gets hooked on everything
3.0,Very cute on the front... but the back is ugly. You will not want to put these on any item that flips back-and-forth such as a bracelet. I’ve had them for months and still haven’t found a purpose for them. Disappointed
3.0,"These are okay. They are accurately made but not very durable. I had them in for two days but took them out because they were heavy. Then, when putting them back in, they started to bend."
3.0,My so loved this and after one wash it's now his sister's. We washed and dried it on delicate too.
3.0,Screw on needle head too small.  What size lace does it require?
3.0,"I love these pants however, I spilled something on them and when I scrubbed the spot it faded that area. When I wash them and hang them to dry they’re fine. I have several pairs and really like them. Don’t put in dryer they will shrink."
3.0,"These are more like pajama pants.They are still comfy, but not as warm."
3.0,These are cute shorts to lounge around the house in but going out in them would be a mistake. For one their completely see through unless i'm wearing nude underwear. They're also just super tight around my thigh area.
3.0,"I think they are very pretty, but are heavier and bigger than they look on the photo"
3.0,"I bought 2 dress shirts for my husband by this company. Based on other reviews and size chart I decided to go with XL for my husband who usually wears US Medium. He's 5'9&#34;, 190 lbs. XL appears to be huge on him. I'd say size Large would have been a better fit. I do have to say I loved the material of this dress shirt. Felt silky smooth on skin.<br /><br />I received this product with a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
3.0,"Love the gold leaves, but super thin and looks cheap. Great packaging."
3.0,"I got a small, I am 5'4 and 115 pounds. The bottoms suction cupped my butt cheeks in the most unattractive/unappealing way possible. The top part fit great but the bottoms were like spandex shorts that were way too small and didnt fit. I ended up returning it because of how awkward it fit. Maybe its just my body type though! not sure"
3.0,A super soft tee but be careful washing it. Mine shrunk. It's still wearable but it's not as long & flowy now.
3.0,"I ended up returning this but wanted to give feedback. I was looking for a dress to wear in my Fall engagement photos. I love the color of this and the Swiss dots. Unfortunately, the sleeves and waist did not do me any favors. I have a straight body type - no real curves and this dress does not suit that body type. I do think it would look fantastic on somebody with curves or an hour glass shape."
3.0,This has been adorable and for the price worth it. Otherwise cheaply made headband broke only after a couple times wearing it and snags very easy. But again for the money I’m happy we bought it for my two-year-old.
3.0,"The fit of the sweatshirt I ordered is pretty tight, particularly around the bottom hem (right where you need to be able to move your legs to walk) which is unfortunate. I even ordered a larger size to avoid that very thing. The fleece was nice, substantial and soft. But the zipper is really cheap and nasty, and so scratchy and sharp that it can catch on skin if it brushes bare flesh. I was able to get it to zip and unzip long enough to try it on, but doubt it would work again more than once or twice more. It seems weird to use such a shoddy zipper on a product made with fairly good fleece. It would cost too much to return it to be worth it, and I was planning to wear it open and over long sleeves anyway, so I'll keep it and hope the zipper won't be too much of a problem. But I couldn't honestly recommend the product to anyone else."
3.0,The style is nice. Material is VERY thin! I expected a little bit better quality.
3.0,I got a XL in these stretchy pants. The material is excellent and they fit so well BUT when you put the pants on the color disappears! its faded in the thigh and butt area looks like its super stretched out for no reason. I was disappointed.
3.0,Bought these as light weight shoes for the summer. They are cute but the decorations and buttons came off after a few wears. My toddler is quite rambunctious though.
3.0,"What most attracted me to this dress in the first place were the ruffles on the shoulders. They’re there, and they’re cute, until they move. The underside of the fabric is almost white, so when the ruffles shift a little forward with my movement, they reveal a very unfinished, cheap, white-looking fabric. Very unprofessional and disappointing."
3.0,The bottoms are WAY too small but I love the top!
3.0,"My teen has bushy hair like Hermione Granger in the first Harry Potter movies, and she wears headbands all the time---frequently ones she rolls from bandanas. As her mother, I'm always trying to up-level this, but the lurex foil head band has not been a hit. She says it looks too fancy for school, it's too wide for her taste, and it's a little tight.  I'm going to end up using it to keep my hair out of my face when I use a face mask.  I think it's pretty, but overall I'd call this a fail in our house."
3.0,"Well made. Nice fabric. Has a liner to prevent see through, which adds some weight to the dress. But, not flattering for short people. Looks better if you are tall and thin."
3.0,"Shirt fits well and is made nicely.  However, I asked for my last name on the back, and on a maroon/white shirt it came with yellow letters.  I assumes it would be maroon or black at least.  sent seller a message i will update when i hear back from them."
3.0,These are just ok. I feel like they aren't all the same size because some pairs fit fine and others are too small and fall out.
3.0,I was really disappointed with how the clips slip out of the harness. I lost one of them somehow but they do their job for the most part.
3.0,"The shirt is very cute.  My only criticism is that the back area between your shoulders is a bit small.  The material also a bit itchy, but the print is very cute and the price is quite good."
3.0,My daughter loved this watch but it broke after about 3 months and she took good care of it:(
3.0,"The dominoes themselves are just what I expected....nice and thick, colorful, sturdy metal box!  Not!  Only problem was that the box arrived bent, caved in on one side.  We did unbend it to some degree but the lid just doesn't fit like it should.  I suppose shipping and not product is to blame."
3.0,"This blouse is not chambray.  It is a thin cotton blouse, more like a cotton sheet.  Looks like an inexpensive uniform shirt."
3.0,Right glove was stitched poorly. I could not use them . It would would not fit my hand properly .
3.0,"this is my second time getting this bag - it's so gorgeous, and i get compliments on it.  i've been able to fit my 15&#34; laptops in them.  the only reason i didn't give it a 5-star rating is that the handles are just awful.  on the first one, they started cracking within a couple of months.  the second bag's handles started cracking after my 3rd use, and it completely broke off within a month.  the base is good, but will now have to take to a luggage shop and see if they can give me some decent handles without ruining the overall look of it."
3.0,"This is very cute dress for the price! Also, make sure you wash this in cold water, I washed mine in the laundry and it shrunk like two inches.  I would not buy this dress."
3.0,"Glad I tried it on before the party. Too late to return and I have to sew the poorly sewn seam. It’s open right at the belly button and not in a sexy costume way, sewn bad."
3.0,Runs very large.  Returned with no issues.
3.0,"The color was supposed to be grey but they sent me brown. I will be returning this item, but I love the fit so I'll purchase another set later."
3.0,"It's a nice casual skirt. the material is quite thin, so I will need to wear a slip under it.  It doesn't quite reach my ankles, falls a bit above. I am 5'8&#34; about 135 lbs."
3.0,"I like it, but is too small my phone don&#34;t fit. sad."
3.0,"I got a 3x even though I'm between a 1x and 2x because I would rather have to much coat than not enough. It fit very well around. However I had to cut a good 6 inches off the sleeves, because they hung down past my finger tips. Not sure why the manufacturer thinks that if you're chunky you have orangutan arms. Maybe I just have stumpy arms. Aside from having to do some alterations it literally looks like one of my mothers bathrobes from the 70's. So I also took out the lining and wear it over my PJ's. It is nice and warm so there's that."
3.0,"Not a bad quality, but they were too small and I purchased according to the size chart."
3.0,"Good quality bag , but it wont fit Asus mothership . Sigh!! What a waste."
3.0,Fit is odd. Bought a size up from what I usually wear and the dress is still tight. Pulls at most of th buttons. The top part of the dress doesn’t fit smoothly. It is unflattering.
3.0,"I'm 5'5&#34; and usually a small-medium or size 6, 32D or 34C.  I ordered this in a large and it fit well. It's overall thin and cheap. The top was uncomfortable and unattractive. I'm keeping it for the bottoms but don't expect it to last long."
3.0,They are sweet pants...just white
3.0,My boyfriends did not arrive in time for the game which is why I did less stars. I ordered mine and his at the same time to wear to Bochys last game. It fits great and looks great
3.0,Bought this product for my girlfriend and it broke in a month. Nice length necklace.
3.0,The top is really baggy and the bottom half is really tight and hugs & shows all my problem areas.
3.0,I got bigger ones for my daughters and they fit great but this one for my toddler not so well. It was very small and awkwardly shaped so i couldn't get his foot in it :(.
3.0,Ok. Let me start by saying this is super cute and for the price it’s perfect!!!<br /><br />However. The only option shown was for a Size Large… I wear a Small usually…<br />5’2” and 110-115lbs 34A<br />And.. I squeezed my butt into this one. Once it was on it was a pretty perfect fit though. And again. It’s super cute. But. Just watch the sizing. Not a Regular “large”
3.0,Yellow lines do not show.  Do not look like the glasses shown at all.
3.0,"Seemed good at first, but only lasted one month and I hand washed them!  hole in one and he is very careful putting them on too. disappointed"
3.0,"It was ok. The lace could have been softer and the black layer under the lace felt like a halloween costume, but for the price that seems reasonable. It also had quite a few loose strings and a very cheap, hard to use zipper. The dress also smelled a little weird but I think it would probably wash out.<br /><br />I returned it because it was a bit too big on me. I am 5'3"" and 105 pounds. It was a bit baggy in my waist and hips and arms. But the black underlayer was nice enough to cover up my hot pink bra when I tried it on. I like that I could have worn a regular bra with it, if it had fit me."
3.0,the style of the earrings are cute but they are not as shinny as I hoped and the posts were bent slightly.
3.0,The bars are fine but the beautiful shield was made for super tiny itty bitty nipples.  Not cool.
3.0,This is a lovely skirt. Look great feel great. But it's about 2 sizes too small. I ordered a medium based on my past experience. This fits like a x-small in my opinion.
3.0,"You cannot wear all the stones at once, they all flip over backwards."
3.0,These are SUPER slippery on hard wood. The fake leather fabric may feel and look a little like real leather but they don't have the grip that leather does...they slip right out on hard woods. It's comical actually. But they are so cheap - you get what you pay for!
3.0,Like the sunglasses but the screw fell out & need a replacement.  It is now months and I never head from the company to make arrangements to replace the glasses.  A shame as I like the style of the glasses but expected them to last a little longer.
3.0,"I was a bit disappointed on how the gathering at the top was made. Night it for a dressy event, so thought it would have been sewed nicer.  But overall I am keeping it"
3.0,"Cute apron, awful smell that eventually went away"
3.0,a lot smaller than expected.
3.0,"not what I expected.  I thought it had a zipper that unzipped all the way around, but it did not"
3.0,Not as long as the picture but long enough.
3.0,I ordered a large variety pack and upon receiving them and trying them on it is obvious that some are smaller than others. Each shirt has its own fit. 1/4 I would consider a medium.<br /><br />I would definitely order a size up from what you are thinking you need.<br /><br />Material is thin but that is what I wanted.
3.0,I love this HP so i love the shirt but i have it a low rating because the shirt feels really rough
3.0,"Super Big and holds my long locs, BUT has lost its cling so it's not staying on."
3.0,wasn't what I wanted
3.0,"Item is as it appears in the photos. While I am concerned about the gold portion turning color, it will at lease be pretty for the first wear or two. Note that this item is more like a choker; it sits very high on the collar bone."
3.0,The only thing that disappointed me about these earrings is that the black outline is not as visible as it looks in this picture.
3.0,Not for larger breast women.  No support at all.  The pads are worthless since they are removable and are never in the correct place.
3.0,Can't adjust the size much for someone who wears a smaller size shoe than a size 7 or so.
3.0,I like the way these earrings are constructed but the hearts are too small.  I wondered about it but the picture makes it hard to tell how big they are on the ear.  This could be a personal preference so not an issue with others.
3.0,"I bought this hat along with another hat only to realize, the mesh on the back of this one is super soft. Like that of a laundry net.. I hate that lol. So this hat went to my son."
3.0,"3.5 if I could…Firstly, the lenses themselves are AMAZING- makes you see in HD while protecting you from the sun. I tested these out at Clearwater Beach, FL- one of America’s top beaches. The lenses don’t disappoint!<br />The rest of it however, leaves quite a bit to be desired…<br />1) they are HEAVY- anything you are going to wear on your face shouldn’t be heavy or your nose is going to pay the price- this is drastically softened by the rubber nose pads- but they make the lenses sit just a bit too high. Even with the rubber- these are not “all day” glasses.<br />2) they are TIGHT- great for running, sports, less so for long drives- the metal frame has only a bit of give, and if the ear support were also rubber it wouldn’t be too bad- but they are non-giving plastic- that also gets hot! They are scratchy and very poor quality- bad call by the production team.<br />3) surprises! Good and bad. Microfiber cleaning cloth included- good! Demo card to test the polarization of the lenses- really cool. Carrying case with clip- cool idea, but really cheap materials, somehow makes the whole thing seem like a sales guy got a hold of the package and is trying to make far more out of it than it is…<br /><br />To be completely fair- these are still better than my daily drive sunglasses and I’m happy to continue to use them, but If the design team can replace the cheap plastic with more rubber- give a bit more give to the frame, lighten the darn thing… by a lot… then you are talking some serious sunglasses- because again- the lenses are completely on point!<br />So close- but just missed it. They can save it if they invest in the right areas!"
3.0,The pockets on this item are very odd too low and they also hang out.
3.0,"I like the concept of a Nefertiti charm, but it is very small. It gets lost among my other charms."
3.0,Material itchy.
3.0,"I love the logo on this nice looking, lightweight hoodie but the material is a bit strange. It’s made of: Polyester 60%, Cotton 35%, Spandex 5% which leaves it feeling almost silky and stretchy. Although I don’t love the material, the made in China hoodie is made nicely and I love that it’s lightweight. This fits true to size and is great for the spring or fall."
3.0,Only gave it three stars because the matieral is Silky. My husband calls it my “Chinese Shirt.” Because of the fabric. The patterns & colors are true to the photo. The stripes are black & white with the floral being Navy blue. If Black & Navy Blue patterns bother you or the silk matieral look I wouldn’t buy it.
3.0,"Not bad, but i got a lot of threads on my clothes when i used"
3.0,"I bought it as a costume accessory, so it's good for that. But not the quality I would want in a regular tie."
3.0,"Dress is cute, but definitely doesn't fit like it does on the model in the picture. I listened to the reviews and ordered a size up in xl but could have gotten the large. I am top heavy so it fit good there but was big in the bottom. But nothing a few alterations can't fix. The bow doesn't stand up like it does in the picture, but for the price and with a few alterations and jewelry and shoes it will be great!"
3.0,"I ordered this as the description, and picture, indicated it fit larger pairs of sunglasses.  Unfortunately for me I intended to use this to store pairs of active shutter 3D glasses, which are as large as, and in some cases larger than, some of the largest sunglasses on the market. This will hold some of the larger wire frame glasses, but won't hold the larger plastic frame glasses (example Oakley Gascan).<br /><br />If I intended to store pairs of glasses or sunglasses in it it would do the job perfectly, and look great doing it.  This alone is the only reason I didn't give the product 5 stars."
3.0,Definitely not made for busty girls but otherwise a nice dress!
3.0,Heavier material than I thought. Fit is roomy.  Works great for larger women. Great cover up
3.0,"On the right sleeve the button was sewn on backwards. So it snaps awkwardly making the right wrist tighter than the left. Faulty item, but it is super soft!"
3.0,The cut of the leggings was strange- the fabric pulled and made a pronounced 'vee' on my pubic area. Made me uncomfortable so I returned.
3.0,"They are very nice leggings, but short, and the plus-size certainly does not go as large as they say. I would say the plus fits a large, not extra large."
3.0,There's an odor that was on the masks. Maybe its a package odor but it didn't smell good. Doesn't keep moisture away from your face
3.0,Girlfriend like it
3.0,"The sizing chart was not helpful. I’m normally a small or extra small but the chart indicated to order a medium.  Going with that recommendation, I had to return the item."
3.0,Good product but description is completely different from the product!
3.0,The gloves are good.<br />But I paid for 13$ set of gloves and I received the set that is priced for 11$. Negligence in packaging? I I need to return these.😤
3.0,"The print on this dress is really cute. It’s nice and light and comfortable.  The only thing is, it’s kind of see through.  It would be fine with a slip, but that defeats the purpose of a summer dress to me. I’m 5’8” about 185lbs, I got a large."
3.0,This is super cute. Great fabric. However runs a little smaller so order a size up.
3.0,"Nice, but compared to Hue leggings, I prefer those."
3.0,"It’s a very pretty dress but I find it to be cheaply made. It’s big for a size 12 so if your girl wears a 10/12, go with the 10. I wish I had and now it’s too late to get the size 10 in time for the event. I wish the delivery was quicker."
3.0,Tangles easy and tight around the wrist. All and all not the worst I've seen.
3.0,watch is very large but is a good-looking watch band is very stiff and quite uncomfortable otherwise not a bad product for the price
3.0,It was pretty but smaller than I had hoped for.
3.0,"I was really hoping that this was a sweater and be exactly as shown in the photo. I must admit that when I saw the fabric in the package, I almost returned immediately without trying it on. I’m glad I opted to try on, because it really isn’t as terrible as I had thought it would be. For the price, it’s ok."
3.0,One size = extra small. It was only slightly larger of my 7 year old 50 lb son. The width shoulder to shoulder was almost perfect for him and he wears a little boys size 6-7.
3.0,*UPDATE: 3rd time in the wash and the seams are letting go. I’ll try to fix but the material appears to run where each stitch tore through. 5 down to 3 stars for durability*. I love these shorts. Shipped quickly and the fit is perfect and true to size. Material is soft and the pockets are big enough for my phone which is always nice.
3.0,"I do wish it was longer in the center, but I am tall, so I get why it isn't . . ."
3.0,It fits nice but! Way too long for my height of 5’1” ! Wish it was shorter in length
3.0,They are cute but not high waisted. They have a good stretch so don't go up on you size.
3.0,I must have misread I thought it was more than one. Also I had to use tool to losen one end to get the ball off. Other than that arrived in time and still used it
3.0,i like it. Easy to bring along with you anywhere.
3.0,Too small.  Too tight.
3.0,Had a hole in the first pair I put on. I was told that they came from an outside company but I would think you should look at the way they make them for quality to make sure they meet your standards
3.0,Not a fan of the fabric. Stiff. Not silky like pictured.
3.0,"This shirt is nice, but it is very simple fabric, simply constructed. Not a fancy one. It is super stretchy.<br />Maybe for young girls.<br />I would use it for barbecue on my house. Or for something very very casual.<br />The strap detail is nice and fun, but it does not make it more elegant."
3.0,A rousing &#34;not bad&#34; for these sunglasses.VERY disappointed in how they arrived. Big smudge on the lens. Makes you wonder in they were new new or somebody else's return. Have bought $10 and $ 12 dollar shades that came wrapped better. They ARE light and the nose pieces sort of float around to accommodate anyone's face so they settled in on my beak nicely.Jury is still out whether I keep or return. Like my Merrys better
3.0,"Its well-made, though the shirt kind of creases funny on the shoulders. I cant tell if its a result of the graphic or stitching - and I might be picky - but it hangs strangley. I will keep and wear the shirt, its a well-made shirt, but just that is a gripe I have. Im 5'10, 170 and ordereD XL. It shrank just enough after a hit wash to fit just right."
3.0,This top looks a little more Captain Jack Sparrow in person than it does in the pictures. I returned this item.
3.0,Es mi cómodo al traerlo
3.0,"Definitely not a metal chain, the whole thing is plastic... Kinda disappointed."
3.0,Individual toe slots are hard to put on.
3.0,These would have been great if they were not so small. My baby has skinny legs and they didn't fit him at all.
3.0,"I was super excited to get this to hide my postpartum body and ordered an xl. I am 165lbs, 36DD, and 5’6 and the xl fits snug. I decided to keep because the quality is good and I hope to lose weight, but I highly recommend you to order one to two sizes larger. I hope to attempt to wear this again once I lose more weight."
3.0,"Cute , but to small ☹️<br />And also I could find it cheaper at the store ☹️<br />I recently saw better deal at marshals ."
3.0,Super cheaply made. Fell apart after a couple days of my daughter wearing  them.
3.0,Too long so I had to pay more money to have them hemmed.
3.0,it does do all it promises but so obvious when wearing
3.0,Stones missing in the center of the leaf
3.0,"Looks just like the picture. Wish the material was a little softer. Would recommend to hand wash and hang dry instead of placing in machine, I believe the design will fade faster if you don’t."
3.0,Very pretty but WAY too large.returned it the same day
3.0,"I loved this jacket in the photos .... so much so, that I purchased it in 2 colors. The jacket is quite fashionable, and if you're looking for a warmer, thicker, heavier jacket than the photos imply, look no further. I also keep forgetting that the models used in the photos are a lot taller than me (at 5 feet), so everything I buy winds up looking quite a lot longer and definitely not as chic and stylish, unless it comes in petite short. Unfortunately, this jacket is neither petite nor short on me. Plus, the material is thicker and bulges right above the waist band, so even though I'm slender, it makes me look a lot heavier. Not sure if the photos on Amazon are doctored. Don't understand how the jacket can look so different in person."
3.0,"The dress is gorgeous and exactly what I wanted. The wash instructions say “hand wash only”.  I ignored the instructions and ran it through my washer on the delicate cycle. (I always wash my “hand wash only” items in the washer on delicate.) The seams completely came apart. I never even got to wear it. So be warned, it really can’t go in the washer!!"
3.0,It is a pretty necklace but it has a very short chain!!
3.0,It'll do.
3.0,"Fabric was great, but way too small."
3.0,Besides being way too small- I ordered a large but they seemed more like a small— they aren’t very soft and the fabric is not nice to touch.
3.0,"It was smaller than expected, but served the purpose"
3.0,its ok but a little small
3.0,These are kind of short and I'm 5'3. They are thin and snag easily.
3.0,"Okay, so I thought the butterflies would be a little more 3d. It was cut small in the shoulders/bust..so, order a size up (I am usually a 10 us). I will have to return this to exchange sizing for a size up. It's cute but, not what I had expected."
3.0,"I like these boots.  They are comfortable and light on my feet.... HOWEVER, the color is much lighter than advertised.  For this reason, I'm giving them three stars.... VERY MISLEADING!"
3.0,This is a pretty shirt. nice fabric. Im on the fence wether to keep it or not.. because i have bigger breasts 34D and this shirt gaps on the armpit area.. I love the color.
3.0,The dress not what I expected but it is really cute
3.0,I have thyroid issues and i swear my feet are always cold. sense ordering these i do NOT reach for any other socks when im cold. these are a go to and warm my toes up in a matter of minutes. very warm and comfortable
3.0,"Note - these are not sized for adults unless VERY small head. The quality is good, just disappointing that I can only use 3 of the 6."
3.0,Needs an extra button at bottom otherwise good shirt
3.0,"No softness to these socks, very thin , not what I was looking for"
3.0,"Comfortable, fit as expected, athletic stretchy type material."
3.0,Came with 2 large pulls that someone had already cut and tied.  and the material was not the best quality. I will still use it but I don't think it will last long.
3.0,"I do not have a big bust line, but still felt uncomfortable with the fit.  It barely covers the sides in and the suit was a bit too big.  Very cute on the picuture, and the reviews seemed to help, just wasn't for me."
3.0,"Thin but for the price, pretty good"
3.0,"VERY SMALL. I myself am small, many wigs are too big for my head, but this hat is child sized. It's got poof but not as plump as the photo. Would be good as a gift to a kid, not good as a cosplay accessory. Will have to buy another hat"
3.0,Gifted it.  Was told the clock wasn't working.  Came on time.
3.0,Ok so I’m 5’5 and 140. I  accidentally ordered an extra small...yeah it was comical when I pulled them out the bag it look like they would fit a young child but just for kicks and giggles I tried them on. To my surprise they fit?  I mean my tail has no business in an extra small but I can I wear them around the house.They are not  squat-proof (but that could be due to wrong size)the only concern that I have is if I would’ve got a medium like I should have what they have been to big? The  material is very stretchy (obviously) and the design is cute.
3.0,The racheting system works well and the belt looks nice. I've had the belt about two weeks and the leather is beginning to show wear already. The outer layer is peeling off on the outside if the stitching. The only other issue would be the rachet system doesn't engage until after the tip of the belt has past the first notch. So I have to back track a bit to put it into that loop.
3.0,"These are very comfortable and fit well. My only complaint is that they have an odd smell even after washing. They smell sort of like petrol. I thought washing them would take care of it, but it did not. I wore one today and after taking it off, my skin had the strange smell. Would not buy again due to the smell."
3.0,Ok Product if you have a long Neck
3.0,"It's pretty, but runs small.  I ordered a size 7 to fit my middle finger but it was too small & a little big for my ring finger."
3.0,"This shirt fits sort of strange. Very large on top and narrow near the waist/hips. I usually wear a small, but really needed a medium. I don't want to have to go through the trouble of returning."
3.0,Pendant was fine but the chain broke on the 2nd day.
3.0,"The fabric is very light, it feels like wearing less than a swim trunks."
3.0,"Nice top, but fits somewhat small."
3.0,It arrives in pieces
3.0,Very scratchy and hard lace.
3.0,Although it’s very cute it’s made of a very lightweight metal.  I’ve been wearing mine for a few days and it hasn’t broken yet but it reminds me a little bit of the prizes we used to get from gum machines.  Not quite as bad but close.  It’s a fun piece but don’t expect quality.
3.0,"Loved this shirt in the picture. Fits ok. Gotta remember it's not American made or fit. taking that in consideration, material just feels different. Shoulder seam runs lower then shoulder. gives room to move.<br />Most likely won't buy again."
3.0,"May daughter has a long torso, so I should have purchased one size up."
3.0,"This seems to be more like 3/4"" and not as heavy as it looks in the picture."
3.0,Not my favorite. It was kind of sad and doesn't address the issue of bullying.
3.0,The pants were really cute however I thick & curvy with thick thighs...so even with shapewear they are not for us ladies who have thick thighs. Very cute pants though.
3.0,"I wore this on a trip to Great Wolf Lodge. It did cover me, but it was very tight in the chest area and was long enough to cover my thighs. I'm a big girl at 300 lbs and 5'9.."
3.0,"I purchased these for my classroom to make guided reading a little more fun. The kids love them! However, quite a few of them didn't work. Still a good purchase :)"
3.0,"Hey, they're cheap. Adjusters are not very rugged, several broke in airport handling (but of course that's unfair - cinder blocks would break in airport handling. They could be a little longer. If you don't put them in the hold of an airplane they'd probably be just fine."
3.0,"I thought I'd like this wallet, but it's too large for me, and I have large hands so that's sayign somethign.  The leather quality looked fine, but the size of the wallet was not appealing."
3.0,"It's perfectly fine but it's rather small, if your looking for a large pocket watch this isn't it, this is more like a necklace."
3.0,"Color is a bit darker than the stock band, and feels a bit cheaper, but that's what comes with the low price! I think 3-4 stars is about right for the product, as it does just what it says: replaces the stock."
3.0,In person these are less impressive than they look in the picture.  But they are alright if you arn't looking for something fancy.
3.0,"Folding is a neat idea but doesn't work practically, they were with me for a while and functional.  Just not practical, back to non folding"
3.0,Too small for an adult female. We had to give this one to one of the older kids.
3.0,it's nice and comfortable though it slips a little sometimes
3.0,"Bought this for my daughter for her bday, she loved it! It's pretty and comes in a nice box however the heart kept coming apart."
3.0,The bindings on the edge of the neck and armholes was poorly sewn. Also this item was larger than a normal medium.<br />I had to hem the pants by about 2 1/2”.
3.0,Size recommended for up to 16 y.o. would not have come close to fitting my average-build 11 year old grandson. Returned and purchased a different item. Amazon return process was trouble-free as usual.
3.0,I love the look but there’s already a thread pulling out. I have a feeling it’ll be a short run with this one. But it looks good!
3.0,Fits snugged
3.0,Nice hat but no elastic in the back of it so it falls off when the wind blows. The elastic would keep the hat in place.
3.0,Only feel the warmth  in back and not in front
3.0,Fairly nice. A little disappointed in the finish. Looks sort of plasticky and cheap.
3.0,The zipper failed on the first day.
3.0,"I bought this because of the trI colors, and mostly for the butterflies, which are bea and has crystals on them.  However,  I thought the bracelets would be tighter, and they don't keep their shape....looks more like costume jewelry, but I don't go any anywhere fancy, so I guess it's  okay.  It'd be a nice gift for a little girl for a gift.  They slip right over your wrist,  but if it's for a little girl, it might be a little loose.  I do wear them everyday,  even though it's only for the butterflies"
3.0,Material too Thin
3.0,"Like the watch  very much. However, the band broke fairly early in use. Difficult to find another band. The lamp light in the watch isn't very bright."
3.0,"I’ve never bought a bandanna that only had the design on one side.  Be advised they are a solid color on the back side and whatever was used to screen print the design on the fabric has a texture to it as well, which is annoying.  Three stars."
3.0,Within three days of using it one of the handles ripped off
3.0,Top is too big and bottoms are too tight and not lined.
3.0,"Somewhat smaller than I expected, but will hang on to it.."
3.0,I ordered a small and I’m 5’2 140 size 34DDD. But had to returned because skirt had a hole.
3.0,"I LOVE period underwear. After years of relying on tampons, I love the idea that I can use them just for my heaviest 1st/2nd day and then switch to period panties afterwards. I have other period panties — not from Thinx — that are like SERIOUS boy shorts so you're fully covered.<br /><br />These absorb quite well and I felt very comfortable wearing them, but I opted not to use them on my first day when I pulled them out of the package. While the crotch has plenty of padding like my other period panties, this one is a somewhat high cut brief IMO. The crotch area is very narrow and I was nervous about leaking on a heavy day since I'm used to the other undies that are literally full coverage boy shorts.<br /><br />But for medium to light days these are great and very comfortable. I will say, they're slightly less bulky than competitor brands. I would definitely try this brand again in a different cut — especially a boy short one where the crotch had more coverage."
3.0,"Not the best quality, but fun!"
3.0,"I think the material for this dress needs to be thicker - you can see the padding through it in the bust line.  It's very form fitting and sleek, but I feel like it's too see-through not to wear something underneath it, which is clearly not the intent."
3.0,The cufflink its very big and heavy. After a few times of use you get used to it but people will always comment about the size.
3.0,It was too big for me and too small for my husband. Not high quality but not as cheap as I expected it to be.
3.0,The jewel pieces I was expecting to fit on the bubble slide and when I tried to put the pieces on the wouldn’t fit I was highly disappointed
3.0,"The color is very light, not like the one shown in photo.<br />I would like to return it but cannot find the Amazon page for returns."
3.0,Its alright but not that helpful.
3.0,"The material is crisp and very lightweight. In addition to the intentionally see-through mesh parts, The entire top is pretty transparent and in sunlight will be totally see-through all over, for color 'faint lavender'. This top was cut and sewn significantly unevenly, you can particularly see it on my photo showing the bottom front hem, it really is listing to one side that much. The armholes are a bit overly large, which may be intentional.<br /><br />Size Medium is labeled on the garment as 6 and is 38"" at armpit level. The neck tag rips off very easily. I guess I will just use this top to workout at home in, given the various issues, but it's very breathable and comfortable."
3.0,The charcoal one is a lot lighter in person but other than that it's alright
3.0,"I wish it fit a little but more snug but thats not really the products fault. It smells bad when you get it, almost like chemicals. The smell never go's away and the ""nose"" looks crooked. I would recomend saving ur money and getting a real one but this is good for someone wanting to try it out and see if they like puppy play"
3.0,"Earrings look similar to the seller picture. The butterflies look exactly the same and are light - but the dangle parts are not twisted chain like shown. Instead the butterflies are attached to long, heavy rods. Weird looking for a jewelry piece, but not so bad overall."
3.0,"I like the print and colors, although the color aren’t as bold as advertised. It’s more sheer than the picture shows. The top has no lining at all so be prepared to wear a camisole. The skirt lining only goes to the knee. Overall I was moderately satisfied but the quality isn’t great."
3.0,Great for weekend loungewear.
3.0,"Man oh man. No tummy control. It's like putting a rubberband around your waist, yeah it's high waisted no doubt, but the elastic width is completely wrong, again. Gives you a pudge when you dont even have one, so if your looking to hide an existing pudge( lower belly tummy) dont get these."
3.0,"The dress was very nicely made, I gave three stars only because it didn't fit right in the neck area to be able to wear it off the shoulder as shown, other than that it's nice cool material and made well"
3.0,I'm 5'7 it is too long fabric seems hot but overall material is comfortable
3.0,Look great but they tore after just 3 days.
3.0,"Pros: This group of ties is a good selection. The colors and designs are a good modern style; not too basic and not flashy. The ties have a good texture and not a super cheap feeling. Cons: a couple of minor imperfections: loose threading, and wrinkles. All in all good buy."
3.0,Received my watch today after the 2 days of anticipation! Anxiously waiting to buy all the ones like this they sell... much to my surprise it looks like this... no where on this does it say “love” and I am not loving this!
3.0,"I ordered a Large, since I'm normally a pretty solid Medium and this seemed like the kind of dress that ran small.  Welp... The length was good for me. I'm 5 ft even, and it was just barely above the knee, which works, since I'm a little older (36). But the top... my God, the top. If you're a top heavy woman, just don't do it. I didn't want to give it too low of a rating, because it would probably have been super cute on a smaller busted woman. But if you regularly have issues with buttons or tops not having enough room, then you might just have to pass on this one. Too bad, because it's really pretty."
3.0,Not capri length but full length.
3.0,I needed this shirt for my surgery. The first night I used it the left snap broke.
3.0,"The sizing is definitely off. I got my husband the M (32-34) for Christmas and he is a 32. The ends touched but that was it. We ordered up a size which fit. Unfortunately returning the belt was not really an option. Although Prime, returning the item is not covered by the seller. The cost to ship it back to Portugal is $23 on a $30 product."
3.0,Bought as a gift. Hair barette was smaller than expected.
3.0,"I wish I could gave a 3 and a half star rating but here's my honest opinion of this watch.<br /><br />To start this is probably one of the most comfortable watches I've ever owned especially for a metal band and it is a cool bar story when you say it's from reclaimed German beer barrels.<br />The watch is incredibly accurate but the chrono buttons feel cheap when you press them but that's the only thing I didn't like the feel of.<br />Now the real down side, the back band looks like it went through a blender and then someone took a belt sander to it but the rest of the watch looks great, it also took way longer then expected to be mailed even to the point it told me ""your package may be lost in mailing"" but I don't blame the watch manufacturer for the U.S. postal taking forever. I do still recommend this watch but I really hope I just got a bad."
3.0,Decent quality necklace but the TARDIS is is much larger than I thought it would be.
3.0,It's completely see through??? It's not that way in the picture. Other than that it's fine though
3.0,"very pretty and just as picttured, but can only give it 3stars because it was extremely difficult to take up the links to fit a smaller wrist."
3.0,Received tons of compliments on these. Love them. I've had them a few months and the nose guard is starting to
3.0,"The stitching is ok, the sizing is ok, but if I wear a bra with it, the tops of it show, and I just don't feel comfortable NOT wearing a bra. Plus the extra fabric on the breasts I found to be a bit awkward, it rolls up a little and has a line under. It's an ok shirt for the price though and not bad with a strapless bra."
3.0,I thought this was loose fitting. It’s much more of a bodycon.
3.0,They are tight around the ankle area. And they are a Little short. Feel like the are sliding down when they are not
3.0,"The design of the dress was nice, but the material felt like a cheap table cloth..."
3.0,This necklace is cute for the price so I can't complain but it does have a black spot on the white upper left wing. It's the size of the little dots on the gold part. It'll do though. Other than that it's cute. I ordered it for an Xmas gift so I haven't personally wore it so can't tell the quality.
3.0,"Not bad, but the plastic is a little flimsy.  It tears apart fairly quickly."
3.0,These are extremely cute.  But you must order one size up.
3.0,purple ish.  I Like the pattern but unhappy it looks different than photo!
3.0,I’m usually a large but these are way too tight.
3.0,"very thin, see through"
3.0,Im a 38D and this fits only because the back is all stretch material but it basically fits like a very cute sports bra (also smooshes the girls alot flatter) and only makes it to my ribs. If you want it to fit like in the pics i would recomend it for someone with a petite/slim frame for a comfortable fit. It is also fairly sheer. But yes the top opening is huge.
3.0,"First off, for $18 it’s well made. The lace is nice and I felt like it was decent quality. To wear this dress you’ll need to be able to go braless. I’ll update with pics when I get the chance. Not for people with a large chest. I cant wear this in public"
3.0,All the socks looked to be the same size just different patterns however they did not all fit the same. Half the socks were extremely tight banned with no elastic movement in them and very difficult to put on.
3.0,Skirt material is OK lovely zipper unfortunately product is so large I can slip it on without using the zipper.
3.0,"Great quality for the price. However, the lenses are flat and a bit warped looking so looking through them distorts things a bit. I personally don't like the look of the flat lenses, but if you do then you'll love these glasses😊"
3.0,"Nice quality band and easy to install onto watch face - shipped very fast.  My reason for less than 5 stars, which I see as a design flaw, is that there is a sharp metal piece that sticks up from the clasp on the band.  It causes it to pinch and scratch the skin while wearing the watch (unless you put a slip of paper or cloth between the clasp and your wrist.  Not sure if each band has this flaw, but it was on mine (pics attached)."
3.0,Really wish the product description said not to use on 24k Gold like the warning that comes with the product does.
3.0,the insoles of the boots came apart fairly early into owning it
3.0,Gave as a gift.  It's a novelty and pleased my son that way.  He said that he has some ideas of where he might wear it.
3.0,"The fit is fine, but the fabric keeps shedding."
3.0,It looks nice but the material is a bit thin and the purple pictured is much darker than the actual color
3.0,"The fit is for the short and fat among us, aka very boxy."
3.0,Was too big for my finger and I ordered the correct size. I’ll say it runs big. Also it easily gets caught on everything.
3.0,"I ordered the correct size, per the seller’s measurement chart. Was a bit big...but totally LONG<br />Ok, I’m short...5’4” (when I’m stretching the truth😉). This is past my knees and looks frumpy with leggings.<br />Would be ok as a dress<br />Print is pretty, hangs well and looks nice, very comfy"
3.0,"This is not a one size fits all sweater as advertised.  I wear an 18 or 2x.  The sleeves are so tight they can actually cut into your arms and cut off the circulation.  The sweater comes up short on my but I am 5'9.  This sweater type is for an extremely slender, small framed individual.  If you are a curvy women, close to my size this sweater is not meant for us!"
3.0,I purchased 3 of these at 3 separate times and all 3 came with a dead battery.
3.0,There nice earrings for the price u get what u paid for by now u should know $12 does not get you so many but they are not stainless steel they are fake the rusty colored ones turned green & the silver turned black... I don't recommend if u have sensitive skin
3.0,These were bigger than I thought they would be. Too big for me but my daughter likes them so....some of the stones were crooked though. but overall these are ok. Shipping was kinda slow.
3.0,Doesn't fit like a dress
3.0,These definitely were a little large and do not breathe at all. I live in a very hot city and thought I was going to die while running in these.
3.0,Definitely baby size wrists.
3.0,"Well made, I just wish the straps were longer so I could carry comfortably on my shoulder."
3.0,"I got this in XL which is what i wear in other clothes. sometimes i wear Large. this XL was not nearly as oversized as depicted in photo. in fact the red on fit much more tightly than the black and was a totally different size. i might order the black on in a size larger, but i wont be ordering the red wine as it is not even close to a red wine color its more of a bright red orange  or like a red/orange poppy"
3.0,"good rings very pretty, but not good quality after wearing them for a few days the shine wore off and they made my finger green."
3.0,"Nice scarf and beanie, but made and shipped from China, not Australia."
3.0,I liked it other than it definitely runs a size small
3.0,Very cute shorts. I was concerned the zipper wouldn’t hold up as it got stuck numerous times
3.0,"Glasses were very inexpensive and are the right strength; however, the lens are somewhat large.  I would have preferred a a smaller lens but at least they work well for reading."
3.0,One was broken when I rec'd the package. Wound suggest better quality control.
3.0,Tighter and smaller then expected.
3.0,They are gorgeous just one problem was that one came broken but could be fixed.
3.0,"I got this dress for a friend's daughter's birthday and everyone absolutely loved it! The only problem was that the little girl just turned 6 and wears a normal size 5/6 or 6/7 in US clothes, but this size 8 of this brand was still slightly too small. Unfortunately I will be sending it back because it will barely be a tunic on her. Again, super cute and very well made, but it's just too small."
3.0,"it looks like the picture it think the top might be a little small, but for the most part it was ok. The whole suit is what it shows its not cheap fabric which is nice."
3.0,It's a very cute dress but the material is extremely thin and see through. The sleeves on the dress make it so adorable. I would recommend wearing a long camisole or anything to not show your lady bits. I would also probably size down. I got a large and it looks like a mumu on me. but overall very cute dress.
3.0,Prevention of heart attack.
3.0,"Fit a little on the small side, but ok."
3.0,"Overall:<br />Sweater feels nice on my skin,and is a great weight to layer or transition from spring to fall and back. hits at the hips and does not go past them. Oversized in the body.<br /><br />Fit:<br />I have broad shoulders so a large would have been ideal, but i didnt want it to hang off my shoulders so I opted for a medium.<br />Which fit like a regular sweater with a stretched out neck. All of these components made if feel odd on me so I sent it back.<br /><br />three stars just based on personal preference."
3.0,Not a fan of these pants. Every time I stand up after sitting I have to push the leg down.
3.0,This book I feel is very stright to the point.
3.0,"Didn't look the same as the picture, at the time of my purchase. The hat fits really small."
3.0,Bought it for my 10 yo granddaughter. We knew it would be big but didn’t think the material would be so “stiff” and light weight.<br />The imaging on it was good but not at all what we expected.
3.0,Falling apart already just very cheap looking
3.0,It's ok but does run small..  I'm a petite but it was a bit hard to get it to slide open enough to get onto my wrist.  Looks OK but it isn't silver.... and I knew that when I bought it
3.0,"Only wore this twice, and the zipper has already come off the track you can tell it’s very cheaply made. If you’re going to wear it open totally worth it super cute and warm but if you needed to close might want to try some thing else."
3.0,Very mediocre hat.
3.0,"Although I love the look and the size, it is difficult to slide things in.  A smoother surface for the interior would be helpful."
3.0,It’s sexy but super thin
3.0,Not sure if it’s Authentic.<br />Could be a copy.
3.0,I bought for my grandson. He wears a size 13 and I bought the little boy 13.5-1 size and they were too small. I will need to size up from that. Other than that they seem okay. They are very cute.
3.0,Beautiful but one of the earrings was broken..
3.0,"I was really long, but not a bad shirt at all. Somewhat cheap material"
3.0,"The dress is nice, but it runs large and the material is a bit silky"
3.0,"These are way too short for my personal preference. But I think the materials and the make of them aren’t bad. For your info, these are about the same length as your regular boxer underwear..."
3.0,Nice shoes but runs big
3.0,waist too low.
3.0,The Carolina Hurricanes one isn't as picture. It just has &#34;Hurricanes&#34; across the chest and reindeer instead of pigs. The sizing is also a bit strange. The chest was about right the arms and body are meant for someone much larger. I'll most likely keep it but I wouldn't say I'm happy with it.
3.0,"It's plastic. Cute, but cheap plastic."
3.0,"I purchased these so my daughter would have something to get in and out of the pool with especially for really hot days, so as not to burn her feet on the pool deck. She never actually wore them inside the pool...not sure she grabbed the concept of being able to swim with them on. I gave three stars because the toe area where the fabric meets the rubber sole was showing signs of wear after the 1st day of use."
3.0,Runs small.<br />It is good quality
3.0,This seem to be way to loose. I needed some that the band was tighter.
3.0,"I feel a lot safer when running at dusk or dawn with this vest.  However, sizing runs HUGE.  I am 6-foot, 180 pounds and this thing is huge."
3.0,I’m between sizes right now so I sized up deliberately and these still run small for me. The waist is nowhere near what I’d call high waisted (I’m 5’7” and have short legs for my height). The band sits right along the top of my hipbones making these pretty uncomfortable for anything more than lounging in. The stitching is not good quality either. There are better quality workout pants on amazon.<br />The side pockets on these are super deep which is a plus if you have a larger phone.
3.0,tight in the chest and then very flowy in the skirted section.  I returned it.  The fabric also wasn't very breathable so it wouldn't be a great summer dress.
3.0,They tend to break easily.
3.0,More like a pajamas shirt. Wasn't expecting this.
3.0,"I’m bottom heavy- thicker in the thighs. I’m 5’1 (and a half) and weigh about 130. I ordered an extra small, since I have another pair of black 90 degree leggings and they’re slimming and fit in the waist (even if I have to smush my thighs in there, at least they don’t fall down)<br />The grey color just wasn’t flattering on me, it showed cellulite and didn’t help slim down my thighs.<br />I may try going up a size- the worry then is that it wouldn’t fit as well in the stomach and waist and the lighter colors would still show flaws.<br />If you don’t have my body/insecurities these are great leggings (especially the darker colors)"
3.0,"These are well made and come in a variety of colors. Unfortunately it is way too tight for my comfort, so I cannot use them."
3.0,Hoodie isn’t for a tall guy.  It’s too short I’m 6.2’ I would recommend a size or two larger as it really shrinks in dryer also
3.0,"For the most part, it is pretty but there are some blurry spots on the printing. There’s also a couple missing little pieces here and there. I can’t say if I would buy again, but it was good enough to keep it. Maybe other ones would be better!"
3.0,i had bought these for work temporarily and i couldn't wear them because they are too narrow and hurt the toes
3.0,"I got this because the price is right.  However, I was hoping for something more durable, or at least better crafting.  This plate frame just had stickers applied.  I sprayed it with several coats of clear spray paint in an effort to make the stickers last a little longer.  Buy an embossed frame it will almost certainly last longer than this will."
3.0,"I like the dress,but the jacket was to small"
3.0,"Bottoms fit as expected of XL but although top was labeled as XL it fit like a medium, much smaller than expected. Shorter sleeves and shorter body length."
3.0,"It's not exactly what I wanted but it will do. I wanted just the collar bar but after reading up on one I found that you need to buy the shirts with the holes already sewn into the collars, which to my understanding are not only expensive but hard to find as well. The article recommended a collar pin like this instead."
3.0,cheap material -- great color
3.0,It is very thin and small than I expected. Other than that it is a fine piece.
3.0,"The legs were way to small and the butt was really big, I will be returning theses."
3.0,"Overall, I'm happy with the watch considering how much I paid for it. With that being said, I would never pay the $89.99 it is advertised at. The band looks and feels cheap and the watch looks better in the photos. Definitely better than the average watch you might get at a regular retail store, but not something I would go out of my way to recommend."
3.0,They were tiny and I thought for some reason they'd be larger.
3.0,Great quality but very big I got the 6-12 month and it's more like 12+ month I'll probably keep it for when she's bigger but definitely won't fit for awhile
3.0,"Likes: beautiful bookbag, received lots of compliments,  good storage space<br />Dislikes: too heavy for my 3rd grader, straps faded some in 2 months of wear, zipper for one of the pockets came aparr."
3.0,"I generally love this line of jewelry, but these earrings are not up to their usual quality level. The post and backs are clearly stamped S925, but the smaller stones are just glued into their setting and just don’t sparkle. These earrings are just okay."
3.0,"This is a nice little sweatshirt, soft, like a sweatshirt.  However, the arms are way too big and not the length just the wideness in the arms.  The length of the sweatshirt was fine.  The embroidery was good, no missed stitches or hanging ones."
3.0,"Socks are a good quality but are not ""no show"" socks. They are not the socks to wear for Bobs or Toms slide ons. If you are a size 11, I'd pass, they slide off eaily due to how much they need to be stretched ot fit"
3.0,The apron was shipped quickly and I received it but I was a little disappointed but the quality. I think it's very thin and seems stiff to wear.
3.0,"These masks are not made for women or people with small to average size faces. When the mask is unfolded it covers my entire face. I mean it covers from the middle of my forehead down to the bottom of my chin and I am an adult female with an average size face. Other than its enormous size, it's a well made mask. The print itself is blurred in some places though. I like the adjustable ear loops."
3.0,Lots if glare on the inside of the lenses. Returned with zero issues. Ultra dark lenses are a plus.
3.0,irregular size...always buy 24months but in this time it was huge
3.0,"The tail hangs lifelessly, unlike any monkey I have seen.  It worked, but wasn't amazing.  If the tail was curled upward it would get more stars."
3.0,I've been wearing style A in silver for 2 months and the finish is not holding up. I thought this band was stainless steel but the copper coloring showing through proves it's not. I do like the style and the comfort of the band. I just wish the silver coloring had lasted longer.<br />UPDATE- Bayite's customer service is awesome- they explained my band had missed a step in the finish process and offered to replace my band or give me a full refund including shipping with no questions asked and no return required! I absolutely recommend buying from this company.
3.0,Cute sweater but too small. I'm 5'7 and 150 lbs. the xl was too snug for me. The material doesn't seem like it would be very warm.
3.0,"Straight from the packaging, one of the Velcro pieces was coming off already. It's not very comfortable, just will use it as a back up."
3.0,Way to big got XL felt like double XL
3.0,"The shoes are beautiful and stylish, but they do run on the narrow side. If you have wider feet, I'd steer clear of these."
3.0,The soles came out right away before even wearing. A bit hard to get them on as they need to be a tight fit but a velcro strap would work better.
3.0,Me gusto mucho el color...no me gustó q son exageradamente alargadas
3.0,Got this for my wife and it is not as long as what it looks like in the picture.
3.0,They fit great for about the first hour.  They stretched out and have become sloppy fitting.  Wouldn't buy again.
3.0,The dress was to Little could get in it
3.0,The outfit was nice but too short. I measured it with other outfits of that size and found it should have been 2 inches longer.
3.0,"I love the short sleeve material in the brand, so I expected the same with the long sleeve.  Totally different.  These are a bit thicker, heavy material with a restricted stretch.  While they fit in my usual size, they weren’t comfortable because the material hugged my arms and shoulders like a sausage casing.  A size larger would be way to big in the body and length, as these are already flowy in that area."
3.0,Ring part that the clasp hooks into was missing. I purchased one from the craft store for a few dollars. Thinner than I expected but I will wear it.
3.0,I enjoyed it.
3.0,"Wife loves the gloves, button on one was poorly attached and fell off. Don't recommend."
3.0,cute dress but fit extremely small
3.0,DOA
3.0,"I was excited to get this Captain America shield since it is versatile as it can be used for cosplay or as a display piece. My initial impression of the shield was that it was very lightweight, which made it feel rather cheap. I expected the shield to have some heft to it but that is a minor quibble. The size is also a little smaller than the actual Captain America shield. While I don't know the exact measurements of the movie shield, this is definitely a tad undersized. The red is also too bright in my opinion. I would say this is more comic book accurate than movie accurate.<br /><br />The paint application in general is rather sloppy as there is overspray between the different colors. This definitely looks like a mass produced factory product rather than something that has proper quality control. The straps on the inside are also rather loose. They have limited adjustment, and I am not able to get a good, firm grip on the shield. It just dangles from my forearm since the straps aren't tight enough. There is a hook on the back in case one wants to hang it on the wall. But it is a little off-center and as a result, the star looks lopsided when it is hung. Again, a result of poor quality control. When this was first offered on amazon, it was fairly priced at $50. But now it is has increased to over $60. In my opinion, if one is looking for a movie accurate shield, spend a little more and get a better replica than this."
3.0,I love this suit.. buy 1 size up 3 star because I had to see it on someone else!
3.0,"A bit small, and definitely shorter than I expected"
3.0,"Took a full 4 weeks to arrive, and it's small. The fabric is interesting - kind of shinny and athletic rather than the cotton it looks like."
3.0,To small for the size
3.0,"For the price it's just ok, the material is super stretchy so I wish I would have bought a M instead of a L. I'm 5'6&#34; and 160lbs, and it &#34;fits&#34; but if I lose any weight I think it might be too baggy.  Overall I think quality wise it's overpriced. But it's a super sexy dress and I guess what do I expect for buying it without seeing it/trying it on. I gave it 3 stars because the material isn't the best and somewhat thin."
3.0,"These work fairly well, but the hole in the top is a little too large and allows some coffee spit-back around the edges of the pin hole.. Also, for some reason the closure arm on my Keurig will not completely close when using them. That is not really a big problem, but is annoying. Be prepared to use a layer of thin aluminum foil between the disk and the k-cup; that makes a better seal. Using these disks allows you to reuse an empty k-cup at least twice. There is a video on YouTube that illustrates how to use them."
3.0,Great shape and fit but the polarized coating is easily scratched.
3.0,"Serves purpose, but It will tarnish and scratch. I’ll put nail polish to protect it. Disappointed"
3.0,I am giving this bathing suit a 3 star review because it runs way too small. I have a 13 month old (23 lbs.) and I ordered a size 18 month so we can use it this summer. It looks like it’s a size for a 12month old. I am disappointed the seller does not provide an an option to exchange for the correct size. I now have to pay to return this. Quality seems good and is really cute.
3.0,The product I received was way too small but thankfully I was able to give it away and the person loved the product. If you want a nice comfortable slipper then I'd definitely suggest this and just hope the you get the right size.
3.0,Bracelet does not bend around your arm where you can see the snap on button. Snap is one the side of the arm
3.0,"The quality and color of this wallet was good.  I mistakenly ordered it, not remembering that it has plastic card holders, which I don't prefer."
3.0,"Son loved them for his Halloween costume but the first time he put them in, we saw hole in ine of the gloves.  He wore Anyway as it was part of his costume."
3.0,The color looks more red online but it is orange
3.0,I really wanted to love this dress but I will be retuning it. It's very comfy and very cute but on me the skirt makes it unflattering on my body. I'm 5'2&#34; and a size small so I think it's just my height as the skirt has a lot of fabric and flares out a bit and comes down to my knees. I thought about hemming it but think it's just going to be a return. Very soft and nice touch with the pockets though.
3.0,"I<br />The hat is OK as far as quality, but  bought the hat for the logo on the front. Logo  in photo is large and appears to be nice.  The hat arrived I was immediately dissappointed. The logo is nothing but a tiny, and I mean, tiny iron on sticker. It was meant to be a gift, but it just does not make the cut."
3.0,The curve where the earrings should sit comfortably in the ear were a bit too thick. That area should be reduced so that it does not cause discomfort to the user.
3.0,I like the way the dress fit it's a little bit big around the bra area and it seems like the material has faded a little bit on the shoulders
3.0,Kinda cheap looking. Price was fair.
3.0,Color is a bit faded so not that good of an imprint
3.0,I will use the cover it looks good...I just had thought there was some bling on it and it is very two tone just the gold and white...
3.0,"The product came as it was described. It struggles to keep time by a few minutes, but you can't beat the price if you're just looking for a wind up pocket watch."
3.0,Had to return. Size xxl was too small. I’m 234lbs
3.0,Nice hat. Disappointed a 2x fit so tight. Had to pay shipping on the return as well.
3.0,Skirt fits as the size indicates. The skirt flares out more than expected. When I wear it I feel like I am in the 50s. Maybe a grease movie. Just need to put my hair in a ponytail and a bow. :) Not a big fan of the material as it is polyester and is a stiffer fabric than I am used to. I am short as well (5'2&#34;) so the skirt ends mid calf and with the flare it makes me look shorter.
3.0,"I'm 5'3, 130lbs, DD breasts. This dress was cute, but fit me kinda weird. I would say to stick with your size, or maybe even size down? I purchased a small. I ended up returning it even though I like it, it just didn't look great on me."
3.0,"It arrived quickly<br />Super cute just like the photo<br />But it was very flimsy the base, I actually had to glue again so it would not lean<br />You get what you pay for"
3.0,"Dress is beautiful, however it came in the wrong shade! I ordered purple and received burgundy ☹️ Still a nice dress but I ordered the specific for my wedding celebration and was certainly bummed when it came in the wrong shade"
3.0,"The sizing very very small, the over all garment nice quality!"
3.0,"The color in real earrings is so light as in not purple color, it's almost as very light purple. Close to white."
3.0,I got this dress around the summer. I really like it. The only thing bother me is the color was start fading after the first time I washed it. I had worn this for couple months now and it’s look like and old cloth due to the faded color . I probably going to throw it away. Summer is so short i was hoping I could at least wear this next summer too but i guess I probably not going to wear it.
3.0,"The color selection is wonderful, which is one of the main reasons I made this purchase.  The glasses are fairly well constructed.  My only complaint is the fact that the lenses scratch very easily.  I had had them barely a week when the scratches became so bad that I had trouble seeing through the lenses.  If you purchase these, just remember to always put them in their case."
3.0,it is too rough around the toes.  Others I have had in the past covered the thong much better and did not use cloth.
3.0,"I absolutely love these slippers!  They are so cute and relatively comfortable.  Definitely, 5 stars there and that's why I didn't return them!<br /><br />Why the 3 stars?!  They smell awful.  Bad chemical smell!  I could smell it even before I opened the Amazon package, then it was just awful when I opened the plastic bag that the slippers came in.  I left them by the front door to air out for over two weeks and there's still about 20% of the smell left.  Now I put them by the window and hope it will get rid of most of it.<br /><br />Another minus is the part of the slipper where my feet stand on although comfy, they feel like there's just a piece of cardboard underneath."
3.0,"The shirt shrunk ALOT after the first wash. Other then that, it is a very sure outfit"
3.0,"Thin, but not cheap feeling, and very comfortable. I would prefer a thicker sock for my athletic shoes, so I will not order more of these."
3.0,"Good idea in theory, but plastic too thick<br />Going to try on grand kids because I found others that are perfection"
3.0,not as good as what i purchased
3.0,Good fit pretty well made stich job up center is a little off but other than that it’s great
3.0,"I love that the material is thicker, but the waist runs smaller than the reviews lead on. I matched up to the size chart, but it cuts into me. I wish I had tried it on as soon as it got in so I could return for refund."
3.0,Nice color and fit. Fabric isn’t as soft as I was hoping and return window is closed. Feels like a cotton tshirt instead of the smooth fabric I wanted.
3.0,"They are very pretty, but they come smaller size"
3.0,La tapa cierra muy fuerte
3.0,So soft and warm. Love It! However. It did not have a nose. I'd rate it 5 stars if it had a nose. Otherwise adorable 😍<br />.<br />Edit: Overtime I have realized that the no nose thing bugs me -1 star
3.0,Very thin and too big had a DENT!
3.0,These irritated my ears very quickly
3.0,They are a little big and the color is much darker than pictured. The back of the earing also does not fit the earring at all and<br />falls right off.  A little frustrating!  They are still pretty but I’m disapointed.
3.0,Lovely bag. But the chain popped the same day I used it.
3.0,My boobs just can't fill the cups so I guess I'd say that this bra runs large.
3.0,"I ordered a small and I am usually between 4-6, it is a little large and especially in the underarm area.  Very cute dress and design but I wish there was an XS option."
3.0,"The shirt is super soft which is nice. I was hoping it wasn’t an iron on, but unfortunately it is and not the greatest quality. There are bubbles in the print and the “Dutton” part isn’t even laid onto the shirt evenly (Pictured). I have a cricut at home and could have done it cheaper and better myself. I wouldn’t buy again or recommend but I’ll be keeping it since I got it on sale for $13 and it’s not worth the hassle of returning. However, if you have a cricut at home, just do it yourself."
3.0,"the stone looks much smaller in person, although it is a very beautiful ring, the stone seems bigger in the picture, a little deceiving"
3.0,A little small.  Purchased for my 5 year old. .fits ok this winter. .but will be to small next year.
3.0,"it got the job done with my costume, it look good from far away but then look closely you see the hot glue left overs."
3.0,Thinny made...
3.0,"maybe these socks are fine for running or something like that, but they don’t do well on a long plane flight; used them on trans-atlantic flight and they were like any regular socks, not helpful"
3.0,Very happy with the look and design.
3.0,This case is so big and bulky! From the picture on the website it didn't look so large but it serves the purpose.
3.0,Size runs smaller and the length was much shorter than advertised.
3.0,"I returned this swimsuit because it was ill-fitting.<br /><br />I'm 36C/34D, usually a Medium in tops and size 8 in pants (M in yoga pants and workout gear). I ordered this suit in an XL. While the bottom was a good fit, the top was super loose. There's no significant elastic band at the bottom of the top so it was almost like a semi-tight crop top. Plus, there are no cups or double-layered material sewn into the top, so coupled with the looseness of the fabric, my ta-tas would be all over the place! One tiny wave or jumping into the pool at the top is off.<br /><br />The pattern was cute and the blue bottoms were a great color. But it would've needed probably a M or L in the top for this to work."
3.0,"They are warm and very comfy<br />I would not recommend this as workout bottoms, they are see-through"
3.0,Fits weird at bust
3.0,"Fit is good, but the fabric between toes is uncomfortable."
3.0,Not good quality... Was faded when I got it
3.0,The packaging is clever but they give u this tiny bottle of whatever that does okay cleaning.  I put the container in my makeup bag for an over night trip and came back empty.  Must not have been tight enough.  I think I’ll put gin in it from now on to clean my ring.
3.0,Love these...I have bought them I’m several colors!
3.0,"Case works great on the terms of being waterproof and if of good quality but...... it makes the finger print scanner useless even though it has a slot for it.  Wish that part worked because I love the case, will be returning though."
3.0,"I bought this dress to wear to a friend's baby shower. I am 6 months pregnant and wear a 12/14 pre-pregnancy. This dress is extremely thin and I will definitely need to wear a tank or something under it to prevent my bra from showing (no matter if it's while or nude it will show). If I had ordered a darker color it may have been different. The cut of the dress is somewhat flattering. I should probably have ordered a size smaller as the &#34;waist&#34; of this one sits further below the top of my ribs than I would like. This will make a great dress (with an under shirt) for my own baby shower in a couple of months I think, but it just won't work for the intended reason I purchased."
3.0,The dangle beads fell off within a week but the others on the band are still pretty.
3.0,"Despite it reading plural ""Mits"", I personally only received one. It's a short fabric that keeps them from slipping through the fingers, I just wish it came with a pair like it implies"
3.0,THE SHIRT FITS FIHE AND THE FABRIC IS SOFT AND WASHED WELL<br />I JUST THOUGHT THAT THE DECAL LOOKED CHEAP AS OPPOSED TO 2 OTHER SHIRTS I PURCHASED It has no glitter or decorative trimming just the pressed picture..<br />It is fine as a workout topper to go shopping during the holidays but you couldn't wear it to a more festive occasion.
3.0,"Cute earrings, the tear drop metal has a few imperfections from the mold, just where they didn’t clean it off. They look great on and they weren’t too heavy."
3.0,This sweater had a great cut but the pattern of the knit didn’t exactly look like the picture. It fit as expected so order your size. I returned but only because upon receiving it looked to similar to something I already owned.
3.0,"It’s fun, but will fall apart after a couple of weeks"
3.0,"The material is nice and soft, but I ordered a small and it was way too large. I’m 5’4 and the dress went pretty far past my feet and just looked way too big. I returned it."
3.0,the y could have done better photo placement.
3.0,Nice sandal. comfortable
3.0,Nicely made ... but for a tiny head. Did not fit my granddaughter who is 3.
3.0,Fits fine. soft. Only concern is how does one clean it? Wash with gentle soap and water? It is the right size if you are &#34;small&#34;(Size B).
3.0,"This bra is really cute and pulling it to the side to nurse is really convenient. However, if you're above a C cup you probably shouldn't buy this bra. I'm a 36DD and it definitely doesn't provide enough support. I bought it for sleeping so its not a big deal for me but if you want to wear it out and you're large chested it might not work well."
3.0,Great shoes.  Bummer there is no way to wash them due to the lights.  They got filthy the first time.
3.0,great dress but sizing has always been my issue
3.0,"This dress is BEAUTIFUL! perfect for Fall because of the colors, the neckline, so pretty but wayy wayyy too small. my daughter is a size 12 and I bought her a size 14 so that she could wear it well next year. The size 14 literally fits like a 10 if not smaller. So bummed!"
3.0,"This dress looks essentially like the photos on Amazon but in person reads much frumpier. I ordered a S and feel it runs large - granted I'm very small (5'2&#34;, 105#) but I'm similar in size to the models often used by these Chinese fashion brands so I expected the dress to fit better. It is slightly sheer, but I was expecting to need to wear a camisole under it. The button placket is faux and does not actually unbutton, so the neckline cannot go any lower.  I would call it a mother-of-the-bride dress for a casual beach wedding. Most problematically, however, I was expecting something that felt like natural fibers and what I received is almost certainly mostly synthetic. It's a nice dress and the quality is fine, but it's not for me."
3.0,nice skirt.  runs small.  ordered a 2x and it fits more like a large.
3.0,"GORGEOUS DRESS but the sizing is so far off. I ordered an XL even thought the sizing chart said that I would have room to spare, but I did this because the reviews said it ran small. Well there is no way this will fit. I am sad and disappointed. I will need to return it and order a new one. Even if the chart says your size please order up at least one size. The dress is so pretty, it is a shame there is this issue."
3.0,Bought for my preteen granddaughter per her request for a Christmas gift. I had to rework two of the butterflies. They were attached backwards. With a pair of needlenose pliers  I was able to remove and replace them correctly.
3.0,"Love the look of the bracelet however, after just one day the screw stripped. Very disappointing!"
3.0,The blouse runs very small I normally wear a large but I bought the XL and I couldn’t even get it on it was so small I even checked the package thinking they mail me wrong size but it was an XL
3.0,"Pretty, but small.  Will not fit much more than my wallet."
3.0,These are super lightweight and the quality doesn’t feel good.
3.0,"Poor quality, broke after the first wear."
3.0,These shorts ride rather low and if you bend over its plumber's bum show.
3.0,Not really solid black theres brown also which make it look like old leather
3.0,Love the shoe but one shoe stopped squeaking hours after wearing for the first time.
3.0,"Not easy to use, lost pieces immediately, uncomfortable after a few hours, but it does do the job. I wouldn’t but them again unless I had to and had no other option."
3.0,OK but a little uncofortabe
3.0,"Ordered 3 colors, the green (beautiful color), royal blue (also beautiful color) and coral.  Coral came red.  Not sure if this is an error in warehouse, or if it is a really, really bad description.  Normally a small should work for me, but it clung to my body more than I prefer, so I would go up to a medium. I also do not think i would be comfortable for this to be a dress, however, it would be just fine with leggings or cropped leggings.<br /><br />The photo I attached is of the &#34;coral&#34; I was sent (still see it as a red) and a Coral of another brand on top of it. As you can see, large difference...."
3.0,This ring was too large for a child.  The earrings are cheap quality and hurt my daughter’s ears.
3.0,The pendant itself is really nice and seems sturdy enough but the keychain part broke within  5 minutes of just putting it on my purse for a decoration. If you plan on buying one for a gift maybe get a nice chain for it.
3.0,I ordered an xl for a looser look I’m about a size 8 and 5’7 and it fits everywhere but in length! Detailing not as accurate as the picture and had a weird smell out of package.
3.0,"These were okay. They are thick enough to where they are not see through, especially the grey. They are also comfortable. The quality of stitching could be a bit better. There is already a hole in the grey ones. Easy enough to sew up. Overall for the price they are pretty good."
3.0,"You get what you paid for, got them for $11 obviously look better on picture. They fit well, lens aren't bad"
3.0,so small. better suited for a child.
3.0,"Thin, material feels cheap."
3.0,Not crazy about the fabric looks kind of cheap. But I will try it and see.
3.0,Cute dress but a lil snug for an XL.  I usually wear a L sometimes a M.  This dress runs small but very cute.
3.0,"I had higher expectations. The bag is really simple, it doesn't have compartments, one small bag in the front and one on the sides. The size is perfect for 9 year old."
3.0,"Ordered the tan, the color is darker more of a a lovely cognac. The material looks and feels to be a bit of a higher quality than expected. Wire exists around the brim of the hat which allows for molding the hat to a desired shape. It was shipped folded into quarters and creases remain that the brim wire has no effect on. Worn in the garden with the wide brim offering ample shade to the neck and face would suffice. Reluctant to wear in public due to the persistent existence of creases. Will pack exceptionally well for a casual beach trip."
3.0,"Good quality and fits well. It may have been a fluke, but the built-in bra didn't fit my curvy wife. She said it was ""bunchy"""
3.0,"The foam on them are super cheap. But if you only wear them for memorial day and the 4th of July, these suckers will get the job done."
3.0,"The grey area looks much darker in person. It's a mirror instead of grey as shown in the picture, so the entire watch just looks mostly black from a distance."
3.0,Beautiful dress but way too small in the breast area so I had to return it.
3.0,"The bracelet is very pretty and the colors are very soft, but......the only problem is it's suppose to be a small and it falls off my hand I have to keep pushing it up so<br />Not too lose it.  If your hand is bigger than a size 7 then it will fit u perfectly!"
3.0,"I was sent the wrong color choice. The bags I received are bright orange and red-ish. I did get them earlier than expected. And the bags themselves are ok.  They are well made. However the fabric was not as expected, it can't be used to clean the glasses. But they do work to protect my glasses and are large enough to fit sunglasses."
3.0,Very good fabric but it is too large for nomal wear
3.0,The belt doesn't help much. I've had it for a few months and it is already becoming worn out from the Velcro.
3.0,"Very nice quality soft t shirt, cute design. Wish the design was less iron on like. Very thick design."
3.0,Pros: Been wearing them 24/7 since I got them with very few hair snags. They are cute and I get compliments.<br />Cons: I couldn't get some of them unscrewed even with tools. The biggest ones are kind of gawdy but I'm wearing them anyways because I couldn't unscrew a diff pair :(
3.0,"The bands work well, tho maybe a little hard to change out. The silver & black are perfect, but the one that is supposed to be rose gold (which is the color of my watch face and the one I was really wanting) turned a really yucky dull color after wearing it just a couple times. It’s now between a copper and gold color and does not match the face cover-which is very much pink- at all. I am very cautious to not get it wet, and I use the silicone band if I’m working in the yard or will be sweating. I only wear these bands for work or nice wear."
3.0,"I bought these for my husband as new gym shorts. I looked at the waist measurements, and order accordingly. We ended up returning the large and ordering an extra large. He typically wears a 36 waist, and the large was too small. We also returned the first set because white was absolutely see through. The second pair fits much better and the darker colors will work nicely!"
3.0,"Has a weird seam down the front. Sides stick out really far. Stretchy, bizarre fabric. But when it is on it does look nice."
3.0,"Nice looking scarfs, however they feel more like polyester than silk, too hot."
3.0,Great wallet put the screws are all falling out.
3.0,so I'm 5'8 110lbs ordered a small and the sleeves are no where near long enough. If I wear the shirt it will have to be with the sleeves pulled up all the time. It was also to short and if i try to tuck it into a pair of dress pants then when i lean over it pulls out from the back side immediately. I'll wear it ever so often to small occasions when I'm not in it long but other than that it's not really a decent fitting work shirt.
3.0,"Ok fit, they roll down and fit is not as good as the ones with pockets but ok overall"
3.0,These are the type of sunglasses you get if you want something to protect your eyes but really do not care if you use them.  They are plastic and really not durable.
3.0,Very cute elegant
3.0,"Love the socks but the color is more of a yellowish tone, which I hate since I bought these to match a few pair of cream/tan colored pants that I have. They don't match even a little which is a big disappointment."
3.0,Meh I ended up turning them over and facing out the backside. Not a huge fan
3.0,Cool design… shirt material is not your typical t-shirt cotton
3.0,"I love the style of the coat, but it runs 2 sizes small. I am a large at most stores, like GAP and Banana Republic, I ordered a XXL, because I wanted to wear sweaters under it, and I can barley button in. Still haven't decided if I am keeping."
3.0,Pretty. Looks just like the picture but the one size fits all means 160 lbs and less.
3.0,It’s looks soooooooo cheap like a grade c factory product.don’t hole a lot thing with this hat lol.  The quality like this just for fun costume not for use.
3.0,"The ""Red"" version sure looked like ""Fez red"" to me.  It's more like ""high school pep rally red"".  Everything about the shirt is nice--fit, stitching, timeliness of order--just a word of caution for anyone looking to match this with their fez."
3.0,Positive: Fits my face well<br />Negatives: Does not come with case as was in the description when purchased. Arrived already with two scratches on the lenses.
3.0,I own a pair of similar sleeves made by Buckwild; the Buckwild sleeves are a little more expensive - $16 vs $10 - but are much higher quality and well worth the extra money.
3.0,It's beautiful and looks much more expensive but it's black and light taupe.
3.0,Sizes run small by about .5
3.0,"This dress would've been perfect, except the gathers were unflattering.  If you have ""generous"" hips, the gathers greatly exaggerate them :-(  Otherwise, the fabric is light and comfortable, but not saggy or see-through.  Wish it could have worked for me."
3.0,"My son loved them, but the fabric is low quality. I don't see them lasting long unfortunately. :-( The neck is already stretched out from wearing them twice/washing once."
3.0,"This necklace is cute but kind of chintzy. Its a bit smaller than I thought it would be and looks like I paid $10 bucks for it. It’s really only a novelty gift, my MIL won’t be able to wear it."
3.0,"I wear a women's 9-1/2 so I purchased L/XL as recommended.  They're a little big and go almost over my knee.  I wore them yesterday and the excess material rolled around my knee and cut off my circulation. They feel like just about any other compression sock I've purchased, maybe with less compression.  I don't know what the ""copper"" is supposed to do, nothing special for me."
3.0,Sleeves not as bellish as shown color a bit off...
3.0,"They fit larger then expected.  I wear large knee braces, knee pads and in most other pants.<br />These swim on me as a large<br />Not bad quality"
3.0,"This is a decent enough dress, though it looks kinda frumpy on me. I like the length, though it's a bit longer than I expected, and I love the print. The fabric has a nice feel to it, though it feels a bit synthetic for something labeled as 95% cotton/5% spandex. The fabric is suitably opaque enough, and the neckline high enough, that you shouldn't need to wear a cami or a slip underneath.<br /><br />The problems I have with it are in two areas. One, the elastic waist rides up every time you lift an arm above bust level. I was tugging the waist down all day. Two, the way the pockets are set, they tend to dump contents while you're sitting down. Not terribly convenient if you tend to carry things in them. It's a shame, because they're nice and large, able to hold my iPhone 7 Plus without a problem.<br /><br />I probably wouldn't wear this to go anywhere, but it's decent enough to wear around the house. It's not so bad as to be worth the hassle of returning. I just have to be careful what I do when I'm wearing it so the waist doesn't rise and the pockets don't dump."
3.0,"item is as described, I was just disappointed with the size"
3.0,"I like a lot of things about this backpack: the price, the light weight, the abundance of compartments.<br />But the material is weak.<br />As you can see in the photo, this is what happened after carrying my laptop in it for a few years (not every day). I wish there was a backpack that advertised reinforced corners right there where the hole is."
3.0,"It does looks great, but 3rd time using it and started to falling apart. I really loved it at first."
3.0,It's a pretty scarf but not nearly as full as it looks in the photo. It is very narrow in reality.  I'm going to keep it because the lace is pretty but really wish it would've looked as it did in the photos.
3.0,"This dress was really pretty, especially the lace at the top. The sleeves end right at the fattest part of the arm (cap sleeve, I think), and it was really tight. If we sleeves were different, I would like this dress. It wasn't very flattering for that reason only, and I sent it back."
3.0,Size are so confusing...i bought 4/5T but wayyyy too small ..my toddler just turn 3 it fits like a 1/2 yrs.T:(just refunded
3.0,This was a lovely color and fabric.  Would have liked the sleeves a tad longer.  I would have kept it if it hadn't been SO tight.  I ordered my usual size.
3.0,It’s so thin that you can see through it<br />It is comfortable to wear though
3.0,Cute design but the leather is very thin and I would not trust it to hold.
3.0,"This dress is ok for the money, but beware, there is no orange/coral.. Very pink. Otherwise ok."
3.0,"These seem totally decent and sturdy. I think the sides are a little floppy. They bend out and flex to avoid the enthusiastic toddler from breaking em but this also makes them not stay on very well. I would be annoyed with adult size versions doing the same on my head.<br /><br />So my 3 YO doesn't really have the time of day for these, unfortunately."
3.0,"50% of the arm sleeves (the prints) matched what was advertised in the picture lightweight cool fabric very nice .  The other half shipped were NOT In picture. (The solids were just cuffs, without  thumb holes.  Different fabric too.  I’ll keep them, but the picture should show what is being ordered."
3.0,"Came in and looks just like the photo. It’s soft and love the color. However, it’s too big! I’m a normal average woman and it’s stop loose for my face. I’ll have to add a stitch to make it work. But pretty disappointed 😞"
3.0,"This is very cute and fits well but it had a mark going down that looked like something snagged the material that was probly 14"" long I did not have time to return this for I needed it for a Christmas party but it did make me look like I was wearing something old"
3.0,Fit pretty much how I'd hoped. Doesn't breath very well. Consequently it tends to get a bit moist inside. Hard to eat with it on. Could only get a hotdog to fit through the slit. Smells a bit funny inside. Kinda fishy. Seems like a vinegar solution cleans it well.
3.0,3 the same snake arrived broken. Nice assortment though. Made cute necklaces for my Slytherin friends.
3.0,It nice but should be a little bigger
3.0,Not as pretty as I had hoped but will wear it
3.0,The shirt is nice but poor quality. The stitching is bad and material is not quite up to par.
3.0,"This is a very cute and nice sweater.  It smells horrible - like cat pee.  It was also packaged with a bag of lemon tea, which to me is very odd.  I have to wash this and hopeful it doesn't fall apart."
3.0,Right color but I guess I didn't read size chart right. The were too small. Too bad I had to send back.
3.0,WAYYYYYYY to short!
3.0,"The dress was nice but the issue I had is that the color was not nearly as dark as the red in the picture and even though I purchased this dress before in a different color, the fabric of this one was more corse and a touch flimsy. It wasn’t bad, I just was disappointed that it wasn’t the same as my last dress in feel. But it’s not bad - pockets are nice and the length is good."
3.0,Great if you dont have breasts
3.0,"The bracelets felt sturdy and looked pretty and shiny.  I didn't feel anything wearing it. After a week, the color rubbed off.  Its's a nice looking bracelet but it didn't enhance any health benefits."
3.0,"Comfortable & easy to wash tank top.  Soft to touch.  Color and sizing is appropriate.  Needs ironing after washing item, as it gets easily wrinkled."
3.0,For XL these just don’t work for plus size women...and I really can’t see them fitting large men calf’s either. Disappointed
3.0,They are cool but not even close to the picture.
3.0,"Fits ok but the high arch area made them too painful to wear. Was going to return but lost the package in my car til it was too late, so will wear them with socks around the house in the winter time."
3.0,"The fabric felt very cheap, which was expected, but it still didn't lay quite as nicely as I was hoping. Not very forgiving unless you have a flat tummy. All in all I think my torso was too short for this. i am 5'2 and 135 lbs with a small chest and carry my curves in my hips. I think I can salvage by using the pieces separately! The top will fit even small chested women like myself pretty well."
3.0,"Love these pants, but do NOT love this seller’s sizing guidelines bc they’re grossly inaccurate! These are HUGE on me. Yes, size charts are meant to be a guide, but the measurements given should at least be close to the actual size of the product - theirs is so far off that I can’t even wear these around the house bc they’re falling off of me. Or tripping me. The words “dangerous” and “sweatpants” should never be used in the same sentence! I don’t understand why, when it comes to sizing, you get two conflicting size descriptions: ‘true to size, order your your regular size’ (which for me would’ve been a L), yet their size chart gives measurement ranges that aren’t even close to what would be accurate for a L. Most companies note somewhere in their item description that their sizes aren’t the same as Amazon’s sizes, so if there’s a chart provided, I’m gonna go by that, therefore I got the XXL. Sigh. They’re really nice, the material has the feel of poly or nylon spandex camisoles - they look like cotton in the pics, so that was surprising, but not necessarily in a bad way. I love the color as well, it’s a deep red as opposed to a bright red. Really disappointing!"
3.0,One of the buns started coming loose after very little use.
3.0,Good dress. My suggested size based on my weight and height was a large but it’s a little too large on the torso and slightly brighter than I expected but it looks good and will work for what I need it for.
3.0,"It was too tight, cute but too small."
3.0,I don't like how the edge rolls up and interferes with the way I wear my reading glasses low on my nose. It also slips off my nose too easily.
3.0,The battery died within two weeks of delivery so it must have been an old one.  The<br />watch did look like the picture
3.0,a little too light weight for my taste.
3.0,"Cute watch, but really small.. if you don’t have a tiny wrist it will not fit you."
3.0,"cute, but order 2 sizes larger then you would normally.  Runs very small"
3.0,Definetly not made for smaller frames! I am 5'2&#34; and 85lbs and this is too large on me :/ I will have to do some cutting and sewing in order to make this item fit me unfortunately.
3.0,"I'm 5'4, 135 lbs, 32a/34b cup, about 40&#34; around my butt.  The bottom was too small, the top was too large, but I only really needed it for the bottom to match a top I have. I can pull it off for the price, but doesn't look great.  Made for women with large B or small C cup, and about a 35&#34; butt."
3.0,Runs small for adult hands. Needed baby powder to get them on. Better choice for middle school age kids.
3.0,The back is leather.... the front looks like cracked paper glued to the top... also it smells really bad.
3.0,"It's really cute but it's bigger than I hoped it be it also has a pretty long chain and it flips around a lot,the jems look like they are about to fall out but since they are not I guess it is a pretty cool necklace"
3.0,"I would say for an average sized person, these run a bit snug on the legs and butt. I would order a size up."
3.0,Tight in the shoulders
3.0,Fair product. Weak durability. Not as strong as expected and socks pulls down to ankle.
3.0,"I really enjoyed using this wallet.  It had the features I desired and yet a smaller size to fit in my small to midsize purse. However, unfortunately it has not lasted.  The edge has totally split open!  Very disappointed in the poor quality. Never had this happen before! This wallet lasted almost 9 months.  Don't waste your money!"
3.0,"Fits a bit small, but great color and design overall!"
3.0,"I ordered an XXL & received an XL - which looks like a Large. The quality is there & I think this would be a great product. Since the XL looks so small, I will not be ordering the XXL. I am not huge, I normally wear a size L t-shirt but I wanted this to fit like an XL on me."
3.0,Belt is a bit flimsy and the eyelets are not pressed neatly on the reverse side. It tends to catch on fabric making it just a little difficult to put through the pant loops for the first time in the morning or when taking it off at the end of the day. Other than that it looks neat when worn and is a good product.
3.0,"Very cute but size up. I have a very small waist but long torso, was way too small."
3.0,This runs extremely small!  Material is nice though and would look great if I could get it on!
3.0,Granddaughter not very pleased on Christmas Day
3.0,"The product image color is more of a light gold/nude color, which I wanted. In person, it is a very yellow gold.  It's also covered in glitter that comes off a bit on your hand. Overall, for under $20, I think it'll do."
3.0,If you are a typical size 4 or smaller (and definitely  if you are petite) the small will be too big on you. I ended up giving to my friend who is a size 6
3.0,"The arms are perfectly sized for a medium. However the rest of the hoodie hangs quite low. If I size down, then the sleeves will be far too small."
3.0,It was very pretty until I saw that there was a peice of the jewerly was missing im not sending it back because it wasnt worth getting another one.....
3.0,the chain broke almost immediatly but other than that it is beautiful even though the color it a bit lighter
3.0,Nice jacket I just wish the zipper was on the correct side must’ve been made overseas somewhere because it’s actually on the opposite side that US men’s clothing is
3.0,No structure. Not at all as pictured.  Cheap materials.  Most suitable for a nightgown. At least 2 sizes under stated dimensions.
3.0,Didn't fit like the Apple hats....
3.0,"this dress is completely see through you must wear shorts or your gems will show. the design is very cute the material just isn't the best, and this may be because I got the yellow one."
3.0,"Well made, however too small and I'm pretty petite 😒"
3.0,"Breathable, but absolutely no stretch or give in material"
3.0,This runs small so be prepared for that.
3.0,I like it but the black bands were not on it.
3.0,"These hoodies are great for the price.  They are my go-to hoodie, I've owned about 6 of these over the past few years.  they fit me comfortably.  The zipper &#34;handle&#34; thing breaks off of them easily, and on a couple pairs, the stitching in the pocket began to unravel.  But for the price, that is a very slight problem.  I just replace them."
3.0,I whore it once and it snapped very bad product do not buy
3.0,It's a analog 4 dollar watch. Good enough.
3.0,Wasn't really what my niece was expecting
3.0,"not a good fit, not as expected from picture when ordered"
3.0,"This dress was really cute, but I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing it out. The material is pretty sheer for the fit I'd expect/want, and I don't own a slip or Spanx that are short enough to go with it. I returned it."
3.0,Runs quite big. I Ordered a small like others suggested. That worked out perfect. Usually wear a medium.
3.0,Super comfy and great material but does run very small
3.0,I’m 5”5 so size down
3.0,I had to glue these together myself.  The stars were not put on permanently​ and so you have to glue them yourself
3.0,"I ordered this expecting to receive a shirt that was similar in color to the photo. This was not the case, as I received a shirt that was pine green in color. The XXL fit like a U.S. L, and the shirt is very comfortable, but it isn't foliage green."
3.0,"Be forewarned that a size large is a 14/16 and very large. There was no size chart when I ordered and need the dress for tomorrow so I’ll make it work, but under other circumstances, I’d have returned it for a smaller dress."
3.0,"I loved the reviews and idea. I am 5'8 and 198 so I ordered an XL. I usually order a L or XL. I received it and tried it on and immediately heard some popping as it stretched. Once I got it fully pulled up, it was cute but very tight around the waist."
3.0,Great hat but could fit a bit better
3.0,The leg is much shorter than it looks in the picture.
3.0,Was a little disappointed but will adjust side slits up a bit to fit.
3.0,"Product seems quality. Highly irritated that this is sold as a single piece, but all pictures show a pair. It is my fault for overlooking this detail, but I’m not happy."
3.0,"Looks great in the pic but when I put it on, felt like it wasn’t for me. I was looking for a bridesmaid dress for my sisters wedding and it didn’t seem quite right for the occasion"
3.0,Not bad for a cheap shirt but it is a slimer fit than expected and the collar buttons needed re-enforcing after the initial first wash.
3.0,I am 5'4&#34; 150 lbs 38-40D I ordered a large. I like the dress but the chest was too tight and flattened out my chest which was not pretty so I returned it.
3.0,The lenses are darker than expected. Frame a lot wide. Still cool trying another pair soon
3.0,"This fits really tight. Definitely buy 2 sizes larger. I didn't like the very round collar. The collar looks more of a female fit. The graphics was cool, and the material was stretchy and thin, but felt good."
3.0,"The waist is tight as many have said, so I bought one size larger<br />and it fits better, but still a little tight.<br />The percentage of cashmere is low. My estimate of the total<br />cashmere and wool is less than 20%.<br />It has a feel and look of mostly polyester."
3.0,"Very pretty, much smaller than expected.  The CZ didn't have as much sparkle as I would have liked to see.  Good value for a person with very small lobes or a child."
3.0,The loop that holds on the extra part of the band doesn't stay in place at all.
3.0,Mi size is large but  this time  look's like is medium  not enough room for equipment
3.0,"For the price, it does what it says it’ll do. It’s. definitely not as good as the leather magnet watch band by Apple, but it is a lot cheaper. It also holds ok for everyday use, but I wouldn’t recommend for active people as the magnets aren’t that strong and it could come loose."
3.0,Material is very thin and flimsy. Design is nice.
3.0,Was somewhat small
3.0,This top runs small and after one wear gave it to a friend.  It wasn't comfortable and didn't find that it provided much support for 34DD.  Size up!
3.0,"Returned, too small. It was going to be used for a costume, but their measurements and mine were not compatible :)  It was pretty though."
3.0,"I actually love this shirt, but it got two holes after being worn four times. I never used dryer, but I did use the washer on gentle. the first hole was under the zipper the second on the side. I have small breasts and it is loose on me, so the holes are not from being too stretched. But I can see how these holes would be huge if it was stretched."
3.0,Too wide and then too narrow by the toes.  I returned them.
3.0,Obviously I don't know measurements well. 2mm us extremely small and I looked like I was wearing earrings for a baby! Not thrilled.
3.0,"The product is great quality! However, a little disappointed that it did not come with the blue gem on the dress as pictured, since we specifically purchased for a Princess Peach costume."
3.0,I could have been happy if only...<br />The good: Solid feel. 45mm is large but I'm used to big watches. 16.5mm thick is very thick but it looks like quality. Good lume and once charged up it really glows.<br />The bad: The watch looked like someone had already purchased it and returned it. The plastic protectors looked like they were peeled off and stuck back on. The watch band had light scuffs. The band had already been sized and the loose link was rattling around in the watch box. There was a torn paper tag in the watch box. The bezel chapter ring did not line up like it should. 16.5mm is very thick.<br />If they are going to sell a returned watch as new I think they should refurb and repackage it first. Make sure everything is right before the watch ships out.
3.0,"Pro: great product, well made, clean<br />Con: waaaay too small."
3.0,It did not look like the picture and it was huge for a small.
3.0,"nice bracelet but somewhat narrow, I am returning........."
3.0,"I would have liked if it had been a little less stiff. It would be nice to be able to pull it out after the braid is finished, because unless you have really thick hair, you can see it."
3.0,They don’t fit as the do in the picture. The pant legs are shorter than I expected. But still really comfortable
3.0,"They are nice and thick good gage, the color on them peels off so not a good thing to use on a fresh piercing. The silver and oil colored ones don’t peel though and are great I love my silver one! Studs are nice but I don’t like the surveys much but that’s my personal preference, overall they are good"
3.0,The Size runs very small. This is not a true plus size by any means. The 1x is at best the size of a XL
3.0,"It's super heavy and is not very slouchy, it's much too tight for it. Just not what I expected and won't be buying again."
3.0,Nice thin wallet fits the american bills nicely.  The zipper is a little rough so be careful. The color is a little off from my screen. In person the orange is lighter.
3.0,The leather is nice and fits like it says by measurements but the bell is rather cheap. Like dollar store cheap.
3.0,"A little big, but very cute😊"
3.0,"good size for your car, or large bag/purse. i wanted to get a yellow umbrella (HIMYM) when my rainbow one snapped on me when PA got the rest of hurricane Florence. i will be shopping around for a much larger umbrella but this will do for now."
3.0,"The jacket runs small.  My daughter is a regular size 8 in kids.  I ordered a ten expecting to get a couple of seasons wear out of it... it fits like a 7/8. Also not the best quality... one of the tabs to hold the sleeve fell apart before my daughter even wore the jacket,  and the zippers do not glide smoothly.  The pockets are also super small.  I doubt my daughter could keep her hands warm without gloves."
3.0,These look really nice and appear to be made really well. The only problem is that I'm not sure how to actually put them on. Do I bend them? My ear lobes aren't a 1/32 inch thin and I'm worried about bending them open and closed a bunch of times to put them on or off. I don't want to break them... so I haven't worn them. I've never had earrings like these so I'm really not sure. They are really pretty though!
3.0,"This are very tiny, are more like for kids"
3.0,Can’t say how it will work until I have to find out… hopefully I won’t need to…
3.0,Felt great when I first put it on but when I sat down it rolled up and kept rolling up. Will wear to do yard work but not for every day. If you are thin and smaller busted this would probably work for you. It is very soft and comfortable and wish it had worked for me.
3.0,"I'm 5'10"" and I typically wear a 4. This dress fit great in a small but was way too short, like 6 inches off the floor."
3.0,I was excited for this but my daughter never wore it. The material is really uncomfortable for her skin
3.0,Rises a little high. Expected lower cut.
3.0,The material is ok but overall I found this to be just average. It's ok for the price but I didn't love it. It's convenient though.
3.0,It was working great but then I started getting errors and it kept doing a high pitch beep and wouldn’t read anything... I let it sit for a couple of days and it works again but I’m worried it will stop working...
3.0,Nice shirt. Sleeves a little too short
3.0,Very nice.Not quite the quality of the original Invicta band but pretty close.
3.0,"They were really cute but baggy, and I haven't worn them to the gym because they seem more fashion wear not actual lift in it gymwear."
3.0,"Nice overall size of the face on my wrist, but the band is snug"
3.0,I read the reviews to order a size up so I ordered a medium - usually a small- and it’s just a bit too big on me. I’m 5’3” 120lbs. Should have ordered a small!
3.0,i have fairly small ankles and these socks are too tight around the top seam that make them uncomfortable to wear. the cotton is not soft but the material isn’t too rough to wear.
3.0,"They do fit well over my glasses.  They could be slightly darker,  I still get a bit of starburst at night even with these glasses on."
3.0,"Fit a little small. Good quality, would purchase again."
3.0,It matches my shirt.  But made for someone wry skinny
3.0,It looks like a nice jacket but the Front pockets were stitched closed. You should not have to rip the pockets open to use. I wish that the jacket has a warm whining. It fit will.  It does look like a quality fake leather. It did not smell.
3.0,"I am 5'2"" and the pants were too long. The fabric laid over the cuffs at the bottom unless I pulled the waste up to my chest. Lol Sadly sending them back."
3.0,Weird fit legs are cut wrong
3.0,"This is comfortable just a tad tighter than I was expecting, but then again they are not supposed to be loose."
3.0,"Yes, granted, I'm 6'2&#34; tall and have an accordingly large head, but this size definitely does NOT fit all.<br /><br />Apart from that, it seems to be nicely presentable in person (as in the picture).  I expected a pith helmet to be a bit stiffer than this one is, but that doesn't bother me — esp. for the price."
3.0,I like it but the bottom hem line is not as generous as this photo shows
3.0,It is a little tight around the hip area. Very flimsy not made very nicely.
3.0,The color isn't as expected and the fit is a bit larger then the size chart gives. I ordered the red and it's more of a maroon.
3.0,This belt is rather on the cheap order I sort of figured it would be for the price. It's still kind of cute but don't expect good quality. I will probably wear it sometime but I don't think it will hold up for long and It runs pretty small.
3.0,I had an incredibly difficult time finding waterproof gloves for my toddlers.  That you make and sell them was awesome.  However the fit is so poor they won't stay on.  I think the sizing is a bit large. My 18m old is big for his age (90th percentile) but the 1 year old size gloves just would not stay on.  Your gloves fill a gaping hole in the kid's snow gear department but have room for improvement.
3.0,"The cape and mask are great. Stickers are a great add on. The wristband is not as advertised. It doesn't have just the Superman logo, has weird text 'FunHall'... Had to toss before wrapping set as it was a gift for someone else."
3.0,too small in chest area and the quality was not as I expected
3.0,"Bought these and the brown color. These fit small, and the other color fit perfect. Otherwise I'd give them 5 stars. They are the best flip flops I have ever owned. Just wish they fit as good as the others. My original pair I have had for close to 10 years and still hold up."
3.0,"The picture looks really pretty, but in real life the stone looks cheesy."
3.0,"I love the look of this bag. I received it for Christmas and was very excited as I have a similar bag that is functional but less stylish. I particularly wanted front pockets which are very useful for traveling (water bottle, phone, etc).<br /><br />But, it isn't quite what I hoped for.<br /><br />Pros: front pockets (see cons), hook for keys, over-the-shoulder strap included, stylish<br /><br />Cons: the zipper is BAD. A magnet closing would have been great but the way the zipper is set in the bag makes it get in the way when unzipped (too hard to explain but trust me). Unfortunately the way it is designed, I do not think you can remove the zipper and replace it. I was excited that it had a closure, but ugh. IN THE WAY.<br /><br />Pockets could be a tad larger. In my other, I could fit a small tablet. I cannot with this and a larger water bottle is a stretch.<br /><br />The lining is awful. Slick, scratchy, cheap looking and feeling. While only you can see it, you won't like it.<br /><br />Due to the nature of the bag it is floppy so if you sit it on something it will not stand up. A bit more structure in the bottom would have been great but this is not a deal breaker."
3.0,"This was a very cheaply made product and not as described in it's listing.  I would not recommend it for anyone, it is not usable.  Just keep swimming..."
3.0,Looks like a bathrobe
3.0,"I have used these cami's before in a smaller size and wanted few more for my toddler. The color shown in the picture is not what actually sent. I wanted colored cami's and not whites. My toddler usually makes a mess of those so I thought they would fit the bill. However, when I received the package it had different colors including whites. I still kept the package. Like the previous set, these cami's are holding up well even after few washes. No fading, shrinking or stretching. I would recommend if you are not picky about colors."
3.0,Cheap quality<br />Not what I expected
3.0,Had to send back because they were designed  too large and arms too long
3.0,A braid fell off a bit after receiving but it's pretty good looking.
3.0,"After reading all the reviews, I ordered a size bigger than what I wear. It was too big. I suggest ordering your true size. The item is very pretty but color is a bit duller than the picture. Overall<br />It is a very pretty dres/top."
3.0,Fits alright but stretched out after wearing a few times...
3.0,Really cute! And well made. I’m 5’11” and ordered a size bigger than I normally wear. It still needed to be longer from the shoulder to the crotch.
3.0,"Nice cheap shirt that perfectly completed my costume. Arrived early. Fit is a little off, large in chest area but what can you expect when paying this price!?"
3.0,"Case fits nicely and looks like it would offer great protection, but I got the Carved Cedar and it looked like dull laminate, not real wood."
3.0,"Small, quality not that great"
3.0,"The bottoms were great, nice support for my c-section shelf, nice height, didnt make my booty look long and weird...but the top?? Is this a headband? My tatas are average at best, 32d, breastfed 2 kids so you know how that goes lol the top was scandalous and I hated that it's not adjustable. My nips were showing standing still. I returned."
3.0,"Ordered a small, fit more like an x-small.  I typically wear a small in this brand. I am 110 lbs, 5'5"", 34A for reference. Beautiful color!"
3.0,"Well ... it's not red. It's more rust. It's not a vibrant red like the picture AT ALL. That was a huge disappointment. I wish now that I bought the brown.<br /><br />But, it fit as expected, the fabric was nicer quality than I thought it would be and it's cute. I just can't get past a dress being called red, shown as red but not red.<br /><br />Shipping was fast,  though."
3.0,My daughter was so excited to get these shoes. Except they were really big on the front of the shoe and have no support. I was so disappointed with these shoes. They are packaged really cute though.
3.0,"The recommendation was to order two sizes bigger. I am Large, and ordered 2XL, following the recommendation. It's so big I have to fold them at the waist. Also, because it is 2XL, it's too long and the detail on the legs gets lost."
3.0,"These are great mittens, very warm and keep you dry.  However, the button already fell off of one of the mittens:("
3.0,"I'm 5'7"" I weigh 145 lbs. My calves are slightly larger than average, but not huge.  These are too tight around my calves. They're not comfortable. I suppose it keeps them from falling down, but I've had ones that don't fall down that aren't so tight. These are like support hose."
3.0,"This blouse could be so pretty if it wasn't cut in a way that makes it look like a pregnancy garment.  The ruffled front above the breast line bulges out and makes for a shapeless look, not at all flattering for full figured women.  I am so disappointed because I had so looked forward to this.  The neckline is also cut so wide that the bra straps keep showing."
3.0,not Impressed with this. my 4 year old really wanted one. there is tubing that runs in the hat around the edges for the air to go in and it just makes the hat hard to get in and fit.
3.0,Very pretty but color rubs off and it breaks easily
3.0,I got compliments on the dress and it is a pretty dress if u like RED. I am not fond of the color but the wine color is acceptable. But the dress I received was red not wine.
3.0,Smaller then a true XXL shirt
3.0,It was difficult getting the necklaces fastened then it broke taking it off. Love the concept
3.0,"Nice, attractive. But be aware, they look like beads, but the back is hollowed out. Fortunately you can't really see it while wearing them."
3.0,"They worked ok at first even though they were a bit tight, then after I used them a few times, the fabric got very thin in places so I would not buy them again."
3.0,Cute cute but they did drag my earlobes down a bit and they kept falling out. I’ll need to put some rubber backs on next time
3.0,It's really pretty for the price but the latch doesn't hold extremely tight and the pin is held onto the brooch really well but is very wobbly when not latched.
3.0,"I gave it a 3 🌟 BECAUSE  Im still trying to figure out why its a 3in1, when its more like a 2in1.  There's only two jackets.  Exactly like the photo.  Marketing is miskeading.  The outer jacket is really thin.  The color is bright, but my 8yr old didn't seem to mind.  It kept it because it worked for her, she can remove the second layer or wear both depending on how cold the weather is."
3.0,"This pullover runs somewhat small, and the pockets were made for children's hands.  Quality was somewhat inferior, but for the price it was ok.  Wouldn't necessarily recommend this."
3.0,This would have<br /> Been a favorite. The romper and color is really nice. The issue is that the material wrinkles terribly!!
3.0,"I love Travelambo wallets, this one was a quick inexpensive wallet, a great value for the money!  I've been looking for this type of wallet and thought I'd start here.<br /><br />Pros:.<br />Inexpensive<br />Well made<br />Durable<br />Slim<br /><br />Cons:<br />No push slot for credit cards or pull tab which means getting a card out can become a process.<br /><br />Overall a great purchase or gift option!"
3.0,"Lovely print, does not fade after several washes. Fit my daughter's 7 years old well, only complain is that for the price they can sell more than 2."
3.0,Mine had a stain on it and it was permanent
3.0,Super cute! My daughter loves them!
3.0,I like the belt but it miss the green luggage tag.  It not came with the belt
3.0,"Cute but ran huge.  I can still wear this to work, but will need to take it in.  The fabric looks nice but is a bit thin and too stretchy."
3.0,Beautiful dress but it did not flatter my curvy body shape (5’8 /160 pounds) enough to wear out in public. Dress felt very ridged and where the bodice was cut made me look even chubbier.<br /><br />Just used once it to cosplay with my Frenchie and that’s it.
3.0,Had to return because the size was smaller than expected.
3.0,somewhat big but warm!!
3.0,"Overall good quality. Material thinner than expected. Successfully used smart phone with them on. Too small, so gave away as a gift. Wrist barely covered."
3.0,"Article runs small, barely any yellow in it. It’s really has blue, black and off white stripes."
3.0,"works well, a bit loose."
3.0,"I have to use this as a shirt to tie up, this was no way anything like the pic or other reviews. I was planning on wearing this to a concert, but I am going to cut up the shirt and make it work with some shorts instead, the collar was not one sided and was not a baggy look, I am going to order again a bigger size because I really like the black and smart, I ordered the lip 'dress', I am not giving it one star because it will work as a shirt at this point"
3.0,I thought they where dangling earrings.  They are solid and seem a little heavy.  I was disappointed. But a great value for 14K.
3.0,Kinda smallish
3.0,I looked at this but did not purchase it. I wouldn't mind trying it.
3.0,"I don’t care at all for the smell of the garment and still stinks after washing it. Also it fit good, was comfy & liked the design. Yes the armpit holes are huge but I wound wear on a bike as a first layer cause it would totally blow off me. Purchase again?? Don’t know!!"
3.0,Think these are going back. They came in a very nice box with a storage bag. I wish they put more money into the actual padding.
3.0,it is a nice dress however it doesnt fit as expected (a bit lose). I will wear as a maternity dress :-)
3.0,Is a bit to small but she likes it
3.0,"Love the fit, but the leopard print is totally different than what is pictured on the listing! Not really a fan of the ones they sent. Looks nothing like the photo. I did order them in red and another solid color and those are fine though."
3.0,Very disappointed in the quality of the shirt. Honestly it looks like a Home Econ 101 school project. 😞
3.0,it ok nice
3.0,"Looks good. Fits well. The zipper is a problem, hope it lasts long. Also I wish I had paid for the price it is now."
3.0,"I have the black bag with a shiny outer pocket, with a band at the top.<br /><br />I like the main outer material it is a matted sturdy suede look.  I like the idea of outer pocket and the big inside. I like the inside zippered pocket into the lining and the two side pockets in the lining.<br /><br />Here’s what doesn’t work for me:<br />• The outer pocket is a shiny cheap looking vinyl<br />• The snap for the outer pocket is a weak magnet and it doesn’t line up properly, so it’s not easy to close<br />• The main compartment zipper is sewn too far down, so there a 90 degree turn, it's difficult to zip<br />• The zipper placement limits the size of what you can put in the purse.<br />• The outer bottom seams on the front pocket are sewn in a messy way.<br /><br />It came with a nice heavy-duty sturdy plastic bag with drawstrings for storage.  However, the pocketbook must be folded over to fit inside and even then, the drawstrings can’t be pulled together. Maybe it wasn’t meant to be a storage for the bag?  It’s transparent with the exception of the bag’s logo 7x4 logo onit.  There was no small removable pouch that came with it."
3.0,The way these go together is very annoying. I make watch bands out of beads and trying to hold this to screw in the tiny screws is pretty difficult. Would not buy again solely on for that reason.
3.0,The description says lens 60mm however I got a 66mm wasnt to happy about that other than that its authentic.
3.0,"Im 5'6"", 155lb.  Bought a Large.  Its short and wide.  Like really wide in the shoulder area.  Yes it is drop shoulder, but this was like excessive.  And its made a weird material.  Sizing up would have only made the shoulder problem worse, and sizing down might have fixed the shoulder problem, however, it would have then been to short through.  Could have been made better."
3.0,"Very cute! But very stiff.. they were too rigid to walk comfortably in for my four-year-old.. Unfortunately, returning them."
3.0,I brought the size that I usually get but the dress size was smaller than what I thought it would be. Was really disappointed because I loved the color and style. Wished they carried it in a larger size.
3.0,It is just a pillow cover and the picture is not really bright - but it was only $4 or $5 - so I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,"Its a bit larger than the size but very good quality<br />But just wished it was only Our Lady of Guadalupe and the flowers on the cloak, and not Juan Diego<br />For it to be the real Juan Diego costume"
3.0,"Size 4T fit my  36lb , 3.5 ft 4 year old perfectly, only probably is that it is more of an orange color instead of red."
3.0,"If I eat a cheeseburger this thing will pop off. It is a very short chain, barely fit on my wrist. It's cute but yikes."
3.0,Its very nice.....smaller then what I expected.  Did realize it was a Choker.....Very Nice
3.0,Does not look real at all!
3.0,The white band only had one hook in it.
3.0,The “waist” that fits right under the breasts is a bit small - I suggest ordering one size larger else it’s a tight squeeze!
3.0,Other then the arms being so tight I really liked it. Just can't wear it🤷🏻‍♀️ disappointed
3.0,Shoe fits a bit bigger.  When walking makes a sound.
3.0,Delayed and not of quality expected from pic
3.0,"I thought crew socks were taller.  On me, they fit barely above the ankle.  Love the styles and colors.  They are very soft and economically priced."
3.0,"Going on a quick trip and needed some casual shorts that can get wet or dirty.  The material is light but the description says that it can handle some abuse.  We'll see.  The fit is a little tight, could probably go one size larger.  Not a button closure as described.  It's a slide latch type thing with pretty flimsy metal.  Out of the box not overly impressed but all the zippers work and they are comfortable.  I'll update my review when they make it through the trip."
3.0,"LOOK GOOD,FIT PECULIAR,NIGHT DRIVING CLARITY DISAAPOINTING AS IS,IN RAIN"
3.0,"Yes the look good and grip well but riding for more than about an hour, you will feel it in the heels of your hands."
3.0,The fabric is alittle thin.
3.0,Creases are hard to remove. Will have to get it dry cleaned before I can wear it. Fit is good.
3.0,"Received in good time however one of the faux crystals was missing, so only 3 stars as low quality, especially for the price."
3.0,"These look well made, the material feels nice.  I followed the size chart, but in no way are they the size I ordered. They are very small. I wish I could wear them."
3.0,"This is a super cute dress. The fabric is cheap and thin but it’s good for warm weather. Iron it up with some spray starch and it actually looks nice. The sizing really surprised me. I sized you to a large and I definitely didn’t need to. The shoulders and bust were so big, they barely touched my body. I definitely should have bought a medium. The gathering allows stretch in the bodice but the fabric itself is not stretchy."
3.0,"Cheap thin material, my daughter's face cover was wet from trying to breathe through the polyester material."
3.0,"I was really expecting this product to make the oilskin hat stiff again.  Even after repeated treatments and heavy applications, the hat remained fairly soft.  It also wore out quickly.  Less than 6 bmonths later was right back to being soft."
3.0,"expected better quality, even if it is gold-filled.  Item too then and flimsy."
3.0,This beautiful dress is made of a very soft material....just beautiful but size 2X was too small for me....I wear a size 1X<br />Thank God I have 4 daughters I gave it away.
3.0,Comfy but after one wash shrunk enough they don't stay up. Constantly having to pull them up again.
3.0,The gold fades after a bit of use :( these are so cute and I always get lots of compliments
3.0,I am 5’8”  and these were too small on me. I am a dress size 16/18 and wish these had fit me better. I have an apple shaped tight body and they fit the legs OK but did not go up on my waist as well as I wanted them to.
3.0,Some were so small...are these for kids? Wtf? Creepy!
3.0,Beautiful... Not heavy... Not for winter at all.... Washes great... If you're cold nature person.. You will freeze with this... Nice for campfire...
3.0,I thought this would be gold plated based on the images advertised. It's not.
3.0,"Decent size, pretty color, but the bag handle &#34;leather&#34; looks a little cheap"
3.0,"Works as described - did a nice job winding my watch and keeping it current.  However, after 3 1/2 years, the motor has died and it no longer works.  I thought it would last longer than that, which is why I give it only 3 stars.  Before it died, I would have given it a 5."
3.0,Meh. Some what on the smaller size but super cute and my daughter actually keeps these on.  Good price too.
3.0,"Is not slim at the base, after being washed the lace sort of &#34;frayed&#34; and is a little bigger than expected. cute sweatshirt though."
3.0,I didn't like the chain at all but I put the horn on a different chain and I love it.
3.0,Got the blue with blue tinted. They are cute but wish I'd gotten smaller frame.  Also they look cheap and are not worth the cost
3.0,"Very cute and stylish product. Just what i was looking for but one of the pair came defected, had to return and ordered another pair. hope the next one is ok"
3.0,Love the style and fit well
3.0,"I like to say these are nice, but I wanted bigger pearls earrings at least 14mm it would be nice! south sea, I can't fine them!"
3.0,It's a beautiful tie but it's about six or seven is just too short
3.0,They work great at keeping feet protected and comfortable for short trips... If you need or plan to wear them for extended periods (more than say 6 hours) it will cause your feet to be VERY water logged and sore. They do not dry fast and will keep your feet wet all day even after you have come out of the water.
3.0,"It's a nice enough watch, but the specs made it seem like the band was larger than it is. If you have a thick wrist, this isn't the watch for you."
3.0,"Hard to see the design. I almost returned it but it wasn't worth the time and effort to return it for the price I paid. I should have gone with the old adage, &#34;you get what you pay for.&#34;"
3.0,It is smaller than what the sizing showed. And the bra is not supportive.
3.0,Material for the bag is nice quality but if for my Louis Vuitton neverfull MM  with large size it's way too big. When i try put it in my louis vuitton neverfull mm  it's look like box.
3.0,"It’s a pretty cover, a little tough to get my checks into though"
3.0,"I'm giving it three stars because I really like the dress as a whole except that it was too small on me. The XL fit my mother (160lb 38DD) and even then she said it was a bit snug. It looked really cute on her, was a great length, the dress is really well made and the color is beautiful. Since it runs so small I have to return it and don't think the largest size would fit."
3.0,Bought this as a gift. When I got it the box said pumpkin spice but that wasn't  what was in the box. Never laughed so hard in my life.
3.0,Run a little small but thick/fleece lining
3.0,"It was under $10, so I can't complain.  But I found the chain to be too short and rather cheap, so I had to buy a longer chain to go with it.  Other than that, I did find it pretty and will wear it."
3.0,"my loves is obsessed with rapunzel, she has long blonde hair like her favorite princess but she was upset her &#34;braid wasn't as long as rapunzel's&#34; she was trilled when I bought this for her, she is only 3, she's tiny, and the headband part is too tight on her head and she only wears it for a few minutes at a time"
3.0,"The shirt is beautiful. However, it's made for curvy or voluptuous women. The shirt is very restrictive and does not stretch to accommodate my athletic physique. It's best to buy a size up. I was pleased that it arrived in prompt fashion. It's too pretty to send back. I'll just give it to one of my daughters. I would recommend this product just be aware that it fits more slender physiques"
3.0,Depth of cut is too large
3.0,"I like the purse.  It holds a lot, and it's the style I've been looking for. However, the quality is pretty poor. There are two inside zippers, and both were broken. I ordered another and will return the first.  My second one just arrived, and the inner zippers are again of poor quality and I expect them to break quickly."
3.0,"Great product, but it is very unbalanced for hiking.  A lot of weight on those side pockets.  Also straps don’t fit my body properly.  Great material though and well sewn at the seams, great for a extra bug out bag.  Just not for me I opt for overly high quality items.  Will be switching to a 3 day assault mystery ranch bag."
3.0,Really nice. I was expecting it to be bigger more room around my wrist but it isn't. It's very tight still nice but I am bummed that I can't wear it often.
3.0,Online the dinosaur swim suit looks purple. I received a burgundy/dark pink color instead of purple. Cute but not sure I will be keeping it. Shirt is also large compared to shorts.
3.0,How does this have a 6” inseam?  Look at my photo. It’s at about 3”.  Too short for my husbands comfort. There’s plenty of horizontal stretch but not much vertical stretch so there’s not much gain in length when worn even. The fabric is soft and the size 34 fit as a 34 should.
3.0,"Just right, light weight and comfortable"
3.0,"While this dress has pockets which you would think is a plus, they are so poorly positioned in the dress it would be better if it didn't have any."
3.0,"Sometimes you get what you pay for. For the price, this sweatshirt is fine. I would compare it to a Haynes type sweatshirt. The color is vibrant and washes well. But hair and lint are constantly stuck to it and the material is just ok."
3.0,"Cute dress but it runs small at empire waist, awkward  zipper under the arm"
3.0,3xl individual are shaped differently may need ro show different models/shape wearing the clothes.
3.0,"Fit is fine. The print on the fabric is what I'm just not sure about.  The print in the picture looks better to me.  There's something about it that I haven't been able to pin-point yet, but it''s the print, not fit or style.  If I get ambitious, I may upload a picture."
3.0,"Be prepared if you are a regular buyer of this brand. This is the first time that I found it not running true to size. One wash and it's now too tight, especially around the neck!"
3.0,"A little small, but does have plenty of compartments and a nice design."
3.0,"Very nice. Good quality,  runs small and tight"
3.0,"This headband does not stay on very well during a rigorous workout.  It's okay, but not great for working out, which was why I had purchased it."
3.0,"This is just another top. Not really impressed. If you want a ""quiet"" fashion choose this."
3.0,Ok but sweat too much
3.0,"Thexeord DIARY is spelled DIALY on one of the charms. On some other sites selling the same item, I see the same error. I did find the same bracelet at a cpl of sites with the correct spelling. I dont want to give this bracelet with the misspelled word so i am disappointed."
3.0,I bought this red dress from the seller RB Winner. It is not the best quality. It does fit ok though. You can see the elastic on some places on the waist. I was planning on wearing it with a belt to dress it up so I am keeping it and will make it work. The material is pretty thin compared to the black one exactly like this I bought from another seller.I bought this one because I was trying to save money. I bought a black one from Lovezesent seller and the quality of their dress was so much better. It (Lovezesent dress) did cost more but was worth it. For reference I am 5' 6&#34; and weigh 185 and got the XL.
3.0,They are not that durable but still these are only used for vibram fivefingers shoes/.
3.0,Very thin material ordered one size up but wished I hadn't cute top
3.0,The band itself is cute but it wasn’t a proper fit for my Fitbit blaze. The actual Fitbit screen falls out easily when not being worn and moves around in this case/band.
3.0,The dress had a small hole in the back
3.0,"Alot larger than tnought., shoulder chain does not come off., may need to return"
3.0,The color was not what I expected. Not true to picture
3.0,Love the softness of this shirt but the top part is large and the bottom part too small. I got the medium so I can’t size up or down. I am keeping to wear at home or run errands but won’t be buying more.
3.0,"It looks just like the picture. Cute, haven't worn it yet."
3.0,Small around the bust. Had to sew it shut so there wouldn't be gaps between the buttons. Material is thin and requires a slip underneath.
3.0,"I bought these for when I travel believing that they would dry faster .. and they do.. however, they also were larger than expected and started to lose their spring after a couple of months."
3.0,Looks just the pics but depending on your calf size can easily be too small or too big. Only goes half way up my calf. Material inside is plastic and does not stretch.
3.0,No me gusto mucho la tela
3.0,"This is a beautiful feminine band but it is not offered in two lengths. If you have a small wrist the band is too long. Sadly, I am returning."
3.0,Thin material. Cheap
3.0,"So I didn't know what to expect per say quality-wise, but I did expect them to fit.  I mean, I am a 10.5, pretty common mens size.  I was able to force them to stretch to fit onto my feet (after many tears), but at that point they had no shape and fell off quickly. Ultimately with what was left of the sock by the time it was on it would provide no protection whatsoever.  The person may as well be barefoot.<br /><br />Children on the other hand they work OK for, I gave them away to a friend with kids as 'emergency socks' for the kids.  Also found out they make OK robber masks for kids (because it doesn't matter how little shape they hold).<br /><br />I figure for the price I shouldn't have expected much, so I am going to give this 3 stars for being too thin and too small.  They would probably work OK if you are a smaller mens size... like a 7 or maybe an 8...  Or smaller."
3.0,"The dress isn't as dark as the colored pictured, more of a bright red rather than maroon. The fit is okay, but, the fit and flare is not as defined as I would have liked or as pictured in the photo. I'll be keeping the dress but, it's not what I was expecting. I ordered the size Medium, my typical dress size (10), and it fit true to size. I'm 5'10 about 170 pounds with an athletic build."
3.0,I love this shirt.A little heavier than I expected. It is an awesome fit too.
3.0,"It's a good product. The three stars are because if your frames are thick on the top, the little clamps are too small to fit around them. Since this item was inexpensive, and I use them only when driving (because my photochrome lenses do not darken sufficiently in the car), I bent the little clamps so that these clips on work OK."
3.0,Love these but seem to run a bit small
3.0,"The pattern is not the same as the picture. The sleeves and pants legs are short. I would need to wear this with a blazer and high boots although that was not my goal when purchasing it. The material is somewhat thick and not see through, which is good."
3.0,It is a beautiful necklace but ended up being larger than I imagined. I liked it enough to keep but I don't wear it.
3.0,Color is beautiful I order a large looks like an extra small
3.0,Came with missing rhinestones on collar and lose thread!  This is not a cheap dress I would expect better quality!  Ordered a size 6 fits my small 7 year old great.
3.0,Way TOO THIN of material!
3.0,I kept this even though it was a little oversized. Put tank top under it. Very comfortable.
3.0,The shirt is adorable  I wore it with black a and white polka dot straight leg jeans.  The shirt runs very very small. I bought an XL because I don't like my tops to fit too tights because I am a little busty (38C). The buttons were pulling it was so tight. I was not pleased...
3.0,Runs big..very cute
3.0,Fits a little weird. Sleeves are tight and awkward. Cute dress for someone else.
3.0,"very warm. 1 time use, came apart already"
3.0,These European sizes are for kids :(.<br />Beautiful jacket though.
3.0,"Too small, very small under my arms, uncomfortable fit.  I'm returning."
3.0,Perfect for no show but slip down off my heel a lot
3.0,"This is only my experience. These are very well made, but they were too tight on me. I could not get them to loosen up. I donated them."
3.0,It’s okay. The material is thin and definitely see through. The straps are a little small making it sit higher than in the picture. I’ll have to wear a slip underneath.
3.0,Too bad it didn't fit. It was cute
3.0,These bangs are good at first but stretch out quickly.  If you have a set of five might be worth the money.
3.0,"Good quality, but they don't breathe, so they tend to make my feet sweat then they become uncomfortably damp inside."
3.0,"Good wallet, however, I wish there was a pocket with a zipper to put your coins.  if they had that it would be 5 stars."
3.0,Loved them till they ripped on the inner seam.
3.0,"It was difficult to get it on by myself but, I am in a power wheelchair and need help frequently. Well shopping at target, a storm head rolled in. Luckily, I had brought my new poncho in a bag hooked on my chair. A target employee helped me get it on to ride home. The bonus was he found Velcro straps for the legs to keep the behind the knees to keep the lap area together, so no wind can blow it up.  I found out on my ride home how handy this feature was. Highly recommend."
3.0,I’m usually 5.5 and got a 6. The side is slightly curved inward and happen to be tight at the bunion. I don’t have a huge bump but it still manages to be tight and uncomfortable. It is creating friction right where I circled red. Overall it is well made and I do like the thick bottom. I would just make sure to get a bigger size.
3.0,Love these earrings however even with the back stopper I added the earrings constantly fell out until I lost one forever. Now I can't wear them at all.
3.0,I've purchased 3 pairs of these sunglasses. 1 silver pair and 2 gold pair. The glasses themselves are wonderful. I had one gold pair swept away at the beach and ordered another to replace it. However all 3 pair I have ordered have had insufficient protection for shipment. The most recent pair I had to return because the bridge and lenses were so mangled. They are a great price for the quality of they survive shipment. I intend to try one more time to replace the gold pair but if the shipment is mangled again I'll have to cut my losses with the silver pair and stop wasting time and money on sub par packaging for a nice product.<br />5 stars for the glasses. Zero stars for the packaging. All 3 had issues but the last one was bad enough I refused to try to bend them back into correct shape.
3.0,To me it is much smaller than it appears in the picture. I had to use reading glasses to read the inscription. It will likely not hold more than 3 or 4 keys comfortably.
3.0,These were just ok.  The kids loved playing with them at the glow in the dark bowling alley.  Quite a few of them didn't work though.  I was glad to have extras to replace them.
3.0,I ordered the one that looks blush pink but it is actually a yellowish cream color.
3.0,I have worn this shirt a couple of times and I am expecting it to last for a season of wearing.  The fabric is pilling a little already.
3.0,"This hat arrived with the crown crushed on one side, and there was no good way to fix it. The box wasn't at all damaged, so I can't imagine how I was sent damaged merchandise. I still gave it 3 stars because it's a cute hat, and the quality was good  for the price, I would have kept it if it was wearable. If it wasn't out of stock, I'd be exchanging it, but for now I'll just get a refund. ."
3.0,"Definitely a cute dress with good material, but super tight on arms; I had to send it back. I’m 5’9 and it was long enough."
3.0,Loved the material (fabric) but the product ran VERY small
3.0,"It is a nice belt, but the metal pieces started to come off after the second time I wore it.  It's a shame they are so poorly made, because it is a nice belt."
3.0,"They're really cute and stay on incredibly well! I have small boobs (A's) and they were GIGANTIC on 'em so I snipped the pasties down and that worked. Unfortunately, I don't want to have to do that so I won't be buying these again. ): Aw."
3.0,"This robe is totally different than what I had been using for years which is a towel like robe. The feel of this one is tough, and hard to get used to."
3.0,"I was really hopeful to love this as I’m a hoodie girl and this looked a little dressy.<br />It is not soft, is boxy and the arms run short."
3.0,"Fabric in the flimsy side, but very pretty."
3.0,Pretty dress. You will need to wear something under it because it is see through. So I would size up
3.0,"It doesn't completely black out your face, I guess this is so you can see through the mask. Its like putting on a stocking, but darker.. It is very tight, but I guess they didn't want it to be loose like other cheap masks. It did the job for me, but you might have to consider these factors before you buy it."
3.0,The locking system was not what I expected.  But I guess you get what you paid for.  Live and learn.
3.0,"Great product,  good construction,  great price, wish they where bigger balls, but I'm a guy and like most men we want bigger ball key chains, So we can grunt like my main man from, Home Improvement,  Tim the Tool Man Taylor......update March 10th 2021, Paint coming off, recommend using real brass, willing to pay more."
3.0,"Super cute-<br /><br />update- about a couple months later, it did tarnished unfortunately. I thought stainless steel wasn't supposed to change colors.<br />But for the price, not complaining."
3.0,They were really cute and good quality but a little different looking then what the picture showed. When I bought them they looked like the perfect size but when they arrived they were way to big for my face!!
3.0,I liked the convenience of it being a wristlet but it’s old and I was afraid it’s going to break apart
3.0,I have bought these in store multiples of times. They are my absolute favorite.  These particular ones order my ears develop skin loss and puss. I am not sure if maybe these are fake compared the the real montana west I normally purchase in store.
3.0,It's very large...it looks smaller in the photo. It's the size of a door knocker!
3.0,"This is a very pretty blouse, but I had to send it back. I need -3x, and it fit well except the sleeves were very long. And you can''t roll them up. They go way down below my hands. I wish they made sleeves geared for short people that need the larger sizes."
3.0,"To be one size, Its really small"
3.0,"The ring was beautiful. My ring fit it the enhancer but, even with buying a size bigger as suggested than my ring it didn't fit my finger."
3.0,"I like this product, did run smaller then last pair I bought!"
3.0,"Ran small.  And needed to be aired out as it had a bit of an unpleasant odor. Other than that, it was ok"
3.0,"I really like these shorts.  The only thing about them that makes it hard to recommend is the elastic waste.  The elastic twists and folds in half under the fabric.  It’s something I have to adjust and fix after every wash and several times throughout the day.  If they could see the elastic down permanently, I would buy several pair."
3.0,Cute skirt.  Rides up when trying to walk/exercise in it but ok casual wear.
3.0,I bought bags for gifts.  Very nice but they did not come with a bag to pack them into which every other one I’ve seen or have does.  I like to keep them in my pocketbook so I always have a bag. These would b hard to do that with since they would keep opening. Otherwise I’d have rated them higher.
3.0,"The top of the dress is a little odd in fit.  Under the armpit, the fabric sticks out in the front or back so it looks a little big."
3.0,I am a size small and this was not at all flattering. The fabric hangs funny. Pretty flimsy. Definitely not terrycloth.
3.0,It was a little to long for me
3.0,"What can we say?  Issues, issues, issues.  We went with three stars, with three stars being generous.<br /><br />Let's begin with quality.  Loose strings, uneven hems, stitches that wandered, and more.  Quality borders on being unacceptable.<br /><br />Then there is the fit.  The fit is...well...interesting.  We have skirts that flow and skirts that flatter and more.  This skirt just sort of is.  For straight bodies, this skirt might work.  For everyone else, well, good luck with fit and flow.  This skirt just does not hang well from the significant other's waist, and is not very flattering.  FYI:  This skirt is supposed to stretch up to 46 inches, and the significant other is well under 46 inches.  It is possible that her small waist is part of the reason the skirt does not flatter her figure.  That sort of thing can happen with a ""one size fits most"" product.<br /><br />We also have an issue with the lining.  The lining is kind of a built-in slip, but put a bright light on the far side and suddenly this skirt becomes a see-through.  In certain lighting conditions, this skirt could be more revealing than might be desirable.  Indeed, underwear is a must with this skirt with the right ratio of back and front lighting.<br /><br />Do we have anything positive to say about this skirt?  Yes.  We like the pattern.  We like the sparkly decorations along the hemline.  We even like what the designer tried to do, though in our opinion the results came up short.<br /><br />Even though the quality is so-so, at best, this skirt requires dry cleaning.  Frankly, I think we would be embarrassed to take this skirt to the dry cleaners.  I could see the dry cleaners refusing to clean this skirt for fear that they might get blamed for the quality issues.  Or they might look at us like this skirt was the only thing we could afford, poor things.<br /><br />Our assessment of value is below average, based primarily on quality and fit for the price.  This skirt is a low-end skirt that seems to be aiming for a mid-range market, and just does not quite make it there.  Factor in dry cleaning, and our assessment of value drops further.<br /><br />Our overall rating is three stars, though we were very tempted to go with two stars.  Indeed, on a scale of 1-10 instead of Amazon's 1-5, we probably would have waffled between a 3 and a 4.  The quality is below average for this price range, and the skirt just does not hang as well as other skirts we own (which may be because of the ability to stretch up to 46 inches).  On the other hand, we actually like the colors and pattern, and the style has its plus points.  It is just that the negatives outweigh the positives for us.<br /><br />Good luck!"
3.0,"Beautiful colors a little too small for face too thin ,but think there going to work for nieces faces there smaller"
3.0,"I'm 5'8"" 205#.  I ordered Large and they're not very tight. I would say they run pretty true to size. Don't order larger than you'd normally wear or it won't compress you.  I'd try a Medium next time."
3.0,"She loved the dress but sizing ran small, had to return."
3.0,Super cute but it came with 2 holes in the dress along the seem
3.0,These are OK
3.0,Pretty but the amethyst is very small and difficult to see
3.0,"Love the fit, but the coral color was way pinker than expected. Wished i had gone with a more neutral color  (already have it in navy...love it!)"
3.0,Really cute shirt but the sleeves are WAY to small. Supposed to be an adult shirt but the sleeves are more kid sized. The fabric is also a little thin.
3.0,It took forever to get to me and it didn't arrive in time for Christmas but he loves it none the less and it seems to be ok quality
3.0,Bought the same one last year but was looking for a looser fit so ordered next size up...was the exact same size layered over smaller tagged one! Not wider or longer! Disappointed!
3.0,Perfect and very attractive
3.0,"Not as pictured, the sand is orange! If the sand was beige, it would be beautiful. Really? Orange? It is silky and feels good. But orange sand? Returned asap!"
3.0,"If I pull them up all the way, they sit just below my calves instead of at my ankles. Compression is perfect though. I'm 5'7&#34; and 133lbs."
3.0,Very thin have put clothes under not for snow this month Poconos
3.0,"I have ordered another size and will be returning the original.  Loved the colors and print...but, it does not fit as expected."
3.0,Considering our dreadful times product arrived early  to NZ - unreal and thank you! Sadly the colour in the square advertising the garment (which I loved) was NOT the colour that arrived - instead a really gaudy cheap pink that Doja Cat would think twice about!!! And she loves pink!!! The sleeves are huge about a foot too long so sewing skills needed to alter them but the wrap around  width and pockets are excellent. The material is light and thin but warm to wear- once the sleeves are doctored it will be fine in cold weather getting out of the bath - which is why I bought it. So all good. Deliver charge was steep due to Global meltdown. Will wash and wash until it fades!!!
3.0,dress was pretty  fabric very thin
3.0,"Arrived as expected, the quantity and designs advertised is what I received. They bend really easily and yet somehow dont stay in place on my ear or fall off all together."
3.0,Bought it for my wife.  She hated it.  Thought it was thin and not made well...
3.0,"Love the purse, but just after a few weeks of use the zipper broke.  Appears to be made with a very cheap zipper."
3.0,I’m women 5’7 inches which I have issue with my tummy so I’m afraid women coat I want but it won’t fit I had to choice men coat which fit for me but I know it too big for me with my sleeves too long as long I got fit unfortunately some spot broke I had to careful and we’ll balance!
3.0,"really would work best for a child ...the shoulder straps are a little short.  they seem to be well made, though."
3.0,"Nice and fluffy, a little narrow and small"
3.0,This shirt was a much darker green in color than is shown in the picture. Not sure I would have purchased it had I seen its real color.
3.0,"A little tight for adult use, I had to put it on over my shoulders but if you’re super skinny it’ll be perfect. I got this to use with my costume, although a bit hard to get on and off, I was able to still use it. I did like how long it is, was perfect for what I needed for the night."
3.0,Eh its ok. Kinda looks like im wearing a towel lol
3.0,I'm returning th first pair and getting a smaller size. Hopefully these will work but if they don't I will be returning those too. I got a half size smaller and they fit perfect. The only other problem was that the rubber heel came loose and they and dirty really fast. I ordered another pair. They are cheap.
3.0,"Its alright, I might look for something else next time."
3.0,"The wallet is great; however, I received a red one instead of the pink one I ordered."
3.0,3 year old with SPD not able to put these on herself. Just the right amount of noise canceling though.
3.0,"I don’t know how to review this. Fabric is fine, pattern is cute. Every review I read said it ran really big and to size 1-2 sizes up. I did and it’s HUGE. Amazon is just really hard this way.  Wish I’d ordered a small. Waist and hips are same size."
3.0,"Love the pattern, fits a bit smaller than I was expecting and just a little too long for me but it’s decent quality material."
3.0,The jeans fit good but it fit somewhat small.
3.0,"Very cute but back falls off easily, lost the pin within days of having it"
3.0,Overall it’s ok but could be better with quality of clothe.
3.0,"So, I thought it looked more metallic or stainless-steel Ish on pics despite the mention of plastic band. So, I was a bit surprised upon opening box (which is actually nice) POW! white plastic watch. Well bad on me so this sports watch is kind of cool for what it is, has useful functions if out running, biking, hiking, etc. not sure I'd go swimming with it on though doesn't look waterproof maybe water resistant to certain degree. Has double pin buckles and matching holes that not only provide a secure fit but allow adjustment for any size wrist. Plastic is not so hard that it is uncomfortable it has a cold Metalica feel on your wrist when you put it on which I like, makes it feel like my stainless steel/metallic watches. Time is conveniently displayed in analog or digitally so little easier to tell time on it. The crown is nice and big allowing you to easily grab an operate. Good sized crystal that is clear allowing unobstructed view of hour and seconds hand. Has well-marked lines to read seconds without any problems. Doesn't have a flashy bezel that stands out instead it has big, chromed pusher buttons with a waffle shaped grid on the ends. These help you access different modes and setting to achieve desired functions. Instructions were a little confusing to me but gave the jest of what was needed to be done. Size is good not too bulky it fits and feels good when on your wrist band hasn't caused sweat buildup yet so that's a plus. Function buttons are easier to use due to size and clearness of markings, has a light which is nice but doesn't stay on long enough. All and all this BASUMIU sports watch is not bad given the type and price."
3.0,"I bought this for my son to wear as a winter jacket.  The jacket fits him a little snug in the belly, but he is a little chunky around the waist.  The lining is like a fake velvety fur that does not seem very breathable and that I think is going to make him sweaty when he wears it.  The outer shell of the coat is an attractive color but looks sort of cheap, more like a rain jacket.  It will be an okay jacket but is disappointing as his “main winter coat”.  You get what you pay for."
3.0,"The pants look good and appear well made, but the size XL is actually an L, and the product is, in reality, even smaller than that. They're going back immediately."
3.0,"I want to love the dress but it does have some imperfections. Overall it's a great dress for the price, but if I paid more than $17.99 then I would probably return it. I'll definitely get my money's worth though.<br /><br />PROS<br />Great vibrant color and good quality material<br />Not see-through<br />Perfect length about two inches above knees and fits true to size (ordered M- I'm 5'5&#34; 36C bust)<br /><br />CONS<br />It should have adjustable straps because it comes up a tad bit too high.<br />Back crisscross straps were frayed (not a big deal to me because it's not TOO noticeable but if you're a stickler for details you might mind)"
3.0,"Pros:<br />Overall quality of the material<br />Colors<br />Fabric is very soft and 'fluid'<br />Not too see-through<br />Cons:<br />Skirt length between the 3 skirts is drastically different. I can understand an inch or so difference, but nine inches? That's a bit drastic. Take a look at the photos - I lined up all three skirts at the top and then laid them out on a table. The last pic shows a ruler lying on top so you can see there is a 9"" difference between the shortest skirt (purple) and longest skirt (black)."
3.0,The hat is cute.  I had to add an elastic band inside to make it fit.  It needs to come in head sizes so one  can select the right size.  All heads are not the same size.
3.0,"The material of the top was very stretchy and comfortable, but the skirt was kind of sheer, and didn’t fit quite right."
3.0,"bought one pair, it was great so I bought 2 extra pair for my wife and daughters to wear around the house. around the 3rd to 4th week they developed tears in the sole left front toe area. contacted company sent pictures and they thanked me and I have not received any feedback from them at all!!!"
3.0,"Are not the magnification advertised, not able to read with them."
3.0,"Not a big fan of the material, but it does the job."
3.0,"The product itself I like, its not too bad but not amazing. However when I received my package and opened the ziplog bag it came in there was a foul sweat like stench almost as if someone has worn it and worked put just before packaging it. I don't know why that was but i washed it and now its fine."
3.0,"I bought size Large, which is a size 8 on the tag.  I am 155 lbs, 5'5, typically wear a size 6/8 and my measurements are 36-30-40.<br /><br /> I followed the size chart.  The dress is a little small in the widest part of the thighs-- the size chart says size Large corresponds with 37.5 inch hips and I have about 39.5 inch hips, so the fit is accurate.  The dress fit poorly in the hips-- too large in the stomach, waist and hips and too small in the thighs.  I have slightly thicker arms and broader shoulders from weightlifting and the dress was tight in the arms and shoulders.  The fabric doesnt lie flat on me and puckers and folds in the midsection and hips.  A size smaller would have been much too small in the thighs and a size larger would be too big in the waist.  The seams along the waist and in the front pucker when the dress is off and are not just a symptom of bad fit.<br /><br />I was really excited about ordering the dress and I like the color but it is not right on my body.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful!  Sorry for the grainy quality of the photos."
3.0,This is a beautiful scarf. The red is gorgeous but it does not come as pictured. It is a large square of fabric that you have to fold to get it how you want it. I ended it returning it just because I don't have the patience to work with it. I got irritated trying to follow the youtube tutorials.

3.0,"The metal clips they used to have on them have been replaced by cheap plastic ones that bend and break very easily. I guess it is like every other product, when they make something so good, that it sale drops, they make it to where it will break, thus making the consumer buy another, and another, and...."
3.0,"Awesome tote, I use it everyday. But I thought it was going to be much bigger! A lot smaller than I thought it was going to be. So now I use it as a diaper bag!"
3.0,"It was everything we expected and looks fine,  but it arrived with a strong chemical odor.  They smelled like diesel. We washed them repeatedly to eliminate the odor and finally got rid of the smell with lot's of Frebreze and letting them sit outside in the sun."
3.0,Ball fell off
3.0,I bought 2 of these and one of them broke but the other one is fine and seems sturdy I don't know what happened to the other one but I enjoy this product other than the fact that no matter how tight I have it on its always a little loose
3.0,Three stars. The colors are very pretty and with Prime it arrived in one day. This material is very thin and it runs small.
3.0,"Love this. It was used as a Seinfeld Halloween costume. Ordered a size medium,  which was a good fit except for the sleeves. I ended up removing some of the elastic in the arms for it to be comfortable."
3.0,Cute but is not at all the same color at pics!
3.0,"Loved the dress, loved the material, loved the length but wished it came in a few more sizes. Even though I got the XL, it just wasn't a comfortable fit at least not for me. Sent it back."
3.0,Great shirt but definitely runs big! I’d say the youth xl fit like an adult medium
3.0,"The material is thin on this dress and the slit was cut too high and show underwear.  The color combo on this look too much like a night gown.  It is long so if you are 5'7 it will need hemmed or high heel.  Also, the gathering in the mid-section is unflattering."
3.0,"After opening I put them on and to my surprise I was very impressed with the quality of craftsmanship, absolutely fantastic! There's only one problem.. they have no vision after four feet of distance. I ordered the strongest at 3.0 lenses and they work and feel great for distances about four feet away and closer but all but a blur after that. I have to return them and the thing that sucks the most is, you're not likely going to find quality like this in any other brand of glasses. I read the reviews before purchasing and most of them said the arms break off but I would've been able to fix breakage problems, but nothing can be fixed when the lenses don't work. When and if they actually read the reviews and they take all the things we're talking about into consideration in efforts to fixing things I think in my opinion they'll have a best seller and me and many others  being a return customer as a result."
3.0,Runs very small. It could have been cute on. I tend to wear 12/14 in dresses and ordered an XL.
3.0,Thin material and smelled of chemicals when I ironed on a HTV vinyl monigram.  I bought other canvas bags in pack of 12 that were much better quality and cheaper per unit.  They do the trick and have held up so far but in comparison they could be better quality.
3.0,"Cheap glasses for someone that loses them a lot. Good for the price, I guess."
3.0,Size - previous fit as expected - this pkg did not
3.0,"I wanted to love them.  I'm sorry to say I'm disappointed, but perhaps this issue is just me.  These are beautiful and the order came with such an abundant selection.  But they don't work at all for me as a nose or ear piercing because I can't squeeze them enough to form a closed loop once they are in my nose.  I managed to close them part of the way with great effort (I even tried pliers but I would not recommend this while attached to a body part), but I also managed to flatten them a bit in the process and they are still open enough to get caught on things and fall out.  Am I missing something?"
3.0,"I ordered the grey in small.  It's definitely not as pictured.  It's  very lightweight (almost sheer) and not as form fitting as shown.  It's not bad, I'll keep it."
3.0,Fits strangely in The shoulders. Wish the fabric was softer
3.0,Not happy with the watch. Felt the size was not as good and was smaller. Went ahead and returned it.
3.0,"This was a gift for a teen boy who loved the print (eek).  Quality wise, meh, odd feeling fabric that isn’t very breathable.  Well received so overall win."
3.0,Bonita camiseta.
3.0,The elastic sits on my ears and is uncomfortable.  I like a more fitted scrub cap verses the puffy fit of this style.
3.0,"I do like this sweater, it fits nicely and the material es soft but sturdy. Mine is also a nice gray color. What I don't like is that the sleeves end 3 inches above my wrist, I was hoping them to end at my wrist as pictured. I got a size L by the way. I also order one in mustard that never arrived :( currently asking for a refund."
3.0,"Although this is fine for knocking around the house, the quality is not as nice as it was pictured. It’s a very low quality grade sweatshirt material. Would not order again, but not worth sending back."
3.0,Very cute but would not recommend for sensitive ears.  My daughter can wear them a few hours before her ears are red and inflamed.
3.0,The glasses look decent for the price. It feels cheap and the ends are sharp.
3.0,"Size is off, but nicely made."
3.0,It's ok. I just wanted a shrug so that I could wear still wear my spaghetti strap dresses to work but not be too warm. It serves its purpose.
3.0,No two pair of these fit the same. the black ones are too tight to wear for bed and the grey are tight in the thighs. the white  fit pretty good.
3.0,"Beautiful pattern! Absolutely loved it but, after a while my skin would become irritated due to the plastic! Keep that in mind if you have sensitive skin... might not want to wear it to sleep constantly like I did."
3.0,They r cute and fit well
3.0,"The cotton/poly blend is very soft and the blue and whit print is attractive. But, the fit on the size small dress did not work for me. The waist is high which would have been okay except the top is too big with the neck line quite low and wide and the sleeves were too loose. For context, I am a bit short and normally wear a size 4."
3.0,"These are cute but I'm giving it 3 stars because they shrank in the first wash. So my daughter, who was wanting to wear them out, can only wear them around the house, otherwise she looks like Urkle."
3.0,I am 5’3 and wear a 14 and a large in tops and dresses. The color is beautiful and the material is like a jersey material. It is long on me i have to wear with heels. Also while the stretch is good on the upper part of the dress; the tummy area is not flowy it is fitted and will show if you have a tummy.
3.0,I wear size 12 and got a 12 an a half. Still a little small.
3.0,The size is very small. You wear an XL I would go up at least 2 sizes. Plus it was short in body length
3.0,"Bought for an outdoor reception and its thick and warm like I expected it to be, but the sizing is a little small. I will have to drop a few more lbs for this to fit right."
3.0,Pin is cool but photo makes it look bigger. Its TINY . maybe the size of a penny
3.0,I was hoping for the ribbon to he wider.
3.0,Pretty purse. strap is not like picture. it's very short.
3.0,"I typically wear an 8. I ended up having to order a 7.5, which I wore once and realized they were still too big so I ordered yet another pair in a 7. Since I wore the 7.5, I couldn’t return them so now I have an extra pair of the shoes that I can’t do anything with. So buyer beware...these shoes definitely run large"
3.0,"The goggles do a decent job of keeping water out of your eyes, but the instant they get wet your vision will distort. All of the lines on the pool floor became blurry, which will give you a bit of a headache after a long swim. For the record, I have normal vision with no need for corrective lenses."
3.0,"Beautiful frames, but they are much more pink then red as presumed from the photo.  And to return they expect you to send to China at your expense.  No thanks.  Not worth it."
3.0,The color says black and red but it is actually black and pink. But it fits perfect so I’m trying to figure out if going to keep it or not.
3.0,"I have muscular legs: 15"" around calf. recommend a size larger. Broke thumbs trying to get on. Flesh colour looks like old folks. try something with more pizzazz."
3.0,"Bags are great, however the description states gray and they are actually black."
3.0,"I really wanted to like this dress; however, it doesn't look like what was advertised. The material is shiny. The closure is a zipper instead of a button (as advertised). I followed the size chart and ordered the yellow dress in a size medium and feels it's an 'ok' fit for my 5'7 - 140lb - 34ddd frame."
3.0,"It was a nice bracelet, just not exactly what I thought it would be. The description states that it's a &#34;flexible&#34; bangle which led me to believe it would open and lay flat but it did not."
3.0,"I like this scarf and the red is a good color for me.However, trying to find multiple uses for it provided difficult."
3.0,"Very soft, but her toe seam came out first time wearing them."
3.0,"This is a good quality shirt, and even thought it was not the same shirt that was advertised, I decided to keep it.  I ordered a blue shirt, like the ad displayed, but received a RED one.<br />  Be advised to ask about what you are getting before you order it!"
3.0,Ran a little smaller than I expected
3.0,"My niece loved this thing and the size chart was correct for her 10 year old frame. They never sent the keychain and after 3 times of contacting the customer service I just don’t think it’s happening. I wouldn’t care so much, but the child asks about the keychain weekly."
3.0,"I don't know how to describe it. It's cute, the material is thicker which is nice... the fit is weird and the slits are high. I kept it and haven't worn it yet, but I intend to."
3.0,"Don't get me wrong. Casio makes really good watches and sells them at a very low price. This watch, the F91W-1 is a great example of this....HOWEVER....they compromise drastically with the watch band. I have a very average size wrist but am forced to use the second to last hole in the band. By doing so, the keeper which you tuck the &#34;remainder&#34; of the band into is barely able to hold it. It would not cost much, if even a dollar to lengthen the bands on watches like the F91W-1. The F28-W is another one with short-band-itis. Because of the way the band is somewhat integrated into the design of the watch, changing/upgrading bands is not easy to do. Plus, removing and reinstalling the pins which secure the band to the watch is almost sure to damage the plastic tabs they mount in. Trust me, I've done it. One of Casio's best budget-priced watches, in my opinion, is the W201-1AV. Ample band length, shows day/month & date without pushing a button, PLUS a 10-year battery. Casio, please upgrade the bands on the other aforementioned watches among others."
3.0,"The chain is bigger than I expected.  If the shortest one was a little longer and the longer one was a little shorter, it would be perfect.  But whatever I still like it and its cute."
3.0,"Runs small, I bought the size I always do in leggings but these are way to small"
3.0,"Fit a little smaller if you have a larger waist. They fit thighs perfect but I could have sized up.<br /><br />I’m 5”6, 250 lb and got 2x"
3.0,Size was bigger than expected
3.0,"I have long a arms, after the first wash the sleeves came out a little short."
3.0,It's just okay and the bottoms run a bit small.
3.0,"I order an L, but is like a #6"
3.0,"I bought this for a trip to the beach and it was ok but nothing special. It probably won’t get worn much this summer. I liked the colors, but the fit did nothing for my figure and it was a bit too big. I’m a curvy size 16 and I got the xl."
3.0,"Not a very good elastic waistband, for the price paid I expected better quality."
3.0,"It worked great before the wash but shrunk a little after washing and drying. It is fine without my silicone insert, but with the insert it is too tight after shrinking."
3.0,"I ordered for my daughter who is 5'9 or 5'10 and thin. We ordered a small but she was unable to use it because it was extremely large and too long. It is beautiful, wish it had fit her."
3.0,"I do like the style. You need to be ready to steam it or iron it out of the box. A camisole is necessary as the top is very sheer. The waist down is perfect, the waist up is to tight.  If I go to large the bottom will be to big. That is my issue with all dresses.  This is why I don't like buying dresses on line. This my issue not the sellers, just be aware it is a very hard fit. Not worth sending back though."
3.0,"Doctor outfit is absolutely adorable. I ordered a small, the package was labeled small but the actual size was large. Had to hem and pin to fit. Check labels when received."
3.0,Too tight to wear
3.0,Shorter
3.0,"Good size for my average 5 and 7 year olds, but these are not made in Korea as the seller leads you to believe. No KFDA approval markings."
3.0,design
3.0,"The beanie is great but after a while it gets a bit discomforting. The sound is great though, awesome for listening to your music."
3.0,"Im 5'8&#34;, 125 pounds and ordered a small. The top was a really nice fit (I'm a B cup), but I found the bottoms to be HUGE in comparison. They aren't really high waisted, just baggy--seriously, I am nine months pregnant now and they are still a little loose! I know they will be way too big after baby. If you're looking for a maternity suit, though, this one works great! The pattern was exactly as pictured, and it's a great quality fabric for the price."
3.0,Doesn’t fit like the ones I bought in the actual store
3.0,The accessory is very convenient as it slides right onto my watch and I don’t have to wear two watches to the theme parks. My only complaint is that I ordered the “glow in the dark” one and it doesn’t actually glow in the dark.
3.0,I washed this and it faded out!
3.0,"Its a gorgeous dress but there is absolutely no give whatsoever. I have a latina booty and a smallish waist and the dress was not having it. It's a shame too, it's very pretty. I ordered a large and I am about a 10 in jeans for refereence!"
3.0,"This product was fine. It definitely ran a little small on me. I normally wear an XL (5'8 230lbs) and ordered a 2XL after the reviews worried me. The 2XL is snug but works fine, especially tucked in as my work uniform. As a larger-chested person (DD) there is definitely some gapping between the buttons on my chest. I've remedied this by just wearing a sports bra while I'm working (food service). The arms are pretty stiff, but I cuff them to around 3/4 sleeves and they're fine. I've washed it once and it did definitely bleed a little onto some socks, but the shirt is still just as vivid, not faded yet. I did not dry it and washed it on cold for fear of shrinkage and it still fits the same. Quality is average, not very soft, and a few threads seem to have come loose after its first washing.<br /><br />I purchased this as a last resort because I couldn't find anything that matched my work's uniform policy in-store in the time frame necessary. I wouldn't purchase it again, that's for sure, but for my summer job, it's serving its purpose. Note that if you're buying it for restaurant work, it doesn't have any chest pockets (I prefer that for my card to ring in orders). That's just me being nit-picky though."
3.0,The fabric is to light. It is see through.
3.0,"Nets do what they are designed to do. Not the highest quality, as a lot of the telescoping metal rods eventually fall out of their holder after moderate use. Still though, my kid loves them."
3.0,Way too tight and it doesn't breathe so its hard to keep on
3.0,"I love the look of the watch, but the band is so large that I can't wear it. It is MUCH larger than I would have expected for a woman's watch."
3.0,Cleats run about a half a size too small
3.0,"This is a beautiful shirt but, order a size up I ordered a lg and it's more of a med"
3.0,"not bad product, but I'm glad I read all of the reviews and went up  2 sizes"
3.0,It is very cute. But the sizing is off. I would recommend buying a size or two bigger.
3.0,"This is not good quality chenille so if you are wanting something that is going to last, stay away. As others have said the sleeve opening are small and the cuff has a tendency to stretch. I found it too small - though the torso and butt which is unheard of for me as I am larger in the chest. As soon as I find a replacement that I like more it is going back."
3.0,"Love it except the &#34;English gold&#34; is more like copper!!! It's pretty but not the Marina quailty I'm used to! It's looks cheap, even tho the stones are very pretty!"
3.0,"I ordered a 3x, received 2x. This product is untra thin, suitable for Cosplay but not for cold weather."
3.0,like it very much.  Even though i am a med i ordered large and extra large.  Both did not fit.  In fact there hardly was a difference between the large and extra large
3.0,I didn't really like material of shirt. It fit a little loose on upper body.
3.0,"As described, however one will not stay latched  so money down the drain for me !"
3.0,Wasn't what I expected.  Returned
3.0,Not as adorable or of quality as I expected and it seems to run large.
3.0,"I was really excited about this but it just didn't fit right. I'm a 36c so I got an XL according to the size chart. The strap adjustments don't allow for much tightening and the top was a little loose if anything, but around the bottom was just too thick and tight and would roll up and cut into my sides whenever I went to bend over. I couldn't even really do dishes in it comfortably let alone yoga."
3.0,"The color has transferred to my clothing, but I do like them."
3.0,Good quality material but run small
3.0,Doesnt have the seconds needle!!!!
3.0,Cotton material but its rough texture still after 1 wash. It's full length for me - height 5'2. Color looks the same as picture and it has long front opening which is comfortable.
3.0,Overall great concept but can still be improved. Not a big fan of the material made my head feel like a sauna even with the mesh on the sides. The back adjustable strap is to thin so it gets loose quickly when your moving. The inner lining of the hat that sits on your forehead is not very comfortable its crinkled so it kinda digs into your forhead.
3.0,I thought I ordered my size according to the size chart and they are too big.
3.0,Difficult to put on!
3.0,The top was perfect but the bottoms are ridiculously wide. My daughter has outgrown the shirt but the bottoms still fall off. She is tall and of average weight so most stuff fits her just fine.
3.0,Came on time. The head hole is small and there was makeup on the shirt when I unpackaged it.
3.0,the band is a little tight So it makes it uncomfortable to wear
3.0,It's a cute dress but it's completely see through. I'm sending it back because I didn't have enough time to also buy an under skirt so I end up wearing something else.
3.0,Inexpensive and a great fit for my size 0 girlfriend.  Delivery was too long @3 weeks.
3.0,"The sleeves were almost too long, which, having long arms, I don't really mind, but the torso was too short, & barely came to my waistband. Not mid-hip as it appears. Those issues however were secondary to the crooked zipper. It's a pet peeve when something on clothing is supposed to be straight, and isn't. I gave 3 stars because it was very soft and fluffy, the colors were just as pictured, it was true to size (except for the aforementioned issues), and the crooked zipper could have been an anomaly. Had to return."
3.0,"Comes from China. Long wait for delivery, but nice hat"
3.0,"The hat has a pretty good fit for my 2 and a half year old. Overall decently made. There was a weird stringy, hot glue type of stuff across it when I got it, that made me weirded out."
3.0,"Looks cute, but fits little tight and the fabric is horrible."
3.0,"Way too short if worn without long shirt underneath, unless you like your belly showing and exposed to draft.  Like the print.  Be prepared for shrinkage..."
3.0,The battery was no good so I had 2 pay 4 a new one. The watch is nice and the face is big and easy 2read
3.0,"These run pretty small, so I had to return them for a size up.<br />No problems with exchange."
3.0,"described as sweatpants.  they are not. are lightweight knit pants, not winter at all.  summer pants, certainly not sweatpants"
3.0,"I am 5’4, 130lbs, 34A... I ordered a medium after reading reviews.  I should’ve ordered a small.  Chest is way to big.  I hope this helps.  I always find it more helpful when people list their size, weight, bust size."
3.0,"Even though they're not as I expected, Not as thick, they're pretty good socks for the money."
3.0,"Had them 3 months and have put a few hundred miles on them. I'm left wishing I liked them more than i do. The material that makes up the yoke that holds the rectangular o-ring in place isn't strong enough to prevent the ring from rotating. This leads to bunching of the webbing and an annoying hot spot that prevents me from wearing these for runs of more than 5 or 6 miles. I emailed Xero to ask about it soon after buying them, they suggested sewing the yoke closer to the ring to trap the ring in the correct position. This didn't work, as the material that the yoke is composed of is stretchy. I followed up on my email to them and never heard back.  Also, I've already worn through the footbed (but not the sole) under both big toes."
3.0,I bought this for myself but ended up giving it to my daughter because it is quite small. It fits her great and the colors are nice on the trim.
3.0,I am 5’6 117lbs. I purchase a small. It fits but it’s not fitted in the back a little loose. I will keep it for work attire.
3.0,Bought a 6/7 for a girl who typically wears a 6 or 7/8 and it fits as expected. My only complaints are that it doesn't come with the bow as described and it's clear open mesh material on the sides. But other than that it looks as pictured and looks adorable with a matching doll dress ( purchased separately from a different seller).
3.0,I am 270 and the dress was too big for me I got a 3x should have gone down
3.0,Its cute. But its not white. Its more off white or ivory.
3.0,This dress runs snug in the chest and arms and slightly small overall. Pretty. A little shorter than I prefer. 🤷🏻‍♀️
3.0,Cute but stretches too big just like most crochet attire
3.0,Trees upside down on 1 side ☹☹☹☹
3.0,Chain shorter than expected
3.0,Beautiful but extremely thin
3.0,"I purchased the pink satchel with matching wallet specifically to have something that looks nice when going to formal things like interviews, weddings, or professional events. I'm usually a function over fashion person and also don't like to spend a lot of money.<br />This purse did fit my requirement of looking good. But that is about it.<br /><br />Pros: looks nice<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. I'm throwing away the wallet strap because it looks really cheap and is not usable.<br />2. Half the card holders in the wallet were unusable for standard credit cards.<br />3. The top doesn't open nearly enough to make it functional.<br />4. I used it for an interview and tried to put a pocket folder in it. I had a heck of a time getting it to go into the purse because the opening was so restricted and it kept getting caught on the pockets.<br />5. The color was more reddish orange than shown in the picture. The description does mention the color may be different though.<br /><br />I got what I wanted out of it which was a complement on my purse at the interview and a professional look.<br />I was kind of hoping that it would exceed expectations and also be a purse I enjoyed using which was not the case. It will be used on very limited occasions but for the price I'm not too disappointed."
3.0,It is very flimsy and the band does stay put.
3.0,"They are pretty, but alas not rose gold but yellow gold plated....  perhaps a wrong box was sent?"
3.0,Very simple and elegant my in-laws/parents loved it they commented how the color matched our wedding colors perfectly and easy to put on.  I did however need to re-glue them a few arrived broken. Other than that it was worth what I spent.
3.0,"It’s very heavy and it’s quite big. I’ve had one link taken out and the second link should be taken out, but it’d be too small. I think if it weren't so heavy, it’d be perfect."
3.0,"Beautiful color, much too large for me."
3.0,"Very cute. I like that you can use your own orthotic insole. But the 6W wasn't wide enough for me. It was tight across the ball, before the toes start. I'm disappointed because these shoes are attractive, light weight, and a great price."
3.0,"Back in the 80s or 90s, I bought an earlier version of this watch and basically wore it out. The only thing about this version that I'm not happy with is the band. I have a large wrist and the band is barely big enough, making it difficult to put on and take off. I ordered an extra long flex band and realized I had to cut the resin band off; this version does not come with spring pins! For 10 bucks it's still a good watch, though."
3.0,Love this shirt but CONSTANTLY picking off fuzz and tony fabric balls!!  This material is horr3!!
3.0,"Fabric is not really what i expected, but still good quality and the skirt part i found for my taste to be a little too flared, it's comfortable and i quite enjoy this product"
3.0,Very pretty purple color. Hangs strangely because the material is so thin. Didn’t even look right with a full slip under it. Maybe better for someone with more muscle tone than I have.
3.0,The middle gap( doesn’t fit how I would like) I wish I brought it a size smaller it might look better
3.0,"Didn’t fit as expected, runs small. Pretty top, but had to send it back."
3.0,Nice shoe for the summer but not ideal for rain or every day use.
3.0,"I read quite a few of the previous reviews before purchasing this shirt, I normally wear a Medium and purchased a 2XL to ensure it fit because I am busty. The buttons popped open in the bust area, and it doesnt show it very well but this is a 3/4 length sleeve shirt, it looks ruched up on the sleeves in the pic but the sleeves are not full length. I am giving it 3 stars because I am losing weight and hope to be able to fit into it. I still think its a very pretty shirt and look forward to being able to wear it in the future."
3.0,"These sandals are very cute, however one of them would let out a whooshing sound every step I took that was highly irritating and I ended up returning after a day due to this. :("
3.0,Not sure what the metal is but my wrist breaks out with itchy rash when I try to use this band.
3.0,"I bought these for face masks and they are ok. The patterns are fun and pretty.  I had to hem them and add elastic on one side because they would not stay over my nose. They are also really tight around my neck and are very warm. If you don’t like turtlenecks, do not buy these. Maybe that extra warmth will be better during winter, or if you are outside."
3.0,I'm 5'4 and 145lb 10 months post baby and I'm swimming in this.
3.0,"This is my husband's second St. Michael's necklace and it held up for a while. He wears it constantly and just now the connection came loose. We fixed it with some jewelry tools and it's back to the same. He likes it a lot, just wish I could find one sturdy enough."
3.0,"These shoes look well made. They have a fairly wide opening which is good for a somewhat wide foot. That being said, I returned them because they smelled horribly like rubber."
3.0,It’s nice but small.<br />A bit bulky but the piercing piece that goes into the hole (the rod) is small and almost squeezed my ear. I wish it was longer...
3.0,"The belt is average looking (i,e., there isn't anything about it hat would get your attention)."
3.0,It is okay. It is shorter than the other taxi wallets I have. Doesn't hold cards as well.
3.0,The dress is ok but the accessories suck.  She hardly had played with it since she just got it and most all the gems fell off.
3.0,"I believe I was sent the wrong dress. I ordered “purple rainbow,” but this definitely looks like the sequin rainbow. It’ll work, but that’s not what I ordered. Also, it seems very itchy and not as flowy as in the photos. It also isn’t as vibrant, but again, I definitely didn’t receive “purple rainbow.”"
3.0,The cord used is very thin and I just don't trust them with anything important. You get what you pay for!
3.0,"really love this style and cut, however it does run very small. The top fits fine but the bottoms dig in at the hips. Really wish I could buy this in an XL since the large was still too tight (tried medium first)<br /><br />34C-28-38"
3.0,This is super cute but the design is on the fabric not in the fabric so I definitely wouldn't put this shirt in the dryer. The print will probably get sticky and curl up and come off. Not the best quality but cute for sure.
3.0,I like the colors and it fits but both hats were smashed in upon delivery. It definitely needs to be shipped with stuffed paper to keep the shape!
3.0,"The bracelet is well made, fits perfectly. But...the compass has the direction sense of an Apple iPhone. Going to replacethe ccompass, don't want to end up in Canada when using it to find east."
3.0,The masks fit ok and I am happy with the shape and quality.<br />Unfortunately the elastic ear loop slowly detached from the metal retaining clip after about 5 hours of use. I'm sure it can be fixed with some sewing but that's not really idea.
3.0,"I got the L/XL even though I wear a size 6 shoe. The sock part is fine and the pattern looks cool, but I cannot get the rest of the sock on my leg."
3.0,"Very nice looking skirt, poor quality of the material though"
3.0,I purchased this because my original one was stolen with my truck.  I thought I was getting the same but this is the thin summer type.  It's ok but just too thin...like wearing stockings on your head.  My short &#34;high and tight&#34; hair sticks out from the top and the neck is not as long.
3.0,I LOVE the way it made my keys look but it broke after about a month
3.0,"Fits a bit small, but still fairly comfortable, according to my friend"
3.0,"It will make your glasses float, but looks stupid & irritates the side of your face after a couple hours."
3.0,Only comes in one size. May not fit if you wear a large band. Not the greatest clasp design
3.0,"Smaller than I expected, but it will hold what I need for a short trip.  The pockets are very small and could have been designed better."
3.0,They Won’t Be Able To Serve My Purpose!  Can I Return Them?
3.0,It's really small and the chains are uneven - I'm going to have to fix those and add more length to it before I can wear it.
3.0,"These are super sexy, but don't expect to walk in them or stand for any period of time. I got them for a photoshoot so they serve their purpose, but if you want to wear them out on the town--good luck. The shape is really weird, the heel and toe are not level (like a platform) rather, they kind of force you to walk on your toes like a ballerina. Still hot as hell and seem sturdy enough! I'm 5 ft tall and 95 lbs (VERY scrawny chicken legs) and these don't look stupidly loose on my calves like most taller boots."
3.0,I thought they were boring when I got them but painted them and added small details which completely transformed them into interesting pieces
3.0,Got it for a child and the head it way to big.  I should have returned it but for someone big enough to wear it it is real good
3.0,Nice style but made for a tall person or to be worn with high heels
3.0,You will get what you pay for.
3.0,"The colors are full, not vivid as pictured. They are more earthy than exuberant. I had wanted the bright colors.<br /><br />Also they aren't very plush and not soft. I don't like them at all. They are just &#34;meh&#34;."
3.0,I like the dress but I’m still trying to get the wrinkles out after one wash and two times in the dryer
3.0,"Fabric is a little rough.  I use come my glove when pole walk, would not use on my face."
3.0,"Después de esperar casi dos meses por el brazalete, el mismo día que la use se le cayó una parte. Si la compran que sea para uso personal, pues para un regalo sería bochornoso."
3.0,Work just fine.
3.0,"Great designs, fit great but the neoprene is very thin!  I’m not sure how much these will filter!<br />I’ve bought other neoprene mask of the same style and the material was thicker!"
3.0,"Cute romper but unfortunately not cut for long torso or a larger bust ladies. The cut of this romper is too small in the torso length and the top portion. I am 5’10 175 lbs. and measure 43"" bust(around the back and across the fullest part of my bust). I ordered the X-Large in the blue/white tie-dye print . I would have liked to attach a photo of this on, however the top of the jumper only covers one breast as you get about 8-8.5” of top coverage material for the sloped side and 12-12.5” for the strap side(elastic waistline to tops edge). The inseam measures 25”(crotch to pant leg hem), elastic waist is 30” unstretched and the wide leg opening circumference is 32”.<br />Now for you ladies that do not fit into the above listed this romper is BEAUTIFUL! Light and perfect for a summer day. The waistline is a high waist/empire waist style and the one shoulder tie is drawstring so it’s adjustable and also has hidden pockets. It’s somewhat sheer, but the design helps in that area. I looked everywhere for the fabric content and couldn’t find it on the attached two tags but being an avid sewer and fairly familiar with fabric this looks and feels like a rayon/rayon blend."
3.0,Turned black after 2 weeks of wear...
3.0,It's cute. I read reviews before buying so I knew it was super thin material. Still pretty cute for a bathing suit cover up. I've had no problems with it and ive worn it a few times.
3.0,"Shirt was cute and looked like the pictures, but the length seemed too short for what was advertised. I'm a bit on the bustier side, but before even trying it on I noticed it appeared to be very short and it was confirmed once I put it on."
3.0,Nice material but Too Small! My daughter is very small and I purchased a large it barely fit.
3.0,Love the style of these.  Very cheaply made.  What do you want for 12 bucks.  I will wear them till they break.
3.0,Nice shoes but pretty wide.
3.0,"I was so excited for this dress to come in. I got an XL because I am large chested and sites like ROMWE have a reputation for smaller sizes. The fabric was so thin you can see the folded bit of the collar when wearing. The sleeves were way too long. I love the design and the colors were good, but in my experience it wasn't flattering on a petite curvy girl."
3.0,I ordered a medium and it was a bit too big.  But it still looked good
3.0,"Does NOT look at all like it does I’m pic, doesn’t hang like it does ."
3.0,My daughter is tall and thin did her age. This was too short in the torso.
3.0,"The fabric of this sweater is beautiful, soft, and probably wouldn't pill because of the fabric content. Amazon recommended size L for me, bit I ordered XL, and it is still much too tight in the sleeves, bust, waist, all over and short as well. Very disappointed as I was so much looking forward to wearing this. I will return it, of course."
3.0,Not as cute as on the model.  The fabric was very thin.
3.0,They are NOT linen/cotton but 100% cotton.  Not as described.  The label inside the pants says 100% cotton.  Not happy about that.
3.0,"I love the look, exactly what I was looking for but I was disappointed in that there is no protection at all. If using it to protect against Covid, this won’t do it. But I have been wearing it over a face mask."
3.0,Material is very cheap and it fits very small
3.0,"The watch certainly keeps very good time but that's where it ends.  The light is not bright enough to be very useful at all.  The alarm is too quiet to hear if there is any significant ambient noise.  The biggest problem, however, is the length of the band.  While I am not small, I feel that I have a normal sized wrist and this watch is tight even on the last hole.  In addition, because the band is so short, on the last hole or two the tail of the band does not remain in the retainer and sticks out, hanging up on the sleeve of my shirt.  The band needs to be an inch or so longer.  If you have a small wrist, this watch would be fine if you don't care about the light or the alarm."
3.0,Its a nice product and exactly as expected. It was not anything to make us go wow (ordered for GF) but it fits the purpose.
3.0,"The picture makes it appear to be 3 masks. You actually get only 2. They are pretty, but only 1 of the 2 has a pocket for a filter so I felt like I was deceived somewhat. My ear loops are also not adjustable, but I can tie them tighter if needed. The best part is they are very pretty material. I don't wear them often so I'll keep them"
3.0,Faded after two washes .
3.0,"This necklace is OK, but to me the man made stone seems a little flat in appearance and the chain is very small and thin."
3.0,Got these fore nephew n he loved them
3.0,"In the website looks fine, but when I received it looks small and not sure if will fit to my girlfriend, hope that will be a problem. general looks nice."
3.0,The shorts worked out BUT I ORDERED A LARGE. They came in a sealed bag marked SMA LL and had a hanging label marked MEDIUM. BUT INSIDE THE SHORTS  THEY WERE MARKED LARGE. Very crazy.
3.0,"I didn't honestly know what the size of the hat would be when initially getting it. Most snapback hats fit really well and expected no different from this one. This hat would be better suited for a younger child more so than an adult or just someone who doesn't have quite as large of a head as I do. I would say for those looking for a better fitting hat, just know this does not fit larger heads easily, and it's a shame considering the quality is amazing."
3.0,"Expensive made in china, please í want to product made in us"
3.0,The bust is huge
3.0,Very pretty. Just too small.
3.0,Was a gift~
3.0,Not me wearing it but she loves it
3.0,"Giving 3 stars because it came crumpled in a little plastic sack.<br />With a little TLC, iron, and starch, the brim came out okay. Was not expecting the packaging flaw. But over all the product is good!"
3.0,The body fits nicely but the opening is really broad at the shoulders requiring some type of undershirt.
3.0,The dress is absolutely gorgeous.  Does not come with bow.<br />The clothing material is fantastic.  I'm a size 18 and purchased an xxl.  It was still a little too small..  But I guess that's motivation right?<br />Anyhow other than not having that cute bow.. I have no complaints.
3.0,Smaller than I wanted
3.0,"I bought these for sleeping socks.  They are a little small (I wear a size 8 shoe).  Depending on how thick you want them, be aware they are on the thin side."
3.0,Ring broke while in pocket.  Easy fix. Just lacks in durability
3.0,Very nice but is not adjustable
3.0,A bit more clingy than the picture suggests.
3.0,Just a little short. Other than that it’s great.
3.0,"These boots are very good looking, but when you wear them the shaft is too big, so it bends or wrinkles, and it does not look that good anymore. Besides that they are true to size, and very well designed, since they are not leather (thus the low price) the interior is covered in soft purple cloth, that is nice too."
3.0,3 of 5 a good long skirt.
3.0,I ordered a size larger than I should have needed and I am squeezing into it
3.0,I recently had to return a pair of swaroski earrings due to the Groupon not sending the matching necklace. I saw this on amazon and i thought they would be the perfect replacement. I was so wrong. The price is great but the earrings are fit for a child. They are so little and i wished they were larger.
3.0,"This thi , semi transparent cami works as an undergremnt or layering piece provided you don't need any support. There is no built in shelf bra and it could use one if you are even marginally endowed. The material has nice stretch but  I was missing the length. It falls at best at the upper hip and kind of edges towards the waist. I  did like the reversible necklines, either scoop or v neck. It only works as an undergarment for me and one without support."
3.0,"What  I expected. Light does not illuminate the face . Works well for my purpose. Have broken two other watches in Warehouse job. This one holding up well. Small, light,tough."
3.0,"The material is pretty as are the prints. They are very slippery and a bit short top to bottom, don't cover nose to under chin thoroughly."
3.0,normally wear a medium had to order large which fits like a medium
3.0,"Fits very small and not really the same as pictured, but still cute"
3.0,"I got too fat and grew out of them fast, they don't extend as much as they say they do"
3.0,"Very nice but runs extremely small, had to reorder in a larger size"
3.0,This is a birthday gift that has not been given yet.. i will post a review when the date comes..
3.0,"Super cute festive socks for Halloween, I didn’t find them to be overly tight. I actually felt that compression was lacking. 5/5 for cuteness 3/5 for actual compression."
3.0,Quality of knit was good but too large
3.0,I’m a 3XL guy - but this fit like a 2XL.  I even lost some weight and still didn’t fit well…
3.0,"These gloves kept my son warm and dry on our ski trip.  However, when he took them off, the lining came out of them.  I wish they were attached better, because it was a pain to get them back in."
3.0,It’s not as thick as it looks in the picture. It’s very thin.
3.0,"Not bad for a few laughs but there is no way Cousin Eddie could get this around his fat cheeks and neck. I have a size 19 neck and it is so tight I am going to have to rinse it and let it stretch a bit. Still, I can make it work."
3.0,Have not tried this yet but it appears to be cheaply made and its components are quite small.
3.0,The design and top layer are wearing down very quickly.  The graphic is starting to peal off and foam layer is coming through.  They do seem to fit well but I would not expect to get more than a few months out of them before the top layer is a spongy mess.
3.0,It's fine for a costume as to which it was purchased.
3.0,"I really like the look of this, but I wouldn't really consider it a bra because it gives absolutely no support. Granted, I didn't really expect it to after reading other reviews. I wear it on rare occasion over a strapless bra, or a black bra with tiny straps, and it works well for decorative purposes. For reference, I'm a 30D and I bought a small."
3.0,"Great price, but ran small.."
3.0,It’s good quality but the  Metal used looks a little weird for a necklace  I like it that it hasn’t snagged any of my shirts yet.  This is the only not style necklace I’ve had that didn’t snag my clothes fingers crossed that it won’t
3.0,"Non-Photochroimic at all ... good polarization thou and light weight. Need mine for day and evening bike riding so need the tinting on mine, returning."
3.0,"The bag is ok with the exception  that it came with a GOLD chain.  Picture showed silver.  Not sure why you would put gold with this bag.  Another buyer said the same but I was hoping I would get the correct one.  I have one I could switch it out with BUT the loops on the side to connect the chain are gold plated also...uugggghhh.  I'm not sure anyone would notice unless you are really looking, but I know it's off and I pay close attention to detail.  It's the perfect size. The bag will hold any cellphone along with lipstick and credit card.  The rhinestones on it are ok, they don't seem like they will come right off.  However; they did send you about 3 extra ones.  For the price if you are buying for an event it will work out.  Not sure it is for carrying too many times though."
3.0,This was pretty just too sheer for me.
3.0,It’s cute but a few days after ordering they randomly changed the arrival date so I had to cancel my order
3.0,"This bag is ok, but it was a little bigger than I'd expected. Instead of medium handbag, it is definitely a large. The only major complaint I have is this bag stinks. Literally. From the moment I opened the box, my nose was assaulted by the horrible odor within.  I have sprayed the offending purse with Fabreeze and aired it overnight. No change. I can't get rid of the smell."
3.0,"Great product that was great for sensitive skin, but sadly the top anchor unscrewed itself during normal day wear within a week so now the piece is useless to me :("
3.0,They ride up a bit.
3.0,"I received my hats. They are different sizes, the black is larger than the blue one I received. It is adjustable but I have a small head and the Velcro area is almost not big enough to adjust the hat as small as I’d like to. The blue one is perfect!"
3.0,"Wish I could design these. They need a flap to hook under the bra. I tucked mine in, but it comes out. Collars themselves look nice, it’s just that unless you have a thick sweater they will show through. Think Uncle Eddy in Christmas Vacation.  Wish the blue was more of a chambray looking, it’s true blue like a crayon. But, in a pinch if I don’t want to layer, it’s an option."
3.0,"Runs small due to the tie/twist in the front.  Bought the green, colors were great love the emerald and leopard together. 145-150 lbs and 5'4 bought the 8-10 and it fit everywhere but was short and snug on the tummy due to the tie feature. Returned for a 12 wearable but still not the most flattering."
3.0,The dress fits fine but when washed it tore in the seams.
3.0,"The fit on the top is off and is much smaller than the pants. You almost should go up a size if you want the top to fit right. I don't like the wider leg, it is almost too wide. I'm disappointed with this set."
3.0,"Didn't have size options and I had to order this one due to our ceremony this week. It delivered yesterday, very big for my face.."
3.0,Feels more like spandex than cotton but it is durable.
3.0,"This dress is gorgeous. However, the first dress we ordered (size 4) according to size chart and it was too small. Everything on THAT dress was perfect. The second one came (size 6) and it was missing the clasp to secure the top of the dress around the neck. Huge mistake! For obvious reasons. Also, there were threads hanging on the chest part where beads had fallen off. There were extra beads attached in a little baggie  but we really didn't want to sew beads on ourselves. The dress fits perfect from waist down. The chest needs to be a little more secure, so under the arms needs to be taken in about a 1/4 -1/2 in on each side. And she's about a 34 B with a 28 inch waist. Hope we can get it done in week!"
3.0,The first time i used the sand basket it split down one side making it pretty much useless. I tried to contacted the company and got no response. Other than that I like the poles. As far as the company not so much !
3.0,"This skirt is somewhat large. I thought it would fit perfectly because the size chart said the waist measurement for the small was 12.2 inches. I took this to mean that it was 24.4 inches all around. I have a 25 in waist all around and thought the stretchy material would make up for the 0.6 in difference. However, I think the material stretches too easily, so it does not provide a snug enough fit. I just pull the skirt a bit lower than my waist, and this helps. Other than that, the skirt is great! I am 5'2'' and the skirt ends about 3 inches above my knee."
3.0,Nice dress. Wrong size. Order a size up from what you normally wear.
3.0,The strap is fine but the enclosed screwdriver is not suitable to remove the screws to attach the strap. I had to go to the watch repair shop to attach the strap.
3.0,More gimmicky than function-able
3.0,Tree pendant fell off within two weeks of wearing it.
3.0,perfect lived the colors
3.0,"I bought this shoe (in black) along with 1 Naturalizer and 1 Clarks.  Both this and the clarks sandal are very comfortable.  They don't hurt by the end of the day.  One thing though, is that the strap for this shoe is kind of thin making my feet look bigger!! =)  The shoe was also kind of narrow.  (I have wide feet).  With time however, the shoe should loosen up a little.  I've been wearing it around the house to break it in."
3.0,The outfit is adorable. But that quality is truly washed away after the first washing.<br /><br />The material gathered “balls” all over the outside and is not worthy to wear in public.<br /><br />This outfit was good for one wearing.
3.0,"It's very nice, daughter loves it but we just don't like the smell of it. Smells like fishy smell."
3.0,Love the design but it's not useable for a wallet. It was hard like cardboard and difficult to put money in and close it. Came in perfect time and go fairy Tail!
3.0,I like that it somewhat looked like the picture. The thing that I dislike about it the fabric was thin you could see through it. But for the price you can definitely work with it a slip or dark under clothes is need and the fabric again is cheap
3.0,The earrings are pretty but I'm concerned how long they will last.  The posts seem kind of flimsy (they can easily be bent - hoping the posts don't break).
3.0,"These are much smaller than they appeared in the ad, but OK."
3.0,These are comfy however the spots around the frayed inlays literally frayed like fuzz. I'm sure alittle cutting would take care of all that. The leggens ARE super comfy.
3.0,"The size is fine, but the fabric, while very soft, is very thin and clingy. I wear it to sleep in."
3.0,Much smaller visor than expected. Should return. Useless in sun
3.0,"This Genhoo double breasted, plaid jacket is super cute. The fabric (100% polyester) is slightly textured, reminds me a little of linen. The plaid design (black, white) is simple and will match both jeans or slacks.  My only real criticism is this jacket runs small. I highly suggest ordering up. While I can’t button my jacket, I plan to wear it open. In conclusion, I give the design 5 stars, but in terms of execution and fit, 2. This leaves me with an overall rating of 3."
3.0,Cute earrings for someone who what's a stud earring...they are tiny but sparkle so Beautiful!
3.0,Thicker fabric than I expected
3.0,10 year daughter purchased with money received for her birthday. She was very disappointed that the pendant was so big.
3.0,It is too small for an adults face.
3.0,I ordered a size up because it said it ran small.  Even a size up was way too small.
3.0,Fits but a Lil short
3.0,Has an awkward fit for the well endowed woman. I found it to also be a little on the shorter side than I wished for. It is an ok shirt under a blazer or cardigan though.
3.0,"I'm being beat up with emails on this purchase to write a review. Its a toiletry bag, how excited does one get over a toiletry bag? It's not a designer purse!"
3.0,"My daughter loved it but it was very cheap looking for almost $30! Also ran big so size down. If you live in a area that’s cold, you would definitely have to wear warm clothes underneath as the material is very, very thin"
3.0,"Love the material. Bought size small, too small. Bought size medium, too small. 105. Lbs."
3.0,This is a very cute figure and was a great present but the arm does not work properly. It will move back but not forward.
3.0,Cheap quality... Frame and lens have noticeable gap. For the price I guess it is ok.
3.0,Size ok. Bon jovi not centered.
3.0,I like that the dress fits but only dislike is its see thru in the sun I will wear it around the house instead
3.0,Sending back as it looks like a “granny” or old-fashioned dress on me. Looks great on the model though.
3.0,Did not quite fit as expected. Otherwise a beautiful dress.
3.0,Boxy and I have curves.  I added a belt and cut the top up to make it fit better.  I wear alone or with leggings
3.0,I ordered this item that stated it was a 2  pack.  What it did not say was it could come in separate packages.  I received them about 2 days apart.  The items fit well and are comfortable.  So happy when I finally received what I ordered.
3.0,Adorable.  But shipping took 7 weeks!
3.0,I liked it but it broke after a few days. The color is as seen in the picture.
3.0,Very cute dress but super itchy! The waist line is also in a very strange and unflattering spot. I will be wearing a flowery belt with it to fix the waist line problem.
3.0,The print definitely seemed nicer in the pictures than in real life - somehow the placement of the cranes made me even wider. Yes the torso is short so heed the warning of the other reviews. On me it looked comical.
3.0,"I ordered my usual size in these pants, but I did look at the company's size chart to make sure I was ordering the size I needed, and I was. I don't know what happened, but the waist is a little tight - I'm long waisted and these pants/jeans are high waisted - and the legs are HUGE. So are the big cargo pockets on the jeans. They really are not attractive.<br /><br />These pants are made of  65.8% cotton, 29.4% polyester, 3.3% viscose, and1.5%Spandex, but there's no give or cling to them. I was expecting the very slim leg fit I saw in the listing picture, but that's not what I got. My legs are average in size.<br /><br />The waist is small on me, uncomfortable, but, as I said above, I'm long waisted and these jeans are high waisted, so that's on me. The waistband is all elastic in the back and there's a removable denim tie in front. I removed that for a smoother look.<br /><br />These jeans are just not made for me, and they are not, in my opinion, made to look the way they look in the listing pictures, where they have a smooth, tight leg, more like leggings than jeans or ""joggers,"" and there is an elastic band, which I like, at the cuffs.<br /><br />I gave them only three stars because of the poor fit and the fact that the jeans don't look like they do in the listing in real life. The cargo pockets are pretty big and awkward, and the pants do have several other pockets, which I do like.<br /><br />I don't know what the word ""joggers"" means to the people who designed and made these pants, but, to me, it means smooth pants that cling to your legs and have a slim fit. You don't want to drag around extra fabric, especially heavy denim, while you jog.<br /><br />These pants are not made to fit and look as they do in the listing picture, and that's enough to make me unhappy with them. They really don't look like that picture - the legs are baggy, the cargo pockets are very large, and they look nothing like jogging clothes. I was very disappointed with these pants."
3.0,"Top was very sexy but sizing is off. I had to exchange for a smaller size. For reference I'm a 34 DDD,5'4, 145 pounds,and ordered a medium. There were gaps near the inner side of the boob and my girls get trying to slide out as I danced the night away. A small I'm sure will fit way better. I got lots of compliments on the top despite the issue."
3.0,glasses came with a lens popped out  .. I just snapped it back in..
3.0,"Really wanted this suit to work out - unfortunately the Large was too big (I am 5'9&#34; 165lbs) so I had to return it. I feel like a medium would've worked great. Overall style was great, but like others have said, not a ton of support. However it is a perfect lounge suit for someone who isn't playing Spikeball on the beach and diving all over the place!"
3.0,"Bought as a gift. Seems nice but the quote is mispelled. It says ""not throwing AWAYS my shot"" instead of away. If this doesn't bother you, it seems to be a nice keychain."
3.0,The costume fits but the white overlay/sleeves are WAY too big.  Will have to pin both sides.  Doesn't make sense.  Like they had extra material they didn't know what to do with.
3.0,"i got two pair of pants. When I first got the pants they fit nicely and were very comfortable and they washed well.  But, after wearing them a few times, they now slide down, I""m constantly tugging at them.  The elastic fibers have become exposed in the seam areas so they no longer look crisp.  I need to make sure I wear a long shirt.  I work in an office so it's not as if I do anything strenuous to stretch the material. Disappointed I'm not getting more than a couple months wear out of them."
3.0,Even though it was extremely soft I ordered a white hoodie with no zipper I received a gray hoodie with a zipper
3.0,"Definitely it’s not my size i think that your small is like medium for me maybe I am to slim for your standard, I had to give it to a friend that run medium size"
3.0,"Quality seems ok. However,  it is much smaller thhan I expected it to be. Disappointed in the size."
3.0,"It's a blousy cut off, and looks a little bit cheapish, but with good accessories you can make it look more expensive.  Definitely more of a midriff top so if you hate your belly or have broad shoulders and a wider waist/narrow hips you might not find this top flattering."
3.0,"The product is beautiful and arrived on time, however I can't wear them the ring that goes around the toes are way to big so they slide right off my feet immediately"
3.0,"While it’s very pretty, the needle at the back is flimsy."
3.0,The fabric it pretty and nice. But the size was small for a 3x and the sleeves were very small.
3.0,These were way too big for my 5 year old. They were bigger than we expected based on pictures.
3.0,This is a nice product but my particular one had some malfunction of some of the lights did not illuminate.
3.0,"I bought this to replace a leather necklace I already owned that was frayed and very old.  This is harder to use than the old one - the lobster clasp is very small, and difficult to put on by myself."
3.0,"Smaller than I thought, somewhat fragile when I opened it. Though it seemed well made and its cute, its not what i expected for the price."
3.0,The bracelet is very nice but I couldn't work the clasp/lock. It's very difficult to open. I did send the bracelet back and choose another one with a clasp that is much easier to work with.
3.0,not impressed they do not go over my calfs
3.0,"You get what you pay for, the price will surely indicated what you are going to get. Do not expect much."
3.0,It's a cute bag but I wished there were inside pockets. The design is nice and the chain makes it look cooler. The material makes it looks expensive. I haven't had it long so hopefully the leather doesn't chip or peel
3.0,Are so cute look just like the picture they are much larger than I expected my niece is going to have to wait a while before she can wear them.
3.0,"5 Stars for warmth and comfort.  But, they easily slide down my legs.  So, I will come up with something to keep them in place."
3.0,"Nice color, unique watch. But mine came with a piece that fell off and was floating around inside dial face. For price, it wasn't worth sending back...<br />If you get, hopefully your is in tact, because it is a nice looking watch"
3.0,Didn't fit me very well but otherwise they're nice and well made
3.0,Super cute lightweight set.  They've lasted nice and shiny for weeks now even after washing my hands several times a day. Some are already fading but it took many weeks and washes for that to start happening.  Totally cute set for every day casual wear.
3.0,Good price and looks as expected. I bought an xs and it fit like a medium. I had to give it away.
3.0,Design and printing is good but the shirt is one of the cheap brands. Boxy fit and gets bacon neck after the first wash.
3.0,This is a gorgeous dress but I would not recommend for people who have wider hips as it actually calls more attention to your hips. Otherwise I love it.
3.0,"I was surprise these tops don't drop pass your tail like the photo, it fit more like a tee shirt.  I am not happy so I am going to return the items."
3.0,Would have kept the P.J.'s except the waist was too small for me. I like loose pajamas around the middle. I weight less than100 lbs and found these too tight for my liking.
3.0,"Still too big for my son, he is 6 years old. We tighten to the tightest setting and still too big for him."
3.0,"Way thinner then I wanted. Just my own preference, don't know if it's fair to rate this 3 stats but I an standing by it."
3.0,I have to return them. Im bummed.
3.0,Returned. Cheap looking. You have to be really skinny. It shows all those curves.
3.0,The material was kind of thin and the pink was brighter than I expected. The glitter looked good though and it the material was soft. Okay purchase.
3.0,This sandals are very comfortable.  I am not in love with the faux leather upper as it looks cheap. The sole is extremely comfortable.
3.0,Not for me ... a little uncomfortable where you tightened toghether
3.0,Love the quality of the top; ran small in bust.
3.0,Suitable to use in summer
3.0,Dislike flaps won't lay down
3.0,These were not great but they are OK.  They were a whole lot thinner than any cotton pants I've ever bought and I doubt they really are 100% cotton.  The only reason I kept them is that they were so cheap.  I won't be buying them again though.
3.0,"Thin material, best as a coverup"
3.0,The product was missing the belt
3.0,"These are really nice earrings and they go with  everything, but the colors I received were not the ones shown."
3.0,The watch seconds hand is not precise.<br />It jumps 2 /3 seconds at a time.
3.0,This REALLY small; I will have to have it stretched out just a bit.
3.0,Very nice design but it would look better in a different fabric.
3.0,"It's nice for an occasion.  Cheaply made but the price was right.  Not fooling anyway, even for costume jewelry"
3.0,Zippers were ill fitting and made it look like there was a tail on the dress. If you have a larger chest size this chest would work but the crafting of the zippers makes it impossible to 'make it work'.
3.0,I think it's a beautiful nose ring I just wish the diamond had been bigger. It's smaller than I expected and hard to see.
3.0,change the color
3.0,"I bought it to carry my weapon, however, the purse without anything in it is very heavy, too heavy to carry around on my shoulder.  I never use it."
3.0,Size and color are good. A little thin though.
3.0,bracelet fit nicely.
3.0,"I like em fine. Longer than Buffs which I like, more stretchy too. Great price and value. My only problem is the whacked out color scheme. I mean some of these things (not all) are LOUD. Not going to wear them our of the house."
3.0,"It's cute and comfy, but the top is totally see through. Not a big deal for PJ'S but don't take them to a slumber party."
3.0,i can't really judge it since it doesn't fit. I used the size chart and it is way too big.
3.0,"It's very pretty and well made, but the bottom flips up alot which adds bulk. It's also smaller than expected."
3.0,"This bag is cute, but I wish it had been larger. Looks the size for a child."
3.0,"I ended up returning this because it was not at all flattering on me. It fit, but it just didn't work for me."
3.0,"I love the suit. My problem was putting it on. How was i supposed to get my body in it? The opening for the neck was too small. I pulled it up over my hips, then tried to get my arm in the slots and could hear the threads popping. I have the scrape marks on my arms where i had to try and shove my arms through. It was too rigid, no give at all. It took me too long to get it on. I got a 3XXX and like the other review said, this is not my true size. I usually wear a 1X."
3.0,"It’s not long enough. Everyone’s anatomy is different but my original jewelry to pierce it is long so not sure why this is so short. I have to have it put in at the tattoo parlor, but not sure if it will stay"
3.0,"The product is poorly made, A for the idea F for execution. It falls apart so easily it's annoying to use"
3.0,"Exactly as pictured. Took off 2 stars because it does not come with a remote as stated. It has one button in the tongue of the shoe you have to click over and over repeatedly to get the color, and flashing speed you want. And to turn it off you have to go through all of the colors and speeds"
3.0,I really like the quality of material but the fit is off. Unfortunately I have to return it.
3.0,"It’s way darker than the picture shows. More gray than silver. It came a little bent up, but fine overall. (( Not *great* but not terrible. A little disappointing. ))"
3.0,"I’m 5’9” and the waist line hit at my chest.  The bottom was above the ankle.  The fabric is light for summer but not see-through, so it would probably be a nice dress for someone under 5’5”, but not for anyone taller.  It was true to size, in that I am a medium and the medium fit (except being way too short)"
3.0,"Not high quality. A feather already came off. Beautiful earrings I will fix the feather. Not terrible, but cheaply made"
3.0,This ended up being a very thin material that is not as long as it looks by the pictures. Also it rolls up on you throughout the day constantly. Barely went to buy button on my pants and rolls up so I’m always tugging it down under my regular shirt at work. Definitely not form fitting.
3.0,Color slightly different
3.0,"When I received it I loved the material and the pattern, but when I tried it on it made me look rather fat. The fabric is cut large under the armpits, and there is a lot of &#34;skirt&#34; flaring from the high waist. For maternity this would be a gorgeous top! I'm not expecting, however, so I'm returning it."
3.0,"At this price ($12) I'd say it was worth it. Cute and flattering style, pretty color, love all the (non-functioning) buttons. The material has quite a bit of stretch, fairly thick as well, which is nice. I am 5'11&#34; and the skirt came to the top of my knees, ymmv. Wrinkling is going to be an issue...it was very wrinkled out of the bag and needed extensive ironing. Wrinkles wherever you sit or bend. My dress came with little manufacturing flaws, the darts in the front of the bodice are slightly off, the 2 pleats in the back are off center, as is the notch in the trim at the top that is meant to simulate the effect of the button placket being real instead of faux/unopening. All in all, ($12) was a price I could live with, I would not have paid the ($25) it has listed as the regular price."
3.0,"Once the card slats are full, it creates a very awkward bend - if the ID holder was on the other side it would probably alleviate the awkwardness. Overall leather is very nice, needs to be broken in though however. Very difficult early on to get cards out"
3.0,"It’s not great material, as I put it on I could hear the stitching breaking apart."
3.0,It's a little longer than I wanted but the style is cute.
3.0,A bought a medium and should have gotten a small.  Waist is way too big.
3.0,The top is too tight. The bottom lays weird. Hopefully is doesnt shrink when cleaned and dried.
3.0,Was a nice wallet after a week the money holder tore up.
3.0,Very pretty. I think my heels are too skinny. So they slide of easily. But I will try again in the spring.
3.0,The colour of this dress is lovely. The material  is not bad but I normally  wear a large; ordered the large n it's exactly that on me - large.  I guess I will have to make some adjustments for it to fit correctly. To me the material has a lot of stretch so a medium  would have fit how I wanted it to fit.
3.0,Nice shoe just seem to run a little small
3.0,My daughter loves them. Only problem is the posts were bent upon arrival. I was able to straighten them.
3.0,Half these rings broke in the span of like a month. they’re cute n stuff like some are actually still unbroken but a lot did break
3.0,There not what I had expected
3.0,liked it but it was a bit see thru on the bottom part i recommend to get a dark color
3.0,Beautiful dress but it wouldn't fit over my chest. Had to return it. I'm not particularly large chested either.
3.0,"I really wanted to give these shoes two stars because the sizes are all off, and they are not very well made.. a better price would have been $20 flat, if that! But in the dark they aren't so bad..."
3.0,I normally wear a medium but I had to get a small and the pants are really long at the top. Came up over my belly button
3.0,"Star War person add to collection, she love it"
3.0,These are very loose fitting.
3.0,I don't like the mirror tinted shade
3.0,I wanted this to just take a walk on the beach - not as a cover-up. It was too short on sides for that but it would be a very cute swim cover-up - which is what it says it is...so as a cover-up - very nice - just not what I wanted it for.
3.0,"Not as soft as I expected. Material is a bit stiff. Waist is thick and not very flexible. Lighter than sweatpants, but heavier than yoga pants. Glad I ordered a size up. Legs are slightly baggy, as expected. Tummy area feels like control top. Jury is out on this product. Maybe it will soften once it is washed. Not quite what I was looking for.<br /><br />Update: They softened up so much after washing! Didn’t even recognize them based on touch. Def. a keeper now."
3.0,Cute pattern. Runs small but the arm holes are very large. Will need a bralette or bandeau.
3.0,Not very comfortable<br />Support is weak
3.0,not figure flattering just ok not spectacular
3.0,I love them and my patients love them too but the green one in both packs I bought doesn’t work.
3.0,Very tight in upper arms.  Order one size larger.
3.0,"Quality was okay, and it looked as good as the picture, except the collar, which was much larger.<br /><br />But when people say this runs small, they are comically overestimating.  I  could lose 20kg and still not fit this.<br /><br />I will be gifting it to a (much) smaller friend."
3.0,"The shoes are nice, they look well-made and easy to charge HOWEVER, after wearing them to school only one day, one of the shoes completely stopped lighting up. We have tried charging it but it no longer lights up. A little disappointed that this happened after only one wear."
3.0,"It does what it's meant to do and is of quality construction, but it's bulkier than I thought it would be. Be aware it will take up most of your pocket."
3.0,Words are a bit mushed but it works
3.0,"Unfortunately, this runs much too small so I had to return it. It was very pretty in person. It is just too tight on the bust and arms"
3.0,Nice. Color a bit darker than pictured. Broken within 2 weeks unfortunately.
3.0,scute dress but th material is very thin toy will need to wear shorts under itize
3.0,The material was a lot thinner than it appears in the picture. It was a tad bit on there smaller size especially on the arms. It didn’t look terrible and i would have kept it if it hadn’t been so small on the arms
3.0,I was looking for a soft cushion fit. They are very tight and thin. They just wasn't what I was looking for. They do appear to be a good quality.
3.0,"The necklace looks great, I like large jewelry items and this one might stand out for multiple outfits.  I gave 3 stars because the item I received was damaged (the big pendant was separated from the necklace and was dangling in the package). I have managed to fix it by squeezing the loose chain links and it holds, however I am not sure if this might affect the metal sturdiness and how it will hold in subsequent wearings. I liked the item, so will keep it. Nice to have. But recommend to seller to check the quality of shipped items to customers."
3.0,Has an awkward fit
3.0,"Beautiful Watch but the stem when pulled out to set the DATE, doesn't work."
3.0,It wasn't what I expected
3.0,Good for men. Too big for women.
3.0,The band disconnects from the watch too easy. I wear socks over it when worn on my ankle for fear that it will fall off.
3.0,The shoes are adorable but i ordered a size 8 toddler USA and received a size USA 12. My daughter was so excited she opened the bag and wore them immediately so i cant return them but it will be a couple years before she will fit them.
3.0,The material is soft but they shrink easily.
3.0,"slightly disappointed as the colors are far duller than they appear in the picture and that the onesie completely stunk of chemicals, as it aired out it started to smell like glue. nervous about washing it for fear of the print peeling or coming off. but will wash either way before putting my baby in it"
3.0,"Although I liked the design, I was disappointed that the sweater material was so thin.  Cute but would not buy again for the price."
3.0,It's shorter than the picture.
3.0,This is super easy to wrangle a squirmy infant into and a nice weight but I'm only giving three stars because it's ripped in about four or five different places after only about 6 weeks of normal wear.
3.0,"Cute glasses but a little flimsy, still not bad for the price, would buy again. One lense had a light scratch when we got them."
3.0,"There's a lot to like about this skirt - the material is thick and stretchy, the zipper is nice.  The problem is for me the waistband is fairly loose, which is okay, I usually wear a top tucked into it, so it's not the end of the world, but the thigh portion is quite tight given how loose the top is.  Granted, I do have problem with pants gapping at the waist, because I have an hourglass shape, but I don't know many body types this will work for.  Super skinny types with thicker waists?  At least when you order the size large, maybe different sizes fit different.  The snugness of the thighs is compounded by it being a below the knee skirt, rather than at the knee or slightly above.  So, I think the success of this skirt is going to be much more hit/miss than many Patty Boutik items."
3.0,It's a bit too long and the sleeves are tight because I have big harms
3.0,"Ordered for my wife. When I opened the box I thought, “Wow, did I order plastic boots? To me they appeared to be plastic and cheap looking. However, my wife said, and she’s not worried about hurting my feelings 💕, that she thought they were cute!<br />She tried them on and I took note that it took her a while to undo them enough from shoestrings to get her feet in. Once she got them on she said they were a little narrow and that they were more show than comfort. She decided she would keep them though for that certain occasion where they would accessorize nicely with an outfit. Shaking My Head…Women 🥰<br /><br />Synopsis, made for a narrower foot. Pretty but not overly comfortable."
3.0,"I like the material, but I ordered XL and got what looks like XXL or XXXL. Also it is bright white, even though it is labelled off-white."
3.0,It is not as long as it is in the picture
3.0,Look like I'm an old lady
3.0,Not as flattering as I would like and got it a few years ago and I just don't like it anymore
3.0,"Love the pattern, but I would say it runs a bit small.  I would size up for a better fit."
3.0,"Good quality as all Garce Karin stuff is but it keeps riding up on the shoulders. Gets pretty annoying after a while. Otherwise, thick rich material and color. I have found that GK usually runs big, but for this shirt the large was accurate sizing to me."
3.0,"Have to admit I was excited when I first got the set, but some of the clasps are off kilter and make it difficult to snap open/closed, so I mainly wear the one mid-sized pair that have easy open/close hinges on the clasp. Pro: very pretty and don't discolor the ear. Con: some don't snap right."
3.0,I received  these pajamas for Christmas. They are so  soft and comfortable.  The only negative that I can see for these pajamas is that the elastic waist band SUCK.  I am usually not very picky whenever it comes to something like that but I am constantly having to adjust the waistband because it’s in a bundle. Even during the night while I’m sleeping it is quite uncomfortable
3.0,Underwear are okay but the top is pretty small and not great quality.
3.0,super cute but runs small
3.0,"it looks OK, like an OK bra but the one strap is completely broken and not usable. also, it’s a generic named bra with a daisy Fuentes strap. I’m not sure why  though. it fits OK, but not a lot of support or padding . Also, it has a weird smell to it and definitely needs to be washed, but other than that it did come with clear straps and a black strap for around the neck, so not horrible for the price. I just wish the one strap had not been broken :("
3.0,"I ordered the long sleeve shirt. It's very cute soft and comfortable. My daughter really likes it however, it's definitely 3/4 which was a suprise to use since it gets cold where we live during the winter."
3.0,"I bought this for my work keys and am very disappointed with the quality of the rings.  The carabiners are fine, but I have to keep replacing the rings and am now going to just buy replacements.  The rings keep stretching and I am afraid that my keys are going to fall off.  Luckily it hasn't happened yet."
3.0,Received it before time thank you  elegance
3.0,"This shirt is fitted, so does not fit &#34;fluffier&#34; people well. The material is a little rough, not a soft cotton as expected. I would not buy this shirt again."
3.0,"Great concept for a necklace but, within about 5 times of wearing the item it started to tarnish. The &#34;silver&#34; coating is now rubbing off wherever it's touched my skin and the chain is as well. Making the necklace look dirty. I would pay extra to have a better material used that won't fade or tarnish. It's ok but a little disappointing."
3.0,Cute but ring part looks really cheap and like a kids play toy
3.0,No sizes on the adjusters to know what size your setting the neck to.
3.0,Not as nice as in the pic. Returned it.
3.0,Don’t really like the feel.
3.0,"Cute, but too short. Had to return it."
3.0,"So, as you expect for paying as little as you do for these cuties, they break pretty easy. Even if you super glue them back together, they still bust pretty easy and bend easily too. Careful not have one snap off in your auxiliary port!! But, you do get a cute handful of colors, and it's not like you're paying alot for them...it's worth the buy to have people compliment them all the time ;3"
3.0,"I like the earring, however they did not come with the post."
3.0,The mask does not fit my face.  The ear loops are made out of a thin uncomfortable leather.  Overpriced!
3.0,As a dress it’s way short. It barely covered my daughters back side. However the straps were way to long. Her baby girls were always out for everyone to see. I had to use it at a top with leggings under and tie up the back so that her front didn’t fall out. Otherwise it’s really cute.
3.0,"Nice design, suited for tiny wrists"
3.0,I didn’t like the seam going down your boobs. The material is a bit odd. The dress the model is wearing doesn’t have that seam going down the boobs.  I decided to return it.
3.0,"Color is not that piercing blue like photo shows. Overall it's a cute dress, a little thicker than what I expected and long."
3.0,"Ordered for a size small woman but got the Large. It just fits. Glad other reviewers noted the size issues. It is not hemmed on the bottom of the top. The straps were not put together in the back and it was difficult to attach them. For the price, I am satisfied though not delighted. We'll see if it holds together."
3.0,clasp broke with in a week
3.0,"The cups move around---and after washing, they are a little misshapen."
3.0,"They all look wonderful and are exactly as they seem in the pictures. However the issue I find with these is that the edges are not finished with any stitching or anything. They tend to roll up as a result and aren't quite as secure when using them as a face covering. I believe that if they had some finish work done on the edges, they would rate much higher."
3.0,The material was quite thin
3.0,Nice butterflies but very small!
3.0,I bought this as guided by the size chart.. but it's a bit too small for me. I am slightly built. I'm hoping i can stretch it (break it in) enough for it to comfortably fit. But overall great quality and great looking jacket
3.0,Very nice but had to go to Hobby Lobby and purchase little rings to the side of them so bands would attach
3.0,"Fit well, well made."
3.0,"It was very cute, but the cheap metal irritated my ear and I had to take it out after a couple of days."
3.0,"It was a father's day present but I'll use it instead,"
3.0,I like the mask because it is very much so bling like I like them to be but very heavy and hot
3.0,Looks a little cheap. I will replace each head over time with a Pandora charm that is similar. Hard to put on.
3.0,"Seems ok, turned colors a lil, but I wear it all the time!"
3.0,"Unfortunately this is a no for me. As you can see, it’s see through. The cup pads are very visible and if you take them out you can slightly see the nipple. Also, it doesn’t feel very supportive. It’s just stretchy fabric and an elastic. Even my side boob kind of pops out, which isn’t something I’ve experienced before. It’s also not as long as the picture shows. I wouldn’t recommend it.<br /><br />Edit: The company reached out to me and offered me a refund due to my insatisfaction. So I’d definitely recommend purchasing from this seller due to their customer service."
3.0,I guess I didn't realize how small this would be. About the size of the palm of your hand. Not what I needed. Returned.
3.0,"I bought my husband the royal blue xxl  and it fit perfectly so I ordered one in burgundy also xxl and it was smaller and the sleeves were too short. Not sure if this is the reason but the blue was made in Honduras while the burgundy was made in El Salvador, sending back and trying another color and hope for the best"
3.0,"Material is soft and white is a nice bright white, but its not very long. Certainly shorter than the picture and I can only imagine how it will flood after washed"
3.0,"The small is very big for a small frame, I am petite but not too petite most smalls fit me fine, I would say this small is equivalent to a large.  Would have been nice to have Xtra small available.  Quality is very good and it's very comfortable  But I'm going to have to spend money to have it altered, it swallows me up."
3.0,the thread can be seen.
3.0,"It's a cool shirt, it fits as expected and it's comfortable to use, but the print showed cracks after just one time of use."
3.0,"It's a really nice set, but I honestly wish that it had more of both set's of latter's.  Overall I love it. Just you can't really do to much with all the bands and barriers without enough letters..."
3.0,Hubby happy with the purchase.
3.0,The dress is pretty but it was tiny! I normally wear a 2x and it was super tight! I gave it to 2 other people to try and they agree with me. Then I gave it to someone who was a size 12. Fit her everywhere but the length. It was way long! So now I am just stuck with it.
3.0,I can't find any evidence that the bracelet is sterling silver as it is not stamped. The beads are very pretty though and I will use them on another bracelet. It was probably worth the price for just the beads but I was disappointed in the bracelet. It arrived more quickly than i expected.
3.0,"They're pretty cheap pants, not so impressive. The color has faded pretty quickly and they are dull now"
3.0,Comfort is great. My issue is the pull strap loosens frequently and makes it hard to stay on for the time I need it to stay in place
3.0,Nicely made looks nice fabric is a bit sheer
3.0,Normally wear a med/large and ran very snug. Pay close attention to the Asian/US size chart and definitely go up a size.  Zipper a little sticky too. Returning and sizing up.
3.0,"They would work great, if the lining went further up in the front."
3.0,"Really just too big overall, long in the back, short in the front, space under arms"
3.0,"This is a really cute sandal.  However, the upper leather is harder than usual.  If you buy it, make sure you are going to put in the effort to break it in.  I wore them without socks and they left two bruises on the top of my feet.  I had to wear them with socks around the house.  They are a little better now.  Not quite there yet.  But, birkis are worth it!"
3.0,Good price but broke after 2 uses. We were able to make a temporary fix to get through the swim season.
3.0,I am allergic to the metal :(
3.0,Decals are coming up on edges as soon as I got it
3.0,"I liked the style, but the zipper quality felt poor. Especially coming up at angle, it was difficult to zip. This is a thin/lightweight hoodie."
3.0,Love them but diamonds were missing
3.0,Not very moisture wicking so not very flattering for working out unless you are ok with sweat stains and people staring
3.0,"The dress is pretty, comfortable, and flattering, but the quality of the fabric is not very good and the seam at the waistline was uneven. I have also  had some issues  with deodorant staining which has not happened to my other dresses from similar fabric that I've worn as much."
3.0,Yeap not good for this petite woman! Too large every where.
3.0,These are super cute and nicely oversized but I keep having to push them up on my face.<br /><br />I think I’ve had these a little over a month and the side frame has already broken. :(
3.0,Great quality but doesn’t fit a small or medium head. I tried to adjust the strap to smallest possible but I still can’t wear this hat at all. Really sad about it. Just threw my box out. Hoping to see if I can fashion some sort of quick fix.
3.0,They were a gift. I don't wear them.
3.0,"Things to consider - It takes 2 weeks to get to you because it is from China, you are not able to track it, only packed in small padded pack, true to size ( I ordered size 8 for my forefinger/index), color is as shown, ring is as shown, not sure of any fading/quality at this point (purchased for special occasion use). Not terrible, decided to keep it than return it to China."
3.0,"It’s beautiful, but not well plated. Overall OK, just don’t get it wet. Pretend it’s like a gremlin."
3.0,Very cute. Still trying to get the top to drape as well as it does in the photo
3.0,"This had the potential to be a clean, contemporary and sleek bracelet, if the sizing was only more accurate.  I don't have a small wrist, and I don't have the largest either, I usually wear a 7&#34;, but you'd think that with a 'belt buckle' design, wouldn't matter, right?  Wrong.  I had to use the last available hole, which didn't enable the bracelet end to stay put under the metal loops.  They keep working their way out throughout the course of the day.  And, if you used the first two available holes, you'd have to wear this as a ring.  To be fair, if you have a small, or medium wrist, you probably wouldn't have my issue, but because I hate returns, I really thought an adjustable bracelet would never require one."
3.0,"was hilarious. I left in my car in the sun while at work and it fused with my seats. it was perfect timing though because after i ripped it off my seats and plucked off the plastic bag that was stuck to it, what was left of it looked super creepy so i wore it for halloween."
3.0,"Sent it back, I have big boobs and felt the red part in front was cut funny and didn't compliment my body as pictured showed.."
3.0,"The cloth was too sheer, very cute but hard to camouflage anything under it in the cream color."
3.0,"Nice socks, they stay up all day. They do help keep cold legs warm. Unfortunately they are not nearly as tight as I would like for a compression sock."
3.0,"I ordered these in olive to go with my son’s Boy Scout uniform. They are extremely dark. They look like a dark charcoal color in most light, but you can see just a hint of green sometimes."
3.0,its just okay it doesn't remove all of the tarnish off of my silver
3.0,To small no stretch need Xtra side
3.0,"The bodice runs huge, but I'm used to that since all clothing is made for large busted women. Altered it to fit myself and it's fine."
3.0,the all white didn't look all that great on me but otherwise it's okay..
3.0,"Nice stretchy material, looked just like the picture. It was a bit big in the armpit area so my daughter has to wear and under shirt but she is also stick thin. Otherwise no issues she loves it and that’s what matters"
3.0,It's a cute dress.  Very stretchy. I'm a 16/18 so I ordered a 2x and the fit is off because it's a little too big. It's also longer than pictured. I love that off the shoulder look. If it had fit correctly it would be almost perfect.
3.0,I was worried about it being too small but it fits well. It did come with the end a bit smashed.
3.0,Update: took apart watch and reinserted the battery. Has worked for 24 hours but I did buy backup batteries incase it goes out again. Will update if wrist turns green from metal.<br /><br />Back has bubbles in metal. Plastic piece that keeps the watch from starting missing and is what I assume made the battery dead before I opened the box.
3.0,"I bought this as a gift for my mother and it's too tight for her.  I bought her one because I bought one awhile back and mine fits perfectly.  I got a medium and I got her an extra large.  The only thing we both hate is that the zipper comes undone a little and it pinches, bad.  Had to buy big bandaids to wear when we have it on."
3.0,Looks cheaply made. No waistband.
3.0,Good quality. Personal preference of not liking the style. Great value.
3.0,"The boxers look cool and fit as expected. However, they're very flimsy. These are the kind of boxers you would wear if your plans for the day involved nothing but sitting around. Any kind of physical activities, even excessive walking, will cause the bottom of these to ride up your crack to the point where you're wondering if you bought Batman boxers or a Batman man thong. I've worn them with dress pants, jeans, gym shorts and regular shorts, and the result is always the same; my hand digging between my cheeks to pull the legs of the boxers out. Just something to be aware of. Good boxers for minimal activity. Anything more and it will be Wedgyville, Population: You."
3.0,Cute small purse
3.0,Love the shirt but mine does no fade from the dark to the light purple as shown.  It does get lighter but very little
3.0,We bought a XL but it fit more like a Medium or Large. The tag was also cut as well. Couldn't see what material this was made from
3.0,"The underskirt was sewn with the seams facing outward rather than inward.  Because of this, the white care label shows through the dark chiffon overskirt, to be seen by everyone.  In regards to size:  I'm a sz 10-12 and the 12 (XXL) was too large.  It would probably fit better on larger busted women.  The description mentioned that the neckline could be worn two different ways - up or down.  There is a button and a tag on the back which prevents this so it must be kept buttoned up.  If you like a victorian look, it's perfect!  The lace sleeves are stunning and fit well.  This dress needs to be produced with a gentle, lower neckline for a more glamorous look.  I did love the feel."
3.0,"The plastic heart cover fell off almost immediately. Unfortunately, I didn't notice it until my keepsake flower inside fell out sometime during the day. I was heartbroken!!! It was a memento of my grandson.<br />After 6 emails (yes, six!) the seller promised to send a replacement on December 12th. I haven't received it.....<br />I never write reviews but this one broke my heart.... literally....<br />If you buy this item, be sure to enclose it securely.<br />Edited on January 30th - I did receive a replacement plastic heart but no adhesive. And now a tiny bead fell out on the other side too. I will give them A for effort but do not recommend purchasing."
3.0,"To begin with, I was shocked at the price and immediately thought it was a typo. I ordered it right away. Then I started googling for this jacket, but I couldn't find any information. Found only similar jackets. When I received the order, I immediately began to check all the tags and found numbers that fit a raincoat. As a result, I do not know whether the product is original or not from this moment. The quality of the material is excellent. Everything is very well stitched; nothing sticks out anywhere. At the moment, it only got under drops of water, and the water remained on the jacket and was not absorbed. I can only say that I expected more by the warmth, but I was not cold in a T-shirt and a jacket at plus 15 Celsius. As soon as I taste colder temperatures and rain.<br /><br />Update 21/11/2020:<br />Not warm after 13 degree."
3.0,"Beautiful ring, much thicker than i anticipated though."
3.0,"I am 250lbs 5’10. I do have wide hips. They fit they are comfy, but that feeling with the slight struggle to pull them up over your hips makes me feel like they aren’t 100% comfy. As women we know once we pull the pant passed our knees and up if they will be decent these fall short of hip room while putting them on. But once on they are fine. If you need a work pant that just does what it needs to then these are it. The material is man mad so if you have fabric sensory issues not for you."
3.0,These are so adorable but they bent while putting them on so they’re very weakly made but really cute.
3.0,Sags after sweating
3.0,These ran a lot smaller than other brands. There is also a thick band around the leg and waist openings that made them feel too thick and constricting.
3.0,"The tip of the thumb doesn't stay on very well and the mitten part feels like its a size or two bigger than the gloves themselves so even when you fold them over it doesn't stay in place very well either.  Also after a couple times using them outside playing in the snow with my 15 month old niece the finger tips are starting to fray.  Nothing serious, but I was hoping it wouldn't start so soon after buying them.  The palm padding absorbs water so that part gets wet fairly quickly, while the rest of the glove resists the snow a bit better.<br /><br />They are warm and feel comfortable.  I'm considering removing the mitten part and the tip of the thumb to make them fingerless gloves only."
3.0,"I get asked all the time dude why not wait until 4 of July or something, people missed the who purpose of the shades"
3.0,"festive, fun and broken. I wore this a few times and got a lot of compliments. It matched a lot and looked really really great for the price. After three or four wears it spontaneously fell without even being touched off shedding tiny little beads everywhere that I am still finding in my bathrooms. I would totally still buy this if I had a specific occasion/outfit but I would not expect it to last more than that evening."
3.0,"We were expecting a regular size backpack but it is very small, so a little disappointed. But it is a nice bag other than that"
3.0,The Batwing design inhibits the arm movement
3.0,The size was way to small. I bought a XXL because I wanted it to fit over sweat shirts and sweaters.  However it would even come close to closing.
3.0,"The socks that I received were very hard to put on although they are therapeutic , man getting them on was not easy. I received them at no cost to try them out. The color was great, it was nice and bright and after washing them they still maintained their color. Once I got them and took them out of the package I rolled them down like you normally would a long sock to put them on. I. Had a hard time putting on the first one and so I came up with a strategy that made it a little easy to put on the other foot. Once the socks were on they were very comfortable. Everyone liked them got lots of compliment. Taking them off was as hard as putting them on. If it was not for the taking off and putting on parti would of given them a five."
3.0,You can see right through
3.0,was smaller than I expected
3.0,"I guess I shouldn't expect the hem of this dress to fall on me like it does on the model given that I'm 5'3"", but I'm disappointed in just how long this dress is for me.  I want to love it.  It fits well in the chest/torso area, but I feel a bit frumpy when I wear it because of the length.  I can't really alter it because the bottom layer/ruffle would then be small than the other two layers/ruffles and it wouldn't look right.  So I suffer in silence instead."
3.0,The size looks smaller than it supposed to be
3.0,"They were my favorite underwear but so far had thrown away all of them. They look very nice, comfortable and strechy. They came in the package of 6 with good price but didn't last as long. The lace in the back ripped off easily after washed them several times compare to my other underwears that I bought at the same time which I still use them."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:7072d0b7cfe537d902a28a752c6f854e]] Such a cute dress. Fit prefect and fast shipping. The material is not the best quality, after a few washes already looks very worn and color is fading. But expected for the price."
3.0,"This is easy to install and just like the original, but the size is a small and might not fit on a man’s wrist. Mine barely fits and the original band was much bigger"
3.0,"Its cute but the chain is too short. Its got great colors, and a lot of sparkle, she loved it!"
3.0,The item was lable extra large but it was like a large. My doughter kept it.
3.0,"WAY too small! - I went by the size chart and it fits far too small and short in the torso. It’s labeled as a Woman’s size but when it came, the tag says “Youth”. :(<br /><br />Super smooth / soft though. If you’re a skinny Minnie you’ll love this shirt I’m sure."
3.0,"The quality is good, but the product doesn't look as good as the photo suggests. It takes some fumbling to get the straps to align the way you want and then they sort of flop around. I originally bought this as a gift for someone but it didn't look good enough in person for me to gift so I wore it myself and it's not terrible but not as good as advertised."
3.0,It fit as expected except the length. The length was supposed to be 33&#34; but I received 35&#34;.  I tripped walking up a hill at the mall.  I washed using cold water and was bleeding. It is very beautiful and light when worn.
3.0,"I love it,the top was just to small"
3.0,"Three starts for being a cute shoe and packaged nicely, however, the shoe was very uncomfortable and one fit totally different than the other. I'm afraid I will be returning these. :("
3.0,"Comfortable but poorly built, the sole separated when I was taking them off, really disappointing..."
3.0,"I loved the weight of the material and look sets you apart.  Unfortunately the sizing is wrong for the U.S., I ordered a large and it was more like a small."
3.0,"Not bad for the price. The nose rest broke off almost immediately, though"
3.0,"I ordered this dress in XL, but it is way too small. Runs like M. It is see through too (white with aqua design). Will return it. This dress is well made and a good quality fabric."
3.0,"Like the shirt, but its a bit too big."
3.0,"The glasses were super cute, however... They had excess pointy plastic around the nose area that could cut you. They’re cheap but totally worth it! Especially for the amount you get!"
3.0,They are just what you paid for.  Work just fine.
3.0,"Is nice but fits small, I'm a medium ALWAYS and this fits small."
3.0,Nice solid look
3.0,It's not the most flattering if you have a pudgy tummy. Totally not the products fault. But this is definitely not slimming or forgiving. Only purchase this is you're in tip top shape!
3.0,"Pants have a nice fit, not too tight. I usually wear an 8 in pants but have thicker thighs so I occasionally size up. I went for a large not a medium, hoping that it would give me enough material to cover my butt and thighs and still have a high waisted look. Turns out they were too big. The loose fabric made them fall as I walked.<br /><br />Reason I am giving these 3 stars is because the color is not at all what I was expecting based on their pictures. I was hoping for a more purple blue with blue lining not a teal/royal blue with white lining. If you are okay with white lining then these are fine. Overall not bad but not what I wanted."
3.0,"They seem to run very small, I should have gotten a size larger than XL."
3.0,"Loved the dress, thought it looked nice. However, as soon as I put it on, it was too large and not for someone without curves to them. 3 stars because the overall dress is nice, but when it comes to size and fit, its just poor. A little misrepresented on here about that."
3.0,Not as attractive as in pictures and runs small
3.0,It is a little easier to put things on or off but still not real simple. I would not buy it again  and not worth $10.
3.0,The neck is stretched out looking....more like a cowl neck instead of turtleneck 😥
3.0,"Why didn't I think of this!?! But in all seriousness, I was really excited to try this new product. I hate the feeling of too tight hair ties on my wrist and I hate the feeling of loose ones on there too! So this seemed like the answer to all my problems!<br /><br />Well, sort of. When I received the product, part of the metal finish was flaking off. What a bummer! Regardless, I tried it on, and it was much too big for my girly wrist. Another bummer! It is not flexible enough to bend to fit your wrist, and I guess that might be counterintuitive considering it needs to support a hair tie without causing it to bend and potentially pinch your wrist under the squeeze of the tie. (or maybe I've over-thinking it....)<br /><br />On the plus side, I contacted to company to let them know about the metal finish coming off. Quickest. Refund. Ever. They were on top of things and I had a full refund (and a nice apology) in less than an hour.<br /><br />I wish I had more success with the product, and I would have given it 2 stars had the customer service not been excellent so kudos to them for being on the ball.<br /><br />I did receive this at a discount in return for my honest opinion and review. This is 100% my honest opinion based on my independent user review. I have no loyalties to these companies and am honest about my feelings and experiences."
3.0,"Too stretchy/fitting for me.  I was expecting a stiffer material, not so spandexy.  I returned it."
3.0,"Dress looks great on the model. In Reality , the fabric is Very thin and you can see all imperfections . I was surprised to read other 'reviews, where customers said they are going to wear it on formal events. Not to my opinion. You can decide for yourself, since it is amazon Prime , you can order and try it on ... i returned mine . As I said , it looks very elegant on the beautiful model on the photo ( with perfect body size 4) ,if you look like the model and under 30, it it for you.<br />On the other hand , what do you expect from the dress for $20?<br />If it would be done by good brand for around $100, then it would be worth buying and looked good.<br /><br />Sincerely V ."
3.0,"I like the pattern and material it is made of, not thin at all. However as I read in some reviews the arms are a little tight and it is a little bigger in the stomach area. I would of got a smaller size but there isn't much stretch in the arm sizing."
3.0,"I must say this is a stunning wrist band! The problem is I struggled with taking the link out.  My wrist is very small.  The instructions are not the best and I found it frustrating to try an adjust the wrist band. After 45 minutes, I finally adjusted the wrist band.  It should just come in the correct size (38mm), then I could have rated this much higher.  I would not recommend because of the adjustments (taking link out) otherwise, if you don't have to adjust then its fine.  It's very sturdy and was delivered on time.  Very impressed with delivery."
3.0,Not too happy with this purchase. It's an OK looking clutch. The silver embellishments are too blingy and too big. The colours of the leaf aren't as rich and blue as depicted in the picture. Maybe I should have ordered another colour that would look less blingy. The quality is really good for the price though
3.0,its a little small..trying to strtech it out
3.0,Unfortunately the piece where it’s connected to the chain snapped very easily
3.0,Super cute....except the fit.  I usually wear a medium and ordered a large for a looser fit and in case we needed to wear over a coat (outside Christmas caroling etc).  Its so short (about belly button) and yet its loose and baggy everywhere else?  I guess it was made to fit real elves?
3.0,"Cute vest, but way too small and don’t have larger sizes unfortunately. I got an XL and usually wear a size large shirt, and wanted it to be oversized and it is not- so will not be wearing."
3.0,"Opened the packaging and could clearly smell the plastic on the shoe. There was a scuff on one of the shoes right out of the box. The soul of the shoe was not very grippy, mostly plastic and stiff. The size seemed a little larger than I expected. The colors are fine, my son will like having a second pair of shoes to choose from. Purchased these because there was a 40% off coupon. Probably won't buy again, but they are a little better than what I would find at Walmart for a second ""play outside shoe so your good shoes don't get destroyed in a week"" pair of shoes."
3.0,nice stretch and comfortable. I'm a size 7 and they ran a bit large but I like my socks snug. I love the colors. I wear boring scrubs all day so I'm loving these fun socks.
3.0,Material is then. The placement of the tie in the picture is what I like about this top. The one I received was on my left side.
3.0,Material quality is a little thin cheap
3.0,I like the material. The skirt is way too big though. The waist is big and the skirt is wider than in the picture. I measured myself before selecting the size just so this did not happen. Can’t wear as is.
3.0,"I wear a medium and know often shirts like this run small so i sized up.  For extra confort i went up another size.  Sadly an XL is wearable,but super tight. Works great as a under shirt."
3.0,"they look a bit fake, the amber color looks like they actually colored it, not a natural look at all. Will be making these into ear weights for stretched ears. They also look like they will break very easily due to the very shattered look."
3.0,"Overall can be nice. However, mine arrived with creases in it that I can't stretch out and they are right in the front on the stomach so it looks bad. Might try to exchange, if not will be returning."
3.0,"I’m short (under 5’) and the small hits right at my ankles. The material is thin but not see through. It is very low cut. My biggedt complaint is that the waist line sits right under your breastbone, so it would be a good maternity dress, but not too flattering for someone not expecting. Will be keeping because it is pretty and flowy."
3.0,I ordered a 44C but the cup size was a bit too big. Not good quality material either.
3.0,El size es más pequeño de los dice la descripción
3.0,Particularly the length.
3.0,Did not like the awkward padding in the palm side of the  gloves.
3.0,The dress would be much better if the material used was a lot lighter.  The fabric is something I would look for in the winter not on a tank top type summer dress.
3.0,I have to say I was disappointed with the cheap fabric on the outside . This is the type of material that gets snagged and balled up easy . They are cheaply made in China with no inside tags
3.0,Cute top but very thin and runs a little small.
3.0,The chain broke  almost right away and the color rubbed off after 2 months
3.0,Very cute dress. However there is a whole in it behind the bow. Hope the maker if this dress will make it right for our granddaughter.
3.0,The only thing I dislike about this is the strap don’t stay connected. No matter how much I stretch they do not stay. Which it defeats the purpose of the straps. Make them a little longer.
3.0,"The flower is up on top if you want to keep your ears warm! It's a mess, but oh well.  I bought it and I'm going to wear it, but flower is oddly placed.  It will drive you crazy if you're OCD."
3.0,"The waist was too high, it kept riding upward so I made it a stay at home wear."
3.0,"The Mask is to lose on my face and does not cover my nose well, keeps sliding down."
3.0,"These are a little on the thin side, my daughter's underwear are visible under the pink and gray, it's not too obvious but probably won't let her wear them to school. I'll buy more expensive ones next time."
3.0,Quality of item is subpar
3.0,This is a little tight. I would size up.
3.0,good sandal but ugly color
3.0,Not really what I wanted.
3.0,"They do fit well and the compression is great, especially for running. But the seams began to come apart after my very first run. Very disappointed, will not buy this brand again."
3.0,"It's about 10 feet too long!!! Of course not literally, but it's definitely more than a foot too long. Can't you sell them to size?"
3.0,"While it's very pretty and I'll be wearing it often the quality is minimal. But that's reflective in the cost. The material is one sides, meaning the underside is muted. That's a cheap material. So for what you're paying for it you're getting a pretty accessory to your outfit but it probably won't last more than one season. I'm happy with it."
3.0,"I ordered this skirt for my mom's birthday that was a 60's theme, they advertise this skirt as a very long to the floor skirt and is more like a midi skirt since it doesn't go longer than half my legs, good thing is that 60's also was about midi skirts, my sister ended up using it cause even though was cute I was just disappointed at the fact that was not what I was hoping for, good things are that I got ir before expected and that was really cheap."
3.0,Really nice hat. Used it as a prop at a western themed event. Ordered the two pack but only received one hat. It was too late to reorder a second hat for the event but received a refund for the missing hat.
3.0,The top is great but the pants is soo tight I had to take out the waist stretcher inside and change it so she can wear it few times.
3.0,"Likes - color<br />Dislike - too small for my head,<br />Use - operating room"
3.0,"Not that great. The covers on both sides are rickety and the clasps do not close very well even from the very first day. I needed a gift to give that day, or else I would have sent it back. Felt like a cheap gift. Not thrilled."
3.0,"My kids love Among Us, and this was one of the only options that had adjustable ear loops, which is very important to me as I have three kids of differing ages. I guess it is okay, good enough to use without me wanting to take the trouble of returning it. If it wasn't for Covid, I would be out every day and could easily drop off the return at a UPS outlet, but it doesn't seem worth a special trip to return... though of course we wouldn't even be buying these masks if not for Covid. The print isn't great... the colors are not bright and the edges around the graphics are blurry so they images do not appear vibrant and sharp. The mask itself doesn't seem terribly well made, with rather roughly stitched edges. It has a more synthetic feel to the fabric and is very lightweight, I am not sure if this has any bearing on the effectiveness compared with regular cotton masks."
3.0,Kind of sucks if you have a fat neck 😟 I still really like them.
3.0,My baby girl loved this dress
3.0,Inserts/pads on top left a weird impression.  I took them out.  Fits great!
3.0,Like but got it late.
3.0,Pros - These are firm. They are not weak and flimsy like most sunglasses. You will find these to fit snug and be strong and sturdy. They also block sunlight out very well!<br /><br />Cons - They fit snug on me so they might not fit that well for others. If you are bigger they might be right. If you are smaller they will probably be too large.<br /><br />Conclusion - I did not have high expectations but these are pretty good sunglasses. The snug fit and sturdy build makes them a good option for volleyball and other sports.
3.0,"These earrings are lovely and simple and come in a cute gift pouch.  But they’re also a bit disappointing.  The quality control is not there, as they have been scored in various places in the bending process.  I have other similar earrings but none with this problem.  Since they are for my mom who doesn’t have the keenest eyesight and might not care, I’ll give them to her still as a cheap mother’s day gift and make sure I have something nicer come Christmas."
3.0,Delivery was way faster than I anticipated.. They look great.. Got them as a gift for my girlfriend.. She really liked them..
3.0,Too tight at my knee
3.0,I am a size 16 in dresses.  I can fit into it...but cannot breath as it cuts off my breathing.  I will have to lose about 15 pounds to fit comfortably in it.
3.0,"Based on the size chart, I selected a size recommended.  Perhaps it was due to the stretch fabric but it was too snug to fasten comfortably.  Could work for teens or young adults but not for senior who looks for class and comfort.  I will simply wear it unbutton with tank underneath or give to a younger or smaller lady."
3.0,"This dress is so pretty online, but once I got it, I knew this was not an Amazon win. :-( The shape was odd and the sizing was way off."
3.0,Very cute. But broke the same day I got it.
3.0,This Hat look warm and is comfortable. Fits a little big on me but thats ok. The one thing wrong is the quality of this hit. I have only had it for about 2 months and it looks like I have worn it for years. Yuck.
3.0,"Adorable and soft. However, ripped in several places (some seams and some just random spots) after first wear. Had to throw it away after the 3rd wear."
3.0,"This was to be a pack of 3. I only got 1 in the package. The one earmuff I got is very nice. The color is how it says. Very soft. I have I a child size head, if it was bought by  a larger person it may not fit them. Just not happy that I didn't get 3 like it said."
3.0,"Very cute , good colors , a little higher than expected for my tot but nice"
3.0,Too narrow.  Returned it. Color is also too close to blush.
3.0,They make my vision blurry after taking them off.
3.0,The zipper does not work
3.0,Fits even smaller than advertised. Quite tight and i ordered bigger than the chart said.
3.0,"Shirt quality was great except for the fact than an XL is more like a medium.  Be very aware.  Everything was usable except for the shirt. There is no give or stretch to the material.  If you are an XL,  I would look elsewhere for the shirt."
3.0,"There isn't a problem with the quality so far as I could tell, but these have a small waist band and are much larger through the hips. I had to return them unfortunately."
3.0,"This hooded sweatshirt is more lightweight than medium weight so if you are looking for warmth, look elsewhere. The material is somewhat on the stiff side and I found the sleeves to be too short. I suppose it's ok for the price but average quality at best."
3.0,While the upper part of the dress fit the lace trim around the neck did not match and there were pieces on one side that stuck out further than the other making it look unbalanced. Also the flared part of the dress was just a little too puffy for my liking.
3.0,Looked good as expected
3.0,"some of them fell apart, others were fine."
3.0,"The descriptions English,  of “ear loops” seems inaccurate...... as are the “Multi-use” photos which show actual  fabric “loops”. These neck gaiters are more like ear “slots” or ear “holes”.<br />These are a well-crafted/sewn product but need better description and photos from the side of head.  I might like these in cooler weather."
3.0,"I think these run too big. They poof out a little weird. I have worn them, but they are again, too big. An even smaller size would poof out a lot. 4/10. The quality is ok. They have not ripped apart, they are not sheer."
3.0,"I wanted to like this maxi dress so much that I ordered two of them at the same time. I should have known the material would be a little thin based on the price. I would have kept them to wear around the house on the weekend if the top of the dress wasn't so tight. I am 5'3, weigh 148lbs and bra size  34D and I purchased a size medium. The top was too tight for my liking. I didn't want to buy a size  large because it would have been too long."
3.0,"Está más gruesa que el tamaño normal de las correas, si tienes brazo delgado se ve muy tosca<br />El elástico pica"
3.0,"This purse is huge - if you don't zip it closed. What I like - is that the center zipper actually separates the two sides of the purse. It is heavy duty and can be worn as a shoulder / cross body or held with the built in handles. What I didn't like - the zipper is sewn so close to the top sides that you can not put nearly as much as you think you can if you actually want to close it. It also doesn't stand up by itself.  I was really looking forward to getting this bag. It comes with a dust cover, but the dust cover it comes with is not the right one (or someone ordered it and replaced the wrong dust cover on it,) because you can't even slide the whole purse in there much less cover the purse with it. It has a nice lining and heavy duty metal ware, but it just wasn't at all what I was expecting based on the measurements or the pictures online. The leather also felt very greasy."
3.0,"I'm torn, I really really loved this scarf and wish I could give it 5 stars because it's so soft and pretty. Sadly, mine had stitching on the outline coming completely undone straight out of the package. It's only a matter of time before it comes unraveled and as a matter of fact already has fibers loosening. I included a photo so others can see what I'm talking about. If it weren't for the poor outer stitching, I would be in LOVE. It's the same exact design as Burberry but at a fraction of the price. Its nice and long too. I'm not sure what material is used but it feels almost like a wool. Though for the price point, I would say it's more than likely a really soft polyester :)<br /> I'm going to attempt to stitch it myself and maybe this was just one that slipped through the cracks."
3.0,great for a gift and for the quality of the hat is really nice.
3.0,It’ll work for my costume but it had a very strong chemical smell so I put it in a protective laundry bag and at least half of the stars fell off. So DO NOT wash it but you will def need to spray it with Febreeze or something. It’s also very long but pretty small around the waist. Probably a better cape than a skirt
3.0,Waist fit great but the leg opening squeezed my quads like sausages.  Not cute. Had to return. Might work for someone with very thin legs.
3.0,Ordered the smallest size (9) though I’m an 8.5<br />The slippers are great except they feel bigger then being a half size to big
3.0,it is not exactly like in the picture; it should be pink but it is more gray than ping<br />and very dark
3.0,"Pro:It is cheap, and simple to install.  But that is true for most of NATO straps.<br /><br />Cons: it’s rather stiff and not comfortable.  I wish I just bought a more expensive one ."
3.0,The shirt will shrink by a lot when you wash it
3.0,I'm a 31 waist.<br />These are super cute but the fit is weird.<br />I ordered a medium. Back is leaning towards being cheeky and front has almost same cut as the back...<br />Quality seems to be ok
3.0,"The charm is beautiful, but the color blue on the pic and the blue on the charm look different. It is a lighter shade of blue."
3.0,Ya very  tiny but cute
3.0,"but to wide at the shoulders and a bit tight in the upper arm... next size up would be way too big...  not sure why wo wide in the shoulders yet tight in the arms.... loved the pattern, but returned it with no hassle"
3.0,I'm 5'4&#34; and the dress is super long and I had to wait forever for it to arrive.
3.0,Good product but the size is way out of whack.  Very big and tall also. Fabric is thin also
3.0,I ended up returning this. It was not large enough for my 15.6&#34; laptop and the outside was very stiff. Please doublecheck the dimensions as it was much smaller then I thought it would be.
3.0,not enough support to wear without the straps
3.0,"Really more of a yellow than an amber lens. Quite uncomfortable until I removed the foam piece on the inside. Nicely packaged with a case, bag, strap, small screwdriver and cleaning cloth. I suspect the accessories are worth more than the glasses."
3.0,"Cute, but not what I expected"
3.0,"They are nice, thin pants."
3.0,"If I was 5 inches taller, I'd give this five stars. It was prudishly long on my 5&#34;3, slender frame. Which is a crying shame because the fabric is nice and the dress itself if sure. If you are tall, I am sure it would be great."
3.0,"Well it certainly is pretty and colorful. I don't think I will wear it because the material is coarse and stiff, so it doesn't fall like a scarf should. So I would not recommend buying it to wear. It is thick nylon. I am not returning it because I can use it in my home décor as a decoration...perhaps over my screen blinds  as a dressing on top of the window. You could also use it as a decorative cloth or sew a couple of pillows out of the fabric."
3.0,"Needed to get a new belt for my costume, as the one I got with it was way too long for me to wear. This was a much better fit on me, but was veering towards the small side. I have a 32"" waist, and was only to barely able get to the 3rd hole from the start.<br /><br />I really despised how they folded up the belt for shipping, there's 3 noticeable creases on the belt, and they probably won't ever come out. It also got a crease from fastening the belt just once, and will definitely get worse over time. The belt's material doesn't even feel very good, and there's a logo stamped into the metal of the buckle which looks ugly (and is noticeable). The katana holder feels like a better material than the belt, but I'm cosplaying as Tengen, so I won't be using it.<br /><br />It at least functions as a belt, and is something that I can actually wear. This is quite literally the most basic belt you can get for a Demon Slayer cosplay, as it covers the bare minimums of what you need. You really should only get this if you have a smaller waist size, and just need a belt for the costume. I'd much prefer the belt that came with my costume (since it was a much better material), but since I can't wear it, this one will have to do."
3.0,The bottoms were way too small. The top fit okay.
3.0,"It does the job but the pictures make it seem like it'll be a bit more stylish than it is. No care instructions.<br /><br />Also, I had kinda forgotten I ordered this a few months ago. Took forever to get, FAR longer than anything else I had ordered from Amazon."
3.0,"Cute dress. Runs a bit large, but overall nice fit. Just watch out for gusts of wind as dress flys up easily. Only thing, and this is sort of a deal breaker, it's hand wash only. For a $15 dress that seems absurd. Makes wearing it a hassle."
3.0,These glasses are super cute. I ordered two pairs.but they fit kinda tight around my face. Other then that I like the glasses
3.0,It ripped so fast
3.0,"I bought this watch because I felt it was unique. It is a cute watch especially for the price,  but the biggest downfall is that it was very big and the links had to be removed manually.  I didn't want to pay for someone to adjust as this is just a fashion piece,  plus most places won't work on watches unless watch was purchased from them.  I ended up watching a YouTube video to see how I could remove links myself; for me it was difficult and time consuming to remove the links,  but I did it and I now wear it as planned and haven't had any trouble so far.  Just wish it would've had removable links like all other watches."
3.0,I like the chain but I thought it was going to be a little thicker and stronger and the clasp should be a little stronger.
3.0,Just like other reviews the model must be wearing one at least 2 sizes too big. It's not nearly as long as one would hope and the material is very thin. But you get what you pay for.<br />I'll definitely wear it because the colored sleeves are super cute but I would never order another.
3.0,"To small.. it fit but it was tight, and then the material is the type to snag a lot and gets hot in the dress fast. I order I believe the short sleeve and recieved the long one. No way I could dance in that, I was overheating already when dress was on.<br />It is cute tho."
3.0,"The color is not gray as stated.  It is more of a denim blue.  Pretty but not what I was wanting.  Had ordered shoes to match, that now obviously do not."
3.0,Es como se ve en la foto
3.0,they're were stiff. some broke easily. i like the variety though.
3.0,"The shirts fit just right! I tried on each color to see how each one looked. I got to the last one and noticed a smell. This wasn’t a normal factory smell either. I took the shirt off and smelled around for a minute and sure enough, the darn thing smelled like BO right around my chest area. So bummed!!! It’s like some dude with no deodorant decided to try on my shirt before taking it off and putting it in the shipping bag. I plan on returning this nasty thing!!!"
3.0,The item looks great but are to small for her. I guess I will be donating them to her dance studio and buying a new pair.
3.0,Runs about 2 sizes smaller than expected.
3.0,"I am having a hard time getting used to these masks. When I breathe, the layer closest to my face seems to get sucked into my mouth or against my nostrils. I cut off the filter pouch on one of them to see if it would help. I'm just trying to make do since I'm not sure I can return masks I washed and wore and cut out the filter pocket from.<br /><br />It also does sometimes fog my glasses. I have to try different positions to find comfort while wearing the mask.<br />Looking forward to the day when COVID19 fades into history and I can get rid of masks altogether."
3.0,"I love the style of this dress, however it is not true to size. It runs small. My biggest disappointment is the quality. It's very, very thin."
3.0,"Color was a little off.  Instead of bright white it had a ""blue"" tint."
3.0,"Hat leather had a good feel.  The crown was too tall, with a telescoping look. Hat had no firmness in shape."
3.0,Reordered larger size
3.0,i have already returned the large size exchanging it for XL
3.0,Good for rainy says
3.0,"I've tried a couple different types of this similar product, and they don't work for me.  Using even the closet buttonhole, the gap at the top of the zipper is too wide to get the zipper close to closed."
3.0,This bag is very small and looks bad in person. Looks more plastic like in person and I have no use for it. Not exactly what I imagined.
3.0,"It is very difficult to use on the visor.  The video made it look simple.  When you don't want the visor, it is difficult to flip it up with this device on."
3.0,This honestly didn't look like what I thought it would.  Seemed a little cheap but I wore it and got tons of complements.
3.0,Super cute. I wasn’t able to use some cause as soon as I tried to wear one they would break. The others lasted a while until they broke. Down to the plastic ones that don’t have the lock to break and the rope looking one that you tie.
3.0,"Well made, soft, warm, but I have full calves and although they stretched some they cut into my leg. I also got a pair for my granddaugter. She loves them and they fit her well. A good purchase just be cautious if you don't have skinny calves."
3.0,"Pretty basic.  Thin material and no sweat band.  However, the product price matches so this is a decent purchase."
3.0,Very small head size. Fine hat. Not adult sized
3.0,"What I disliked about the jacket was that it was very wrinkled and  larger than the silver one I ordered which fit perfectly.  Also, it was closed in a peculiar way it  was closed with double stick tape and a safety pin.  It does however close no problem with the closures."
3.0,They were uglier than I expected in person and too tight
3.0,"This is a cute dress, and true to size.  The fabric however is so rough that I doubt I will reach for it often."
3.0,"These headbands are cute, but they stretch with wear and slip off of my head (most headbands do this for me). I use these to wash my hair/wear around the house."
3.0,The chain was a little shorter than expected and the charm wasn't as defined. But it was a very good product
3.0,This was a great gift but after wearing it for 2 weeks and it has stopped working.
3.0,"Not waterproof, became wet after 5 mins under the light rain. Water resistant to some degree."
3.0,"I'm 5'5"" and 130lbs for reference. Purchased a small. I think it looks really cute. However, it's definitely on the tight side and tends to roll down on me at the waist during the workout. After the first wash, the armpit seam split open. I bought this set to have something warmer to wear to the gym but it's not warm at all. The fabric has a lot of mesh."
3.0,"This is a nice enough cap with a in-style design. The fabric is good quality too, but the bill of the hat is too small for me.  I like larger bills on my hats on order to keep the sun glare out of my eyes.<br />Other than that, this is a pretty generic, regular hat good for everyday wear."
3.0,Item received didn't have inner pocket for filter.
3.0,No trae los cubiertos
3.0,I love how the top of the shirt is made....the bottom is a little awkward but overall it is a nice fitting top.
3.0,Like the sock  didn’t like the fact I spent my money and sock was a bit small
3.0,"The gloves  are of high quality leather, beautiful to look at, but they are useful for touchscreen."
3.0,"Cut dress, but not for me a woman with class...I will leave this to the younger woman...."
3.0,"Quality is ok. Material wrinkles and stains very easily. Fit was good overall. I’m 5’6”, 180lbs, 36DD and 35” waist. Large was a snug but flattering fit. I wish the material were better quality, I really enjoy the cut of this dress."
3.0,"They are cute, but they leave painful indentations on your calves from the EKG pattern seams. I wear them inside out so the seams don’t press on my leg...but then it doesn’t look as cute."
3.0,"They look super cute in the picture, they were super cute in the package, they were super cute on the watch. However I don’t like the way they fit me and the fabric felt weird on my skin. I’m sensitive to different types of fabric and so I returned these."
3.0,ok !!
3.0,The metal parts of the locket and the chain are excellent.  The round middle piece is a picture under glass except the the glass cover is plastic and looks it.  Definitely worth 4.99 but not worth the shipping.  It comes so close to being amazing.
3.0,"The cardigan fit much better than I expected after reading previous reviews.  I don't like cardigans to look too bulky and to help create a figure flattering form.  This one does just that.  The only complaint that I have is that because the material is a jersey knit, layering over short or long sleeves bunch under the cardi and show through.<br /><br />I might try getting one in a larger size to see if that helps.  Otherwise, I think it's extremely comfy and flattering."
3.0,I like it but it's quite large. Had to belt it and wear with leggings!
3.0,Not a bad shirt.  Slim fit.
3.0,Was bigger than I expected and to long but for what it cost I can alter it👍🏻
3.0,[[VIDEOID:cad29efe6bbdcc29d13085faf6d87910]] Can barely read the first 3 words. Everything else looks legible. Disappointed because this was supposed to be a gift for my daughter.
3.0,Shrinks very easily I dont recommend drying in the dryer.
3.0,"I really do like these straps. they make it easy and more comfortable when wearing a mask. I do however have a problem of where they are made and come from. They say Fast Shipping - Shipped from IN, USA receive it within 3-7 days. No matter which delivery option. I ordered these in April and I only received theses on May 29th. I know there is a virus going on. But when I got the package it was from China. They should be honest of where they are made and shipped. Because I trying to support American businesses and made right now. Very misleading. This is why I an only giving it a 3 stars. I would of gave 4 stars"
3.0,Very cute purse. Vibrant color. Sturdy enough hardware. Only problem (and this sealed the deal of me returning it) is its too small in size.
3.0,I only wear a size 6 and this just seems to fit.  I don't know if they would work if your foot is much bigger.
3.0,Too small sizes are about 2 sizes smaller than advertising.
3.0,very pretty but sizing was way off..
3.0,For the price they are.... ok very cheap feeling and looking. Tried to pass them off on my 12 year old niece and was told they were too ugly.......
3.0,"They color isn't as great as the pink and green pairs.  They look purple on the computer screen, but in person they are more of a light smoky grey.  Not much to look at."
3.0,This dress doesnt look like the picture but it is pretty comfortable
3.0,All I can say so far is that what I got is NOT navy blue.  It's like a bright royal blue.
3.0,Comfy but runs small
3.0,Sized way to large for newborn
3.0,"They are like the picture almost. Mine are 3” below my navel. I’m 5’4”. So not tall, for the 2 that are the right size they fit great and very comfortable and pretty. Then there is the black pair. Material not as stretchy and a size smaller. I bought what was supposed to be a 7. The tags are the same on all three pairs."
3.0,"First off, this is a pretty decent product. I was pretty happy with its quality and condition when it arrived. I also really liked the little box it came in. This was a gift for a little girl I babysit so I thought it was very cute and fun. I have small wrists and it fit me on the last clasp. I'm crossing my fingers that my wrists are close to the same size as hers. The only down fall that I found with this bracelet was the coloring. I realize now that the title of it says that it is cream and white. I was thrown off because in the picture it is more pink. I was actually pretty disappointed. The bracelet was more of an off white with dull creamy color. I do not think any child would be in love with the coloring; I know I wasn't. Overall, I am disappointed because it is a really cute bracelet. I would not purchase again."
3.0,"The hat is really nice, it's just not the color as described and pictured in ad."
3.0,No es lo que se describe la tela se transparenta mucho y aparte una talla menos seria mejor que nada
3.0,"These sunglasses are great for my 5 year old, but they're a bit flimsy and did not come with the case as advertised."
3.0,"I'm sure it is a good product, somehow, if only we would get instructions on how it works."
3.0,"It's a bit lumpy and shapeless -- or maybe that's just my head. Anyway, it's kind of ill-fitting, but it does keep me warm."
3.0,Mama bear is a good fit. The man cub head opening is large.
3.0,"I have an older pro shirt which is fantastic in fit, cut and function.  This new one not so much. The V neck is very low, the sleeves are much tighter than the older one and almost uncomfortable in their tightness and the material is thinner.  Not happy"
3.0,"The product was just as described however, it doesn't say what the strength of the lens is and it is very very strong, probably a 2.50.  I had to return them because of this but Amazon made it very easy to do so and promptly refunded my purchase price."
3.0,Got this as a gift for my sister she’s a huge Garfield fan she love it but says it’s has a huge gap underneath chin so not very protective unless she double up on the masks
3.0,My husband wanted them for his work boots and they would not go down in his boots.
3.0,i feel like for the price i paid this is a low quality shirt. it’s soft but it’s see through and loooks like it will rip fast. also sizing is off i’m usually a XL and it fit me so fitted/tight  and I am a D cup and my chest area was so tight :/ i’d pass and buy something cheaper and better
3.0,Well made and attractive but a little small!!
3.0,These are a little on the thin side but great for being able to wash when needed.
3.0,It fits kind of funny. The clamp is a bit hard to put on.
3.0,"Vibrant color and I like it, but the material was so itchy, especially the sleeves. I had to return it."
3.0,I wasn’t as impressed with this purse as I thought I would be.  Some of the zippers were pretty close to not working.  One of the inside pockets was half sewn up so it wasn’t as accessible as I’d like and overall it just seemed a little cramped.  Love the purple<br />Color though
3.0,"It's ok, but feel cheep"
3.0,"I have a big head.  lol.  I bought three of these, and the other two fit but this one did not.  The light blue was about a full inch less length to go around the head by comparison to the other two I bought!  Crazy.  So I haven't been able to wear it.  I plan on buying some Velcro from Walmart and sewing it onto the hat to lengthen it so I can wear it!  It will look crappy in the back but I'll have to live with that!  Otherwise, I do love this item...when it fits!"
3.0,They're cheap...but they do what they say they do!
3.0,They fall to easily
3.0,Sizes were not accurate too small and too big
3.0,doesnt perfectly cup around boobs so it doesnt look as sexy
3.0,"We ordered lots of these tank tops for a big group. They feel like a good quality, other than the design having a slight plasticy feel to it. The only issue we had was the XXL all had a super thin design so the white stripes were see through and looked very badly. We ordered 5 of each size and the XXL were the only ones with problems."
3.0,I got the rose gold one and its more of a glittery pink.  I didn't like it at all.  I was expecting what was pictured.  The quality of the color was bad.  It looked as if the pain was going to fall off.  I returned.
3.0,"Too loose, but maybe my ears are just small? Fell off constantly."
3.0,It’s very flimsy and breaks fast
3.0,The lenses pop out pretty easily
3.0,Quality not all there somewhat tacky
3.0,Easier just to wear regular reading glasses
3.0,I had to return this item was definitely more of a yellow and a weird tan shade than ivory.
3.0,"I bought this for my daughter for her birthday. It is very pretty, the design on it is awesome, but I didn't check the dimensions of the necklace. It is huge! My daughter thought it was pretty as well and she told me liked it, but she only wore it on the day of her birthday and has not worn it since. It is definitely designed for a man. I wouldn't let this review say that you shouldn't purchase this piece, because it is beautiful and well made."
3.0,Looks like the picture but material is made for summer
3.0,"Too big and too long. I thought these would fit nicely and look proper but they are kinda baggy like skater shorts.. Not my type, I'd like to return them and receive my full refund. Thanks."
3.0,Run small so order next size up
3.0,Faded really quickly! Ran a little small.
3.0,"Very cute dress, fits nicely on my 5y.o. princess. The back is made of crisp, contrasting white polyester, and looks a bit cheap and costum-ey. The picture of the crystal shoe is a bit fuzzy and leaves enough room for viewers' imagination to conjure the image of the favorite princess - Elsa, Cinderella, or Cher.<br /><br />The dress barely lasted a week of very occasional Halloween wear. It has been in exactly one wash (gentle, in a baggy). It is the evening of the Halloween, and the costume is already falling apart at the seems.<br /><br />The bodice is made of thin smooth polyester - non-breathing and sweaty, but also soft to touch.  The puffy sleeves and skirt are made of scratchy harsh mesh-like material.The dress is pullover-style, with three small buttons on the bottom of the body. One button started getting stuck the very first time I tried to close it, and now only one of the remaining buttons closes.<br /><br />It was a cute dress for one Halloween, but I won't miss it."
3.0,"I liked the dress, lightweight.....but it isn't designed for a curvy figure.  Very straight lines bust through hips"
3.0,"Lots of good things about these -- good support, adjustable, well made.  I actually have these in a different color and softer leather and they are quite nice, very comfortable and supportive yet not unattractive in an &#34;I need ortho sandals&#34; kind of way.  These patent Pampas were a bargain and the shiny color a bit fun BUT they have to go back because my delicate feet could not abide the thick, stiff leather used in the patent.  The toe loop in particular was an issue for me with this pair; I don't have any issue with the softer &#34;plain&#34; leather design Pampa.  The Pampa style itself is great, very comfortable, good arch support, attractive sandal."
3.0,hat was too snug on my 9 month old and outfit was too big yet which is fine so just watch sizes when buying :-) shipping took a long time also! but im happy with the outfit because it has dolphins on it!
3.0,"Works well, but the crotch area was longer than it should be. I bought mine two sizes larger because I was unable to fit into my last one that I purchased which was a medium in adults. It was pretty much the equivalent of someone who wears a size 5 dress squeezing into a size 0.<br /><br />The leg area though is quite snug."
3.0,Really comfy but some sparkles were missing and the beige color is more like yellow
3.0,"Not the best, I probably won’t wear it cause it was awkward on Me. But it was good material"
3.0,"The print wasn’t the best quality, but then again the material didn’t allow it to be. It’s big enough to cover my nose, mouth and chin so I suppose it serves the original purpose"
3.0,These have very good cushioning and were a great value but they are definitely not made for wide feet like mine. I will try to wear them around the house and break them in a bit but I worry that I will have to give them away to someone with narrower feet.
3.0,I love the colors I like the style but I wish it was in a different material this material is very heavy and cannot be worn in humidity like it is in North Carolina in August. Good for fall and winter I would think of the colors are summer
3.0,Ordered medium and received what looked like XS with NO size on garment at all (no labels at all) - could hardly get both arms into garment - color was good - fabric maybe little iffy.
3.0,No padding inside and was larger than expected. Was disappointed in them for the price
3.0,Love them but too bad it's not the color I order..
3.0,I thought it showed the date which it doesn't and which is disappointing. I wanted an inexpensive watch that when the lens gets scratched it's not a big deal. It keeps good time so it fulfills  a need.
3.0,Very Cute but Lint in every stitches. My daughter looked really good on this with the Stuffed Totoro.
3.0,A large would be too big.  I would like to return it.
3.0,"It came broken. Don't feel like going through the trouble of exchange, I can glue it together."
3.0,they look very nice but I'm allergic to nickel and I had to take them off right after putting them in my ears. I returned them immediately.
3.0,They do a great job of keeping your shoes from flopping but they show a bit more than expected.
3.0,"I was hoping that this would be bigger, I didn't recall a description of the size, but when i got it the first thing I thought, was wow this is small."
3.0,The overall product very nice love the satin look but the strings are too short so kinda unhappy with that but ok👍🏻
3.0,My wife didn't like it.  Said it made her look pregnant
3.0,No queda tan bonito al cuerpo
3.0,"It is super cute but you get what you get for the price. Sadly the sipper inside for the coins broke 2 a couple of weeks later, but I don't mind it."
3.0,"This is a ok cell purse, I don’t like the strap and my iPhone will not work with the plastic cover, other than that it is ok"
3.0,Uncomfortable and too small.
3.0,"Sweater itself seemed soft and stylish. Ordered for my petite wife as a Xmas gift. She normally takes a size small, but ordered a medium by mistake. When she tried it on, the sleeves (which on the models fall halfway down their palms) came to just below the elbows.  The pockets sagged and hung funny off the sweater. It was a disappointing mess. Promptly returned."
3.0,OK quality
3.0,"Really cute and well made, bottoms fit really well, but if your even a little above average height it will be too short for your torso, I’m only 5’6 and it was too short, bummer cuz I really liked it"
3.0,"These are beautiful, graceful and fun earrings.  I loved everything about them--EXCEPT THE POST which didn't fit in my piercing openings and which caused the earrings to hang in an unattractive fashion.  I think I could love them again if they were mounted on a standard wire.  Alas, I had to send them back."
3.0,Buckle keeps fulling off
3.0,"Pants were fine. Not Jean's at all more of a stretchy material. Now while all that's fine and dandy, it came dirty. How does a new product come dirty?"
3.0,"The outfit is cute, however it looks nothing like the picture. From the look of the picture you think the top is sort of oversize and crunch at the arms. The top stops exactly at the waist it isn't long at all and its definitely not enough material to tie in a not. Although i will keep it, the style of which its presented is the reason i bought it. The material is shinny spandex. I thought it was  cotton."
3.0,"I had ordered the red and floral print in what I thought would be the same style, but this one is a lot less cheeky and not quite as flattering as the red. It surprised me that they weren't the same cut. This one fits more like a fairly traditional bikini."
3.0,Nice fabric and the bottoms fit great but the top was ridiculously tight.  Disappointing.
3.0,"The good: they fit well in my sm ladies helmet, great for full sunny days<br />The  Bad: not the best goggle for low light skiing, wish it had detached yellow lenses .  Now the ugly. The exterior is a thin film that scratches way too easy.  the goggles come wth a secure case but both times the scratches  occurred while adjusting  my  ski goggles on my face.  I never fell, never threw them in my ski bag in fact I put my helmet and goggles on in my condo and catch a shuttle to the mountains.  I always wrap my fleece around my goggles IF I take off my helmet on the mountain soo we are talking absolutely no abuse"
3.0,"Usually, quality items that have stripes, line up. These don't. These are very thin material and getting them wet may be an embarrassment to the wearer. Wearing them around the house would be fine. How they fit, don't know. I will give them to the Boy to see if he wants to wear them."
3.0,"I didn't really like this scarf, it wasn't has full looking as I thought it was going to be.. in the picture it looks way better, plus it was not that long enough and I just didn't really like it.. but the plus is that it was cheap and it came really fast! it also had really cute cat print. I also used it has a headband, and it seem it work better than a scarf."
3.0,Doesn’t clean well if you get dirt on it.. so sad
3.0,"This purse is gorgeous but hot darn, I cannot fit anything in it! This fits the bare essentials. I'm talking about keys, phone, and a large wallet (I have a Lux de Ville wallet and it barely fits in here). Have anything else to hold? Look elsewhere. Otherwise the design and color look so chic! I love the detail that Lux puts into their handbags. This purse also has feet so you don't have to worry about it getting gross if you have to set it down."
3.0,"It's a really cute top, but it was much smaller than I expected and i can't wear.  I will give to one of my smaller neices so they can appreciate!"
3.0,"To loose around chest had to pin it in the back, length  was good tho!"
3.0,didn't fit ear as well as I would have liked
3.0,Smaller than describe
3.0,"My 3 year old picked this out as her face mask. It’s got a cute design, but does not stay on her face. She has to hold it on her nose/face. It’s cute though and good for quick trips inside places that require face mask for kids in the time of COVID."
3.0,Looks cuter in the picture... I haven’t worn yet it’s not as flattering as I hoped.
3.0,"Loves how online it shows this necklace twinkling and moving, however mine does not unless it is a certain position that is not on my neck"
3.0,They're overall good but the knit is loose so it is easy to wear holes in the toes and heels. But they do everything wool does.
3.0,looks as cheap as it is.
3.0,"Bought an XL for my bf for a cocktail attire event we're going out of state for this coming Thursday. It was too small on him; fit more like a medium, he said. He can't even get it buttoned closed. Disappointed. It looks nice and well made, but not at all the size advertised. A waste of money, and now I'm not sure what to do about his outfit for the event because there's no time to buy something else."
3.0,Lovely socks but just barely above my knee. Model must have skinny legs
3.0,it was prettier than I thought it would be.  Problem once you get it on its almost impossible to detach the magnet you need to use a pointed knife & being on your wrist you could really hurt yourself.
3.0,Band is a bit long
3.0,Not as bright of colors I had thought it would be. Bought for my girlfriend so I won’t be wearing it but in my hands feels really soft and warm a little on thin side overall I’m happy with purchase just colors aren’t as bright as the picture
3.0,"I bought these because they were made in the USA, had a more attractive look than the Oofos slip-on, and appeared online to be very similar to my Oofos that I love. These are very cushy, so they will still relieve tension when I wear them in the kitchen while cooking for hours, but they do not have the support or offer the relief that the Oofos provide and I missed that when I put these on."
3.0,Everything was well. The watch is absolutely gorgeous. Sadly it's not running. I assume the battery is dead.
3.0,"In the 2 packs I received, the red and blue shirts are great, but both of the brown shirts are uneven. When wearing them or laying them out, you can definitely feel/see  the defect, so I can't wear them.<br />Having ordered four different sets from this company, 12 shirts, only the two brown ones are messed up, however. I really like the rest."
3.0,"Product came on time, the closure was easy to use and it was cute…. It was just too tight for a conche piercing (10mm). I wanted it to work…."
3.0,Had a lot of wrinkles and after ironing I wore for a short time ad it was quit wrinkled again.<br />Not the flowing great pack and travel item I expected<br />I would not buy another one
3.0,"Although the watch is really nice looking, the face is huge and looks awkward on a slender person"
3.0,These said S/M. I also ordered M/L for my husband.  Both sets were similar in size.  I have small feel and these are really too big for me.
3.0,"I was a little disappointed in the way it was made. I think self lining it would be nicer, It still worked good for putting all my things I needed to put in it to shower at the campground."
3.0,The band keeps coming undone
3.0,"Returned, to Small, but so cute."
3.0,Love the look and feel but sadly the clasp broke about 1 week after purchase.
3.0,"Didn't like the odd feel of this wallet and it had poor stitching that didn't look like it would hold up long term, so I returned it immediately. I probably didn't give it a fair shake, but it's nice to have free returns because this product is not for everyone."
3.0,Fun for an 8 year old!
3.0,"Overall, it's a good product and would have been perfect, except for the fact that they are selling these with the wrong chess pieces attached. They have a queen attached to the king version and vice versa. To the product seller: the piece with the cross/plus on top is the king. The other one is the queen.<br /><br />I ordered this as a gift for my son to give my wife for mother's day, as he and I both love chess. He was the one who noticed and was a bit disappointed that it wasn't right."
3.0,Its pretty but the material is cheat and it runs really big. I wear a 14 and I ordered a large it's more for a person that is an 18+ it was delivered to the wrong house luckily. I have nice neighbor
3.0,I am giving 3 because one of the earrings was broken. Apart from that it was lovely piece. I am not fortunate enough to have it.
3.0,These are just ok.  They are a bit bigger than the photo makes them appear so consider that if you have lots of holes in your ears.
3.0,Too small. I ordered a large and I usually wear a medium. I couldn’t even zip up the zipper. Definitely not for bigger chested women. A cup absolutely.  B cup maybe.
3.0,Photo looks better than In person.
3.0,"I went by all of the other review to simply get a larger size. It wasn't the case for me at all. I am typically a size M in womens clothing , but other reviews recommend the size up , so I ordered a Large. Big mistake , far too loose and unflattering .  The fabric also isn't good and is quite uncomfortable ."
3.0,The hat was okay. It was VERY tight.
3.0,"They work with not getting fog on glasses, but, buy a smaller side if available cause there very big in size, too big for me, a female, but it works and fits on my face but just big."
3.0,I liked the look of the top BUT the sizing is WAY TOO SMALL. I got a large (this is my usual size) and it is more a Small size. So sad because the top is cute.
3.0,These run small according to the size chart.
3.0,"While I really like this bathing suit I feel it runs a tad small. Also when I received it, it only came with the top. Very disappointed. I returned with no issues."
3.0,"I loved the packaging and the earrings look beautiful, however the clear earring back did not have a hole punched all the way threw so when I tried to put the back on to hold the earring it bent the earring."
3.0,Fits great. The material is not very thick and somewhat transparent making me uncomfortable during exercise.
3.0,"I bought these to use at night to keep my hair from getting damaged. And while I wish I could tell you all how that went, they were too small to fit both my head and my hair (I tie my hair up on top of my head at night; it's thick 3A hair that goes past my chest). I could wrap them around my head without my hair tied up and they'd be a bit loose but there's not enough room for my hair when its up which is the whole reason I got them. For those of you with smaller heads, thinner or less hair, or who just want to tie them around your head I think these will work beautifully for that purpose which is why I gave a neutral 3-star review.<br /><br />What I can say about them: they are very smooth and silky, however the insides aren't as smooth (I saw another reviewer mention turning them inside out and think that's a smart idea). There's a bit of elastic in the back which gives you some wiggle room and the ties are pretty long (they wrapped around my head twice with a few inches left to tie a bow). They're also really pretty (I got the black and pink combo and they look exactly like the photos). Overall, I would buy these if you think they'll fit your head and hair, or if you just want to wrap them around with your hair down. If they were just a bit bigger I'd recommend them 100% to anyone and everyone.<br /><br />Pros: silky, pretty colors, not too expensive, elastic plus ties to ensure a good fit.<br /><br />Cons: too small to tie your hair up if you have a bigger head, and the insides aren't silky/as smooth."
3.0,"pants are a tad cheap but love, love the top.."
3.0,"The dress arrived within 2 days. It fits perfectly. The problem is the cord to lace up the dress was not included. I tried contacting the seller but was told their email was not working.  If they dont send me the cording then I'll get my own, which costs me more. I'd really like this resolved!"
3.0,Too small for the hats I wanted to pin them on.
3.0,"My SO tried these: XL/L. He wears a size 12 shoe and has health conditions that dictate the need for compression socks. He found these easier to get on than his regular brand, so was happy about that. He liked the patterns too. For him, they were tighter around the calf but looser around the ankle. So that didn't work for his needs. The biggest problem he had was all the loose threads inside the socks from the different coloured threads. He found these to be annoying. Says he won't switch brands."
3.0,I liked the shirt. just need a bigger size
3.0,"The mask part is great.  The plastic shield is terrible, you can't see through it clearly.  My granddaughter unsnapped and removed the shield and uses only the masks.  They're from China.  Too bad one part is inferior."
3.0,I don’t think it’s flattering. Maybe if I went down a size? But overall not a fan.
3.0,Nice suit. Needs a better way to measure size.
3.0,"Not as WOW as I had hoped. There is really nothing wrong with it, but its not special, either. If I had seen it in a store, I probably would not have purchased it. Delivery was quick and hassle free."
3.0,"While the pattern is lovely, it started rubbing off fairly quickly. I think I wore this for about a month and I'm not exactly rough on my fitbit. The actual material is nice, flexible and comfortable.  It was a bit difficult to install as well, as it was very tight- fitting to the fitbit.  However, once on, I didn't have any troubles with it."
3.0,"It wasn’t the style for me, though I can see why some may like it. The twist on the bottom of the shirt made it shorter than it shows on the model, and caused it to hit on an unflattering angle on my hips. I ended up returning, but that’s because I prefer longer tops."
3.0,"Very itchy seams, couldn't stop scratching. Otherwise very comfortable"
3.0,"My daughter is at the terrible stage where she is too big for girls' clothing and too young to be forced to wear women's more mature clothing :( I was worried because she is barely fitting into Target's 14/16 sized clothing. I ordered these, with fingers crossed, because they offered free returns. Sadly, though she LOVED the swimsuits, they hurt her shoulders, as they were just too short, lengthwise."
3.0,Too loose at bottom
3.0,"Large and floppy, My son never wore it."
3.0,Size up as a fits a little snug
3.0,It is too bad that these dresses run so small because they are really cute. the fabric is thick and seems like it would last a long time.
3.0,It isn't as long as it appears!
3.0,"This dress is really cute but even though I sized up it still ran small. It would have worked for my event with shapers, but there was a rip at the top of the slit. I could have easily exchanged it but it would've been too late for my event."
3.0,Cheaply made.  Not as nice as traditional converse.
3.0,Too small not very soft
3.0,the glasses fit me just right very dark just how i like them. only thing the locs logo on one of the sides comes of and falls of easily
3.0,"This umbrella is basic, but a good deal. It is well made and seems sturdy. It also shipped quickly. The only problem is the wood is painted a flat orange/terra cotta color which makes the wood look cheap and almost plastic. For 70 bucks it's hard to complain though. I've seen similiar umbrellas with stained wood for $100 so if I had to do it all over again I would have spent the extra money."
3.0,Light & flimsy. Kids party on for decorating
3.0,"Ordered these as arthritis made it impossible to pull on regular compression socks. Unfortunately, these were no better, as they were so tight I could not pull up the zipper. Had to return for refund :(."
3.0,"My husband got this watch as a present; it;s just like one he used to have.  Pros: great price, light weight, easy to set--he's pleased to be able to see when the alarm's turned OFF.  Cons: I'm sure the band won't last long; the lighted face lights up only on one little spot on the left-hand side, so you can see the hour but not much else; band is a little short--he's a large but not fat person; booklet says not to expose it to water, while the face says ""water resist,"" so who knows. Not fabulous, but works for us."
3.0,"These are so cute and fit perfectly,  but not very comfortable.  The slightly padded insole was too lumpy in the center and caused the sandal to be uncomfortable.  Had to return them."
3.0,Nice heavy flannel but too big. Cannot keep on my shoulders. Boobs fall out even with safety pinning. Definitely need to size down. I ordered a 3 x but will reorder a 1x.
3.0,"After wearing the studs for a few weeks, they began to tarnish or turn black which I've found with other brands of this item. Not sure I'd purchase the nose ring studs again."
3.0,"My gift to my son is late, it ruined everything. Makes no sense I give him his gift. Please may I have a refund. I got multiple emails saying it was gonna be late and yes it was very late."
3.0,Loved sweater when it arrived. Due to covid I hand washed it with baby wash laid to dry on a towel over night. Next day it did not look the same. It had piles all over and it is an itchy sweater. Love the style arms are tight.
3.0,"This is a very cute idea for a baseball cap.  Unfortunately, I really don't like baseball caps with a mesh back - not feminine enough and reminds me of what truck drivers wear.  But, the sequins are sparkly and the little ears are cute.  I think it would have been better to have sewn all the sequins on a cloth baseball cap.  But, if you like mesh backed caps then this cap should make you very happy."
3.0,"This vest is 2XX men's size.  As you see it the photos it is six inches from closeing.  I don't know what Amazon uses for sizes but it isn't American sizes.  My son had a similar situation with an item from Amazon,. 3X.  I don't think I will order any clothes from Amazon again!"
3.0,"I live in Phoenix where the nighttime temps are often in the 90's and like my Jammie's loose and cool. I purchased these because I thought, per the discription they would fit loose."
3.0,Really cute glasses but the screws that hold them together are too small and had to be replaced within a couple weeks. They fell apart!
3.0,"Ears are on bobby-pins, snap-pins would have been better as they do not pull hair and a ribbon is used to tie the tail on. Other then that The tail and ears themselves are top quality!!!"
3.0,"Came fitting like a bag. I’m 5’0” and 105lbs. I took in every seam in order to make it fit. If you aren’t a clever seamstress, don’t expect this to fit outvofvthe package. But it’s perfect as a project starter."
3.0,"Liked the colors, but fabric is itchy"
3.0,this is a nice enough dress but i personally did not fall in love with it. its made from a nice medium weight stretch jersey material and it looks exactly as its pictured. its nice for a day at the mall or work or church.
3.0,They are really cool but run small
3.0,"Again, I got duped by the off-size description of Asian-made clothing. Cute, but I can’t wear it unless I lose about 50 pounds."
3.0,Hoodie was much thinner than I thought also size was slightly smaller than I expected.
3.0,"The construction could be improved.  I just had to reattach the straps, which made me late for my water exercise class!  Perhaps this isn't the best type of suit for this activity."
3.0,"These glasses are really dark, other then that they are nice!"
3.0,"I purchased these gloves specifically for the touch screen feature, and am quite disappointed. The feature was so inconsistent (and non-existent on one pair) that I still end up removing the gloves to use my phone. I'm keeping them because they are very comfortable and are nice looking when I need something a cut above my ski gloves."
3.0,"the teeth look great and the instructions are very clear. the problem i have with these teeth are the molding plastic and veneer are an actual nightmare to get to stick together.<br />the back of the veneers are way too smooth and need something for the plastic to grip onto, more than just the two holes in the veneers on the side. i’ve been working with them for days and i keep getting frustrated because i’ll have a perfect fit, but i go to remove the teeth again and the plastic pops right off of the veneer.<br /><br />pros: the teeth look perfect for a blood fiend cosplay, they’re comfortable, and pretty easy to speak with.<br /><br />cons: the molding plastic doesn’t like to adhere to the veneer easily, no matter how carefully you follow the instructions."
3.0,"Hem on this dress is awkward, very asymmetrical, if that's what you like, go for it."
3.0,Not completely waterproof
3.0,This body suit had a cute shape to it but it was a little see through.
3.0,Jacket perfect except zippers get stuck and jacket material thin so ripped seam near zipper when try to get unstuck.
3.0,A small is a medium. but the colors are nice and vibrant but too bad about the sizing issue. My son still enjoyed it when I used it to dress up as Spider-Man for his Bday.
3.0,"Description was misleading. It said it lights up but it doesn’t, they enclosed a mini flashlight that you shine on the face of the watch."
3.0,It runs a bit too snug.  I ended up returning it.  I would probably buy it again at a later time in a bigger size though.  The quality wasn't bad and the material was nice! :)
3.0,"I'm 5'3 and 152lbs. After reading through all the reviews and the size chart, I went with a large. The fit was meh. It wasn't actually too tight anywhere but it definitely isn't as flowy and forgiving as I wanted.<br /><br />The material is thicker than most tank dresses in this price range, so it looks nicer but it's also a little stiff (even after washing). I think that's what makes it cling instead of flow like others I've bought. This one seems to show every lump and bump. I could size up but I think that would make the chest and arms holes far too big.<br /><br />I ended up wearing it for the event I bought it for, so obviously it wasn't HORRIBLE, but I doubt I'll wear it again. From now on, I'll stick with the thinner t-shirt material dresses in this style."
3.0,Not roomy.
3.0,"This strap had only about 1/4 of the material that I was expecting. So if you are looking for a heavy, thick cut leather strap you will be disappointed. The vendor provided me a full refund which is why I adjusted the rating to 3 stars from initially 1 star."
3.0,"Ordered a 42FF. Seems true-to-size. Looks smooth under t-shirts. The underwires are wide on me, but are, I suspect, for average root width (I'm narrow). In front, the straps are anchored as far apart as I could possibly wear (yeah, I know, it's a balconette, so they will be far apart, but they're REALLY far apart.) The lace is soft enough, but I find that with the straps extended all the way (which is usual for me) the adjustment clips are scratchy on my back.  I would also comment that the photo is showing a model who either has implants that don't need support, or the model is wearing another bra under this one and they photoshopped it out--this bra is just not that supportive."
3.0,Bust was not the size reported.  Dress was too long in the front and too short in the back.  The colors did not match up at the seems.
3.0,These boots are pretty hard to get on my son.  They are too flimsy and won't hold shape when we are trying to put them on him.
3.0,"It is very cheap slinky material should have sentcit back , haven’t worn it much"
3.0,Bigger then I thought. And made my ears itch!!
3.0,"The product itself is adorable and fit as expected. However, one of the boots arrived with a zipper that we werenot able to open and the seams appeared to be already breaking. I did return the product and bought the same boots directly from Stride Rite instead."
3.0,IT LOOKS NICE BUT TANGLES UP
3.0,Beautiful earrings but one broke after only one week.
3.0,"Sizing is WAY off for this. I’m a 16W, and tried 1X-5X sizes. The 5X was the closest fit, but was still snug through the hips and didn’t give the loose casual fit that you’d expect."
3.0,Decent fit. Sleeves slightly shorter than expected but otherwise fits as expected.  Beware of your seat belt rubbing on this material.  This picture is the result of wear after only 3 hours.
3.0,it runs a lil small.
3.0,"I wear an XL, i ordered a 2xl and it fits a little snug"
3.0,Ordered these because my old pair of Knockarounds were great. These are not. Very cheaply made and they are uncomfortable. The arms have loosened to the point of flopping around while wearing them. Only reason for not giving them one star is the style is still nice looking.
3.0,nice watch it's not blue it more purplish
3.0,"I'm 5'5"" 120 pounds, 34A. I purchased a mesium. I don't like thongs. I thought this was going to be a full coverage bottom (maybe I made a mistake as I was looking at a lot of body suits). I like the flat cotton. It's a good price. As do ALL body suits, it feels a bit short in the torso.  Glad I went with a medium. Small would certainly not fit. I'm normally a small in tops.<br /><br />Again, I find the bottom too aggravating. The material around the snaps is a bit more rough and it runs against my skin on my inner thigh...disappointed. I'm not sure I'll be able to wear this (perhaps with boyshorts underneath to protect me a bit more. I just felt like I had a constant wedgie."
3.0,All the buttons came off the first time he tried it on and the zipper was already broken. I sewed the buttons back on and got the zipper to work for the most part.
3.0,I like the style it's just a little too snug.
3.0,The pockets are placed on the seam that runs down the underarm making them hard to use.
3.0,"I had ordered another one of these previously, and the two are both a bit large. Larger then expected.<br />But I can't complain, I still adore them. It must be the size of my face I suppose."
3.0,"This would be a GREAT watchband if it were a little bit smaller--small enough for a 6 inch wrist.  If they ever make one like that, I'll buy a bunch of them.  Right now, however, it slides all over my wrist, which is very distracting and makes the watch face impossible to read without slowing down.<br /><br />To the manufacturer: is there any chance you produce a smaller version? I'd pay extra for it."
3.0,Beetle juice wedding scene. My daughter was supposed to be the little alien officiant. I ordered a 12-18 months for my 11 month old and the legs length were a little short but we made it work. Plus the seam broke on the bottom and we had to change her into another costume. She was a dinosaur.
3.0,Very cute but not for me...it itches. I'm prone to allergies so perhaps the problem is my own but the fabric feels scratchy - not soft. The color is fantastic - bright and fun. The style and cut look good. May work well for those who are not prone to skin irritation or who plan to wear a full body liner underneath.
3.0,I have been wearing this beautiful necklace non stop for the last 3days. It’s So pretty. But now the color has changed completely and it looks just cheap.<br />Don’t shower with it. Don’t sweat wearing it. That’s disappointing
3.0,"This was a cute bracelet however, it was a bit small for an adult wrist. I think it would be best for a child."
3.0,Cute but the pants fit weird. Fits like a low rider pants.  Not comfortable for a toddler
3.0,"Nice shape- The color isn't as bright as I wanted,these are more of a navy blue."
3.0,"it’ a pretty normal bracelet, well advised but for that price you can find something better. I didn’t return it only because it was a gift and I was running out of time."
3.0,Probably a nice product if you can squeeze into it.
3.0,"i love the print on these, but as a surgical tech i am on my feet 12 hours a day and they are not tight enough.  there are higher quality compression socks that fit as they should. I have small feet and think calves.  I have to buy from pro-compression to get the proper fit."
3.0,"These lanyards are attractive and they will work fine if the ends of the earpieces on your glasses are larger than the rest.  If they're the same diameter, though, then the lanyard loops will slip off occasionally (true even if you've snugged up the loops tightly)."
3.0,Not like what I thought. the dress is a little bit short from the front and the back.The quality is ok.
3.0,It didn't fit right the color was what lighter then the picture
3.0,It a little small and the top needed a liner to keep my head from burning
3.0,"I thought it would be a cute, casual dress.  I’m using it as a nightshirt instead."
3.0,"The six shirts I orders are not all cut the same and made of the same material. which is disappointing. The black shirts are thicker and cut wider to the shoulders to give you more support, the blue and grey shirts are thinner and are not cut as wide. In addition, they do not offer much in the compression area as well. I will give the compression area a 3 star as well but it is a t-shirt so what the h***. The black shirts are the best ones to get."
3.0,I put on the band to the watch with no problems but didn't like the side to push the button to release the band so I pushed on the stick lever to remove but broke now it's stuck and only way is to force it out and break it. I would ask for a refund but don't want to deal with all that returning it plus looks good on for now
3.0,"It looked very nice on the model, but it was very wrinkled, had to iron it, and the top was not well fitted, but it's a nice dress. It is always hit and miss..when you buy clothes online."
3.0,"Neckline of shirt received was different, kinda better looking in the picture."
3.0,I haven't worn this product as yet but the ear rings seems a bit too large.
3.0,"Shirt was very pretty and looked as was shown on the website. However I wear a large and bought a large, but shirt was way too small. Should have order a size bigger."
3.0,Super cheap shiny synthetic fabric.  Fits well but better suited to wear as a bathing suit cover up.
3.0,The edges are very poorly cut.
3.0,Would like product delivered to apt
3.0,"I require a custom orthotic. Drew sandals are usually double deep when the foot bed is removed. These were not. My orthotic partially stuck out, especially in the heel area, making it unsightly.  I found them to be narrow for a man's regular shoe size and slightly short. The same holds true with women's Drew shoes I have tried.  I am a woman with a medium width foot and I tried the men's size hoping for a bit wider fit than the women's Drew sandals especially in the ball of the foot. Only slightly wider in that area. I did not find them to be that heavy as stated in other reviews. They are not light-weight, but not abnormally heavy either.  The straps adjusted well and the Velcro was a decent length. They seemed sturdy, comfortable and  supportive. If my orthotic would have dropped down a bit more and there was a bit more width in the ball of the foot area, they would have been keepers."
3.0,"For the price, the quality of the product itself is decent. It was exactly what I needed from a costume perspective.<br /><br />That said, if you are a petite person, don't get this. I'm not even that small. I'm a 5 ft tall, 115ish lb, woman who is a 32 DD. I am also a competitive weightlifter, which means that my back and lats (sides) are very broad and muscular. I actually usually have to size up in dresses, but opted with a small after reading reviews. Even with boobs that are large for my frame, and extra back, shoulder and lat muscle; the top half of this was all around HUGE. The waist was also a bit big. I had to do some pretty creative safety pinning to wear it for my costume party. Fortunately for me, I was using it as the base dress to be the crazy cat lady from the Simpsons, so it was okay that it looked a bit disheveled/ ill fitting. Unless you are a proficient seamstress, or are willing to pay someone to alter a $20 dress, I would really recommend staying away from this if you are under 5 ft 3, American size 6-8."
3.0,Pretty neat watch. Bummer that it only has one light source. Cant really tell the time in the dark.
3.0,Nose clips are little silicone pieces that just are supposed to magically float in the holder. No adhesive or anything. They fall out and inevitably your nose is holding up the entire weight of the glasses with pointy nose metal.
3.0,"Design what nice. I figured the dress would run a little small so I ordered a size up which worked out...however I did have to return the dress due to the color not actually being navy blue. It's more of a dark mauve blue. If you are looking for navy, this isn't the dress for your."
3.0,Wasn't as comfortable as I had been told from others.  I returned them.
3.0,It was small for the size and also quality was not worth the price
3.0,"Disappointed in that I thought thy would be a bit more textured in the middle part that twists. Lightweight and slim, not too long of a dangle. S&h fine."
3.0,Super cute shoes but he arch made the shoe so painful to wear. It felt like a hard metal bar was going across my foot so bad that I could not wear them and I have very high arches. I have other Vionic heels and they do not feel like that so not sure why these do. Very cute shoe though.
3.0,Great for waist. Absolutely no lower abdomen support
3.0,"Had to send it back 3X, too large."
3.0,"Nice top, but I ordered beige and got lavender?"
3.0,Not as big as it looks.
3.0,Love the style and price. The clasp broke within days. I was able to fix it but it its cheaply made. I guess I shouldn't have expected much from something at such low cost!
3.0,Very lightweight. Cute but not what I expected
3.0,I have new gray suede J&M shoes and was hoping for belt to match; photo appears dark shade like my shoes. Actually it is very light and did not match at all.  Should have read return policy better...had to pay to return it when the color didn't match photo. I wish returning to local J&M store was shown as an option...maybe it was.
3.0,"It really does look cheap, but it's fine for the few times I'll be wearing it."
3.0,love the look of this top. I got a lot of compliments on it but...it needs work on the flowers. I had to re-knot all of the single flowers because there was nothing to keep it from unraveling.
3.0,Pads are great but flap with Velcro doesn't hold up well at all
3.0,They were of very good quality just a little to tight for me below the knee area.
3.0,"Dress (or top) was way too short and tight. I wore it as a top with leggings. It worked ok that way, but I was disappointed because I was hoping for a dress."
3.0,This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my adult daughter who is very petite.  The bracelet fell right off her wrist.  Disappointing.
3.0,Very thin. Decided to send it back because it also fit larger than I was hoping. Would make a better bathing suit cover up than dress.
3.0,Probably fine if it fits
3.0,It’s very dark but looks good
3.0,The inside white stitching was too noticable and the fabric is kinda thin. A couple buttons we're sewn backwards.
3.0,"I received five headbands, but they only had one flower on each of them. I obviously thought they would have two flowers, each, but they don't. With that said, these are adorable anyway, and I plan on keeping them."
3.0,The fabric is smoother than I expected and slips from my face. It is very breathable though.
3.0,"The case looked very nice, however I didn’t like how it wouldn’t sit flat on its back because of the round area with the ring.  Could be 5 star for some, just not my type of case."
3.0,It broke shortly after receiving it.
3.0,"Logo does not last, rubs off. Very cheap and has a funky smell out of the packaging."
3.0,Not very comfortable. Would never buy MK shoes or sneakers again
3.0,A bit akward
3.0,A bit smaller than the picture and very fine.  The picture overstates the size.
3.0,I had to return it because it didnt match my outfit like I had thought. It was a beautiful piece but was not right for me.
3.0,I ordered red.  It did not have a slit in the front but was a beautiful dress.  Giving it 3 stars due to a low cut neckline.  If the dress would have covered more cleavage I would have kept it.
3.0,The straps broke and this back pack didn't last the first month of school before breaking. Only good thing is the wolf design which is now just a wall decoration.
3.0,What I want
3.0,"This is really only good for people with small, small cell phones. I have an S3 and there is no way it would fit in the pocket--actually it would be a tight squeeze even to zip it into the main compartment. Also wish there was a change purse--I'd actually rather have that than the cell phone pocket. I still have the tags on since I'm not sure whether to return it or not."
3.0,"I got the ring and I got really excited about it; but when I put it on, it felt like it was very plastic-y and it was irritating me. The shine was good, overall, but the feel of the ring was not; I couldn't have worn it every day - that's for sure."
3.0,"These gloves are soft, comfortable and thin enough to give your hands decent range of motion for general activities. They do run very small, though, so be aware. I have small hands, but thee small pair I ordered were more like a child's size, so when I ordered another pair, I went with medium and after just washing them, leaving them to drip dry, they were still pretty small, but perfect for my needs none the less."
3.0,"They were good quality,but just too small"
3.0,The keychain looks pretty and will be a good gift to a new owner of a F250.  The mechanism works but is very stiff. It may loosen as used. Price-wise I am satisfied.
3.0,The material is very similar to CK but the sizing appears to be.a little off.  The pouch is small and I do not live the white sheath on the inside.  I love the material on the outside but the sizing running small and the off colored extra layer isn’t ideal.
3.0,"Good metal, but the stones fell out the first day"
3.0,cat mask is a bit on the larger side and requires double sided tape to hold flush to face and cheeks/
3.0,"One came dead, but the other two work perfect for my readers who are logging hours for summer reading. Easy for them to figure out and use. With six kids 8 and under, it's hard to log it all myself so this helps. Just wish all 3 worked -_-"
3.0,I bought XL and they were still too tight. I don't have unusually large fingers
3.0,"Great quality and very well made, just wish I could fit it. It was super snug, I should’ve gotten a bigger size."
3.0,Cute but the lace is coming apart and it is very short. I am 5’4 and it is way to short for me.
3.0,"While the colors were vibrant, the fabric was thinner that I expected. True to size ."
3.0,More like velour tights. Wear another pair of leggings under
3.0,"i read the reviews, i shouldn't have ordered them: M/L will NOT fit a 38&#34; band sized woman.  ahh well, my bad.  in my excitement this last xmas i removed the tags and washed/dried (on LOW DELICATE there was NO shrinkage due to my laundering!) them--not even a bra extender will take care of too-small issue :(  can't return them--maybe some day i will attempt to alter them, idk.  i WISH THEY'D MAKE A REAL LARGE!!!!!  it's a cryin shame too b/cos it's HARD to find a soft cup bra in the same style--essentially a piece of material to tell yourself you're wearing a bra, but it's decoration.  they are lovely, but there's NO way i could wear them---the wear lines afterward would be KILLER."
3.0,Feel of fabric is great but runs small
3.0,I thought it was a multi size set. Not a bad product just not what I expected. No complaints on seller.
3.0,a little over sized for my 6yo's mouth.  But nice that so many come in the pack...we just tossed them after one use.
3.0,I have a tall slender frame and found this shirt to be rather unflattering on me and cheap looking. I thought it was exceptionally boxy. I ordered a small which is what I would normally order. I would send it back if the cost to re ship wasn't half the price of the item. I think there are other better items on amazon in this cut
3.0,"These earrings are very pretty but do not accept the larger snap inserts.  The description says they accept 18-20mm snaps, but they only fit the smaller snap inserts."
3.0,2 wks late and delivery was at wrong location but they are comfy and warm now that I have them will order more
3.0,Decent quality and fits just right but the black leather stains the white. Always keep it hung up.
3.0,One of the 3 had a small hole in it upon receipt.  All are very long and lace is extremely loose in the armpits.
3.0,Very cute dress but too small. Extremely snug fitting. I recommend ordering 1-2 sizes up and if you have lots of curves don't order this at all.
3.0,Well made socks and nice color combo but my husband said they were too tight for him even though they are a size XL.
3.0,Great dress but I would recommend sizing up if you don't want it snug.  I'm 5'10 and wear a size 10/12 normally. I purchased a large but could have easily gone up a size because I have a larger chest.
3.0,Has the space it say but the threading comes apart easily
3.0,I bought this because I loved the color and how it looked. Plus I was ready to change out my starter piecing and replace something that looked pretty cool. This is a little big for a tragus piercing but it does work. The only thing I didn't like was the backing was too small and I had to rush to the piercing place for them to help out.
3.0,The shirt is great and my daughter loves it. The only thing wrong was that it was late. The last date I got for delivery was the 20th of Dec. it came the 24th.
3.0,Seemed like a nice quality but ruins very small
3.0,These were a little disappointing because the rings were either too small or too big to wear as midi.
3.0,"This earrings are nice,  but they're tiny.  As a reference, I added a lemon seed to the pictures to show just how small they are.  I think they would look precious in a baby. Yes, they're that tiny.  Nonetheless,  if small earrings are your thing then they're great."
3.0,"The fit is just right. The design is a bit irregular. If you wear an so or larger, I doubt if your arms fit comfortably. Nice good color though."
3.0,"Its a nice belt ,but not big enough for me. Disappointed"
3.0,"Way too long, I'm 5'10&#34; and they had to be hemmed to fit a person much taller than I."
3.0,Legs are too long arms are definitely too short and I am a normal size guy
3.0,great product for wanting to wear your comfy bra and have a low back dress or blouse on.
3.0,I do like the color but the face of the watch is way too big for my liking. I am returning it for this reason
3.0,I bought this to wear with my dressy cloths!<br />  It’s not as Dressy as I thought... looks a little cheep. Was Not Impressed!!!
3.0,The necklace is much shorter and smaller than expected. I had to order silver necklace extenders in order to wear it like a necklace and not like a choker.
3.0,Initially I was very happy with this purchase but only 10mo later the lenses started to bubble.
3.0,"The watch itself is nice, the only problem I have with the watch is the band. It seems like the watch is uneven and I have to push the watch a certain way in order for the watch to connect to each other."
3.0,"I ordered the xl plus. I'm 5'7, 235lbs, wear a 16/18 in jeans and an xl/2x in tops. This was extremely skin tight. I could get it on but it was hard to move my arms and I was afraid the stitching in the armpits would rip. The mesh on the arms is slightly itchy but the bodysuit part was soft. The snaps held together well. If I'd ordered 1 size bigger I think I would have kept it."
3.0,"Bought this for my fiancé and this shirt feels like a pair of leggings. It's a little cheap looking when you look close at the neck line.  For being a slim fit, the arms and shirt are still pretty wide."
3.0,"I loved this band for the first week, and then the watchband pin popped out!  I was reading a book and when I got up, I didn’t realize my watch had slipped off.  My son almost stepped on it!  I shutter to think I almost lost my watch.  Will try to find a replacement part."
3.0,The picture shows/description says grey skirt with yellow.  It is actually much darker grey with mustard.  It is quite warm and comfortable but need to size up 2 sizes.
3.0,"I found it a bit hard to stay positioned. Otherwise, you'd get a lot of compliments."
3.0,"Light, and handsome. Great watch at a great price. Not as thin as shown or described"
3.0,Bit expense be for not being made in USA.
3.0,This fits and the fabric and sticking are fine but it is not flattering at all. It makes me look like a block of cheese.
3.0,"When I first got this bag I absolutely loved it! The style is beautiful and perfect for what I was looking for. I only wish that the fabric wasn't so stiff, anything that I put in the bag rattled around and it always made a weird noise as I walked around the office; it was like all of the attorneys knew when I got to work once their heard my bag, which was irritating and kind of embarrassing.<br /><br />On top of that, because of the rigidness, it was hard for the magnetic clips to clip together and close. It was frustrating because I would have to pull the top piece down to make sure it aligned with the magnetic clip and it was a really big struggle at times, and eventually the attachable strap broke off (the sewing fell loose) and I wasn't able to use it as a cross-body anymore. So I carried it as a briefcase for some time until I purchased a new bag. It was noisy, but I really did like the style. Overall, I'm not sure I would recommend it for an everyday bag, but it is a nice bag with great style."
3.0,Loved these but mine ripped at the waistband and im so sad. It did work for about 10months before ripping tho.
3.0,Super soft but not absorbang and a bit on the small side.
3.0,I love Notify jeans and was excited to receive this pair.  Unfortunately the pants were more like bell bottoms than flare.  Had to return them.
3.0,Nice and thick but folds up from the top and bottom.  The kids stopped wearing after the 1st wear because they fold up and is annoying.
3.0,I really liked this bag but....2 days past the return date the zipper came apart and is not fixable.
3.0,Looks more flashy than the picture.
3.0,I love everything about these (give off SIGMA male vibes fo sho) other than they don't hug my head when I put them on top of my hat and fall off easily from being so loose  they also scratch if you look at them wrong  for the price they should be at least a little more durable  they aren't women's sunglasses for God sake
3.0,"My daughter and I both tried it on and it looks more like a maternity type dress. Neither of us are pregnant and we’re both physically fit, it’s not a flattering cut. It’s unfortunate and I am returning it and I’m being charged $3.66 to return it which is something I never have to do as a prime member. That’s disappointing as well."
3.0,Nice but super thin! I suggest wearing two at a time!
3.0,"Works as expected but is very itchy/semi pointy on the corner and edges, and doesn't quite match up in width."
3.0,"The fit is great and the slippers are comfortable don’t get me wrong. But they fall off to easy because of the texture of the fur which causes them to be very slippery. I’ve tripped over them a few times because they fall off so easy. They’re very cute and soft, but too bad they don’t stay on very well..."
3.0,"I am a &#34;big and tall&#34; man and I perpetually looked sloppy because my shirt would be billowing out of -- and eventually escaping -- my pants.  Frustrated, I finally tried out these shirt garters/shirt stays.  And it is one of the best purchases I have ever made.<br /><br />These shirt stays work well for men of all sizes. I'm built like Jackie Gleason and had no problem using them.  They are unobstrusive and if you put them on correctly, you barely notice them.  Simply loop the bottom around your foot and then attach the clamps to the shirt tail.  It makes putting your pants on a breeze.  There's no more stuffing your hands down your pants to get the shirt tucked in; the shirt is already snug -- but not tight -- against your body.  And these work all day long.  I have an office job that requires a lot of sitting/standing, so before I bought these, my shirt would become a little bit untucked when I went from sitting to standing and eventually be entirely untucked at the end of the day.  I don't have that problem anymore.<br /><br />These shirt stays are worth the money and it's amazing how much better you look when you shirt stays neatly tucked into your pants for the entire day.  If you are at your wits end, then buy these today.<br /><br />Edit: I still liked the shirt stays, but I had to knock it down two stars because after two weeks of use, one of the clasps completely broke off."
3.0,"The delivery took forever.  I tried to cancel but it was not allowed.  Not a sweatshirt thickness, if that’s what you want.  It’s more like a thick long sleeve tshirt.  So would be fine for that.  Quality seems fine."
3.0,It was just okay... The straps were placed awkwardly so that it didn't flatter me at all.
3.0,"I used to LOVE viv collection.<br />The last few orders I have been let down.  It just doesn't seem like the same quality.  When you stretch it, it isn't solid (see thru).  I used to only wear this brand because it was top-notch.  I have noticed a decrease in overall quality.  These pants are fine.  I have worn once, I did wash and they did wash fine.  But they are not going to hold up like my old Viv collection pants.  Also - it just doesn't have that same velvety feel as my old pants/leggings (like a year ago).  Will buy again, but will also look at other vendors too now."
3.0,Way bigger than the size chart. I even took my measurements!
3.0,"This organizer work okay but it cannot be used for too many items, plus it is heavy enough to defeat the purpose of using it. I tried it in my laptop case but because it is so balky, I had to stop using it after a while because the benefit of organizing a few items was not worth the bulk and extra weight."
3.0,the overall glasses are just OK smaller than what you would think tight on the sides my face.  I received the glasses and they were already broken.........the tiny screw that was to hold the piece of plastic that grips to your nose was already busted.  Had to go to my optometrist to repair them.  Be advised they come in a small box with 7 pieces of Styrofoam.
3.0,"Cute, but ended up too small for me."
3.0,"I got this because I loved the design of it! I went by the size chart and got the XL and it was way too small. It's really cute and made very well, but you need to order a size or two up from what your normal size is."
3.0,"Decent quality for the price, but definitely size up. I bought this for my partner and it BARELY fit. I ordered a 33, and he's regularly a 31. Because of this, I would recommend at least adding three inches to any typical belt measurement- if only for the comfort.<br /><br />The belt itself is very nice, and the silver paint is very classy. I do worry that it will wear off soon as it appears it is silver paint rather than a silver colored metal, BUT so far so good. He has only worn it once or twice, and I suspect it will stretch with time, but it's much better than his old belt, which was APPALLING!"
3.0,"feels and looks kinda cheap in real life. I know you get what you pay for, but still. I've had better luck with other brands. Overall it's just OK."
3.0,Its super cut but it's a little small for 6-9 months. Stitching coming out where the paw prints are & literally just opened it didn't even wash it or anything.
3.0,"Honestly disappointed in this purchase. The jacket looks very sleek and fitted in the listing, but is puffy and big in person. The chest measured within 1” of the posted bust measurement (measured 48” for size L). But if I ordered the next size down for a more fitted appearance, the sleeves would be too short. I was looking for a jacket that would look nice with a shirt and tie for slightly cool or rainy weather, and this looks more like a frumpy windbreaker. Also posted picture of gaps at the top and bottom of zipper."
3.0,Absolutely perfect for the holidays
3.0,"The sandals are really cute but they keep distach from the velcro, that's really annoying that my little boy has to stop every now and then to adjust his sandals."
3.0,I bought a size small (5’6 120lbs) but it fit a little<br />big so I gave it to my sister.
3.0,Lindo vestido pero demasiado pequeño. Corresponde a un talle 4/5 años. Y no tiene forro
3.0,color was lighter than expected
3.0,Kind of on the cheap feeling side but I do love them and I wear them all the time.
3.0,Looks more like a negligee than a bathing suit cover.  I will be returning it as it did not suit my needs as a bathing suit cover up.
3.0,"This is a cute skirt with a nice amount of flare.  I'm 5'6"", 129 pounds and the medium fits good.  I did not notice when I ordered it that one of the pockets is upside down.  I guess that is handy for tennis but not for running as I like to keep my phone in one pocket and chapstick in the other.  Unfortunately I would not order another one of these as I need two right side up pockets."
3.0,"I like this skirt especially for the length. It's just above my knee so it's work appropriate. However, I shouldn't have followed the reviews. I got a medium when I should've gotten a small. So now I have to alter this skirt. I'm disappointed."
3.0,The lines quickly came apart and I had to start makeshifting ties that end up looking like tv wires sticking out. The stones themselves are very nice but shame the tie isn’t so good
3.0,These are beautiful but are very heavy and the rhinestones are only on half of the earring so when you move your head you can see the not so pretty part.
3.0,"Had this toy when they were sold plentiful at Toys R Us. It's pretty durable, considering how hard/thick the plastic is. Press the symbol in the middle and the wand's ring lights up while playing a tune. Remove the crystal ring by sliding the button on the back and it plays the sound of dying batteries. Not as nice to the ears as the first one.<br /><br />Other than pretending to be Sailor Moon there's not much else to this toy. Otherwise than launching/popping the ring out of boredom."
3.0,This sweatshirt looks like somebody made it at home. The collar and cuff areas are very poor quality.  I will keep it and wear it around the house but certainly won’t get another one. The material is very thin too. I don’t recommend it
3.0,Really tight fit bought an xl and it felt like I was trying to squeeze into a med.
3.0,"Great hat. Ripped at the front seams in 2 days of wear though. :(<br />I'll probably just sew it since my son loves it so much, I don't want to have to make him wait for a replacement."
3.0,SOCKS ARE NOT EASY ON/ EASY OFF‼️
3.0,"While it looks like a shirt in the picture, It's a dress on me, and it's huge, so now I have a hang around the house/pajama dress."
3.0,For children they are okay.
3.0,I've changed my review.  The stone fell out within 3 weeks.  It's very pretty has the antique look but you need to make sure the prongs are long enough for the stone
3.0,I feel like the picture made this set look a lot bigger than it actually is. The quality isn’t fantastic but still very cute. Probably best for children.
3.0,"It fits more like a child size large, definitely not an adult. I have to literally squeeze my head into the opening, and the clasps at the bottom are difficult to snap. Once I finally get it on, it wears okay. The getting off is another dilemma."
3.0,"Decent, smells metallic, but at least my fingers didn't turn green like with the gold-plated ones"
3.0,"This apron is not apron material, it felt like plastic and was creased very badly. Couldn’t dry it or iron it because it seemed like it would melt from heat. It’s an okay gift to just be funny."
3.0,"No complaints  on the quality of these earrings, it could be just a fit issue for me, but the leverbacks are too short for my ear lobes and they pinch."
3.0,I loved the suit but runs very small
3.0,"Good quality, but I expected it to be more of an oversized fit. Normally wear a med/large and I ordered an xl, fits small more like a medium. The material feels good not cheap, just wish it was more oversized and not fitted.  But great shirt for the price."
3.0,"Big fail on my part ordering this for my wife. First, the skull motif did not go over well. From a distance, you don't see the skulls and the design is deceivingly pleasing, at least it is to me. But up close is another story. I should have chosen the pink one with the water motif. Second, the fit was completely off. She's a 12 that can swing--depending on manufacture--10-12 or 12-14. She's 5'4&#34; tall and 115 to 120 pounds. I ordered the 12 - 14 and it was OK around the middle but way to big in the bust and bottom.<br /><br />The material is very nice (hence the 3-stars) and I just might order the one in pink.<br /><br />Note: Sample provided for review."
3.0,Show was a good fit my son kept saying his feet hurt also the battery on the shoes don’t last long
3.0,"Very lightweight and comfortable to wear, but no wire for nose. I wear glasses, so I found my glasses fogging up, which was very annoying. I had to keep repositioning my glasses over the top of the mask, but that made it difficult to see properly."
3.0,"The material is very clingy, everything clings on to them. You have to pick everything off it doesn't wash off in the washer. I like to wear my slippers everywhere & anywhere & these are not good for that.<br />However they are warm & comfy for just around the house, unless you have pets, the material just didn't work for me."
3.0,"Looked cute on, but wouldn't stay locked. After two weeks of wearing it it fell out and I lost it somewhere. Won't buy again."
3.0,Colors and tones matched.  Plastic &#34;stones&#34; glued on crooked.  Feels fake but I have received several compliments while wearing.  Not quite as good looking in person.
3.0,Hat came folded and we didn’t even use it. It was so thin and almost a rag. Everything else in the bundle was really cute though.
3.0,I really liked everything on the dress until I washed it on delicate and the stiching came undone.  I was very disappointed!
3.0,"They are very pretty and i love the colors,<br />not too sure if they are real because they are painted,<br />with some of the paint flecking off.<br />They are actually too big to fit any kind of necklace or locket,<br />so not sure what i will do with them?<br />I loved the fast shipping, but not convinced they are worth the price."
3.0,very cute but was not the right fit for me
3.0,The picture shows the length to come slightly below the wasiteline but it is much longer. Too long. I'll cut it off and use it for a work around the house shirt.
3.0,Runs very small. The shorts are way too short. Cute t-shirt
3.0,Lovely twisted metal work.  Piece can be improved by end crowns to cap the end so ends look smoter rather than unrefined.
3.0,The fabric is a bit too thin. You can see through against the light.
3.0,They are OK- Good.basic. Nothing special.
3.0,"These feel super cheap, you get what you pay for I guess :)<br />They are totally water resistant, durable and easy to clean because they are basically plastic. There is no linen or cotton feel to them. It makes me laugh because it feels like I’m wearing a plastic sheet protector. Haha<br />Cute style but terrible fabric"
3.0,The material is clingy and not very breathable. It fits a little awkward on my body and isn't form fitting. It also bounces up and down heavily when doing exercises such as jumping jacks or running. Decent for the price but I would probably buy something more athletic oriented.
3.0,Nice quality and lovely style but runs a size large.  I wear a 4 and ordered the small which fits like a 6/8.  It is not a true small so beware when you order.  Nice skort though.
3.0,"Its pretty, but the quality isn't good. The handle kept breaking off."
3.0,"The sweatshirt is nice, but the tee shirt has a peeling design and the cape had a hole in it.  It wasn't the quality I expect."
3.0,"This necklace is ok, but before I could wear it, I had to remove the tarnish off of it. It is sterling silver, so no surprise there."
3.0,"This is beautiful Dress, might be a little small or my boobs might be too big but I don’t feel comfortable."
3.0,"The buckle is sturdy and fairly large.  The hefty belt appears to be strong but very stiff.  The stiffness, hopefully, will disappear with use.  The buckle requires a good effort to lock but I believe that is due again to the stiffness of the belt.  I would have preferred a metal end to the belt rather than the leather end provided.  I'm not sure that the leather will wear well passing through the metal buckle with each use.  The belt and buckle should be fine on work clothes or outdoor clothes, probably not on light weight casual clothes."
3.0,material is so so
3.0,I had to cut the feet open and wear them with thigh high heels because they didn’t come pass my ass.
3.0,"The shirt runs small as mentioned - definitely size up.  I did and it fits okay.  I am so disappointed in the color!  I should have gotten gray, but I decided to go for the ultraviolet that looked more of a bright blue.  It is purple. Not the same shade or even hue. I honestly don’t have any purple clothes. When I opened it I immediately knew it was wrong because it’s just not a color I wear.  Attached an image for comparison of what I ordered vs what I received."
3.0,"I like this sweater, it's very soft and I think it'll be comfortable in the coming months. However, it's not as big as I thought or hoped it would be. I ordered an XL knowing that it SHOULD be too large for me (therefore very comfortable), but the sleeves were just too short. It's sized more like a L, which is disappointing. Otherwise it is a nice sweater made of a soft and cozy material."
3.0,Only giving it 3 stars because it was cheap. You definitely get what you pay for with this. But can 100% find a much better quality bag on amazon for same price. The material is just way to cheap looking.
3.0,Very slllllloooooowwww shipping.  I didnt realize it was just one I was getting rather than the whole set.. But thats it was my mistake for not reading the description thoroughly. Its a little small for my wrist so I wouldnt recommend for an adult woman over 120 lbs.  The metal is very sturdy and not soft at all so it would day hold up to wear and tear quite well. If youre very strong you could probably open the opening a little more but I was unable to do so myself. It will be a great gift for my skinny mini bff!
3.0,"I love the color, and at first they work great. The problem lies in that over time they stretch and no longer hold pants up."
3.0,i didn't notice prior to ordering there were a couple cheap plastic diamonds o the side. They look childish. I took some nail polish and cover it up with gold.....looks much better. Would have been a 5 but knocking 2 stars off for the diamond design.
3.0,"Not bad at all.  Very lightweight.  Really wish they offered a plain watch face instead of the Skull/Antlers/Infinity symbols. Still keeping time after 1 week (for what it's worth).<br /><br />The strap on this watch is a bit small and not the best quality.  The strap is a bit more rugged than the one pictured, with harsher edges and not as good leather quality.  It is very soft and comfortable though. I have larger wrists and wear a fitbit/nike wrist trainer sized large, however I must wear this watch on the next to last notch on the band (fyi for extra larger wristed folks).<br /><br />The bracelets however are terrific."
3.0,"ordered Safety pink and it is not what was pictured...closer to the neon pink(side to side with a pink safety vest in photo...a huge difference). tight around the neck, but I am adding a full zipper so its irrelevant. not as bright as I wanted for riding motorcycle and the visual aesthetic, but it's bright enough to do the job."
3.0,"This is my 3rd purchase of this skirt. The first one had a perfect hem. The second a slightly uneven one. This one is completely out of wack. I didn't lo carefully or wear it right away as I assumed it was pretty much fine. By the time I noticed the problem, it was too late to return or exchange it. I'll have to re-hem it myself (bummer!) I do love the fabric, the cut and the drape though. Just check when you get it if the hem is done correctly!"
3.0,"I ordered a wide, but it was still too narrow.  I love my Vionic sandals, so this made me very sad. =("
3.0,Not as good of a quality as I expected for the price.  They are okay.  I have gotten better at the &#34;Swap Meet&#34; for less of a price.
3.0,does not fit as expected.
3.0,"This is a cute top, but the arms fit small.  I got a 3X  (I think that's the size I got) and the arms fit kinda snug, but the rest of the top seemed to fit larger than expected.  It did not hang long enough to completely cover my hips."
3.0,Too thin and ankle doesn’t go high as I thought it would
3.0,the size was smaller
3.0,Haven't worn this top.  Looks good
3.0,[[VIDEOID:d89066c8f659f7ab61a2db0d20357c5f]] It is well made but for women with leas curves. It quite revealing too so not  meant for me. It is high cut . I might wear it with swim skort. It didn’t do any slimming for me.
3.0,"I had bought this as a swimsuit cover up for this summer. The material is light. Cute and flowy. However I am 5’9 and for me it is kinda short, just below the knee. My aunt has the same one she’s same height as I, and hers is super long! I would buy again if more colors were available. I give 5 stars<br /><br />UPDATE:  after washing it several times and air drying, it started to come apart. At the straps and at the hem on the back side. Not happy about this! After knowing this has happened so quickly I do not recommend. I give 3 stars."
3.0,"I haven’t worn it yet, the sizing was a bit smaller than I expected. The material feels thin which worries me a bit. Super cute when I tried it on."
3.0,"My daughter purchased this dress for me for my husband's funeral. The neckline was so low, there was no way I could wear it. The picture is extremely deceiving!"
3.0,The foot is too long. Bunches in toes or heels hang out of shoe.
3.0,Too small to fit my calves so can't use as leg warmers but make great arm warmers
3.0,"I purchased this because the description stated it was belt mounted. HSGI has a line of belt mounted pouches with hook and loop. This is not direct belt mount. The back is molle compatible and it comes with HSGI molle straps for adapting to a belt. I do not like the straps as they are a hard plastic and they protrude below a duty belt looking unsightly and also cause comfort issues as they can stick into you. Not a bad product, just not what is stated in the description. I wish the seller would provide a picture of the back of the product. HSGI does not provide pictures of the back of their products on their website either.<br /><br />The product appears well made and durable. The cover for the cuffs seems quite long and would not fit snugly over S&W chain cuffs. I believe it is oversized to accommodate a variety of cuffs. I returned it as it was not what I was hoping for."
3.0,"The sweater dress was adorable and very flattering to my figure; However, being 30 now it was wwwwwaaaayyyyy too short for me. I am only 5""4 and it feel about an inch and a half below my butt. If I was looking for more of a tunic style to wear with leggings, this would have worked great."
3.0,"Shirt is much baggier than I expected, and the material is almost like a napkin.  It isn't itchy but the comfort level isn't great.  Not my favorite at all but needed it in a hurry so it worked.  Would consider buying more if I could find a different material."
3.0,"Not received as pictured . . . Missing the red loop, but great sturdy quality will be sending back to purchase the original color and red loop"
3.0,"First I will take responsibility for not fully reading/understanding the product info section. However....<br />The photo for the trio linked stainless steel metal bands shows black, silver and gold(rose gold?) each with matching frames. It also shows a separate black frame. When I saw the picture and read the description I misunderstood this to mean the correct color frames were included AS WELL AS an additional black frame. You only get the one black frame and no matching frame for the gold or silver bands. I purchased this item because I thought I'd be getting the full sets.<br /><br />On a good note, while I've not yet worn the bands, they are very beautiful out of the box. These will be perfect for wearing to work to make a nicer impression than the standard rubber band, and classier than the leather. The black is a nice dark gunmetal, and the silver is your average link watch color. The gold is an interesting color, a bit of a bronze tinge to it, not necessarily rose gold as I'd expect? Considering I now have to buy matching frames, and looking at the reviews in the picture, I'm not sure if I should be ordering the gold frame or rose gold frame offered by this seller. If the seller could respond and assist me with figuring this out it would be much appreciated.<br /><br />PS at the time of my purchase there were no reviews for the linked bands. Hopefully this is helpful if you were interested in the."
3.0,Cute dress - kind of cheaply made.  Flimsy.  It served the purpose for the Hawaiian Father Daughter dance.
3.0,"It's a pretty necklace. One of the chains was loose when it arrived.  I will need to glue it back.<br />Because it is pretty, I don't plan to return it."
3.0,"Shirt is as pictured - button up, long sleeved, ruffled bottom, fake leather accents around the neck collar, end of sleeves, and fake pocket flaps. Silver buttons are pretty. Comes with a fake leather belt that has two rows of grommeted holes on one end.  Ordered to fit bust size according to their sizing chart. The fit is ok, not great. Even though my bust size should have fit per their sizing chart, this shirt is cut for a fuller, larger cupped woman. If you're smaller cupped like myself, then it fits very floppy in the front. The waist actually fit fine even with my belly, except that the shirt starts to split and flare out the bottom ruffles above my belly button. If you're not ok with having an exposed belly you'll need to wear a camisole underneath or wear it with a very high waisted skirt to cover the skin. The belt adds a nice accent and helps to define the waist a bit more, but unless you have it centered with the grommets, it looks off centered. Not great if you're a larger waisted woman and can't tighten the belt that far. This is more of a personal preference though and may not be an issue for others. The neck collar also feels off. When it's tightened all the way it presses against my throat almost like a choker, which I don't really like. If I adjust it to the next hole, it looks too loose. Material wise, it's thin and stretchy. Like the feel of the actual shirt fabric. Can easily move my shoulders and arms. The fake leather accents are very thin and cheap looking though. Belt is made of the same cheap looking fake leather. Feels like one snag and it'll rip apart, but hopefully with light usage and care it'll be ok. If you're a very buxom, traditional hourglass figure this would likely be a great fit. Unfortunately for me I took a chance and it didn't work out this time."
3.0,cute color but unless your actually shaped with that amount of curves or are ok with hoping for the best. it's cute  and &#34;fun&#34; to put on lol
3.0,It would have been better if RUN wasn’t folded — RU in one side and N in another...  I’m keeping it but... meh...
3.0,I was very happy with the dress but it shrank after I washed it and it no longer fits
3.0,"Nice soft material, matte black is good color and they appear to be decent quality. But they run VERY BIG. Initially when I put them on it seemed they were just a little roomy, nothing thick socks wouldn't fix. Or so I thought.  By mid day they were creasing around my foot because they are so loose & the ankles sort of bulge out.  Too late for return since I wore them for 1/2 day. Would order again in smaller size except Im not paying again so I will work with these as best I can."
3.0,"This would've been a fiver except the seller refused to take it back for repair after only ONE use! The bottom strap broke away from the main bag after what must have been a rough night for the bag, sitting next to me for a couple of hours in the theater.True,it had to wait almost five minutes (if you can at all stand it) for the Perrier delivery but please...that was fairly tolerable for the bag, I'm sure. All right, so I find a repair shop, deliver said bag to the master craft leatherer (sp?)and front the money for the repair. Then I would be reimbursed? Ok I guess I can deal...WHAT?! You're not paying anything...at all? Oh my...I feel faint. I think I should sit down...oh...I am sitting.<br />Y'all get the picture? I should drop it down to two stars, that'll teach 'em...nevermind...nobody reads these anyway. ;&#60;}<br /><br />Stay away from this seller. You've been warned."
3.0,"The material and comfort are good, but It was too clingy for me.  I kept it for wearing around the house."
3.0,Too short on the arms
3.0,"Very cheap, should be $5, it is stretchy, but made and feel cheap. You have to put the string through the holes yourself"
3.0,A bit smaller than I’d like
3.0,not very thick.  It somewhat keeps my ears warm.
3.0,"These look nice and seem to be good quality, but they come undone easily."
3.0,I do like but even though I knew the size of them I was hoping the beads would be just a little bit bigger.  Great bracelets for the price!  Really like the style.
3.0,"I mean, I like it enough to wear it, but the beads kinda go all over the place, which is a draw back. It was made more for men, I think, so my wrist is a little too small. Other than that, it's as expected."
3.0,"I like them but they are not black & grey. They’re black and “sparkly”... really just wanted something low-key, but I guess I have to be all “fancy” now."
3.0,"NEVER WORN! I hand washed these upon receiving them.  When they air dried, black marks appeared.  I rinsed again and the black marks disappeared but showed up in other areas after drying.  I’m afraid to wear them and have them do the same on my clothes.<br />They seem like they will be very comfortable and have breathable material in the back."
3.0,"These pants are very cute and I wish they fit, but unfortunately, I will be returning them.<br />It's somewhat rare that high-waisted pants look good on me, so I shouldn't be that surprised. Still, these were not flattering. I ordered a small and the waist fit well (my waist is 26&#34;), but the butt was baggy. Besides this, the thighs were too tight. My midthigh is only about 19&#34; around, but these were too tight there yet baggy in the butt. Because of this, I don't think a larger size will be any more flattering. Too bad because these are very cute!"
3.0,I'm a medium so I ordered a large and it's still too small. The material is nice though
3.0,head hole was really small so if you have a child with  a big head don't get this or maybe figure out how to shrink their head or make the hole bigger
3.0,"I have other Swarovski pieces and this one just didn't 'wow' me.  The sparkle from the stones seems minimal, and the solid silver band that crisscrosses over the top of the ring sits much higher than the other bands, making it look awkward.  Returning for a refund."
3.0,"It's cute, but I used it to give my loose fitting dress a slight fitting in the back,  the hooks dosen't stay put while I sit or during any activity. Never used it on cardigans yet."
3.0,"So, I ordered the black and white vans checkered lanyard but instead received an all black lanyard with vans written in white lettering around it.  In my opinion it's cheaply made but I'll just keep it because it's not worth going through all the hassle to return it.  I got it for my son for His Christmas Stocking and he'll just like it because of the brand name on it.  A bit disappointed though that it was not the one I had originally picked out for him."
3.0,A medium is like a small and a large is like a large.<br /><br />Wheres my normal fitting button up shirt?
3.0,It's for swimming but there is no support on top which I need
3.0,The sweater had a bizarre scent that took a week to air out. Teenage DD claimed it when everyone else found the yarn texture to be cheap. Has improved with washing but if not purchase again
3.0,"The chain for this necklace was useless as the clasp seemed to be painted shut and it couldn't be opened. I had to cut the chain to get the key off and then used my own chain. The key is awesome, though."
3.0,Ok shirt. Design was a little smaller than expected.
3.0,"I love the outfit, however, it does not fit my boobs. I wear and XL in everything ."
3.0,I BUY NOTHING BUT BETSEY. I WAS DISAPOINTED IN THE COLORS. LOOKS GREAT IN THE PICTURE. I STILL LIKE IT BUT BETSEYS HAS MUCH MORE OUT THERE I CAN BUY. THANKS BETSEY....YOUR THE BEST
3.0,"The bracelets are beautifully bright and buttery soft. Big enough for adult to wear. But they reek! I can only compare it to cat urine…gross. I thought it was because it was a big pile of plastic, but individually, the bracelets stink really bad too. So, they look cute wearing them in photos, but going out in public with them? Well, hopefully the smell fades over time. But I doubt it."
3.0,I got yellow. It was odd coloring. I can't really describe it. Other than that it was a good quality material. Fits Tru to size.
3.0,"Wish I could give 5 stars because the quality of the wristband! But the clipper and bottle opener broke off the day I got it, other than that I love the clip accent so I can take off my car key before putting it in the ignition."
3.0,Very nice t-shirt. Very soft and stretchy . It does run on the bigger size. I'd suggest a size smaller than you normally wear.
3.0,Too bulky around the arch.
3.0,"First, it wasn’t one unit. It came in 4 pieces. That’s not really a huge deal. It just wasn’t what I expected. The waist part is perfect though. The coverage is good and it stays in place when I run. The thighs on the other hand...not-so-perfect. It slides when I run and the velcro doesn’t hold. I probably won’t even attach the thigh wraps for my next workout."
3.0,Material was cheep looking.  '&#34;ordered in a grey. Thinner material to my type of yoga pant
3.0,"It’s a nice kimono. BUT it was not white, it was like a custardy color which was not what I expected."
3.0,Nice top just not for me. I am a large C cup sometimes D depending on the brand of bra. I felt like I did not have much support with this swim top. My breasts kept wanting to come out from the bottom. Not good if you like to be active at the lake. The material was nice and pretty though!
3.0,"Adorable swim suit! Love the color! I ordered a Med. I'm normally a small because I have a very short upper torso. A Med. doesn't fit. But, I have a bad feeling that a Large is going to be too big."
3.0,Received bracelets although they are cute. They look used and couldn't tell the difference between the gold and rose gold one.
3.0,"The fabric is LOVELY and the dress fit really well but...the strap broke and several stitches on the collar popped the very first time I wore it. I guess when it was sewn it wasn't sewn with a stitch that allows any give, and the fabric is a bit stretchy.<br />I still love the dress, and I can't wait to wear it again once I've fixed it.<br />I can't review the baby dress, because they didn't have a size small enough to fit my six-month old. I'll have to wait until next summer for her to wear it."
3.0,Fit nice but can't work out in them hard. The gray u can see all the sweat and they get heavy and strech when they get sweaty. I love how they look on me when I'm not sweating tho!
3.0,"Although the style, fabric feel and weight, and length were great on this nightie, the fit was a bit too narrow in the hips for my hubby's grandma.  We will try another size for a better fit."
3.0,Okay-cheap material and thi
3.0,"I like these socks, for the price they seem well made.  However, I wear a size 7.5 - 8 and I wouldn't order them if you have a larger shoe size."
3.0,"Unfortunately, this garment was not what I expected. The material is really just a large sheet of swimsuit material that's been sown into a poncho. The description states that it's cotton, but it's not even a cotton blend. The good thing about that, I guess, is that it won't wrinkle on you. I purchased a Small for my girlfriend who is 5'-2&#34; and 115lbs. I think you have to have a very good body for this to appear flattering."
3.0,"I ordered a large thinking that it would probably shrink a bit not that I needed a large but the large fit too snug.  Material not very soft. I originally bought this for a gift for someone that wears a size 8, same as me."
3.0,somewhat small. my daughter with a size three now gets my expensive socks.
3.0,Didn’t fit like other colors. The animal print fit great and looked good the other two that I ordered in different colors were too small and didn’t look good
3.0,"The reason I say it's okay, because it is actually a beautiful pocketbook, but I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to convert it into a backpack, but I am keeping it because it is a beautiful pocketbook."
3.0,"The earrings are great quality but I was expecting a matching set instead of the initial letter and the stud. I think there needs to be made very clear. The packaging is was cute, but I think it could be better...something to match the elegance of the jewelry."
3.0,"A couple of the earrings worked wonderfully, but there were a couple that would get stuck if screwed in a little too much."
3.0,"its a lovely bracelet, but nothing like the picture... dissappointing but still nice."
3.0,"Got it today with one of the nose pieces broken. Other than that, feels like good quality. Dont really fit my round face but ill wear them anyways."
3.0,"The coverup is cute and comfortable.  There are a few issue.  First the material is very thin (you can almost see through it).  I ordered an extra large yet I feel I could have easily gotten a size smaller.  Because the quality of the material is rather cheap, I gave this 3 stars."
3.0,The size it is too small.
3.0,Is pretty but it fits small. Maybe go a size bigger. The fabric makes it look a bit cheap. Style is nice though
3.0,"Good, but bigger than expected for a small"
3.0,Not thick or strong enough to hold belly still.
3.0,The torso is very long and the fit was very tight.  I am short waisted so had to return
3.0,I returned didnt work for me.  It is nice quality leather
3.0,Would be really pretty if it fit as expected
3.0,Whyyyyy must these run so small and you don’t have bigger sizes?? I wear a 12-14 in women’s jeans and bought the xls and they fit more like a small/medium.
3.0,"The crossbody purse looks stunning. Material feels great, as it should for this brand, color is nice. Over all good purse however it’s very small. Not much can fit besides a cell phone, small wallet, car keys, and a small lip glass."
3.0,Everything was cool but I’m completely missing 10g
3.0,"Cute, but cheap.  One of the straps arrived unattached.  A spot of glue will fix, so not a big deal, but disappointing at the same time."
3.0,"Got this for postpartum recovery and nursing. This material feels very waterproof like, but isn’t. It gets the job done but could be way more comfortable"
3.0,"It is nice, but defiietly for a small child more so than a teen."
3.0,"The waist has no stretch I'm normally a small and I ordered a medium and it would not go past my thighs let alone over my butt. Looks like the picture, good quality poor fit."
3.0,"beautiful color. one of the rings earrings had an unnecessary loop, need to break it off."
3.0,"I was super excited getting this for my 3yr old. It fits her well & she's worn it several times. What is disappointing is that the leggings are extremely thin so, not at all good for Fall/Winter. Also, the color on the leggings faded after the 1st wash."
3.0,"Was not what I expected, I did read the reviews witch gave mix opinions, looks way better in pics, Material is definitely a flimsy type of material see-through type, I feel because it’s see-through type that design does not look like the photo posted. Fits well no complaints there.  Am a 38 bust as. 31 waist si a little chunky and slipped right through.."
3.0,I am 5’2” 145lbs and 34C cup. I normally wear size 6 in pants and small tops. I purchased a size medium in this swimsuit and it was very small. The bottoms were too tight and was cheeky. I do have a butt so sometimes I do struggle with bottoms but never the top. This top squeezed me as well and was too tight in the busy which rarely happens. It was a cute suit so I may end up returning for a larger size.
3.0,The picture is misleading.
3.0,Size is off!  I like the athletic works plunge bra the best
3.0,"Wanted some lightweight cool shorts for the summer but being curvy I need some longer shorts or else they just keep riding up. These shorts were very comfy and stretchy, great for lounging. They weren’t as loose/relaxed fit as I would have liked - they were fine everywhere but tight in the hips making the pockets buckle which just makes it look more unflattering …<br /><br />The material rubs a bit as you walk (not a smooth swish but friction rub), and it ends up riding up a bit. I tried moving the waist band to high rise and low rise but just couldn’t get it to a position where it wouldn’t ride up. It’s not as bad as other shorts but I’m pretty sure I’d be constantly fiddling with them. So great for lounging, but not for walking around and being active. Decided to return."
3.0,Very stiff material and no waste.  Fit a bit snug for an XL when i typically wear a Large.  Also not as long as it looks in picture.
3.0,"I was nervous when these arrived because they were laying flat and looked super boxy / flat at the seams, so I was surprised to find they do actually fit well and work well. It's worth noting that they do have tiny bumps on the bottom (presumably for longevity), though they don't provide much traction (maybe ""slightly less slippery"" but definitely not good grip). I generally wear my neoprene (or waterproof) socks inside water shoes or booties, and although the bumps weren't uncomfortable for that use, I did notice the thick sock seams. If you're not planning to wear shoes or walk a lot in the socks these should be fine to use; they do insulate as well as you would hope"
3.0,"These are actually not a super-bright red, they appear to be a reddish carnelian color that is fairly dull under normal lighting.  (Much more vivid under flash photography!)  This bead could not accurately be described as a &#34;pearl&#34; at all, although it is a &#34;spherical bead,&#34; so it does appear as if some language difficulties are at play here.  As long as you understand how this actually looks, you should avoid disappointment.  It's not a terrible earring at all, and the packaging isn't completely lacking.  For the price, it isn't a bad bargain.  If this is being purchased as a gift, however, I'd say there are better alternatives.  Dime for size comparison."
3.0,"While these earrings are definitely cute, they are not 8mm -- more like 5-6mm.  I'm going to keep them, but would have preferred something just a little larger."
3.0,This is our second one. It's perfect for a skirt we have. However after a year the glue that holds the pleather laces seams unglued. And it had to be tossed. For the price I just bought it again.
3.0,"I got what I expected.  It was OK.  I didn't pay for some high end wig and beard and I got what I paid for.  One size fits most is probably accurate, but the population that would find this tight is probably pretty big.<br /><br />And who sells a costume moustache that isn't already &#34;sticky?&#34;<br /><br />Still got lots of guffaws at the 80s themed party."
3.0,"Quality shirt - fits like juniors sizes, not womens"
3.0,"While I adore the theme of this jacket, the print on it faded A LOT after only one wash. I'm slightly bummed out because the print now looks like I've worn it a whole lot more than I actually have. It also shrunk a bit after the first wash (which was expected)."
3.0,Love the printing & material. Just runs small.
3.0,"Beautiful purse, but way too small for the price."
3.0,The strap at the top was stretched out (too big) and it didn't sit on me well. I wish the fabric was a little more tight and hugging.
3.0,The first 2 layers were so tight I couldn't even hook it. I'm not the thinnest person but in no way is my neck abnormally large. Not sure why they were so tight. Very cute necklace. Super disappointed it wouldn't fit. The necklace only has a couple options for length adjustment. Really wish it had more.
3.0,"My daughter wears 18 months in most clothing and can fit in some 2t if it's snug fit. I bought the 18-24 month size and it's easy too big. It is more like a 2-3t. It's adorable and the shirt is super soft. However, the pants look like leggings in the picture and were so baggy on my daughter...probably due to the sizing. I'd say...order a size smaller than needed."
3.0,"Decent quality, pretty with a cute bow. Careful will pick easily. Runs large on my daughter’s dainty wrists (not a tapered fit)."
3.0,"Technically, the dress fit perfectly. But it's a bit hard to contend with with a large bust. The dress doesnt really lend itself to a bra (I tried, but the straps are way too visible, as you see in the photo.) The waist is high, which can give the appearance of a low bust; in my experience, a strapless does not provide enough boost to overcome this. I like that it's not plunging, but at the same time, the fuller coverage creates a mild uni-boob effect. Overall, I think it makes me look heavier than I really am.<br /><br />Fabric is a little cheap if you care about such things (I don't, really) but I like that it's cut well/ well structured.<br /><br />That said, the size small fit perfectly. For reference, I'm 5'6"", 125-130 lbs. 30FF, and probably a 27-28"" waist. Dress hits right at the knee."
3.0,Butterfly fell off first  time I  wore it
3.0,"The stuff is nice, it runs quite big though, color is also nice but fitting is issue but i kept it because i liked it though i look like a baggy in it. Would appreciate if could introduce more colors and a better fitting."
3.0,i really like it but it has o about a 4 in stain or something the fabic right down in the middle from the neck
3.0,This piece did fade quickly and also started to itch my neck it was ok for the price but only good for a couple of uses.
3.0,It fit everywhere except the girls. I bought the 6xl. I have a 44DD and the chest area was still huge on me. I even altered it and its still too big. It fits everywhere else though.
3.0,For the price you can't expect great products. So I'm not going to complain just gonna say that I rather pay more for better quality. So I had to return them. The price should tell you already this is not quality
3.0,I like it but the writing is so hard to read/see.<br />Wish it was bigger print.
3.0,"I ordered 4 colors. Fit is true to size. Shorts are light weight and loose, therefore they ride up. Forever reaching up skirt to pull them down. Basically wearing a short skirt."
3.0,I like it. I like the look. It is just a little big and bulky for my liking but will keep it and use it for its intended purpose.
3.0,"Pretty from a distance, but appears very cheap close up. Actually, for the price, it's not too bad."
3.0,I loved this shirt before it faded after a few washes.
3.0,I really like the style and colors. Ordered my usual size but it was way to small
3.0,I got a size small I’m 5’4” and 100lbs I usually wear a 00 in jeans and shorts sometimes a 0 and I read in the reviews that it ran small so I wasn’t worried about it being too big but they were huge. It fit me like a large but they are super cute and seem like very good quality but I have to return and they don’t have an extra small size :((
3.0,"Almost got sent back ! One of the gem hearts was loose in the package when it got here, off of the bracelet ! My wife liked the sentiment of it from me and said we can glue it back on . Quality is lacking in production !lol"
3.0,A little sheer
3.0,Overall quality is ok.  I’m very average size and the sleeves are super short.  I just leave them unbuttoned at the cuff and it looks ok.  The button holes are very small so if you plan to button or unbutton it takes time and a little finesse. I spent a lot of time pulling out random threads from the seams.  You get what you pay for.
3.0,Exactly what I thought I’d get
3.0,"Ordered one black as XL and fit was perfect, loved! So reordered same size in white and fit is small. Putting shirts back to back the white XL is much smaller in width and length than the black XL."
3.0,"At first I received a shiny plastic belt even though the description said it was stretchy fabric.  But I sent it back and got the correct belt.  I like the concept of the belt because I hate when my belt buckle makes my stomach look bigger than it is-I don't need help in that dept!  I use it for jeans, and I wish that it was wider to fill the belt loops for jeans.  The magnet is strong, it hasn't ever popped open on me."
3.0,"The necklace is gorgeous, however, not pleased with the way the earrings set on my ear. The latter should not in anyway discourage the purchase...it is a beautiful set. I just prefer a flat fit against my ear. Enjoy it."
3.0,Very cute and comfy but they snag easily
3.0,Way to much for a beanie 👎👎👎
3.0,only works on phones with headphone jack on top.
3.0,"The peplum was not as long as I thought it would be. The material is comfortable and it fit a snug for my taste. It worked out for what I wanted, however."
3.0,"Fit well. Poor manufacturing, weird seems that are too long. The shirts ride up when running so I would not recommend for high impact/intensity workout"
3.0,I have lots of these glasses in different strengths. They vary in fit. Some better than others. They are also delicate.
3.0,R the price gd
3.0,"Seems to be good quality but the color is very important to me. I think the picture is miss leading and they<br />don't have pink, so they send you what they think is pink."
3.0,"Time will tell.  A bit stiff, and as I have a high instep they fit a bit snug, although I ordered one size up.  ( I wear a 9, ordered a size 10.) Perhaps will loosen up a bit with wear.  Fine for shower shoes, just not real comfortable for long term wear such as Teva Mush, etc.....  although as they are rubber, I do not expect them to get as &#34;funky&#34; as other flip-flops that are more comfortable.  Appear durable, and should last.  Three stars because they are ok, but not what I would consider great compared to something that can be purchased locally for less at big box stores."
3.0,"This is a deep blue and i wanted more of a Royal blue , also it’s very long. Having it hemmed , nice lining which is great  but length and shade of blue are not satisfactory. I am 5’2” …. so the length might be perfect on a taller lady. This  item in the print colors, a different story--This dress or Top is absolutely beautiful in the dark blue or Black, it is horrible in the prints. The prints all have no lining and are made of material that does not work, it wrinkles and looks very, very inexpensive. Yes, i get that it did not cost a lot...however it is totally ok in black, nice lining and expected fit....the print fabrics hugged me like a vise. The print fabrics very tight and not nice at all. Even though this item is advertised as being offered in both solids and prints, the prints need their own lisitng .It is really not the same top/dress once the buyer tries to order this in the colors that look so nice online."
3.0,"To heavy for regular wear, but I guess I should have figured on that coming from outside the US."
3.0,The style of the shoe is great and exactly what I ordered.  Bit they were hard to get on my feet.....very tight
3.0,Started to tear super easily. Not at all lined. It’s hard out here.
3.0,It has been returned.  I didn't like the material.  I gave it 3 stars because its cute.
3.0,"The quality is very good.  The problem is with the sizing.  I normally wear a medium top, but based on the size chart I ordered an XL.  It was still WAY too small."
3.0,hard to keep it lever on her chest
3.0,"Nice quality fabric and design, but the pads are very flimsy and constantly fold and look lumpy. Not the look I want under my workout tops."
3.0,"They look good, but I'm unsure how well the elastic will hold up.  It seems a little flimsy.  They also need to be a little heavier so they will st in place better.  We've had them less than a week.  We'll see."
3.0,"I wear it as a beach cover up, it's a little too shapeless for a dress and the weight of the material just drags it down. Not super flattering as a dress, but great for beach, pool, or lounging."
3.0,Perfect colors and material felt soft.  I did not like waist band -too thick- could not gift these fearing they would not fit properly  with that type of elastic.
3.0,Watch is attractive and seems to function properly however band is not of highest quality and difficult to adjust compared to many that have spring loaded pins.
3.0,The blouse is very pretty but if you are large chested it won't fit.
3.0,"A little stiff, but it gets the job done"
3.0,cheap as expected for the price  but pretty
3.0,Too tight in chest and arms. Flows nicely over hips.
3.0,I did not like the material. I found it harsher than i wanted.  However it served its purpose until i could find the right one on my online shopping.
3.0,"going to buy 50"" but i used to have within this year i purchsed infinitey hoope from amazon and they were perfect"
3.0,"This shirt does not even button up and it is supposed to be a 'classic fit' XXL. My friend wears a L/XL depending on brands, and this one fits him almost perfectly. He said it fits just like the other XL slim fit shirts that he has. There is no way they are sizing these accurately for an XXL classic fit."
3.0,Bigger than expected and looks like the were dipped in a silver coat.  Kinda cheap looking
3.0,"The hooks are a little crooked... but nothing a quick tweak can't fix.<br />The size is nice, visible but not overpowering to look at on.<br />Very pretty concept.<br />Yes, they are quite flat in the back.<br /><br />The main thing that annoyed me was that the petals aren't very smooth- the metal is a bit irregular (some bits frosted others smooth-ish and a scratch or two that aren't really noticeable unless you really look). I mean, people don't seem to care but I think it was a reason enough to dock a star, especially considering I had to file one of the petals for some extra metal hanging off the side....dock another for that....<br /><br />Other: The gold bits don't hang out as far as the picture on mine, if you care.<br /><br />All in all they are still very pretty though and for the price, I think I'm still good with this purchase. I should note, however, I do a lot of crafts at home and having a few fine tools to work with was able to make the adjustments I wanted more easily than the average person might though."
3.0,Ran small. I had to give it to my daughter.
3.0,It’s nice it true to size<br />The only I don’t like is it’s super transparent
3.0,"Shipping took forever, shirt is a bit smaller than it should be, but looks good otherwise. I suggest order a size up."
3.0,"Go a size up. The dress is stretchy, but is designed for petite people. An XL was too small in the shoulders, and far too short for me. I'm 5' 8&#34; and 165lbs (I usually wear an XL or size US 12)."
3.0,Pretty dress in beautiful colors. I just wasn’t aware that the whole back was out. Hard to wear to work without wearing a sweater or jacket over it.
3.0,"While this looks like a cute, loose fitting, easy tee, the reality is that it runs way small. The model must have sized up at least 2 and maybe 3 sizes to get ""the look"". Otherwise, it might be okay but I'll be passing it on to someone who can wear it. I can't speak to how it wears or washes because I wasn't able to get a decent look."
3.0,"It’s a crop top sure, but unless you want a total underboob hanging out, this isn't the top for you."
3.0,"Questionable quality, but look at the price.<br /><br />Vote for Trump in November."
3.0,I love having this but the wire frame feels to bulky too wear. A smaller clasp would be lovely.
3.0,Product broke after one use when they fell on the floor.
3.0,So small for these thiqq thighs
3.0,"Did not stretch, washed it and was really wrinkled have to iron every time before wearing"
3.0,"I got this dress as a gift for my friend to celebrate a new job. She is apple shaped body, around 190, 5'6"". I ordered her the XL. The dress overall she absolutely loved. The fabric is great. Sleeves perfect length. The colors perfect. The length is just right... but there is NO ROOM for you if you have breasts anything larger than a B cup with this dress (maaaaybe a C cup, if you're pushing it). I returned it and we were both very sad. If the chest had more room, it would have been the perfect dress for her."
3.0,"We ordered these for my daughter's birthday party. Only 8 of the advertised 10 headbands were in the package, and the Dalmation headband was missing an ear. They are not sturdily made or worthy of the price."
3.0,Way too small but they are very cute. I need to lose about 20 lbs to fit in these!
3.0,"It was too big, the material sticks to me, and it's hang dry for sure."
3.0,"Again, while it checked the sizing chart and took measurements, it was still a bit too tight. Even a few inches would have made all the difference...I do wish there had been more options...that and there is no zipper so I had to pull it over my head with the underwire poking everywhere. Aside from all of that, it's very pretty and Hubby is very pleased."
3.0,What I didn’t like about this product was it seemed it was a Used shirt. It came in the bottom of a plastic bag all bunched up . It was not package like a new shirt.
3.0,ORDER UP AT LEAST 2 SIZES!!!
3.0,"looks and feel great, but will hike up every single.time you bend down, twist, sit, etc. If you're willing to keep pulling tank down evert 3 minutes then get it."
3.0,"I really liked how this shoe looked, and it is comfortable. However it fits sloppily. The length is correct and the ankle strap of course adjustable to fit, but the black strap that goes from the toes to the back of the heel is loose. So when you walk the shoe flaps like a flip-flop. Very disappointing"
3.0,Decent enough craftsmanship and over all a nice product for the price. Can't say the goat leather smell is great. Doesn't smell good like cow or even horse hide. Hope it fades in time.
3.0,"Glasses are cute, look more like fashion glasses, However, the don't sit flush against your face. I work in a hospital with COVID patient s and purchased for eye protection but can't use them due to large gap s."
3.0,"Ordered clip, but got post. Luckily my daughter liked them."
3.0,They are OK. A little pricey for what you get but my wife will still like them.
3.0,Cord already broke but still keeps me warm
3.0,"Would have been a full 5 but it's not what I ordered. It came in black, still pretty but not what I ordered."
3.0,"Cute dress, but the long sleeves are too short and flare out. Otherwise, this is a cute dress. Will exchange for a different sleeve length."
3.0,Very thin material. Not what you want if you're looking for something warm. But love the print.
3.0,"Nice jacket for the price, love that I can change it out for the seasons. I’ve always had children’s place combo jackets, but they don’t have the color selection my daughter would like.<br /><br />Changing my review due to the loops that attach the sleeves to the outer jacket breaking almost immediately. More recently the loop you’d hang the jacket from has broken. Overall still a nice jacket, just wish the little parts held up better to make it easier to use."
3.0,Ran small. When washing gets even smaller and tight
3.0,"These glasses are not as nice as I thought they would be. In the picture, they seemed more slim and trendy. In person, the frames are chunky and they look a little cartoonish, almost plastic. I ordered the because I needed reading glasses all the time now, in the store, reading labels etc., and for that purpose, they work great. I was happy it came in a pack of four, because I can leave them where I need them, and don’t have to remember to bring them with me. I have them in my car, purse, laptop bag and home, so for that…I’m happy with them, the bags to keep them in is nice to have, but I would have liked them to look less thick."
3.0,"Cute appearing dress, fits as expected and looks like the picture. The material is quite chintzy and ripped after one wear but tolerable for the price."
3.0,"I wish i could have gotten a black one instead , even though it hasn't arrived yet I need a wallet and since everyone has a black one this might work out. I first started out looking for the wallet that acts like magic you put money in close it and it automatically inserts itself into the wallet. It is not RFID protected so I figure this is better for adults like myself and the other for teenagers even though my friend has one and hes about 37 yrs old. I think I made the right choice but what are the chances of someone walking by and stealing my account infomation ..slim to none ..but it only takes one knuckle head to do it and a big headache for me afterwards...well imagine what one will you want to pull out in fronts of the ladys the magic wallet or this sophisticated ha ha rest my case and have my money safe and safe from the embarrassment!"
3.0,"Ordered this dress for a rehearsal dinner. I read reviews and it sounded like this dress ran really small. I decided to order a large (my normal size is a small). I reviewed the dress and it was huge! The length was good, but the waist was much bigger than I expected and was TTS. This dress is good quality for the price. I sent it back, but it was a cute option."
3.0,they are just basic frames
3.0,This shirt is beautiful but the sleeves are much smaller than the shirt size. The material is very see through!
3.0,Good pack for what my son used it for but it's not a very rugged pack.  The mesh pockets that hold water bottles on the side of the pack already have holes in them and that's just from using it as a carry-on bag on the airline.
3.0,"Returning these. Not comftable and strange fit. Wide on ankles and scratchy, thick fabric."
3.0,"Perhaps the chain is stainless steel, but the pendant itself is not. It's been tarnishing, turning pink where it contacts my skin."
3.0,I like the message on it
3.0,super cute but way too heavy to wear for long periods of time.
3.0,"These were MUCH lighter in color than pictured (I got Silver Grey).  I was looking for a dark grey, these are closer to white. Quality and size is good though."
3.0,shirt is really cute but sizes run extemely small
3.0,"I didn't realize it didn't come with costume pants. The jacket is your typical, thin costume fabric. Also, not ideal for long torso folks, the jacket is real close to looking like a crop top on my husband. Hahaha<br />The mask and the bowtie was really what he was after not the jacket so it worked out but important to mention."
3.0,Gave as a gift. Haven't heard. Want a black one for myself with just 5 pearls. My other one broke.
3.0,They break rather easy
3.0,"I can't say it is smaller or bigger than expected ...because in the chest and waist area, it is flowy. While it is a little bit tight around the neck!! Feels like it can be tight on my neck specially when i wear it for long hours!! Irritates my neck skin for a tiny bit!! But i still like the design..."
3.0,YOu have to measure yourself to order. I wear a size 6-8 and ordered a medium. It fit like an extra small.
3.0,"I bought these for scanning the hundreds of paper receipts that I seem to accumulate. I read that they are coated with a toxic plastic,so I decided to wear gloves while handling them. These seem to do the job. It's amazing how dirty they've become after just one day of use. I haven't washed them yet, so I don't know how they'll hold up after that, but will update after I do."
3.0,It's a good wig for a halloween costume.  It does arrive wrinkled so you have to ensure to straighten it somehow before using it.  I couldn't get all the wrinkles out of the hair. Fortunately I had a headpiece to cover the rest.
3.0,"I gained quite a bit of weight during COVID and am on the hunt for new clothes that are somewhat flattering. This top is ok. Plus side: it’s relatively long , the v-neck isn’t too low and the color is pretty accurate. What I don’t like is the silhouette, it fits a bit boxy. And the fabric is thick but feels a bit rough. Hopefully it will soften up after a wash."
3.0,"Please know, the undershirts run small.  I really like the quality"
3.0,They are what I expected and will serve its purpose.
3.0,"These earrings are a good price.<br /><br />However, my wife finds them a bit brassy. As another reviewer stated, no one is going to mistake these for expensive earrings. Worse, they are heavy, and not very comfortable to wear for more than a few hours.<br /><br />They don’t cause any irritation. The sparkle of the glass stones is nice.<br /><br />One thing my wife did not appreciate is the little card offering a $10 Amazon gift card if you email the seller, and, I assume, give a nice review in exchange.<br /><br />It’s one thing to offer a money back guarantee, or something similar. But offering a gift card if you email the seller seems a bit shady. Needless to say, we did not contact the seller.<br /><br />The packaging is nice enough, and my wife appreciates the micro fiber cleaning cloth that came with the earrings. But she doesn’t love the product, or the shadiness."
3.0,quality is iffy
3.0,stretches out pretty bad after just a couple times wearing them
3.0,This is a pretty coat but not what I expected . It is very light weight and not for winter weather more like for spring . I I ordered a medium and its a good fit for me being only  95lbs.
3.0,"I didn't know you had to spray the inside of the boots. My boots are lined. I sprayed inside and out, doesn't seem to have stretched much. I'll keep trying."
3.0,Just not what I was looking for.
3.0,Quality is ok but too small
3.0,It said they have safety shields which I assumed were once sides. Did not realize they were molded into the frames and were all around the entire lens.
3.0,I have ordered these in serval colors and have returned a few. Please size up regardless and f their sizing chart.
3.0,Very pretty shirt. Runs small and has a funny smell.
3.0,"The color looks like a wine red, but in reality, it’s hot pink. Tacky looking in hot pink"
3.0,I didnt mean to get white but perfect in a darker color
3.0,No arch support whatsoever
3.0,Fits great and very cut but the bow in the front is floppy and sloppy looking<br />Same price dresses at Target and much cuter.
3.0,"I wear a women's size 7 and these are uncomfortably tight; yes, I can SQUEEZE my feet and toes into the socks, yes, they are stretchy; however, once you DO manage to maneuver them on, they are TIGHT and NOT comfortable.  I can say that the colors are cute. I bought them for balance issues and will have to buy a different brand now."
3.0,heavy fabric.  fit is good.
3.0,Very uncomfortable to tight for extended uses. Works well but no way could wear for more then 10 minutes. I think these would be better for a kids size.
3.0,Comfortable to wear but the orange seems very faded for brand new ring. Was disappointed.
3.0,Warning this fits small. The material is ok but its a lint magnet. Other than that its a great buy.
3.0,quality should be better for such price
3.0,"I like that this nightgown is long - but unlike the red one I got last year, this one is not flannel.  It is a rather coarsely woven fabric - washes and dries well, but it is not all that soft for sleeping."
3.0,Nothing wish you had one in different colors
3.0,"It didn’t work for me. The material is not as expected and ran a bit small. Normally I’m a XL, but this is a bit snug… it’s doable but I prefer my pants to be loose."
3.0,"It's super cute and I love the color, but the seams on the bottom aren't done well. The top makes me look really flat chested. It is cute, but I probably wouldn't buy it again."
3.0,Nice velvet choker but the total length including the extension is very small. Be sure to measure you neck and compare against total length.
3.0,I like this V neck Shirt. Quality of this product is okay as compare to the price. The shipment process is way to long.
3.0,"When I put these on for the first time the crotch ripped. Otherwise the fit and look was amazing. When I told the seller what had happened they said they would send me a new pair, which would have been great, however that was a couple of months ago and I never received them :( So I’m still searching for that perfect pair."
3.0,"I bought this purse thinking that it would be three times the size ,have longer straps and pockets. It is nor has any of these things I intended on giving this to my mother for her birthday,but it way to small for someone who needs a big purse.I ended up keeping it.I mean it's cute but if I had known it is the way it is I definitely wouldn't have bought it. It is extremely over priced for what it is as well. No I'm out 30 bucks and I still don't have a birthday present for my mom."
3.0,"I needed new 1/4 zip shirts like these for work and didnt want to have to pay $20 each but these didnt fit at all. I ordered six different brands and all 2xl. These are the only ones I had to return because they are way too small. I'm 5'3"" 175lbs and ware these over a t-shirt for work."
3.0,Solid but too small.
3.0,Pedí talla M y me llego XL.<br /><br />No me queda
3.0,"I ordered a 34'' waste and as I tried them on, I had to check label since they felt like 32&#34; waist.  Must send back so suggestion is to order one size up.  I believe they will also shrink a bit so you don't want them to be tight especially since they are cargo shorts and should feel comfortable."
3.0,This is ok quality sweater. I got the medium and the arms are longer than my other medium clothes.
3.0,Order up one or two sizes. Good cheap shoe. Color does wear off on toes.
3.0,Style is lovely and the fit is just right
3.0,"These are certainly not ""athletic cushion"" socks as advertised. They are unsuitable for a lengthly hike. Although they have a nice look, I am afraid the elastic, which is primarily only at the top, will eventually stretch out and they will be hard to keep up. That hasn't happened yet... only my anticipation.<br /><br />The socks are certainly warm and toasty for lounging around my house or going to the office. The description is just plain wrong as to both fabric blend, use and they are a little pricey but they are reasonably nice socks."
3.0,Not too pleased with material. Doesn't look like any genuine leather I have ever purchased before.
3.0,I would call this more a change purse than a wallet.  You could throw a few credit cards and your DL if you want a compact holder but I will probably just leave it in my luggage for when I travel.
3.0,"This is not as advertised.  I 'm very disappointed in the length.  It's advertised as 41&#34; long which is the perfect length for me.  When I tried it on & looked in the mirror I could see my knees.  When I laid it flat it only measures 37&#34; instead of 41.  I had hoped to get more because it's light & otherwise quite comfortable, but do to length I'll not trust that seller again. JB"
3.0,"This sweatshirt looks very nice, but it would be more for man, according to the shape."
3.0,It's a bit tight as the material isn't very stretchy. The print is nice but after the first day wearing it the print is starting to peel like it was an iron-on decal.
3.0,"Good quality ample fit color not exactly as shown ,darker"
3.0,"This particular color looks nice online but I was dissapointed when I actually got it. However, it is a very good quality bag and looks very elegant."
3.0,"It was tiny, but it is super cute."
3.0,Theese are okay a lil big I think not as realistic but good if you want to dress up even to use around Halloween time for a punk look :) I think that they are overpriced!
3.0,"I have not worn this out-and-about yet, but when I tried it on, my two thoughts were 1) It's a bit small and 2) the lace doesn't seem very sturdy. I am 5'9&#34; and 125lbs, and cami sizes can be tricky to guess at. I ordered a small, and it fit, but was very form-fitting. I prefer it a little looser. For this reason, I would probably order a large next time. Not a bad purchase, just wish I had ordered a larger size. This will work for wearing under T-shirts, though."
3.0,"Cute, but too big. Have to return."
3.0,We bought the pajamas for our entire family (16 pair ) made our Christmas very enjoyable.  My only response is they were way overpriced for the quality especially the tops .
3.0,The insole was poor quality and wore off after wearing twice. But you can't expect much out of a cheap shoe.
3.0,"Cute and Good for the price, arrive early as expected"
3.0,"FIRST, I really, really like the purse!  Yes, it's big, but I carry a lot of stuff and it has room for everything I need.  I absolutely LOVE the color (I got the red one).  It's more a brick red, not bright at all.  BUT, I was terribly disappointed when within a WEEK, the button fell off!  And believe me, I was VERY, VERY careful every single time I opened the bag (which was probably only 4 or 5 times).  I made SURE that the loop would be loose before I unhooked it from the button so that there wouldn't be any pulling on the button, because I could just see it breaking or coming un-laced.......AND IT DID!  Since the purse is lined, there was no way to restring the button back on without cutting open the lining.  I did manage to tie the leather lace together on the underside of the button and it has so far stayed on, but I really don't have high hopes that it won't come off again.  I just think the button could have been attached in a better way so this wouldn't have happened."
3.0,The glasses fit a little to tight on my head. I dont have a very big head either so that was a bummer. They did work well on the vision and protection asppect.
3.0,"This ring is OK, honestly.  It's pretty but it doesn't look high quality.  I like the bee but I saw several of these at different brick and mortar stores that looked better."
3.0,"There a little bit to tight for a man, these are really for a women."
3.0,The swoosh on the front came off within days  with normal wear and washing/drying.
3.0,"Lots of space inside but this bag doesn’t close right, the magnet which is suppose to close is off to one side. So annoying and people even noticed it when I carry it. It’s like off centered."
3.0,"Size up!!!! I sized up 3 sizes and it still fits horribly. Item looks nothing like pictured. Very sheer, sleeves are bicep high as opposed to elbow. And the tie they show sits right across bustline. I can make it work for what's needed but be warned"
3.0,Wore this wig for Halloween. The wig was nice (color was perfect and the texture was soft) except for the very top by the part. You could see the cap and it wouldn't sit right. Ended up getting a head piece to cover and it was fine but I needed to cover it to make it look natural.
3.0,Material for bottoms was stretchy and had a weird consistency.  Headband was a finished strip of fabric that was way too long and sliprey to be a good headband.
3.0,Love this dress but the material is very thin.
3.0,"This hat is weird!<br />It's bulky,and tight...it's just uncomfortable!there is no way to get passed any of that.i wish I could have used a photo...but I looked so damn weird,I didn't.<br />I WOULDN'T PURCHASE AGAIN...AND WISHED I HADN'T PURCHASED BEFORE.<br />BUT...the material is lovely!"
3.0,The outfit fits
3.0,the studs were bend and almost broke when straightening them out
3.0,I ordered an 8 for my 2 year old daughter to grow into (she is a size 6) and she can barely fit her foot into it. I really have to pull and stretch at the opening to get it on and even then it is super tight.  They are super cute. It I would look elsewhere for a more comfortable fit.
3.0,Great material but too small.
3.0,"Fairly disappointed with the quality Of this product hovlwever it looks nice. The first day I got this product the zipper started to malfunction a but when I sorted the zipper issue out, it was ok"
3.0,Basic rain jacket for toddler
3.0,I thought it would be embroidered not just a print😔
3.0,Wife feels the color is off. It is almost grey and not cream or beige.
3.0,"Glasses look really cool.  Got many compliments.  These glasses, however, WILL have you squinting in the sun--they don't shade at all.  These are like an accessory to your outfit only"
3.0,"Its decent doesn't really fit well but also doesn't fade, so it was ok."
3.0,"I got this for a costume in a play and it worked but after, when i put it in the laundry, it lost its shape and frayed a bit. Not very durable. But it looks nice"
3.0,A little bigger than a regular bandana. Only has print on one side
3.0,"Ok this thing was HUGE,  far larger than anticipated. Can't complain about the quality or price.  But definitely NOT what *I* was looking for"
3.0,"These dresses are so close to perfect I could cry but I am sending them back. The material, style and colors are all phenomenal. The pockets are perfect and I wanted so much to make these dresses work (I ordered several colors in both long and short sleeve). However, in all of the dresses, the waist is just too high, making my torso look short and broad. Then the skirt starts at the bottom of my ribs, hiding my waist and making the short and wide appearance even worse. These dresses will likely work for people hiding weight on their stomach but for me they did not create the desired look. Sad.Sad.Sad. They are so pretty!"
3.0,"This jacket runs very small. The color was very light and washed out looking. I like the style, but I wasn't happy with the quality so I returned it."
3.0,"The hips part is tighter then the top fold part which looks uncomfortable, however the baby didn't complain! The top had lose threads... nothing a needle and thread didn't fix but that's the last  thing I want to do after buying a product"
3.0,Unfortunately I had to return item as it did not fit properly. Did not reorder…
3.0,"Love the fit, dont love that is very sheer. Definitely need to wear a shirt underneath unless your okay with your bra or boobs showing."
3.0,Didn’t really like the fit and was shorter than I expected from the picture. Still made a decent workout shirt
3.0,They are gold buckles not silver like the picture
3.0,"The fit was fine, I’d say the sizes are true to size. But upon oreading he reviews, I was u see the impression this ran long (which is what I need, being 5’9 and wanting to wear heels). The front of the dress didn’t even hit the ground while wearing flip flops, so there was no way I could wear heels. Good quality, but it was almost like the dress I received had been altered. Returned the next day"
3.0,I have another Bathing suit from this same make bout this same size as the other but this one is is to small . I would say size up !
3.0,"nice material. much larger than I expected, the smallest notch was still a little large for a toddler boy."
3.0,"Super cute minus the see through material. I was so sad it was see through b/c it was absolutely adorable. Size up if you have a booty. I’m 5’7”, 145 lbs, athletic build, bust 36, waist, 29, hips 41. I noticed some people it hit at the knee. This hit above mid thigh for me. I do have long legs. If it were not see through I would have ordered this in every color."
3.0,"This would be a very cute dress, but the craftsmanship is very bad. The seams in the back are not even and since it's right on your butt it's very noticeable. The threads were frayed throughout the garment as well. I debated on just trimming them and keeping the dress, because it would be really cute, but since it is a wrap dress held together by buttons, I didn't trust that the loops for the buttons would  hold."
3.0,"Dress was nice however, the 4XL is a US size 18 not a 12-14 as indicated. Ended up returning and reordering a 2XL to get a size 14."
3.0,good quality but the inseam is too short for my grandson I bought them for. I suggest sizing up.
3.0,This dress is absolutely beautiful but it is definitely too small  I wish it would've fit me because I wanted to wear it to change into on my wedding day.  Now I have to return it.
3.0,"I purchased this for a friend who is slightly visually and cognitively impaired from a minor stroke; she can never keep track of the date and has difficulty reading a clock and needed something by her bed that she could touch that would announce the date and time and have an alarm function if needed. This is way too difficult for her to manage.  In order to receive the atomic clock signal, you must position the &#34;watch&#34; face down on a flat surface near a window to receive the signal at 3:00 a.m., at least 6 feet away from household electrical and not let the metal clasp touch the case back as those things could interfere with the signal.  And if the signal is interfered with and the clock did not update, there are several steps you can take, such as trying every window in the house to see the reception is better; make sure the watch is not near a computer monitor or TV or maybe the area is too built up to receive the signal, etc., etc. and then if you need to manually update it, there are several steps to take to accomplish that and to set the alarm, there 5 steps, starting with one long press, followed by one by one, ... it's just too complicated.  I did include a replacement battery, which is very nice and above and beyond competitors."
3.0,"I loved this dress but it wasn't even, I pinned up a side to make it look more symmetrical"
3.0,"The color is beautiful as expected but the fit is not. Ran too small and it is very light weight. This is a spring/ fall jacket not a winter coat, at least not for a Minnesota winter."
3.0,"not really what i thought it was, it was smaller then expected and it didn’t really connect when i tried to put it in. the product is good just didn’t come up to my expectations."
3.0,don't really like Brazil
3.0,"Smaller than I expected, short and tight."
3.0,"You get what you pay for — workout gear is no different. If you’re wanting a decent, cheaply priced top, this is for you. I didn’t love it because it is rather thin and clung to my body a bit. I bought an XL because I like my tops more loose for the gym and I’m a size medium or 4/6 in things and I still didn’t feel comfortable in it. This is good if you’re just starting out and don’t want to pay a lot for workout stuff, but only get 1 or 2 because it’s not the best quality. Size up one or two if you like it loose, or normal size if you want it fitted."
3.0,Love the graphics. But the graphics / embellishments make the shirt stiff and thick. Might work ok for a tall and thin torso.
3.0,I really like this skirt a lot. Really pretty. The only problem is it's about 4 inches too long.  It drags the ground by that much. I have to roll up the waist a bunch of times.
3.0,"The rignt sizing is larger than what one would expect. I wish it was still offered, so I could order a size smaller."
3.0,weight lifter here 6.1 feet big chest size large isn't good size
3.0,Super cute however almost no air goes thru making it almost impossible to breathe!
3.0,Mirror finish fell off with in a few months
3.0,i should of bought a larger one
3.0,LIKE IT JUST A LITTLE SMALL
3.0,Again I failed to inspect this product thoroughly enough because it is fastened on by a pin and I was wanting magnetic only.  But I wouldn't trade this flag for anything.  I love the design and it makes me feel proud
3.0,"I am an adult with small feet. I bought the children's size 1. The shaft goes up to my knee, which is nice because most children's boots stop mid-calf on me. Like most children's shoes, there is not much support and there is room to move your toes. I didn't rate it with more than 3 stars because the faux leather is very faux-looking and the toe is super round and childish-looking. It is also wide around the ankle. Despite my complaints, I did get a couple complements on them when I wore them.<br />If you are buying for a child, be aware that these are much taller than normal boots by about 3 inches. They are very true to size. I usually wear a 1 and these were a perfect fit at size one. The faux leather is inexpensive looking. I am not sure how it would hold up to running and playing outside."
3.0,"Purchased because like most people who are buying reading glasses in quantity the need to have them in various locations around the house is getting more pronounced. And these are fine as far as they go, but, because they are  pretty cheap they have a bunch of distortion to the edges of the lens--but otherwise they're fine and I surely won't care if a lose a few of them."
3.0,"The skirt is big, it's a lot of fabric and it makes it really full. If that's what your looking for, then it's fine but it was too big for what I was looking for."
3.0,The earring is too heavy and leans forward
3.0,Color isn't even close to what's pictured. Kept because I had to pay return shipping.
3.0,"not as comfortable as I thought it would be, in fact it's a little scratchy and its hard to tell which side i the front since there's no tag, but if you're very thin it shouldn't be a problem. (it's also very short on my and I'm 5'1)"
3.0,"The gems were not very large and very lightweight, I thought they were man made or possibly plastic until I contacted the seller and he explained to me that opals from India normally come this light and they were official gemstones."
3.0,It’s cute but the shorts are thin and see-through so they have to be used as a cover up not as alternate bottoms. The bottoms are tight at the edges where the seams are so if you are softer like myself it will give you muffin top. Top is okay and prob the best part of the set.
3.0,Tiny bit small but manageable. Was delivered late. Box and therefore hat arrived crushed. Was able to prop it back but still not smooth along the brim. Also loose threads keep popping up. Would expect that from a hat in the $15 to $25 range but not so much in a $35 hat.
3.0,The front part sort of hangs a bit. The material is nice but I have to wear a tank top underneath it. The length is not too long. I have to wear slip too most likely. Not bad for the price.
3.0,I bought this top to wear with leggings but it is definitely not long enough as implied by the tunic length.  It fits like a regular blouse.  It runs slightly small.  I'm almost always a Medium but this was too tight in the bust and certain to shrink some upon washing.  Had to return it.
3.0,I loved the soft material but they're way too small. I'm 5' 4&#34; and 200 lbs. The XXL fit me like a sausage casing. Had to return them.
3.0,"I bought this item to hang box keys from my work trailer, thinking that by saying NEON in its description, I would find them in the dark or wherever they fell and it is not, the product description is not adjusted to what I received.  This reflects absolutely nothing."
3.0,"Make sure you get a LARGER one, I could not get  the medium one even to clasp......"
3.0,"Just okay, not really clear vision with these."
3.0,Really thin fabric...
3.0,Weird fit in the torso. Kinda shapeless like a sack. Need to use a waist belt.
3.0,Longer than expected. On model lands above knees. On me it lands at the knee with the sleeves hanging below my finger tips. Small around waist on me and gaps at bottom of coat. I'm 5'2 -170lbs.
3.0,I am 5'7&#34; and 127 lbs.  The bottoms were tight at the waist.  The top fit well through bust but came up above my collar bone and found it uncomfortable.  It's a very flattering suit design just didn't work for me.
3.0,Runs small.  Nice fabric.
3.0,Very thin. Cute but probably won’t wear it
3.0,Good for range work.
3.0,"I ordered this jacket size XL in the color gray. The jacket fits me a little big, which is exactly how I wanted it to. The color of jacket I received is not the heather gray look as shown in the picture. It was an unheathered light blue. The light blue was a nice color, so I decided not to return it. Just be aware that you might get a nice blue jacket, instead of the gray you were thinking you were going to get."
3.0,Very tiny chain (as expected).
3.0,Suit appears to be good quality but very small busted. I bought an XL based on size chart. Bra cups were approximately size B.
3.0,Look cute and don’t bother my daughters swnsitice skin. However the backs fall off very easily. Like they are made for a larger gauge ear ring.
3.0,They came in early! I'm daughter loves them
3.0,"Much bigger than expected... They should post some preview pictures that more accurately convey it's immense size (in beginning a little trouble fitting into pocket, but I've gotten used to it). Other than that, pretty good product. Leather feels nice, chain helps not get lost (which was why I bought this new wallet). Nice zipper compartment for loose change. Plenty of slots for cards however... even with nothing in it, it's not very slim at all..."
3.0,Silver coating is rubbing off.
3.0,"Welp, I got my beautiful kaftan, but it was HUGE!  I am 5/8"" and wear a 14-16 depending on the brand and fit.  This cover up could have fit two of me!  It didn't look bad from the side, but you could not find me from the front of it.  So if you like very loose, flowy, this could work for you! The material is lovely, lightweight, crepe, and would work for hot climates."
3.0,"Pierde el color muy rápido, es lo único que no me gusto."
3.0,"I liked these gloves right off the bat. They fit well and look and feel great.<br /><br />They also have that wonderful leather smell, which is to be expected of course, but you'd be surprised how many companies pass off faux leather as real. The lining appears to be faux fur, which I prefer over real, though I'm only guessing.<br /><br />These gloves are not for the cold months if you live in the north as I do, but are great for the shoulder months when the temperatures are at or above freezing.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Attractive, elegant.<br />Comfortable.<br />Real supple leather.<br />Good fit (YMMV, of course).<br /><br />Cons:<br />No clasp, elastic or cinch at the wrist to tighten to keep out wind.<br />There are marks on both the gloves I received. They're fairly subtle, but I'd prefer they weren't there. See the first two pictures attached.<br />There are no tags or identifying information anywhere on the product or in the package. On the inside wrist of the left glove a tag has been removed. Very weird. Makes me somewhat uncomfortable. What's being hidden?<br />From the broken English of the description it sure seems like the seller isn't domestic. I doubt very much the product is.<br /><br />Overall I would I would give a qualified recommendation for these gloves. They're very nice, but arrived with some visible markings that I was unable to remove with leather cleaner. I did receive a discount on these gloves for my unbiased and honest review, which you are now reading. The product price states free returns, so this is low risk purchase, in my opinion."
3.0,Runs VERY short!
3.0,Cute shirt and I really liked it. Unfortunately I will be sending it back because it runs small and it's way too long. If it fit a little better it could be worn as a dress. Really disappointed.
3.0,I thought the glasses would be bigger .
3.0,"they are ok, look good, but very flimsy material which feels like they will break soon..."
3.0,Simple and it works....
3.0,"I bought this bag not expecting much due to the low price, but the seller did confirm that it was genuine suede. It is indeed suede, but don't expect thick luscious leather for $36.00.  The yellow color is as shown, and it's beautiful for spring/summer, although I have not used it yet and don't know if it's colorfast. I like the design of how the strap attaches, but the strap itself is not leather. The bag is lined, but there is only one inside pocket, and it has just a tabbed snap closure at the top, so it'snot completely secure. I think this bag will do well for the beach or the farmer's market, where a big slouchy open bag is useful. Especially for the price, it looks good. It also delivered much sooner than predicted."
3.0,"Product looks exactly the same as pictured, and fit is great, but I can tell they’ll only last me a season. That’s typically what I get out of moccasins anyways, but these ones wear down quickly on the plastic sole as well as the fabric. In addition, the material in the front was ripped and faded in only a couple weeks. On the other hand, after several months of wear through different types of weather, the fur still looks new and they’re still comfy. Probably wouldn’t buy again, due to the quick wear down of the exterior fabric."
3.0,Very cute but didn’t fit. I ordered the largest size. My torso was just too long. Bummer
3.0,Too tight across chest. Returned.
3.0,The peral ones look cheap. Love the studs so far
3.0,When working out they tend to slide down. Not my favorite. Will be used as leggings.
3.0,"These stay on great, but the gold seems to be fading already..."
3.0,Larger than I expected and not as black Perl.
3.0,I'm a size 14/15 got the navy in 2x and fit good. Got the black next which came from China. Well it ran really small and when I washed it before wearing them it tore.
3.0,"Really cute necklace, my daughter was thrilled to get it however after just a few days the chain broke. Thankfully we didn't loose the BTS ring part and can put it on another chain. Overall still fairly please with the purchase, it was inexpensive so you get what you pay for just wish the chain was had been a little better quality."
3.0,"Didn't cost much, but it is too big to wear like a necklace.  Plan to use it for a key fob."
3.0,"These were fine for the Roaring 20's Party I bought them for.  But the fabric is weak and they stretched out rather quickly.  I doubt I will be able to get a second use out of them with out taking in the seams.  However, if you just need them to make an entrance or for a photo prop, they do the job nicely."
3.0,"Very disappointing. The material had a flannel pajama feel.<br />The return is also difficult. A refund won't be issued until the company receives the item. I dropped it off at Whole Foods almost 2 weeks ago, and the company hasn't processed the refund yet.<br />I'm suspicious 🤔"
3.0,The fit is great but the color is a little off. Not really brown....more of a maroon color!
3.0,"The dress fits as expected, however, I didn't particularly like the material, too silky."
3.0,Not a LARGE brimmed hat. Its average brimmed.
3.0,Took a month to get it but like it
3.0,Since I'm not using it alone but in my purse it works.  I bought it because of the RFID and there are ample pockets for my cards.  My problem with the item is that the wrist handle attaches to the zipper and you run the risk of opening it and losing everything if you were to use the wrist handle without paying very close attention to how you're holding it.
3.0,"Cute, but the jeans look is a bit cheesy, just printed on."
3.0,"These are very well built.  They hold the glasses extremely tight.  If you are a runner, a climber or other physical moving operation they are great.  They keep your glasses in place.  I was looking for every day use."
3.0,"The grip buckle is designed to use the friction between the very heavy fabric belt, and the buckle when it is pulled in snug to your body.  I'm a bigger guy with a gut, so that may be a gap in the engineering of the product.<br /><br />For about a week it was fine.  After that, the fabric started folding, and the buckle slipped enough that I went back to the traditional buckle.  It may be a little less comfortable than the Grip6, but it stayed in place."
3.0,"I got a large thinking it was gong to fit small, but i should have ordered a med, im small up top!"
3.0,Cute but much bigger than expected. Don't think I'll wear.
3.0,Nice pic to be Big
3.0,The hands are a little tight but length and style is good is good
3.0,Very pretty but rubbed the back of her heel.
3.0,Collets lint.  Tough to keep clean.  Does what its supposed to do -- better than a simple rag / old t-shirt
3.0,Fairly accurate on time.. Security clasp pin fell out of the band making the watch un wearable until buying an entire set of friction pins.. I noticed this is a common problem from the reviews. Have not yet got the watch wet.. Also noticed that is a problem. Make sure the crown is scrued down hand tight. Otherwise 5/5.. Nice looking watch. Smooth movement. I've gotten multiple complements..
3.0,"Better than expected for the price.<br />Very, very slow delivery."
3.0,Need softness
3.0,"I was excited about the suit when I got it, but it was definitely too small for me and was not flattering on someone like me who has small boobs and a bigger belly."
3.0,Very soft and high quality but bad fit. This is too small and the next size up is crazy huge and way too long. Too bad as I really wanted these Pjs for my LO for winter. Will be sending back.
3.0,"A little tighter than I like, but, that's my issue.  Need to get lose weight!"
3.0,"I know coins can discolor (because many times they are made from base metal) , but was pretty surprised when I got these that they arrived all black and discolored. Hopefully they will polish up with a silver cloth, otherwise they will be returned as they are NOT attractive all discolored."
3.0,The strap changes length on its own due to the smooth texture.
3.0,"Smaller than I had hoped, but very stretchy."
3.0,"The positives: I liked the reinforced stitching of the handles.  The webbing near the top of the bag is decorative and helps to secure the handles.  I like the idea of the padded shoulder strap.  I also liked the gray colored webbing as it would distinguish it readily from all the clear bags with black webbing.  The materials seem to be reasonably durable and flexible.  Neutral observations: I wish the inside ""pocket"" had a zipper, flap or closure of some sort to keep the contents contained.  I wish the bottle holder were outside rather than inside the bag.  The negatives: The webbing at the bottom of the bag was not well sewn (lumpy and uneven) and the edges were left unfinished rather than folded over or bound in some manner to prevent fraying.  Regretfully, this flaw is on the bottom of the bag where it will have maximum contact with what ever surface the bag rests upon.  This is clearly a weak point as there is already some fraying of the webbing without even using the bag.  Regretfully, I noticed this a few days after the time window for exchanges/returns had closed.  There were also lots of loose threads, which created the impression of a well designed, but poorly executed product.  I would have sought a return or exchange for a better constructed item.  I did not see an alternate method to reach out to the manufacturer/ seller so I have posted this review here."
3.0,"Fairly good umbrella. It is light and dries really quickly. Does great blocking the sun and protecting from rain. Material a bit thin and if the wind blows strong enough it will flip up, but other than that it isn't a bad umbrella at all."
3.0,"Kind of awkward fit - the waist line falls a little lower/looser than I’d like, but it’s still wearable (I’ve been wearing it with a belt and it’s super cute) and for the price I can’t complain too much. Other than waist fit is normal & as expected."
3.0,"way too long for my liking, wish it had better sizing charts!"
3.0,There are ok. The back strung that goes around your heel area does get uncomfortable if worn all day.
3.0,"Material is stretchy, but feels like a cheap t-shirt.  Sizing is as expected.  Actually looks okay, just not as dressy as the photos present.  Better for a house-dress than going out dress. Does not ""swing"", it hangs."
3.0,Really short..super cute but too short
3.0,"The glitter stayed on way better than I was expecting!  I get a lot of compliments on these shoes every time I wear them!  My only issue is that they fell apart on the sides- the sole detached from the side.  I will be ordering another pair in black, but now I know to just wear them for work or school when I am sitting and not doing a whole lot because the first pair I got have not been very durable."
3.0,"The adjustment on the loops is nice and I love the designs, but there is a lot of fabric on the inside of the mask that makes these quite uncomfortable when the seam rubs against your mouth and nose. Ironing the inside might help but to do that each time it’s washed is not practical."
3.0,Item looks way better online that it does once delivered... Tends to look a bit cheap
3.0,"The colors, but some I will not wear."
3.0,"It’s not cotton, but looks ok."
3.0,The person modeling these must be under 5’10”. They are barely below the knee on me
3.0,These are very tight fitting and short. Would not recommend if you are looking for something that is loose fitting or flattering.
3.0,"These are not nonslip (the bottoms are the same shiny material as the rest of the shoes). Super cute, though."
3.0,See through and needs layering.
3.0,broke pretty quick.
3.0,The material is very thin doesn't really look like the picture not a true fit the waistband doesn't stay in place.
3.0,Fit me pretty good and comfortable. A lot of suction.<br />UPDATE: after using them for a bit I notice there is quite a bit of distortion underwater. I can't see well at all. It's like looking through a kaleidoscope.
3.0,"The socks feel great, but after one wearing, and not even washed yet, I see small single threads coming unraveled."
3.0,The only thing is I wished the heart was a little bet smaller
3.0,"They were good shorts but had to send them back because they were too big! Ordered size 34, tend to get 34 stretch or 36 slim, 34 felt like a 36 and were so loose that even with a belt they looked like they were dangling. Wish I'd gotten a 32! Otherwise liked them"
3.0,These fit my plastic frame glasses and the polarization is very good. Here’s my complaint: I bought these to replace the same product that I bought last summer but lost. The last summer version was perfect - 5 stars. I could put them on and remove them with one hand yet they were firmly affixed to my glasses. (I lost them when I took them off and put them...somewhere). These that I just got look the same but the clamps that hold them onto my glasses are really tight - to use them I have to remove my glasses then wedge them onto my glasses and straighten them and line them up with the lenses. I’m going to keep them because they are the right size for my glasses lenses and that was hard to find. But oh do I wish they were just like the ones I lost...
3.0,"The dress is a good basic piece. The stitching tension is not perfect; it bunches at the hemline. The garment arrived very wrinkled and I find it impossible to press the wrinkles out completely. That said, I will keep the dress as it fits well & is reasonably priced."
3.0,"This is a cute purse but not exactly what I was expecting. It makes a lot of crinkly noise, the black is brown for the zippers and lining, and overall I'm a little bummed. It's good quality though!"
3.0,Qulaity is fine but don't worth to buy with this price.
3.0,Material is thin & see through
3.0,"Very nice dress, but somewhat small. I ordered my usual size, but it was a touch snug."
3.0,"Very cute!  Love the print. Just doesn’t fit my particular wrist well. Either it’s too loose or too tight. Other than that, it’s a great band!"
3.0,"I really like them but the heart is really REALLY small, you can barely tell is red or a heart. I really wanted them for the color and style but I am a little disappointed."
3.0,"Would be great but the inseam is a little odd and the fabric is rather weak and thin.<br /><br />I’m 5’4, 165lbs and the waist was a little tight and bunchy ."
3.0,This dress was great for a one time wear but started to fall apart in the bust area halfway through the evening and i don't have a large bust size.... wouldnt' recommend if yoiu're planning to get lots of wear out of it but it looked awesome for the one night.
3.0,"I like the dress and can squeeze my chest into it, but shouldn’t have to. When you order an extra large, you don’t expect it to fit your chest like a medium. Not sized well up top."
3.0,"I wore it for one shopping trip in one store. It did make it easier to breathe, however the moisture in my mask from regular breathing collected on the insert and the condensation settled to the bottom of the insert that rests on the chin. It was like having drool on my chin by the time I was done at the store. I wish the structure of the insert allowed it to rest only on the sides of the mouth and not on the chin."
3.0,They keep your legs warm. They are cute.
3.0,"The fabric appears cheap at first, but paired with a real silk blouse and Chanel sandals, it actually turns out to look expensive. I’m 5’3” 110lbs very athletic, and the Small was too big on me. Minus stars for having to pay to get it tailored."
3.0,It was a gift. She seems to like it. That's all that matters.
3.0,Not enough room for boobs. It would have fit better if they would have remembered that boobs have to go in here too. The rest fit fine. This would be great for women with A/B cups.
3.0,"Stuff belt, not what I expected but it is cute."
3.0,"My wife likes the ear rings but she almost lost one multiple times, the clasps are not very good and secure,,,then if you squeeze the clasp too much to tighten you can't close. Needs a better clasp"
3.0,I’m a black girl with a black girl booty! This did not do (for me) what the picture showed. I will keep them.
3.0,I would order a size up. But other then that it was great. I would most definitely order from them again.
3.0,"It isn't breathable fabric, you get hot fast wearing it, kinda reminds me of what material umbrellas are made out of . I absolutely love the design an ear adjusters!"
3.0,I liked the graphic but ended up giving this shirt away. It was too small.
3.0,"Looks and wears fantastic straight out of the packaging. Originally bought to wear on the 4th of July for fun, most everyone complimented it, however spending a full day wearing it both inside and out it was going to need to be cleaned, but there are no wash/care instructions sewn on the inside. I washed it in cold water on the delicate cycle and the backing of the patches seemed to have “melted” off after I took it out of a completed wash cycle…it was all over the inside of the washer drum. There was a small hole coming from a section of the seaming coming undone. Overall it’s still wearable for another time, and still looks good… but like I mentioned, it was worn for fun and I got my use out of it. If you’re  looking for a real hockey jersey, probably best to look at another site or eBay/Facebook market"
3.0,Loved the design. With they had a larger size. Giving it to my sister for Christmas
3.0,Loved this dress but am usually an 8/10 in dresses and bought the 10 and it was much too small. Great material & super cute though!
3.0,Too small than the photo
3.0,I like it don't get me wrong but the photo I was looking at was misleading I thought I was getting two beads and the string but when I opened the package there was only one bead
3.0,I gave this keychain a 3 out five simply because the small letters are hard to read. Overall quality is good but the line about daughter is very difficult to read. I paid extra to personalize the back and it looks fantastic.
3.0,The charm was great and thick but the chain is very thin and so easily breakable. Definitely will need to buy a separate chain.
3.0,"Bought these to use as boot liners, they fit more like ankle socks. I'm 5'5, feet size 9. They feel silky, like polyester. Cute prints but don't match my clothes and shoes very well."
3.0,"I have a regular sized head. Meaning I wear quite a few hats and never really have fit issues. These run a little small. I think they would be perfect for an older child...around 10-12. They are made well, but too small for an adult."
3.0,Creases came early on in wear.  After the second wear they looked over a year old!
3.0,"It's deff easier than the screw on balls. I feel like it was hard to push in and I almost broke the clear plastic part, it's a bit bent now. Also I have a pair of screw ons the same size and for some reason these were a bit smaller. I know this because it was to tight and my skin got irritated from it being to small of a fit. Order a size up than your normal size if you decide on these."
3.0,Began to wear out after a few months of wearing. The blue gen began to fog up and the ring is beginning to peel.
3.0,I wasn't pleased with the fabric. It was somewhat cheap looking.
3.0,I is a beautiful watch but the black finish is already coming off after wearing it one week.
3.0,"This outfit runs a little big. That's okay, she will still be able to wear it, and it's really cute. The shoes are very cheaply made however, and are really big."
3.0,"I tried these as a cheaper option to Puravida. My daughter and I each put a couple on at the same time and wore them all day, in the shower and to bed. Hers were fine and have continued to be fine the last week and a half. I ended up with a rash all around my ankle the first morning. I put them on the other ankle and made sure to take them off each night but a couple strings came out of one and the knot on one end of the other came out and I wasn’t rough with them. So overall, they’re a cheap option and there are plenty in the pack to choose from if one breaks but for me it felt like a waste of money. I just ordered some from Puravida that I know the extra cost will be worth."
3.0,"This has an issue with staying hooked, it falls off from time to time."
3.0,Seems good quality and value for money.
3.0,"minimalist yes.  water resistant NO.  walking in wet grass my feet are wet after a few minutes.  grip is mostly nonexistent.<br />slipped on wet concrete, wet grass and any mud.  nice try but this shoe is less than expected for the cost."
3.0,"I love the color but the material is really cheap, exactly what you pay for."
3.0,Cute style. Gets caught on my shirts as some edges are sharp
3.0,"Ordered based on the reviews, but the fabric is cheap and the sizing is way off (too small).  Just not impressed by the tanks"
3.0,This runs a little small.  It is also not 100% merino wool.  Thicker than expected.  not sure how it will wash yet.
3.0,"I wear a Women's 9.5 and while these fit, it's just barely. Also, on almost all of them, there are already holes in the toe area, and I've had them less than 2 months. Not high quality. They do stay in place, which is why I gave 3 stars instead of only 1"
3.0,"The fit is fine, I ordered a large. However, it’s true that it’s not as clingy/slim-fitting as the photo suggests. My problem with this shirt is the colors and pattern. In person it looks kind of tacky rather than stylish. Disappointed."
3.0,I gave this to my mom for Christmas. She has thin wrists so it fit. If you have thicker wrists it more than likely will be too small
3.0,"You definitely get what you paid for with this shirt. It’s not horrible, it’s actually pretty decent. But mine showed up with some strings lose and the little pocket on her chest definitely looks a little cheap, otherwise it’s a great shirt."
3.0,"It's alright. Wearable, but definitely not the greatest quality. The top is nowhere near how the product picture looks. Still a decent looking dress for summer."
3.0,They fit my kid well; maybe a tad small but can get on themself so that's good.  They aren't cushiony as you'd want from a house slipper.
3.0,"cute shirt, but euns small."
3.0,"The boots are very comfortable, but way too roomy above the arch. It feels like my feet are floating inside the shoe. The shoe may fit a large person well but for a skinny one,  not so much."
3.0,I wanted to love this dress but my bustline was too tight.  Sizing up would have made it too big. Sadly I have to send back.
3.0,"Beautiful color & sheen, but very tight elastic waist band for the size"
3.0,Solid design and make. Because of the small clasl it does make it difficult to latch and remove from my belt loop
3.0,Be careful...runs very small.  There are NO ADJUSTMENT STRAPS of any sort. Pictures show an adjustment in the back band area - not there.
3.0,cheaper than they look.
3.0,"The material was thinner than expected. If you are between sizes, I would size up. The logo is the material that will eventually rub off."
3.0,"Fit is a bit odd. Overall, decent shirt."
3.0,"Does not HEAT  nearly to extent as viewed, or advertised.  The only good I found is the look. I would strongly  NOT  recommend any Jacket or Vest .  Gloves - -YES  !"
3.0,The tags on this are very misleading.  a 2X is like a men's small.  Nice otherwise.
3.0,Nice color and surprisingly better quality item than I expected for the price.
3.0,Not shat I thought it was for
3.0,"My son was really excited to wear this costume for trick or treating. It looked great & lasted well during our trial run at his schools trunk or treat. However, tonight, after wearing it for maybe 45 minutes while trick or treating, we noticed the fan was no longer functioning properly and the costume was deflating. We checked to see if there were any obstructions blocking the airflow and found the battery pack to be hot. We took it off of him and he had to finish the night without a costume. It is a funny costume and looked great on him, but unfortunately it has only been worn for a total of 2 hours and seems to not be able to be worn again."
3.0,"Ordered for my 14 year old. She is a B cup, you will need a full D to fill the chest. The rest fit perfectly."
3.0,"It's beautiful, but to heavy. I can't use it. I didn't know I could return it. :("
3.0,Very pretty but broke after just a month
3.0,"I think it would be a cute dress if it were the correct size. I'm 5'3 and 150 lbs. I usually wear a large, but in this I ordered a medium. It's way too big. Had I gotten the small it would have looked a little better, but because of the size and my body shape it looked like a moo moo. Might just wear it as a swim suit cover or something."
3.0,Dress is nothing like the pic but still pretty cute. Shiny fabric.
3.0,The were ok hope to find better ones
3.0,"I didn't quite know how to rate this because I bought them for myself as the first ones I purchased were outstanding. These were way too wide for my head, but on the upside my son totally Loved them!"
3.0,Fast fashion doesn't last. I got about 20 wears out of this before the zipper failed. It's cheap but cute.
3.0,Nice claw but didn't like the fake pearl. I just put a different object in the claw.
3.0,"I love everything about this dress.....except for the fact that all of the leaves on the cherries are light blue and not green.  I ordered a size large.  I usually wear a US womens size large. Chest is a tiny but snug and I wish the lining was a bit longer, but overall,  a great nice for a really good price.  I bought the white and may come back for the blue."
3.0,The bottom looks like chiffon on the bottom but its actually Tulle...... was really upset at first but too late to change the dress. ive warmed up to it i guess. it works with boots.
3.0,Cute shirt but material is not as soft as I hoped.  Also it runs large so do not order up a size.
3.0,"Very thin, basic dress.  I have to wear a foundation garment underneath because it is so see through."
3.0,They are rather thin... And not tight around the abdomin but I like the over all texture of them and for 5$ and change they will work.
3.0,"Ok, so it took forever to arrive, not surprising with it coming from the other side of the planet, but I wonder how much more it would cost to ship it a little more quickly.<br /><br />Apart from that, two of the three glasses arrived clear. The third one, however, had some cloudiness on both lenses making them pretty much useless unless I wanted to deal with peering through the stuff. It couldn't be wiped off either.<br /><br />But as for them being compact, they certainly are and get the job done when you suddenly find yourself without your prescription glasses."
3.0,Would of been five star.  But the colors they randomly pick from is more a girl color.  Better for like my daughter.  So wasnt pleased there.
3.0,"I love everything about them but they are a little on the small size. to me it is like they are made as a size 10 foot exactly a shoe size, please consider making them a bit bigger to actual fit the foot comfortably with socks on too after all they are Chukka boots aren't they?"
3.0,"The design is nice but the colors are faded, not new looking."
3.0,The sole is rough
3.0,"Great gift for my daughter, didn't come with instructions is why I have it 3 stars."
3.0,"There comfortable joggers,great for working out in."
3.0,"They run small but I personally don't wear them too often. They do keep my feet cool in hot weather since the material is thin but if I sweat, the socks tend to slide and I have to readjust constantly."
3.0,"Is ok for what I need for my trip, to carry passport,  and cards. Very lightweight and true red color."
3.0,"Fit oddly in the sleeves, and fitted at the arm pit."
3.0,"Shows every HINT of mositure....let alone sweat. Love what it does for my butt but otherwise, I'm not sure how often I'll wear it from here on out..."
3.0,"When I first opened it to was marked as an extra large, but amazingly the acual fit was OK."
3.0,Glad fades to dark quickly
3.0,This needs to be ordered  way bigger so it hangs like the picture.
3.0,"Not a bad hat for the occasional use when you find yourself outside, but like most cotton it can retain wrinkles when unrolled (you need an iron to get the look in the images). For me this wouldn't be much of an issue, but for my wife it is important. The hat does pack away pretty compact, so it is good for the emergency sun cover, just not the garden party fully pressed look.<br /><br />The color is a dark blue, just short of what I consider navy blue. The sizing is adjustable with a draw string and the chin strap can be worn tight or loose. Overall, usable, but if wrinkles make you cringe, you might want something in a blend other than cotton. P-)"
3.0,"Fit was great and my daughter said these were very comfy and easy/quick to get on and off. True to size. However, the band that serves as the major “tying” component snapped after two months of normal wear. Very disappointing for a sneaker in this price range for a child."
3.0,I bought the set for my wife and daughter to make cookies in the hope I would get more cookies.  They worked I got my cookies slightly burnt on one side but hey they were cookies.  The aprons are light and a little on the value side not the best or thickest materials but they kept their valuable clothes clean and that means it does what it was supposed to do.
3.0,"It's comfortable and long enough to wear with leggings. The red is very faded, but for the price I didn't expect much. I also have the black and grey one and it doesn't look faded. I generally wear a medium, but the medium in this was a little snug. The large is a bit loose, but 'OK'."
3.0,"All in all, this is a nice replacement band, but it is rather thick in a way that probably works better for mens watches than women's watches.  The band is significantly thicker than my women's sports watch's original band, and the two retaining loops made the whole thing uncomfortably thick when I tried it on.  I also was disappointed that even though I carefully measured, the pins that came with this 14mm replacement band fit, but were not truly secure.  (My guess is that 1 more mm might have worked).  I ultimately was able to use this replacement band, my original watch's pins and my original retaining loop to come up with a comfortable solution.  Although this band's proportions weren't optimal for my smaller watch,  they may work just fine for someone with a larger watch."
3.0,The silver beads turn a copper color after a week and the strings unraveled where you pull to tighten it
3.0,"They are super cute, but are smaller then normal size 5. My LO usually wears a 4t, so I got the 5 knowing Disney runs alittle smaller. But these are snug. And since I've opened them and she tried it on I cant send them back now for a bigger size."
3.0,"Nice material, it's soft and really easy to wear and breathable. This does run really.. really short, even if you are petite. It's almost uncomfortable to wear it's so short and shows off too much of your skin. This is still really well made, just if it were slightly longer, it would be the right fit/look to wear."
3.0,Good quality for the money. Just was not all satisfied.
3.0,Shirt was thin and felt cheap and was somewhat small for a 3XL
3.0,These were adorable and looked great on my 2.5 year old but they got wet once and the lens separated. Like the tinting peeled off.
3.0,"Super cute, especially for the price.  Wish the fabric was a little nicer, but it's perfect for the beach."
3.0,No black trim and cheap... but works for a costume.
3.0,I did aqll the measurements.....still way too small.....my son liked them however so I gave them to him
3.0,"Ordered a size larger and they are too small. Do not stay on feet.<br />Really cute, just don't stay on."
3.0,I was excited to try it out but I should have bought one size smaller because I order large which I should order media am 31 waist and it has four levels to fasten the corset<br /> And one more issue it itch on the back<br />And it expands a letter after wear it for couple of day<br />So it start to lessen out
3.0,"OK, I love the look of these shoes, and they seem like they would be very comfortable if the straps fit.  I read a couple of reviews where people said one strap was too long, but one said she had been able to get it shortened. I thought I might be able to do the same if need be. But both straps are too long fo me, and I don't see how they could be fixed."
3.0,"This necklace was a gift to my 2nd mom- This necklace while beautiful, turned her colors due to mixed metal allergic reaction... Is not sterling silver or stainless steel. It is made of mixed metals."
3.0,These slippers run quite small. Seem well constructed except for the tail. These are glued on rather than knitted as part of the slipper. First tail came off within 2 hours and the other shortly thereafter.
3.0,"I have a lot of trouble getting these to turn pages on my Kindle Voyage. I often can't make the fingers or thumbs work, but they work intermittently. I haven't a way to make them work consistently. They work well for warming my hands indoors (Ihave Raynaud's so my hands chill easily). They are not very warm outside."
3.0,"My toddler loved these!!!  Everything was great except the sandal designs started peeling within the first week of use.<br /><br />Update: My mom peeled off the lettering on one of the sandals (about 1inch) since it was coming off anyway and it gave my toddler a blister under her big toe. The lettering seems to be like a sticker or something on the sandal, not painted/ stamped on. The other sandal seems fine; no issues."
3.0,The quality is okay. It does hold laundry though!
3.0,White glove as described but very thin material.
3.0,Way too small. Maybe able to fit a child. But other than that it's ok
3.0,The product that arrived was not the product shown in the listing.  Different brand and different appearance.  This was a concern because I was trying to match the non-working on exactly.  Luckily the mounting was the same and it worked okay.
3.0,"Bought one pair for my Daughter and one pair for myself for a black and white party. Both pairs were made very cheap. Way to big. Then I’ve been so busy, I went to Kohl’s to return them and missed the date by 2 days. Now I’m stuck with 2 pairs of crappy pants"
3.0,"I wanted to love these so badly. The price is great and the fit is fantastic, very flattering, but they roll up as soon as I start to pick up the pace on a run and with any HIIT type moves. If they stayed in place they would be perfect. Bummer."
3.0,"Great cheap glasses. The listing indicated non-polarized but mine came polarized, which can be an issue with tablets/phones. Otherwise great."
3.0,The material of the sweater is good. I got the purple sweater and it's really cute but a lot shorter thankless expected. I'm 5'5&#34; and it reaches just below my belly button. Would be cuter if wad longer and slouchier.
3.0,"It was a great watch, and came in a week early, but its only bee a month, and the batteries are dead, and u cant change them. I would like a refund."
3.0,NOT SQUAT PROOF but comfy for a pure cardio sesh. Love the pocket. Wish the entire pant was as thick. Keeping it cuz they're comfy af and I love the colors.
3.0,"Hard to say if it is the bands fault or that the surge was not intended for replacement bands. Band install had a deformity and did not tightly clasp onto the surge. Within a week, ended up just buying a new Fitbit."
3.0,"Okay...I'm 5'7, 240ish. This dress hit me right at the ankles. The material is thin and doesn't seem like it will hold up very long so wash delicately and probably don't put it in the dryer either! The thinness will probably be just fine for this southern heat. Overall, it was really cute worn with a denim jacket to the movies. I wouldn't wear it without something over it. I have a denim vest for outside events."
3.0,"This swimsuit just wasn't as cute as I expected. The black part came up too high, it made me look stumpy or something. Even the leg holes were cut high. I'm returning it. I gave it 3 stars because it feels like good quality, just isn't really my style."
3.0,2 sizes smaller than expected
3.0,Subdials keep track of milliseconds and seconds. Not minutes or hours. Pretty watch but not terribly useful.
3.0,"The wallet has a terrible smell.  I am hoping it goes away.  I'm not sure what it is, but even makes my hand smell after handling the wallet."
3.0,Fits true to size. Turtleneck is a bit higher and tighter than expected.
3.0,The dress is rose gold and not gold. It fits very nice.
3.0,This wrist band is too big
3.0,Seems more for a girl than a boy. Fits slightly larger. Difficult to learn. On a good note: their customer service is top notch!
3.0,It's a nicely made hat. However the color was a little more stone washed than I expected. I will keep it and try to work it with a different outfit then what I had in mind
3.0,"Super cute, but they are kind of heavy. They should have been given a hook rather than a post because the backing is just a rubber stopper and is not enough to hold the heavy earring in the ear. I will be using metal backings from other post earrings with these. Also, the ones I received are silver, not gold like the picture. I don't care so much about the metal color for these so it's fine, but if you have your heart set on gold know you may not receive that color."
3.0,"The jacket is cute however not the pants. The material is horrible for pants plus there are seams on pants where stripes are making them very awkward and uncomfortable, not at all leggings. Only wear jacket. Threw pants away."
3.0,"I gave this 3 stars because when it came, its a soft knit but wrinkled terrible.  I sent it back. It wouldn't look good if you sat in it long."
3.0,Order up a size or two! I ordered this for my petite Granny & ended up returning it twice for a bigger size. She loves it now that we got it to fit her.
3.0,"This is really a 3.5 star review. I had asked my husband to try out this MINILUJIA Bright at Night 50M Waterproof Creative Globe Map Men's Watch. He was a little hesitant at first because it came in such a modest looking plastic ziplock packaging. The watch quality was surprisingly decent though, especially for the current low Amazon price. The black case looks and feels nicely manufactured and the nylon NATO strap is sturdy. The strap buckle feels a bit flimsy though. The watch set easily and has been keeping time well. The second hands don't land squarely on the second markers, which is to be expected with low-cost quartz watches like this. The world map design on the dial is interesting and doesn't appear cheaply printed. The dark case color contrasts nicely with the military green-colored NATO. The overall aesthetic gives it a field watch look. Although the listing calls this ""Bright at Night,"" the glow-in-the-dark luminescence doesn't really last longer than a few minutes, and needs prolonged exposure to bright light to work well. All in all, my husband was pleased with this watch given its decent quality, overall appearance, and inexpensive cost."
3.0,Nice looking show but order the size you actually wear as these tend to run a little small.
3.0,For the price it is great. Hard to see the small pictures. The quality of the workmanship was obviously flawed. As the cord has a flaw. I would recommend it though.
3.0,Too small accross the chest
3.0,Seams are very uneven. Pretty dress but seamstress had a hard time trying to make bottom even
3.0,"I expected to love these boots, but they didn't fit me at all. First off, they run VERY small. I ordered up a size and they were still WAY to small. Secondly, if you have a high arch, you'll never be able to get them on (and if you do they'll be really uncomfortable). If they had a zipper or a pull tab on the back MAYBE they would have worked. Unfortunately they have neither. Back they go. Thanks Amazon for the free returns!<br /><br />Other than the fit issue which is obviously a deal breaker for me personally, they are nice looking boots at a great price. Hence the 3 stars. I received them at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review."
3.0,"These cling to my scrubs so I don’t wear them. They fit ok, though."
3.0,Not perfect fit for someone who has long waist.
3.0,"I ordered the XXL (which is supposed to be a 37” waist. It’s not), and it was way small. It fits more like a large. There’s no stretch to the material at all. The only reason I’m giving this three stars is that the construction of the skirt is nice, it’s good quality, and made of nice material. Just make sure if you order, you order a couple sizes up."
3.0,I love the bathing suit and find it super cute however the bottom isn't sized too good. Surprisingly the top fits my<br />Chest really well since I have really big boobs and it's hard to find tops that fit and the bottom is cute but I wish it came up a lot higher than hip length on me which is prob personal preference but I think I should've ordered maybe 1-2 sizes bigger
3.0,"The watch was a little big for my taste, and i'm a 6'3 guy with no small wrist. The bezel doesn't move either and so it looks a kinda girly. If the bezel wasn't so star shaped and actually rotated I might have kept it. Honestly though, the watch face is cluttered so it's difficult to read at times. I know others complained about the wristband but I thought it was pretty good. Overall, its big, bezel doesn't rotate, and the face is cluttered."
3.0,"They quilts is not that good, they don’t stay even on when you have them on. Disappointed!"
3.0,"has an odd smell to it, im guessing from the graphic. It was tighter than i expected around the arms and shoulder area and I DID size up.<br />If you are going to buy this size up a few sizes."
3.0,"Good value for the price.  The fabric is a little too “polyestery” for me, but again good value.  Can’t expect super high quality fabric at this price."
3.0,"I really wanted to like these. I bought them because I was trying something different. The fit is good, they aren't tight but aren't loose in weird places either. Sadly after only a couple of months all 6 pairs had ripped or developed a hole somewhere. I'm not hard on my underwear, I still have some that I wear from several years ago. There is no reason these should have fallen apart so quickly. My search for the prefect underwear continues."
3.0,Good jacket just sent wrong size
3.0,They are really cute but they nose piece was fell within the first week. I hadn't even when them. While cleaning then the lens popped out. Usually I can pop lenses back in but not with these.
3.0,"This dress is quite unique, but the quality is not what expected.  The skirt is sewn off center, glue was left on the roses, and the visible seams (upper edging of split) are sewn- very noticeably- crooked.  There should be more fabric between the very stiff, scratchy, tulle and child's legs.  I'm hoping the replacement I receive is of better quality."
3.0,The material was not like cotton flannel.  It feels very stiff and somewhat uncomfortable. The item is made in China and may account for lower quality cotton.  Not a bad looking shirt but I want my flannel to feel like flannel and very comfortable.
3.0,Way smaller than expected. I think they used a child’s blazer to model this pin on. My husband loved it though.
3.0,"The panty line is a bit to wide, and slightly uncomfortable. At 43, I'm an average build, not over weight nor super skinny, and I have never have encountered this problem, when buying underwear. Buying a different size wouldn't help, as they do fit everywhere else perfect and are actually comfortable, aside from the panty line. I didn't return them, as I now just use them for when I'm on my period."
3.0,"These shoes are very cute, but EXTREMELY narrow, and I have narrow feet. I orders a size or two up to make sure my toes wouldn’t be falling off, and it’s still a close thing."
3.0,"Chain was nice and as advertised, Tks"
3.0,"Fun colors, wash nicely. Not sure how functional/helpful they are as they are very thin."
3.0,The top was way too tight in the arms. The material was not as stretchy as I hoped it would be. I would probably have to order a L next time but the fit was just too tight.
3.0,"This shoe fits  high on the ankle. My girl got a blister on her  inner-ankle from the stiff fabric<br />also it was difficult to adjust the strap. It's too wide between the holes and difficult to make new ones, difficult to secure the strap as well<br />They are pretty, but I wish I had spent the money on a better brand"
3.0,"The color pink is as pictured. The size runs a bit large, so it’s not form fitting. This is good and bad. The top feels good while running for instance because it’s loose, but doesn’t look flattering because of the loose fit and the pocket in front. The pocket is in the front, over the stomach when wearing and is very large. Nice to be able to put both hands in the same pocket to keep warm if cold, but, again not the most flattering look."
3.0,"The red was a size bigger than the other two. All three were HUGE. The material was thin. I ordered XL like the chart suggested (I usually wear a M) and these did not fit at all. I could reorder a smaller size, but I didn't like the feel of the thin material. It felt hot against my skin. Even in a smaller size I don't think this would count as &#34;compression&#34;."
3.0,"This dress (in yellow) is soooo cute.  The fabric is flattering, cool, and in style. I wanted to love it but it was a bit too tight around the waist  Returned an purchased the tan romper in same fabric."
3.0,My upper arm measured at 14&#34;  I ordered XL. Product is so tight on the upper arm the material rolls when I bend my arm. I'll keep them just in case other family members might need them.
3.0,I bought this for my nephew. The design is awesome but I was dissatisfied with the actual design printing. It looks a little blurry which to me makes it look very cheap.  The material of the sweater was fine but I was not happy about paying  $32 in total for a blurry print.
3.0,"Cute,<br />But not worth the money!<br />Only able to carry small wallet & cell phone."
3.0,Adorable design but doesn’t fit properly. Is way smaller than a typical 12 .
3.0,Too thin to wear without slip. Bust too large for me. Will donate.
3.0,I do not like the sweater & wish to return it. Please advise. I don't like the color & I thought it would be longer
3.0,Runs a bit large but otherwise a good product
3.0,"They're alright if you just want to wear them a few times. They're cute, they fit between my 2nd and 3rd knuckles. I think you get about 7 of them in a pack. Very light and flimsy. I ended up losing most of mine. You get what you pay for."
3.0,"The tshirt is comfortable, but the design decal on the front is shiny and looks cheaply placed."
3.0,"Love the bottles, hate the sprayers.  The bottles are nice and heavy and the color is gorgeous!  The sprayers are a good size and feel comfortable when you are using them.  The sprayers I received all work great if you have them set to the ""stream"" setting, but on the ""spray"" setting, they all leak from the nozzle.  A LOT.  So, I will keep the bottle and look for new sprayers to put on them."
3.0,"First The Good:  Comfort - 10 / 10  Easy To Install - 10 / 10<br />The band is extremely comfortable.  I have sensitive skin and any kind of watch band that has a snapping feature just wrecks my wrist.  The fact that this one does not have a clasp which sits against your skin is a life saver.  I give it a 10/10 on the comfort level.<br /><br />Installation of the band is extremely easy.  You just slide and hold the locking mechanism and insert the band into the watch and release the locking mechanism and it is in there.<br /><br />Now The Bad:  Durability - 1 / 10<br /><br />I have just ordered my second one.  The first one I received in November of last year.  Within a couple days, one of the sides just came out.  I did not hit it or anything.  Over the year, I have had the watch fall off a large number of times.  One day it fell off when I was casting a net into the water.  I thought I had lost the watch, but it fortunately hit the side of the boat and fell into the boat.  After that, I just removed my watch before doing any activities at all which I would be moving my arms in a quick motion.  It has not quite been year, but now I can't even get the band to stay on so I am waiting for the new one to get here before attempting to wear my watch again."
3.0,"we bought these to throw into a werewolf themed party favor bag. they are really cute and added that edgy fun vibe we wanted, but, when we modeled them for a group picture, we all got scrapes and cuts on the insides of our mouths. probably better for younger people and not for us grown-ups. they were very cute and I'd probably buy them again, but, I guess next time I'll just take the picture and not be in it when people try on these fangs!"
3.0,"The suit is cute but not purple (to me). It also had too much material around the stomach area, just looked like bunched up material and not enough support for my girls."
3.0,the pockets were not comfortable
3.0,I am trying to figure out if this sweater is retro and cool or just butt ugly. Extremely boxy. I sized up to a Medium and that was a mistake. Very large and very wide. I ordered the brown print. Fabric OK. This is a gift and I am worried about it
3.0,Super cute but way to large on me.  I bought a medium and fit me like an extra large.
3.0,Very cute style for both softball and baseball moms. The shirt itself is extremely soft and comfortable. I selected a small after reading reviews that said the shirt ran big. My normal size is medium. The small fit PERFECTLY! Very relaxed fit that won't be overly hot during summer games. The only issue I do have us the small black dots in the letters that look like mildew. That is a huge dislike but otherwise good option.
3.0,"The fabric was a thick cotton with crosshashed texture. I never wore it, but my sister loves it!"
3.0,"Good quality and nice looking product for the price, but fits way to small."
3.0,"These hats are super cute however the fit of them are not so great. I love that they come in two different styles and colors. The chin strap is convenient and helps to secure the hat. However the hats are floppy with a poor fit, causing me to have to readjust them often. If not for the faulty design these would have received a higher score."
3.0,La trompa es un poco pequeña
3.0,"Cute and true to description. I was unaware that they were being shipped from Korea, which took a few weeks. The packaging was nice, but I would prefer to buy within the United States - to support our economy and because you can't track the package with international shipping. I guess this explains the high shipping cost. Unfortunately, they are a bit overly priced overall, but they're cute and I didn't find a comparable item, so I decided to purchase them."
3.0,"The earrings that all the bloggers are wearing! Beautiful and does not look cheap what so ever, very good quality. BUT be aware these are very heavy and makes my ears a little itchy after wearing for a while. If you already have ripped lobes, don’t like heavy earrings or are sensitive, I suggest finding a different pair."
3.0,If you have no hips as the model<br /><br />Unless you are very slim like the model this is not a flattering look.  The panels tend to flare out and emphasize the thighs.  I returned it.  I usually wear a size 10 and ordered a L.....it was snug.
3.0,The noses took 3-4 days to fully puff up because they are vacuum sealed for shipping and even after they were full puffed up they don’t stay on well.  If its just a gag gift or for quick silly pictures it would be okay.  My daughter was frustrated that it kept falling off.
3.0,The inner material is very itchy. Can’t wear it.
3.0,nothing like it was in picture...will wear them  but not happy with look and nothing on packagin said Hand blown or Murano Glass...
3.0,"kind of cumbersome to put on. you will need help if you want to wear a pair on both wrists, like i selected. the little rose is fabric. the tear drop on the bottom kinda sat funny on one of the two i bought."
3.0,Wings poke the back of my head. Not a bad product though!
3.0,The clasp bends easily and the chain broke rather quickly.  Also the chain was much smaller than expected.  The pendent is beautiful and amazing especially for the price.
3.0,It was an awesome red that went with the theme for pictures I wanted. It looked nice on me and I was comfortable in it all day! Will buy from this company again!
3.0,"I ordered this bra because of how the underwire is covered it looked more comfortable. I hate strapless bras. In the description, it mentions removable straps but mine didnt come with any. Also the brand tag wasnt attached to the bra, it was just in the plastic bag with it... no big deal but fishy. The bra came with an extender tab, which I needed for it to fit. The lift was unlike any strapless Ive ever tried on, I LOVE that part. But the cups arent flush to your body. Theres so much gaping uptop that I'd be afraid to wear with anything thats not tight enough to hold the bra down! Maybe go down a cup size? I've worn D or DD for a decade, I ordered a 40D. Band tight, cups too big. Returning."
3.0,Pretty but not for very busty girls at all.
3.0,This is very nice and looks really really great but you get what you pay for. it feels like it will break easily but my girls loves.<br />Its worth the purchase if you looking something cheap. it matched a pair of earrings I got and the gift looks great
3.0,Some of the small beads had cracks upon receipt but otherwise very nice set.
3.0,like shoe
3.0,It was too big and the way it fit was not what I expected.
3.0,"Dress is as shown with ruching on the sides, not cute imo. Material is the cheap costume like material."
3.0,"I paid extra money to get them to customize this suit for me since I'm a rather large dude.  The design could use some changes.  The panda head's eyes are literally your eyes.  They're spread too far apart to be able to see out of both at once.  Makes walking awkward with the head on. The zipper in the back makes going to the bathroom rather difficult, forcing someone to unzip/zip you back up before and after.  The paws are attached to the sleeve of the unit and they're 4 digits.<br /><br />A crotch zipper might be a good idea, maybe not though.  Make the nose a see through black mesh so that you can see out one big hole in the head as opposed to two big ones, on either side of your head.  Make the paws more puffy and separate from the suit like the feet. I guess with this style of panda bear, it's not quite cartoonish or anthropomorphic so maybe a puffy realistic panda paw/mitt."
3.0,Ordered it in a large for my sister and it probably wouldn't have fit me in length and I am much shorter!! There is no way this could be a large.  It fit in length and body like a small.  Order up!!
3.0,"A tad small, but good enough as a shower shoe.  They also dry off quick!"
3.0,This dress runs big.
3.0,Low sides and short heal wrap.  Good buy for $5.00.
3.0,"Overall good, however they do not have a filter pocket as shown in their pictures. I bought the filters but have no place to put them."
3.0,Really large earrings... not what I expected.
3.0,"The case fits the BlueWater Polarized Lidz Series Sunglasses from Amazon well, although it looks really big.  The material, to my disappointment, is not as stiff and strong as expected, and I think it will dent if enough weight is piled on top of it.  However, for the price, one cannot be too picky."
3.0,It is OK nothing special the fabric is the way it is............
3.0,"They ride incredibly low on the hips. Like hilariously. I thought I'd bought men's pants at first because they were so straight cut. Basically don't sit, breathe, or bend over all day and you should be fine. I'll be returning mine for sure."
3.0,"The necklace is very pretty, but the metal moon part bends very easily. I can bend it with my hands and maybe even snap it. The necklace is very pretty though."
3.0,"Pretty but tight, and I ordered according to the size chart."
3.0,The shirt is a little small.  Should have ordered the next size up to wear with leggings.  Looks cute with jeans though.
3.0,Made of cheap polyester. Not a cotton/spandex knit like I was expecting.
3.0,Not really sure it's the stone they suggest it is. Looks nice and all but fits a little too tight.
3.0,Somewhat narrow..
3.0,This dress is so cute!!! But I’m 5’3” and it’s long for me.
3.0,"Great socks, but we had to cut one inch slots on both sides of each of the elastic bands because they were cutting into our skin and leaving bruises. These socks should have a much wider elastic, so they don't hurt."
3.0,Too big and material too thin
3.0,Cute shirt but doesn't fit. Too tight in the bust area
3.0,"I think the quality was as expected but I ordered a size down after reading reviews and am now trying to return it because I wish would’ve ordered a medium. I am 5’2 and about 150, the dress was a little tighter than what I was looking for"
3.0,These earrings are beautiful and I loved the look of them. But I wore them one time and they broke.<br />I also had an issue with the size of the post. It was slightly too large and didn't go as far through as I would have liked.
3.0,These gloves are very well made and are so soft. They fit kind of snug for a large but will stretch I'm sure. The only reason I gave 3 stars instead of 4 is because they have a faint but mildew-like odor. I'm hoping this dissipates in time. But for the dollar value they certainly are a nice glove.
3.0,They were a little smaller than expected.  Definitely low rise.  I ended up returning as they were a little too low rise for my taste.  But they were good quality.
3.0,Smaller than expected - quality ok for price
3.0,"Christmas gift and the zipper didn't work on one of the boots.  Kinda ruined it for my wife.  So now I wait for the refund to come so that I can order again and wait for the replacement to arrive.  Quality control?  Maybe, her third pair of these boots.  First one with issues"
3.0,Returned - not what I was looking for.
3.0,"I bought these because I am allergic to the sun, only on the back of my hands.  They do the job.  Highly overpriced for the quality.  Badly finished, snag easily.  I don't think they would be good for warmth.  As stated, they do the job for me, but t"
3.0,"The dress fit as expected and would be very cute if it didn't look so cheap. Very thin and not good quality. But for the price what do you expect. If you think may what to return this product after purchasing it, get rid of that thought. The cost to return the item is way more than the original purchase price + shipping you paid to get it. They do not tell you that you will have to pay 3 times the amount of what you pay for the dress in order to return it. The returns must be shipped over seas, thus resulting in over $50 in postage not to mention completing customs forms. Not worth the hassle."
3.0,"This sweater is the softest I've ever worn. If you're going for comfort, you'll love this! However, I just couldn't get passed the awkward neckline. I expected the sweater to be almost like a short turtle neck, but it wasn't. It was a lose crew neck with a thick hemline. I ended up returning!"
3.0,"This is a good shirt, the cut/quality of the shirt are excellent.  I'm happy about it and have gotten some laughs in medical school wearing it.  The only thing I'd mention is that the feel is like the text might start to crack fairly quickly.  Not necessarily a bad thing, cracked text can give a false sense of age in a good way, but it's nice to know that that's a thing.<br /><br />Update: after about 2 years, the text on this shirt has faded quite a bit, and there is a tear near the collar.  I still like the material of the shirt and the cut, but this has made me second guess the quality of the manufacture."
3.0,I like the convenience but they break easy and the clips are flimsily
3.0,"Green earrings are light , black and white are to heavyt"
3.0,"This is a FANTASTICLY made chest vest, don’t get me wrong. But I was sadly disappointed when I discovered  the fitment was too small and there is no room for adjustment (up in girth). VERY durable product. Very well made. This WILL PROTECT  YOU if and when, in the event of, it being… needed… due to dump/accident. That being said…I would order a size OR TWO SIZES UPPP from what you normally would."
3.0,It would have been a perfect seat cover except for when it arrived the blue plastic trimming on the seat was cracked and peeling. I really loved the color because it matched my mountain bike perfectly. They refunded my money for this purchase and told me I could keep the seat but I can not use it because the cracks will cut my legs. I thank them for being considerate in trying to make up for the faulty product.  Kudos to them.
3.0,It's kind of sheer and was expecting longer sleeves but can't beat the price
3.0,"I was hopeful that I would like this dress.  I really wanted to - I  liked the pattern and was looking for something along the lines of retro to wear to work.  Unfortunately,  when I put it on it just looked cheap and a little busy with the ruffles.  Almost like a costume.  Also, the elastic waistband was too high and it came up even higher in the front.  The dress seemed like it was supposed to have a belt with it, but it did not.  If you do decide to try this dress (shipping is free both ways, so you aren't out any $), be aware that it is sheer and you will need to wear a slip underneath it."
3.0,These were so cute but the hats (which came preassembled) kept breaking. Either the string would pop or the fuzzy ball would just fall off.  The sign had to be threaded which was annoying considering other signs made by different manufactures coke threaded already. I wouldn’t buy it again and it’s completed unusable now but it was cute while it lasted.
3.0,The brightness factor can be enhanced and the length of the tie should be about 2 to 4 inches longer.
3.0,The backs bend pretty easily
3.0,"This is not nearly as long as the picture makes it look-I didn't check the measurements but it barely comes past my hips.  The pockets are also super awkward, sewed over the seam that runs under the armpits, so the pockets are almost behind you.  The material is very thin and soft.  For the price I paid it is fine and I will wear it."
3.0,Baby earings to me
3.0,The color is pretty.  It is a bit stiff and hard to open to get inside.
3.0,Skirt wasnt as advertised and onsie was bigger than expected.
3.0,Lens are too light....I would prefer them to be darker
3.0,"This bra runs SUPER SMALL. It barely covers my nipples and I know why they give you the extender, because 9 out of 10 people will need to use it.<br />I wouldn't recommend this. I kept it but will have to literally tape my boobs when I use it"
3.0,Cheap plastic. Total junk!
3.0,It's ok but not suggest anyone to buy it.
3.0,"Product itself seems nice, but way small.  Mens large, which I wear in everything just fine, wont go past my thighs.  Gave to my 13 year old and fit him fine."
3.0,Based on the reviews I sized up. That was a big mistake. Where do your regular size or maybe even size down. It is a specially large through the hip area and at the wrists.
3.0,Hated the color.
3.0,"A bit bumpy, not completely smooth on the foot."
3.0,Very tiny earrings but cute!
3.0,Nice watch.  Battery was dead when received
3.0,"We haven't had this long, but the metal back has already started to peel off and cut my daughters fingers."
3.0,Expected it to be bigger. But I like it.
3.0,Love the design but this fits odd. It's wider than normal at the shoulders. Just looks weird.
3.0,"The dress is absolutely beautiful but I'm 5'6 165lbs and I ordered an XL seeing women with my body type buying a L-XL and it seemingly fitting (in costumer review pics). It looks like a child XL. I am considering giving it to my 9 year old niece, There is no way I can get this thing on my body, and I thought I was being smart buying the size up. I'm so disappointed, because the fabric is beautiful and otherwise it would have been a perfect dress."
3.0,"It was a little tight, for gay guys getting this or guys in general I’d suggest going up a size from whatever you think you might be or maybe even two sizes, still a cute crop and you’ll get everyone’s attention with this on"
3.0,"First off, no pockets. Guess I didn’t look good enough. I ordered a 2X because I didn’t want it tight, but way big"
3.0,"I am a big, big fan of Allegra K dresses, but this was a swing and a miss. Big time.<br />The color was beautiful and the length was great. That’s all I can come up with that’s complimentary.<br />The dress was way larger than anticipated, but that’s not really a deal breaker, however the tie on the dress was quite strange. It really didn’t seem to make sense. It was in an odd area and I could not figure it out or make it look acceptable. The dress looks pretty in the photos but I just couldn’t replicate the look, even if the dress was true to size. It was disappointing."
3.0,The fabric is lovely and the fit is great. My only complaint is that the seam at the waist is sewn crooked. If I had paid more for it I would probably return it but for the price I'll overlook it.
3.0,"Very very pretty! Floes good, fits good. I wish they made my size! But they didn't stitch together the dress well enough! The dress came apart all the way down the seem of the dress and it took so long to receive the product I didn't even return the dress(prob because of covn19 for the long delivery (idk). I emailed them to ask if I can return the dress and they got back to me quick! I just didn't bother reading it and kept the dress."
3.0,"Too big, need to return."
3.0,I shouldn't have bought this anklet. It looks nice but really fragile. Mine broke after just two days.
3.0,"I get tons of compliments in this hat. I love the way it fits. However, it was shipped crumpled in a little bag. I was able to get the hat wet and iron it with a pressing cloth. After a little work I got most of the wrinkles out."
3.0,"Although it is a very cute dress the fit is awkward. I did return it because there was no fixing the way it bulged feom the armpit area to my breast. The semi petticoat was very itchy as well, but fine with a slip. The fabric however was comfy on the skin and had a small amount of stretch."
3.0,"Quality is not the best since they're thin cotton but I like it because they're thigh-high socks. I'm a size 8 shoe, these socks were a little loose for me. It's an OK socks though! Good for fall season!"
3.0,Ordered Xlrg but is more like a large.🙁
3.0,"Very plain, comfortable masks.. I was looking for a little more style. They are fine for day wear, but I wear masks with rhinestones on them for a dramatic effect."
3.0,"I absolutely LOVE this watch. Unfortunately, like another watch I had purchased from Amazon, parts fell off after only wearing it a few times. The watch loops ripped off and additional loops had to be purchased. Still a good value overall, but be prepared to order extra loops to secure the band in place."
3.0,"With a good ironing they look okay, but aren't a high quality blazer. Still decent for the one day we needed them. We ordered two sizes up and it worked out for our guys"
3.0,Wrinkles badly.
3.0,It was an ok fit
3.0,"To thick, makes it hard to insert in a wallet."
3.0,Be careful what you order.  I ordered the dark green and it is closer to black.  If you hold it in the light just right it has just a tint of green.  Definitely not the shade it shows on line.  Quality it very nice.
3.0,"Small for a XXL, but as expected. I wanted more room."
3.0,"I was super excited to wear this to match my little, but when I put it on I looked wider. Not flattering at all."
3.0,low quality but cute
3.0,"This is a beautiful, sturdy band that holds well, with little chance of it coming loose if it’s put on correctly. The ends that slide in to the actual watch were just a little bit too long for my womens watch but it can still work. The issue that I had is that my watch required recharging 3 times in 24 hours while wearing.  The only thing I can think is the effect of the magnets on the battery. When I changed back to the original band, no problem."
3.0,"Fit on face uncomfortable, but still cute."
3.0,"I will typically buy tunics or dresses in anything from size 6-10 depending on the style, brand, etc.  I looked at the chart and decided to get an XL as it indicated it was equivalent to a Size 8.  I found it to be more like a 10 or 12, so I would probably get a L next time.  It felt very loose.  The material is stretchy and thin, so that may be one reason.  It was like wearing a big T-shirt.  I am 5' 4&#34; and this falls to a few inches above my knees.  The sleeves are very short.  There's a little bit of a flare in the tunic, which is nice and adds some shape to the bottom.  It will be nice and light and cool this summer.  It's long enough that I could wear it as a dress if I can find the right slip or body shaper for underneath.  I feel like anything I wear could potentially cause lumps and bumps in the material, so I really want one piece of clothing for the entire length.<br /><br />Note: I received a discount to purchase this item in exchange for my honest review."
3.0,"I like the compartments in the purse,I wasn't that satisfied with the quality of the leather.<br />I do like the ideal of the protective lining.keeping your cc information from being scan thru the purse."
3.0,I returned this item and still have not received my refund. I have contacted them as well. Still have yet to hear anything. The beads started falling off neck just from trying on dress. Beautiful dress. Fit perfect but beads didn’t stay. Please refund my money. I returned 2 items. Other item was refunded the day I sent it back. This is still showing it hasn’t been received. I returned this a week before Christmas.
3.0,NICE FIT.
3.0,"Nice, thin, summery material. You will need to wear something underneath.  I ordered it too large. Normally I wear 1X, I should have ordered an XL."
3.0,"It's cute, for some reason I thought the keys would be a bit bigger. But the lobster clasp broke the moment I went to unlatch it. (I can easily fix it though)"
3.0,I got so many compliments on these shoes. But boy do they hurt. I wore these shoes one time and won’t wear them again until I get some numbing spray lol
3.0,these run for me about 1/2 a size too small.  They fit but tight.  I've only had them for about a week so not really sure how they will work out.  I like my running/workout shoes a lil big for using the heavy sock so have to switch to a much thinner one for these to work
3.0,Cute little bag.  Wasn't so excited with the color.  Very bright red that made it look cheaper.
3.0,The picture on the apron was nice. I just would have preferred a cotton material. It seems as though it was a polyester material
3.0,The color quality is really nice but the fabric itself is a lot stiffer than I expected
3.0,Zipper is in the back so it is inconvenient to zip up. Runs small. No give in waist so make sure you have enough room in the waist for sitting and zipping up the skirt. I usually wear size 12/large but this item in size 12 didn’t fit. Too small.
3.0,Product fits great 👍.  Just wish it was a true white. It has a blue hue like it was washed with jeans.
3.0,Llegaron con manchas
3.0,"The quality seems to be good but they don't flex with the body very well when bending down or kneeling. It seems to me it's the way it's stitched together, it just has a bad pattern to it."
3.0,Buyer Beware!  I ordered an XL and received a Small.  Nice fabric but returning.
3.0,Dress was a bit bulky. Not for a small frame individual.
3.0,Much tighter than expected given the size ordered.
3.0,"I thought the color would be a nice bright green and it was more a light lime green, otherwise I would have gave it a  star"
3.0,It’s cheap<br />It work out!
3.0,This is more like a heavy T-shirt than a sweatshirt.  Its very casual.  I do like it but I was looking for something warmer.
3.0,Not the material it was expected to be.
3.0,So I hate the way it looks. Working out it was still difficult to breathe so I’ll be working out at home. And it was a little big so I had to sew it to get a better fit.
3.0,The fabric gets real wrinkled and stretched out of shape.
3.0,"I ordered these glasses with the impression that they would be sunglasses to fit over my adult-sized glasses. I have a smaller face (and I'm assuming a narrower frame) and even with that being said, they just did not fit over my glasses and rather bumped into my glasses frame as I was putting them on. I wouldn't recommend them if you already wear glasses, and even if you didn't, I noticed they were still a tight fit and could be challenging to fit on an adult face. These may be great for children, and because they seem to wrap around and the design somewhat closes the gaps between the glasses and the face, they might be good for shielding out the sun for a child who has light sensitivities, or needs something to wear after getting their eyes dilated at an eye exam. Otherwise, if they're intended for an adult, they might be disappointing (not to mention not that aesthetically appealing)."
3.0,"My daughter is 40"" 35 lbs and I purchased the dress in a 5T. The straps on the overalls are a bit long and the torso is a bit tight on her and she says she is uncomfortable. The material is somewhat thin and does have some wrinkles. I purchased a size up from her normal 4T thinking she could wear it for longer, but because it's so tight in the body I do not see that happening."
3.0,I used this for my Firefly cosplay. I didn't pay attention to the size I ordered (oops lol) so these were much smaller than I anticipated. More like a toddler size. But that's my fault so I will not base my review on that. These were perfect for painting ( I bought the plain white ones) ! The  main issue I have them is both have broken supports (the piece that holds it open) and they also both had one or two broken wooden pieces in the top. I managed to make it work for what I needed as I didn't have time to send back and order a replacement.
3.0,Has started falling apart. Only used during 1 and a half of band at school every other day.
3.0,"These earrings are cute and just like pictured! Although they are a bit bigger than in the picture. The backing was very difficult to get on and one post was bent. Overall they are cute but I have my doubts that they are gold plated. As soon as I put them in, my ears started burning. I wouldn't reccomend for those who are sensitive to certain metals."
3.0,"These are great shorts to run in.  Very light and great fit.<br /><br />The size chart, as others notes is wrong.  Size up one. 6' 1"" 180 large is a great fit.<br /><br />These have one small pocket in the back.  That's it. No side pockets.<br /><br />The washing instructions are just insane -- I posted them."
3.0,"they are not as bright as pictured, but they are ok. I just wish they were brighter is all.  They are nice socks however."
3.0,Good quality but very short in torso
3.0,I bought this for an 11 year old. I had purchased 2 of the different color configuration that either shipped Prime or arrived within a week. Those suits were fine. This one took a while to get here and it was shipped directly from China. The suit has a horrible chemical smell! I have been airing it out then I will try to wash it. Nice suit otherwise. I hope we can use it though.
3.0,"It wears okay, but the color is very dark blue, not the same blue as the picture shows."
3.0,Button holes odd
3.0,"I'm 160 lbs 5'5 pair shape, large was a little big.  I think a medium would fit better. Its perfectly priced for what I need it for; which is something comfortable to wear while still looking professional on video conference calls.  Its not something that I would wear out in public as it looks cheap up close but its perfect for video meetings when working from home. I gave it 3 stars because the quality is Walmart level."
3.0,"This product was absolutely adorable right out of the package . (I got the maroon- ish one with the white polka dots and the pink ribbon and flowers).<br />Medium fits like a dream, so I’d say if you’re at the lower end of a size , go with a size DOWN. Ex: I may have bought a large, but bought a medium, based on others Reviews about the fit.<br />I’m at the upper end of a medium, and 5’9, 155 lbs, and I very glad i went with the medium- as the large would’ve been too big. And you want a dirndl such as this, to fit like a glove and almost “hold” you in, like a girdle. I wear mine daily, and aside from being very flattering, it’s very comfortable.<br />I haven’t washed it yet, so we’ll see how the dress holds up throughout some wear and tear.<br />I gave the three stars as The zipper is SUPER  flimsy, and on the side of the dress. (Really plastic and cheap, so I took off 2 stars for that) . As I had to “condition” the zipper, zipping it up, and down, and making it loosen up, so I could actually get it to flow better, as the material and thread was getting stuck in the zipper, which I had to fix before I was able to zip the dirndl properly.  If this was constructed with a better zipper - it would be PERFECTION. But after some “conditioning “ it worked fine. I even contemplated putting a new one in, but I’m no seamstress, so decided to tweak the stitching surrounding the zipper a bit, and it worked perfect."
3.0,Very pretty bras but one of the bras were not the size that I asked for. I was pretty displeased with that because now I have a broad that can't fit but I called Amazon and they help me with that and the quick and kind fashion.
3.0,kinda bites
3.0,Took a while to come almost forgot about it.. But it was nice
3.0,"The other reviews are definitely right, not much room for your head and no room at all for your hair. However, making sure all the padding was in the right place gave me a little more room and the stretch of the fabric allowed me to cover my head with it. I added an elastic under-chin strap sewn into either side. That was the only way it stayed on my head."
3.0,The dress is cute but the Material ripped under the belt. Only wore it once.
3.0,To cheap looking.  Too much blue.
3.0,"This dress is not loose.  It is, however, well made."
3.0,"The quality is what I expected, except for the butt coverage. If in doubt, get a size bigger. All other expectations will be met with this pant."
3.0,"Pro: arrived much sooner than expected ( like 3 weeks sooner). Based on delivery estimate at check out I assumed it was coming from China.  Fits as expected. I’m 5’4, 130 and wear a size small ; these fit perfectly. The length is great for me<br />Con: does not look like photo. Color is true; there is no drawstring- only elastic waist. I would prefer the waist look like the photo; however, I do like the ankles even though they don’t look like photo. I’m glad they are not elastic. They do look a bit thin/ see through. I will take more care with washing than normal.<br />Overall: I will keep. I like the pockets,color, ankles, fit."
3.0,The waist was right but the top was a little too small that it pulls the crotch up to far and tight
3.0,"Decent little readers for very occasional use (reading menus, filling out forms, etc.). The glass has an odd yellow tint that I guess is supposed to be the blue-light blocking ""feature,"" but this is the first time I've seen that feature go quite so yellow. There's also significant glare when I use these, making them unpleasant for more than a couple of minutes at a time. The case is pretty flimsy, being easy-to-distort, thin metal, but it does the job well enough in the bottom of a handbag. All that said, these seem overpriced even the $13.95 as of this writing."
3.0,Very pretty necklace. Top was glued on not straight but very pretty.
3.0,The glasses r ok but video isn't
3.0,"Very cute, simple, and chic necklace but I gave it 3 stars because after 2 uses, it started turning color so I had to toss it.  You get what you pay for."
3.0,It was super cute... would've preferred it to be a bit tighter.  Buckled in at times. Lost a few gold clips but I glued to secure.<br />I would recommend for price and costume!
3.0,Looks cheap and is extremely small.  My husband wears a small cap but this is too small.
3.0,I normally wear a medium so I ordered a xl and it is way to big! I just took it in a little bit on the sides and it looks great. Looks exactly as pictured. Material is soft and comfy but I haven't worn it much so we'll see how it holds up.
3.0,First off it arrived on time and the package was intact. I'm always leery of buying anything polyester and unfortunately this top is polyester with a touch of spandex. It has the polyester sheen to it and I wouldn't consider it a sweat shirt by any means. Mine does not match the photo as far as the colors go. It's lightweight and the fabric is cold so this is more of a summer top. I didn't return it due to the hassle of China returns.
3.0,Cute but very small.  Hard to see.
3.0,"Super cute, but runs super small!"
3.0,Leather is not high quality
3.0,"They were ok for the short season, they snag very easily."
3.0,"I ordered this in white because the black wasn't eligible for Prime shipping for whatever reason and of course I waited until the last minute. It fit pretty well and was actually kind of cute, the white was just a little too sheer for my liking in a cover-up. Also, while it was roomy enough to be comfortable everywhere else, it was a little short for me to be completely comfortable, so I returned it. I think if I had bought the black (which appears to be less sheer) the length wouldn't have bothered me as much. I ended up buying a very similar black one in Mexico for cheap. ;) For size reference, I am 5'4&#34; and a size 16."
3.0,"The bag is lightweight and very roomy.  I purchased it for our roadtrip to Yellowstone and was excited that it was bigger than expected and that I would have room to add anything I purchase on our trip.  I only filled it about 2/3 full and on the third day the zipper started to 'unzip' when zipped up.  or just not zip up when trying to close it.  I could understand if I stuffed the bag, but it wasn't and had plenty of room, it appears to be a defect of the zipper."
3.0,They were inexpensive sunglasses but are not xxl or even xl. The sunglasses I received do not look nearly as big as some of the pictures other customers have posted. They size would fit right on a child’s face.  Also they feel pretty cheap. For this price I have gotten better quality sunglasses on amazon.
3.0,"Agree about pockets staying open. Other than that, it's a nice nightgown--fabric is fine, holds up in wash, like the blue color. I feel pretty frumpy in it, and I'm a pretty casual dresser."
3.0,"its nice for what it is. its alluminum i believe with nickel plate. the design is nice and there is a mid-section where, (im assuming) you can engrave"
3.0,Definitely misleading picture this bracelet doesn't wear like that. It just bunches up on your wrist and looks terrible and is uncomfortable to wear
3.0,The turquoise is flat and looks like plastic.  I was disappointed as I bought them to match a necklace made of turquoise stones.
3.0,"Looked good on, however material is thin and doesn’t stay off the shoulder. It served its purpose for the price."
3.0,shud b larger
3.0,Nice quality. I thought it would be more of a blue color as depicted but it was green
3.0,I bought this wig for comic con 2018 and it did the job however it was tight and gave me a small headache and it’s thin you can see the wig cap if you move the hair a certain way... also it tangles hella fast!
3.0,"I gave this product three stars because it looked very classy for my conservative husband.<br />I ONLY GAVE THIS PRODUCT THREE STARS because the &#34;velvet&#34; liner was loose from two corners and the glass was hanging out.  I got some glue and had to allow 24 hours for it to dry.  So far, (30 hours later), it is still hanging in there.<br /><br />I think some quality control might be in order and rather just putting a glob of glue in the corners, glue the ENTIRE EDGE!!!!<br /><br />Overall, if the glue I put in holds, I'll be satisfied."
3.0,"Not very comfortable for my 4 year old. First time it came it was broken, they replaced it quickly tho."
3.0,These shoes fit to size but the shoe strings are a strange material (not normal) that are hard to the and to keep tied. My son is at the age where he is learning to tie and these are extremely difficult for him and for me.
3.0,I'm a small lady but I like the way mens sweatshitrs fit. This one is nice pretty thick but it pilled up after the first wash. But its still a good sweatshirt for wearing around the house or camping or whatever.
3.0,"Returned. Fabric felt nice, but these were much shorter in person that they appear in the pics!"
3.0,"Cute shirt. The fabric is a little light, dont think it will last too long after a couple washing however, but it is cute for now. You have to wear a tank top under it or it will be see through. Would be cute for a bathing suit cover up. It was also not as long in the front as it looks in this picture. Was short in front, long in back. The mullet of all shirts."
3.0,"Most of review said was too small and too short. I am 5'4 150, i have work out body. I normally wear M.  But I order it L, coz the review. Anyways, L was ok too. I don't think the dress has wrist line. Maybe need add a belt. I recall why I still buy it? Coz I think was cheap."
3.0,NICE MATERIAL COULD NOT RETURN BECAUSE ALL WAS SOLD OUT
3.0,My some loves the necklace but it didn't come with the ##
3.0,"These were thicker than I expected them to be. They bunch up occassionally in my daughter's brace. Otherwise, I think they do the job, but I may try another brand next."
3.0,light weight but very small
3.0,"This is very thin material so you won't want to wear it in very cold or very windy conditions. It works fine for me on cold runs but some cold air does go straight through the material. Also, it seems a little expensive considering it has about the same amount of material as two wool socks."
3.0,"Compared to the Happy Sail brand, these are way smaller."
3.0,Shoes was a little bigger than expected.
3.0,Cheaply made. Looks better online
3.0,Pretty but way too see through material.  Will have to wear a slip.
3.0,"These looked cute, but were too big and impractical for a girl with small nipples and an active hockey league."
3.0,Cute but too small. If your debating buy a size bigger. I use L sometimes XL and this fit like a medium.
3.0,They were smaller than I normally wear but I like them
3.0,"They don't help as much as I'd like for my 3-year-old daughter.  Here glasses keep falling down on her nose and I was hoping that these would help.  But she doesn't like them too tight because then they hurt her ears.  Also, we often forget to turn them to face her ears properly."
3.0,Too small and buttons look like gold and they are silver
3.0,"Ordered two sizes per recommendations and one was too small, one too big! Cute but didn’t work."
3.0,They are good quality just way longer than they look on the pictures.
3.0,They were larger than expected.
3.0,"It's not bad overall, but after one wear the boning was starting to push through the seams. Not bad if you are looking for a relatively affordable option, but it will probably wear out quickly."
3.0,Colorful bucket hat for my son. He likes it but a little bit big can’t adjust the size
3.0,I really like the look of this ring but the flowers cut into my finger so I can't where it for very long. Also the stone is way too light of a blue color and doesn't sparkle much.
3.0,"Okay, so I'm giving these three stars because they're good for pajama pants, unless you're like 5'8 or taller. I'm 5'4, and the waist on these goes up to my boobs, fitting at the crotch. I honestly couldn't help but laugh. They are comfortable, a little stiff, but not bad for pajamas honestly. I was hoping to have these as cute comfy wear that I could tuck a tank into and head out the door, but nobody besides my husband will be seeing me in these slouchy sluggers!"
3.0,"Okay, I’m from the south where we have a Rodeo twice a year and our kids get off of school for “Rodeo Day!”  So, I’ve seen plenty of authentic cowboy hats. This hat has all the makings of a good hat, leather strap, leather band, straw,etc.  but, it falls a little short.<br /><br />Because it is advertised as a bendable hat, it seems to get misshapen  easily.  I do like the coloring and the foam inserts are a nice feature to help size the hat. But, I don’t think it’s a true authentic hat.<br /><br />My grandson’s loved it!  They enjoyed wearing it with their cowboy outfits. My daughter loves it for her sun hat when she works outside. We all agreed that it’s more a costume hat than an authentic hat.<br /><br />Summary:<br />(1) 100% natural straw<br />(2) 3” brim and 3.5"" crown<br />(3) ventilated<br />(4) adjustable chin strap<br />(5) elasticize sweatband"
3.0,The bracelet pulls fine arm hair and the pendants have black chalky residue.  I do love the little sphere though!
3.0,"I own two of these dresses, the green with the wheat pattern and the red floral. The green is a typical poly-blend, purchased last summer. I love it so much I bought the red floral this summer. The red has an odd sheen to the fabric. I don’t hate it but I don’t love it either. I downgraded my review for the unappealing fabric (it’s also slightly heavier). The fit is still as expected. It’s great to be able to adjust the height of the neck and waist for a “custom” fit."
3.0,"The necklace is faded, poor guilty."
3.0,Bra looks very cute on but since it is one size  fits all if your bustier like myself I wear a 36 D which is a pretty big size for a one size fits all kind of thing it does not fit properly my boobs spill come out of the bottom a little but its very cute I will keep it just to wear around the house but don't feel confident it will keep everything in if I tried to wear it with an outfit. I would next time order something similar that gives you an option size like a large.
3.0,"I like the blouse, but it's not true to size..I was  afraid of that, so I ordered a size larger and it's still to small."
3.0,Not a true medium.  Definitely size up. And it's a thinner material
3.0,"If my earrings aren't symetrical, I like to have a left facing version and a right facing version. The display image shows two versions; what I received are two peacocks both looking to the left."
3.0,"The color & length of these are awesome, but the sizing was off. I've bought several pairs of Wallflower jeans, shorts, & capri's but never had a problem with the sizing. I ordered a size 3 & they fit more like a size 1 on the hips/waist. I normally get the &#34;luscious curvy&#34; fit for jeans & shorts, so maybe that's why these gave me a &#34;diaper-butt&#34; kind of fit. I don't have a huge butt, but I definitely have shape back their, & these did nothing to  accentuate my booty. Wish they had a better fit because they were really cute."
3.0,"Cute shirt, but runs big. I feel like I needed a whole size smaller."
3.0,"3 stars as it has helped relieve numbness and tingling in my hands while road cycling for 1-2 hour outings. However, padding seems thin and I doubt these will last more than a year."
3.0,Very thin material. Color was not the same as picture. Fit weird in the hips.
3.0,A man must have designed this top! Why on earth do companies feel adjustable straps are not necessary?!? This would have received 5 stars if I could have adjusted the straps. Super cute!
3.0,"I like the item, and the material used to make item.  But the item does run small."
3.0,One month in and the ring is bent outward. None of the keys have come off on their own but they do end up stuck between being on the ring and being off the ring
3.0,Good product but runs a size smaller than I normally wear
3.0,"very hard to resize it,"
3.0,The colors on these earrings are very nice. I love the design.  Unique.<br />These are not hoop earrings.<br />They ear stems bent when I put the backings on.  I was not rough.  I have never had this happen with any other earrings.
3.0,This is not actually any thinner than other wallets once you put your cards and cash in the wallet.  The quality is decent and the functionality is good.
3.0,These hoops aren't clean edges they are cut and bent. And they are hard to bend. But I still use them not my favorite but useable.
3.0,"I get a lot of compliments on this hat and it looks great. The brim is a little narrow, but I guess it's fine. Not the best hat I have, but it's nice"
3.0,"Not really pink--rose is more lavender/lt. purple. Vendor needs to update product picture or description to ensure people don't expect a pink rose as pictured. Also, our piece in the center is not quite perfectly centered.<br /><br />We have bought several (5-6) necklaces from this vendor and we are normally very happy; however, I think I will second guess further purchases. We are only keeping because it is a hassle to return and it is pretty...just won't match what we intended it for."
3.0,"My dimensions match well with the measurements they list (for the burgundy blouse), but this was too tight on both the chest and wrist.  Not the best material but nice enough that I will reorder in a larger size."
3.0,It is Leger
3.0,"If you are a taller female, do not purchase. It’s short and the quality of the material is very cheap."
3.0,"I got these for a job interview and just trying them on, there is a hole in them -_- I have big upper arms- 18 inch and it does fit, it's tight but it covers all tattoos!  Only good for a few wears but it works, I got the job!"
3.0,Bought for a friend but was very small. More for a young girl
3.0,"Ordered a small. But, fit like an x large. Cute Shirt though"
3.0,"Plankton had a red eye and his body was blue, SpongeBob was all yellow and green didn't look good at all and Sandy's cheeks where green, only good ones where Patrick, Gary, and Squidward."
3.0,"It's hard to fit anything bulky in it.  I could squeeze two passport in, but it was tight to snap"
3.0,Too stretchy with no support. I sent them back.
3.0,The package only had two pair instead of three pair.
3.0,"They seem to fit fine. They stay up, and don't fall down during the day."
3.0,"My laptop is a 17 inch so it doesn't even fit in the bag and the inside is so cheap I would be scared that it would rip anyways, don't get me wrong its a cute bag but I would probably use it as a weekender bag just to keep it. I thought it was much bigger reading the reviews its to bad its not suitable for school."
3.0,While I like this dress and the pockets it is very short.  I am only 5'3 1/2 and was shocked how short it was.
3.0,Don't get me wrong it's a good mask looks good it just feels weird because of the way it was sewn
3.0,This is to replace the same thing that lasted about 4 years in the Arizona sun
3.0,Truly needs a belt so that it can hide the scrunchy waistband
3.0,If you have boobs don't even bother with this one.
3.0,"My daughter really liked the look and feel of them, but they broke within two weeks. They have a plastic clip that holds the strap together.  Just not durable enough."
3.0,Cute dress but not enough wiggle room for my liking.
3.0,Cute but a little short not great for people with long torsos.
3.0,"They are cute however I ordered a 7 my usual size and these were about a size too big. They are not well made at all. They scratched my calf and are irritating. The right foot the zipper had no openings, it was sewn shut. You would have to unlace the entire thing to remove it.  If you have big claves these are definitely not for you unless you get different laces for them."
3.0,Looks like picture and fits as expected but don't like the fabric at all. The inside fabric feels very cheap.
3.0,"Decent quality, colors nice & rich (got the purple & black) ran small...not true XL sizes...size up@"
3.0,Nice dress but run too large.  Had to return.
3.0,"Too big for face gator, I will just sew the ear holes closed and use as a tube top."
3.0,"really bad material, sheds fast"
3.0,A little smaller but still beautiful.
3.0,one pin doesn't stay in at all
3.0,"This dress actually fit perfectly on me. However one of the elastic on the sleeve give out on me, so I had to return it.<br />Btw, I wish the button on the dress were better, because cheap clear button just looks bad..."
3.0,WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THESE. KIND OF WHIMPY
3.0,"This is my 3rd one of these, and I have learned that with everyday use, the little cap that is threaded onto the end of the cable comes loose, and the keys go flying everywhere,  So, great little key holder as long as you put some Locktite on the threads before installing the end cap."
3.0,This was a good gift at a great deal. But it is costume jewelry not made to last or be real flashie.
3.0,"This leotard has a weird cut to the bottom portion and perhaps runs a tad bit large? It does not fit my child and she has to wear a non-see-through skirt. Otherwise, you can see her undergarment."
3.0,CHEAPLY MADE BUT LOOK AT THE PRICE. HOT FABRIC
3.0,Wider and longer compared to as shown on the photos but it’s worth it for the price. Quality is good.
3.0,I really like the look of this wallet but the zipper is a little stiff and the card slots are pretty tight. I'm hoping that they'll loosen up the more I use them.
3.0,"I am a size 10, I bought this in a 10 but my heal was sticking out and that makes it painful to wear it because of the hard soul. I think I may other a size 11 to be safe."
3.0,"I got the rings  blanks,  but NO cabochons...I need those sizes to finish this project.  HELP"
3.0,The dress is very pretty but didn't fit me well.  I'm 5'4&#34; 185 pounds.  I ordered the XL but it was tight.  The waist line of the dress was to high for me. I'll be returning it but only because it didn't fit well.
3.0,THEY ARE NICE.
3.0,"Pretty decent pair of glasses, the hinges could be made a little better but for 12 bucks you can't beat it!"
3.0,I thought that the top of the boot would b elastic and provide a little room to stretch....
3.0,The zipper keep going down
3.0,"Long in the arms, too small in the shoulders. Cut for a long skinny person.  I'm 6' and 190 athletic build"
3.0,The style of this dress is very cute. I would have liked a better fabric. It is a cheap polished cotton which wrinkles badly. It runs very small.
3.0,One size does not fit all! I wear a large under armor work out pant and these are tight as heck!!!! I was worried about them splitting while working out! And the top constantly rolls down!
3.0,Nice but all glass or synthetic. Not real stones
3.0,"The only problem is that the elastic was too tight.  I didn't want to bother with returning the skirt because will only wear it at home anyway.  So I removed the elastic and just tie it tight with the cord is in the same channel as the elastic.  Otherwise, it fits fine and the quality of the fabric is good."
3.0,"Pretty, but very small. It’s child size."
3.0,"It is cute. The necklace is taken off, no water gets to it. It is already losing the color it is not bright yellow color now it is light brown.<br />A little disappointed."
3.0,One band broke within a month
3.0,This was delivered on time. It is very good for the money and accomplishes what I needed. It is very small.
3.0,Great design yet execution lacked .<br />If you are a M ....get a large
3.0,"The stripe is only on the right side of the suit. It’s polyester- and like slinky polyester.. was expecting more of a terry cloth feel. Yeah, that’s my bad. I ordered the XXL and still super snug on top. For reference, I’m 5’9”, 190, short torso, long legs, 38D, typically wear a 12, typically wear 32”- 34” waist, but always size up for inconsistencies. I’ll donate it rather than go through the hassle of returning. The length was great, waist was fine, but the top - meh on sizing. Meaning I like a looser fit and this was bodycon for sure."
3.0,I bought these for my 4 year old. She absolutely loved them but she can't just keep them in like we're used to because they are heavy for her little ears and ended up stretching her holes. They are very pretty but just wish they were made lighter weight
3.0,Pretty and hangs well.  A little snug in the arms for XL ladies. But I hate the feel of the fabric. Scratchy and kind of slick.
3.0,I really like it but it does show wear very quickly.
3.0,"It a little cheaply made. You don't see the 'Dog Mom' printed too well on the charm, but it does fit Pandora bracelets. it came in a little bag small enough to hold the charm and it was on time, delivery wise."
3.0,I love the hat! Just a little small for my taste
3.0,"I love the feel of this, the color is beautiful (mint green) but I ordered a 12-18 month size and it’s small. More like a 9 month size so order up"
3.0,Pretty for the price. But smaller than expected
3.0,"I purchased one of these for my mom.  It is very beautiful, but there are three strikes against it, for which I am taking off two stars.<br /><br />(1) The material has a low coefficient of friction, which means the outer strap slips off the shoulder when carrying unless there is a lot of weight in the bag.<br /><br />(2) The zipper on the inner pocket bust pretty quickly and doesn't work anymore.<br /><br />(3) There are no washing instructions -- the only tag says &#34;made in china&#34;.  But I am pretty sure you can't wash it, because it feels like there is a cardboard panel on the bottom.  The best you can do is wipe it down if it gets dirty."
3.0,The product was what I wanted but the 'one size fits all' doesn't. I wear an 18 and they were definitely too small.
3.0,It’s a beautiful scarf but definitely not a blanket scarf. The picture of the model in the scarf is extremely misleading. But would make a very nice regular scarf that’s a tiny bit larger than normal.
3.0,Not great quality.  Very thin but acceptable.  You get what you pay for
3.0,Snap already broke so now it won’t close. It’s perfect wallet for me but it’s upsetting when I hadn’t had it a month and the snap already broke.
3.0,"These socks are colorful and seem strong enough to last awhile.  I wore them both walking and running with no problems.  Even held up in its first wash.  They do seem to run small, good for teenagers and woman, but not men with big feet."
3.0,Like it. Runs small will return for exchanged
3.0,It arrived on time but had two holes on the back of the dress. It's material is thin and see through so I put dark undergarments on. The bust fit well but the dress hit above the knees and rode up as I walked. I wish it didnt arrive with holes and was a bit longer.
3.0,"attractive slipper, no arch support at all, and they break down and get loose real quick. They are really good for one season of use if you wear them daily for a few hours."
3.0,"It was very tight around the ankles, but it helped with sweat."
3.0,"I ordered a medium based off of the size chart provided and it came pretty large, especially the upper part. I tried it with a belt to see if I liked it better with a defined cut off between top and bottom, and unfortunately I didn't like it any more. I did return the dress for a refund. No problems from seller."
3.0,"Watch is curved where it meets band, band is straight. Everything else looks OK, but that's a cheap corner cut. Went back similar band that is more beat up but flush where it meets watch."
3.0,Not bad but for the price expected a little better
3.0,Good material but too small and too short<br />My hand small and order medium but it is too small
3.0,Not as tins in the advertisement
3.0,"When trying to pull some of the earrings off of the paper, the earrings sometimes split into 2 pieces - the clear plastic part and the thin colored part."
3.0,Very low profile hat. Not what I was looking for.
3.0,Much smaller then I thought. Medium is more like a small
3.0,I like style and fit but the material is completely see through. If I don't find a slip I like by tomorrow I will have to return.
3.0,Threads coming out of the shirt all over the place...not too impressed with the quality control that SHOULD have checked these shirts before they sent them out.  Also they run a bit small so if you're towards the tighter side of your size go ahead and order up a size.
3.0,"The kitties are very cute. A couple of the kitties are male ;) and we found that pretty funny. One of the kitties broke from the chain the day after we got them and was lost. That was very unfortunate. Other than that, it was a decent buy."
3.0,"I like the quality of the graphic, but wish the length was a bit more. I’m 6’2” and the XL is a tad short."
3.0,Super stiff material. I returned it.
3.0,Only con I have is that there is very little (nearly none) cushion on these.
3.0,"Runs small... I normally wear a Large, I ordered an XL to have room to layer and it fits like a large. Also it doesnt really look like the picture. The camo is a little different. It's more of a silky Under Armour type material...not cottony like the picture shows. It's also kind of short.<br /><br />I'm 5'5"" and 170lbs for reference."
3.0,"These compression sleeves are child size and very small for an adult leg, so I use them for my forearms when lift weight"
3.0,I got a s/m and it's too big.
3.0,"gorgeous colors just like the photos, but way to small.  shirts has no stretch so getting it on a child is difficult."
3.0,Bought for my son for Christmas. A bit smaller than I thought. He can still wear it just not as long as I thought he would. Disappointed.
3.0,Love the pearls ... but silver was kind of black ... looked used... and the boxed it came with was damaged.
3.0,"I have 3 pair...all range in size from M to L and XL. The M fits my neighbor's ten-year-old. The L fits her tween and the XL fits my 6'4"" husband! There's no neoprene, it's polyester-gaberdine! Horrible! ⭐"
3.0,"Definitely a cheaper material, purchased due to mandatory masks required from my employer. Not a one size fits all unfortunately, it is way too big for my face. However I removed all the filters and it’s extremely easy to breathe in now which is what I wanted since I work outside the majority of the time."
3.0,"Nice and soft blouse, but...I bought from this vendor before and fit a size 6, and so I order this in a size 6. Surprisingly, this blouse was too big and I should've listened to the reviews. People said the arm holes are just awkwardly big...they weren't kidding. You could fit 3 more arms in those sleeves! What a shame; I really liked the blouse, but those sleeves are over-exaggerated. I'm 5'2&#34;, 170lbs, 37&#34;-32&#34;-44&#34;."
3.0,"This is a great product, really like the quality and utility value of these pants.  I ordered XL Long and am 6-5 with a 36 inseam and find these to be quite short.  If they made an extra long version I would definitely buy several pairs."
3.0,"Overall, this is a cute shirt. However, I didn’t expect for it to be cropped, and it is. Also, the red version of it says it’s red but in the picture it looks more brown- expect it to be red. Overall I really like it, I just thought it would be longer"
3.0,Way too big. The material is what you would expect in a bathing suit.
3.0,Whispy strands near neck down my look as nice as pictured and dress was missing the bow/sash that was shown in the picture. But for price was ok.
3.0,"Althought very pretty, long,  it only comes down along the arms.... can't wrap around. I have several cloaks and this is a first"
3.0,Cute glasses but smudge and not very clear to see through.
3.0,"For us, this is a little tough to master and get a good result."
3.0,Probably have to get one size up so it fits perfectly was to tight at my size
3.0,lining too long on split end
3.0,Nice color but runs big and has s not baggier of a fit. Also expected the material to be softer
3.0,Hard to put on but ok for price.
3.0,wallet is really good and solid it does not really attach to the purse it takes a lot of cards but it detach from the original purse easily
3.0,"Quality was good, shirt fit around but was WAY too long for a large.  Maybe I should have gotten a medium?"
3.0,"like everything in life, you get what you pay for. this necklace is no exception. I bought it for my wife as a cheap accessory and thats what it is. it arrived broken, the links in the back that hold the pieces together were never tightened and as a result it came apart. Normally i would just send it back but it took very little effort to fix the problem and tighten the loops properly. This too is a problem because the metal they use is very soft and very easy to bend so i assume the loops will reopen at some point or brake completely. The stones are also not lined up on the metal circles properly so anyone who actually bother to take a closer look at it will quickly know this is a cheap piece of jewelry.<br />All in all it looks nice and is priced well enough to justify the poor craftsmanship. I would not buy it again but i will keep the one I got"
3.0,"Nice looking bracelet, but some cheap plastic details. Not quite the quality I expected."
3.0,Very cute however not padded on the bottom at all.  The are not comfy slippers. Feels like your walking barefoot.  The paddings all on top.
3.0,This shirt was short and wide. Not like it’s pictured. I expected the length to be adjusted to compensate for the larger size. But it’s just sort of an awkward length.<br />But the fabric is soft so that’s a plus. Better for someone with a shorter torso.
3.0,Essentially you get what you pay for. They are pretty loose especially for someone with a small wrist but it is cute!
3.0,Wish it would have shrunk when I washed it.  It is a bit too large & I thought it was the proper size.  Like that there are NO wires!
3.0,"...unless you pose like the picture. The pockets are kind of a joke - maybe they would fit an toddlers fist. The material is clingy and the overall shape not too flattering for me. The purple color is nice as shown. The sleeves are fitted at the bottom so don't count on pushing up to 3/4. I find it is very comfy though. Company DOES NOT DO RETURNS so want to warn you of that hassle. ONLY buy from AOSH if it is marked PRIME, else if it doesn't fit you'll be wearing it for jama shirt like me."
3.0,"these boxers are confy and soft, breathes well, I change them every day so smell is never an issue for me, but these tend to ride up my thighs all the times. it's kinda annoying when I'm putting on pants and have to try to reach down my pants to pull the thigh ends down. I'd probably get something different next time."
3.0,Feels like you're trying to put on sheets with a 50 thread count. Gross.
3.0,"The fabric flowers are pretty true in color for this boutonniere.  You have dark Navy Blue, Red, and a unique super dark eggplant purple.  Makes for a very attractive look.  However, some of the flowers for this particular boutonniere just aren't completely formed on the outer edges, which makes this sit very flat.<br /><br />This is a small-ish boutonniere.  The floral arrangement part (not including the stick pin area at all) is the same size is  around 42mm from the base of the flowers to the tip of the gold leaf.  Example - FOR Size Reference:  The same area as the face of an Apple 2 Watch face Or 1.6 Inches.  So not an overly large boutonniere yet still visible.<br /><br />Metal flower has a nice shimmer to it.  Stick pin is very sturdy and has a silicone style seal to keep the tip cover from falling off after this is pined on.  The presentation box that this is presented in, was just to small.  The pin was stored at an angle and the flowers were smooched into the box which didn't allow the flowers to maintain their shape without being crushed.<br /><br />Overall, for this price point is pretty great especially as an alternative to fresh flowers.  This, unfortunately wasn't as well made as the two others I had received."
3.0,"I'm going to return this because it isn't very flattering.  It would look great on someone thinner, with toned arms, but it made my arms look fatter than ever.  The print is really nice, and the fabric was good.  I just didn't like the way it fit around the arms."
3.0,It was to thin. Wanted it more thicker
3.0,"Just not as delicate or crisp as it looks in the photo.  The angle is slightly different, which was okay, but the color is quite yellow.  It also hangs a tad lower than I wanted it to."
3.0,"This is a very cute dress. I usually wear a 12 and I bought an extra large. It looks very good on and is flattering. It fit perfect except for the arms. They are very tight and my arms aren't unusually large. Sadly, I'll be returning it for that reason."
3.0,"Cute socks, but the green is closer to a blueish green than the darker Slytherin house green"
3.0,"These socks are super cute! You really get what you see in pictures, however you can tell they are screen printed.. meaning after wash and use it will crack and fade. Regardless, they’re adorable!"
3.0,The one that has the rhinestone ribbon looks horrible but the other 2 designs are beautiful! Soft fabric and adjustable
3.0,Love SWS! Size fits perfect and shirt is as shown in image provided. I love it!
3.0,Very nice dress runs small
3.0,The larger bag is falling to pieces and I haven't even used it. Poor quality. My husband got these for a surprise. I have added one star as the company has promised a replacement. I will update as to whether or not I receive it.
3.0,"I got mine today, I love how they fit, I love the 8-bit frame, but the yellow isn't even close to the picture. I was expecting a darker yellow much like the picture, but what I got is a painfully bright white-ish neon yellow. Still cool, but definitely not like the picture. Its kind of disappointing, but its ok because I also ordered a black pair."
3.0,"Very comfortable, but I normally fit in a 3xl and that’s what I ordered and it was to big! Would recommend going one size smaller!"
3.0,Wrong size too small.
3.0,Fair quality.  A little small.  It's okay for this summer.
3.0,"These fit a little tight, I had to return them.  They are cute shoes but they also have this weird and large seam where the toe area connects to the lace area, and it really dug into my foot every time I took a step.  This made it super uncomfortable, and I knew it would cause major issues when hiking."
3.0,Worked great but it’s starting to lose its stickiness.
3.0,I am still trying to figure these out..... one of them unscrew from the back the other from the front makes it a bit difficult to get these in
3.0,The material is scratchy. It hasn’t softened since being washed either.
3.0,"Needed an XL because I'm a 38D. Nice looking but too small,"
3.0,"Giving this three stars instead of four because it's a tad too short to wear with leggings without a long layering tank under it (I'm 5'11&#34;, so shorter ladies may be fine.) It's sold as a tunic, so it should hit at the bottom of the tush or down to the mid thigh. Also, the product shows that the front of the garment has the cross straps, but in person the tag is on the side with the crossed straps, but if you wear it with those straps in back it's even shorter in the back and even less tunic length! Confusing.<br /><br />The quality is decent, especially at this price point. I got it for some extensive upcoming traveling I'll be doing. I'm all about easy go anywhere outfits when on the run every day an this will tie in nicely with my wardrobe of leggings, tunics, skirts, and dresses for the month. I will be pairing this with a long navy or gray tank and some black leggings."
3.0,The cross in front you have extra material by the arms look weird
3.0,The leather part is very thin..feels like it is going to break at any minute..I have tiny wrist so it almost doesn't fit because the metal pieces stop it from getting tighter. I would find something of better quality. but I love the look
3.0,"Way too long for a short girl like me, I returned would have kept if I was 5’11”...."
3.0,Vary good for women or light weights. Not so good for people like me that weigh around 200 lbs.  Good for people around 140-200lbs of muscle.
3.0,"The sizing runs a bit small but the big issue for me was the slit - way too high for an older woman. The fabric was nice, had a cotton feel to it and not a sweaty synthetic. Size up to get a looser fit."
3.0,"Overall, I am not impressed. The stones look fake. The presentation and card that it arrived on looked cheap. It is stamped as being silver, but the coating is odd- not really yellow or rose gold, somewhere in the middle.<br />I would not pay $70 for this."
3.0,Muy bonitos pero no se porque me quemo la oreja 😞 literalmente la oreja se quemó se hizo una herida y no en el agujero. Si no al rededor por la parte donde va la palomita
3.0,way shorter than I expected
3.0,The ring was heavy and the stone was not very colorful.
3.0,Posts seem shorter than most other earrings
3.0,"SUPER stiff and ended up with blisters an hour after wearing them and I have a desk job too. But, you get what you pay for. Going to try and stretch them out some more because aside from being stiff, they are cute and fit."
3.0,"It has lots of room and silver is a great color, but the zippers weren't properly working.  By Emm e."
3.0,"I bought this for Easter, but waist us too large. I used size chart to determine the size . I would have preferred colors to be listed. Yes we know that different screen project different colors. I thought there was ""pink"" but neither of the shades i thought are pink they are both red-orange. Darker is ref-orange the other is red and orange zigzag on white background. I bought 2 fiffrent shaes of pink shirts to wear the shirt in photo is fusia or darker pink and the other shirt was powder pink . Ill just get different color shirt. Am returning the skirt for smaller size"
3.0,"Kind of small, arms are super tight."
3.0,"It's a really pretty top but I wasn't expecting the type of material that it is.  It fits a little small, so I cut the neck out so it would fit a little better."
3.0,"Stop working the 1st day I wore it; however, I can't return it because by the time I pay for shipping to another country I would have paid for the watch.  Will never purchase anything else from them.  My loss and their gain."
3.0,"The description indicated 5 sets - I only received 4 sets, there were no black cats.  And the ""Wizard Hats"" are really cowboy hats. The sets I received are cute but I was planning to wear the black cat earrings so I was disappointed."
3.0,too small...but was still a good laugh
3.0,Fabric and color is nice but the uniform runs a size small.
3.0,The material isn't great and the bottom is pretty wide so it looks a little weird but its fine
3.0,"Not the right style for me :/ I'm 24 years old, weighing 110, and I wear a 32dd bra size. It fits tight around the top half of my boobs but just hangs down from there and kinda makes me look bigger than I am, or atleast that's how I feel. Also I don't really like how the side parts of the lace aren't sewn down. The material feels good and soft, however I haven't washed it yet so I don't know how it holds up. I will give this to my best friend who is a little bigger than me and update with how it fits her"
3.0,DON'T DROP IT! The links will break. Okay watch with standard quartz movement.
3.0,"I ordered this thinking it would be the typical Amazon asian sizing where ""plus sized"" means a US size medium. Unfortunately it really is plus sized and the smallest size is a bit big on me.  I kept it anyway tho."
3.0,Average. Nice detailing
3.0,It's  good gift for kids
3.0,"This is really cute, but it runs BIG. There’s no way the leg warmers will fit my 7 month old. Maybe they’ll fit her next year for Halloween."
3.0,This is ok overall. I was a little underwhelmed at the overall feel of it. It is smaller in length and width than what I was hoping for. It is light weight and does not feel like it will take too much rough contact. It is safely and easily identified as a toy by anyone who sees it. If you are looking for a youngling's prop/ toy then this might land closer to expectations.
3.0,Fits as expected though it is very short. I don't think it would fit well on a person with a bigger butt
3.0,The leg holes are a smidge too tight.
3.0,"This is super cute in person!, but it does run small."
3.0,"They did not fit my feet as expected, to much room left."
3.0,"These have done ok so far but not with all shoes. They do slide down a bit and have come off my heel. If my shoe has a tighter fit at the heel, I haven’t had an issue. Also, with no shoes, around the house, don’t stay for long."
3.0,I thought these would be 100% cotton.  They are not. My husband can wear them though. They are too big for smaller heads but appear to be well made.
3.0,"I keep ordering these but they keep ending up with little chips on the lenses even though I treat them carefully and keep them in a case. I mean, you get what you pay for I guess. I wish I could pay 4 times the amount for 4 times the quality."
3.0,"They are comfy and fit chunky legs however they’re a bit of a hazzle to put on (they have a zipper on the side but you still have to untie it a bit so it zips up) and they don’t maintain their form like you can see on the picture, due to the fact the material is a bit cheap más flimsy."
3.0,They were alright. The traction from the studs was good but unfortunately back fired because the leather had so much give that my momentum would continue past where the traction would stop me. In other words the leather wouldn't keep my foot securely with the base of the shoe. Didn't last for more than 4 or so months of regular use and ended up coming undone and ripping at the seems.
3.0,"Nice, nice quality but I'm a size four and I bought a size up (small) according to the size chart. It's still too small. I think a large will do better."
3.0,I really like the material and tried to base my size fit off the reviews but the shirts seem a little bit bigger and don't give me as much compression as I expected. Am considering returning them and getting a smaller size.
3.0,"The shoes are super cute, but left blisters in multiple locations on my feet. Not at all comfortable."
3.0,"Cute sweater but it looks absolutely nothing like the picture. I was hoping it would be big and baggy like shown but it looks more like a normal-fitting sweater which in turn makes the back look not so dramatic like it is in the picture. I would have been happier if this sweater were like, 3 whole sizes bigger."
3.0,I ordered a large hat but it's still too small.
3.0,"Expected a little better quality. The band adds a nice touch, but not good enough to wear for every day."
3.0,Bought this band for my husband's Charge 2.  He likes that it has ridges inside so that his arm doesn't sweat like with the Fitbit bands which give him a rash. This would be five stars but for the size.  He wears the FItbit large band comfortably but has to wear this on the last hole.which looks kind of silly  It really needs to either come in two sizes or be a bit larger to fit a man's wrist.
3.0,I ordered the 14/16 and was worried it may be too tight ( I wear a 16) but it was actually too loose.  I prefer my clothes to be a little loose but the top on this kept gaping so it was not for me.  The material is a very heavy material and hangs pretty nice but it has kind of a jersey look and feel to it so seems more casual than cocktail/dressy.  I did like the ruched sleeves to cover the flappy arms.  The burgundy  color is very similar to how it was displayed on my monitor.
3.0,"This is a very cute bracelet, but when I got it one of the charms kept falling off. I fixed it by just squeezing the little ring back on the bracelet but I can't wear this out about because I am afraid of losing the charm. So in a way this was kind of a pointless buy but it was very cheap. Probably a good piece for little girls who like to play dress-up."
3.0,"I ordered TWO Small Black and Red gloves, however, I received one of the Black and Red, the other one is Gray in Regular size. I bought this for my wife as a gift. It is too late to return. Disappointed!<br />The product is fine though."
3.0,They only offered L and XL sizes. We went with XL but it fit like a small.
3.0,Cheaply made cheap cheap cheap and folded up into a mess what the hell wants to open up a purse in a box that's been all scrunched together in a little plastic bag what a stupid thing to do to a purse
3.0,"They work, not the TIGHTEST knee highs I’ve ever ordered. Not a cotton knit fabric, they’re more stretchy and remind me of cheap legging material. Also they don’t seem plus size to me, I’m not even plus size I just order cuz I have thicker thighs and I can’t imagine someone heavier than me being able to comfortably wear these."
3.0,I really like this purse.  The color is wonderful. The only issue I have is that the inside of the purse has an odor.  I have had to leave it open to air it out.
3.0,"Made cheap, but they are still intact and ready for next year if needed"
3.0,"I've ordered this shoe twice for my toddler.  The first time I ordered her size as the listing said sizing was ""true to size"".  Second time I ordered 2 sizes above and she can barely squeeze into them.  Clearly a sizing issue with the manufacturer."
3.0,The locket is a good value for it's price.  It is definitely something a child would enjoy but the quality is not that of nicer jewelry.  I gave it to my 4 year old granddaughter with pictures in it and she was thrilled.  The nice thing about this locket is that the size is actually large enough to put a picture in it and be able to see it.
3.0,They're beautiful however the gems on the angelwing fell out and the demon wing tarnished quickly. Loved it for the short time having it.
3.0,I love this but it came apart after a couple months
3.0,"Material seems a bit flimsy, but for the price it is perfect.  Fit is actually great, fits to size."
3.0,"The pearls are of course odd shapes because they are fresh water, but they are a nice size.  The only problem is, they are NOT studs no matter what the description says.  So nice earrings, but not studs, sorry."
3.0,"Bottoms are great but the top is weird. No support and runs larger than what I expected. I’m a 38DDD and ordered the 2x and the top was big, but bottoms were perfect. I wear a 16/18 pant."
3.0,"This is a nice heavy piece more suited for a larger wrist. I bought it for a woman's FitBit2 and it is great for the device but a little too heavy and large for the size 7 wrist.  There is plenty of length, but no way to take it off as you would from link bands, so there is a lot of overlap under the clasp and that makes it a little uncomfortable to wear. I would totally recommend for larger wrists. The band itself is pretty nice for the price and adds a little formality to your FitBit2. So if you have a larger wrist and are looking to jazz your smartwatch up a bit, go for it!"
3.0,The shirt is very cute. But it runs small. I ordered it in an XL which is my size. But it is a little tight in the tummy area but everywhere else it fits.
3.0,This was a cute mask but after wearing it a couple of times it’s stretch so much I had to get rid of it.
3.0,"it's lightweight and more or less comfy, however it it too short. Hits at top of my hips. Looks more like a long shirt, then a dress on me. I'm 5'4&#34; and sized up and it was still too short."
3.0,"I followed the size chart, and the bottom fit really well. The material feels good and sturdy, however there were a lot of loose threads. The top unzips on the side, but even though it does, the top would not fit over my boobs! Even the next size up would be way too small for my 36Gs. If you have big boobs, this is not the outfit for you. I'll be returning this."
3.0,"The beads are too large, and it’s kind of heavy."
3.0,"I really like these pants, but it turns out that all the pockets are broken and there are always threads hanging, I really think they are not well sewn."
3.0,Not a fan.  Cheaply made.  Fit funny.
3.0,"The dress is so cute but unfortunately I can’t wear it because it’s to small. It’s not for people with a chest. I’m a DD and no way would it fit. I tried putting a t shirt under it but the chest area didn’t lay right it kinda flapped out and under the arms were super tight. I would say if I lost 15 lbs I could wear it. The material is soft and not see through. It’s such a pretty dress I wish they had it in a larger size, I got a medium."
3.0,Either women’s or child’s watch - didn’t see it in description. Very small watch
3.0,"i like how long it is, but the whole shirt is stretchy besides the lace at the waist, where i needed it to be more stretchy. it also kind of rides up."
3.0,They're nice shorts that are soft and fit very well but they're not anything special and for $25+ the quality is not very good.
3.0,"The goggles are great at keeping water out, but one of the lenses popped out. I was able to get it back in, but wished it wouldn't have happened."
3.0,it ripped after I washed it ( I hung it dry!)
3.0,I am 5 &#34;2 and 110 pounds and it was just too big on me. The quality and dress itself is nice. I would not recommend it for petite girls.
3.0,Glad I got the 2x could be larger I weigh 145
3.0,"Loved the shirt, but there is a band around the bottom that is not shown in pic.  Also it began to ""Pill"" after  second wash."
3.0,"I ordered three different dresses of this style from two companies, in three colors.  Based upon sizing suggestions and recommendations from others, I ordered size Medium for all three dresses.  The material is very stretchy.  I was looking for something dressy for a formal evening event, but this didn't feel or look classy.  On my 4'11"" 122lb frame, this dress hit me mid-knee.  The cold shoulder straps were two sizes too large and flopped around and looked silly.  Also, the zipper was sewn so close to the edge of the fabric that it had to be carefully eased up and down.  I am returning this in favor of one of the other dresses."
3.0,"This is a beautiful swimsuit, quality is good, even comes with extra padding for the top ;)....only thing is next time i will order a size up."
3.0,Product concept is interesting. Essentially attaches to your head and presses against your head to flatten the hair on your sides. The instructions suggest leaving it on for 10 minutes. I do notice a mild difference in the poofiness of my hair on the sides but don't expect anything too magical. Product seems way overpriced for what it is but somewhat understandable as it seems to be an import product. You could probably get similar/better results using a headband but it would lack the cut outs for your ears and extended part for your sideburns. Wouldn't recommend the product to everyone but worth a try for those who are frustrated with the spikiness of their under hair. One noteworthy thing is that since the material is perforated it is possible to blow dry it to heat it up which helps more with keeping the hair underneath flat.
3.0,Hard to put on. Decent quality
3.0,"Tan/beige color is much light than depicted. The pictures also make it look more ""washed out"" than it is. It's just an oversized, brand new t-shirt with a skeleton stencil. If you have a cricut, you can make it yourself. Maybe even make it better."
3.0,I love this bracelet and my bf is really into nautical stuff but the strands of braid holding the nautical charms is really thin .
3.0,Not very comfortable. The bottom of the heart kind of hurts.<br />But they're very cute.
3.0,"Came with a little rust stain right dab in the middle of them, I geuss you get what you pay for. love them for the price other than that! :)"
3.0,Thin material but great for summer.
3.0,"The material isn't great. The seams rip very easily, anytime I sat or stretched I'd hear a small ripping sound coming somewhere. Sizing is definitely a little off. Also the gloves are paper - ripped without effort. Too bad because other than that the costume could have been amazing!"
3.0,"This is a VERY VERY nice dress! However, should you have anything remotely close to larger breats (D cup here).  This may not be a good idea for you.  Another reviewer mentioned that and I should have listened! I am not used to having problems with my breast, my issue is always my butt & hips.  Beyond that, this dress is AMAZING!!<br /><br />Unfortunately, it wont work for me 😩"
3.0,The feel is good but too small
3.0,Nice lounge around the house top. a little disappointed because I had purchased it work.
3.0,"I think this is a cute dress, I like the green background with its polka dot print and its ruffled shoulder straps and ruffled trim; however, the dress just doesn't fit right. The straps are adjustable, which I like, but what I don't like is how the straps dig into me and just don't feel comfortable. Additionally, there's a little too much material gathered below the chest line which is not flattering to my body. The top part is gathered all the way around and it has strings in the front that tie to add a stylish touch. It fits true to size."
3.0,"The curved pin doesn't really work for my ear, but the earrings are really beautiful...now to find someone to regift them to."
3.0,Did not rec'd the correct item.
3.0,good fit and great price
3.0,"Good little FASHIONABLE wallet if you like the money clip feature on a wallet and don't have more than 4-or 5 gas/and credit cards ! Otherwise you will need a pair of pliers to get your cards out of the wallet once you stuff them in. For me its fine, its small, keeps the few cards i have tight and secure, and all in all a nice little wallet !"
3.0,I bought this for my teen son. The mask arrived quite bent. It took several applications of heat (heat gun or hair dryer) and careful bending and cooling to get it back to the correct shape. The mask tended to revert to the previous shape after a day or two. The edges were sharp and took a bit of scraping and sanding.
3.0,i really like the style but way too big please a smaller size
3.0,Is A little nugget of a fit even thought I ordered up a size but still enjoy the product.
3.0,"nice product. but you can tell it was really cheap, but overall it was nice and the watch runs small i have a big husband lol<br />but its koo, but will not last long"
3.0,The pics make them look very multi-colored. But they’re actually closer to two tone: bright neon green and even brighter neon purple. I didn’t realize how purple they would be. They were too purple for me!
3.0,"The sides of this dress go up higher than the knee so while it was long enough in the front and the back, it was too short on the sides for me."
3.0,"I bought this wallet a few months ago and have given it quite the test run.  I love the design and simplicity but it definitely falls short in some unexpected areas.<br /><br />I don't typically keep cash in my wallet (c'mon, it's 2018!) but rather 2 or 3 cards for various accounts, insurance cards, my license, and maybe that random gift card with $1.65 on it that is probably expired.  The first issue I noticed with the wallet is that when I open it, things tend to slide around inside from one pocket across to the other, causing me to adjust them so I can close it again.  I also tried using the ""hidden"" pockets on the edges of the wallet however that proceed even more troublesome.  On more than one instance I took my wallet out and cards dropped right out from there.  What's even more strange is that I have one particular pair of shorts in which this wallet always seems to slip out of my pocket and onto whatever seat I am on.<br /><br />With all that being said, it does have some redeeming qualities. First, I got the pizza design because I very much enjoy pizza. The graphic has remained on the material much better than I had anticipated.  It's definitely faded a bit, especially in some natural creases caused by the contents, but it's still extremely legible and fairly colorfully.  I believe the price vs the product is spot on here, and even in the most worn corners of my wallet there is no sign of tearing or fraying.<br /><br />It's a durable, slim wallet with a fun design.  It's just a bit slippery!"
3.0,"Bought exactly the same dress in navy color 2 years ago, it was great. Now it started to become transparent on the shoulders, so I decided to buy the same one. Unfortunately, the new one is of much poorer quality: very thin fabric that looks constantly crumpled. But the dress still feels nice."
3.0,Clingy and too tight around the chest and stomach.....to be fair I’m an ‘apple shape’.
3.0,I bought one with a checks . I like the material and the texture of the blazer. it fits perfect to my body however i feel it is short height wise. good in this price.
3.0,I would give this a four or five if the length of the shirt didn’t feel like I have to tug  it down all the time.  If you are long in the torso this may not be for you.
3.0,Nice stretching fabric but not loose at all. Definitely snug fitting. I liked the length too
3.0,Buena calidad y luce como en la foto pero corre pequeña. Al final la regalé.
3.0,I wanted to love this dress but I just dont. I wear a 10/12 and ordered a M and it fits perfectly. I think the top fabric comes down too low and so it looks weird on. The fabric is not soft and is also very sheer.
3.0,Most earrings had a part that was unglued and coming off
3.0,"these are definitely comfortable and more for lounging, not working out. Did one work out and the inside ripped during a lunge. I would for sure test these out at home before going to a packed gym."
3.0,Very pretty but runs really small
3.0,"Really just looked like a moo moo.  Would be cute as a maternity dress.  But, otherwise, just too big.  I do understand that's the look here, but it doesn't pull it off, like an easy breezy summer dress should."
3.0,Jury is out on this what.  Still evaluating
3.0,Defiantly works as a under shirt. it is very sheer.
3.0,"would have given the shoes 5 stars because they are so cute, however the sizing of this shoe was off.<br />When ordering be careful. What was odd, is that I ordered what I needed, 11 1/2 to 12, but received a 11. This size was too small having to return the item. The sizing in this shoe does not use American,, but Korean and EU."
3.0,This was cute except for the fact I ordered a brown and black one and received a blue one. Will most likely return and try again. Hopefully I’ll get the right one.
3.0,cute-ish. scarf is very thin and the pendant is very thin too - not sure how it will hold up.
3.0,Runs really small I wear a med but I needed a XL
3.0,"The material is not that comfortable, a little bit hard"
3.0,Runs small and a little short
3.0,"I own this dress in other colors purchased from another Amazon seller. The orange one I purchased here is cut a size smaller and the fabric is much silkier. The light blue one is the same fabric as the others but cut so short that my behind would show if I wore this. 2 dresses from same seller. 2 completely different fits and material. Both going back. I am 5'6"" 132 & wear a size 4 normally. Small fit from other sellers. Way too small here."
3.0,Bracelet broke as soon as I wore it
3.0,"It's cute, not crazy about the material, I was expecting it to be denim. I will keep."
3.0,"The glasses look great, feel great, but for the life of me I would swear they are not glass, nothing indicates glass anywhere but in the sales info, nothing in the literature with the glasses, they are lightweight like plastic lenses."
3.0,The shorts were a little too small
3.0,"It is beautiful. It is a large statement piece. However, it is on the smallish side. I wish I had gotten the next size up. It is not true-to--size, which seems to be necessary with such a wide ring."
3.0,The picture makes the bracelet look more attractive than the actual product... Not sure How I feel about his item.  Its OK but I am slightly disappointed.
3.0,"Comfortable and soft, similar to others like it.  The angled logo on the one I received, along with some of the stitching, is crooked and looks odd.  For the price, it's not worth returning.  I'm sure this will get some use though."
3.0,"The chain was cheaply made and tarnished, but I liked the charm.  Cute!"
3.0,It's ok for short term wear
3.0,Runs a little big up top. Adorable dress
3.0,Loved the dress but it runs too large. I wear a size medium and ordered this dress in that size but it’s more like a large/ extra large. Had to return. They were out of size small.
3.0,Face is small for a men's watch.  I bought it so I could see the face while running sans glasses.  Unfortunately the face is too small for me to read without my glasses so not a good watch for my purposes.  Easy to use buttons and it is solar which is a positive.
3.0,It’s very soft. Love that it’s black and I plan to use it in the hospital next month after I give birth. However it’s covered in white marks. It almost looks like it’s discoloration from an iron. I literally just pulled it out of the package and haven’t even washed it yet. Hopefully the white marks come out in the washer
3.0,"It is stretched material, so I ordered a size up which was too big...no support for the boobs"
3.0,"Same size, I wear in this band .. just didn’t fit tight enough around waist. My other size M. Don’t slid/slip down"
3.0,"I would have given it a 5, but wearing anything gauze, the mesh on the band catches"
3.0,"Love my bracelet, but it is very quick to tarnish."
3.0,"I love how simple these are. On and off are a breeze. However, it constantly loosens up. I can’t keep a snug fit."
3.0,Took for ever to ship it looks as shown but I had a few scratch which bother me since it's a gift...other then that it's as shown
3.0,"Glasses arrived promptly, packaging was very good.  Glasses are stylish ​and appear to be well made, however, I find that the lenses are not quite clear and when I move my head quickly I feel a bit of dizziness."
3.0,Was meant for my husband. Bought the biggest size they had and still didn’t fit. The material is a bit cheap. Also didn’t receive on time.
3.0,"The middle divider doesn't stay standing so it's sometimes confusing trying to find items. I'm still trying to get used to it. Now, one of the gromets that pleat the corners came off and was lost, so I have a gap. I'm trying to find a replacement but not having any luck right now. I've only had the purse for 2 months."
3.0,"yes fits as expected but the product that i get is not the same shown in the picture ,but it is not bad though ,i can not say i loved it but i will be using it when winter come .<br /><br />thats all i have to say about that ."
3.0,"This lenses get scratched easily. You need to handle with a lot of care. During the use, you feel like they are sucking out your eyes.. weird sensation"
3.0,Smaller than expected.  It tore when I first wore it.  However the pockets are nice and large enough to carry a large &#34;smart phone/wallet&#34;.
3.0,Wish it was longer so you could loop it.
3.0,Waist fits great - legs are a bit long and def very wide.
3.0,"Looks nice and decent quality; however, the functionality isn't working for us."
3.0,They were nice initially but already falling apart after wearing them a handful of times.  It's too long and a bit snug but not too uncomfortable.
3.0,"I was so excited for these!  They're obviously super cute.  Unfortunately, they're a bit too snug.  I got the largest size based on other reviews that said they are bigger than an 8 (I wear an 8.5).  It's true that the bottom of them says L (9/10), unfortunately, they are true to the size that they are labeled as on here. Hoping they'll stretch out a little, but might just return, as one of the bunny tails is already hanging off, right out of the packaging."
3.0,Thin can be used for couple of days only
3.0,"Order a size up, the overall length is shorter compared to regular tank tops"
3.0,"The quality of this is nice however, the mesh at the top comes too low on their chest. I love this leo but because of this I rarely wear it on my daughter."
3.0,"Product is okay, very long and difficult to get on. Goes over my knee. Size 10.5 shoe and 5'8"" in height. The biggest problem is after 1-2 days of use one sock started to unwind."
3.0,"I think this shirt is hilarious!  The graphic is pretty with the snark comment subtly placed at the bottom. The fabric was soft and the green color was very pretty.  I returned the shirt, however, because it was very small.  I would say it runs about one size smaller than as labeled.  I was looking for a shirt to wear with leggings and this tee barely came to my waist and was snug compared to many other tees I have in the same size."
3.0,"There is no extra fabric layer where the zipper is added for the pocket. It has simply a line of stitching across the full width of the scarf. Also, I asked the seller about the color before delivery, and he insisted it is Navy. It is most definitely Green, leaning towards Teal perhaps but not blue by any stretch of the imagination, although that is what the label says. It is a good length, 32"" (74"" circle) by 13"" and there's no fabric or care tag. I think it is acrylic or polyester, and smells that way. I shall wash in cold water tonight and I'm pretty sure it will be OK for light use."
3.0,Very small space in between front and earring back. Almost squishes the ear too much
3.0,"It is very small. It also came without any tags attached so i thought it probably was used before. And I didn't find any rain protection cover in it. So I bought a different brand 60 L and it is much bigger, definitely new and with cover for rain."
3.0,Cute and functions. Pretty cheaply made. Pin fell off chain the first time it was used (not from rough play).
3.0,"I bought this shirt to hide my postpartum midriff issues (diastasis recti). It definitely works for that, but it fit sort of awkwardly. The tail in back was much longer than it needed to be, and the &#34;pouf&#34; in front was poufier than expected. However, to cover up a funky postpartum body, this shirt works GREAT. And can be easily modified (I cut off the bottom), because there's quite a bit of extra fabric."
3.0,Front clasp all scratched up
3.0,"These are really pretty. However, the section that goes through the ear is extremely thick. Unless your pierced ear holes are stretched out, they will be very uncomfortable.  They are not working for me.  I will give them away to some one that does have stretched out pieces because at less than $2. cost they are not worth returning.  Bummer. I really like them."
3.0,So.
3.0,Material was little cheap looking - slinky.  Won’t buy again.
3.0,"Very pretty, but not as solid once assembled as I would have liked (had to tape them together at the back in order to get the right shape."
3.0,"Nice design, seems to slide a little ""too"" easy on the buckle."
3.0,Watch does not shine like picture on line
3.0,This is a good product but my order of 10 holders only came with 8 clips.
3.0,These are NOT shatter resistant.  If they come off the band included and hit the floor the explode.  Company is not responsible. Should get a different band apparently than the one they send.
3.0,"Cute and comfortable but like another customer said, for the set they are expensive. A search on Amazon gives you some lowered price sets.<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LWBN27O?psc=1<br />4 pieces for $8.00<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MDJ957M?psc=1<br />6 pieces for $10.00<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/HENGSONG-Necklaces-Stretch-Elastic-Pendant/dp/B01N8Q9H6Q<br />6 pieces for $4.00 [Isn't supported by Amazon prime though]"
3.0,falls apart ... poor quality
3.0,Its okay. One of the eyes popped out as soon as we took it out of the box. Had to super glue it back in.
3.0,The quality of the item was not as expected.  I though it would be a bt thicker to handle the winter months.  It's more of a sweatshirt for the fall.
3.0,"However, please be aware that it does NOT hold a 13x9 laptop, though it is very nice and high quality. I had to return it after I realized that my laptop would not fit."
3.0,"Love the watch. The band isn't sturdy, it broke right away."
3.0,They have little specs in the lense and they slide down all the time. IF they were tighter and the lense were fine they would be perfect.
3.0,It’s a very nice fitting dress<br />I’m usually a size small but I order medium so things will fit me a bit more modestly. This dress is so flattering I’m 5’4 and the dress was above the middle of my knee which isn’t the look I was going for. But it’s a bueayoful dress if you’re looking for a knee length/ above knee length dress this is the dress for you
3.0,"They're good. The wood is lighter than the picture leads on, but for $30 its not a bad buy. Wish it was $20 though."
3.0,Not what I was expecting. Quality is okay just didn’t like the colors
3.0,"They are comfy, but definitely not compression. Works for what I needed it for tho."
3.0,"I like the idea but it’s tight if your wrist is big. Very Uncomfortable. After a few days of dealing with it, I have decided to order something else."
3.0,"I originally bought this for an adult man in size medium but the fit is too small. It's more like a female medium. The material is thin. I can see through the back. For a novelty item, I knew what I was getting so I was not disappointed. Do know that it's not a licensed product and that the logo is just a print, not embroidered."
3.0,Love the watch...but band is too short.
3.0,This pattern is special and easy to recognize.  But the quality is really average.
3.0,A little stiff. Not as comfy as the other La Isla I bought.
3.0,"They were cheap, but not particularly comfortable. There is a rod that didn't get completely sewn into the earmuffs that rubs at my ears."
3.0,Kind of smaller than I thought. Material is nice though.
3.0,"This was bought as a Christmas Gift, I will not know the rating until then.  The color online looked just the item in the package that is a plus."
3.0,Smaller then expected very hard to put on
3.0,"I had to return these, they were way too small for my face."
3.0,Very nice looking and light weight. It is quite big and I have very small wrists. Going to have to take it to have at least five links removed.
3.0,Hilarious that it came from<br />China. Other than that- it's very small. Fits like an exercise tank.
3.0,"very cute, but has a tendency to break. if you are very careful, it shouldn't break for the most part. ive had some butterflies come off due to not having strong enough glue, and i had to superglue it back together, which works but is a hassle."
3.0,Very cute but is a bit snug.
3.0,will have to get them altered to actually be skinny
3.0,These are very narrow and as much as I wanted to keep them they hurt my feet!  They are a great color and were exactly what I was looking for but they are a little too pointed at the rounded toe so it hurt my feet.
3.0,"I was very satisfied with the band and it's quality.  It's very soft and shows wear easily.  Still I liked it until the band started to split down the middle  I was a bit disappointed to say the least and I now have a replacement.  If it splits again, I'll reevaluate my score"
3.0,I was supposed to receive a red Santa skirt. But I got a snowman skirt- which isn’t even an option for the listing. A little disappointed because it is not as Christmas-y. I’m normally a M and ordered a small since it sits at your natural waist. I almost wish there was an XS because this is kind of big! Material is very stretchy
3.0,the glass part is wonderful.. very clear... but the angle of the ear piece is kinda tight & if your head is very wide it presses into the area behind your ears... altho 1 pair out of the several I purchased was wider & I love that pair...
3.0,The picture of the dress was not what I got . I expected the dress to be long but what I got was long in the back and short in the front.  I need a summer dress for this week coming up so I kept it because it was still cute and it fits good . I have a small chest it fit just right and I have big hips but it fit just right .
3.0,"Not a close fit, kinda clumsy, but pretty design."
3.0,"Just like the pix, fit well.  However, got delivered late so we did not get to use them for the costume party.  Bummer"
3.0,"Im usually XL and got XL. It did fit me however it just didn’t look right. I’d say size up if you can, it’ll fit better for sure"
3.0,It's too light and not long enough
3.0,Soft fabric but clingy and very sheer. Empire waist fell oddly on me. Not flattering to my upper body. Returned.
3.0,Its very long.im only 5'2 so i expected it to be slightly past the knee. The material is good.
3.0,The extra large runs small.  I will advice getting one size up than your normal size. Material very rich and beautiful!
3.0,One clip had the spring fall out of it within 2 days of using it for my keys. But I am still using the second clamp with no issues a month later.
3.0,This dress was super cute and fit perfectly but the skirt I thought was supposed to be black but it was more of a dark blueish black.  It is just my preference that I don't like that so I sent it back.
3.0,"The metal shaping the heart is dingy, almost making the charm look a little dirty.  But this was the cheapest charm I could find, so I guess I'm OK with it."
3.0,The  rose gold plating wears off fast
3.0,There about the size of a small pick-up truck.<br />I will never use it. not sure why so large LOL<br />didn't bother returning it. nice look sock tho :-)
3.0,"She was in absolute love with it when I put it on her.  The quality is good, buckle is strong.  Rating 3 stars because the chains are not silver, they are coated in black.  I don't like being deceived by the picture."
3.0,I love the actual material they are made of- it’s just that they were a bit snug on my hips. They are comfortable and so easy to move around in. But if you have a booty or larger hips order a size up!
3.0,"Too small,but very pretty. Really disappointed because it lis a lovely dress."
3.0,First Iam not happy it was all wrinkled I could tell it was returned then I found a tear on the side  . Iam going to keep this time since I wont wear it until summer . this item should have never put back  to be purchased again.
3.0,It's nice and good price too but it's could easily break
3.0,It’s a decent dress but fits sort of weird in the chest and arm area
3.0,This was a little to tiny overall on me. I was looking for more coverage in the legs and it was a bit short.
3.0,It’s a great concept and the backpack is good quality but the leash broke within a few days. My daughter just carries it around with snacks.
3.0,"We bought 2 pairs of these in 2 different colors for our 2 boys. On one pair, one of the elastic laces pulled out of the piece at the end that keeps the two laces together. It happened within the 1st week of getting them so I had to tie a knot at the end of the lace that pulled out, to keep the piece that holds them tight from slipping off. Other than that....they have seemed great. We probably won't buy them again though...for that reason."
3.0,I like it - but not sure why i got 2 sets instead  of one . It is plastic  but very nice looking
3.0,I wear 9.5 - 10 women's shoe and they were snug and short in the toes.
3.0,"I like these workout pants... but I've had to downgrade my review because the stitching is coming apart. I've not excessively washed them and they've not had extensive wear.  But the stitching is inferior and I suspect that they'll last only another week or so before I can't wear them.  Too bad, as I really liked the zipper pockets, style, and material."
3.0,"A beautiful dress, high in quality. It looks as it appears online, but runs a bit small in the chest. Prepare for the chest seaming to not fit exactly where intended if you are more than a B cup."
3.0,"I liked this way better on the site because I forgot it is in women’s & I still have a child’s body.. took it out the package and it fit too big! Both the top and bottom are loose although i went with the sizing I thought i would be okay, but I have smaller boobs and butt. If it were and XS i believe it would be perfect but unfortunately they don’t have this in that size for women’s. It also didn’t come with a sticker to return my package so I either have to get my mom to alter it or give it away:("
3.0,Son pequeños y los tirantes cortos
3.0,On the smaller  side but will work for what I  got it for
3.0,"I purchased the white double tour wrap band.  Okay, the good first!  This is nice quality band, would look very nice if I could actually wear it.  The quality seems good for the price.  Now for the bad, I have a 6.5&#34; wrist.  After reading the &#34;answered questions&#34; I don't think the answer applies to the double wrap bands, but probably to the normal watch bands.  This will not fit an 8&#34; wrist.  I could not even get this fastened with a 6.5&#34; wrist.  So writing this review to possible help others trying to decide if it will fit.  In the normal Apple bands, I can wear the s/m on the last 1 or 2 holes, but prefer the m/l where I can wear it the 3rd hole very comfortably with 4 holes left to expand if I want to.  That's for size reference for potential buyers, as that's what I look for in reviews if I am uncertain that something will fit.  Hope this helps!  :-)"
3.0,"Love the print, but the leggings themselves are kinda crap. The waistband is not taught at all and there's no elastic to hold them up. Great for sitting in, but if you plan to walk they will slide off of you."
3.0,Overall seems like a good jacket. Fits nicely with room to layer. The only thing I don’t really care for but don’t mind is the zippers on the pockets. They are a bit scratchy when you slide an ungloved hand in. And one sleeve is slightly longer than the other. I will be back with an overview of how warm it is. It’s not alternative down. It’s just regular polyester filling. Like a cheap pillow. Seems good so far.
3.0,"Not so good, chemical fiber"
3.0,Was sall in lenght
3.0,"So, I was looking for loose, wide cropped pants. These were close— fit weirdly, so that there was a great deal of excess fabric around the tummy— and the fabric was a bit itchy and quite thin. Not deemed worth my $40 and I sent them back."
3.0,Not like the description. Not a relaxed feel.
3.0,I didn’t like the material. The inside of the sleeve is visible.
3.0,Sound muffled
3.0,Sure looks a lot cuter on the skinny model
3.0,Have to have it hymed up
3.0,Please order 2 sizes larger than your size for a good fit.
3.0,"This would have been a nice accessory, but I have a little larger wrist and it did not fit."
3.0,"It wasnt vompletely sewn so I  had to take it to a tailor, so it cost me another $15."
3.0,"These earrings are much smaller than I thought.  The picture is very deceiving.  I was very disappointed when I saw them.  I kept them, but do not love them."
3.0,"Yes, just ok. Lace is a little tight. But get what you pay for."
3.0,Wonderful skirt it was just too short for me
3.0,Almost too small to even see what it is.
3.0,These earrings wrre not what I expected.  They are huge.
3.0,It is a lot thinner than I expected. The collar doesn't buddle up like it shows in photos. The photo listed shows the strings coming from the side assymetrical. It's a regular hoodie. Nothing assymetrical about it. The style is basic.
3.0,Cute dress. Material is coarse though
3.0,It's a nice jackets but the large was too small even though the size charts measurements for a large should have fit perfectly it was tight in the arms and upper back area.
3.0,Sent back!
3.0,"The dress is beautiful - causal but can be dressed up. It runs big and the fabric is a bit see through, but looks great with a little slip underneath. Mine came with a small red/pink spot on the lace - hoping it washes out, but it's not too noticeable."
3.0,"I am as curvy as the model, didnt fit the same. It keeps riding up when i walk."
3.0,Nice you don’t have to worry about dropping your msk
3.0,Nice for the price. The gold is a very bright gold color.
3.0,"This tank is cute and will be fine for wearing under a cardigan, blazer or kimono. But the white color is see through and I wouldn't wear it on its own. I also had ordered it in the blue and it was kind of a dull color, same with the rose. I missed the return window, otherwise I would be returning the white as I was hoping to be able to wear it on its own."
3.0,"Not what I expected. “Wrinkle resistant” Until washed the first time. The shirt was larger than I expected. A loose fit is not a bad thing, but I trimmed six inches off the bottom of the shirt and it still is long."
3.0,The print is really small...you have to be almost on top of me in order to read it.
3.0,The strap comes off easily and my son lost it after a couple of weeks.
3.0,not loving it at all
3.0,Arrived broken. Had to take glue gun to it before even trying it on. Arrived in pieces. Don't think something new should need repairs before first wear.
3.0,Socks are really cute but way too small. Unfortunately my daughter could not wear them.
3.0,"Although these are pretty, These break very easy. One of ours broke the very first time it was warm. They do send extra string, but we could not get the knot to stay in the string. We tried everything and ended up having to use super glue. We are dispointed. Also these are more of a glass bead instead of a rubber bead, so it makes them slightly heavier."
3.0,The fit was fine until I washed them.  They shrank in a cold hand wash.  They are somewhat thin.  I don't expect them to last long.
3.0,Would recommend it to s friend !!
3.0,Is ok price
3.0,Three is no sticky back on the foam. I was going to return it but too much of hassle . It makes it impossible to use unless using glue to keep in place. To return I have to take to far and i dont want to spend the amount I would get from return on transport to ups. It would be nice though if u were to send something complementary to show good faith.
3.0,The picture had different brooches. The ones I received were all the same. It was disappointing because I wanted them all to be different. They were nice sized brooches. I just wish I would have gotten what I ordered. Other than that very pretty
3.0,"Overall great design, great size, we’ll made. Carried daily since purchased. Almost lost one of the scales because a screw fell out. I contacted Mecarmy direct and they are sending me 2 replacement screws.  Warning to new buyers, use loctite to secure screws. I look forward to using again. I do recommend"
3.0,"I really like this blouse and I received it on time. The only issue I had is that I normally wear a Large top size. I ordered an extra large figuring, I rather be safe than sorry and it was still too small. I made it work because I had no other choice."
3.0,The clasp is very inconvenient now and it isn't smooth it scratches me. I ordered the silver one and the clasp is more fluid compared to this clasp that stays at a 90 degree angle.
3.0,I really like the feel and stretch of the short but it fits more like a medium than an XL.
3.0,No V on the lenses or ear piece. Does not say made in France.
3.0,The boots broke on the second wear. My grandson cried when I said I would send them back so I kept them and he wears them broken.
3.0,"Love the bangle, but I don't take off my jewelry much and the black outline has pretty much come off from around the elephants and hearts. So if your like me I would take it off when bathing. Hopefully yours will last longer."
3.0,"The underwear is ... ok...<br />They were a lil’ too loose in the thighs and definitely longer In the thighs than anticipated.<br />Perhaps my fault, but there is only one pocket and I was expecting two.<br />Other than that... they are ok."
3.0,too bad they sent me an XL instead of a M.  Otherwise I'd have given it 4 stars.  The only problem with the jacket is that the pockets are too small and there was a gap in one pocket that didn't get sewn properly.
3.0,"I am only giving you 3 stars because this package is over a week late and the delivery person put it in the wrong mail box today. Also not happy at all with lack of tracking information. The product is as advertised, fits correctly Colors are beautiful."
3.0,"Lenses fit perfectly however, they are much thinner then the original lenses."
3.0,Nice but this took months to arrive. I had actually given up.
3.0,A bit cheap looking but not to bad for the money..The string necklace doesnt tie well thats the only issue ive had.
3.0,It's ok for the price. Do not expect too much.
3.0,"It is a cute shirt with a fun saying on it, however, the actual quality of the shirt is not great.  It looks like someone basically used a Cricut machine to paste on the letters - more homemade than high quality.  I don't think it will stand up to much washing.  The sizing is generous."
3.0,The only thing I disliked is how the
3.0,"They’re ok, but chlorinated pool water will destroy the tint."
3.0,"These women's socks are too small for my size 7 feet.  They do stretch to cover my feet, making them a more open mesh but they are too tight (for my preferences) on my toes.  Nice socks but don't have the silicon ribbing I have come to love on the inside of the heel to keep them from slipping into my shoe.  Just an okay sock but definitely too small for  my comfort."
3.0,"Product looks just like advertising image, but not true to size. Better to go a size up."
3.0,"I was looking for a very large case for beauty products, prescriptions, etc.. I'm going in for a short stay in a Skilled Nursing facility and wanted something attractive and large... this almost did the trick, but I found the bags with the top that fold all the way down to the bottom are very awkward, they want to tip over and I needed something much more sturdy, ended up buying a train case style and am very pleased with it, fortunately this was easily returnable."
3.0,"This item was beautiful, but it was a very small XL...so return it."
3.0,"The bathing suit that arrived isn’t quite the same as the product photo, as a result the funny 3D effect is lacking. My son isn’t picky so we’re probably keeping it seems like decent quality and will last a couple summers."
3.0,"This was the one I have looked for since I sadly passed on one in San Francisco, the authentic red silk lined wool hat I wanted. I tried to measure my head correctly, even measured three times, and made my order. Waiting was tough but I was so sure. Then it arrived; I opened the box and tried it on! It sank over my ears and I gasped. I looked at the label and SOB, they sent the WRONG size! I would normally just return it for the next size down, but it was SO large on my head I’ve decided to wait until I can get an accurate hat size before reordering. Anyway, the hat was exactly what I wanted, just not the right size - by a long shot."
3.0,I didn't expect a well built sunglass but these were beyond cheaply made ... only needed for a couple days & broke the 1st day .
3.0,"Wish I would of sized up, otherwise I like it really well"
3.0,Runs a little smaller and now after having them for a few months they’re starting to unravel
3.0,Cute but Material too thin.
3.0,"The arms were too tight for me and overall the fit was tight compared to the fit chart on the listing. The jacket itself wasn’t bad, just not what I was expecting"
3.0,Perfectly adequate and inexpensive. Definitely house slippers and not good for walking any more than up and down the stairs or from room to room. Length is fine. Width is way too large. I don't expect them to last more than one season.
3.0,"Very cute dress, but runs too short. Had to return."
3.0,"This hat fit my two year old but the brim is very small so it didn’t shade her eyes like I wanted. Cute print and nicely made, though."
3.0,"Smaller than expected. The arms are short, an the draw strings start to unravel after the first wash. I still wear it around the house, because its cozy, but even though I ordered an XL (and I'm a size M), the arms were still short."
3.0,I read the reviews and ordered a size up just to be safe! Still a little too small on me. But it is very cute and seems very well made! Ill<br />Probably give away as a present!
3.0,It’s Ohk
3.0,Nice but would not order again.
3.0,Not as pretty as picture but OK.
3.0,The jewelry didn’t slide into the needle either it was too big!! If you do buy…get a friend to help TRUST ME<br /><br />Soooo it’s definitely NOT a good idea to do it yourself to begin with and that’s coming from a girl who pierced everything herself….sadly my skin was too tough to pierce AND get the jewelry in.
3.0,"I am 5'9"" 190lbs 36/38B with an athletic build.  I have this in the black floral design in the XL.  The cut is alright but the bust is not cut correctly.  This dress basically mashes my girls in and the ^^ cut of the dress feels like it is in an incorrect placement, almost like it's backwards (I did double check the tag).<br /><br />The material is light weight and even black it is a bit sheer in direct light, so wear correct undergarments!  The length and hemline are good for my height / leg length but wouldn't be for my sister that is 5'1.  Overall, this isn't terrible but I I don't want to feel like my boobs are being banded all day long."
3.0,The top stitching forms Mickey Mouse ears hanging floppy to each side.  It’s an unusual shape.
3.0,This is a little large and not very flattering.
3.0,Well made weird shape
3.0,very heavy head piece. uncomfortable to wear. this is a greatly made head band though and it is gorgeous.
3.0,"This is overall so soft and perfect, I’ve been looking for a set that feels like this but is also flattering for so long.<br /><br />However; before I even put it on the string was starting to come undone so I’m a little scared the whole thing will unravel / not last despite being 80% cotton - I’ll update here after wearing it a couple times.<br /><br />Sizing wise I’m 5’5” & 127 lbs & I’m normally a small-medium but I bought a large for a more relaxed fit like in the photo and it’s perfect (I expect some shrinkage when I wash it, also worried about that but will see!)."
3.0,No me gustan las lineas k tiene se ven muy mal y acomodan mal
3.0,"Pretty, it ok"
3.0,"Great fit, love the orange and the pockets, however (and maybe I didn't read the description) but I though these were gonna be black based off the picture, and they're definitely a Heathered Grey :^/"
3.0,Glasses not dark enough for outside use.
3.0,It is a truly beautiful shirt. But I think the sizing is for children!
3.0,"These stockings fit well and seemed to be well constructed by my issue was with the color.  Online they claim to be, and look more wine, but in real life they were more red than wine so I had to return them."
3.0,"I like it, but the color is off. I bought the Navy and it's more like a purple-ish blue. It doesn't match any navy blue I own. I'm going to try to dye it again. The material is very thin and kind of shinny, not like the photo at all. The style is cute, I just wished the material was as shown. But for $18, it's still a cute top for life in Las Vegas, where I live.<br />I usually wear an XL. I bought both XL and XXL to see which one would fit better. I am keeping the XXL and sending back the XL."
3.0,Not exactly as the picture
3.0,Very comfortable.  The fabric is nice.  Washes well.  The seam and drawstrings do not line up.  Im not too picky about it.  But others might be.
3.0,"I bought 3prs in various colors, although they are comfy, none are exactly as pictured color wise. I wear an 8.5 and find that the socks are about 1/4 inch too short leaving my heel slightly over the edge otherwise they fit perfectly. My foot seems to take on the shape of the sock, square- round. My youngest daughter wears an 8-8.5 and they slide around on her feet, my oldest who wears a sz10 was not able to wear them at all. After wearing them around the house on carpet for about an hour I noticed that the stitching in the back of mine appears loose, it is loose on the side of my daughter's. Over all the socks are cute if you are lenient on the color scheme and comfy if you can fit them. For $8.99 with free 2 day shipping, the socks aren't bad. I would not purchase them again knowing that the stitching is coming loose so soon."
3.0,Shipped fine. Quality seems good. But the L is to short to fit. I cannot get it in my nose. So sad.
3.0,"Nice quality and soft to wear.<br />The multi-color photo showed black and white also, but they were not included in the 100pc bag."
3.0,"Glasses are just ridiculously big. Won't work as sunglasses. Lens width is 64mm so if you have a watermelon sized head you'll be good. Of course the size is listed and I should have read that; the 3 stars is for the low quality of the glasses and the good customer service (refunded me before they even recieved the glasses). Frame looks and feels very cheap, as noted by anyone who handled the glasses. Lenses aren't great either, they do block blue light but looking at the lenses from the outside you notice lines in them. For $10 you cannot really complain about lenses though.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-looks good too bad it's made for giants<br />-very affordable<br />-Excellent customer service<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Gigantic<br />-Cheap feeling and looking<br />-I guess I can't even complain about the lenses for $10"
3.0,Fits great everywhere except for the length. I would return it but I guess I can wear it with leggings. Disappointed but oh well 🤷🏻‍♀️
3.0,I purchased these for my son. He says they work ok but didn't stay positioned on his head very well. They slide around during use and need to be adjusted frequently.
3.0,"Its just ok. There are two yellow embroidered dots right in the wrong place on the chest. Very low riding pants. Very long pants, I had to hem them. Did not care for the big bell bottom pants."
3.0,Color was more pink than expected. Did appear to be sturdy enough.
3.0,Well made but waaayyyyy to small
3.0,Break so easily  had around my neck and it broke off
3.0,This was so pretty. I still wear it. Unfortunately you can tell it's not the best metal because it does tarnish very quickly. The picture is about 3 days of wear and has been in no water. I polish it every 4 days or so.
3.0,The broke wit in a day of wearing.
3.0,I liked everything about this dress but it felt large for the small size I ordered.  Part may be due to the cut so no fault of the dress on it's own merit.  Just know it will be very loose fitting
3.0,I loved the color and pattern.  This dress was very comfortable but it was too loose/stretchy in the bust and the pockets change the shape of the dress.
3.0,"Its kind of cheaply but, It was ok for the price I paid."
3.0,It is about as good of dress as what you pay for it. It's very plain. Fits ok. It seems larger in the hips than expected. It's not fancy so you may need a belt or accessories to class it up a little.
3.0,"I was under the impression that this would fit on my Pandora bracelet, and it does but not over the twisted part."
3.0,"It was alright, wasn't what I was searching for. It won't go to waste, my granddaughter will receive it."
3.0,"This shirt is very beautiful that’s why I ordered it. However, this shirt runs a little small for the size it states it is. However, as I continue to lose weight it’ll fit perfect."
3.0,I liked the bikini but it I am very top heavy so it just didn’t look good on my body.
3.0,Use at night for leg warmers - gets no more abuse than that.  Developed tear/hole/run after second use.  Has been washed inside a tide garment bag to minimize trauma from the washing machine.
3.0,very pretty but super hard.  Left actual cuts on my daughter
3.0,Rings are cool I love them but they are a little small that's why I gave a three. They are very fashionable
3.0,Kind of works as advertised
3.0,this thing is not gonna withstand more then a slight drizzle and breeze.
3.0,They fit and felt good but my toenail made a hole in the sock pretty quickly.
3.0,pretty but size is waaay too off for me
3.0,"Took other reviewers' advice and ordered 2&#34; up from my pant size. Glad I did! I wear a 34&#34; pant while I'd be just fine in a 33&#34;. Got the 36&#34; belt and it fits perfect on the very last hole. Sounds good, but I have yet to actually eat a meal wearing this belt. Do yourself a favor and add 3 to 4 inches to your pant size if you plan to wear this anyplace there may be food! That was my -1 star rant. The other was taken off due to the moldy/musty smell already addressed by others. Good quality otherwise."
3.0,They're ok but the one inch elastic band accentuates any rolls you might have.  The large was a little loose on me.
3.0,Dress is cute and fabric is nice but sized very large. It is loose fitting but shoulders were half way down my arms. Order at least 1 size down.
3.0,Excellent idea but Itchy fabric choice. Hope they make improvements bc I’d buy again
3.0,If you have large calf these socks are not for you. They constantly slide down
3.0,"not what i expected, but cool/funky"
3.0,"The material was a thicker than normal patty boutik dresses and has expected sizing. The material is suitable for work. While the cut and material was nice, the seams in the bust didn't line up in a very flattering way. The seams were very prominent and looked funny. I love patty boutik stuff 90% of the time, and have 4 dresses and like 10 tops. This one had to go back."
3.0,"Was cute, but wasn’t as flattering as other dresses I tried. Was kind of just baggy when my leg wasn’t poking out of the slit."
3.0,The frames are smaller than they appear but they are still nice glasses. Especially for the price.
3.0,"I'm really torn about this product. If you're expecting a women's size scarf you'll be sadly disappointed. It's very small, the size that would fit a young child. It is soft, however, and very cute. If you purchase this scarf knowing that you're getting a child's scarf, I think it's a good buy.  But because of the way it's advertised, I'm docking two stars to what should be a five star child's product."
3.0,"Update after 1 year of owning:<br /><br />I don't think I've EVER had a pair of leggings rip on me, but unfortunately after only about a year, these ripped in the crotch. I'm super sad because these leggings were my absolute favorite. I can't believe this happened. I'm gentle with leggings and hang dry them to preserve them. Unfortunately, they still ripped...<br /><br />Just be aware that the crotch seams might not be the most sturdy. Still love them though. Just heartbroken. &lt;/3"
3.0,"When I first put these on I loved them. They are comfortable and fit nicely. However, after wearing them just 10 minutes I quickly began to hate them. They do not stay up. Imagine having to pull your pants up after walking every few steps over and over. So annoying! I’m so disappointed. I really wanted high wasted pants I loved. These aren’t it!"
3.0,"Ordered last week. Used once and one of the bags already has a hole in it.  I specifically bought roll up bags because I can not figure out for the life of me, how to get bags back into the rectangular shape, but these bags don’t roll up as tight as the envirosax bags."
3.0,These are good and kids loved them. Hint: tape the inside where it hooks together so it'll stay together! The string is only big enough for kids. Will not fit adult heads!
3.0,"I ordered the ""White"" version of this watch, instead, I clearly received the ""Black"" version.<br /><br />I'm not interested in the Black colored version, of this particular watch, so I will not be using it, and unable to return from my location (overseas), as well.<br /><br />The watch in the photo is just newly un-boxed. Some marks/debris can be seen on the watch, but not really an issue for me, probably can be cleaned up with some wiping.<br /><br />I'm just disappointed to have waited quite a while for this shipment.. only to receive the wrong item.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Update:<br />I'm improving my rating of 1/5 stars to -> 3/5 stars, due to:<br /><br />- Very good communication from Seller<br />- Willingness from Seller, to fix/improve the mistake situation<br /><br />(I will improve the rating further, if I'm pleased with the watch replacement the seller has offered.)"
3.0,"I like how it looks and it seems to be well constructed. However, it had a horrible smell to it when I opened the package and I haven't been able to get the smell out. I'm not sure what the smell is."
3.0,these shoes are very heavy
3.0,They are really nice. The only issue I have is the nose pads came off
3.0,"Magify 3 is much, much better."
3.0,The boot fits but it is tight. I can't wear a heavy sock with them. That said they are comfortable and are good for being out and about all day.
3.0,"Kinda pretty. Slightly cheaper looking than I had hoped, but definitely wearable. I wear a LOT of red, and finding red beaded jewelry has been a challenge"
3.0,I really was not happy with the overall quality of these earrings.. when they arrived the wire was disengaged from the earrings as well
3.0,"The pink is not as pretty as photo. I'm 5'ft 7""  211lbs. I ordered the 3x based on reviews bit it was too big plus it has stretch in the fabric.  An xl would have been the best fit. Have to get it tailored. The length was perfect. Also the fabric is too soft for a jeans type. pants"
3.0,"Disappointed the charms are plastic. Where I didn't expect silver, I expected more than plastic."
3.0,...after about 6 months of wear.  Super cute up until then.
3.0,"The material and design is fine.....it's just poorly sewn. Easy enough to fix but, I shouldn't have to repair something I just purchased."
3.0,"Comfortable fabric, but arrived tiny! They fit without squeezing, but give me a constant wedgie. Good enough quality that I'm just reordering in a larger size, but seriously I thought they sent me kid's underwear by mistake!"
3.0,These headbands are small - I gave them to my grandkids - way too tight for an adult head.  One headband wasn't sewn properly on the inside - had to mend before use.  If these are cotton - it a low cotton blend.
3.0,Could not get the shoes on so I returned them to Amazon
3.0,i'm a little sad with this blouse.  i like the color and the style however it does run small.  i typically wear a L - XL  (14) but ordered a 16 W and this is still tighter than i would normally wear.  also the layered chiffon  is only sewn on the top so it gets a bit tangled up when i wore it.<br />with a few modifications it could be great
3.0,"Unfortunately, not what I expected but I really love the the dye print."
3.0,"Looks great in the picture.  It's bulk when you see it first hand, and the dress is really heavy.  The bottom skirt part looked funny on me, so I returned it."
3.0,My shirt has a chemical smell that two washes have not removed
3.0,Cute and fit as expected. I am unfortunately going to return them because they seemed clunky and heavier than other shoes we tried on (even within the Stride Rite brand). We love the SR brand but these weren't our favorites.
3.0,"Not what i expected, touch reduced by case, clasp always opened. Not the best"
3.0,"I loveee the look and fit of this jumper! So cute and comfortable, true to size. I would have easily given it 5 stars if it weren't for one of the straps coming only half sewed on."
3.0,Love the top.  It is very pretty.  Comfortable fabric.  It is cut just a little big in the bust area.  The colors are beautiful.
3.0,Si me gustó!
3.0,"Llego rota, y no trajo los accesorios que dice en la imagen."
3.0,I wouldnt call these a size 12. They were more like a size 11
3.0,"If it had fit, it would've been super cute!"
3.0,"Unlike most users, I was looking for protection from dust and debris kicked up by lawn mowing following cataract surgery. In that respect, these goggles are definitely superior to eye glasses. But I found the field of view too restricted and the fit too tight for comfort. Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, they fog up despite external temperatures apt to be higher than what would be encountered in water."
3.0,"My wife has been having some issues with finding her some underwear that fit comfortably, correctly and stay cool so we had ordered a few different ones to try. This Layla’s Celebrity 3 pack of seamless hipster nylon spandex underwear is one of the brands I ordered for her to try. She said that the material is comfortable, but doesn’t seem breathable like it was advertised. They fit as far as size but would slide around when she moved.  If you are really active she says these are not the underwear for you, but if you live a somewhat sedentary lifestyle in a cooler climate then here in Texas they would okay since they fit to size and are a comfortable material so we’re giving them 3 Stars."
3.0,Very big on my face
3.0,The shirt fits great and has an expensive feel to the fabric I didn't need the shirt after all due to the fact that the Spread Collar was less than four inches. I like to display a wide Full Windsor knot and unfortunately the collar on this shirt didn't accommodate that.
3.0,"Nice fit -- but cheaply made, tons of lint balls on the first day of wear. Will work for 'around the hose/play clothes."
3.0,The light up part of the shoe stopped working in less then two months.
3.0,Bonito un poco incomodo y de rompe fácil
3.0,I ordered these for my daughter that is in a size 2 and they were too small.
3.0,I wore this all day and did not feel sweaty at all. I've had better sweat vest then this but I wanted to try it cause it does zip up in the front. That was the only plus about it.
3.0,First use was fine but after i wash it i can not wear it anymore because its looks like a t sirt and not a dress. Its shrink
3.0,They fit but are lose and fall out pretty easy
3.0,Runs very small. Order 2 sizes up for proper fit. Seller was great in sending another.
3.0,"Thin material but returned it based on it being too large for me. I had ordered a medium.<br />I am 5’5” and 130 lbs, athletic build."
3.0,The pants fit but a little on the small side in the butt area.
3.0,These s/m fit my 9.5 women's shoe size foot just fine.  But they are too short in length and too tight for a larger calf and are constricting at the top.
3.0,Decent/average.
3.0,"The cap fit as expected. But after a few uses, the elasticity wore out."
3.0,"This product is made to look distressed. None of the exterior seams ar turned inward for a finished look all the edges are just sewn down to the fabric without sewing traditionally. So! If you like that distressed look, this is a good price. I do not believe that the advertised description was accurate and the photo details were not clear. However it is big, warm, the zipper is good and my brother accepted it!"
3.0,They work.  They just cut into the back of my ankle a bit.
3.0,"Wife bought me them. They are a little tight if you ask me, but okay for a little change in pace."
3.0,Not sure how to describe the fabric. It’s a mix of too breathe-able to be protective at all but still thick enough to make your face sweat and ears hurt. The packaging was nice but the masks seem just inconsistent enough to lead me to think they’re hand cut and sewn. I live in the US and I’m disappointed in myself for ordering these instead of just going to the local grocery store where they have hanes and Levi’s brand masks for like 10-12 bucks. These just looked more comfortable and unfortunately I was wrong. If you’ve ordered these I hope you’ve had a different experience than mine
3.0,This was bulky on me. I’m usually an xs and could not wear the smallest size it was loose and too long imo.
3.0,Overall it is good quantity but the strap between your toes is rough and can be irritating when walking. In the picture it looks like it is all smooth but the underneath part is not. I would not buy again because of this
3.0,Product sewn better
3.0,I love the material and style but the sleeves are way to short on me.
3.0,"Quality material, color matches picture and sizing was accurate. This was less flowy than the picture led me to believe and it wrinkles if you aren’t careful. Definitely keeping"
3.0,This is pretty but a bit more tight than I would have prefered. I will still be using it for my wedding but if you have big wrists then it is not for you
3.0,So this is a great scarf. But just a scarf. The pockets are in odd places no matter how many times I reward it so I don't use them.
3.0,"I previously purchased a mask/flag and since it was a fair product,  I decided to purchase another one.  However, to my surprise, I discovered that the American/Jamaican flag they sent me had the ""union jack"" to the flags left.  The union jack should be to the flags right. I wasn't sure I wanted to display this item. Look at their sample to see what I am talking about. No further thoughts"
3.0,"Bought for two year old and was too small, great quality and material just too small for the kid I bought it for"
3.0,Fit good for swimming laps
3.0,"While very cute and my daughter loved them because they are Batman, they run small. I bought bigger size expecting that and they still are very tight and revealing."
3.0,"Ordered a green umbrella.  Received a green umbrella.  The outside green color lasted 4 weeks -- it turned to a dull brown.<br />The inside is still green 5 months later.  The umbrella is very sturdy and will probably be around for a long time -- I spent a long time looking for the right size"" green ""umbrella"" though."
3.0,Nice although it WRINKLES a lot.
3.0,Totally not screw in. Luckily it seems to be staying in my lip just fine. So far.
3.0,It seemed sturdy when I gave it to our son for his new (used) Scion tC...but after 3 weeks the metal Scion fob chain broke and we lost it...so not well made as far as we are concerned.
3.0,I absolutely love 😍 💕 these pants. Fits great. Sizing chart is acurate. Soo comfy. But unfortunately they are a little see threw. I am skeptical about wearing them in public.
3.0,"This watch was great, until it died. I loved it and wore it almost every day, but after 2 months the battery died."
3.0,The shirt was great the shipping was fast.
3.0,Very Small and I'm 13.
3.0,"These are great, exactly what I wanted. Except they were small... so small that two sizes up would probably be perfect."
3.0,The middle fits like a 0 but the outter parts fit huge and stretched my ears more trying to put them in
3.0,Skirt to loose on top and top ran small but i still love it i look great in it
3.0,"I could've saved myself some time if I would've read the reviews before purchasing.  This grill cover is not orange.  It is black with an orange T.  I am keeping it just so I don't have to go through the hassle of returning and getting the same cover again like others before me.  I don't like the look of the black as much as the orange, but it is a gift and I'm sure my dad will like it just fine.  Just beware that you will get a black one instead of an orange one."
3.0,I like the feel of the material.  The forearms are a little snug and I purchased a large and wear a medium.  I had to talk it to the dry cleaners to have the collar pressed because it did not lay correctly.
3.0,Cute idea but two problems for me. Since it’s actually a skirt I had a hard time keeping it in the perfect place and two it flared at the end instead of laying smooth
3.0,"The mask is a bit more flimsy than expected. We did glue in some foam inserts, and it worked well. Definitely an adult mask. Large to XL."
3.0,It is looking neat already
3.0,"This suit was cute and as pictured but SUPER SMALL. I'm 5’0 and size L was too short on me! I am also large busted and part of the length issue was the cups were not high enough to provide good coverage.  Definitely order at least two sizes up. Even though I usually wear a small in most clothes, I'm returning this for the XL. If that one fits, I'll update my review."
3.0,"I like the case. It fits my iphone 6s Plus, which was one of the reasons I got it. However, I am finding<br />it is a little flimsy, and I have trouble remembering what compartment the thing I need is in. I guess<br />3 is too many for me :-) Would I recommend? yes! If you need a little pouch instead of carrying around<br />a big purse...this is for you!"
3.0,Not as big as I anticipated. Phone glasses case and keys about all that will fit
3.0,This tshirt style was super short and wide. Not typical shirt style at all (and it’s not like it’s supposed to be a cut off shirt).<br />Very very stretchy and soft. But I prefer my tshirts to hold their shape. I returned it.
3.0,"Is very small, and almost white :/"
3.0,"Let's be fair here. You get what you pay for. I'm 5'6, 155 lbs. this fits well in A1 after i washed in hot water and shrunk it a bit. I had this for 2 years now, initially everything was fine. After 1 year of use, somehow after it's hang dry, the gi is as stiff as a card board and the fabric feels more like a 80 grit sand paper. After you sweat a bit, then it's fine. But like i said, for $70, it's a good gi. If you want better quality, you pay upwards of $150-300."
3.0,The material they use is very slick it comes in tucked very easily.  but about what I expected for the price .
3.0,"The description was ""t-shirt material"", but it's more polyester than cotton. Maybe even a little rubbery feeling. Too bad, because it's very cute, but I just cant get over the weird fabric. Fit is exactly as expected. I am usually an American size 14. XL fit well."
3.0,Little too big. I know Its fake but with it being so large it’s really fake.
3.0,"This shirt is a beautiful fabric. Pink is not translucent. It fits a bit more snug at the chest than expected, but I ordered up 2 sizes because it is from China.  Not unexpected, as most shirts fit me that way.  The disappointing thing is that it rides up - it is not as long as the image shows. It falls RIGHT at the waistline, not at the very top of the hips or even below it. I find myself constantly tugging it down to cover the waistband of pants I am wearing and have given up wearing it without a blazer or sweater on top. Sad, because I ordered it in all the colors. I'd return them all, but I opened the packages so I cannot."
3.0,"decent quality, but fit was exactly one size smaller than quoted."
3.0,Good price for the mask but its cheaply made. The pattern is cute. I like the idea of the adjustable ear strings but it's a little plastic piece that's hard to move. The fabric itself is rough and was too big. The pocket for the inserts bunched up around my mouth making it harder to breathe. I ended up cutting it out. The inserts are plastic so I threw them out. I wore the mask once and never wore it again. It's just not comfortable.
3.0,Looks good- until you wash it. The reversible design does not do well in the machine.
3.0,Beautiful on the eye but very flemsey. Much smaller than expected. I gave them to my daughter.
3.0,I ordered this dress in the color burgundy it arrived today in the mail and the color is more of a red/ maroon color. Also the turtle neck is very high up on the neck not loose and baggy like the picture. Lastly the material of the dress is scratchy and uncomfortable. The only pro is the dress fits nice and baggy like I wanted.
3.0,"After using this since Christmas, and it's now August, I realized that it is too dangerous for things to fall out. Only the middle compartment has a zipper and things constantly slide out, even when it is on the floor of the car while I drive. Recently my wallet slid out and I almost lost it. I might still keep it to carry files for a a meeting or a small laptop. Whenever I reach my destination, I have to refill my handbag. Very risky and annoying. Also the biggest compartments are open on top and people can see what's inside, even if it looks messy. A handbag organizer I bought did not make much difference."
3.0,"I bought these shorts for our son's birthday in April. After a couple months of wearing them I'm extremely happy to say there isn't any wear spots or tattered ends. They seem pretty durable, the price was very reasonable. The only complaint my son had was that the legs were a bit to long. They were just long enough past the knee to be classified as ""high water"" pants & not shorts, that's more operator error than anything. All in all the shorts look good, they're priced good, they're made good, but most importantly my son absolutely loves them, & in my book as well as with most parents; is a winning review."
3.0,Adorable and it fits nicely but the zipper is complete crap. I have to go to a seamstress to get a new zipper put in if I ever want to wear this again
3.0,"I want to like these better. I ordered the next size up, which fits well. There is very little stretch. They definitely shrink a little. There is an inner drawstring at the waist, which is slightly annoying. They could be more comfortable, overall. They are quite thin, which is fine. On the up side, the color is a lovely (gold)."
3.0,The product is too sheer.
3.0,"The design is basically printed onto the spandex so if it stretches you can see the colour slightly fade, so don't buy the dress to fit close. Otherwise it's a decent dress, worth the cost."
3.0,Had to shave down to fit my G-Shock Solar
3.0,The part that goes into the belly button is kind of uncomfortable. It isn’t very smooth and actuall cut my belly button when I was wearing a tight undershirt
3.0,I love the wallet but the color is lighter then what they show.
3.0,Nice colors but way too big
3.0,its a good bolt but it was not the shade i was hoping for
3.0,"It's cute but a little too big in the boobs for me. Not all fat women have huge tits. It's fine for sitting around in at the pool but to actually swim in it is difficult. Would be a good &#34;I wanna look cute at the pool while my kids swim&#34; suit but if you are like me and wanna swim some laps, I wouldn't recommend it."
3.0,"The arms are quite short, even for an average sized head/face. Look of the frames in nice though."
3.0,"Three stars are being given because the shirt runs really large. I'd say it's more like a 4T than the 3T I purchased. When I put it on my toddler, it looked like a dress. It is a cute shirt, with cute dinosaur patterns, but I am sad he can't wear it for quite some time. The material seems to be good and it seems to be a good quality shirt, but I won't really know until it gets some use."
3.0,I've always worn one of these but this one has an odd fit...really can't put my finger on the problem but it simply doesn't lay the way it should. Quality of the construction is good but the fit is a bit off.
3.0,Bonitos pero están más grandes de lo que deberían.<br />Muy anchos.<br />Le quedaron muy flojos.
3.0,"I am tall approximately 5’10 and these joggers are just a bit too short for my liking. The material is great the quality seems really nice and I love the design on the back, it’s very flattering, but unfortunately the length leaves the pant at such a weird spot, practically halfway up my calf. If you have a smaller inseam or don’t mind a shorter pant you won’t mind these but just keep this in mind if you’re tall"
3.0,Looks cheap. We modified it to look more real. Fits okay.
3.0,"I ordered this product in purple and it is most definitely not purple it very much pink. Which is okay but I was expecting purple as the are for a parade and was expecting a totally different color. Other than that they are decent quality, I wouldn't recommend them for a formal thing but more of a costume thing.<br /><br />I received this product at a free or discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. All thoughts and feelings on this product are of my own and are no way influenced by the company. I provide the same honest review no mater the price of the product."
3.0,Really like the shoe. Very comfortable. Did arrive slightly damaged but I didn’t want to fool with returning so I’ll wear them anyway
3.0,"Literally every single seam popped. I've had to completely resew all four clips back on and the little elastic adjustment loops came apart.<br /><br />Oh and the pins fall out of the clips. So you may want to put a dot of epoxy over the ends of those.<br /><br />All that said... once I fixed all of it, these do work great. You'll need to fold the hem of the shirt 3-4 times to get a good tight grip on the fabric,  but that's no big deal. These also don't seem to damage the shirt fabric.<br /><br />They're not entirely plastic. They do have little metal pins holding the clips together. I haven't had an issue going through a metal detec t or with these on yet, but I've not been through many since buying these."
3.0,T shirt is cute but the pants r waaay tiny. Very slim fit. And it is a polyester cotton blend that has no stretch so i will be giving it to my 2 year old. The tshirt fit as expected.
3.0,They fall out very easy... I was wearing my favorite pair out dancing & when I came home I noticed one has fell out...
3.0,"Let me just say, if you have small boobs, you are going to need a bra that allows you to fill this top, and its pretty low cut, so maybe like a Victoria's Secret Bombshell bra or similar lol I have small boobs, and I noticed right away that an average bra was not going to be suffice. I think the shirt is sexy, but it runs big. I bought a small in black, (I'm 5'4&#34;, 140, and A cup), its not as tight as I would like it to be, there's a zipper on the back, and when I had it zipped all the way up there was quite a bit of extra space (wrinkling and raised a little weird) and it didn't sit flat against my back... I'm hoping once I put on a larger bra that will smooth it out a little better, or try tucking it into my skirt/shorts/pants more. Oh and the choker part of the neck is also a bit loose, but not awful. Overall I am happy with the amount of money I spent on it."
3.0,I thought it would be a little bigger. It only fits one tube of lipstick. Nothing else
3.0,The shirt is too big
3.0,I love the design and feel but I purchased it thinking there was going to be two colors one silver and one black in stead I got two black
3.0,"Did not like the fabric. It was quite wrinkled when it arrived. Fit smaller than I would have liked, so I returned it."
3.0,Dress is cute- but runs huge! I ordered a medium bc that is what I usually wear- and it feels like an xl- definitely size down!
3.0,I ordered 2x and it’s more like a small/medium. Good material though.
3.0,Bought for daughter she liked. Butt cherkd are more revealing and she expected.
3.0,Fits way to small order a full size up.. the boots are nice by the way
3.0,The dress fit fine except for in the bust area. It was a little big but we were able to alter just that area and now the dress fits nicely everywhere.
3.0,So far so good. don't wear them often tho.
3.0,Slippers run small. I ended up giving them to my sister. I recommend ordering at least two sizes larger
3.0,Its okay. Don't like the material.
3.0,Can't  tell if it's  working for me! Too tight!!!!!!!
3.0,"Much too small, order at least a size up"
3.0,"It fits well. I wanted it to be a little big on me. It's warm. The materials and stitching aren't great though. As a surprise, it came with a pair of wool knee high socks. I'm happy with it."
3.0,Kind of big and floppy.  Seem to be made for a bigger child.
3.0,Not a great quality but OK for price
3.0,It's very short. I even went up a size to make sure I was comfortable and it is about 3 inches shorter than what is pictured.
3.0,The opals we beautiful.  A little smaller han I thought they would be but I lost one by the second night.  think the backing was just a little to loose.
3.0,Size up if you want the oversized look like the pictures. Cheap material but very comfy
3.0,"its a belt , but a good one . if it is still good one year later i will up my review"
3.0,It seems very high waisted. The drawstring is much above my waistline so is not very attractive. Also quite thin. Like the color
3.0,Medium fits more like a large so size down! I wear size 33-34 and the medium is too big.
3.0,"The design print is well done and the inside is soft, only downside is that it's way to small even getting a XXL"
3.0,Cute hat but shrunk after one wash.
3.0,I had to return these because they were too narrow for me.
3.0,It’s pretty but very heavy.
3.0,I gave them 3 stars because of the simple fact they arrived with a small scratch on the right lens. Other than that they worked for me.
3.0,I like it. It's what I expected but I think the weave for the ear flaps is too loose. The wind seems to go through it and my ears don't stay as warm as I'd like.
3.0,"1. Ad should indicate that the colors are selected at random and probably will not match the photo<br />2. The masks are relatively narrow and don't cover the mouth & chin as well as in the photo<br />3. Masks should have an embedded wire to keep a tight fit over the nose & cheeks<br />4. On the positive side, the ear tabs are adjustable."
3.0,"I bought these for my friends bachelorette party and everyone was so excited to wear them. We wore them for one photo and that was it. They were very annoying to wear cause they were hard to see through and gave us a headache. If you are looking for something to make your photos pop for the gram, then i would recommend these.  Other then that, kind of a waste of money."
3.0,"I love the robe and the fabric.  It is very soft and lightweight.  Great for the summer.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the belt placement is too high, the belt is too short, and the belt is made of the same fabric as the robe.  The robe fabric doesn't provide enough friction for it to stay closed without additional tying, but it's too short to tie without looking odd."
3.0,"I Loved the original Glovables but this last two pair are no better than Latex gloves from the grocery store, very disappointed!! The rubber the gloves are made from used to be very thick so you could use very hot water and you were insulated from the heat. Unless I read some better reviews this last pair was my last. What a shame, I really loved the originals."
3.0,Order a size smaller in order for it to fit correctly.
3.0,cheaply made. received bend. frame and arms were bend on arrival
3.0,It fit a little bigger than I had expected based on other similar styles that I have purchased on Amazon.  I usually where a XL (14-16) so I purchased the XL and it fit really big in the shoulders.  Love the material and color though.
3.0,"Good quality, but these are not for noses. I will keep them for my ears though."
3.0,They're really pretty but the bar size is to small for what I was pierced with. If I wear for more than a week my hole starts to heal smaller so I'm gonna have to wait to wear them.
3.0,"No m gusto el color , el modelo si"
3.0,"Cute but not durable. We bought this as an accessory for our daughter’s Halloween costume. If you’re planning on wearing this once, it’s okay, but be ready to have the hot glue gun handy, because pieces WILL be falling off."
3.0,Black ones are chipping
3.0,"I bought these pants for a 1970s party and they were a true Bellbottom. But like other comments the quality was not great. The zipper was difficult to move up and down and I was afraid it would break while I was wearing it. Also the pockets are cut too short and so they don’t stay tucked in. I wore a long shirt but I would not have been able to tuck in a shirt. The fabric is very soft and comfy. I ordered an 8-10 ,  They sent a large and they fit well. So they must be a foreign or junior size."
3.0,but not a filling petticoat as I had thought
3.0,"The sandals look beautiful, no question about that; but my recommendation is not to wear them if you will walk, not even so much, because it will hurt your toes and cause blisters."
3.0,"I wear shoe size 12 or 13 depending on where they are made These socks look really nice but they are so tight that is is extremely hard to get them off, so hard that I will just give them away...."
3.0,Very thin Material had expected a little thicker fabric
3.0,"I like the size, I don’t like that it’s already showing signs of wear. Black crack lines are showing up"
3.0,Soft and comfortable. A tad on the large size. They smell funny. One glove looks like it had a tag cut out. Hasn't been cold here yet so I can't say if they're warm or not but they'll be fine for driving.
3.0,i like these
3.0,"Arrived on time,  looks quite nice. Material is of good quality."
3.0,They work but the inside of the clips are rather large and will dig into you if you are sinching the clothing more tightly. I did a huge pair of jeans mostly just to where they wouldn't fall off so they worked well for me. The sunflower design is super cute but they were sort of a pain to put in and it takes a lot of finesse to get the back off of the pins.
3.0,I lost the elastic band after 6 months now I just use a ribber band and that seems to have a better bite on my cards.
3.0,Definitely a costume quality shirt
3.0,If ok
3.0,"Ok first off, I'm a 33&#34; waist and I got small, because I prefer a snug fit.<br />I love that the waistband is snug, and I love the modal material. The width of the front pouch is nice also,  completely covering from one fold of your leg/thigh, to the other.<br />Now the bad.<br />The strap in the back is way too long to offer any support unless you want to wear these up around your belly button. It's  also too wide (although soft) to lay flat without wadding up.<br />Finally,  the small thin elastic in the hems is too weak and not very containing. The width of the top of the back strap also isn't as wide and low as the pictures,  it's a little  narrower and deeper, not bad, kinda different than most mens thongs,  kinda nice.<br />My suggestions:<br />1. Shorten the back strap by 1.5&#34; - 2&#34;.<br />2. Narrow the bottom half of the back strap, so It doesn't wad up at the back door, but leave the top half the same width, up by where it connects to the waistband.<br />3. Put stronger, more stretchy elastic in the side seams for a more body hugging, secure, containing fit."
3.0,They were smaller than described.
3.0,It runs big so size down.  Decent quality for price.
3.0,This dress was just okay for me. It would’ve been great but the peplum part was too short for me. The design concept was nice and still a pretty dress .Will be returning but love the other dresses purchased by this seller
3.0,"Will be returning this item, it is way to small."
3.0,"I bought this shirt because I have recently had a major surgery and it made it difficult to pull shirts over my head. I wanted something to button up the front. It is cute, and comfortable. I like the gentleness of the fabric on my skin. Unfortunately the buttons do not meet in the front as they appear to in the photo. There is a tiny gap between the sides making it impossible to wear the shirt without a camisole or tank top, which sort of defeats my goal of not having to pull a shirt over my head after surgery. Still comfortable and cute. Just not something you can wear by itself if your self conscious about the gap."
3.0,I bought three of these.  The strap and buckle broke on one of them immediately.  My solution was to replace the strap on all three with a heavy duty zip tie.  The other thing that I don't like is the slot to insert your contact information is on the outside instead of the inside where it belongs.
3.0,"Not as soft as Lulu’s.  Read reviews, so I got a small. They were tight on my belly. I’m 5’3. 125. Should have gotten a M"
3.0,"It's a case.  Not as good as one that comes with a premium pair of glasses and not as well made, but for the price it's ok"
3.0,I thought the quality of the metal could be better.
3.0,"Was really looking forward to wearing this, however, the tee shirt is shoddy looking and the material is way too thin.  It doesn't fit properly either."
3.0,So small.  No two were the same size. Cute patterns.  Too bad they don’t fit my super thick hair.
3.0,It does not work well
3.0,"I was disappointed, just not as nice as the photo, It's a nice enough Bowtie!"
3.0,"Based on the sizing chart I ordered a medium. The dress was way too large. I could easily shimmy in and out of it without using the zipper. I am 5'4, 130lbs with a 34c chest. I should have ordered a small. I only returned in because of the size. If the dress fit I would have kept it."
3.0,Don't needum now.....sweating season is over.
3.0,Based on reviews I was expecting better quality. It is stiff and makes me think it will break. Not satisfied.
3.0,"Consider the price, the quality is just like the price. Style is as described which I really like, however, I would not purchase if I knew the quality. And this stuff is a little larger than I expected."
3.0,"The shirt quality is high.  The only downside is the sizing is wrong, they are too large.  If I am getting an athletic dri fit running shirt  I am expecting a snug fit, these were enormous.  Its a shame because  they are priced right and do seem well made.  For clarification I glance over reviews but have never changed an order because people said sizing was off.  trust me sizing is off"
3.0,"Smaller than I expected, but well made."
3.0,"Sorry, had to return as they came twisted weirdly or weirdly twisted."
3.0,"Very nicely made. Shoulder straps not long enough for me and it was too tight around the rib cage. But the support is great. Im a 40DDD (5'8-170lbs). If you are sensitive to ribcage compression, go up a size. Cup size was perfect."
3.0,They really are huge. I haven’t worn them yet as they are kind of the size of my head
3.0,"I had to return the first one for a gash and scratches, the ghost was dark yellow not white and there were big bubbles in the design. My second one he is more glow in the dark yellow, not white, no scratches or gashes and only 2 bubbles. Not happy but because i'm not willing to wait for a third attempt and want to wear it to my Colorado Ghostbusters meeting I'll deal with it."
3.0,The pants are long which is great because I’m 5’9 and I got a small they fit good however there more for going out on a date or girl night. Not for work
3.0,"Cute, but the slit on the side comes just about to my waist????  So you HAVE to wear something, either shorts or leggings under this....Very comfortable but just a weird design....will be using this to wear around the house and maybe sleep in....But, I wouldn't order again do to not being very functional"
3.0,"material is to fragile, it broke in the first day."
3.0,It is a nice quality but seems like it runs several sizes too large.  The lavender one is somewhat lighter in color than it appears online.  I’m keeping it for my daughter to wear… maybe next year or the year after?
3.0,"I loved these glasses, I took them to the eye glass store only to find out that I couldn't get any of my corrective lens in them. But the reviews said that you could/for that Im not happy."
3.0,Should advertise differently because I thought this costume came with the axe pictured. It doesn't. Very pricey for just a suite....
3.0,The item was too small on my wrist and neck.
3.0,Bought this to replace my original prop which was much bigger but couldn’t find that one anywhere.
3.0,The insides of the shoes are very stiff with pieces of material poking your feet. I will try to cover it skin with moleskin. Other than that they are really cute.
3.0,"I ordered two pair of the Oval Unisex Outdoor Vintage sunglasses and though I liked them, one pair has now broken at the hinge.  I had hoped to get more than a half years worth of wear from these sunglasses."
3.0,"After reading the other reviews I felt confident this would fit my 7 year old, however it doesn’t. Too big."
3.0,"Very thin material which is good for heavy workouts. Although it was larger than expected, it shrunk after a machine dry, and now it fits perfectly. When I received this shirt in the mail, the inside of the shirt was stuck together and I had to rip the front and back apart so it can be worn. That was sketchy and I was worried I would rip the shirt."
3.0,These would be perfect if the straps didn't come so loose.
3.0,"The pajama set is nice to look at and brightly colored.  I was excited to use it for Christmas! It is well put together and there are no structural issues with stitching.  However, the pajamas do not fit well and run small.  The pants are straight fitted and hardly give room if you are curvy or have hips.  The material has no give and is not stretchy or forgiving for those holiday indulgences."
3.0,cute shoe but runs small and really narrow overall in shape.
3.0,"was not as sturdy as it needed to be the arm of the frame would come off,"
3.0,"I don't know what I expected from cheap kids shoes, but within one wearing, my daughter had scuffed the material off the toe section and stained them. They are cute though. She does complain they're too tight, but if I loosen the buckle she's fine."
3.0,"Cute, but the headband was way too small. Gave it away to a young cousin."
3.0,"These sunglasses are cute and they fit well. A couple of things are weird with them (however these are the first polarized sunglasses I've ever worn so I don't have anything to compare to). Looking through the lenses, everything looks a little warped...like there is a bend in the lenses that makes the view a bit skewed. Also, when looking at a smartphone screen while wearing them, the colors are off and sort of 3-D.  Overall, I do like them, but next time I'll stick to buying sunglasses I can try on at the store."
3.0,It fit ok for me but was somewhat to big because it's a stretchy material..
3.0,"I’d you’re a curvy chick go a size up, super cute just awkward fit"
3.0,"Wish I had read the other reviews about this particular pattern.... the “V’s” aren’t centered like the picture shows. It just looks off. Bummed because otherwise it’s a really cute bathing suit top!  I sized up... normally wear an xl tshirt, got the xxl. Fit well.<br />***EDIT: I see that they now updated the pic for this pattern. Before, the pic showed the “V” as centered. The current pic is an accurate representation of the pattern."
3.0,"For the money, these are good sunglasses. The lenses are a bit tough to change out, but because of that they are more secure than other multi-lens frames I've owned. The only other issue is that the red nose piece reflects off of the polarized lens; this is a pretty big distraction when riding. I got used to it, but every ride it takes a little time to adjust to that. I suggest that the manufacturer make that nose piece black."
3.0,"I am 5'1&#34; and it went down to my knees, which was fine bc all the other reviews said it would shrink. However, I found the shoulders to be way too tight so this had to go back."
3.0,Not good quality. Came without tags and the logo is very shiny. Also came in one of those air tight vacuum sealed bags that made the hoodie extremely wrinkled. Had to wash immediately.
3.0,"Good for sunny days, I imagine. I had hoped I could wear it on rainy days when walking my dog, but the circumference is a little too small for that, I still got wet."
3.0,"This is a cute outfit, but it faded bad on the first wash. The black looks dark grey. It is still wearable. I just think the color should hold up better."
3.0,Was cute but was too small and had to return
3.0,It's cute and fits right but it's a little see through
3.0,nice and sturdy
3.0,Very pretty scarf but a little small
3.0,I ordered the wrong size and had to return.
3.0,Bought these mostly wanting the gold and pearl colored ring since I mainly wear gold. They came in and two of them were silver (the white and purple) while the darker ring was gold. Overall good quality for the price. Avoid getting the wet and you should be good.
3.0,These are larger than I expected and not easy to put on but they do keep accurate time and the clearance price almost giveaway.
3.0,"True to size but it's straight see through, material so is thin. You'll definitely need a slip underneath. 👎 Other than that, color was nice & the length was just like the photo I ordered a medium and I'm 5'4 weigh 125 lbs. It fit perfect...."
3.0,"Necklace chain Broke before I could even wear it.<br />It’s a nice product, just wish it lasted a month at least. As you can see in the picture, it’s broken.<br />I was so excited"
3.0,"I typically wear size L in tops and dresses. I did, however, order this dress in an XL. I'm glad I did because I definitely would not have fit in a L and the armpits were too small in the XL. I had to take a star off for not having something that would fit a typical size L person. That being said, there were a lot of things I liked about this dress. I liked that it had adjustable straps and that the v neck was at a modest height. I liked the way the fabric felt and it washed (in the washing machine on delicate) and dried (air dried) very well. It was midi length on me (I'm 5'2) and I really loved that length. I've never had a silk slip dress before, but I can see why others love them for a capsule wardrobe. It could easily be dressed up or down, would be light for summer, and you could easily wear tops/sweaters over the top portion to use the bottom as a skirt. I carry all my weight in my midsection and this did not accentuate that. I didn't absolutely love how this dress looked on me, but I liked it. Overall, I would not recommend this dress if you wear a size L or bigger, but if you are smaller then it would be worth trying.<br />For reference- I am 145lbs., apple shape"
3.0,"Good for a one-time wear, but poorly made. Fit across the chest, but loose in one armpit and crotch..."
3.0,It did not fit want money back
3.0,This was a good tie at first but the stitching isn't tight enough and after one wear there is a tear in it.
3.0,"Cute but wish it had a little stretch to so I could use it for multiple purposes, like on my thigh etc"
3.0,I purchased the size based on the chart.  Unfortunately a petite would have probably fit much better.  It will due for my water aerobic class but I would have ordered my usual size.
3.0,the posts are too short. i wanted to attach a different backing that locks but the posts are way too short. i had to return them.
3.0,"The top fit great, but wasn't a fan of the metal rings in the back, one had a sharp spot on it that was rough. The bottoms are super skimpy and if you have hips or thighs or a booty they will not fit you. I had to return the item"
3.0,probably going to turn my ear green but its cute
3.0,"Comfortable, very soft. It just came apart on the seam after one wash. Maybe it’s a fluke. But it’s a bummer."
3.0,Like the look.
3.0,"Purchased this dress hoping it would work for a wedding.  It’s a little wide on the waist and a little tight across the chest if you’ve got bigger cups.  Had some difficulty with returning, but the seller does communicate often trying to make things right."
3.0,The clasp took me an hour to open but I got it. Otherwise I love it. Thank you
3.0,These are nice shirts. They fit how I expected but after the first wash this is how it came out
3.0,The black pair Did not come with a side pocket like pictured. It came with a small pocket on the waist but that was it. They look more like yoga pants instead. I wanted the pocket for work to put my phone in it. They are very comfy and fit as expected just disappointed that they don’t look like the picture and have no pocket. My other pair that I got from them did however come with pockets and look like the picture so confused y the black ones did not.
3.0,"So in the picture the top is a dark Burgundy, but when I received it today the top is a light burgundy with white Speckles in it. Not a happy camper 😡"
3.0,I personally would order 2 sizes larger if I reorder.  No problem with the quality with which they're made.
3.0,This bra is way off for its supposed size.  There is no way it is the size I ordered.  It is extremely small.  I am losing weight so I may use it one day.  The quality is good and it's a nice bra for those whom it will fit.
3.0,Way too thin to be considered compression.<br />Thin stretchy material- the only reason the picture makes it look like abs and pecs is because that's the mannequin it is on. It's just one thickness of real thin material. Will hug whatever it's on but absolutely won't compress or reshape.
3.0,Read above
3.0,"i should really know better than to buy clothes from amazon. I'm 5 feet tall and 100 pounds and I ordered this in a medium. It was really much smaller than I was expecting, as I usually wear an S. This fit just like an XS"
3.0,Ankle band is tight.
3.0,"Fabric, stitching, pattern; this is a great hoodie. Just one snag.<br /><br />I'm a big guy. 6' and over 250 lbs.<br />So, I ordered a couple of these hoodies for my sons and I. My oldest is 6'1 and skinny as a rail at 160 lbs. My youngest is a blocky guy at 5'4 and 160 (we're working that down)<br /><br />So, I ordered a 2XL for both my sons and a 5XL for myself. Figured that should give us what we needed size wise.<br />My son's were both able to fit nicely in their hoodies and they looked great.<br />My hoodie didn't have enough width in the bottom to even get over my shoulders. Something I've never experienced with a 5XL product before. I had my oldest try it on and it fits him just a touch looser than the 2XL does.<br />Not sure if mine got mislabeled size wise and I got a smaller product or if the only fit difference is the length and arm length.<br />But as a barrel chested guy with a belly - I just couldn't fit into their 5XL.<br />Still, looks great on my kid and otherwise it is a great product."
3.0,"My husband thought it was a nightgown. VERY flowy, not very flattering. Color a bit washed out. Nice, if you want something to eat a lot. Hot, fake fabric."
3.0,A little too small for my liking. But the workmanship is excellent.
3.0,latches come undone easy
3.0,Beautiful.. However its not long enough to do as the picturesshow and lookgood.. Far too short..
3.0,"I bought these for jazzy accessories, but they don't have the pizazz I was hoping for."
3.0,"Runs a bit large, material is really cheap feeling like rayon or something"
3.0,Nothing wrong with the product but it was to tight across the chest
3.0,It was cute but it rusted rather quickly. I didn't even get it wet.
3.0,"I was skeptical when I bought this because I have a small chest, but wide hips.  So, small is perfect for my chest, but too small for my hips and a large is perfect for my hips, but too large for my bust.  However, I followed the size chart for the MWMart Women’s One Piece Swimsuit High Waist Bathing Suit and just crossed my fingers.  The great this is that it was so inexpensive that I wouldn't feel too disappointed if it didn't fit.  Amazingly this fit everywhere!  I had to tie and pull the back pretty tight to make it right for my bust, but once I did that it was great.  The downside is that this swimsuit isn't going to pull you in, so every roll, bump, or imperfection you'd like to hide is going to be seen.  I have bathing suits that aren't shapewear bathing suits, but are more expensive and use high quality fabric that do pull you in  so you look a bit slimmer.  This suit isn't going to do that, so I felt a bit more self conscious about wearing this without a coverup.  However, I did like as 5'10"" girl, I could wear this! It was still highwaisted for me!  I didn't have to pull up on the back to make it high waisted and pulling down on the butt doesn't make it stop being high waisted either.  This is pretty thin, so that probably why it doesn't have any shape making abilities.  Also, the seams began to come a part and unravel on the tie in the back.  So, I might get one more season out of this, but for a such a cheap suit I'm OK with this."
3.0,Logo too big but good hat
3.0,Washed the aprons when I first got them and one of the ties came off. The quality isn’t great but they’re not very expensive so I can’t complain too much.
3.0,The inside is a different material inside that is not as soft as the fleece on the outside. The inside fabric catches easily on callused skin.<br /><br />It can be harder to hold certain objects or do certain things with how far off the skin it is. It keeps my hand warm and fulfills my purpose.
3.0,"I love the look and style, unfortunately they fall off my face, slide down my nose and just do not hug my head. I have had to tighten the tiny little screws a couple times but that does not help the fit. The glass is great the vision aspect is great but the glasses are heavy."
3.0,I bought the product because it was compression shirt but there is no compression at all. It looks nice and is bigger that suggested.p
3.0,I returned this jacket. I ordered a large and I normally wear a medium. The jacket runs small and is shorter than it looks in the pictures. I was disappointed because could be very cute.
3.0,On the image it looks teal but actually Kelly green.... plus two of the stone fell off and I had to glue them back. It was simple do so but it was worth I paid for!
3.0,"Broke in less then a week, cute but cheap!"
3.0,Good for the price but I repainted it to add more depth
3.0,Somewhat stiff but will give it a try
3.0,I'm 5'6&#34; 145lbs and bought M/L. It would go over my head but very tight once pulled over. I'll just give to my 12 yr old niece.
3.0,"These are absolutely adorable! I have gotten so many compliments about the uniqueness of them. They fit as they should and I forget I even have em on. The downside to them, the backs don’t screw on easy. It feels like they are cross threaded."
3.0,The handle on the large piece broke after only one use and it was not filled all the way up
3.0,"It was a very pretty color, but the 7/8 size was a little snug for my granddaughter.  I am planning to buy it in a larger size."
3.0,"Le falta ajuste, es endeble el alambre"
3.0,Shirt looks great and fits great. Bad part is that the design peels off after a few washes like latex paint.
3.0,"What you would expect for the price.  Whole units, but not long term objects."
3.0,Looks good but material (feel) not great!
3.0,They were larger than I expected.
3.0,Too large. XS would have been better.
3.0,"So it's a very odd material for one. Kinda... Stiff? And the breast area folds in a very odd way making it look like a collar. It was also snug on my breasts, 36C. Definitely not what I was expecting."
3.0,"I like this t-shirt...but really wish the material wasn't so thin.<br /> The design is cute and I like the color and fit.<br /><br />HOWEVER, for the price, I would have expected thicker material. It's super thin. It's so thin that it leaves nothing to the imagination and will show any bump, bulge, etc. underneath the shirt. Actually, in the right (wrong) lighting, I wouldn't be surprised if a bra will show underneath, for that matter. REALLY thin material. Sad. Disappointing. I wore it once and won't wear it again without wearing a tank/cami underneath. Otherwise, I think it's unflattering. Kind of defeats the purpose of a t-shirt."
3.0,The fit was alright but the cups were strangely low and wouldn’t stay in place. The color was nice though!
3.0,"Even though it fights perfectly, the image of the tentacles looks pixellated. Had it not been like that, I would've given it 5 stars."
3.0,"It's quite small. Fortunately I have small wrists so it works ok.  It is much stiffer than I expected and it looks like it would be soft, but it's not at all."
3.0,"Purchased for a theme party, did what it was supposed to do. Light stretchy cotton mix."
3.0,It was a little large than expected. Otherwise i love it
3.0,Cute but not durable. Delivery quick and packaged well.
3.0,"I loved the light fabric (living in S. FL it’s always hot!) and the cute button details on the front.  There’s a side zipper.  This just barely went up over my thighs!  This runs very small!  When I saw the $98 price, it did not seem like an almost hundred dollar product (quality of the zipper, etc).  I thought this was an Amazon brand.  so, not sure if this is a true Spanx site or what. I have other Spanx products and they’re well made, quality wise and very durable.  Even if I could fit in these, I don’t think they’d make it after a wash.  I couldn’t justify returning these and going up a size or 2 with the price so these will go back."
3.0,"I mailed it back. I usually take a medium, ordered large and it was still too small. But the cut around the arms was too big. Possibly faulty....."
3.0,"I like the design of these glasses, unfortunately they arrived damaged. The ear piece just fell right off, I requested a replacement. Hopefully the new set arrives intact."
3.0,"I just purchased this--I don't see how it has a 'metal frame', it seems to have a thin sheet (maybe aluminum?) inside it, whereas my other backpack I've owned for a while clearly has flat, hard metal 'bars' (sorry, not sure what call it in hiking lingo). I was wondering how this pack could be so much cheaper than others offered on Amazon...you get what you pay for. On the positive side, the pack looks great and has some nice pockets and straps. But my son will use this for hiking for years so I doubt this will take the rigors of youth camping for even 6 months without a true frame inside."
3.0,"I ordered the red which was not as vibrant as the stock photo, still red but for sure more muted. I got the xl size which would normally be a bit large but was actually comfortable"
3.0,"Absolutely beautiful on, only issue is that it does not adjust for sizing so mine was a little big. Still looked amazing!"
3.0,"Tshirt was super cute, but ran big. The &#34;Happy&#34; runs armpit to armpit so it's hard to read and at times looks like &#34;app.&#34; I'm small and got a small, and it was still too big."
3.0,It was to light weight.  I can see through the material.
3.0,"It’s a light weight shirt that can NOT go in the dryer.  The words peel off in the dryer so I had to buy another one.  With that said, it’s my daughter’s favorite shirt.  I would buy it again."
3.0,"Notice that the yellow on the top of mask puts dog face positioned half under chin when worn. Due to yellow part of fabric being so abundant, cannot see bottom of mask, while it is worn."
3.0,The socks were thinner than expected. I don't think I'll be buying these again
3.0,Thin. Doesn't give.  Small and I ordered a size up.
3.0,nice style and material but smaller than my normal size.
3.0,"First of all I ordered an XL/2XL according to the chart. I wear size 16 jeans but have a size 35"" waist nd 46"" hips.  I should have ordered the large. There will be 4 layers of material covering your front. It doesn't cinch in very well like others I've used. The smell is quite strong. It left a lingering order on my dress long after I took it off. I does bend at the butt which prevents the bulky bulges some other trainers have. I sent mine back looking for a better option."
3.0,"As advertised, material is good, fit is excellent"
3.0,"Granted im a big guy, but the jersey fits way small in the shoulders and belly. Nice jersey but order two sizes bigger for good fit."
3.0,I bought a 38 D fits more like a 38 C I would order a size up for sure
3.0,"The dress fit fine everywhere except the waist. The waistband is elastic, but appears to be stretched out so it does not hug the waist as it should. It just makes the dress look like it has little to no shape because of it. The collar and sleeves also looked cheap."
3.0,The material reminds me of the slips I used to have wear with my dresses 35 years ago when I was a little girl.  Quite sheer as well.
3.0,They are alright. There's definitely a gradient in the lens and they are the aviator style. They are just very cheap. They seem like they would bend pretty easy but they look alright.
3.0,"Este artículo tal cual lo describe, aunque me quedo grande, para mi no fue problema porque puesto no se nota."
3.0,Does not look as good as it's photo..<br />Quality is below par
3.0,"Bought this for my ace daughter. She loves the pin and was excited to wear it on her backpack but the back would not stay on, she switched it to her hoodie because she was afraid she would lose it and still won’t stay. I am going to try and find a different back so she can wear the pin."
3.0,"I think these have potential, but they make the earring too thick for my ear. It’s like a tiny gauge, but it’s enough to hurt shortly after putting them in. I’m also not sure why, but my ears burned so bad when I used these. I have sensitive ears, and it may have been me, but anytime I put these on any earrings, they hurt so bad in my ears."
3.0,"The shoes themselves are very comfortable, they really are like wearing socks.  They are light weight and do not require any break-in. However, the metal grommets used in the eyelets began to fall apart almost instantly.  With the thin uppers material used to reduce weight in the boot, a metal eyelet falling out will result in the shoe strings wearing through under normal use very quickly, besides the aesthetics of the obviously missing copper eyelet(s).  While BluPrint says there is a 1-year warranty on manufacturing defects, good luck. I contacted customer service about the problem and their response so far was because I purchased them through Amazon they wanted me to go to through the seller for the warranty - a seller that no longer sells the shoes.  Makes me wonder why the price all across amazon and their own website has gone from $179 to $29.99, and regret the purchase at the higher price."
3.0,I loved the fabric and print of this dress but the cut/hemline on the top portion of the bust was so off it’d be impossible for me to wear it anywhere. Maybe mine was just a messed up one? Sadly returning
3.0,Its nice! The colors weren't as bright as I would have liked.
3.0,"They weren't pink, they were pale orange.  I donated them."
3.0,"Overall, the pants were ok. But they were a little snug. Tight in the legs and hips area.  Had to return"
3.0,Short.  Uber duver short but fit true to size.  Material was decent.  Sewn well.  Had to go back due to length though.
3.0,The stone is beautiful !! But the little adjustable rope it come on.. I don't like. The rope is cheap looking. But very satisfied with the stone part.
3.0,Quality isn't great and the faux buttons were misleading. My teen will like it though.
3.0,"Cute hoodie with nice graphic pieces but the material feels cheap — more velour than fleece feeling, lightweight towards flimsy and shapeless. The hoodie is not going to provide the toastiness like traditional fleece ones.  The material looks prone toward piling and its longevity is questionable. I also found that the zipper came out of the tracks.  Cute but not sturdy."
3.0,"I bought these to hang glass medallions from.  I've had two of them come apart already.  I wonder if they are designed for lighter items, as glass can be a little heavier.  Prior to using them again, I will make sure the part clamped to the cord is a little tighter.  Hopefully that will help with my issue."
3.0,"I like the feel of this but the arm holes show my bra, I don't like that.<br />I don't like buying things online :/"
3.0,"not bad quality but, the ring is small. I couldn’t use it because of where my piercing is in my nose."
3.0,Not bad but definitely not the color I was expecting. I ordered the vintage caramel.
3.0,The size is what I expected and normal American sizing. The material is a thin satin feel. Not meant to keep someone warm at all.
3.0,I love the look but because they dont go under your arms the collar moves as you move and thats annyoing
3.0,"Love the matterial, but the zipper has broken a couple times, easy to fix, but probably wont hold up for long."
3.0,Tried some in in The store first to make sure we ordered the right size.  I have found they run about one full shoe size too small.
3.0,"NOT ideal for women of larger bust sizes. I grabbed a medium but unfortunately, it just didn't fit right on my boobs."
3.0,They broke after two months of light wear. The screws were loose to begin with and didn't last.
3.0,The band started to untangle. Not good quality. Not real obsidian stone
3.0,"The fit was great and the band itself was very comfortable to wear.  The problem I had with it was it coming undone from the watch itself.  If I hadn't been wearing long sleeves, it would have fallen off my wrist.  Not sure what is wrong with the fastener."
3.0,"Though I've decided to keep the suspenders, I probably should have sent them back. The straps on both sides in the front throughout my first day wearing them kept popping off when I went into my pocket, or reset myself after a bathroom visit. The holes for the straps are too long or wide or something, but it's very scary and frustrating to be walking the hallway at work and one of the straps pops off hitting me in the face or flying over my shoulder. And worse in a meeting, but I was aware of the possible mishap, so (LITERALLY) caught it in time before it disrupted a meeting and embarrassed me. I'll have to find some way to tighten the hole (no pun intended) before I wear them next. Love the design."
3.0,"The back pack, lunch box and pencil holder are beautiful and serve their purpose. However the strong chemical smell was overwhelming until we dry cleaned and aired it out prior to them being used."
3.0,"Beautiful,  but waaaaaay too big. Ordered an XL which was to my measurements, but it was falling off of me. I turned it into a halter strap so it’ll at least stay on me"
3.0,"Cute shirt, but didn't fit.  I ended up donating it to the mission."
3.0,It's exactly what you would expect.  Very light & casual looking.  Only thing I don't like about it is the white that is inside the collar.
3.0,The bag was perfect for what I wanted to use it for but had a bad smell so sadly sent it back.
3.0,Not for my body shape. It looks like formal dress. Not flattering.
3.0,Product looks nice.
3.0,"I ordered these as a Christmas gift.  They were very pretty, but all three were smaller than I expected."
3.0,"I really like these sunglasses. The screen printed graphics make them look higher end than those vinyl perf glasses. Very cool look, good fit on the face, I'm a female and they fit my face without looking too large (or small). Problem is one of the lenses had a really crooked flag. One lens straight, the other at a 45 degree angle. I contacted them and they were really quick to respond but unfortunately said after checking their entire batch was that way and I could keep them at a discount or return for a full refund. I'm too detail oriented to wear them mismatching and crooked so I sent them back, easy enough and received a full refund in a timely manner. Disappointed but not out anything."
3.0,Love the shirt but way to make a girl feel fat! I usually wear a xl but got a 2xl and it was to tight.
3.0,Very cute but I have to send it back it was too small .
3.0,"One of the chokers broker the first time it was worn. The other two have held up so far. Not terrible, but disappointed with the immediate breakage."
3.0,should have went up a size it was really tight and small. Thinking about returning it but need it for this weekend. I'll reorder another day.
3.0,It's not as big as I thought it would be. But it's beautiful and I think my girlfriend will like it.<br />It came in a nice felt jewelry box as well. I'll be writing another review after she gets it for her birthday. She has sensitive skin so we'll see how that goes. So far so good in my opinion.
3.0,I'm a small to med and the size small was XL on me. So bummed we had to send them back as if they'd fitted they'd have been fabulous.
3.0,"Smell of bag horrendous,  soaked in febreeze, left outside for days."
3.0,These fit small for the large size that was ordered.  I have bought swim shorts like these in the past and large fit better on those styles.
3.0,They fit well but my son does not like wearing these because they are tight around the thighs compared to other brands
3.0,"Really wanted to like this band. However, it would never stay clasped and would fall off practically every night.  Very annoying waking up and trying to find your watch and then having to try to put it back on then trying to get back to sleep.  Save yourself the hassle and get a different band.  If they fix the issue of the clasp actually staying on all night, I would have kept it.<br /><br />Update March 11th:  Ok so when I requested the refund, the seller immediately responded to mu issue and insisted on making it right.  Not only did they refund my purchase price, they also sent me a replacement band.  This new band has the traditional metal prong that inserts into the whole.  The original one I got, the prong was plastic and would not stay in as stated above.  Have to say, the company went out of their way to make it right.  EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE:-)<br /><br />So:  One star for original band that was simply horrible for me.  4 stars for updated band and 5 stars for customer service.  Averge out to 3 stars."
3.0,It is super see through and has thin material. The fabric is not stretchy but the bunches at the wrist  have elastic. The material is kind of irritating
3.0,"I ordered both the black and red one.  The red one is softer and wider, sake thickness.  The red one stays in place while the black one keeps loosening and I must adjust every 10 or 15 minutes."
3.0,"It didn't fit right, but the material was good quality and the customer service superb."
3.0,"I expect very good quality, but not satisfied."
3.0,"It's very thin, and a silky material.  I wouldn't wear it to work."
3.0,Tho is a really warm and comfortable jacket. The stitching is not very good as they missed some areas and left these areas unstitched and the single stitching makes for a possible unraveling of thread later on- I may need to stitch up the jacket myself. Since it was 50% off it’s worth the effort but it would be nice if double stitching was used.
3.0,"I'm afraid I'm disappointed in this band.  The picture showed silver toned buckles and attachments but I got black (I asked the seller, they said it was a mistake that would be corrected).  I opted to keep the band, as it doesn't look bad.  The band is fairly stiff, which I don't mind, and it did soften up over time.  But where they wrapped the band over the buckles and attachments and stitched them down is really scratchy and irritating to the wrist.  I tried sanding the sharpness down with a nail file, but I still find it annoying to wear for any length of time.  So while it's a great looking band, and the olive color I got is wonderful, I find myself hardly wearing it."
3.0,"This shirt has a great quality material.  I am 5'11"" and about 190 lbs, and I purchased an XL.  The top on the shirt is very tight, and almost fitting towards my waist.  I do not like the fitting of the shirt.  I was looking for more of a flow to the shirt.  I would definitely suggest purchasing larger than normal"
3.0,This dress was kind of shapeless. I totally felt like I was wearing a potato sack. I have returned it.
3.0,"I am 5' 8&#34; and normally a size 10/M-L, and this bathing suit was way too short for me! The fit was actually pretty great on the bottom, but the top portion of the bathing suit was about 3 inches too short of where it actually belonged and what it was suppose to cover! I sort of gathered this might be the case from the other reviews but took a chance anyways. The material was good quality though and I really loved the shiny scale print and bright purple top, so I'm going attempt to turn it into a two-piece! So if you're a taller body shape, this probably isn't the bathing suit for you."
3.0,"The fabric is a fraying before I even put it on, but it is on the inside, so no biggee. It is also slightly tight in the underarm area even with the straps all the way extended.  I would have been more upset if I had paid full price for this, but as it is, I bought it on sale, and it is probably worth what I paid for it on sale."
3.0,Ear piece is not interchangeable
3.0,"This dress fits as expected. I'm 5'10, 160lbs, and wear a size 8.  The large fits nicely in this dress.  I do not, however, like the fabric.  It's polyester and not breathable at all.  The thicker fabric makes me hot when I wear the dress.  It hits above the knee and I can dress it up with jewelry for a more put-together look for the office. Overall, it's a pretty blah-looking, non-remarkable dress with not so fun to wear fabric."
3.0,"it looks cool and i like how its light.<br /><br />however, it was way to small to me, so i had to return it.  so if you are like me, a 6'1'', 245 lb dude with a big head, you might want to reconsider."
3.0,Dress is really cute. Very stretchy. Hubby loves it on me
3.0,"They're Nike Golf shirts, so they're the same quality you see anywhere else.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I purchased two of the pewter grey / white shirts, and the ones that I received are NOT pewter grey / white. They are a very light grey color.<br /><br />So, be careful when looking at the pictures. You might not get the exact color you see on screen."
3.0,I like the small one but the longer one is way to short for the neck. The keys sit way to high with the neck lanyard.
3.0,"Fits as expected, definitely no show through leggings.<br /><br />Received one pair with a melted plastic mark, see image. Very unfortunate."
3.0,some work and some do not
3.0,I love these pants and much but this pair was missing the button.
3.0,The shirt style/material is good but sizing is not true to size. Runs small.
3.0,"I bought these and also a set of words from BeadNova in the same style of bead.  These look okay from a distance, but close up they are roughly cut, not polished and the letters are not straight or consistent.  Since I'm making something for myself and I won't be looking that closely at them, I'm okay with them. But, if I was using them to make gifts or for items for sale, I would not be happy with the quality. Since I only recently purchased them, I can't vouch for how well they'll hold up with use."
3.0,Was a nice gift but broke with heavier set of keys attached.
3.0,Liked it but it was too large and I ordered the small:(
3.0,Nice looking jeans but the so called denim material is very thin but very soft to the touch. They also have stretch to them for room to grow if the cloth lasts that long.
3.0,They are not very durable.
3.0,"Nice pants, size guide is not a good US conversion. If you buy this, order up 2 sizes. Had to send this back for a refund."
3.0,It was very cute but way to small
3.0,Nice outfit but it’s very big
3.0,"I really like the shape and look of these solid bar ear crawlers. However, for $21.00, these earrings should not be changing colors or look tarnished after only wearing them a couple of times. I don't shower in them and do not have a sensitivity to the earrings themselves. I'm just sad they are starting to look rusty and crusty."
3.0,It's cute but more of a bathing suit than an outfit. I'm 5'5 220lbs and ordered an XL.
3.0,"It’s a cute and classy color. Great for work professional wear. It did get dirty easily which is a shame, but I did love for what I paid for it"
3.0,"They were on time, but they fit a little to big."
3.0,"At this price I was expecting a bit nicer hat where the crown/top was a bit stiffer and shaped. It's soft material which is great for stuffing the hat in small places for storage but because of this the top portion does not hold its shape. Also, what is the deal with the small piece of flat leather that is supposed to hold the chin straps snugly under your chin. This piece does not work at all holding the hat snug to your head in high winds and becomes loose immediately. I'll use this hat as is but will not buy again in the future."
3.0,Had to send it back. Underwire was sticking out upon arrival.
3.0,Item ripped after some texas heat would definitely not hold up in texas weather.
3.0,"I really like this hoodie for what it's worth it's pretty warm and comfy BUT....... 2 things<br />1. If your a woman the letters sit under your chest Inna akward manner I would recommend moving it up a tad bit but it's not that big a deal for Men (it is a ""men's"" hoodie)<br />2. I wish the hood had drawstrings.. I could get into all the obvious reasons why but.... Would have been nice to actually not have my hood blown off by the wind<br />OTHER THAN THAT  I would recommend  plan on buying the black myself as well ⚫🤌🏾🤙🏽🙌🏽 Also a lot of reviews said it ran small I ordered a large and it was baggy how I wanted I think it's true to size"
3.0,Size was smaller than expected.
3.0,"but they are made really cheap, go to CVS or Walmart"
3.0,"I ordered a medium size as a gift and it was huge, however, the instructions clearly state that one should wash it before wearing as it will shrink to the proper size. I hope it did as my guest returned home and never indicated otherwise.<br />She was pleased when she got the gift as to color, warmth and softness."
3.0,"I wore this at work and the children loved it but I was concerned that it might melt if it touches a pan fresh out of the oven.  I will wear it seldomly so it will last longer, I can't imagine that it would be durable for years of regular use but it is very cute and water resistant for light use! Many compliments!"
3.0,It's a beautiful dress but I have 42DD boobs so it was extremely tight around that area but it was a perfect fit from the waist down
3.0,"I can’t really comment on the fit because a xxl was what was sent to me, which was too large, so my review is based off features rather than the fit of the shorts.<br /><br />This item comes in 2 pieces - the bike shorts and athletic shorts to go over the bike shorts. The bike shorts are made of a nice breathable material and can stretch to fit. The padding is very thick, so if you’re looking for cushion, there’s no lack of it in these shorts.<br /><br />For me, I didn’t really like the athletic shorts that came in the pack. While they are very light, they are almost like swim shorts rather than actual athletic shorts. It is nice that a reflector is built into the back pocket and they are quick-drying, but they aren’t really my style.<br /><br />Pros :)<br />- bike shorts are nice and breathable<br />- thick padding<br />- lightweight material<br /><br />Cons:(<br />- didn’t like the athletic quick-drying shorts"
3.0,"Decent material, not great.  You get what you pay for."
3.0,These leggings are okay. Nothing great. They are pretty thin and have a shine to them. If you have colorful underwear you can definitely see that through the pants. Love the pockets on the legs.
3.0,It's somewhat nice looking but its is a terrible wallet! It barely holds anything! I'm glad it was cheap! Giving it to my three year old to play with.
3.0,"I tried these wearing around the house and they come with 2 different soles one stiffer than the other , problem was my foot kept slipping out of back and was annoying trying to keep them from not slipping"
3.0,"The ears were messed up on the first item I received.  I returned that one, ordered another and the ears were also messed up on that one.  It would be adorable and very cozy if it wasn't for the messed up ears."
3.0,Too big and not very attractive for charms
3.0,My daughter's Pandora bracelet.  She's married to a police officer.
3.0,"I really wanted to love this jacket, but it fits weird and lays funny. It doesn't quite look like the picture. I have a 27 inch waist and the xs was a little baggy. Also it is stiff so thr bottom part doesn't flatter very well."
3.0,Kinda small around the eyes..
3.0,"I have the same style in different colors and they fit like a dream. But this color/leather is too wide; the bands across the foot are loose, my feet slide, and I get blisters. Maybe these would be OK for others. They are well made and beautiful, which is why I gave 3 stars."
3.0,"The design is great. The chain broke immediatly. Good thing, I had another to put it on."
3.0,I bought a large and it fit my daughter who is a small.
3.0,Too hot.  They are comfortable if in a cold climate maybe.  Compression is not very good and focused on the foot.
3.0,"they are ok, but you can see threw them. I don't like that very much"
3.0,"A little disappointed. The sizing is accurate, however it is not as &#34;ruffly&#34; as it looks in the picture."
3.0,"Beautiful boots, but the top/calf was a bit too snug for me.  I could get them on, but no way would I be able to tuck jeans inside.  I returned them."
3.0,"I was expecting to buy a thermal looking product but this is more for sleepwear. I like it tho, very comfy and fits a little large."
3.0,Low quality and the fabric wasn't what I thought.
3.0,the color was not what i was expecting
3.0,"The bling on this is amazing! Best band I have ever bought. Comfortable and sturdy. Love it!<br /><br />Ok, maybe not... it just broke 8 days after the return time frame. Changing to a 3 star."
3.0,These tanks are nice and long for sure but the fit is a little tighter than I prefer and the material doesn't have the give that I was looking for.
3.0,"Cute, less.flowers than the one in the photo and way to small.."
3.0,"They seem slightly bent. One side sticks out on the front more than the other. May have been damaged in shipment, but either way, I don’t really care too much for them."
3.0,Made super well but way too big
3.0,"Three piece solid plastic, non functioning, no loving parts whatsoever. Strap was broken within minutes."
3.0,"I'm 5'5 and this thing fits like a tank top, really cute and comfy though."
3.0,"Not the best dress--it just about covers my hips and that's it (I'm 5'8&#34;), and I did order at least a size up. Might be OK as a dress if you're 5 foot or under. I use it as a shirt, it's very elastic and the fabric is soft."
3.0,Good product just way longer than I thought.
3.0,"Love the design, but the fitting is off. Could do without the liner. Pockets are very small too."
3.0,Poor print image both close up and from a distance and too large. Sadly I bought two similar patterns. Def a knockoff.
3.0,It doesn't have the tan band at the bottom. Was disappointed by that.
3.0,"String doesn't hold up too long. Wore it daily when going out. Had to retire it after about 2 months, so as not to lose the beads."
3.0,Nice sun glasses.  No instructions on how to change the lenses.  All the lenses are a waste.  Frustrating!!
3.0,My friend and I loved it. Our friendship grew even more.
3.0,"It is really good quality. However, It came down a little past my knees! For reference, I am 5'1 and 118 lbs. I would have liked to be a lot shorter, although this is a regular problem for me, being 5'1."
3.0,I don’t know if I will keep it. It’s so thin and see through. I need a white golf shirt but would love to have one that doesn’t show the color of my skin.
3.0,"Not as described. It's solid black, does not have the pink centers. Quality is just ok"
3.0,Was hoping for softer material than what arrived.
3.0,Not as pictured at all. Material is think like a light weight sweatshirt.
3.0,"it's cute but it will untie in washing machine, and i have no idea how to tie them back like before,"
3.0,The neck is snug but besides that I liked it
3.0,"The bag is well made, I bought it because I like big bags , unfortunately I found it uncomfortable to carry."
3.0,Ordered 18 to 24 months.  Looks like 4T or larger.  Size label reads 100.
3.0,"Loved the design. Didn’t like the shade of pink. It looked a lot lighter than the pink I received. It is a thicker fabric & a unisex type t shirt. Runs very large. I tried to shrink it, but it is still too big. Won’t be wearing it anywhere but home."
3.0,The waist band is very tight elastic so it digs in a bit (I bought the large). I was able to stretch the elastic out by stretching and ironing it and then they were comfy. Otherwise these are cute.
3.0,"It’s not a sweatshirt at all, it’s more like a shirt. Not very warm. I sized up thinking it was a sweatshirt but since it fits more like a shirt I probably could have sized down."
3.0,Runs small I got like a size bigger because of what people said with it running small. The bottom fits pretty good tho a little snug in my butt but the top doesn't cover my boobs at all. It really disappointed me because it owas old have brought the whole outfit together.
3.0,"The instructions to set time/date, etc, as the watch is pictured, work IF you turn the watch in the opposite direction, or just write the letters on the instructions opposite to how they are marked.<br /><br />The watch itself is heavy. If you wear a light material, it will pull down lower than you intend it. Even if you attach it to the collar. I attached it to the collar of a scoop neck Tshirt dress, and it pulled down enough to expose my bra. I just pinned it through the bra, which gave it the stability I wanted. Don't know what to tell you men. Unless you want to start wearing women's bras, you'll have to find your own cheat.<br /><br />The quality of the watch and fob seem pretty decent. Not cheezy. The quality of the pin, although not the worst, is the weakest link and seems like the part which will break first with use. How soon may depend on how frequently you use it."
3.0,Es reloj que me ha gustado mucho en verdad. Lo recibí en mi buzón hace un par de horas e hice los correctos movimientos en la perilla para ajustar la hora y no camina ninguna de las manecillas! Incluso vi algunos videos en youtube de personas que recibian el reloj y al abrir sus cajas el reloj caminaba aún sin retirarles el plástico protector. Supongo que la batería está agotada o no sé. Me abruma porque deseaba usarlo ahora mismo para asistir a una cita. Que debo hacer para que el reloj funcione?
3.0,Too small.  The fabric feels nice.
3.0,I’m petite 5”2 . Top made average size 5 “ 5 . Too much fabric for small sized ladies. Jersey fabric. Heavy weight . Good product.
3.0,"I like the idea of this dress, and my husband thought it was nice, but I don't like the way the fabric clings. Also out of the package it smelled like chemicals, like scrubbing bubbles cleaner."
3.0,Love the swimsuit but it wasn't actually size
3.0,Wow oh wow did these arrive smelling like rotting fish. There is nothing to get rid of the smell. Even washing my hands the smell still lingers. They look nice and are soft but not worth dealing with the stench.
3.0,The pin was bent when I received it.
3.0,Seemed to run a little small but very cute - especially for the price!
3.0,"Except for the V-neck wrap bodice, I thought the CHARMYI dress looked so very similar to the [[ASIN:B08LNKWB4R VOTEPRETTY dress]] that I love and have two variations of. So, since dresses are hard for me to find (I'm 4'11"", about 130lbs), I decided to try the pretty Charmyi dress (Floral Black PM32).<br /><br />The fabric is soft and comfortable; however, the fit isn't quite right for me. Some of it may be my build, but not all of it. The back of the neck, at the zipper, gapes backwards and feels odd. It doesn't rest securely against your skin. It gapes enough to give you quite a draft and look weird.<br /><br />The pockets also cause a little extra hip width. I'm always afraid of this with pockets in dresses! Since the VOTEPRETTY dress doesn't do this, I had high hopes for the CHARMYI dress, but the fabric at the widest part of my hips does not lay flat. The extra pocket fabric causes a weird bump that is noticeable and, IMO, ugly.<br /><br />Unfortunately, although I absolutely love the floral pattern, this dress just didn't fit me right, and it doesn't make me feel pretty."
3.0,"Fits well. Nice and stretchy to really hug curves. The material felt almost like a thin, slippery nylon that is shinier than expected which gives it a cheaper look. Would look much better in a jersey knit type material. Because of the fabric, I will not be wearing as expected and it will possibly be used as a swimsuit cover up."
3.0,Runs much smaller than stated. Very thin....not worth more than $10 at most
3.0,"Mask Fog up, what's the point can't see the persons mouth"
3.0,I love the pants but they are very big in the waist
3.0,I gave this item three stars because of the nice details on the guitar. However I'm very disappointed on the gold coloring. It's too intense and makes the pendant and chain look extremely tacky.
3.0,Nothing is left to the imagination with this.
3.0,"i bought a size up than what my kids normally wear and it fit well, probably won't last once they hit a growth spurt though."
3.0,This dress is nice for the price but for someone with a slim frame it may not fit as desired. I like for my dresses to be form fitting and this one was not. Would be much better for slim individuals if it had spandex in the material. Someone with lots of curves could really rock this well!
3.0,Okay. Somewhat small and light stretchy cheap material
3.0,Color is different than expected
3.0,"I'm going to order again in a different color...it fit sort of strangely and I had a heck of a time figuring out the shoulder strap, but it's cute. Lots of ruching in the stomach area made it look a little weird. But the color I initially got-- the gray-- is not flattering at all. It's not even a silver, more just like a flat gray. It really washed me out. I'll update when the pink one comes."
3.0,"I loved the design of these underwear when looking at pictures because I hate the batman tighty whitey kind of underwear for my son. When they arrived they looked as expected with a very nice design. The fit was off though. My son is on the thinner side and normally wears a 2t-3t at 3 years old. The underwear were too tight. Also, the waste band was tight and had an awkward fit. It comes up higher on the sides than the middle. I am really not a nit pick kind of person and hate writing mediocre reviews, however, I just didn't really like the fit of these underwear."
3.0,Love the band but strap to hold band fell off. No good when hanging on everything. Only used it 2 weeks.
3.0,I like the style of the cardigan but the material was thinner than it looks in the picture
3.0,Seemed to be made small.
3.0,"This product runs small. If you're typically a medium, their medium is a size 2. I'm sure they would look good if they fit me. If you're a size 6/7, order the large. Size accuracy may vary, be sure to do your measurements before ordering."
3.0,"The clothes themselves were nice, but the hat was hilariously tiny. Put it up to a newborn hat we had still of my sons and it was the same size. The hair band that came with it for girls is just a strip of fabric that you have to tie yourself, and it is incredibly tiny too."
3.0,"It smells like it was used as a sewer strainer. I’ve washed it twice and dried with febreze and fabric fragrance before it ever went out the door, and it smells so bad still that my daughter is teased about it. I smelled it through the box before opening even.  I have no idea why it would smell like that.  Nothing about it’s construction lends any clues. The bag is cute, so-so quality, will serve its purpose and hopefully makes it til the end of school. But it smells of fecal death."
3.0,Lense was scratched itame was packaged probably not checked
3.0,"This was a pretty piece, but I just did not like how it twisted when the glasses were attached to it.  Not sure if this is how they all are, seemed the 3 I got did the same thing.  Maybe I am just too much of a neat freak."
3.0,Sizes run a full size smaller
3.0,They felt comfortable just too tight around my foot and toes. I recommend ordering bigger than your normal size
3.0,Smaller and cheaper looking than on the pics.
3.0,"The items are very nice, just as the picture shows. And, just as the picture shows, THEY ARE NOT SIDE-SNAP. I will use anyway, but is not what we expected"
3.0,Would have been 5 stars if the edge stripes had been symmetrical. Production quality control issue.  Otherwise a comfortable strap.
3.0,"Liked the fit and feel initially, but couldn't ever wear them barefoot because they got too hot. Also they haven't held up to well. After a year they of intermittent use one has a hole and I've had to fix the stitching twice."
3.0,The ear socks appear well made but are loose when installed.  They spin when on. The nose pieces snap in okay.
3.0,Too small for 12 month old.
3.0,Make sure if you have a larger head that you measure. I bought for my son and it didn’t fit at all. It was way too small. I ended up giving it to my smaller nephew.
3.0,I didn't love the material this shirt was made of. It was soft but almost felt silky instead of cottony type of soft. It fit smaller than I would like in my stomach area (not baggy like in the picture)
3.0,It's pretty and worked for an evening out.<br />Wouldn't wear during the day.<br />Obviously fake.
3.0,"My son loves it  I cannot get the time to set nor the date.  The pictures do change but that's about the most it does. It's for a 4 year old so he is happy, but for the price I expected a little bit more."
3.0,"The top is cute and fits well, but the shorts are not designed properly. A bottom needs to be deeper on the back than the front to accommodate the bootie. I sew so I know how a proper bottom should be constructed. These are equal in front and back of the short so when worn they feel like they are too low in the behind, so I would describe as “showing the butt crack.” Not comfortable. Fortunately I own another navy bottom that will work with this so I kept it. I just wish the manufacturer knew what they are doing. This is a definite design flaw."
3.0,"Bought for my Mom who is 80 years, she loves it."
3.0,"I thought the material was different, but it's a little too small for me.  It's very pretty!"
3.0,Material is thick and stiff. Nice dress overall
3.0,aite.
3.0,"Is a great cross shoulder bag, but the inside really poor, too tiny cloth poor quality."
3.0,Didn't fit snugly as I thought.  Don't support the back as I thought
3.0,"I bought the small and repurchased the medium, the small fit more like an extra small - order up a size."
3.0,La tela se suelta después de un rato de usarlo
3.0,"So I love this bracelet, but I am starting to have a few issues. I bought this bracelet on Feb 13, 2018. I wear it daily as a simple accent, but the chain is just way too long after you tighten it on your wrist. Warning, you can get caught on items because the extra chain hangs about 2 inches, but this depends on your wrist size.<br />The bead that you closes the chain has chipped. I thought this was supposed to be white gold plated, or was that applied to only the chain? I would like to send it back for an exchange, but the reality is I paid less than $20 and its not worth the hassle.<br />Overall I love the bracelet just a bit disappointed that I get caught on items, and the discoloration of the closure bead. But again for the price I am not going to complain too much."
3.0,Okay product. Not TTS
3.0,Lens plastic has defects
3.0,nice belt except the belt kept slipping out of the ratchet
3.0,"Love the color of this dress however I can only give it three stars because the chest area is way big compared to the rest of the dress. Its as if this  was made for someone with a very broad back and because there is extra material that sticks out on the sides of my chest. I am not small chested and fits perfectly everywhere else, so it seems disproportional."
3.0,I ordered the blue. It’s definitely not as pictured. It’s a bright royal blue. Not dark at all. Also the sleeves are gigantic and could probably easily fit both of my arms in one. Not sure I’ll end up wearing it but my husband washed it so I can’t return it.
3.0,"I liked that they were earrings, as advertised. I was a little disappointed that all you could do was wear them or throw them at things."
3.0,"Material is very thin which isnt bad, but size is way off, and top is very short"
3.0,The pictures were nice.... But the fabric pffff super mega cheaply made. I wish they can use a different type of fabrics. It was like 2 size over the normal medium size.
3.0,I bought these to replace an identical pair of pants purchased in person a few years ago. They say they are the same size but are about 2&#34; narrower in the hips than my old ones. Weird.
3.0,"This is way too much maintenance, and I wish I had known before I got it. It’s hand wash only, laying flat to dry. That’s a lot of nonsense for a sweater. It has a nice fit when it arrives and feels fuzzy, but the second you need to care for it, it’s going to go downhill from there, starting with major shrinkage. If you don’t mind high maintenance stuff, then go for it. Me? It’s not something I’d recommend."
3.0,Love it but a little on the big side
3.0,Pretty but it is cheap looking.
3.0,"These work pretty well, & I use them, but I wish I had bought ones that allow you to adjust the length."
3.0,Ok. But sticks to clothes. Not smooth.
3.0,"This is a really cool necklace. I like loud jewelry and this fits the bill. You can tell it's pretty cheap, but it's not so bad that I wouldn't wear it."
3.0,Had to have it hemmed.  I ordered petite.
3.0,Kinda bulky but fits my wrists well. Not sure about the magnetic clasp but time will tell.
3.0,It is almost like a dri fit material not what I was expecting at all. I was expecting more of a normal cotton t shirt material
3.0,It’s a beautiful skirt but the lining doesn’t breathe and it would be too hot for the wedding Im attending in NC. The lining also isn’t stretchy and I need a dress that moved with me when I dance.
3.0,"It is a decent pair of pants, but the fit is a little tight for my liking, I usually go with 30 W but this one was not as comfortable as some of the other pairs I own."
3.0,Didn't fit as expected. Runs extremely small. I had to return it.
3.0,"I have been searching for a white sweater that was light weight and pretty.  Came across this and loved it.  I ordered the ""white"" one, but it is not truly white.  It is off-white/light beige.  Was disappointed, but kept it.  I will definitely wear it, but just wasn't the true white I was hoping for.  I will probably order it in other colors, though.  It is a nice sweater and washes well.  I washed it on the gentle cycle and hung to dry."
3.0,"Definitely ran too large, decent underwear but order a size smaller than normally."
3.0,"They seemed good quality. But seem very wide and about a size and a half larger than they should be. My daughter wears a 12m in just about every brand, and the size 12 was huge. At least a size, maybe 2 larger than expected"
3.0,The earrings is pretty. But  some jewelry the broken. 🙂😕
3.0,"Edges are not even sewn or have a clean finish, just cut fabric. This product was just a cheap imitation for a Tartan to sell to Outlander fans."
3.0,"The top fits great and the quality is pretty good especially for the price but the bottoms are SO cheeky!! If it were a tiny bit thinner it could be a thong. I'd say the top is great but personally I'll only be wearing the bottoms for tanning in my backyard.<br />My sizes:<br />Top- small<br />Bottoms- small, sometimes a medium<br />Weight: 110<br />Height: 5'1&#34;<br />I ordered a medium"
3.0,"There pins are secure by small safety pens and some of the pins are faded. The quality is just ok (they are plastic), I would not give them to children or use them for children things in which might get torn off because they are not that strong of quality but if you are an adult or one that take very could care of things I would say that the quality is ok. For me the size is not too big and not too small...so the size is perfect for what I plan to use them for which is pinning them on bags. Overall they are just ok for me. I wouldn't recommend them but I wouldn't say absolutely not either. I just wouldn't have high hopes."
3.0,"This dress is SO cute, but unfortunately the fit was really weird in the hips-way too big and the cut of the dress in the hip section hit me above where my hips are, so the fabric stuck out and looked really funny. It fit really well everywhere else. I'm bummed because I really like this dress and wanted to keep it, but I returned it."
3.0,"Love the style, looks exactly like the picture, can be worn multiple times, runs very big."
3.0,It's cute but it broke so quickly and got tarnished even faster. :(
3.0,3xl is probably a boys 3xl size. Gave it to my wife and it fit her near perfectly. She's half my size.
3.0,"Pretty glasses but.... the picture doesn't  show accurately. It's misleading!!<br />The front frame is more of a grey/black matte finish compared to the sides. It takes away from the look in my opinion, it just seems off.<br />Second,  it looks like all rhinestones on the sides in the picture, in real there's only 2 big ones, the rest are just silver tone dots with a couple tiny rhinestones mixed in.  That was really a let down. For a high end brand, I'd expect all rhinestones. Also the case wasn't black and pink like in the pics. Made me wonder if these were knock off frames.<br />Now they gotta go back and I'll have to pay to ship them?  I hate when things aren't represented true in pictures, it's unfair to the customer!!"
3.0,She didn't like it
3.0,I brought an a large but it fit like a small
3.0,It runs small<br />Otherwise reasonable
3.0,Thought I was going to really love them. They’re soft and great compression in the belly area. Only the threading unravels quickly. So they won’t last long.
3.0,"To me, these socks feel a little cheap. The fabric is thin. The fit is baggy in the foot area. The toe seam is bulky and I'm afraid it would cause discomfort on a long walk. That said, the pattern is cute and would add some fun to what is otherwise a boring segments of my wardrobe: brown."
3.0,Too large n thin
3.0,"Anti-glare?  Definitely.  HD vision?  That's a stretch.  My eyesight is actually sharper without them.  But they're nice looking, extremely affordable &#34;extra&#34; sunglasses."
3.0,"Fit is larger than I wanted, despite following the measurement guide.  It’s also very thin, stretching fabric ( like jeggings).  They also don’t wash well and the material has puckered all around the distressed/ripped sections.  I personally don’t find them very flattering."
3.0,"its SUPER CUTE, but sady I had to return it because it was too big, and I could imagine it would get wet and be soggy and hanging on me. I am normally a sixe 12 and got the 4XL according to reviews.<br /><br />its well made the scalloped edges are TOO CUTE!!!<br />great suit overall :)"
3.0,"Much, much smaller than expected. Good for a dainty ear. I wanted more bold. Sure, maybe I would have known if I had looked at a ruler, but I did not. I bought these to dress up some larger studs I have. The drops on these are barely big enough to make a difference for the tiny studs that are included."
3.0,"No synthetics in these to keep them stable so collars curled after two washings. Don't get a stain on these, you'll never get it out (this is NOT a challenge, just a statement) trying to remove it will make a larger stain. They wrinkle easily and come out of the dryer wrinkled no matter how fast you get them out."
3.0,Size down. Very big.
3.0,"Bottoms fit fine, top was way too small for my 38 DDD. Had to return, sadly :("
3.0,Great size and seems like a decent quality but it was missing one of the leather ties on one side. Going to attempt to contact the seller and if it is resolved I'll change my review
3.0,Check size looks good!!
3.0,Size 2xl shrunk to a size L first wash. Material is nice however now it my night shirt instead of my husbands Comfy shirt.
3.0,"Very cute sandals.  Fits TTS.  However, the heel is high and puts all the weight on the ball of the foot and there is little enough padding that it was sure to become painful for me.  Really wanted to keep them."
3.0,"Good for the price, but if you wear these tight like a US Marine does they will pop off. And some of us know what that feels like"
3.0,"The shoes are a beautiful color. However, I have narrow skinny feet and the right shoe seemed as if someone stretched it out before. The shoe is a bit wide for my foot. I really like the shoes overall. I hope the right shoe shrinks a bit around the foot."
3.0,Cute shoes but size was.off.
3.0,"Its really a small little bottle :( my daughter got some of this fairy dust when she lost a tooth, but she dropped it and the top broke off :( I think the bottle needs to be a bit bigger for the price."
3.0,"LOVE THIS SHIRT, love the quality! Worth it, would purchase again!"
3.0,"Fairly decent compression for the price. Sleeve needs to be available in a longer length. I am 6&#34;1&#34; with very long arms, the sleeve goes from my wrist only to about the middle of my biceps."
3.0,There were several pages stuck together.  A few even ripped as I was trying to unstick them.
3.0,The fit is a little frumpy... and i don’t love the material.<br />But it’s good quality
3.0,It looks great and is vey quiet BUT my watch is over an hour off after eight hours on the winder. So I'm not going to recommend anyone to buy one.
3.0,"I didn't love it.  It seemed to large not very figure flattering.  The fringe was bright white and shiny.  Honestly, it looked kind of cheap and like something my grandmother would wear over her pj's."
3.0,"The  only reason I gave this purse a 3 instead of a 5 is because it's just too small for my needs.  The color, quality and style are worth the money so if you're looking for a SMALL purse, you would be happy with this purchase."
3.0,I like the color combination. The least is: the croch is not wide enough. I will have to wear shorts with the suit.
3.0,**update** this company has great customer service. They are working to correct the issues and gave me a discount for the inconvenience.**<br />Fits great! My only complaints are that it came with NO instructions and the replacement screws it came with are not the right size. I was glad I had decided to keep the little screws that came with my Fitbit!
3.0,ran a little small but they are nice.
3.0,"I was happy I received it so quickly!! Really enjoyed the personal touch fro<br />Unfortunately, the bottom's part we're a little too loose in leg area.  I tried to adjust the ties in back and halter to lift breast coverage more but couldn't get it to fit appropriately. Just seemed that the cut wasn't right. Im 4'11&quot; and have short torso so expected it to fit better. Plus it was rather baggy between bottom of breast to naval."
3.0,"The picture shows a heathered red shirt. The item I received is solid red. It's fine and a nice shirt, just not what I thought I was getting."
3.0,"The clips do the job, but only a few times. Several lost their spring after just one or two uses--hanging a banner on a fence for 1-2 hours. So the clips look nice, are very lightweight, and you get a lot. But don't expect them to be long-lasting. I also carry a couple spares with me when I'm planning to use them, in case some break."
3.0,It’s pretty. And it’s flowy and perfect with skinny jeans as it sits right below the waistline. BUT... I ordered a medium and the attached sleeve have an elastic band that left marks and squeezed on my arms. I could handle it for a couple hours but ... super tight attached sleeves. I’m 5’5 and weigh 120.... it’s not a weight issue the shirt has oober tight sleeves.
3.0,The t shirt is very cute however looks alittle small for a 3T.
3.0,Was not the shoe in the picture
3.0,"Sort of small for my face - I'm a aware I have a big head. Lol! But the bridge over the nose could be a bit wider; that would solve MY problem. Sturdy enough quality, but I likely won't wear. Looks to awkward on me."
3.0,These say the bar length is 10mm but are 8. Other than that they are cute and easier to get in than screw ins.
3.0,Small fits more a large very baggy and moderate coverage on back. Color is nice auburn burgundy color
3.0,The blue is for SW planes. I the first time and it worked. I tried to use it again on another flight and it did not work. I'm taking another trip in a few days we will see what happens.
3.0,For a Convention at a Arena that require clear tote bags.
3.0,Good quality super soft. Awkward fit. Wide set straps and awkward gapping around armpit.
3.0,I purchased one in December and 2 of the strands became undone. i tried to retie it but was unsuccessful. i loved the necklace and couldn't fix it so i ordered another one hoping it last s longer. got lots of compliments when i wore it.
3.0,Couldn’t use it for what I needed (picture day) because the skirt was wrinkled and I didn’t know got to fix it because the skirt material was like meltable on both sides
3.0,fell apart rather quickly....
3.0,It's more like a beige. And that cheap cold noisy fabric.
3.0,Good pajama dress
3.0,Nice top. Pic shows longer than what it really is. Still a nice muscle shirt.
3.0,Short stems.  Too short for my lobes.
3.0,The paint on the beads was smeared when I got it.<br />How ever the cow print is very cute.
3.0,"Lord was this hard to assemble! There were times when I was ready to just throw them away because they were so tedious to put together. They’re plastic on one side and glitter on the other so it was so hard to bend it get the tabs into the slots. Once assembled the hats are pretty narrow. I was using them as unicorn horns for centerpieces so they were perfect for what I needed but if you’re looking for a hat this may not be for you. Also the hat does not stay together really well once the tabs are in the slots. I stapled it together to add some added security and they looked great. Overall, the product looked great but was a huge pain to put together."
3.0,Im 5'1 and this is kinda long but I like it.
3.0,"Doesn’t look as cute on bigger bodies. Also, the color is more bright orange than coral .. I wear it to bed instead of out as an outfit."
3.0,"They are really beautiful earrings, but they tarnish."
3.0,"Not as cute as the online picture. The large fits with no wiggle room so the medium would have been  way too small. The material is thin and have holes and not  just scuffed  marks as I thought. Overall, it’s kinda cheap looking but you get what you pay for I guess."
3.0,"I bought these for my husband, but I tried them first. I have compression over-the-calf socks in predominantly cotton, and they take a little work to get on, but these were nearly impossible. They left red bands on my legs after only a few minutes of wear. I recommend spending more or getting the crazy colored compression socks that compress without strangling."
3.0,"I am very disappointed in the selection of colors.  I got duplicates of some and none of other colors.  No gray, brown or purple.  I also only got 11 instead the dozen that I was supposed to get.  Next time I'll try a different supplier."
3.0,I like the dress but it’s extremely see through. I wish I would have ordered a darker color so I wouldn’t have to layer as much. I’m 6’0 and the “high” part reaches just above my knee.
3.0,I like the color and thickness. The only issue (which is a big issue for me) over half of the masks were missing the bendable nose piece in them. They wouldn’t stay in place and kept going up into my eyes.
3.0,Not my favorite pair of Rocket Dog slippers I've ever had but still nice for the price.
3.0,Didn't dislike it was to small
3.0,They were worth the money they are just kind of big so it feels like the fabric covers my entire face up to my eyes. It does have adjustable straps but the actual piece of fabric is big and it's darted so it sticks out a lot. Which is great for giving breathing room but it just looks so huge!
3.0,"It is really cute but comes off too easily. I lost mine twice. the second time I wore it - I lost it and then found it. The third time, I lost it and never found it."
3.0,"Hat looks great, but smells so bad.  It smells like fish, so much so that I'm having to dry clean it.  If I touch the fake fur my hands smell like fish.  I have no idea why it would smell like this but it's really bad."
3.0,the fleece inside of the hoodie comes off<br />buy the champion reverse weave instead
3.0,My granddaughter needs to see my lips when I’m talking due to being hard of hearing works well for that but a little condensation builds up
3.0,I ordered a medium for  my 5'7&#34; 165 lb  C cup frame.  The waist band fit very well and was comfortable but the cups are way too small (size A).  I'm afraid if I order a large the waist will be too large and ride up.  Sadly I must return a comfortable fit band (which are very difficult to find because the cup is way too small.
3.0,"The shirt is fine overall, the image however you can tell was a blown up computer image that was stamped onto the shirt. It probably won't survive washing every time worn."
3.0,"Hello, I received my nomination energy copper but it was a little bit bigger than my size, I was disappointed about the colore because it was a lot lighter than the picture..."
3.0,"This was something that I was really excited about. I have never tried a screen protector that was made of glass before. So I was hoping it would work out great. It didn't really. The sensitivity of my screen went down tremendously. It worked great for protecting my phone's screen but I couldn't do much of anything with it. So I wouldn't really recommend it. At this point, I'm not sure whether to try again with another brand or not."
3.0,Doesn't look like the blouse from the picture. It's straight cut below and not the assymetrical cut.
3.0,Like but their sheer wanted thicker so bought better.
3.0,It bought this i lost it within a week! The little knob at the end is very small so it comes out your nose piercing easily. But i receive a lot of compliments when i had.
3.0,Once the stap is set up properly the loop it forms is too small to slide my hand through .
3.0,"I like these leggings as they feel super soft,  great deal and colors. I chose to keep them but i dont like that they are NOT cut higher in the back than the front, to cover the booty. Everywhere else fits well and the front is the right length so I feel like i got the right size. For the price, I'll tolerate it but wont likely buy more."
3.0,cute but too big
3.0,"These watch bands fit well and have colors as advertised.  Unfortunately, they smell.  You have to leave the bag open for a long time to let them air before wearing them.  It doesn't go away quickly."
3.0,"the drawstrings look fine and as described but when they said 28 pieces I thought they meant 28 drawstrings. That should be clarified in the description, it is a little misleading. Other than that I am satisfied with my purchase."
3.0,Nice necklace. A ltitle on the cheap side.
3.0,This dress is a nice design but too clingy! And it’s see thru. So it was a let down for me! Not for one with a belly.
3.0,"They are very basic, and they co.e off the bracelet very easily."
3.0,It’s okay.  The lace is a bit much for the event I plan on wearing this dress to
3.0,"I’m a size 7, and I got the small/medium (which is the smallest option available), and they are way too big; you can’t get the toe and the heal to both fit right right at the same time without a lot of uncomfortable bunching in between. I would not recommend these to people with a size 7 foot or smaller."
3.0,"Material was thin and had to get it tailored, was a bit too roomie ( but that could just be personal taste) fit great after getting it fix to liking"
3.0,"I should have read the description more carefully.  For me, the pendant is too large and the chain is too long.  Also, I thought the main part of the pendant would be a clear crystal, but it is actually a mirror.  Not the look I wanted :("
3.0,"The bust area was too small and I couldn't zip it.  It fit well in the arms, waist, and length. The style and material was nice."
3.0,Nice bag so far...haven't had a chance to use the bag yet...but apparently this review is too important to wait for me to actually use the product. So take it for what it's worth.
3.0,They turn your finger green very quickly but are beautiful.
3.0,"the legs are not as long as then look, ordered nude and got red."
3.0,"This is a nice wallet.  However, it has sections for coupons, receipts, money, your iphone, and credit cards but once you put these items in, the wallet will not stay closed.  The wallet should have had an accordion feature on the bottom to expand as the items are put into it."
3.0,Great jacket but sleeves are way too short
3.0,"The pieces started falling off the necklace before I even had a chance to wear it.  I didn't expect much for the price I paid, but was surprised when I pulled it out of the bag and one of the beads had fallen off."
3.0,"The fabric is really soft and thick. Great shirt for someone who's lean or slender but if you're curvy, you'll probably end up looking pregnant!"
3.0,"Length good, feet small and my daughter is a petite 8.  The zipper jammed and won't go down right out of the gate.  I want to return them but my daughter wants them.  I hate dealing with returns.  If I was say, would I order this again.  A definite NOPE."
3.0,The shoulders were way too big
3.0,I should've knew sizes of the ball could've been a little bigger
3.0,"This bracelet is so cute and I get a lot of compliments on it. The only problem is that it's way to big and feels heavy on your wrist. But other than that, it's a great product and I recommand it."
3.0,Love the shirt but runs very small. 3X is closer to XL/1X.
3.0,I loved the colors! My son enjoyed the look while he had to wear a mask but they material didn't stretch or hug the face plus it rolled when it was tight. Disappointed :(
3.0,the ear pieces pinch the sides of my head and are uncomfortable.
3.0,Nice scarf but it wasn’t gold. It was orange!!!
3.0,This mask is pretty good for the price.The latex is a more blueish color and a little thin but other than that a great mask!
3.0,"You can hardly see the paw prints, and colors are full. Not good quality at all."
3.0,Very seethrough
3.0,Not cotton.
3.0,"They felt very soft, very small"
3.0,This would have been a nice skirt but it runs small. I normally wear a small...so I ordered a medium and it was still too small. I couldn't wear the skirt on my hips due to the zipper on the side. I had to pull it all the way over my stomach to zip it which took a way from the length. I suggest ordering a couple sizes up if you really want the skirt.
3.0,I love these earrings!! My only complaint is that I was wearing the plain pair and I now have a lost earring because the connection of the earing is very lose. Im sad I lost the earring because it was my new favorite pair!! But ill buy again and squeeze the connection to ensure it won't just come off again before I wear them.
3.0,"Just wasn't for me. They came with extensions but didn't improve the other dislikes including; #material itself was too soft, #narrowness made it look even smaller, #offered no support, #clear straps nowhere near long enough to keep from rolling. Pretty, just not on me lol..<br /> control"
3.0,"Reasonably good quality and is just wide enough for my fat head, but the temples are too short, so they dig into my ears a bit.  I still wear them... but my ears are happy when I take them off."
3.0,They are just like normal socks !!!
3.0,"I am a medium in everything, and ordered the large, and it just fit. It was so short (I am 5’ 7”) that I thought my butt was going to be hanging out all night. Not many feathers."
3.0,Its nice but i thought it would come 2 separate ones
3.0,"Pros: The color is exactly what I expected, and it has proven water proof. The pockets are helpful, and the lining detaches easily. Cons: The recommended sizes for women appear to be over estimated. I have returned it once because it was significantly too large with the size suggestion. The zipper is somewhat difficult to begin. Even though I have only had it for about a month, the material of the zipper is already starting to rip and fray."
3.0,"The pants’legs are too short to be rolled up as you see in the picture. They are about 8 to 10 inches shorter than expected. The pockets are small. The fabric is mostly cotton, not particularly soft but ok."
3.0,The outfit is cute. The ears started to peel off DURING the birthday party I had to remove the peeling ears from the outfit but the 1 stayed so we continued on. The headband was too cute.
3.0,Too small and too thin. I wanted it to be a light coat for fall but it is too light for that even. It was too small for me to even button up. I have it to my 11 year old. It should fit her in a year or two.
3.0,Good quality material but too large
3.0,It's a nice watch band comfortable to wear looks good but it doesn't allow the fit bit to work completely at night for registration of sleep.
3.0,"This was adorable, this seemed unusually well made for the price, the design was lovely and there weren't any pulls in the embroidery, the fabric was smooth and subdued<br /><br />I happily wore it for a few weeks and it fit my phone, passport, cash and cards without looking misshapen. I live in a large city and when hauling groceries for a mile or more it's just more convenient to carry a wristlet than a handbag. It received several compliments.<br /><br />And then, at an outdoor sporting event attended by several hundred thousand people with what seems like 10 bathrooms - the wrist strap broke and it flew from my wrist and slid across the floor under a stall just like a Tide commercial. The other ladies in line gasped in horror right along with me.<br /><br />But I might actually get another one and reinforce the strap because the look was just exactly what I wanted, and even after hitting the concrete floor my phone was in perfect condition.<br /><br />If you like the look - and have basic sewing skills - it feels like it could last a season or two which is ample for the price."
3.0,I have an average size head and this fits very tight. Gave it to my son.
3.0,It broke the first day not sure why
3.0,"I wish that this pack came with two different colors instead of two of the same colors, but I knew that when I bought it. The dice are so small. You can’t tell that they are dice unless you look really close. They mostly just look like pink squares. They are still cute though and I will be wearing them. Also they came packaged in a cute burgundy bag, which was a nice touch."
3.0,Okay so the shipping was really fast and the glasses themselves are great but they are tight on me. I'm sure if I just took them somewhere they could adjust them but I ended up just giving them to my daughter.
3.0,Cool design.  Went with the &#34;American&#34; sizing but it still ended up being too small.
3.0,"EDIT 8/3/17:<br />I changed my star rating from 1 to 3. I contacted the seller and he basically just said &#34;it's Amazon's fault, here's the number to call.&#34; It wasn't very helpful but I truly enjoy the purse. I would have enjoyed it more if it was in perfect condition and had all the pieces promised to me.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />First of all just let me say that i love the design and material. However, my purse did not come with the little Irene Lee Deadpool keychain. At first I thought it was just a misleading picture but I saw pictures from other buyers that had it. In addition, the inside of my purse was kinda dirty. It had flakes of... i dont know what, some brown paper or leaves? I was most put off by this one sticky pink stain and this one other stain that has left a hard spot on the inside of my purse now. I see pictures from other buyers and i think i might  have just gotten unlucky. If the sellers will rectify this i will update my review."
3.0,It's a lanyard. Nothing fancy. Kind of cheap stitching at the joint. Definitely not going to use it for anything more than keys and an ID badge.
3.0,These run large. Do not size up as suggested.
3.0,"They look great, and authentic. But fitted a bit too large. Be sure to have tried this kind of lenses before and double checked the sizes."
3.0,It serves the purpose that I purchased it for!
3.0,"The bodice fits well, but the shoulders It seems you must have broad shoulders to make the top work properly"
3.0,This dress was pretty. The fit was awkward. The top was too large and the straps were not adjustable.
3.0,Not wide enough in calf...i ordered extra wide and they still did not fit
3.0,The smallest height discrepancy was too tall. The quality does not fit the price. I was disappointed.
3.0,"cute good quality,"
3.0,"I liked the idea, and wanted to love the dress but it was too tight around the next to be comfortable in it, had to return"
3.0,"I rated three stars due to the item not matching the description, but it still being decent quality. The picture shows a more matte cotton-like sweatshirt while the one received a a much darker color that is a polyester “shiny” material. Also, there are no metal rivets at the holes where the red accent threads come through at the pocket. This will likely become a sweatshirt my daughter will want to wear more often than when dressed up as Vanellope, and I’m pretty sure there will be an issue with ripping if the metal rivets aren’t on those accents. Will see how easy it is to return."
3.0,"Cute idea, runs very small."
3.0,Was not what I thought
3.0,It is super cute looks exactly like the picture but two sizes too small
3.0,Very nice. Fade quickly
3.0,"These are nice underwear, if a bit tight around my thighs...but cyclists in Seattle cannot long have thin legs, so these might fit better if you do not have &#34;beefy&#34; and disproportionately large thighs.<br /><br />The lines are cute, with a nice visual framing of, well, the fly area. Not quite as obvious as the tiger-sexy-underwear-man-style (or eagle variants), but more than the traditional Hanes monochrome.<br /><br />They are soft and have not shrunk when washed, other than to &#34;tighten&#34; back up after being worn and stretched for a day. I will continue to wear them, as they are good underwear. Not the best, but quite good. And colors that are more than the usual grey /navy blue /black /white."
3.0,"The top is nice, it's defenitally what I was expecting, and I dont have a big chest, so it covers everything comfortable. But the shorts are so big, they make my hips look huge and very unattractive. I'm 5'5 and 150Lbs. I bought the medium, and it isn't too tight. I maybe try buying a different style again, this time be sheIn"
3.0,"For me to get the loose look I want I’m usually medium/large in bottoms... I would need to get xx large. I got large and fit perfect as tight jeans. They do run smaller than usual just keep that in mind. Again, baggier look, don’t be afraid to order two sizes more"
3.0,"Very cute top, but it is longer than I expected and can't be front tucked due to the shape. Will be cute with leggings and to sleep!"
3.0,"I should have listened to the other reviewers.  These are very out of proportion.  The pants are huge and way too long even for a tall person and the drawstring had to be cut in half it was so long.  The top is very short and tight.  Overall it looks crazy when you put it on but since it is buttery soft, comfortable (after some adjustments) and very easy care I still gave it 3 stars."
3.0,"The fabric and look are nice but the zipper isn’t very good.  You have to be careful when zipping it but otherwise it’s a nice light, themed jacket."
3.0,"color is just as described,  but fits small."
3.0,"I ended up returning this tie as I thought it was going to be more of a purple color, but was instead more of a magenta/pink tone. It was pretty, just not the color I was looking for in my wedding party."
3.0,"Terrible zippers!!! The wimpiest zippers I think I've ever seen on anything. Otherwise, it has great size and the material is good for the price. The red in the Marine Corps logo is actually peach color (very wimpy looking)??? For about ten cents more, they could have used MUCH better zippers, charged me $5 more and I would have given it five Stars (and THEY would have made more profit). Fix the zippers, fix the color and I would recommend this all day!"
3.0,11year cool 4 dance class.
3.0,The sewing/sticking was not so straight
3.0,The top left of the flag is so close to the seam you can't really tell it's the Greek flag
3.0,The robe is good but the size Large/extra large is way large.
3.0,I wasn't expecting it to be mesh . . . .
3.0,"Cute belt, but it ran small. Had to return."
3.0,"Good not great, but I was getting them more for the look than quality. Fun suit when I want but wouldn’t wear it regularly. The elastic could be more comfortable."
3.0,Like the look but had to sew the straps. They are not well attached.
3.0,Too small around the calves but the material looked great.
3.0,Muy Delgada para un reloj tan grande y pesado
3.0,Shipped fast was just as expected<br />Holds all.my stuff with space to go<br />But the clip was short lived
3.0,"my fault, i ordered the wrong size so they are so  so big, i will pass them on to a friend otherwise they are exactly what i wanted i just have to order the smaller size"
3.0,"I've been searching for the perfect mask like everyone else right now...<br />This one didn't do it for me either. This is so soft, which is nice. You can breathe through it and it's comfortable BUT if you've been wearing 100 masks like I have then you've run across one (or 10) where you're breathing the fabric into your nose when you inhale because there is no structure to it. This is the only real downfall to this mask, otherwise it's pretty great. (if you aren't looking for an N95)"
3.0,I liked the quality of this pajama and how light it was but the size mentioned isn't correct so make sure whatever size u wear normally you ordered one larger. But overall it's a good quality pajama
3.0,I assume they used a childs drawing as a pattern. Seriously misshapen. They are soft though.
3.0,"Weird color on my face, but still can be cute on the right complexion person."
3.0,"I thought this was going to be a red color like the picture, but it's more of a blood orange. It's still super cute, the sleeves fit a little funny on me. I thought it was going to be an off the shoulder top but the sleeves are a little more complicated than that."
3.0,One of the shoes had a broken xipper but I am able to slip it on and off so I can still use them.<br /><br />Very warm and a good price.
3.0,"Nightgown; fit was good; liked the material, but I did not like the packaging or presentation when received. It arrived in a “ baggie type” container, and the gown is very wrinkled. I wanted it for a gift, but I just kept it for myself. Price was good."
3.0,"Don’t recommend for a curvy slim type of build.  They fit in the thighs & glute area,  but way too large in the waist.  You can roll the stretch waist band and fold over,  but then you can’t use them for tucked in shirts or bodysuits."
3.0,"On the plus side, these are cute, larger than I expected and nicely loud.  The bells are loud enough that I can hear someone touching my keys throughout the house. The problem is in the construction of the bell.  The metal of the bell is quite thin and the seams poorly soldered.  One of my bells has popped.  Also the chain is crap.  A bell fell off almost immediately.  Fortunately, I found it and reattached it.  I don't think this will take abuse well and will come apart fairly quickly.  Sad, because I do like this."
3.0,Purchased these for around 30 bucks. They felt pretty good on. But they came In a crushed box and in a flimsy glasses nylon sack. I have purchases 10 dollar sunglasses that came in better/safer packaging.
3.0,Things where too loose around my head and wouldn’t stay on
3.0,It's ok but it kinda rides up
3.0,looks cheap. but works good in room after shower.
3.0,Arrived quickly. Too small which is too bad because it looks sharp
3.0,"This is a nice portable hat that can fold up and go in your pocket. It provides a high amount of sunblock so that you can be protected from sun exposure while outside. I feel that the hat seems rather warm to wear; I don't feel that the material breathes very well. I had a similar cap by the same company that was made out of cotton and had some ventilation panels in the side, and I feel that one was a little bit more cool to wear. This one fits a bit on the tight side, and the actual hat is not as tall. With the smaller amount of headspace I just feel like it traps in the sweat.  I was also a little disappointed with the color, it's a bit on the dull side of more of an olive green than a spruce green color."
3.0,Ehh way too small for a large. Ended up giving it to a friend.
3.0,Cute but didn’t fit me well. I returned
3.0,The dress looks very nice.  Shame the top is a bit small.
3.0,"These shoes are cute, however I can't rate them higher than 3 stars, because they run TWO SIZES too small. I usually wear an 8, but I ordered a 9 as flats on here tend to run small, and I can get the 9 on my feet but it's extremely uncomfortable. I'm going to order the 10 and hope those fit..."
3.0,"I ordered as a gift for my 4 year old grandson, he likes 'helping' in the kitchen. My disappointment is the chef's hat was not included as advertised. Instructions included with the apron noted a form has to be completed and mailed inorder to get it."
3.0,My daughter wears a size 14 and the 14 fit perfectly.  The length was good and it opens up at the bottom more than I expected.  The issue for us was that the colors were very dull.  If you like the vintage look then this will work but I (and my daughter) prefer vibrant colors/looks.
3.0,The color and fit is perfect but material is horrible. Wasn’t expecting all polyester
3.0,This is very cute and I love the extra gift
3.0,This brand is the most comfortable for me.
3.0,"The net part seems large enough for the stone I wanted to use it for, but the opening is way too small to put it in."
3.0,Fabric is a bit catchy and stiff so I returned it
3.0,These look great but feel light and cheap. The vertical metal part has bent on one in normal use and I was able t bend it back but they feel flimsy.
3.0,The dress was not true to size. Material was very thin. Not flattering at all. Looked as I was wearing a diaper.
3.0,"Great suit , only fits right with all my upgrade accessories , not with supplier accessories."
3.0,This dress actually hit really low on me. It almost goes down to my ankles at its lowest point. Not what I expected. And I’m not short. 5’6”
3.0,It last me only a few weeks. Had to me make new knots.
3.0,Shipping was quick. The scarves are comfortable. It would have gotten 5 stars if the filters would stay in place. They easily shift out of position.
3.0,The shirts run extremely small......I wear a ladies large in all my tops and this is what I ordered.  I can only wear these if I wear it like a shell under a blouse.  Quality is outstanding but sizing is not accurate.  I would have bought a size larger if I had known they run that small.  Would definitely order these again if I could be sure of the correct size.
3.0,"I used this wig for my Luka cosplay in 'Just Be Friends' and honestly the curls looked like a wreck. They frizz very easily. It was way too thin and in the end I just ended up cutting off the curls. It is true that you can see the wig cap if you style it to the left side, but I styled them so they were going across rather than to the side."
3.0,"It's a great print, good quality, just runs a little big. My &#34;standard&#34; bikini size is a medium, I ordered a small.... bottoms are a little loose to wear I'm worried how well they will stay on in the water. Top fits OK, but I think I could return and exchange for an extra small and it will still fit.<br />For a general Cupshe Brand review...<br />Every bikini fits different. It's a little frustrating.<br />I have a medium Cupshe, fits great!<br />A small Cupshe, fits great!<br />This ones a small and I'm debating on exchanging for an extra small..... and I'm not an &#34;extra small&#34; girl by any means. I'm typically a medium.<br />For reference: 5'5 130lbs 34c, normally a 6 in women's pants"
3.0,I can't understand these high reviews even though I believe these are great shorts. You cannot find many inexpensive shorts with a 5th (coin) pocket. THE PROBLEM IS THE SNAP BUTTON BROKE OFF ON BOTH PAIRS I PURCHASED. I have ordered replacements but I expect the same results. And because I love these shorts I will continue to replace them as long as Amazon permits. Until I get tired enough to sew on my own button. That inconvenience makes this review at best 2.5 stars.
3.0,"This is the 2nd blouse I purchased from seller(same item, different color) Unfortunately, this one was has a different blend of materials. The white one was 95%cotton & 5% spandex which felt comfortable and draped nicely. The blue one is only 35% cotton 40%polyester &5%spandex. It's very warm and not as soft. I will just keep it and not wear on warm days."
3.0,"This bracelet was so so pretty, until it tarnished about 3 weeks after i bought it. Is no fun if it doesnt last."
3.0,I'm not a fan. I didn't use these for working out. Just to wear and on a hot day it made it so much hotter and they just soaked up my sweat and the shirt felt hotter and wet. Not exactly comfortable.  I would never wear then to work out in if them make me even hotter. Wont buy again
3.0,"Ok so it wasn’t too small. It has tons of stretch, good when you are plus size but online other dresses I bought on Amazon it didn’t have that stretch/control thing, just the stretch. It didn’t look like the picture because it was not made as well. I’m disappointed because it’s a gorgeous style. I understand you get what you pay for but there are fabric on here that hold shape better for this style of dress. And just as cheap. The construction was pretty bad too ( see photo) but fortunately that’s on the inside, but best feature, the bow , in this fabric is not holding up like the photo. It runs on the large size and although I went by the measurements it’s too baggy for a form fitting style of dress . On the plus side it came in the mail so fast I could of sworn it was the next day! If you like a loose fit, and are a big girl, you might like the roominess . It will Ned support garments underneath for me because this fabric shows everything but I tend to wear them anyways. I’d probably still buy this dress if it was cheaper . As it guys I might clean it up myself on my sewing machine . I guess I’m just spoiled by the other dresses I have bought on Amazon in the same vintage styles an price range"
3.0,"The fabric is polyester light material....It's not Cotton Blends as it written in description.<br />I wear medium size 6 and I order a size Large. If fits well and hides my belly bump .<br /><br />If the fabric was Rayon, it would be 5 stars.<br />I'm 5&#34;3 so the length covers my knees, 'I'm cutting the white bottom of the print, to fit above my knees."
3.0,This is a huge sweater and I was hoping for it to be a little less large and blanket like.
3.0,3 stars only because the placement of the pad.
3.0,Wife did not like the rough material.  The bust line felt weird to her too...<br /><br />Item was returned.
3.0,I like the sturdy firmness of the hat but it faded in color almost immediately after wearing it a few times.
3.0,I love these earrings but their a little thick looks weird on my ears
3.0,I like the pocket watches thought they are not exactly as pictured.  They are silver in color and with a ball type chain but I am still happy with them!  I didn't receive them as soon as I would have liked and almost thought that I wasn't going to receive them at all! Took well over a month to receive them.  Once I received them I was happy with them and especially for the price. I would have preferred them to be (look) as pictured!
3.0,"It’s cute but it’s SHORT!  I’m 5’1 and ordered a small. I can’t possibly wear it to work. Maybe I could get away with it with leggings, but not sheer tights."
3.0,"This sweatshirt is ok. A little too boxy for my liking, but not terrible. The fabric is soft (in a cotton kind of way...not like a fleece) and comfortable, and it washes just fine. I washed it on Hot with like colors and dried it on High Heat...no shrinkage. The fit isn't super flattering, but it's warm. I personally wouldn't purchase this, but I wouldn't discourage anyone else from doing so either."
3.0,"The product photo shows the waist hemmed in with a fitted look. That is not how the shirt actually is, it's more squared."
3.0,A little tight in the arms but good quality.
3.0,This is too small their 4XL is not even XL
3.0,"But I tucked the ear pieces under my hat and they stayed on fine.  I got them for a halloween costume.  Other than the fact that they were too big, they were great.  Not something I would wear every day though."
3.0,I loved this purse but a strap broke just three months after my purchase.  I didn't overload it either.
3.0,"The outside of the ring was good enough, the inside was what you would expect. Not anything you'll wear and pass down in your family, probably not even something you'll wear. But it's a good gesture for a Dr. Who fan."
3.0,"Really cute apron.  The fabric is different from the usual apron material. The ties are rather short as in you won't be able to wrap and tie in the front.  My biggest pet peeve is when a description of the item blatantly lies and this one did.  It clearly says ""with pockets"" but there are NO POCKETS. If you look carefully at the photos, it shows a wrinkle where the pockets should be that kind of makes it look like it but no picture of the model actually using the described pockets. That's a big deal with an apron. I likely wouldn't have ordered it if I had known it didn't have pockets, especially with the short ties so there's no way to hang a dish towel within easy reach.  It's inexpensive enough, but not worth it due to the pockets.  It's a cute style and the pattern is quite pretty.  That is the only reason I'm giving it a 3 star rating."
3.0,"The delivery was fine, overall the shirt appears to be well made. However, this is not what I would call heavy cotton. That gives the false impression it is heavy or thicker, it's not it's actually very thin. I would probably not purchase another one."
3.0,Definitely smaller then expected but I still try to wear it from time to time.
3.0,cute but they are made out of material that is very stinky.
3.0,"Perfect size for a teenage girl for school.<br />Doesn't want big or heavy<br />So perfect to carry school ID, money for lunch and of course her cell"
3.0,Falls apart after a month of daily use
3.0,It's a bit bulkier than I that.  I haven't taken it on a trip because it uses up more space than I want in my carryon.
3.0,"The pink is more of a pepto pink, which was really not what I was looking for."
3.0,This skirt is very cute and looks more expensive than the actual cost. Unfortunately at 5’4” the skirt was just too long for me and I had to return it. Great for tall women!
3.0,Not great quality buttons- don't think it will hold up too long.
3.0,"Low cost, low quality and size fits smaller than expected. Liked that the padding was removable, but had to return due to the size"
3.0,"It's okay. I love the mocha color, it's a very pretty gray-brown which was exactly what I was hoping for. The length is good, a tiny bit short for my liking but I will still wear it. I'm 5'5 120lbs and I got a small, it comes up to my belly button and ends a little bit before my fingertips. I don't suggest ordering up! really, don't do it. the worst thing about this skirt is DUCK TAIL, it's TERRIBLE lol I figured out how to stop it which is to have the front of the skirt pulled up more than the back and have it at a very specific length. If you have a larger than average butt or hips I'm sure that will help."
3.0,"They look good, and appear to be well made.  But they squeeze the sides of my head (medium guy's noggin) too much.  The pressure causes a slight headache after 10-15mins.  I'm used to wearing avaitors, which of course have a thin wire profile behind the ears.  These retro shadesare not comfortable to wear...going back to aviators.  Also, and it's a small complaint, the &#34;made in china&#34; lettering on the inside is huge, which is a turnoff."
3.0,"I love this bracelet, but it’s to big and I got it on the smallest it could go !!! And it don’t stay in place"
3.0,When u order a xl u expect the sleeves to b xl also. Sleeves were just to darn tight. Otherwise nice top
3.0,"Fun toy idea.  We purchased to be bird wings for our son to use playing dress up.  The wings have a bit of detailing on them that is glittery.  Glitter was not mentioned in the description that I saw on Amazon or on Magic Cabin's website. (where I ordered them from)  They are a good toy idea, but the glitter makes them less 'boy-ish"" and also we persoanlly do not allow glitter in our house. So that is a complete deal breaker for us.<br />The price is fair and the item is decent, but it doesn't suit us at all.  We will have to donate them to preschool or something.  I wish the description had mentioned glitter.<br /><br />If you don't mind glitter, then go for it.<br /><br />hope that helps."
3.0,"High volume boot, needed to add a footbed to take up extra space . Boot fits well now ."
3.0,"Lace wasn’t sewn on all the way, otherwise it’s good quality."
3.0,The money clip is way too tight.  It's too much of a hassle to put in and take out bills.
3.0,They are a little bigger than expected and compression is not as compressed but not bad for the price
3.0,Good for social parties. Bad for moving around with it.
3.0,They were much thinner than the photos appeared. They tore pretty easily. But we stayed kind of dry in Florida’s midday storms.
3.0,"The image shows her wearing a sheer dress that looks like a chiffon material, however the dress you are actually ordering is fully stretchy t-shirt material. I followed the size chart EXACTLY and even though my waist was one inch bigger than the size XL, i went for it... I received it and the waist is THREE inches too big. The length is nice and covers you up, but the backside of the material is white. I returned this and have sized down hoping it will work. I will update my review when the new size arrives.<br /><br />Because of its stretch, I recommend sizing down."
3.0,smaller than they looked
3.0,Fits too short. Not good quality
3.0,"Loved the dress!  My butt is large and shapely and because of that the back will ""ride up"" when I walk. So instead of returning it, I gave it to my daughter and it looks great on her.  I need a larger size."
3.0,"While I like the dress, it doesn't look as nice as the one in the photo. By that, I mean that the photo makes it appear that the material is nice and the dress is a bright blue.  I feel that the material is &#34;so-so&#34; and the color blue is nowhere near as bright as the picture.  It's definitely not worth the money."
3.0,"Good strap, buckle quality not great. Hard to get end of strap through buckle wish cause fraying. I had to melt the end strap to stop this."
3.0,Bottom crystal piece changes color to copper very quickly. First two weeks of having it.
3.0,"Feels very very cheap, but it does the job."
3.0,"Beautiful top. The lace is decent quality. The only thing that was disappointing was the lining of the bust area was wayyy too small and wasn't sewn in, so it constantly lifts up. I find myself having to reach under the blouse to pull the liner down like a weird flap for my bust 😒"
3.0,"They look great on, but some of the balls were very hard to unscrew the first time.. One I had to take pliers to."
3.0,"These earrings are real cute, no doubt. However, the description says they're &#34;plated&#34; -- what exactly are they plated with? It's definitely not rose gold. I have sensitive skin and my ears had a reaction to these earrings. If you need nickel-free, do not buy. I swapped out the backs for some clear plastic ones and painted the stems with clear nail polish so I could wear these on Halloween, and it worked out, but I'm bummed I had to &#34;fix&#34; them."
3.0,"It's a very pretty belt. However, the sizing is a bit off.  I ordered a Large to fit 33&#34; to 35&#34; as recommended, and it is very snug.  Could have used an extra large."
3.0,Was much to small
3.0,"Bought a large and a medium for my 7 year old son. He usually wears a medium.<br />They were both huge. The hoodie came exactly as pictured, and it is extremely soft. But it's so big it will be at least a year maybe two before it will fit him."
3.0,The bandage material is flimsy.  The straps are weak. But the dress is comfortable besides that.
3.0,Beautiful. They run a little narrow. Had to return them. Very sad about it.
3.0,"This skirt fits as expected. It is a bit too puffy but if you like that style then it's fine. If you're looking for a slimmer look, then I do not recommend."
3.0,"The fabric and quality seemed fine, but it was just too big and sloppy.  I returned it, but I haven't received my refund at this writing 12 days later.  That is troubling."
3.0,Chain was way to short
3.0,"Loved the look. It survived me wearing it all day at work, then when I went to take off before bed, it fell apart in my hands. I gave it a '3' because it looks as pictured, and it lasted a day."
3.0,Quality is OK.<br />Not perfect fit for Nokia Steel. It does fit after pushing it. &#34;Quick Release&#34; is low quality
3.0,It lived up to its hype when I first received it. I fiddled around with the nose piece and adjusted it to my face. You may very well need to do that as I think it sits too far off one's face as it comes from the manufacturer.<br />The Photochromic feature plus the Polarized feature works very well. I loved these features as it protected my eyes from the harsh sun.<br />The one thing I dislike is that it got scratched when it fell on the pavement. Granted it was a rough drop but the glasses got scratched. If you get these glasses be very protective of them.
3.0,Order up. But cute set
3.0,"I do enjoy that it has pockets and the material and make feels sturdy, just go with another color than the grey one!"
3.0,I have returned it because I did’nt like the quality of the fabric
3.0,Nose piece fit perfect. Can't get earsock on as is way too tight
3.0,I wouldn't buy it again
3.0,well. I bought this so I could keep it in my pocket wherever I go but it broke within a day.  I still use it though until I find a stronger one.
3.0,"The shorts seem fine, the pockets are large, now if only I could wear them. Since they were drawstring, I bought a size up from my normal (bought 2X) since I figured if they were too big, I could tighten the drawstring to wear them. But I should have gone up 2 or 3 sizes (3X or 4X) because I can barely get these over my hips, let alone have to tie them. So buy a much larger size than you normally would or you’ll be out of luck."
3.0,"I loved the print itself it’s really adorable. However the hoodies quality is less than exceptional. It’s soft on the sin side but the strings for the hoodie are frayed and not melted or sealed at the ends making is easy for them to come unraveled during wash cycle if not careful. It runs extremely small. I’d recommend sizing up twice if you like them with room, if you like them slim fitting size up once."
3.0,"Pretty, but if you're looking for it to be seen on your ear it's maybe 6mm long 3mm wide, 1mm stone (barely can see).  Nice post, but pictures are very blown up."
3.0,The top fit and bottom fit as expected. However the shorts feel weird and were not comfortable.
3.0,It turned my wrist green and it looks dingy after a couple of wears.
3.0,"The quality of this ear cuff was good, it was really uncomfortable to wear."
3.0,For the price a a great top
3.0,"It’s very cute, but not necessarily flattering. It kind of looks like a moo-moo. Lol. Size down. Also, my bottom half felt very “exposed” because it’s so loose and flowy? I’m a teacher and would not have felt comfortable wearing it at school, so I returned it, unfortunately:"
3.0,Fit well but pockets are too shallow and narrow.
3.0,"The cloths is not the best, but it fit me wonderfull."
3.0,I had mistakenly thought that there were positive messages on all of the wristbands but unfortunately there wasn't.  My bad.  I had gotten them for my grandkids and they are adult size so too big for their little wrists but they still liked them.
3.0,Somewhat cheap construction but to be expected for the price also need inserts as they do not provide much support.
3.0,Not flattering for me in abdominal area. It does not show my curves. Instead I look boxy.
3.0,"This is my 2nd radio controlled watch from Casio that doesn't sync with wwvb.  I am well aware of radio wave behavior as a ham radio operator. Could simply be a function of my location (Tucson, AZ). Therefore I am not impressed"
3.0,The size of the rings are huge and bulky. They work well and are in good condition but they are bulky. All of them. If your looking for subtle this is not the set of rings
3.0,"The elastic band is 1/4 inch wide, not much stretch, material poor cotton quality."
3.0,"Very soft and comfy! Be careful though, these leave black skid marks from the bottom of the slippers. Wish they wouldn't of used black rubber for the bottom of these:/"
3.0,Thought it was 2 earrings.great for a a youngerb persons
3.0,"Love the colors and the warmth, but it is a little tight in the chest and hips and a little too long."
3.0,The end flap gets caught on everything.  Should be made to be tucked inside.  Comfortable fitting and  light weight.
3.0,"No belt, huge. I usually wear a larhe because I am busty, but their xlarge is huge. Get the large if you are a 10-12. Also get a strapless bustier."
3.0,Cute but large fits like large
3.0,"I have them adjusted to where I like them.  They keep my uniform shirt tucked neatly all day...and... they are comfortable!  Comfort is a big plus.  Occasionally though, one of the clamps will disconnect.  If the grip was a bit stronger then these would be five stars!  I have the foot loop version."
3.0,Material is so then pantd ripped at bottom while trying on .jacket is cute had to just wear it alone since the pants are worthless
3.0,When I received these earrings the posts were badly bent. I was able to gently straighten one but as I was straightening the second one the post snapped off. Luckily I make jewelry and was able to affix a new post. The earrings themselves are really cute.
3.0,"it's silk, ok, but not as fine as I expected. I prefer a finer twill. It's a just price, but if you like finer ties, you must pay more."
3.0,"The fabrication is awesome, waist is too high in my opinion, returned. (I have a literally flat stomach and 24” waist- this created a weird illusion of a stomach on me. Might be fine if you already have a tummy?)"
3.0,"I want to give 4 stars because it isn't your typical cheap jewelry but I can not get pass it taken 7 weeks to receive, so only 3 stars."
3.0,"Broke first time worn.  Yet, the chain is very fragile. It is very nice, otherwise"
3.0,Feet hurts after working out
3.0,cheap made n overcharged. I returned.
3.0,The tips were blue and unlike the picture... It was blue in the dark but then under the light it is fully brown but then to my step mom it looked black?
3.0,It is pretty thin and the strap has to be tied on one side. The tie cannot be hidden. It feels more like a swimsuit coverup than a dress. It is mediocre at best.
3.0,So Im sure this product might be good for someone out there but I was specifically looking for a coat that was NOT shinny. The photos of the product show a matte finish so I was surprise it was shinny.<br />It’s pretty thin as well but I think it might be warm. I won’t know because I’m returning.<br />There is a color option of 01 Black and 02 Black so this might be the issue of matte vs finish. I think I ordered the 01 as it was the first and didn’t see the 02 until after I received the product and researched the product more to see if I missed something.
3.0,"Quality fabric and construction.  However, the sizing runs small."
3.0,"Love the sweatshirt, but reviews said it runs large. I wanted a baggy comfortable sweatshirt so I got an Xl. It’s comfy but not baggy as a person who usually buys medium."
3.0,I should have gotten a size larger
3.0,"I was really hoping I would like it.  The size fitment was exact, the only problem for me was it looked like plastic.<br />The ring has a plastic look to it.  Not sure why..."
3.0,Loved the color (pink) and feel of this dress! Just didn’t like how see through it was.
3.0,cute and simple. Great for wide fingers. Do not purchase if you have skinny fingers. Shipping took forever!
3.0,These are ok. I thought they'd be a little longer and somewhat softer and thicker. I just pull my sleeves down more.
3.0,Before even wearing one of the shirts the hem was already undone.  Another shirt had extra material that was poking out due to poor stitching.  Really disappointed in quality.
3.0,"These are very cute and comfortable, and fit as expected.  However, once I started going into the (extra-chlorinated) hot tub, they faded from navy to gray, while the swim top I wear (from another manufacturer) retained its vivid color.  I would still recommend these for beachwear."
3.0,Purse is nice but very heavy. Many compliments.
3.0,"Ordered 2 packs of small, one came about 2 inches longer than the other pairs. Not go good fit, they run large also."
3.0,"Generally alright for the money. Fits decently and has a good stretch. However, the ruching in the middle creates a weird wrinkling effect across the belly that I'm not crazy about, and for some reason that area is almost baggy. Also, it came out of the bag smelling STRONGLY of incense. Like the inside of a Light Years or a Spensers Gifts from back in the day. I washed it, which means I can't return it, but I wasn't able to wear it for the reasons specified above."
3.0,Love the sweater but the lights quick working the first night. ☹️ May be sending back
3.0,Returned them. they looked really cheap and felt flimsy.
3.0,"Too large and too thick, but soft."
3.0,"I normally wear a large, so that's what I ordered and it was too small. Order a size up."
3.0,"Very cute but black stuff rubs off, especially under armpit"
3.0,"Sequins are white and gold, not red and gold like in the photos"
3.0,"These are great, and my daughter absolutely loves her new “fairy” outfit. My only issue is - there is literally glitter EVERYWHERE. I love the look and the quality is as expected. I’m docking 2 stars for the amount of glitter that is now coating my house, car, and crawling 10 month old son."
3.0,"Great Looking For Wife , But Too Heavy to Carry Around"
3.0,"Very soft material, flows very nicely. The only down side is if you are busty. I'm 42dd and not only did I have to leave the buttoned part open it was stretched as far as possible. A tank top under was my resolution"
3.0,It fits true to size for me and I have an athletic lower half. The top is a little big on me. I don’t like the material it doesn’t feel like your typical swim material that stretches a lot.
3.0,"I stand most of the day for work and decided to get a few pairs of compression stockings - I ordered about 5 pairs from different companies on Amazon. These ones are really well made, are very stylish, and offer what seems to be better compression than most of the other ones I've gotten, but the foot is WAY too big. I wear around a 9-9.5 size shoe (womens) and have big calves, so I went with the medium (there is no 9.5 on the size chart) - but the foot/toe/heel is actually baggy and bunched up when I put on my shoes. I couldn't pull it up more because of how it is designed. Given the small size says 4.5-9 shoe size, I worry that will be too tight/small. It's too bad because the rest of the sock is great and I love the color/design."
3.0,"The product looks exactly like the pictures. Good material. I haven’t washed it yet but when I do, I will update my review regarding shrinkage. Ordered a size up in hopes that it will grow with my son for 2 summers. Not the case. Son wears a medium short in men; ordered a large and it fits like a medium...lesson learned. Will buy product again bc it a great deal. I will just buy 2 sizes up."
3.0,Somewhat cheap looking if your paying close attention. I wouldn't care and would wear them if they looked ok on me but it turns out they are not my kind of style for glasses.
3.0,"Not the easiest interface to navigate through, but it’s meant more for entertainment than functionality. My 7-year-old loves it, so that ultimately makes it worth the purchase."
3.0,"Be advised that this bracelet is extremely strong and firm, such that bending it to (a) get on your wrist and (b) be the shape you want is quite difficult.  Once it's on, you should be prepared to keep it on.  This is definitely not a bracelet to be taken off and on.  Because of that, I cannot recommend it, even though it is attractive."
3.0,"This is much smaller than the picture made it look.  It seems to be a little flimsy, I hope it lasts more than a week."
3.0,"This is a very lightweight, thin, button-down dress shirt. The material is a polyester type, which feels to me almost like ""Seersucker"" material without the texture. I machine-washed it on cold and hung it to dry, as I don't want any shrinkage.<br /><br />I ordered ""Light Blue,"" and the online picture looks light blue. However, what I received is mostly white with tiny/thin light blue stripes for an overall ""white"" look. Still okay, but not as pictured. My husband says this would be a light, cool shirt for warm months. It could be worn casually, untucked with sleeves rolled up a little, or even with a suit and tie for more formal occasions.<br /><br />This size Large shirt was ordered for my husband, who is 6'1"" and 200#. He usually wears size Large. This shirt is way too tight behind the shoulders, uncomfortably so, but fits him okay elsewhere. So my teenage son, 5'11"" and 160# who now wears size Large shirts, tried it and noted same issue. It obviously fits a bit looser all over on him (and sleeves slightly longer), but still felt too tight behind the shoulders.  My photos include some of my husband, and some of my son.<br /><br />Overall, this button down shirt is okay, but needs more room in the shoulders. Probably should not be described as ""Athletic Fit, Muscle Dress Shirt,"" as it doesn't have room for shoulder muscles. Removed 2 stars for the odd-fit and the color not as described. Thank you!"
3.0,"I just wish this was a drawstring or a couple buttons instead of velcro.  I like wearing skirts to work in the summer, but by mid-day, I'm constantly adjusting the velcro on this item.  It slides or slips and almost falls off.  I bought the proper size, it's just that the velcro doesn't stay flat to connect.  Plus as other reviews stated, if any of it is exposed - it can tear up a t-shirt."
3.0,Love the color but seriously it is way to difficult to bend and I have no end caps to fit. Where can I get large enough holes endcaps?
3.0,Lovely pin but broke the first day I wore it. Am keeping it though because it is pretty and will see if I can use it as a pendant.
3.0,"The shiny color is paint on light grey plastic, so if it's in for rough use you can expect scrapes to go down to the light grey plastic.<br /><br />Other than that cosmetic weakness it's an f91w.  Don't hit the face on a rock and it could run for a decade (though the band would not last nearly that long)."
3.0,"the costume chokes me whenever i bend over or sit down. a bit wide around the waist area, and has extra material on the sides of the hips. if i knew how to sew then i would make it fit better around, but i don’t sadly. if i were to get a size up, it would be too big so there would be no point. the cape is good. on the part where you snap it to the costume it hangs weirdly on the sides but it’s fine. i also can’t fit the end around my shoe, so i’ll just have to wear it tucked into my shoe around my foot. the crotch area is a bit baggy. i’m planning on learning how to sew a little bit so that i can fit it more to my shape. otherwise i guess its a good costume."
3.0,The top fit great bottoms to big other then that it's nice has good support if your blesses
3.0,God quality but runs small
3.0,"In the box you get the watch in a nice presentation case, a quick start guide, a warranty guide, and a small metal maintenance tool.<br /><br />You can do nothing with this watch—you can’t even set the time—until you install the Armani Exchange app, which means filling out the online forms, providing all kinds of personal information, especially marketing/demographic and contact information.  This will work for any other connective Armani items you have or purchase.  I do not like this aspect.  I understand connectivity for the sophisticated aspects of the watch’s functions, but I really do not like the fact that I cannot get this watch to do anything whatsoever until I download an app and cough up my personal info to be used for marketing purposes.<br /><br />I did not download the app to make this watch go.<br /><br />The watch face is rather small, which is not currently in fashion.  The hands are the same black color and shiny finish as the watch face, which makes it hard to tell what time it is with a quick glance; you have to tilt your wrist to and fro to get some glint to see the hands’ positions.  There is no second/sweep hand.  The inset dial has numerals that are so small that they are difficult to read.<br /><br />The watch band is a nice black and red, catchy and yet subdued in design.  “Armani Exchange” is emblazoned on one end of the band, somewhat tacky.  And the “A|X” logo is on the watch face as well.<br /><br />Documentation: There is a quick start guide in 20 languages. The text is small but not too bad, and adequately describes what you need to do to put this watch into action and to access and use its features.  Almost all of the watch’s functions are described on the phone app, and not in the quick start guide.  You get battery changing directions, and then a ton of regulatory and safety gobbledygook, pages and pages of it, in 19 other languages.<br /><br />The warranty booklet is more than twice the size of the quick start guide, and goes to great length explaining what is covered and what is not.  You get a physical address in Texas and one in the Netherlands.  You also get a US URL for reference.  There are no phone numbers to call, no email addresses to use if you have questions or problems.  I’m guessing the app has more to offer to communicate with the manufacturer.<br /><br />Price: This watch comes in at approximately $175.  That’s pretty expensive for a watch, so it had better deliver on all kinds of neato performance.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you’re willing to sign up for Armani’s system, and all of the people they’re going to sell your information to, then get this watch and be both stylish and technologically sophisticated at the same time.  If you want to have a cool watch that quickly tells you the time, another option, analog maybe, at a lower price, may be the way to go."
3.0,"I love the look but it runs small. I wanted it for a Christmas gift. I opened it up and looked at it and knew it wouldn’t fit for spring. So I gave it to use for fall. The baby wears a 18 months now and I ordered the 2-3, it fits perfect now."
3.0,The product is fine but the Rubber bands wear out too soon. Plan on buying extra bands or other goggles.
3.0,"Medium fits well and I'm 6'3&#34; 180#.  Quality seems very good for such a reasonable price.<br /><br />2018-01-30 Update: Since wearing Nike Pro tights a bit more, I changed my mind on Drskin.  Drskin must be pulled up way to high in order to achieve any level of support for your boys.  Think waist band above belly bottom high--not pretty.  Nike stores often discount their pro tights to the twenty+ dollar range."
3.0,"While not my favorite piece, it works. I can wear it with a black suit coat for work, which is my goal for clothing. It is long enough to reach my knees and I am 6 feet tall. The white section is a little shorter than I hoped as it ends just below the chest, but it still works. I did get complimented on it, so that's a plus."
3.0,Didn't fit like I thought
3.0,The inner sole was lifted at the edges when the shoe arrived. The size is a bit big. I usually wear a 9 and it's pretty loose with this shoe.
3.0,Beautiful flowy pants but they run to small. An XL fits like a medium. The seams were also poorly sewn together.
3.0,"I could not get the posts/tails in my earring hole. It was insanely frustrating and when was finally able to reach the hole with the tail, it wouldn’t go in without hurting. I’m not trying to stretch my holes…"
3.0,nice cap with bug screen on top may not protect from sun burn. Gave it to a friend
3.0,The fabric was heavy and they didn’t fit well.
3.0,"My daughter loves these pjs for the characters, and I am lucky I ordered what I thought would be the larger size because they run very small. There is already a hole along the seam of the body, but she is 3 years old and not easy on anything."
3.0,Good product had some extra material from the mold between the toes gad to trim off for comfort
3.0,A little shorter than I wanted but overall a nice dress.
3.0,"THis is a great casual dress, but if you are y’all and we’ll endowed - skip it. I’m 5’9” and a 36DD and it was quiet snug up top and about an inch too short. Sad to send this one back"
3.0,"Pretty top, but it made me look boxy. The sleeves were tight, but the bodice area was very roomy."
3.0,The glasses are nice but the screws keep coming off.
3.0,Base on the size chart I buy a xl it fits yea but the arm s are too big. Am a size 12_14
3.0,I usually wear small or medium but when Amazon recommended xl I figured it ran super small..so i followed the suggestion. It was huge so I bought a medium and it was still big. After that i didn't bother.the material seemed good and the cut was nice but I dont have the time to keep trying sizes.
3.0,"I like the metal frame, but in order to include their designs they had to add extra screws. I've been scratched by these screws and my hair constantly gets caught. The UV protection doesn't feel very good, there's no polarization or dark tint. For the price listed especially, I wouldn't reccomend these glasses."
3.0,This is for teenagers.  Juniors sizing.  No stretch.  So my 15 y.o. is enjoying it.
3.0,"Buena calidad, me quedo mal. Posiblemente no observé bien las medidas"
3.0,I like that it came with a gift bag. that it was well made. I didn't like how small it was.
3.0,"The belt was a bit thinner than expected, looks good nonetheless but lets see how long it last"
3.0,Smaller than it looks but nice!
3.0,It was supposed to be black but it's a grey and transparent color if stretched you can see the lines going up and down. From the waist it started to unstitch while I was putting it on.
3.0,"The printing is nicely done, the material is super soft and overall it is a good tshirt. My complaint is that the neck hole is huge, causing an awkward fit."
3.0,"Don't know how to rate it via stars bc it was waaaaay too large. im 5'2 120 lbs and the dress swallowed me in a small. i would have to pay for the bottom to be hemmed and the midline to be taken in, or i could just return it. wish they had a size smaller. well made fabric though."
3.0,"Pretty cheaply made, and there's an engraving on the back of the photo frame which surprised me. I got the Keychain for my husband, and it wasn't very manly..."
3.0,"Looked nice with my gothic style halloween costume, but pieces came off in shipping and had to be glued back on before I even wore it. You do get what you pay for with this product."
3.0,"I'd been looking for oval silver hoops for everyday wear for a while. When I saw these earrings, I took an instant liking to them.  Another review stated to pay attention to the size dimension.  That is so correct.  The earring are very nice, but, too big to wear every day. Really strong and sturdy.  I think that they are a bit on the heavy side.  If you like big oval hoops, get these as they are really cute.  If you are a small hoop wearer, these are not for you."
3.0,"Item is extremely small.<br />Returned for bigger size<br /><br />Has a shiny sheer to it my husband isn't crazy about, but we are giving it a shot"
3.0,It's a cute top. I really like it.
3.0,One of the bows fell off after only one use. Seemed to be good quality so I was surprised.
3.0,great gift and she liked them perfectly
3.0,"I bought this to wear over different clothes, since it gets cold in my workplace. It's very thin, so everything shows through it. So, I have to wear dark colors under it. I also don't much care for the material. It wrinkles easily and just looks kind of sloppy. It's warm, though."
3.0,"The orange is far too neon & the fabric is stiff. It will have to be washed quite a few times with a fabric softener. I originally bought it for my housekeeper’s pup, but she didn’t care for it either. It’s okay; it serves its purpose."
3.0,"These didn't work for me at all, oh well."
3.0,These are cute for photos but don't really work as sunglasses. Decent quality and cool vibes though!
3.0,Cute shorts.  The under part is a little too short and doesn’t really show.  The fabric is nice and they are a beautiful color.  Took forever to get though.
3.0,"Too Tight & Too Short, I reccomend ordering 2 sizes up."
3.0,The quality is not the great
3.0,"Ordered a small based on other reviews. It felt a bit too big for me though. Another issue was the belt that came with it. It would be nice if there were belt loops and the belt is a bit too skinny and looks odd with the dress. Im 120lbs, 32b, and 5'4"
3.0,"The black mask had fus on it, we werent able to ise it.  Did not fit well on her face."
3.0,"I purchased the yellow version of this shirt about a month ago and decided to try this one. It fits fine but I’m giving it 3 stars because it by the end of my first ride while wearing it, I noticed it started to shirt fibers starte to fray. I will keep it because of its intended use but I wasn’t pleased to see this."
3.0,"Shipped quick, ring looks better in the picture, but very unhappy with it. Ordered a size 9 for my husband, and it fits me. I wear a 7."
3.0,Okay cute very thin
3.0,"I wear a M in most every shirt  This one looked like it would be tighter so I ordered a L.<br />WOW, it is tight.  Fits like a xl.  Not sure sizing up to XL will be large enough, but such a high quality shirt, I am going to try,.  Will send it back if it is still to tight."
3.0,I still like it and will wear it
3.0,"Over all design I liked, haven't even had it a month and wrnt to wash my hands, bumped it and the loop clip broke off."
3.0,"I like the fabric and how comfortable it is, but It is definitely too short for me. I am 5'7 and the dress hits the middle of my calves. :( (I bought the XXL size)"
3.0,Loved the feel of these but the high waist went all the way up to my ribs and the legs were almost at my knees. I’m a size 10 in everything so I ordered the XL. It fit just fine but too long and tall for my short torso. Im five foot two
3.0,If you are over a size 12 and busty don't get it...it won't fit properly
3.0,the bra padding is a bit stiff... so it's hard to adjust it enough to where it doesn't buldge in an odd way.. it's super cuter though and i did see the same top in the store for almost quadruple the price... still kinda on the fence about it.
3.0,Straps broke easily. I hooked a sleeping bag to it and the straps broke on the first day.
3.0,The pajamas ran small but were very soft!
3.0,"Knot unravelles easily, cord is very thin"
3.0,These shorts are so close to being awesome except for the fabric. I like the fit and the style but the fabric is so cheap. I wish it was stiffer and closer to a cotton or canvas.
3.0,I like it very much...gave to friend it was too loose for my liking....med
3.0,"Material is NOT like a sweatshirt. It is polyester and, in certain light, has a slight shine to it.  Does have a low-quality terrycloth lining so you don't have that polyester against your skin. I've had worse fabrics and I'm considering keeping it, but don't love the fabric. Fits oversize. Cute colors."
3.0,"It’s not “silk” satin, but it looks OK."
3.0,Wish they were bigger but looks  just like photo
3.0,Ordered bigger size and it still fits smaller
3.0,"True color is more of a cream/pink in person, which cheapens the look in my opinion."
3.0,im 5'4 150 and a medium was very snug on me and not long enough for my torso.
3.0,Loves the dress initially but after one wash it ripped in the washer on delicate 😩 Was a little tight in the chest area but I’m pregnant so nothing fits me up top like it normally would lol I would recommend hand washing it instead of machine wash. It may state that in the care instructions but I never read those
3.0,"VERY tight. I’m 5’1” and weigh 100 lbs and the small was so tight on me, so keep that in mind. Otherwise it’s ok quality"
3.0,Bought this for my great nephews first Christmas for photos shoot because of the pandemic. Not sure if it will last season after season but it did work for this season.
3.0,"Not the best, it is small in size, but the strap is not great. will not buy this item again."
3.0,"Looks very cute in the picture, but there is a wide gap in the back which makes not so cute on your feet."
3.0,"The green is not the same as the picture, i am disappointed. The ball behind the ear is a lot bigger than expected. Also they gave me a free pack of elastics instead of the heart earrings. It looks cute.<br />Must take them off when sleeping and showering, it made my piercings a little swollen because you have to be fragile with these earrings."
3.0,"I really needed a wallet but I bought a check book instead because I thought it would work as a wallet.<br />It is OK as a minamalist wallet, but I will be looking for something more appropriate for my needs."
3.0,No 8.5 need more half sizes.
3.0,"It is really nice, but heavy."
3.0,"The dress was really pretty, but was so delicate. I felt like I was going to rip it if I pulled to hard when putting it on. But I got a lot of compliments on it and the elastic waist worked great with my 26 week pregnant belly"
3.0,Feels a bit small. Material is nice but the way it was packed made it wrinkled. I'm not the best at tying pretty bows so I was sad that the bow doesn't come already done. It's an ok shirt. :/
3.0,"I love an orange top, so I was excited to find this top.  Unfortunately, this is unflattering.  I am 5'6"", 36DDD, 170 pounds and carry weight in my belly.  I bought the XL and it fit fine, it was just a bad cut for my body shape.  I liked that this top was long enough since most tops are too short on me.  It was also softer to the touch.  This top showed all my lumps and bumps and somehow made me look shlumpy.  Material is 95% Rayon and 5% Spandex and machine washable."
3.0,Just didn't fit right
3.0,the material is really really thin and clings to the body weirdly.
3.0,Didn’t come with certificate seems over priced
3.0,"It's super cute and HAS POCKETS!!!!! But the quality is so-so. Washed once and already separating the top black from the white part. Also sits a little higher than I wanted, the white part starts just after my bust, not at your waist."
3.0,"It is not exactly as advertised, but helps some at night. My wife uses them more as passenger as it helps some with car front lights"
3.0,Color wasn’t even close. Quality seems good and I lucked out with it still matching my purse so I just kept it but very disappointed as the color was the main reason I bought it.
3.0,Good quality until you wash it
3.0,"Key chain is listed as Script Gray in color, but is BLACK. I bought it because my Mustang is Gray. i'm not very happy about the color, but the key chain is unusual and of good quality"
3.0,"This is a very pretty bra, but not true to size at all. I had to return it. Way too small."
3.0,I Normally wear a large but this is huge. It all depends on what kind of length you are looking for. It is th e arm length that bugs me the most it goes all the way down to wrist and just looks huge. If you are just wanting something to flow (a lil bit) and normally wear a large. I would recommend getting a medium maybe even a small.
3.0,"Show's both these colors as a dark blue in the pictures, but they are both the same color of light blue."
3.0,These are comfortable but not for tummy control. If you are looking for tummy control go for a size or two down because these are not it. The hidden pocket is also very small so look elsewhere if you want a cell phone storage type of pocket. Not bad for the price though.
3.0,I received the red orange cardigan the one that was on sale for 18.99 I guess now I know I order a small I wear small to extra small but this fit was not at all form fitting it made me look like a round big barrel . I will give it away but I will never buy again. I had no problem with the material or the way it look was great but the design made it way to big . Big loss
3.0,Great except this band has metal peice on it.
3.0,"I had read in other reviews that this top was short, but I'm only 5'3 so I figured the length would be fine. Even for my height, this top is too short to be considered a tunic. I like it as a shirt, but I was hoping for something longer. The recommended laundering for this shirt is hand wash in cold water and hang to dry. I was disappointed in that, I like to throw everything in the machine."
3.0,I bought a few of these and Courier people stole some!! Shame on them!! I think 3 arrived. I gave one to my brother and I think he sold it to some female because they loved them so much. I gave one to my wife and I have one as well. I have not issues with this product and quality. Great value for money as well.
3.0,It fit fine but the material is so thin.
3.0,I'm 185lbs 5 feet and I usually wear a size 12/14 or XL and this jumpsuit was a tad big for me. Hoping I can return it for a large or even a medium.
3.0,"Hard to put in my ears, but look nice"
3.0,"pretty fabric, weird sizing."
3.0,"These rings are SUPER SMALL i don't know if they would work in any of my piercings long term without causing the hole to bend. I expected the straight batds to be a little longer too. There's not much space, definitely good for a new piercing at all. Not sure if these are surgical steel but well see in a day or two if my ear is about to self destruct 😁"
3.0,Loved the logo and design. The hat is too large for a one-size-fits-all.
3.0,"I liked that these were thin and light pair of sweat pants, love the logo"
3.0,Lack of a gusset makes it a little uncomfortable.
3.0,Gems on shirt are very congested and look very Crooked
3.0,"They are pretty, but beware, before my daughter could put them on diamonds on the top popped out. She hot glued them back in as these were ordered for her to wear to her birthday party."
3.0,"The material is kind of thin, appropriate for springtime, I would say. What I like about this skirt is the fact that you can make it longer, or shorter, since it rolls up, or stretches down nicely due to the way the sides of the skirt are designed. What I don't like on my body, is that one can see my fatty,  cellulite friendly thighs..,.,,"
3.0,"Love how different these are, but the shine/color sparkle comes off real fast! Like after 2 wks of everyday to school wearing"
3.0,"Overall the jacket works as expected. However the sleeves run short, and the elastic is a bit tight around your wrists and waist. If you think a medium is for you try the large instead, you might like the fit better.."
3.0,Super tight on legs. Recommend starting at lower compression first.
3.0,Fit is on the smaller side but unfortunately I couldn't wear it because it came with a broken zipper.
3.0,"The 35” waist are tighter than the 34” waist I bought a couple months before these.  Sizing is not accurate, otherwise great quality."
3.0,"I have been able to wear these pants a few times now and though they are ok, I am not as wowed by them as so many of the reviews that influenced my purchase. They are soft but just in a typical cotton way, nothing like some of the new fabrics that are amazingly soft. The waist seems to come up so high in the front. Almost like they are made as maternity pants. I really don’t like that high of a rise in pants like this. I certainly don’t have a flat stomach but these might be more well suited to someone with a larger tummy. The thing that I really don’t like is the pockets. They don’t stay in place. They either bunch up at the sides or move to the back. I would not purchase the pants again."
3.0,Super cute.  I like this but it's scaled to a much smaller size.  Please order up!
3.0,"I like the way this item looks and if it were about 6 inches longer it would look still shorter than in the picture. Seriously, it is like a top, not a chemise. In the picture it is long enough to cover one's rear end. Not so in real life. I am not horribly tall either, 5'5&#34; and size 6. Oh well, you win some, you loose some."
3.0,"The costume came as pictured with all of the accessories. It also came with a hair net that works really well under the wig. However, the materials feel very cheap. I had to cut quite a few loose threads off the jacket. The size label is sewn on the back of the jacket so you can see it when it is being worn. It will work for wearing once on Halloween but I would not buy again due to the low quality."
3.0,My husband has ALS and these socks did not keep his feet warm even when temps are in the 30's.
3.0,"Cute dress, but way too small"
3.0,The jacket was prettier in person than in the picture unfortunately the sleeves were too small and I had to return it.  A 2X would’ve been perfect but it was unavailable.
3.0,"Somewhat small, very elastic material, very warm material only meant to be worn during winter"
3.0,Battery’s didn’t last but 1 mo.
3.0,The elastic on the inside fell apart relatively quickly and had to put it back together myself
3.0,This bag is more of a suitcase instead of a purse. It was way to big for me so had to send it back.
3.0,Pretty much as expected. The fleece is ok quality and the leopard design is cool. The pockets are awesome but the waistline (which is not tummy control) is way too aggressive compared to similar leggings.
3.0,This was listed as adult size but it is not. I dont have big hands and I couldnt get my fingers in. My mother who is petite was able to get her hand in but it was tight and the rubber is so thick she was unable to move the fingers.  It looks nice and would make a nice display. The stones light up nicely
3.0,This picture looks like a purple nightgown and I got a pink one- a little disappointed
3.0,"love the style and fit, but the black faded after the first wash."
3.0,"It is nice idea to accommodate many cards, but very bad  implementation. Card's pockets are to deep, cards are not visible. Overall low quality"
3.0,"They are okay, but I just found out you can get them at the Dollar Store for 1$ each"
3.0,Not bad for the price but the tassel and elephant fell off the second time I wore it.
3.0,Not made of the best quality material but u get what u pay for.. The screw on parts are a little janky but it fits and its nice. 😄
3.0,"Bought this for my Grandmother's Funeral. OK I know not the normal attire however my Grandmother graduated from clown college and was a clown. This was a surprise to everyone there and it was a huge hit. I am a bigger guy and the vest was comically tight so it added to the look, and I pulled the Big guy in a tiny vest dance  think Chris Farley big guy in a little coat."
3.0,"At first I loved them. Soft, good fit, and cute. Then two weeks later I noticed one pair is already starting to get holes. The material is obviously not good quality because it was the third washing when I noticed the wear holes."
3.0,Not what I was expecting as belt is made of an elastic material.  It fits but would be better if it was not elastic as it is able to stretch quite a bit. But seems to be of sturdy construction
3.0,Much smaller than expected. Otherwise it would have been perfect.
3.0,Wish it would have had more support in the bust
3.0,"I purchased a size 6 which is my normal size. I returned it because the color was not flattering on my skin tone. I normally wear basic colors-black, white, navy, red and beige. I think it would look pretty on others but not me because I think I am too pale."
3.0,"The shirt seems good, but the size is really, really small.  May need to order a size maybe two to get a size that fits."
3.0,"It doesn’t not last long ,within a month the material is not strong,I have hole already..,"
3.0,It’s a bit heavy and the clip doesn’t lock into place to the pin turns. Nice looking pin though.
3.0,"The looks awesome, but the pin is off center upside down, so when you wear it the pin will turn itself upside down over time."
3.0,PAPER thin...see through
3.0,"It wasn't as long as I thought it would be, I'm 5'6 and it came half way between my knees and my ankles, and I thought it as going to be more like a long and flowy maxi dress, and the fact that it wasn't was a disappointment to me. I won't buy anything else from this designer."
3.0,"Bought one of these a few years ago for my daughter, but forgot about it. Gave it to her for xmas this year and she absolutely loved it. The snake chain was very nice and silky smooth (I am guessing 0.8mm box-like snake chain), but sadly, it wasn't very durable and the chain broke quickly. Saw that the item was still for sale, and bought a replacement. Even though the item still says snake chain, the chain supplied was a very simple link chain, which is not nearly as nice. It may be more durable, but we really liked the snake chain, so back it goes. I'm writing this review to let everyone know that the new chain (as of Feb 2016) is NOT a snake chain as advertised."
3.0,It is really nice fabric.
3.0,Stays tangled and started to quickly turn colors
3.0,Wear with jeans
3.0,"A little shapeless and big, do you might want to go a size down. Overall, it’s fine."
3.0,I ended up returning.  The top half sat oddly and was unflattering.  Im large chested & there was plenty of room  - though it made the seam sit at the halfway point between my chest & waist.<br /><br />Cute print though.
3.0,UPDATE: Locking pin in band fell out and lost. It’s trashed now so I’m taking away a couple points.  Well made looks great. Like the backing. installed easily  Hoping will develop a nice patina after lots of use. Great buy and may purchase another color
3.0,I love it and most people compliment me when I wear it but my husband hates it.
3.0,"Cool idea, but not very comfortable."
3.0,Very pretty but leaves a mess on your clothes
3.0,The only problem I have with the ring is that even though I measured my finger it was supposed to go on. It was still not the right size.
3.0,Ordered for a steampunk part on Halloween in New Orleans. Ordered a 6X - I wear a size 18W-20W - Corset liked 5-6 inches from closing correctly - skirt fit. Sending it back.
3.0,Can’t really tell by pictures. But it’s a mesh product. Thought was dry fit type. Great fit and like tanks. After 3wears and a was stitching coming loose. But price is nice
3.0,"I like the material, it's TRUE to size, but the straps dont lay flat. They stick up towards the back and It looks weird. I'm returning."
3.0,Smaller and tighter than expected. Wear with Bobby pins
3.0,I like the concept of this top but it doesn't feel right when I'm wearing it. It either gaps or sits sideways. The ties at the shoulders are what can mess this top up. It is way too much effort for a top in my opinion.
3.0,"These are very small and dainty which is what I wanted for my second ear piercing.  However, the post is VERY short and the backs are screw on and so tiny you can't hold them to get them back onto the earring.  I tried for an hour to get one on and even had someone help me and it was too small for any adult to screw the back on so they are essentially not useable.  I will try to find some different backs and see if that works but with the short posts I fear they will be much too tight in my ear.  Very disappointed as I really like the small size."
3.0,"This dress is really cute. However, the shoulders are very narrow. Anytime I even slightly lifted my arms, I showed the room by back side--ALL OF IT! It is almost like the top and bottom of the seem at the shoulder/arm intersection are sewn at an extreme angle: it fits under the arms, but the top of the shoulders is a no-go.<br />If you plan to not moved your arms at all or if you have very narrow shoulders, this dress is awesome. If you are typically-shaped in the shoulders or broad-shouldered, this is not a win."
3.0,"Exactly what the title describes. It’s a good cap, but shrank bad after one wash. Still yet, not a bad purchase."
3.0,Order a size up. These fit small and are very short. Quality is good and design is cute.
3.0,girlfriend loves them
3.0,Great watch for the price I've only three of them one problem I've had is this particular watch the stone fell out after 10 months so I ordered another one and I could not find the one with the stem missing I just found it today this November17th 2020 so it's a year since I bought the watch
3.0,2 pairs I bought back pocket failing off both in a couple wears
3.0,"Good shoe overall, only issue is that the zipper came broken, it is a fake zipper however it was open. The inside of the shows the black Styrofoam which makes it looks cheap and tacky. Otherwise it would have been an adorable pair of shoes to add to my collection."
3.0,"Fits like a t-shirt. Going to get it tailored. The color is a little more off than the photo, too. I'm 5'3 and mostly torso. I found the large size to be too long but go figure."
3.0,BUENOS LENTES
3.0,"The screen print on this shirt is excellent. The fabric seems a little heavy, and the sleeves are pretty big. I wouldn’t call it a slim fit. Overall I’m happy with it."
3.0,"I ordered XLarge. They were extremely hard to put on and fit so tight at the top just under the bend of my knee that I was in pain nearly all day. Okay sure, they reduced my swelling, but within an Hour of taking them off, I was back to the before condition."
3.0,This dress is so comfortable and so flattering. I was so excited to receive it and wear it. I got so many compliments on it. I was ready to order a number of them until I washed it. The color washed great And I tend not to put these kinds of dresses in the dryer but rather hang them to dry. I was quite surprised when I was putting it away to find that it had lots of pills on it.  Enough so that I had to get out by clothes shaver  get rid of them. At first I thought that I was so set on something that caused it but then I realized it was also under the arms as well.<br />I’m really disappointed because it fits so nicely and it’s hard to find a light weight cotton dress.
3.0,"I had finally bought a Pandora bracelet and found this letter charm for it. Once I received it, I couldn't believe how small and dull it seemed to be. I like bling! This is not what I call bling. For the price I paid, a little more was expected."
3.0,Too heavy for human ears
3.0,"The shoe is cool, however it's very heavy, and you need to push very hard on the button to hide or unhide the wheel."
3.0,Don't like PVC material
3.0,"I expected a dark blue and pink earring as in the photograph.  However the blue is more of a bright aqua.  The earrings were ordered to wear with a specific top, so they didn't go with it at all. Still, the earrings are cute and I will enjoy wearing them with other things."
3.0,Rather cheap looking. Stunk of pesticide.  Is a good everyday belt and the smell subsided.
3.0,I have bought more pairs of these ‘GV Amanda’ pants than I can remember. I love the pockets and belt loops for work. They’re kind of like jeans but in a nice quality feeling cotton fabric.  Problem….I liked this pattern but the fabric started pilling a lot. I don’t have this problem with any of the other patterns / colors. Not sure why.
3.0,"I’m not in love with this tunic, but it serves its purpose. I primarily just wanted a loungy shirt that was long enough for leggings. It’s not the most flattering fit, and the material isn’t amazing, but I decided to keep it."
3.0,The photo shows it as teal but the actual thing is dark green. Also the dots are much bigger and dark green-orange combination is not very attractive. Quality is very good though.
3.0,"I bought these to keep my button down shirts tucked in at the office.  I have two versions, these are for when I'm not wearing socks (the other kind hooks onto the top of my socks).  I ended up using these even with socks because they're much thinner than the other set of shirt stays I have.  The others show through my pants, but these are not as visible with slimmer fitting office pants or boot cut jeans.  They'll probably last me a long time because I'll only wear them a few times a month, but I think if they were worn a lot they could wear out after a couple of years.  I'm really happy with them because they hide relatively well under my clothes.  The shirt clasp popped off a couple times while raising and lowering my pants, and one of them was pretty aggravating as far as poking me in the leg all day, but not deal breakers by any means."
3.0,"This bucket hat is great & made well; however, one-size-fits all does not apply necessarily to me.  It runs small for my bigger head, I guess.  :~))  I've been dampening it in the hopes of stretching it out a bit."
3.0,Wear it often.  Good buy.
3.0,"The set looked super warm, which is why I purchased it. The shirt was short. I mean super short. Above the navel short. With a tight neck. The pants seemed fine."
3.0,"Love the shirt however, I washed it and part of the shirts material must have been thin cause when I pulled it out of the dryer there was a hole in it😞 Instead of sending it back I just sewed it up. I didn't have the time to send it back and get a new one before our trip."
3.0,"This dress is lovely. The fabric is is rich with a soft hand.  It's shorter on my 5;7&#34; frame than I like, coming about 3&#34; above the knee.  It's obviously made for someone shorter.  The waist hits me mid-rib, but the flow of the skirt fabric prevents it from looking funky. The size is a good fit, just the length is off for me."
3.0,It is a super cute suit. Very well made but not for big chested girls. I will have to return it 😏
3.0,So overall I got what I ordered but I didn’t get a green color but two blues... maybe the colors are just very similar in color or tone. Also I find that their difficult to open. Also they are a tad small but still look nice 👁👄👁
3.0,Broke out in rash
3.0,Like the style very much
3.0,"Loved the look of the band and the material was soft and comfortable.  My two complaints - 1.  the band doesn't fit flush against the watch face (there was a very slight gap between the face and the start of the band); and 2.  the buckle on the band was too bulky - it dug into my arm on the inside, even with the band loosely fastened."
3.0,My daughter loves the pocketz
3.0,I love the style but it does run small
3.0,Dont lay against volksr
3.0,Don’t let the pictures fool you. The bag is very small and the inside isn’t even lined. I think I’m goig to return it.
3.0,"I love leggings! Especially for exercising. So when I found these super awesome leggings by TinyUnicorn I had to have them! It's been about 2 weeks I have had them now, and I have only worn them one time for about 10 minutes to see how They fit. They are a little snug due to the &#34;one size fits most,&#34; but they are stretchy which is a plus. The material feels great and is super breathable. I also love love love the design on them. The downside which is the reason I gave them a lower rating is in the sowing. The seams are stitched, but it seems like a poor job, or maybe the material is to delicate. Also, the seam in the crotch area is already coming undone, and I haven't even washed them yet! So after I do wash them I probably won't be able to wear them again until I can sow them myself which is a bummer. So they are super cool leggings, but they seem to be poorly made. I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,adorable but very very small
3.0,May made to hold boobs
3.0,I ordered ‘jade green’ color. But received color jade or like blue.
3.0,I like the glasses okay and I've never worn glasses before but when working at the computer I have a constant glare/reflection on them that I can see.  Sometimes its annoying but its not like I have to wear them all day.
3.0,It snapped easily but had a cute packaging
3.0,"I never think things “run small” (that usually means they are true to size) but this top does. I ordered a L hoping for a longer, oversized fit, but it fits me exactly like it’s shown on the model. I’m just under 5’2” and about 105# and usually an XXS/XS. I double-checked the tag and everything. Otherwise it’s a cute top but I was going to wear it layered with cardigans and jackets and it’s too cropped to look normal like that."
3.0,"Material is a bit cheap, it tor in the second week of use."
3.0,"The dress is pretty and of good quality. First, the dress was folded up and put in a shipping bag, not a flat box. The boning in the dress was curled and I had to try and straighten it. Second, I took my measurements before ordering but the dress is too large at the top. If I cinch the laces tighter so the torso fits, the waistline puckers and the straps fall off my shoulders. I purchased this for my sister's wedding that is a week away so I will have to figure out a way to make it work. I don't have time to exchange and pay for return shipping at this point. If the shipping wasn't sloppy and the dress was true to the sizing measurements listed this would've been five stars because it is pretty but disappointed that it doesn't fit right."
3.0,It's super cute the color is perfect I gave it 3 stars because of the zipper and how big it is under the arms. the zipper is plastic and plated in silver it's probably going to look ugly over time once the silver plating start to peel off. The zipper is all around the hood and catches your hair.
3.0,Much like others who have reviewed these on here. The size does run small so I would buy a size up if I were you. They are durable and function as expected. Nothing negative to say about them at all.
3.0,"Did not receive design I ordered and was too late to send back because was a Christmas gift. Disappointed, but sister still loves the shirt with other bunnies on it."
3.0,"Lens came with a scratch, and a little twisted."
3.0,"So it’s very soft and nice but I ordered a G and..... well look at it. Definitely not as pictured. But also I’m too lazy to send it back and get a new one so I’m just gonna rock this wonky thing. And yes, I tried to brush it in the right direction so it would look correct but it won’t stay that way."
3.0,It’s cute and my daughter likes it. We got two of the same side so to make the heart one is backwards.
3.0,This was a nice dress but it runs a bit small.  I bought several dresses in my size and this one was the only one that did not fit
3.0,Nowhere does it say polarized in the package or on the sunglasses.
3.0,Nice fabric but runs very very small
3.0,"The quality of this article is silky... but like that of a costume. It's cheap. It looks good from the back, but looks very loose and large in the front. I usually wear a size small. The sleeve length is regular long, but when I try to push the sleeves up, it doesn't stay, it's quite loose. I would wear it with a dress, gray scarf, and tights.<br />I also wear a small.<br /><br />Would I actually buy this if I saw this in real life? Probably not. But the design on the back is nice when it's not slipping off."
3.0,"I liked it at first .. then after only the first time washing and wearing it, it already had a hole.I double checked the washing instructions and it had no special instructions. I added photos. I know its not easy to see (or else Id be demanding my money back and tossing it) but even after you cinch the top, you can still see the other two holes .. there are three at least that I have found. I washed it a second time after my first wear, and the wholes didnt seem to get much worse but this top has MAYBE 2 more wears. Other then that, got compliments. Too bad I wont get many .."
3.0,"Maybe I just haven’t found the perfect application for these but every time I have tried to wear them while gardening in my raised beds, I just feel like I can’t do what I want to do with my fingers. There is a little bit of room in the gloves because I am pretty petite so maybe that is part of it. I can see the claws coming in handy when I start digging up potatoes or some thing but I feel like I would just rather get my hands dirty and have full use of my fingers."
3.0,Cute outfit. Would have looked great at the Ren Fest. But the size is WAY smaller than expected. Size up at least 3 sizes to be in the ballpark of western sizing.
3.0,"Super cute. A little on the cheap side. I'm 116lbs 5'3&#34; and ordered a small and it was just a bit big on me, but that's how the fit is suppose to be."
3.0,Thought it would be better material but it looked good until the cheap hidden zipper wouldn’t zip .
3.0,Very pretty dress just cut small.
3.0,"Bought these as I was looking for reading glasses that wouldn’t hurt the bridge of my nose after wearing them for a while. These fit that bill. When I first put them on, I thought they were defective but it was just small, barely discernible protective plastic pieces on the inside and outside of the lenses. Make sure you remove these. The glasses are not the greatest quality but they work and seem like they’ll hold up."
3.0,I was super excited to receive this swimsuit! I was a little disappointed that the bottoms don't come up as high as they did in the photo. but the top is great.
3.0,I like the design and I think these will work well.  3 stars for sending blue instead of the pink that I ordered.
3.0,Outdoors Mountain life. A bit tight and I'm a small man. Picture was a little deceiving on tortoise hue.
3.0,a little tighter than what I wanted.
3.0,I'm pretty small and I looked all over for a plaid skirt that wouldn't be huge and long on me. It took me a month to settle on t his one..and it's MUCH bigger than the pictures and sizing guide imply. Too bad.
3.0,"I got these shirts to workout in but they were way too short. My sports bra was longer. These shirts are more for teens. Maybe young adult. Way too small for me. I had to return them. Overall, not a good fit for me."
3.0,I couldn't find the size chart when I ordered so I picked a medium based on the reviews.  But way to big for my 8 y/o.  The medium was for 14-17 y/o.
3.0,"Nice material. Fit is very tight, especially on abdomen and arms"
3.0,The hat is great but the problem is they sent me a L/XL which was NOT identified in the listing. It is a Christmas gift but honestly it seems awful big to me. May need to return it. It’s frustrating when a listing does not provide the correct details.
3.0,"The leather is good quality, but the rubber circle grips failed too quickly. That’s the problem with every glasses strap I’ve ever purchased! Won’t repurchase these."
3.0,They run small not cotton which is what I need
3.0,"Tarnish very quickly, mine are almost silver now. Cute otherwise"
3.0,The slip in the heal alot
3.0,Go a little narrow at the ankles which means of you're kid had wider feet they can be a bit of a struggle to get on and we bought an 8-9 my daughter is only a 7
3.0,Cute design concept. Runs small and no grip. Returned.
3.0,"They aren't resin, they are polymer clay. I can see fingerprints in them. They barely look like the picture and are much bigger than anticipated. It's a good thing I paid less than $2 for these or I would be mad."
3.0,"It is a very nice watch, but I did not get the exact watch I ordered. I was supposed to get the gold one with the black rubber band. But I'm fine with what I received. The band is actually for people with smaller wrist. My wrist is rather larger than most. It does keep very accurate time, and it is a pretty decent value for the money I spent. It came sooner than I expected which is always a plus. Overall I really like this watch."
3.0,Accidentally dropped it and it broke which real Jade dosnt do so easily . It's not a bad product if you don't drop it but it shouldn't be marketed as real jade when it isn't
3.0,"I love this watch, but unfortunately, the color of the band chipped/faded or something in just one day. They were good at refunding me, or offering another watch, though... which I liked. I liked that they were willing to help me on that. It comes with a kit to remove links, if need be, which was also nice and a very helpful tool."
3.0,"While I like the style of this dress, the fit is way too small and the fabric is not of good quality. The proportions are clearly off because the length is ""normal,"" but the top is about two sizes smaller. The design is really flattering, but the fit is just way off here."
3.0,It’s not the dress pictures but it’s still cute and wearable and even got a lot of compliments it’s really I nice date night or girls night out kinda dress but beware i loved the red one so much I ordered one in black and it was damaged and the straps broke with one wear and I was at a funeral there was no dancing or wild behavior so that was kinda disappointing but the red one was fine still wear it a year later
3.0,The top was way to small to be called an extra large; I can't recall seeing any information about the size nor the length.
3.0,"It's an ok belt, overpriced for how cheap it seems. It kinda rides up in front & Velcro can stick to your clothes. But it doesn't show under tighter shirts...so that's a plus."
3.0,I expected a bigger bag. I don't this a tote bag.
3.0,Made cheap. The bottom of the shoe was lined with some sort of material that resembled velvet which made it impossible to walk on certain floors with. I have tile floors in my kitchen and it was like walking on ice. Carpet was the only thing i could confidently walk on without doing a split.
3.0,"Cute suit, but the seam on the attached bottoms cuts right across my stomach, should be higher.  Very unflattering.  The pads in the bra roll up during washing, so remove them or plan on spending considerable time getting them to lay flat again."
3.0,"I have wide feet and always size up for insoles, heavy socks. These run huge and have the arch support in a very uncomfortable place. Earth Origins is going downhill."
3.0,"Decent shoe, looks slightly cheap in person but good overall. No arch support or traction on the sole but for the price it delivers what is expected."
3.0,Love this dress.  Fabulous quality.  Now I just need somewhere to wear it!
3.0,"I like the suit but it's low quality.  The fabric is thin so you can't have any lumps and bumps because this suit won't smooth them out.  It wasn't flattering on me at all. But if you have a hard body, then I think it will be nice.  Plus the side that doesn't have the strap doesn't feel supportive and I'm a B cup!  It just doesn't feel like it's snug enough."
3.0,I returned this product because it was not the green I was looking for.  They dress was large in certain places but fit right in others.
3.0,Too long for petite women
3.0,"The product is good, it’s just too short."
3.0,The padding doesn’t stay in place. Not a very big opening to take them out to wash. After the wash the padding is cheap and folds up and it’s all over to where it shouldn’t be
3.0,A little more high cut than I expected
3.0,I bought a small I normally wear medium tops it was still too big and didn’t give the tight fit I wanted to exercise in.  But it will work will buy xtra small next time.
3.0,honestly the only piece from this set that my son actually ended up wearing was the shirt which fit him from about 6mo till 9mo. i bought it thinking it would fit him in a 3-6 mo range.
3.0,Fabric is a little cheap/hot but is in line with price point overall cute and easy to wear.
3.0,"If you're looking for a top quality product, I wouldn't recommend these. But if you need something fast for a costume, these will work. The fur looks more like hair than fur, but it doesn't shed very much, if at all. They're also a little long, so you'd definitely have to wear them with a platform shoe in order to not step on them."
3.0,it was almost the same color as my skin which made it weird. Sent it back
3.0,The fit was fine on this but it was very thin and showed everything and felt and looked a bit cheap (to be expected).
3.0,Okay not great. Takes a minute to get the speakers where you want them. Good if your not doing any loud activities other wise the sound gets muffled out compared to having earphone directly in your ear canal. Probably be great for running or shoveling snow.
3.0,I did not realize it was a printed piece of paper covered by resin in the design.  Besides that they fit well and have good weight to them
3.0,"my main issue is that it's too small.  A reviewer wrote that these came large for the size, so I ordered the xl not teh xxl (I'm not taht big, but I have long arms and I usually order xxl.  Unfortunately they are not &#34;large&#34; for their size.  Like a shirt size, if you usually buy XXL, buy XXL.  I would have preferred to get a larger one."
3.0,I liked the shoe it was well made. I have trouble walking in shoes because of  diabets so any shoe i wear is not comfortable. but i will keep them. you sent me 3 pair i hade  to send one pair back and it cost me over $8.00  because you didn't send me the write label. so i would hope you make up for it in my return.
3.0,"The keychain is small and the round piece is slightly bigger than a quarter. The writing is tiny but that can be good because it can be easily hidden.  This piece is okay.<br />My gripe is with the chain. For the price point, I expect a chain that isn’t weak. It’s supposed to hold keys which can get heavy. This chain looks and feels like it will easily break.<br />I got this as a gift but I think I’ll be returning it."
3.0,"It is okay. The dinosaur decal is just a plastic vinyls instead of stitched, which makes it feel cheaply done."
3.0,"Way too small, I really wanted to wear it, but it couldn’t fit."
3.0,Overpriced for what it is. But it gets the job done.
3.0,It fits nicely but the band since it’s not adjustable or very stretchy make sure you order the correct size. I don’t know if it’ll fit better once I’m not pregnant but the wire really digs into my chest and makes it uncomfortable to wear. However I do like how my chest looks with the bra.
3.0,"It did not work as well as I thought it would be, now, I have to buy silver polish cream and see if it works better"
3.0,"It's kind of expensive for what it is. It has the fabric of a swim suit, I thought it was going to be more of a cottony feeling. It is a little large too. Not by much but had I gone a size down it would have been a perfect fit."
3.0,"I got these to wear around the house or to slip on if I needed to run to the car or garden.  They were all disfigured when I got them,  which made them fit really weird for the first little while.  Then I made the mistake of wearing them all day at the lake and running around.  The top and sides of my feet were rubbed raw and very painful.  I'll only use them if I'll only need them for less than 5 minutes."
3.0,"The fabric is different than the other tunics I have bought from them, it is see through. One of the shirt pockets had a hole after the first wash. I won't buy these again, but would try the brand again."
3.0,"The bottoms were great but the top was way too big, so I had to return it.  If you are large chested, this might work for you."
3.0,Flair's out in a at weird way at waist. See through. I would say it's not worth buying because you won't wear it more than once for Halloween.
3.0,"It's ok. Very cheaply made connector, because of that it so hard to put it on. But once you put it on it looks really nice."
3.0,These are super cute and love the way they look. They just do not work. The area for putting your information does not hold the paper in. Our information had fallen out during travel on the two we used. If you buy get a sticker label to put on this so you don’t have to worry about your information not stay attached.
3.0,"One leg hole is very loose, and the other has a lot of elastic, leading to a wonky look.<br /><br />The material is VERY soft and it's adorable. Headband fit perfectly.<br /><br />The worst part is that you have to remove the entire outfit to change a diaper. I wish there were snaps on the bottom."
3.0,not  worth the money
3.0,It was perfect when I first tried it. But after washing it shrunk 25%.
3.0,"The silver paint flakes off, leaves little particles everywhere. There is something I noticed, though. This can be converted from a toy into a real particle mask. The ""hoses"" to the side pop off, and reveal standard 40mm connectors to which you could connect carbon filter cannisters, and the false exhaust in the front can have a gasket attached to prevent outside air from ""backing up"" into the mask. You DO need to replace the straps with something that won't come apart all the time. No problem. Could even just staple the straps together so they don't come through the loops. Just interesting."
3.0,"These are literally SO comfortable and fit me so good, unfortunately my butt is too big for them and completely see through definitely not for big bootied girls but awesome leggings none the less"
3.0,"I liked the chain, and I can hang another pendant on it. The CZ is to large for the chain, and the size of the stone and framing makes it look cheap and to big. You can tell as soon as you look at it, is cut glass. But I did like the chain."
3.0,"Don’t be fooled, these socks are very thin. I have some from my local Dollar Tree that are about the same quality. They are pretty, so if you are looking for something cute and not really purposeful, these are a great buy. But I have noticed over the years cheaping out on socks (unless you are wearing super high quality shoes) will only hurt you in the end."
3.0,The legs fit perfectly but around the waist is more like a medium and they don't sit at the hips.
3.0,Bought this for my middle schooler. It’s just ok. No the greatest quality but it’s a mask…
3.0,Kinda stiff and a little thicker than  I would have preferred
3.0,The dress was lovely and the material was very comfortable! The dress was just a little big!
3.0,good but bulky
3.0,"The minute hand came off before we could he could even use it.  Had to be returned within 30 days, but since I purchased it in October and gave it to him after the 30 days.  My mistake, I guess.  No it is not available."
3.0,"GOOD:<br />-Quality of the bands seem good. Let's hope the black doesn't scratch easily.<br />-Two screen protectors are a nice bonus!<br />-Adjusting the length of the metal link band isn't as difficult as I thought it would be.<br /><br />BAD:<br />-The mesh strap is NOT the same product as shown on the main photo. Instead it is a loop band that secures by magnet. Still a nice product, but doesn't match the main photo. To be fair, their description does say loop band.<br />-All other bands I've purchased for this watch have the pins (that connect the bands to the watch) installed within the band. The pins in these bands are separate pieces and you have to be very careful when attaching and detaching from the watch. The pins fall out easily during these processes.<br />-The metal link band tends to pull my arm hairs"
3.0,"This is an edit of my first review to be compliant with Amazon and to accept to share it.<br /><br />I have ordered this pant for the second time, the first time the pants was amazing amazing and I loved it so much in everything, the style, model, the fabric and how it looks on me, that is why I gave it 3 stars.<br />2nd time, when I placed the order I was notified that the pants would be available around the first week of October, I was surprised with getting it within few days of placing the order, left it few days without opening the package as I trust my deliveries and it is a spare to the one I have, so after a few days opened it and surprisingly it was a TOTALLY different model, style, and fabric.<br />That would answer why I recieved it earlier than what I was originally notified with."
3.0,Love the color. Love the skirt however it is a tad see through.
3.0,These are really cute and my wife loves them! Only problem is they're one size too small.
3.0,"The dress is super cute, soft and flowy.  It's just WAY too big on me, I'm an XS. This would look fabulous on a larger woman... at least a Medium or larger... it has a bunch of stretch to it in the back scrunchy banding area."
3.0,"It was a very close tight fit, not as expected from an XL product. It is more of a long sleeve t-shirt than sweatshirt. Very thin material."
3.0,I bought these in a store. Just loved them . I went down a size because I lost weight. I was a 14 ordered a 13. I got into them but they were not what I expected in the sizing chart
3.0,Not what was expected.  Some stones seem fake.  The sizes are off. Won't let me add a photo.
3.0,I love this dress but the eslactic around the chest keeps flipping over almost as if the thread came loose.
3.0,a little wobbly
3.0,I'm usually a medium. I bought a large so it would be a little big. It is tighter than some of my other medium-sized t-shirts.
3.0,"I bought multiple pair in different colors.  Very comfortable.  HOWEVER, the metal grommets around draw string fell off immediately (one wear before washing).  Another pair the drawstring is so long I could wrap it around me twice (I bought medium pants). And another pair, I noticed the seam in the crotch was not sewn. I can fix it all - not a big deal.  If you're looking for comfort then it's 5 ⭐️.  If you're looking for quality 2 stars."
3.0,"this was cute but, i had to return it because it was too small in the bust area."
3.0,"The shoe size runs small<br /><br />I have  10.5, and ordered 11 and they did not fit.<br />I bought the 12's and they fit fine"
3.0,Dress was too tight. I even bought a larger size. Like the make of the dress. Will send it back and buy another two sizes up. I have no bust but a rather large stomach so I really don't fault the dress.
3.0,"Really nice quality and fit, but it actually looks like bath robe once on...for me anyways.  I had to return it"
3.0,"I bought this for my wife. She is one of those wife's that loses jewelry everyday lol.  The chain is of poor quality, but I didn't buy it for the chain. I like the pendant and am satisfied with my purchase. This is not high end jewelry but very nice for the price."
3.0,"frumpy.... way bigger than expected, but fine for a basic work day. Long enough to wear with leggings."
3.0,the strap fit a bit narrow
3.0,They wete beautiful but to small lost one already send me coupon please
3.0,"I just had a baby and expected a dress that I could nurse my baby in discretely only to find the buttons are purely for design. The dress is very cute and comfortable but by the time I don’t need to be nursing in it, it will probably be too big. I’m too lazy to return it though so I’m sure I’ll wear it this summer around the house or with leggings so I can lift it to feed the baby. Better than the hassle of returning it."
3.0,"Very cute! My daughter loved them. However, they were so wide she couldn't keep them on. Length was pretty true to size."
3.0,around the armpits they bunch
3.0,"sort of tight, but love the colors"
3.0,Very very cute shoes sizing is bigger than listed though. It's ok though were gonna let her grow into them
3.0,"It's very lovely and elegant; a real statement piece. However, the back is very slack and I'm afraid the earrings may fall off if I don't replace them with backs that will hold the earrings in place well enough."
3.0,The tags looked nice but I lost one on the very first trip after receiving them.  Baggage handlers must have been extra rough.
3.0,Material is nicer than expected considering how inexpensive it is. The bad: it came with one corner obviously out of shape. I also ordered the same brand cummerbund set but the materials obviously didn't match. I debated with myself for too long before deciding to return and missed the deadline. Now I'm stuck.
3.0,Just didn’t like the material . Very cute style
3.0,Super cute but short in the torso. Would reccomend for short girls but not anyone average or tall.
3.0,The color is much lighter than the picture. It almost looks faded in person.
3.0,These are nice but clearly made by a man with no butt. They are a significantly lower waist line then it appears in the picture. Plus one of the medal circles that surround where the draw string comes out of the pants popped off the first time I wore them. Overall they are comfortable but you need to make sure you wear them with a longer shirt.
3.0,Cute but a lot smaller than the pictures
3.0,Just going to keep them
3.0,Very good for kids to learn.
3.0,"My webbing still slides and I use two of these on my shoulder straps.  Maybe I just need a better pack but Im cheap.  Not that big of a deal.  These do help, they just do not eliminate the problem."
3.0,The cuff links are too small!!
3.0,Dress is not what you expect.  Colors are brighter and dress runs too big
3.0,"I had some trouble with one of them getting to lock it! It was bent in delivery or from seller. So, I had to adjust it a couple of times to get it to lock on ear. Other then that they pretty elegant."
3.0,It was way to big. Going to return it but great quality
3.0,They are decent quality pins-however be aware that on pin trading sites these pins carry a warning &#34;manufacturer sells directly to sellers&#34; and therefore can't guaranty that they are &#34;genuine&#34; Disney pins. That said-unless you examine very closely ALL the giveaways of &#34;scrappers&#34; these pins will probably pass for genuine pins...as many say-if you want &#34;valuables&#34; to add to a collection these aren't the pins for you. If you want to start a collection just to have fun then these &#34;lots&#34; for little money are a great way to start-especially for kids who want several pins to start trading.
3.0,Weird material on the inside. Nice gloves otherwise.
3.0,"I put this in my shoes they do help to keep your shoes from caving in, BUT the top overall item could have been sturdier, but it will support your shoe"
3.0,"Its getting 3 stars because when I received the case, the liner at the bottom had come undone. Other than that, works for what its made for."
3.0,I haven see any results yet
3.0,"Cute style, but the middle section where the &#34;pleats&#34; are does not stay down.  It would have been great if this wasn't the case, felt like I would be constantly fussing with it to make sure it looked right.  Other than that, the dress is well made."
3.0,"I followed the size chart and got a bigger size, but it was still too small. I wear an XL, but ordered a bigger size to account for it running small, but ooh a 2x was still tight"
3.0,"It didn't look as great on my as I expected on me, although I did like that the material which helped slim my figure"
3.0,"This set is very pretty but could be constructed better for the price. It will do, but could be better."
3.0,"It was a cute dress, but I ended up having to return it. The top fit perfectly, but since there is no stretch to the bottom it wouldn't fit over my hips. The seller was fantastic to work with!"
3.0,Discolored only after a two weeks of wear. The gem was beautiful on arrival wish it would have lasted longer
3.0,Not grey more bluish/purle
3.0,[[VIDEOID:2b666228c76d0ca63a108f5f2d74f892]] I love these…BUT my rose gold band doesn’t seem to stay clasped. Must’ve gotten a bad/defective clasp. My other two bands (black and silver) work amazing and look fabulous on my wrist. One down side is that these bands do not come with watch covers to match the finish of the bands— you must buy those separately. I would have given this product a 5/5 if not for the defective rose gold band. Video included to see just how easily the clasp releases. I’m worried my watch might fly off my wrist if I’m not careful.<br /><br /> I repeat: the other bands are excellent and a wonderful size for dainty wrists and those seeking a slimmer band.
3.0,"The bottom fit , but the top doesn’t have the bra - type hook for adjustment."
3.0,"This jumper overall is cute in design, but it is short in the legs. It does not fit like the picture. Too bad, this is why I returned it."
3.0,The loops get entangled but it's still very pretty
3.0,Little smaller than the description of fit to size
3.0,"I believe the shirts are supposed to be on the shorter side but, they are smaller than an average 10/12 FOR SURE and WAY too tight after a regular wash/dry.<br />  But cute-no fading, nice colors. Order up!"
3.0,"not exactly what I expected and didn't know what half of the stuff was, but gave it as a gift"
3.0,"I really wanted this to be a classy dress I could wear to work, but it’s just too casual and thin for that."
3.0,Runs kind of big & icy son has skinny feet so not a good fit
3.0,The rings are really cute and came way before their estimated delivery date. That being said the midi rings are really tiny and though they are adjustable it has been difficult making the midis bigger. They fit my pinky fine but the rest are a no go. If you have stick fingers than these are perfect but for bigger fingers it's a little difficult. Just a thought
3.0,"My niece loved the design.  But the pants were at least 4"" too short.  Also, I know the style is to have ragged seams, but this was a bit too much!"
3.0,Cheap quality. They work alright but they will break easy
3.0,This was way to big and looked horrible between my highs.
3.0,It was too big/long. Material is real thin.
3.0,"I love the weight of this shirt and most of the fit, but the neckline is so loose that it slides off my shoulders, which is very annoying. I am 5'6"" and 135 lbs."
3.0,"I was really hopeful for this suit, it was super cute out the bag. Unfortunately, as a curvy gal, the top just didn't make the cut. I'm 5'4"", a 36 DD and typically wear an 8-10, so I ordered the Large, the largest size this suit came in. The bottom was just a touch too snug for my liking, but the cheeky cut on the butt was really cute, the top left over half of my tatas spilling out.<br /><br />I'd recommend the suit if you take the time (unlike myself) to look at the measurements and check them against your own. The make of the suit was well made and of decent quality for the price.. just not for my body!"
3.0,"It’s so adorable, but after a few weeks of wearing it Nd taking it off at night, the paint color is coming off around the band. It’s very cute but over priced."
3.0,They fit nice but they're too expensive. Get a five pack for a few bucks more at Walmart
3.0,"This is a very attractive shirt, but a little more snug then I prefer, so I had to return it."
3.0,Consider up a size.. they’re snug…
3.0,One shoe only worked for the first day. The light's don't turn on anymore
3.0,"The decal is small and just an iron on, so it's a work outside hat"
3.0,"Quick delivery, attractive packaging. One of the three straps developed cracks with a single wearing, so my hopes for durability are not high."
3.0,"I love the look, but its cheap material. As soon as i took it out the package it ripped. So i have a bigger hole on the fishnet"
3.0,"Great fabric and length, runs small"
3.0,Kind of awkward to use.  Magnifying mirror is better for make-up application
3.0,"Worked well, however it did start to wear on the corners. My wife uses it very lightly always keeps it in her pocket but is still wore. Excellent customer service, they replace it right away hopefully the new one will last longer."
3.0,"This sweater is cute, however I was disappointed that it was not off the shoulder"
3.0,This necklace is beautiful yet simple.  Give it 3 stars cause the clasp broke when I was trying to put it on for the first time. I jus took an old necklace clasp and pliers n voil&agrave;.... ..still got to wear it for this NYE party. Jus be careful with it but it really looks lovely.
3.0,"Smaller and cheaper looking than u thought with a cheap chain. Still, is very cute"
3.0,It collects the material weird around the hips and the slip of the dress shows. Not constructed to fit well. If the slip was of the same pattern it would be cute but it's white and just makes it look I'll fitting when infact it's to big/ to much fabric around the hips.
3.0,"I selected this to wear with black shorts instead of just another boring solid color shirt. I figured black and white, could add a bright colored sweater if I needed to.<br />The print is ROYAL BLUE!!!??? Doesn't look blue in photo at all. Might work with jeans. Not sure if I will keep it."
3.0,Soft if they are soft they fit well only wear one so far so it's time to do laundry and we'll see how it does after laundry stay tuned
3.0,"Color was not even close - it arrived electric blue not the periwinkle shown in the photo. I'll keep it but won't be able to wear it with the outfit I had planned. A margin of difference with the color is understood, but this is far beyond expectations. Too bad."
3.0,Awesome mask! Just like the original in the series!
3.0,"Color is not as shown in picture.  Hardly any red and that's the color I was wanting so I was disappointed.  I love the red/blue/green combo as shown in picture.  But sadly, that's not what you get.  It's a cute ring though.  Looks like regular mystic topaz.....not Fire Mystic."
3.0,Way shorter than advertised tho
3.0,"The ears are shaped completely different than the photos.  The pair I recieved is shaped like horns/triangles, rather than the nice rounded cat ears shown in the photos."
3.0,"I like this dress, but it's not for me (or anyone above an A cup maybe).  I don't mind cleavage but this bordered on obscene...and not in a flattering way.<br />Just too much Boobage.<br /><br />Otherwise, the fabric is pretty, dress is cute. I am usually a 4 and purchased a small but it was too big, mostly in the sleeves and hips.<br />I returned it.  I ordered the maxi style of this dress (same fabric, different neckline) and it's MUCH better"
3.0,"Its a decent bag, i just assumed the product actually had a device attached to it that was used for charging your electronics. However its just two separate pieces."
3.0,"Not bad.  Get what you pay for.  Cheap belt but it works.  I bought two trakline belts that were about $50 a piece.  Much better quality but considering I can buy 3 or 4 of these for the same price, it was worth it"
3.0,There to tight on me feel like skinny jeans
3.0,Super comfortable dress. Can be casual or dressed up with the right accessories. Fabric is kind of cheap and it has started to pill under the arms and in other places.
3.0,"top too big, bottoms too small - cant wear this set."
3.0,"I purchased the blue and orange colors. Blue is ok, true to size. The orange is completely see though, I could see my nude underwear underneath"
3.0,"The dress is cute and the material is great for activity or just casual, but it does not include shorts which are built into the dress. The shorts come separated from the dress which I did not like very much."
3.0,"I loved the green color, the fit is great but the fine gauge of the fabric is prone to snags unfortunately. I wore it ONCE and got a snag right in the front and several others!  I am 55+ and wasn't doing anything crazy when I wore this so not sure why it snagged so easily!  I guess I will not be able to wear it out & about, just at home, but it's very comfortable & cozy. Not heavy but a lighter waffle-weave.<br />5' 4"" 135 lb. got a large...roomy & comfortable over leggings."
3.0,Top fit perfect but bottoms too small. Your body needs to be perfectly proportioned to fit the bathing suit. I usually need one size up for bottoms compared to top.
3.0,Beautiful  shirt ..but 2x came smaller
3.0,Metal was soft and malleable. Coarser than shown.
3.0,First impression was good. Recommended for a friend and bought them one as a gift. I have not worn the waist trainer no more than 5 or 6 times and the wires are beginning to poke out. My waist is a 26 my stomach is flat and because I'm wearing it to get more of an hour glass shape I thought a small would fit but it's a bit tight when I wear it properly.
3.0,Fit as expected.  They are great
3.0,Soft compression
3.0,"The sleeves on the shirt are too short, they are more like 3/4 sleeves and the pants are too long. My son is a 12, and the shirt looks like a 10 on him and the pants a 14."
3.0,To big and bulky and it scratches me all the time and that's it
3.0,Really pretty! Don't buy if you have sensitive ears. I couldn't actually wear it cause it's such poor quality metal
3.0,"Ok crossbody. I purchased this for traveling through Europe. It is cute however, the strap is questionable as are the flimsy metal loops that attach it to the purse section. I started out using it but after traveling through the airport for a day I didn’t use it again. I got the impression it could be easily snatched."
3.0,"They get dirty easily (but that was to be expected) my issue with them is that the elastic is almost non existent. On the other hand, the wrist is longer than the wrist on the gloves my school provides. So i can use some white hair ties and the wrist of my gloves now stay under my gauntlets easier."
3.0,I bought 3 dresses in different colors.  This dress was smaller than the rest.  The Blue and the Black were cut looser and longer.  This dress was much shorter.
3.0,Hey but at least I can breathe. Get compliments all the time.
3.0,They are cute I will keep them but the image looks like a large pair these are small
3.0,"Very tight, I'm a size 8 and these were prob for a size 6-7."
3.0,These were very lightweight but not sturdy. Maybe more suited for boat shoes types of shoes?  BF used with Danskos and they did not hold up
3.0,"you know, here are the pros: they're wool. they have touch sensitivity. they look as promised -- the standard sizing probably fits a medium hand. see the concepts company website for true dimensions. but are they accurate? no. very difficult to type on an iphone keyboard (my fingers are small) without having the exact touch-sensitive material-area contact my phone and so on.<br /><br />on the other hand, i discovered today that my cheap chenille gloves (think, similar, something you'd get off of a kiosk or chinatown stall) are perfectly conductive all over (or maybe they're just porous enough?) -- either way, no problems, perfect typing. very happy.<br /><br />too bad i had to buy this pair before i found that out. but i could always use more gloves."
3.0,"It is much to heavy for most scarves, bit it is very pretty.  I will wear it around the Xmas holidays"
3.0,Ordered a 2x and it fits like a large/medium.  Checking to see if it will fit a family member and if not them I'll send it back.  Very nice looking jacket tho.
3.0,"It is nice one, but the golden color changed after 3 times ware! However, still nice earrings"
3.0,"Muy grande, mala terminación"
3.0,The hat didn't fit and my 15 month old grandson has a normal sized American head. The rest fit perfectly. The fabric is thin but nicely made and survived the first wash just fine.
3.0,Looks great but the orthopedic Support is not there at all. The sole is thin and weak so the feet hit the ground and get tired easily!
3.0,"Earrings arrived with the posts bent over completely. The earrings were still usable after carefully bending them back. However, didn't lie flat to ear. Heavier than they look, but cute."
3.0,The material of shirt is okay it’s just the heart design on front is just the plasticly iron on and not fabric.
3.0,Buena calidad pero súper grande
3.0,"I bought this because of my love for movie pop corn .but it not done well,there is a stripe not completely painted."
3.0,smaller than advertised.
3.0,THE YARN HAD A VERY DAMP SMELL.  .I'VE WASHED IT WAITING FOR IT TO DRY. IF IT STILL SMELLS I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO USE FOR BABY PHOTOS.<br /> BETTER STORAGE IS RECOMMENDED.
3.0,Smaller than what I expected. But pretty
3.0,"Cheaply made, the lace began falling off after one use. Cute and they shipped fast but not worth the money."
3.0,My only wish is that someone would think of those of us who wear glasses!  These masks are really difficult to wear if you wear glasses.  There is nothing by the nose to tighten the fit so your glasses don't steam up!!
3.0,Fits fine but the color is more brown/tan than the pink pictured here.
3.0,"Overall I rate this a 3 star based on some of the features that seem to be more a liability in the swim.  I writing this review from the perspective of using these goggles for Triathlons.<br /><br />Look and Feel - 3.5 Stars<br />- They do look cool with the mirrored lenses.<br />- I ordered the Silver or Gray and the material looks a little cheap based on the color.<br />- For the feel the eye gasket feels comfortable, but I do have issues with the right side leaking unless I get the seal just right.<br />- The nose bridge on the goggle is too flat or I have a high bridge, but the material pushes onto the bridge of my nose and is uncomfortable.  This may be part of why I leak in the right goggle.<br /><br />Quick Release - 1 Star<br />- This I think is meant to be a feature, but from a triathlon perspective it disengages way too easily.  This becomes a liability in the swim leg of a triathlon where the arms, hands and feet are all over they place and you're taking hits to the head.  I really feel this will disengage and your goggles will be sinking to the bottom having a very negative impact on your race.<br /><br />Lenses - 5 Star<br />- The lenses provide clear visibility and do a good job of helping with the sun glare<br />- I have had no issues with lenses fogging, even when I have had them on my forehead which typically will fog quickly.<br /><br />I think they are just OK mainly due to the liability of the goggles coming off in the swim leg of a triathlon and because the nose bridge is too flat resulting in discomfort.  I wouldn't buy these again based on these 2 items and would highly recommend any triathlete or any person that has a nose bridge that isn't flat to their face to steer away from these goggles.  If neither of these are you, then buy away as the lenses are very good and the gasket is comfortable."
3.0,"It tangles so easily.  Hardly wear it cause I worry about having to untangle it again.  Not sure that it has anything to do with the company, just more the design of the necklace.  Love it, just tired of untangling it."
3.0,Didn't care for the inside band around the neck
3.0,One of the clips that are supposed to hold down the baseplate flap (that cover the screws that hold it to the board) broke when I tried to remove it. Seems poorly designed in that respect.
3.0,"Not the highest quality, but you get what you pay for.  Okay for the price."
3.0,i ordered a large when i am typically and medium and this barely got on my body. I plan on returning.
3.0,I was hoping this product would be much more lightweight and breathable in the hot Florida sun which it is not
3.0,"colors vibrant, comfortble"
3.0,A little on the small side but fun.
3.0,It’s super cute nice material for what you pay for but the straps were way longer than pictured. Even after tying they came down to my belly button. Another this is that there’s scooping underneath the breast area and it’s not pictured on here. It’s also a tighter fit that what is pictured as well. Overall I think it’s cute and I’ll wear it. If You want it to be looser I would order a size up!
3.0,"So I ordered a small and a medium. I tried on the small first because the medium look too big on the cup size. I'm 34b, 5'6 and 130lb. I usually fit a medium although I'm skinny not that curvy. The small fit perfectly although it did, I'm returning it because it was see-through in the back."
3.0,"Cute shoe but tight. What a bummer because I was highly impressed by the picture and even more so in person. I really like the quality, color & style but too tight for me. I plan on returning."
3.0,The elastic waist band rolls. nice soft fabric
3.0,The band is soft and looks good. It’s a little too long for my 7.75 inch wrist.
3.0,"The shirt itself fit fine, but the sleeves are a little tight."
3.0,"I ordered the DOUBLJU shorts (the ones with the ruffles and not the drawstring) in a size medium.  I'm 5'8, 139 lbs and they're too big, but workable.  But, they're not even from DOUBLJU, they're from Lily Clothing.  I didn't even realize until I went back to the SAME LINK (DOUBLJU) to order a size small for comparison.  The size small arrived and they're from DOUBLJU and they're the smallest shorts I've ever seen!  They're like a kid's small.  See pic (DOUBLJU shorts are on the right).  So, I have no comparison as the medium is too big and the small is WAY too small, but they're not even the same manufacturer so I have to send one or both back.  Amazon customer service said they'll send shorts from another manufacturer if they're out of your size so beware!  Very frustrating!"
3.0,Shorts seemed ok quality wise but they were too small for the size they were supposed to be.  I would order up 1-2 sizes
3.0,Slippers are very comfy and come as pictured but be careful because they run small
3.0,Super cómodo. La tela no es de muy buena calidad y debes tener cuidado con la costura. Pero si lo cuidas puedes usarlo por mucho tiempo. Para día y para noche
3.0,"The fit of these is great - they compress lightly and are a great base layer. I ordered a M. I'm 5'6"", wear a 6-8, and weight about 145 pounds. Everything is great except the sleeves. They are at least three inches too short and come just past the halfway mark on my forearm, so I was a little disappointed with this. The wrist part is too tight on my arms, so I am going to end up returning them."
3.0,these were bigger then expected
3.0,the symbol fell off the ring fell apart the quality is very simple it is not good
3.0,"Got this as a Christmas gift. Doesn't work - straight out of the box.<br />Update: I tried having a new battery installed and now it works. Hated having to do that with a brand new watch.<br />It's very attractive, but also cheap. I don't think the wristband will last long."
3.0,"The earmuffs are a different fabric from the rest of the hat, and they are very large. The hay might be cute on others,  but it looks weird on me. I also like that everything is in Chinese on the tags, it's just odd."
3.0,These look great and are not badly made but the eye pieces are impossible to see through. They are so dark you can’t see hardly at all and there are no holes to breathe through so we couldn’t wear it more than a couple minutes at a time
3.0,Should not have order one size up. Fabric is very comfortable.
3.0,The shirt fits great but is coming apart at the shoulder seam after 1 wash.
3.0,I didn't get the main thing I wanted which was the football player with the number 5 as shown in the picture. That's why I ordered this paticular package because my grandson's football number is 5 and I knew that woud have really made him happy
3.0,Beautiful bracelet. It does turn a little too quickly though and I was looking for something that would be good for everyday wear.
3.0,You get what you pay for. I have this same item in a 2X and it fits better than this 3X. I had hoped it would be a little bigger but it's not it's almost like it's the same size if not a tad smaller. It however fits my friend so I kept it but just be warned it is for a size 16-18 girl not anything bigger.
3.0,"I read the reviews and ordered down, but wow...odd sizing.<br />For reference I wear a 40C bra. I ordered these in the Lg/XLg size.  I figured they use tall models to illustrate but I'm5'3"" and it still doesn't cover my butt.  The front goes down almosg to my knees.  I laid it out on my bed and smoothed it out best I could (they come extremely wrinkled & all squashed into one bag)...& measured.  Here's what the yardstick said: It measured 25"" from center neck(labels) to hem in back & 25"" across from side seam to side seam (fyi: with the front overlapping)So that would mean it measures 50""(inches) around...which is usually what a 3X would measure. They are very flimsy material, like a very old well-worn tea shirt. The white one shows what's underneath.  So, it reminds me of the old-fashioned bed jackets & could serve that purpose, but for daily wear, not so much, to my way of thinking; so sadly, I'll be returning these.  Hope this info helps others."
3.0,"Ordered 6x i wear 4-5x, it was snug"
3.0,"The shirt shrunk the first time it was washed. I bought a 3XL, but now it's to snug to wear unless I'm in the mood for skin tight clothes."
3.0,"I was expecting a tighter more confirmed fit. These are basically loose, see through type spandex tank tops. I also would have liked a shelf type bra in them."
3.0,"If your boobs were naturally pushed in closer then this would work for you, it definitely shows side boob  and has no support. I was hoping for a bralette type fit/tightness- I returned this, but 3 stars for cuteness and crochet/stitching was done well"
3.0,I like the look of these Chokers. I did however have to purchase necklace extenders because they were too small.
3.0,I don’t see how these would even fit a child’s ear. Broke and wouldn’t re-latch
3.0,Def size up. Everything pointed to me getting a small and it does fit but it is snug. I’m very avg proportion and I’m afraid this will rip in the crotch bc of how snug and the lack of stretch bc it’s crappy polyester
3.0,I’m 5ft8 and these are knee high and not tight high. But they are still comfortable
3.0,Well made but not for skinny guys. It tight around the wrists and extremely baggy.
3.0,Very disappointed with the sizing.  Dress is super cute and you can't beat the price but would suggest ordering a size or two up from what your normally wear.
3.0,Love the look of this sports bra but it is very small! I ordered a medium and definitely would need a large or maybe even an extra large. It’s super cute and soft if it fit better!
3.0,they are warm
3.0,"Ok, I like it, but I guess its way too big for me, but its ok,"
3.0,I ordered this in white and I kinda wished I didn’t since it looks like I wrapped myself in a bedsheet 🤦🏻‍♀️Lol still somewhat cute so I’ll keep it but probably looks better in a different color 😅
3.0,I was really hoping this would work for me. Very cute for someone super skinny.
3.0,It’s comfortable and the inside material feels nice. I am 5’2” and 110 lbs and the small is big. It definitely doesn’t look like it does in the model. I also bought the cream color and it’s lighter than in the photo.
3.0,"VERY lightweight. Sleeves are quite long. Overall pretty good fit. Longer length, which I liked"
3.0,This was really cute but fits too big in chest and definitely needs something worn underneath
3.0,"I had to buy the 2T (for the bottoms) and the 4T (for the shirt) . Maybe if my daughter still wore a swim diaper, the bottoms would have fit better. But overall, the material is good and it’s an awesome deal for the price. Just wish the sizes were more accurate."
3.0,"My boyfriend needed sunglasses and wanted padded ones, He found these, and I gave them to him for a gift.. They do the job at a good price, but they’re not terribly durable. I don’t think the lenses are polarized. It’ll take him a while to go through there pairs, but frankly, there are better options out there."
3.0,"It's a shame that the seller chose to ship this in a flimsy envelope. The tentacles are very slender and delicate, and several of them did not survive the journey. Unlike in the case of a broken chain or twisted jump ring for other jewelry items, I don't have a way to repair this. Disappointing."
3.0,Its a bit small/tight but I love it!
3.0,"I wish I would have known it's for left handed people. I open it with my right hand and all the cards are upside down. Other than that, the product is great. I guess I just need to get used to opening it with my left hand :-)"
3.0,"Ordered a 10, received an 11. Could not figure out why were so big, then noticed while the box read 10, the inside label on the shoes read 11. Returned it and asked for replacement in the right size. We received a 10, but runs very wide and big, they were very loose and while my hubby loves the color and shape, we had to return them"
3.0,"She thinks it's too low in the front.  Not sure, shell wear it.  May have to exchange for different size.  Pretty top."
3.0,"Love the style and fit, except the arms are much too tight for my arms. I kept the shirt because I hope to lose weight and have the shirt fit better in my arms!"
3.0,It’s great quality but very tight on my 11 year old boy
3.0,Bars were longer than they were supposed to be.
3.0,Thin....  u will need a tank underneath or flesh tone foundations.
3.0,"The reviews on here are accurate.<br />This wallet is good enough but is seriously under-engineered and awkward. I bought the bigger one, it is an original and not a fake. This wallet is poorly designed and cannot hold too much of anything without quickly reaching its capacity. I had to omit several cards and photos because the wallet could not hold them.<br />The clasp that holds the wallet closed is extremely fragile and will bend if the wallet is closed on a bill or coin. Kind of understandable considering that the clasp is very thin metal, but still. If you do not deliberately watch the mechanism as you close it, this could happen to you. And even then, the clasp itself, tasked with holding all your valuables together, is woefully frail.<br />Ergonomically speaking the compartments need to be switched so that the credit cards are on one side and the bill storage is on the other. If you put more than 5 bills into the compartment, it wont close because the cc holder gets in the way.<br />They seem like a good company though and offered to replace my wallet when I informed them of the clasp issue (which I fixed myself). Decided that I will get another wallet when this one fails again (which it will, I am afraid)."
3.0,"We ordered a medium for my son and he loves it but it’s a SMALL medium. The fabric is not breathable at all. It’s more of a costume hoodie. Not a daily wear at all. Order a size up and realize you’re getting a knock off. Besides that, it’s a cool hoodie."
3.0,"Good umbrella overall, but one of the wires broke the first time I opened it. Such a bummer!"
3.0,While this bracelet is pretty to look at unfortunately the quality that I come to expect from all of Carolyn’s pieces is not there for this bracelet as it is for the coordinating ring. It is so thin that it hurts when I put it on my wrist. The bracelet scratches and hurts my wrist when I try to get it on. Not a good everyday bracelet at all.
3.0,I was in the market for a brown leather band watch. This is since but it's more red than brown. The photos the seller provides looks brown to me.<br /><br />None the less for the price I'm happy.
3.0,The material is plastic looking
3.0,"This is a very cute top but fits a bit small. The photo leads you to believe its a loose fitting top, which is what I was looking for."
3.0,This can’t be sterling silver.
3.0,The way the fabric connects to the neck is kinda weird . I had to get it altered
3.0,"My complaint is with the colors. Mainly the ""Garnet"" and the ""Ruby."" They are nearly identical, and both are ORANGE, not red!! I've lit them with a flashlight, they are not red at all, they are as orange as an orange! It is also very difficult to see the difference between the lavender Alexandrite and the Pink Tourmaline.<br />I received the earrings yesterday, so have not worn them yet. I like the small size as Is wear a 3mm diamond in my second piercing on my left ear 99% of the time. These are the same size and hopefully will complement the the diamond. I just wish the Ruby & the Garnet were actually red!"
3.0,Fabric seems cheap and is going to be very easy to wrinkle and very hard to iron. I would not have purchased it if I had known.
3.0,They are nice glasses but not for a woman that has a small face. ☺ my husband likes them so I just gave him my pair. I also didn't like how flimsy they are.
3.0,"The ad for this item stated it ran pretty small, and that was not an exageration.  I wear a Lg so ordered a 2xLg and it's snug. The heating elements do a decent job but its kind of a guessing game since the vest did not come with instructions.  Also, the illustration indicates the neck collar is heated and I've not been able to feel that.<br />The item is pretty good, for the money."
3.0,"Here's what I mean:  I love the fit, color, quality of the skirt. However, I actually thought I was made directly in Hawaii, ""not China"".  It was important to me to have a product made in USA and from Hawaii. The labels are all Hawaiian style on the garment - then I see ""Made in China"".  I only paid this much because I thought I was getting an authentic Hawaiian skirt.  Was very disappointed and disheartened.  So I gave it 3 stars because I felt deceived and paid too much."
3.0,"Cute top but this shirt is not true to size. If you order, size up."
3.0,"I love the drape, and look of the dress. However I find the neckline uncomfortably high and confining. The fabric is borderline quality. It's thinness would not work IF the amount of fabric were less full. I'll be returning."
3.0,"The belt is a string strap and I broke it while clipping. Light pink material, and the mask is larger than I thought. It's decent and has the same flair as if you got it from Spirit Holloween pop up stores."
3.0,should have gotten a bigger size since the large I normally wear does not fit as expected.
3.0,It has started to discolorate after 4th time on and the little crystals are coming off
3.0,I expected for graphics to be better
3.0,The elastic is for slender hands. Was to tight for myself and my 12 yr old daughter.
3.0,Nice but the little bunny is just glue it.....
3.0,Like the style but the nose piece hurts when wearing them too long. The lenses don't really block the sunlight very well
3.0,Larger than I thought they would be and they are somewhat lose.
3.0,"The tops is very light fabric and more faded out than photo.  The first one I ordered was too small, but the company was very accommodating, and send a larger one and didn't charge shipping.  The newer one is too large, but I didn't want to deal with it."
3.0,Llego demasido grande creo que deben revisar bien las tallas que fabrican
3.0,"For the price, this is a great sweater.  It runs longer than shown but is very good quality.  The only problem is that the color is NOT as pictured.  I would return it but will save it for another outfit as it was so inexpensive.  The color is khaki  -- as in khaki pants but is really an olive green."
3.0,"Looked cute for a Halloween shirt, but size is different on tag than what I ordered. Felt a bit snug. Also smelled kind of chemically when arrived. Again cute, but not high expectations"
3.0,I like it and I have purchased one with a different pattern the only difference is there is padding in the bra that makes it look a bit awkward. I ended up giving it away.
3.0,"Good quality material, sturdy, yet soft. The item does run a little small. Would buy again but would size up so it wouldn’t be as snug."
3.0,"Picture shows a hot pink or ""highlighter"" pink but it's actually a softer pink. Not pastel but definitely not hot pink."
3.0,Colors kinds of faded.
3.0,I am larger woman size XL and this was so big not flattering at all.
3.0,I haven't used these yet. Put them on and they fit.
3.0,Came in in a timely manner but was to small. Had to return for refund
3.0,Not my favorite.  No instructions on how to or suggestions on using them for easier comfort.
3.0,"Runs very small. Not as nice as the picture by a long shot. Not bad for the $ though. A good suit is $100+, so I got about what I excepted when this one arrived."
3.0,"The dress fits well and looks very good when you first put it on and don’t move much. However, because there is no elastic on the straps, they are very prone to slipping, especially as the dress stretches as you wear it. When the top strap slips, you end up flashing people. I spent most of the night I wore this pulling the straps up or watching that they weren’t slipping. Didn’t let me enjoy my night. It is a beautiful dress, the straps just aren’t practical. I haven’t worn it again after that first time since I haven’t wanted to deal with the stress of always being on strap watch."
3.0,"I have been buying koloa surf shirts because I like Thick T-shirts, I didn't notice lighweight version when I bought this T-shirt. This shirt is really lightweight so thin you can almost see through it."
3.0,I really don’t care for these to much. They’re a little to floppy for my son to wear. He’s 7 and tall but they remind me of something you would put on a baby doll except big kid size. The material is very soft but thin. I don’t think I’d recommend these to anyone.
3.0,The right hand side lens is slightly larger than the original lens. I went to the optician and cut the lenses and put them in my sunglasses. Additional costs are incurred.
3.0,Good price but they fog up so the kids didn’t use them. Past return window unfortunately. Quality is decent otherwise.
3.0,Cute bathing suit but was too big for our baby who was 4 Months at the time of use. The front side was way too low for her.
3.0,I wish I could say I loved this dress.  The bodice portion is too short. It looks like I am wearing a petite dress The bodice section is 2 inches shorter than other similar dresses I own. Its going back.
3.0,Had a nice look but sadly was too big for me. Normally small and extra small is what I wear.
3.0,"The fabric is too thin for a hoodie, but what really bothers me is the zippers on the side. They dig into you if you're not wearing an under shirt."
3.0,Tight for an adult
3.0,"I am not satisfied with the price and quality! It lost its color after a couple of wash. Even, it did lose its first shape. If we have to pay this amount of money, why not picking a better one? I like it only because it is comfortable for my workplace!"
3.0,"I bought this exchangeable handles for my O Bag that came with the rope handles which was perfect for the beach but not for a every day look. The color and quality of the handles are good. The only problem is the screw end is a little too short. It will not fit the  bag, top cover and the inner bag all together. The screw is good for the main frame of the bag with no additions."
3.0,"Small, I got them large like every other sports bra and they fit me like a medium. I reccomend getting one size larger"
3.0,"I don't know if it was an issue with the particular shade I chose (orange) or the dye brand, but I have had much better success with other dyes. I looked up the orange color online to make sure it would be the correct shade, since I was hoping for a bright orange rather than a burnt orange color for a pair of cream suede shoes that were looking dingy. According to Fiebing's own color card, it was supposed to be a bright orange, but it definitely was not. It was more of a burnt orange/brown color, and, on top of that, no matter how many coats I applied I could not get it not to come out patchy. I ended up giving up and dyeing the shoes black with another brand's dye, and they turned out fantastic."
3.0,"Doesn't feel like 90% cotton, more like a wool acrylic blend. The pockets are fake - not actual pockets as I wanted."
3.0,"They’re very cute, even though one of the moons don’t face the right way but overall they’re nice."
3.0,It's charcoal gray not black. It runs 3 sizes small too. I ordered a 5x. I wear a 2x in top. It was a perfect fit.  I can see this may shrink a size when washing. Therefore a couple wears I'll be lucky. Also the color is more dingy than expecting. The cut is not long on torso. It's a bit shorter than I would have liked wit slots on side. For the price it's okay but a little disappointed.
3.0,Diferent to the pic... and the color is not de same
3.0,Loved the bracelet however it broke after only 5 days of ownership!
3.0,"I ordered a white sweater and received an off-white sweater with a creamy tone to it. The fit is good,  the material feels really nice but I was not happy that I didn’t get a true white As you can tell by the photo. The sweater I received is on the left... true white color to compare it to is on the right"
3.0,"Do not purchase if you have even reasonably large hands!!<br />The bracelet does stretch but it barely made it over my hand and once around my wrist it was uncomfortably tight and the beads were really far apart.<br />(Full disclosure I have very large hands) so I was only halfway expecting this to fit well, but this was toooo tight."
3.0,Kinda clunky but ok for price
3.0,Broke after three weeks
3.0,It is a little to small for my comfort.
3.0,Too Big. I went off the sizing chart in listing and ordered a Large. I’m a 36C… 5’2” 125 pounds. The medium would have fit better. Also my main complaint is the pads slide around while wearing it. The edges poke out and show bumps under shirt. I will wear them to sleep or out in the yard.
3.0,"I will have to return the item due to the color.  The color says white, but it's actually Ivory/Bone."
3.0,They do their job in the shower; well made for the price; but not comfortable enough to walk around in.
3.0,i wish the photo showed the neckline. its very ridgid. I wish i could be more rounded.
3.0,"Very cute, but the blowers are not strong enough to keep it completely full at all times. It was a challenge, but the costume itself was very cute."
3.0,"The credit cards slots are small, making it hard to insert cards."
3.0,A lot larger than I expected. Quality decent but not the beat. But price is good. Haven’t been able to use yet. And won’t for awhile since it’s pretty big
3.0,Pretty bag- but no where near as dark of purple. I wish I had a picture so you could see but it was a gift for my mother in law for Christmas.
3.0,I loved the blouse but it was way too small.
3.0,Was too small says extra large but fits like a small its long enough but too small
3.0,Remains very stiff and is not very pliable
3.0,More like spandex other than tshirt cotton material.
3.0,"Material is thin, leg holes are large, butt is small. Ships from China."
3.0,Little snug in the middle but overall looks cute.
3.0,They’re cute flip flops but unfortunately they ripped after only having them for 1 month. The glue that holds the shoe didn’t hold up to my kid wearing the shoes a handful of times.
3.0,"Yes, it said elastic waist band. What it doesn’t tell you is that the elastic is 2 inches thick and all the way around. It’s a little overkill in my opinion, I ended up cutting the elastic out to just have the drawstring.<br />I would also size up, if not 2 sizes up, if you want a looser fit."
3.0,"Don't know how long each of these will last.  They are pretty thin and lightweight.  Most will do what I need to have done, but wish the larger ones were a little more sturdy.  Nice package deal with a variety."
3.0,Nice socks but hard to keep on bigger feet.  Not what I expected for the price.
3.0,"Somewhat as described, prompt delivery. Would purchase again. Pleased with product."
3.0,Fabric was very scratchy. I didn't like the feel so I am returning it.
3.0,I ordered a 32B and the around fit great with no slipping but the cup was quite small so I might suggest ordering a larger cup size.
3.0,I suggest you order two sizes bigger than you actually need
3.0,Bought the hat for my son it didn't fit him didn't fit me but my wife decided to keep it and she was going to wear it
3.0,"The fit is a bit strange on me personally, but It is an overall nice top. The layering falls in a way I didn't expect it to. Overall size was expected."
3.0,"Bought 2xl I am a size 14 fits true to size, thin material wrinkles easily if you don't like to iron like I do will be a task, feels delicate like if I snag it will rip, but color is bright and beautiful"
3.0,"Dress is as pictured and fits true to size.  The waist did not fall in the right place, I tried to pull it down, scrunch it up, but it wouldn't look right so I ended up returning."
3.0,Must be ironed
3.0,It looks nice but feels kinda rubbery kinda cheap
3.0,Emblem on hat is ironed on. Bill of hat not evenly connected. Not the quality I expected but usable.
3.0,"I stay big, I had to fix it in a tailor."
3.0,The chest area looks awkward. I never wore it.
3.0,These earrings are nice but they are not the nice bright blue that they appear in the picture. They are a dark blue.
3.0,"These were no where near as pretty as the picture makes them seem. Also, they look like they are made of plastic. I wouldn't recommend for adults but young kids who want to dress up, these are perfect. Otherwise, don't buy."
3.0,"I bought this because I thought it would make my [[ASIN:B009KYJAJY Casio Men's MDV106-1AV 200M Duro Analog Watch, Black]] look more like a Rolex Submariner, and this band is commonly bought with the watch. It's not exactly perfect though.<br /><br />First off, I had to bend the clips on the band that hold in the spring bar. If you don't bend the clips, there's no possible way you can get the ends of the spring bar to get into the holes that hold in the bars on the watch itself and hold in the band. I got one end pretty good, but the other end is a bit loose, so I'll need to do a bit more tinkering to get a tighter fit.<br /><br />Secondly, I'm not sure if my product is defective or what, but the clasp doesn't 100% snap shut when it's closed. It wiggles a bit, which kind of annoys me. I have a Seiko watch with a metal band and a similar locking mechanism, and when it's snapped shut, it doesn't wiggle up and down at all. It's not too noticeable, but just noticeable enough to get on my nerves.<br /><br />Third off, a few days after I put the band on, I noticed there were some strange scuff marks on the clasp. They were't really scratches, but scuffs that I can't get off. At first glance they look like smudges, but when you try to rub them off, they don't rub off.<br /><br />Overall the band is alright and makes my watch look a bit like a Rolex Submariner. but I'll eventually start looking for another metal band to replace this one."
3.0,Jar size to small
3.0,"The outfit design is super cute, but I feel like it was made very cheap. The straps are just stands of thin material and the whole top in all seems to be cheap material. The pants are made with somewhat better material but they were very very big on my daughter. Also, you can see where there was a button sown on then removed and aligned lower."
3.0,"Size wayyyyyyy down. Quality is good, it's very cute, but this is beyond over sized. I am normally a M/L in tops, and I probably could have worn an extra small. I had to tighten the straps as far as they would go to keep it from falling off me. That said, I think I can still make it work and it's good quality for the price."
3.0,Love the style of the dresses.. but did not like the feel of the material.. to scratchy.. no stretch.. I sized up two sizes fits PERFECT. If I were the company.. I would use softer material with stretch.. these dresses were beautiful and very flattering that's why I kept them. Make sure you size up two sizes.. that's what I did and they fit perfect. I would have given five stars instead of three if the material would have been softer!
3.0,"For reference I wear size 10  & 34 C . Size M is super small. Not flattering at all. If you are slim, then it’s right fir you."
3.0,Its Ok.
3.0,"Earring are ugly. But, with a black dress. Bracelet and necklace is perfect."
3.0,"cant expect much for the price, you kinda get what you paid for. runs a size big tho"
3.0,Says white but is silver glitter color I needed for all white event so returned
3.0,"i guess it worked good, uv protection is working well"
3.0,I'm not really a fan of this product at all unfortunately and I was really excited about it not only is it too small which is an easy fix but I don't like the fabric. It's almost a shiny nylon looking color and if it wasn't fabric one could say that it looks like that is the best way that I could describe it. When you get it in your hands it does not adequately reflect what it looks like on the picture which is unfortunate. However it's still kind of cute for what it is it's just not what I was expecting. They also took a very long time to ship it and you have to pay for shipping and they did not tell me that prior to my purchase. I received this item as discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased opinion and if you find this review or any of the other reviews that I have written helpful please read it as so thank you
3.0,"Not for what I needed. I tried the Jive, Jodie, and Jo Jo. The Jive was very small and good enough if you just want to carry phone, money, and passport. Maybe a candy bar too. :) The Jodie was a bit larger but did not like the side pocket. The Jo Jo was large enough to carry 4 passports, wallet, phone, tissues, and a few snacks for 2 kids. The outer most pocket was large enough to hold a Pixel 2 (the smaller of the current smartphones). The inner zipper had no problem with 4 passports which was key in making sure they stayed secure as I look in and out of my purse looking for stuff for the kids. The large pocket was probably large enough to stuff a 7"" tablet though I never did. The one complaint I had with this bag is the strap. I love the Jive strap - soft smooth woven fabric. The strap for the Jodie was like luggage strap and too thin - think like backpack bottom straps. The strap for the Jo Jo was like luggage strap width but similar to backpack style so the edges are rough, rough enough to snag the more delicate shirts. So not so happy about that. They should have just used the same strap as the Jive and it would have been perfect."
3.0,Was okay for the price. Did the job for the day.
3.0,This item may be cute but it is quite thin and rips easily. I returned the item.
3.0,The bracelet was nice but within 3 months it was falling apart
3.0,Loves these but they keep falling out 😔
3.0,I don't like the &#34;satin&#34;
3.0,"El color muy lindo, la calidad no es buena , el precio muy alto"
3.0,"Not really well made, but ok.  A bit small.<br />Laundered ok."
3.0,"The ladybug is so cute - sparkly dots with just the right weight and right size.  The color was disappointing as I was hoping for a cherry red color ladybug.  Instead, this bug is an orange color and went more with tropical colors instead of primary colors.  I've included photos of the Pandora  &#34;Letter&#34; charm that has a red heart as well as Ninaqueen's &#34;Air Ballon&#34; so you can see the variance of color.  The pattern is mirrored on the opposite side.  If it would have been red, it would have gotten 5 stars."
3.0,Warning this dress will shrink a size or 2 after washing. It was a perfect prior to washing.
3.0,Good purchase. I have a varieties of color to show in summer
3.0,"Overpriced, a little different than cousin Eddie’s but close enough"
3.0,"This is low quality jewelry, I thought I might like it but when I saw it in person I was disappointed. The 2 rings on the bracelet  make it look like a promise bracelet, which may or may not be something you want. Either way though, when you are wearing the bracelet these 2 rings take the main focus so keep that in mind."
3.0,Very very upset this is not black it is navy blue... waste of my money due to no details on the actual colors on the tshirt!!
3.0,"When I saw this dress I had to have it. When I received it it didn't look like the picture. The color was a very dull pink. It the material was cheap, but the fit was great."
3.0,I purchased nine purses for my teenage granddaughters in different colors. I only purchased one in this color and wish I had not. The brown and black look better. They all came in with a lot of wrinkles. It's been six weeks and they  are not using them. They all went back to there old purses they had previously.
3.0,"fit well but small. also, the material does not feel very durable."
3.0,I love the way it looks I just now need to figure out how it's going to stay on my head. This piece doesn't include the normal &#34;comb&#34; like pieces that tierra's usually have that stick in your hair.
3.0,Not very flattering.  Nice but not my style!
3.0,"Love the bra. Very pretty design. Fits me great everywhere, but the armpit area comes up too high causing irritation and discomfort"
3.0,"Good sun protection. But I feel it is overly priced, considering the feel of the material. Should have been priced @$10"
3.0,it was really small
3.0,Not true size.
3.0,Color wasn’t what I expected
3.0,"Love the pattern of the hat, hate the fabric :(<br />It makes my hair very frizzy after 8 hours at work. And after washing it I have to iron it every time ( usually my dryer takes care of wrinkles on all of my clothes and surgical hats) . Will not buy it again."
3.0,"La talla indicada muy pequeña, no es la que indican"
3.0,I ordered a medium just a little to big
3.0,Didn’t like the pockets.
3.0,The Quality is very good. But too small for what I want to use for😣
3.0,The stones are very pretty. The metal looks tarnished and twisted and it can’t be straightened. It looks used.
3.0,"I mean... it's ok. But its cut strangely. The material is like a ribbed material, not a smooth material. The scalloped edges added to the bottom aren't connected properly. So it's a 3/5"
3.0,"They were slightly too big and slightly too long for me, but still cute enough to wear."
3.0,Runs a little small but a little thicker and warmer than a regular long sleeve t
3.0,"it is beautiful do not get me wrong, it came early which is always great. it came in a bubble-wrapped inside small envelope. The biggest problem I have is that it was BROKEN when it arrived. I opened the package and pulled the choker out of the little clear plastic bag it was in and two different pieces were hanging loose in a way that they should not because the same part on the other side was not damaged in any way. I noticed a chain link that was pulled open and twisted slightly. I was able to re-hook the two dangling pieces back onto the chain link and push it back together hopefully fixing the whole matter. It is just the point that I HAD to fix it, is the major issue I have. Otherwise it is beautiful and just what I wanted/needed for my costume. so long as it stays together and does not come apart again too soon!"
3.0,"These are really comfortable and fit well. That being said, the white are completely see through. I bought these because they said they aren't see through. Disappointing but they are comfortable."
3.0,I like the shape of the necklace and that the ring can expand or reduce at your needs the brazalete is okay as the earrings but the gold color looks to fake and the materials for the necklace look like plastic until you touch it you realize it is metal
3.0,Great looking glasses. Look and feel way more expensive. Cannot handle any abuse however and broke after 3 weeks of use but you get what you pay for.
3.0,I'd say this item was about 3 sizes smaller than I expected.
3.0,It's okay but the rubber feet have to be glued to keep them on and then it still tends to creep as you use it.
3.0,Even cuter in person! However if you are anything other than a very short person it will not fit you. I am 5'7&#34; and the large jacket had 3/4 sleeves on me. Sadly I had to return it.
3.0,"It was a bit smaller than I had anticipated and not as long as I would have liked, but it's definitely wearable.  Next time, I would order the next larger size."
3.0,"In the picture, it is a nice ivory color. Mine is a yellow-orange color. Not at all what I was hoping for."
3.0,"These are much darker than shown, almost all black. The flag is hard to find because of the color."
3.0,"The bottoms fit great, only thing is I am a 36 DD and the top is a little too tight for them. Overall happy with the suit."
3.0,"The first one i put on,the strap broke immediately but the rest all held together. Definately gets the job done!"
3.0,"I love the way this dress fits me. I get a lot of compliment when I wear it. Plussss it has pockets.  The thing that I’m disappointed about is that the dress started fraying at the seam after 5 washes. And I washed it in delicate cycle. Maybe handwashing, literally, will make this dress last longer. I can’t even repair it, so can’t wear it anymore."
3.0,"I like the stretch of the the compression sock, but they didn't cover my calf which was disappointing."
3.0,Really pretty but way too short. It was right below my butt. I’m 5’10” size large. The cut is very low so it will have a lot of cleavage. I just wish it was longer
3.0,"The dress is super cute, but the lining it has is necessary. However, the lining only covers half you butt (I'm 5'7"" and 145 lbs). Unfortunately with the short lining the dress is seethrough back there"
3.0,"The pattern on the front is exactly the same on the back so it's hardly a world map. Plus it was really small; I got it for my girlfriend, she's pretty short but it was still really small"
3.0,"Horrible material could have been better, color and print is beautiful.. I wish quality of the dress was little better, sad but had to return"
3.0,It's OK for a back-up.
3.0,The material was too think
3.0,The dress fits well. The the material is polyester. You will definitely need to buy a fitted slip for a liner and possibly replace the zipper but the style is nice
3.0,nothing special about them my son wanted glasses but eyesight was fine
3.0,"Fashionable, but the top was a different yellow than the pants."
3.0,"It fits, but there is no hole to fasten the button."
3.0,I personally didn't like this hat.  Way too big for my head.
3.0,"I like the way these things look, I really do. But there's a reason the price is so low. Two of them broke within a week. Kinda makes me annoyed."
3.0,The texture the style the color
3.0,"My favorite movie for years when I was a kid was My Girl, and because I was a weird kid (it's a weird movie for a young child to like in the first place) I wasn't put off by the fact that the mood ring in that movie was the catalyst for the death of the main character's friend played by the Home Alone kid (it's been a while since I've seen the movie) and really wanted a mood ring. Since I had a couple of mood rings as a kid, as well as this sort of strong if unusual childhood movie associated with them, I saw this and felt like it was cute and whimsical. I think having had one of these growing up and indulging in getting one for the sake of childhood memories is really the main reason to recommend this product, not because it is a great quality.<br /><br />Quality:<br />This is a tricky assessment. Judging this as a toy ring, it is excellent quality; if I were judging it as actual jewelry I would be very disappointed. The material is very thin and it doesn't feel particularly, although it is put together nicely. It's very much like something you'd expect to find for a couple of dollars at a novelty store or of a quality you'd find in children's jewelry. Sometimes when you see very cheap novelty rings it looks like the &#34;stone&#34; or setting could just snap off, and that's not actually the case here, it's put together nicely and the colored part of the ring is firmly set in place, it's just made of a very, very light material.<br /><br />Size:<br />I would think it would be great for a child, but on the smallest setting it fits on my largest finger, and even though I have smallish hands they are not child sized hands, so while it will adjust up pretty large it will no adjust down to child sized. This is no fault of the manufacturing; it is described as an adjustable size 8, which I think is accurate, it just starts as a size 8 and goes bigger, it does not get any smaller than that. If you need something larger than a ring size 8 it will be fine, smaller and it probably won't work.<br /><br />Mood:<br />It does change colors nicely. In wearing it a couple of hours it has cycled through a lot of colors including distinct purple, pink, yellow, teal, and dark blue, and variations and blends of those colors. I don't think my mood or the temperature of my hands or anything else has changed all that much in the last few hours, so I'm not sure what's triggering the change, but the color changing is pretty cool. It did not come with a mood-color guide, which I wouldn't put any stock in or use as psychological advice, but when I was a child was a fun part of having a mood ring and might be a disappointment.<br /><br />Price:<br />This is why I took off stars. There's nothing really wrong with the ring itself, it's just only worth about $3. It's more like something you'd want to get at a novelty store as a toy or gag gift for $2 or maybe $5 at the *most,* but not any more, especially since it doesn't even come with a card showing which colors go with which moods, making it hard to give as a gift (it would have to be a gag gift or a stocking stuffer type thing because it's not nice jewelry you'd give to impress someone!). It's cute and good quality if you think of it as a toy or to bring back childhood memories, but it's certainly not real jewelry or something that's going to hold up well. I would happily recommend this if it were only $3, but not since it's selling for a fair bit more than that.<br /><br />I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. The discount is not contingent upon a positive review, and my reviews are an honest account of my experiences with and opinions of the products I receive."
3.0,Was worth what I paid for it.  Pretty but not quality
3.0,"was not very impressed, everything was secure, but cannot hold more than maybe 3 or 4 cards, and when I tried to use more the plastic pieces that opperate the trigger broke."
3.0,"Super cute, super soft... fits well my only issue is I wish they were a tiny bit more snug around the top so they wouldn’t slide off."
3.0,This was a gift for a friend to go on a charm bracelet and it is cute but the picture is very hard to make out. Even my son who has very good vision had to ask me what it was a picture of. It did ship very quick which was much appreciate but I wish the picture was better quality.
3.0,Good material but colr is a little faded
3.0,"The shoulder straps were completely not placed right. They are off to the sides too much and cut into the skin. Kind of cheap quality too, but it's a cheap price so..."
3.0,"It's decent, but you get what you pay for and that is a whole lot of cheapness.  Forget about trying to &#34;buckle&#34; the strap while it's on the wrist.  The silicone is too soft which requires a second pair of helping hands to buckle.  But, I bought it for my 10 year old son for Christmas and he likes it so that's all that matters."
3.0,"Too short and too thin! Not spandex material and more of a shiny white, material resembles sheer curtains. 🥴"
3.0,I am 5'6 and 130 lbs and I ordered a Medium and it is made for someone with a short torso..
3.0,"Picture shows solid black gloves , however I received stripped gloves.  Gloves were good fit for one size fits all .works fine with electronic devices."
3.0,"This is a gorgeous dress. I love the fit, and the flow of the dress. The material is a little thick, but overall nice. I wore this to my aunt's 70th birthday party, and received so many compliments."
3.0,"The size and color were exactly what I was looking for, but the settings we're sort of aweful.  The tines we're so bulky that they actually blocked a large portion of the stones, which were already sort of petite.  Really could have and should have been better for the price."
3.0,The dress is made well but didn’t stretch. Had to return. But overall it is a very nice dress for the price.
3.0,Good quality material but too short
3.0,Not an accurate size
3.0,"I got these pants in a larger size because I have a big butt. However, I was surprise that they were real fitted, infact they kept coming coming down, so next  time I will get a smaller size"
3.0,The seams started undoing within two days.
3.0,"I'm a size large but had read previous review about the product running small so I went with an XL and fitted perfectly.<br />It is made of polyester as stated in the description so it is like a jersey type of material and thin. Since it is not made of cotton, it won't keep you warm."
3.0,If you are 5' and under this may hit your lower legs. If you are any taller it will be awkward.
3.0,The materials are solid not cheap fabric but either the medium is on the smaller side or im on the fat side. Think I am on the fat side. 😞
3.0,Fit a little sung. And a little long. Not to bad  But it will work my daughter wears a 2t and I bought a 3t will do the justice for our pregnancy announcement
3.0,the rings were ok
3.0,"They are cute. Quite comfortable. They stank so bad when I opened the box though. Smelled like a tire. Not sure if they are really all Leather because they don’t smell like it, but they are a cool looking boot. Laces are just for looks. They don’t really have a function. Luckily they fit well<br />Enough so they are not needed."
3.0,"Pretty but poor quality. Dress ripped on my daughter while at a wedding!! It is very beautiful , photoed well but it’s a one time wear for sure! If you are looking for something that will look great in a picture, this is your dress. The dress runs like 2-3 sizes big! I am not kidding! I had to order a 2nd dress a size smaller from my daughter actual size and that one was still very big. Amazon was excellent in doing a same day delivery of the 2nd dress I ordered the day of my brother’s wedding! Excellent service!<br />Beautiful dress, cheap quality and poorly made!<br />I gave the dress 3 stars because it is very pretty.<br /><br />Oh and one of the pic, the one with just my daughter the little one is worn with an underslip that gave it a poof!"
3.0,"Cute, but I have muscles and the shirt was tight around my lats and shoulders.  Runs small if you have any sort of muscles in your back/shoulders.  Have to return."
3.0,scratches easly and buckle is too big
3.0,Fabric is thin and socks do not quite fit.  Love the colors!
3.0,"I absolutely love these glasses! Perfect size for my somewhat smaller face...very flattering on most face shapes (tried on with my friends). So why three stars? The brand &#34;Giselle&#34; is printed on the lens of the glasses in the upper right hand corner. This makes the glasses look cheap. I thought it was a sticker but it's printed on and not easy to scratch off (I didn't want to ruin the lens). This is the only part of the glasses that I don't like. Also, they are a bit on the lighter side, but that's fine for the price."
3.0,"This is so cute, but so tight."
3.0,"My first impression got off to a bad start - When taking the glasses out of the case, the case came apart because the fit of the glasses and the case was too tight.  This fault in the design tainted my view of the overall quality.of the glasses.  It also would have been nice to be able to adjust the nose rests to fit my face but overall and after my first impression the glasses were of better than average quality.  Really, there were no faults with the glasses, it was all in the design of the glass case.  Two obvious faults are: the size of the glass case; and the top of the case with the clip is too loose giving the impression that if one clips the case to one's clothing, the bottom would fall out and therefore the glasses would be lost..  My trepidation with using the glass case makes the case unusable for me.  In the end, it would be great if the manufacturers would correct these two faults for future purchasers.  If they do please send me one so that I could have a usable one"
3.0,Large size is too small
3.0,Like this! Wish it had more pockets. But love the color!
3.0,ok product for the price.<br />pros:<br />what you get for the price<br />cat3 1000volt 10amp rated<br />product as shown in the picture is what you get<br />way faster shipping then what amazon says.<br /><br />cons.<br />no listings/ratings on cables (expected for the cost) so dont put too much trust in the cables. and i wouldnt use them for anything past 240v.<br /><br />sum: you get what you get for $2.50 leads. still need to use them in the field
3.0,This is my second review with this seller. As much as I love this brand of yoga pants ...I dislike the false advertisement for the Navy color. IT IS NOT NAVY...not even close. More like a slate grey blue. Pictures are inaccurate. Buyer beware.<br /><br />Please update your photos seller !
3.0,"I got this a while ago,  I'm still waiting for it to work, bring me some monies. I should have asked how long it takes for it to work!<br />I'll come back with update, when it's bringing me the jackpot!!!  :-)"
3.0,"I ordered this dress in XL.  It was a very loose fit but the way the dress is cut it is fine. I definitely could have ordered a L and it would have fit fine.  I usually wear L-XL and tend to wear my cloths looser.<br />This dress is very comfortable. Thin material.  Sown ok. Over all I like it.  I am 5'9"", 155 lbs., 36D. Wear size 10-12."
3.0,The quality is cheap but I got what I paid for.
3.0,Very cute and decent material but fits way too small
3.0,"I didn't use yet as my trip still coming up, but just to try on is a little tight. Maybe they should do sizes options."
3.0,"Disappointed in the pocket size, for such a large bag felt the pockets should have been larger."
3.0,All my weight is in my butt area so thought I needed a X large but should have went with large very stretchy just get the size u wear<br /> I like it looks like the picture but it's very thin sure u gone see my undies n it was my fault with the side going to fix it myself
3.0,"These fit well & are super comfy; however, if you have a belly like I do, these fall down :-("
3.0,Quality is very good charm is nice but it is very small. Smaller than a dime.
3.0,"I ordered this shirt since I live in Florida and a part of my wardrobe are shirts like this. After reading the reviews and seeing that the shirt did run a little small, I ordered an extra-large instead of a large. Now the First lining of the shirt fit a little snug, but the second one was nice a flowy. Since the back is open and has criss crossed straps there really is no way to wear a bra, but I would have to since the way it fit in the back left it open and if I had to move or bend down a certain way, anyone near me would be able to see everything. It just didn’t fit right at all in away. I am really disappointed because I was excited about this shirt. I’m not sure who this would fit correctly, really. I wasn't even comfortable taking pictures to share to show how it fit only because of the fact of the way that it fit.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I have not been monetarily compensated for my review and my thoughts are completely genuine and 100% my own"
3.0,No warranty
3.0,Bought for  a 4 year old but waaay to big. Fits my 10 year old.
3.0,"For a men's watch, the band is super short. It barely fits on my husbands wrist. He isn't a super large man. He has it on the very last hole and a<br />Has said he is going to replace the strap with something  bigger. The watch itself has survived so far. We are a few weeks in."
3.0,Little smaller than I thought but looks really pretty
3.0,Not what I expected. Fits like skinny jeans.
3.0,"This Shaw/Poncho was very soft but it really  is just a square blanket with a slit up the middle. For reference I am 5'4 and about 140lbs, and it just looked like I was wrapped up in a blanket. It was the true definition of ""I woke up like this.."" Maybe if it wasn't so large it would fit how I wanted but it's One Size fits all."
3.0,Was very confused on the size. The length seemed perfect for my toddler but the bottom of the sock was a little big for her foot (and her foot isnt that small). Thought maybe it would fit for an older toddler but then the length would get shorter.  Not sure about these.
3.0,The colors are bright with this bag... The fabric is thin.... I am not sure if I would trust it with heavier items.
3.0,"The wig is EXTREMELY long. I don't like having to cut wigs after ordering but this one definitely will have to be, I'm 5'5 and it's past my butt. I don't like that it came curled,  as this makes it look more 'wiggy', although after brushing it out, it looks 100% better! It'll look even better once straightened. The problem is that because of how long it is and the curls, I think, it looks very thin. VERY thin. It IS thin to begin with, but the length makes it even worse, which leads me to consider just chopping it shoulder length. Another issue and the biggest, most annoying one: the top front of it shows through slightly. You'll have to wear the bangs a certain way and be careful because of how thin it is and how much it's weighed down, it will easily show through to the cap underneath. Other than that, the color is beautiful, but isn't ombre as it shows in the picture. It doesn't shine at all, but brushes out well. Overall it's good for the price. OH, and because of the length, it's also hard to manage when actually wearing. The way the hair falls looks awkward, another reason that I'm going to be cutting it!"
3.0,"Very cheap material, rips easily, but it looks very nice while on"
3.0,"Way more green than the picture, but sturdy and comfortable."
3.0,"cute, but extremely thin"
3.0,"This hat is too small for an adult.  One side higher than other.  Disappointed!  Would have returned it, but too much trouble to do so."
3.0,Very thin plastic-y kind of material. Color and image is blurry.
3.0,"not sure of the color,and it smells bad,dont know if the smell would get better or no smell at all. the size of the bag is great."
3.0,"I bought a pair of these in my size, but they are too small. I can get my feet in them but not comfortably. It's too bad because I can tell the soles are comfortable. Of course, now I've work them to work so I can't return them."
3.0,This is for the big breast women
3.0,"Good suit, but top too small."
3.0,Cute top but to big. Ill be exchanging for smaller size
3.0,"But....the backing on them is soooo long! Any hugs are sure to puncture the backside of the ear, ouch! Very hesitant on keeping them because of that factor. Otherwise super cute and affordable."
3.0,I did not have much luck. The fit was not flattering at all. I was hoping for a little more help with compression. If you want to simply be covered and don’t need any sort of compression then these might work for you. They were a lot thick for working out and not flattering in general.
3.0,"Very simple and girly look dress. It looks pretty for this price but I do not like rubber band inside of the waist line. It was too tight and a bit higher then waist so I had to remove it. I would prefer more flexibility. It doesn't have a zipper or any buttons to put on comfortably. Lace fabric on top looks nice but it is very fitted, not stretchy."
3.0,I have a hard time finding hats to fit and this was a little too small for me.  I also thought the picture showed more of a silvery finish to it.  I knew the color was gray - was just expecting more of a silvery tint...  Plan on returning due to size...
3.0,It's nice but it is really small and gets tangled really easily
3.0,Ordered xl was sent xxl. Product runs small
3.0,"This Patty top looks just ok on me. It's a beautiful color and a true wrap top which I like. However, it is very low cut. It looks low cut on the model but I wasn't expecting it to be quite that low. My girls were too exposed for someone my age. I purchased a mint green tank top to wear underneath to take care of the problem.  It matches perfectly but between the tank top and the layers of the wrap top, it feels bulky now. I'm keeping the shirt but it isn't a great match or fit for me but it might be for someone else. For reference I'm 5'10""  153lbs,  36C and bought a large."
3.0,I love how these feel on my heel I have heel spurs but it’s super uncomfortable to the toe and ball area
3.0,"Very cute, the material is that weird polyester stretch material, so a weird silky texture. Head band is pretty big, so tiny headed kids, this ain't your head band."
3.0,This is a midriff shirt not able to be tucked in like the photo. Very cute though may need to wear a body suit under it
3.0,I am still and always will be pleased with my Amazon products. Thank you.
3.0,"Small waist, huge in legs, but the color was a perfect match"
3.0,They are not what you would expect but you cannot get hurt at 5.00 dolars.
3.0,"I wear a size 18 comfortably, and I couldn't get these over my thighs let alone my hips! I ordered the 2x.  Definitely runs a few sizes too small!"
3.0,"Nice , I'm personally just not a fan of the material.  Kept rolling up its kind of a nylon feel. I prefer more spandex that stays put ."
3.0,Nice band but did not fit my fitbit Versa lite
3.0,"The sleeve hem on the dress was ripped when I received it.  I can't return and get a new one because the item is out of stock, so I guess I'm stuck having it fixed.<br />Other than that, the dress fits perfectly."
3.0,Good fabric. Fits. Needed to go up a size though because it doesn't hit the same way as it does on the pic on me
3.0,"These are great glasses, and do the trick on rainy days, snowy days and terrible weather, but it you are expecting them to be great quality, heck, these are inexpensive and made in China or some such place!  That being said, I have had this pair for over a year and they are still together!"
3.0,Beautiful but had to return because it was to small for even my phone
3.0,Huge. I ordered a large expecting it to be big but this is more like a 2x. I cant fit it. So I gave ot to my roommate. I mean the material is silky  and soft and seems well sewn together but it just too big
3.0,smaller than size stated and short in lenght
3.0,"Very pretty design, but the &#34;gold&#34; turns pretty quickly."
3.0,"These are super warm. Love that, but the waistband folds over to easily so it needs constant adjustments."
3.0,The fabric is so thin in actual and cheaply made.
3.0,"Dress was too short (I'm 5'10&#34; and it stopped well before my ankles) and my cleavage hung out too much - it's just too low cut. Also, the fabric was see-through. It was comfortable, just not the right proportions for my build."
3.0,"Seems like a decent belt. However, the new belts I have from the last few years seem like synthetic leather. I have 2 from work for wearing a uniform. The older one is seriously heavy & stiff. The second one is light, same thickness and not very sturdy. This new belt I am reviewing is like the second one from work. Just doesn't have that heavy duty leather feel. Maybe cows these days are not as heavy duty as they were some years ago. This one doesn't appear to be laminated leather like a few I had that broke. They had 2 thin pieces of leather and some fake fiber sandwiched in between. Time will tell on this one."
3.0,"Size runs big, style is cute just like the photo."
3.0,Not true to image. Came with circle and two hearts but no pink bead or stethoscope....just disappointed 😕
3.0,The clasp is hard to close on it and the hearts edges is a bit sharp so definitely made for an adult not a child.
3.0,Good for preteen tiny but nice
3.0,Nice glasses. A little loose fitting at times.
3.0,Product broke within one use. Would not buy again.
3.0,They run on the smaller side!
3.0,Bought these for my pandora bracelet it's my daughter birthstone color. After awhile the gems start coming out.
3.0,This is not the first Bates belt that I have owned. It’s not as elastic as the other two but just adequate.
3.0,"They’re adorable, but they are way smaller than they looked in the picture I should’ve looked at the measurements but they’re very small"
3.0,"Like most clothes on Amazon, it disappoints upon arrival versus model’s shape in it. It does form to the waist and hips of my body, which is 5’7” & 155 lbs and semi-muscular. It has a semi-soft feel."
3.0,I got this for my 8 year old it’s way to big on her and just in general it doesn’t even fit me.. but its very cute but can’t even wear it of how big it is
3.0,Zip broke before i even got a chance to wear it (So disappointed). Otherwise a very nice skirt!
3.0,"UPDATE: Bought 2 more colors only to find huge lack of consistency! The burgundy color is great, similar to my dark green pair, but I also bought teal and they are a disaster. I went for a run and they were literally falling off my body, i've never experienced anything like it with leggings. Reduced to 3 stars. Be aware when you order.<br /><br />Recently I went down the vast rabbit hole of trying “Lulu dupes” on Amazon. I am a leggings snob, my favorite: Lulu wunder unders in the luxtreme fabric. So to be clear, that’s my gold standard when looking at all these amazon leggings. Based on that, these are a very solid 4 stars. For the money I paid I was NOT expecting a 4 star legging. For size reference I am 5’7” size 4 in the WU at Lulu, my other new amazon favorite is CRZ and in those I take XS. This brand doesn’t sell an XS, so I went with the Small. Fits well, only a slight amount of slipping at the waist during a very high impact workout. I think if there was an XS it would’ve fixed that, but they are quite comfortable so not a big complaint. They have a giant(!) hidden pocket in the back, instead of just an ID I could literally fit my entire iPhone 12 Pro back there. This is a feature I personally love and think would be so great for walking and running outdoors. The fabric is very similar to my beloved luxtreme, with nice stretch and that almost kinda slick feel. No pet hair sticking! The length is great, 7/8 is my favorite length in leggings, hitting me right above the ankle bone. I don’t know why they call the color dark green because it’s not a dark green, more of a sage, but in person I would say it’s pretty true to what is shown online. I posted a photo before and after a 1-hr cardio kickboxing workout and was pleasantly surprised at how there was almost no sweat showing. Lastly, my husband, who never notices anything ever, asked me if these were a new purchase and complimented how they looked on."
3.0,"Very cheaply made, but for the price didn't expect any more. Broke after 1 use"
3.0,Cheap. But looks nice from a distance. Just not up close
3.0,The picture shows 3/4 quarter length sleeves but the actual product has short sleeves. The front design is very pretty but has a different design on the sleeves.
3.0,These are okay especially for the price. Cute designs but they can be a bit snug when trying to get them on and then they become a little looser in the water and tend to slip off around the heel while swimming sometimes. He wears a size 10 sneaker when we bought them he was at a 9 so we bought the eight to nine and a half size they are a little snug to get on when dry but still slip off when wet on occasion.
3.0,"It works okay, its really too big for the FitBit I am using but its the smallest size I could find.  It came on time and its a kit with posts for a watch and a tool to install so that may come in handy in the future."
3.0,This money clip concerns me because it has a very good magnet. I don't want to put anything with a magnet strip on them so I put it to the side for that reason.
3.0,Very cheesy material
3.0,"The elastic cord is not what I wanted but I didn't read the description well enough. I used the closures, but had to purchase regular cotton cord to use as a drawstring."
3.0,A bit thin for a cold winter but comfortable and have a good traction. Nice color.
3.0,"Heavier than other brands, I could not wear my glasses for longer periods with this product"
3.0,This is a nice belt but it is very wide and I am too short waisted for it to look nice on me
3.0,"I really liked this dress but I had a hard time zipping it up while on me, so I had to return it."
3.0,Not the material I thought it would be but they are nice
3.0,"I may not like how small they look on my Granddaughter, she loves these pants!"
3.0,"Bought these & when rec'd was disappointed there was no way to attach the bra comfort bands, other than easing one underneath your bra. Maybe will use in hotter weather. I normally wear a 42C, & ordered the xxl size. The bra extender pack was great for adding extra length for too tight bras!"
3.0,"I wear a Misses size 10, I ordered XXX it was still to small.  I gave it to my niece Misses size 6, the waist band on the pajama pants is really small. Beautiful fabric, well made, just not for the average American figure."
3.0,"I originally bought this bag for daytrips, but as soon as I opened the package I was highly dissapointed. The bag is a lot smaller than I was hoping for, but that’s my fault for not fully reading the description. The biggest upsetting factor was the product color, what I though I was ordering was not what I received. And a string is sticking out of the logo, which was a bit unpleasant to see as the item just got to me. Well made bag, but not what the listing showed."
3.0,Wrong type of pin
3.0,"Sooo cute but feels like it’s made for women with bigger breast ,I ordered a small and  I’m a size b and it was so baggy of the sides where your boobs go, you could see straight in there. I loved the pattern so much that I sewed it myself and made it work but yeah wouldn’t recommend other wise"
3.0,Unable to wear despite using size chart.  Good quality.  Gave it away
3.0,The necklace clamp does not close completely so angel keeps falling.  The angel itself  is very pretty.
3.0,To small it only holds 1 small pill overall I like it
3.0,"Irritating around the eyes, but we sanded it down with a Dremal tool and it worked well"
3.0,"I’ve had this for a few months and liked it a lot at first, but it has already broken. After the first month or so, I noticed the latch getting more and more loose. I do not even open and close it once the rings were on it. It was just from going in and out of my coat pocket. I ended up losing my house key."
3.0,"It came with no directions.  So, there were a few moments when I had to really think how to place a ball in the locket.  Plus, you have to check the little ball that holds the bracelet closed -- it comes loose. I lost it twice in my house.  I have been wearing it.  I like it.  But if I lose the ball on the clasp I will be throwing it away."
3.0,Not as Shiny after a couple of days. But it's still cute 😊
3.0,"It’s thin and light; great for traveling I imagine as I think it would also dry quickly if you had to wash underwear part way through.<br /><br />Feel like the size runs a little small, but not sure if it’s worth going one size up either.<br /><br />Why 3 stars? The sticker wrapper it comes packaged in. It is terrible. Part of it remains behind on the fabric after removing and it’s almost impossible to remove, even after scraping with fingernails and washing. Seller, please consider a different way to package your product."
3.0,"Argh! This romper is absolutely adorable but just a tad small! I'm only 5'4"" and they are short on me!! Not only in the length but in the the body.  So they ride up in the crotch a little.  Im keeping them and I'll have my seamstress make them into capris.  Problem solved."
3.0,"I bought a 4T, my daughter is almost 4 and these fit like a small 3T. They look like capri's on her."
3.0,"Too, too big for a size L..."
3.0,"Cute, just wish I had received the silver & pink roller skate - not the gold & pink."
3.0,"I bought small but, they were more like a men small"
3.0,Decent price. Runs slightly large. I wear xl and will  probably go with large instead. Material is a little rough. I'm sure the large is going to fit slim and slightly snug in my shoulder areas.
3.0,"I’m 5’6” and I got a medium, the dress fits well but is too short in the crotch so I’ll have to wear leggings with it."
3.0,I really like this material but the fit is not what I expected. The &#34;classic fit &#34; is more like a relaxed fit for me and the 38 inch waist fits like a 36 as someone else pointed out so I'm glad I saw that review. I will keep these but won't order a second pair. I did save $20 ordering from Amazon rather than Mountain Khaki
3.0,Cute but too small for me.
3.0,Quality is eh. Good for casual fridays.
3.0,This hat fits nicely. Has an Eagle-shaped patch that’s a little larger than the round patch in the picture.
3.0,"The hinges are the very thin kind, but if you are careful with them they might be okay.  Otherwise they seem fine, and I LOVE the reflective color of the lenses.  Sunglasses of this design have always broken the arm at the hinge for me in the past, sooner or later.  Just be careful with the hinges and arms."
3.0,"I loved the dress. I absolutely could not wait to get it on. But when I did the straps ripped right off.. it could have been better if the chest area was a bit bigger. And there was some elastic for some wiggle room. All in all the fabric felt wonderful and I had no other issues with the dress, other than the straps.. if the straps and the chest area fit better than I would not have to return it. Very disappointed!"
3.0,"I loved this shoe and was very excited to get it. However, it was way too small for my daughter. She usually wears a 9/10 and the 9/10 I recieved was way too small. I will be going through the trouble to buy the next size up and returning the small one because this is such a great value for the price. Just please buy a size up when ordering."
3.0,wife loved this wallett until zipper failed... had to tighten zipper right out of the box zipper wore out completely about 8 months of use but for the price not to shabby she may sew a new zipper on it yet she really liked the wallet lay out
3.0,The color was beautiful!! It was not a good quality around the neckline it look bad!! I wasn’t pleased!!
3.0,It's a bit small.
3.0,Very short lanyard no break away clip...
3.0,Very disappointed in the product. In the past I could buy these everywhere now I can’t find them so I ordered on line. Not nearly as good  or well made and it cost more $
3.0,The fist is ok I am a plus size woman. material thinner than anticipated based on picture.
3.0,"Fits well. Cute, accurate color. Material is thick and feels cheap."
3.0,The texture of these rocks was coarse and required several coats of paint before we could paint our mandalas. Additionally 2 of them fell apart before we could even begin to paint. If you are using these for painting then you might want to look elsewhere.
3.0,"the flowers on it are digital, not embroidered. No it looks like a bad digital copy. Also, the hook in the back doesn't stay together well. The product overall kinda sucks."
3.0,Bought these for bf. He says they ride up. So now I wear them because I'm little and they are soft lol. I wear tight fitting pants so I guess that's why they don't ride up on my legs
3.0,runs bigger than expected hoping it shrinks in wash but makes my boobs look fantastic
3.0,I love the cover.  I plan to wear with long cardigan this fall as I work from home.  The material is nice but thin and not cellulite friendly.
3.0,"Too small. Barely fits her now, DEFINITELY not going to fit her by the time she turns 2..."
3.0,This item is off white. It's supposed to be 80% cotton according to the description but it's 100% Nylon so I can't even bleach it white. Let's get the description right merchant!
3.0,No me gusto mucho salen muy grande
3.0,Tight in the weirdest places and material doesn’t reflect price. I returned it
3.0,They’re just ok not really like the picture at all
3.0,"Loved it...at first. Fit was spot on, super cute, soft fabric. I wanted to order more! One time through the wash and the fabric got all loose and wrinkly, and the lace parts are now a different color than the rest of the fabric 😞. Washed in cold water."
3.0,"The material is just ok, the butt isn't as attractive looking as I thought it would be. They are pretty meh"
3.0,"See through, but good material, comfy and soft. Fits well."
3.0,The saying on it is nice but the edges are sharp.
3.0,"Very cute blouse but it is made out of flimsy material, be careful. Definitely not made for busty girls either. I bought it a size larger that I normally would and fits. It's a lot lighter pink than in the picture, that's my only issue. IF YOU ORDER THIS, DON'T EXPECT IT TO BE THERE ANYTIME SOON!! I live in FL and It takes a very long time for it to get here."
3.0,"Quality fair, ok for play, purchased for 😄😄9 year old about 95 pounds"
3.0,Color ran immediately I waged it and looked faded.
3.0,"It is not a great finish. The enamel painting is bleeding into each other. Note that it is very long. I am 5'4&#34;, medium built. The earrings are rouching my shoulder. The model in pic must be very tall with longer than average neck."
3.0,Was a little lighter then expected an quarter sleeve ..
3.0,Material is very thin. I worry about longevity.
3.0,Same as other listings but a bit small
3.0,Rather ugly in person
3.0,"Good fit overall, the XL was kind to my postpartum belly. Flattering fit but this dress roughens after a few washes. I ended up shaving the bodice to make it wearable. Since I don't have time to handewash them, two of the three dresses are roughened. The solid red dress has held up well."
3.0,"I had a Protrek for nine our ten years that I loved, but not atomic. It needs a new battery and is scratched. The new Protrek three right side buttons are harder to use because of the protections half way around them. Plus the band is much harder to get off because of the safety ridge at the end and sticks out and gets stuck on things."
3.0,Like the design but the transfer had a flaw where it did not apply properly. Quality control should have thrown it out.  Good luck.
3.0,"Loved the bracelet, but sadly it broke after only a few wearings."
3.0,"These pants are made out of good material, with solid stitching and a quality zipper, however they run very large in the waist area. I am usually a 0-2 in jeans sizes so I ordered a small, but I would guess that these fit more like a 4-6. Overall a good buy if I can figure out how to shrink them."
3.0,Cheap material.. ripped in so many different spots of the shirt. Had to have shirt fixed.
3.0,Its ok. Didnt look like real diamonds
3.0,Red ends up being pink. So now my golf balls all have manly pink skulls on them.<br /><br />Go with blue.
3.0,Great necklace for price but arrived in a giant mess. They were all twisted together. It took almost an hour to get them untangled.
3.0,They fit for like ten minutes and then they stretch out too much and won't stay up.  I bought them to wear under another pair of pants on a cold trip and they rode down so much they drove me NUTS.  They do this on their own as well.  They're cute enough but they are a pain in the butt to keep up.
3.0,"Not bad but not great either. One pair had holes and returned.  The gloves run small, pick a size larger."
3.0,"pretty bracelet for the price, great for smaller wrists that bracelets tend to hang too loose"
3.0,"I have many Pattybotik sweaters and tops.  I love her brand and style. I am 5'7"" weigh 134 chest 37 waist 28 hips 36. This sweater did not work for me.  I have sensitive skin and once I tried it on, I couldn't get it off quick enough. Very itchy.  I ordered a medium based on reviews that patty tops run small.  but this sweater was way too big and bulky and unflattering on me. the sleeves were just way too long and looked silly.  very easy to return - amazon service is always the best.  I ordered another patty top and loved it.  I do hope that she makes some adjustments on the sleeve length since most of her tops have longer than typical sleeve lengths which has been an ongoing issue with many other reviewers."
3.0,"I ordered a medium in these and I’m normally a size 6-8, I’m 5’1” and I was worried about these because of my pear shape and bigger butt.  As far as size goes, they do fit as expected, if you’re closer to a 10 you might want to size up - because they have two zippers on the hips and it might be tight.  Giving this 3 stars because the quality is definitely a cheaper material, although very soft and stretchy, they’re really thin and I don’t see them lasting years and years.  Also, the front pockets are great, but the liner on mine shows very easily.  Also, the waistband on the back wasn’t sewn down so I need to tuck it in and be conscious of that, which is a bit annoying.  The length is great for me, but if you’re tall, listen to the other reviewers - they’ll be too short on you.  I could wear these with heels or flats without hemming them.  Great for the price though!"
3.0,The color looks exactly as pictured. The ruffles are cute BUT I don't like the Length in the back.. the front is long and the back is like half of my bottom is about to show.. I don't think it is supposed to look like that. I tried to even it out by losing the shoulder strap but it ends up falling on my shoulder a lot. I am 5'2 and wears size 2-4 depends on the cut to give you an idea how it fits me.<br />Also this doesn't come with an underwear I thought this is a set like most lingerie I get.
3.0,They worked fine for a Durango ski trip.  Requires a liner on really cold days
3.0,"Very comfortable and easy to adjust, but the underwater view is somewhat distorted. Maybe because of the curved lenses."
3.0,I love the design of the lanyard but I gave it a 3 because the Velcro is itchy. It wasn't hidden during the stitch so the hard Velcro scratches the back of my neck so I can't wear it - But it holds my keys so I'm going to keep it. If you have O.C.D. I do not recommend it. Despite the clasp the rest of the lanyard is soft.
3.0,"Difficult to use, not good instructions"
3.0,Pretty charm. The only problem is when I received it it looked like it was going to break on me. I got this product on a review site for my honest opinion
3.0,"Love this tote bag!  Great quality, and I love that it has a zipper closure.  Perfect for my cruise!<br /><br />Update:  zipper broke before getting back from the cruise.  The tote is cute, but was disappointed the zipper broke after a couple uses.  I didn't over stuff it or do anything to cause it to break."
3.0,Cut off circulation. Waste of money for me.
3.0,Seams create strange material buldges.
3.0,"Love it, however the writing is almost invisible unless looking very close."
3.0,"Siren song is pretty loud, once you figure out how it works, but watch the account you used to pay for it afterwards<br /> I was charged 8.95 twice before I caught it  for a 'membership' I didn't sign on for and saw nothing about in the ad."
3.0,"The seam on two of the three has frayed so bad that half of the edge around the sleeve is disconnected. I would not wear either in public, but I will admit they are comfortable."
3.0,The print is cute but the dress runs large. I wore it with a belt which helped.
3.0,The waist was a little too big but they are nice that can dress them up or down.
3.0,"The vest works great , that being said the battery only lasts for about an hour .<br />Very disappointed.<br />It says that the battery should last 500 charges . I have used it only 3 times. When I received the vest the zipper on the storage bag was broken , I’m wondering if this was a returned vest. Not very happy"
3.0,"I like the material of the shorts however there is zero flexibility in the shorts.  The waist has some elastic which is nice but actually hiking and moving around, crouching, etc. Is challenging and im afraid the shorts are going to tear because they don't stretch.  If they had some flexibility I would really like them but that defeats the purpose of me purchasing them."
3.0,I'm 5'3 120 lbs 32dd and this fit so small up top. I ordered a medium. I think a larger size would be too big on the bottom though. It would be cute on someone with a smaller chest
3.0,Worked well with practice
3.0,It’s so cute and good quality; however it runs super small. I got a size bigger (2xl) because I like my sweatshirts super roomy and it was still way too tight. I’m keeping it in the hopes I’ll be able to fit it one day (and I’m too lazy to go to the post office and send it back) so here’s to hoping!
3.0,"Earrings are cute but the ""moon"" part hangs backwards so you can't see the stones from the front. Maybe that's because they were packaged so poorly that they arrived all tangled together. It took me 30 minutes to untangle them. Hopefully I can bend the metal to make them hang right."
3.0,I like the slippers but the stitching on  the right slipper broke.
3.0,It was a pretty dress but did not fit that's in a flattering way. Will be returning it
3.0,I guess I should’ve looked at the measurements instead of the picture of the girl wearing it. She must be very skinny because this purse is small. It’s the same size as my fire stick remote. The coin purse I got to go with it is the same size. It’s cute just smaller than I wanted. The only reason I’m not sending it back is because it’s a gift and I don’t have to to return it and get something else.
3.0,More delicate than I thought they would be. They don't lay well against ear - looks like they are going to fall out at times. Maybe with a different backing?  I'm going to try and see.  I like them but again - not quite what I had expected.
3.0,i returned. I could barely get my toe INTO the sock.
3.0,"Nice fitting, slim case. Raised bevel all around the phone to protect it. Places for buttons are a little stiff, but still work ok. Deducted two stars because I am unable to charge my S6 on my Samsung charging pad. I was surprised, because my other case, which is heavier, two-pieced and not slimline, always charged on the pad. I will just have to charge via the plug while using this case. Overall, I like the case, despite the one hiccup."
3.0,"Great shirt.. except I would say if you’re a skinny guy, this is a little wide. Def not slim fit. Bought it for my hubby and he still looked great In it but it could’ve been more fitted for sure."
3.0,They are comfortable but run too large.
3.0,"I love this bag, however when I tighten the drawstrings (which are straps, not strings), they loosen and don't stay tight. Over all the bag is very spacious, I can fit a 15 inch laptop in there with plenty of room for more items."
3.0,"Nice earrings, but smaller than I expected."
3.0,El producto buena tela buena calidad me pareció buena relación precio valor.
3.0,Extremely stiff and hard. Would Not Purchase again.
3.0,"Weak spring, but it is a subdued color."
3.0,"Pockets hit right on the hips and it you have hips, this top accentuates them."
3.0,"I reordered this just now. The large is a medium at best and I know the sleeves will shrink in the wash. Nice product, just be sure to order it big enough to compensate for it running so small. 12/7 Update-I reordered this in a 2XL and it was only slightly larger than the L, and it still doesn't fit. Very disappointed."
3.0,"OMG, I have COPD and putting these copper fit socks on and off leaves me out of breath. It's as if I'm in a tug of war putting them on and getting out of a straight jacket taking them off. AND I  followed the directions about how to put them on. 😖😡"
3.0,Decent Kendra Scott knock off. Way too big though!
3.0,Bought for a cheap gift for my grandmother. Looks cheap nothing like the pic.
3.0,"1) Yes, the laces are too short, since I have wide feet, therefore I cannot use the top eyehole, nor use my favorite way of doing the top two eyholes that provides extra heel connection.<br />2) My feet have not smelled since I was a kid, but hey do when I take these shoes off.  I do not notice it after wearing other shoes.  Anyone else noticing this?  maybe it is something I did on my end in the first week of owning them...<br />3) other than that, great shoes."
3.0,"The hooks don't hang right, so the pie turns to the side. I pried off the original earring hook and replaced it with one that makes the pie face forward."
3.0,"This bracelet runs small. It almost looks like its for a child. The claps is hard to open as well and since this was for an elderly person, I didn't want them to fight to get it on. I was able to get another larger link bracelet and remove the beads from this one to add to the new bracelet."
3.0,"Good shape and fit.  But, like days of yore, it'd be better if there was velcro on both tabs to keep it from slipping."
3.0,Bought this for my daughter.  She loved it but the chain broke after a few days of light usage.  Without the matching necklace she doesn't use it as much.  The product works but the quality of the necklace needs to be improved.
3.0,"The compression was initially great for a long day of traveling, but after several hours my skin began to become a bit sore and itchy. When I took them off, finally, I understood why – the argyle print had been digging into my skin so much that my legs were deeply imprinted with the pattern, leaving them red and itchy. It took until the next day for the impressions to finally fade. Bad design for compression socks. The plain ones might be better, but I wouldn’t advise buying the argyle print."
3.0,"Fit great, ordered wine and the color is kinda dull compared to the picture"
3.0,It came broken so we couldn’t use it
3.0,The wallet has sustained a crack. The locker has broken off and now it is section that is holding the wallet. I am afraid if that section chips off the wallet is done. This is the type that has a currency holder at the back.
3.0,Love the colors and the feel of the sweater however it runs pretty big.
3.0,"Three stars only because I ordered the extra small, and they are still way too big!<br />I am quite tiny, 5”2 105lbs (not curvy), I figured these would be very tight and actually fit me.<br />But instead they are more like sweat pants on me...<br />The upside to these pants is the great quality, and the soft material.<br />They seem to be made to last, and made to stay comfortable. I just wish they fit :(<br /><br />I am disappointed with the sizing, but if you are much more curvy and lovely in stature than me, I recommend them!<br />If you are like me, don’t waste your money!"
3.0,"This is a very lightweight hoodie, material is not very impressive for the price charged.  The emblem is heat pressed.  The recipient was very happy with the hoodie because of the LiPeep emblems."
3.0,"The dress itself is adorable however...the front chest panel barely covers your chest and the way the dress is made m, leaves you no options for a bra. The dress does not match the picture."
3.0,It is too short.
3.0,"I have only owned my Coach purse for about two months. The inside stitching on the zipper has gotten very dirty. You can tell where it was stitched and that is the part that has gotten dirty no matter how careful I was at putting keys, ect. insid zipper incloser. Don't get me wrong tho I love my purse! It is beautiful and I get many compliments on it. It is a great pusre except for the inside stitching on zipper."
3.0,"it is small for my face, and my face isn't large. so it shifts especially when I talk; it pops up from the chin and I have to move it back in place, which isnt good."
3.0,You definitely will need to size up..
3.0,The pants were not true to size. The material has a plastic quality and is uncomfortable. When the pants stretch the fabric appears white. I ordered a size up from my standard size and the pants were still uncomfortably small.
3.0,A little too small even though i purchased a bigger size to be more comfortable while sleeping
3.0,Love this bathing suit but it was way too big
3.0,Cute top and feels soft.  Definitely size down!  I bought a medium based on the size chart and it’s huge....small would’ve been perfect
3.0,The lenses are thin.
3.0,It is cute and sort of comfortable but it stretches out of place an I have to tighten it every day. The material has started to fray at the seem where it connects to the watch face. I don't think it will last much longer
3.0,I gave them away. Poor detail.
3.0,"Ordered an XL, and it fits like a medium in the waist and a large in the chest. Quality seems fine, and another shirt i ordered from the same manufacturer in XL fits like expected.<br /><br />It is very lightweight though. Gonna try a 2XL, give it a wash, and see if I end up with a Large fit.<br /><br />Recommend 2 sizes up for this one... not sure why it's different from their other shirts."
3.0,Dress was too big. Order a size down
3.0,"These are poorly made socks. They feel rough on your feet and aren't comfortable at all. Fortunately, they look good"
3.0,The dress was very light weight and the length fell right at my knee.  The V neck fit a little weird and the dress seems to want to fall kind of sideways.  I had to keep readjusting it several times throughout the day.
3.0,The first one I purchased had a broken clasp that would not lock.  Its a nice band ... I have ordered another one and am returning the defective one.  We will see how the new one is...
3.0,Size option was one size fits all and it most defiantly did not fit an xl.  Shipping and product were as discribed but jus not size.
3.0,"These earrings are very pretty. They are the size and color I wanted. I didn't keep these earrings, however, because of they way the post is designed. I don't know how to describe the design, I can only say I couldn't get a firm grip on it to get the post into my ears, so I returned them."
3.0,Way too warm to wear inside for a covid mask. Works great outside to keep the winter chill away from face.
3.0,"I was very excited to receive this bracelet.  It looked like a very elegant alternative to the bracelets which the hair tie slip into.  Since I work in a professional setting, this seemed like an excellent option.  Unfortunately, the togs at the bottom of the bracelet are too small for my hair ties.  Since they are so close together, you have to loop a standard hair tie around twice.  I have very thick hair, so I use the Goody Ouchless ties, which are double the thickness of the ties that come with this bracelet.  In fact, I'm not sure I can get these thinner elastics anywhere locally.  I tried using the thinner elastics with my hair, but it didn't hold as I would like.  My thicker elastics would not stay on the togs on the bracelet either.  The bracelet itself is lovely, with a gorgeous rose gold colour.  The images make it seem a good bit more garish than it appears in real life.  I have enjoyed wearing this as a bracelet with several outfits and highly recommend it if you have less unruly hair than I do and can get the thinner elastics.  It just wasn't quite right for me."
3.0,It’s a bit baggy
3.0,"It's a pretty ring but if your looking for something that resembles real, this isn't it. The stone you can see all the way through. Very clear. Emeralds are much darker in color cut is not perfect. Sorry to say it does look like costume jewelry. Not what I expected."
3.0,This dress is beautiful. Unfortunately I bought a size too small and just didn't feel like reordering since the all the places on it seemed to be to big for the dress. They tend to fall everywhere instead of staying in place which makes it look like a great mess of things. Other than that the dress is gorgeous for pictures only I guess.
3.0,"As other reviewers mentioned, the separate liner is a bad idea for little kids. It will drive everyone nuts trying to poke it back into the fleece part, especially the thumb. They refunded me no problem and I'm buying plain old fleece gloves that come two pair for one price, they're not waterproof but one pair can get wet and I can carry the other pair."
3.0,"This is quite comfortable, which is nice, but it's extremely unflattering. It almost immediately became a &#34;day off dress&#34; or lounge wear."
3.0,Small but good color
3.0,"Very pretty item, but way too small!  Isn't worth the cost to return it."
3.0,"My husband loves Hudson jeans, particularly this style. I picked up this pair based on the photo - which unfortunately does not accurately depict that these jeans have paint splatters all over them. Paint? That's a new one on me. I knew they were distressed with holes, but I didn't expect and don't care for the look.<br /><br />We ended up sending the jeans back as they fit much smaller than expected. My husband already has 3 pairs in different denim colors so we know his size.<br /><br />Other than the paint splatters, the jeans were an attractive color and were the quality expected of Hudson."
3.0,"The set looks very good for the price, but I do have a few gripes. The ears seem to never want to stay in the position you want them in and continually slip from the clips and where you put them. The tail does look very cute but doesn't seem to be able to hold a position very well and the. The necklace is great and looks very nice, no complaints there. Overall for the money it's a fine set, but plan to readjust while wearing them."
3.0,I usually wear a medium i decide to order a large and it was still tight.. I'm 150lbs 5'1 I gave it a three star because its a pretty shirt and the material is so soft.
3.0,Pedi el nombre del bebe y no lo pusieron
3.0,does the job but slip off frequently
3.0,"Now, I'm 5'3&#34; and 115lbs.<br /><br />Likes:<br />The design. The foot heel covers. They are decently warm. Nice and snug, and goes up to almost my waist.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />Doesn't really LOOK like sweater tights, like I was expecting, at no fault of the company. The butt seam(s) are kind of weird... plus, tried to pull the tights over my butt one of the seams tore. I guess I can just sew it to fix it... but I expected better quality? So just be careful with these if you decide to get them."
3.0,Pretty but flimsy. Too lightweight to stay put on the wrist.
3.0,I love them but the lining came out after two swims
3.0,I did not love this sweater which I'm really bummed about. The sleeves are slightly short and it just fits a little odd. I will probably keep it and just roll the sleeves but after the reviews I was expecting much better.  I am hoping it holds up in the wash but it feels like it might shrink. We will see!
3.0,Loved this dress. I'm pretty much a solid size 10. The dress was perfect EXCEPT for the sleeves.  Way too tight.  Couldn't zip up in the back.  Super sad I had to return. Going up a size would be too big. Bummed.
3.0,"My wife really liked and enjoyed the earrings between March and about late December, but then the backing on BOTH earrings suddenly stopped closing securely. The posts can no longer screw down all the way into the second hole of the backing, so it's not secure in her ear (see image). Again, dubiously, this happened to both earrings. Product support ended four months ago. Earrings were purchased purchased 10 months ago. Unable, or unsure, how to contact the company."
3.0,"UPDATE: a few days after I posted the below, I received a check in the mail from Khombu.  Customer service hadn't indicted they were sending a check -- I'm pleasantly surprised.  I'm changing my review from 2 stars to 3 stars because of the good customer service.  I went out and bought a nicer pair of Khombu boots (with laces) that I like very much.  Note that Khombu boots tend to run a bit big.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: After being worn a few times the zipper handle broke off.  I was very gentle with the boots.  I wrote an excellent letter to Khombu including receipt and photos.  Never heard back.  I later submitted an electronic support request on their website.  They wrote back but were unwilling to replace the boots.  Two other comments: these boots are too wide at the top, and they would not stay zipped -- a better design would be a clasp to keep them zipped."
3.0,The huggies fell looser on my main earring hole than I wanted (looked more like tiny hoops than huggies). These would be very cute on a cartilage piercing though!
3.0,Runs large. I ordered a medium but it fits like a large! Go a size down when ordering
3.0,There material is too thin
3.0,This is not a sweater. The material is not absorbent and isn’t as the pic suggests. It is however cute and fits well. This is not an off the shoulder “sweater” but a boat neck cut. It’s not want I expected but it’s a keeper.
3.0,It came like the picture. Note it sheds A lot!!! True to size.
3.0,"About 2.5"" of this is just the waistband, so the skirt is shorter than I was expecting, the actual skirt is about 12.5"" long. You can see the shorts if you bend over."
3.0,Received the bracelet yesterday and was pretty excited because I had received items from this seller before and it has always been quality items.  However this time I am a little disappointed.  The bracelet itself is pretty and the clasp is very well made.  I am just disappointed in the color of the emerald's.  The color is not a deep green but more of a peridot green.  I will probably still buy from this seller again but just stick with the sterling silver jewelry.
3.0,Made more for a child.  Too small
3.0,have had these for this winter and they are breaking down already.  I only wear in the house and in the evening.. not sure they were worth the price
3.0,I like the company and coat but the hood is way to big if you just want to use jack with out a helmet. i need a jacket that takes care of me all around. this one just did not work for the money and value
3.0,The band is very plastic-ey feeling. I dont think it will last as long as the leather band. Really cute though.
3.0,"Too big on top and somewhat small on the bottom. I do not have oversized hips, either."
3.0,Cute but poorly made they don't stand up for wearing in a physical therapy use and ribbing on bottom although alot slips around to the sides and top of the foot
3.0,"Returning because even though it is very beautiful, it constantly flips over to wrong side"
3.0,broke.... when I pulled it tight.... delicate... look ok... so kept it...
3.0,"Buy a size up.  Otherwise it will fit like a glove.  Not much breathing room especially on hot, hot days.  It's beautiful though."
3.0,These are super nice. The colors are amazing and quality. However I’m not sure if they are all supposed to have the words “mamba” crooked? I bought two to check it out and both came that way. Plus both do not have the words “black mamba” on the backside
3.0,Not a lot of quality but nice look
3.0,Broke pretty quickly
3.0,Nice looking and well made.  The leather has a soft yet durable feel and the stitching looks good.  Once loaded up with all my cards and stuff it's a bit thicker than my last wallet but it's tolerable.  If your giving this wallet as a gift it comes in a nice looking burlap bag.<br />  Why the 3 star rating?  I question weather it really is an RFID blocking wallet.  It failed my test.  I have a plastic card with an RFID chip inside of it to access a parking lot where I work.  All you have to do is wave this RFID card a few inches in front of the reader for the gate arm to go up and allow a car to drive into the lot.  I put this RFID card in one of the credit card slots in the otherwise empty wallet.  I waved the wallet a few inches in front of the reader and it picked up the cards RFID signal from inside the wallet no problem and the gate arm went up for me like it always does.  Not cool.  I'll keep it because it is a nice looking wallet but I don't have much confidence in it's RFID blocking ability.
3.0,Not for side sleepers! Also lets in light when I'm sleeping on my back. Not for me...
3.0,Thin lightweight material - nice for summer. Too wide though. For reference my hips are 34” and this dress had about an extra two inches on each side. Will be returning. Other than that it’s super cute.
3.0,"I wear a size 8 normally and have 34DDD boobs. I ordered a large and it was deff too big. I also wasn't a fan of how the sleeves 'ruffled'. The material below the armpit ruffled out a lot, making the inside seams are very noticeable, which to me makes it look cheap. (This is not depicted in the advertising photos)"
3.0,"The clasp makes the chain unusable unfortunately, it is too difficult to easily take on/off."
3.0,It’s probably great for most.  I thought it had a place to insert a filter. It does not. Other than that it’s very cute
3.0,"Bought it because of the great price. It's not that bright as I thought it would be but the price was right, I have two other solar stationary lights on each end of my roofline with this in the middle so that compensates the brightness. Recommend something in the range of 600 lumens for a better motion security spotlight. It will cost more but you get what you pay for."
3.0,"I ordered black, but received a blue handbag.  It's pretty, but I still want the black to wear as my dressy handbag."
3.0,My daughter likes these but they are very poor quality
3.0,"Front kind of small, doesn't offer very much support. Not practical to workout or yoga in but very cute for certain outfits. The back clasp is like a bathing suit but seems to hold ok."
3.0,Looks like photo. Not flattering on me though. Material is ok. Nothing exceptional and nothing terrible. Forgetable dress.
3.0,"It's Asian sizes so I got xl and it just fits I'm 5,4 135 pounds I altered the back took out zipper to show off tattoo"
3.0,"I got a 3X, it fit exactly like I'd expect a 2X. The pleats didn't sit nicely because of it. Also, it was really difficult to get the wrinkles out of the top with ironing - perhaps it was just the hotel iron but those were some stubborn wrinkles. Spritzing with water and letting it hang (my preferred method) didn't work either.<br /><br />Other than that, I like the fabric, the style, etc. The weight of it is best for a winter dress."
3.0,but it ran small
3.0,"Fits perfect for my big head, not pressing into the sides of  my scull. Not heavy on my nose so I do not have to always push them back to the top of my nose. The lens were delivered with a flaw in the left one which I cannot get out. The quality of the lenses could be a lot  better. I would like to replace the lenses and not the frames."
3.0,Size up 2 sizes At least. Also not typical sweatshirt material isn’t very comfy. No stretch.
3.0,"I wanted to wear it and bought the largest size available, but it was way too small to be considered a 2x/3x. I did gift it to a tall friend who wears a med/large, and it fit him just great, he loves it. Not mad though, because it was a good price."
3.0,Good quality. Bought it for a kid. It was too large.
3.0,"It didn't fit terrible it was just a little short. I had seen other people reviewing it was short, but I figured since I was only 5'2&#34; it wouldn't matter for me. I was wrong it was just to short even for me. Overall it was cute and it was actually lined in the back which I'm finding slot of them aren't for some reason. I'm 180 lbs and wear a 38c. I considered keeping this, but I think it might start hurting my neck after a while because of having to tie it so tight due to it being on the shorter side. Also the chest area was slightly big as I am bottom heavy."
3.0,Runs small and not stretchy as I expected. Kind of stiff feeling!
3.0,"Pant are cut for large, but top is x-large"
3.0,"It’s definitely a lot larger than I thought and the bodice is long and goes lower than my natural waist. It will take some adjusting, but it will work as a decent dupe of the dress it’s inspired by."
3.0,Good quality nice looking just too big
3.0,"I live the look of these, but the clip part for the upper ear was too tight, but the end of the night they hit like hell. I took them off at the party and gave them to my daughter"
3.0,My vajayjay hangs out when I wear this robe. Too short.
3.0,"They are fine except too tight.  AFter 20 minutes of wear, they begin to bother me.  I cannot seem to &#34;stretch&#34; them either."
3.0,Thought they were goi to be much bigger than they actually are.
3.0,"However I failed to see these watch faces are very small. 20mm equates to aboout3/4 "" which is hard to read. None looked like in the photo. I have many bands and need a watch face to save on switching them out so often. They are nice for children, small wrist, but as the eyes go with age this is not what I wanted. I chose the wrong vendor for my personal needs."
3.0,Looks nice in the picture but I was expecting better quality.
3.0,I am 5’10 an 170lbs I normally wear a Med in yoga pants but I ordered a large in these ones and I’m glad I did they fit perfectly and I really liked them I just wish they were a better material. The day I got them I wore them on a hike and came back with two holes in them I’d say they are good for lounging around the house not physical activity.
3.0,I wear a medium and these were very hard to tug on to my hands because of the lack of stretch. You would think The North Face would have tested these for fit.  I would return them but I've worn them thinking they would wear in a little and stretch.  Nope.  Don't buy these.
3.0,"The wings are cute and nice. The bar was a little long for me, but I didn't read the details. The heart one was cute BUT it was VERY difficult to clean. Honestly, my nips didn't get much air either and I jewelry almost made it so it was like deteriorating.. When the wings were in, they were fine. I have changed jewelry again and they went back to normal... but when the heart ones are in... my nips were not liking that. Plus it was pretty difficult to get it. Also the hears sort of twisted a bit and didn't stay as level as the wings. Everyone has a different body but the heart rings didn't work for me."
3.0,"tiny, tiny, tiny. order WAAAYYYYY bigger than you think you'll need"
3.0,"About half of them worked. For the half that did, they are so fun and very bright! We handed these out on halloween with glow sticks, various light or glow items so kids can be seen a little easier in the dark. The kids loved these, which makes it more frustrating that so many wouldnt work."
3.0,Love the pendant color is beautiful...but chain too small for me it is a 18&quot; and i am 20-22 inches.
3.0,The sleeves were too short and the fabric was not at all what I was expecting. It’s a silky like sheen on what looks more like a sweatshirt. The colors were more pastel in person
3.0,"Pretty, but quality of the picture on earrings a little low. Also much much smaller than expected."
3.0,Nice looking but its thick and heavy!
3.0,are ok for one night
3.0,I’m normally A size 6 & 1/2 -7 so after reading the reviews I decided I should order A size small. Well they are huge. I’m going to keep them but I wish they were smaller.
3.0,The darkness of the shades is awesome.<br />It’s easy to put on and take off.<br />However…the small clip at the top of the sunshade bothered my visual field. I couldn’t get use to seeing it and since I wasn’t always wearing it…I decided to return it.<br />The product works but bothered me having to have the clip in my visual field.
3.0,"The waist size is spot on.  The reason for the 3 is due to putting on the trimmer/taking it off.  I have an athletic build and had trouble by passing my legs.  As I force the trimmer over my thighs, I kept hearing the frabic stretching.  The other issue is going to the bathroom...very hard to take off."
3.0,I liked the idea of getting so many bracelets. Unfortunately some of the bracelets are coming apart because they are sewed together. I am very disappointed.
3.0,Very slim fit in the legs. Not a larger fit like norma NYDJ. Could have ordered a size up. Hoping they stretch as I wear.
3.0,Are always coming out but good other than that
3.0,Super cute and perfect for my 10 year old only thing that I wasn’t so sure about it the bottoms are very thin and you can see the outline of stuff that shouldn’t be seen in front
3.0,I love the glasses however the turquoise color disappeared
3.0,"I like the material and the braided straps and detail... but it is WAY too small!!!<br /><br />I am 5'5&#34;, athletic 125#. I wear a size 0/1 jean so 25/26' waist. My bust is 34c. The medium is too small on both the top and bottom. The top fits more like a sports bra where it kinds squishes your boobs to your chest.<br /><br />I might be able to fit into a large, but they don't offer other sizes, at least that I can find."
3.0,I can't seem to get the elastic adjusted correctly around my ears. Have them as loose as possible and they still come off. I think they need to be a bit bigger both in length & width.
3.0,hubs says it's falling apart already. seams are getting loose
3.0,"Could have more material for better wrap around, so it doesn't open while walking.  And inner sash came off very quickly due to poor quality of production process."
3.0,They seem of a good quality and looks like could be comfortable if the sizing matched descriptions.
3.0,"I did a lot of research before I bought this item, most reviews stated that the suit fits well but you will need a little help pulling it up over the shoulders. I purposefully bought a size smaller than what I needed since the cosplay I was doing needed it to be tight. The suit is stretchy and I felt it would have been a little too loose to have the same sex appeal If I had bought the large. (which is what my measurements recommended.) So if you are buying true to size I would consider it a little small due to it being really difficult to get both of your shoulders in without help from a friend.<br /><br />Over all I rated this item 3 stars because the quality is good, not bad and not wonderful. And again if you are buying true to size its a little short in the shoulders. I was a size large but wanted something more form fitting and the medium is exactly what I wanted."
3.0,Great size and good quality outter materials. However 2 inside zippers broke two weeks after started using it!
3.0,Bracelet is beautiful except doesn’t stay tight keeps on inching loose.
3.0,"Pretty thick, need the big belt loops or it’s a struggle, why mine is in the bag still. Not doing that every morning. I went with Arcadia."
3.0,Like the shirt but its too small even though I ordered my size.
3.0,This necklace is flemsy.<br />It looks alright if youre needing something of the sort but I wore it for what I needed and probably wont wear it again.<br />I would not give something like this as a gift because it wont hold up well and is not well made.<br />The arrow is sturdy but the chain is not.
3.0,cute but some come with two beads attached together and the hook is so hard to attach cause it’s tiny. overall cute but not very practical.
3.0,It is not breathable; it is not light.  This fabric (which starts to droop) is not for warm weather.
3.0,"The fabric is not denim - it is some kind of synthetic blend. Otherwise, it looks like picture, but the quality is not the best - the shirt is too thin, I will probably return it."
3.0,After dropping them only a couple times in the shower they cracked and shattered
3.0,It’s a bit heavy. Doesn’t seem to comfortable although my 4yr old doesn’t complain
3.0,This is a great insole if you are just wearing the shoes every now and again. I wear my docs for 8 hours at work and I stand the whole time so I get blisters on the  bottom of my feet from the lines in the insole. it would be perfect if they were solid
3.0,The sleeves are not long enough buy a size up .. not good that you can’t choose your own colors all the colors are still mixed with the colors that you already had or would buy !! Will choose another seller for these reasons way too expensive!!
3.0,Product is gorgeous. I got these for my bridesmaids. Only reason I rated three stars is because one of them broke as soon as it was opened.
3.0,The shirt was a little too big for me. But it was okay since I just gave birth. I suggest get a size down.
3.0,The thickness to this set was nice. A few sets that I have ordered were paper thin so thickness was great. But the pants to this were too short
3.0,"I have a bright blue tank top that looks exactly like these that I've been wearing for years.  It's my favorite shirt to put under stuff and of course, I cut out the tag when I bought it.  After deciding to go on the hunt to find some more neutral colors, I stumbled upon these.  They look the same, but they're just kind of... meh.  The gray fit great, the white is just ok, and the black lace band on the bottom is so tight, it cuts into my hips.  They're all the same size, so I'm not sure what gives.  Two of the three have crooked seams down the side too.  I'd really love them if they all fit like the gray, so I'm undecided.  I'd try again but Amazon returns are getting a little more difficult."
3.0,Cut us off. I purchased a couple of these when they first came out and I love them. This one is just a little odd. I will still wear it but slightly dissatisfied.
3.0,My daughter only wear it once and there were holes on it.
3.0,The bottoms fit perfect but the top was too short in the arms. That was new to me normally the bottoms are too small and the top fits.
3.0,Great canvas bag-zipper though not sewn all the way.
3.0,"I got these as a gift for my 10 year old and they were way too small on him.  He's a kid, so I thought they'd be OK, but buyer beware that they are for little kids, not older kids. I would say they wouldn't even fit an average sized 6 or 7 year old. So bummed b/c they were really cute and came with a cool case."
3.0,The part where the bands connect feel like they are going to break and not easy to get on and off of the watch.
3.0,product was nice but i got a xtra small because im only 5'2 145 lbs......shirt is cute but the pants were really long...i do have short legs....and the crotch area hung low....if you have long legs it would be a great purchase...just didnt fit my body right
3.0,"I’m not a big polyester fan, but I’m looking for some low and no-wrinkle clothes for traveling so I thought I’d give this a try.<br /><br />The fabric is a thicker polyester. To me, it feels a bit cheap, but I think that’s just my preference for the texture of natural fibers. It has plenty of stretch and is easy to put on. Even though there’s a side zipper I didn’t need to use it, I could just pull the dress over my head.<br /><br />And I’ll give the dress credit - I’ve rolled it up into a ball, shoved it in the corner of my luggage, and there’s nary a wrinkle to be seen.<br /><br />The dress is cute in photos, and on the right body type it would be perfect. Unfortunately, that body type is second trimester pregnant. I thought the pleats would have a slimming effect. I’m about a year postpartum with a bit of a belly left, and this dress clings in such a way that highlights every bit of that curve. If I wanted to make people think I was pregnant again, or I was actually pregnant, it would look so adorable. But instead I just feel fat.<br /><br />I did follow the recommendations of the size chart based on my measurements; perhaps if I sized up one more I would have experienced the intended flattering effect."
3.0,Is okay it doesn't really look like the picture do. the style is to thick
3.0,Great quality but ran large
3.0,Material is pretty thin....other than that it's a cute shirt.
3.0,"I hate to give this cute little guy a bad review, but I have to extremely honest! I loved it the first week I had it. I carried a few credit cards, a few bills, and some change in it. It held quite a bit for its size. Things were going smoothly, then out of nowhere, my porg betrayed me. The legs on it started to break apart. They tore where they connect to the porg. So now my poor porg sits in my closet, as I don’t want the legs to completely come off. So, I feel as though I wasted my money on something I would typically use everyday. I’d Love to recommend it, but mine didn’t last more than a week."
3.0,Material is not really breathable...but it’s cute and color is as pictured
3.0,"I bought two nightgowns from this same company.  Both are lovely patterns and expertly sewn. However, both are made of material so thin, it is like tissue paper.  I like light summer gowns, but this is so light it is flimsy.  Would not purchase again."
3.0,I'm fairly sweaty when working out so this may just be me but they seem to work well for 15 minutes and then they are not helpful in stopping sweat. I've been taking two to the gym and switching out but likely need to get something thicker
3.0,"When I tried this dress on, I was swimming in it. I’m a shorter girl (5’2”), but this dress came down to the middle of my calves. Also, the waist felt way loose; as if someone had tried it on, taken it off and stretched it out as they were taking it off. It’s in the mail for return, sad because it’s such a cute dress!"
3.0,"Not bad, but it does look cheaper once you have it in your ears. Also, since it's acrylic, you can't wear them too long as they attract more bacterias and you risk ,ore infections. But for an evening at a party; they will do just fine.<br />However, this product is not the picture you see, it is the SPIRAL version, not shown in the picture..."
3.0,"It’s nice , just not the right fit for me!"
3.0,"Very cute shoes, but were a bit too big for my daughter."
3.0,This top is really comfortable and seems well made. The only thing I didn’t like about it was how it scrunched at the waist a little bit. I added  another set of holes to the lacing at the waist to cinch it in a little better and that completely fixed the issue.
3.0,"Nice dress, runs small.  Would like to order larger size, however not available."
3.0,It's nice has long arms and a longer torso too. Disappointed in color it's more of a navy blue not black.
3.0,"It's a little tight on me - I bought XL, am 5&#34;7 and 160lbs. Otherwise the design is chic and this tunic/dress is cool for the Summer."
3.0,"Too small, order up."
3.0,I have the black metal bracelet on my Nokia Steel and I have to say it looks very nice. The band feels substantial and secures to the watch well. The reason I only gave it three stars is because there is no fine adjustment on the clasp. It is nice that it comes with a little tool to help you take links out and put them back in but the band ended up being either too tight or too loose on my wrist. The links are small enough that this will probably be fine enough adjustment for a lot of people but for me it just wouldn't fit correctly.
3.0,Too tight on waist
3.0,I really liked this product it just fit small for an XL size&#34;  but other than that everything else was fine
3.0,"This dress was somewhat larger than expected, also looked “costume” like on more than I would have liked to. Returned"
3.0,"Women should definitely size down on this. The scrub on top is a women's Koi Ashley in large. The one beneath is the Dog Is Good in large (which is adorable and seems to be well made). The description says ""fitted so size up if you're unsure"". DON'T size up if you're ordering for a female!"
3.0,"I felt like I searched through just abou all of Amazon to find the version of this suit that I wanted at a reasonable price.<br />The sizing is a little off but, I also have dis proportional hips and derrière to my body frame.  Still wearable, just like others have said, the bottom of the tank cinches in a bit, and is a smidge tighter than I'd prefer, but doesn't look bad.<br />The color is exactly what I was expecting.<br />The reason this gets three stars is I did not recieve the version of this product that was shown in the photo.<br />It may seem like a small difference to many but I was specifically seeking the version in the picture which has crossed straps on the back.  Picture provided."
3.0,great back design and comfortable but bust is a little small and straps are not adjustable (a little too long)
3.0,"This is very pretty, but it was just too sparkly for me and the earrings are kind of heavy.  I returned this set."
3.0,Heavy but I still like it
3.0,"Images does not do this thing justice, looks very cheap and doesn't look like the item as seen in the photos."
3.0,Was sewn off kilter so hard to tell it was a turkey. Whatevs. It was $9.
3.0,I was hoping it would be smaller through the chest and bigger in the hips than it was. A but boxy but that’s the norm. It’s a fine well made shirt.
3.0,should've returned it . but i made it work
3.0,"Cute style dress, but too short for my taste - I am 6'. Could be worn as a beach cover up, but not what I was looking for."
3.0,Very cute shirt but not very flattering if you have any kind of stomach that isn't perfect.
3.0,I love the design of this shirt but it doesn't fit me well because I have a curvy figure. It is more suited for someone with a slim torso. Bummer.
3.0,"It is ok, but it started falling apart after a couple of days and sheds really bad. When I wear it I get a bunch of fibers in my mouth from it. I Left it on the couch as a decorative blanket but it still sheds and the threads are still coming out."
3.0,Dress is made of a stretchy jersey like material. It makes the top half rather shapeless and floppy. It could really use some structure to look truely good and keep your chest from falling out.
3.0,Very thin - see through. Ripped after 1st cold wash. Rolls up. No way I would wear out alone or at gym. Sleep wear only. Colors were nice and vibrant.
3.0,"Nice product, a little disappointed i got doubles of 12g and 14g, didn't receive 10g or 8g, and they are a little longer than expected, other than that they are ok."
3.0,"In reading the reviews, I purchased a Medium. WRONG, size for me. While I loved this dress, I had to return it. The material was extremely thin and  the Medium was a bit snug. I didn't want the potato sack look and after reading the reviews I thought the Medium would be best. NOT--- I am 5'2, 185-194lbs and 40G chest. I may reorder because I love the style of this dress, it's just the material was too thin and I don't want to look like a sack."
3.0,These are super cute but they were wayyyy to big for my 7 year old. I ordered her usual size (size 11) but they were way to big. Gave them to my niece who wears a 12-13 and they fit nice on her.
3.0,"Loved it, but one side broke too fast- not for everyday wear, which is a shame because it looks awesome...I might give it a second chance"
3.0,"I bought this after the stock band broke on my charge 4.  It is nice quality, and fit well on to the unit.<br /><br />But I had a hard time getting it to fit well.  If I got it tight enough for the sleep tracking to work, I'd wake up with a sore wrist and a deep red trench where the band was.  If I loosened it so my wrist wouldn't hurt, I'd wake up through the night whenever it would slip around into an awkward angle.  I'm a big guy, so when I needed to take it off, I had to actually decouple on of the ends, because there wasn't enough slack in the band to let me slip it off my wrist.<br /><br />I liked the style and the construction of this band, it just wasn't what I needed from a band."
3.0,I haven't worn them yet but when I tried them on they seemed really loose
3.0,"Wooden box was not included.<br />Base on the reviews, unique look, and presentation I quickly purchased this as a gift for my husband for Father's Day. He is an armature woodworker and loves bow ties.<br />I was disappointed that it came in a plastic bag with no wooden box as advertised. What a dispointment! I was hoping for a nice presentation with the wooden box to display the morning of.<br />I thought this company would have thought better."
3.0,Its cute but a little uncomfortable when you workout since it rolls up when Im moving.
3.0,I usually wear a woman's medium but with I ordered a large since most reviews said order one size larger.  I would recommend getting 2 sizes up.  This doesn't fit me.  It was made well and the material is what I expected but the sizing is way off.
3.0,"Came yesterday through USPS... Around 25, out of the 40 worked, which for the price is not a bad deal.... But it could have been better"
3.0,"They looked very nice and felt comfortable on my legs, but they were very high on my waist and VERY tight around my waist. For reference I am 5'3 and 138lbs and I bought a size medium."
3.0,"I am a ladies 9.5 - 10, they are a bit small without having been washed... fingers crossed no shrinking"
3.0,"I thought this would be slightly more loose fitting, however it still fits nicely. I'm meh about the material."
3.0,Had to send back. the boning bows and the bottom rolls up.
3.0,I was worth the price
3.0,This was supposed to be a sweatshirt and it was just a shirt.
3.0,"i ordered a small but they sent a medium. the tie is very long, wraps around me three times! I don't feel like doing an exchange, those are getting tedious. I will wear it as it fits okay. those who claim cleavage show - are 100% correct. I think I'll safety pin it"
3.0,It looked good when i received it however within a week the color changed . I had to return it.
3.0,Small but good enough for what i paid for them
3.0,Wallet looks very much like the picture although it's hard to detect the faux alligator texture. The only downside to this wallet is that it had a very strong chemical smell when I first got it. It was too smelly to use for about four days (aired it out in the sun). It doesn't smell at all now though -- and it has a ton of space and pockets for all my stuff. I don't have it packed with cards/bills so it even has space to hold my phone.
3.0,Much larger than expected with a cheaper type of fabric !
3.0,The lenses are good so far.  They are a little thinner than the originals.  Biggest problem was the screwdriver included  didn't fit the screw.  Found one to fit and changed out easily.
3.0,Made well.  Very small. Would not fit
3.0,The dress is huge. The cuffs are super huge and wide. I didn't like it at all. It did not look very elegant. I looked like an old lady because it hung on me like drapery.
3.0,"Really pretty, but made my belly button irritated, red, and crusty, and it's been healed for 2 years so that wasn't it! just make sure you aren't sensitive to metals!"
3.0,"The picture that caused me to order the shirt was much brighter than the actual shirt I received. I'm used to buying women sizing and the fit being more unisex is longer, both sleeve and body and seems tighter around than I expected. It is unique and I got a lot of fun comments from friends and relatives. Lastly, the cost was a bit high when all shipping, taxes, etc were added.<br /><br />Rose"
3.0,"Much too small for my dr strange costume, could work as a regular necklace or key chain.  Should have read the description more closely. I returned it and bought one that was sized more like the movie."
3.0,These are cute but too light and too much glare.
3.0,"These pants go so huge!<br />I ordered size S, but they're like M.<br />And they have lining, not for summer. I would say, they are great for warm fall or spring."
3.0,A good slipper for indoor and out door use. Just runs a bit big in the heel.
3.0,I really like these glasses but they are a bit too big on my face. But the bifocal portion is perfect.
3.0,Stone color is pretty but the pendent is alot larger than expected and thinner. I'm a small person and this necklace is way too big. I am going to give it to my mom so it isn't a total waste. Hoping that it isn't too big for her either. Also after examining it a little closer the diamond accent is only one diamond surrounded by Stirling silver shaped diamond studs. But can't tell unless it is examined closely.
3.0,Wish I was warned it stretches a lot would have bought size smaller
3.0,"The straps don't adjust and are really long. Show the chest. Fixable by tying the back, but she says having it tied is uncomfortable."
3.0,Good for one time. Not thick enough to withstand multiple uses
3.0,Seems cheaply made but cute.
3.0,I just don't like how this particular skirt fits.
3.0,"The dress was great, quality good, style did not flatter my figure, otherwise, I loved the dress. Timely delivery.<br />Had to return product, company a little slow and difficult on returns."
3.0,Buy if you have thin arms. I had to return.
3.0,Was too short. Expected to wear as a dress but now must wear as a tunic
3.0,I purchased these to make monster face donuts for kids. They would be too small I think for any child bigger than a toddler to wear but great for decorations
3.0,It was enormous.  I returned it.
3.0,Generous fit. The only complaint I have is the button holes become loose after first wear. They wont stay in the holes. I’ll have to sew them smaller.
3.0,Love the design but does run small material is not what I was expecting pure cotton look
3.0,The color is good and It fits good but the material is much thinner than I had expected.
3.0,My only issue with is that they tarnish super fast
3.0,"My daughter is in a 10 and a half, I bought an 11 and they were way too small. Also one strap is longer than the other. Really disappointing, especially since the shoes are really cute! Have to return them."
3.0,"Very big, do not like the texture of ball."
3.0,I got this for a friend bit small more size options would be great. My big problem Is each glove fits a differant hand size ine fits almost on his hand the other barely fits any of his hand. The overall design is great but would be nice if each one fits the same sized hand at least.
3.0,If u have lg womens hands the will only come to bottom of 2nd knuckle
3.0,Fabric and fit are great but the printed anchor in front is lopsided.
3.0,Material and style is very nice but sizing is way off.  I normally take an XL but I was looking for a much looser fit for general lounging purposes and ordered a 3X;  it barely fit.
3.0,"They worked... a bit.<br /><br />These were a gift from my Daughter.  She researched colorblindness, and the products available, and decided that these would be good to try.  It's one of the most thoughtful gifts I've ever received - and it's not a small present for anyone on her budget (or mine).<br /><br />I took an online color test without the glasses, and it confirmed my previously known red/green problems.  I took it again with the glasses, and I believe that I had problems with roughly the same number of patterns, but different ones than before.  After the retake, the test was unable to determine what type of perception I had.<br /><br />I believe they'd be likely to work for some people, and not at all for others.  I'm really glad that I got a chance to try them.<br /><br />Regardless, everyone should be aware that they do darken your view, and thus reduce contrast across your entire field of view.  They might help a color-blind person distinguish some things that otherwise blend together, but I find it difficult to imagine that the world would ever look &#34;prettier&#34; or &#34;more colorful&#34; through these."
3.0,It’s delicate but a very pretty ring. It is thin and bends out of shape easily so you do have to be careful.
3.0,"It's very good looking and very soft, but after you put it on, the fabric relaxes and start to slide down.  I think it needs ear loops or something to keep it up.  I bought some elastic so I'll be adding that to the face mask, and I'll use it on top of a surgical mask (so I don't have to throw it away right away)."
3.0,The color shown and the color received are very different tones of blue.  Would not have ordered the color I received. The fit was acceptable.
3.0,"It is cute and my daughter loves it, but I do not feel like it will last long. It is a bit short in the torso, but juuuuuust fits. If it shrinks or if she grows even a little bit, it will not fit. But like I said, she loves it and it is cute."
3.0,Smaller than it appeared
3.0,Loved the purse but didn’t come with handle.
3.0,Ok will get the job done but won’t last long
3.0,The size I got was too big for my small somewhat short height.
3.0,It a nice looking watch but it feels cheap on the weight.
3.0,"I've ordered SHEIN clothing several times before, through Amazon and their actual website and it's always a hit or miss for me in quality and their sizing. Things tend to run large in this brand or boxy fitting.<br />This one was a miss for me even though it had three 5 star reviews when I bought it. But no comments so I wanted to post a review. Firstly sizing is pretty on point. I ordered an XSmall, I'm 5'3"" and 110 lbs for reference. But that's where the positive stops. It's made from a weird thin rough type of textured material that is double layered only at the collar part. This area doesn't lay flat because of uneven sewing. Also kind of wrinkly, I had to steam it. There are awful bulky shoulder pads sewn in but if you have a seam ripper you CAN cut them out like I did. It is also unlined and very very thin. Not worth $30 in my opinion but I'm keeping it anyway. I have gotten better cheap blazers at Forever 21. I would say unless the price goes down to like $15 I would suggest to keep shopping for a better quality jacket. Hope this helps!"
3.0,They are a little too chunky and think to work with heels.
3.0,"Thin 100% cotton, shorter and smaller than expected 🙁"
3.0,Flimsy clip. Large sizing
3.0,I ordered this in a large for my neice who is 9. All the other clothes i buy her that are large fit fine. This is WAY too small. i honestly dont know if a 6 year old would fit it. Looked so cute online.  I'm giving 3 stars because I am able to return it for free.
3.0,These are just ok. They fit funny in the sense of the when buttoned they were a bit too tight but the rest was a bit loose. It could also be my shape?? Very thin material.. not completely Jean material if that makes sense. Stretchy but not at waist. I gave them to my daughter who is a bit smaller then me and they don’t fit her right either.
3.0,"If this wasn’t see through I would have kept it. It’s very cute, the color was as pictured and was true to size for me. The draw string is decorative and does nothing. I could see that the button in the back would be a pain when using the bathroom. If you’re going to lounge around or wear it at the beach it’s fine, otherwise you can see through it."
3.0,Very thin and doesn't fit well over the head
3.0,I very good watch band but much too short
3.0,I didn’t really get to wear these since my nose was aching by the time I got either of them to close. They are suuuuupeeerrrr small so I definitely wouldn’t recommend these for anyone who doesn’t have a small nose. Still very very pretty though.
3.0,"These aren't meant to constrict like normal Spanx. They are a lightweight, breathable fabric that is really comfortable. I actually really love them, but I am giving it 3 stars because mine already have a hole in them after about a month of use. I wear them under dresses in the summer as a moisture-wicking layer to deal with the heat and humidity. They work perfectly for that."
3.0,"Quality is great, style is great but my little petite size Xs self drowned in it so had to return which was a very easy process. Thank u! Wished it came in a smaller size."
3.0,Took a long time to arrive.  Not what I expected.
3.0,Beautiful dress but ran way too small.
3.0,"I expected a variety of 12colors. I got 3 of four colors each. I got no red ones, which was what I most desired. 🙁"
3.0,Very pretty but very tight. If you have a lower piercing it will be perfect. The clicker is easy to open and close. But with it being so tight I worry about it popping open
3.0,"Cute, but runs small. I am a Med/LG and ordered an Extra Large and it's still tight."
3.0,I font have a huge head but getting this over my head sucked after I washed it!
3.0,"It’s cute and fashionable, but a little short if you have any hint of booty. The pleats were a little wonky, but other than that, cute!"
3.0,It looks nice but didn't fit. I did several measurements and used the size chart but the ring I ordered ended up being way too big. I am going to order a smaller one.
3.0,It arrival late but I still feel great to received it
3.0,Ran small for me
3.0,The clips to attach the earring to the ear was very difficult to fit on the post.  They would not go all the way to the end of the post.  Check
3.0,"I notice there are no reviews for this dress.  I do love the dress but have to send it back.  It is not because of the dress but because of my body shape.  I am 5'3 140 lbs. I carry my weight on my bottom half and my upper body is smaller.  I also have larger arms.  With that said, I ordered a large and I think a medium would have been better.  The elastic in the arms was tight on me, but if you have small arms, that won't be an issue.  Also, the pockets were so low because of my height.  The upper part of the dress was way too big.  Hope this helps anyone interested."
3.0,"It's great to have all size of spring bars. The bar quality is consistent with the price, not great, but they work. The box is very cheap, no lock on it. Also, the box is wrapped with many tapes (it might be the only way to make sure it arrives as one piece). The tapes are hard to be removed, and after removing all the tapes the box is sticky everywhere, very annoying."
3.0,They’re cute but not practical for high intensity. They slide down allllll the time. Super annoying.
3.0,Sent them back too small
3.0,Not flattering on my figure (curvy and short) and cheap fabric that will snag easily. May look better with a cute wide waist belt or something like that.
3.0,These are great for kids unless they have a bigger shoe size . These keep Falling off of the crocs that have the bigger holes (larger size shoes)
3.0,"It's cute, but looks very faded and so small, like for an infant!"
3.0,"I remember when you could get these anywhere and now there hard to come by. Doesnt always work, you have to tap it, but will do in a jam as long as it works."
3.0,"I like the overall jumper, but did not know how reveiling it was. Will have to wear a bodysuit underneath it."
3.0,"I really like the look of this bag however the feel of the material is almost plastic/rubber like on the straps and it is kind of stiff and awkward to open. I was very excited for this bag to be delivered but honestly I haven't used it yet as it seems like it will be a hassle to get in and out of due to the stiffness. On the upside, I only paid a fourth of the $101.00 original price. I would be sending it back for sure otherwise. The style is great but I wish it was a better quality bag."
3.0,I’m 5’8” and these are too short for me. I bought a medium. The body fit well
3.0,Don't plan on having these for any adult costumes or parties...but they might fir in your 6 year-old's mouth.
3.0,"This swimsuit is so cute that I really wanted to keep it; however, even though the size was perfect it was probably assembled wrong.  The bottom part in front (under the skirt) felt as though it was backward, so I, unfortunately, had to return it. That is the reason I rated it 3 stars.  Because I was traveling and had no time to wait for it to arrive again I had to give it up.  I do like it, so I may consider reordering in the future.<br />Another thing is that the maker may want to rethink the design and somehow stitch the skirt to the bottom at a lower point to hold it in place because it is only stitched at the level of the pink trim and that may be a bit weird in the water.  Not a problem at all if you plan to wear it for another kind of activity."
3.0,"Love these and they look so pretty in person. The only thing I didn’t like is where the post is attached in the back. It’s not centered to the earring and while other may not find it bad, I dislike not being able to center a stud earring in the middle of the lobe."
3.0,"Good product, a little larger eye piece than it looked. Clear lenses, good sturdy frames and nice colors. Very happy with these readers!"
3.0,The earrings are very well made.<br />I hated they would never stay in place.<br />Did not itch
3.0,"Son uses these for racing.  They seem sturdy but he has only wore them once so far.  As the season gets going, we will see how they hold up."
3.0,"I wanted to love this sweater. Great color for me, fabric was wonderful. But it was made for a little girl -- or little people. It stretched just fine, but the sleeves were 3/4 length on me and the bottom of the sweater was at my waist instead of my hips. Very disappointed. I checked the size and it was correct. Just not made for a &#34;medium&#34; person of my (average) height. So I gave it to my son's fiancée, who is probably 4 inches shorter than I am, and very tiny in general."
3.0,"The product itself is great. Provides toasty heat. However I ordered a large and I'm not that big, 5'7"", 185 pnds, and it's tight. Like really tight.  It says true to size but that's not correct. You need to order at least one size up."
3.0,It's super cute. But the fabric is like cheap costume fabric which is not much to be desired so I haven't actually worn it yet. I wear a 36G and the top fit just right if I wanted to reveal a little bit of my chest but I could always pair it with a tank top underneath if I don't want too.
3.0,The fleece lining inside keeps the cap from being able to stretch.
3.0,nice pants waist fit correct but the length was about 6 inches too long
3.0,These are okay but the fabric is cheap and see through... no tighty wighties in these boys. Lol
3.0,Tried really hard but never was able to get them to work for me. The different viewing areas are too small. Quality is nice otherwise.
3.0,Giant and cute but not as squishy as others in the market
3.0,Omg this hat is awesome!  The quality wasn't the best but suited its purpose and I loved the design!
3.0,"Colors are nice and bright in person.  For me the fit, even though I ordered up a size, was still too small.  Material felt nice.  Had to return."
3.0,Too short waisted and tends to creep up. Otherwise the quality and look are good.
3.0,It's cute and functional however much smaller then expected for the price.  Slightly disappointed but no worth doing a return.
3.0,The fit seemed a bit awkward. Too tight on the bottom and loose up top. It felt uncomfortable and awkward.
3.0,"I am 5'8"" and this dress did not come anywhere near my ankles as pictured in the photo. It is somewhere between a midi and a maxi. Really awkward. It's such a bummer because the print is cute, it's not see through, and doesn't show cleavage. I bought my usual size and it fit perfectly, except for the length. I think this would be really cute on shorter women."
3.0,I can't Complain about the quality or shopping time but if you have a somewhat big-ish head get a larger size as these are a bit small
3.0,Very nice blouse but you have get size up...it fits small
3.0,I really like the idea of this but wish the speakers were better quality Bennie fit kinda snug nice and soft just wish the headphones were better sounding and the Bluetooth on these sucks cuts out when to far from phone sometimes cuts out when just in my pocket
3.0,"The bottoms were beautiful, but the cotton was a blend of polyester and cotton and they called it 100% cotton.  At least that is what I thought I was buying.  They fit, b ut were too tight, fabric was stiff like a pressed shirt was afraid if washed first they  would shrink and then I could not return.  Also polyester is too hot.  Wanted a thin cotton that was flimsy and loose for comfort.  Not a pressed pant."
3.0,They fit...not in the right places lmao makes my butt look like a granny! o.o Good for night time wear though
3.0,"These earrings are much smaller than they appear in the pictures and their delicacy is more suited for my granddaughter.  However, I bought them to match a two tone heart necklace she gave me, so I'm keeping them."
3.0,These glasses came in as expected and were of quality the only down fall was my lenses came with one minor scratch!!! I love them and they are truly polarized!!! They are amazing other than the minor detail!!!
3.0,I like the tint progression. Find the nose piece doesn’t stay on the top of my nose well. Also having issues with attaching mirrors to the frame due to its shape.
3.0,i ordered the wrong size  but beautiful shirt
3.0,"I don't really like this duster. The fabric is very thin, it doesn't have a nice ""drape"". The pockets are droopy. I actually stitched the pockets closed so they look neater."
3.0,"I like the earrings okay, but the quality lacks a little. Some of mine only had 3 prongs on the stone, leaving a high probability for stones to fall out"
3.0,"Fits well except there plastic, so breakage is expected!😁"
3.0,Nice shirt but long sleeves too tight
3.0,"Super cute, but very fitted"
3.0,"Finest socks I've ever owned, and absolutely worth 5 stars if the price weren't so absurdly high.<br />$20 for **one** pair of socks ?!?!?!<br />$10 per each foot ?!?!?!<br />Those must have been very, very special sheep that went into making these."
3.0,"Loved them and fast shipping, wish the edges weren't so sharp"
3.0,"Odd fit, Ok if you have a square head"
3.0,"Disappointed!  Returned it!  It was not a full 16&#34;.  It would not do for what I wanted, maybe for a young child, it would be fine with a low investment!"
3.0,"The necklace clasp broke after less than 3 weeks of wear, and my son took it off while swimming, bathing and sleeping. Cheap for a reason, this is cheaply made."
3.0,I've ordered these pants four times in the past.  Same size but different colors.  These were too short and to small in the hips.  I even lost 14 lbs and could not get them on without breaking a seam.  Very disappointed for lack of consistency.
3.0,Swarovski element is amazing but chain looks bit shineless than expected
3.0,Product is made of heavy and stiff fabric. Runs a little on the smaller side. My son wears a Men's small or Medium. We purchased a larger and it's still small.
3.0,"This hat would be cute, if it was much smaller.  Not because it fits too big, it's a huge hat!  I looked like a baby in it!"
3.0,"It's much smaller and taller than I expected. I have a small head to begin with, so this will not fit on your head if you have a normal or large head. It's very snug on mine. I also kind of had to roll it in slightly due to just how tall it is. I know it's supposed to be &#34;slouchy&#34;, but it is currently MUCH too stiff to slouch and just kind of sticks out if I don't tuck it in. I wouldn't recommend it."
3.0,This was a lot of fabric for my short 5’4 frame. Also the ruffles for me hit right along the widest parts of my body making them look larger. Seems designed for very thin tall people.
3.0,Like the dress but company didn’t send me a belt…
3.0,"THE CHEMICAL SMELL GAVE BOTH MY DAUGHTER AND I A BAD HEADACHE!!  This is a cute hat but what ever they did to make it makes it smell like chemicals so bad, we were using them for a run and it was freezing we could not figure out what was smelling like chemicals, when we returned we figured out it was the hats, they were out of there packaging for a week prior to the run so I think its may be a permanent issue!"
3.0,"awesome concept just didn’t fit me right, my mistake."
3.0,The description does not correspond to reality.<br />They have a specific smell. Very small
3.0,Cute but way to small for my knuckles!
3.0,Very small. What says it’s a 2x fits like a medium. My daughter can weR this and it fits her great and she normally wears a medium. Far from the 2x it’s labeled.
3.0,"Loved the earrings, put them on right away, however, wore less than 24 hours, one fell out and hit the ground and broke like glass, so bummed."
3.0,the neck and chest area fits small???
3.0,The medal is great but the chain is too thin.
3.0,"Two broke at the base immediately, some were slightly bent. Very low quality. You get what you pay for."
3.0,Didn't fit well in the frame. Still useable.
3.0,I love the boots but they run too small<br />But ordered another pair in a bigger size. I hope they fit.
3.0,it's not the same color that looks like in the website does not match with my watch  :(
3.0,I didn't like the material. It's basically hoodie material and the coat doesn't lay right. It needs to be stiffer material for it to pull off the style its going for.
3.0,The design is cute and as pictured. The fit is tighter in the arms than expected and feels like a spandex material.
3.0,I feel like these rings always want to slide off my fingers. But they are really cute!
3.0,"it was okay, size runs small,"
3.0,No screws
3.0,"It's not like the photo at all. just a few strips of fabric. It's not much of a coverup, but it worked for going down to the beach at our hotel. It runs a little small, but fit ok."
3.0,Not bad fitting gloves other than the fact that I cannot snap the clasp together and have to wear them opened.
3.0,"Meant to look authentic, but the misaligned letters have the effect of making it look cheap."
3.0,Tight shaft. Comes up too high on the leg. Uncomfortable and difficult to bend the leg. I’m 5’4” and 110lbs got size 5.5.
3.0,I was expecting the lens to be a little bit bigger
3.0,"I bought according to the size chart and the socks are a little too short toe to heel, and the ankle is tight without much elasticity. I should have bought one to two sizes larger."
3.0,Average fit and finish. Used for costume purpose. Case is nice zippered soft-sided and practical. Hard to keep mirrored lenses clean.
3.0,"This is a review for the 1 pack of Forcool Ankle Socks in Dark Gray & Green. I’m specifying because there a lot of options under the listing.<br /><br />These are just an average pair of socks. They’re not especially thick or well-suited for athletic use. My feet were sweaty after just wearing the socks around the house, not doing anything really strenuous, so I wouldn’t be able to wear these for a workout. The material didn’t wick well.<br /><br />The socks run small. Size large fits men’s shoe size 4-8. I wear a men’s 7.5 shoe and the large socks were snug. Fortunately the socks didn’t shrink when I washed and dried them."
3.0,can and is as said to be.
3.0,"Buttons are poorly put on and fall off easily but I love the shirt, material, color, style, and comfort. If you know how to sew on a button, pretty simple, I love it."
3.0,"I didn't expect much from such a cheap product.  The oval &#34;button&#34; popped off when I first tried to fit it over my child's foot (it didn't fit, but I don't blame them for that).  Wow, managed to be even cheaper than I expected."
3.0,I like these sunnies very much. The cat eye shape is cool but not too huge. They look great on. My only criticism is that they have an obvious seam down the middle that makes them look a little cheap.
3.0,"This dress is made from an higher quality/ thicker material, which surprised me in a good way, but it is pretty long. That's not really a fault though, as I'm only 5'4 so that was to be expected. However, the pockets on the hips of the dress bulk out and make my hips look huge. I was expecting the dress to slightly drape around my body, but it was really baggy."
3.0,Run small and fabric a bit thin
3.0,size was too large and the item was not soft enough. Price was great
3.0,Not sure I will be able to wear it because it is so clingy and tight. Love the print.
3.0,Very nice print and colors.  Nice light material.  It Is sheer so you have to wear a tank underneath.  A little boxy.  I tied at corner to add some shape which made it cuter.  Overall good.
3.0,I guess you get what you pay for - don't get me wrong ....they are cute & they are cheap. And that's basically what I'd expect for what I paid. But I need to start paying better attention to shipping charges!
3.0,"The watch is alright not as I expected , but there is many feature , the belt of the watch is pretty dull locking the watch is harder"
3.0,Liked the shoe but it was too small...this is the only brand I buy so I was surprised about this!
3.0,Cute! But they don't stay on my kid. Keep slipping off.
3.0,Nice fabric but if your over 6feet dont bother they'll be short.
3.0,Love the print and fit. Very comfortable. Fabric is fading and showing wear after first (hand) washing.
3.0,"They seem great at first, but then I find that the front is heavier and starts to fall forward so the earring looks like it's coming out.  Be careful not to snag as well.  The open front can get caught!"
3.0,Runs a bit small. Buy a larger size than you think you would wear. Quality of the fabric is decent.
3.0,decent not the same quality as nextbelt but for the price good knock around belt.  color of belt leather not as brown as picture.  so looks cheap.  hey because it is cheap.
3.0,"These bracelets way too tight for me, even tho they expand. Wish they came in extra large."
3.0,Cute thin kind of made on the cheap
3.0,Very strong chemical smell. Muffled my voice so much I could not use it as it was. I ended up taking out a lot of the internal working so that my voice can carry a bit more. However the smell was so bad I ended up not using it as a actual mask. Only for photo shoots.
3.0,but I really needed something in that color and it was toward the end of the season.  I knew I wouldn't have much choice so I kept it.
3.0,Used for two days and the three on one of the slippers came off.
3.0,Zipper is hard to open and close comes off track and broke
3.0,"This dress had potential, but it didn't work for me in practice.<br /><br />The good news is that it was oversized as described.  I do like the style, and it has the potential to be cute on some people with the right fit.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I don't think that's going to be true for many folks.  This is very, very short - on my body, it borders on inappropriate to wear out and about.  Unless you pair it with leggings or tights, this is going to require you to have a lot of confidence wearing something super short in public.<br /><br />Separately from the length, the fit is a little off expectations.  The size through the shoulders and chest runs extra small, so those with broad shoulders or a larger size chest are likely going to find it too restrictive to move freely in.<br /><br />While I do like the appearance of the material, it's pretty thin and will likely shrink as well as wrinkle in the washing machine. My experience has been that this will require a steamer or iron after washing to achieve the look I prefer.<br /><br />For me, I'll likely end up using this as an at-home-date-night dress or as a swimsuit coverup.  (The same reasons that make it unusable in public made my partner a pretty enthusiastic fan, so there's that, at least.)<br /> If that's what you're looking for it for, and you aren't broad shouldered, it might work for you!  It might also be more viable if you're on the short-to-very-short side.  But for me, this has pretty limited utility."
3.0,"Although I read the size of this handbag before buying, when I got it, I couldn't believe how big it was."
3.0,This is more on me for  having a larger faece. but the mask is very heavy. and although it looks good. the strings are too long and the mask itself is too small.
3.0,"I do like it. However, the material is a little off as well as the brown color. It's in between a boarder line brownish-olive and grayish-beige...just a bit weird. If you would like more room in the arms, order up!"
3.0,So these work as advertised and I can see just fine. I gave them 3 stars because they needed to be trimmed to fit my glasses. I didn't have a super sharp pair of scissor so i had to buy a pair to cut them correctly. Maybe making these is different sizes would reduce the need to cut them? Or Amazon should suggest a scissor with purchase... P.I.T.A
3.0,order a size up. because of the tight fit you will not be able to wear it in your size especially if you are big-chested. looks great tho
3.0,I think this suit would be cute on a small chested person I think the fit was awkward and uncomfortable. It offers no support either. Definitely size up one it runs small. I'm returning this.
3.0,I like the aprons but the ties aren’t attached very well and came off one of the aprons the first time I wore it.
3.0,"Material was a bit thin, sexier cut than expected.  Ordered a large but it was too big, waiting for medium to arrive."
3.0,I bought this dress as for wearing to fall festivals. It’s very comfortable and even though it does seem somewhat cheaply made it has held up pretty decently even after a few washes. The only thing I’d add is that unless you are SUPER busty and I mean DD or bigger you should probably order a size down than you’re normal size. It’s a stretchy material and the way the top part is cut there’s almost too much room for the ladies. For reference I’m 5’ 6” 200 lbs and I usually wear a 38 DD bra and a size 16 or XL and the top part of it was a bit too roomy even with a bra on. It fit better when I wore my padded bra but that bra has straps so I had to wear a shrug with that bra and it was even roomy with a padded bra.
3.0,received the wrong size at first then exchanged for the right size which was still a bit bigger then the chart listed.
3.0,My child’s skin gets irritated from the band When she sweats. The face is water resistant but I don’t recommend swimming with the watch.
3.0,ok hard to keep untangled
3.0,Color and material were nice. Cups were a little big and gave me pointy boobs. 🤷🏼‍♀️ Sent it back.
3.0,It's  a lot bigger than I expected. Not something I will wear everyday.
3.0,I gave it a 3 stars because it was so cute when I wore it but i only got to wear it 1 time because it shrunk after I washed it 😖.
3.0,I ordered beige gloves…but they are brown! Nice fit and quality but the colour is disappointed ☹️
3.0,This product runs small. I bought and XL for myself and ended up giving it to my 12 year old for a sleep shirt. Super cute though.
3.0,They are beautiful but front heavy and pull down in the front so you can’t really see how pretty they are you’re only able to see the ear hole with how they hang. They came quick and were a great price just wish they looked better on.
3.0,The actual watch band is nice and the fit is good. However the smaller loop to slide the band is thin and broke with regular use
3.0,"The hooded robe is AMAZING! It’s soft and cute and fits well BUT the description is misleading! I was specifically looking for a hooded towel for the pool and this is NOT a towel! It is a soft, fleece like robe."
3.0,"Following is my review of Gutztag Sunglasses. I was pretty excited when I got these. They came really beautifully packaged and looked very high-end. They came with both a soft and hard case, a cleaning cloth, and a card to verify that they're polarized. They are very cool looking sunglasses, a dark gray metal. They look super nice.<br /><br />But as soon as I put them on I realized there was something wrong with the lenses. Things just didn't look clear. I even had my husband try them, and our friend, and they both had the same experience I did. In fact our friend swears they're not polarized (the fish on the card shows otherwise though). I'm used to cheap sunglasses, so my expectations were not high. But honestly, I can't even use these. I don't even know what to do with them now. Maybe I just got a defective pair because others seem to like them. One other issue I found is that because of the nose pads I couldn't put these on top of my head because they would get stuck in my hair every time.<br /><br />The three stars is for the look and presentation, but for me these sunglasses are unusable.<br /><br />*The above is my honest opinion. I hope it's been helpful."
3.0,This arrived today and while it was pretty I did not realize it would have glitter and metallic thread on it. For someone this would be nice but it is way to flashy now for my personality.
3.0,I liked that it was easy to fasten but it broke after month
3.0,"Cute tank for cool summer nights. Returned because it was too short, stopped at top of waist, and not the look I was going for. Wish it was a little longer. Bought a size medium. Going up a size would be extremely too big. 5’6, 145 for reference."
3.0,"I am a pretty solid size 14 and ordered an XL.  The width of the trunk of the shirt is super large and roomy as expected, the thing that surprised me was tight seam where the sleeves begins (about halfway between the shoulder and the elbow).  That seam is a little snug and rubs but the rest of the sleeve is fine.  It also appears to be a few inches shorter than shown on the model, not long enough to wear with legging.  It is also MUCH thinner than I thought it would be when you think of a waffle knit shirt and I would probably wear with a tank top in public.  Overall ok, I’m going to keep but won’t be ordering more."
3.0,"Super cute dress, but too tight in the chest.  I am normally a size 12, 5'4&#34;, and a 36D.  Dress definitely is too tight on my bust.  I wish there was a XL available."
3.0,hated the material...too small...had to send back...I was disappointed
3.0,I like the wallet but I ordered pink and it is red. Not sure I want to deal with returning it and getting a different color. I'm usually not too picky about stuff but I just do not like having a red and gold wallet. Has a lot of space. Is definitely what I'm looking for in a wristlet wallet.
3.0,"Confused by sizing. I bought a pair of these during my 2018 pregnancy and I got size large based if size chart. They were always super tight and uncomfortable. I'm now pregnant again and dealing with even more varicose veins so wanted a new pair, the size chart and review seemed to have changed so I got a large again. I'm 5'7 160 lbs at 15 weeks. Size 6 normally. They arrived and they looked exactly same size as my old ones so I didn't even try them on and ordered an xlarge. Got those today and tried them on and they are way too big. Too stretchy to provide compression, waist band goes up to my bra. So then I decided I better try on the new large pair and they do actually fit and may be a little big. Can't decide if I'm keeping them as not sure they will give enough compression. I need a good pair for going on a road trip. I just wish I could find the right fit."
3.0,I went with these because im expecting and the fit is perfect! These are absolutely adorable but they smell so bad!!!
3.0,"I love Miraclesuits, and this one is cute. However, it's very low cut, more so than any suit I've owned. Half of each breast will be on display, and would only look good on someone with very perky breasts."
3.0,"For the price it is a beautiful watch. QC needs some work.<br />Very pretty dial, display caseback, butterfly clasp.<br />However it ran almost 20 minutes fast per day out of the box.<br />I had to send it back."
3.0,"It had a very strong plastic smell. I washed it and put it outside to air out and after about a week, the smell is almost gone.  It's the perfect size for a laptop."
3.0,Very comfortable.  Only laundered once and decals are cracking.
3.0,Could be just me but the band gave me a red itchy splotch on both wrists.  I workout with it of course and sweat but never happened with other bands.  Love the style but couldn’t keep wearing it
3.0,Not the color I wanted. But the blue camo is still a nice color. I was hoping for the dark grey camo. Was very easy to install on my Apple Watch.
3.0,"Soft material and adjustable straps, didn't like how thick it was though, too hot to wear in warmer weather."
3.0,Product was not exactly as the picture
3.0,That is all.
3.0,Outfit was not what I expected... The picture shown is a cotton outfit... I received a more polyester outfit... it’s cute but not what I ordered
3.0,"I am 5'1 170lbs and I ordered the Large. It fit me well--a little tight but not bad. The top on the other hand, I hate it. It looks so weird. The black cups were lopsided and i had to use a safety pin to make it look even remotely alright and then even when I did the black pulled down low to barely cover my nipples. Probably will never wear the top portion due to that."
3.0,The print is very small. You can barely read what it says.
3.0,Cute but heavy and the loops always fold back.
3.0,"I really liked the gray color, but the dress was too big. I am 5’9”, 155 lbs and it just hung on me with no real definition in the waist, despite the elastic band."
3.0,Nice dress but I am 5 feet 2 inches and it fell too long on me.  The dress texture was very nice though and you would like! Top is streatchy - I didn't have time to get hemmed before my trip!
3.0,"I like the style. But,  The fabric is too thin unfortunately. The fabric looks cheap."
3.0,"Came damaged missing buttons for the neck. Will have to buy a button, true to size though"
3.0,These are nice gaiters.  They are soft and the material is nice.  They are well - made.  But... I cannot tell any difference in being able to breath better than a mask.
3.0,"the material is nice but I am very disappointed in the size, this might be 2XL in women's but it definitely ain't a 2XL for men"
3.0,The gradient was not as dark as the last pair I bought. Too light
3.0,"Ordered a large but fits like a small. I like my pjs loose fitting. Otherwise, really cute!"
3.0,"Not sure what happened to these reviews but hopefully will go through this time. Super cute dress - light, pretty, fits well and is flattering but it's so sheer as to not be practical to wear. I like everything about the look of this but wish it were lined better...even with the liner, it's too sheer to wear."
3.0,"My husband really like swim shorts, however while we were in the pool, both pockets became like balloons and my husband had to put the pockets back in each time he got in the water."
3.0,I like the slight compression of this top but haven’t worn them much because of the polyester fabric... I prefer more cotton with spandex
3.0,"Looks ok, super big. Filipino wife won’t wear it due to it being so big on her face"
3.0,Giftable value for the money
3.0,"Fit nice, after the first wash it looked abit used up"
3.0,"Pretty designs, but about half of mine wouldn't open."
3.0,A little short but good quality
3.0,"...but they must think it will be worn only by eight year olds, because the cord provided just isn't anywhere near long enough to get around my neck. It doesn't have a clasp so it won't work with a chain; it needs a cord, which I don't have.<br /><br />But the pendant itself it pretty cool."
3.0,"Arrived broken - it's been over a week no replacement yet, amazon it is 'processing' my request. Let's see. Besides that they are nice if weren't broken."
3.0,"My hair only fits after the first day it’s flat ironed, Not comfortable and the fabric isn’t very good"
3.0,"The top was too small and the bottoms too large, but it did arrive in good time"
3.0,I was planning on wearing this to a holiday party but the slit comes up too far. The slit is in an awkward place and it is hard to keep in place while walking.
3.0,"cheap frames, not very durable"
3.0,not exactly what i was expecting but it'll do
3.0,"Nothing special about it, something to wear when you go out."
3.0,I thought the loose part would be flattering to my stomach but if you're carrying around any extra weight or loose skin in the middle this top doesn't hide it like you'd think it would.
3.0,Runs a little s
3.0,"Good product, but the gold wore off within 2 weeks. Still a good necklace, but now monotone."
3.0,Returned the first and they sent another with dead battery.<br />I just bit the bullet and changed the battery because the watch looks nice.<br />The blue color is really nice. It's inexpensive. The band is not good.<br />Wrapped links and hollow end links but it's so cheap that who would expect different?
3.0,The top of the tank top didn’t have any stretch at all like the rest of the top did and made it fit like a small/medium and I was even sizing up ordering a large
3.0,"I love the look and price of these sunglasses..They are so clear! HOWEVER, I wiped them with my towel when I had water and them and it left a permanent smudge. I unfortunately will be sending back."
3.0,This runs small as I normally wear a large to XL and this fits more like a medium. Had to give it my daughter.
3.0,"I ordered based on waist measurements and it’s snug on my hips. It’s not as firm as I was hoping for, I have others that work much better. Also, the torso is way too long. It bunches up when I sit. My torso is not overly long or overly short.<br /><br />For the price, I find it to be acceptable, but I have also purchased much better quality products for the same price that fit much better."
3.0,I am 5'4 and 150 lbs. with an athletic build and reading some of the reviews I thought I would need a large but it is much larger than I expected. The fabric is also thinner than I expected.
3.0,fade the gold color
3.0,Beautif dress came too late for evrnt.
3.0,"I wear this dress with leggings.  You can dress it up or down.  However,  the fabric is very flimsy. And there are no pockets. I knew that when I bought it, but pockets are sorely missed here."
3.0,"The material itself is thin, but not bad. It’s a decent shirt.<br />The print is not on top of the material, but into the top layer, so it’ll presumably last a few washes.<br />This is a shirt to show off for a little bit, but it isn’t a shirt for the long haul.<br />The print itself looks like a blurry blown up version of an image that should have gone into a postcard size print.<br />I bought size small and it’s definitely blown up and lightly faded.<br />I posted a picture with a safety pin to make sure you see that it’s in focus. That’s how blurry it is. It’s not my camera, it’s the shirt itself.<br />The seller picture doesn’t really show that, so I think you should hear it from me.<br /><br />It’s good for a gag. That’s pretty much it. Don’t expect sharp lines and saturated colours."
3.0,"These glasses are very small for a man. The frame is very light weight. I felt like if I dropped them, the frame would get messed up. The sunglasses did feel very comfortable. That being said, the presentation was great. The case it came with was nice, looked high quality. It came with a cloth and polarization test card. Great presentation but the product itself was not as good.<br /><br />These glasses were too small for my face and looked weird. I did return these sunglasses."
3.0,Like a bit. A little bit small.
3.0,"The thing is Im 6'2 300lbs..I wouldnt order a small anything..unless it was intended as a gift for someone else. The hat is awsome,it just dosnt fit"
3.0,"I ordered this sweater and another in pink with yellow daisies. I just received them and they are very cute, soft and stretchy. They appear to be well made but they have not been worn yet. It’s interesting that both sweaters have no labels of any kind inside, no brand label, no size label, no material content label and no care label as you would always find stitched into other clothing. I find that very strange. The mom I’m giving these to for her daughter will have no information except the product info from your website."
3.0,It wasn't listed as a child and it is a bit small for an adult.
3.0,"Although it has comfortable material, the top is quite see-through. The coloring is also not as vibrant as the picture. It appears as though it is pink, but it is a rather subdued peach color. Still pretty, but I wish I had received what I thought I was purchasing."
3.0,I thought that I was ordering a continuous piece of interfacing but it came as 5 one yard pieces. It made cutting my patterns very difficult.
3.0,"Nice soft sweater. Had to return due to a stain! Was supposed to be a gift, so disappointed quality control was not spot on this one!"
3.0,Top fits great! The bottoms were tight and not flattering on me. The tie strings pull out of their holes too easily. Pattern matched what I ordered.
3.0,Cute tails for making pendants for mermaid party.  Disappointed that some of the tails were broken off.
3.0,"This isn't a thick hoodie as I expected. It's very thin and not warm. But it cute. Also, there aren't any pockets."
3.0,"I was so excited when I saw this. It looked like the perfect romper for me, but no. It's for but its odd. Too big and yet too small to long and too short. I feel if you're good at personalizing clothes then this could be for you. I honestly don't know who this would work for, you should try it for yourself and maybe return it if it doesnt work out?<br /><br />Cons<br />The crotch was huge<br />Top too small<br /><br />Pros<br />Fabric<br />I like the design?<br /><br />I'm 5'8 220 bust 47 under bust 38 hips 47<br />Big butt, big boobs, mama gut...... big lady."
3.0,"Its very cute, but not crazy about the material. I'm afraid when I wash it it's not going to be worn again."
3.0,Didn't really love the material.  Returned it because I really didn't like how it looked on me.  Looked way better in the picture.  I found much nicer cover-up for in this price range or less.
3.0,"These are pretty earrings on one side. The backside doesn't show turquoise.  This would work if you have long hair and wearing it down. But for short hair or if you're wearing it up like I am for a wedding it won't work.  Not really heavy, but for older ears it may pull a little too much. Overall my recommendation is if you are wearing your hair long and pretty youthful these would work. But I have to return bc I wear my hair up in a ponytail a lot and for special occasions.  Very inexpensive for cute earrings."
3.0,"I'm 5-4, 36-30-40, ordered a large, but just didn't fit me correctly. I really wanted to love this dress, but there was no way it would work for me. It was pretty true to size, but the fit did nothing for me. I loved the color, but wasn't super crazy about the lace on top, which is ironic because that was why I ordered it to begin with. Really wish this one would have worked for me, but unfortunately I'm sending it back."
3.0,The pins are very hard to insert into the band.  I broke the edge of one of my bands trying to get the pins in. Do not want to go thru the hassle of returning . . .
3.0,It's a cute shirt.. there are a few ways to play with the ties so you can wear it as low or high as you want. It doesn't really fit me the way it's shown on the model even though we have the same body type but I decided to keep it. Will go great with a pair of jeans for a casual look
3.0,It looks ok but was about two sizes to small i even went with a larger size then what the size chart told me hoping that it would fit. It also smells terrible.
3.0,"The suit color and design is very cute and of high quality, however I agree with other reviewers in that the proportions feel slightly off. I am 5'1, 120lbs, 32B, slim build all around (size 0/2), and ordered a Small. I felt that it was slightly snug, but a Medium wouldn't have solved the proportion issue. The cups are definitely on the small side and they were just barely large enough for me. The cups are also very low and the straps are long-- as if there is a bit too much chest area exposed without actually being flattering. This might fit someone just right, but just wasn't for me. For the record, my husband didn't think it looked weird, but preferred other suits I bought."
3.0,I like the packaging and the color of it. The only downfall is that it scratches very easily
3.0,a little sheer but good for around the house.
3.0,It’s cute but it’s much smaller than expected. It also  broke very easily.
3.0,"They are Okay. I bought three (btw galaxy A and B are the same thing). They are a little large and I need to put my hair in a low bun and put the gaiter over that to have it not fall down...but then it pulls tight against my mouth and I end up eating it when I talk. It’s a bit large for my pre-teen girls, but might be okay with the same hair strategy. Overall I’m underwhelmed, but hopefully they will work enough not to be a waste."
3.0,"I like the size of these glasses and the case, but one of the screws holding on the temple pieces came out within 3 months of wearing."
3.0,"Cute Dino boots, but they could have lined up the words better.  They have nice tread, but the seems on the toe are pieced where they tend to split pretty quickly."
3.0,"My granddaughter is tiny, and her regular size was quite small. I suggest sizing up. Otherwise, a cute shirt. Love the gathering on the shoulders."
3.0,It is nice but the price is not worth.
3.0,"the top is too large and to much cleavage,  material doesn't stretch at all. Material feels like kitchen curtins"
3.0,"This boot is not for wide feet. It is a very tough boot, though."
3.0,"This was a beautiful piece that I bought for my husband. You're supposed to wind it every day, but the winder broke and it stopped working after a week or so. Too bad. :("
3.0,"I have a normal size noggin', at least I thought. These were too narrow for a regular dude for me."
3.0,Seemed to be made very small in hips and legs and my girl is thin. Very cute!
3.0,Tag does not match picture listed ...but its LSU so it will still standout on my luggage
3.0,"These are really cute and worked great for the wedding my daughter was in. However, The bottom of the shoe is flapping off and she has only worn them a few times.. They didn't last very long."
3.0,"Fit was fine, quality was OK for the price.  However I ordered the brown and it is a really awful color of taupe.  Almost a light greenish brown. I will probably give it away."
3.0,Comfortable fit.  Just thought it would have<br />Been darker
3.0,"I had high hopes for these leggings, they are super cute and comfortable but EXTREMELY see through. So you get what you pay for I guess."
3.0,Very pretty. My daughter likes it. Cheaply made and starts to tarnish easily. Cute gift box that came with it. For the price it makes a nice little gift.
3.0,The ride up.  No cotton crotch lining makes them a bit hot.  Would not order more.
3.0,Cute fabric of good quality. Thick seams. Thick material would be good for winter but not for Florida humidity.
3.0,"I love the print, but I don't like the material so much. It is very clingy when you breathe or talk."
3.0,Love everything about it except for the shoulders. The look kinda poof like dresses from classical Europe.
3.0,Nice looking bag but the material is not a good quality
3.0,suede became ruffled
3.0,Bag is okay but the straps are too thin.
3.0,"This is a cute outfit, but it was a bit big in the strap area. We used a bow clip to tighten the straps by clipping them together. The stitching isn’t the best."
3.0,I'm having trouble taking them off so I can change bands. Any idea how to do this.
3.0,Not worth the price. The edges are poorly finished with a serger (looks like a zig zag stitch). Overall not very attractive.  Only good for wearing around the house.  I ordered 2 X.  I am 5’5. 200lbs. Fit was ok. Again. Not worth the price.
3.0,"fitting is fine, but very cheap material"
3.0,"The colors in the brooch in the picture has more contrast, using a darker pink, light pink, and white. The brooch I received was mostly all the same color, light pink, and white  pearls. The colors were not as pictured. The design was beautiful but just too monochromatic for me. I sent it back."
3.0,"After waiting over a month for this item, the bottom is definitely not cut right. The material is nice but doesn’t look right when on due to the hem. I understand this is a cheaper piece of clothing but feel it should still be cut as pictured."
3.0,"I sized up based on reviews and it was really big. I tried to shrink it when I washed it but it didn’t shrink much. It’s larger in the back, front fits better. Big around. Good length and material. Buttons bled the color a bit"
3.0,"These aren't shoes, but glasses designed for night driving. They are OK, but not as good at night as I would have liked."
3.0,It doesn't look cheap at all but the sleeves are so big.  Loved color and everything otherwise.
3.0,"Soooo.. it's pretty and comfy but see through asffff. But to work out at home, they're great."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:d993d053f3b157695bef4a9acdedd444]] Not the same purple that is pictured. Much brighter. It’s also kind of large for a 7, it’s constant twisting to the underside of my finger. Not super impressed at all."
3.0,A bit disappointed that it’s puffy sleeves thought it was a normal long sleeves shirt
3.0,Protects the watch well. Plasticy not rubbery. Hard plastic feeling. Parts don’t shape to each other well. Have to constantly move the little holder back in place.
3.0,The cuff itself was a lot bigger than I expected and when I tried to put it on it was not long enough to be hooked by the bar at the back of my ear. So. I could only secure the front with the bar.
3.0,Thought the middle part would have been more pronounced.
3.0,love it.  material quality very good (better than i expected)
3.0,Sleeves are short for a medium. Glad I didn't get a small. The material is very thin but it is bulky in the front and flat in the back.
3.0,Came quickly and expected. Photo dos not clearly shows the dark lines on the mask.  I would have preferred them not to be there.  But am satisfied with the product.
3.0,"It’s a cute swimsuit and good quality for the price. The only down side is the breast area, it’s very open and if not careful could have a boob slip."
3.0,Very comfortable and has good sized pockets. The seams arnt the best and I had to restitch mine.
3.0,Decent. Not spectacular.
3.0,Fits true to size. Print is nice only complaint is the material. It’s a silky shiny almost see through fabric that looks a bit cheap.
3.0,"This review is for the teal &#34;Moose&#34; &#34;Nice Rack&#34; socks, although the image is for a different sock. Very cute socks, ordered an XL as a gift for a man, which these were supposed to be for a male relative, but they didn't fit the recipient, too small, so he gave them to his wife and she loves them and he says they are cuter on her anyways. Ha! The socks themselves are good quality, esp for the intricate design, just wish the men's XL I ordered was actually a men's XL. I think these are now out of stock, so I'm not holding my breath they will come back online anytime soon. Too bad because he is into all things moose."
3.0,Out of the 50 from each of the packs I purchased about half of them were unusable. The images are half on the cabochon and half off. This is a disappointment because they are cute. Don't waste your time or money until the quality control has increased.
3.0,"Was absolutely in love with this ring, sadly a piece if it broke off around the gem. Still wear it but sad it broke so easily in the first week I wore it.."
3.0,Great as a base to add additional fabric to and tulle. This has to hang for a few days once out of packaging to settle and form.
3.0,Too small fits like a med i ordered xl
3.0,"I bought this dress in a Large at first (my normal size), regardless of what the reviews said about sizing down because I have big breasts and wanted to accommodate for that. I got it, tried it on, was too big, exchanged it for a smaller size (Medium). I was refunded my money the very next day. Very pleased! Got the medium in and it still looked kind of big....too flowy but I am going to add a belt with it and I believe that will solve the problem :) It does show the very top of my bra, but I honestly just think it was the type of bra I was wearing and even if it isn't, that can be fixed with some bra tape to hold it in place so it doesn't show. I honestly can't wait to wear it for my engagement pictures at the end of the month."
3.0,"cute in theory but waist was too small, legs were too long and overall felt very cheap material …. returned"
3.0,No use for pilates.  Good everyday lounging socks
3.0,"looks very cute, color is nice, size is good ( more on the small side). I wish the handle was shorter. It just looks disproportionate : small bag with long handle... Nope"
3.0,Wife wore though them after wearing three times.  holes right through the big toes.  They are very thin.
3.0,The fabric is not as soft as some of the bigger brands but it is dirt cheap. Make sure to wash it with fabric conditioner 2 or 3 times before use.
3.0,sent back wrong color not a pictrured
3.0,"I was excited to purchase this product bc the style is cute. I'm 5 ft, weigh about 90lbs. The product stated it'll fit a skinny person or for junior, so I got a small. When I tried it on, the top was fine.  The bottom, however, was loose. If it was an x-small, it would have been better. Overall, this was OK. I'll only be able to use the top.<br /><br />I got this product at a discounted price. It did not  affect my opinions/make me bias."
3.0,Lovely outfit a bit on the small size but i expected that as it came from China good thing ny four year old is on the tiny side so it fits her great but won't last her very long
3.0,"So I bought this set as a back up to a pair of earrings I was gifted for xmas (the starburst and crescent moon with cubic zirconia pair). I searched amazon high and low for the same exact pair bc I lost the starburst earring from the set I was gifted, and according to this items photo ads this 4 pair set had that exact same pair and 3 other pairs of earrings for under 10 bucks!! A great value for sure!! But once I opened my package I found that the cubic zirconia starburst and moon set looked nothing like the ones in the pic (aka my original set). But still pretty nonetheless. Also, the butterfly set looks a bit different irl too...flimsy-er. The huggie hoops on each of the 4 pairs are very small and the clasp/cusp thing is VERY tight. I do know they wont be falling off my ears anytime soon bc how hard it is to pry them open but Im so afraid Im gonna break them as Im putting them on/taking them off bc how much force it takes to do so. The regular star set and the regular moon set are great. Exactly as advertised..although the metal is a bit thin. Overall 3 stars."
3.0,Cute outfit but fits more like 12-18 mos size BEFORE washing.
3.0,"These sunglasses are cute and stylish. However, they are not very sturdy. They have a cheap feel to them and don't feel like they will last long. My 18 year old daughter loves the way these look!"
3.0,Stub is easy to bend when putting the back on
3.0,"I love it but the snake is too big for my ear. I dont have small ears so I wonder if it's just the spacing of the piercing. It was a pain in the butt to get in my ear too. With the snake on the bar, my ear feels like it did fresh after being pierced, I thought it would go away but it's been a few weeks now and I'm finally taking it out,  the soreness isn't worth the look."
3.0,I love the ring. Only issue I have is the main heart shaped crystal has a chip missing from it.
3.0,"Cute outfit. But it runs small. I ordered a 5/6 which my girl wears, but it will only fit for the summer season."
3.0,"not that heavy duty or great quality, but gets the job done for the price"
3.0,"Negatives:<br />One-size is way too big for me. I usually wear a size 8. They're baggy around the ankles and loose around the top. I was afraid if I moved, they'd fall off.<br />Plus side:<br />They're extremely soft and the seams aren't scratchy. Not going to keep anyone warm outdoors, but would have been perfect at work (might not have needed my ""desk blanket."") I'm really sad that I was swimming around in them and have to return them. What am I going to wear now?"
3.0,"Sleeves are cute, size guide was accurate. I thought this was going to be a flowy top but it’s clingy and not flattering on my pregnant, size 14 body. It’s also very see through, so you have to wear a tank top under it. Good price so I’ll keep to wear around the house but I’d  gotten it to wear as a basic to Christmas events"
3.0,The quality is ok.  Bone used was a little thin. The hook is made one sided.
3.0,needs some elastic in it to hold it on.  Children don't like bobby pins.
3.0,Wrong fabric for summer wear.
3.0,Need to return it’s too small please let me know how I can go about it<br />Thank you
3.0,"While I did end up returning this shirt, the weight and quality of it is definitely 4 stars.  This would have been a really great shirt, but since I'm a curvy girl I just didn't find it flattering for my body style.  I have an hourglass figure with hips that are wide enough and the design of this just wasn't slimming.  It was more like a shapeless bag.  I think maybe if the material had a little more give to it it would hug my curves a little more, but it's a heavier fabric (which I was surprised about and definitely liked) so it was just a bit stiff.  I ordered it in two sizes - true size and one larger.  Both would have been perfect if they had a bit more give, and I would have gone with the larger one because of the length."
3.0,"These socks were of a nice material & great colors. I ordered S/M size. Unfortunately, I had to return them because they were waaaay too big. Wish they came in XS"
3.0,Too small and were a bit scuffed up so I sent them back.
3.0,Loved the bling look but fit me small. Ended up giving it to my 11 year old.
3.0,"I scanned socks at Target and these came up as a replacement. They're basically real cheapy socks. They're very thin and I don't feel like they'll last. Honestly, if I knew they'd be this cheap, I'd have just bought the ones at Target for like 4 bucks more."
3.0,",Don't<br /> fit as tightly as I hoped."
3.0,Size large fits like a medium.
3.0,Thought it would be tighter more firm .
3.0,They are quite see through
3.0,Easy to use.  Not wide enough
3.0,Don’t be to ruff with it not that strong
3.0,Small even for my daughter
3.0,"Cute dress, a little cheap looking, but if you have boobs, don't buy.  You wont fit in it. I am a 38D and there was no way."
3.0,"I’m a tall girl so the length seemed abnormally short, even with how short I already wear my dresses. For a short person even, this is a short dress..."
3.0,Very nice swimsuit but extremely smaller than the size I requested. I ordered a size 8/9 big girls but it fit a size 4 toddler.
3.0,"Bought this same dress, different manufacturer, and it is considerably smaller thsn the others I ordered.  The EUOVMY brand didn't come in this color, which is why I ordered from irene inevent.  Same exact photo, but not the same dress."
3.0,expected it to be bigger but an okay trinket
3.0,"LOVE THE LOOK, GREAT SHOES. ONE THING ONLY BUT STILL OK SHOES IS A BIT NARROW."
3.0,"Earpieces snapped off instantly when I tried to bend them to fit, as I do with everything. It was easy enough to replace them with a little InstaMorph plastic, and the lenses are wonderful and wide. But be warned, the earpieces are all plastic instead of the wire core that makes most sunglasses adjustable."
3.0,"The socks are nice - they are adorable, but they are also super thin (I can see my toes through the socks). I doubt they'll hold up to much wearing. Also, I wear a women's 8 and they are almost too small for me, so the sizing is definitely wrong. I love the design but taking a star off for how thin they are and another star off for the extremely incorrect sizing. I don't think they'll last long, between being thin and them being stretched almost to the max for my size 8 foot."
3.0,good quality but pretty small for my head. Hopefully they will stretch out.
3.0,Dress ran a little short.
3.0,"The charms were great quality, colorful, and perfect for my 4 year old nephew the disappointment was that we did not receive the bracelet for the extra charms. Maybe I miss read as the description does not specify that it comes with one but I assumed because they show it in the photos so just FYI it doesn't come with one"
3.0,"Nice but was way to small for my wife, who is also small. Ended up giving it to my 13 yo daughter and she could barely get it on. Wish it was bigger."
3.0,"Tried the large and it was waaaay to small.  Tried the XL and it was still small, but not horribly.  Will still need to wear spankz like under garment.  Seller was super with the return (keep it, here’s your refund) but I hate to do that twice so I’ll just deal with another dress that’s really cute but still doesn’t fit well.  Good thing it’s just for “Prom Dress Bowling” !"
3.0,"Not bad for the price, but definitely not great quality. The material is somewhat itchy & the whole thing is not very supportive. But again, it isn’t terrible for the price."
3.0,The fingers are oddly long and I have long limbs. I can't get to the end to use the touchscreen tips.<br /><br />The leather is soft and I love the box they presented in
3.0,Looks like a 20 dollar pair of boots . You get what you pay for
3.0,"The shirt is on the smaller side and I'd recommendsizing up. The lace collar is tight and scratchy. Shirt is cute, just wish it didn't have the uncomfortable collar."
3.0,The boot it's self is nice and the color is rich. However the calf part of the boots run small.
3.0,not like a Navy watch hat -lighter loose fit
3.0,I was attracted to the cute picture in this product listing. However when you see it in real life it is not impressive in any way.<br />Personally I would just give this one a pass.
3.0,Zippers are messed up though on all. Hope they last a little while though. Long enough to get my money’s worth.
3.0,"Qhite is super cheap looking and see through!!! I cannot wear it for the purpose I bought it for due to being able to see even my nude colored bra through it. They run a little loose fitting and scoop neck is kinda low so don't order a size up, order the size you wear.  The black isn't see through! Soft comfy material!"
3.0,The shark teeths were smaller than what i expected
3.0,I bought this for my 11 year old daughter and it’s way too small. Make sure to order a size up.
3.0,"Love the fit and fabric feel, but the sewing came apart after 1 wash. The seems opened in the leg. Don’t think I can see it back due to thin material. But cute and comfy"
3.0,The scarf was nice but it was not what it was described. The description says that it was suppose to be 6 feet long with a big patch but instead what I received was a scarf that was about 4 feet long with a small patch.
3.0,Took off a couple stars because the straps were longer than I expected and look a little strange. Might have to cut and sew it a little. Still pretty cute. Material is thick enough so it isn’t see through
3.0,cheap seams
3.0,"I returned this item because the color was closer to white than beige and I didn’t like the material.  Otherwise, it was well made."
3.0,The zipper broke on me the first time I wore it :-(  Besides that it was a cute outfit.
3.0,The look cheap.  The quality is not good for some me of them.  They Brock the third time wearing them...
3.0,"Regarding my purchase of the Manitou lightweight frameless sunglasses, I have mixed feelings. The design, look and fit of the glasses are excellent which make me want to like them a lot. However, I just can't get used to the lenses. They are too dark and the clarity is lacking. I can only wear them on very bright, sunny days and even then the vision could be better."
3.0,"Super cute, but poor quality. I expect some seams to come apart after a few washes."
3.0,"Very beautiful! Very entrancing! Buuuuuuut, it stopped ticking after 3 months! I'm so sad, it was well and great--I got the hang of winding it--and then BOOM, it just stopped. And I hardly wore it too, just to make sure I didn't scratch it up, or damage it in any way. I and the watch were doing so well...Makes me very sad, nor do I want to pay more money to get it fixed by a watchmaker. Man, this watch had much potential after seeing the overwhelming positive reviews--but hey, with a cheap watch there's bound to be cheap parts or cheap assembly. I recommend investing in a higher quality watch."
3.0,"The creases in the blouses have not come out even after washing. I will try gentle steaming, but have concerns that the fabric is too delicate.  I almost gave up on receiving these shirts, separately.Sincerely, it took a month!"
3.0,"Love the watch, but the battery was dead, now I have to buy a NEW batter, and hope that the darn watch works."
3.0,"These are a bit clunky to get on, and don't do the greatest job of noise cancelling. I bought them because my roommate likes to eat popcorn with his mouth open the whole time and it drives me nuts when we're watching TV. These things are almost perfect for that specific sound. I can still hear what's being said on TV, but the chewing noises are almost entirely blocked.<br /><br />Bonus: The slightly metallic crinkle noise you get from the speakers (not sure if everyone can hear that...) that's really high pitch? It blocks that too. If these were a bit more comfortable to wear, I'd probably just wear them all day. There's a lot of random noises (fluorescent bulb ballasts, etc.) that get blocked nicely, but people's voices are just muffled a bit. I could still hear what he was saying when we were discussing the football game we were watching.<br /><br />For the price, I'm relatively happy. If I ever need to replace these, I'll probably try something else, because of the fit issues (I have a large sized head). I'd recommend them for doing stuff like yard work with a leaf blower or something though. The way the cups adjust to different size heads leaves a lot to be desired."
3.0,The balls break after a month or so.  Had to keep replacing them.  But worked great when not broken
3.0,"I like the quality but receiver wrong color.<br />Ordered Gray but got Tan instead.<br /><br />A bit bummed out. Returning it.<br /> =(<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Company reached out to me within 24 hours after the review and sent me a &#34;correct&#34; band free of charge.<br />I say &#34;correct&#34; because the Gray color in the picture is misleading.  It looks like off black grey (what i wanted) but in reality it's more of a grey version of tan.  This is why I thought they sent me the wrong one. Turns out they sent the correct one.<br /><br />This band is very comfortable (feels lovely on the skin) but does leave marks.  If you scratch it, the scratch will stay on it (something to be expected with this type of leather).<br /><br />Would recommend if this is the color you are looking for."
3.0,Material (Silver) is very thin which makes them feel cheap. It is pretty and someone needing a budget silver necklace would really like.
3.0,"Watch looks great, but strap too long for my wrist (at shortest position).  Can't use it without replacing strap :("
3.0,Comfortable to use it i love it.
3.0,"Its a really cute bag. Not the nicest material and my zipper broke after a few uses. I still use it to carry my beach towel, snacks and book to the beach."
3.0,"I washed this product and the furry part is now falling out. It’s possible it go put in the dryer, but, I’m not sure that’s the case."
3.0,I'd hoped for a better quality of material. Its a sort of stretchy poly blend
3.0,I wore it and I'm keeping it but it's kinda cheapy looking...
3.0,"came on time but was so tangled , then it's so long and no way to adjust it it falls down in the back and reaches my butt . the piecing is cute tho , I wear it w/o the chain"
3.0,Very nicely assembled.
3.0,"I've worn this mostly in 45 to 50 degree weather.  It's fine in steady riding at a comfortable pace.  With harder effort the lining tends to hold moisture;  then if you head downhill at speed, the large under arm vents result in chilling.  The other thing I don't like is the cut is too uniform in length front and rear.  When in a typical cycling posture, the relatively bulky material bunches in the front, and the rear pockets ride so high I can barely reach into them."
3.0,"For the most part the top was cute and comfortable I love the vibrant pink color, but it's not loose at the bottom, I have big hips so it makes it difficult for it to fall loosely on the hips. Otherwise definitely not bad."
3.0,Es un cubre Bocas tipo bufanda no lo volveria comprar
3.0,"These make you look AMAZING, and shape you real well. However you can tell the material isn’t that great, and they aren’t great for working out in if you lift weights and stuff. Which I bought to workout in. I bought my size and it fit perfectly, but the first time wearing them, the back seem split open and ripped when I sat down (so squats and deadlifts are a no no) the material also isn’t breathable or comfortable for activities.<br />I bought a few pairs just to wear (outside of the gym) cause they really shape you well. So they are nice for a gym fit look but not great for strenuous activities."
3.0,I'm sorry to say you get what you pay for as this bracelet fell off my wrist as soon as I put it on. I had to get pliers to close the clasp and it fell off a few hours later. It was a very low price but I would not recommend.
3.0,Seem has ripped after only a few months use.<br />Champion Brand material was a higher quality
3.0,Cute wallet but not very roomy and the clasp is cheap
3.0,"Cute but I'm 5'7 medium to small camel toe. I wish it would of fit I tried large size and it's still giving me camel toe, wish it would of fit I love it besides that"
3.0,"Liked the gift bag that the scarf came in, and it arrived promptly. However, the blue background is so dark that the black pattern on the sheep blends in completely and you cannot tell what the pattern is."
3.0,This is a cute dress but it was pretty shear for me. It would be super cute for a swimsuit cover though. Go for a darker color and you may be okay.
3.0,The front part doesn’t adjust well.
3.0,It was supposed to have pearls & crystals  but it was all crystals. Didn't have time to send it back.
3.0,"Abnormalities with stitching (i.e. pockets), stray strings. It is not highly noticeable, and the stray strings have been cut. Shorter than expected.  Fashionable, paired with a button down shirt, with a folded collar over it. The color I love. It stands out."
3.0,I bought this dress for a dressy Christmas party and I bought the green one. I wish I’d bought the gold. The sequins are more  iridescent than solid and it gave it a mermaid feel. I’m definitely sending it back.
3.0,The gift box is super cute... the necklace itself is ok. The picture is too large for the moon so I am going to try and fix it by tightening the connecting ring.  The chain is kinda flimsy but it's for my 14 year old sister's Christmas stocking who is in love with Dr Who. Overall for the price definitely not bad.
3.0,"I wear a 36DD bra and ordered an XXL top. The top ended up being way too big. I gave it to a friend; not sure of her bra size. The top was cute, but it looks a lot cuter in person. I thought about reordering in an XL, but decided against it. I wanted to post this as a size reference; for a 36DD, an XL would have probably fit me."
3.0,not the best more for a lil kid
3.0,"The sunglasses arrived in advertised time they said it would be, when viewing the sunglasses it shows a lighter shade of grey on the web when received opening the box they are definitely was a darker grey........."
3.0,"Very comfortable and effective in muffling sound. Difficult for a child to uncurl them and put them on by themselves, however. They tend to pop apart and have to be put back together. Not sure I would buy them again."
3.0,Cute but WAYYY too small.  Not true to size.  Sent back.
3.0,They are good but very small
3.0,smaller than expected  would be great for petites or girl
3.0,Very cute But it's too tight on her arms. I don't wanna go bigger because than it will be long.
3.0,Bc it's so thin I would recommend a dark color. That way you cant see through it. You clearly see my waist beads etc. It's cute though but it feels and looks like a night shirt to me.
3.0,"After my husband’s back surgery and recovery he developed swollen ankles. Doc suggested compression socks. But the ones he provided were super difficult to put on especially if you have arthritis in your hands. So we bought these zippered socks thinking it’d be easier. Although a little easier to put on, the inside of the zipper close to the skin pinches and is uncomfortable. Next, one sock had a defective zipper that would not lock in position and would slide down his leg. Needless to say I had to return them and we immediately got a refund...thus the three stars for the seller’s immediate response."
3.0,I bought 2 wigs at the same time and this one is ok but the other one was the same price but better quality. This one gets ratty easily. I am gonna google proper wig care bc I still like it a lot. It is a good wig for the price.
3.0,I loved the product but it is smaller than expected. My arms are lucky to get through it.
3.0,"I really do like this band however, my wrist is smaller and it literally slides a bit too much for my liking. It feels comfortable otherwise I would love it if it had different sizes not just one ""overall"" or one size fits all."
3.0,Time hard to read in certain lighting conditions..should have had a light background with black numbers..I have to tilt watch a little to see time properly...backlight is ok...probably would not buy another one for this reason unless they switch color of background to light color..
3.0,"It is an undeniably lovely ring, but so incredibly small that I have to return it. The box that it came in was missing the bottom part and overall impression was very underwhelming, it didn’t math the rings I wanted to stack together:( my hand might appear larger in the photo but I wear ring sizes 5 and 6…"
3.0,"Didn't turn, but some of the gems fell out before I wore them."
3.0,"Bought this umbrella thinking it was going to be wind proof but turns out that’s not the case. It’s only a little bit of wind proof. Compare to the other windproof umbrellas there is a flap on the top that let’s wind fly through so it stay balanced but it doesn't so when the wind blows the umbrella gets pulled but the sturdiness which makes it little windproof. The technical aspect of the umbrella is great, it opens and close with ease with a click of a button"
3.0,Nice quality however pictured was all purple and what we received the back part is white and not purple as shown.
3.0,I wish this would have fit. It would have been beyond perfect for a holiday party. It was just a bit too small to not be comfortable to wear all night. I had to return it.
3.0,Was purchasing for my 2.5 yr old grandchild and it’s almost as big as she is! I exaggerate but not that much. Definitely more appropriate for an adult. Functions fine. Just the size issue for me.
3.0,"I got it somewhat large so my son can slip in and out of shoes quickly. When it got wet and sandy, it wasn't so easy to slip on and it rubbed against his heels. Nevertheless, they were quickest to dry (out of 5 different pairs we bought)."
3.0,The scarf is good quality and came as quickly as promised.  It just didn't match as well as I wanted - but not a problem with the product.
3.0,"its an okay ring, bigger than expected but i like big rings so i was okay with it, tarnish after maybe 3 days? big blue thing fell out i just glued it, cheap, prob worth like 2$ but still cute from a far i guess lol."
3.0,Replacement filters are cheap.
3.0,"Obv I didn't read the fine print but it's 1 mask only, with 5 removable filters. That said, I think it's a very nice mask - has the metal nose fitting piece, multiple layers, organic cotton, but really quite expensive imo."
3.0,"Very obviously homemade, but it was still cute"
3.0,"The sleeves do not run as long as the picture makes it seem. The material is very thin. The thumb holes are very cute though! The shape of the clothing is more square(?) than I thought, maybe because I'm not as skinny as the model. Also took a while for it to come in."
3.0,"The shirt, glasses and necklace fits well. The wig sheds and the pants have a hole in the private area. To close to Halloween party time to try and get another one."
3.0,It was very tight but i made it work. The skull came off after i danced the night away.
3.0,Fast delivery. Put product runs small
3.0,the quality is good
3.0,A bit bulky and the peacock head sticks out too much. However it is still high quality and nice overall
3.0,"I like it, my only knock is the very strong smell it gives off, I had to wipe it down to reduce the strong smell."
3.0,This jumpsuit is very cute but I have a boy and there are bows on the back pockets of it. So not really a “Boy” kind of jumper. So I gave it to a cousin that is having a girl.
3.0,Couldn’t get the elephant on the chain so I had to use an old one I had
3.0,this product is ok and came on time size is perfect but the matieral and overall look looks nothing like the picture the stars are small the matieral is silky and not like cotton like it looks. although it does not look as advertised it is an okay sweater the quality of it seems good and sizing good.
3.0,Fell apart really cheap.
3.0,very pretty just a little thin material wise
3.0,"The question is, how baggy are these pants intended to be? I wear a medium, The pants I order and as you see, are a medium though they fit like a large. Around the ankle Is too wide, you can put your boots on before your pants and have no problem shoving the boots through the bottoms, that’s a big problem"
3.0,Big for kids. I'm an adult and these feel big
3.0,The pin is beautiful but the ring to hold glasses is a little small
3.0,"Was hoping that this would last longer than it did. Second day of wearing it, one of the green caps came off and days later the other cap came off. Other than that, great  product"
3.0,"I'm on the fence.<br />I bought this to hang over the ""neck"" of the rearview mirror in my car, so the large opening and carabineer clip were a plus. The size is standard to wallet size photos--a plus. However, to the naked eye, this is a rose red--almost pink.  I wanted a dark, solid, red. The color is also translucent, not solid.  Not sure if this could survive used as advertised--as a key ring. I'm not sure what I expected for $5.<br />For the sad part, the corner of the plastic cover was broken in shipping.  A telling tale when it was in the box with a bottle of hair care product.  Probably wouldn't last an hour in a purse or clipped to a bag or suitcase.<br />For the trouble returning, I'll clip it on my mirror and see what happens.<br />Some things are not meant to be bought sight unseen even if it is only $5."
3.0,"The pants did have a good look, but they are too wide at the waist. Didn't care much for that, but it wasn't anything that a belt couldn't take care of. I ended up returning them however and for one really important reason: POCKETS. While there were deep pockets around the thigh area, there weren't any pockets in the front where you would naturally expect them to be on a pair of ""jeans"". 🤨Really? Like what's the point of having these huge deep pockets on the legs, but not in a place where you can slip your hands in them and just chill? 😒 On top of that, the back pockets weren't deep at all. You literally can't put anything bigger that a stick of gum in it. Huh??? It was quite disappointing. I really would've kept them, but pockets are super important to me because I don't carry a purse. I wish more clothing designers understood that girls love and need pockets, too! We don't ALL carry a purse, ya know.<br /><br />Aaah well. Win some... lose some. 😔"
3.0,So wanted to love this coat. Ordered a medium which turned out to be way to big. The design is shapeless  Would be more versatile if the hood was detachable.
3.0,"This is a great looking bag.  I bought the gray one.  It is a good size and the wide shoulder strap is easily adjusted.  However, the opening to the bag is very small and the lining inside is of a super-cheap material.  It has to be aired because of the bad smell.  It arrived from China fairly well packaged and came with a dust cover.  For the price you really can't beat it, I guess.  As I said, it is nice looking."
3.0,TOO SMALL FOR THE ADVERTISED SIZE
3.0,"For some they may be perfect, but my husband doesn't like the waffle  kind.  I didn't see anything stating they were waffle material.  Was surprised when the 2 pair arrived and disappointed they weren't what I thought I ordered...."
3.0,like the title says im not.. the belt is good quality.. true to the size i asked for.. Feels great.. whatever Box it is nice to.But from the other picture shown and the fact it uses the ferragomo logo you would think thats what this replica is... But its not does not say ferragomo and idk what Bullk0.. Cnt fault the seller as it was not advertise but still I would say a little false advertising .. If ur lookn for just a nice belt i would def recommend though.
3.0,"Cute design, cheaply made"
3.0,I love how these fit. Very comfortable. But they've only been washed on gentle twice and air dried and the hem is already starting to fray and come out in the waistband. They are not see through.
3.0,"My waist is small. I ordered a small. the waist size for the first wrap is fine but when pulling the sides that velcro it seems like it could have been a little longer. I mainly got this to use to help stabilize my lower back for when I do back stretching to help with focusing into upper back and not bend too much in lower back.<br />I did not opt to order a size larger because the base of the wrap fits a little bigger than my waist and I know if I size up that base size will end up being too big. The problem is the stretchy velcro part that comes from both sides that you use to do the final wrap. If they could make the side stretch over wraps just a 1/2 inch  longer that would have been better.<br />It squeezes quite strongly so I at times have to attach it more to the outsides rather than pulling it all the way to the front like in the picture.<br />I am still testing it out as I have only used it a few times.<br /><br />The base material feels interesting kind of thin, but seems constructed fine and seems to be holding up so far.<br />It definitely give that hour glass figure look when you put it on and stretch the velcro and attach it like the photo. It feels a lot like what the women might have felt when they wore the corsets in the Victorian era. This is definitely a lot easier to wear that the traditional corset.<br /><br />I have a small waist and I was shocked at how much more tiny my waist looked when I completely wrapped it, it really compresses. But it is uncomfortable and it does seem to pinch nerves and smooch organs so be careful how tight you wrap it and how long you wear it."
3.0,"Hat is not packable. I was able to get the hat reshaped, however there are still creases. I must have a powerful steamer to reshape the hat. Also the hat overall is quote a bit darker than pictured. The ribbon is a brown-ish tan. But what came is closer to a kakie color. The ribbon is only glued on. But I took it off and replace the ribbon. I would not buy again, but it's good enough to not return."
3.0,"This shirt is so cute, but material is very light so it shows through in the chest area"
3.0,The sizing is way off no way to return
3.0,"Ring was just ok. Poor quality stone, poorly finished, unpolished. Returning."
3.0,"Fits tight, uncomfortable"
3.0,So cute but they really crushed the heck out of the top off my ear. I had to them off.
3.0,"Love the fabrics used.  The neck strap only has one metal loop, needs two for grasp.  you have to tie a knot to the neck level desired."
3.0,Lost a stone pretty quickly.  Otherwise love it.
3.0,"I loved the way these looked but they broke pretty easily, not the best quality"
3.0,One of the cuffs on the 2 shirts I ordered is sewn on incorrectly.
3.0,These run short for me at 5’8” and they are tight around the belly and waist. If you want loose- order a size up!
3.0,"I purchased the red one like this with the hood, and it fits perfect. However, this grey one, fits cropped. It barely hits my waist. I'm disappointed to say the least, but it's not worth sending it back. I'll just sleep in it. I just ordered a blue and a black one. If those fit cropped, I'm definitely sending them back."
3.0,Fit is slightly smaller than expected.  Blocks sun great if fit better
3.0,"Color is quite dull, and I like vibrant."
3.0,Not really the loose fitting lounge wear as advertized. Fit more like normal pair of dress slacks would but just a little fuller in seat and upper leg. Legs tapered to point I couldn't slip pants on over slippers as most &#34;old&#34; men would ( I'm 68 and retired). Fabric is light and cool but cheap (tore part of the waist ban trying to put draw string tight) but survived washing undamaged. May order another pair as this summer's heat makes them a cool alternative to other slacks in my closet.
3.0,I had high hopes for this band as my friends love them. Unfortunately it doesn’t stay put and constantly slips off. It’s cute and well made but just doesn’t work for me
3.0,The gloves are  nice but they are too small!
3.0,"Seemed like each piece of the outfit was a different size, but maybe my son will grow into it."
3.0,Super cute wore it one time then washed it and dryed it and it SHRUNK TWO SIZES!!! so for FUTURE FYI don't dry it. lol
3.0,this is just ok..
3.0,Pedi talla xl y parecía de bebé venía demasiado pequeño y tuve que ponerle otro disfraz a mi hijo
3.0,The product worked well but was made poorly. My small framed 10 yr old broke them soon after we bought them. The metal wire holding the head frame to the ear muff broke taking them from his book bag.
3.0,The bag was inexpensive so I can't really say too many bad things. The fake little diamonds at the top instantly started to fall off. I just super glued them which is super tacky but you can't even tell. The bag is a nice size and has lasted me a few months. Basically you get what you pay for.
3.0,"Fits well, however the fabric is very thin/lightweight."
3.0,bought 3x and still too small im not that big of a girl but not skinny either gave to my 11 year old granddaughter
3.0,The braiding on the front looks cheap.
3.0,I like the hat but I'll have to return it. It is WAY too big even with tightening the back. I'm so sad. :(
3.0,Pretty but the posts bent and weren't sturdy at all.
3.0,Big but cute would love a smaller pair same style
3.0,"I'm a pretty consistent 36E, and ordered the mulberry 36E. The cups fit great and are very comfortable, but the band size is no bigger than a 34, maybe even a 32.  I'd order a 38E if I buy again.<br /><br />It is cute on, though, and is very supportive and uplifting for a bralette -- I really like the silhouette."
3.0,Good thing is it's small. And it doesn't slip. But the material is the shimmery fabric which makes my skin itchy badly.
3.0,"The belt is not made of high quality leather, instead it feels &#34;plasticky.&#34;  I also should have taken out my ruler to compare the stated width of this belt to my others, as it is narrower.  I mostly wear dress chinos and the belt loops on the pants are relatively wide, the result being this belt is not a good fit.  Oh well."
3.0,These shorts are very thin material and run small compared to USA sizing. The pink color is basically completely see through. I would recommend ordering a size up
3.0,"This item puts off great heat, when it decides to actually turn on. Could have a daulty unit, but it will go off on it's own, or take a few tries to long press to turn on. This vest runs small, I ordered a size up and I would've been better off ordering twos sizes up."
3.0,I like everything about this purse except the front part.  It tears when you put your keys in the front part.  So I hand stitched the holes.  I only have 2 keys on my key ring so that part made me sad. 😢
3.0,"Good color,  runs slightly short unable to tie in the front. I have 2 other belts exact same style different material and I am able to easily wrap around and tie in the front. I just tied a bow in the back.  Good color"
3.0,I received this product in the mail and it was a little bit too large. I ordered a size large because usually I'm a size 6 and I thought this would run a little small so I thought a 6 to 8 which is what a large is supposed to be you would fit perfectly. As you can see in the picture the bottoms are way too big after I put them on there is a lot of  sagging in the butt area so there's no way I could wear this in the pool or on the beach. However the top fit I probably could've just went with a medium and been fine. So I don't think you need to order a size up just really order a size and maybe slightly smaller than what your sizes usually end that would work for you I'm not sure if the factory is inconsistent with making the product  because I've heard other people say that they've ordered two sizes up the mend their medium there or in extra-large there's no way I would even fit an extra large and there's Levi mediums when I go shopping at Nordstrom or forever 21 so I thought a large would been fine. The top will do for now on I can mix-and-match my bottoms that I already have it's OK the quality isn't spectacular by any means but you are getting  what you pay for so I guess he can't expect the best quality anyway. I did purchase this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Is the price that it is now I think it would be worth it to purchase it because if you want to target you'd probably spend about $15 which is more than this whole suit on just one piece so just depends what you like and if you like this design I really was into the high neck top so that was mainly why I got it in the first place
3.0,"Nice fit, decent looking and keeps feet reasonably warm. BUT terrible heel cushion!! I will get heel gel pads."
3.0,Fabric is very shiny and seems kinda cheap.
3.0,"I am a little disappointed because there were no comfortable black ring around the ankle top thingy and when it rubs, it tear my skin. I haven't use it since I brought it because I need to find a place to put on to protect that."
3.0,The fabric is a little rough. It's a good value.
3.0,"I like the buckle clasp and the color. It doesnt fit flush to the watch but not so much to make a big deal. It would not clip into my watch face no matter what I did. The plastic clips looked and felt cheap. I switched out the clips from the original samsung band and it snapped in perfectly and felt snug. However, I shouldn't have to do this for the product to work. Otherwise, it would be defective and returned."
3.0,"Cute, but came pretty wrinkly"
3.0,Very cute :) the sizing is a little off because the leaf and heart fit only my middle finger or index but the plein rings are too big and fit mostly as regular rings. Other than that no complaints.
3.0,Do not like the color.
3.0,It was ok looks better in the picture but cheaper looking than expected. But for the price couldn't expect quality to be all that good
3.0,Nice glasses but came out scratched. I think it’s used 😒
3.0,"This is for a child.  I wanted for a pinky ring and I wear it, but it's smaller than the picture appears and the price trick on the page wasn't appreciated either. (costs less til you click for the size..and mines a 5..but the price more than doubled). Kinda sleazy to do that."
3.0,The fit is very very small. I ordered this for mt daughter. Since the description said mens I ordered a small. She likes big tshirts. When I opened it I thought I ordered a youth size in error. Also it smelled TERRIBLE!!!!!
3.0,This fits true to size. The color was nice. I didn't like how thin it was. If the color was any lighter it would have been see through.
3.0,It ok but the sleeves is shortened despite that I bought a 3XL for some that wear an L. I will keep it because i have the option to slide the sleeve up.
3.0,They aren’t as bright blue colored in person as they are in the photo
3.0,"I love this purse!! It is big and stylish, love the look of this i would tell everyone to get it"
3.0,Bought for a wedding - it shows all and needs tape to keep from complete slipping off
3.0,"Not bad, it took some time to get here. The adjustment belt on this gloves isn't the best."
3.0,its 'okay. great for the font. but I was hoping for the full helmet. does anyone out there know how to turn off the lights? and knows any about the shadow  trooper helmet? can I put the back of that one to this mask?
3.0,XL is more like a medium. I couldn't even get it past my thighs. Would not recommend.
3.0,"I ordered before realizing that the shipping would take so long (you get what you pay for)...  The dress came in one day before the day I wanted to wear it and I had already bought a replacement - and then it was much smaller than expected, and I  purchased 2x larger than I wear!  I gifted it to my sister and she loves it. Yay for her."
3.0,Slide off your heels when walking.
3.0,"This shirt fit well and is very comfortable. However, I thought it was a lot brighter in color than the picture shows."
3.0,"Now, let me preface that i loveeee kingdom hearts. Big nerd here. So when i saw these bracelets i had to buy them. They're so beautiful. However, i wore them twice and of which, the ""beware the heartless"" bracelet is stretched out and wont hold closed. Now, i can be a little rough however, i was very delicate with it and it broke as well as the heart bracelet. I'm giving it 4 stars because i really do love this bracelet set, but it just broke to quick =["
3.0,like it. dont love it but it gets in my rotation about once a month or every other month.
3.0,I didn't get exactly what was pictured but they are cute.
3.0,"I love these pants, but I washed them (based on the instructions) and they ripped in the wash? Not sure what happened but I did really like these pants"
3.0,"I was looking to replace the Kickback sunglasses I lost and came across these.  It's a pain when you're riding at dusk with sunglasses on and there is no convenient place to pull over, so I thought these would be perfect.  Unfortunately, they don't get dark enough.  At their darkest, the lenses have what I would call a fashion tint.  They're OK except for really bright sunshine and glare.  Unfortunately, that's exactly what I need sunglasses for.  Love the frames, not crazy about the lenses.<br /><br />I think Kickbacks are the best sunglasses deal on the Internet.  They are rugged, the lenses don't scratch easily, are comfortable worn with a helmet (a rare quality in motorcycle glasses), and they fit my thin nose bridge.  These would be great on an overcast day or at dusk when you're not riding into the sun.  I'm going to make them my night glasses.<br /><br />12/7/13 Update:<br />I actually use these glasses a lot.  They don't replace my sunglasses, but on overcast days, at dusk, or at night, they are great.  Better than clear lenses."
3.0,"It's kind of an off white instead of bright white. I got the large and it's almost too big. I'm 5'2 and 128 lbs. I didn't feel bad washing it though because I was hoping it would shrink (yet to be determined). The thing that made me give it only 3 stars is the material. Feels cheap. Like polyester. Not soft at all. But does look like the photo, minus color. And for the price, eh why not."
3.0,I've rarely wear it and have already lost a stone. I never get it wet. The black hasn't chipped at all and i love it so losing the stone is upsetting.
3.0,"I thought that these were compression type tanks for working out, but they are very light weight and unsupportive.  You definitely have to put some type of sports bra on with this!  I ware them as t-shirts."
3.0,It’s ok. It’s kinda cheaply made but ehh
3.0,It’s so cute! However...... it’s not really a sweatshirt nor is it a long sleeved shirt. It’s kind of in between if that makes any sense. The hole for the head is small and the body of the shirt is big but the elastic at the bottom is tight. I bought it for my daughter who is in 12- 18 months. I ordered 18-24 months so it could be a little bit big and it was long in the arms and had to be folded at the end. The stomach was baggy like I wanted but the bottom was tight around her waist. And she’s on the smaller size of a one year old.
3.0,It was sooooo tiny. It's hard to assess the quality because it was too small to wear.
3.0,It was a good comfortable piece but it was too big over all. Should have gotten a size smaller possibly
3.0,Thought it would be a little bit loose not fit to body
3.0,"Sizes are too small. If your size is S, consider order M or even L. I was not able to use it. The fabric is good quality."
3.0,Does its job for dressing up
3.0,"They are comfortable for everyday wear, but they dont seem to breath very well. at least in 120 degree temps, also the neck and shoulders tend to ride up. I have lost about 20 pounds since i bought these shirts and they  still ride up. Might just be my build but I do not find these comfortable for working out in so I will be donating mine to someone else."
3.0,"We did not receive the lanyard.  The steering wheel cover is great though.  I am just one that if it's suppose to come with it, it should."
3.0,"Nice, worth the money, I would have liked it bigger for what I was looking for. But good, nothing wrong with it. Good quality."
3.0,"I got this in the green with the red buffalo plaid pattern. The quality and material were about what I expected for the low price but the fit was just off.  I can’t even say “runs large” or “runs small” because it was all over the place.<br /><br />The chest was kinda tight (I do not have a large chest and most times I’m wearing a sports bra). The sleeves fit well and were comfortable.  The real problem is at the bottom. The pictures included in the listing show a darker trim that hangs loosely.  This trim is more like elastic and hits right below my jeans and makes the whole shirt poof out around the waist. It made me look 3 x wider in the waist and overall, gave me an odd silhouette.<br /><br />I never wore it in public, but put it on several times wanting to wear it out because I really liked the style of it.  I ultimately took it off because it made me feel really insecure about my shape."
3.0,Super dark lenses. My daughter doesn't like wearing them because they're so dark.
3.0,I’m 5’7” 155 I have a hard time finding pants that aren’t too long . Bought these in medium. They fit well butThe zippers broke  and holes appeared after just a few washes.
3.0,"I knew it was a risk.  It always is, buying things from China. My biggest fear is that is would be small, as their sizing is way smaller than American sizes.  I ordered an Xl.  Thinking it would equal a Med. Nope, its true to size, so its bigger than I wanted. Still wearable though and longer..but I'm super small, 4'11&#34;.<br />I thought this piece would be more like the now trendy kimonos. It is in fabrib, light, seems good quality.  Print isn't what I expected, similar, but different looking. So here's the weird part, there are no closed parts. No armholes.  The front panels are just that, panels that drape down. I'm not sure how I feel about it. I think I will stitch it together to make armholes and it will work. I could have found something better for cheaper at places like Ross."
3.0,"Likes: the look. Best looking watch of my collection. Compliments. Low price.<br />Dislikes: Poor Chinese quality, band locking pin came off quickly, rendering watch unusable and unrepairable. Returned."
3.0,Nice looking watch can be a little hard to see in low light. The winding doesn't last that long expect to wind it pretty much every day. Also the other dials are not really functional one mimics the second hand and the others move when you click the top and bottom buttons I don't really get what those would be used for. When I bought it I thought they'd act like a stopwatch. There are no instructions. It's alright for the price though.
3.0,"My daughter is a size 10 and they fit beautifully.  Unfortunately, the back stud area cuts into the top of her heel a bit and there isn't much in the way of padding on the insole, so they aren't great for long walking or lots of standing, but they definitely make a statement and the finish is very nice.  She wears them often, just not for long periods.  :)"
3.0,I can barely get the earring over my bottom lobe to insert in my piercing. Extremely small and delicate. But I do really like them.
3.0,"Its very light, it was adorable but the sizes run very small."
3.0,"You get what you pay for. It's a cute dress, yes. But it's literally a piece of fabric that has a ribbon on the top so you can tie it together. At least it's hymned. You could make this yourself no problem. Very very sheer, you'll need something under it or stay out of the sun at all costs."
3.0,Thin but as advertised...
3.0,The metal of piercing was bit bigger than expected.
3.0,None of the bracelets have charms as in the photo just beads on string.
3.0,"I am having a cost versus quality issue here. These glasses cost $350, when they arrived I was shocked that they both look and feel like a pair of $15 glasses from the local gas station. The effect they give is ok… but I am just stuck on the quality of the build and design. Just off those quality issues alone, even if I absolutely LOVED the effect, which again is just ...ok, I could not in good conscience keep these glasses for that price. I can’t say enough how in disbelief I am at the quality of the build and design? What were you thinking?"
3.0,ESTA BLUSA ESTA BONITA SOLO TENER EN CUENTA QUE LAS MANGAS CORREN CHICAS A MI ME QUEDO APRETADO TENGO BRAZOS MEDIO GRUESOS PERO EL SISE SMALL QUEDA BIEN .
3.0,"Bought these shades to see how well the classic design would fare on my head before investing in a pair of Ray-Ban Clubmasters. I fell in love with these the moment I took them out of the package. The glasses themselves looked amazing and felt durable, despite the completely plastic body (maybe even the &#34;glass&#34; itself). Over the weeks, the frames began getting extremely flimsy and the &#34;glass&#34; or whatever it may be, got covered in scratches. There is no UV protection whatsoever, so these will do a number on your vision after extended wear. If you're a person that hates to be called out on, do NOT buy these, as everybody that sees these will call them fake.. or my personal favorite; &#34;swap meet Ray-Bans&#34;. If you only care about looks, these are the sunglasses for you. If durability, feel, (and branding) is important to you, save the $10 for a pair of Ray-Bans...you won't regret it."
3.0,I have a tropical Christmas tree every year so I used this as my tree skirt.  It was thin and very sparse
3.0,Pretty and soft fabric but longer than I would like so I returned. I’m 5’2 and it hit the bottom of my knee.
3.0,This is a Christmas gift for my son bc he loves this show but it's definitely not a hoodie. It's really thin. So I hope he likes it and maybe can use it when it's not too cold outside.
3.0,These are not sweatpants. The material is more like a thin pajama material. I’m 5’9” and the pants are a little short for me. Would like them better if they were a couple of inches longer. The elastic in the waist and ankles is a little tight (I’m thin and bought the Medium). I still wear them but they were not what I expected. Quality is decent.
3.0,"This dress is very low cut.  I purchased a medium from the reviews and chart however, I'm a 34 D and this dress didn't cover my chest at all.  I could have kept it and wore a cami under it but I didn't want that look.  Very pretty dress but better for a smaller chest."
3.0,Does not contain the 613 fringe.
3.0,Size up people. Cute shirt though
3.0,"The product itself is Def on the look at shinny metal which is good but at the same time it kept pinching my skin for the one day I had it, unfortunately I had to take it back due to that and it did not come with the ring."
3.0,Nice watch but if you have sensitive skin it will break your wrist out with rash but other then that good watch
3.0,"Super cute, nice balance between firm and flexible but unfortunately the odor of this makes it all but unable to be worn. The size is larger than expected but I like to allow a belt to drape now and then so that was perfect...what isn't perfect is the odor. It's been chemically treated or something...really not sure what but it simply reeks."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:a0f8a1082522ced51e413a38412ba498]] The belt is missing! And is too large. I bought S size… I’m sad I really liked.
3.0,Don't really care too much for the material and the way it feels.
3.0,Small.. Hard to snap closed with just a few cards in it.
3.0,The hat is too small.  My 3yr. old grandson will be out of it soon.  He is tall and slim.
3.0,"These were a lot shorter and thinner than I expected. I didn't return then because I hate the hassle, but I did end up donating them because I knew I'd never wear them myself."
3.0,"It’s cool, but it’s too big to wear as a necklace. I think I’ll keep it on the wall."
3.0,It’s nice didn’t realize I had to size it myself and then it just kept getting loose.
3.0,"Very cute! Not durable tho, the loop on the band broke off after a day of wearing it and the band seems to be going as well, it's very thin."
3.0,Not much to like
3.0,"I was disappointed because I bought this for my mother for Christmas, and they were too small."
3.0,"I ordered a large as recommended, I'm 5' 7"" at 175 lbs.  With this size on me the arms are to small. I would not be able to wear any base layers for skiing."
3.0,"Great bag.  However, 2 flaws:<br />1.  The shoulder strap should be removable.  It's not.<br />2.  The inside pouch flops around, gets in the way when you're loading, unloading.  I took mine to a shoe-repair shop and had them stitch in velcro to keep it out of the way.  Good fix, but cost $25."
3.0,Fabric was very nice and top seemed well made.  the sizing is way off. I ordered 2x but this top is more like 4x and comes halfway to my knees.
3.0,"My younger child is a big fan of the TMNT so I checked out this Costume set.<br /><br />What's cool:<br />Includes Red bandana/mask with eyeholes close together, decent size plastic turtle shell with strap (will fit most children ages 4-6) and holsters for weapons, 2 rounded Sai (Ninja) daggers, and 2 round Shuriken/throwing stars.<br />No sharp edges on any of the plastic components.<br />Looks cool.<br /><br />What's uncool:<br />Thin nylon strap for the turtle shell rather than the thicker webbed strap shown on product listing.<br />$26.99 seems rather overpriced for a generic plastic+fabric Halloween costume.  The current inflation is getting out of hand."
3.0,Overall was a cute top. It was slightly more snug than I had wanted.
3.0,"This has the same problems as most pushups. Pushes your boobs up too much without good support, so you just fall out of the bra every time you bend over. Also doesn't look completely natural, and not very comfortable. I'm always a 34C, but this is too small. Too tight and the loosest hooks. It is super cute though."
3.0,"I like the pants, they are comfy but they were tight getting on at first. Do not go bigger, they will be too big it you do. I do not think they flattened my tummy as suggested. I love the feeling of the material and the pocket placement. But I have other leggings that really flatten my tummy."
3.0,Tight under the arms - prefer not to have the elastic
3.0,"At first I loved these socks.  They are probably the most comfortable socks I've worn in desert combat boots.  Unfortunately, as one other reviewer noted, they shrank after the first wash.  Fortunately for me, my wife is also a Marine and she just inherited two pair of my socks...  She loves them.  Meanwhile, I am out two pair of what I thought were great socks..."
3.0,Shirt shrank when washed. Good thing I am somewhat petite. Otherwise an average height woman would end up with a top that comes close to being a crop top. Otherwise cute in color and style.
3.0,"Super cute, as pictured. I ordered a size up since I like a bit if room and glad I did."
3.0,"This is a very cute, lightweight summer nightgown. It fits well except the shoulder straps are kind of short making the arm holes tight and uncomfortable. I'm going to try to alter it by adding material to the straps but the manufacturer should address the design flaw."
3.0,It's not super high quality and it's a bit &#34;Trucker&#34; shape in the front.  But other than that it's a good hat subtle hint..........
3.0,"They were too big!!! I’m a 12, and I think I got the XL . Size down one. The material wasn’t real denim, it was thin and very stretchy. They weren’t for me."
3.0,The design is beautiful and the material is durable but the color started peeling. I wear them everyday for a couple of months.
3.0,"Nice socks, but way too small for a man"
3.0,My friend loved this but it is extremely fine print and hard to read - even when you know what it says.
3.0,"The dress is very cute, however I am 5'4 and i weight 180. I am small from the top. I am small C cup and i got a medium size. I had such a hard time to zip of the dress was off by maybe half inch. the top of the dress is to big if your not that big from the breast area."
3.0,"This swimsuit is adorable, but it can be pretty incomfortable. The padding in the top piece is very firm and round. It feels a bit strange, but gets the job done.  The bikini is a bit tight around the legs and can become irritating if wearing the swimsuit all day. Not, honestly for the price, I can't complain too much."
3.0,"Pretty good. Doesnt get too hot compared to other beanies on a sunny day. However, too expensive."
3.0,I kept reading these run small. I ordered my daughters usual size and they are very big. She won’t be able to wear these for some time.
3.0,"meh. material feels pretty nice but the sizing is weird. its tight is some areas and loose in other areas. the collar starts too low and goes up too high and kinda folds in... i will probably be altering the collar. the buttons stop pretty high up, witch is accurately represented in the picture but when i put it on it seems a little odd. just meh."
3.0,"Very well made, but if you have a small wrist like me then prepare for it to fall off once there is no band on it. Also it was hard to get a rubber band on there with only one hand since you have to wrap the band around there 2x which is hard to see from the picture."
3.0,The pattern was irritating to my skin.
3.0,"I love this BUT it has many flaws but because I need a purple suit, I will make it work.<br />1. You can't remove the pads from the bra and if you hate pads like me, this sucks.<br />2. I'm 4'10 and this fits a bit long on me but luckily for me, my momma raised me to be efficient so I will be fixing that by removing some fabric from the panties area<br />3. The strings are too long in the bra area. I bought a small but I'm sure a med sized person can fit into the bra- I will be fixing that too.<br />4. The sides of the suit stick out, but it's because it's a bit large on me, I will have to cut the length of the strings in the back as well.<br />It's a really nice suit, looks just like the picture but it's a bit big for me.<br />I'm 4'10<br />Weigh 130lbs<br />Size: s/m - 5/6 in jeans"
3.0,"It's really cute, but it's absolutely tiny. I wear a size 6 ring on my ring finger and if I stretch this to fit it seems to be in peril of falling off. It fits on my pinky, so I will keep it, but I wouldn't suggest this for anyone over a size 5 ring."
3.0,I dislike the fabric but my girls love it!
3.0,So so quality.
3.0,Very flimsy. Does the job but I don’t see them lasting very long.
3.0,I think if you want the top to fall off the shoulders as advertised then go up 2 sizes ! Otherwise it’s for fitting but that’s cute too !!<br />I was not expecting material to be so thin and clingy as well as see through . I think this one will be a lounging outfit for date night
3.0,"Rise was too low. A review mentioned they were high rise so I bought them. They’re not high rise they’re low rise. I ordered a size 3 and has a perfect fit, but it has an 8” rise and that’s too low for me. I’m returning them"
3.0,"I like the look of these overalls, but the sizes run huge!  I bought these for my 10 year old Granddaughter and decided to go one size up because she sometimes wears 11/12, but I should have ordered true to size, a size 10.  Will save them for when she grows into them though."
3.0,Good luck with the hasp!
3.0,The green string came broken which was unfortunate since I specifically purchased this set for the green lanyard.
3.0,Very pretty. really heavy. Won't stay clasped
3.0,Worked great and fit comfortable for about 3 months . Then the leather started to tear and &#34;break&#34; where the clasp/teeth grip the belt . so it's just another cheap junk belt . kinda pissed .
3.0,This was worth the $9.99 I paid for it. Certainly not worth $19.99 that it was originally listed for. I am glad I got it at the discount
3.0,When I received it one of the earrings were broken so I could not wear it
3.0,"I like it, but don't love it. The color and cut are pretty. However, the material is so thin that you can see bra lines and it wrinkles super easily!"
3.0,Very cute but the charms fall off very easily
3.0,The shirt was much longer than expected and the pants were too small. Material was good quality.
3.0,"Absolutely loved this dress, except it was too big! I ordered a SMALL & I'm 5'4&#34; 105lbs and it hung on me. I loved the green color though. I wish it came in an XS because I would totally get it in the smaller size."
3.0,Great quality.  But my 46 inch waist couldn’t get this pulled up past my thighs.
3.0,a bit too scratchy on my back but do the job
3.0,"These are very pretty, but they are absolutely HUGE!  I wish that there had been one of those silhouettes with the earrings on it so that I could have seen how large they really are.  The colors are true to the picture on-screen, and they are very pretty.  I just don't know that I'm going to feel comfortable wearing such big earrings.  I'm 5'1&#34; so I tend to try to keep my earrings in proportion to my height.  I have a long neck which allows me to wear dangling earrings and looks nice in them, but the ones I wear are narrower than these are; the picture doesn't show the true proportions of length to width of these earrings.  Nevertheless, I shall keep them, try them out at least once and see how I look in them.  Luckily I have long hair that is in large curls, and it is cut back slightly before the ears to show off earrings that I wear.  If my hair was short, I think these would look ridiculous on ME.  On someone else who is taller, they might be fine with short hair.  Just be ready for them to be large."
3.0,Gave them to a friend. I thought I ordered a med but what I got was S/M.........
3.0,The cages are beautiful but you have to use small pearls or they won’t close.
3.0,Arrived with a stone off. I will need to glue it back on. Glad all the pieces were in the packaging.
3.0,it's a good cosplay just it came as a large and i ordered medium
3.0,I ordered a 3 as my daughter wears a 2 so she would have room. They just fit with no extra room. That being said they are pretty and well made. Just won't be able to wear them as long as I had planned.
3.0,Runs small...one size does not fit all.
3.0,"Nice enough, but straps are flimsy."
3.0,Muy bien para ninos.  Para adultos muy pequeno
3.0,Loved but zipper kept sticking and then broke and cannot return  I don’t want refunded just would like another pay
3.0,"They didn’t stick, can I return the second one I didn’t use"
3.0,too small . size 7 was too small. may have been wrong sizing
3.0,"It's a trendy and cute bag in person! The scarf is a nice touch and comes packaged like a luxury bag. It looks just like the listing. My only complaint is that it smelled like chemicals, was very rigid and its logo was literally screenprinted onto the bag. It would make sense if it was a name brand but the lettering was a bit too large for me."
3.0,Item received was not the item pictured.
3.0,It was a 71/2 instead of the 10 it should have been. It looks better in the photo
3.0,I ordered extra large and it is an &#34;iffy fit&#34;
3.0,"It may keep my arm warm, especially if the weather demands it.  But I was looking for more compression and it has none.  I'm keeping it because it is inexpensive and it may come in handy in the next snow storm."
3.0,Not that great. I returned it. The quality was very basic
3.0,They are cute glasses but they are so wide. Like not flexible arms or anything they just are meant for someone with a big head....which I have and they are still big. They fall off my face if I look down.
3.0,Very pretty. But stones fell out in a week!
3.0,"2 minutes after trying this skirt on, one of the buttons popped off. I hadn’t even worn it out yet."
3.0,"I liked the look of this watch, but was surprised when I opened it -- I guess I didn't pay enough attention to the dimensions in the description, because this watch is sized more like a man's watch than a women's.  The case is almost 2 inches wide.  Not what I wanted at all, so I'm sending it back."
3.0,"Don't like it, it was way to big"
3.0,Have it for an everyday carry back or a vehicle back. Not bad since its just 20 bucks. Shoulder straps arent sowed to the backpack so you need to pull them tight from time to fine. Will be sowing them to the bag when i get a moment. Ok for what i wanted. You get what you pay for.
3.0,You will need some alterations if you want to look like as the sample in the picture. The material is not soft and I don’t know what that is.
3.0,Cute but broke the first day. I was able to glue the part back on.
3.0,I didn't realize that it would be SO SMALL when I ordered it.  It's not even as big as a dime.
3.0,They are not polarized
3.0,Writing is very small and very hard to read.
3.0,There wasn't really anything wrong with the product it was just a little small for my normal 10-11 pant size
3.0,Cute bag but not a lot of space.
3.0,"I was sent the wrong dress but decided to try it on anyway to see how it fit. I bought an XL. Everything fit fine except for the split came right up the middle, stopping at the crotch. I thought it would be a side split. Nonetheless, the dress was returned."
3.0,Cute style like ray bans and it bended quick just for few days of use.
3.0,"I want to say that the product itself is good and good quality for the price, I would've given it a 4 stars, however, the smell was discussting! It reaked liek a dead rat was packaged together with it! I had to wash it twice on heavy duty settings in order to get the smell out.."
3.0,"The product look like it came straight from China, without even being repackaged. They sent me the wrong size, and unfortunately Amazon no longer lets me return it. The gloves are comfortable but not nearly the quality that was promised."
3.0,"Feels and looks cheap, however, it was."
3.0,Its a cute little bracelet but the heart broke off within a week.
3.0,"Doesn’t come up as high in the back as I would like, but I’ll keep it."
3.0,It was somewhat cheaply made. Expected same quality as found in Scotland
3.0,The dress was a bit large for me. I am a 38DD and the top was big. I have never had this issue. Ended up returning. Originally bought for a Gala at work.
3.0,"Super cute, but they're not stretchy at all like I thought they would be. I think because of that they were a bit itchy and I haven't been able to wear them longer than how long it took me to try them on. But I am also pregnant, my skin is sensitive and am willing to give these another try when I'm back to &#34;normal&#34;."
3.0,The dress is sheer. Purchased for graduation but the fit and material were not as expected. Went with a different dress. Cute style. Would probably have to wear with a slip.
3.0,"This purse was ok the internet picture did not show the yellow stitching and it did not say that there was no zipper across the top, it did not say there was a snap enclosure"
3.0,little different from the picture..they arent as &#34;3D&#34; or detailed but still cute
3.0,No cotton liner was the only complaint
3.0,"The dress is very cute but just not made for taller girls. I’m 5’11 and though it does reach the ground, the way it hits on your waist makes you look pregnant. Not exactly a flattering look for someone who doesn’t have kids or will have them anytime soon! If you are shorter than my height, it’ll look better but it just didn’t fit me right"
3.0,Good material and pretty color but this was not a form fitted design like most tennis dresses. Also runs big. I sent it back.
3.0,This is very pretty but it broke after just a few days..
3.0,"Worked for my Daphne costume for halloween, but arrived with a hole at a shoulder seam, and the waist seam is loose and a little crooked. Wouldn't buy from this company again for clothes I actually plan to wear, but my costume turned out well."
3.0,Cute and my Acer chrome book fits well. Wish it had a carrying handle though. :-(
3.0,"For some reason I expected this to look really classy but when it arrived I thought it looked a little cheap.  Although, the appearance is on key with the price so I shouldn't be surprised.  Nonetheless I've worn it a couple of times and every time I get at least one compliment on it."
3.0,A little bigger then expected but otherwise it's ok
3.0,Really liked the look but felt the shoe was too restricting on my foot. The footbed was narrow for me and I generally wear medium width shoes.
3.0,Sizes run small but cute shirt
3.0,"Rus, tooooo small"
3.0,"I didn't care for the color.  When I got it in it just looked more like a faded old shirt.  Also, the fabric isn't my favorite.  Again, it just looked old and it was brand new.  Wonder if it is just the color choice?"
3.0,The shirt was decent quality but runs extremely small.
3.0,The problem with this mask (dark purple) is the outside pinning. It is white. So it does not look nice.  I also ordered the #C and it was great. I would suggest to order the ones with the black boarder.
3.0,Love the hat love the quality of the Hat but one of the letters was not stitch as good as the others. I really really did not want to return it.
3.0,I did think the charm would be smaller and dainty but it’s nice anyway
3.0,"I really do think these look glamorous. But they just fit bulky, especially around the waist/torso. Would have been difficult to pair it with a top I felt. I returned them. Maybe I'll order a small sometime. But I felt that they were cheaply made for the price... So maybe not."
3.0,"This gown was super heavy, and I hated the thickness of the straps. I took off the seams at the top so that the straps would thin out, but I'm still not a huge fan. If you're looking for something more weighted, this gown would be a good choice."
3.0,"Very pretty belly button rings but the first day I wore one, the chain broke off and I lost half the piece."
3.0,"the bra was fine and fit ok. the pants look very small but are actually very stretchy. I though they sent me KIDS pants at first. On they were pretty comfy if not a bit tight still around the tummy. also, very see through since they are stretched so much! I don't wear the pants anymore except at home, but the bra i still like and the colors are great and as expected."
3.0,They are good looking however they do get caught on and pull out fabric from the tie. Must be very careful with them on expensive ties.
3.0,"quality is good<br />usually, I wear L size however L was too large so I returned and bought M<br />for M size shirt fits very well but trouser is very lose considering I wear 36/38<br />I wish it wd hv come with a string to adjust waist size<br />value for money"
3.0,The colors are really pretty and material is nice. The shorts were tiny for a medium.
3.0,runs very small more for a x small or small woman
3.0,"these leggings are nice and soft,but I will not wear them out in public.Best worn as pajama pants.I kept them only for lounging around in the house"
3.0,"These are very large earings, the stone colors are vibrant."
3.0,good but very cheap
3.0,The material wasn't exactly what I expected it's not soft
3.0,It is a lovely design.  The quality is not as nice as I would have liked.  The buckle came off before I even wore it.  I was able to reattach it easily enough.  I would have paid more for the belt to have nicer crystals/rhinestones.
3.0,"You aren’t wearing this costume for its warmth or thickness. Costume looks good, if you are expecting one pizza slice. Icon used is deceptive."
3.0,"average quality, I don't know, but seemed too flimsy for longjohns, can't tell you, kids haven't worn them yet"
3.0,They roll up and are slippery
3.0,These are comfortable socks but definitely not tie dyed.  I like true tie dye so these are disappointing.
3.0,"Love the colors, wish the band was a bit thicker or not have the elastic. The waist band has a 1&#34; elastic band inside the material so not a true fold over waist like I had thought. I ordered an xl but am normally a size 12 it fits small on me."
3.0,"unique looking, but the gold finish is cheap looking, but it was only $40.00 you get what you pay for"
3.0,Cute jeans but a mid rise 18 seems to fit more like a low rise 14
3.0,This was a cute top but it was shorter than I expected in the front and looked kind of unflattering where it hit me at the hips. I ended up returning it.
3.0,It was cheap fabric and after a few weeks it gave me an allergic reaction but it was expected to be a cheap material the prize  explains
3.0,Very delicate and closure must be handled with great care.  The end ball came off on first use.  It was left off without any consequence.
3.0,"The hat is a bit flimsy, but good for the price."
3.0,Can't beat this for the money
3.0,"Unfortunately for me this shacket is quite itchy and when you receive it I'd suggest throwing it the dryer on air dry to get off all the lint if you're not going to wash it straight away. Maybe the initial washing will take away all of the itchiness, idk. Will come back and update review if I remember.<br /><br />Besides the itchiness this shacket fits like I thought it would on my 5'1"" 115 lb frame (I got the Small size in ""Red""). It's like a flannel boyfriend shirt or an oversized women's flannel shirt. It has that relaxed and just-rolled-out-of-bed-but-put-together look. Also the material is not thick like standard flannel but a bit thinner and the exterior of the shacket feels like a brushed fabric to make it softer. Hopefully the softness will carry through after a machine wash.<br /><br />It has one pocket on the front chest though I wish it had some side pockets too but normally button down shirts don't have those so... :(<br /><br />Overall satisfied with this shacket but I'm not sure if I would buy this again since it's itchy. We'll see if it goes away in time.<br /><br />Also colors are accurate - I received the ""Red"" variant and it looks just like the product photos."
3.0,It’s a bit small and cheap for the price point.
3.0,Shoulder straps and upper edging clearly appear white in the posted images. The ties on the sides of the top appear bright/neon yellow. The shoulder straps and upper edging are in fact bright/neon yellow. Disappointing.
3.0,"Fit was okay, but everything that touched it,  would snag. Now just a sleepshirt👻"
3.0,I wanted to love this dress...didnt.
3.0,I'm a guy and the band looks girly on the watch
3.0,"the product is nice and can hold many bracelets and necklaces i just wish it were taller so that my necklaces would not drag, but it's a nice piece"
3.0,"I expected that they would be all metal, but some of the materials are plastic.  This is disappointing, as I plan to have my prescription lenses put in these frames.  However, other than that, they are pretty nice."
3.0,"It's not the best quality, but good enough for wearing a couple times. We bought it for our ring bearers for the wedding so it worked out since they were only wearing it for a day : )"
3.0,"Cute, reasonably-priced glasses. Unfortunately, they break easily."
3.0,"This would have been  adorable if the sizing was t way off. I am 5’1”, 143lbs, 34C and bottom heavy. I can wear a medium or large depending on the bust or armholes. But never an xlarge. This maybe would fit as an xl. I’m annoyed cause I’m leaving in a few days for a trip and it was supposed to go with. I won’t be reordering though because on the front was an end knot on the outside of thread. Made it look horrible. And the bust pulls the seam down on the shoulders making it look offset. And the ties aren’t double sided as they should be so it’s white on the inside which looks awful when in a bow."
3.0,They where s littl on the thin fabric sided and the waist was on the wide side. Over all I think some ladies could pull these off. I am just not one of them. I bought a L and I am 5'7 and around 147lbs. Fit as expected.
3.0,Cute but tore after one wear
3.0,Very comfortable but the picture makes it look a lot thicker than it is. Very thin and started to fray after a week.
3.0,Bought this for my wife she loves it but the fit is a little small would recommend getting one size larger .
3.0,Need padding on the arms. Ears are sore after a long day of wear.
3.0,Like the sweat's great color but fit funny on my hips and on my hips I don't think they're gonna work very well if you're a hippie kind of girl if you had a teenage boy body they'd fit great on you or if you were skinny as a stick needs to come Up a little higherIn the waist
3.0,The masks are very comfortable. The chin support is perfect.
3.0,Prob won't buy another one. The Magnasonic Professional Ultrasonic Polishing Jewelry Cleaner Machine and a nice soft cloth seem to work real well so I don't need this.
3.0,"I ordered the all white/ivory fox - what isn't shown or in the description that it is on a black beaded chain (black or dk brown), I thought it was<br />on an all white/ivory beaded chain and would have given it 5 stars if it were.  That being said the fox itself is very pretty and I think the girls I purchased it for will still like it - at least I hope so..."
3.0,Very cute for couples who love to match
3.0,Well made but warning: THIS IS BURGUNDY. OR maybe Maroon. AKA not red. Returned bc I needed a red apron.
3.0,Not real micheal kors threads aren’t loose and uneven nice jacket gho
3.0,"The look pretty, but they are a bit weak."
3.0,"Let me first say that this is my second pair of Baleaf. I really like the first pair that I ordered from the company and was eager to receive this second pair. They're a great fit, great quality, and you can't beat the price. My issue is this: I wanted to wear these shorts for hot yoga where the sweat just pours off of you, and right out of the package, the white portion of the shorts is completely see-thru. I tested a small corner of the white fabric under the faucet, and it got predictably so much worse when wet. I'll be returning these for a pair that does not have any white fabric in them.<br /><br />Other things I can say about these shorts that may be helpful: I'm 6'-2&#34; and about 175 pounds, and I'm top tall (have a long torso). I purchased the size medium. There's plenty of room in front and there's a liner that kind of helps mask the outline of your junk. Don't worry too much about buying a snug size. You really won't look obscene."
3.0,I bought it for my husband for Christmas but I gave it to him early because he has come down with a cold. He is 6'2 and very very slender with a 29 inch waist so I went with the small/medium. A lot of folks say they are roomy so I thought that would be fine but he says the sleeves ride up because he is broad shouldered but he says it will be fine. No need to return it he says.....sooooo.....otherwise it's a great robe when it comes to softness and quality ....guess I should have got him the large
3.0,It is not in gold color as shown in the picture. It is in rose gold color which is spoiling the look
3.0,Probably my own fault but wasn’t paying attention and ordered wrong item. I didn’t want a draw string sack I wanted the backpack. Should have been more attentive to my cart
3.0,These are some heavy shoes. Better have strong ankles and calves. Very cute though.
3.0,by a size up too small
3.0,"The price was right but, although not bad, the quality was not very good. They look nice but one must be very careful when handling them because the metal parts will bend and eventually break."
3.0,I wanted to love this so much but the top and bottom is completely see through
3.0,"Too small, felt like I was busting stitches. Weird feel to pant."
3.0,So the shirt is nice and looks better in person. But who ever sewed it together did a bad job. I washed on gentle and dried on low heat because I don’t think it was pre-washed. After found stitching around right arm lose and a big piece came out. I threaded the piece and sewed it back in by hand.
3.0,Material was fine.  I’m 5’1” and it went almost to my ankles.  Just didn’t fit like the picture.
3.0,This robe was nice until I washed it.  It started tearing and I threw it away.  Not the best material or quality
3.0,a little thin
3.0,The small is pretty loose on me as a 30D bra size. It's wearable but not supportive
3.0,Cute but did not stay on and pinched a little
3.0,a true ugly sweater (!) but ran too large
3.0,I am having a great deal of difficulty keeping the bracelet on my wrist.  It keeps coming apart and I don't know what is wrong.
3.0,"Love the look of the watch, but it's hard to adjust the time with my big fingers and how small the watch is."
3.0,"These headbands work, but they are not the heavier terrycloth knit I expected. I've used them several times, now, and they seem to do the job."
3.0,Looked Great in my Ears =] but only worked for 30 mins and had to get new Batteries
3.0,This wallet is so thin it’s literally just good for a few bills and credit cards. Haven’t been able to use it because I carry more. But if you don’t carry a lot of stuff could be perfect for you.
3.0,Super comfortable and light. Be careful they shrink and likely won’t hold up long
3.0,For $7 you get a set of the skeleton hands (not just one) -my hands are small (I wear size 5 ring) and these are tight-ordered 2 pairs by mistake so one I will try to fix so wearable-😀
3.0,Cute top bit narrow in the shoulders.
3.0,"the measurements of my glasses (56x40) should have fit by the diagram, but they do not."
3.0,"I thought this was going to be stunning ,Honestly,  i gave it a chance figuring an accessory is an easy way and a cute way to dress up something just as a simple touch,, when I first opened it, I fought with it to stay together, it was 2 dollars, and I waited over a month for it to show up, so i figured it'd put some time and effort into it. And of course right away i thought to myself, You get what you pay for! It took me over 20 minutes to get it to stay together by pressing the connectors together better than it was created, (maybe mine was just a dud, I'm going to email the company, and update)<br /><br /> And honestly its not that cute on, it doesn't sparkle as much as the pictures, if you're looking for something classy don't pick this, if you're looking for something for your young daughter to play with, go this route because you can throw it in the trash and not feel bad about it or turn it into an art project and make it into something better! I threw it in a drawer and didn't think twice about it after I got it, when initially I was so excited about it! I give it 3 stars because it looks a lot better than something that came out of a penny machine, I do give it that, it isn't the cheap rhinestones you get from the dollar store, its the better stones similar to  quality ones you'd find at the Claries in the malls.  When I put it on after I got the thing to stay together, mind you I was so sad from waiting so long for it, but two, from the connections falling apart from the linkings (not major, normal with cheap jewelry, simple fix squeezing/bending the connectors) I put it on in my bathroom, and the thing was tight, I'm a petite girl, and I have a very small head and can normally wear kids headbands and accessories and hats without a problem, so it was a bit uncomfortable since the top part is metal, I figure i'll have to stretch the elastic out on it before I wear it."
3.0,"Maybe the mask is made for kids or people with narrow faces.  The forehead area fits OK but the area around the cheeks form pretty much a 90 degree angle.  This results in an uncomfortable fit AND it sticks out about an inch and half from the tip of my nose.  Perhaps they shaped this without the thick foam padding which would have been a better fit.<br /><br />Disregarding the issue with the fit, the protection is decent.  Basketball is my sport and I generally play point guard.  Vision is not a problem...I've read reviews that people complained about not being able to see but they might be expecting miracles or something only a custom fitted mask would provide.  The clear plastic allows you to see in front of you.  The padding below and above does restrict the a little bit but it's worth sacrificing for the protection.<br /><br />There are 2 issues going back to the mask...to get it to stay as close to the face as possible, I adjust the straps so it's relatively tight to my face.  After a while, it gets pretty uncomfortable and hurts a little on the pressure points (on the forehead and cheeks).  Might be OK if you get rest after a few minutes but in pickup games that lasts for a while, you don't get a breather to take the mask off.  The other problem is when I bring the ball up before my shot, the mask is so far off my face it gets in the way.  It's happened on multiple occasions where forget about the mask as I go for an outside shot, I hit my mask with the basketball which throws off my shot resulting in an airball.  I've tried adjusting to this by shooting on the left and right side or shoot from my chest but anyone will tell you varying your shot will lower your accuracy.  Conclusion, the mask offers great protection but would have been great if it fit better.  Because of how narrow it is, it causes problems mentioned above."
3.0,"I received the wrong product but returns are a hassle for me, so I just kept it. I received a twisted wire version of this ring. The quality of the one I got is nice. So far no skin staining or allergic reaction to the metal."
3.0,"There were strings hanging off the hem lines, sleeves.  I had to trim them up and be careful it didn't pull.  I was a little disappointed with the quality for the price."
3.0,The earrings did not really look like giraffes when they arrived. The only had similar shape
3.0,"A huge plus for me right from the start is how easy they are to install thanks to the quick release pins. The white stitching doesn’t look so great (note in my pictures I’ve been trying to darken them so they’re not white). I’m not sure about how well some of it will hold together, but I’ve only had it a short while. So far, it does the job, was easy, and very inexpensive. If you’re looking for a cheaper option as a temporary fix, definitely get one."
3.0,Had a funky smell that didn't wash out.
3.0,"thin double layer,  no filter pocket, large mask,  comfortable"
3.0,"the ring came with missing stones. I really like it but only wear it for dress-up and then put it back in the box. I'm afraid more stones will fall out. But all in all, it is a gorgeous ring"
3.0,"Fits somewhat baggy compared to what i was expecting, I normally wear medium or large shirts but I might order this in a small."
3.0,"A bit small. Doesn't look quite like picture (thinner hood-strings than in picture, different color zipper, less roomy). It also has a thinner material than I expected. For fashion, not for cold. It's not a bad hoodie, it's just different than described."
3.0,"I purchased this hat for a 1940s themed party. The brim was too narrow for a true 1940s fedora. The quality was fine and the price was right. I can't complain about purchasing it, it has served its purpose."
3.0,Warm and comfey but I wouldn't buy them again.  The non slip strips come off easily.
3.0,I think these earrings are really pretty. I love the print/colors. I didn’t read product description though and was surprised that they seem to be made of some sort of paper. Not a bad thing… just surprised me. I most likely wouldn’t have paid if I have paid attention to the material being paper though. But I will wear them.
3.0,"While I will keep the wallet, if you have enough card size stuff for many of the slots and more than maybe a half-dozen bills, the wallet simply will not stay closed. I don't know why, but this isn't the first folding wallet maker I've encountered that doesn't provide enough material for the outer skin to accommodate the innards if you actually use them."
3.0,"It's comfortable, but the seams are awkward and coming apart at the zipper (which is completely unnecessary). I don't mind it much though due to the low price."
3.0,We bought for kids but it came large size then their head can hold the glasses.
3.0,"Very, very, very, very small....kids...or babies size"
3.0,Small but didn't hear bad so am buying a charm holder
3.0,I ordered XL which is my size and it fits like 3XL. It’s really cute but is to big for me I will return it
3.0,This belt worked really well and was really nice. The issue with it was in less then a year the part where you reverse it broke right off. My fiancée said he has never had one break so fast. I would have liked to see it last a year at least.
3.0,"Good looking but not comfortable at all, they fall from my head on hills"
3.0,painted metal so the color will rub off and likely sooner than later but for the price it's alright.
3.0,Loved color and small print.  Tight in bust.  Ankle length was perfect on my 5’ height.  Going to return.  Too small.
3.0,Color I received is a lighter olive green.  Sort of an odd color.  Not what I expected.
3.0,"I bought these because I am a chef with fragile skin. I liked the idea of the knife resistance, more seemed good for bumps and bangs. But, one wearing for about 20 mins and I was hot, arms sweaty and ready to take them off and I wasn't even cooking! I would only recommend for those who really cut their arms with knives. I returned them in favor of cutting up a pair of my DH's dress socks... works great!"
3.0,"The fit is good except for the sleeves are too short - i was hoping to be able to roll the cuffs up to show off the cute polka dots. It's a cute shirt, though."
3.0,Product was ok but amazon delivery was late! I understand we are going through difficult times but you can’t give me an estimate delivery and not show up on time! I should have given an update on the item!
3.0,"Pros - great for costumes, looks nice<br />Cons - a bit small<br /><br />Bought this for part of my renaissance costume, sadly I couldn't wear it as it was way too small. I'm not a large person, but this would not fit my upper arm. Wouldn't even fit my lower arm.<br />It looks nice and if you have very skinny arms would work. Craftsmanship is decent for what you pay. The little vials are great and it looks great."
3.0,Cute shirt it just runs small.
3.0,"It is WAY too small. It isn't even like a t-shirt dress. Yeah, it said mini dress, but this really is MINI. I'm not some hussy at the club trying to attract all the wrong attention by showing a full moon or my undies anytime I bend over. It's more like a regular t-shirt. I'll just wear it that way, I guess. I wouldn't buy it again, even in a larger size."
3.0,Ok product. Goggles fog up easily if it's moist outside. I do not recommend wearing them for a mud race.
3.0,"Comfortable, and a loose fit.<br />Biggest DISAPPOINTMENT- made in China"
3.0,I washed this sweater before wearing and it went from an extra large to a medium.  Very disappointing because it is one of my favorite brands and was very cute.
3.0,"This is an excellent dress.  I have it in two colors, and it fits very well, is flattering, and is exceedingly versatile. I have two little kids (2 and 4) so I am probably exposed to more potentially-problematic substances than the average person, but it seems like both the dresses get mysterious spots on them a lot that then have to be treated with Dawn dish detergent. This does not seem to happen with my other dresses."
3.0,"These babies are tight! Getting them over my big head is a challenge for sure. Once on they work fine, stay on well, are breathable, nice color and fabric. If you gotta medium size melon...you’re good."
3.0,"Outside is fine , plastic holder is already breaking."
3.0,"The tank piece is too big for me, it's so long it covers up the bottom pieces almost completely. The other two pieces are loose on me. I am 5 foot 7 and 155 pounds with a wee bit of a mama pooch belly. Wishing I would of gotten a medium, but that size was sold out. It is very well made, and I will still wear it. Just wishing the tank part was not so long."
3.0,The sizing was not right at all for this product. These are really beautiful and very soft and silky. Unfortunately just way too small...I usually wear an XL in American sizes...but I would probably need a 4 or 6x in these tops in the China sizes...Disappointed because I had to send them back. They would have been really comfortable. Colors are just as shown. Fabric is silky soft and seems to be cooling...Having to send back my order for these...
3.0,I love the message on this bracelet. However I lost the smaller charms and the edge of the bracelet gets caught on things.
3.0,"Both stones came out when I opened the package, but I just super glued them back into place. Even broken, not the worst price."
3.0,"Semi-modest, busty girls stay away. I was willing for a little bit of side boob, but it's just too much."
3.0,"I’ll start by saying I DO like this bodysuit, however I am short (5’2”) and I can’t keep it snapped at the bottom. I decided to keep it and just tuck it in my pencil skirts because I do like how it looks. Very professional. I am, however, a little thrown off that the tag on the inside of the shirt is cut off? Never seen that done on an Amazon purchased product before?"
3.0,I ordered a 6.5 and received a 6. I didn't care for the boot. the zipper was stiff but I did receive them in a shortamount of time. but I will be returning to buy something else instead.
3.0,It does not maintain it's shape and the ribbon keeps slipping showing the seam. It does look like a less expensive hat than what I usually buy. I will not buy one again.
3.0,So I did follow the sizing chart and amongst my hesitation which I should have gone one size up I chose to go with the size from the sizing chart. I found them to be a little too snug and going by the sizing chart. Would still be able to get into them it was just a little tighter than normal but nonetheless everything did work perfectly fine. And I was able to squeeze into a pair of jeans they were two sizes smaller than me because it does shrink your waist quite a bit. The good thing about these underwear that I have found is it not only do they give you that nice control but also it has the straps on the side with three different settings that you could put it on. The different settings just gives you more of a control a tighter fit which works great especially if you want to look your best in a very nice tight fitting dress.
3.0,Definitely booty shorts... I thought they'd work well for kickboxing... But meh.<br /><br />I'm 5'3&#34; and 115lbs and I got the S and they are too small.  The material is meh... Construction quality is meh...<br /><br />For the price I can't complain too much... But I could easily spend $5 more and get significantly better quality shorts.<br /><br />I doubt theyll hold up over time.
3.0,there is no cashmere in the sweater
3.0,This bag is definitely very nice quality. The only issue I had was that the leather is NOT has depicted in the image. The leather I got was insanely shiny. It definitely put me off a  bit for the purchase. I'm hoping with some use it'll dull up a bit like the image shows - it's almost bad enough for me to consider returning it - not what I purchased.
3.0,"only works if you have a heavy boot on. does not keep warm in a hiking shoe.<br />Did not keep warm when sitting still, only walking."
3.0,The sweater was really soft and I liked the color however it is a very small. If you plan to order it order a larger size for sure!
3.0,"This isn't for plus size. It barely covered my bottom and I'm 5""2"
3.0,"The studs are bigger than I expected and large for my taste. I've already lost a couple because the front part with the gem comes unscrewed pretty easily, especially compared to the one I previously wore (That one lasted over a year without coming unscrewed or falling out before I finally had to replace). I wear these in my lip, by the way. They're cheap so it's fine for the price. Will not buy again though."
3.0,"It works okay, I mean it is a wallet insert, time will tell more but it works well now."
3.0,"Cant see the black it just looks like dark blue glass, but still cool"
3.0,"On my monitor, the colors in the plastic pieces appeared to be pastel and, in fact, they are quite bright. It was startling when I first opened the package. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it's just personal preference.  I'm still keeping the necklace even though it is not what I expected because I still find it pretty. I just wanted people to be aware that it is much brighter than shown, and in addition to the purple, pink, and blue shown, it also has very prominent green and yellow. Also, the mounts the plastic colored pieces are in also appear to be plastic, not metal, so the only metal on the necklace is the chain. I haven't worn it yet to see if it turns my neck green. There's no question this is cheaply made plastic costume jewelry, but you are getting it for a very cheap price. In this instance, you are getting what you pay for, and, in my opinion, even as low quality as it is, for the price, it's a very pretty costume piece. I'm keeping it."
3.0,"Nothing special here, except these are price a little high for what you actually get. These do run small!!"
3.0,It’s polyester like a dirt bike jersey so  it’s thin
3.0,Mine doesn’t look very silver an odd shiny gold color. I received it on time. Doesn’t seem like real chalcedony either. I will test it later.. can’t tell at a glance.
3.0,Not really for short people.. the whole reason I chose these was for the elastic at the ankles. But they just look very baggy. Kept them anyway they are okay for lounging at home.
3.0,"The PZZ women’s top is a very nicely made dressed-up tee shirt. The cotton-spandex blend is light and comfortable. All stitching is tight, straight, and even and the sizing is spot-on for US women’s sizes. I am 5’3” and around 145, I ordered the XL and it fits exactly as an XL in a high-end retail store would fit. I love that the fabric is lightweight enough to be cool even on the hottest day but doesn’t bunch up or pucker at the seams.<br /><br />There is an awkward design detail offset under the bust – in the product listing I thought it was just a photographer’s oversight, like maybe the model had the shirt accidentally tucked in her bra and no one photoshopped it out. It’s a small asymmetrical ruching that I think some women could pull off brilliantly but on me it just doesn’t work. My best friend took me aside and told me that the shirt adds twenty pounds visually – she’s typically a little catty so I’m not sure that’s not an exaggeration but suffice to say that this isn’t flattering on my body type. The front hem is adorable, the back though is too short to cover one of my biggest (ha) problem areas. The other feature that made this shirt less than ideal for me personally is that it is hand wash only. Given how well made it is, if the shirt were flattering on me I would want to wear it every day and the hand-wash only thing would be cumbersome.<br /><br />I received the PZZ women’s short sleeve top for a discounted cost in exchange for an unbiased review and am impressed with the top quality fabric that is perfect for summer wear but not a huge fan of the design details."
3.0,They are decent.  Don’t love the material
3.0,Super cute but very cheaply made. Gets dull and discolored fast.
3.0,"I took the description of flowy to mean that it was a little lose, I'm normally a large but the top was way to tight I'd recommend ordering a size up if your not looking for a tight fit. The top was true to how the picture describes in terms of color tho!"
3.0,The straps don't stay on well order a size up I am 5'5 230lbs for reference big boobs and belly. Kinda holds you in.
3.0,it's a birthday for a 13 year haven't given it yet so can't rate it yet. So once I give the gift will make a review
3.0,Maybe I’d like another color better. Not caring for it in white.
3.0,bottoms fit perfectly.... however the top was too small.  really wished you could purchase these separately! and really wished they had these in size XL!! great suit otherwise...
3.0,"These are darling fashions.  I wish the designer would cut new patterns for women in the USA, Australia, Africa, Europe.  Our profiles tend to include:  we have wider shoulders, more ample, curvier breasts, & wider hips.  What we have here is a failure to<br />communicate; you’re not listening, Kingfancy. At all.<br />  I saw the small disclaimer, “tight in chest.”  But the problem isn’t just the unreal expectations from your company that customers off the Asian continent should simply “order one size up.” Kingfancy must re-design these adorable dresses with global inclusion in mind.  You’re not paying attention, Kingfancy.<br />I’m 5’10,” & 120 llbs. I usually wear a size Small.  I purchased two in the buffalo plaid:  one black & white, the other black & red.  As recommended by hundreds of women in reviews, I ordered up to size Medium. I had tons of fun getting the black& white numbers over my head, wide shoulders & petite breasts. I loved the fabric.  I loved the design of the swing skirt. The dress fit, to borrow James Brown, “skin tight, (audio) bam bam bang, “you’re outta sight.” I’m sending back the (2) mediums.  Gawd, if I had eaten 2 slices of peach pie @ Aunt Betty’s Thanksgiving, I wouldn’t be able to Houdini into the dress. Period. Only small framed women can pull off the current design. I’m amazed that Kingfancy is peddling their Asian design to the rest of the world without thinking diversity, inclusion. Kingfancy, women come in many gorgeous colors & body types. Kingfancy, are you selling us seconds? Warehouse dresses that are overruns of your inventory? That’s wrong. Wake up & produce a new line celebrating women of many cultures, tribes, & traditions.  Did you overestimate your Asian market?  Are you selling us factored, warehoused inventory? I have to think long &hard if I want to re-order in size Large.  The proof of concept is right on.  The execution is waaay off.  Your weak understanding of customer acquisition doesn’t bother you. OK. I really love the style & the flow of the circle skirt.  Really.  Are your Asian customers that much into rockabilly?  Maybe they weren’t. And all the other continents love the style just because. I certainly do."
3.0,"I didn’t realize it was open ended, which helps you be able to put it on any finger and make it fit, however it’s gotten caught a few times and bent all the way open. I wouldn’t be surprised if it cracked one of the next times that happens. But it’s got a trendy look and for the low price I’d say it’s worth it. It’s a “you get what you pay for” type of ring."
3.0,Super cute & comfy but lenses pop out constantly
3.0,"This runs pretty small and while it is gorgeous from the front, the butterfly pattern doesn't follow all the way around the back, which is kind of strange."
3.0,"They are non slip which is great, but they run so big."
3.0,to much going on with this necklace
3.0,Fit is good but lense has lots of reflection when expose to sunlight.
3.0,"The shorter bar is nice, but the ball that goes in your belly button is pretty big, which makes your belly button look bigger, especially with the black jewel."
3.0,"I purchased the necklace earring set labeled as Pink1.  It is 3 squares, one in light pink, one is a rhinestone with rose gold and one is rhinestone with silver.  I am only rating this 3 stars because I checked the measurements of the earrings and necklace pendant that was provided and the earrings were supposed to be smaller than the pendant but they are the exact same size (see photo).  Also, the earrings are heavy (maybe because they are so large).  I will use the necklace but the earrings are useless for me."
3.0,My husband's feet are too wide for these slipper socks. Such a shame because the leather bottoms and the knit tops were excellent quality.
3.0,Item was okay but smaller than expected and it was missing the turquoise stone in the middle of the paw.
3.0,"Very cute saying. Loved the color of the shirt. Shirt was too tight for me after I washed it. I would def size up 1-2 sizes, just depending on if you like your shirts tight or not."
3.0,The print and quality of the shirt did not match the price. It was a large and fit more like a small.
3.0,"The eye holes were uncomfortably small; I felt like it was poking me in the eye all the time. That being said, it was still very pretty and maybe it fits other faces better than mine? The strap fits well and didn't fall down or have to be re-tied often."
3.0,"They are made well enough. Fabric light weight, feels good. The cut is very generous around the hip making it too shapeless and gathered for me. One size fits all might work for some.  The waist is fine, accommodates different sizes. I returned mine. I normally wear size 6."
3.0,Fits well but was very thin. Go up in size.
3.0,"Cute, a little short"
3.0,"2nd time I’ve tried to buy a cute top on line. Second time I’m returning it. Quality fair. Bad stitching created hole in seam. Another shirt of same brand, & same size was perfect fitting, this fit like a sausage skin. Ugh! Never again!"
3.0,Run Alittle small but my daughter still likes them.
3.0,ordered my usual size and it was too mall
3.0,It’s really really thin material.
3.0,"I do like the fabric and the print. The dress does not look good with my body type, maybe better for a taller person. I'm 5'3."
3.0,Material see through
3.0,"These are so small for drop earrings, they get lost in my hair and you can't really notice them. I really thought they would be a little larger, I don't think they were represented correctly. So, for the price okay but certainly not great."
3.0,"I bought this cute shirt, but was disappointed when it came.  The material is so thin you would need to wear a tank top or cami underneath, which is not something I want to do in 100 degree summer weather."
3.0,"This is a beautiful bracelet - not so sure about the ""healing"" qualities. The biggest problem is that the blue from the beads came off onto my arm and it took a couple of days to wash it off.  Because of this I am not sure that I will wear it again."
3.0,"Not as pictured and cheap metal,  but my friend hasn't stopped wearing it."
3.0,Yes exactly like the picture.
3.0,The shirts I brought is a pretty decent quality. You'll have to buy more than one because the sun will fade it and will change color due to over washing it. I wish they would of made the labels a little different. The big label on the back of the shirts and a smaller label on the front of the shirts just so the shirt won't be so noticable. Other than that it a pretty good shirt.
3.0,Flag is awesome. Back edges way to sharp. Make uncomfortable on skin.
3.0,Burgundy is more of a plum color
3.0,"I bought these watch screen protectors and they are ok. For some reason they always lift on the edges. I have never had that problem before with a watch protector. I took one off, and put another one on but it did the same thing. My watch was brand new and clean, and I installed them just like the instructions say to. At the end of the day, it still protects the watch."
3.0,"I love the length, covers pretty much all of me. Great for brushing out dog and not getting hair so over me. My complaint is the neck strap did not stay connected, I finally just put a knot in it🤷🏼‍♀️."
3.0,I used this product for a Persephone from Lore Olympus costume. I have long fingers and these were just too short. Other than that they were great. Held up all night.
3.0,Not a big fan of how my shoe gets stuck on the mat.. I drive a manual and so it keeps getting stuck when I release the clutch... looks good and is heavy but It that just keeps happening
3.0,"Well made dress, but it runs small for a 3x large."
3.0,Fit was a little to small for me.
3.0,"I really appreciate the style and material used to create this sweatshirt but was deeply annoyed at the size difference.<br />Please recognize that what they call an XL is really an adult Medium.<br /><br />However, I can not give it less than 3 stars because the sweatshirt itself is so impressive; the design and texture really reflect high quality work.<br />I ended up giving it to my wife (which is bittersweet since I so wanted a sweatshirt that looked like that; now when she wears it a little tear comes down my face).<br /><br />I hope they can actually start making proper XL items."
3.0,i was expecting allot better maybe j got a bad size but it’s very uncomfortable
3.0,One or two time wear... gain to much lint ...but fit really well
3.0,These were really tight on my calves.  Flew to Europe and had to take them off mid-flight.
3.0,"You get what you pay for, as the saying goes.  I bought this watch for an elderly relative because the numbers on the face are larger than average.  When the package came, the clasp on the end of the watch band was broken.  I fiddled with it and fixed it, but it was not a good way to start.  In the end, however, she loved the watch, which keeps true time."
3.0,Adorable but very thin after it’s washed!!
3.0,This belly ring is super cute but the charm tends to fall off and it's not really easy to put back on
3.0,"This top fits comfortably! However, it did not work with big boobs, unless you want more mid drift showing. Then, it’s cute! It’s not as pretty as the picture and if you wear it for a night, be prepared to get snagged on yourself. I only tried it on and I got snagged, thankfully, I noticed and saved it. I will be returning."
3.0,Runs small but it’s cute. Size up!
3.0,"They run a little small, but are really soft."
3.0,Its pretty but sizes run small
3.0,"Sexy coverup. I do like it a lot. Been on two trips already.  I say it fits small, more so because of the length. It may only come halfway down my butt. And the idea is to cover up. If it were a little longer, and there was a sleeveless version, I'd have multiples in different colors!"
3.0,"Although I loved the dress, I returned it because the material is see-through."
3.0,"My daughter found them comfortable enough, but she played outside for about an hour and the toes were very scuffed, revealing a gray rubber-looking material underneath.  I'll try and camouflage it with shoe polish, but I'm not too hopeful.  I'm not impressed by the durability. Another case of getting what you pay for."
3.0,"Size L Initial tight fit. Unzipping it to take off, my skin got caught and tore it. But then, it either stretched a bit or I got thinner! So now it’s too big. I still wear it for support of my back while working and can tighten the straps."
3.0,These are nice rings! Only gave 3 stars because I received 4 and the picture shows 6 which is somewhat misleading. Also they are rounded and not as pretty as the ones with the beveled edges. Good quality though.
3.0,The fit was good. I didn't particularly care for the fabric.
3.0,Very poor quality. Metal changed color and band broke.<br /><br />Update: After initial update the company immediately sent me a new replacement! I am very happy that I am able to use it again! Maybe first order was just an oddity.
3.0,Nice material but this dress hugged me in all the wrong places so I had to return it. I would not buy if you are uncomfortable with dresses fitting tightly around your stomach.
3.0,"UPDATE:  After using this product for over a year, the accordion card holders are splitting at the ends, and will allow cards to slide out when open.  I feel compelled to reduce stars from five to three. I was using a money clip with a leather card holder, this combo card/money cash band is much easier to use, because of the compartments for credit cards.  The elastic strap for cash holds my cash firmly and safely."
3.0,"Quality seems passable, but sizing runs a little small. If I was to reorder, I would order one size larger."
3.0,Kinda cheap quality
3.0,"actually works and does a good job cutting glare from on coming traffic..except for those new blue headlights,,made my nighttime drive a little easier on the eyes"
3.0,"Sorry, they caused an irritation to my ears. I would love to try something else."
3.0,Did not fit me.
3.0,"This top appears slightly different in person than in the photo. It has a very tapered, elastic like feel on the bottom of the top making it feel pretty restrictive. It doesn't sit super baggy, it's more of a fitted look. I'd recommend ordering a size up, but, for sure, not ordering a smaller size, as this top is much smaller in person than it appears in the photo. It is really cute material and will pair well with skinny jeans. Super cute, but, just order up for the right fit."
3.0,Rums small
3.0,Nice heavy well made watch. Only flaw is the claps release is on the side and is easy to bump claps open
3.0,Breakable
3.0,"My wife complains that they fit a little off sometimes, but overall they work for me."
3.0,Fabric is thin and can see through in light
3.0,These are pretty enough but they’re practically child sized. I can deal with them being a bit snug but I can’t even get them on. I’ll be returning them.
3.0,"I like the colour and fit - it's very cute and flattering. However, after waiting months to wear it, first wear at the beach resulted in one side of the straps almost fully detaching where it attached to the cup. One cup also kept shifting a little in the water which meant I had to keep checking for nipple exposure (*sigh*). The top is a pool side/ no wet/ no stress suit for sure. Will  prob match the bottoms with other bikini tops."
3.0,Little too thin as a cold winter glove. Finger tips are too big for accurate touch screen. Wool feels little scratchy.
3.0,Didn't get any relief from this.
3.0,runs short and small
3.0,I like these but I was expecting an overall hugged feeling throughout the leggings (like the faux leather) but instead the hug is only in the waist. I wear them and I like them because they're something different than a usual black legging but I prefer a slightly tighter fit.
3.0,"Cute glasses, not actually effective"
3.0,Pockets hit in a weird spot. Fabric a little thin.
3.0,"Definitely good for cosplay photo shoots but I wouldn't walk around  in it. I broke a small piece of mine walking only a small distance but it's nothing that really affects the whole cosplay. It's also a bit restraining as I can barely move, but then again I'm a bit of a bigger gal so of course it was going to be a tad tight. The belts that go around your thighs do tend to slip out of place very easily but it's not that much of a bother unless you're me who has perfection issues XD"
3.0,Tank top was very short. Does not look like the picture at all when it’s on
3.0,I did as the comments suggested and bought a size up. It was wayyyy too big so I'm going to return & order smaller. The color is very pretty on the mint shirt
3.0,Like this shirt. Seem to fit well but if you put anything like keys or phone in the pockets the pocket hangs below the shirt and looks really awkward. I bought it for the zipper pocket but it is so lightweight can't hold the items in place correctly.
3.0,"It took forever to get here and was partially bent. I can move it back into the proper place if I'm careful, but it's still inconveniant."
3.0,Believe me this is the tiniest earrings I have ever seen. Super hard to put on since it is so small and there is a screw back. I think if you have multiple piercing this would enhance whatever else you are wearing but alone it's just not that great.
3.0,I got medium. l take a very average 32 inseam  these are about 34 inches inseam<br />I have a pair of medium izod lounge pants like these from about 8 years ago that are perfect length  NOT THESE :(
3.0,Soft material.  The cut is cute but stitching looks cheap.  Shipped fast. Works good for sleep wear our layering piece.
3.0,"Just meh for the price. A little cheap looking, looks for costume then something I could wear on a regular basis. Returned."
3.0,Quality good just not right for me.
3.0,"It looks pretty, the fit was great too. However, my one regret is how easily the lace fabric snags. I wasn't wearing any sharp edges or jewelry which could snag this item, but after only one day of wear, it was snagged to the point that it looks old. Too bad."
3.0,"Very cute, a little long is you’re shorter like me (5’3”) but the material feels like 1970s polyester, it classes it down quite a bit"
3.0,Thin...not correct size. Material real thin and kinda see thru.
3.0,"I really like this bracelets. However it tarnish sooo fast. I follow the directions: no water, no perfume and I do not even use for every day. Just special occasions and still tarnished."
3.0,Didn't really like it because of the material so I gave it away to someone who would wear it
3.0,"it's strangely wide and short. if i raise my arms over my head, the hem comes up over my belly button. does not fit like the photo, as there's no way you could tuck this into anything short of mom jeans."
3.0,These are probably great shoe stretchers but putting those nubs in the correct spot was a challenge for me. I had to return them.
3.0,"I got this in a 0-3 month size and it was similar in size to some of my 9month clothes! Way oversized. But, the embroidery seemed like really good quality and I liked the look of it."
3.0,I don't even know what to say about ordering these except that they run very large.
3.0,"Love the pattern and the contrast you get when tied around your head - plenty big enough. could support short to med length natural hair. Very light & thin as another reviewer said (that's what I preferred) Started to fray on one edge after the 2nd wash (but to be fair, I washed it on normal) I use it to protect my 4c hair (underneath a satin bonnet) it stays on better at night that way. Hope this helps!"
3.0,Bought these for face mask ties.  Good thing they weren't intended to be used as shoelaces because the length difference was as much as two inches within a pair.  The colors shown aren't the same colors they send.  The laces themselves were flatter than the others I bought from a different Amazon vendor and weren't nearly as twisted so will probably be easier to use.  I really wish plain old black and white laces were available from the places we used to be able to get them...
3.0,nice but won't last long
3.0,"Some of the coolest designs on the web.  About as thick (maybe a bit thinner) than the stock, $1 bandanas at Wal-Mart and the like.  Not overly large...might not cover a larger, bald head or work out for a bike rider as a face mask.  Would buy again for a kid...but not for a large man."
3.0,They are ok. The black shows red lines online but the lines are white.
3.0,"It is not quite as flattering/for fitting as it seems on the model. I would size down, and that may help. I got a S, but should have got an extra small. It's very long, but I like that. It is a bt sheer, but very soft. Good for a lazy day."
3.0,Not the best quality but super adorable
3.0,"a little too heavy for my mom's purse..she has shoulder issues. but sturdy and good quality. sadly, must return for lighter product"
3.0,Looks nice and fits perfect but the quality of the fabric got ruined after a single wash. Somehow disappointing
3.0,"A little cheesy looking for an 7 year old with the off-the-shoulder look, and the straps seem even thinner in person.  Colors are great and vibrant, but not my first choice.  I won’t let her wear it to the public pool."
3.0,"I loved the fit of the dress, but I am disappointed in the color. I order the dark green dress. However, the dress that I received was not dark green. The dress shipped to me is teal colored. I purchased the dress last minute to wear for an event, so I could not return it."
3.0,Didn't realize it was bedazzled
3.0,"So cute, bought them for my boyfriend he loved them. A bit pricey for a si ng le pair of socks though"
3.0,You get what you pay for and maybe it's just me but it feels weird around the chest and shoulders even though it is the same size as my other rashguards. I use it as an emergency rashguard if I forget one or just haven't done the laundry yet.
3.0,Very pretty bag but made poorly. Not for frequent use. The loop for clasp broke after 2 wears.
3.0,Looks like picture but very flimsy. Kept folding over while wearing it
3.0,T-shirt material very thin.
3.0,It was way to small. It's wicked cute
3.0,"Runs big on my 3 year old.  Better suited for a 4, almost 5 year old."
3.0,"It's not as bright and sparkly like the earrings, but it's ok, it looks a little cheap., otherwise I like it"
3.0,"While the dress was beautiful, the top was way too small. I’m normally a size 8 and I ordered a large 12/14 to get the oversized look in the pictures, but the arms were tight and I couldn’t button it over my chest (D cup)."
3.0,The shirt is fAIRLY LARGE AND IS MORE OF A PALE YELLOW THAN A MUSTARD YELLOW
3.0,"Very comfortable,  but doesn't hold the girls in place very well. I'd compare this to a decent swim suit top.<br /><br />Buy a size smaller."
3.0,Too small. Looks good but too small.
3.0,smaller than it appears
3.0,"You can see through it, it is decent quality"
3.0,Does its job and keeps your hands from burning on hot surfaces but a bit big for my hands. I feel clumsy using them and trying to get my hands around cookware.  Otherwise a good product.
3.0,"Decent slippers - very thin sole but that's evident in the picture.  Haven't held up very well in the wash, but if you aren't weird about having clean feet then you don't have to wash them."
3.0,I think these are cute for fashion and style purposes. But as far as tracking weight loss/gain these are NOT the right beads. The elastic stretches with you. They do pinch on occasion if you're skin gets caught between some beads as you/they move.<br /><br />Again I still like them for styling purposes but i primarily wanted them for tracking my waist/stomach.
3.0,"Very pretty print, looks exactly like the photos, and very generously sized. ( I am 5'5"" , size 10, and I had way more than enough room! )<br />However, it is not linen or a linen blend. My guess is polyester/cotton. And, it is quite sheer. If not for the print, you would require a slip of some sort to go out of the house. ( I also expected pockets, but there are none. )<br />Most likely I will be returning this. Disappointed."
3.0,"I like the bag and it is very roomy but after carrying it for a week, I started to notice that strings were starting to unravel and come out all around the shoulder strap. I cut them off and it is ok now, my niece has the exact same bag with the exact same issues :("
3.0,This sheer shoulder cover up was entirely too small! It didn’t seem to be stitched together well either!
3.0,Looked ok. Returned cause feathers were coming off to easily. And I didn't want it on my black outfit
3.0,Its okay...a little on the thinner side and somewhat sheer.  I like the collar and it is smooth fitting for the price its okay...
3.0,"I bought the large. I'm 5'1, 125 pounds, bust: 36B, Hips: 40 inches, Waist 32 inches and this beautiful white dress is too tight around my upper waist across my ribs when I sit down. When I stand it feels okay though. I just wish an XLarge was available to purchase. The large is not going to work out. If your waist measurements are lower than mine, the dress will probably fit you fine. The material is very high quality and it's the perfect length. It saddens me to return it."
3.0,Its a bit heavier than the plastic crowns kids usually wear. My only complaint is it arrived bent. I was afraid to bend it back in fear it would snap and break. So it slides off my daughter's head.
3.0,Top is nude/beige/buff/tan NOT light green like in photo.<br /><br />TOP IS HUGE! Bottoms fit great. Returned.
3.0,"These earrings are so cute, but will not stay together. The backs keeps coming unclasped, and we've come close to losing them."
3.0,Not exactly as in pictured
3.0,Wife likes it ok
3.0,Love the colors but they seem to be made out of cheep plastic.
3.0,cute but wish the snowmen were smaller
3.0,Good quality. I'm a small. 5'7 140 that's what I ordered. I could've used an XS it's now a running shirt..
3.0,I didn't expect it to be so heavy and stiff.  It is quite attractive.
3.0,"Maybe this is because I have never used double flare before, but I cant seem to fit them in even though I know i am at a 00g. But, packaging was great and they are super cute"
3.0,Good fit. Fabric is good too.<br />The only problem: the clips won't stay!<br />Wore it with panty hose for that I needed.<br />Haven't wore it again!
3.0,Looks nice and feels decently made. The reflective lens got scratched in my pocket the first time I used them however. Comes with a nice carrying case.
3.0,Is this for a kid or a man ? I am a size 12 mens shoe .
3.0,Glasses are good case is not very reliable if you are wanting to clip it to a belt or pocket.  Case is okay for in a purse or bag or lying around.
3.0,Nicely made. Way to large as I am not a tall person. Wish they had in smaller size
3.0,"Doesn't really keep food cool enough to be safe in my opinion.  It says you don't need to put ice in it, but if you don't, your food would get too warm and spoil within a few hours.  Haven't tried it with hot foods yet.  I followed directions and filled it full and stuffed it with other bags to fill the spaces, but it still didn't keep things cold enough in my opinion.  Don't waste your money."
3.0,"These sleeves do actually cool your arms.  Absolutely!!<br />They are however, made of chintzy material and don't stay all the way down to your wrists (as a one size fits all item).<br />Do not try to use them to keep warm- they really cool the arm skin!<br />For the price though, I can justify the purchase"
3.0,"I like the graphic, but the shirt is not cotton-like at all.  It is more like spandex.  I got a medium, and it is very tight."
3.0,"The skirt looks great, the graphics are unusual and it is a conversation piece. It is a little too snug for me. I got a 8/10 that fits like a 6..maybe even a 4. Because its stretchy it works but everything underneath is going to show. Period."
3.0,"I ordered this in a Medium (I am pretty much a textbook medium - not overweight, not skinny, pretty proportional) and regret having thrown away the packaging before trying this top on.<br /><br />The shirt is tight. Really tight. Too tight. Like it rolled up at the hips after a few minutes like a sausage casing and left seam indentations all along my arms tight.<br /><br />I have another running top by Baleaf in M that fits great. But word to the wise, either size up or find a different shirt!"
3.0,"Update: one laundering and on my second wearing of the floral one I bought, and the material is pilling. ****Haven't tried to wash it yet -- will be sure to update if laundering the dress makes for a problem. It looks pretty much how I expected, and the material is very thin (and seems like it would snag easily) like others report. The stitching is poor around the pockets and one pocket in fact has a small hole. It fits as expected. I ordered large. I'm 5'5, 140 lbs, slightly pear shaped. Honestly, if I had seen this dress in store versus online, I would have thought the $24 price tag is just a little too high. I don't like it as much as I thought I would by the photo."
3.0,"It is beautiful! It’s unfortunate though because the top I received only had a tightening string on one side and not the other. I have requested a refund. I am 5’3 and 115lbs, the small fits well."
3.0,"Small in the chest (got a size x-large and wear a D-cup). And the fabric is a tad bit thinner than I initially expected. Otherwise it is a cute pattern, well made for the price and is comfortable."
3.0,"Very pretty but runs HUGE! My daughter is a 12 borderline 14 (96lbs/60&#34;h) and purchased this in a 10 and still needed to be altered quite a bit. Couldn't return for a smaller size because the length would be too short and her fanny would hang out! If I hadn't been pressed for time I would have found something else. For $40 I would expect the quality would be better than say Walmart, maybe less."
3.0,Love them but much smaller than I pictured
3.0,Very soft but don't go by there sizes go up a size.
3.0,Got this for Christmas and the color is already peeling off. Definitely not worth the money.
3.0,"They were really nice glasses, but too small."
3.0,the breast area is a little larger and more airy.
3.0,"These are good for the price, I've had them for about a month and am happy to have a spare pair in every room. I wouldn't buy them again, the frames are great but the lenses are not the best, they have such a glare, it's not appealing or attractive. I can't wear them when I am talking to anyone because all the other person sees is glare-not my eyes. I'm not sure they are ""blue blockers"", but I have attached a photo of 3 different pairs that I have.  One pair is not blue blocker and 1 definitely is, the 3rd pair is one from the set I purchased here and it shows it blocks a little.<br />I would love to have these frames with a different lens."
3.0,I wish it was softer.but lenth is as describded on picture.and it runs small.
3.0,"I was so excited about this dress after reading the reviews. I'm usually around a 12-14 dress size; I got the XXL to fit my bust and, while it does fit in the bust, it's way too big in the waist, and doesn't taper in nearly as dramatically as the picture. A thin belt would be the only style that would really go with this dress, but a thicker belt is going to be the only solution to defining shape and handling the excess fabric, so I'm out of luck. For the price, I may take it to a seamstress, but also the fabric is sort of gross so I may just donate this. (It's a heavy, thick, slightly-textured stretch knit that would be much too heavy for spring or summer - or even a warm fall day. Here in CA, it's pretty much unwearable for about 9 months of the year.) Also, the &#34;teal&#34; is a true forest green in person - not as pictured. The quality seems to be good though, which is why I gave it 3 stars. The collar is sewn down which I didn't want, but the buttons are on there solidly and the seams are tight, so it's much better quality than I expected for the price.<br /><br />A note about the seller: they didn't want to deal with the return process to send it back to China so they offered me a 30% refund and to just keep it. I had to push for a larger refund, but it was still not 100%, plus I'm stuck with just one more thing to get rid of. They did, however, issue the refund quickly."
3.0,No tiene las imágenes de frozen para cambiar el fondo de pantalla
3.0,way too big and too stiff to adjust to wrist..
3.0,"I wanted to love this, but getting the top on was a hassle. The cups were too small and the band top was too large and there was no way to adjust it."
3.0,Lost 3 crystals including eye and nose. Its been a out 2 months.
3.0,"Nice for the price, much lighter / flimsier then expected"
3.0,Could be larger
3.0,"these were not for me. I thought they would help Keep track of my glasses because I am constantly taking them off and putting them down but , They are constantly coming loose, So I have to keep Tightening up that little rubber loop."
3.0,runs a bit small but other wish its ok
3.0,"This wallet is cute and stylish, and has enough room for all my stuff. However, the zipper pocket does not fit my cell phone, which is relatively small (a Google pixel) and when I use it as a clutch and carry it by the wrist strap, some of my cards slide out of the other end and that's really disappointing."
3.0,I have it to my friend for her birthday and it broke within an hour. But she liked it so much she didn't want to pay so she fixed it herself.
3.0,Cute but one came bent.
3.0,"Hard to tell from the picture, and I don't think it's worth what I paid for when that's the case. Still love the colors, but I would not buy again"
3.0,It was a very pretty skirt however it was way too long and didn't fit the way it looks like it should in the picture. It's very tight around the waste and I got a medium since it was said to fit as expected but it was still too tight and very long I have to fold it and it's still long I'm 5&#34;7. I gave it three stars because the color and design was exact and I got it when it was expected I knocked off two stars for how it fits
3.0,"I bought this for my 14-year-old son, who is very small for his age and does not like anything to fit big or baggy.  I bought a men's small and washed and dried it in hot.  It did not seem to shrink at all, but he still wears it even though it is a little roomier than what he usually wears.  That said, the fabric is somewhat similar to a dri-fit sweatshirt on the outside, but no fleece on the inside at all so it isn't very warm.  He doesn't care.  It's &quot;fly&quot; so he loves it."
3.0,"There is arch support, but I need a bit more than these shoes provide. Also sometimes when walking in them my feet don't land properly in the shoe, but to the side."
3.0,Denim doesn’t match...can’t wear together.
3.0,Good color. Didn't do well in washer.
3.0,"Love the fit.  I ordered a size up based on prior experience with online ordering and it fit perfectly, just a little short in length.  Skirt material is thicker than top but no show through. Pockets!"
3.0,"I bought the dress for my 8 yr old girl who is tall 4ft6 the length was wonderful, but the fit was to tight. She may only get  2-3 weeks out of it. The true size 9-10 in fit 12 in length"
3.0,Just received socks. Have to had the opportunity to use.
3.0,not very comfy
3.0,A little cheap looking but it's a good fit. Good shirt for every week use
3.0,It's a bit bigger than I expected.
3.0,Quite nice. Soft even before washing.
3.0,"These sun readers fit nicely but, although I ordered black, the glasses are black but the lens are a brown/orange color. The glasses would be much more attactive if the lens were grey as they are shown online."
3.0,"Decent but not the same color and detail.  Head is shallow but fits adult female size head, just doesn't sit snugly.  It's fine though for my purposes."
3.0,They would be comfy & cool for the summer & they look great but they are 1 to 2 sizes smaller then the actual size. I bought the 3X & they fit like a 1X
3.0,Cute just wish it wasn't itchy
3.0,A little on the long side.  Thin so good for summer rides.  Padding kind of minimal.
3.0,I was hoping for something that would work for me
3.0,Little cheap looking but it will do
3.0,Too small for me. Had to give it to my oldest daughter. Otherwise nice.
3.0,This is a super cute swimsuit and its true to size and fits well EXCEPT FOR THE STRAPS.  They are not adjustable and are very long.
3.0,Material is wierd...heavy and slippery.  graphics feel and look kinda cheap.  not very impressed with this one.  Much prefer the Guy Harvey line
3.0,"these are decent fit but are not lined with fleece or anything else, its just thick one ply material."
3.0,"My son loves it.  However, it is made very cheaply.  It came with a dead battery and blazes through batteries is a few months.  It is most certainly not waterproof and I wouldn't expect it to be weatherproof either due poor design.  That said, for the price, it was worth it as I stated earlier because my son loves it."
3.0,It's super tight and plenty assembly required
3.0,worn-out only one month later
3.0,It's cute and she'll wear it to daycare on her birthday but it definitely runs small.
3.0,"I love this skirt, but it is SO long on me. I am 5' 6&#34;, I ordered a medium and it was way, way too long even when I hike it up to my belly button. The material and quality is wonderful though, well worth the price!!"
3.0,It’s comfortable but too short.
3.0,"quality is low, but a good summer tank"
3.0,"I weigh 185  ,reordered medium ."
3.0,My 4 year old son loves these headphones. We bought these to protect his ears from loud sounds at the movies... my only complaint is the way they fit. I expected them to fit snuggly on his head and ears but they fit oddly and look misshaped
3.0,Smart but the cover is doesnt open that much to use it as a defense weapon.
3.0,The bottle fits fine the top is too big.
3.0,This product was sold at a convention for i think 20-40 bucks the tail is ok however the ears ruined the look from how freely the hairs want to move and they arent even the right size or shape it come in ssideways where as neko ears are forward like ears should be maybe ill cut it and try rounding the hair and finding out a way to get the ears to be straight
3.0,"I really like the face of this watch because I can see it, however, the band is way too small for me.  I have a petite wrist but this watch band would better fit a child.  I'm very disappointed :("
3.0,Like the dress. Very fun.
3.0,"yeah its probably time you guys realize that the top and bottom of wome aren't the same size anymore. while the top fits perfectly, the bottoms are tooo big. i probably needed to order another set in a smaller size in order to get the desired fit."
3.0,TIGHT. Headache inducing kind of tight.  But adequately made.
3.0,I like it! Shoulders are big and the neck area won't stay still.
3.0,I got these as a gift for my daughter.  They have not been opened yet to check and see how strong the chain is. They r pretty and the size I expected.
3.0,"Great value, no doubt. However, they do not contour to the cap whatsoever. They are straight as an arrow and no cap, or hat has that rigid shape. Give them a try but wary of that detail."
3.0,They're super tiny and the balls break easily but the colors are nice and you get a bunch so if you lose them like I do it was a good investment
3.0,Very cute and flowy dress.
3.0,Doesn't stay on well
3.0,"Print design is fantastic. Style of the shirt is consistent with the description in regards to hems, fabric, etc. But the size runs small, at least by one size. Vendor is willing to take a return, but is in the UK and I would have to pay for return postage, which is cost prohibitive."
3.0,"Very soft, but thin."
3.0,"They look nice, but my son still manages to crunch up the back!"
3.0,Nice look but bad fit. When put on one side is higher and sticks out from the face more than the other. Tried everything but can't adjust. Wasted money.
3.0,"The design is cool and the price is great, but these fall apart after like 2 weeks. The hinges are bound by a screw that will come out really quickly, and since it's so small it's really easy to lose. The lenses get easily damaged from scratches or otherwise. The last functioning pair I have has the mirrored lenses half rubbed off so that it's basically impossible to see. While they last, they're great to have, but you should probably invest in some better sunglasses."
3.0,"These are very tight on me but fit my 3 year old daughter perfectly. The quality is good, very soft and comfortable but too small. These would be good for slumber parties for younger kids not so much for women unless you have a very smal head. My head is of average size."
3.0,"In the photos I saw prior to ordering this bra was pictured as being a pale pink. The one I received is bright red, not pink (which, upon taking a second look, is also what the written description says, but I had been looking at the pictures). I decided to keep it anyway because it's still cute (I like the lace details!) and it was a good deal. The straps are nice and wide so they won't dig in. and it's decently supportive."
3.0,Piece across chest too loose.
3.0,Size much smaller than average.
3.0,So cute but a lot of the earrings broke off of the post. One arrived that way. Good news is it's easier to just glue it back on.
3.0,Breathes really well but length is a little strange.
3.0,"The shirt arrived soaking wet in the bag, drenched in some chemical that smelled like perfume. No response from the company to my message to them. After washing it it was itchy and strong-smelling."
3.0,I like the color but you can see through the material. It's also a little scary by on the skin.
3.0,Some seams not sewed together. And rather thin.
3.0,It's a nice hat but disappointed the day after I ordered the vendor dropped the price $3.00. I contacted the vendor and got no response.
3.0,"My sweet wife who had a stroke yrs ago and often fades away while sitting or watching TV loves this sleep cap but, frankly, it's too small for her. Good product w/ the flaps but a larger size would be better"
3.0,"The fit is much smaller for the size, perhaps because it is a unisex jacket.  It also zips on the side normally meant for girls, so my boyfriend would not wear it regardless."
3.0,Great product just runs small and it was a gift so it was too late by the time they got it to return it. She gifted it away to a smaller friend
3.0,Too much golden color..looks fancy..
3.0,"WARNING: &#34;one size&#34; is actually the same as M (medium). If I would have known that, I wouldn't have tried purchasing the blouse because I know that I am a L/XL according to the accompanying size chart. I really like the look and feel of the material. The material is mostly cotton, which is nice because I hate the static feeling you get from polyester shirts. It is comfortable, a little stretchy, and has a nice shine. You can definitely dress it up (business/party) or dress it down (date night/running errands)."
3.0,"The neck gaiters are good, but they were on the small side for me."
3.0,Does not work as stated.  I am a walker sometimes 3 hours at a time.  Glove looks great just does not keep you warm below 20 degrees.
3.0,"This bra didn't work for me (36DD + gravity - ha!). There are a mix of reviews saying it does work for D and DD cups and that it doesn't work. I'm one that it doesn't work for. I have a feeling that it depends on the shape (and perkiness?) of your DDs. Although I will say, on my boobs the &#34;cups&#34; seemed far too small. Also, I'm a total newbie at adhesive bras so that was probably a factor. Great case that it comes in and the adhesive seemed to work well – I just couldn't do anything with it!"
3.0,They came apart to easy very cheaply made
3.0,"Good quality, could be a little bigger."
3.0,Not the material I expected. Very lovely dress over all
3.0,Stamps fall down no matter what you do
3.0,Decent enough. For price is fine. Thin. Perhaps too many eyelets. But again good enough.
3.0,More for children's play. These are like some type of metal that is sprayed gold. The plain gold rings are like wire that you can open and close. I kept one on too long and my finger turned green. Cute idea and fun.
3.0,"I love the charms on this necklace they are really cute, but after only wearing this for two days it has started leaving a green ring on my skin. I will have to find a better chain to wear it on."
3.0,"it is not ruby at all. Totally hot pink. not ok but for the price, i guess i'll keep it"
3.0,"It is cute but doesn't really look as &#34;thick&#34; as the picture implies, it's see through and a little flimsy, but still cute!"
3.0,Not great item
3.0,"Although this is a nice suit, great fabric and well made. It did run big on the bottoms and very small on the top. I had to return it ."
3.0,Tall but not wide.  It is very tight accross the chest and belly.
3.0,Definitely size up.  This dress will also be rather short on taller girls.
3.0,"Not all earring pairs share same color. Otherwise, thumbs up"
3.0,"The masks pictures look to be shaped to fit the face, the actual masks are WAY too big and don’t fit snug to the face."
3.0,It was bigger than I expected.  There is a small dark stain on the front.  Will be returning this item.
3.0,The material is thin and very loose and I ordered a small. I’m 135 lbs and 5’9” and it’s way to big. If your any smaller than me I wouldn’t recommend. It’s somewhat like the picture but some of the pattern doesn’t line up (pictured)
3.0,"Ordered a size 5, and they just managed to fit.  Order a half size up if you want them to fit for longer than 2 months.  The lights also can be a little finicky at times."
3.0,size runs a little small the bottom has no grips its like a slippery black flat soul that doesnt hold up to well if you have nails sticking up in the floor it cuts the bottom right away
3.0,"nice design, but is somewhat large"
3.0,theyre cute alittle too small though
3.0,"This belt has no stretch at all, it's hard stiff metal belt. it does look like the picture but so not how it was described."
3.0,"To me is more like a shirt, not a dress..."
3.0,It came with a tear hole on the collar! Not cool! Didn't notice it till I wore it for the first time!
3.0,This is really cute but very cheaply made.
3.0,"I didn't want the double thickness of a regular NATO strap, so went looking for a single strap (like a 3 ring Zulu) but elastic (like the MN Parachute elastic bands).  So when I saw this, I thought this fit my requirement to a ""T"".  It fit great with my watch, and it was super comfortable while securely holding my watch in place (a Casio Edifice).  The only downside was that after only wearing it for a day, the adjustment hole where I had the clasp prong in had frayed,  Like others have written, you can take a lighter to it to melt it down and possibly prevent further fraying, so we'll how long this solution will last.  Even though comfort is 5 stars, the question on durability and how long the stretch will last has me bringing this down to 3 stars especially since it cost around $20 (w/ tax).  As time goes on, and I continue to wear it, then I'll provide an update.  BTW, the fit for me on my 7"" was perfect to where I could still tuck in a little portion of the end back into the band ring.  If your wrist is any bigger, then you probably won't be able to tuck it back in, but it will also depend on what watch you put on this strap."
3.0,"Sometimes when I get something in person I wonder what in the world I was thinking. That's the case with this shirt. After putting it on, it looked like I was ready to head to a Little House on the Prairie convention. There's not a chance I'd wear it anywhere. Aside from looking ridiculous in it, it has a super loose shape. It's meant to be flowy, apparently. (It would probably look better more fitted.)"
3.0,"Kid loved it.  Worked great for a month, then began having small problem.  This is a knit hat.  The ear flaps (which include the air bulb you squeeze to inflate a small bladder that lifts Elsa's ponytail) are knit, therefore as your kid uses / squeezes it, they  will stretch and lengthen.  Soon the flap has stretched to the point that the bladder that lifts the ponytail slides out and has to be manually manipulated / threaded back into the ponytail about once a week."
3.0,"To small, besides there great for the price"
3.0,Tear drop broke after the first day but its super cute.
3.0,Slip off their little feet.
3.0,It would be nice to see the inside as well
3.0,Dress is great looking. Runs very small...
3.0,"When I received these in Large i was excited to try them, until i realized that the Large is not large enough to fit on my large calves. I'm a plus sized gal, but still active and on my feet all day.  They are made high quality and look like they would be an excellent product if they just were big enough. :(<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
3.0,"Had to return for another size.  Runs big, but I like the material which is why I ordered it again in a smaller size"
3.0,Product was what I expected yet they fit so weirdly large like the are meant for a stuffed bear. Lol
3.0,Looks like the filigree was stamped from a machine.  Rough edges -- no finesse at all!
3.0,Nice but the week beads were either too small or needed more space between them. Very hard to use by older people or those with bid hands.
3.0,Nice quality but the nose is huge and sasquatchlike
3.0,Fits right and is soft but I didn't realize how unflattering this type of cut is on a guy (in my opinion). The back feels and looks very feminine to me for some reason.
3.0,The back of the gages do not fit properly they dont tighten so it falls out its only on the black and sliver pairs with the jewels
3.0,"Was disappointed that the colors are not as bright as the picture. They are still pretty, but wish they colors were like the pictures listed."
3.0,Silver plating was faulty in some spots
3.0,This was returned as it was too small for the recipient!
3.0,"They do help with moisture, but don't stay put very well.  However, I can use them to go walk/workout, then remove them easily, so my bra isn't all wet."
3.0,"The high waist band is great while standing still but the minute you bend down or sit, the waist band rolls down. It’s a constant battle all day to keep pulling them up."
3.0,Cute but pins were falling off.
3.0,"I needed an extra bag and bought this based on the reviews and measurements. The bag was way too small,straps not as expected but you get what you pay for. Rather than send the bag back I gave it to my daughter. She puts her extra items in here for school, usually her breakfast, coffee, cell phone and earbuds for her technology class."
3.0,The legs are not stretchy. It has a fixed size from a stitching that goes around each leg once it snaps by putting your leg in the are comfy. But they used the wrong thread possibly drastically shortening the life of the underwear
3.0,"Style is fine, look as pictured and described, fit comfortably, but quality isn't great."
3.0,They are okay but not the best.
3.0,This is NOT a choker unless your neck is huge but it’s a cute necklace. Kinda heavy so it hangs without the diamonds showing I mean it’s a good purchase just not what I was expecting out of the choker
3.0,It's not AUTHENTIC AFRICAN FABRIC BUT IT IS CUTE and I like the price. It provides the look I want without the added expense. I'm looking forward to wearing it soon!
3.0,"I ordered this shirt in two different sizes for two boys. I ordered them the same shirt so there would be no arguing about who got the better shirt... well, the shirts came in and they are completely different shirts. The design is the same, but the fit, style and material is COMPLETELY different. And of course, one is nicer than the other. The child large is more of an athletic shirt material, while the medium almost looks like a women’s style T-shirt. They’re both fine shirts, but it’s disappointing considering I needed two of the same shirt:/"
3.0,I loved how it looks but it is completely sheer and tapers around the middle. I would've kept it if it did not taper.
3.0,"The mask is pretty ok, it fits nicely and looks good, but it broke not 30 minutes after i wore it<br />ill have to try to super glue it back on"
3.0,"Ok, the purpose of the shirt is &#34;compression&#34; so if that is what you want you will definitely get it with this.<br />I normally wear an M or L so after reading other reviews I went for an 2X since I do like a little room since I usually layer up.......well, I can barely breath and my arms are basically suffering strangulation.......The material and colors are beautiful."
3.0,It was cute but I’ll be returning it as it is too small for my wallet and phone.
3.0,Good quality but poor sewing technique. This is why I gave it three stars. I'm having to see it up myself.
3.0,"Es un vestido muy lindo y cómodo pero el material se pone feo Despues de un par de días de uso, se salen motas"
3.0,"I got a medium and I'm swimming in it - most annoying part is that my feet don't stay in the feet.  I'm 5' 7"" and almost everything I buy is medium.  Trying to shrink it in the dryer lol.  Kinda static-y, but not so bad it's annoying.  It's fleece after all, could be worse."
3.0,"I want a beanie to protect my head from the sun. I have quite a few but this one fits the bill the most: light, very comfortable and offer UV protection ( I hope). Problem: after I hand washed it ( very gently and laid flat to dry) the beanie has become so loose it does not fit any more and it looks ridiculous on my head. I wish it could retain its shape after washing so and can buy many more. Otherwise it’s kind of expensive as a disposable one"
3.0,Wished I had not ordered a larger size like the reviews suggested. I’m normally a small/med and could have worn the small. Nice sweater though.
3.0,I bought this and it is way thinner that 16g like advertised.
3.0,"I would not recommend buying this item simply because the fabric is not that fitting, it’s not the most comfortable on a warm day and it’s not that cute in this particular color. Wouldn’t get this again"
3.0,Product is ok nothing exceptional
3.0,Dress is very thin like a tshirt but frumpy so order size smaller
3.0,"It was a bit bigger on the top around my boobs, but my friend wore it and she looked amazing!  Really well if you have larger boobs.  The skirt was longer than I though it would be."
3.0,"Strap is extremely long, as though they didn't want to make a women's and men's size so they just gave it a super long strap and expected everyone to wear the same one. I normally wear a normal size watch band or bracelet so I ordered a small size band, but it's on the next to last hole out of 12 holes. Since the strap wraps so far around under my wrist, it makes the Fitbit sit too far to the outside of my wrist, so when I lift my arm to look at it, I need to rotate it awkwardly far inward in order to see the top of the Fitbit. And the holes go too far to the end of the strap so if I cut it, it would be cut in the middle of the holes and probably look even worse. Other that the stupidly long strap, it is fine. I like that it is tapered rather than wide the whole way around like my previous strap, and the fake leather doesn't look too bad. You can tell it's not leather, though, in case that matters to you. The Fitbit fits snugly into the frame, and the metal is all rose gold and looks very nice, with a week of wear so far."
3.0,The Jean was thin felt like very low quality. The zipper does not hold up it was horrible I would of had to replace this zipper to wear these.
3.0,This is a thin terry cloth material
3.0,*Updated*<br />Sadly after a short while I've become allergic to this and can't wear them anymore : (<br /><br />Exactly as pictured. Got loads of compliment. No one believes it's so cheap
3.0,"Cute , fits nice but starting coming apart after 1 wash"
3.0,Nice colors and even not to bad of fabric but honestly go to a fabric store buy whatever fabric you want and make your own.. it's a crampy stich job.. you could do a better stich by had in 5 mins because it's just a long piece of fabric with its ends stitched together
3.0,"I ordered based on the actual waist and hip measurements provided in the product description, even though the size was much larger than I usually wear. Well, I should have just gone with my usual size, because the skirt was way too big."
3.0,It should keep the bugs away but it's a lot more delicate than the one I use. Handle with care or it will tear.
3.0,"I purchased this jumpsuit for my Halloween costume. When I tried it on it was not what I expected. The legs were skin tight, they were lose. The product is stretchy but not that stretchy. I have a big bust and the zipper went below my boobs. I recommend not wear anything that will leave panty lines Bc they are very noticeable.  I would say it has its pros and cons."
3.0,"Did not come with the headband bow in the picture but with a clip bow ...my child does not have enough hair for a clip on, which is why I wanted a headband bow...but outfit is still cute."
3.0,"The Black/Gray band connecting end is flipped on the wrong side which causes it not to securely connect. I've taken pics to show the defect, and I will be reaching out to the company about this. Other than that I really like the band so far as far as appearance, fit and colors. Once I get a replacement I will be updating my review."
3.0,Looks like the picture. But it's to long at the bottom and the top part didn't fully cover my bar I kept having to put it up.. I'm 5'7 260
3.0,A little too short and tight.  I'll have cut the hand part to go further up my arm.
3.0,"I ordered Men size 9 to 10.5 for my hubby but received 39 to 40, which is EU size and equals to Women US 7.5 to 8 or Men US 5.5 to 6 according to the size chart provided in the production description. On the other hand the slipper runs very small. I am Women 6 and I could wear it. It fits Women 6.5 or 7 but definitely not 8. The slipper is pretty comfort though. I will keep it for myself coz I don't want to go to UPS to return the package during the pendemic."
3.0,"I like this jumper, fit as expected. Very cheaply made garment unfortunately."
3.0,"cute cute cute!  but one of the bunnies was not attached and I had to use gorilla glue to reattach.  I also sprayed with water repellant, no problems there.  my 5 yr old granddaughter loves these boots, but I'm noticing that the durability might be less than expected since I already see krinkles above the heels after her wearing them for just a short time.  kids are hard on shoes, hope these wear well."
3.0,"These pants were way too large, even though I ordered the same size I usually am, 6P. The material was weird too, it felt like that cheap polyester stretchy material that I feel like looked too cheap for work."
3.0,Very large frames. Look super cute but smudge extremely easy.
3.0,The size was perfect for a child and easy to adjust. The clips are hard to press to attach to the id badge. Also one of the straps came detached from the clip and unable to repair.
3.0,Fits great but a little too long. I’m not a fan of tucking in and this shirt is too long not too
3.0,"Es un bolso pequeño lindo, pero la calidad no es buena, sin embargo por el precio que pague es aceptable."
3.0,"These chukkas are beautifully crafted of superior materials,  but I'd have been better off ordering one half size larger than I normally order in Fryes. I should have sent the 10.5 size back for 11's, but I figured they were a moccasin construction and would stretch more than regular boots. I ended up using repeated applications of shoe stretching spray, which has improved the comfort level considerably. The bottom line is that these chukkas run small, so I'd advise anyone ordering them to act accordingly."
3.0,"This shirt is a bit odd.  The material is not ""soft"" as advertised exactly, it is more of an athletic material, super stretchy / springy.  Which is great for athletic wear, but I got this to wear with jeans, and it doesn't feel quite right.  It also runs big - I got the smallest size, S, and I'm hoping it will shrink if I high heat dry it, otherwise, it just looks funny hanging on me (I realize it says ""loose-fit"", but loose doesn't really match the style wtih the neckline).  I do like the strappy neckline, but overall, a bit of a miss for me."
3.0,Very pretty but larger than I imagined
3.0,"Fits nice open, a bit snug closed if u have big boobs ."
3.0,It ok for the price... the skirt doesn't fit me all flowy like the picture...but I'm going to wear it for the 12.99 lol...Im wearing a 2x...
3.0,I thought they would be a bit bigger than the picture showed.  Still cute and will be able to use them for what was intended just wish they were a bit larger in the ears
3.0,I did not like the lace it didn’t look the same in person as online so I sent it back
3.0,It’s ok but the material feels rough. It isn’t soft.
3.0,I would give this dress 5 stars because the color is gorgeous it fitted just as it does in the photo BUT it is COMPLETELY see-through!  I had to shop for something to go under it.  It is a tad bit long but not so bad that I had to hold it the entire night (I'm 5' 1/4&#34;).  If you're looking for a cute inexpensive sundress this is not the best choice but it is an acceptable one if you don't mind spending more money to get something to wear under it.
3.0,It was huge!!!! I bought it for my daughter who is usually a small but it would fit me (usually a medium) with room left. I’m 5’4”
3.0,A little bit smaller than I like
3.0,"Still too itchy for me, but that’s typical wool. Returned"
3.0,Very cute dress but the strap ripped the first time I wore it. Recommend reinforcing the straps before wearing.
3.0,"Skip this if you’re larger than a C cup. 36D and the smocking didn’t even cover my whole chest, which made it VERY unflattering. Love the pattern though, sad it didn’t work for me. Bought “white” and it’s a beautiful rose/coral floral with olive green."
3.0,Like this a lot . Fits the way I like . Love pockets . Fabric is pretty thin . Beware .
3.0,As advertised....
3.0,A lot lighter than the picture.
3.0,I ordered this as my mom's mother of the bride dress in a 16 (she's a 14). We like the dress but the sizing is small (I find that a lot with garments made in Asian countries!). We returned it and ordered a larger size.
3.0,Poor casting looks cool from a distance but up close the casting is really bad<br /><br />Update: it’s not the casting it’s the platting that’s already coming off
3.0,This dress arrived promptly from the seller.  The fabric is very thin and almost see through.  I would not recommend this dress.  It was big and sloppy looking.
3.0,Ordered &#34;grey&#34; but definitely got a brown wallet. Bigger than I would prefer.
3.0,"if you dont already have a butt, it wont give you that lift, instead will flatten it"
3.0,Cute. Worth the $.
3.0,"The item is mostly as described, however it is shorter than the first two pictures in their gallery (which appears to be a photoshop of the same image as dozens I've seen online - digitally lengthened for this item). It goes maybe four inches above the knee for me, although sizing can vary the site says. Also, size 4 / small is huge. I was hoping it would be be a bit smaller.<br /><br />The material is not really soft and is thin (I can very easily see through the white label), although light weight might be your sort of thing. It feels light and cheap, looks that way as well.<br /><br />It doesn't smell at all, so I'm going to try wearing it a few hours and see if I change my mind. IMO I think $30-35 is a bit much to pay for this little bit of Chinese? fabric. On the plus side, it did come with a free baggie, although I'd rather have a better garment."
3.0,"The material is very clinging, so it’s meant for small people!"
3.0,"The leopard coloring was more pink in color and looked ""fake"".  Large was very large, with the cowl neck being extremely long creating a thick, cowl neck."
3.0,cute but runs.......gigantic
3.0,size to small gave to friend fit perfect
3.0,"It's pretty, but doesn't have the same form fitting style as shown in the pictures. I even wore it with my VS Bombshell bra and it was a bit loose. It is lined around the chest so it's not see through there, but it is slightly see through elsewhere. It'll look nice with something over it, but on it's own it doesn't fit well enough."
3.0,It nice but not what I'm expecting it
3.0,It was too small so I returned back.
3.0,SOMETHING IS JUST OFF BUT  IT.
3.0,Product was a gift for a young girl.  She liked it.  The only complaint would be that the stitching (especially around the pocket for the hands) doesn't hold up well under regular use.  We have had to sew it up a couple of times.
3.0,"The material is very thin (be aware!) and longer than I thought. I am 5'9"" and the mediums went to my feet. The cleaning instructions recommend dry cleaning but I washed them like my other clothes and they are still fine. I wanted skirts to wear under my winter skirts and these are barely ok. Only buy them on sale. When I bought them they were about $10 each which is about right."
3.0,"Very cute dress, nice blue, and outer velvet material felt nice but inside material felt scratchy.  One of the flowers fell off when taking out packaging.  Decided to return it and not because of the flower.  Even with the scratchy feel you can wear a slip but it felt like barely can walk because the bottom is closer in at the knee.  I guess to have that curve appeal.  That's good if you will stand or sit all day but if you going to walk (which you will need to because you're not a mannequin) unless you walk naturally like penguin or duck.  Then the dress is for you.  Try it because every body shape is different."
3.0,These pants are not what I expected. They do not have a stretchy waist. I thought they would be of a stretch like fabric. Too expensive.
3.0,Much thinner than anticipated.
3.0,Very flimsy and awkward shaped.
3.0,"Items were bigger than I expected. The 8mm seems more like a 10mm. Maybe just due to the thickness of the rings. Overall, they are sturdy and easy to latch and seem to stay latched well"
3.0,My granddaughter had to return this because it was too short for her.
3.0,"Been using for a couple of months. It's not bad for the price that I paid, but I had expected a higher quality leather."
3.0,It was 2 small<br />I return it
3.0,"This dress is cute and simple with a very thin stretchy fabric, but I’ve seen dresses identical to this one at local Chinese import stores, where they cost about $12-$20. That’s what I would pay for this, since there’s virtually no construction detail—just a thinnish tube of fabric gathered by rows of machined elastic at the bodice and a very simple, minimally gathered flounce at the hem. It’s nice, just not a great value."
3.0,"its ok, looks nothing like the photo though"
3.0,Made to fit a very small head.
3.0,"Pendant arrived quickly. The pendant is much bigger than I expected with a thicker chain, but I blame myself as I did not pay attention to the product dimensions. I, too, was looking for something dainty and feminine. I need to read the description better. There is also a blue gem on the top of the TARDIS that I did not see in the image. But as it is, it is nice looking and fun. May be useful as part of my cosplay outfit, but won't be wearing it on a daily basis due to its size."
3.0,"Okay is a good description.  While, I liked (notice past tense) the purse just fine, it took a while for me to get it.  I understand international shipping, etc. but still.  Once it arrived I used it for about a month before one of the shoulder strap hook attachments came off the purse.  Using it with just the handles was not for me so I ended up throwing it away.  While it could be used as a shoulder bag, I enjoyed it.  Great grey color and good size.  Wish it had lasted longer."
3.0,I was happy when I got but them I noticed that 2 Paris  of the set  one of the ones that had the metal on top was feed  a little  and the one that have the wood black piece come apart I have to glue it back on but the are very pretty..
3.0,still was nice just to small
3.0,This was a gift to my daughter and I had to go buy a new chain as the chain that came with it was like a choker chain.
3.0,"Its too heavy for everyday but I as jewelry so you don't have to give up wearing your tracker, it works."
3.0,"The deep V is flattering, however, for less busty girls, this swimsuit may be an issue & cause an instant nip slip. I don't recommend this especially if you plan to go swimming in the pool."
3.0,"The earrings are okay, they're noticeably different colors, one is very blue and the other is very green. Not bad for the price though, I will still be wearing them. The necklace has a nice stone, but the plastic around it and the chain are definitely very tacky. I mainly bought this for the earrings so I'm not too bothered about the necklace."
3.0,I didn’t realize the bracelets had spelling/grammar mistakes
3.0,"These earrings are bigger than I expected. Although nice looking, I find the ""tinkling"" noise the chain makes (bead suspended on chain) on the outter shell of the earring annoying. The french wire is also has a very sharp/pointy edge.  For the price, I was expecting more."
3.0,"I was disappointed to discover after only one day's use that my clogs were defective.  The top part of the inner side of the right heel was not properly attached to the sole, and after wearing for a short time the two sections became separated."
3.0,"The pants don't have a drawstring and the shorts dont have pockets. It fits well, and the fabric feels nice. However, it's impossible to use the pockets because without a drawstring the pants will fall down with even just a phones weight."
3.0,"I had to order 3 sizes! I read reviews that said it ran small which wasn't true. I feel that it is made for tall women. I had a hard time getting things where they were supposed to be ;) I had to go with the smaller size to have the top fit better around the chest and then let the bottom hooks undone (lucky enough the cape covered that). Also, it does rip easily so be careful. It was a hit (although I was disappointed nobody knew I was supposed to be she-ra ;)"
3.0,Did not fit— too small
3.0,It was  ok.Just barely fit.
3.0,Not a very good value considering it's just gold-filled.  A skilled shopper can find 10K or 14K of this weight for not much more than this one costs.
3.0,"the necklace is fine, however, I placed the order on Sept 25 and it didn't arrive until Nov 7"
3.0,It heats water up pretty quick. the built in igniter is nice because you don't need matches.
3.0,"This bra runs small.  I have some of the same style in the white and grey color, in the same size, but the decorative ones, like this, are definitely smaller.  I was disappointed about that since I have been so happy with the sizing of the solid color ones."
3.0,"The bathing suit was ok, but not the color in the picture. The top was close , but the bottom orange."
3.0,"I like the pants, but already starting to fuzz & wear out. I have only had them for a month or less. :( Maybe it’s the quality of pants, but that part concerns me. Fabric? Smooth nice fabric, but wears out easily."
3.0,"Need inexpensive cleats?  These fit the bill.  If you're looking for shoes that allow your feet to breathe and are super comfy, maybe not the best option.  I use these for adult kickball.  Our fields are more often than not muddy, and these do a good job of giving added traction.  The outside does clean up easily and I don't have any major negative points with these shoes, but there also isn't much to jump up and down to tell everyone else about either."
3.0,Ok but not special.
3.0,Hat was restrictive without adjusting to size. Material was bery stiff.
3.0,"These were way to small. Much smaller than the other pairs I purchased. Love the concept and colors, but this particular pair did not fit."
3.0,"The material is pretty see through and is hard to get wrinkles out of. Ordered for baby shower and tried on, it was okay but still haven’t worn."
3.0,I really liked packaging and presentation
3.0,"The material is very thin, not what I expected. The dress is shorter than advertised. The color is good. This is a nice spring or summer dress for casual attire."
3.0,The fit was good for my 12 year old girl. The material was a bit thin. She wore it yesterday so I’m waiting to see how it holds up in the wash...
3.0,This ring is not as pictured. Different style. The turtles look different and does not have mama loves you on it.
3.0,The straps need a little more velcro to be able to tighten better for the kids with skinnier legs.
3.0,"Cute and nice fabric, but have to return due to the sleeve being too tight."
3.0,This is a very nice looking coin from the movie but it has no weight to it. It feels almost like plastic. I do have other similar coins that have some real weight to them. Like I said it does look nice.
3.0,The color is pretty and it is nice and soft.  Was a little surprised at the raw edges.  I hope they aren't too difficult to hide when wearing it.
3.0,Ok for driving in low light cloudy days. Anything with sun and they don't provide any protection for your eyes.<br />Not sure they would work good for fishing unless cloudy or raining.
3.0,Very pretty but it's see through.
3.0,"The material is very thing and  lightweight. It almost feels cheap. But when I put them on they look good and slightly comfortable. I have mixed feelings about this product. I received this product for free, or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
3.0,Great product. The only issue is that the gold coloring does faid and leaves ring marks of it around your fingers.
3.0,Its beautiful but my goodness I'm not sure if ill ever be able to wear it.
3.0,I purchased four dresses for my daughter.  This is the only one we had to return because it was 3 sizes smaller than the tag read.  She purchased a 2XL and it looks like a medium.
3.0,"This biketard fit great, however it is completely see through!  I got the blue with stars and you can see underwear clear as day. Do not recommend"
3.0,I do not like the latch.  Cheap looking.  Wish this came in actual band sizes.
3.0,I am 5' 2&#34; and dress was waaaay too long for me so I returned it.
3.0,"these work great but a couple of them were faulty and wouldn't snap.  When they do, they are easier than using a regular belt for kids who can't undo and redo a regular belt."
3.0,Really doesnt offer any compression was disappointed
3.0,They are short in the thumb for the hand size so the fabric pulls tight and affects your grip when 4 in hand playing. I also had to sew then on two fingers after an hour of playing as they weren't manufactured well at all.
3.0,Too brighter then photo. Look fake but not cheap. Pendent is bigger than appears on the photo.
3.0,"Good quality garment, just way smaller than stated."
3.0,I loved this and it fit true to size but the stitching ripped after washing (not drying) it once
3.0,"These glasses came sized in Medium and Large. I ordered medium, thinking the large size was for men and the medium for women. Wrong!!! The medium was so large the glasses literally slid off my face! They would easily fit a good-sized man. I wonder who the large was designed for!? Anyway, I returned them, sadly."
3.0,"Cute shorts! The fit is off. Shorts fit in the waist and length was fine, but they were tight in the thighs. I'm about 5'3&#34; 145 pounds. My thighs aren't crazy big or anything! But these were so tight in the thighs that they were uncomfortable. Also I was nervous to order acid washed style but they were super cue in lerson"
3.0,"Love these goggles and have many adult pairs for my kids.  Saw these kid ones and got excited.  Well I still love how they work by clipping on in the back, the strap is very small.  They barely fit on my 5 year olds head and even cutting it close for my 2 year old.  Love how the lenses are smaller compared to the adult ones but due to the tightness even on the biggest setting I would say just go with the adult ones."
3.0,"Liked this bra first time I wore it, but the padding crunched up in the wash."
3.0,The material for these pants is super soft! The material stretches well and the pattern makes it difficult to see panty lines unless you're looking for them. My only real issue is the legs don't seem long enough and ride up to an awkward length (not long enough but not short enough to be capris).
3.0,"These are pretty and easy to put on. You just pull them open and squeeze them closed into the tube. No backings, no screws, no beads. These are &#34;regular&#34; sized earrings, and not a larger gauge for stretched piercings.<br />The edge of the larger part can be sharp and uncomfortable sometimes. I just rotate the earring"
3.0,"Nice looking, but material is not as heavy as expected."
3.0,"The watch is very pretty.  First time I wore it the pin fell out.  Had to pay $18 to get that replaced.  My biggest concern is the clasp doesn't stay shut.  It comes undone about 4-5 times a day, sometimes just one side, sometimes both and I'm worried it's going to fall off and get lost."
3.0,Very pretty but very sheer!
3.0,This is already turning colors. I love this piece but I can't wear non rusty color necklace
3.0,It was really cute but it was made with really thin cheep fabric.
3.0,"The dress is cute & I'm ok with it. However on the description it says it's cotton & that is the main reason I ordered this specific one & not one of the others that are exactly like it. It is NOT cotton, it's rayon &/or polyester. Bums me out cuz I really wanted cotton since I live in an area that gets to be 100 in the summer. This material will cause more sweat. Aside from the material I like it. Just won't be able to wear it as I thought due to the fabric. Plus there is no tag stating the type of fabric or washing instructions. Hopefully it doesn't have to be dry cleaned, I'd have to drive 20+ miles to a dry cleaners. After wearing the dress a couple times b4 I washed it I was going to take back most of what I wrote. I really began to love it & I found the washing instructions that said machine wash & line dry. I did exactly that in cold water & the dress shrank close to 3 inches on the bottom. Now the pockets lay right at the largest part of my hips & make me look awful. Plus the straps won't stay in place & slide. I'm so bummed cuz I was truly liking it. Also the tag says polyester & 20% cotton. Guess I'm stuck with it now & it's just a house dress!!"
3.0,It didn't fit any of my sunglasses. I ended up giving it to my little cousin.
3.0,The dress was cute but made more like a costume than a dress.
3.0,Zipper came broken but easily fixed.
3.0,I am 5’3.  190.  Ordered the XL.  Fit well the first couple washes and the material got nubby.  Did not use the dryer.
3.0,"They are cute little slippers but a little on the small size.  I purchased the large ones so my daughter would have them for a while and they just barely fit...so will need to get her something else.  The only other thing I can say is that they don't have that much cushion on the bottom.  Overall they are cute but with these things I wouldn't buy them again, unfortunately."
3.0,"I ordered the medium. I am 5'8'' 130. It fit, but not as well as I would had liked. the waist of the dress was too big, as was the space under the arm pits. I really like the dress though in terms of style and quality, so I returned the medium and ordered a small. Hopefully the small fits better."
3.0,Shirt fits perfect but the pumpkin lettering was a pinkish color instead of a bright orange. ☹️
3.0,"They are oversized glasses. That's what I wanted. Pretty cheap looking though, and broke within a month or so."
3.0,I got a small and it fits kind of baggy
3.0,"Runs small, will be fine in the summer"
3.0,Little too heavy for the plugs (which feel like plastic) but good quality. I just put my crystals on some sterling silver mandala plugs and they good to go.
3.0,I compared this belt with other belts that are size 46 and even though I ordered a 48 inch it was a lot shorter.
3.0,I didn't care for the material at all. Sent it back.
3.0,"Contrary to what others have written, the shoes I received were indeed Frye.  The leather was soft and good quality.  However, that is where my positive statements end.  I ordered my appropriate size based on other Frye shoes I own.  The minute I took the shoes out of the box I knew they would not fit.  Too long and too wide.  Returned and am not reordering.  Not willing to order multiple sizes or down-size and still not have it not fit.  The shoe isn't worth that much effort."
3.0,"The lenses do not darken or change to sun glasses,as quickly as expected. Also , the<br /> bifocal reading lens is down too far. I have had  non-prescription bifocal sunglasses before and never had this problem. They're ok for texting or looking at your phone but not for reading a book. Cute frame but a bit large. More frame options would be great!"
3.0,I have bought a few of these in XL and a few in L. Unfortunately the shirts you get may differ in how they are cut. I have some XL's I just bought that are different than the other XL's I bought a few months ago. Don't expect any sort of standard when buying these. Both the tags and cut of the shirt seem to randomly change no matter the size.
3.0,These fit so tight they almost cut off your circulation. Go a size larger if you want tight or 2 sizes for comfort.
3.0,"Bought it for christmas and realized the zipper is bad it wont stay zipped,cant return also i guess since i dont see a return option so that sucks...Nice sweater though im just hoping to fix the zipper issue.Its the bottom piece thats causing the problem so id take a look.."
3.0,"The shipping was very quick. The box the necklace and bracelet came in was very nice and heavy. Over all the necklace and bracelets quality isnt the best. They are very light weight and flimsy but you get what you pay for, so not bad for $20. Worn the jewelry doesnt look bad. I would suggest the silver one over the gold because the gold looks a little cheaper."
3.0,"This dress would be perfect if it were a little longer in the front and shorter in the back. I'm 5'6&#34; and got a small; even with flats, my feet are showing."
3.0,beautiful colors but fit a little too small
3.0,These run very narrow. Even in a size up they don't fit well and are painful after even a short ride. If you have narrow feet you'll probably love them.
3.0,Thin fabric and wide cut. Was an awkward fit so we returned it.
3.0,I think the eyewear needs to be a tad bit smaller for my face.
3.0,Very thin and hard to open it to put it on. Had it on for a week now and it hasn't broken yet!! So that's a good thing!!
3.0,"Too big, doesn’t stay on head while sleeping, feels kinda cheap"
3.0,"A casual sweater,fairly comfortable, it isn't one of those that you grab and squeeze and think - I can't wait to get this on.  .  However an XL labeled loose knitted, and it fits more like a L or possibly a M"
3.0,It is a very pretty shirt but I believe it runs small it was too tight on my arms also it is not stretchy at all so make sure you get it fitted perfect
3.0,great comfortable material but much smaller than other pajamas I have bought in the same size
3.0,I think these are Jrs sizes not women's sizes.  Can barely get them on even though I chose a size bigger.  Otherwise fine.
3.0,"Dress fit is perfect and i love the color, but being able to see through the dress (underwear and bra) limits the number of places this can be worn."
3.0,The bracelet has a nice aesthetic but the tightening strap broke within an hour. We had to fix it ourselves. If you purchase understand it may not last long.
3.0,These pj's are so soft... too bad the tshirts run small and short..
3.0,The product was on the small size for one size fits all otherwise nice.
3.0,Satisfied with the hat except for the size
3.0,Really great quality. 2 sizes too big. Ordered the right size but it runs GIGANTIC. They don't let you exchange or refund.
3.0,Fun to wear around the house. Not what I expected
3.0,"I ordered the size of undershirt I normally wear, and this ""slimming"" undershirt fits the same. I was expecting the fit to be more snug, but it is not.<br />I should've just ordered my regular shirts in a smaller size"
3.0,"The fit is perfect as is the color. My only complaint is that the image, after just a couple washings, is cracking off. Disappointed as it sort of ruins the effect of the shirt."
3.0,Cheaply made but still pretty. Don't like how lace attaches to sleeves at the top.
3.0,"After reading the reviews, I panicked and bought my 11 yr old son a 5x. A 5x is a extra large in men sizes. So it fit my son rather big, but it still loves it and so do I. I do recommend it but the sizes need to be edited to American/US sizing."
3.0,"I do like it but will have to get it tailored, it came so wrinkled up it doesn't lay right and looks really frumpy<br />They should have taken more care than to just stuff it in a plastic bag in a ball, now I will have to steam it or iron it before I can really fairly judge it:(( may return it still, for the price it should have been better presented to customer and in better condition, I shouldn't have to spend money to gave it steamed/ iron it or dry clean it to get it to lay correctly and not be all wrinkled. Also for a small it seems to run large."
3.0,I'm afraid I had to return them for stretching out after wearing them for a portion of the day. I'm hoping to exchange them for the next size down.
3.0,"I will be giving this to my lil sis! I’m 6’0, not heavy set but not super thin either. The bottoms barely fit! The top is supppper short on me. I’ll add a pic later. However I did like the quality of the the fit, it’s actually pretty cute. Just not made for tall ppl. I ordered an XL."
3.0,This dress is so georgous but it has no breast support (personal need) and the size is not accurate
3.0,Not the best looking after one wash. The sleeves and hem started to curl.
3.0,"I really wanted to love this. The arm for the right shoulder was looser than the left and kept sliding down. It must be worn with the straps but if the top elastic would have been made an inch or 2 smaller, it would have fit perfect and stay up WITHOUT the straps (which is what I wanted). I do not believe ordering a smaller size would have worked bc then my boobs wouldnt fit. I had to return for these reasons.<br /><br />Also not sure why my refund on a prime order is $5 less than purchase price?????"
3.0,Shirt fit everywhere but the bust.  I am a very large busted woman and the shirt still layed open and showed my bra.
3.0,"These things are small and difficult to put together.  That being said they are cute and while I like them, I'll never buy any more."
3.0,"Okay I'll start with the Pros of this one: seems to be made really well, and looks great on. I didnt have an issue with it fitting my ear like other reviews did (I was able to bend it slightly just to fit better but if I wasnt able to bend it, it would have still be fine.)<br /><br />Now the Cons: the description for this seems to be for a completely different product which at this price point I was willing to risk what I was going to get 😂 problem I have is this is just one ear cuff so if you're expecting a pair this isnt going to give you that. Also I ordered the silver color and received the gold option. It'll still work for the costume I bought to wear it with but kinda disappointed in the color when it's not what I ordered."
3.0,Not bad for the money.  My son is 7 and they were a little big but work.
3.0,The born to b real not perfect shirt was horrible. It was super small like child size.  Material was thin and cheap. Returned!
3.0,"(I bought the transparent gray-blue one) I bought it so i could use arms to put on broken ones. the plastic has all the right markings but it does feel cheaper as i read from other reviews, you can feel a pertusion along the top of the arm and it feels incredibly weaker than my original ones. (also the ones i had didnt say where they where made or they got deleted but im almost sure they said italy and these said made in china so maybe thats why) the frame also feels completely flimsy in comparison with my first one. Original ones i bought in a optic glasses store in Peru. I wasn’t expecting much as i was mostly buying for parts but still concerned by the quality difference."
3.0,I do t get the proportions.  I wear a size 9 abs these socks fit perfect except the pinky toe and next over are way too long.  I’m constantly ending up with those toes out.  Might just have to return these
3.0,Read that the product was thin like a sweatshirt but it was more like a T-shirt. To thin. Gave it to my daughter-in-law.
3.0,"It is a nice watch, however, my eyesight is not what it used to be and the hands on the watch disappear in all the gears in the background.  The bail has come off so there is now nothing for the chain to attach to, probably my fault. It loses two minutes a day, but that is not a real problem if you are aware of it. It would be a good dress watch."
3.0,The cauldron is shoved in a box that it barely fits in so it was dented up when we got it but it is a great size and seems sturdy.
3.0,Way too short and the model is taller than I am...... I'm sure. It is definitely a blouse and cannot be worn as a dress bcaz of its length......off shoulder or not.....like the colour I choose so I will wear still
3.0,It os a bery BEAUTIFUL piece. On arrival i noticed the bracelet was in two pieces.  It had come apart. I am hesitant to wear it it seems like it might fall off. The piece though is beautiful the stones are very gorgeous. I may consider putting these into a different type of bracelet
3.0,"Gives a rich appearance, but the waist was unforgiving. 5'4&#34; at 165 lbs and it gave me curves in all the wrong ways. Ended up giving it to a taller, slimmer friend. Never heard back if they liked it or not. Would also fold across the front unless I held my posture weird.<br /><br />On the right body type, this dress is GORGEOUS. But on the rest of us.... there are issues."
3.0,"I love the softness, but these socks slip down completely into my shoe.  It's the nature of the fabric I suppose, and the fact that they are not knee length.  I was willing to try them, and I can use them for &#34;slippers&#34; around the house."
3.0,"Not very straight, goes off to the side."
3.0,I didn’t expect too much for the price but it’s a good value. I want to make these so o needed a constructed one to compare. It’s a bit costume like but it’ll due.
3.0,"I bought these shoes for business casual wear with slacks. They are comfortable, except that they are extremely tight on the top of my foot, like there is elastic that won't stretch. I want to love these, but I'm not convinced they are worth the money."
3.0,"I like this product for myself. I'm a 34 inch waist and it just fits me. I bought 3 to give one to my daughter and one to my husband so he could wear one while walking, or riding his bike but he is a 42 inch waist and even with the stretch it had, it didnt fit him. I have a samsung note 4 cell and I can get it in the pocket but have to stretch the zipper which I don't like to do. Better for small phones and waists. All in all it is an ok product and does what it says. Great for wearing them in amusement parks, but it really is made for runners with smaller phones."
3.0,"Rather flimsy. But for the price, well, cant really complain. The cristal is okm"
3.0,"since this item does not have the Sun Shield name on it as my previous glasses do, I feel this a knockoff and perhaps not as good quality as the original."
3.0,Expecting a firmer fit. Had to order something different today
3.0,These are light up sparkling shoes that my daughter loved to wear them. Only con is they did not last long. The lights strip came out and the shoes does not look good now. I don’t think these can be worn for outdoor play in water. I feel that’s the reason for the damage
3.0,I am re-ordering a size smaller but love the color and texture. Will need to pair with a strapless bra for extra support
3.0,There's no way to tell what color you're getting. Or if you can I didn't figure it out.  But other than that I love them.
3.0,"This product is just like the picture, the only reason I give it 3/5 is shipping time, they took forever to get to me. (They shipped from China I think) Other than that it’s a great product and looks as it is described"
3.0,"I had my doubts that this would even work, but it did. The problem is that it wraps around in the front, so if your dress is form-fitting, you can see the indentation."
3.0,"Only complaint lenses too large , not the size Lennon wore. Need to put diameter size in description"
3.0,"I wouldn’t use it if you are actually trying to protect yourself from something, but very aesthetically pleasing."
3.0,Hard to use for a 6 year old boy
3.0,Kinda scratchy. They are ok?
3.0,"I'm 5'7, typically wear M/L and these were too short. Also I felt the waist went way too high...that might have been the design but it was uncomfortable for me."
3.0,they are okay. Very cheep. One of them broke with in 5 minutes of practice. I am a gymnast i need them to stay on my face. Lucky they come with extras. I am using other one hoping it won't break!! thinking of buying another one. They are very hard to get on glasses. almost to hard. they might work for child size glasses.
3.0,Inexpensive but very nice
3.0,The are nice but my last purchase the trim separated from the fabric
3.0,Loved them but the back fell off and I lost one. Tighten the backs of you can.
3.0,"As expected, fits good."
3.0,It’s cute but rides up
3.0,"Theses were well made and arrived quickly.  I had to return as the XL was not large enough for me.  I liked the colors and construction was good,"
3.0,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas I knew it would not make it for Christmas. It was supposed to be here on the 31st of December we did not get it until the 6th of January. Other then being late my daughter loves them
3.0,The frame and lenses were light weight but the bridge was narrow and uncomfortable
3.0,Alright. Is what I expected.
3.0,I got a medium.im 5 ft 6 and about 135lbs. It seems really big when I put it on. I'm hoping it shrinks some in the wash.
3.0,Runs small. Needed 2 sizes bigger to be comfortable.
3.0,I normally wear a large in a bodycon or medium in a regular dress.  I order the XL in this and it fits fine but is too short.  Not great for tall women and the hemline lifted higher on the backside than the front when tried on and looks off.  It is a no for me.  I am 5'9 143lb
3.0,I'm only giving it 3 stars because the bags are smaller than expected. Haven't used them yet so I'm not sure how they will hold up. I will update once I do.
3.0,"I'm 5'4&#34;, 130lbs. Size C. The fit was absolutely spot on. The color is a gorgeous deep crimson...moreso than the image on amazon shows. The only complaint I had was the draw string tie around the neck to secure the top. Wish it was just attached strings or a clip hold. The puckering of the drawstring tie never laid how I wanted it to and kept coming undone with my hair."
3.0,Look good but foam padding is very small. They stiched on of the googles with a wrap in it. Like wtf. No even straight so no quality control.
3.0,"It's not the hats fault.  In person, the brim was wider than expected."
3.0,The watch was fine but too masculine for my wrist and was returned
3.0,Did not fit well at all. also stitching in back was loose.
3.0,The sweater is a bit heavier weight than I expected. But after once washing in cold water I put it in the dryer. Big mistake because it shank a bit. But still wearable around the house.
3.0,"I love the material, however it for odd around the shoulders. Almost like I feel I'm tugging at it to go forward even thought won't. I just use it as a house sweater."
3.0,I love this watchband but the side ripped out and is now unusable. I cannot figure out a way to fix it so it goes in the trash.<br />I am currently wearing the same band in another color. Hopefully it lasts longer than a week.
3.0,Liked the marble looks good but does not protect the phone completely camera is still unprotected 3you have to protect it separately also no screen protector the reuber at the end is loose does not fit well you get what you pay for
3.0,I wish they came with more plug ins.
3.0,"I had such high hope for this top!! The pattern looked so cute online, but the material is one of those nylon-y ones so when the pattern get's stretched out you start to see the white underneath. And my chest is busty, it would also roll up at the bottom so I had to keep adjusting it. This crop is definitely one I'll stick to wearing around the house"
3.0,"I loved it when it came, I’ve had it for a few weeks now and the string is already breaking. Going to have to take it off my phone."
3.0,"This item is listed as a small but it is not a small. It is more like a women’s medium. Also, it is not fitted as the picture shows. It is square and boxy. The color is great though."
3.0,"The fit is small ,order next size up.Quality is great."
3.0,Thought I aa
3.0,"This shirt is good looking. The black is nice and even, the white pops. The material is soft. Unfortunately the shirt, labeled and sold as an XL, is more like a size small. Which is sad because the shirt is everything else as advertised."
3.0,Party Shirt
3.0,The earrings are too big to put into the ears.
3.0,Good but lengthy
3.0,The material is already starting to ball up and I've only worn them a handful of times
3.0,It fit and looked alright but I think there are better versions. I couldn’t lift my arms all the way up without showing my belly. The neck line was also a little high for my liking
3.0,I like the like the style
3.0,Awesome glasses. Made for really small heads though. Bummed out about that
3.0,Needs lining lots of static
3.0,This is quite see through
3.0,"I like it - but I don't know if it was the most flattering, but still cute piece to have."
3.0,it looks cheap more for teenagers
3.0,"I bought this belt Jan 2017. Although it is a bit heavy, I like how it works. Sit down, push the button for a notch of extra room. Eat a little too much or gravity gets you by the end of the day, push for a notch or two. Tonight I tried to loosen the buckle and nothing! I thought I was stuck for ever! Fortunately, with some wiggling of the parts - the buckle, not mine - I was able to get some looseness then forced the other end to dislodge. Now I need a working buckle if I can get the belt loose from it."
3.0,I like the hat....but made in China.
3.0,"The pattern is cute, but whoever sewed it didn't do such a great job. The owl on the front has a chunk of its head cut off by the chest seam thanks to the poor positioning of the fabric, so, if you wanted an owl prominent, too bad. You get part of one.<br /><br />I ordered two sizes and both had this problem to varying degrees. Also, the medium sized dress seems to have been made incorrectly as the front of the dress has a vertical seam that travels the length of the skirt, right through the owl. I thought to myself that should have been done in the back then put on the large size and that one has has seam in the back instead..<br /><br />The fabric is weird and not pleasant. Feels very cheap and strange. Kind of like the smooth shimmer-shine of a swimsuit but with the inflexibility and toughness of cheap polyester.<br /><br />I'll likely return them. I wanted a cute owl dress for my new job and like the print a lot (it's actually flattering), but the poor quality of the fabric and construction I just don't think I can make do with."
3.0,The stones are too small. Not happy.
3.0,"This is a cute dress. I’m 5’5” 187 lbs and I typically wear a 16 or xl, sometimes a 14 or large in dresses. I ordered an XL. The chest was fine, but the bottom was sooooooo tight, I couldn’t wear it to work so I had to return it. Size up."
3.0,Material is is better than expected. But size is off. Runs a lot bigger for my girl and end up returning it.
3.0,"The legs on these are too long, way too long, I am 5ft 3.5 inches and these are not really petite.  Material is nice.  Light fabric though you can't see through it.  Kind of silky. I also asked for the v neck style and got the round neck anyway.  All in all - a bit disappointing, wish I'd gotten what I asked for. I will have to cut and hem the legs to wear them...that would cut off the ribbon detail on the bottom. Bummer.  Also - price should be about 15.00 less than it is. They are not worth the amount they are asking."
3.0,"nice BIG hat, but very floppy, cant wear to keep sun off face while working, better for fashion statement than practical use"
3.0,"Ordered for my kids (12,8,6 yrs old) they love it. Took along time to get here."
3.0,I like it and wear it a lot. But it's very cheaply made. I already had to sew the seam in the arm after 1 day. You get what you pay for with this one.
3.0,i know everyone said this is very small.... but i thought what the heck maybe it will work<br /><br />NOPE. honestly... if you are larger than a size 4 i would not recommend this.... if you have hips or a bubble butt regard less of your size i would not recommend it.... also it is also sort of short. so i think anyone taller than 5'5 should not get it<br /><br />it is not as full as the pictures... there is a lot less fabric there and it looks REALLY silly on me with my large hips the skirt doesnt even cover me - the slits are like open the entire time<br /><br />I think this would be perfect on someone who is 5'3 and a size 2 worn low on the waist/hips.... it would look so hot over a bikini - great for evening pool party type thing... if you are tiny - go for it! and the free returns thing makes it totally worth it to just try it on at least<br /><br />quality: it's not great... it looks pretty cheap - i wouldnt recommend one of the lighter colors because i think that will make the cheap stiching and fabric more apparent but on my black one it looked ok. for $12 i think it is worth it because it is very unique and it a nice design and i dont see anything like this out there<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review – For almost 10 years I’ve relied on amazon reviews more than anything else when buying items online and my assessment of the item is based solely on my experience using it and desire to help others buy the products that work for them! [if you found this review helpful click below - happy shopping :) ]
3.0,"Not much for padding, pretty disappointed,  but fit is good and comfortable"
3.0,"These hats are only 2 1/4 inches across. The true size isn't listed in the description at all. I thought these were the size of mini top hats that you buy for Halloween clipped to hairbands, or just clipped to your hair. They are always described as mini. These aren't mini, they are MICRO MINI!  They are even tiny on my 10 pound mini dachshund. It's a real shame because they are really cute, the only reason I gave them 3 stars. I wanted to decorate them some more and use them for steampunk costumes. These would fit on Tinkerbell. How about some truth in advertising? Very disappointed. Very over priced for the size."
3.0,It is okay but the side is not right
3.0,The bow is torn up by the white stitching of the bow.  The bag is beautiful but the ears are disappointing and I tried several times to contact support and got booted.
3.0,works great for light duty.
3.0,Has a cheap look right out of the bag. &  Fabric was much heavier than expected. Not cute.
3.0,Runs small. Order at least one size up!
3.0,I love the top but I should have bought a smaller size
3.0,"I thought the design was part of the pendant, but it's actually a picture under a glass bead."
3.0,"I am 4'11"" and 105# : The small was a bit tighter than expected. Returned item because this caused them to be uncomfortable. Higher wasted than expected. If you don't like to wear your pants at your belly button, buy a size larger than normal."
3.0,faded very quickly
3.0,"I can't even put my finger on why I dislike the feel of this material. It's a bit too thick for a t-shirt, but it isn't stiff. It's just not for me."
3.0,"I got the dress in beige plaid. Everyone said it looked like Burberry print. Yes, the plaid does not match up, but because of the cut and style of the dress, it appears as if that is part of the design, so it works. The fabric is thin. Depending on the conditions of the room and the color of your dress, you might need a slip. The dress was easy to slip on.  The belt it comes with is just a simple sash in the same pattern. It really need to be an inch wider so it covers the waist seam. I replaced it with a black suede sash belt that matched my boots, and it looked great. The look on my body, however, wasn’t so great. I’m average shape and size. It did my figure no favors. I personally think it best flatters figures a little bigger than average. It served its purpose for the day and I got compliments on the pattern, but I will probably give this away to a charity or a friend who will look great in it."
3.0,Thin and cheap.  Not what I expected. No comparison to previously purchased jockey pjs
3.0,"EVERYONE loves this watch when they see it on me. It's a beautiful watch for the price. Unfortunately, it's also a low quality watch. It worked fine for about 6 months, then one day I wound it, set it on my dresser, it fell off about 4 feet onto the carpet and stopped working. C'est la vie."
3.0,"My wife is normally a medium for things like this, but when I looked at the sizing chart, I decided I needed to buy a small. I'm glad I did, because even the small is really too big for her. Not so big that she can't wear it, but big enough that it really doesn't hang on her body well, with a less than ideally flattering appearance.<br /><br />Aside from the sizing issue, though, this is comfortable. The fabric is smooth and soft, and has a pleasant skin feel. I suspect that these would be favorites if they fit better."
3.0,Backpack is super nice looking and very roomy. But after one school year the netting on the side that holds a water bottle is completely ripped. For the price of this bag that shouldn't happen. My kid loves it though and we will see if we can get another year out of it.
3.0,Couple of the beads were detached
3.0,It's cute and I was so excited to buy this. It broke after the 3rd time I wore it. Also her head piece was attached upside down on the bracelet. Pretty disappointed
3.0,"The shirt is small in certain areas. Kind of a weird fit but does fit. The material is sort of cheap, reminds me of costume material."
3.0,"It's OK.  I felt like I was wearing a pajama top. And I didn't like the one sided fabric; it's whitish on the underneath. Not a fan of that type of material. The shape was fine, and it didn't cling. Just didn't like the fabric (black with flowers).  Wasn't too short, so that's good. I just didn't feel it was worth the money.<br /><br />I'm 5' 7"", about 180. And got the XL. Like I said, it fit fine, just not my fav material style."
3.0,They’re a little stiff and probably need years worth of washing it actually get “soft”<br />Embroidery is beautiful
3.0,"These aren't exactly like the pic in the product description. What you get is an image that looks like it was blown up and then blobbed on the material. Also, I washed them before wearing and a seam has already split on one. If you want the face of the skull to fit over your face you have to scrunch it up. Other than that these are okay."
3.0,"I am a size 38 chest.... yet, the size M gown had entirely too much fabric under the arms. Other than the alterations I had to make, I like the gown. But I would not buy it again unless modifications were made in the fit."
3.0,"This shirt came faster than the expected date, that gives the 3 stars. I got the XL but my slender arms couldn't fit in it. The color is also not as seen, the shirt is short length-wise. Sad I cannot waer this shirt, and cannot return it either."
3.0,"The keychain is cute, but the links broke after only one month. I probably wouldn’t purchase again as I expected more use !"
3.0,"Good construction, just didn't work for me, returned"
3.0,Looks loose on body. T shirt style has changed to be tighter in the arms and upper body in order to look better and make you look better. I don’t have a dad bod and don’t want a shirt that makes me look dumpy.
3.0,These are pretty short and nothing like my last Kirkland's I've ordered in the past
3.0,"It's not adjustable and is just too wide an opening for my nose to stay on. Plus it's a bit bigger than I thought (thick at the base with the gems). Very cute, but just ended up being too big for me."
3.0,I ordered a child's size by mistake so I gave it to my grandson.  He loves it.
3.0,"I purchased this specifically because it says ""Floating Eyewear Retainer"" While it looks really nice, vivid colors, seems pretty good quality, I did a test and it does not float! This is why I'm giving it 3  stars."
3.0,In the reviews i read...other buyers said the fit was small so i ordered XL. I am normally a medium. The fit is too large now but i wore it with a cami and it was fine. It is very roomy now and i could've gotten a large....possibly medium. Not so sure the reviews were accurate. I like the shirt but wasn't expecting heavy material as i had read other reviews. It is very thin But again...just fine with a cami.
3.0,Cute but not slouchy or oversized like I'd hoped and I got a size bigger.
3.0,This watch looks great but is truly small! Was hoping since it’s a spring type bracelet it would fit better but will work great on a young teenager or very small person.
3.0,"Not nearly as warm as I was hoping for.<br />Also, picks up lint like crazy, particularly from anything white or fuzzy...like a bathrobe.<br />Course, I have been using these outside...likely would work better indoors in a cold house.<br />Can't say that I would recommend."
3.0,Perfect size but its a tshirt quality
3.0,It ended up being about one size smaller than expected.
3.0,Small. If going in ear get help from someone or you may loose it trying to put it in. Came in in a very timely manner through the mail and even received a free earring.
3.0,"The color and design is great. However, the crochets design tears very easily."
3.0,It was I little bigger then expected.
3.0,I would have given them 5 stars but they need to be washed at least 15 times before they even begin to not leave your feet looking like you're still wearing them once you take them off.. massive amount of lint...
3.0,Some of the holes for the charms to slide on the bracelets were too small. So a lot of them I couldn’t use.
3.0,Runs very large- soft material
3.0,"Cute suit, but the material is thin and it is NOT lined."
3.0,"The band is ok, but the magnet isn't really strong, which means it is constantly getting loose and I am constantly tightening it. It also snags on clothes. I've ruined more than one shirt because of it. Needless to say, I'm going to see if I can find another one I like."
3.0,They are cheap looking
3.0,"everything about the wallet was good except for the slot to store your bills.  I couldn't tell from the photo, but the only place to store your cash is in the flip up part of the wallet.  I was expecting the top of the wallet to have an opening for bills, but no luck.  It seems very awkward to have to store your cash in the flip part of the phone.  I gave the wallet to my 15 year old son and he was happy with it."
3.0,Kid loved them but these were size 11 not 12 as advertised. It says 11 on the slippers but on top were stickers that said 12 (?). They are clearly size 11. Can’t return them because she put them on and won’t take them off.  But they will be too small for her soon.
3.0,"These swim shorts are made of a more flimsy material than I like. Also, they are not &#34;Full Coverage swim bottom in Modest & Attractive Look&#34;- instead they are cut short in front and back like boy shorts, so that if you bend over, things show too much"
3.0,"Awesome shirt, great quality.  Ordered an XL but fits like a medium"
3.0,I don’t like that they barely fit and I’m a size 9 women’s. I also don’t like the slick texture as I slide around in dress shoes.
3.0,Didn't love this - a little tight for me to wear to work.
3.0,I have a similar pair from wally world that cost $10 more that I have used over my regular eye glasses. I purchased these to replace but they will not fit over my glasses that are normal size so I can not use them gave them away.
3.0,Product seemed short for size. Good quality fabric
3.0,A bit longer than needed due to its strachiness. Could have gone one size if this was known.
3.0,Defective zipper.  Had to send it to replace before using the short
3.0,"It's a pretty bra, but too small. Should have listened to the reviews along those lines."
3.0,"Sorry, ladies, looks like I can't agree with most of the reviews for this tunic.  After reviewing the size charts and reading many many reviews, I bought this in an x-lg, which is the size I typically wear in tops.  While I'm not heavy or especially busty, 5'7&#34; and 155 lbs, I have wide shoulders which require a bit of extra room in shoulders, arms and bust.  This shirt swallowed me.  It is a very soft, comfy fabric which I really like, but the chest area and arm holes were way too large.<br /><br />For women who are larger upstairs, this may be good, but order smaller if you are smaller.  This will have to be returned.  I'm so confused on sizing that I'm not sure I will try another size in this.  I probably will pass on this and look for a different fabric or style that holds its shape and fits better.  BTW, the red is a beautiful, vibrant shade, really pretty.<br /><br />If you find this review to be helpful, please click &#34;yes&#34;.  Thanks!!"
3.0,I ordered some. It came in an orangey red colour. Not pretty on me. The necklace is also completely different than the photos and is more pink than red so out doesn't work with the shirt.
3.0,"Tamaño concuerda, el material no es algodón, le falta mejorar los acabados en las costuras del short"
3.0,"Nice product for $19.99, but I wouldn't pay full price as the quality doesn't appear to be in the 40-50 range."
3.0,The neck is heavily asymmetric - collar halves are not equal
3.0,The material is not at all what is pictured but I still gave it three stars because it’s not completely terrible
3.0,It's correct according to style. I just scratched my forehead with the interior every time I put it on. A rubber or plastic nose piece should be fit in the interior of the helmet to avoid this.
3.0,"I have had two hernia repairs and still have intestines that would rather be outside than in. Dr. wanted me to wear a belt so I tried this one. For many people this may fit what they are looking for but for me the band stretches to much. For a general support it would be fine, is well made and the velcro is good, but for someone with intestinal issues it may not be firm enough."
3.0,Not the material I was expecting.. it feels more like an athletic type fabric? Hopefully that makes sense. I was expecting it to feel like a normal crew neck like the picture. Nice and warm though.
3.0,"The bottom seems to fit rather strange - as in throw any modesty out the window, but I am wearing board shorts with it."
3.0,Cute but top part was to long for my short body and bottom half looked saggy.
3.0,"Loved them, but had to squeeze my feet in. I wish I  would have exchanged them. Other than the size issue, super cute!"
3.0,This item is not what I expected. It looks kind of cheap.
3.0,"I received this blouse for free. If I had paid for it, I would have returned. First, I don’t think the photo in the description is actually of the shirt I received. I think it is a cheaper version that is similar but the fit is just off. On top of that, the tag with the size and care information is on the outside instead of the inside. I’m 5’5”, 120 pounds, and usually wear a size small. I would say this shirt runs a little large, has no stretch, is lower quality than depicted."
3.0,When I saw these shoes online I was super excited about them. Unfortunately the shoes came and they were at least a size too big for my feet. I even worth it socks and they were still huge and I've ordered them exactly my size in all of the shoes. Quality seem good I love the lacing system and I would have kept them but I was in need of shoes right away so I had to buy them locally.
3.0,"This was super cute, but one of the shoulders was ruched and the other wasn't. The one that was ruched was very cute, but the other one had excess fabric and looked 80's in its puffiness. Had to return."
3.0,"Well this watch is exactly what it looks like in the photo. Unfortunately I'm assuming my watch was beat up on the way over by shipping because the side is cracked. I have a beautiful crack on the edge of the watch, it only is cracked over 8:00 but it is annoying to look at. Also slightly small looking on my wrist. Other than that it does its job."
3.0,The style of these are great.<br />I am 5'4 and the mediums were long tho.<br />Easy enough fix of you have the time.<br />The fabric is rather sheer so keep that in mind.
3.0,My fiancé didn't like it because the collar was too high at the neck. Otherwise it was a good shirt.
3.0,More impressed with picture than actual product.
3.0,"Fit is fine, sewing is off. One shoulder has pleating one doesn’t. Arms length is silly. Just not a winner"
3.0,"This dress is absolutely gorgeous however , there are definitely some things that need work. For one it’s super long, like too long. The panel in the back under the corset needs a snap or something to hold it in place. Other than that everything is great!"
3.0,the boob area is not built for full figures everything else fit fine.
3.0,"Fabric isnt great, but the cut & pattern are good. It runs small."
3.0,Was disappointed the towel was rough sticky feeling and my glasses broke top of lens and the company sent me another pair and I wore them once and the plastic  broke in the same spot as the 1st pair so I didn't figure id bother them again and they probably wouldn't believe it... cause I couldn't hardly believe it thought what is the odds of this happening 😞 so I gave it 3 stars because the company was nice and even said don't worry about sending them back just throw them away and saved me having to wait til they received it and the trouble of shipping it back
3.0,"The bag was very dirty at the top, dust or spider webs were all over the top of the bag and there is a small dark stain on the front, I tried to wipe off the dirt but then found the stain on the front and am probably going to return the item."
3.0,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE these glasses. I have a round face and most aviators In stores look too small for my head, these are perfection."
3.0,"They look cool for about 10 min and then the discomfort comes in, but if you don’t mind the pinch they do look cool"
3.0,Wore it to KD Party.  It got to be a little uncomfortable after wearing it for 3 hours.
3.0,Super cute but does run small.
3.0,"I’m 5’6 about 155lb, I originally ordered a medium after reading the dress ran a little big. Definitely has a larger fit so I ordered a small. Still loose and is somewhat stretchy. Longer than I expected for being a small, to my knees at least. If you are small chested, don’t buy this. Would be a great dress for someone who has more cleavage and can fill it out as the sides are baggy and need to be taken in."
3.0,The size are very small feel like xl is a medium
3.0,I weigh 175 and ordered a large which fit quite snug was hoping for a loose fit but I guess I can make do with this...Next time I'll buy extra large...besides that the pants are pretty thick and warm.
3.0,"The scarf doesn’t stay up unless you also pull it over your neck so you are covering not just your nose and mouth, but also the back of your head. Might be okay in winter.  Definitely not for summer. Also, the filter sleeve is flimsy and the filters don’t stay in place."
3.0,"Thin fabric, good long length for us taller girls, but too loose in the bust and sleeve."
3.0,This was not a true 6.5 and so a little to big for my little wrists. The chain is very thin and delicate for the CZ. If it fit me tight it would be O.K. So if your wrist is larger this might be fine for you.
3.0,"The strap was bulky n didn't fit very well flopped around even when I adjusted the strap right to the last hole it still felt bulky and flopped around, although it's a nice looking show love the style the strap was an issue."
3.0,"I ordered the toddler size grip socks hoping they would fit my 18 month old son. We have wood floors and he needed something to give him some traction. The grip dots work great, but after one wash, the sock was too tight on his feet. The toddler size is better suited for a 12 month old."
3.0,"its short , like above the knee."
3.0,Adorable outfit. BUT the T was falling off of shirt. The vendor put a piece of tape over the T to hold it in place. Which made it look tacky. I wasn't very happy with the quality of the tshirt.
3.0,Not the most comfortable fit. A bit small but also bulky. May give these to my kids
3.0,Did not keep my feet as warm as they say.  Did help some .
3.0,If you use wide calf boots these socks will be too tight for your calves. I had to send back as one sock was about 1inch wider than the other. The latter was too tight for my calf.
3.0,I ordered the tan but received the green. Makes me look like part of a low budget army. Front pockets very inconvenient. No place to warm your hands
3.0,It started to fall apart after only one use. Poorly made.
3.0,"I work in an Amazon warehouse. It's hot and sweaty in there, so this mask kept slipping off my face. No biggie, I thought, I'll just use one of those clippers I bought to keep it up. Next thing I know, the little rubber band broke, so now I can't use it. Ugh. We'll, it was good while it lasted, and that was only one day. If you buy this mask, don't wear it in a humid atmosphere."
3.0,"The color is as shown, and the fit is as expected- I ordered a size larger than I usually wear. I believe the shirt will be comfortable to wear, but I question whether it is really 65/35 cotton/polyester. I have several shirts of 65/35 and they are easy to care for, but they feel more of cotton. This shirt feels more like polyester. The fabric is thinner than I expected also.<br />I have not had a chance to wear it yet but when I wash and wear it I'll post more impressions.<br /><br />edited: The shirt is comfortable to wear. I washed it on gentle, and it did not wrinkle at all. I just took it from the washer and hung it up. I believe I know why it does not seem like 65% cotton to me. There is the same shirt advertised here on Amazon that is mostly poly, and I suspect that is what this shirt is. The fabrics may have gotten mixed up, even though the label on this one says 65% cotton. Poly shirts make me sweat, so I'll need to wear this one in coolish weather, but the shirt fits well and seems to be well-sewn."
3.0,"I bought this watch a few months ago. I work in healthcare and use a watch on a daily basis and this watch worked well. I do not take off my watch. This watch being water resistant has been great i have no water issues I have taken showers and gone swimming with this watch no issues. However the Leather band as solid and nice as it seems has broken already. I first noticed the second strap that holds the band closed fell off. Then the pin broke a day later. The following day after getting the pin replaced by a jeweler the last band strap broke.  It's to bad I liked the watch. I will order a new band for it, hopefully it will last longer than a few months."
3.0,The material was a bit stiff in my opinion.  I returned it.
3.0,"I really loved this earring. It’s very cute and looks great in your conch piercing. It is actually pretty big though. I don’t think my ears are very small and it was big in my ear. It does fit but sleeping on it is pretty painful. Which I don’t change my earrings much so being able to sleep in my jewelry is a must and I can’t sleep in this one. It just isn’t very comfortable. But it is still cute, just wouldn’t recommend sleeping in it."
3.0,"Beautiful dress but it runs very small, I already sent it back once, I am bummed."
3.0,"First this is a beautiful red with floral print smock. It is printed on the label as size xl. It is not very stretchy material. Has a zipper on the side. The material is see through. (May daughter is m/l). I checked all the sewing thoroughly and it was well put together, except the zipper area, it is not sewn as well and has missed stitching. I hope this has helped. Thank You"
3.0,Very cute but didn’t like the placement of the hooks for the straps
3.0,"Very cute style and seemed stable to walk in, but very tight fit.  I usually wear a 7.5 or 8 and have normal width feet - I ordered an 8 and they felt tight and a bit narrow. I will be returning."
3.0,"They are very thin & cheaply made as shown. All were unevenly sewed together so didn't fit correctly on the face. Also was small, even for a female. Didn't fit from nose to bottom of chin. They are soft & comfortable which was only good thing about them. I doubt they'll be worn."
3.0,Doesn't fit like the black and gray pair but they do fit
3.0,Finger tips still cold.
3.0,I bought 5 pair and the last two I have are Sticky and ozzing some kind of stuff?? Not sure what is going on but just letting you of problem.
3.0,"The design is very cute, but the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because once I had it on for maybe two hours it started cutting into my belly button."
3.0,Really comfy fit perfectly but wish they had pockets
3.0,Good product for the money. After a few washes it starts to fade and lose its luster.
3.0,Slippers are okay. They're warm but not crazy on how they fit. Wouldn't purchase them again
3.0,My granddaughter like it but too small but for the price is k
3.0,"They are a little fragile, but they do what they are supposed to do."
3.0,"Waterproof, and keep warm. However<br />I was expecting much better grip and use this as working glow, but this doesn't give better grip. Layers slipping and you can't feel the grip"
3.0,"This was a cute little cell charm. its got a nice leather strap that doesnt feel cheap, and you can change charms if you wish. the totoro lights up! that was a surprise for me, but the battery didnt last long. the only complaint i have is you can see glue all over the side of totoro."
3.0,The are very soft and I like the adjustable strap.
3.0,Arms are a little tight. Not as full as I expected.
3.0,"This dress is really cute. It""s also very small. The sizing is off to say the least. Cost too much to return. I would not recommend."
3.0,"The mask is of good quality, but I wish it covered more of my face - it's a little short nose-to=chin."
3.0,"It’s OK but was not pleased with all the glue showing and dripping off the beads, they should have been cleaned off before it was sent instead of giving me the job of doing it."
3.0,Nice stretchy material but runs small. Order a larger size
3.0,"I reallllly wanted to love these but the fit is just off. They fit great everywhere but the waist. I’m typically in between sizes (L and XL) so I went with an XL here. They’re high waisted which I loved but found them to frequently fall below my hips as the top just wasn’t snug enough. There’s not a lot of elasticity at the top. Note- I don’t think it’s my body type bc I’ve never had another pair of leggings, no matter the size, do this. Material is nice and smooth and the pockets are deep which is great. I will wear them around the house but will not wear them if I’m outside of the house moving around a lot and definitely not when being active."
3.0,"I am so tired of people attempting to create styles and having in MHO what appears to be absolutely no concept of how to execute the style. Maxi, as it relates to dresses, refers to floor length, why advertise a dress as a maxi dress when it falls above the ankle? There are varying heights of women who wear Maxi dresses, cut some longer for taller women, cut some shorter for women not so tall. Varying lengths, there's a novel concept (sarcasm)  I'm 5""7 and ordered the Large. I would have loved the dress otherwise, I returned it."
3.0,Even ordering a larger size did not help. Very tight at the top and difficult to get on and off.
3.0,"For me, this was an impulse buy, I love this movie!!  The pendant is definitely an outside the tshirt charm, wearing it for an extended period of time against bare skin did cause some wear to the shiny finish, and allowed the base metal to show thru. I still dig the pendant, and when you meet someone who knows what it is, it makes your day."
3.0,"I had to return this and go two sizes up from the typical size my child wears. Fabric looks ok, as it should last this Halloween season. I don’t expect it to last long after that, especially with a few washes"
3.0,"Loved the quality and look if this dress. Unfortunately, I had to send it back because it has minimal coverage over the breast area. I wish this would've worked for me but I'm a 38dd and it just wasn't going to work. I'd definitely recceomend this one if you're not worried about showing lots of cleavage!"
3.0,One planet was missing on one bracelet and the other had 2 planets out of order. Had to redo before xmas am.
3.0,"This polo may not be at the premium level, but at the price, it's worth it......The fit, depending on your build, is a little tight through the chest and shoulders. The details are all good, and the oxford fabric is reasonably soft."
3.0,cheap but great for a costume.
3.0,Pretty dress... very disappointed with sizing. It is at least 2 sizes too small. I will be returning.
3.0,Beautiful pendant.  They chain was far too delicate and broke with only a month of light wear.
3.0,It is very pretty however on closer inspection I found one earring different from the other. The center diamond on one was much raised than the other. I have sent the seller 2 emails but have not received an response. I will most likely return it as this seems to be a defect in the piece it self.<br />I was happy to receive it but now I'm disappointed. I am also going to take it to the jewelers to look at it under a loupe and if the diamonds are what is said on the certificate then I might reorder depending on future customer service.<br />I will update on what i decided to do.
3.0,You get what you pay for.  A bit too big.
3.0,"The shirt are really my only issue. You can’t tell the back from the front and they are very high waisted. If you pull them up so the crotch sits right your butt hangs out the bottom. I ended up rolling them 2x and they look cuter that way. Maybe if you have hips, which I do not, they’d fit better. The set is comfy and love the color (green). I’m a size 2/ 26” waist/ 32 D/ 5’6/ athletic build and bought a small. Top fits good."
3.0,"Such a good deal, but I buy this package about every six months because they fall out and break so often."
3.0,"I bought the short sleeve dress in a medium then the long sleeve in a small. I’m short but not small, 155lbs, chunky, 36ddd.I really likes the short sleeve but The medium was huge so I returned that and they don’t have a small in the short sleeve so I tried the long sleeve. The small fit better but it was still too long and with the long puffy sleeve I felt it was overwhelming and frumpy. Both ended up going back."
3.0,Very see through and not comfortable.
3.0,"These fit me like spandex, very little support but more breathable. The legs roll up causing wedgies that rival those I'd give in junior high. The legs are fairly long so that is a lot a material getting bunched up. These just aren't for me, your results may very"
3.0,"So it looks like my old armiton that I use to wear all the time. I love self winding cause I hate buying batteries, and the open window makes for a lovely design. While the watch itself is well weighted and feels decent, the band feels absolutely awful on the skin. It looks ok but it feels like cheap aluminum, and it catches on just about anything"
3.0,Too short. I'm a short person 5'3&#34; and it's above my knee
3.0,"I bought this dress for my granddaughter. It's very pretty at first sight. I loved it immediately. The colors (dress and trimmings are lively and perfectly matched. The basic dress itself looks durable and comfortable. BUT at a closer look, I found it disappointing that the APPLIQUE (cutout butterflies attached to the dress) is made of felt only, not cloth. How can it withstand washing? I wonder if felt material can survive 2-3 washings? I will submit a follow-up review should there be a favorable outcome after this dress is washed."
3.0,"It's so hard to know sizing these days!  It was probably my error by not noticing the word &#34;Missy&#34; in the description.  I would say that this runs like a true U.S. Woman's size  vs  European sizing.  For this reason, it was a little large for me.  Decided to keep it anyway.  The fabric isn't as high quality as I'd have expected..thin, not very breathable. But just fine for working in the garden.  The cut is A-line but a bit looser. The photo is true representation of how the skirt looks when on.  Just size down (smaller)."
3.0,"Beautiful colors and breathable material, but the L is definitely a medium and the XL is a Large. I wish they had XXL when I ordered because I want to be comfortable with a sport bra underneath. Also I ordered all XL and they gave me one L and two XL. So my order was uneven. For reference, I am full-figured, 5' 8' , size 14, medium chested."
3.0,"These gloves are pretty cheap (not just the price). I expected as much when I ordered them, and when I received them they were basic quality gloves that you would buy at a super cheap Halloween outlet. They are thin and the stitching is pretty low quality. I bought them to go with one of my costumes, but ended up not using/wearing them because they looked extremely cheap compared to my handmade outfit."
3.0,"The top was not like the picture, turned out to be spaghetti straps instead."
3.0,I use them to keep my ankles warm. Hard to fix to use with my slippers
3.0,"I ordered the Nutmeg color and for some reason I received a note stating they could not find the nutmeg color so they sent a brown pair.  And that If I didn't want them I could return it for a refund.  It was annoying because if I wanted brown pants I would have ordered them.  I tried them on and the zipper was really long.  Like, they were high rise but pooched out in the crotch area.  They were not flattering.  So-I had to send them back."
3.0,"Very attractive watch, but laughably complicated to set day and date."
3.0,"Cute.  Sizes run small. I wear medium, ordered XL.  Fit fine."
3.0,"It would be fine but the neck is so tight that I haven't worn it again since the first time. I don't normally mind turtlenecks but with this I was constantly trying to pull it away from my throat and ended up changing out of it before the day was over. Besides that it seems well made, so maybe it would be fine for some people."
3.0,Beautiful color and comfortable lace but to small through waist and hips.
3.0,"The dress is great for people of normal height. I like the dress, however, at 156cm, the dress comes to about 4cm below my knees - a tad too long for my taste.<br /><br />The material is thin with a slight stretch to it. If you have hips - which I don’t - it shouldn’t be a problem as the dress is only fitted up top until waist level."
3.0,"I like it for travel or storage, but it does not keep everything in it's place. But I use it everyday."
3.0,"&#34;The Native Low Ryder sunglasses fit a medium to larger face best&#34;, lets just strike the &#34;large&#34; and go with medium.  These are too small for me."
3.0,Soft fabric and looks as advertised but same as other folks were stating it only came with one string when there's supposed to be 2 and it kind of looks weird just having empty loops.
3.0,It doesn't shine like the picture but it's a nice belt for the price
3.0,fabric tnds to ride down
3.0,"Pretty nightgown, but it fits small."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:d0fa1f43c5420efb4b272698e9f3cfe9]] They are a perfect size and what I was looking for but I question if these area authentic TF frames. There is no serial number engraved on the left leg.  The logo is not edged on either.
3.0,"I love this body suits colors and feel of the fabric, but…. Unfortunately the cut of the bodysuit around the hip is SUPER HIGH, therefore the bodysuit rides up in a not so flattering or comfortable way.."
3.0,I wasn’t very happy with this. Honestly it was very short. I’m 5’1 and it was super short on me. It also had a liner that made a lot of noise when you move. I ended up returning
3.0,Be careful when you open the zipper part. Mine care apart :(
3.0,Shoulder area a little tight.
3.0,Quality was not as nice as I thought it be. Fit well tho.
3.0,"Super cute design. Fits fine. The material is kind of cheap, though.  It is that kind of staticky fabric that attracts lint and fur."
3.0,"Very nice but it runs small, necklaces refuses to lay flat around my neck. But fits my 8 year old beautifully lol still waiting on a response on how to get my $ back"
3.0,"Bought for doing yard work, glad that was my plan. Bought it nearly 2 months ago; it comes seriously wrinkled from being tightly folded up and it still hasn't lost the &#34;sat upon&#34; look.<br />It keeps the sun off my neck and out of my eyes while in the yard, so it's doing what I wanted. Not nice enough to take on a cruise or classy vacation."
3.0,"They are of decent quality, but are way too big to be labeled “kids”. I got them for my 4 and 6 year old and they won’t be using them due to not fitting properly. I’ll keep them in the car to have on hand for emergency use for me and my husband."
3.0,"I washed and dried it, washed well. Wore it last night, like reviewers have stated, armholes are small. I was able to stretch them a bit to make it comfortable. But the next morning, it was horribly wrinkled so I wouldn't want anyone to see me in it (couldn't wear it without a robe over it). I have other gowns that don't wrinkle. I like that it is cotton, fabric feels ok but I wouldn't order this again. Note: I am 5'6"", 120 lbs, 34B ordered a size Medium (due to other reviewers feedback that it runs small). Medium fit fine so Small likely would have been too small. I gave it 3 stars because it wasn't awful but not great either."
3.0,"This dress looks terrific, especially for such an inexpensive dress.  However, washing this dress will immediately cause pilling.  Even if  using a lingerie bag.  Have only dripped dry.  Have not put dress in dryer."
3.0,"The dress was a bit small, but the bigger issue was the fabric. It was not forgiving. I returned the dress for a larger size, but even with the larger size and a set of spanks, every line of my garments underneath was very noticeably highlighted."
3.0,For a friend. She liked it but it broke after a short time.
3.0,"I love them and the price was perfect. One loop for the buttons wasnt sewn in properly.  My handy husband was able to fix it, othwise I would have needed to return them<br />Had the loop not been broken would have given them a solid 4"
3.0,its okay looking
3.0,"When I purchased these I was looking for an item that would keep my prescription glasses from sliding down my nose.  These Reax devices worked well at first, but after a few days they would not stay on the ends of my glasses.  The judicious use of a hair dryer to ""shrink"" them a bit fixed the problem.  I applied heat to the point where the Reax connected to the arms of my glasses for several minutes and the bond was quite strong after."
3.0,Ring is ok but it doesn’t look anything like the pictures the seller provides. It looks cheap.
3.0,"I really liked this bathing suit, but i found that the skinny string of the halter dug into my shoulders too much and i could not wear it. I'm large busted, so that may have weighed it down more than usual. I liked that the belly area of the top flared out instead of sticking to my stomach even when dry."
3.0,"Fits very nice and style was very nice the only problem is, the workmanship was poor."
3.0,"This belt fits really well and is perfect to put on quickly. I got it for my raincoat because I can just put it on and go. The bow is a bit big, and the belt smelled so heavily of chemicals, but it was gone after I aired it out for a couple nights."
3.0,"They’re cute, just small"
3.0,The black on the bottom of the dress with the floral design is a different shade then the top. Comfy tho and I love the pockets.
3.0,Only the front of the socks are printed on. The back is an awkward white.
3.0,I was excited to receive these sunglasses.  But what was advertised and what I received I don't feel are the same sunglasses. So I'm disappointed.  On a good side the glasses did come with a nice little bag to keep them safe in.
3.0,I have ordered from these sellers a few times before so i know the general quality. But for anyone who is thinking about ordering from themd just know that they take a few days to break in and after a few weeks the buttons making contact with your skin will start to tarnish from sweat. But other than that they are decent cheap pieces of jewelry for people to wear.
3.0,"First time I started wearing it, LOVED it!  After washing it, the outside of the sweatshirt balled up and noticed alot of the red came out into the wash and the red also comes out in the dryer---so don't wash with anything else on the first wash except with the very darks which is what I did; lucky for me.  I still wear it but just disappointed with the drastic change of material after the first wash, hence the 3 stars instead of the 4/5."
3.0,Disappointed that pins were not included with the band. New pins are typically included because the old pins are hard to get out. Will have to take to a jeweler to replace the band now.
3.0,"My Granddaughter loved them, however they seem to be kind of big in the heel and her foot kept slipping out of the shoe. They are not the best quality shoe, but they worked for her."
3.0,material has a nice soft feel.
3.0,"I purchased this lovely Belt Buckle but the issue is that the item did not arrive on the estimate it time, i e-mailed the guys from the store and they told me that the item normally arrives on 30 days so that's not what the description said when i purchased the item, i am happy with the item but not with the estimate time."
3.0,This was nice but much smaller than I expected.
3.0,I bought this band because the band on my watch is not long enough to go around my wrist.  This band is long and does what it says it will do... it is more suited for woman than man though.
3.0,Waaay to dark
3.0,"It's okay, but I washed it and now too snub to actually sleep in."
3.0,"This dress is so, so, cute, but the largest available size is 14, and squeezing my size 16/18 self into it was not quite the look I was going for (i.e. a fashionable mattress)."
3.0,Fair quality. Good color.
3.0,one size fits all is HUGE and i'm a size 10 so not the smallest of people.
3.0,"My mom purchased this bracelet and it was to small, so she gave it to me.  It is a very nice bracelet, she just wishes it was bigger!!"
3.0,Look good but runs small. I used lotion to help get the gloves on
3.0,"Shrunk a lot when I washed them so now when I try to wear them they are tight. Also the material is very thin, I already have wholes in the toes from wearing them one time."
3.0,"The dress is beautiful, but it runs very small. I usually wear size 12. I ordered an XL. The elastic button holders pulled apart a half inch. It's not going to work for me.<br />I am giving it away."
3.0,More of a stocking than a sock. I have a few nurse mates compression stockings in different colors and would say these are not the best type. They seem like they won’t last as long and compression doesn’t seem to be what it states.
3.0,it look very small when you receive it however it will stretch--I am a size 16. The item do have a strong chemical smell. I washed it twice and you can still smell it- just not as bad.  It is soft--this is something I would wear around the house not so much to go out in
3.0,They are good. But easy to loose. They come unscrewed
3.0,I like the socks and the colors but the material is definitely knit and not as warm as I hoped they would be! Not too thick and not too thin.
3.0,Purple dress wasn't as beautiful and bright as shown in the image so I returned it.
3.0,Nice sweater! Just runs a little small
3.0,"Thankfully, I bought 2 of these necklaces because one of them has already ripped. It might be my fault because I am a tri-athlete and wore it while swimming. I also wore it in the shower several times. I have had this type of necklace in the past and found them to be more durable. They are not expensive and I use them frequently. I will now purchase extra necklaces since I know they wear quickly.  I will purchase them from this vendor again and not wear them while I am swimming or in the shower."
3.0,I thought this was a super cute dress and the construction appeared to be ok for how much you're paying. I really liked the pattern. I returned it only for the reason that it seemed a little too sheer for me (even with both layers of material) and I didn't want to buy a slip to wear under it because thought it might make it too snug. I would consider buying from this vendor again.
3.0,These sunglasses are really cute! The reason for the 3 stars is the black pair came a little out of shape. They sit tilted on my face and I've tried to bend and re-shape them and now they are just so loose on my face I can't even wear them but the blue pair fits fine.
3.0,Was to small seemed to be of good quality tho was very light and looked exactly as pictured
3.0,Some of the prints were blurry
3.0,it's very cheap for what you're getting
3.0,I liked the material but it is just too small! Definitely try to get a size or 2 up
3.0,"I liked the shirt, the material is good quality, but the picture on it is not original, it looks photo copied. Other than that its edgy and cute."
3.0,"Wish I could have used these, as they seem so promising, but unfortunately they are way too thick to fit into any of my shoes. If you want these, better buy your shoes a size up."
3.0,This top fit me perfectly however if you are top heavy this will not cover much.
3.0,"Nice watch, very cheap band."
3.0,My husband is 6'1&#34; and they are not long enough for him.
3.0,You’ll need to have a little narrow of a face for them to look as they should. But they fit well enough I guess and do the job. I’ll probably replace them pretty quickly.
3.0,Straight and simply got what i paid for
3.0,"No liner, needs compression shorts to go with it. Also, while most Salomon clothing runs small, these run large.<br /><br />Great material though. Light and will stay dry"
3.0,This scrub was bought r/t price and color
3.0,"They do work, to some degree, with my amblyopia, and they may well work well for you.  Past that they are a far cry from a visit to your optometrist."
3.0,"Fit was nice, but these were more of a wicking type material and I prefer more of a cotton feel (which these definitely were not), so they were returned."
3.0,I lowered the straps on this and even loosened it and it still dug into my side. It also didn't give me the push up I was hoping for. I was trying to be cheap and find a good push up bra that didn't cost a ton but I didn't care for this bra to much. Maybe I'm just to use to V.S. bra's. Owww well least I didn't waste to much money.
3.0,"I ordered the Large in this casual jumpsuit.  I am 5' 10"" and weigh 185.  I carry most weight in my rear and legs. The torso was way too short on me. The upper leg section was too small.  Top of jumpsuit fit my shoulders and arms well.  It is easy to get on and off because of the elastic in the V neck section. Overall it is good quality.  Olive color is more like Sage and it blends well with the white stripe.  Picture online looked much darker.<br />I had to return this jumpsuit."
3.0,"This is cute but cheaply made with poor quality beads.  The multi-colored product is a little nicer with more weight to it.  I don't regret purchasing it as a add-on simply because it seems fairly sturdy.  I saw the review about the ""eyes"" rubbing off; but, it was less than $5 as a add-on purchase.  Not bad."
3.0,"This dress arrived and at first glance in the package it seemed very cheap. It appeared a bit thin and I was afraid it would show my undergarments. Additionally, it is advertised as 93% cotton and I promise you, it is 0% cotton. This is a poly/spandex/rayon fabric with no content or wash tag. So, if you were looking for cotton like me, this isn't the dress for you. That being said, Even though it seemed cheap I still tried it on. I am glad I did. This dress is bangin on me. It feels nice, and is flattering on my large bust. It looks boxy out of the bag but is figure flattering on. I absolutely love this in black. I do not think it would be as nice in the lighter colors because it does have exposed hem and cuff stitching, and these lighter colors would probably reveal undergarments. 100% recommend in the black. Purchased for work but could easily wear to a nice dinner with a shoe change. Not more stars because of the typical overseas BS with fabric bait and switch.<br />One last thing.... I did purchase a size up. I wear a 4 or a small but am busty. I did not want to look stuffed in. While I could have worn the small, the larger size drapes in a way that is more professional. Hope this helps. Size 4, 5 ft 10, 140lbs 34dd. Medium fit generously."
3.0,I ordered this and one other to wear to a Derby parry in Tennessee. I ended up wearing the other hat as it was a nicer product. If I can work on this one a little and get it looking nice I’ll wear it at Christmas or New Year parties.
3.0,I really liked the short but the size seemed to large to be a size 40. If I were to reorder I would definitely consider size 38 for a better fit.
3.0,"I bought this dress in an XL red a year ago and it was perfect: about 4 inches above the knee, sexy but still great to wear to a more casual wedding. It's not the best material so after 2 washes (and line drying) I could see some pilling. And I really didn't care because for the price I felt like I got my money from the few uses.<br /><br />I decided to get another XL in black. It came and looked super long. Like long and dumpy. So I returned it thinking it had been mis-labeled size-wise. I ordered a red XL. It, too, is way too long. Past the knee several inches. I'm so bummed that they've changed the length on this dress."
3.0,"The leather on this is so soft and feels so good to touch, the zipper is good and strong. It is a little small however as I don't think a lot of today's smart phones will fit in it as mine certainly won't."
3.0,Meh.. definitely get what you pay for. They aren’t very breathable at all and the bottom cuff is loose so it looks a little weird. Overall they are ok. Good tummy control.
3.0,Nice skirt for the price but the waist does run small.
3.0,"Although the leather is gorgeous and so are the stones-the 3 on the front are not well sewn on, and popped up the second time that I wore them, on both shoes.  So now I'll have to try to sew them back down myself.  Not good for overpriced, $200 shoes that some ex Calvin Klein designer who started this company makes you believe are worth it.  Check out their website,[...]  Overpriced."
3.0,"Fair warning, these tops run small, so order bigger by at least one size"
3.0,Zoom in on jacket to see octagon pattern. It’s all over jacket. Picture shows jacket is black with secondary colors. Not the case. Jacket is 99% octagon pattern. Very thin polyester material. Not worth the 30+ dollar price. No lining in jacket.<br />100% knock off. This is not marvel licensed<br />Overall I would not buy again or recommend<br />Look for something more worthwhile and worth the price. This is a total swap meet item
3.0,"Turns out that &#34;One size fits most&#34; just means that the size is XXL! It's for the guest bath, and the quality is fine, so it will work OK for that purpose."
3.0,"I thought it was cute and tall girl friendly. However, I had to return because it was see through."
3.0,"A bit large for my tiny lady's wrist, but cool looking. The light doesn't illuminate the entire watch face, which is kind of odd."
3.0,It runs small so if you normally wear a medium get xlarge
3.0,Didn’t fit me I order a size XL a size up since sometime runs small but definitely should went a size down don’t even think a size “ would it work and it’s see through really cute in pictures but just not fore me definitely different
3.0,"The dress is beautiful but runs very small.  I wear an 18, but had to order a 24"
3.0,Im about 5'6 and 200lbs and got the 2xl . its comfy and baggy but a bit short and gives me a front wedgy.
3.0,Hat fit like I expected but it is made of a very heavy material. Going to put it up and use ig as a winter hat. Needed one for the summer.
3.0,"This pendant is intricate and small, beautifully made; however, one stone popped out at the top near the bale. The stone is so tiny I've no hope of ever finding it, and it will be difficult to find a replacement that will fit. I'm disappointed that it came out, as it looked like it was better made."
3.0,The grey are perfect but the black are see through!
3.0,smallish.  great material wish they offer bigger sizes.
3.0,I usually wear 12-14 but the 14 was way to small. I have on a 14 jean skirt bought somewhere else and if fits fine. You need to order 2 sizes up from your normal size if you have curves. Love the material and it is made well.
3.0,Back laces up and requires assistance to getting the dress on.
3.0,Made to fit a smaller person than a regular small is made for. Worked fine when I dropped 30lbs and my other briefs where to big.
3.0,"I like the bracelet, it's very nice and casual but is really not meant for  people  with small wrists. The clasp is unstable and comes undone easily for those of us who don't have thick arms.  It's a shame because it is a nice bracelet."
3.0,Thought it would be great for my daughters hair type but the hat keeps sliding off
3.0,Pretty but started to lose the rose gold color after a while.
3.0,No me agrado que el vestido que recibí no es como el de la foto pero si tiene un color muy lindo y buena tela.n
3.0,It is cute but to big for my taste
3.0,Had to add a nose bridge so it would fit properly. The front is a lot more pointy then I expected. I like that you can wash it and replace the filter.
3.0,I wear a 34F and this will NOT even remotely fit my bust. I think this would fit if I wore a C cup. Keep this in mind when purchasing.
3.0,I'm usually a size medium I purchased this in a medium size and fits like a large I would recommend to get a size smaller.
3.0,"They are nice, but I wish the bracelet had an adjustable size. I have small wrists, wasn’t able to wear it, it would’ve fell right off. Gonna give it to my mother haha"
3.0,Gift for husband.  Fits somewhat too tight.
3.0,"Disappointed, these are ladies socks.."
3.0,They run a little small in my opinion. They are very cute though and I hope the boots I ordered as a replacement will fit!
3.0,It was beautiful and perfect for my birthday but the strap broke the first place we went to dinner to sit down at. I wasn’t even wearing a bra. I think because the dress is so heavy they should make the strings more enforced. I’m going to have it fixed though because of the quality of the dress otherwise.
3.0,"I said that it fit as expected, but it does not. Unless you are completely flat chested this is an empire/high waisted dress and therefore not that flattering. I will wear it to work, but I would not buy it again."
3.0,its ok but the quality is quiet bad
3.0,"The earrings are adorable, the backs not so much. The backs don't stay on properly and that makes it very uncomfortable. Will probably look for a different pair of backings so I can wear these."
3.0,The bathing suit fit a little small. That I can deal with. But the jacket was way to short! I looked at the items description and its suppose to be 56&#34; mine was 46&#34;. I'm 5'9 220 lbs and ordered an extra large in the gold and white swimsuit.
3.0,Material isn't great.  Hand wash as well.
3.0,"They sure as hell do warm up cold hands. They’re very good at it too from a power bank. My only problem is that they aren’t waterproof, and can only be used in fair weather, and with motorized bicycling being my main mode of transportation, that’s a pretty big issue. I’ll be replacing them soon."
3.0,"Most bangles are too big on my wrists, so I’m always wary of non-adjustable bracelets. But I really liked the style of these Magitaco Love Bracelets. The measurement instructions say to measure around your wrist with a strong and then add half an inch to that number, the circumference of the bangles is 6.7 inches. My wrist is about 6 inches, and they fit me without being too big, so I’m happy about that!<br /><br />The clasp edge of the bangles, where they open to put on your wrist, is very sharp. I actually scratched myself when I put one of the bracelets on, the metal is that sharp.<br /><br />Two of the bracelets I received have secure clasps. The gold bracelet does not, the clasp is loose and makes a jingly noise if I shake it. I won’t be able to wear the gold bracelet because with the loose clasp, there’s potential for the sharp edges to scratch my wrist.<br /><br />Otherwise, I like the bangles. The infinity symbol actually reminds me more of the Cool S symbol!"
3.0,These pants run small on the waist area and length is super long. Material is not so thin or not so thick. It washes nicely. Legs are very wide and they are high waist. Sadly they don’t fit me very well small on the waist and length is too long for me. I am 5.2 tall and 137 lb. got size small.
3.0,"Bought in 2012, finally had to send it in. Was a great watch until a battery replacement didn't come back to life.  Its been through a lot, especially oil and gas exposure"
3.0,Super cute and fun but the part that is on you ear is way to pointy. And hurts when I wear these.
3.0,None of the sunglasses are mirrored. Each one you can see through the lens
3.0,Single fake pearl necklace. Got me some brownie points.
3.0,Very thin material but is soft and flowy so is comfortable. Good 'vintage' look to it.
3.0,Runs very large around ankle u can double up looks ok
3.0,"Now I know to look for this feature: Must have top zipper that extends down the sides and opens accordion style. I assumed this satchel was like my current top handle satchel/doc bag that is easy to access the contents, but this is not. With the zipper only on the very top, the opening is too small and will drive me crazy. I guess the leather is okay, but I don’t know how it will hold up. It’s not “full-grain”, so that’s the other criteria I’ll be searching. More criteria: rolled handles (which I also didn’t think about before) and an outside pocket. I’m returning this purse unused. — Ohhh the search for a perfect purse. It really shouldn’t be this hard. I do like the size of this one though."
3.0,It's big and a kind of baggy fit.
3.0,Material is lightweight and just as pictured. It fit in the shoulders but was tight across chest and waist for my husband. He is large boned. I ordered this 2 sizes too big after reading the reviews. Will find someone to give this to since we can't use it. Made for people with Narrow build like a runner.
3.0,Not a bad sun hat
3.0,"Received my 4 Pack: Women's Footless 12&#34; boy-shorts within specified timeline (2-days of purchase). PLEASE be careful to follow the vendor's sizing chart in the description section, NOT Amazon. Additionally, be WARNED... these boy shorts fits more of a nylon-type fabric...similar to panty hose; thus NOT meant for &#34;support&#34; or &#34;tummy&#34; control. As a few fellow reviewers have mentioned, the top waist portion of fabric rolls down, and the bottom legs rolls up with movement; creating the &#34;shimmy dance&#34;. I used these as additional coverage during a surgical procedure... The purpose of my purchase was served.<br /><br />UPDATE 04.12.2018:<br />Please note, these &#34;boy shorts&#34; are structured as nylon underwear. Do NOT use as outer-wear, unless you wish to gift the world a FREE &#34;PEEK SHOW&#34;! Would NOT recommend for daily use, or physical activities. Happy Shopping Fellow Amazonians💓❗"
3.0,"Arms are tiny!  A curvy 2x woman doesn't have 10yr old anorexic arms.  Otherwise soft fabric,  great colors"
3.0,color good..made a little delicate and easy to come apart with the tiny beads on a thin string. wanted it to be a little more sturdy.
3.0,Very stiff boot. They look great and initially are comfortable but they don’t seem to break in very quickly and end up squeezing the front of your feet. I am hoping after a few wears they will loosen up more.
3.0,Great idea but my daughter has very long hair and could use a wider bun.  But super easy for  her to do on her own and she is 9
3.0,Really irritating fabric.
3.0,Nice glasses but do not fit over my glasses as advertised.
3.0,"Really cute well made shoes, but they sent the wrong size. One size too small."
3.0,Yarn is scratchy and stiff.  No shape to sweater.  Runs big.  Colors are nice.
3.0,Stinky! Wash right away.
3.0,"Used to keep,a dress together that was too large. This can’t take too much strain because the chain is weakly made."
3.0,Meh! Pretty budget shirt.  Too lazy to return otherwise I would.  Probably going to sit in my drawer and if I'm absolutely desperate for a shirt because all my others are in the laundry..... Maybe just maybe I will wear it to the golf course.
3.0,"Great fit, however not a substandard material. Ripped after 3 wears."
3.0,Good belt for the cost. I got confused. I was looking for a women's belt.
3.0,Nice dress but extremely heavy.  Size up
3.0,Wore for a month and the band fell apart. It's cute but not a daily wearable band.
3.0,They do not eliminate the night glare completely but they give some relief.
3.0,Wouldn’t call this bra a minimizer which is what I was looking for. The material and straps are stretchy not satin so would say this is more of a traditional bra for comfort. I returned because was not minimizer. It is a nice bra and appears would be comfortable
3.0,"It's pretty. Don't care for the chain, but the stone is clear and sparkles."
3.0,"everything is great, except its missing one of the ends for my two favorite piercings that come in this set, making them inable to wear"
3.0,Cute necklace and nice drop and length but tarnished quickly
3.0,"A couple of the magnetic portions had been glued together, but most of the clasps work just fine, very easy to attach to existing jewelry, and the magnets make it easy for children to do the clasps themselves.  Easier on arthritic hands, too."
3.0,Are cute but  at the same time a little bit smaller than I thought and transparents.
3.0,"The item says XL. When I got the shirt it said XXL.  The shirt fits like a large, it's skin tight. Would look really good if it fit."
3.0,"Decent quality, was more stretchy than I expected."
3.0,"I thought this might be a great casual dress for summer, but I ended up not liking the way it fit or the style of the dress. I am 5'2"" and the waist sat where I would expect, but with my body shape, the pleats made it look more like maternity wear than I would have liked."
3.0,The material is beautiful. Shipping takes over a month. The sizing is very small. I am a U.S. medium and the size was XXS. If you want to order this dress order a bigger size (2x) and it will come in a month.
3.0,Everything ok except the thing that all the colors are not sewn together all the way down
3.0,Too thin almost transparent - not what I wanted
3.0,Bottoms where true to size. Top fits like a small!
3.0,There is vision distortion on the non magnified portion of the lens.  This is a good substitute for a more expensive product but don't keep your expectations too high.
3.0,They are really cute but the magnets are so strong and small you cannot get them apart. We cannot wear them.
3.0,"Product was great, and if this was on the product alone it would get five stars. The reason it's lower is because of the shipping. I got next to no updates when I went onto the tracking information to find out when this was going to get here, and it went around 2 weeks without telling me where my package was. Once I actually got the item I was satisfied with its quality."
3.0,This will fit an adult but was bought for our two year old.  Very warm and plush.  I gave it 3-stars since the goggles look so cheap and are not removable despite appearing so in the pictures.  He likes it but the goggles do fog up when on his head.
3.0,The name looks like it will peel off. Quality not great but serves it's purpose.
3.0,Cheap looking jeans
3.0,Glass broke after one week.
3.0,Took too long to ship. I normally wear a med-large in dresses. I ordered a med and it was still too big.
3.0,Cute style. Good material. Fits well except it is about 2 inches short in the waist and about 5 inches above my knee. Looks odd with the fullness of the skirt.
3.0,"I am 5'-4&#34; tall and weigh ~120 pounds. I typically wear a US size 2 or a medium in similar women's styles. The Women Snowflake Print Long Sleeve Pullover Tops Sweatshirt by UGET is only offered in one size, which they boast as a US Size 0-2. I would equate this to a Juniors X-Small or Small. The fit is a bit on the small side for me, but overall I can wear this sweatshirt comfortably. The images from the seller should a loose fit, which is not the case. The UGET Hoodie is a tight fit. The sleeves are a bit shorter than I would prefer, but they still hit at the wrist. The sleeves are on the tight side throughout. I would wear this sweatshirt with a tank top of cami underneath. I would not be able to fit a long sleeve shirt under the tight fit of the UGET Hoodie.<br /><br />The UGET Women Snowflake Print Long Sleeve Pullover Tops Sweatshirt is a lightweight, cotton blend. It is super soft on the inside, with a fleece-like feeling. Despite its tight fit, it is certainly comfortable enough to wear without a second layer underneath. The seams are all very well constructed and soft against the body. I would recommend washing this item on the cold cycle to preserve the fit of the item and hang to dry. I ordered my hoodie in the &#34;White&#34; color. The sweatshirt itself is white with a black reindeer pattern. It is very true to the photos form the seller. Unfortunately, there is a bit of a stain on the pouch pocket and the print on the chest is a bit imperfect (there is a grey smudge), but for only a few dollars, I am not surprised. Overall, this is a cute winter style and a super competitive price. Similar styles can be found at juniors retailers like Kohls for $30+. As a seasonal design, UGET definitely wins with their low budget design.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful. If so, I'd appreciate you clicking the &#34;helpful&#34; button!"
3.0,"Very pretty, but the top fit too snugly in the shoulders."
3.0,It is a nice shiny clutch but it is smaller than the pictures indicate. My cellphone couldn't fit properly in it.
3.0,"This is actually a nice looking baseball-style (or raglan sleeve) henley. The red color is a true red, and pops nicely against the light heather grey of the main body of the shirt. If the look is all that matters to you, then great! If you want something with a decent fabric blend, good construction, and a decent fit, though, you should probably keep shopping and find another garment.<br /><br />To begin with, the description on this page says that this shirt is 100% cotton. There is no WAY that this thing is anywhere close to 100% cotton. You can tell just by looking at it that it has a very large amount of some synthetic fibers (probably a blend of polyester and elastene) accounting for anything between 60-75% of the material's content. If you live anywhere even moderately warm (or if you just prefer to wear natural fibers,) then this shirt will (quite literally) rub you the wrong way.<br /><br />Additionally, while the picture shows a ¾ sleeve, the garment I received (in a size medium,) had a sleeve that didn't even cover my elbow, and that was far more tight than I would prefer. I don't have particularly long (or muscular) arms, and at 5'9&#34;, I'm not exactly the tallest person around, so the tight/short sleeves combined with the strange trapezoidal shape of the body of the shirt (the bottom hem was definitely wider than the shoulders,) just didn't fit me well.<br /><br />As far as the construction of the garment goes, this shirt shows some very uneven (literally) results. While lining the placket for the henley buttons with fabric matching the sleeves is a nice touch (although generally something I don't expect in a henley, baseball style or not,) the placket bunched up weirdly, since the fabric was a different composition than the main body of the shirt. Since the fabric content in general of this garment is not indicated anywhere on the garment, I wouldn't feel comfortable washing this or putting it in the dryer. Basically, I know from personal experience that there are more comfortable, better fitting, and better constructed garments available (and if you look carefully enough, probably for less money,) from other brands online or here on Amazon. Save your money for those instead of this one."
3.0,At first I gave this 5 stars. I love the way it looks and feels. I couldn’t wait to wear it. The first time I put the pants on it had a hole in the leg seem. I’m so disappointed because other than that it was perfect.
3.0,Not a quality item<br />Not like picture<br />Very small<br />Not worth the price
3.0,"Perhaps, the top portion would have fit better had I ordered a smaller size, but the waist area was situated too high and I didn't like that look on me.The color scheme was very nice, however."
3.0,"El color está bonito, la talla también.<br />Pero la tela del pantalón es súper delgada y queda transparente. El top si le pusieron doble y queda hermoso pero el pantalón no.<br />Y tampoco es de la marca SHEIN."
3.0,The item was much thinner fabric than anticipated z
3.0,The flower pattern doesn’t look as cute as the picture. I’m 5 ft 4 in 110 lbs and ordered a medium and it’s a little big and shapeless on me. Overall it’s kind of a cute shirt but don’t love it!
3.0,Kind of cheap material but still cute
3.0,Lace overlay does nothing to assist comfort of shoulder cords
3.0,I was disappointed that it was not flame retardant. It was suggested for wear at the beach.  Would not have ordered if I had known that.
3.0,"I really looked forward to adding the blazer to my wardrobe, unfortunately I have to return it because it runs too small.  Whenever I order any garment made in China I have the same problem.  American women are very large compared to the tiny Chinese women.  Too bad."
3.0,Very pretty. It runs very small. Order two sizes up.
3.0,Purchased this ring twice and it broke both times .. 😞 Sad  since I loved it!
3.0,"O.K. Loose fit, have trouble keeping it on and the lining pulls forward."
3.0,The bra runs so small.. I’d advise getting a size up.
3.0,Didn’t work for me. They bent quickly
3.0,So tiny. Fit for a 5 year old or younger child.
3.0,Very see sheer top.... Haven't really decided if I like it...
3.0,"It's a decent watch for the price. If you want something that looks good from a distance this is your watch. It works, but you also have to reset the time about every week or so because it's slow. If you have a small wrist you'll have to make your own holes."
3.0,"The product was very nice. I liked the design and all. I ordered a 7-8 and it fits like a 6-6X. basically the same size that I already had. So if you do purchase this particular swim suit, just make sure that you order the next size up"
3.0,"I realllllly like this style and satisfy with their fabric.<br /><br />But has low durability.<br />I usually go out with my ipad, wallet, water bottle.<br />but it's shoulder strap teared ... I  used them less than 20 times.<br /><br />So, it would be hard to bring what you one."
3.0,"Well the shoes are cute and fit right but literally on the FIRST attempt to slide on foot, the little tag on back ripped off. Womp."
3.0,"It's nice for a tennis racket, very narrow, not really a practical size."
3.0,"Honestly these were not as expected.<br />- They are quite big on the face, covering up the top of the eyebrows.<br />- The front nose part is all flat and the inner ridge are the SAME thickness as the frames.<br />- Came with frittle edges as if the plastic is already slowly chipping away.<br />- The polarized lens is not like the picture portrayed and it looks thin and cheap.<br />I do like that they're matte and have a nice case.<br /><br />I would recommend to buy these if you experience any of the following:<br /><br />1. Finding yourself at risk of frequently losing your sunglasses<br />2. Need to have a stylish spare in the car<br />3. Need a new case with a clip on hook"
3.0,"It's good quality, I gave a 3 star because of how narrow they are and my son has a regular to slightly wide foot. They are holding up okay as slippers in his school, I haven't tried them without socks yet."
3.0,"Used on a backpacking trip. Size runs a little small but not too terrible. Clothing not breathable at all, Not suitable for warm weather. Does well with resistance!"
3.0,"The design style is not bad, but the quality is not good, and the stitching is not good too."
3.0,"Meh, tiara broke in about an hour of wearing it in my Grandaughter hair. The outfit is cute not sure how long the tulle skirt will last. A little on the cheap side"
3.0,The tank tops are thinner than I imagined and wrinkle easily. They are very comfortable though so I will give it 3 stars.
3.0,It's nice but it don't look exactly alike
3.0,"The fabric and print are really great, it’s the cut that is all wrong. There’s something about how the neck and shoulders are patterned that makes it impossible to zip this jacket all the way up. My daughter is really a 3T but I bought a 4T so there would be plenty of room and even with the bigger size I couldn’t zip past her collarbone. Returned."
3.0,"The size seems to run rather small. Beautiful shirt with vibrant pink colors for Kirby.  It seems to be very good quality.  Sadly, the men's medium size is much smaller than most men's medium so it doesn't fit. ORDER A SIZE LARGER than you need!"
3.0,"I have to wear the band very loose so my wrist doesn't get sweaty in the heat.  Keeps good time.  Simple and not obtrusive, just what I needed this inexpensive watch for. i would not wear it for dressup occasions."
3.0,Cheap chain with no clasp. But OK.
3.0,"I ordered this cute hat, scarf, and gloves set for myself.  Love the hat and scarf, but the gloves were so small (kid-size) I had to stretch them to get them on my hands.  The picture is kind of deceiving because you see a young woman wearing this cute pink set but the gloves are so tiny, I was disappointed.  So I then purchased a different set from another company."
3.0,This shirt is soooo soft and very well made. While I normally wear an XL (every other shirt I've bought on Amazon is an XL) this shirt was just too big to sit correctly and it would honestly be less expensive to just buy it again rather than take it in. Sigh.
3.0,"The custom is nice, the size is perfect it’s good quality, but the mask it’s a rubber mask not plastic so it comes “flat”, I had to order another mask because the one that comes it will keep a fold line in the middle."
3.0,I tried on the dress and noticed that it is much larger than expected and then when I put my hand in the pocket there was a hole. I was so excited to have pockets in my dress.
3.0,"Looks exactly as pictured. I got a US6 and I'm 5'3&#34;, 130lbs. I'm bigger in the butt and smaller in the breasts so getting it over my hips was a little challenge but once it was over it didn't fit my chest very well. There is some extreme padding in the breast area and it even came with extra, but there's so much that it just looks unnatural on my chest.<br />It also lost most of it's color in the washingmachine, which I'm disappointed about but kind of expected. Overall not bad."
3.0,doesn't fit
3.0,Didn't like the material. It was spandex and the dress is sheer so be careful what you wear underneath it. The dress is very tight to show off your figure. My husband liked on me.
3.0,"It's just ok, the hook on the top a liitle bit too thin for me  on this type earring but the drop crystal still looks shinny not too bad."
3.0,I loved this dress. But one time on low heat in dryer and the tule puckered and ripped. Don’t put it in the dryer!!!
3.0,"Decent shorts, but the zippers and pockets are really funky, long and seem not to be in the best locations.  OVareall I wear them, but not as much as I'd like because of the look/fit"
3.0,Bought this for Halloween. A little bit too small at the chest area and too long for me. But overall quite nice.
3.0,"I love the soft fabric. The dress is very comfy. The thing I was dissapointed about, was that the neck was really big and weird."
3.0,My new Nike Classics came with laces that were wayyy too short and they don’t sell replacements. These are the right length but they’re kinda cheapy feeling. I have a hunch that they won’t last long but they came in a 3 pack so I guess I’m covered.
3.0,They break rather easily however great for little kids.
3.0,Nice sweater.  But the color not much with the pic... disappointed.  The quality ok
3.0,"Umbrella itself is nice, color is much different then picture shown, not a fan"
3.0,I like the glasses. They are &#34;OK&#34;. They are a little lite for my preference. As a sport glasses I would like a pair that is a little heavier and less likely to bend from simple handling or being thrown around the inside of the car or during sports. I am not refering to abuse as sitting on them just being normally handled. They bend fairly easily. Other than that they are good quality lens and clean easily without scratching if you use a liquid to help lubricate the lens during the cleaning.
3.0,Stretchy how described but very fitted in the thigh and butt area making look like yoga pants
3.0,"Not bad, the ex has it now but was good while it lasted"
3.0,"I bought this on 2/1/17 and within the last week it has literally fallen apart. The belt buckle part has lost both screws and doesn't seem to fit, gorilla glue didn't even fix it. If you're looking for a cheap belt to take into an interview, get this belt if you don't plan on wearing it for more than a month.<br /><br />Edit: within a couple hours after posting this review, I got an email exclaiming they were terrible sorry about the belt I got and were very ready to either fully refund me or get me a new one. I asked for a new one. Bumped up to 3 stars for the exceptional customer service."
3.0,"Pros: Thin design is exactly as promised.  Holds quite a bit but is not bulky.<br />Con: Material it is made from makes it have a ""krinkly"" noise when handling it."
3.0,Finally got them in today. Great colors as the picture shown. Three stars because the sunglasses are kinda flimsy but great for the Texas sun!
3.0,"This product do not have a lining, also it is not true to size."
3.0,I bought it to protect my toddler no only from sun but also from the virus as it will protect as face shield during this pandemic.  The material is great but its a bit tight on my 2years old head. He will outgrow it in few months for sure.
3.0,I had the Paper Wallet which is ultra thin and minimalistic.  This wallet is considerably bigger and bulkier.  Live and learn.
3.0,"Very nicely made and nice material.  Seems to run a little large.  Sheer back so will need a cami or something.  Does not include bra cups and the lace is revealing, so maybe not so good for larger people.  I'm 185 5'7&#34; with 41&#34; bust and 53 years old."
3.0,The pendent was to large for a young girl!
3.0,"I didn’t like the way this fit my head at all. It looks super cute when you’re not wearing it... but I put it on and it was way too loose (even if I made it tight in the back), and it was too short, didn’t hold my hair in at all like my other hats do, ended up returning it."
3.0,I just can't believe they make these.
3.0,product looks like picture but material is somewhat thin and cheap feeling not to mention somewhat see through as well and therefore did not look as great as picture.
3.0,"Edit: after I posted a 1 star review, the company contacted me to make it right. So, 1 star for product (for me) and 5 stars for service.<br />Original review:<br />The whole purpose of this item's existence is to stay, and it doesn't. The nonslip grippers are there, but it's really big. And I'm an"
3.0,"I exchanged for a larger size. Typically I’m a 12, wanted a 14 for a relaxed fit. Does have decent stretch, but not flattering when filled to capacity!"
3.0,"The sweatshirt has a boxy fit which is comfy and cute, but it is too short on my body. I am 5’7” and I would like it to have fit longer. It is a borderline crop sweatshirt on me."
3.0,These are cute but they aren't pugs
3.0,"The graphics look great, but the shirts do not match. They are made by two different manufacturers; ergo two different greys. In my case, the &#34;hubby&#34; shirt is at least two shades darker than the &#34;wifey.&#34; Not what I expected. The wife loves them though, so I'm good."
3.0,Good material and the size was right. Not at all flattering for a plus size gal. The necklace is poorly made and isnt the color shown. I ordered 3 shirts and all came with the same plastic brown necklace that breaks with any amount of force. (such as a baby grabbing)
3.0,"Bought this while I was pregnant, they seem to be okay, are soft and a thin material but not seeing through. They ended up in this condition even I have wear them just a couple of times."
3.0,I think the style is really cool... But they are really small.  I would have liked if they were average size for adult glasses.
3.0,Cheap material but worth the price.
3.0,"Didn’t hold up well, wasn’t impressed with that."
3.0,"Eh. They look alright, but they crawl a little too high. They hang just a little outside my ears and that can be annoying because it is easy to knock them out of place."
3.0,Very stiff material & uncomfortable.
3.0,"I really love this dress, but I ordered a small based on reading other reviews saying it ran large and it’s still too big. For reference, I’d typically order a medium in dresses (5’6”, 140lbs, 34C). Unfortunately they do not offer XS so I’ll have to return and find something else."
3.0,"Within a month of wearing these boots a few times, the metal rivets around the lace holes are already starting to come off. Comfortable boot but not the highest quality."
3.0,Cute but very cheapy.
3.0,"After reading the reviews I was a little hesitant but I really wanted this for my trip. I am a small (26 inch waist) and decided to order both the medium and large. I tried on the medium first and it actually fit perfectly. I do wish there was a slit in the waistband so it would tie better but it will definitely work as it is. If you don’t mind showing a little leg go one size up. Otherwise, size up twice."
3.0,"It was not what I expected, and I put it in the poor box."
3.0,Feels smooth and silky. Looks really big though.
3.0,"Small, very small, sizing.  Go up one for a more comfortable fit.  Small pouch up front.  Love the minimalism, though."
3.0,I loved them until I put them on and they were almost two sizes larger
3.0,"I bought this dress because of the perfect 5-star rating on Amazon. Don't let that fool you as it fooled me. I usually wear a Medium / Size 10 and have a 38C bust. I was worried that it wouldn't fit me in the bust area but everyone else who reviewed said it was true to size so I ordered Medium.<br /><br />Of course it didn't fit! I have broad shoulders and a broad back so the dress fit everywhere but the bust and shoulder areas. I don't mind the deep cut of the neckline but because the button loop is made from a stretchy material, the dress does not look good whether I keep the dress buttoned up or open. Even if I wore a camisole underneath it, it would still look too small in the bust area because the dress does not fit right on the bust. I'm not even sure sizing up to a large will help. Super bummed because it is a pretty dress but it really doesn't work for me--and I wear a regular medium. If you have broad shoulders plus a bust line larger than a b-cup, I would suggest you keep away.<br /><br />The material is also pretty thin and feels &#34;plastic-y&#34;. While I personally love the style, my bf couldn't stop giggling because he says it looks like a housedress--so there's also that. The embroidery is good though and doesn't look like they would fray easily. As it's unusable, I have to return it. I probably won't trust Floerns clothes anymore because it doesn't seem they are wide enough and a lot of their other clothes also have no stretch."
3.0,"Highly disappointed with the pattern. On the model is flowers and cotton and what I got was giant brown leaves and flowers. I almost feel like I’m wearing camo. With that said, fit great and super comfortable. Lots of compliments just very let down in the pattern."
3.0,I like that these pants have pockets and they fit well enough. They definitely feel a little starchy still and are not as comfortable as my other pants like this but it wasn't worth returning in my opinion. I just wouldn't order them again and wish I hadn't in the first place.
3.0,Cute but not as pictured. Definitely not cotton. Shows seems when on which I don’t love. Fit my newborn with plenty of space to grow.
3.0,Cute overall but cumbersome to close with the strap. And the rolling over the top part for closure is kind of a pain too. You can't ask for much for a little over $20. I removed the black sash and folded it over normally.
3.0,Dress needs ironing all the time you wearer.
3.0,returned. looked really cheap.
3.0,"Love the color, quality and value! The fit is so-so. The pockets are not well made or flattering. So, if you’re like me and need extra room in the hips, this is not the dress for you (unless you like wearing Spanx under a sundress). ** For comparison, I bought a different brand, same size, with pockets,  and it fits beautifully. **"
3.0,I can not really review this item as I sent it to my grand daughters to play outside.  It is a spring theme item so thought it would be a fun costume to run around outside.
3.0,"These were beautiful, but I do have sensitive ears to heavy earrings- they just don’t work for me. Too much pulling. But I can really only stand a feather-weight earring so might be fine for others!"
3.0,Not comfortable need to return
3.0,"The band was nice and easy to get on. Unfortunately, it didn’t hold up well and the band detached completely where it locks into the watch."
3.0,If you are doing very light work then ok gloves. But anything above light work the rubber will separate and then can’t grip anything.
3.0,Looked very nice but had to order 2 sizes bigger.
3.0,they break easily...
3.0,"You can really tell it's fake. It's a nice necklace, but the friend I bought it for said it’s a bit to bulky looking. Ordered a 3mm instead."
3.0,"The purse itself was perfect for my dress, it's made out of sparkly like foam but it doesn't look bad. I was surprised by how much it fit inside. The worst thing about it was the strap it attached to my hair and refused to let go several times as well as my dress, it actually ripped out some tulle from my dress. I would definently get a different strap (it is removable) and then it would be perfect."
3.0,"Pros: stylish, cut narrow, lightweight materials, cheap.<br />Cons: lightweight materials, poorly sewn seams, cheaply made."
3.0,The material is very nice and comfortable but they run small. I got an xl and I could fit it them but they are too tight to wear
3.0,I like the design but the bust and waist was a little tight
3.0,The doll bathrobe came with a rather Large Hole in the front of the robe.
3.0,This is just eh. The top fits a little snuggly and the buttons are just sewn onto the dress so you cannot unbutton them to adjust at all. Maybe the fit would be better if sized up? (I got small which is my usual size) Not my favorite.
3.0,Buttons were ugly and only fell off first time I wore it to the office. Other than that was okay.
3.0,"looked very nice, got many compliments. people thought it was MUCH more expensive than it was.The band however was very cheaply made and broke off after 4 uses. If i were to attach a new band, it would be good as new"
3.0,I ordered a black with silver leather  bands  but does not look black it looks dark brown the  It leather  feels nice but the color is not accurate
3.0,"Holds all my credit cards.  I just wish I had read the description closer and saw that it was made out of felt.  Not sure how it's going to hold up, or how long it will last."
3.0,"I ordered the 3-4t for my almost 3 year old daughter, and it was too small. She is approx. 38 inches tall and 32 lbs. Will be returning for a larger size and will update my review."
3.0,They dont really work that great for non skid socks. I so pilates and kickboxing and I still slide all over my floors. I think its because there isnt really any non skid dot things in the heel or the ball of the foot and with high arches the only non skid part doesnt even touch the floor. The reason I am giving 3 stars is because they are pretty comfortable and the non skid part does keep them from bunching in my shoes when I wear them so thats good I guess.
3.0,"Material is fine, it's just a big baggy square shirt. No shape or form. But at $16 it's not a huge disappointment."
3.0,I ordered an XL because the reviews said to size up...it’s HUGE up top and gaping and I’m a 36DD!its super stretchy so don’t worry about it fitting the top half!  It ’s basically a moomoo with a belt!
3.0,"The bottoms are waterproof , but if your grass is long, the tops get soaked!!  I bought them to take my puppy outside in the middle of the night. Please buy larger--I wear a 10, ordered the 10-11 and am on the back edge of the slipper ."
3.0,"These gloves have a strange, puffy design on them, and the color is a very light beige--I thought they would be more skin color so not to be so obvious when wearing them. I doubt if anyone has skin this light color. Disappointing."
3.0,Buy two sizes up.
3.0,Was not a good fit or fabric was not as expected
3.0,"Hurt my ears after wearing them awhile. Not as comfortable as my costas, but they dont have bifocals. Bought them because I got them way cheap."
3.0,"I bought these because of the no nickel added (allergies). I like them but the posts are rather thick. Though I've had piercings for many years, my holes aren't huge because I don't wear heavy earrings. They can hurt going in if you're not used to that. Just something to be aware of!"
3.0,"The xlarge gloves did not fit my husband's large hands. When I held them up to the large that I ordered separately, you could not tell the difference. The fingers are longer but not wider. Disappointing fit."
3.0,The cups are smooth but they are a little bit of an odd shape for my body shape.
3.0,"Leather band fits Activite Steel well and the hardware feels secure. The color is more orange than I expected. The item photo just uses the promotional image of the Activite Sapphire, which comes with a higher quality leather band. This is a low quality leather that feels like it will work fine, but looks cheaper than the image used here."
3.0,Trendy and all but not really made well. The edges are pretty flimsy and don't stay flat. They curl in random ways. Thinking about taking it the cleaners so the can Starch and press it.
3.0,The fit is as expected. I bought an xl in hopes it would be long enough for me (I’m 5’9”) but it is not. The bra part could technically fit over my boobs but not comfortably.
3.0,Because I love Sailor Moon. It would have been better if they did not put the black writing on the earrings.
3.0,"Not what I expected.. at all. It may be something for someone else, but I do not like it."
3.0,Good quality but not very comfortable too stiff
3.0,I absolutely love this lip ring! I gave it 3 stars bc one of the beads fell off as I was screwing it on. 😭 It was pretty devestating. 😭😭😭😭😭
3.0,"These are looked so cute in the photo I just had to buy! I'm just disappointed that they're not as dainty as they look. The heart is really thick and big, it just doesn't do it for me."
3.0,Se ve mejor en la imagen
3.0,This is a great concept and definitely something I need for traveling. The quality is not great though. The smell of the inside is awful and skunky. I had to leave it open for a few days and febreeze it down twice before it was a tolerable smell. The insides are stuck in with glue and you can hear the glue crackle when you press the lining so I don’t know how long this product will hold up.
3.0,"Would never buy this coat again unless you put in a stronger zipper. For this big heavy coat they put in a zipper that is more appropriate for a thin sweater. What a waste of a perfectly good and warm coat. Don’t want to return coat again because zipper will most likely break again. Also, because zipper head is so small, it’s difficult to get it zipped up. I bought a size bigger than I actually wear because wanted to add more warm clothes if needed under the coat, so zipper did not break because it was too tight. If you put in a stronger and bigger zipper let me know. Right now just plan to throw the coat away because am tired of dealing with it."
3.0,"Nice product, decent quality, just didn’t fit the way I thought"
3.0,"From my wife:  The elastic is a soft elastic. So its comfortable.  I am a 36DD and a size 12.  Usually this would make me a &#34;Large.&#34;  But I wanted something a bit baggy for a cozy summer sleepwear.  This XL &#34;fits.&#34;  But with the elasticity- its HUGE!  I could easily fit two of me.  Again, the elastic is soft and it fits, but I probably could have gotten a similar fit or a slightly better fit from a Medium."
3.0,"this color is richer then expected and much pinker. I had ordered the version 2 thinking that this vers 1.5 was gonna be the tone of your average peach &#34;tickle-me-pinkish &#34;white person and that the version 1 would be for vampir-esque pale white people. But alas this is not so. verson 2 was too saturated for my skin. And I spent a lot of time in the sun, have very short hair, I'm asian and my complexion is that of somewhat sunskissed"
3.0,"This bikini is really held back by the fit of the top portion which makes it impossible to wear it effectively, without having my parts fall out. The problem is that it is spread out extra wide which doesn't provide a good hold. This is unfortunate because I really love the color of the top, but its useless to me.<br /><br />The bottom portion fits me perfectly, so as long as you follow the sizing comparison and listen to suggestions made by other reviews. If you don't mind having to worry about something falling out, or are willing to spend a little bit of time altering the top then this is a beautiful bikini for the summer.<br />I was offered this product at a promotional price in order to test and review it. My experience does not reflect that of other reviewers or the manufacturer. My rating is honest and unbiased"
3.0,"Quality is above average for this price but not sized for men. Usually mirror finishes have some reflection from the rear of the lens but these have a pretty extreme amount, even in doors the reflection of your eyes and whats behind you is obvious."
3.0,"All the sequins make it heavy, so it tends to slide down.  I had to remove the adjusters on the ear bands to even get it to fit.  Also, in the picture, it looked like it was flesh colored, but it is definitely pink."
3.0,Cup size is to small. Order at least 1 cup size larger and one size larger in inches.
3.0,"Too small. I purchased the same skirt in white at a boutique, same size. The one I just purchased was definitely a smaller cut."
3.0,"It is a nice band and feels comfortable, I bought two but on one of the the magnet came off. How can I contact the seller for this?"
3.0,I liked the sweater at first but it shrank pretty bad.
3.0,"I really like this swimsuit. The fit is amazing. I'm a size 2 and it fits great. Unfortunately after 2 washes (delicate cycle/hung dry) and 2 wears one button fell off already. That was disappointing, I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,dislike short ankle length
3.0,Functional if you don’t have lots of cards. I’ve had several cards fall out trying get to a credit card.
3.0,They are cute but smaller than expected
3.0,"It's nice. I know it's supposed to be tight, but it's a little too tight. Good reason to drop a few pounds."
3.0,It was comfortable but very big. I no longer wear the dress due to the poor fit
3.0,Cute pants but I ordered a size XL but it was a little tight and the waist was too low... so I returned it.
3.0,"A cheap, basic watch. It tells time, has an alarm and stopwatch and has an option for a 24 hour clock. The light is not good. It is small and light and the band is made for people with small wrists."
3.0,"The picture makes the dress appear to be a shiny fabric, but it is just a flat knit like a t-shirt."
3.0,"They are very warm and soft, only had them a couple of weeks not too sure if they will last, the product description mentioned Australian wool (which I believe because of the wool warmth and texture) but failed to say made in China which is obvious once you see them. Reasonable value for the price I think."
3.0,"My bracelet broke the day I got it, BUT.. it was $3, so what can I expect. I put it back together pretty easily."
3.0,I ordered a 2x.  It looks like a medium.  I'll give it away. :(
3.0,Its cute and I like it a lot but I only wish it was 100% cotton and that it would stayed on my face better.
3.0,"Little diamonds around, are barely noticeable. Priced ok."
3.0,Shrunk down to a short large after the first washing
3.0,"This mask is really lovely it's metal material an it came flat. You have to shape it to your face but still doesn't fit as well in the nose area,it pokes out. I ordered the left side an received the right side but Other than that it's perfect."
3.0,"Those gloves are not reflective - disappointed about it.  Did not have a chance to use them yes, since it's a little warm right now."
3.0,The quality control could be a bit better. One glove definitely is a lot more snug than the other. I don’t think these gloves would fit most men.
3.0,This says that it is a 14 pack but I only received 12 in a package. I kept them because I needed them for a project that I was doing and didn't have time to send back and get different ones. So beware of quantity not correct.
3.0,"Good sunglasses, but I returned them as I preferred another color. Customer service was easy to work with."
3.0,"You will want to keep these in their case, because the frame is very easy to bend/break. I'm on my second pair in 3 months. One of the hooks broke off and I was removing the clipon from my shirt pocket. The top bar is so tin that it bend too easily as well. Once my second pair inevitably breaks, I'll go looking for another brand.<br />The lenses are very nice, though."
3.0,"Nice, but small. I would have given it a better rating, but sizes are not US sizes. Be very careful. It's about 3 to 4 sizes smaller. I ordered a Large, but it was really a Extra Small."
3.0,"I<br />love<br />love<br />love<br />these earrings. I wear them everyday. The stones fell out on both earrings before a month was up…<br />Luckily I found them and re glued them in.<br />I think the summer, with swimming and all that was the contributing factor. I still love them, I just used heavy duty glue… hopefully they stay.<br />I check them now to see signs of wear.<br />They are very light and flattering.<br />I love how you can wear them long or short.<br /><br />Update.. stones fell out again. Lost  one, but I was able to Reglue the other.."
3.0,Good product but is not anti fog
3.0,Not as good quality as I expected or is advertised.
3.0,chain is smaller tan expected and gem is to big and heavy for chain
3.0,"I typically order a men's medium, but this ran a little small. One size up should do it. Washed in cold water and hung to dry and had no shrinkage."
3.0,"Very thin, had to return one that didn’t work. The cord is odd and only works with a certain type of charger. I wouldn’t purchase another. I’d go with a better brand that costs a bit more in hopes it would work more efficiently. I guess u get what u pay for!"
3.0,"Wish I would've gotten the next size up, they are a little tight"
3.0,Everyone loves the dress it’s beautiful on I will order again. I am short 4ft 5ins so the dress fits right to my knee and I wear a 38dd in bra size not sure what size my waist is but I do wear a size 12 in dresses but my jeans are size 11 according to the fabric.
3.0,"I sized according to the site, and then I sized up knowing its one of those Asian clothing products that has taken over Amazon (sad!) but it still fit like a tight tunic, It is however, very cute. It's very low cut so you might want a tank underneath if you aren't trying to show off your girls"
3.0,"I would love to give this dress five stars and the only reason I'm not is because while it's advertised as &#34;purple&#34; it is not purple at all, not even plum. The pictured dress looks purple on multiple screens, computer, phone and tablet but if you are shopping for a purple dress you'll be disappointed to receive a burgundy, maroon at best, colored dress. The fit is nice, hits at the knee for me, I'm 5'3 and 140 lb. I would recommend this dress based on style, but I do like the color burgundy/maroon. I would order this dress again in another color though. Hopefully that helps!"
3.0,Its a little feminine for my taste.
3.0,"Love the fit, but is definitely navy not black."
3.0,"The colors and design are very pretty - but the scarf itself is much smaller than I anticipated. It's kind of thin and shorter than most other scarves, and it reminds me more of an ascot style scarf. Great price, and pretty design, though!"
3.0,It’s made a little off. The neck and chest opening is too wide and the waist is very small. Seems homemade in an amateur way.
3.0,I bought a pair of black ones and I loved them.  These gray ones are too tight and a bit uncomfortable around the middle. I was disappointed they didn’t fit like my black ones.
3.0,I bought these for my boyfriend. He thought they were very thoughtful and sweet. I anticipated that these would be a little big smaller. I should have double checked the dimensions and the weight of the product. I would recommend this if you don't any key chains on your key ring.
3.0,Super cute but the threads have fallen out of the sleeve already. Super bummed.
3.0,It is too small so my husband cannot wear it. It took so long to be delivered and it was a disappointment.
3.0,"Bought this undershirt in medium.  The fit is great and the material is top notch.  My concern is the collar.  The collar is extremely thin for my taste.  It does not lay as flat on my neck as I would like.  I bought this shirt at the same time as a ribbed undershirt.  I prefer the ribbed brand because of the collar.  If thin collars are your thing, then you will like this shirt."
3.0,Very comfy and a go to on those days in the summer and fall when you just don't know what to wear. When this arrived the hem was WAY wonky - like the sides gathered on the ground while it sat perfectly on top of my feet. Luckily I didn't mind altering the hem myself with my sewing machine. I feel like this may be annoying to someone not willing to fix this themseves.
3.0,"Does the job, once you know how to use it, doesn't come with instructions. Else, like I said, it did the job."
3.0,They are nice although I wish they were a little thicker and held my belly in a little better.
3.0,I love the style and fit of this shirt. The only downside which is a big one is after I wore it once it looked very worn and old. The fabric is not the best.
3.0,Fit chart inaccurate
3.0,Looks cheaply made. Striped area looks brighter in person than in picture to me. Length and fit is great except snug in the bust. I am a large busted woman though.
3.0,"The fabric was nice and I did not see any stitching flaws. The size was so very far off, way too small. Gave it to a friend. Found a different tunic. But may take a chance if it hold up for my friend."
3.0,Collar has a whole inch + that didnt get stitched.  Adorable dress. Fits great. Poor quality and I have to return it.  Unsure if I trust that another will have any better quality even longer term.
3.0,This dress does look cute but is that super cheap materials.
3.0,My only issue with this dress was that it is SUPER short. Like I am 5'0&#34; and it is short on me (ankle length) which is awkward.
3.0,"I have always had Isotoner gloves with no issues, however these seem to run small. They don’t fit properly and I should be able to use touch screen technology with these gloves, and I have difficulty because of the fit. Disappointed that I will have to size up, and then they will probably be too big"
3.0,"too short, i am 5.7"
3.0,"I usually wear a size 18 and I have DD breasts, so I bought the 3x. Because of my chest size, the waist seam rose much higher, just under the breasts, making the dress much shorter than I expected, about upper thigh. I purchased the purple dress and it is MUCH DARKER than displayed. At first, I thought it was black. However, this dress was purchased for a cosplay, so it will still work just fine. The material is thicker than I expected, too, which is great."
3.0,This material or maybe the color of the light pink was see through
3.0,"The suit itself looks exactly like the pictures. I ordered a 3x, because I normally wear an XL. The bottoms are a bit tight, but fit just about right. The top however is held together by a flimsy little stitch. So it shows everything. Doesn't hold your girls in too well. The top was a tad over sized. I wear a 36dd and it was too awkward to wear the top. The bottoms are awesome for someone who is overweight or has stretch marks. Would have been better if I could have chose a smaller size on the top.overall it worked for what I needed it too."
3.0,"I opened these and one of the bras had the padding put and one of the straps was broken. So that’s super disappointing...I tried one on and it seems to fit pretty well. Packaged super weird.<br />One was wrapped individually, the rest were just loose plus the weird broken one with the pads out."
3.0,It is really difficult to use but overall good.
3.0,Liked this until I had to use it on latest trip.  It did not fare well during transit.  This was a one time use cover and I was hoping for more use.
3.0,Too small 😕 Color was great!
3.0,Cheap. Knock offs.
3.0,"I ordered two of these cardigans - one black XL and one gray L. One never knows with sizing. I normally wear large.<br /><br />I didn't see a big difference between the large and extra large. Both fit fine. The material is fabulous (not that shiny, thin stuff) and the crocheted lace is a pretty, feminine touch.<br /><br />My one and only issue with both -- and the reason I returned them both -- is the pockets. The slant pockets hit exactly the wrong spot on me. :( They add a bit of bulk where I do not need any help, TYVM. I like the idea of pockets, but these slant pockets are not forgiving on my body type (hourglass with a slightly bigger top than bottom). If the pockets were the sewn-on square kind, this would be perfect. The square pockets would serve their purpose in both utility and style, while not adding bulk.<br /><br />If a bit of bulk added to your hip area isn't an issue, get this! I'm on the hunt for something a bit different."
3.0,"The shirt is a pretty shade of gray, but it is way too large for me. I ordered a small, and am convinced I was sent a large with a small tag on it.<br />The garment itself has a strange odor to it, and feels like a paper bag."
3.0,The model in the add must have skinny arms the sleeves looked longer than they are.
3.0,"They're to small, it's very hard to get on."
3.0,Very light weight... but they went over well with my guest.
3.0,Quality lacking. Very thin.
3.0,Hoops are very small and so already difficult to manipulate while you apply them to your ears. But the style of clasp makes it much harder. I deform them pretty much every time I remove them & then have to bend them back into shape. Nice quality otherwise.
3.0,"It was too small I gave it to my thin neighbor, she likes it"
3.0,I bought the 2 pack and received 2 pairs as advertised. Quality and packaging seemed to be nice. However I have to return them as they are peach not pink and the dance school did not approve. If she was allowed to wear a black leotard or some other color I could have gotten away with it but not for true ballet pink.
3.0,"Fast service, but I had ordered two medium backpacks, expecting the same size. This one was a lot smaller than expected and unable to use for school."
3.0,These are clearly PU but they are pretty.
3.0,"I love this earcuff, but it did break after wearing it some. And I wouldn't buy it if you have sensitive ears."
3.0,Money clasp is not strong. Money fell out
3.0,Was a little disappointed with how it was made. Chain gave the impression of dirty. Kept it as It was cheap.
3.0,"Not very well made, I had to attach some of the stones that had come off during shipping. Would not reccomend."
3.0,These are high quality boots that fit me terribly!  I typically wear a 10 and order a 9.5.  Way too sloppy after just a short wear.  I literally walked 1 mile and got a huge blister.  Put them in the closet forever.  999 miles left if anyone want to make an offer : )  Try these on in person somewhere and decide for yourself before dropping 300+.
3.0,"I bought this bag for a 6-month trip to Europe and North Africa. The “locking” zipper on the main compartment broke about 2 months into the trip and security was kind of the point of buying the bag. I also found the layout of the bag to be somewhat awkward. I thought I’d get used to it after 6 months but it just never really worked for me organization-wise (one simple addition would be a pen pocket). It is a roomy bag and the end pockets easily held a water bottle or umbrella. These pockets are short, however, and tall bottles will fall out. Bottom line, I wouldn’t buy this bag again."
3.0,Nice top but seemed somewhat small.  The particular top received smelled of perfume (probably because of someone who previously tried it on). Returned.
3.0,Bough this for my 10 year old.....way to large for her face.
3.0,Nice earrings.. 1post was  bent when recieved.
3.0,"Size up if you are a large, It fits but a little snug. Anytime I order legging site unseen large fits perfect these however are snug so I would size up. Material is lovely not sheer."
3.0,They appear well made. Just to short for my liking.
3.0,they are super huge just an FYI I have others that are a bit smaller but still flashy that's what I was hoping this would be since I lost the other pair but I was let down. I wear them once in a while but beware they weight down so be careful they stay on
3.0,The sweater itself is great quality fabric. I usually wear a medium but ordered a large because I wanted it to flow a little more. The large size was far too small so I just gave it to my 15 year old daughter who is a size 0/1 (XS). It fits her fine.
3.0,Not crazy about the fake slide rule bezel that doesn't rotate. Relegating the stop watch second hand to the small dial instead of the large second hand makes this function less useful.
3.0,The elastic is to small but it's a great slip.
3.0,"Liked these. I’m a 16. Too small in the waist and hips. I’d have ordered again in a larger size had it been available...were a bit thin, but that’s ok in the sweltering Deep South where we live"
3.0,n/a gave as gift
3.0,Wooo
3.0,"I got this sweater because it looked very cute online, but I got it the other day and it fits too small. They need to make the clothing to fit a little bigger. The material is okay, but it stinks of chemical smell and it has no washing instructions, so I don't know what to do because of the fur collar. Not happy with this purchase."
3.0,"I'm so sad, cuz it's so pretty. The waste must be cut for really petite women."
3.0,Cute but hard to put in for a 7 year old
3.0,"They are a nice fit, stretchy but not too much, and are comfy.  However, they are way too long for me.  I am 5' 2"" and I bought the large.  I will have to get them hemmed at a tailor, which is an added expense I was hoping to avoid."
3.0,"The bow is a little awkward in its small size compared to the band, but it fits as expected"
3.0,I bought these to wear in the summer under my scrubs to cover my tattoos. You can see my tattoos through the sleeves. They stay put for the most part. The fabric pills easily if you get Velcro stuck to it.
3.0,"Two weeks in and the class is starting to rust. I like the look and feel of it, but it's already having issues."
3.0,The material is very thin but I like the colors.
3.0,Christmas present for my granddaughter
3.0,The sweatshirt was bigger than expected and the drawstrings are like 4 inches too long . It’s ok !
3.0,Daughter loved them but the Velcro wore out pretty quickly(1.5 week).  Cute and comfy otherwise.
3.0,I bought this band as a back up for my Garmin HR+
3.0,"Way too small, I re-ordered a size larger, hope they fit."
3.0,The crystal is about the size of my pinky nail and the chain is too long. It doesn't look terrible on but it will sit lower on your neck than in the picture
3.0,"This is a decent replacement for OEM, but pictures show it with quick release pins. There is a note at bottom of description about installation of pins. It may be easy for people with small fingers, but for me it was a major pia. It might help if they had a video explaining how to install. Given the option I would have paid more for a band with pin preinstalled."
3.0,"I bought these for my 12 year old son. They washed very well. One downside is the inner boxer brief type liner is very loose on his legs. Otherwise, they fit true to size, and they have nice bold colors on the fabric. He feels that they are too short on him, though. They come to about 1-2"" above his knee."
3.0,"The good: Nice and spacious as advertised. The color is so pretty, and I love the extra compartment in the back.<br /><br />The bad: The button clasp does not stay closed, and keeps popping open. Not a huge problem, but kind of annoying. Also, the card slots keep leaving some kind of residue on my credit cards, and it's screwing with the microchips and magnetic strips. I'm able to wipe off the residue before I use ithe though, so again it's not terrible, just annoying and inconvenient"
3.0,"Pretty comfortable shoes, nice and lightweight, but the sole feels a bit slick on wet surfaces. Started squeaking on each step not even a week into wearing them but for less than $20, I think a week walking around Boston and NYC was good enough for the main amount of use."
3.0,I absolutely love the jumper however i had to get it hem and my hips and butt was to big for the zipper. I ordered a medium b/c I wear a 10 but If i got a bigger size it would have been to big in the bust  and I'm a 36D. I did manage to wear it to a wedding though and got a lot of complements
3.0,"Tried a friend's night-driving glasses the other day and loved them, ordered these and was immediately disappointed. They're great for simply changing to a different color filter for a while, but do very little for reducing halo effect from lights or making signs easier to read when glare is a factor. I will be going to my optometrist and having a real set of glasses crafted for me. I may use these frames if possible. They're reasonably comfortable and the lenses cover a great deal of usable vision space."
3.0,"I wanted to adore this necklace, I really did. The design is lovely, unusual and captivating. However, the part that lays on my neck doesn't lay flat and is extremely prickly and itchy feeling, to the point I'm not sure I can ever wear it. Am so very sad."
3.0,"They will be OK - a little on the small size (except length, in fact a bit too long, and I am about 5 ' 10'').  Well made."
3.0,"I liked that it fits perfectly, and the ruched details as well as the vertical lines at the front look nice, but it had an imperfection in the seam at the chest area and that made the cups look a bit uneven."
3.0,These gators are slightly longer than others. You can always trim to size
3.0,This belt is too long for Rigid TS24241 unless the blade is all the way up. Which is unsafe and does not help me cut half lap joints.
3.0,Super cute! A bit small but you can re-size with FIRE. They do get caught in sweaters and things but they are so cheap it’s not a big deal. Better than Depop prices ;)
3.0,"Love the shade of purple.  Not as thick as most winter skirts but definitely not thin or see-through.  However, the skirt runs about 2 sizes too small."
3.0,Definitely small. I would order 2 sizes bigger.
3.0,"Really nice but very thin and will make your skin feel a wet sensation and cold. I suggest you wear something like a sweater under it. Even in a hot summer rain your skin feels cold underneath, but it keeps you dry."
3.0,They fall off your face easily
3.0,A bit on the cheap side but what can I expect for nine bucks?
3.0,"Just tried these on. I normally wear a large but these feel a little more like a medium.  Especially in finger length for forefinger and thumb.  So I’d say these are probably women’s sizes not men’s (or some unisex compromise).  Here’s hoping they stretch out a lot over the next few rides...<br /><br />Update: still going strong two months later.  Seem good for commuting down to 30 degrees.  Keeping my hands suitably warm for 30 minute rides - with some chill during long, highspeed downhills.<br /><br />Updated review:  fell apart after four months of weekly commuting (10 3-mile rides a day).  Holes in fingers.  Shredding fabric.  With my very casual usage profile, I'd assume these would probably survive 4 or 5 serious rides before falling apart.  Review revised downward."
3.0,"I initially bought these for my kids for when they transition back to school. These masks are WAY too big, even for me when I tried them on. I haven't washed them yet so I'm hoping it'll shrink a little to be a better fit."
3.0,"I wear 10 for men's size, it feels smaller size to me.."
3.0,This Shoe Slider can be very slippery if you are not use to it.
3.0,"Nice set of studs but on the small side, of course worth the price, got them for a stocking stuffer my daughter will like them, she loves blue and CZ."
3.0,Looks different from picture.
3.0,"I love the color and fit, looks good"
3.0,"Its pretty,  but much bigger than I expected."
3.0,the gold is not nice looking
3.0,I wanted to like them. I like the rough nature of the stones and the bezel mounting. I would have preferred them in silver instead of gold plating but the deal breaker for me was the color. One was yellow and the other was grey. If they had at least been the same color I would have kept them.
3.0,"The eyelets came off about the third time I tied the boots . The boots were comfortable and waterproof but if you can’t tie them ,what good are they?"
3.0,it is strong but it is also bulky. Think 1/4 inch  square on your neck all day. not comfortable
3.0,I gave a previous review of 5 stars and it does keep good time but the day and date become disassociated.  They just can't stay in sync.
3.0,I didn't like the idea that the cap did not have a bridge on the inside of the cap to keep it firm.
3.0,The dress is very cute! It’s not cotton it’s polyester. I’m 5’6 140 and a small is too tight. I re ordered it in a Medium. Hope this helps everyone.
3.0,I do like the look of this bag. However I thought there would be a net side pocket on both sides. It's only on one side. Also I bought it because I wanted a smaller bag instead of a diaper bag so I do like the size of it. I have 2 little ones & carry both of their cups with me. I was really disappointed that the side net pocket was so tight & small. It is a struggle to fit a toddler sippy cup that is smaller to regular size (not a bulky one). It is a very snug fit for a small water bottle (some brands of water bottles may not fit).
3.0,"After wash the waist string fell out, they shrunk so now a little snug.. other than that they are ok.."
3.0,"They were just as pictured and extremely cute! I wore them as the maid of honor in a wedding. They were a little difficult to walk in, because they kept sliding off my toes and then would flop all over the place. The one kept breaking on me too, overall they did their purpose for the wedding and looked good for the day. I probably will not wear again, especially since one we had to &#34;ghetto-rig&#34; to keep it in place."
3.0,"How well you like the Croakie will probably depend on how you like to wear your glasses.<br /><br />What this thing is a eyeglasses lanyard or tether.  It's the variety with the rubbery-latex figure eight thing on the end that you can tighten around the arm-joint near the actual lenses of your glasses.<br /><br />Personally, I'm not all that keen on the design.  But I didn't know that until this purchase.  (I'm new to glass wearing)  I find I like the sort of tether with the cloth that fits tightly over the ends of the ear piece, but this present design isn't all that bad except for the length.  It's seems really short to me.  I mean when I put them on my glasses must touch my face, whereas with the other style I have plenty of room and don't have to worry that I'm going to poke myself in the eye, (did I mention I'm not all that coordinated.)<br /><br />The short cord also means the glasses must be closed when 'hanging free' because otherwise the arms touch your neck.<br /><br />If you don't mind the short cord it's a decent buy.  Otherwise keep shopping."
3.0,"The shirt is very cute and i like the material, its sort of stretchy spandex type fabric. The problem is the design was printed incorrectly on the shirt so it was not centered, went to one side 2-3 inches more than the other side. I ordered a new one hopeing it would be correct but it was the same way. It would have been a great shirt if it weren't for the print being uncentered."
3.0,"nice product but runs small,  order 2 sizes larger"
3.0,"I am giving this 3 stars for 3 reasons.  One, the fit was great, but the color was much darker than the picture.  Two, I knew the sequin fabric would be a little bothersome, but after 5 mins, my skin was all red from it rubbing - so nit great fabric.  Three, if you have any kind of bust, it is much shorter of a shirt than expected."
3.0,It's not a bad buy but I do wish the cut was a little better. The A line style could have been more flattering and slimming  if it wasnt so wide beneath chest and above the waistline.
3.0,"After a few wears, the armpits started to ball."
3.0,"Comfortable, well made & good color. Could be a little longer. I'm 5'10&#34; hits approx 3-4 inches below belt line."
3.0,"Beautiful dress!!! However, it was a little too big for me and it was missing a button. I'm giving it 3 ⭐️s because it came to me missing a button..."
3.0,It looks cheap .
3.0,"Good looking set of glasses, size is just a bit too narrow and lenses a little shorter than I prefer to keep the frame out of vision. Good enough for a garage set but I wouldn't want them for reading."
3.0,"I've been a customer of &#34;Simply Whispers&#34; since the 1980's when nickel allergies were almost unheard of.  However, I haven't been able to find just plain hoops that I like with them.  Ordered these and got them right away; they are absolutely nickel free (unlke the junk you can buy at stores that say &#34;nickel free&#34;.  Just realize that they are NOT shiny (if that's what you are looking for-I wasn't so it doesn't bother me) and the clasp is a little flimsy, not sure how ling these will last."
3.0,Runs small and the arm holes are not as open as pictured. Go up two sizes if you want the look of the picture.
3.0,"I got this to hold hair ties. It's a nice bracelet, but the hair ties don't stay on it very well. I wouldn't recommend buying it for that reason."
3.0,its ok..
3.0,"These are cute shoes, however when you tighten them it pushes the little ones toes out out the front and then they look too small. And if you don't tighten them then they can't really walk in them."
3.0,Little disappointed in the length - the chain is very long and there’s no way to switch it to a different one. Also took a really long time to ship...that being said it’s a cute statement piece.
3.0,"necklace is nice and looks just like the picture but when I received it, the chain was broken. I make jewelry so I was able to fix it easily."
3.0,Too tight! Very pretty Big disappointment for my granddaughter!
3.0,The one I received was not bright and color was dull. but is nice size and good chain.
3.0,too bad the quality is good for the money but it fits like a mans 2x
3.0,Jut OK - top is kind of stiff.  The cushion sole is soft.
3.0,Love the color and this style<br /><br />Quality so far seems to be fair for the cost<br /><br />Only dislike the adjustment part is very stiff but maybe with time will break in and adjust easier
3.0,Wore slippers for 3 days before the knot unraveled inside and out. See pics. Typical fit for new slippers.  Nice and snug.  That fit lasted about 3 months with my last pair.
3.0,Very nice weight and feel. Color was perfect. Order a size up runs small!! Extra large is about a 12-14 size.
3.0,False visual presentation of size.
3.0,Grey lenses made things look dismal.
3.0,"I had to do a bit of modification,it's all double lined,and the tie is t adjustable,it just for decoration,wish it adjusted.i am glad I ordered it bigger so I can wear a belt with it."
3.0,Nice dress somewhat disappointed with the hue of the butterflies and the stitching.
3.0,"Unlike other &#34;universal fit&#34; novelty slippers, these are actually sized for smaller feet. I purchased these for a female relative; she wears a 6.5 US/37 EUR, and claimed they were a perfect fit. I was also told the down side; the sponge used for the soles is on the lower-quality side and has compressed to a thin, flat &#34;cardboard-like padding&#34; on the pressure points after just two weeks of daily use. However, for $15 with Prime delivery, there are no regrets."
3.0,The frame came with stain
3.0,"I purchased these as an alternative to wearing heels for my Halloween costume this past year. While I didn't end up using them for the costume, I did keep them just a an extra pair of shoes around the house.<br /><br />I do like the way they look but they were too big. I wear a Size 7 and they run very large and very wide in my opinion. I recommend ordering a 1/2-1 size down for a better fit. They do not offer the greatest of support, but like I said, my intent was for a costume that I was wearing for one night out of the year.<br /><br />I do currently still wear them out if I need a quick pair of shoes to run to the car or something but i wouldn't recommend wearing them for long walks around a park or anything."
3.0,The warch is GORGEOUS but the glass has come off already leaving the face of the watch & the hands exposed.
3.0,"I saw where someone else said these were tagless, that would be amazing. Instead they came with the tag sew on the outside side hem.... so weird and I'm not taking the risk of it looking odd under clothing so they are going back. I'm bummed because they are soft and thicker material."
3.0,"The blouse is very nice but it is way, way, too small.  Gave it to my daughter so that I did not have to return it."
3.0,"It wasn’t for me, but it’s very cute dress"
3.0,These are pretty but VERY very tiny!  Read the description.  8mm is much smaller than 1&#34;.  Description is correct but photo is misleading.
3.0,Too thin you can see through it and it is cut some. I recommend 2 sizes up.
3.0,Beautiful dress on. Only problem was that it was somewhat small. Even ordered one size larger and dress was snug.
3.0,"I've ordered 3 pairs at different times.  The first pair was excellent and did not have a logo written on one of the lenses.  The second needed some manipulation to fit properly and did have a logo on the lens.  The third pair did not fit well at with minor manipulation, one of the earpieces broke.  At some point an earpiece from the second order will likely fix it.  It also has a logo on the lense.  I will not order another pair as I find the logo in the corner of the lens distracting."
3.0,"It is a nice looking watch, but from the other customers pictures i was expecting a mans size watch. What arrived was a woman's size watch. I might be a little bigger than average on size, the watch looks so small on my wrist its laughable. Well one good thing that rose gold watch will look good on my wife. Only reason I am giving this product a 3 star is because it look really nice for a woman's watch."
3.0,"I thought this would be more like tshirt material or softer. It's polyester, not stuff, but not very soft, doesn't fit flowy like the picture"
3.0,Color is very dark looking
3.0,"I am typically either a Small or Medium, so I ordered both sizes in this jacket.  The Medium arrived today and it fits like a small. It is comfortable enough, but I wouldn't want to shrink it in the dryer.  To give you an idea of my sizing, I am 34C (Natori) or 34D (Victoria's Secret) and I wear Small in Land's End tops, Medium in Old Navy tops, & size 4 in Veronica Beard, JCrew, Ann Taylor, and most other blazers. My LOFT and Ann Taylor tops are typically size Small.  (If I were to purchase this jacket at Old Navy, I would get a Medium and it would be perfect, but in this brand I am tempted to try the Large.)"
3.0,Love the color and style but runs small.<br />Beware....
3.0,"It's the cheapest possible gorgon headpiece you can get from Amazon, and yet it manages to feel like a bad investment. While you can bend the snakes into a better shape, their wires are still cheap, and there's little you can do to improve the pieces value for for money, it's sheerness (not even sure why that's mentioned, it's snakes on a black ribbon headband), or make it more comfortable."
3.0,One of them came with the adjustable string already broken.<br /><br />Besides that these are actually (2) very good and rather breathable masks.
3.0,color is peach not ivory
3.0,"Was so excited to receive the Eplaza socks, but after wearing the black ones twice my big toe poked through. My nails are not long, so perhaps a design flaw.  I was disappointed in the quality. I had been looking for the silicon grip for quite some time. I hope the others hold up better. I would probably purchase again."
3.0,Too small and I usually fit a large. I love it and I'm keeping it since my size fluctuates a lot.
3.0,"Cute pattern, seems to be well made, but smaller than expected."
3.0,Weird material and comes apart easily. Seems started unraveling after wearing once.
3.0,Fit as expected. I wear the swimsuit to exercise class. Covers a lot wish the legs were a little longer.
3.0,"I thought it was going to be a burnt orange color and it is more of a bright pink/orange. Shirt is soft and logo looks good, but I’m not impressed by the color."
3.0,Pretty but the buttons are strange gold pointy things. They dont stay closed. Ibhad to replace them all.  The stitching on the arms is really poor quality. Not sure it will last long.
3.0,"First, really good quality band. Comfortable and easy to install.  However, my ""black"" appears to be more smoke gray.  I wish the inside of the bands color was the color of the outside as well. This doesn't look good at all with the blacked out Samsung GW3 unless you want a more 2-tone look. Pics attached to validate my comments"
3.0,"I love the keychain, but was not what I was expecting...the keychain that I received was darker and with less white on it as pictured."
3.0,The product is sturdy and well made.  Band is elastic and quite soft and comfortable.  the only issue i have is the sharp edges around the clasps attaching to the watch itself.  i am worried that i might cut my wrist so i'm going to use a dremel to round the edges before wearing it long term on my wrist.
3.0,"Pretty shade of seashell pink. The faux leather looks fine, probably it won't bother you that there's stitching down the front bringing the two side pieces together, but it's there just fyi. Otherwise, it's like the picture--a flat pretty wide brim and a bit more than half that is pink mesh. It's comfortable because the band in the back is adjustable (pink plastic band with holes that moves over another pink plastic band with small pink plastic &#34;pegs&#34;.  On the back of the mesh, in black embroidery, is &#34;About last night&#34; which seems completely unnecessary to me and black on pink doesn't even look good. Plus a black embroidered &#34;splotch&#34; that I guess is their logo but looks ugly to me. So ugly I dropped off a star. But maybe it appeals to other people. I don't see why the company thought it would look good to have a big black &#34;ink splotch&#34; on the back of a pink cap. (Or so it looks to me).  It's comfortable, but I wouldn't have the lettering or the logo. :<br />Ground Fabric: 90% Polyester<br />7% Cotton 3% Other Fiber<br />Coating: Polyurethane<br />Back Panel: 100% Polyester<br />Visor Lining: 100% Cotton<br />Exclusive of Decoration"
3.0,"My daughter is 16 and has a small face, so she had to keep adjusting it. It is a very nice quality mask though and has a nice black ribbon you tie to make the fit as tight or as lose as you need or want."
3.0,"Fit well on the bottom half, however the top straps wouldn't stay up.  Wish that could be modified because rest fit well."
3.0,"Costume Jewelry like. Definitely not something you want to buy for a wife if you are hoping to get something cheap that looks expensive. You can tell its cheap. But holds pictures just fine and its pretty. More suitable for daughter, friend, or a spouse as long as you probably buy another gift with it. I thought it felt and look cheap... Then again it was. Does hold a picture on both sides when opened."
3.0,Bought a size up but was still short and tight
3.0,Came torn and fits small
3.0,"I have difficulty getting the zippers to align so I can zip the coat!  Takes me up to 10 tries each time I wear it!  This morning I couldn’t get it at all so I wore it just snapped but there are only 3 snaps so big gaps are left open for the wind to get in!  Would have preferred just one zipper pull to zip up only.  I understand the idea behind being able to unzip  from the bottom to give more room for legs to move but the fact that I can’t get the zipper pulls to line up to be able to zip the coat is frustrating!!<br />  I like the cuffs  sewn in the sleeves to prevent wind, snow and rain from getting in."
3.0,They are a bit small to position.
3.0,For the price this shoe was alright. Would not buy again though.
3.0,The design is very nice<br />Bracelet is not the best the pins came out and almost lost my watch
3.0,"These quickly had strings coming out, looser than others, and seemed way off brand."
3.0,"The pants are nice quality. However, they run short and fit like an ankle length sweatpant. I'm afraid to dry them because they might shrink."
3.0,"As soon as I opened the package, it reeked. The smell is akin to what you smell when you walk into a house of reptiles at a zoo; it was a very distinct smell. I don’t know why it would smell like this as it’s not made of any kind of animal skin. It did feel durable, but the material is fairly scratchy.  It’s also way too large for a 30” umbrella. You wouldn’t be able to easily take it out. Returned immediately."
3.0,"Much smaller then expected, but will make a nice Christmas gift for my daughter. I initially purchased for myself, but was not at all what I was looking for size wise."
3.0,"The shirt is just okay. Looks as described in picture, but not the quality I would expect, and I have received from other Ferrari logo items. The flag on the arm is curled up almost as if the shirt was previously washed. The logo on the chest is an iron on and NOT embroidered to the shirt. The fit is very small."
3.0,"Love this dress!..So much in fact that I have ordered it in about 15 different prints & solids..<br />They are so cute, extremely comfy & flattering..and very fairly priced.<br /> Not made of cotton but I see it as a plus. They wash well & don't easily fade or shrink.<br />No need for ironing-just toss it in the dryer, remove it while its warm & hang it straight up.<br />Can be dressed up or down, with leggins & boots, or with pantyhose & nice heels..<br />I highly recommend these dresses!"
3.0,It was a gift so I do t know what it cost. I like it and was surprised to receive something with GaGa on it. Wish is was gold.
3.0,The photo of the product looks nothing like what I received. The colour is more of a peach and fabric is more like a gym shirt pullover. It would look ok dressed down with gym leggings but not as is pictured on the model.
3.0,"No presté atención a la descripción,a diferencia de las fotos, los lentes son azules, no negros"
3.0,Material is good just to large and long
3.0,I might return them. They were cute but the material was stiff and  I just know  five minutes of walking in them and they will rub my toe. It was a bit smaller than I would want it as well.
3.0,Okay but are not especially durable
3.0,Too snug and not slip proof
3.0,"Cute skirt, but other reviews said this skirt was really really long. I couldn't wear heels with it it was so short. Returning."
3.0,"The quality is nice enough, but fitting is not true to size; they run very small."
3.0,Zippers on pockets pop open under little stress. Other than that they fit good.
3.0,I have a tall mod section on my body yet the mid section was way too long and the breast area was way to small.
3.0,"Very thin material that tends to slip up my leg as I walk. It’s not a bad buy for the price, but I’d rather pay a little bit more to get something of much better quality."
3.0,"In most any shirt, I wear an XL. Since this was a tshirt I thought I should order a size bigger. I'm glad I did as it fits close. The design is great!"
3.0,Runs about 1\2 size to large
3.0,These are not 92.5 silver they flunked the magnet test. Very disappointed
3.0,The material is very shear almost see through.
3.0,Kind of see through. Not as shiny as picture.
3.0,The material was great. If you have a large chest it’s perfect. My only complaint was that the flare was so big that I looked like I weighed 260lbs when I don’t so I had to return it.
3.0,Good basic slip.
3.0,"These were not at all what I was expecting.  They are warm, but very thin. Most of them are see-through when you bend over. I still wear them around the house and under another pair of pants, but never alone out in public."
3.0,"The leather is very processed, but it still looks nice. It also creaks when you move your arm which I hope will go away with wear. It is nice though"
3.0,Color is nothing like the pic
3.0,"The PJ's are super cute, and comfortable, the top fits fine, but the bottoms are more like capris (which is not suited to winter PJ's)"
3.0,I was pretty disappointed of how cheaply this was made. The facing doesn't stay in. The fabric is really cheap feeling.
3.0,"The boot is beautifully crafted and appears to be very well made.  Unfortunately, it is way too small to be a EE width."
3.0,"Very pretty dress in photo, however, I was a little thrown off by the material. I ordered a size M because of reviews. It is a little snug, so I am trying to lose some weight. The material is okay. Not my favorite. I thought it would be thicker, but it is quite thin. However, for a maxi floral dress, it is flattering. I would not recommend this to a friend and I would not purchase it again."
3.0,Runs small and is not for tall women
3.0,The quality was very poor
3.0,"the embroidery looks more ornate in photo, will need to purchase crinoline for the puffy dress effect. nice dress for the price point"
3.0,I wanted to love this top. It is so cute. I ordered a small and it ran big. I returned it.
3.0,cute charm but not for pandora bracelet as i thought it would be
3.0,Just did not work.
3.0,"Cute, but too big. Based on other reviews I sized up and it was entirely way too big. I returned this item. The fabric was very stretchy, which I wasn’t too keen on. It’s a fine shirt, but it wasn’t for me."
3.0,This jacket was ordered in a pinch for a birthday celebration.  It was labeled as rose gold NOT more pink than anything. I would say it was just okay for the price I am satisfied. I would say shop around online because I seen this same jacket listed for $120 somewhere in California. It could be more fitted but it is nicely lined.
3.0,"Interesting designs, rather thin material.  The photo and the design made me expect something a bit thicker - like a crew sock.<br /><br />But they are similar to other socks my Mom wears, so she enjoyed the gift."
3.0,"I love the zebra pattern, but the fit is weird. Size up. As some have noted, the pattern stretches with your body, so bigger is better. These worked great for a Halloween costume. I can wear them to work out at home, but would not wear them fir a run or to the gym - they wouldn’t stay in place."
3.0,Hanger works but the one main problem with it is that the area where the shoulders are isn't rounded down enough and creates peaks in the shoulders of the wetsuit.
3.0,"Not as wide as I expected, can fit my laptop but not much else."
3.0,"I mean, this ring is HUGE! I honestly never thought it would be this big but it is! I opened the package and laughed! For the price I paid I'm going to do a  gag proposal to a friend. Not gonna lie, the thing is on my finger now cause it sparkles and shines but it is nothing that I will wear in public to pass as a serious ring."
3.0,"Should have read the review!  Even though there is a matching water bottle in eqch picture, the backpack does NOT come with one.  Total bummer give the cost of this set!  But my daughter will love it none the less."
3.0,The metal fob is shiny and nice.  The printed image quality does not match the photos in ad.  Cannot read the cursive writing due to fuzziness.
3.0,"Cheep design,not what I expected. But I decided to keep them since I was told I look like Neil sedaka in them LOL! The materials are not so great quality I expected more."
3.0,Product does not have fly
3.0,color is not that pretty
3.0,This fit great the first time I wore it but after one wash I guess it shrunk. My pants were high waters and it wasn't like that before.
3.0,"Just tested out the gloves. It is not ""wrong"" that the gloves are somewhat thick enough to be not detected by the touch screen. However, the joint of the pinky can still be detected by the display. I will probably keep the gloves and use an old sock to make it a bit thicker so the display can't sense it.<br /><br />I don't recommend this to users whose tablet cannot support active  stylus."
3.0,One came with the Abalone inlay slightly cracked.
3.0,purchased for myself but giving to a 10 year old as they run small.
3.0,Got a small and and fits tight. Already made a hole trying to put it on. Should order size up than usual
3.0,I got the black. The fit is a bit frumpy and not very flattering.
3.0,one choker broke after wearing it for only a few hours
3.0,They don't stay on!
3.0,"Pros: It looks very cool; It is easy to set; and the band is easy to adjust.<br />Cons: Forget about seeing the time in bright sunlight; You have to push the top button with your free hand to see the display; and if you accidentally hit the bottom button when the display is on, it will go into set mode."
3.0,Works for a dress up time
3.0,Ok hat .....
3.0,"cute, but So. Short.  I'm six feet tall, and this looks like a shirt on me.  It would probably be nice on a petit person."
3.0,"These are beautiful socks, but very small and tight.  I wish they came in a larger size!  I'll have to give these away."
3.0,"Great fit, but not compression at all."
3.0,Not what I expected. Material is warm but flimsy.
3.0,"Color is not as vibrant or solid as in the product image. I did not expect these boxers to look already faded upon arrival -- they look like something already owned for a couple years. But aside from that, the material is very soft, and the boxers fit just right."
3.0,"So, at first it worked just fine. I was wearing it a lot and it worked well and then after a week I put it down for like a day and then I started to wear it again and it just wouldnt work. It didnt matter how many times or how many different direction I moved it, it just wouldnt work. After 30 to 40 mins of it just being still it would finally move....it just is so inconsistent. Not quite worth the price. So everything I wrote before this sentence you can totally forget and scratch out! I am making an update on 8-30-22 now. So before I just didnt know I had to winde the movement first sometimes. After you winde the watch it works the way it should. Now I do have a different complaint. I have had this movement for  few months and it still works but not totally. The date function is broken, it is stuck. Idk if its because I kept having to take the watch apart several times to adjust things like the hands so it may have been my own doing but the point is it no longer works. I can manually change it from the first pull out stem position but it wont change as it passes 12am."
3.0,This product was nice looking online but in your hands not so much! the Silver casting was cheaply made and it lacked that solid feeling of a real solid bracelet!i will say this the overall bracelet looks nice but not what I would  recommend!
3.0,Cuts a little bit lower in the hips than expected and I have a long torso.
3.0,"It looks very cute, got it for my 7 year old daughter. Unfortunately, after 1 day it broke, when she tried to<br />Take it off."
3.0,I based my purchase off of the measurements of the size chart.  It is way too tight.  I will be returning the Medium I purchased and sizing up to an extra Large.
3.0,"This racerback top is good for exercising but it is made cheapy so I don't see it lasting past one summer.<br />The material of the blouse is thin so it's perfect for a warm summer day or the beach. It would look great paired with some shorts or capri. It isn't super see-through so you can wear it solo and not worry.<br />This top is a little on the short side for a tall woman so you could wear it easily if you are not tall but if you are you might consider wearing it just for workouts and wear your sports bra underneath it.<br />I probably would not buy this again since there are better tops out there<br />* I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review and unbiased opinion. I rely on the reviews of others to purchase items on Amazon, as well as other sites, and I do not take the review process lightly. I hope that my findings are helpful in your decision to purchase or not purchase. I do not review items that are not of use to me. I am not paid by the company for my review, and my review is the same as it would be had I paid full price. *"
3.0,I don't like the chrome buttons.It fits great. It wrinkles easy and feels like a cheap motel 6 sheet.
3.0,Adorable.  But too large
3.0,They are ok.  The elastic one broke as soon as I tried to put it on and the beads went everywhere.  The rest are nice for the price.
3.0,"It’s really attractive and looked great on, but I had to adjust the size with my jewelry making tools because it was way too big and slid off my elbow. The clasp continually breaks and needs repair. This is not a high quality item, but nice for the short term."
3.0,I like the fabric but it's hard to walk in this skirt; it's cut very small and doesn't have any give around the knees.
3.0,"So I’m 36C bust 120lbs @ my heaviest 5’8 with a long waist. Reviewers are correct in saying the buttons gap open a bit on the bustling and normally I’d wear a small in this type shirt but listening to Amazon Community I sized up. But that didn’t help the gapping @ the bustline. The top is long enough to cover the top of your jeans well and the arms are comfy and not tight or pinching. I ordered the ones they had left in different colors, unfortunately some of them were “add on “ purchases and missed the opportunity to get this top in those colors. For the money- the gap is forgivable and I feel the stylish pockets & tabs on the arms detract from the gapping on the bust. For ladies w/ a smaller chest I feel like this would enhance your bustline quite a bit & definitely enhance your figure"
3.0,Even though size was specified it &#34;seemed&#34; bigger than imagined.
3.0,I ordered a medium and it was huge. Definitely need a small.
3.0,A lot larger than it look in pictures
3.0,"Elegant, simple and pretty. But its not ivory."
3.0,They are much bigger than the picture.
3.0,The buttons would not keep the top portion closed over my chest.
3.0,"I was so excited to get this shirt and ordered a larger size, but it wasn't large enough.  I am 5'5&#34; and am a size 14-16. It fits through the shoulders<br /> and bust really well (I do not have a large bust) but is not as loose fitting as I would like it to be around my hips. It is also quite long on me. If you have wider hips or a large bust you should probably go up a size larger than you think you need (check out reviews).<br />And now I will get to the color. The color is not at all what I expected. The green is shown as a darker foresty-green color, but mine is more like bright grass green. It looks much brighter in person than it does in the picture I shared. It also has strings around the seams and buttons that I am almost afraid to trip for fear of starting unraveling. It is a cheaper top and not the color I expected but I think it will work for a weekend shirt but not for work like I'd planned."
3.0,got it in may and June 22nd latch broke<br />love the wallet and fit.<br />what can i do to get a refund or a new wallet?<br />would have gave it a 5 star if the latch was still working..
3.0,The product looks faded and the quality of the color doesn’t look to good
3.0,Lots of styles but some will not wear look too cheap. I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,Runs small and I could not get the ties in the front to lie as nicely as they do in the pics
3.0,"Bangles are suppose to be loose, it is too tight."
3.0,It's OK except that it is very hard to replace the battery.  You almost destroy the hat just trying to get to it.
3.0,"Bought a large for my bf and it's a little snug but the material will probably stretch. It's a decent hat for the price, my only issue is how it's shipped. It arrived in a plastic bag and totally flattened, I've been trying to get the wrinkles out but haven't been successful yet... Pictures attached. Hoping I can fix this by the end of the month for DragonCon."
3.0,I am size 25-26 with jeans/pants .  I ordered small but it's too small!  Defintely not America standard size.
3.0,"Good quality, comfortable and fits pretty nicely BUT it's too short.  I'm 5'6 and this dress is above my ankles.  I like my maxi dresses long.  I planned to order more but won't now."
3.0,Didn’t came with the belt 😖😖
3.0,Thin material.  Not really corduroy or very cheap.
3.0,Color seems a bit off from the photo. Thought it would be darker
3.0,I ordered the Large based on reviews<br />I'm 150 lbs 5'4 and I should of ordered the 8/10
3.0,"Very small and a bit cheap looking, but would be cuter for a child than an adult."
3.0,"Bought the earring expecting it to be close to the same size as the in-ear picture indicated. It was much larger than that, almost twice the size. Unless that ear model is actually a giant with ears the size of an average person's hands, the picture is misleading. Only buy this if you want it to be bigger than it's represented in the images."
3.0,The nose piece fell off right away and we tried to glue back on twice.
3.0,"Fit somewhat big, making my son trip over the toe when walking with much speed.  After a few weeks of wearing they did slide and were somewhat difficult to keep on his feet.  The grippers were nice when he was learning to walk and the socks were soft on his feet--not leaving any rub marks were other foot ware did.  Would buy again simply cause he did walk well in them at first, they are super flexible and easy to learn to walk in, and they are cheap!"
3.0,Not really worth the price.
3.0,"You get what you pay for. The loops on the earring were not the same, one was a lot smaller than the other."
3.0,a bit tight.
3.0,"PRO:  Pockets, color, and style are very nice.<br />CON:  Loses shape and fit quickly.<br /><br />Despite trim figure, these leggings stretch out... lose shape and fit *very quickly.  Slide down, bunch up.  Embarrassing to hike up waist band every 4th step. Ugh."
3.0,It fits smaller than expected. I went a size up due to reviews but still find it a bit small.
3.0,"What I ordered vs what I got... what’s up with the two circles on the chest? However for my ladies 5’9 and up I’m 6’0 and the length wasn’t bad. I felt like it was an awkward length, so I’m going to knot the bottom. Overall material is great and the back is a racer style."
3.0,"If you are tall and thin, then this will look lovely.  For me, as a plus size woman, not so much.  I feel it makes me look HUGE.  Will be returning.  The fit is nice though, but not for me."
3.0,These are really for preschool aged kids. They would not have fit my 7 year old.
3.0,"They're nice, but came damaged."
3.0,Sock runs wide at the ankle. Not a big issue if your child has a shoe size bigger then Toddler 10. ( I’m guessing)  My son wears a size T8 shoe and the sock swallowed his foot enough that he can’t wear them yet. Still great quality sock saving them for when needed and just ordered another bag of the size 1/2. Thanks.
3.0,"Good fabric structure and design, but fit is too small. Order a size larger if you like this top! (Medium that was ordered fit more like a 'small')"
3.0,Works great but new screws are getting rusty
3.0,It ended up being too big for me. The return was easy and I got a refund right away.
3.0,They looked cheap I gave them away.
3.0,I can't give this 4-5 stars because the watch band isn't actually leather.  It's PVC that looks like leather but it is certainly not leather.<br /><br />I removed the clasp and added it to my existing leather band.
3.0,"I bought this and another dress from Amazon for a formal event. Both of the dresses were shipped from China. The seller contacted me to ask if I wanted to have the dress custom altered, but I needed it as soon as possible, so I declined. The dress ended up being very, very long (I'm 5'8&#34; and wore 5&#34; heels, still skimmed the floor) and the top was very loose - needed lots of pins and tape to hold it all together at the event. I will probably get it altered now that I have it. The construction is quality although the materials leave something to be desire, which I expected. I received several complements on the dress throughout the night and it was fun to wear aside from a couple pin mishaps.<br /><br />In sum, if you are looking to buy this dress make sure to order it WAY in advance of the event, especially if you want the seller to alter it. The projected delivery date was about 5-8 weeks after I placed my order, but I told the seller I needed it by a certain date and they did their best to get it to me on time, which I appreciated - but it should not have taken that long to get to me in the first place."
3.0,Did not like look but quality very good.
3.0,Looks good but for the price I would expect way better quality. Chain material is not longer lasting. Crystal looks great. Metal work is ok.
3.0,cheap but ok. i use it to carry stuff at the gym
3.0,The material is thin. It’s shiny feeling and white inside. Honestly it doesn’t feel like real tights. It’s not soft. I’m not sure how to describe it but I tried it on and felt like I can’t really wear it. It’s unfortunately bc I really want to exercise and promote autism awareness. I guess it reminds me of cheap Halloween costume material. Such a shame. It also is kind of loose for me.
3.0,"I wanted a 14&#34; but thought the 13&#34; would be OK.  When I measured this, it was 12&#34; with the clasp, which was way too small for me.  It is also very thin and I don't know how strong it would be with any kind of weight on it, but I sent it back so I don't know.  It is very pretty though, sparkles in the light."
3.0,The product is nice I'm giving 3 stars because the belt doesn't event tie around and has no room to even make a bow. I'm a size 6 and the shorts fit great it's just the belt that doesn't even touch tips
3.0,Good looking sunglasses made from quality materials however they are not polarized as stated in the item description. I sent them back
3.0,"It’s cute, but definitely suits a certain style.  If you’re looking for a “simple, staple” white shirt , THIS IS NOT IT..  it has a messed up , awkward look on.. cute if it’s 70% off  the $98.00..."
3.0,It was fine at first but then after a couple washes the material stayed stretched out.
3.0,Not as big as expected.  Fit over men’s smaller glasses but not over women’s prescription<br />Good sun blockage.
3.0,For me personally it’s a bit uncomfortable to wear and doesn’t fit like a true large but after altering it a little (I cut the back center strip off) it fit a bit more comfortable for me. Love the color and how durable the fabric feels.
3.0,Love the style.  Hope to bring it!!!!!!!!!
3.0,"Like the lace but choker doesn't fit as expected, too large and falls off my neck at the top. &#62;:("
3.0,"The sweater itself is fine, but the pink is brighter than pictured. Not quite a hot pink, but it's definitely not the soft, dusty, pale pink that's pictured. I'm also always readjusting this sweater, as it constantly is falling off one shoulder. Overall, very ""meh."" I'm pretty underwhelmed."
3.0,Cheap made broke on me
3.0,Nice shirt.  Wish it had a little more stretch. Otherwise decent quality and looks very cute on my daughter.
3.0,"I like that there’s a lot to choose from, and the one that contain the small gems are shiny through light reflection, which is good because it makes it noticeable. The only thing I do dislike is that for the other smaller pcs , it’s very difficult to place in , so you would definitely need someone to help you with the smaller pcs! I also wish the price could of been $10.00 I feel like that would be the price suitable for these pcs. But it’s fine!"
3.0,"These were advertised as being very soft, but they were actually pretty stiff.  I was looking for a soft undershirt for my husband to wear underneath clothes, but these are probably better suited to wear alone as t-shirts as they are more boxy and stiff."
3.0,THESE WERE OK. I WISH THEY DID NOT HAVE THE DESIGNERS NAME ON THE STRAP AND THE CORDS THAT THEY COME WITH HAVE A SHORTAGE IN THEM ALREADY
3.0,"This bathing suit is cute but you do get what you pay for. Order this with enough time to wash it before you need to wear it. It has the protection sticker thing on the bottoms, but when you take it off it leaves a sticky residue. I tried to scrub it off because i didnt have access to a washer machine on vacation and it was pretty hard to get off."
3.0,The necklace is cute and appropriate for a young girl but rather cheaply made. The elephant is stamped out with rough edges.
3.0,Not as warm as you would think.
3.0,"I followed the sizing guidelines and ended up needing to exchange my original order for a larger size. They seem much sturdier than other similar bralettes I own. I wish they had a non-racer back version. These straps come very high on your shoulders so they are great for racerback tanks, but show on most more relaxed necklines, even a crew t-shirt."
3.0,I purchased a large (what I normally wear in bike shorts-size 10-12) but these short run very small.
3.0,If my newborn weighed 15 pounds this would be perfect. It’s 100% not for an infant which sucks because I bought it as her going home outfit. I’ll still use it but it’s disappointing. The materials seem nice and it is very cute!
3.0,Did not fit my daughter like she thought it would. They are not true to size and since it was purchased and shipped from a vendor outside the country I don’t know how to return it.
3.0,Definitely not $9 quality. But they’re cute.
3.0,"Great price but a little short on my husband, he may need more of a big and tall size then what this is."
3.0,Is not a real Malachite bead but it looks like it.
3.0,"the dress fit nice but I ordered it in wine expecting a burgundy color as that what it looks like in the picture. But what I received is a red, like Christmas red."
3.0,"My wife bought this as a travel purse, but says the strap is annoying.  It is only long enough for shoulder use if you pull one side all the way down to the zipper and then it bunches up."
3.0,"It is ok, but for me it was too large, then again I'm pretty short so eh."
3.0,Came out to be a lighter green than what was pictured.
3.0,"It's very cute, but it hurts to wear. The top of the flower is constantly stabbing me. Not sure I can wear it for a long amount of time and I hate changing my belly ring."
3.0,The pins that came with it didn't fit to my watch.. now I'm purchasing additional pins hoping they are small and long enough to fit.. to be continued...
3.0,The heel is too shallow so the shoe slips out easily.
3.0,I do like it. I'm 5'1 at 140 lbs and I had to cut it shorter and sew it. It's a bit wide as well but I couldn't do anything about it. I didn't want to ruin the thing by cutting it up some more.
3.0,Stone looks way faker in real life. The mouse is cute though.
3.0,"hard sole,"
3.0,Didn't fit me very well. I'm 5'1 and it would def fit someone taller. It's nice color but want for me.
3.0,A nice quality hat hat is too large in diameter and too shallow.sits on top of my head like a pie plate
3.0,"ran small in size, so I gave it to my daughter."
3.0,I was so hoping to breathe but no go...make my face sweat.
3.0,Too baggy and just awkward fitting. I’m 5’1” 130 lbs and it fits like a burlap sack. Just does not come together well
3.0,Didn’t fit my Mazda 3 key. It looked high quality but unfortunately didn’t fit a Mazda key. So....returning
3.0,Cute but didn’t say it has a clip on —which squeezes the crap out of my ears— too bad really cute
3.0,Fit as expected bought the black previously
3.0,"My wrist is nearly 7.5""--a bit on the large side--and this bracelet did not work for me at all.  It's not a slip-on and it's not adjustable.  There are 2 side hinges that SORT OF open so you can get it on your wrist, but they immediately close back up to the bracelet's original size.  The stones look nice, but the color of the gold on the bracelet doesn't look 'real'.  It's overpriced and doesn't have a classy, quality look."
3.0,"It's great that one gets so many types (and amount) of earring backs. OK, the amount is too much for a person who needs a variety but is not making their own jewelry. Also the little bags the product come in is not resealable. It would of been better if it came in a compartmentalized box or at least resealable bags. Do the backs work? YES, they grip and hold even 14K posts which are thinner than 14Kp or dipped. I wish there was a small set of eight pairs each of the backs for people like me who only need replacements at a reasonable price. We all know that those little &#34;suckers&#34; can get away from us on the best of days. I've been lucky, I have only lost one back and squashed another (two different styles), thus the need for a replacement."
3.0,Gave ot daughter for Christmas. It looked small.
3.0,"My gloves aren't the image shown. But that's okay. I just needed white gloves for a Minnie custom. :) they fit alright , the fingers are a little tight but itlll be fine."
3.0,This was a nice fabric in a cute style but the torso was too short for me to wear
3.0,Did like it but my fault thanks
3.0,These are ok but they are at least one or two size big. Run way big so get a size Smaller. They were falling off of me.
3.0,"My daughter was driving me crazy for these earrings. But once we got them, she was disappointed with how big they are."
3.0,"I guess this could be a great suit for reeaally long torso women. The bottoms reached the underneath of my boobs and the top (when fully extended) came halfway down my thighs.<br />I am 5'6"", 152# I bought a large. It didnt offer much tummy or boob support.  The cups are too big, the bottoms are loose....overall, it's just too big and I'm returning it."
3.0,This was too big for me. Also once I got the suit In person the blue was a bit overwhelming on me. However the pants are comfortable where they buckle.
3.0,The bracelets are fun but the designs and colors are not like the lilly and Laura originals. I would suggest making more neauteal colored bead bracelts. The braclets are sturdy though and hold up well. Good for the price
3.0,"Appear to be good quality pants. I bought  one size up and the fit about right without the armor. With the armor they are snug, which I can deal with. I am a little afraid to wash them, I may just return them. The issue I have is that the &#34;rise&#34; in the rear is too low. Don't try bending over with them. My shirt wont even stay tucked in. The picture makes them look like the rise is very high, not on the pair I received."
3.0,Nice colors and holding up ok...so far.  Found them hard to buckle though
3.0,"Item seems fine, a bit thinner than expected. My real issue is that it arrived fully packed but with dog hair. disappointed."
3.0,"These are decent quality material.  The zipper on one is a bit fussy.  I actually didn't find packing cubes in general to be all that useful, and didn't think the compression feature of these to be easy to use or that helpful."
3.0,This scarf is really cute but very thin. I haven't worn it yet and plan to for the spring because it is not a winter scarf.
3.0,Decent aprons but they have a weird chemical smell.
3.0,Love the style but size was not true
3.0,too big and very difficult to take out the links but it came packaged great with a tool to take out the links.
3.0,"Only issue is how small the wearable area is. For someone with thinner ear lobes they might be better/ideal. I'm finding it incredibly hard to just get the o ring where it's supposed to be. I have never had this issue with any kind of stone or metal plugs before. Also may pose an issue for individuals with thicker ears as the tunnels are screwback, don't pinch your ears in there.<br />Very excited about the price and quality, though.<br />White plugs included are also (at least as of when I ordered this) opalite glass. They looked like more of a solid white stone in the pictures, and I have had those in the past- but no, opalite, which was a perk for me.<br />Lastly, not that it matters too much, the o-rings fit very well. I find with amazon stone/glass plugs they're usually a little too loose for my liking and I have to use o-rings from the last size. These are quite snug without being too hard to put on."
3.0,I love how warm it is but it’s very large for my head
3.0,"I like the shoes, but both of them have spots that have torn around the inside ankle area, and I have only used them for light walking/jogging around the neighborhood."
3.0,I love the color and I love this style but something about the color combo/material makes my butt look like a sad peach. It’s really soft material though and I really like it.
3.0,I like the overall size of the purse.  The opening is a bit snug.  The zipper is difficult to close.  I like to have my purse closed when shopping and driving so things don't fall out.  You cannot close the zipper with one hand.  You have to hold the end of the zipper to pull it across and close.  Fabric and finish is what I expected for the price.  I have received compliments on the purse.
3.0,Really cute as a bathing suit cover up.  A little thin and short on the sides for my taste as a regular dress.  Flies up in the slightest breeze! But very cute for the beach
3.0,"Cute hat, but smaller than expected for a hat that claims to work for several years. My daughter has a normal sized head for a two year old, and it fits her perfectly without need for adjustment. Kind of a bummer, because the adjustability and longevity of the product was part of the reason I bought this. I do like the chin strap."
3.0,Size is way bigger then average. Ordered 8.5 felt like 9.5 or 10.
3.0,I just think the beauty of this mask is hampered by the harsh black elastics.  White would have been the best choice and aesthetically pleasing.<br />~ “Z”
3.0,"The length and width were ok. The only trouble we had was the stretchy strap across the top of the slipper. It made it difficult to put them on (neither my 5 yr old granddaughter or I could do it)... I ended up cutting off the straps to make them a true slip-on slipper - now she wears them every day!! (I wish the top covered more of the foot, but oh-well)."
3.0,"Leather is too thin. The place where the buckle sits looks like I’ve been using this strap for years when it’s been like, a week. The hole is stretching too.<br /><br />The quick release spring bars are fine for getting them off, but they don’t work well getting them on. The cutout in the leather needs to be bigger."
3.0,heel is just a tad too high.
3.0,"I'm 112lbs and 5'1ft tall, I got the XS and they fit pretty well but my only issue was that you can see the outline of the pockets through the pants which is a little funky. Besides that I like them."
3.0,Like the produce however it is not red in color more of an orange red
3.0,It looks great but the little plastic bar was to long and it broke fairly easy. So I had to file it down to make it fit. I glued it back its fine now but just wanted to give you a heads up buyer. My girlfriend likes it but you might have to do the same.
3.0,Not as long as showed on stock picture. Still cute but not what I was looking for.
3.0,works as it should for me keeps my mouth shut when sleeping and reduces my snoring when using c-pap machine.
3.0,"It was a bit tight under the arm. Otherwise its a nice casual dress. Would not wear this for a party. Its made out of sweatshirt type material.<br />One huge issue, the tag was sewn onto the wrong side. It was on the outside. I also received it shipped outside of the package and inside out.<br />So probably a return. Would have expected it a bit more professionally. I kept it for the price, but would not order it again."
3.0,"The colors are a little different than pictured, and they kinda slip off my feet in my shoes. Cute though!"
3.0,I received the Men's slip-on Hiking Boots in the size I ordered but they were 1/2 size to small and were very stiff to wear. I gave this 3 stars because of the customer service was acceptable in that they did not hesitate to accept their return ans send me a refund. I did not order any more boots/shoes from them.
3.0,The dress fits perfect but the turtle neck is big apparently this dress is sold for women with swollen neck
3.0,"These are almost identical in thickness, texture, and fit to military issue glove lines.  Differences are:<br />These gloves have both a nice fit and thickness to hem.  They are indeed &#34;cold weather&#34; liners, meant to be used inside leather shells with a strap across the wrist to cinch the leather.<br /><br />As noted by another reviewer, however, these are 70% wool and 30% nylon.<br /><br />As also  noted by another reviewer, there is also loose yarn at the V in between the bottom of the fingers.  I turned these gloves inside-out and found loose yarn ends in between the base of the fingers that aren't tied off properly. Using a knitting needle and find tweezers, I'll tie these off before using.them.<br /><br />I've owned a half-dozen pair of glove liners are/were standard Army issue (after 20 years of use, though, they've all give up the ghost).  All of my military issue gloves were 100% wool and there was never a loose yarn or unraveling problem.<br /><br />Amazon sells 100% wool military glove liners for about the same price.  I'll try some of those next and update this review when I can compare this with another glove that I have in hand."
3.0,It is quite stiff and so is the strap. I ended up using the strap off a different handbag. I purchased it for the RFID wallet so I will still use it when travelling.
3.0,"The print is crisp and the fabric is soft, however, this cover up is so short it barely counts as a tank top."
3.0,Cute shirt but way smaller than expected
3.0,Haven’t worn it yet. It’s okay.
3.0,"I LOVE this shirt (also, compared to most fo these cheap amazon sellers, the material is actually quite thick and nice- I would wear it without a bra if I had kept it). The shirt, however, is much more cropped than pictured. These pictures are while wearing my absolute highest-waist bottoms I own, and the shirt still looks too much like a bra. I really want to keep it, but I just know I'll never wear it out.<br /><br />I would LOVE IT and absolutely keep it if it were just a few inches longer (and that would still be a crop top!)."
3.0,"Wrinkles easily. If you’ve any extra hip or belly weight, this is a decidedly unflattering patter. Beautiful collar though and love the length."
3.0,"GLOVES NOT INCLUDED! Maybe I was too much in a hurry to notice that the gloves were not included, but look at the picture for crying out loud! Sure looks to me like the gloves are part of what I purchased. Unfortunately the main picture is a misrepresentation of what you will receive. Another similar product was 5 dollars less so I skipped that expecting gloves too with this purchase. Oh well..."
3.0,"This is a nice cardigan but if you're looking for crisp white, it is not. It is more Ivory in color."
3.0,"Although the &#34;coin purse&#34; is too small to fit in my pocket, it is so cute and soft-feeling that I began carrying a purse so I could use this &#34;coin purse.&#34;"
3.0,"Although my size, the fit was too tight."
3.0,Material wasn’t what I was expecting. It looked like I was wearing a towel. Fit was good - material not so much.
3.0,This necklace is very nice.  Looks like the photo.  Average length.  Beads are just as pictured on site.  I would recommend.
3.0,"Great color, good fabric but it really seems like Nike hates fat people. I'm a 6 in pants and ordered a large in these shorts but they were tiny - super tight."
3.0,"The outfit is cute but it had a pen mark on the bodice of it.  I wasn't pleased that it didn't come perfectly clean, it was a gift."
3.0,"Para la comunidad Latina, las tallas de los productos Neleus son mas grande de lo esperado. Es importante considerar que por genética y contextura se debe pedir una talla menos de lo habitual."
3.0,"The shirt came in a simple clear bag package. I was a little disappointed with this shirt. My bust is a size C, and even with buying the XX-Large, it did not look like in the picture. I wish that there was a way to adjust the strap a little because the &#34;ladies&#34; were about 3 inches below where I felt they should be, and because of that the bottom of the shirt barely touched my jeans. The crochet attachment to the back of the shirt seemed sturdy, and I liked the way the sleeves belled out. The material is light and thin, able to be worn even on a slightly warm day. I received a discount for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,"Bonitos los colores y combinaciones, pero al venir sujetadas con una grapa metálica se corre el riesgo de rasgar un hilo. Me pasó con uno de los pares. Innecesaria la colocación de ese elemento metálico."
3.0,It's a little bigger than I thought
3.0,"To short for my likeness and kinda tight even though I ordered up due to bra size. It has built in bra, but not for my size, DD."
3.0,Some are too long
3.0,"Pros: style, good lenses, price<br />Cons: I wear size 7 1/4 hats (head size) they are tight and uncomfortable on my head. So if your head is that size or bigger I suggest looking at a different option"
3.0,Item arrived a day late and was unable to wear for purchased occasion. Nice feeling material.
3.0,"Ordered the peach one and the top is very see through probably need to wear a shirt under also had snags and pills on the stomach area as soon as I took it out of the bag , very disappointed I mean what can you expect for the price."
3.0,"Runs big, thick fabric,gave it to my mother"
3.0,Not taylored at the sides at all but fit perfectly at the bust. 5' 8 approx 140 lb. I ordered for a 38&#34; bust and it was too large everywhere else.
3.0,Loved the color and style but size runs too small. Other than that is a good product.
3.0,I received this watch today it's a bit big and I need to remove 1 maybe 2 links! Is there an easy way to remove a link ?
3.0,Dress was beautiful<br />Very short and size runs very small
3.0,"Fits well, but the bottom of the bra tends to roll up on me and it's really uncomfortable"
3.0,Sizes are on the small size
3.0,It was a gift for my girlfriend. She likes it.
3.0,Ok.... Strap too short
3.0,Quality is great. But a boys extra large runs small.
3.0,"I really wanted to use the jacket, but it’s too snug around my bust and hips. I have a short torso so it was uncomfortable when I tried it on. The material is great, but I wish they adjusted their sizing chart"
3.0,Loved loved loved this necklace and had been looking for one like it for years. So disappointed that the clasp did not work. Wish the charm was just available to get a sturdy necklace. Even one to wear every day.
3.0,"It irritates my skin after a while, but boy does it suck me in!"
3.0,Some what smaller than size says<br />But love design
3.0,nice but broke in a month
3.0,"I love the Polarized effects of the sunglasses.  it really keeps the sun glare down and love the way the sunglasses perform.<br />However, they are NOT that comfortable to wear.  The nose grips really dig in and can be very discomforting.  Love the design,but the comfort level on my nose eventhough it has  the rubber grips hurts at times.  for that reason i gave the product only a 3 star.  I would have given it a 5 start rating if not for the comfort level."
3.0,It will function for what I need but I thought it would be bigger. I guess I didn’t pay attention to the dimensions.
3.0,The fabric and boning seemed like good quality but the cups just didn't fit my boobs correctly. It had kind of pointy cup and my boobs just didn't fill it that way.  I always have a hard time finding a strapless bra. It also didn't provide any support or lift.  I wear a 32B in normal bras. I ordered a 34A as according to other people's reviews which is a good idea. Go up in band size and down in cup size.  I think it would work better for those in C cups.
3.0,"They were just ok,for me."
3.0,I like the color but not long enough
3.0,I thought this was cotton sweatshirt but it is polyester material.
3.0,This last order came with out bags. Everything else was fine
3.0,It should have had a picture with it.  It was really hard to figure out how it went because everything ties to something else.
3.0,Pieces are nice but I’m not feeling yet healing energy.
3.0,Very short shirt not as long as in picture it cuts off at the waist like a crop top
3.0,Thin cheap feeling. Product matches price.
3.0,No es el Dorado que esperaba
3.0,"Great idea, however, they did not fit my heels -- perhaps if I had more time, I could have cut them to fit -- my heels were thin but I guess not stilettos!"
3.0,These are so cute but one of the pieces of the jewelry is missing! :( Returning item.
3.0,Beautiful watch. But...  battery died after 5 months.
3.0,Under packed with weight. Could have 25% more
3.0,"5'3, 130lbs, 36c, ordered a medium. It was fitted across the chest. And knee length not mid thigh. Also, the pockets did not match up. Because of the asymmetric seam across the body, one pocket was lower than the other. Nice thin material. The dress is cute. Gonna try and see if the large is a better fit."
3.0,Love love love the look of this and the idea but the execution left some to be desired. The outside material is a low pile curly material but the inside is a slick non insulated material.<br />You could maybe wear this for two weeks in the spring and a few weeks in the fall because it will not keep you warm at all.<br />Additionally one of my buttons on the left side pocket wasn’t secured and the threads literally fell out on the first try on. Not very impressed
3.0,"I would've given 5 stars if the top garters didn't pinch! Torture for this plus size gal. Otherwise, very good material and fit, solid colors."
3.0,Got large and they don't fit. They feel like they would be like really comfortable.
3.0,A little big and they sent me the wrong color.
3.0,"Good price, however it stretches to much for my needs."
3.0,"This top is very long.  It didn't  appear that long in the picture. If you want to wear it out, it could be a very short dress. If you want to tuck in, wear with pants that have plenty of room."
3.0,"It's a very pretty silver ring and is super cute.  Easily adjustable as well, however it is very poor quality. After a week of wear the bright shine dulled to a matte dark grey and the metal in the ring actually caused my finger to swell quite a bit.  I wouldn't recommend it for anyone with metal allergies and would suggest finding a way to keep its beautiful shine before you buy."
3.0,Nashville not as ledgible in spacing of letters!
3.0,Su calidad es lo que ha costado. Después de 1 uso ya se ve deteriorado.  Es un poco grande.
3.0,Love it! Super comfortable and roomy.<br />You can dress it up with some heels or casual with some cute summer sandals or even cowboy boots.<br />I’m a medium but it fits big. To bad I can’t exchange it. They only do returns. Boo
3.0,The paint started coming off after a few months.
3.0,Very pretty. Runs small I ordered a size larger than my normal size and it was still tight. Stretchy material though.
3.0,"The sizes on these dresses are all over the place. I ordered a medium in another color and it was perfect, just wish it was a little longer. So I ordered a large in another color with sleeves and the sleeves were almost too tight. I ordered a large in this style and I can’t even get it buttoned because it’s too small. They’re nice dresses for the price. I just wish the sizes made more sense"
3.0,"We were very excited for our three year old son to have slides that match mommy and daddy's. They are very well made and comfortable, but fall off our son's feet. I would recommend waiting until they are a little older for these shoes."
3.0,Very Large Blanket Scarf no joke to say the least so large my whole family have a picnic lunch on this Scarf it is more a Blanket than it can be worn !
3.0,"As others have noted in reviews at other sites, these are a very snug fit! Most people's feet are different sizes so that means if one of these shoes fits comfortably, the other is going to be too tight (or too big if you went large on the sizing.) I find the tightness acceptable when driving, but outside the car, these are definitely not made for all-day wear or walking!"
3.0,"I was a little disappointed with this. First, it's not a ""sweatshirt"". Its like a shiny, costumy looking material. The images also look really cheaply done. My daughter still thinks it's cool so I guess that's something. Also I did size up like it says, but I wish I had gone with the 3XL. My daughter is 140 pounds and normally wears a small/medium but in hoodies she likes them baggy and comfortable so I ordered a 2XL. It fits but is is not baggy."
3.0,Didnt come in the color i wanted... very small. Came early though!
3.0,"I thought the word, “glitter”, would be in glitter. Not sure why I was hoping for that. Regardless would have been nice. Instead I found some glitter fabric paint and painted over the word glitter to add sparkle."
3.0,The product fit as expected. Material is a little on the sheer side. Definitely more of a light athletic jogger.
3.0,advertised with belt & did not receive a belt.
3.0,These are not as flexible as they appear in the picture. they are stiff and don't hang as nicely.
3.0,Love how lite weight it is and how it feels! I wish the slit on the sides was not so long and neck didn’t look lunge so much. As far as conformity it is the best
3.0,"very cute bag, broke within the first week of use"
3.0,I loved these overall! But they do run a little smaller than I expected. And I was very frustrated that I bought these socks mainly for the Totoro ones and one of them came without eyeballs. So that was disappointing. Otherwise they were fine!
3.0,Runs small. Honestly I was disappointed. The picture looks much more tailored and better. Material gives and has a slight sheen; pockets are nice and So is the periwinkle color and the shoulder pads. Way too expensive for the quality material.
3.0,Very disappointed I loved the other 2 that came with this one but seriously?  Since when is there a number 8 in son and an a in  rest? Not to mention the quality doesn't look like the picture and this mask was the main reason I ordered it. Waiting a month for this so very disappointed.
3.0,All 3 broke pretty quick
3.0,Give allergy
3.0,I got a small and wore it for several days with no apparent effect. I borrowed an extra small to try. It was a bit tight but the shoulders fit and I could feel that it was pulling them back.
3.0,Great for exercising and comfortable.
3.0,Really thick which makes continuous wear very hard and uncomfortable.
3.0,"Upon first use, the wallet is excellent. Small frame, light wieght, and quick access. After a few weeks of carrying some cash in the band, the band began to stretch and would not hold the same tension on  cards whether I was carrying cards or not.<br />Little disappointing especially since I rarely carry more than 4 cards and 5-8 bills.  All and all great in the shirt run, but not a long term wallet."
3.0,Too large of a shirt. Will be returning the shirt and getting the right size.
3.0,The commercial says easy on and off. I got a pair for my mom and she couldn’t hardly get them on. And they were 3x. But she did get them on
3.0,"I love the simple colors of this sweatshirt. I bought it because I am a fan of the color blocked look. I like the general fit of the item width wise, but the material is extremely thin. I thought this would be more sweatshirt-like and a little thicker. Definitely won't keep you warm.<br />The biggest turn off is the collar. It is a crew neck collar, but it's almost like the collar was sewn on as an afterthought- it sits very awkwardly on my collarbones and even stands up a little. You'd think that it being a crew neck, it would just lay down because it's part of the shirt...I'll post a picture later to show.<br />All in all, I like the colors but I would not buy this item again. I am keeping it since I already paid for and washed it."
3.0,"Wish the manufacturer would've used a metal casing - tin, anything, rather than plastic. Voice sound quality poor (musical greeting cards have a sharper quality). Time piece works.<br />Looks nice - feels cheap - cost more than it was worth."
3.0,Jewel was huge and didn’t hang right
3.0,"The top is plum/purple but the plaid is red. Weird combination. Also, the skirt is very stiff even after washing."
3.0,"Super comfy! But the pic makes it seem like it will be more flowy around the mid-section and it was not. Hugged more than I expected and I got my normal size, L, which was a little loose at the top."
3.0,"It runs small, the fabric quality is not very good. It’s soft and silky to the touch but do not stretch to much and the back of the fabric is white so when expanded you can see through and it doesn’t look good :( I am returning this item and won’t order again."
3.0,Beyond cute but it started turning brown. Cheap enough that you can wear it until then and not feel bad about buying another one.
3.0,Product runs VERY small - had to return
3.0,I like it but so hard when I put my card's it's hard to close I wish more soft then I will Love it...
3.0,These bands are pretty but a little too soft.  Keep coming loose after putting thru second holder flap
3.0,"These little beams light up nicely when they work, but they certainly don't all work all of the time. At lest in the bulk package that I got, the green ones specifically are of poor quality. The case seems too loose to adequately maintain pressure on the battery contacts. This can be fixed with some wiggling and superglue, but who wants to fix something that they just bought? The price is hard to resist, but factor in some wasteage if you don't want to spend some time fiddling with these things."
3.0,"Normally I wear size 11.5M US, but my right foot is a 12.  I ordered a 12.5 to be safe. However, the shoe is still a bit small on the right foot and left barely meets my approval. So consider a size up when ordering.  The toe box is not very forgiving, somewhat tight.  Arch support is nil (it's a flat-foot workout shoe). Otherwise, construction is excellent and a very good looking shoe.  I'd normally return a shoe with the above faults, but I really like the shoe so I put a shoe-stretcher to it and worked-out the toe box and length to where I now have an excellent fit.  Seldom if ever will you get a perfect fitting shoe via online shopping without a try-on, so always use Amazon Prime for return policy. I also recommend investing in a good shoe-stretcher if you want to keep a shoe that you really like and think you can easily modify it to fit.  I'd give this shoe a full 5 stars now, but only after I modified it."
3.0,"I usually wear a medium but read some of the reviews saying order a size up. Got the large and it’s still a bit small. Too lazy to send it back. Giving it to my daughter.<br />And, the picture is a bit miss leading. The back of the sweater is shorter than the front & sides. I don’t like that either. And I have a flat butt so it’s not my butt making it shorter. Lol!"
3.0,"Better than what I was replacing. Which was a thick substantial wool liner which had seen better days.<br />This one is thin, not substantial. But ok until I can find better ones.<br />Fit was good"
3.0,I thought that this would be practical for an overseas vacation but it is a little too tall and the opening not wide enough - and it not practical to carry what I intended to take without having to dig around it it. It is well-constructed and seemed like it would be secure and practical to carry on the shoulder or as a backpack. It has an odor to it.
3.0,Wife bought the Wallflower Luscious Curvy Bootcut at one of the major retail chains and loved them. The size 7 fit her perfectly so I bought her a pair for Christmas. Everything on the tags and in the description seemed to match but come Christmas morning the pair I bought was wayyy to small. From the looks she would have needed two sizes larger. Not sure why?
3.0,"While my son loved it, I knew it wouldn’t last forever but expected it to last a little longer then a week.<br />After I washed it for the first time, the sew on part on the front cane undone. I have a sewing machine and fixed it my self but I guess it was what I paid for sense the price is very reasonable."
3.0,material was ok but did not fit well around my hip area.
3.0,Uggggggh.......
3.0,"I do know if there was a flaw in the metal that allowed excess mouth moisture in or what happened, but the metal is tarnished now. I keep all my jewelry in a safe environment so I don't know what happened."
3.0,"Looks decent however I went in a costume  jewelry shop and saw the same item cheaper so I returned,"
3.0,"It was just too sloppy on me. Otherwise, it would have been a cute shirt"
3.0,light not as bright as picture
3.0,I like the keychain except the part with screw it came a loose on it's own and I cant use that part it's not safe for my keys
3.0,Cute but too big...it falls off her body & torsos really long on suit
3.0,very thin but otherwise great!
3.0,"I bought this to replace a much more expensive belt from Yeti.  It opens bottles easily (does look a little awkward considering where you are doing it).  Amazing how often I've used it, though maybe I have a little problem of sorts  : )  Mid-rating because the webbed belt itself began to fray on the edges after a month of use."
3.0,"Not the greatest quality, but for the price it’s not the worst! I would size up though."
3.0,Odd fit. Meh.
3.0,El zapato es pequeño
3.0,I have a couple Columbia jackets and large fits perfectly.  Large in this vest did not fit.<br />I had to reorder extra large.  Nice vest but not up to Columbia standards on quality.
3.0,Balance is not good. Feel like going to tip over.
3.0,Looks great but fell apart when I got. Used some glue and it's good to go.
3.0,"The bag itself is fine, but the handles are a little too short so it's awkward to carry it over your shoulder, and also the price is quite high for what your getting."
3.0,cute. Can see the nipples through it.
3.0,"Didn't fit for me, a 34A, too tight."
3.0,"The print on this dress is gorgeous I but top is made too small for my bust 36C. Dress did not wrap/close properly at chest area. Would def need to wear a cami or bralett under which I felt took away from the dress. Returned dress, customer service was prompt in issuing refund."
3.0,Definitely order 2 sizes bigger than normal!!
3.0,"I've worn this shirt a couple times since buying it. Overall I like it and am happy with purchasing it. It's lightweight and has a nice flowing movement to it. It's definitely not super clingy. Very comfortable to wear and looks great on. I would order a size up though just to be safe. There's one major con.... I've worn this probably 4 times since buying. I hand washed it too. There's a bunch of little elastic ends poking through on the lacy part. If there was just a small amount, no big deal, I would be OK with that. This though, has a bunch coming out. Enough that my baby noticed and tries to pick at them all. I will continue to wear this top, but I'm not sure how long it will last.<br />DISCLAIMER: I received this at a discounted price for my HONEST review."
3.0,"I returned these, not my favorite fabric."
3.0,These were good for earrings
3.0,Good for decoration or costume.
3.0,Fits my toddlers fat feet pretty well however not enough material for the Velcro and the bottom of the shoes are very slick and can slip very easily
3.0,Great product but it was supposed to be 2 in the pack and I only received 1!!
3.0,"Nice boots - it's just the top part looked like it would be bigger around the ankles in the picture. I wanted something that was loose on top - not so much straight leg. They're nice boots, just not exactly what I was looking for."
3.0,"Too big and doesn't fit right. I should have returned. Love the navy color and the material is slinky. I can't find good, thick shirts anywhere but I wasn't expecting this to be thick. I never wash this item so I can't say whether it shrinks but im guessing it doesn't. This shirt might fit someone with larger breasts. I'm a 36B and a small may have fit better."
3.0,Nice one but little pricey
3.0,"Could you please state the dimensions of this bag, and any other details that could clarify it's features? Thank you... t"
3.0,"Lower in the waist than I prefer and fit more like Capri's (5'11"", size L).  Shame because the style was very cute."
3.0,"This is very pretty, but it is huge even for the sizing.  I will need to return."
3.0,These fit much larger than expected
3.0,Cute skirt but way smaller than I thought it would be size up if your ordering this
3.0,it okay kinda cheap
3.0,comfortable enough but not structured enough for higher impact wear
3.0,"My husband usually wears a size 12 shoe.  We ordered the 11.5-12, and they fit ok, but aren’t perfect. They are a bit too narrow for my husband in the toe box. After wearing them for a few hours they seemed to stretch a little, and were more comfortable. In a house shoe/slipper I think most people would like a looser fit, so it might be worth it to err on the side of a larger size when ordering.<br /><br />The foam isn’t as thick as he was hoping for. It advertises memory foam, but it doesn’t feel particularly thick. The slipper is lightweight and the sole seems sturdy enough, and it does have nonslip features on the bottom.<br /><br />Generally, this is just an ok slipper. It didn’t amaze my husband, but they’re not terrible either."
3.0,Not as great a product as I thought. Lots of lines in it not a solid pattern.
3.0,I returned the earrings. They were too large for what I wanted them for. No other issues with them.
3.0,The silvery & gold tone anklets are really thin but the other are great !
3.0,It’s a little big I should have gonn down a size
3.0,The colors were drab....so disappointed.
3.0,If these pants were an elastic waist like the description said it would've been great.
3.0,The nike symbol peeled off after a couple uses. But it left a silver glue spot where it was and I think it looks better.
3.0,These are too baggy in the crotch area and have zero support and are somewhat sheer they are complimenting on the body but that is all and cute colors
3.0,"I love the way these earrings look, very cute. But the posts bend very easily. They weren't very expensive, so I'm not too torn up about it. I just make sure I'm careful when putting the backs on."
3.0,Reallllly pretty but not wide enough. I don’t have fat lobs and they pinch.
3.0,"My 7 year  old adores ghostbusters and imitates the movie and action.  So when sneaking in on a ghost and rolling the trap, it tipped over and one of the flaps broke off.  He was heartbroken.  I guess it is labeled a costume accessory to not be labeled a toy -- it isn't durable.  :("
3.0,"This is a nice, thinner top, not too good for cooler weather or winter. It is as the pic looks,  but definitely order up. I'm usually a large but like a looser fit of XL even though that's slightly too large. Because of the reviews I ordered XXL and it's still a bit snug. I have a slight momma tummy I like to cover and this top, even in the XXL doesn't do it well. Other than that it's a nice top for the money. I'm 5'3, 150 lbs for reference."
3.0,"Very beautiful! It is super sparkly and looks great. The only downside is the size. I ordered a size 6, but the ring that came is about 2 sizes too big. Disappointed, but I ordered some ring resizers because I do love this ring and want to keep wearing it."
3.0,"Probably the cutest pair of sunglasses I will ever own. Anyone who sees them complements them, and I work at a pool so… However they’re loose AF. I don’t have a tiny head or anything but they are constantly falling off my face and I bought them for work and I can’t work with them so they are just my fun glasses now, hence the 3 starts. Great color and would recommend to my larger headed friends"
3.0,"The pants are alright. They’re soft, but they are just straight-legged leggings with a thicker waist band and Velcro back pockets. But they aren’t really 28 inseam. I would say 29 in maybe 30."
3.0,"Nice sunglasses, just, unfortunately, a little too big for my face."
3.0,The shirt wasn’t fitted at the bottom like I expected. It flared out at the bottom and wasn’t very stretchy to hug your figure.
3.0,Runs somewhat  small.  Nice material.
3.0,"Super cute, and fit nicely, especially for price. But!! Threads were coming off the flowers and in the same day, my chain broke. I was luckily able to replace it, but it was a hassle. But then again, I got what I paid for. Last photo is the broken clasp."
3.0,These socks are super cute but not like the picture. They go to the knee but not over.
3.0,"Fit is bit loose, so stick to your normal size."
3.0,"They're a little on the tight side, can still fit into and wear. Just worry about them ripping depending on the situation."
3.0,They are a lot smaller than they look in the picture. There has been no attempt to show you the approximate size.
3.0,Buy a size down!
3.0,"It was okay, just not to my liking.  Shorter than I like."
3.0,"I was expecting the back to be just a tad longer but it's ok for price. The material is not thick at all as I was hoping but, it's fine to add to my collection of blazers."
3.0,Too short and there was a part stitched incorrectly
3.0,"It fit slightly looser then I liked. I ordered S and it is rather long on my thigh. It isn't high like on the model, but again I am short. It's a cute dress overall so I'll find sometime to wear it."
3.0,A little small but it works
3.0,"I loved these pants so much that I bought them 3 times.  I bought a back up pair, and then bought another one just in case.  Why the lower rating?  Because the last pair I received was different from the first two.  I'm a chubby 5'2"" who wears between a 12 and 14, and XL ankle had always been pleasantly stretchy and comfortable.  The navy was versatile enough for work and for casual wear.  The 3rd pair came super long and really tight and skinny!  That's not the fit I was accustomed to or wanted at all!  The fabric was also different, it felt smoother, but the fit was too long and too tight and they were no longer the ankle pants I loved.  They looked a lot less flattering on.  I'm now in search of new pants because I really don't like the updated fit and fabric."
3.0,"I like these and it is a great value  but they don't clamp down as tight as I'd like them to. I'm sure they aren't intended to hold blue jeans but that is what I use them for and although they will technically hold the jeans, with the smallest tug  they slide right out of the clamp like butter with almost zero resistance. I guess I should have looked for something sturdier for my jeans. Other than Jeans they work like a charm for leggings, scarves, etc.."
3.0,but the size is smaller than I thought
3.0,"Not very good quality, light material, and shrunk even washed in cold. Really runs small anyways. material is just too thin and bad quality"
3.0,"UPDATE: 2nd mask arrived separately but quite timely. Very satisfied with service.<br />I like the one mask I received, but paid for 2. Hope the company will rectify the shortage.<br />The tabs for adjusting fit on the stretch bands are better quality than most I have seen. The mask is as described although both layers of fabric are thinner than similar masks I have. There is the inner pouch for the activated carbon inserts."
3.0,"It looked nice and the quality was good, but when I wore it looked like a sack. Not for my built, I am petite and 5'3."
3.0,Great value for the money but they aren’t the best quality because they aren’t that sturdy. Definitely good for a one or two time use or for play time for a kid.
3.0,"Pretty cute, but this looks so cute and comfy in the picture.  Not bad, but not what I thought I would be. The white top is very soft, (wish the whole shirt was made out of this) but the darker grey is more like an athletic type shirt, made with some spandex type of material.  Fits ok, but thought it would be a more comfortable sweater type of material.  I’m normally between a medium and large, so I got a large. It fits, but just expected it to be softer and more loose.  Not sure if I’m going to keep it.  Seems to run a little on the small side, especially if you have any type of bust.  A size bigger would have been better, but would probably too long."
3.0,"wanted to love them but Not even a medium size earring, too small maybe the size of a quarter not what I was looking for and not worth the time and money to send back."
3.0,it good
3.0,"It is so pretty! I knew it was dainty, but I have had it less than a week and it broke. I was hoping since it had a metal core that it might be more durable.  Definitely not for everyday wear."
3.0,"Looked good and worked for 6 weeks before breaking.  At the end of 6 weeks, the plating had worn off about half of the chain also."
3.0,This mask is very cute and soft. But it is very large compared to other masks I have bought.
3.0,Watch out buying this item. I thought since I am only 5'0 that it would be long enough but the slip part doesn't even cover my butt. It fits like a breezy top. So if you are looking for a dress star clear of this product.
3.0,Very displeased with delivery!!!!!!!  The delivery person never knocks or rings the doorbell so I don't even know something is sitting on my front porch!!!!!
3.0,The mittens are very thin. Not warm at all. But that’s not the most aggravating thing about them. They squeeze my fingers at the my knuckles to the point of discomfort & occasionally cramps. The final reason I left a negative review is the type closure that was used to secure the mitten from the fingers. It is impossible to get that timely button through such a thin. Loop make with basically thread. I would suggest this be re-thought as a design change.  An elastic loop or replacing it all with Velcro would work so much better. They really are cute and so soft. Perfect for a warmer day or no wind.
3.0,"I loved this suit! The orange color was great, the top was high cut but still cute. The BIG problem is that the butt coverage is super little. Like almost none!"
3.0,all are broken within a month
3.0,"Loved these, but the stones kept falling out and I had to glue them back in.  On my wedding day..."
3.0,Two of them broke same day I attempted to use them at the rubber loop.
3.0,"The shirt is nice (fabric & color). But there is a ripple near the back zipper as other reviews have mentioned. It also falls oddly on one side. It may be to allow room for a tennis ball as it is intended to be used for the sport, which is great, but I don't play, thus the 3-star review."
3.0,Pretty design. It’s is soft and silky smooth but for me ( I do have a smaller head size) it slips off during the night.
3.0,Well made bra  cup for well but needs more side support
3.0,Not exactly the shade I expected.  Frames fit loose on my face.
3.0,I love the quality but the size is way off.
3.0,Nice for a young child. Very small otherwise all goid
3.0,"It's a nice shirt, but it's HUGE! Seriously, it's more of a dress than a top. Also, the color was more gray than black. I like it well enough, but I'm disappointed that it's not what I ordered."
3.0,I've had this top for several months and still haven't worn it. It just looks to big!
3.0,"The purse is made very well with quality material, but it is considerably smaller than I expected."
3.0,Good idea and pretty well made.  The problem is that it is hard to locate the hole to put a straw in when you are wearing the mask.
3.0,"Beautiful setting, but the stone was set  lopsidded and the edge catches. I feel like I am going to loose the stone."
3.0,"The quality of the material is great…but the sizing is way off. I got the s/m for the 40mm Apple Watch and when I put it on, it literally spun on my wrist. Since there isn't a smaller size option, this was returned. Customer service was great."
3.0,loved the style... a little too short to wear as anything other than a bathing suit coverup.
3.0,"These pretty little sterling spacers are what I wanted to space and hold my Pandora charms in place. However, they are difficult to get the black rubber stoppers to stay in. I have yet to get them to stay in the beads. I'm sure I will be able to get them to work, eventually, but thought other buyers should be aware that the rubber is not in the beads and has to put inside by the purchaser. The quality is good. The price is very reasonable, but the ease of use is a bit of a problem."
3.0,So big.... fits like a dress
3.0,"These seem awfully small. One of my grandkids can probably use it, but the other two will not be comfortable having to really stretch them to the extreme to get them over their heads. Not the best design or size and not worth returning. Maybe we can repurpose them for some other use."
3.0,"This type of dress does take some getting used to. I find it to be heavy, but a good thick, stretchy fabric. You can get really creative with this type of dress beyond the usual suggestive styles. I did not order the tube top bands because I have my own. I gave it three stars because the convertible straps are super long and heavy. Overall it was an okay purchase as an experiment."
3.0,Needed athletic short. These work but the quality is not in this mesh material. I kept them but wont buy any more.
3.0,Stones are too dark.
3.0,Great fit and super comfortable.  The plastic bottom is super slippery on tile floors.
3.0,"Out of 40, 27 were good,  6 were shaky with loose connections and switches,  6 were bad (including the 3 that were on and dying in the box when it arrived).  The ones that were good were very bright.  Some switches were much easier to operate than others."
3.0,Cute but too small and I returned it
3.0,"Nice small pieces, but, the pictures fail to show the details and there are flowers on the skulls."
3.0,"I bought the 3XL because I'm a bigger girl, and the size chart said it would fit. Surprise, it didn't. Next time, I'm just going to give in and buy the more expensive version from a different website, because then if it doesn't fit, I can send it back. (I didn't get to send this one back, because by the time I received it, the time limit for returning it had expired.)"
3.0,"Average marksmanship, good for a person that is rough on things."
3.0,"I doubt these socks are that much cotton.  I can only wear them on occasion, because they are just way too hot, but they are convenient for quick trips with flip flops indoors, or outdoors depending."
3.0,"I obviously got the wrong earrings bc they are small for a child. I read reviews where people said the earrings were big and for adults not kids. The earrings are cute but I wanted a bigger size which is why I bought these. I want to keep them and give them to my 7 yr old daughter, but how can I order these again and get the right size??"
3.0,"I had high hopes for this top, however an XL seemed to fit like a medium so I had to return."
3.0,Don't expect them to stay black long. Otherwise they work as advertised.
3.0,Cheap material and the inside is white doesn’t match other material. I returned it.
3.0,"Just tried this dress on.  I really do love it!!!  I'm 5'8 120 lbs.  I bought a medium.  It's big but with the belt it would be totally fine! The problem is that it's way too short.  It goes to my ankles, I was hoping for longer.  I will be returning it :/"
3.0,It's okay for the beach. Very lightweight and dries easily.
3.0,"Loved the bracelet, itself! I wear a 8 inch size in a bracelet; however, I had to take it to my jeweler to be extended in length by 1 1/2 inches...with toggle pendant I had to pay extra to thread long catch of the bracelet through the end."
3.0,"it feels binding in the shoulders, I gave it away"
3.0,You'll have to wear a camisole with this. The pink isn't as bright as shown.
3.0,"Said it would fit kids, but it is way too big."
3.0,Thin fabric and not as soft as I thought it would be but overall cute work blazer.
3.0,Very cute but a little crooked. They were too big for me so I don’t know if adjustments would have helped the crooked fit.
3.0,Will have to return and did not seem to be wide as advertised.
3.0,"Just what my wife was looking for, unfortunately, 1st item recieved, the clip holder was split at top. Ordered 2nd one, same problem.<br />Still works, but....."
3.0,I was not happy with the quality of this costume jewelry.  It looks very fake and the color is brighter than depicted.  It is more fusia than soft pink.
3.0,smaller than what i expected its a tight fit lol damn
3.0,"There is nothing actually wrong with these glasses to necessarily warrant a three-star rating, however, they ARE really big! I gave three stars because I didn't feel the description made it clear how big they are."
3.0,B RATING
3.0,"I love the design but problem is the bracelet is not functional if you have a dog or pet that may eat the essential oil pad. Unfortunately the flip close clasp kept flipping open and my oil pad fell out, I was worried my dog may have ate it but thankfully she didn't. However I realized this isnt the bracelet for me"
3.0,"I really like the sweater,  but it's smaller than expected.  I usually wear an XL in most stores.  I ordered a XXXL and it was still snug."
3.0,"Cheap plastic, one lens cracked out of the packs I bought. Not good for more than one or two uses. Still a hit with my guests though and individually wrapped to prevent scratches."
3.0,doesn't fully look like photo but is pretty cute.  Fabric is different than appears in photo
3.0,functional but not a slim as they make it sound
3.0,These glasses are HUGE and looked ridiculous on my face. The bridge was too narrow to comfortably fit my nose and made them fall high on my face. They did not fit or look good so I had to return. Pay attention to the dimensions for sure!
3.0,Good. The gloves were a little big and the thigh highs were  slightly loose but fit well. I'm 5'4 120lbs and ordered a small.
3.0,Super cute jacket. I normally wear a size small but ordered an medium and it fits nice.<br /><br />The negative is that the inside lining is more than halfway detached on the sleeve when I got it. Nothing that I can’t fix myself but I shouldn’t have to fix something that just got taken out of the package.
3.0,"The top fits fine, the bottom does not and it ripped right away. I was able to fix but it’s definitely poorly made."
3.0,I was so excited for these. They are so cute but after a week of having them the spinning charm fell off. So upsetting
3.0,It's a nice scarf. I have lots of thick hair so it doesn't work for me unless its braided and confined. Its perfect for my daughters who hair is not as full as mine.
3.0,I like the feel and comfort of these pants but specifically bought them for cold weather. They are thinner than expected and do not provide the warmth I was hoping for.
3.0,Still confused about this
3.0,"Thin, inexpensive and not particularly attractive in my opinion.<br />Come with a white plastic case.  Nothing special.  Just keeps them from getting scratched up.<br />In my opinion these glasses are just too big for most faces too.<br />Don't expect much for what you are paying anyway.<br />These are more cute than they are functional."
3.0,Although pretty material all these measurements are for Asian bodies.  If you try to return they will only give you 40% back.  When you complain you want a full refund you get a confirmation of the full amount but when it comes through it is the 40 percent. Frustrating
3.0,The smiley face fell off a few days after wearing it. I'm going to need to glue it back on
3.0,"Difficult to rate, the body of the shirt was a perfect fit. However, the sleeves were to long. Came all the way down to the elbow."
3.0,"My daughter bought this for her mom’s birthday. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality, and it hasn’t yet turned her skin green. For costume jewelry, that’s always a bonus. Most of all, the thought behind it was too sweet and her mother loved it."
3.0,"It`s so, so."
3.0,This dress is cute in the photo but it doesn't fit me right.  However it's very well-made and cute.  A little too long though. I'm 5'6&#34; and it's way below my knees. Sent it back due to the fit on my body.
3.0,"The calf was too tight, I couldn't zip them up all the way, I'm a 7.5 so I ordered an 8. They were too big in the foot and too tight in the leg. They looked nice though"
3.0,I'm not impressed with this blouse. It has a soft silk feel. This shirt did not have care instructions on it. The strings on the blouse are as longs as the blouse is. It's see through and thin.
3.0,"I like the Jean, I just have to find a seamstress that doesn't charge a lot to hem a couple inches."
3.0,pretty but just didn't have the high end look I was I was seeking.
3.0,"My son has chubby feet, so after trying to get them on him for 10 min they only went half way on. There was no way the shoes were going to fit his wide foot. I would recommend going up on a size if you want your child to wear socks with the shoes as well! My son wears a 5/6 so that’s what I ordered but even if his foot wasn’t wide, I don’t think socks would have fit with the shoe. Overall the product is pretty much as expected."
3.0,"I purchased this wallet as a front pocket wallet, expecting a small bill sized wallet. I received a wallet that was longer and taller then my previous wallet. It was thinner then my wallet but in my opinion this is not a front pocket wallet. Unless your 350 pounds."
3.0,I already said what I disliked.  The colors are beautiful.
3.0,"I had received my package with only 11 rings in it and a huge hole in the side. Never got the cute elephant ring, which was the main reason I purchased this."
3.0,These sandals are super cute. I am normally a size 9 and that’s what I ordered…..but they were WAY too big. Definitely go down a size! Unfortunately had to return them.
3.0,Be prepared to wear something under it.  It really is pretty darn see through.  I've kept it to use as a bathing suite cover up.
3.0,This shirt is great for the days that you really just don't care about how you look whatsoever.
3.0,It's honestly really good for the price it's comfortable and silky my favorite part is the kimono (the earrings are fragile (the metal part) so be careful not to bend it or it'll snap and belt you have to be careful with otherwise it'll rip the edges when you put it on/take it off)
3.0,Super cute but didn't fit was very tight and hot glue strands were hanging off everywhere took a few minutes but I fixed it and it looked fine just small.
3.0,"Don't care for the plastic, rubbery look or feel.  Fitness trackers shouldn't have to look either gaudy or like a giant rubber band."
3.0,The words erased away within two weeks of wearing
3.0,Didn't like back of hat once fit all strap adjusted.
3.0,"This jacket is a mixed bag: the general seams and structure are good, the front zipper is quality, but it disappoints wrt the hood, which is shallow and lacks structure, so is liable to be blown off in a light breeze. The draw-string for the hood is also suspect, it serms flimsy and I don’t expect it to be durable. So if you are looking for a useful hood, I would suggest you look elsewhere."
3.0,"Very weak, feels cheap, not sturdy"
3.0,Not a shiny as pictured
3.0,"Shipped quickly, but it was smaller than I expected."
3.0,"Rather large sunglasses. Although there was nothing wrong with them, they are better suited for women."
3.0,"I thought the strap length was too short.  Also, bag was small as well."
3.0,"These are for my husband who will turn 80 next month.  He has difficulty touching his toes due to back pain.  I assisted him putting on the socks.  They are not easy on.  It is exactly like putting anti-embolic hose on patients in hospital.  He wore them all day and loved them.  Same type hose available at drug stores and WalMart or Target, etc.  for less money."
3.0,"I was disappointed to find that, despite the high price tag, the clips are made of plastic. I need a good rescue tube at our lake house, and our old one lasted for many years. I loved the secure, durable, strong metal clip. The body wore out, but that clip was still great. I don't feel nearly as optimistic about what feels to me to be a cheap part and a step down in quality."
3.0,The pedant is too large for the chain.
3.0,Strap on back of shoe to help slid onto baby’s foot ripped off on first time wearing
3.0,Cute but not good material
3.0,Not a fan of how it looks on my watch. The stock band comes up even with the watch and makes a seamless looking piece going to your wrist.  This one there is a big gap
3.0,"This band is adorable, comfortable, easy to install...but the band cracked after three months of wear. It’s not real leather and it’s very stiff. The continual bending of the strap to fit the end through the safety loop cracked the material. Sadly, I won’t be buying another."
3.0,They have small frames and I was looking for something with bigger frames. They stole one of the pictures from shevoke. The Misha Rose Golds. So that's supper annoying cause those are about $100 glasses and these are a different color and very delicate. But you get what you pay for so I'm not too upset about it.
3.0,"This is cute, the fabric is not shiny like in the images, its just like a plain old cotton and very thin. The top never really stays in place but I look super cute in this for just around the house."
3.0,"I liked this bra, it was well-made, but they sent me a size too small."
3.0,"I will be able to wear this but it is small. The length hits me just below the knees. I am 5'4""."
3.0,It fits a little small but it's super cute.
3.0,"It was ok, I  guess.  But way to big."
3.0,Everything is great with the exception of the length. It's too short!
3.0,Plastic pieces don't luck the gem into place at all. So kinda useless. ..
3.0,"The robe looks really good, but it doesn't absorb water as much as my previous robe did. The fabric is not the same as a towel fabric and hence the absorbency is lacking."
3.0,The color is nice but the strap is not adjustable.
3.0,I'm 5'7 and this dress is too short for me.
3.0,The Polish dulled but it was definitely worth the little I paid for it
3.0,Fit as expected but definitely not cute material. Super shiny and not flattering.
3.0,For half the price I'd give 5 stars. Not quality materials or craftsmanship. But they are cute.
3.0,Not as oversized as it looks. Short in the waist I expected it to be a little longer in the length and sleeve.<br />But pretty color and looks okay.
3.0,"Its Great but the creator keeps making a mistake, the picture on the inside of the keychain is wrong and no matter the # of reorders, it still does not fix, I want a universe gate not an sg1 gate, but otherwise now I got a gajillion of em and I have something to give for Christmas!"
3.0,"Bought it for outside curtains for the gazebo. They are ok in a very slight breeze, but they dont save the situation if there is a little more windy.For the inside they will be perfect."
3.0,"This came up as wide calf but it definitely is not. Can’t zip them up.<br />Gifted them to a friend with skinny legs,"
3.0,These were a bit thin so I will not recommend them to anyone for purchase.
3.0,"Ordered a Large and the Amazon packaging said it was a Large. But the actual seller packaging and tags said it was a Medium. So I returned it and reordered it, but again got a Medium. Double check the size when you get it. I don't think I'll be ordering this a third time. It's a shame though, the color is great and the material is really soft."
3.0,They do help adjust your ring size but they’re kind of a hassle but it’s better than those plastic ones that you twist onto your rings which are very bulky. They are comfortable but They are hard to get a good tight fit when installing them on your ring. I would suggest him especially over the plastic ones you twist and spending the money to go to the jewelers and having them re-size
3.0,"I purchased the Navy size Large. Approximate measurements laying flat: chest underarm to underarm 19"", length shoulder to hem 24', across hem 19"". Fabric is similar to thick t-shirt/jersey material, not sheer, poly cotton with stretch. Metal snaps are a little heavy but close securely. Length was slightly shorter than expected, not quite as long as shown in the picture. Construction was average with some loose threads and the size label was sewn in upside down, no brand label at all. Although this runs fairly true to size but on me it was more of a relaxed fit and not the slim fit I was hoping for. I'll be returning and unfortunately they don't have it in medium or I would reorder. I paid about $7 with free Prime shipping so it was pretty good for the price and would make a good casual cardigan."
3.0,I ordered 4 of these and they're very pretty. It comes in a small black velvet box and unfortunately two out of four of the velvet boxes were cut up! Now I need to go find another little jewelry box to put them in as they are Christmas gifts! 😕
3.0,The fit was fine but my daughter complained it was too itchy for her to wear so she doesn’t. It’s a shame cause she loves it and it is very cute
3.0,"It served the purpose it was bought for, but not a real favorite. Very light weight."
3.0,"This is for a women’s short sleeve casual plus size T-shirt dress. I got this to wear with leggings and boots. I had thought the black strips on the side would make it flattering but on me it did not. It did fit loose which I took another reviews advise and ordered up a size but I think it might have been more flattering if I had went with my typical size. So, for me, I think the sizing seemed accurate and I would not recommend ordering at the size."
3.0,Nice shoes...but a little short....wish they came in half sizes....
3.0,Bottoms have no support for the buttocks.
3.0,They are very small for a thumb but works once I cut them
3.0,A little bigger than expected. The padding kept coming out when he would take off his shoe but it sides right back in.
3.0,"I've owned three pairs because they all break in the same place... where the hinge meets the frame.  The wood splits, even with normal wear, nothing crazy."
3.0,Expected ghost Buster’s box but it came in a regular Amazon box. Took some joyaway from this gift.
3.0,nice and easy to wear
3.0,So cute but I sized up because I have a tall toddler and the waist is large so it droops. The straps were also very long but thankfully they have two button holes to make them shorter or longer and criss-crossing them<br />In the back helped a lot.
3.0,"It's okay, I guess.  Product fits smaller than you would think.  I'm a size 8, 5'6&#34; and it was shorter than I thought it should be and not very flattering."
3.0,"I've ordered two of these rings, one size 13 and one size 14.  Coincidentally, both of the rings I received are the exact same size."
3.0,I chose my regular size in tops which is small because Im not top heavy and this could have fit my 7 year old niece. On the flip side the material and print was very cute just beware of sizes.
3.0,"I ordered a medium (which is my usual size) but it was very roomy, felt like a large size.  For the price it was a good buy though, I’m thinking of trying the small size."
3.0,"First of all, belt is nice, but I can’t confirm product longevity as I must return. RUNS SMALL. Product description says large fits 34-36. Actual belt length is 34” (+ 1.5” buckle) with the largest holes at 30” so it would only fit a maximum of a 30” waist. I will return for x-large."
3.0,"Leather slight scratch the surface a little, but in the acceptable range"
3.0,I guess i should learn my sizing for earings cause these were small. But i winded up giving it to my gf and she wears them all the time.
3.0,"Although these are great, they are 1 size too small.  I'm a solid medium and they fit like a small (5'8&#34;, 130lbs) so I'm returning for a large."
3.0,I liked this watch band until it started to fall apart 6 days after my 30 day return policy thru AMAZON had expired.  Now I’m stuck with a broken band that I have to glue myself to keep using.  No happy at all.
3.0,Very cute but the material is thin you can see through it!
3.0,"I bought these for my son in April. They seemed great, but it is only June and I noticed there is a big crack in the bottom of both sandals. Seems they should last longer for the price."
3.0,The jewelry is nice but the gauge on them are huge. If your trying to use this as a starter piercings then it would work
3.0,The outside of this fleece sweatshirt was soft and warm. Inside though there was a liner that i just didnt like. It was softer then the underside of the fleece but it wasnt for me. The liner was not sewn to the sweatshirt so that was kind of a pain as well.  Also it ran a touch small. I am 5'5 130 and the M just fit. Im sad to return it. I really loved it from the outside!!
3.0,It’s OK but it’s too small one
3.0,"Super cute, a bit on the heavy side which might be an issue the longer you were them.  I did not return based on that although I contemplated.  The fabric fan is thicker than I thought it'd be but is very cute.  I ordered black and beige and will keep them both."
3.0,"Great swimsuit for the price. Good fit, a little snug but any bigger would be bad. I’d recommend it."
3.0,Nicely made but way too small. Had to return.
3.0,Nothing fancy.  I’m sure I’ll make it work.
3.0,"I got the WF striped pants in large. There's a lot to like about these pants; the material is comfortable and light, the ability to choose your inseam is GREAT, they look very nice, and the pockets are real.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these fit very close to the skin. I'm usually a small/medium in pants, size 4, and I ordered the medium originally thinking I wanted to be sure the pants weren't too tight. The medium was skin tight, not appropriate for work at all. I liked them so much, though, I sent them back for a large. Even the large is skating the edge of too clingy/skin tight on my butt/thighs (while the waist is too big). They're really nice pants, though, so I kept them and wore them with a long cardigan. Throughout the day they have loosened up a little as I wore them, but even still, I will have to always wear something tunic-length to cover my butt/upper thighs.<br /><br />In the end, I like the pants enough to keep them and just make sure the top is long enough; but the sizing is not forgiving."
3.0,"Clip-on sunglasses are a lot like shoes--it's hard to find the right one without trying them on first.<br />In this case, I spent a good deal of time measuring and calculating, and ended up with sunglasses that didn't provide full coverage over my regular glasses, though not the fault of this particular brand.<br /><br />With respect to this brand, the clip mechanism is too tight, and it was near impossible to open the clip and get it to fit on the glasses without slipping and sliding off. In the end it was too difficult to use these clip-ons, and I wore a type of 'fit over' sunglasses for the fierce sun of the Arizona desert."
3.0,There are not true to size.  The ones I got were just huge.  The first time the tops of my shoes got wet.  The second time our friends said to put stirrup outside shoe and then nothing got wet.  Even though the stirrup say put in shoe.
3.0,Great fit however after I wore them about three time one of the socks had a hole in the heel
3.0,"I was disappointed at the size.  I ordered boys size 7 for my grandson.  It was too short!  Therefore, I am concerned that I will need to order new shirts in the near future."
3.0,"It's kinda big & chunky, and could be misconstrued as &#34;gawdy&#34;, but I still like it.  Will definitely purchase again from amazon.com."
3.0,A little small but not too bad. Just not what I was looking for...too much padding for my taste. Otherwise was cute.
3.0,shrinks - buy next size up from what they tell you to buy - just go bigger
3.0,"These shirts are very fitted. They’ll be perfect for layering in cooler weather, but they’re a bit too snug to wear alone."
3.0,"I wear a 2x, order 3x for loose comfort. These fit like a xlarge, and I won’t wear them.<br />They are nicely made, but can’t seem to order anything but known name brands<br />on Amazon to be sure of sizing."
3.0,Runs small but very pretty and flowy. I simply wear a tank underneath so as not to reveal too much cleavage.
3.0,"I would have gave this a better review if i didn't have the constant issue of the top ball falling off, not even the whole thing, but just the plastic ball itself. I had to super glue it back to the ring several times and i had it for a few months before it got lost completely,i actually bought another one, the same one and it ended up getting crunched when i was sleeping and the ball was crumbled into a bunch of pieces on my pillow. It was my favorite looking ring, but the constant annoyance of it falling apart ruined it for me."
3.0,bad gap at the armpits and very tight fitting in the middle.
3.0,I thought it was cotton but it's like a nylon size runs small
3.0,The sleeves are too short when rolled down
3.0,"I had high hopes for this suit. I'm a 36 B, 137 lbs and 5'6"" . The top was too small (specifically too tight around under the cups. The cups were fine but the sides cut in under my arms ) and the bottoms were big. Such a weird fit. I ordered the medium.  If you are a 32 or 34 bra size and have a bigger bottom,  this would probably work for you."
3.0,This one runs a little small
3.0,"taking a long time to break in, even after starting with an hour the first day, adding an hour each day; but they are still comfortable, just not all day shoes"
3.0,"I like the sweater but it's a little small, I was disappointed."
3.0,"This dress looks just like Mirabel in the movie.  However, it's very cheaply made, and barely holds its shape (dress or purse). But at least it came with the purse.<br /><br />We'll see how long it lasts, but we have low expectations..."
3.0,They r fine
3.0,"Not what I expected...but still decent. My 6 year old loves it, even if it is too big"
3.0,The head covering is kind of large and it feels very warm. My only complaint is that it has a terrible odor to it.
3.0,Great quality but very very small
3.0,My daughter loved this set. The water bottle is plain and has no shopkins decals. bummer
3.0,"I like them but when I wipe them clean I feel the plastic lenses bend. They don’t scratch super easy. They are good driving glasses, good polarized lenses"
3.0,The ears and bow are nice. Headband is flimsy.
3.0,string is irrating on the ears after a while
3.0,"They’re very stiff, small and uncomfortable to wear."
3.0,Shirt was alittle bit we ordered our normal size and the shirt was much larger.
3.0,"They were a little loose for me, but since I'm expecting I may be able to fit in them after all. Perfect for office wear"
3.0,The earring backs did not fit the earrings I had at all.
3.0,Way too small. Fit more like a size 1 than a large.
3.0,They are nice don’t get me wrong but for whatever reason they all tore in the same exact spot. Right along the seam. So they last maybe a week each one.
3.0,"This material is a polyester, not cotton."
3.0,"It was pretty, I had bought it for my girlfriend and she really liked it. The star stone wasn't like the picture but she hadn't seen it so no unmet expectations there."
3.0,Nice skirt. Quality is nice.  Wasn't flattering on me.
3.0,"I like the feel, thickness and  padding on this glove.  Overall it would've been great but since it has no wrist strap/ opening it's VERY tight. I could barely get the glove on but once on its great.  Problem is I don't know if I could get it on/off sweaty hands."
3.0,sleeves way too short for a Large size
3.0,The print on the ears is backwards. So when you look in a mirror it is correct for you but to everyone else it is wrong. Still cute and worth the money if you are on a pinch.
3.0,"These are cute. Don’t get me wrong. Just not really great quality. The “metal” isn’t real metal, but painted plastic."
3.0,I like the style of the mask but it’s now breathable and it gets very hot especially on those hot days you can’t breathe
3.0,Could be longer super soft and warm.
3.0,Silk is so soft but does not give very well.  If you sleep straight as a board these are perfect for you.
3.0,Good looking but the quality is poor. Would rate better if the lenses didn't scratch easily while folded up. Frame is lightweight and gets bent easy but did not break when straightened. 3 stars for good frame but poor finish on lenses.
3.0,"Cute. Finger length cuts were all different, but not a problem. Scalloped trim stands up when laced. Working on a solution...."
3.0,"My initial thought when purchasing these were for everyday glove-use. These gloves are cute and fit nice but if I am being honest... It doesn't do the job for me. When you put soap on your hands, it is VERY slippery making it really easy to break glass / dishes when washing. The only thing I would say this is good for would be for pots and pans. If you are looking to wash those without hassle this is it. For everything else, I wouldn't recommend!"
3.0,definitely large in the belly area.
3.0,"It worked! I also received a lot of compliments at holiday party, but I ordered a size medium and received a size small, the day before party :( I enlisted my husband and mother's help to zip the back :'( hahaha. I'm 5'5"" 167 lbs"
3.0,Bawhahaha giant underwear! Glad I purchased just one.
3.0,Very well made but there’s a place that the leather gathered near the ankle bone and it kinda digs into my leg causing discomfort
3.0,"Pants short like capri pants and jacket more like half jacket, material made my butt look flat."
3.0,"I bought these for the white framed, blue lensed glasses, but rather found that the black framed, polarized lensed glasses were better for driving. Quickly though I found that those lens has permanent smudge or bubble on the left side.  It does make them quite annoying to wear"
3.0,I can not for the life of me get these tiny screws into my piercing. Good quality but so frustrating!!
3.0,I go this for my son. The face is flat easy to scratch. The pros is cost was cheap. The plastic is water proof. Cons is it has only one alarm which he constantly reminds me to get him another watch. He does not like feel and style of this one. If you need very simple no hassel watch then this would be great for you. If you need something more function you need to get something else. The face of this watch is small even woman could wear this.
3.0,"This product is great, however it does not work for someone who sits for a living. I do data entry and sit for 6-8 hours a day. There is not enough coverage up the back side which is where most accidents happen for someone in my position. I read reviews here and on the Thinx website about it yet still wanted to try them. I did wear them on my heaviest day and still put pad up the back side to insure I did not have an accident at work....thank goodness I did, as it did go up the back side. Please, make these with more coverage on the backside for people who are like me who sit for a living!"
3.0,It was supposed to be dark orange and it’s hunter orange! Sending it back!<br />It’s thick and nice looking but horrid color description!
3.0,Do not buy this if you are a diabetic as they cut off circulation at the ankle.
3.0,Looks awesome and fits well! It is rather thin material tho so it doesn't appear to be quite warm so I'd say it's more of a novelty item...but still a very cool shirt!
3.0,Serves it's purpose but is kind of boxy and isn't as long as I expected it to be.
3.0,"The only dislike for me is the fact that the helmet is not rain proof. There is a gap between the helmet and shield that allows the rain to slide down helmet and down into the face shield. Comfort was great and value was great as well, but I do have to buy another helmet, this would cause me to have to retreat with my cycle until rain has passed."
3.0,"As others have mentioned, this dress STINKS straight out of the package. I sized up but while the chest fit, the waist much too big. It is also longer than I’d prefer (I’m 5’4” and it falls just below my calf). If the odor airs out in a couple days, I’ll keep it and have the waist taken in. If not, I’ll return it."
3.0,I really wanted a white sweater to take on vacation for those cool evenings.<br />I was very disappointed when this arrived and it was not white but more of a<br />cream/eggshell/vanilla/beige/OFF WHITE<br />NOT WHITE color
3.0,"It was exactly what I wanted,  however on day 1 of wearing it, one end of the necklace pulled out of the metal tip.  I super glued it back and it is still usable, probably better.  Check this before you wear it, especially for a valuable pendant you may put on it."
3.0,"Bought for my little sister on her birthday, she loved it a lot. But, the crystals started detaching after a week of wear. For that price, I think it is as expected."
3.0,"Short, will wear as a top."
3.0,"I bought this shirt for my son who is slender and has an athletic build. On average,  when I get him clothing, he wears a medium. I ordered this shirt in medium and it looked fine on him to me but he said it was a tight fit. He really likes the shirt but would have liked it to be slightly bigger."
3.0,"This dress came on time. I ordered a large. I am 5’ almost 1”, 125 lbs and wear a size 3 with a 34 D bust.<br /><br />Although the dress fits well, I feel it isn’t what I expected. It looks like a slip dress in the photo. It looks like a dark black color made of thin fabric, at least to me. This is a black jean looK fabric that feels like a heavier cotton blend of sorts. It has a bit of stretch to it as well.<br /><br />It does fit nicely for a casual just hanging out day and I’m sure you could probably dress it up a bit if needed. I wore it with sandals and a light sweater to do errands.<br /><br />I would order it again but would be skeptical of the color being accurate. Beware there is a rather significant difference in my opinion. I hope this was helpful. ✌🏼❤️😃🙏🏼"
3.0,"It was cute, it was for use at the time for a Halloween costume, but it arrived late and it was a bit snug in the chest area. I suggest ordering a size up"
3.0,"This isn't camel, it's mustard yellow. Thankfully I like the color, but the picture is not accurate. I ordered this in olive as well and even though they're the same size this one is a good amount larger than the other one."
3.0,Great design.......soft but not quality  shirt.
3.0,I only have one complaint about this belt and it’s the most important thing for me when choosing one. This belt is durable but extremely hard.
3.0,"Super cute, my son loves it but the lights dont work, and there is no where to take the piece out to replace the batteries or charge the lights."
3.0,"Cute dress, but had a weird gap near the button closure in the back. I ordered the small and would say it's true to size, but the fit is a little strange because of the gap in the back. Sleeves are super cute, though, and otherwise it fits as you would expect a shift dress to fit."
3.0,"This shirt is okay. I will wear it. However, it's a little small. It isn't a long shirt as pictured. Also, it is made of  spandex-like material."
3.0,"Got this in medium to fit 36DD bust. It kinda works, but the cups aren't quite the right size and the placement is off. The cup/strap needs to be more to the side to keep from spilling sideways. Also tried in a small but that just squished the girls.<br /><br />Tip on smoothing the cup/strap - the right one (your right) goes over the left one, then you can put the band around the neck without bunching it.<br /><br />Hopefully you found my review to be helpful - even if you decide not to try the top."
3.0,"I ordered this shirt for myself and followed the size guidelines pictured on the website. The shirt arrived and looked great, but I could not get it on. It was too small. Fortunately, I have a slim-sized son who absolutely loved the shirt. I thought it would be a challenge for me to send it back for a replacement, the size chart apparently is not meant for USA men and so this became a gift for my son -which is why the score appears to be all over the place. He definitely enjoys the shirt."
3.0,I ordered 40 which is a 9 but they run small.  😥
3.0,"I bought these hoping they'd last all summer when we went to the waterpark. I guess they technically did, but the material was very badly picked by the end of the season. They are super cute and did the trick."
3.0,Not bad for the price I paid.
3.0,It came quick but it was smaller than I thought.
3.0,"Thin material but held up in ocean , removable bra pads , super cute for matching. But even size 2xl was not long enough, am 5’8 / long torso andhad to wear additional bottoms to make swimsuit mom/family friendly , suit is very high cut at hip bones ."
3.0,"Not really sure how to describe my issues with this. It's pretty comfortable (would need the help of a friend using the bathroom!) but the fit is off for someone tall and skinny. I am 5'9&#34;, 125ish, and the large was snug enough without pulling but also gave me the slightest camel toe. I could've dealt with that, but I can tell the waist and is supposed to be somewhat billowy. Being pulled so tight, it just stretched the midsection out and made me look really boxy, and the belt location would've been way too high above my natural waist to look good.<br /><br />Length wasn't an issue because it tapers, but if it had been a wide leg it definitely would've been way too short.<br /><br />For $15, I really wanted to keep it, but I can't imagine feeling comfortable enough in this to wear in public."
3.0,"All the accessories arrived on time for a great party.<br />All but the gloves, were perfect! These were a bit too small for Santa!"
3.0,"I liked the socks, however it looks as if they’re screen printed and stretch significantly when you put them on.  So, that stretching makes the design a little awkward, but overall still a solid purchase."
3.0,I'm sure it will obviously depend on how big you are but as a normal wearer of M tees this was rather larger than normal.
3.0,my size is a large but i like stuff loose so i buy extra large... i this case i wanted something over sized do i ordered it in a 2x.... it fits me like a medium
3.0,Loved the size of this bag but the handles can't endure everyday usage
3.0,It's not an XL fit
3.0,"These Earrings seemed to be fine when they arrived but the post would not stay inside the slide so I had to do a little craft work and convert them, They're very cute and Lightweight, but I shouldn't have to fix a new pair of earrings, no regardless of the price."
3.0,They were gorgeous and looked like the ones shown but were considerably small then stated
3.0,Very loose fitting and they lost elasticity quickly.
3.0,cute dress but very boxy. I am 5'1 and 120 pounds and it made me look huge.
3.0,"Pretty but they move on the ear and are not well balanced. To keep them in the right position, you have to adjust them all of the time while wearing."
3.0,"Too small, sent back, waiting on refund"
3.0,"I am a Coolibar zip off visor fan.  I go through them every 2 years (wearing every weekday sweating Florida sun.  I needed another and Coolibar didn't have them in stock so I bought this.  I know it's not as good or durable, but it is a similar style with a wide brim.<br />It did the job competently.  Lightweight (lighter than my usual hat), did allow a little bit of light through the brim but that was expected.<br />After about 3 months though, the plastic wires that give the bill its shape started coming out of the side near the sweatband.  I had to stuff one back into the bill and under the sweatband.  Oh yeah, the band is not wicking either--some may see that as a deal breaker.  The sweat usually travels up the hat anyways in most cases.<br />I had to take care in putting this hat on so I don't poke/scratch myself with that plastic wire until I was able to get my Coolibar hat no much longer after that.  It did the job, can't be hard with the hat it won't last."
3.0,This product fits perfectly but if you are expecting to purchase this during the summer I would advise not to. The material is super thick and very hot. The inside is made like a winter dress but it is very beautiful.
3.0,"The order fulfillment was great, but it looked as though this pair of brass spider star clock keys would include an arm that would fit my carriage clock and none of them did--all the arms holes were too large to work with the carriage clock's time setting gizmo so neither was a replacement for the lost brass spider star key.<br />Very disappointing. I'd thought the numbering suggested smallest up to large."
3.0,"It’s ok, but hard to adjust and the color is nothing like the picture. I purchased the pink flowers but as you can see in the picture it’s almost brown in color."
3.0,"It’s a little short on me because I’m 5’9”. It doesn’t fit me like a dress as appeared on the model,  I like it and I’m still gonna rock it with my bathing suit"
3.0,It's hard to get off since there's not a lot of stretch in the shoulders.
3.0,Kind of like being barefoot but with a covering. I wear them but I would’ve liked a little more insole and for it to fit my foot a little better on the sides. Extremely wide slipper.
3.0,"This necklace was one for me and one of my besties, we got the same one. So cute but the metal did unfortunately turn my neck green and itchy after wearing for a long time. Sad I can no longer wear. But I do have sensitive skin so there was a 50/50 chance this would happen."
3.0,I ordered 3 shrits.  Out of the 3 this one came in the wrong size.  the other 2 shirts were correct and fit perfectly.
3.0,You could see every single crease and wrinkle and body imperfection. Even with spanx it was Way too see through. It  also got stretched out from trying it on  Returned.
3.0,Although it was ordered my size the blouse was way too small. Had to send back
3.0,All in all they are cute just too sngu in my chest aran m are & underarms
3.0,Scary but way too big
3.0,Had to return way too small but the skirt was cute.
3.0,Good product . Just wrong size for me . More like a 20 gauge
3.0,"They are too small. You should order 1-2 sizes bigger than expected if you're a man. I am 240 lbs 5'10"" bodybuilder build and an XXL fits like a fitted shirt on me. It is roughly the same proportions as a large Nike golf polo. So significantly smaller than expected. Great shirt though!"
3.0,"Mixed reviews! Grandbaby absolutely loved these earrings !!  She was especially glad that they had the screw on backs. Unfortunately less than a week later the back is missing and the earring had fallen out. They were able to find the earring but not the back. Mom had made sure it was screwed on the right way and all the way. Cut to 5 days later, and grandbaby has a full-on meltdown."
3.0,"The biggest negative from this was that the mask came with the black paint scuffed off on the forehead, the nose and the temple—so basically all parts of the mask that stick out. This might have been in transit because it was packaged in a clear mylar bag who no other protection. I didn’t notice until it was too late to return for another one. The eye holes are a bit narrow for someone with a wide pupil distance (71mm) so buyer beware."
3.0,"This product is pretty difficult to make straight/even on your breasts.  I have used other pasties, and strapless self adhesive products and this one just doesn't seem to look right.  One cup is a different size, not breast but the product :) It is hard to hide this product on tighter dresses with the string hanging down and virtually no low cut products can be worn without seeing the top of this product.  I would not suggest this for larger breasted women, I am 32 DDD."
3.0,"The mittens are very soft inside and out, but they are thinner than I expected and run small.  The thumb is barely big enough for me to fit my thumb in."
3.0,"Fits very oddly, and looks baggy. The pockets do NOT sit right when you wear it, and they poke out all the time. I bought it to pair with leggings, but it comes down farther than what the photos of the model show."
3.0,This necklace is light despite its size.  Isn't cheap looking. My only issue is that the lobster clasp wouldn't budge! Doesn't make sense to return which is unfortunate as it really is quite nice
3.0,"I like the patterns of these headbands. I was hopeful that they would stay in place, but they slide out of my hair."
3.0,These are more like plastic than metal and they are tiny so I wear them as knuckle rings.
3.0,Runs small and shrinks very easily.  Washed it once and it was too short  and I washed it in cold water and hun it up to dry.  No dryer.... Cute dress though....
3.0,It was not flattering at all.
3.0,Look great. My child had a blast with these but they didn't last long.  Cheaply made but good looking.
3.0,Cheap looking fabric and wish I hadn’t waited too long to return.  It’s now in the donation bag.
3.0,"Very cute design. My mother wore,one like this,back in the 50's. Only a few cons. The buttons are sewn in so right it looks like the,fabric may give over time. Also it's very unforgiving. I have a c section &#34;roll&#34; and it shows it. No hiding. But overall I'm happy. This will be my first swim suit since I gave birth and I'm looking forward to showing off"
3.0,"These earring are not the same as the first time I purchased them.  The first pair I received in April of this year were perfect! They were gorgeous, very fine, precise edges and curves.  Unfortunately, I misplaced one of the earrings and ordered a new pair because I liked the original pair so much.  The second pair I received seem lower in quality.  They kind of look like blobs until you get closer.  They are not nearly as crisp and well-defined as the first pair I purchase.  Even the packaging was different.  The first pair came in a nice black faux velvet satchel with &#34;Chuvora&#34; on the outside.  The replacement pair I ordered were in a tiny, cheap silver box.  I don't think these were made by the same company.  They seem like knock offs.  They are just okay.  I will still wear them but I am definitely disappointed in the second pair I received."
3.0,The fit around  the  caf
3.0,"Its approved and o.k.. I actually ordered this and another brand at the same time. The other is in the same price range and has many more reviews on Amazon. Compared to the other, this seems cheaply made. I doubt it will last more than an outing or two. I believe it will work for the game as it is NFL approved. I would order one of the more well reviewed one in the future.<br />I'm going to the Playoff! Go Chiefs!"
3.0,The crystals we believe are real. The bracelet is a bit tight for larger wrists.
3.0,It just wasn't what I expected. It ran Small and it fit funny
3.0,bought for my brother in law for christmas. these run small! very thin  fabric. good for summer nights- i end up wearing them since they're small for him.
3.0,"These were great but about 8 of the rings did not light up. When I distributed them at my daughter's party, we found out that many of the rings were not working. I felt bad for the kids who did not get a ring that lit up."
3.0,I think it’s cute but the sleeves seem like they aren’t finished they are wayyyyy to big for the outfit.  Need elastic in them to keep them from hanging a foot off my hands.  Everywhere else fits
3.0,"The material isn’t all that great, but it’s ok for something that one’s going to wear only once a year - it doesn’t wrinkle, which is good. I’m a size 20, and it’s very snug - I’m constantly pulling it down in the waist area. It’s cute, though."
3.0,Waist rolls with even the slightest movement. I don’t wear them often because of that. It’s irritating and uncomfortable.
3.0,Fit goot
3.0,Very cute dress just wasn't for my body type.I would order one size up from what you wear for a smoother fit.
3.0,Just okay wish I didn't buy for so much wasn't worth it
3.0,"Not sure who thinks this dress runs big.. the XXL fits like a M or L.  I couldn’t even get it on.  Maybe it’s just an issue at the higher end of the spectrum.  It also was VERY short, as others have said.  If you are tall or have a large chest it would be more of a tunic top.  Bummer because the fabric was nice and thick and it appears well-made.  Wish I could keep it.  The red was a dark crimson (think OU colors)."
3.0,"I really wanted to like this dress, but it had way too much fabric...I felt like I was swallowed up in the dress.  Pretty pattern though!"
3.0,Comfy but definitely not worth the $. More like pj top
3.0,"I have experience with socks. I know that most of them shrink when washed therefore I always order the largest they make. I wear a size 10.5 shoe so these fit fine when new. Then came the wash. They shank a lot! The only saving grace to these socks is that my wife, who wears a size 7 women's shoe, says they fit her just fine and she loves them otherwise I would have rated them at one."
3.0,Difficult zipper to zip coat.
3.0,Lo adquirí para regalo oses niña de 11 años y considero que es muy pequeño y de mala calidad
3.0,Took a while to arrive. Shirt was as expected
3.0,The Navy Blue looks purple in color
3.0,I ordered two sets in different patterns but received two of the same set which was a bummer. They are cute socks. I will use them.
3.0,"Overall it was too snug.  I bought an extra large (XL) and received what appeared to be a size 62.  Perhaps these are meant to be tight fitting, but I prefer something more loose.  Also there were small ""pulls"" in a couple of places that looked like one of the colors, in this case white and very obvious, where coming out of the fabric.  Despite that I would have kept it if it fit."
3.0,Look much cheaper in person. Memory foam is not as luxurious as you would imagine it to be. And they are manufactured to curve in such a way as to look very much like duck feet in person. If you're looking for affordable and somewhat attractive running shoes I would recommend looking elsewhere. If you're looking for some okay ones and you don't care what they look like then look no further.
3.0,"I got this HOTAPEI Women Color Block Crisscross Bandeau Push up 2 pcs Bikini in size SMALL and it is way too large for me. I was disappointed because I ordered two set of it (Blue and White) and the other has not been delivered yet and I am pretty sure it is also too big for me.I am hoping it would be a lot better but I don't know,I am crossing my fingers right now.<br /><br />The sizing is kinda misleading, it is not your typical small size. It is probably medium for US size. I really like the design and the color but unfortunately I can't wear it. I am really sad because I was waiting for days and days just to receive it and fit it but it turns out I have to give it to somebody bigger than my size.<br /><br />If you have small body and petite this is definitely not your type of swim wear, it is sexy and attractive (yes) however you will look awful and awkward if you will wear it. I tried it on right away and it is so funny because it fell off the floor.<br /><br />On the other hand the color and the material is really nice. It is made of nylon and spandex. The design is perfect  Hollow Out, Shoulder Strap and  Lacing. I would say this is definitely made to last long. If only it fits me, I would have given it a five star but sad to say it doesn't meet my expectation.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. It took 16 days to be delivered from the day I purchased it. The item arrived in safe and good condition.<br /><br />I uploaded pictures of the item for everyone to see the actual appearance of it. Now remember I ordered size small so feel free to comment if you find my review helpful."
3.0,"B-day present for my 3 year old.  We have to tie the ends of the cape because it's WAY too big for her little neck.  The mask also doesn't really fit her face either.  It seems to fit more like it's for a 5-6 year old.  But she sure loves it.  I suspect that if we wash it (or when we have to wash it) the Elsa/Ana image isn't' going to last to long either as it is kind of bubbly now, like it may peel off (it's sort of rubbery feeling)"
3.0,"Our daughter likes them, but they fall off a little too easily."
3.0,"These fit perfect. Mt only problem with these, they had a hole in the when they got here... I have it a 3 star because other than that problem, they are pretty nice."
3.0,The chain was already starting to tarnish when I received it.  And the owls eyes were not as big as shown.
3.0,"Kept it because it was needed, but weird fit"
3.0,"I based my purchase off of others reviews. I am normally a women's 8-10, my waist is 32 inches and while the top is pretty stretchy it does feel a bit tight but not uncomfortable tight. I should have purchased the bigger size but I have a feeling I am in between sizes &#62;__&#62;. The pattern is cute, there is way more dark blue than light blue. It's not that ombre because it becomes dark blue with hardly any fade into the lighter blue. I might return."
3.0,Very pretty. A little too big for my liking. Nice enough.
3.0,"The pictures are misleading. I bought this purse thinking it was navy and white, but it is actually black and white. The seller should update the description to say this."
3.0,The necklace was broken inside the pack
3.0,"Looked real good. Hard to talk. I liked that they gave you extra wax, I messed up the first time."
3.0,I like how think the material is on this. It will help me keep warm after going to the hot tub. The fit on it is not great though. It is very square. It's really just one large piece of fabric folded in half and tacked together under where you arm goes. It's nice enough but not very flattering of a fit. I do like it enough to keep it though.
3.0,They are not as comfortable as others that I have. They are a very tight fit.
3.0,The watch is pretty. It's just too big for my wrist :-(.
3.0,"I mostly love everything about these bras, however, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND sizing UP.  They run tight, consequently compressed me to the point of pain. Plus side, I wore them for 3 days prior to realizing I was in pain.  Very supportive, just size up, which I thought I had."
3.0,cute for one time wear
3.0,Es cálido pero no para fríos extremos
3.0,"I ordered these for my husband, and while they seem to be good quality, comfortable, and have a great pattern, they seem to run a bit narrow through the thigh area.  Most PJ pants run on the baggy side, so I was definitely surprised that they were a little tight even though I ordered up a size just in case.  He's going to keep them in the hopes they might get worn in a bit and worst case scenario, I will have inherited some cozy PJ pants!"
3.0,Very lightweight and barely any blue!!!But the SOLIDS were terrific!!!
3.0,Not very snug...would not consider them to be 'compression&#34;.
3.0,Cute but not soft
3.0,"Its good quality although it was on the small end i wear 10.5 but it was very thick which made fitting into my shoes kind of tight. For almost $20 i expected more than just one pair, but i guess the nfl license is steep. In my opinion its not worth it because $100 wont even get you a 6 pack which i was looking to buy i should have read the description and not assumed."
3.0,"I'm 5'8"" and 170 lbs. and I think my legs are proportionally long, but not too much so. Bought an XL and the fit is fine... except they're too short by about an inch, maybe two. I'll keep them because they're super soft and comfortable and I like the high waist, but feel like it'd look odd if I wore them out of the house, even for running."
3.0,"These are just a meh from me. They are pretty much the jewelry you use to do initial piercings and then you can change it to what you want.<br />I have used several of the pieces and they seem to be doing fine. I've had no bad reaction, they get the job done.<br />I would recommended but probably not repurchase myself."
3.0,wore it twice and it broke
3.0,Dress was a little thinner & loose than I expected. It almost looks like a nighty. I'm 5ft 110lbs and got a small. If it was available in XS it would've been a perfect fit. Still super comfy and cute though.
3.0,"The material and craftsmanship are not spectacular quality, but the top looks incredible in photos.  On a long torso, paired with a high waisted skirt it looks lovely in photos. This would be appropriate for a party or a photo shoot."
3.0,"Cute but tiny. Way smaller than I thought. It's more like coin purse size. It smelled funky too, like mildew/mold. Had to Febreeze it to get the smell out."
3.0,"Item as described: nice white, size matches, it's really elastic. It's a nice belt but don't expect too much. It's not leather so if you are wearing it only for few occasions that's okay... but not for frequent occasions !! ... Unfortunately mine didn't arrive on time, instead of 2 days shipping it took 4 business days with sunday it took 5 days ..."
3.0,They got sweaty and uncomfortable
3.0,cute suit and I like the style/ color but the top came defected therefore it is not wearable and will be returning
3.0,"Purchased the ""blue"" color which looks more teal/turquoise in the photos. This is definitely more of a baby blue/ grandmother goose color. I'm disappointed in the color but I love how these shirts fit so I kept it. This was my 3rd purchase of these shirts. If you don't care about color matching, then buy it."
3.0,I ordered the shirt with rose apothecary because it was such a great part of the show !<br />Also it was a shirt that I could wear with jeans or shorts and is very comfortable and not clingy
3.0,"Material feels like a bathing suit, and it wrinkles really easily. The dress did flatter my figure, but the material does not have much stretch to it. I did order my true size, I liked how it fit, able to adjust the shoulder straps.  The mid-section is tight fitting so if you’re heavier in that area I would go up a size because there is NO give in the mid-section and its non-adjustable in that area.  Overall I did like the dress, just would’ve preferred a different material."
3.0,"I really, really want to love this dress! The material is lightweight, so it would be great for spring or summer. The design of the dress is true to the pictures displayed, however, the issue came up on my chest area. I don't know if a bigger size would solve the issue, but a bigger dress would not sit as nicely on the rest of my body. The chest area squished my boobs, making them look indented. My husband said you couldn't really tell, but that's all I could focus on when I looked in the mirror. Unfortunately, I'll be returning this dress. Maybe it's just not meant to be for those of us who are busty. Every other part of the dress, I loved. It's a darling dress, and if you're not too well-endowed, I'd recommend giving it a try! I ordered a 2X, which is one size up from my normal.<br /><br />For reference, I am:<br />5'10<br />220lbs<br />size 16/18<br />38DDD"
3.0,"Nice shirt. Read several reviews saying to order up a size. Nope, medium is way too big. I don't like super tight fit, but don't like it to completely hang off me for a run, either. 🙄 Not happy about spending the money to send it back, but whatever."
3.0,"Nice wide leather belt with solid buckle. However, nothing really special. Don't gain any weight. I wear jeans with a 34 or 35 inch waist. With this belt, I'm already on the last hole."
3.0,"I like the maroon color, and the interior isn't itchy. It is thinner than I expected; and not really very warm feeling. It would be good for a light-weight beanie if you live in a place with a moderate temperature. Not necessarily the best for the snow! That being said, I do like the looks of it...so if you are going for looks, and aren't too concerned about being cold, this might be the beanie for you!"
3.0,Great Honda logo but the shirt is made out of an odd material and doesn't fit like a regular t-shirt. Tight in the shoulders and big arm openings.
3.0,"I see I am not the only one - this belt is great in many ways, but for some reason the &#34;onyx black&#34; body of the buckle itself scratches away really easily. In the end, mine was so bad I scraped it down to bare metal which looked better. Shame, because the belt itself is awesome..."
3.0,It was a pretty dress but too tight in the bust area.
3.0,Basic tee
3.0,fits small ... and it is bonded leather
3.0,The bottoms fit well but I’m a 38c and top runs very small . But the material seemed well made
3.0,About a size too large
3.0,"Great, silky material. Good fit. That being said, I had to re-sew all 8 buttons back onto the shirt, which is ridiculous. They are only held on by a single-knotted piece of thread. Quality is not a priority to this manufacturer."
3.0,Nice quality. It is small though the upper back and shoulders. No extra material in the seems to be let out.
3.0,Bigger to size fit but too long
3.0,"I order and XL as i am a 5’9”, 135 lb woman who usually wears a 4-5 and these pants were too big. im sad about it because i knew they would look sooo cute if i got the right size and contemplated long and hard on which size to get lol but since is so hard to figure out which size is right and the size chart didnt even end up helping me in the long run, these are a 3 star for the hassle of getting them and having to return them for the right size. if you can figure out which size you actually are for these pants, i’m sure they will be included in many outfits, but i, personally, am very dissatisfied since i went thru the trouble of re-measuring myself for the size chart on these and the pants were *still* wonky size-wise."
3.0,"It's cute, but it almost didn't fit. I wear a bra size 34 DD. The sleeves were almost kinda baggy and the bust was snug... I got the American flag pattern. It is a nice crop top, but I wish it fit over my bra! Lol!"
3.0,"This is not a sweatshirt. It’s a pullover. It doesn’t stretch. It isn’t thick. It’s more for layering vs warmth. My grandson loved it, so I’m fine with it but it should not be advertised as a sweatshirt."
3.0,This blouse looks comfortable.  I had actually forgotten that I had bought it so I still haven't worn it as yet
3.0,"Runs very small, and has almost no stretch in the shoulder arm area. Very cute dress, and good quality for the price"
3.0,Fits small in the bust. Wore a decorative bandeau to add modesty. Good for the price.
3.0,Expected these to be cooler but the material does not breath as promised. Much sweatier than my cotton or denim overalls.
3.0,Fit was a little smaller than expected.  This is super thin so something worn under it is needed.
3.0,nice - made a great gift
3.0,A little snug by ear but works well.
3.0,Very pretty but the chain is extremely thin and if it snaps there would be no way to re-attach.
3.0,"I was disappointed....the sleeves are not as flowy as the picture, the elastic around the neckline shows on the inside, I don't like that, and the material is not nearly as soft as I thought it would be. I should have read more closely though, it does  say 100% polyester, and it is not a typically comfy and is basically just cheap costume material. I was hoping for something could wear on the daily by itself and then dress it up for when I am wanting to be in costume but this definitely LOOKS like a cheap costume top. It also ran a little small."
3.0,Ran small. Get next size up
3.0,"Beautiful and lovely dress,  but sizing was way off."
3.0,"Shirt is Ok, the color is much lighter than the picture. Fit was a little larger but maybe it shrinks a bit"
3.0,"Its not the greatest quality. There were pieces of string that I had to clip off, however its still really cute. I would have really liked to have a tag with the size of the onesie but other than that and the quality it was a good product."
3.0,"I went by the size chart and was worried because many reviews say that koi scrub tops run small, but when I received my top, I was swimming in it! The pattern is beautiful, but the sizing is WAY off. I'm usually a size 6 or 8, but the size chart said that an XL was best suited for me - I am returning the top and am going to go down a size on the size chart (I do need some room for movement) and am thinking that will fit. For reference, I usually wear a small in Cherokee tops and a small/medium in Dickies tops."
3.0,"Good product for the price. Def not Maui Jim quality. Since i tend to loose glasses, I like em."
3.0,They look and fit great but some of the material has already starting busting.
3.0,"Not impressed.  I ordered the M and found them to be big on the legs and bottom (I am a size 7/8 jean).  These pants come up to my belly button because the crotch seam is very long, reminds me of mom jeans (height 5'2&#34;).  I don't find that to be ideal for work out pants.  They also are very, very thin.  I am surprised there is 8% spandex, I don't see that much pull on the pants.  They remind me of pajama pants.  Perfect for lounging around the house or cleaning.  I noticed that it said they could be worn with long shirts/skirts/dresses.  I found that my pants were bunched up around the waste to calves and wouldn't look &#34;clean&#34; enough for that.  Please click &#34;yes&#34; if my review if this review helped you out in any way.<br /><br />I received this at discount for an honest review."
3.0,I bought two (tan and black) size small and they fit completely different.<br />The tan shorts are slim fitting and the black shorts are very loose.<br />The black shorts are 2 inches longer in length
3.0,"I thought I was receiving a black beanie but instead received a tan one.  The stark contrast between the tan cap and the white ""ear covers"" takes the cap from a different kind look and makes it a ridiculous look.  Had they kept the two parts similarly colored I think it would look much better.  The tan beanie seems to be the only one they used separate coloring on..."
3.0,Ok but does not provide it much compression support.  Also runs larger than I expected so given some of the comments about running small etc seems to have a lot of variability in size
3.0,"We love this type of product, they are nice and breathable.  However they were all a bit big, wont stay in place.  so sad"
3.0,"This is adorable but it was very loosely packed & the headband was broken on both sides. Since I needed it for Halloween, I pinned it w/some Bobbie pins which were ok. I was disappointed though. Seems like the sender should have known to use some bubble wrap!!! The actual headpiece is adorable and would’ve received 5 stars."
3.0,They’re cute for temporary use. They will turn your nose green after a week or two of wearing but if you want to prevent this you can put clear nail polish on the part of the jewelry that touches your skin. One of them broke when I was opening it to put it on so beware and be carful with them!
3.0,"fast ship, good price....  tooth is cool, necklace ok"
3.0,The measurements were listed but it was smaller than it looks in the picture & fit pretty snug on a pandora braclet.
3.0,"Necklace is what i was looking for BUT... It did come tarnished! I was able to shine it back up with a silver cloth I have, if not it would have been going back. But maybe the seller might want to consider supply a silver polish cloth with it. Some other reviews I read seem to have had a similar experience as me.  Just what I was looking for though ❤"
3.0,"i got these cuz they look superfresh, but the thing is when you put them on it looks inverted. its hard to describe put the middle of the sunglasses are closer to your face then the edges on the end where it folds. however they are good for the sun, i wear these when its really sunny out as opposed to my other regular sunglasses because these are a shade darker and its easier to see."
3.0,Did not look as the picture. I returned it.
3.0,I got these for my fiance and we got a bag full of random sizes. Only 1 of them fits him well enough that he'll actually wear it.
3.0,Wears out after about 2 months. But then again they are just socks
3.0,The item shows a black pocket to store the back but I ordered twice and twice the back was missing
3.0,It's hard to know what size to order.
3.0,Cup is slightly small and so is band other than that we'll made
3.0,"Beautiful dress but is about 8 inches too long and too big by my measurements, especially in the bust, so was not very flattering.  Would have worked better with next smaller size. Got this to wear to my son's Halloween wedding but fortunately bought a back up that was more flattering.  Will keep and have altered to use as a Halloween witch's gown."
3.0,I liked the feel of the shirt but the neck went up to high to my neck. So that’s uncomfortable for me.  The color was good.
3.0,Product was awesome but not configured with my body type
3.0,"The sleeves are weirdly puffy, cute cut but weird sleeves."
3.0,"So I bought this for my partner as a gift . It fit pretty snug but I guess he likes it like that and it  . He is about 5’9 and weight about 185. It does work, but the catch is you have to buy a usb battery pack because that’s the only way it will turn on. There is a pocket inside the vest that will hold the battery pack. It does get pretty warm throughout the front and back of the vest.  It says it’s machine washable but I’m not sure how true that is when you cant disconnect the usb that’s attached to the vest. It was okay for the price but I didn’t know we had to buy a separate battery pack just to get it to work."
3.0,"nice, good quality, but smallish.."
3.0,"Great printing job, socks could be framed, unfortunately they were to small for my feet. The quality seems great and I would recommend this item to someone."
3.0,The zipper portion kept popping out (i.e. doesn't stay flat).
3.0,The cristals are both falling off the metal estructure and I haven’t have this for longer than a month and a half
3.0,"Nice bag.  The only complaint I have in in the packing of the product.  The body of this bag is fabric (linen type) and whoever packed it just kind of folded it up in the box, instead of going to the trouble to find a larger box and pack it flat.  I had to stuff it with bubble wrap and use my steamer on it to get the crease out of the bag.  I think if I pay over $150 for a bag, it ought to come packaged well."
3.0,Not what I was expecting. The case is a lot smaller then when I was expecting. Pencils however will fit in this bag.
3.0,"It did not work with my current system and I had to return them.  Also, it seems that battery is not replaceable, which it would limit its usage time."
3.0,"It worked enough I guess but it’s just not very stiff. The good thing is that even when I lost something in my bag, I could just lift the whole thing out of my backpack to see it all better."
3.0,"Not particularly pleased that the C/C inserts are not more secure, cards fall out when not opened upright.  There should be a better way than to just partition each item (Card)"
3.0,"This sweater does run small, I normally wear large so I ordered 1xl and it still doesn't meet in front. It also wrinkles easily, didn't expect this from a sweater...."
3.0,"Didn't last very long, seams tore quickly."
3.0,I couldn't check the volume of the outside noise before my kids used them. They were too tight.
3.0,"I appreciate the sellers, who were very responsive when I wrote a 2-star review. I had complained about the fact that it didn't have a seconds hand, was hard to read in low light, and that the rose gold color was rosier than it looked on my monitor. But the seller rightly pointed out that these design features are all part of the watch's minimalist design. So now I see it as a modern interpretation of an old-style design, which is cool if that's what you're after.  Although I was hoping for something that could be mistaken for a rather plain men's watch from the distant past, I like it well enough to wear it. And because I was keeping it, but wasn't 100% satisfied with my purchase, the seller kindly offered to reimburse me half of the price I paid, which I think is generous."
3.0,"The shorts are great, but it shouldn't be listed as a swimsuit."
3.0,"It is fine for light activity, but isn't great for anything high impact. I also feel it runs too loose, and I'm very well endowed. It may not be too large, but it's not snug enough. Overall nice enough for the cost, but I will need to purchase something more durable than this for my higher impact exercise."
3.0,"This sweatshirt is a little short, it ends above the hip"
3.0,"Received my order today, and it is super cute. It feels soft and comfortable. However the item was not as described. It is missing the cute koala feet it’s supposed to have with it. I just sent a note to the seller and hopefully they can either replace my item or send the feet separately?"
3.0,"The style of the frame looks nice. The picture through the lens is nice as well. But the frame is flimsy and fragile. The lens easily pop out of the frame which makes for a very fragile pair of sunglasses, and require careful care."
3.0,Cute. But could not really see through them sobthey werent really used.
3.0,Definitely NOT compression shirts... loose fit. Im usually a medium and got a medium... loose around the waist... not horrible... that pic misrepresents how they are going to fit. Good quality.
3.0,"The purse is the perfect size, color is nice, and was overall new. However, the strap of the purse arrived damaged (as you can see in the picture). Be wary and check other reviews! This may be a recurring issue."
3.0,It appears to be the genuine article for replacing the band on my Casio SGW100.<br /><br />It sure would be nice if it came with any kind of instructions for removing the old strap and affixing the new.
3.0,"I have been wearing Blaklader work pants on the job for 10 years, thought this may be an option. The material is very soft thin and comfortable, but not particularly durable, and the leg pockets some how end up below the knee and are basically unusable. I will probably wear them as “normal” pants, but they are just not useful on the job like Blaklader work pants are."
3.0,"These socks are great, however, they fit rather smaller than expected."
3.0,Recommended size of XL was too large. The pockets don’t lay flat and make your hips look huge. I returned it.
3.0,"Beautiful dress, but not meant for large chests, even getting a larger size."
3.0,"Super thin material & wrinkles every easily. For reference, im 5’3 and always buy size small-medium. The length is perfect on me. Its mid thigh. Not sure if it would be the best for taller women. I would never buy from this seller again. It took a month to get to me. I completely forgot I ordered it. Not worth the wait."
3.0,"I needed a warm robe. This one looked soft and cozy. It is!  Really comfy, nice size pockets, unbelievably soft. But it sheds. Everywhere. I've washed it multiple times since receiving it and there's gray fuzz everywhere in my home. On my sofa, notebooks, paper towels, curtains, clothes thsy happened to be near it....  if it ever stops shedding, I'll update. But I've washed it almost every day since receiving to cut down the shedding and it's still abundant."
3.0,"The colors don't pop like the ones in the picture, the colors are quite faded."
3.0,Bought size small. 5'3 with 130lbs. the bottom is okay wish it was sexier
3.0,Liked color and ruffle detail but fabric is stiff and didn’t hang  well
3.0,If you’re very petite or have no butt.::: don’t think you’ll have a existence of one after. But it it your busty this is perfect for a smaller looking chest
3.0,I guess for the price it is okay but I don't like the cut at all. It is too high under the arms and so you cannot wear it under any other top that is sleeveless. The quality doesn't seem bad but they are very see-through. If you only want to wear them under a top with sleeves I guess they are ok.
3.0,My daughter loves Moana so I got these for her Crocs. She loved the Hei Hei and Pua charms but Moana and Maui's colors are very off. It doesn't look like them at all. Otherwise they're cute.
3.0,They are shiny and big but the quality could have been better.
3.0,"IT FIT AS EXPECTED, BUT THE MATERIAL WASN'T VERY KIND TO THE SLIGHTEST AMOUNT OF FLUFF ANYWHERE. A CORSET WOULD BE NEEDED FOR IT TO LOOK SMOOTH AND ELEGANT."
3.0,"Like the style and it looks really cute, but the chain changed colors after a couple wears and it now turns my neck green so I can’t wear it anymore. You can’t expect too much for this price, but I was hoping to get more than a couple wears out of it."
3.0,"I was ready to post a rave review about how comfortable and cute these shoes were. However after wearing the shoes for the first time, all day inside of an office, the toe of both shoes is scrapped and the black color has come off. I wish they had held up better, since the style was so cute. If you are looking for a one time wear these would be a good option."
3.0,This thing hurts. Don’t get me wrong…as long as you stand up and be still you will be fine. If you have to walk it slides and don’t have to sit down. It digs in. The material is hard and pretty inflexible. I have tried several different times and it just wrecks my skin. I have even tried it over a tank top so it won’t rub my skin. Just not good.
3.0,The material doesn't stretch well around the bust area. I wear a 38 DD. The rest of the dress fit perfectly.
3.0,"Definitely a great price. The map on the actual watch is not as defined as the pictures, so that was a bit disappointing. But you get what you pay for!"
3.0,"They don't re screw very easy at all. A little bit of body oil, and you can squeeze the thing through without unscrewing them. Same with removing them."
3.0,"This shirt does not hang as beautifully as it does in the picture, so it ends up looking much more casual than professional. But for the price, it isn't bad."
3.0,"Purchased these for my daughter who wears a size 3 Kids. We had purchased a pair in size 3 Kids but they were way too big so we went down to a size 2 Kids. These were still about an inch to an inch and a half too big for her. She has long narrow feet, and the width was a bit wide but not bad.<br /><br />Runs about 2 sizes too big.<br /><br />We will be saving for a bit later in the year or next year."
3.0,"The product description is definitely not accurate. A little thinner than they make them out to be and the waistband is NOT as wide as they say, closer to 3.5 inches. They're fine, I wanted something thin and comfortable for work. Sizing is normal. These will do but the description is not accurate."
3.0,Great image but it runs really small for the size i bought. Kind of dissapointed because it stops me from wearing it. Order larger size. Besides that great shirt
3.0,"I am 5'4'', 132 lb and, since most reviews said it fit too small, I ordered a 10 size (two sizes bigger than what I normaly wear)... it was too big! So, if your order only one size up it will be ok.  The navy blue was a bit darker than I expected, but the fabric is also a bit see-through (you will have to wear a solid dark color bra). There were some details with the sewing, the lower &#34;edge&#34; was very uneven... BUT, I am quite satisfied with my purchase, the shirt looks very pretty, and I paid less than 5$ for it!"
3.0,Great price but you get what you pay for. Flags and not heavy enough to be thrown very far.
3.0,"This item is not as big as I thought it was, it was very small! It didn't really look the same to me! The shipping and everything else was fine."
3.0,Printing is DULL
3.0,"The watch looks really good especially for the price, however after a few hours you have to wind it again as it loses the time. Overall 3/5"
3.0,"They're good quality and not bad at all, just didn't match my face shape"
3.0,Not what I expected. I thought it would have more of a t-shirt feel. I got a small and it was supper long for my 5’2 height  . Went well past my knees. It would probably be better for taller girls.
3.0,the dress is cute. but it did not come with the tie to wrap around the waist
3.0,I liked the style but is too small
3.0,To much toe cleavage
3.0,too tight across the shoulders and arms.  I am medium build 5' 2&#34; but blessed with my Grandma's larger arms.  would not buy it again.
3.0,The designs on these are beautiful.<br />The scarf itself is tiny and too short for me to wear
3.0,"I ordered this watch for my 9 year old son. First of all the watch is very heavy making it hard to wear for a kid. Secondly, the description states waterproof,  but the directions specifically state not to get the watch wet. I am confused why it would advertise waterproof when you cannot even wear it in the shower. The watch itself is actually pretty cool, but it was not what I wanted for my son."
3.0,"I probably wouldn't buy this again. It works pretty well for flattening the stomach and making your curves more pronounced, however if you don't have a &#34;lifted&#34; butt to begin with it doesn't do much for you. I have a more wide butt than anything and the part that it supposed to lift your butt makes my butt look extremely awkward and then slides up to the top of my butt. I am 5'5, 140 lbs with a chubbier stomach, I usually fit into a med/lg. Most of the reviews said to order smaller, so I ordered a medium. It was a pretty tight fit, but it definitely gets the job done for the stomach are. As for the butt... just an awkward mess.<br /><br />Like I said, I'm sure this would work amazing for someone with an already somewhat lifted butt... however for someone with my build it wasn't so hot. Oh well! You get what you pay for :)"
3.0,Its way bigger than i thought it is very colorful !
3.0,Cute dress. Cheap material. It faded and pilled after a few washes.
3.0,"I liked it, but it came really late, like 2 months later. Also, it started to smell after a month. That metallic smell, so I threw it away"
3.0,"My breast size is a 36D and after reading what other persons say, i decided to go one size up (L). Got the dress and its too large on me...had to give it away and now I will order my right size which is a M."
3.0,I didn't like the word printed on the outside.  It's Ugly.
3.0,The colors are vibrant and dress fits perfectly for 5’5”. Only down side is the material is very hot making this dress not ideal for humid summers.
3.0,"I do not think the dress runs small at all.  I would say that if you are largely busted it would not work.  I am 5'9 143lb and a 36b and it fit fine even a bit big.  The yellow dress is pretty but would need a slip when worn.  For that reason, I do not like it."
3.0,"I’m 5’10 and bought an XL. I love the dress pattern and the way it fits on top. Unfortunately, I’m too tall for it and the dress length falls in an awkward place.<br />My mom is going to hem it and make it a knee length dress. So, I am not too disappointed."
3.0,The shirt was larger than expected and the material is quite odd. It's silky kind of like a dress shirt and not a t-shirt. Overall it's a decent buy but I would not purchase again if I knew what the material was like.
3.0,Cute looking but snug for size. Only worn for a day yet.
3.0,"First of all the shirt is very basic and nothing about it is flattering. The material is soft and the size does run a little on the small side. I am 5'1"" and weigh about 135. I ordered the large, per the suggestion, and it fit in the waist area but a little big on the shoulders and arms. Sleeves were to long. Very disappointed. I returned mine."
3.0,"Product description says fits ages 3-8. It is WAY TOO BIG. Way too big for my 6 year old girl. Fits my 9 year old boy, but pink unicorns don’t exactly appeal to my boy’s sense of style. I don’t see HOW these would fit a 3 year old."
3.0,Love ween shirts great does start to peel
3.0,"This looks essentially identical to the multiple Casio watches I had as a teenager, but I was surprised by how small it was when it arrived.  When I say small, I mean tiny, miniscule, almost eency-weency.  The band barely got all the way around my wrist.  Maybe I've grown alot in the last three decades, I don't know.  I gave it to my teenage son, and it was just right.  Except that he laid it down at a soccer field 6 days later and we've never seen it since.  I've lost $10 in worse ways than that...."
3.0,Cute but a little tight on the calves
3.0,"I ordered a small I am 5'0 and weigh 116lbs but I am very fit and have a little in the back end so it fit me a little too tight, I am returning it and will try to exchange for a medium.  Other than the size the quality seemed good and comfortable.  Don't like the padding in the front though it shows through the suit."
3.0,It is cheaply made but for the price it is what I expected.
3.0,The pattern is great but I was expecting better quality. The fabric is SO THIN and completely see through.
3.0,"I'm 5' 5&#34;, 155-160lbs, hourglass shaped. The dress is very cute, and I know it's supposed to be a body-contour dress, but this is just plain tight. I usually wear a medium or large (36 DD bra, so I default to larger size for things like this) and it was quite tight, not body-con tight, but the large ran small. I returned it because the white portion was see-through and I wasnt crazy about the material -- polyester, made me feel like i'd sweat in it. The pattern (I got the white top/black bottom floral print) hides tummy pudge front-on, but it's still visible from the profile view."
3.0,Very stiff but acceptable
3.0,"I ordered a size 6...normally wear a 4. It fit great, except length. It's really short. Cute shirt/dress though."
3.0,I like the bracelet but it is a little large for my wrist.
3.0,"The dress was OK, but very boxy, not flattering at all"
3.0,Fits tight and is so heavy
3.0,"I loved this bag. It would have been perfect for a stadium bag, which is what I ordered it for. Has a chic look to it, but on the model it is cross body length which is very deceiving. I am 5'2 and a petite person, and this bag, worn as a cross body, hit me right under the arm pit. If you are okay with it being a shoulder bag, then it's great, but if you want a cross body then this is not the bag for you."
3.0,"The shirts fit well and were low in cost. However, after the first wash the lettering on my shirt started to buckle a bit."
3.0,"It's very light weight, however since it is made out of zinc it is not that durable. It's also not 1.25 inches. It's right at 1 inch. Its also a lot skinnier than I expected. I would have hoped for something a little more even all the way around and also made out of a stronger metal. Although it doesn't hurt your chest when you run or jump with it on due to its light weight.The chain is a good length, but is also made out of a cheap material. It will break easily if it gets snagged on something and you pull your neck away. Its estimated value is definitely not at $9.99. I value it at more of a $4.99 retail value. And even at that that's not what it cost to make this. If you are looking for something more durable I suggest you look for a jeweler who customizes pendants and request one to your own liking."
3.0,"I ordered according to the measurement chart.  However, the dress is about 2-3 sizes larger than the measurement chart recommendations.  Also the zipper does not work.  The dress is beautiful!  I need only to return it and order a smaller size and cross my fingers that the zipper won't be broken!"
3.0,"love the pattern, which it wasn't shorter in front than in the back though."
3.0,The sandal was really wide and large.
3.0,"This dress was nice but the sizing is much smaller than expected.  I normally wear a Medium and based on this dress, I think a Large would be too small for me, it was that tight."
3.0,All other colors I ordered were perfect other than that white. The sleeves were extremely short but it's still a comfy shirt
3.0,It's nice the blue is very noticeable from far .<br />The loophole on the pendent is too small for a chucky chain.
3.0,Runs 2 sizes too small. But nice quality
3.0,It's okay but definitely runs way too big. Can't wear it so it'll be gifted.
3.0,"I am a strong believer in you get what you pay for, it is a little to big on the back. The shoe color is more beautiful when you have it on, and does not hurt as other shoes do."
3.0,"okay, too heavy"
3.0,"It looks beautiful but not the best quality. Very likely, will change colors soon. I’m also scared the diamonds will fall off quickly once I start using them. You can use it a couple of times."
3.0,Love the look. Size is a little big along with the boot itself. Nice looking shoe
3.0,"I love these glasses, I love the wood (don't like plastic) but I have had 2 pairs break. One pair broke where the hinge connects into the end of the wooden arm and another pair the wooden arm just broke while I was putting them on. I take great care of my glasses so the breakage was surprizing.<br />Overall I love the style and design and the lens but they haven't lasted long."
3.0,"Bracelet is small and hard, not plyable."
3.0,The color is not like the picture (see actual picture). Other than that it’s a good dress.
3.0,"To big for mi little princess, but pretty"
3.0,Very see through and didn’t look good on me but that doesn’t mean it won’t on someone else
3.0,Having sizes would help.
3.0,Does not fit vivomove hr
3.0,"It does the job but the foam is on the thin side, a little thicker would make the quality better"
3.0,"For the price I pd,the quality is equal.its not created for daily wear or daily routines, although i purchased this item for wear at random times,pic's,a certain outfit,or certain occasions.i am a owner of a $380.00 Perry winkles rose gold 18 kt.and the clasp is so very sm I have troubles putting it on/off.so again for the price,i am a pretty satisfied customer,no complaints,shop on!!!🤑"
3.0,Love the colors love the wallet purse is like cardboard and huge.
3.0,"proper sizing, aging too early in the wash"
3.0,"It does the job… Works good, it’s light weight… Just thought it would be better made for the price… It does work pretty good tho :)"
3.0,"I really wanted to love this cami, and for the first few wears it was great. After being washed a few times though the fabric became rough and pilled terribly. It's not the end of the world as it's never seen when I wear it, but I wish it had held up better."
3.0,"Wasn’t the best quality, stones came broken on bracelet"
3.0,The gold and silver coloring wear off in about 2 weeks leaving it dull pink color but overall very nice.
3.0,"I bought this for a funeral, so it was just intended to be for a single use. My Mom and our family had an inside joke about birds, and I was on the hunt for a cool tie to wear for her funeral. This was perfect and it made a lot of people smile.<br /><br />I wore it again to a party and noticed it looked a little beat up when I put it on. By the time I removed it, it was pretty well done.<br /><br />It was perfect for a one/two time use. And the price is reflected in that. But it's a fun print perfect for what I wanted and lasted long enough to suite my needs!"
3.0,"I like that they're ultralight socks, which is great for skiing. But I don't like the fact that they're too warm in the beginning; my feet get hot quickly and then they start getting cold, I think because the socks don't help too much with moisture wicking.<br />I've used them for skiing and for outdoors running at 29F."
3.0,The ear loops break as they’re being put on.
3.0,It felt really cheap but you get what you pay for.
3.0,They are smaller than expected.
3.0,"These jeans are gorgeous, they are very tight in the calves but are very loose in the waist and butt... I think if I got them any smaller they would not fit my calves but any bigger and i couldn't wear them.  I usually wear 14 but I got the size XL after reading other reviews.  I am going to wear them a while and see if they won't work.  They are much darker than the picture at the top and are the exact color of the jeans pictured at the bottom of the ad.  They really are pretty and don't feel like low quality but they are a bit thinner than other jeans.  I am al in all happy with them though!  Also they have NO rips or holes in them anywhere..  after trying these out<br />I am returning the jeans they were extremely tight in the legs and too big in the hips and waist...  They were very uncomfortable after wearing them a while.  The embroidery is very pretty but the jeans were very dark indigo blue and do not have any rips or tears anywhere...."
3.0,"I liked the dress, though I expected more from the belt.  The main reason for the purchase was because I loved the bow.  The material on the back was barely enough for a bow.  There also should have been more interface in the waistband.  The material just folds because there's nothing there.  The length right great."
3.0,The waist was too small and the material was horrible
3.0,"5 stones had fallen out before they even got to me. I was able to glue them back on myself, I worry about the other stones falling out though. Beautiful earrings though!"
3.0,The rings are awful. Advertised as 16g silicone. What you get are 18g rigid plastic that break when you try to open them enuf to actually put them in your piercing. I had one in my ear snap in half just from drying my hair with a towel. Only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is bc the studs are pretty nice. They are long and can be cut to size. They can also be bent to fit your nose.
3.0,Running smaller as compared to the ones I already had.
3.0,Lots of pockets that are very useful. But the zipper blew out after just 3 months of use.
3.0,This took too long to receive and some of them did not work : (
3.0,"Looks the same as old identical hat, but doesn't sit the same.  Still made well, just like other better :("
3.0,"Boots are comfortable.  Good support and fit. The elastic laces are misleading,  cannot adjust to tighten. It took forever for the shoes to arrive. Tracking information only say they have shipped,  no updates as to where they are. I was not impressed with that."
3.0,"This bag is exactly what I wanted and is very pretty, BUT there was dried glue all over the clasp. I was able to peel it off after much work, but really where is the quality control?<br />I didn't send it back as I needed it immediately for a wedding, but I will think twice before ordering again."
3.0,They tend to fall off in the night.  I most likely will toss them because of this.
3.0,Ring looks actually like pictures. It’s nice just wish it wasn’t so thin and fragile. Other than that i love it.
3.0,"This product is okay, it thin and see through not as sturdy or thick as I would’ve liked."
3.0,This top was just too big and too bulky to look good. I had to return it.
3.0,"The dress was....cheap. I mean you get what you pay for. I had to add a cute belt to the dress for it to fit well, as the bust fits somewhat fine, but the waist is HUGE and looks like a dang moo-moo."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:3b1f97c60580a5c082e04337365550c0]] The glasses that was post her doesn't look like the one I get . You can see in the picture.<br />But the glasses are comfortable to ware they looking classic.<br />And its blocking as it says
3.0,The color of the shirt is a little off from the picture.
3.0,Very pretty up close. Stone fell out about 3 weeks in tho
3.0,"Darling dress! Perfect in all ways and the advertising picture is spot on. I do wish they would advertise with actual numerical sizes versus the alphabet sizes (S-XL). I received the dress in perfect condition! I'm 181 lbs and 5'4. I typically wear a size 14 in pants, L in shirts. I wear a 38DD. Their size XL came with an actual numerical size which is a size 12. So I need to return it. The dress just hugged me a bit too tight. But if they sold an XL, I would totally buy it in a flash!!"
3.0,"The style is flattering and the fabric is comfortable but the print is not as bright as I'd like. Instead of bright green and blue, it looks more brown. The hem is raw and one edge has a strange notch cut into it. Thank goodness it is a small defect and I hope it doesn't &#34;run&#34; up the skirt with wear and ruin the dress."
3.0,"Its ok. Not really a tie dye pattern. It’s a graphic that was printed, looks more a bunch of los res blobs."
3.0,"The chain clasp broke the very first time I tried it on. The top of the necklace kept falling forward, wouldn't stand up as shown in pictures."
3.0,I like the pockets but they slide down when I raise my knee
3.0,Product is almost plastic like.  It's very cute and would recommend for a child.
3.0,"Look cool and was very comfortable but the design started to wear off after a couple of months and not very durable, a couple of quarter size holes appeared after a while."
3.0,It is a very pretty looking piece. The drawback is that it is only attached by a hook so it doesn't dangle. It lays almost flat because the bottom is in the belly button hole and not enough dangle for the letter to hang down.
3.0,It's too short and creates more lumps
3.0,"I was squeezing it when partly tightened and I could tell I was strong enough to shatter this thing with my hands. I have one made of beachwood and it's much stronger. I don't think this can really stand the force you need to stretch a shoe so I'm sending it back. Nice try but it's a risky price and sure enough, can't do the job."
3.0,Like it and all but it’s to big for my son head so disappointed in this hat. I live in Juneau Alaska right now it’s -5 out side.
3.0,"I love the idea, but they fit wierd and turn outward constantly."
3.0,Super cute dress matches the summer so comfortable but unfortunately  runs too small :(
3.0,I expected it to fit a little larger. Definitely order up a size
3.0,"This product is a good size to sit close to my nose. It is very secure, but overly so. I needed a friend with pliers to close it. It's obvious that removal will be difficult since fidgeting with it as a test didn't move it at all."
3.0,It doesn't look as pretty in person and keeps on getting twisted...
3.0,"The material is weird. It doesn’t feel like normal shirt, but the print looked ok and fit well"
3.0,It was a great dress while it lasted. The fabrick broke after one month. It was very sad. The strap fell off and the side of the dress had a big hole.
3.0,"Too small - I sent them back and bought the bigger size. I love the style of the glasses, but do yourself a favor and buy the 5 3/8 version"
3.0,They are nice but fall apart easily and a few of them are kinda weird to wear like the one was basically a piece of string
3.0,Not the best quality very thin
3.0,"I usually wear a XS or Small. I got this in a size Small after reading reviews and should have gone up even more! It was mostly tight through the arms. I liked the length, cropped enough for what I was looking for. The pockets were pretty small though. It is 100% polyester and so the material was not very soft or nice feeling. That ultimately made me decide not to exchange for a larger size. I just returned the one I purchased."
3.0,"The sweater is very pretty, a little scratchy. However, the 4/6 shrinks drastically when washed in cold water which leads me to believe that it is wool and if so, explains the scratchy feel. I did not wash this one after making that mistake with my first one and it shrank to child size. I am going to use the care instructions for wool that I found online and will not wash this one in cold water."
3.0,"I purchased these in 0g but when they arrived the label on the package said ""0g - 5'8"" which is not what 0g is, obviously. They were far too large for my ears, definitely 5'8"" rather than 0g. They were all really beautiful so I've placed one more order hoping this was just a mistake... We'll see...<br /><br />Edit: Reordered and received the correct size this time, although they're still labeled ""0g - 5'8"". So far I've only worn the lotus eyelets, which were my main reason for purchasing the set. They're high quality and give a nice, feminine look. I've worn them for three days straight, showered with them once, and experienced no irritation - although my ears are not particularly sensitive. It seems to me that the tunnel itself is stainless steel while the lotus part might not be. So if you're sensitive, you might want to avoid this set or paint any of the possibly not stainless parts that could come in contact with your skin with clear nail polish.<br /><br />All in all I am now satisfied with this set. Even if I never wear any of the other tunnels, I love the lotus ones enough to make the price worth it to me, but I'm sure I'll wear a few of the other pairs as well. It is therefore an excellent value."
3.0,"I am a small woman but the armholes on this vest were so small that I could barely put my arms through without a top underneath.  With a shirt underneath, it was way too tight."
3.0,Love this mask except it is much too large for my head!! I had to stuff the inside top with a winter  hat. I could not see well from the little slits in the mask so I had to enlarge them.  I have a small head but I doubt if it would fit well even with someone with a large head.
3.0,"It kept sliding up, did not work so well with my dress as i had to keep adjusting it"
3.0,"Dress was nice, however the fit was a little larger than expected."
3.0,They took over a month to arrive and the quality is poor.
3.0,Did not know was a crop top
3.0,Cute.  AS expected for the price.  But not super great quality.
3.0,Beautiful ring but it ran small and didn't fit my normal size. I would reccomend ordering a size larger when picking size.
3.0,"Runs alittle small, unless you like your shirt feeling like a second skin. Don’t like the see-thru lace on the back, scratchy material."
3.0,"First being said: the design is good, and the locket looks great.  Once I put the pictures in, bought a chain, and gave it to my fiancee, she really liked the gift.  The advertised &#34;gift box&#34; included was a cardboard piece of junk, immediately discarded once the gift was given, but that was only a minor disappointment.<br /><br />The biggest flaw is that the locket often won't close.  It gets misaligned and the hinge has to be wiggled for it to close again.  I was always gentle--I wasn't going to force open a loving gift to my fiancee--so this is not due to customer misuse.  And it started happening the second time I opened it.  I feel like I paid $50 for a $10 locket.  Is the Celtic Claddagh design worth 40 bucks?  Not to me.<br /><br />For $50, I was not expecting a masterpiece by any means.  However, I did expect a sturdy locket that properly opens and closes.  I don't feel like I received what I paid for: not at all.  I would give this product 5 stars if it had cost $10-15 for the quality I received.  At the listed price, however, it is deserving of no more than 3 stars."
3.0,beautiful earrings but lock of one was loose...... it was coming off by it self... so had to return... otherwise very beautiful
3.0,"pros: comfortable, price<br />cons: gets loose by itself<br />recommend for sporadic use not daily swimmers use Nike remora instead even less confortable but will never get loose by itself"
3.0,"I really like this band. Seemts to be high quality, very well made. Color matches picture. Fits perfectly with plenty of room to move up/down a few notches if needed."
3.0,It was a bit too tight.
3.0,It is a bit bigger than I thought but definitely has space to fit everything you need!
3.0,Love the styles but a couple of them broke in either the clasp or the chain parts.
3.0,"Love the band, but it is not real leather. Fits well and looks good. A bit expensive."
3.0,The fabric is silky and the actual tanks are very cute. The problem is they run small. I’m ordering them again in a bigger size bc I actually do like them so I hope the next size works. I. ordered the XL the first time. They’re skin tight.
3.0,Pretty shoe but heel is too high.
3.0,Only disappointed with the size
3.0,Great Quality However I bought a size larger than needed and they barely fit my son!! Really nice just make sure you size up ESPECIALLY if your child has wide feet!
3.0,Top was way too big and pants were way too small.
3.0,Band is simular & will work. The issue is the specialized pins needed are not provided.
3.0,Not as big as pictured I wish that the stone on top was slightly larger.
3.0,"Love the style and the fit. However, the color is not a typical gray. I was planning to match it up with gray jeans, but wouldn’t dare wear with those. The color is more of a grayish green....not an attractive color."
3.0,Smaller then what I wanted
3.0,"Very nice colors and very soft. Length of sleeves was great and length of sweater was good not too long to cover the butt but not a belly riser. Here’s my issue: ( maybe I’m to blame for choosing this size) I picked a size Large . I’m 5’4 and 205 lb so it fits , it’s not snug. it’s comfortable but.. does it fit like the photo nope ! So maybe an XL would of given me some room but I dont see it being a very loose fit even a size up given my size.  So that also compromised the look of the sweater details."
3.0,"Wife says three stars because you can't tell the front from the back.  I am leaning more towards five stars because, WHOA they look amazing. Hard to keep my hands off and the tan line is going to be super hot!"
3.0,I bought this so I would have something easy to throw on at the pool. Well I ordered a M and it was way....way to big for me. I gave it to my mother in-law that is a XXL and it fit her better then me. Just orde small then what you are.
3.0,Pretty dress and decent quality for the price but runs small in chest area
3.0,"Fits well, is flowy and flattering but I am a 2X and only 5'1"" so it is long and so looks matronly on me. I really like it so I am going to try to shorten it."
3.0,The shirt was alright. I mean it was definitely smaller then I was expecting. I have bought things a size smaller and still fit better then that shirt but if you buy larger then what you need it will get the job done.
3.0,I love the look of these sunglasses but they gave me a horrible headache.  I could only wear them for about a half an hour before I had to take them off.
3.0,Clumsy. Does not fold down easily. The fabric seems durable. Everything else seems weak.
3.0,He will grow into them
3.0,"Not quite the picture suggests, the crystals are spaced apart, but pretty enough"
3.0,"The dress fit me amazingly, but the material was very thin. I think it would look really nice for the right occasion but it just wasn’t for me."
3.0,"The brocade looks beautiful, but the cut has a way of curling away from your body, making it look cheaply made. The sweetheart neckline really floats off your body, and looks plain awkward."
3.0,"I'm a big guy and a chef, and this worked great for me. However after washing it, much like I have done with countless other compression wear - this began to fall apart at the seams. It's still holding on, it's just not able to take much wear and tear after it's first wash.<br /><br />I'm rating 3 stars based on the fact I was happy with my purchase when I first got it. I'm still using it, just not as much as before. Now it's worn mostly as support since it is compression wear."
3.0,It fits tight especially in the wrists. The wrists were so small that my son couldn't get his hands through.  I got a 2t and 6 for both of my sons. Neither could get their wrists out of the sleeve.  The bottoms fit pretty good.
3.0,"The fabric is heavenly but they are sized for a man - although to be fair, they'd probably fit women starting at size 9 feet."
3.0,"This swimsuit is so adorable!  I love the iridescent colors of the bottom and the tail.  The tail works as a perfect cover up  and it's fun for my 4 year old.  I gave this 4 our of 5 stars because the bottoms are a bit large and my daughter does not like the tail when it is wet.  Because it is made of polyester, the tail clings horribly which my daughter does not like and refuses to wear it any longer."
3.0,"This did not fit me, I needed a size larger, tight through bust, got a large, 36D bra size.<br /><br />These colors are really bright, you will NOT blend in.<br /><br />I’m felt the fabric was good quality.  The material around the neck seemed a bit questionable, had the dress fit I would have replaced that."
3.0,i've been buying these every time i size up but i only got two pairs.
3.0,"Very cute dress but I am swimming in it! I usually wear an x-small but purchased a small as it was the smallest size available. Since the straps are adjustable, I can make it work as a casual dress but the fit doesn’t look like the picture. I’m 5’5” and besides being extremely “flowy,” the length comes below my knees. The pattern is cute and I’ll keep it just for hot, casual summer days."
3.0,The words were cut off but it was still cute. It was a little too tight for my 4 1/2 yr old I got a 5t.
3.0,"Cute, but came with a hole in one of the socks :("
3.0,"Good product, but does NOT fit my Shoei Neotech 2 helmet.  The Tab is too thick to fit thru the buckle."
3.0,"Just to give you some reference, I run around a size 16/18, C/D cup, and I ordered the XX Large....it fits perfectly.  I probably won't wear it because it's a bit too short for me and nobody wants to see that. Eek. If you're shorter than 5'9&#34; you should be fine."
3.0,It's ok.. Fits small and blew of my head into rice twice.
3.0,It's just ok. Could be better quality but it's not too bad. My husband likes it more than I do. The material is a little scratchy at the edges.
3.0,It didnt fit it all i really like it im 😢 sad
3.0,"Top is a little more puffy than shown in the photo, not quite the V neck shown either."
3.0,"This was awkward in the shoulders. I ordered a 2x (I usually am a 2x, with a 38-40DD bra) and it was just too tight. Gave it to my sister who generally wears a large and she loves it! Great quality, wrong sizing."
3.0,I have ordered before from digabi with complete satisfaction.  These cuff links however.... not as good.  They are significantly a lighter purple then shown. I have a dark purple French cuff shirt. These are more of a light lavender. They do work with this shirt however the contrast is noticeable. If I wear a black blazer or pants it is not as noticeable but still I do prefer the picture to actuately represent the shade.
3.0,It is nice but really short. I think would bit better petite ladies or younger girls
3.0,"This is cute, not the best quality. One end is bent just enough to make it not sit completely comfortably on my wrist."
3.0,"Bottom fits tighter than the top and the material isn't that great but you can't beat the price. My advice, purchase two in different sizes to mismatch top/bottom as the sizing is off."
3.0,"The colors are pretty. The cut at the neck is terrible, it is off center which makes it look weird. The fit of the dress is good."
3.0,"My daughter is getting married this summer and her only instructions were to wear a long dress and it had to be gray.  After unsuccessfully searching all the department stores in my area, I decided to order online.  I was originally looking for a lighter gray or silver dress because of being outdoors in summer, but like the darker charcoal shades better.  This dress had a slight steel blue tint to it, but not enough for the bride to veto as an acceptable color.  I wanted a dress without a tight waist since I'm a bit thickish in that area, and seeing the laced up back sealed the deal.  Unfortunately, there were two serious problems with the dress, which resulted in my returning it.  First, there was a 2&#34; long tear in the stitching at the front waist which was not repairable.  When I opened the package, the dress was inside out, so I don't know if it had been tried on before and the wearer shipped it back that way to avoid detection, or if it was just a flaw in the sewing.  The other problem was the sewn in bra cups were about 3&#34; too high, very thick and rigid, and just all around weird.  There was no way to remove them without cutting apart the entire inner lining.  I didn't even bother trying to lace up the back because the front was so ill fitting and I knew as soon as I saw the gap in the stitching that the dress was going back.  If those two flaws weren't present, I would have kept it and given it 5 stars.  It's a pretty dress for the price."
3.0,this is cute but cheaply made.  i would recommend it for a young person with smaller ears.  It does not fit as pictured on an adult ear.
3.0,No me gustó el marco lo encontré muy débil
3.0,They were very pretty but too small. Ordered size 14-16 but they were more like a 10-12 (maybe smaller). There was no tag with size on either suit.
3.0,Looks comfy usually wear a 7 they feel to tight getting 7.5 I’m taller they look like they have so much comfort they r two inches higher
3.0,"This product looked like it would be very warm, but it doesn't work as well as my fleece. Not bothering to return it because it was inexpensive. Will probably donate."
3.0,"I like the look & feel of these gloves, however, they are not near warm enough for ND winters. Better than my other gloves, but I had to warm up after 2 mins of shoveling snow. Would probably be great somewhere with mild winters."
3.0,its too long and a little big..
3.0,"don't like the post it seems the color will be removed by my ear, not sure if it will irritate my skin."
3.0,"Not supportive enough for my workout. i ordered xxl, find it a bit too big, maybe should have ordered the xl.<br />Fabric is great and the shape is nice. but i won't buy again.<br />Removed the padding right away, found it too much ""padded"""
3.0,The dress is amazing but it’s literally like a spandex material which made it look weird and cheap. I ordered the black dress and the material matched my leggings that I just ran in
3.0,"My son got this as a gift and was very happy with it. He is very much into anime and this went towards his vast collection. Happy kid, happy mom so I would have to say it was a good product. I don't however like how llomg it took to get here."
3.0,Look great when we received. Some of the attachments came off and were lost 😢
3.0,"Material isn't the best,kinda that picks up everything!"
3.0,"I love the fit and feel of these pajamas. I washed and hung them to dry with no changes to the size or shape. Would definitely buy another pair.<br /><br />Update: Very disappointed to see that, after just a couple of wearings, there is a hole in the fabric. I just ordered another pair two days ago and am now rethinking my decision if the fabric is this fragile."
3.0,"Very THIN SEE-THROUGH material. True to size, beautiful, just be ready to cover your butt area because it’s ridiculously thin/see-through."
3.0,Just doesn't seem to fit right in my head.
3.0,Cute but boxy for.
3.0,I bought these to have more choices in my bands. The serve that purpose but the are not as comfortable as my original band. Also the color rubs off of the sides. Several are blue on the sides now. All in all not bad for the price.
3.0,Red wasn't a true red. Wasn't totally crazy about feel of fabric.
3.0,"I've had this for about two months now. It's a nice henley. Fits great (as long as you size up--see their sizing chart) and it has a nice style to it. It's a great weight for what I wanted; it's pretty thin. It also is pretty soft with a slight scratchiness to it. I don't usually notice that but if my skin is dry I might.<br /><br />The main reason for my low review is that it developed a hole in the sleeve a couple weeks ago, so after six weeks of pretty gentle wear.  I think this is not durable enough."
3.0,"Great color and style. I should have ordered one size up, but might stretch a little!"
3.0,"I ordered this vest set in charcoal color, but what I received was more of a very dark purple.  It fits nice, and the purple color is actually pretty nice as well.  I was also alittle disappointed that the pockets shown on the vest aren't actual pockets, they simply give the appearance of actual pockets.  Aside from getting the wrong color, it is actually a pretty nice set for the money."
3.0,"It's a nice bathing suit, but too big. I ordered a size up based on the reviews, but was too big. I would suggestion buy as per the sizing chart."
3.0,Upon slipping it in the shoe and putting my foot into it . The heel felt good but the ball of my foot didn't feel comfort.  It felt like my heel was a bit taller.  And I don't believe it's worth $20.  I'd say more like $5.  Just my honest Opinion.
3.0,"It seems like okay quality, but the belt is not true to size and I will have to use the hole punch to make it work. There is just such a large amount of belt left after that I will have to also trim off the tail end, which will make it look a little sloppy. Overall not a bad price though."
3.0,"Nice looking tie, but I agree with another reviewer that the knot is way too big and is therefore impossible to use on a little boy's collar!"
3.0,This pen wrote beautifully but I noticed right away the screws for the clip came loose often. I put a little thread locker on them but they are so short it didn't help and now someone has my beautiful pen and I have just the clip
3.0,"This dress unfortunately did not meet my expectations. I was expecting it to be more of a tshirt fabric, but it’s more of a slightly shiny knit. It wasn’t sheer, but the dress is very thin. You’d have to be very careful of what you wear underneath it. The orange color is also a bit more muted than the photo. The seam on the back of mine was also sewn crookedly, resulting in the fabric bunching up.<br /><br />Overall, it’s not a bad dress for a costume or something of that sort, but for everyday wear? It just doesn’t quite work. Will be returning."
3.0,They help with the glare of oncoming traffic however they do not makes your vision sharper.
3.0,"Fabric seems thin, more like a Tee shirt than a sweat shirt."
3.0,Looked so promising but arrived & very cheap feeling. Don’t believe it will hold up we’ll.
3.0,"Sizing guidelines were not accurate. Nice jacket though. Saved this one for a different grand kid. Nice jacket, she loved it, just way too big."
3.0,Top fit great but bottoms way too tight. I am small and still way to tight. Manufacturer needs to adjust to sizes of most small women. the bottoms were child sized.
3.0,"Super light weight. Cool design. However, it is SUPER tight. I’m an XL in everything, but this XL is way too tight. I would go a size up if you’re going to give these shirts a shot."
3.0,"Washed it twice. A few more times and I might wear it.  Design is swell, tho."
3.0,I love this style and the material is nice. Runs a little small and shorter than I would like.
3.0,It’s beautiful; but makes my skin itch<br />Looks elegant
3.0,This is not as long as portrayed in the photos. It’s much shorter (and I’m short). Very light weight waffle weave. Not exactly what I expected. Don’t know if I will keep it or not.
3.0,"Style and color are cute, but way too small.  I had to return it.  Curvy people, order no less than 2 sizes larger."
3.0,I bought this because I thought the touching would be flattering but I feel like it just calls more attention to everything you don’t want to draw eyes to. Also felt the fabric looked cheap. I think this dress is trying too hard.
3.0,"These are soft and very comfortable. My size, however was far too large and too wide."
3.0,"Face front is a nice width. Ear loops are inset, so very close together. Great for a toddler or very small child, but I had to boil the earpieces to bend them to a straighter line for my child."
3.0,"Lens' were much lighter than I expected, made my eyes a lot more visible to others than I'm used to with sun glasses. This also didn't seem to provide much light protection which is important to me. They were  VERY small- almost seemed like lens' were sized for a large child or adult with a very thin/narrow face. I definitely recommend buying the larger size (I couldn't visualize the measurement given but opted for the smaller since I don't like aviators that completely cover or are larger than my face either).<br />On a positive note, they do seem to be quality made and physically look nice. Disappointed they didn't work for me- but not every pair of glasses will work for everyone."
3.0,"Nice and warm, but sized for small head (child).  The pictures are deceptive, in that the tail and bib are short, and the brim does not extend very far.  They could have made this a great product, but like no one ever tried it before marketing it.  Save your money and look further or buy a good scarf."
3.0,"Exactly what I was looking for and it fit perfectly!!! Super flattering if you're trying to hide your tummy area. The fabric is breathable and the length was perfect. However, the first time I wore it I was at my boyfriend's dad's birthday party, some of fabric started to separate from the elastic band creating a small hole. Luckily I always keep an emergency sewing kit on me and was able to stitch the fabric back to the elastic band in the bathroom. It's a band aide for now until I have the time to reinforce the stitching. It's a cute comfortable dress but the fabric might be a bit heavy for the elastic band."
3.0,I've been told they look very French. My bf also says they look cheap because the black color on the whiskers does not wrap around the whole way. the plastic does glare and the glasses are heavy enough to leave compression marks on your cheeks 😫. The colors were just as the picture.
3.0,"They are nice gloves but definitely not for keeping hands warm. Maybe to protect or grip, or for a costume but not for Pennsylvania winters."
3.0,Fit is fine and dress is nice but way too thin of material - I will have to unfortunately return it
3.0,Too small order up a size
3.0,Ordered size 9 men and fit 9 women basically...not what we expected
3.0,I wish I couldve returned it but it broke within 2 days. I like the design but the durability is not good.
3.0,"Mask was good, however be aware that they don’t accept any returns. I bought multiple masks online to see which was best and now am forced to keep this one even though I did not wear it"
3.0,V-neck is barely a V-neckline. Fit tighter than expected and the length was shorter than expected/like. The positive is the fabric was super soft and the color was awesome (ordered the red). Unfortunately the negatives outweigh the positives; disappointed in this purchase.
3.0,I love this dress. I get a million compliments on it. It is a little thin and I did have it altered to fit me.
3.0,"Made well, however it was a little too large overall. I'm tall 5'9&#34; 173lbs with a long torso, ordered a large, was a little too long."
3.0,"I bought for BOBs. I bought these hoping they weren`t the ""disposal ones"". They feel like you might get several uses out of them. Considering you get 4 for $8.95 you should get your moneys worth. You get what you pay for but will work in an emergency."
3.0,"Nude material, but somewhat small. Slit is higher than I expected from the picture."
3.0,Although the shirt is cute it does not look like the picture at all. The picture looks ribbed and the neckline looks like to is low. The fabric is silky and the neckline is very high.
3.0,It is nice just looks chesper then it did in picture. Not at classy
3.0,"Although it took some time to get to us, my daughter really loves it. I looks just like the picture, just as she expected, and it actually fit her. She is 12 years old and absolutely loves it. she uses it whenever we go out on our family outing."
3.0,"This wallet doesn't fit a whole lot in it so I wouldn't recommend it for everyday use. It would pop open when I had about 4 cards in the slots, a few dollars (that really needed to be folded in half to fit in easily) a few coins in it. Then the piping would come loose and fall out of the edges. It's probably ideal to use as a clutch for evenings out vs. a daily-use wallet."
3.0,they show a little
3.0,it broke within 2 weeks
3.0,"So many user stated to order up. followed recommendations and it was so large, could not keep had to return didn't buy again because I thought the material fell cheap anyway. But so cute on the model."
3.0,The bottoms could have been made a little smaller and the top a little bigger. I am typically a size 2-4  or a size small.  I ordered a large based on the other reviews. There is too much of an opening in the top for a large busted women. I wear a 34D. The style is super cute and the color is great.  fortunately I am creative and will purchase extra swimsuit material or lace and make my own insert for the center
3.0,It’s very thin and runs really small.
3.0,"Liked the shirt, but not my style."
3.0,"The black one fell to pieces the first time I tried to wear it, but the brown one is holding so far."
3.0,It's cute but it didn't fit as expected. Maybe size up
3.0,"I bought these slippers because I've been having heel pain from either plantars fasciitis or back issues causing sciatica.  The Arch support is not as high or supportive as I'd hoped so I am disappointed.  Also, I've had the slipper slide off while going down my stairs almost causing me to fall.  They are good slippers but just not as supportive as I'd hoped.  I may go with Powerstep Slippers but they are around $60.  So, these are more affordable."
3.0,Cute but a few months later the seam started to unravel...you get what you pay for.
3.0,"I want to say this is doing its job, when I bought it and put it on, was a bit snug and now it slides up without a hassle. Can’t say for sure if it’s aided in me losing any fat in my arms...but I guess I’d have to keep wearing to figure that out."
3.0,"Better than the ones that just stick in the heel and end up stuck on something else by the end of the day, not doing their job.  But these feel weird in my shoe."
3.0,"Don't love the fabric, especially for the price. Not a nice breathable fabric like you want in socks. But look cool and young giftee loves them."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:5511a5c537cc143c5b170351f03e690b]] Not the best quality, very shiny, thin material.  Fit a tad too snug for me, hard to zip and hard to get the pants up over my butt.  I ordered a size medium which I tend to be in between sizes med and lar so guess and should have gotten a large.  Size up for comfort."
3.0,Too Expensive for the small pieces of colored cardboard.
3.0,"Beautiful earrings, and for the price I can't really complain. But after buying a different bran of leverback cubic zirconia earrings that are just stunning and well-made, I have only one gripe with these earrings.<br /><br />The dangle part is beautiful and crafted well, but the leverback part IS and just looks so cheap.<br /><br />It doesn't align properly so you either get a slight poke at the back of your ear or neck if you turn your head for any reason.<br /><br />Would I recommend these to a friend? Yes, but only if I knew they were bargain shopping over quality.<br /><br />Will I keep them? Yeah. They're still beautiful, I'm just going to replace the leverback with a nicer quality item from Michael's Craft Store or something like that.<br /><br />Hope this helps!"
3.0,"The top is huge so in less you have big teeth don’t buy , but the bottom his easy and good looking to wear"
3.0,"The bag is nice but it's too small and not wide enough. Actually, it looks a bit larger on the picture than in person."
3.0,Did not care for this mask because it was nylon
3.0,Fit is very odd. Definitely size up.
3.0,"Smaller than I thought they would be, so I gave them as gifts!"
3.0,"It's a great product and it looks nice, but the clock doesn't work..."
3.0,cute. good quality. fits tight.
3.0,"Like some others, I was imagining a slightly warmer pair of pajama pants than the silky pair i received, but I don't dock them for that. My biggest issue with these pants is that they run rather small - while the waist band fits my middle well enough, they hug my backside and crotch rather snugly. I don't want my pajama pants giving me wedgies. Your mileage may vary.  I did like the flare, though, and the pattern was vivid. Maybe pictures of models in the products would help the marketing of these to the right people - for me, they missed the mark."
3.0,Bought for grandson for dress up . Cute
3.0,"I order one for my girlfriend and she had about a week before the watch part came off the holder. Over all it looks good, and should be fine to wear once in a while."
3.0,Ankle too small
3.0,This mask is not for kids doesn’t work for my 5 year old and to small for my 12 year old
3.0,"The pendant is lovely, just as pictured, but there really is no sound unless you hold it to your ear and shake it vigorously."
3.0,"I want to love these “butt”.....<br />Great material… Makes your butt look fabulous!!  LOVE the rubberized  stay up waist band… 150 lbs/ 5’7 fit Sze L fit well<br />But two issues (that I’ve seen others mention) had me returning these. First, for me, the rise /waistband is just too low. (That in itself would be okay, but I have to really watch bending over) Unfortunately because  of the low rise, i’m forced to hike them up to cover the crack ...resulting in major major camel toe-there is no gusset in the crotch so ....ugh. The second issue for me is they are too loose and wrinkly in the ankles (skinny ankles..but I don’t have this problem with almost all other leggings ) also stitching began to unravel and I only wore them once.<br />They are absolutely wonderful otherwise. Please make a high-rise version with a gusseted crotch and tighter ankles!! Thanks"
3.0,Those sizes are not actual. I gave it away to my daughter.
3.0,I read the reviews saying this top ran small and since I'm usually between a small and medium I ordered the medium but it was still too small. It fits but it's very tight in the armpit. Otherwise it's a nice top but the sizing is way off.
3.0,It’s is comfortable and stretchy but slightly see-thru.
3.0,Not exactly in love with this dress. I’d say it runs small. I didn’t notice that the chiffon part of the dress goes to your feet while the non-see through fabric under it only goes to your knees or so. I preferred both layers go to my feet. The top of the dress is a little uncomfortable because in my opinion it runs small. I’m hoping that if I continue to lose weight I’ll like the way it fits.
3.0,"I would have given this item a five star rating, but the first time my daughter wore it to dance class, I noticed a tear on the seam and it was too late to change her. I took it to the dry cleaners to get sewn properly, because I didn't want to have to deal with returning it. Also, this is the second one I have purchased, the first one was white and we needed it for a recital in a few days. It had some light black spots on the front. I think it may have been ink from the price tag, which is black. I have washed it a couple times with rubbing alcohol, on the spot, and now we can barely see it. I expect better from Capezio. They are my favorite dance wear company."
3.0,"This Ridgerock folding duffle bag is large enough to hold everything you’d want for a weekend trip or to stash in luggage when you anticipate a need for extra cargo space for things you’ve acquired on a trip.  Folded, this bag is less than a foot square and under an inch thick, but, unfolded, it doubles in length and stands about a foot high.  Plenty of room in this ripstock duffle bag with two pockets on the outside and a roomy interior..<br /><br />Returning the open duffle to its original smaller size is easy. Smooth the bag flat to match the pocketed side.  Fold the side in half and zip the folded edges together.<br /><br />Although the design of this back is excellent, I have concerns about the construction.  I have found many missed stitches and about two dozen threads with loose ends.  Before taking this bag out for a trip, I would need to restitch the bag, backstitching seams.  Without this restitching, I suspect that the bag could well come apart during heavy use.<br /><br />Three Stars<br /><br />Sample provided for unbiased review."
3.0,Would spend a little more for better quality. Large did fit my too well after I do not have that big of a hand.
3.0,The button was missing on this item. Flying out in a few days for a mountain hiking trip and now have to find another pair of pants.<br /><br />Edit: I had my local dry cleaner add a button.  Changed from 1 star to 3 stars.  Let's see how they do on the mountain. ⛰
3.0,When I purchased these I was expecting something a lot thicker but these are like shear tights. They are definitely not kid friendly and snag very easily
3.0,"Fit is fine, but material is too coarse for my likes."
3.0,"This is a beautiful bag, and suited my needs perfectly for the 3 months that I've had it. Unfortunately, there seems to be one important flaw-- the studs on either side of flap, which hold the bag closed, easily come unscrewed. I had discovered they were loose and tightened them a couple of times, but the other day I didn't catch them in time and one of the clasps/studs fell off entirely and is lost. I'm quite disappointed, because until I try to get this bag fixed and hunt down the right sized stud, I won't be able to use the bag. If I had known it would fall apart so soon, I would not have purchased this bag, pretty as it is."
3.0,Loose fit but not nearly as long as pictured
3.0,I loved these glasses however; they didn't look good on me.  They are too big for my face.  I returned them.
3.0,It was a gift to my daughter from her children. She wore it on mother's day and Monday the  August birthstone fell out. I'm so upset and embarrassed because I helped them pick it out.
3.0,It is very light-weight material- kind of like a nylon spandex- not at all what I think of when I think of a hoodie. Otherwise it is fine- It is only warm enough to wear like a light sweater.
3.0,"I've bought two of this style before, this is the first where the skirt fabric was shimmery and thinner instead of the more cotton feel.<br /><br />One of the pockets was also completely open because they didn't match the pattern pieces together when the serged it closed.<br /><br />Overall good for the price, but just watch you might have a few DIY fixes to get it perfect."
3.0,"I went to wear my dress Sunday and thought, &#34;This is fitting weird.&#34; I took the dress off and there it was, it was sewn improperly. Take a look. I like the few items I've purchased under this brand. Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful dress, especially if it was sewn properly. This was a disappointment."
3.0,Band to bracket was dry and broke when I tried to put it on.<br />Had to replace the band with a stronger cord
3.0,Fabric looks like a shiny silk
3.0,"I wanted to love these sandals so much because they are so simple and pretty. Unfortunately, they run so small!  I wear a womens size 10M or 11M, depending on how the shoe is made, so I ordered the 11M...After trying them on and attempting to walk for a few minutes, it was clear that I would have needed a 12M in this, as it was too short at my heel AND extremely tight across the top of my foot.  Thankfully, they fit my daughter, who wears a size 9M.  Aside from the fit, they are very flat, there is really nothing to them, so if you need cushion or support at all, these will not be the sandals for you.  All of that being said, if you can handle no support and the fit issue, then order away, because these really are super cute sandals!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in return for an honest, unbiased review.  This discount did not impact my rating or review in any way.  If you find this feedback helpful at all, please let me know!"
3.0,It's slightly higher quality than something you would win with $40- worth of Skee-ball tickets at an arcade.<br />Great for halloween :)  Not by itself.
3.0,quality is good but sizing is off a little.
3.0,"love the selection of colors, I wish I would have read the reviews about the size - I ordered 6 for a group and they are all too big. Silk screened them before we put them on."
3.0,"I LOVED this top the first time I wore it! So cute…but I washed it, and didn’t even stick it in the dryer, I air dried it and it STILL got significantly shorter. It doesn’t look the same and now it’s not a lot longer than a crop top."
3.0,Its ok. I was hoping it would be more lightweight and comfortable. I was also hoping it would fit throughout my whole pregnancy but it only fit for the first trimester. I should have ordered a size up possibly.
3.0,The bands do NOT lock into place well. Band could be wider with 44mm watches.
3.0,"I think this band is very nice and comfortable.  However, one of the three elastic bands has already broke and its only been a month.  So bummed"
3.0,Left a pink stain on my pillow case.
3.0,It's acceptable for the price.
3.0,I love the fit. Soft material. Only thing I was surprised was the color. I was looking forward to pretty rainbow starburst design that was pictured.<br />The color I got was ok so I will keep and enjoy.
3.0,"So, the material isn't a nice cotton like you would expect, but it's not terrible either.  The fit would have been just fine, except for the ruffling in the front goes too high.  I am not a prude and not all legs.  It genuinely provides a peekaboo to the vajay.  Would work over leggings, but that's not why I bought it.  Returned."
3.0,Great to wear as a house dress to to the pool. Not out in public more than once...
3.0,Makes your hips looks big
3.0,Didn't really expect the material to be what it is for a Khaki style pants but overall i do like these.
3.0,"It's a very thin ring, not as thick as it appears in pictures. It's a double layer of silicone which is flexible and comfortable. My main concern is durability, it's thin silicone and if I catch this on a nail or something its guaranteed to rip in half. I could literally tear it in half with my bare hands if so inclined. Designs are nice but so small it may as well just be slashes and it'll look the same. Not bad...but not very good either. Dealers choice on this one."
3.0,"This showed up and I was confused at first because it is very different from the picture. The color is more of a light baby blue and it seems a lot cheaper put together than it looks in the picture. Over all it is still very cute and I do like it so il keep it, however I was slightly disappointed in the quality."
3.0,"Well made but, runs small"
3.0,"This top is really cute, but the only thing I didn't like is that it's kind of shorter in the front and long in the back."
3.0,"I can't wear this because the lace part is 14 inches and my neck is about 12.5 but it seems well made and looks just like the picture. I saw that the description said 14 inches and I assumed that meant a maximum, like it usually does, but it was a MINIMUM of 14. I am careful when I buy things and this simply was not made clear in any way. It was not worth it to return the item but it was a big disappointment as I purchased the matching bracelets as well. Now I have a very pretty set of lace jewelry that I am unable to wear.."
3.0,This strap is very short. When installed on 40mm watch the total length is 8-3/4
3.0,"Only one shoe worked correctly, only red and green lights on the other. Be gentle with the chargers. Still looked cute without the lights working so we kept them."
3.0,this is for 'show' only.......does not protect your ears...........I wear mine OVER my other headband.........sometimes around my neck.........it's getting to be a LONG Iowa winter............
3.0,They dont look like the photo. They just look like run of the mill sweat pants.
3.0,"I probably should have looked at the type of material, as it is a fully stretch type, not a loose lightweight cotton blend as I wanted. It's much bigger on top than it is on bottom, and clings more than I'd like. Kinda bummed but it will be a good cleaning/home workout top."
3.0,I like the size and the pockets but it is very flimsy nylon material
3.0,More of a medium than a large. Disappointed because I really liked the style but had to give to my daughter.
3.0,Size runs VERY small.  Will not fit.
3.0,"good support, warm slippers, overpriced"
3.0,"In addition to tending to run small in sizing, unlike other brands of pocket yoga shorts, these do not have the small, hidden waist pocket in which to put my car key fob. I really recommend buying a larger size than you usually purchase."
3.0,Very nice and easy to remove.
3.0,Got it as a present. It seems fine
3.0,I got an XL the bottoms fit good and very comfortable as for the top it was smaller and short.
3.0,These are very pretty but they fit tight. They are the perfect size for elementary school age children.
3.0,They are good quality for the price. Not comfy on my head
3.0,Loved the necklace but it smells like medal.  Took it to goodwill.
3.0,"I bought these on sale, and had a couple of things to say. The shaping is very flattering for men, which is a plus. The biggest problem I have with these is that they move around so much that you have to monitor them. More than a few times a day, I had to readjust due to a lack of coverage that caused slippage. I would advise looking elsewhere for comfortable, empowering underwear."
3.0,I’m going to keep the bands. The colors are nice and the material is soft and smooth. The one complaint I have is the band(s) itself doesn’t fit snuggly in the grooves of the Apple Watch. My watch is a 44m and I ordered the 42/44m. Other than that this is a good buy.
3.0,Straps are far too long and not adjustable. At some point I'll pull out my sewing machine and shorten them but for now they're unwearable.
3.0,I just didn’t like how the suit fit in the hips and it felt too short. Also did not like the fabric or construction of bra
3.0,This was smaller than I expected. And the material wasn’t very soft. I returned. Order a size or two up.
3.0,Not bad. But material is relatively poor
3.0,Material too heavy and thick
3.0,Straps don’t stay hooked. Some even rip off entire. Wire comes out. The black one and the gray one is the only one manufactured well. Great if your going on a trip.  Don’t expect many wears out or them.
3.0,"My kid wears size 4 in Adidas soccer cleats. The Dream Pairs size 4 is probably a size to size and a half too large. I kept the large pair for future and ordered a size smaller. These still fit a little large. I like that they can be worn inside school, but still provide good traction on grass"
3.0,My son is two and he will not fit in them much longer.  They are supposed to be till 4t.
3.0,"For around the house slippers, they're ok, At 1st, they're a bit tight but they loosen up after wearing. The faux fur ""padding"" is nice at 1st, but becomes matted quickly, so it doesn't help after awhile in cushioning. I like this style of slipper, but a bit more long lasting cushion would be nice."
3.0,They're ok and they fit fine.  Not especially cushioned but they're ok for light use around the house.
3.0,"I am 5'2, a curvy 135lb and typically a &#34;6&#34; therefore I ordered a large and it fits well. I MIGHT have been able to order a Med but Lg. will work (I am a 34c and the tops fits nice as well). Cons: the pattern i picked almost seems to make me look wider than I really am, suit came with a small fixable flaw...but still a flaw (see pic), patterns aren't lined up on the seems but that's alright for the price. Overall cute suit for the price! Hope this review helps someone decide!"
3.0,Loose & not fit on me...
3.0,"Received the hat with permanent fold marks on brim.  Bought the hat for an upcoming trip and realized the hat is not foldable without causing permanent fold marks.  Otherwise, the hat is cute and light weight, I'll still use it but just not for traveling."
3.0,"The support with this is not great, and my right breast slips out a bit often. I'm not a huge fan of the design overall, however it is very soft and I do use it. I'm an F cup, so there aren't a ton of options."
3.0,Not a good fit. Looked like a bag
3.0,It does NOT really look like this. Rose print on what I received was mutli-colored and roses were smaller than shown here. Material is cheap polyester and looks like a robe your grandma would have worn in the 80's. Black is more of a greyish brown.
3.0,"Good fit, delivered quickly, very good esthetics.  Material seems quite thin and of low quality.  It will be interesting to see how long it lasts.  For the price, though, it seems like a good deal."
3.0,"I wear an Apple size 4 solo loop. This band is size small but it dangles on my wrist. Way too large. Will need to use a wrist band to hold watch in place when exercising. If you are looking for a bright white like I am, this is the most perfect bright white. Looks very elegant against my gold stainless steel series 8 watch. Too bad about the sizing."
3.0,not tight enough. slips down so returned.
3.0,The bag is much smaller than I thought it would be and very stiff so not much can fit inside. The clasp on the chain handle broke on the first use. I sent it back.
3.0,"I liked the style and the fabric, however im 5'1 and the dress was too long for me, it was way bellow my knee half way down my leg so it was at was at an awkward length. if it were not for that i would have loved it even more."
3.0,"They're really cute, but they are capris not fitted at the ankle like the picture shows."
3.0,"I wish I would have gotten a smaller size, but its very cute and looks nice."
3.0,The battery that came with it did not work. And the lights wont turn on even when connected via USB cable (i did check the switch).
3.0,So so cute but the purple socks don’t match the gloves perfectly and it makes my brain hurt
3.0,"Bought for my daughter. This is a cute set, but the material is not what we expected. We expected it to be a cotton or cotton blend, but it feels more like polyester. It’s still cute, just not what we expected. Also, it is a tad bit see through, so you lost likely have to wear a shirt under the sweatshirt. My daughter still likes it and wears it often."
3.0,Order at least 3 sizes larger....ordered for a wedding. The wearer usually wears a 38 so that was ordered. Cannot even get the jacket on.<br />Would not recommend unless you can order 4 sizes and send 3 back
3.0,Fits husband fine.  Colors are definitely not as vibrant as pictured.  Very dull.
3.0,"Beautiful bag but the dimensions given on the product page are wrong. The bag is L 21&#34; x W 11&#34; x H 10&#34;, so about twice the length/size I expected it to be."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:6d5f9fe5a864f8f927804135c98149c9]] This babydoll lingerie is pretty cute. The material is nice and comfy. However, I don't like the lace material, I thought it was just not made very well around the V neck but maybe because I'm not quite busty as other ladies. This lingerie is definitely not a one size fits all. I am a 32B, have a 26 inch waist and 34 inch hips. It has a bra closure on the back but that was very loose so it didn't give me that push up effect I though my it would have like in the picture. I was most disappointed about that, I wanted a nice neckline. The straps are adjustable though for a better fit. The fabric is very thin and sheer which makes it a super sexy lingerie to wear if your have a nice bust. The front part of the thing is also sheer and the color matches the rest of the babydoll. The back part is adjustable for those who want to adjust it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-sexy, cute<br />-light material and comfy<br />-adjustable straps<br />-adjustable thing<br /><br />Cons:<br />-v neck not made very well<br />-bra closure was loose<br />-not one size fits all<br />-doesn't give you push up effect<br /><br />Overall, I think this babydoll lingerie is just okay.  The product wasn't to my expectations, it could have been better.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. In writing this review, no compensation for a positive review was provided. All reviews are based on my experiences and I will be offering my true thoughts on the product, my positives and negatives. Hope it helps!"
3.0,Product was very loose didn't look exactly like picture
3.0,"shows bright white, it's more like creame."
3.0,"Not sure what to make or think of the cardiac rhythm of A Fib on necklace, but that doesn't look like any NSR I have ever seen.  Wonder what that is suppose to mean."
3.0,"This does the job but it's not very attractive for an elderly patient. I feel like they need a bit more dignity. But if you're looking for a good quality product, this is just that."
3.0,"I love the way this belt looks, it's great for skirts and dresses, anything really. But sadly the first day I had it, it broke not once but 3 times within 4 hours. :( the links are so weak that you can bend them with your fingertips with little pressure. I feel like an elderly grandmother could even bend this metal with no effort. I snagged it just barely each time and it instantly came apart. Once, I just moved and it was enough pressure to bend it apart. I'm a tiny girl, 5'10 and I weight 120lbs and still it wouldn't hold when I leaned down. My only solution is to replace the weak pieces with stronger ones. I just wish they had initially used pieces that were stronger. It doesn't even cost much to do so, I have parts I bought for $1 that will hold up better. Kind of dissappointed in this belt. I will definitely still wear it once I replace all the parts, but it's definitely inconvinient."
3.0,This was purchased for my daughter to wear to school. Didn’t like the fact that as you inhale and exhale the mask moves at each breath.
3.0,"I am a size 8 (US) and I ordered a small. It fits technically on the first under layer. However, the outer layer sags or droops quite a bit. It is not form fitting like a small should fit or as pictured by the manufacturer. I would order an XS but unfortunately that is not a size option. I am disappointed because I like the theoretical style of it and the soft material. I ordered the army green and it is a little lighter than the manufacturer photo but still a very nice shade. I would order more colors if it fit like some of the other customer photos. However, some customer photos look way oversized as well. Seems inconsistent with quality... Probably need to do a 9-step BPS to get to the root cause..."
3.0,"The band is nice and well worth the money, but I ordered white and I received an off-white almost tan color. The package even states “off-white”."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:3434ecc76a1ba0d285fbe007667b12fe]] I have on a medium. I  am 5’5 and 136 lbs. The red color is lovely. The fabric is a thick polyester/spandex and it made me hot. The directions has do not iron but my steamer did not work. I used a regular iron and could not get all the wrinkles out without a lot of work.  The bodice had very odd dart placements on the chest area. The darts made me look/feel  lopsided.
3.0,"Love the beads, however I have a true wrap bracelet that wraps around the wrist like a snake and this does not. However I loved the colors and quality."
3.0,"This is perfect for my 10 month old, but not my 2 year old."
3.0,"We were very pleased that this item was shipped in a timely manner. The bracelet was very nice, however, the clasp broke after just a few uses."
3.0,"Product was too over welding , too much fabric and too big.  Ok for very cold climates but too much for my climate."
3.0,"The slippers look very comfy, but my husband I guess is going to need a bigger size..I got a size 12"
3.0,"I am 5’4’’ so these were a bit too short (hit above ankle). I decided to keep them because they are so comfortable and I liked the straight leg. Would buy again if you could make them about an inch or so longer, or have a bigger hem so they could be lengthened."
3.0,It was so itchy! Very cute but uncomfortable and it made a blister on my colalr bone from the rubbing.
3.0,"I purchased this Henri Maurice brand athletic shirt for my grandson who is average size for his age. The shirt runs a little smaller than expected The material (coolon/spandex creora) is similar the UA brand and is airy, lightweight and easily dried when wet which is what is expected. For kids who are in sports, gymnastics, etc., on a regular basis the price might be worth it. For everyday playwear, I don't see it.  Kids grow so quickly and unless they are really active they won't use it that much. I received a discount in return for my honest review."
3.0,I like the bracelet owe ear it is not the same as my other Alex  and  Ani bracelets this one the  Wire is very thin and it was also more expensive than my many others. Feels  flimsy. I will keep it though wish it came in regular gold color. Seems quality has gone down in the way it feels.
3.0,"I had to take off two stars for two reasons:<br />- The collar almost immediately became rippled and is now stuck this way, despite being plenty big for my head and never stretching it out.<br />- The fit is very boxy and feels almost cheap, and I own many cheaper shirts that fit and feel better<br /><br />Aside from these issues, its a fine shirt to wear around the house. It's 100% cotton and while it's not the finest thread, it's not uncomfortable. It's strong enough to do some light work in and perfectly fine to wear under a jacket but that's about the best I can say about it. It's fairly stiff and not form fitting in the slightest (which may not be a bad thing).<br /><br />I could've given this 4 stars easily if the collar issue didn't pop up, but since it did, I can't recommend this shirt when I've owned so many others that haven't had this issue."
3.0,"The color of these leggings is just beautiful!! Very bright. They have a white line on the side leg, but it is not super noticeable.<br />Fits true to size. I’m wearing my normal medium (135lbs, 5’5) and they fit great. The length is also perfect, hit right to my ankles. Super stretchy.<br />High rise.<br />They are medium compressive.<br />I took stars because even if they are comfortables, they are soft and the color is wonderful, they are see through! Definitely (at least this color) is not squat proof. And it shows every bump or cellulite.<br />It does not make CT, but it looks weird the front part...<br />I will be using them in my garage gym, but not in public."
3.0,"Super cute; however, If you have a butt or are 5'7"" and taller, this dress needs another inch or two for the length."
3.0,"As pictured, but the decal is too stiff. Longer than expected."
3.0,very cute but keep falling off. the lock is not very sturdy and has fallen off multiple times since i put these on my daughter.
3.0,Not too comfy as previous pr. several yr ago. Returning.
3.0,Bigger than I thought  they would be.
3.0,Just okay!!!!!!!
3.0,Gloves are kinda comber some. If you are planning on wearing them in colder weather they are not warm at all.
3.0,"See-through/thin fabric that I don't love, but it's fine for an around the house sweater."
3.0,"Just a giant swuare cloth, I was really disappointed with this item."
3.0,Size says 5 x 3 x  5.  This is not correct<br />..  it is 10 x 3 x 5.  It is a lot bigger than what I wanted.  But I am a big doctor who fan so will use it anyway.
3.0,"If you have a super small wrist than this is for you. I loved it, the look is good, but my wrist was just too big & I’m a smaller girl. Make sure to measure your wrist & it really should be for 4”, possibly 4 1/2”. Has a magnetic closure. I had to return mine unfortunately, but it’s really stylish."
3.0,the two straps at the top does not fit on your shoulder as what is pictured it falls off too the side but it works ill keep it! :)
3.0,Wasn't a fan of this suit.  Gave it to my sister.
3.0,I ordered extra small & received a medium.
3.0,It's soooooo huge it falls off my shoulders.
3.0,Bought it for my best friends birthday and she wore it for 2 days and it broke. Tried to return but I was told I had it for too long and they would not take it back. Oh well!
3.0,Not the softest material and really big at the bottom.
3.0,Much smaller then appears! Made very cheap!
3.0,"Definitely not silk... It's a cheap bow tie, and you won't get much more than you paid for. Stitching is poor and uneven, and it does not tie evenly, as the pattern is off center. But as I said, it's a $8 bow-tie. Don't expect it to compare with anything from a big name department store."
3.0,Bought two for both my Benz key fobs. Lost the little screw that holds the hook to the key in less then 2 months. Seems to just unscrew on its on while it’s on your belt loop. Love the design and product but I never got a response when I asked about the faulty screws.
3.0,Cute print but way too big and I ordered a small. It'll make a good swim cover-up!
3.0,It's a nice shirt. Looks about the price you paid for it. Zipper is on opposite side which is odd to wear. I suggest it but don't personally really like it
3.0,Cute but much brighter  red than expected.
3.0,"I love a good cropped top hoodie but this is WAYYY TOO CROPPED. IF I Were to go without an undershirt, you could see my boobs if I slightly lifted my arms."
3.0,"Bought these bracelets to gift to family members. They’re nice, but they came undone within days. Didn’t last long. So I guess you get what you paid for"
3.0,"The mermaid rings are cute, but turned my daughter's fingers green... obviously cheap metal, but I didn't expect more.  We put some clear mail polish on the inside & its perfect now.  All in all, okay purchase."
3.0,Watch looks like it should but strap is small for a man
3.0,Is cheap so it's not bad but won't last or look good for long. Very good at handling sweat but it's small. I have medium wrists but I nearly fit on the list hole.
3.0,"Without being overly graphic I don't like the pouch. Duluth Trading has the ""Bull Pin"" which is much more comfortable. The ""Joey Pouch"" has extra material in an already crowded place and it can rub you the wrong way. To each his own, but I find it less than comfortable.  As far as the branding goes?  5 out of 5  ROLL TIDE!"
3.0,"MY waists was 30 W but is was too tied ,so I have to return and exchanged for size 32 W."
3.0,very cute dress. sizing was good.
3.0,Heart pin is cute but very very small. Could have been larger. But still nice jus tiny. It will catch your eye but won't keep your eye.
3.0,Just so-so.  Had to launder as there was a funny smell.<br />The material is too stiff for me and the fit is on the small side.
3.0,"This package came in a sealed Amazon bag, but the package was open inside the bag. The material felt like polyester. Will probably be ok a kid is wearing them."
3.0,The big ring looks super fake but the band is beautiful
3.0,"After use, I notice that this gloves are hard to put on when sweaty hands and sweet on the gloves"
3.0,Hurt my front big toe.
3.0,"The dress is very pretty with slits on the side. However, the fit on the shoulders was much too boxy, making for a awkward fit on the chest area."
3.0,"Smaller than I would prefer, also the metallic finish on the straps peeled off."
3.0,Cheap quality shirt and weird fit. Don’t recommend.
3.0,I bought the pure black lace dress witha  cinched waist.  I bought a small and it fit. I am 5'6. But the cinched waist was too high.  I returned it to get another style.
3.0,"For ~$6, this is a great deal on a dress. I am 5'0"" and 120 lbs. I bought the XS. It's comfortable with soft fabric. It's pretty thin. You can't see through it, although if you stretch the fabric and there's light shining through, you can see through it but you wouldn't be doing that if you're just wearing it. It hits right below my knee. The sleeves are a little tight on my upper arms, but not uncomfortable. The sleeves are also a bit long so they bunch a bit but not so long that they're bothersome.<br /><br />The design on the front of the dress makes me look like I'm early in pregnancy. (I am not pregnant). This would probably be a great dress if you were pregnant though since there's plenty of space for a growing belly with the design/cut of the dress.<br /><br />Overall, worth it for $6 but I probably wouldn't spend much more on it. I wouldn't spend the $20 it costs for the other designs/colors."
3.0,"I was very disappointed with this product as the ball was so tiny, I lost one trying to open it and the other wouldn’t snap into place. The pictures show the size in comparison to a dime and standard tweezers. The stone is tiny but very colorful and would probably look very pretty as a piercing OTHER THAN the navel, which is why I bought it. If you have the proper piercing tools to assemble this, it’s a decent product for the money."
3.0,It was smaller than I anticipated. Wife thought the same. Got the oatmeal color. It was darker than the picture.
3.0,Picture makes the sweater seem longer. I ordered a size large and it does not go passed your bottom as displayed in the picture.
3.0,I used it for a face mask going out in public.  The ear holder broke on several of the mask even before putting them on.
3.0,Nice pouch and ring but I have a few very sharp edges that I need to file down.
3.0,"I like the camera strap, in general, but I'm ""not in love with it."" It's too short. From pictures of it, the strap dangles around the hip. It does no more than rest just under the arm."
3.0,"They are pretty, but not as nice as the picture here.  I can't wear them all the time due to their weight."
3.0,I like it but it broke within a couple of weeks
3.0,"I like the price of this Casio watch , and I primarily bought it because of the wristband ( my other one broke).<br />The wristband could be a little bit longer.  It doesn't fit comfortably on my wrist.  Other than that, I like the watch."
3.0,"It's cute, but I had to take two stars off because it's pretty flimsy and the latch is loose. It was really hard to snap in place. Cute though! I don't expect it to last long. But you get what you pay for."
3.0,"Kind of small, but otherwise good"
3.0,"More for fashion than a belt.  As other reviewers have mentioned, too wide for the lightweight elastic which makes the belt roll after a few uses. The clasp is easy enough to use and does lie flat."
3.0,Cute but not worth it my 5 month old has so much hair this were too thin on her head even though they look thick on the picture they're cute colors but also the bow moves around making it look not so cute i won't purchase again.
3.0,"Looks great, but it doesn't fit well. Not a one size fit all product."
3.0,"Awesome looking but the quality left me wanting.  The glasses arrived on time, but upon examing them, the frames were bent and after only two days of use, the plastic nose pieces became loose and one fell off.<br /><br />Since so many people love these glasses, I can't imagine that they are all that bad but maybe it was just the aviators."
3.0,"I'm super broad shouldered,  but flat chested (almost)  I'm about 5'10&#34; shirt was tight at the shoulders and wouldn't of fit in the chest if I had big ol boobies. I'm a small B cup.  Length wise was a little shorter than expected but still longer than a t shirt but not by much"
3.0,"Cheap plastic. I have a big head, so these break in about a week or two with heavy use."
3.0,Very very simple. Material is not high quality but you can kinda dress it up a little.
3.0,Each chain has broke in different places several times.
3.0,"too small, I had to give to my granddaughter"
3.0,I am very happy with my socks! However I am missing one out of the six I bought. I now have five pairs and one loner sock... seems a tad lazy. I’m not sure if I’ll buy from this seller again.
3.0,Good👌
3.0,This is a beautiful cover up which I've gotten compliments on.  I found it personally HUGE to the point it swallowed my petite frame. Wish it had a tie on the waist and that would improve it.
3.0,very thin and light weight.  not as nice as expected.  did not give as gift as planned
3.0,"Necklace doesn't lay flat, but when it does it looks ok."
3.0,A little see through so make sure you get the right size.
3.0,My son normally wears a 26 or 28 in TYR and Speedo... this was much too large for him.
3.0,I love the shirts funny quip. However it fits almost like a moo moo lol.
3.0,I give these a 3 because the comfortability is definitely there but they run small in size. They fit about 1 size smaller than in description!
3.0,colors not as vivid as in the picture .. like this model of the g-shock very popular right now .. band feels a lot cheaper than other g-shocks
3.0,It would'be been a cute hate like on the photo shown-however it arrived completely bent and out of shape. Brim of hat was bent in 3 places. Complete waste of money.  Too late to return.  Hopefully if you decide to buy the product you will have better luck than me.
3.0,Looks great but it’s bent. Does not sit level but still looks good. Trying to hear it up to reshape it.
3.0,"These shoes were very stiff initially, but after wearing them for a few weeks they became very comfortable. The only problem with the white ones is that they don't stay white. Once they get a bit of dirt and stains, they look really ratty."
3.0,I loved the look of these for the first few weeks. Small and danty. I ordered the rose gold but after a few weeks they have tarnished to a fadded gold and silver. The stone has also become foggy.
3.0,I ordered size L but received in size XL
3.0,"Was so excited to buy this, however it is much larger than I expected. I thought it was going to be a cute simple piece, but it takes up most of my cartilage. Also, since it is bigger than I imagined and the bar is a little long it keeps spinning rather than resting in the helix of my ear.<br /><br />Overall the quality seems fine, just more guady than expected especially compared to the sillohouette figure shown for the product."
3.0,"Mine was very dull looking compared to the picture. It looked like it was stored in sawdust. It fits ok but it definitely stretches out after about 2 weeks. I got this one because I thought it was pretty, but there’s simpler, cheaper ones that last longer."
3.0,"Picked the wrong size. I recommend the product itself, but I can’t return it as I’ve opened and tried it on. Wasted money basically."
3.0,One of these sets of earrings the earrings are HUGE. Did not expect that. Maybe not a problem for some but likely they won’t be worn.
3.0,"One small tab of metal was not bent enough to hold the necklace together. It didn't break when I adjusted it; so that's good. The separate pieces didn't fit together very well. These were pieces held with a metal tab, and the angle of the necklace pulled it out of shape a bit.<br />Still a very beautiful necklace."
3.0,"Cute dress but was too small for me. Order 1-2 sizes up. Especially order up if you are heavy chested. Wish that it worked out to me, but not the best suited for my body type!"
3.0,Did not fit the same as other shoes in the same brand and style. I order a size up from my normal and in this style it usually fits. These were significantly bigger. Love the color
3.0,"I ordered these in the size my boyfriend always wears. They are a Christmas present! They look super small, but he hasn't tried them on yet!! Also, appear to be cheap quality, but he will wear them once and ruin them anyways."
3.0,LOST THERE STRECH WITH LITTLE USE IN 2 YEARS.<br />SO SAD TOO BAD
3.0,"I have poor circulation in my feet.  I had hoped that these socks were going to be a total remedy for the problem.  I would rather buy socks than medication!  However, I have not experienced the relief that I expected.  I have not worn one pair, and if the UPS man who delivers to our home has feet the proper size, I will gift a pair for his poor frozen feet......hopefully it'll work better for him."
3.0,"I ordered a small but when I received it, it was too large and long I'm 5ft 6"" I never really had problems with dress length so I don't know what happened to this one that I ordered. I gave it to my mom... Couldn't bother to return it"
3.0,"It's very pretty.<br />But at the shortest possible length I can adjust it to, it's almost below my boobs!!<br />I was looking more for a choker."
3.0,The collar was beautiful and fit well but the rings and bracelet come apart before the night was over.
3.0,Runs about 2 sizes to small. And is short
3.0,"I like the fit, the color, fabric and style. I just never expected it to be so itchy. The pits are a little small and wherever there is a seam it tends to be quite itchy :/ I can’t wear it for more than a lunch date or some other such short outing. XL mustard"
3.0,They were a little tight and not to stretchy. Cute though. I had to return them from seem separating
3.0,"This fabric is stiff (feels starched) and the color is off from what is shown. The fit is nice and comfy, but not the feel."
3.0,"So cute, but so itchy"
3.0,For skinny people.
3.0,I recently received this product and I give it a 3 star rating. It is plastic and had it a day and it already had a crack but the crack isnt really noticeable. I mostly got it for Halloween cause the lights are cool. Plus if you are wearing it at night you wont see the tiny crack in the plastic
3.0,"Like the title says, it’s not very sturdy. I touched it up with some paint, and I stuffed it with T-shirts, and the front end of a tactical airsoft helmet mask. I just got it today, and I’m gonna let it sit for a few days to see how it sets up. Hopefully it comes out OK. Also, it really stinks like bad Chinese plastic! Lol"
3.0,too big but look fine :)
3.0,"Exterior is great but the interior pockets are really weak, I shredded the pocket on the second compartment the first week I had it. The external fabric is strong and durable."
3.0,I used mostly at work hat was small but neck warmer l liked
3.0,"The top is a little more snow than described, and it's a lot shorter than in the picture"
3.0,"Disappointed totally,dress looks as cheap as it was,,totally wrinkled,looked deodorant stained under one arm area,too much of a headache to return"
3.0,It fits weird . When you see it on ot looks good. as soon as they walk it starts looking weird
3.0,"The fit is more narrow in the torso than expected. I ordered a men medium. It's just not a comfortable t-shirt, which is unfortunate because it's pretty cool looking."
3.0,The product was cute as pictured but my daughter's foot was too chubby to fit inside them. Foot would have to be really skinny.
3.0,"I like the bra, the lift is great, but the straps are way too small, they dig into my shoulders and hurt after 30min of wearing it."
3.0,"I read some reviews advancing to size up because it was small, so I did, and I ended up with a s*** two sizes bigger than I needed. I guess it depends on your body proportions. Also this blouse is not all that pretty in person but I will definitely wear it sometime"
3.0,"It’s very short and boxy. It didn’t hug my frame at all. I should have sized down. I got a size medium, I’m a C cup, 5’3 and 110lbs. It’s definitely stretchy and comfortable though! If it had fit better it would be 5 stars! I hope this helps someone! I always buy things on sale with no reviews!"
3.0,"I got this with the black necklace, after a few weeks , my necklace has lost the black color to it and stained my neck. Also I'm not too find of the big letters in the back , as I wanted to engrave each one but it would just look to messy and cluttered. Would  not reoder"
3.0,"the design is adorable.<br />the material is slightly rough until several washings with lots of fabric softener.<br />its that sturdier but slightly less comfy material that doesnt stretch as much…and material varies from color to color.<br />sizing (I got 3 in total - different sizes and colors)…slightly small on the width but really long.<br />Navy & Pink were least soft and Purple was slightly thinner and softer material.<br />I got them in 1X, 2X, and 3X.<br />If you don't have sensitive skin, then get them - the baby rhino is completely adorable and the iron on seems to be of good quality for what it is."
3.0,"Overall these shades are fine, but I do have a few notes:<br /><br />1) They are very dark. I have a digital center console and during the day, I have to peek over/under the glasses to see the time/station.<br /><br />2) The lenses seem very cheap and can easily pop out from just cleaning them, so watch out for that.<br /><br />3) The  frame seems well built, but I had an issue where I almost lost the screw connecting the end pieces to the frame. I looked up and saw the screw sticking up and grabbed it just in time before it broke apart. but screwed back on just fine.<br /><br />That said, they're stylish, comfortable, and certainly better than any gas station glasses you'll find."
3.0,Hat has a cheap look and feel to it.  Wouldn't buy again.
3.0,WAY too tight.  I suggest getting one size higher that their measurements suggest.
3.0,"Item appears well made, but beware trying to adjust the length.  Time was Speidel made the process quick, simple and easy.  Obviously, they’ve “improved” the design and now it’ll drive you to drink getting the job done.  Otherwise, a good product."
3.0,"I got this watch and am a little confused. The description on the product page says &#34;30M Waterproof, you can swim with it&#34;. However, the instructions that came with it say: If &#34;Water Resistant&#34; is inscribed on the case back, your watch is designed... to withstand ... accidental contact with splashes of water or rain, but it is not intended for swimming or diving&#34;. Mine says  &#34;Water Resistana (yeah, just like that) 30M. So, is it waterproof or not really?<br />The clasp is definitely poorly designed and hard to deal with and the hour indicator could be bigger. Also, the minute marks could be a little less subtle and easier to see. With all that said, it's still very pretty as the lack of some functionalities make it for a very clean design, lol.<br />I might keep it - but living in Miami, I really wanted to know if I can swim with it..."
3.0,Love the case and the pattern.  Only thing is the camera opening is a little too close to the flash so it reflects. I had to file it down with scissors and it is good to go!
3.0,"It was a little hard to tell the design of the shirt once I got it in person. I wound up returning it. But lovely concept, it made me laugh, but no one else could tell what it was."
3.0,"These slippers are comfortable except for the heal. That is where the lace is pushing into the inside part of the slipper. I got blisters on both heels just in the first few minutes of wearing them. I put some moleskin across the area that was bothering me, but it doesn't seem to help. If I can't get these things to stop rubbing my heels, I will have to send them back.  :("
3.0,"These are really tight to fit on my 3 year old. Nit very soft either. I do like that they come really high, that's hard to find. Wish they had more give to them."
3.0,"I love the approach, the minimalism, and the size. But the printing of the minute lines is weak, and so I regretfully returned it."
3.0,"It’s not that there’s anything wrong with these earrings, but they should have chosen a photo that actually reflected the material being used: stainless steel. The items shown have a highly reflective chrome finish, which is not at all what these earrings are. These have a matte finish, which is standard for stainless steel. I don’t like misrepresentation, so that pretty much puts it at three stars for me. These are nice stainless steel earrings, and my photo much more accurately represents what they look like in real life. Because I was looking for something very shiny, this didn’t suit my needs. I already have plenty of earrings that look like this."
3.0,"I measured my sons feet but i guess the shoes are more narrow which means we need extra room. I was really thrown off by the size chart. However the shoes are fun and whimsical. I think the placement of cable was a tad erroneous. I would love to see a manufacturer in the states just bring out a top notch product like this. However, despite the hiccups the shoe would have rocked if they had fit."
3.0,Very fuzzy and exact material I was looking for but I bought xl for my husband and it fit my 12 year old daughter.  Oh and she is a skinny girl to big at all.
3.0,"I'm 5'5, 190lbs, usually XL/16. I ordered an XL because the sizings looked alright. The waist sizing was fine but the top was too small, and no hip measurement was provided but the hips were way way way too small. I almost couldn't get it on.<br />My notes about this dress:<br />Looks almost exactly as pictured, but it's definitely ivory and not white.<br />Very long, I did not try it with heels but they were definitely needed, and even then I might've had to hold it up.<br />The top cups are toooo small (36D), but you can make them work if you wear the dress as lingerie. It does not work as a going-out dress, at least not for me.<br />The bottom was tight and restricting, just too small and not comfortable.<br />It was cute, I did want to like it, but ultimately am returning it as it does not fit."
3.0,I like these pjs but the material is super weird and thick. I'm not sure I'd buy them again. They are kind of bulky.
3.0,My wife liked it but it was too large for her so we returned it in exchange for a smaller size which ended up perfect.
3.0,it was just a little small for me
3.0,I just gave 3 star becuase my hair gets strangled to the necklace.
3.0,Nice dress great for spring and summer. Light weight and pretty.
3.0,"Half didn't work. But, still a great price for even half of them working."
3.0,you can call the fit fitted or slim... like it but may send back to get a medium incase I gain weight.
3.0,"Love the necklace but the false advertising of it glowing is a breech of integrity. I've charged it with all types of lights but no go. So, due to false advertising, 3 stars"
3.0,Buy one size up.
3.0,the bottoms are too thick and the top rides up!
3.0,Top is a wrap and so low you couldn't wear a bra without pinning front. Also material is very sheer/see through
3.0,"The dress is light weight, flowy and a good length. Color matched but this is th second time ordering this dress and both times I received a dress with a different neckline. Both times I received thick straps and a higher v cut. I purchased this dress with Th intentions to use in the house for breastfeeding. I wanted the extra length in the straps and arm pit area for easier access without stretching the material out of shape. I’m disappointed. I tried ordering two different colors; first th dark green, secondly the bright blue after asking other customers which colors they purchased to receive th deep V, still the stores delivery was unsatisfactory. Bought a medium both times"
3.0,This looks good and sexy. It’s cheap material and won’t last. Just ok.
3.0,"Love the dress, fit and look........but it snags very easily.  Wore a beaded necklace and it left the dress fuzzy. Where the dress brushed our table it left a fuzzy area.  Wore it once, but can't wear it again."
3.0,The fabric is a little thin and it fits a little tight but it will work for my Halloween costume and that's what I wanted it for.
3.0,Jacket fits tight in the arms. Sewed wrong
3.0,"Although I do love the appearance of it, the sizing is very off. The US conversions they list are not accurate at all. The seller was pleasant to work with but would not buy here again due to the sizing."
3.0,"shirt is quite large, even after washing, and material, while it says 100% cotton, is on heavy side. So cannot really rate this well until after I have worn it in Florida heat. But I love the color!"
3.0,low raise on the back but i like it
3.0,"Although I think these look exactly like the photo, they are a cheaper priced shoe and you can tell in the fit, not so much in the appearance. They look cute but the sole is cheap and probably will not hold up in any type of moisture. Stylish for the price though and pretty comfortable. If they hold up for 2 seasons of wear, I will be happy."
3.0,It's very pretty on and made with a cottony stretchy material that is very thin and airy. It's opaque. My only problem is that the stitching is done very poorly on mine in some parts.
3.0,Wish the other side was finished
3.0,"I'm a little disappointed as I thought the material would be stainless steel and it's not, it's cute l but it still burns to leave in."
3.0,This jean crop pants are not true to size.  They fit in the waist and butt  but not in the seat area.  There was extra material that took away from the look.  It was not made to fit a woman's curves in the thigh area.  also unless you were only wearing the crops pants rolled up it was too long for wearing it down.
3.0,These pajamas are cute and very comfortable EXCEPT for the waist band. It is elastic but is much too tight. I usually wear a medium but ordered a large for roominess. The waistband unfortunately is far too tight even as a size larger that what I wear.
3.0,"It doesnt grip well on the cuff of my ears, but I dont have normal ears. They work on most people i know."
3.0,feels pretty cheap. its ok for the price
3.0,"The color, and heart shape is really cute, but the bar is way too short."
3.0,"I really like the quality of these darling little crowns.  They are made of a sturdier material than I expected.  However, they come with tacky ribbons to tie on your head...Unfortunately I didn't not open them before the party to know this.  IF they had come with an elastic stretchy string, they would have been usable, wearable, and perfect.  (Which if I would have known I could have purchased before hand and they would have been exactly what I was looking for.)  Unfortunately not having a proper way to secure them that would last more than a minute, made them a sad waste of money and more a table display than a fun party hat for littles.  Fix this mistake and they are perfect!!"
3.0,Nice enough dress and it is lined and pretty well made.The only thing I don’t like about it is the back zipper is impossible to zip.Maybe it will zip if I had help.Runs Small
3.0,"Most of the reviews I saw on this product weren’t in its favor, but with my experience the glasses showed up in perfect condition. The material is obviously going to be cheap. But it’s really not bad I kinda love them. They make me feel like I’m back in Orange County  in the early 2000s"
3.0,The only thing I didn't like is that they broke putting them on
3.0,"I really like, the only ting it is a little tight in the arms. I just wear a vest over it."
3.0,"Do not go by measurements.<br />I measured as it instructed me to, they are way to big which allows the elastic fold up"
3.0,"Loved this purse when I first got it.  Plenty of room for keys, phone, small wallet, and a few other essentials.  Also love the cognac color.  Unfortunately, the side strap broke after about 3 months of use."
3.0,"You get what you pay for, broke easily."
3.0,"First it's not a ""shell"". It's a rain coat or windbreaker depending on how the waterproofing is. I needed a shell so I returned it without any testing. Also, it's loud. I wouldn't recommend it for hunting. If you're looking a windbreaker for everyday wear, i'd say 5 stars. If you're looking for a shell for hunting purposes, 0 stars."
3.0,Cute but sleeves were short.
3.0,What I did receive was okay the piercing has to be pushed then screwed took me forever to attempt screwing in the tiny balls so I settled for the spike one if you want the diamond styled one don’t buy
3.0,Could have used a size bigger. I wear a 12 so I ordered a large but it’s snug.
3.0,Wasn't baggy enough to fall off the shoulder and I ordered a 4x (normal size 2x) jus to be sure it did hang and it didnt...cute top jus not for plus size women!
3.0,I ordered the Large size and they are still small. Im size 6-8.<br />Disappointing since I liked them so much and they dont have a bigger size :(
3.0,will wear it as a nightgown
3.0,"I like it,Cheap but you get what you pay for here."
3.0,"Not a true fit, and runs very small.<br />I ordered an extra large, but unfortunately could not even put them on without hearing the stitching ripping.<br />They are design to help control the stomach area and help lift the glutes, and even though I couldn't try it on, it appears they would help both of these areas."
3.0,I ordered a large and it was super tight on the chest so I traded it for an xlarge and it's too big everywhere. Also the polka dots are FAR bigger then they seem in the description photos.
3.0,Not well made. Sizes not well specified.
3.0,Nice but to short in the back.  Not what I was expecting.
3.0,"The bag looked nice and arrived on time. However, it came with a terrible terrible smell of a cross between a nursing home and moth balls. I Had hope that it would air out but after a week I could not take it anymore. It’s currently outside as it was making my house smell.<br />Not worth the time and possible destruction of items. I now have to replace the wallet in my purse along with other things as they smell too bad to use."
3.0,"The underneath of the material part of the shoe is very rough.  The tops of my feet were rubbed raw in some parts after wearing them for a couple of hours. They didn't have the level of comfort I expected from a shoe that was in this price range.  However, these shoes have wonderful arch supports for a flip flop!"
3.0,It is way way smaller than in the picture
3.0,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas to go with his new boots. It looked like a pretty neat concept and was a little different than the ordinary boot jacks I'd looked at. The problem arose after he had removed the first boot and put his stocking-foot on the metal loop to hold the remover in place so he could remove his other boot. Ouch! The wrought iron was not barefoot-friendly!  So, I would say it's a great item for removing A boot, but not BOTH boots. Any suggestions?"
3.0,"They run two sizes to small, in my experience. Having difficulty returning them. I didn't receive a response when i notified Amazon about my issue with returning them."
3.0,"The purple is the same as the picture, I ordered one size larger based on reviews and am glad I did (typically a juniors 7/M or women's 4/S and ordered the L), however for a $50 coat, I expect it to be free of defects!  I had to trim loose threads in multiple places and the right pocket has a hole in the shape of a triangle that looks to have been cut, not ripped.  This a gift so I don't have time for a return but shouldn't have to repair a brand new item.  Now I'm concerned about the quality and how it will hold up to regular wear."
3.0,friend liked it.  Ordered for a friend who doesn't use Amazon.  He said he liked it.
3.0,"a little too big(not bad tho), good quality hat, design is amazing."
3.0,Fits as expected. Looks like the picture I would purchase again I ordered the largest one and it fit both my girls who are a chunky ages 7 and 10
3.0,I figured being white this sweater would be slightly see through so I ordered a size up so that it'd be kind of loose. Good thing I did because it just fits! The sleeves are too short though. Nice material and fits well otherwise. Ordering my size would have definitely been too small. If I knew I probably would have gone two sizes up to get the loose fit I was originally hoping for.
3.0,Received mirrored glasses instead of the ones shown. Nice lightweight frame. Lenses are a little small. Very dark so that's a plus.
3.0,"A little too much cushioning around the ankle that makes them somewhat less comfortable than the TR-101s.  If you're just getting introduced to a pair of minimalist boots, these are probably your best choice.  Ultra-lightweight, durable, and comfortable out of the box.  Get the TR101s if you're used to minimalist footwear."
3.0,"So the socks are super comfortable and I really thought I liked them. They feel good on your feet. However, the socks wear out like nothing I’ve ever seen before. I almost never get a hole in my sock yet these socks get holes in them when I blink. They are shaped nicely I like that it’s two layers but they just don’t last at all."
3.0,It is good looking and has a nice feel to it. I bought the small and it was almost like a dress for me. I understand this is a shawl.
3.0,"It arrived and the zipper wasn't functional so I had to play around with them for a little while. Fixed it, but a few zips later it popped off the track again and wasn't sealing anything. We will likely make it work, but not ideal."
3.0,"The box and rose are pretty, and my wife of 30 years understood the strange messaging, but it is obviously a job of poor translation. To my best companion is the message on the box. A friend is a true companion is the message on the gift bag. Seriously it strikes me as an attempt for Chinese makers to translate something to English. Guess they just cant print something simple like I Love You.  Otherwise, it's a nice token gift. Great for Valentines. I would not get this as an anniversary gift, it's not that well made and the message is obviously off the mark by a long ways"
3.0,"Retainer, clicker and hoop all fit fine but the horseshoes are all really tiny width wise. Wouldn’t recommend unless you have a small nose."
3.0,They were OK just wasn’t made as good as I thought they would be
3.0,"I love the stretchy fabric of this bra - it's nice & cool in the summer, and with the long line of it, can function as a cropped tank.  However, the straps are long and are not adjustable at all!  With that in mind, I don't think the bra is worth it at this price point.  It does fit around my chest well, even being at a 34DDD, but it moved up and forward over the course of the day.  The black mesh trim is pretty, but takes away from the functionality because mesh just isn't a supportive fabric.  At the time I purchased, I was very busy, or else I would have returned because it's just not comfortable with how much give there is with the straps (I fall out of it because the back rides up).  It may be suitable (if it fits) for something like yoga, but jogging/running is out of the question in it."
3.0,I have 1 yo twins and requested 2 of them. One came as was already washed and used. I was very disappointed. The small size said looks ok for 1-3 yo are just exact x my littles 1 yo babies. Will need soon to buy new medium size. Overall have a very good quality. 100% cotton and soft material that is perfect.
3.0,"Uncomfortable, looked cheap.  Sent back."
3.0,"Gave 3 stars because the balls are bigger than I expected, come loose easily, and are def not as glittery and opaque as the product picture. I still do like the look of the jewelry, and even though it wasn't as glittery as expected, it still has a pretty look to it. It also fits my lip perfectly for my vertical labret. All in all you get what you pay for, and these were worth the price!"
3.0,Loved the dress but it was too tight around the bust area. I am an average size but it was still to tight on top
3.0,"The size chart in the photos is confusing as it doesn't tell you explicitly where to measure length from. I now see in the description that there is a recommendation based on height. At 5'7"" my daughter is at the top end for XL. We ordered an XL and it is too small. Right on the edge of too short and tight in the thighs. She is slim but not a stick - she dances so actually has leg muscle. We have to return and there is no XXL option. Too bad..."
3.0,"They are ok. Look perfect when you wear them for the first time but for some reason get bigger and super loose in the top part. I don’t wear them to the gym with crop tops because it just looks funny. I still wear them around the hous because they’re comfy. I usually wear small and this is the size I ordered, run way too big for me! And no compression either."
3.0,Nice style. Not a fan of the fabric. A bit longer than expected. Love pattern.
3.0,"Great case and doubles as a mirror on the shiny side.  The case is beautiful, however, it is easy to bend out of shape after I dropped the phone and the small hooks on the top and bottom now do not clasp as well.  They pop open from time to time which is annoying... I may order the case again just because I love the flexibility of using it as a mirror."
3.0,"I got in my usual size, large, and it runs large. Stretchy fabric"
3.0,The waist and legs were very snug but the tummy - where I need the control - was very soft and flexible. No real support.
3.0,no me gusto mucho pero me quede con ellas
3.0,Ordered bug and it is still tight
3.0,I like the color and style. I always order 2X on the net but this time this Tunic runs small  if you want  the flowy look order one size up.
3.0,Cute but VERY small
3.0,"Based on reviews of this product, I bought a size XXL. I am 5'8"" and typically wear size XL. It could be because I bought a size up, but the hips of these pants stuck out very far and were unflattering, but the quality of fabric seemed to be good and if they fit properly they would probably be good for my trip to Thailand. I bought the light pink and unfortunately they are see through which was not good because I was hoping to wear them with a body suit. I returned the item and will not be re-purchasing."
3.0,"Dress was very pretty. But, did not look good on my body type. I'm a size 16/18. I don't like my tummy area too stick out.. and it did. I sent it back. But I did purchase other ""20's"" style dresses that really looked good!"
3.0,"Maybe we misread the description, but the picture showed drawsreings, which this hoodie did not have.  We were really wanting drawstrings for the cooler weather.  Other than that, great design and very cozy inside."
3.0,Love the case but does not seem protective.
3.0,for the price this is not so bad. the hook came undone for one of the bracelet but we put it back on. its a bit hard to put it on yourself and it the word love keep flipping to the back side. I like it.
3.0,"Has odor and not a soft sweatshirt, rather stiff."
3.0,"This is a decent summer dress, true to size. The only issue that I have is that it is so thin that you almost have to wear something underneath it, which defeats the purpose of a nice summer dress."
3.0,nice shoe but seems large
3.0,nice idea but expensive
3.0,"Love my thong style Telics and was anxious to try these to wear with socks around the house in the winter. I have plantar fasciitis from running and when at home opt for cushion/comfort on our tile floors. I believe due to the Unisex nature, the space between my foot and the strap was excessive for me. I usually wear an 8-8 1/2 and ordered the small. Length was perfect. Return was a breeze."
3.0,My chain broke way to easily and I absolutely adored this charm/necklace!!
3.0,It’s tights though it’s Xl
3.0,"Okay, it adds about 3 cup sizes. 3 stars because the sizing runs small. If you are a 34c, go with a 36DD. Really cute bra, good quality. I gave it to my friend and she really likes it. The 34C bra that I ordered fits her, a 32B quite well."
3.0,"I ended up returning this skirt. It runs a bit large and was much longer on me than in the pictures, but the one thing they could improve upon is the material they use. This skirt is much, much heavier than two other similar skirts I ordered, and the material is like heavy swimsuit material. I don't know how it would have performed during sweaty exercise sessions.<br /><br />I did like the color, the pockets,  and the price. The other two skirts I ordered and kept were twice as expensive, and are also not perfect :)<br /><br />Add leg grippers, breathable light weight material, and make it shorter, and you'd have a winner."
3.0,"Just okay. Fabric isn't very comfy, the neck is high, and the dress is short. I do appreciate the pockets, but otherwise probably do not recommend."
3.0,"The quality is great but the dress is a little big. I am 5'3"" and 145 pounds...I ordered a medium and it fits a little loose around the stomach and rib area."
3.0,"Cute, reasonably priced, easy on and off. But you get what you pay for,  some flaws in the seams. Overall a good first shoe."
3.0,Was expecting this to be loose fitting like the picture and to have full length sleeves..disappointed
3.0,"Good quality but just too small. I sent it back. I'm surprised, because Doublju garments usually fit me."
3.0,"The earrings are very cute but right out of the package I had to glue one of the eyes that had fallen off, (I decided to try although several reviews mentioned this) this was a easy fix but a Customer should not have to fix new merchandise. The product base material is some type of crafting ? foam paper that will not hold up long term....price does not reflect material quality."
3.0,"The first time this apron was washed (on gentle cycle in a brand new washing machine) the ends of the waist ties and the end of the neck strap are unraveling !!! It's a beautiful apron, but now it cannot be used for fear it will useless after just a few more washings."
3.0,A lot bigger around the wrist than expected. Very pretty though.
3.0,they look bigger on the picture but they are very small but nice
3.0,Very cute earrings but took 6 wks to arrive
3.0,"beautiful bracelet, it came quickly, however the small metal circle that holds the 2 owls together was missing , so i cannot wear it."
3.0,"ZukoCert Girls Shiny Metallic Dance Fashion Leggings are very cute. I would not recommend these as a substitute for pants, as the material is thin. This works well with a tunic top or a dress. The downside to these pants is the fabric is delicate, and should not be dried in the dryer, so we have been allowing them to air dry. I also would not recommend these leggings for rough play time, since the fabric is so delicate."
3.0,No me.gusto la correa y es muy largo. As nota que es de Buena calidad
3.0,The length of the shirt is too short. I felt like I was pulling it down all day. The criss cross design does give a flattering shape
3.0,I bought it to wear as a Halloween costume to match my son. Unfortunately I wasn't impressed with it at all once I received it. It's supposed to be a men's size however it ran small and it was to short on me. I'm tall for a woman at 5'll but it should have worked considering most mens pants are long on me. Oh well it got the job done for the night and it's retired in my closet.
3.0,"The strap was great but, unfortunately, too big for my daughter'S head. We were hoping to have it fit snug to her head to hold her glasses in place while she plays volleyball so we have to return it. I'll be looking for a child-sized version to fit our needs."
3.0,nice but somewhat small
3.0,The seams are to far down from the shoulder giving it a slouchy look.
3.0,"A bit large & thin...and the black seam is , well wide black stitching!"
3.0,Purchased as gift and haven't given them yet. They look much smaller than I expected but the designs are cute.
3.0,Good quality. Feels almost slippery not like a regular hoodie but comfortable and we'll made.
3.0,"I’m 6’4, 225ibs and was WAY TOO BIG to wear! Very heavy as well!<br />Would make a better wall decoration or paper weight.<br />Also the color isn’t gold but a slight green and tarnished color."
3.0,First off they should tell you this item is the size of a small belt buckle.its good quality but way way wY to big to put on your jacket.
3.0,"The dress is pretty darn cute, but there was a slit in th front, which I felt was in a weird place and just seemed out of place.  I returned and that process went incredibly smoothly.  Would have kept if no slit."
3.0,"Nice design and thin fabric...<br />Sleeves are narrow and tight...<br />Buttons are teenie tiny and thin.<br />Tedious to button.<br />Update...I was too quick to review..Fits more like a large...<br />Wish it was bigger, but I like it and floral design...<br />Tedious to button...<br />Pjs run very small.<br />Sad because I liked the pjs and would have reordered."
3.0,Tried to match this jacket to a shirt for work and it was more a washed dingy white. Disappointed.
3.0,My son is three and is obsessed with Power Rangers.  We buy him a lot of costumes and masks to play around the house in.  The item is as described. Just three stars because they eyes weren't that great and the mask is just meh.  Son hasn't picked it up since i gave it to him. We bought this one and another color.
3.0,I love the hat but thought that it would be more baggy. Will keep it but would not buy another. Disappointed.
3.0,It's a funny material that is very fitted.
3.0,"I bought these grip socks to use for an Xtend Barre class, which is a fusion between ballet and pilates performed on a hardwood floor. They are not grippy enough for that, and so I never use them unless all of my other grippy socks are dirty. But they would probably be fine for yoga."
3.0,A little silicon holder fell and made the glasses useless. Shame.
3.0,Order a size or two higher than you need; it's a pretty snug fit.
3.0,"I bought this dress for engagement pictures, and I’m returning it. If I was going to the beach or something I may have kept it, but the fit is really strange. The shoulders don’t fit as shown in the picture. The material feels like plastic. The bottom isn’t see through and flowy as shown in the picture. Overall, just a poorly quality dress."
3.0,My co-worker told me this Alex and Ani was very popular for girls however my 15 year old daughter likes it but says no one her age would know the meaning (even though the meaning to me is very empowering).
3.0,Great at first but then the latch broke making the wallet useless
3.0,"It's a very nice watch, but I wasn't crazy about the look of it in person."
3.0,"Very reasonable price, ok for a casual shoe. Do not recommend for exercising or standing all day."
3.0,"I liked the style and the way the panties fit.  However all of a sudden they are starting to unravel.  It is very annoying not all of the pairs have done that.  At least not yet.,"
3.0,Nice pattern. Didn't  like the short handles so I took them off and replaced with shoulder strap. Price was good.
3.0,"I bought these for a DD family member - the only thing that is a problem . . . the threads on the inside catch on toenails.  Other than that, they are a big hit and match pretty much any outfit she wears."
3.0,"Nipple covers. They serve their purpose but i was hoping for some support too. Ive only used them once and they are definitely still sticky enough for another time. I just dont know if ill use them that often because even though no straps or lines are a good look, saggy boobs with stickers on them are not."
3.0,My husband likes these jean but aren't his favorite. They look nice but they do poke out a little in the back in a weird way. Also the pocket has an ipod shaped crease on one of the pockets so it's hard not to stare at it. I think that was miss dyed.
3.0,Runs much smaller then details say
3.0,I always order big thinking it will be small & in this case it was actually really loose. & I'm tall I'm always wanting long shirts & this isn't one of those.
3.0,Boots are really comfortable. Fit true to size. Aren’t the greatest quality but what you would expect. The color of the taupe in the photos looks nothing like the actual product. The color is way off and not at all what I was looking for. Returning these due to the color.
3.0,"Works well, but should have looked further for various time windings."
3.0,Great quality bag.  The picture has silver hardware in picture but it's actually gold. Silver looks much better.  The inside of purse has a terrible stench to it.  I can't stand the smell. I'm working at trying to remove smell. If I do it will be a great bag.
3.0,Bust too small
3.0,"These are useable but for me they were too tight on my face. I have to keep pulling them<br />down off my nose to breathe easily. Some of them don't have enough material to cover my nose, mouth and<br />chin."
3.0,The magnet slipped throughout the day. Not a very efficient wristband. Magnet was weaker than I thought it would be.
3.0,It was shorter than expected.
3.0,"I usually wear a L/XL in dresses, but I ordered a M since the reviews stated that it runs big. The fabric is very light, breathable, and there is a slip under the dress so it’s not as see thru. The length was good (I’m 5’3”) and the front of the dress looked fine, but the back of the dress fit kind of awkwardly and doesn’t look like the picture. In fact, the dress pattern is not the same as what’s in the pictures in the listing. Also, the dress is not gray, it’s white and navy blue."
3.0,I liked this jacket but it has hole in left top pocket.
3.0,Thi material but it fits better than expected for the price.
3.0,Packaging not big enough and made them flat! Now they look funny when they are being worn.
3.0,nice pattern and good quality but scarf is too wide
3.0,I found that this was a little large for me.  The fabric is nice and soft though.  Dress hit about an inch above my knee.  It is cute and comfortable.  I did find the constructions wasn't that great - there was a hole inside the pocket where it wasn't sewn right.
3.0,I loved the feel but for a medium it was not fitted and was too stretchy for a medium. I'm not sure if a small will work but here's to trying it.
3.0,A great quality and design sweater. The arms fit perfect. The torso was just too short. Loved the beading. Would purchase again if redesigned to have a slightly longer torso.
3.0,"The chain is super thin, and not long enough for my taste. The pendant itself is decent, but the badge holder is held on by a weak clasp. I would have liked the chain to have been longer. The pendant part lands right at my boobs, and since I have to swipe my badge I'll have to replace the chain."
3.0,One the the band the hook kept coming out
3.0,"I had to replace all the jump rings with better quality steel ones.  I also had to put a better clasp ring on it.  I cleaned the black paint &#34;antiqueing&#34; off the the Tibetan silver charms, too.  It was a mess and made them look cheap."
3.0,"BEAUTIFUL BUT SEE THROUGH, YOU WILL NEED A SLIP TO WEAR THIS AND IF YOU ARE LIKE ME AND THE DRESS FITS SNUG...ORDER UP BECUASE THE SLIP WILL MAKE IT EVEN TIGHTER"
3.0,"The robe was supposed to be a gift for my husband, but it was not generous enough around the middle even though my husband is relatively slim. Got the next size up and it was too revealing as well—but huge in the shoulders. Made us sad because it’s a beautiful robe."
3.0,It looks awesome just one comes off easily and fell out at some point . I dont wear them much cause i dont want to lose them
3.0,"Beautiful and well made. I bought an XL so it would fit over sweaters,but this was sized more like a Medium (I am normally a size 10/12). It ended up as a gift for my 18 yr old niece."
3.0,"They style of the skirt is nice, but the material didn't give at all. It would have been nice if the waist had more stretch to it."
3.0,"This dress is beautiful, to start, and silky, made of a wonderful fabric that feels like silk and has a nice drape to it. Sadly, it wrinkles in the most terrible way. It wrinkles constantly, as it is worn, over the course of the day, making it look sloppy. This is a great dress for around the house, but, because of the wrinkling that occurs while wearing it, I can't recommend it for outdoor use. It just makes it look cheap and makes the person wearing it look like they don't care enough to bother, even though the dress is wrinkling all on its own, with simple wear, throughout the day. It is a shame, but this one just wrinkles too badly and too quickly to be attractive. Good luck finding what will work for your needs."
3.0,Ran a little small in the arms.  Otherwise liked the jacket
3.0,The choker met my expectations. It will go perfect with my costume
3.0,"You tube videos showing color blind persons experiencing astonishment the moment they look through these type of glasses.  However, having high deuteranomaly, I was expecting a drastic improvement in correctness of my color blindness, but only had a little improvement.  The improvement was enough to give colors a more 'rich, less faded' appearance."
3.0,"These glasses were a little smaller than I was expecting. If you usually order wider framed glasses, you may wanna skip these. I looked like a granny from the 40’s with them on."
3.0,"It is a pretty necklace, but the quality is very cheap. There was excess glue stuck to the outside of one of the jewels that I had to file off. But you get what you pay for I guess."
3.0,"The sweater fits well and is very soft. But when I received it, it was damp and mildew smelling, even though it was in a plastic bag. I washed and dried it and it got rid of most of the smell, but there's still a faint smell of mildew. I'll have to wash it again, maybe with some baking soda, and see if that rids the smell completely."
3.0,Thought it be more sturdy. Somewhat stretched the legs of my jeans
3.0,Product is too small. I’m an xl but this xl is almost like medium. My cousin who wears medium fit him perfect
3.0,Thin material. Rips easily. Sizing is semi accurate although the leg openings are boxy
3.0,The color was different. The color is not like the picture.
3.0,They weren't what I thought they were gonna be. Big on size
3.0,Gloves fit great. very comfortable. Not good on phones or tablets.
3.0,"If your pants size is a size 36, do not get a 36 belt. Otherwise, it'll be too small. Get the next size larger. (This goes for any size.) It ended up being too small, so I gave it to one of my friends who was a size 32. So far, he's really liked it. He said the belt fits great, and doesn't look cheap at all! He said it smells like real leather. It hasn't torn or anything yet, and he wears it most days since receiving the belt.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER . THIS PRODUCT WAS RECEIVED DISCOUNTED IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST, UNBIASED REVIEW."
3.0,"It feels cheap (for the price I can't complain too much)<br />The problem is, it barely fits my I phone, and it is only a I phone 5, so when I upgrade next year to a bigger phone, I will<br />need to purchase another case."
3.0,Made of plastic so we've had a few break already. They were a gift for Christmas for our toddler.  She loves them though!!!!
3.0,"Has a nice hard case, with a soft glass pouch, lens are easy to switch out, nose piece is adjustable but not comfortable for me at least. My nose has been broke 3 times and the bridge of my nose is sensitive."
3.0,"The earnings are a lot smaller than I thought, or at least smaller than they appear on the picture on the mannequins head. They are still pretty though so I kept them."
3.0,Very short inseam.  Quality is fine.
3.0,"While the design and usefulness of this cotton yukata is much the same as it always has been, this one is now manufactured out of cheaper cotton with cheaper dyes, and no longer features the reinforced seat area which was a great feature of this yukata previously."
3.0,"I ordered a medium based on Amazon’s size chart which should’ve been a 8/10. I received a size 6 instead. I didn’t notice until now that their sizes are different for this manufacture. Also, the strings are kind of flimsy however still cute. I will return due to sizing."
3.0,Pockets are just not assessable when you are in the field. Fit is fine nothing to weight home about. Definitely getting a new vest for next season.
3.0,Overall they are real cute. They are a little to snug to be comfortable for a longer period of time.
3.0,A bit too big and not a flattering shape..Not what i expected. Pretty design but not so great material
3.0,"The material and print were not as nice as I was expecting. The material is lightweight and feels more like a polyester than a cotton as posted in the description when I purchased the dress. Also, the hems were all overlocked hems (as seen in the photos) instead of bias or folded which also gave it a cheaper quality feel as well.  Still was cute for a one time holiday wear for my 2 year old."
3.0,Slightly smal.
3.0,Fit a bit smaller than expected. Looks cheap in my opinion
3.0,"Print is not as shown, print is very blurred and not the pattern as shown"
3.0,End was not attached and was just in the package the edging will come off easily
3.0,Arrived with one lense popped out of each pair. Returned for easy refund. Replaced with another pair.
3.0,Runs small and I had no problems returning it for a bigger size.
3.0,Returned as the bras run way to small in the size chart indicated. Was very disappointed.
3.0,Wore maybe 3 times and the latch broke
3.0,These pants run almost 2 sizes too small!
3.0,A bit smaller than what I expected and this material doesn't stretch. You may benefit from purchasing one size up
3.0,Pretty.Wish they were a little larger.
3.0,"These are great on, and seemed sturdy. The housing with the hinge and temple came off and I can;t even glue it on. It was normal wear, nothing out of the ordinary. But since they are on sale, I'll buy another pair. So ★★★★★ for price and look. But ★★ for durability."
3.0,"The nightgown runs large but I haven't worn it yet and do not know how it washes.  It has a strange odor, so I am trying to air it out before wearing."
3.0,The reason I marked the socks on the small side is they are tight around the calf (listed as ankle socks) I am not able to wear them because of that. They arrived on time and are very cute. They are on the thin side but for the style (trouser socks) it's what you would expect.
3.0,It wasn't short as others said I'm 5ft 4in and the dress went to my knee caps I don't like how wide it is on the bottom I think it makes you look bigger than you are but it's a cute dress
3.0,"It looks great, and good for the price.  The reason I didn't give it a 5 star review is the hands stop working even though the second hand ticks."
3.0,"First of all, mine came in black and not teal<br /><br />Fabric used is similar to Jansports Daypack backpack. Durability should be very high as the backpack lasted most of my grade school career (4th -12th grade) with no wear-and-tear. This should last longer if you put clothes in compared to heavy text books<br /><br />Aside from company logo, the bag is plain throughout. No additional pockets, just one large compartment<br />Only the large bag has a breathable strip<br /><br />Zippers are sturdy. Can have stop gaps in the expansion zip. Make sure the fabric doing the expansion doesn't get in the way of the zipper as it may get lodged in, and must spend a minute plus trying to unhook it from the zipper<br /><br />Stitching is okay. Sewing seems are not even in the smaller one. May see some loose fabric in interior you want to cut with scissors<br /><br />Grab handle is convenient. Centered if compressed. Uncompressed, you may feel some sag when full."
3.0,"I purchased one of these for my daughter. It arrived on time and was beautiful out of the box. However, the craftsmanship leaves a lot to desire for. The pins in the fixed strap hinges are loosely attached and fall off very easily and get lost. The strap hinges frequently become locked in a wrinkled position difficult to unlock making the watch difficult to wear. The watch mechanism has been working OK (so far). Hoping it doesn't turn-out the same way as the strap hinges. Would not recommend it."
3.0,The material was rather cheap and flimsy...
3.0,"It fits perfectly (I got a large, I'm 5'3 and 145lbs) and looks adorable. I don't like bikinis on me and  wanted a more modest swimsuit that covers my stomach and upper thighs. This is perfect. I haven't worn it in water yet, but I will update as soon as I have more data"
3.0,"I LOVE the material but the top is too tight for my 36D bust, which is so disappointing because the bottom is super flowy. If it were cut differently or had a v-neck to accommodate for larger breasts, this would be my absolute favorite!"
3.0,"This was what came up on my search for thin, quick drying fleece. Not sure why, since it is none of those. Much too bulky to pack for camping. When wet, it is heavy (like a cotton sweater). Even though the body will air dry overnight, the cuffs will not. It took an extra 30-40 minutes in the drier to get them dry enough to wear. I would have sent it back, but my wife got a little carried away with how sexy it is, so now I have to keep it."
3.0,Pretty but turns skin green after a few days
3.0,"In the picture it looks like the sock is grey, with lighter grey dots on it, with light grey lace. No the dots are white, and the lace is bright white. I am still not sure why you would put bright white lace on a grey sock, but oh well. It just didn't work for me. They are fairly decent made. I think I might try and dye the lace grey because I really need it to match a particular outfit."
3.0,holds battery life good.<br />fit is a little strange but might just be my ears.<br />nice product for hands free
3.0,"Loved the look , hate the fit. They run narrow at the toes and makes my pinky toe hurt badly even though I went a half size bigger"
3.0,"Order a size up, also the material is super thin and will so all of your bumps and lumps"
3.0,"The jewel hanging won't stay right, it slips off to one side or almost turns over."
3.0,It is very yellow. Looks fake. I dont like it.
3.0,The product is nice however it came packaged and all the feathers were flat and are not fluffy like the picture depicts.. The costume is also for 3 to 4 months old not a newborn.
3.0,"I bought this dress for homecoming. It is beautiful and fits well,  I tired it on and had a hard time with the zipper it got stuck in the middle where the band is.  It took 2 people to get it zipped up. Then a week before the dance I tried it on again and once again my mom and sister had to zip it up that middle section again. However i felt that it was not a big deal it took two people to zip it up i can deal with that.  However the night of the dance I got ready with friends and as i asked them to help,  they could not they tried and after the last attempt the zipper broke, and no homecoming dress."
3.0,THIS IS A WATCH. NOT SHOES
3.0,"These are pretty, they just wont stay in place unless you pinch them all the way in making them so uncomfortable to wear over 10 minutes."
3.0,"I could have sold this skirt 100 times. However, I normally wear a size 2. I ordered a 4 but should have ordered a 6. Holy moly is it tight. Again, I adore this skirt but order a size, or 2, larger than expected."
3.0,This bracelet arrived damaged. The stone was out of the setting. It will have to be glued to  stay in. Better to quick fix then returning it but company should be aware.
3.0,"Gloves are ok, i don't use them for bike riding though.  Fit as expected."
3.0,This would have been a nice item but the mouth hole was child like and did not work for us.
3.0,The material was really cheap feeling and the dress was way too short. Think Halloween costume material
3.0,"Poorly made, not durable at all."
3.0,No moving parts at all. This is a hallow plastic box shaped as a ghb trap. Good to keep on a desk as a conversational piece. Looking back I should have gotten the Mattel one with the lights and foot peddal.
3.0,This tie is not as 'bright' as in the picture.  A little duller in real life.  Still a very nice tie.
3.0,The tie part at the top does not look like the model but it is a cute cover-up.
3.0,These are cute glasses with a very 1940’s retro style. They fit my small face well. I just wonder about long term durability as the arms are slim and seem to bend easily.
3.0,"Sizing is perfect, color is a bit off"
3.0,Pretty dress with lining. It was just running small so I hv to return it.
3.0,Zipper broke but nice pants
3.0,"The ring is very nice, but it runs really small, so if you order it, order a size larger than you actually wear"
3.0,The skirt is nice looking and fit well but the smell of the material is horrendous....I tried to let it air out cleaned it with a vinager rinse but the chemical  smell is too strong. So I had to throw it out.
3.0,"I guess it is ok, it is not very sturdy and I thought the purses were clipped on but the strap just lays on the little hooks. I only have 12 purses on the hooks and they are completely full. I would not buy it again."
3.0,"This a cute little version of Crocs. It is MUCH lighter, and definitely not as long lasting. The size was misleading and ended up too small within 1 month. Buy 1 size up. It's perfect for one or 2 seasons wear, if you don't care to hand it down and just want something cheap for fast growing feet."
3.0,"Nice slipper, but way too small."
3.0,They were too tight and too thin.
3.0,"I bought this in a size small after reading the reviews and it ended up looking like a paper bag on me.  I’m 5’7, 124 lbs. and usually wear a small/medium.  DO NOT size up!  The material was great and the color was spot on. The length was also great.  It hit about mid thigh.  However,  I do believe this is plus size or something because it swallowed me whole 😱"
3.0,Nice soft fabric but attracts lint.
3.0,"Ran small. Normally I wear a large, ordered a large — should’ve ordered an X-Large. :-(<br /><br />Didn’t wear to my Cowboys vs. 49ers game. :-( Sad!<br /><br />Will be returning. :(<br /><br />Really liked the style!!!!<br />#Disappointed."
3.0,"Felt a little lower quality and ill fitting than expected. I ended up liking the green the best. A little saggy in the look, definitely a casual look not to be dressed up but shiny."
3.0,"The dress was really comfortable and the style was what I was looking for, but the white sunflower dress that I bought was really transparent.  You would have to wear a full slip underneath or use it as a swimsuit cover up.  It is definitely not meant for a casual summer dress.  I had to return it.  It did fit true to size though.  I ordered a small and it hit me right above the knee.  I stand at 5'2""."
3.0,I still have it just little tight
3.0,Really don't look like pic.  Wish it had a button
3.0,These earrings are pretty and I do like them but I don't love them like I thought I would. They don't look as good in person as they do in the ad.
3.0,"I purchased a medium which I thought would be extremely comfortable as well as cute yet I was a bit disappointed.  Most concerning was the fit as it was much bigger than I anticipated and longer as well.  I also did not like the inability to adjust and tighten, what I thought, was a drawstring as it’s not functional and solely for design purposes. Competitively priced and reasonable shipping time."
3.0,It was too tight around my arms.
3.0,"My husband has the 'original brand' sandal and loves them so I thought I'd buy these to see how they compare and while they are pretty much alike in design it's the quality of rubber which is the only difference that he could feel, but it made a difference to him, so we sent them back."
3.0,My daughter has been wearing an adult adjustable gaiter. She asked for a kids one. I found this one while searching with the word “adjustable” kids neck gaiter. 1) only the blue is adjustable via pictures and I didn’t pay that close attention to it 2) limited colors along with only one being adjustable.
3.0,They stretch out by the end of the day.
3.0,I usually wear baggy shirts. I ordered a 2x and it fits on the smaller side of a large. So very way off in size.
3.0,"Bought this as a gift and was surprised at how light and thin it was in the packaging.<br />It felt like I was holding a hankerchief! Also, the colors match with the picture given."
3.0,"Not much support, had to adjust a lot"
3.0,Somewhat tight and too long for my size. But I like it!
3.0,The sweater came in a vaccuum  packed bag took an hour to iron all the wrinkles  it's an ok purchase
3.0,"This top is adorable but not what bra I wear you can see the imprint through the top. I even ordered a size up, but nothing worked."
3.0,It was missing the button in the back
3.0,They run A LOT smaller then other brands. They wouldn’t even begin to cover my calves. They’re great colors though and seem to be great if they would fit.
3.0,"Stunning is more marketing hyperbole than an accurate description of what you get.  The photos are generously retouched in my opinion. The earrings do not approach the level of luminosity or deep ruby color depicted - even after a through cleaning. $15 would be a more appropriate price point. The studs come in a small, purple plastic bag - not a little jewelry box.<br /><br />They are ok for a young boy to give his mommy for Christmas."
3.0,Used for Christmas pictures and it was strangely long and looked silly on our 2 year old.. kind of made the pictures look weird to be honest
3.0,"Super SUPER cute. Very comfortable, and does not irritate my wrist. However, one little snag will start a giant hole in the fabric. Beware, cat owners!"
3.0,Too tight at the bottom.
3.0,I purchased this set hoping to wear these on a daily basis and as sleepers. Not sure if these items are actually 24kt but I'm hoping the color doesn't wear off or tarnish. I just tried on one pair today. These were received yesterday.<br /><br />3 of the 4 items are as described.  I'm hoping the vendor will rectify the 4th item (see pictures). The purchase was made based off the measurements in the pictures provided by the vendor.<br /><br />I will update this review after I've tried the items for more than a day.
3.0,THESE THINGS ARE LINT AND HAIR MAGNETS...lord have mercy it's like you have to have a lint roller 25/8.
3.0,I ordered XL because I am a little top heavy.  It was still snug.  These blouses run really small.  Gave them to a friend.
3.0,Too tiny but it’s ok coz my kid manage to wear it during holiday
3.0,"this is going to sound weird but at first i bought the smaller size and it was just a little too tight and was incrediblyyyy itchy. i thought it was b/c the size so i got the next size up instead. i waited too long to actually wear it and when i did the cups are actually still itchy... idk what it is or maybe i'm allergic to something in the fabric, kind of weird."
3.0,"Be careful when ironing!  Mine arrived very wrinkled.  I put my iron on the polyester setting and after only a minute of heating up, I began to iron the sleeve. The second the iron touched,  it melted a hole in it :( I don't feel like I can send it back since it didn't arrive damaged."
3.0,"I am a tad bit disappointed with this purchase. I thought purchasing a XXL would be adequate to wear over a sweater. It was not. Additionally, the leather sleeves are low quality. The jacket is inexpensive and as usual, you get what you pay for. I do not expect this garment to last very long."
3.0,"The recommended size for me was xsmall but I ordered a small.  I’m 5’5, 113lbs, 33/26/34.  The small was very tight and this material is very thin and unforgiving.  I exchanged for a medium and the medium wasn’t much bigger but it fit me more relaxed and not clinging so I like it.  If you’re self conscious about any bulges, go bigger!"
3.0,They are pretty but if you have a  case on your phone they do not fit very well. If your phone doesn't have its earphone jack on the top makes it awkward to use also.
3.0,"Top is perfect, bottoms went in the trash. Terrible fit"
3.0,"Soft, beautiful garment. Not for the larger chested ladies like myself. I have a small frame, but at 34DD, I'll have to make some alterations for the gown to fit my chest. It fits well in length and along hips/curves otherwise. The colour is really pretty, a soft pink."
3.0,"According to the size chart, considering height and bust size I should have ordered a Large. I followed Amazon's  suggestion of ordering a size down. It is comically large on me. I'm 5'8"" with a 42"" bust. In the Medium I still had ample space on top, the crotch was halfway down to my knees and I had at least 4 inches of extra leg length. I decided to keep it anyway, because my 6'3"" son said he'd wear it instead. Should fit him just fine.<br /><br />The quality of this costume is really good! Fabric isn't super flimsy, sturdy zippers, zippered pockets. It's great. Will hold up for years, I am sure."
3.0,With a long blouse it’s OK but otherwise the size is off small by about a half size to a full-size
3.0,Because the paint come off the one the chain
3.0,broke about a week after I had them I just threw them away
3.0,"My son is on the verge of growing out of six to nine month clothes, and is 28 inches long and 20 lbs and this 6-9 month pjs are big on his feet arms stomach. I’m thinking it was mid labeled because I think it’s really size 18 months"
3.0,The weight of this necklace is okay. But the color is very burnished gold
3.0,"Looks good, get compliments but doesn’t fit properly because loops don’t sit behind ear properly."
3.0,"The socks themselves fit pretty well and are soft! I was expecting them to be a bit more rough, but very comfortable. The only thing I'm knocking off from the rating is the fact that the print was a bit stretched and not perfect circles. I'm not talking about when they are put on your legs (obviously they will stretch then), but the pattern is still skewed when it was printed. Overall I'm happy, but they could do a bit better since an accurate print is the whole point of the product."
3.0,"I bought this for my daughter. It was beautiful, but much too small.  We had to send it back."
3.0,definitely wash before wearing
3.0,It's alright I suppose for the price. It isn't centered correctly and you can tell it is cheaply made. Wouldn't really recommend it for a nice present.
3.0,"The sleeves were a little too baggy and short. Definitely not a jacket to wear for warmth. Wish it had worked out, but not my favorite fit."
3.0,These are super cute. Just run a tad small. I’d recommend sizing up for accurate sizing. Soft  and breathable material and would be great for all day wear.
3.0,"Theres nothing wrong with it, Its just an ok bracelet.  Would be prettier if the solid black bracelet was a different color or the bracelet with the colored beads had the colored beads all around. Too much black!  Im returning it."
3.0,It was a nice shirt to wear a few times.... and then there was a hole in the shirt indicating weak sewing. Maybe I just got a bad one.
3.0,One size off … runs small
3.0,"I've always liked BAISHENGGT tops, something has changed. The top shown is not the same cut you receive. This top was disappointing."
3.0,"I am about a sz 12 and these are so tight around my ankles I had to give them to my child. Otherwise, well made and soft. Just wish they would offer a larger ankle width."
3.0,You get what you pay for. It is very cute and if I had a teen or pre-teen I would gift it to them. I have to take one for the team on this one.
3.0,Zipper tassels fell of within 2 weeks. Looks more metallic color than shown on photo.
3.0,"Quality is so so. Gulf logo is glued onto the hat, not stitched on which makes it look subpar."
3.0,"The clip that you use to attach itself the band was to short and the band itsself left some space, BUT its an amazing product and im happy. I just used the ones from my old band and switched them out. It doesnt slide or anything so we good! Im satisfied!"
3.0,Zipper pull came off after a couple washes
3.0,Skirt is just okay. Polyester fabric is textured.
3.0,Logo is what looks like a iron on sticker. Hat seems ok otherwise
3.0,These are beautiful earrings but one broke easily and it was a couple days after the return window had closed. Bummer
3.0,It works.. Bit It Is biiiiiggg!
3.0,I really can not rate this. I did not realize it was coming in size small. Not my size!<br />It had lotsof pockets. But I could not wear it.
3.0,This isn’t that great. It kept flipping towards and rolling at the bottom. I just felt disappointed with my experience. I wanted to love it!
3.0,A little large for me. Quality if okay
3.0,didn't fit the way I expected & has no support in any areas but I am a DD/E
3.0,A button would be helpful to keep the breast section coming undone.
3.0,"The bill is a lot smaller than expected, but the head strap is adequate. It's a cheapo visor, not something you'd expect for the Olympic team. Price is good for what it is."
3.0,"I like how they fit... but I ordered the pink tint. Got the red ones.  They came a bit dirty, with no case included"
3.0,"Pants were nice, but had a funny cut in the seat.  5xl pants should have deeper cut.  Pants could not be pulled all the way up in the back."
3.0,"Love the cat ears and bow, but the tail was tiny... more like a rat's tail.  Lol"
3.0,It states that it is waterproof but I have worn it twice in the rain on hikes and have gotten wet anyways. They shouldn't advertise something if the product doesn't actually do it. The only thing I like about it is that it's comfortable and fits well.
3.0,Came with one stone missing. Kinda heavy & points down a bit. I like them though.
3.0,easy to use and identify at the cauresel
3.0,"Bummer!! They have a bra liner in them. I got these for ease of nursing and now I have to wrestle with the elastic up over my bra and then pull my bra out from under the elastic. Pretty colors, but nowhere does it say there is a bra shelf built in. So, be aware"
3.0,"The material was nice and squat proof. It was true to size. However, the color was not what was expected/advertised. They were grey not black camo. Unfortunately, I bought for the color so I’ll be returning."
3.0,I'm a US size 12 (5'3&#34; and 185 pounds) but the XL doesn't fit me. Oh well - I will find someone to donate it to.
3.0,"It appears they only offer these pants with a 30"" inseam. That's probably fine with M or S sizes, but was nowhere near good enough for L for me (6'2"") and likely not good enough for most people who might order XL. Otherwise the product seemed nice...I would have kept them if the sizing was more appropriate."
3.0,"The glasses themselves are fine, but in days of yore, these glasses had the leather on the side built into the frames.  These leather sidings attach with very flimsy clips.  If you're going to wear them to do anything ACTUALLY athletic with them, be prepared to either ditch the leather, or find at least one of them lost by the end of day 1."
3.0,This shirt shows my midriff 😢
3.0,Super cute! Kind of short my daughter is tall and this is more of a long shirt than a dress. It will work well with leggings underneath.
3.0,I’m 5 ft 2 and the leggings fell right above my ankle. I’d prefer they be about an inch longer. 1st time worn they ran in the back and that really sucked because I was so excited for these leggings. They’re not sweat proof but I do like the thickness and color.
3.0,"Cute and light weight, good quality for price but it runs a bit small so I ended up returning."
3.0,"Mine were the right length, but the shape of the toe crowded my toes toward the center rather than being shaped for the average foot. Beyond that, they looked like they were well made and possibly comfortable if you order at least a full size larger than you normally wear. Do not go by their size chart. If you must, then measure to your 3rd toe (the middle one), NOT your big toe."
3.0,The large/extra large barely fit my 14 year old. They work great but are very snug. Be careful on the size.
3.0,They are not the emerald green color the picture shows. But they are the size that I expected and they are a dark smokey green.
3.0,Not the product's fault
3.0,I was not expecting that this is how small it is. Picture is deceiving
3.0,"The snake chain felt cheap, but it is a cheap set. Returned and got a Pandora set up."
3.0,Too small but loved the design.
3.0,"Fit great except the entire bottom of my butt was out. I am pretty thick bottomed though. Otherwise cute, will have to wear leggings underneath"
3.0,It was ok. Sometimes it tries to roll up
3.0,"Was disappointed with this item, as I ordered a total of 3, one for myself and for each of my daughters. Was not as shiny as appears in picture. Looks more like standard silver than sterling silver."
3.0,Order larger than your size
3.0,The dress is really pretty and nicely made but the rest of the items are meh. My main issue is that the dress is still too small even after ordering a size up. The chest area is too tight but the rest of it is fine! For the other little items I don’t have many complainants since anything I had an issue with I could easily fix on my own. Overall 3 outta 5 since I ended up only really using the dress and headband.
3.0,I’m quite sure I ordered a big size? But maybe this is one size fits all because it’s about a size 7… I was hoping for a size 13.
3.0,Not 100 pieces.  put each one on a jump ring and counted.<br />Some fit the 10mm jump ring. Some would need a smaller one. Overall fine for the price. Just wish it were actually 100 pieces.
3.0,"I ordered my normal size, it fits fine. The cut is not the most flattering and the fabric is very thick! This is a heavy sweater!!!"
3.0,"Very nice, yet that type of material makes me get goosebumps. Kinda like when you scratch a chalkboard with your nails type of thing."
3.0,I'm a xl but this xl was really a medium.
3.0,I think the fabric is cheap looking
3.0,It is a beautiful dress but small in the hip area.
3.0,Gold coating was sub par. Did not have a pleasing gold color. Also 2 of the pearls had fallen out
3.0,"Just opened box, can see border stitching is coming off of belt, with thread/material peeling.  Doesn’t appear to be used, so build quality comes into question.  When I open a box I’d at least want it to look like.  Other than the issues I described functionality wise...it’ll hold your pants up."
3.0,Looked exactly like pictured but difficult to open the clips!
3.0,Not as show
3.0,"Cute but the front flap doesn't seem to stay down as seen in picture. Otherwise, quality of the boots I received seems good."
3.0,"I actually love the costume.  However it is about 2 sides smaller than what I expected from the size chart.  But, I did like it well enough for the price, that I kept it in hopes of losing weight.  It was beautiful."
3.0,I didnt read description well .. thot it was cotton knit not polyester
3.0,I didn’t keep I returned the dress it was not the quality of a dress I would normally wear. Returned because I would not wear it
3.0,It’s too thin.. but I think it may serve the purpose I was expecting but more thicker quality
3.0,A little more snug than I wanted. I am large size so it did work well for a long flight to Europe
3.0,"Received the wrong size on both dresses:/ Got an XL and L instead of the XS and S. Seemed cute and well made, but if you can't get the right size, defeats the purpose. Returning and trying again. Will update after my next attempt.<br />Edit: So after doing some thinking, I'm  assuming I might have received the correct sizes, but their Asian size conversion if that makes sense. If so, wow still way off! I'm 5'7&#34; 126lbs and both were too big and really baggy in the arms. Too much trouble so won't be reordering and instead purchased another dress. Free returns so gave another star. Cute if you are able to get the right size."
3.0,Liked the concept but You could hardly tell is a cat. You can't really see the eyes...The eyes are like really  at the edge of the earring. Wish the eyes were more like the picture.
3.0,They don’t stay up as well as others.
3.0,My daughter is skinny. We returned this because it was just right in the length but way to wide on her. I decided not to size down because I was worried about the length.
3.0,Not seriously as for girls.
3.0,I like everything about this purse except the fact that the snap closure will not stay closed.
3.0,The pants are really nice but run larger than I expected.
3.0,"I grew up in a low income household all my life, my one clear goal for my life was to go to college and earn money so my children and wife don't have to go through the same thing I went through. However, after seeing these shoes, I changed my mind. I decided stop going to college and start working at Mcdonalds because I NEEDED to buy these shoes. Now I am forced to live my life in in the lower class again. But this time, I can do it in fashion. I would rate it 5 but they get dirty easily."
3.0,"I didn't know anything about Logan Paul,  If I did I never would have bought this item.  You shouldn't support that moron."
3.0,Very cute colors but very thin.. definitely will have to wear something under it. I wish it was thicker.
3.0,"I love the color of these leggings, that is what drew me into buying them.  However, the texture of these leggings is polyester and we are talking 1970’s polyester.  I personally could hardly stand the feeling of them in my workout class but if you are into that sort of texture by all means please buy them.  The fit is slightly loose so maybe size down if you want some extra hold.  I would give them an “eh” rating.  I probably won’t wear them much but I will keep trying and see if my feelings change about them."
3.0,"At 5&#34;8&#34; and 145 pounds the Large fits Ok but felt tight when trying to put on. I think it's because the garment and material does not stretch. As a bad arm is one of the reasons I looked for a short sleeved hoodie I would encourage you to go up one size. This is a well built hoodie, outer polyester material is strong and fells like it might help block the wind. The inner fleece is quite thin so you'll need to be generating your own heat to make this one a good choice Fit and finish are excellent overall."
3.0,"You get what you pay for. The fabric is a nonstretchy cotton with no give. Carter's tends to run small and narrow, in our experience. Our five and a half month old son is quite large for his age, such that he has pretty much outgrown these PJ's in the 9 month old size. We can get him into them, but zipping them up around his large thighs is tricky."
3.0,This thing is huge! Make sure to review the size before you buy this monster!
3.0,I love the earrings but the necklace is bulky and way too big. I am a jeweler so I am going to use the pieces for other things. The amber is really pretty.
3.0,"The scarf didn't come with a metal ring to be used with it, as stated in the description.  The scarf is also SIGNIFICANTLY darker than pictured, I wouldn't call this a beige scarf.  It is a brown scarf with black polka dots.  It is also a sheer material, this is NOT a winter scarf.  Purchased it as a gift for someone, so they will still get the gift; had I purchased this for myself, I would be returning it."
3.0,Loved the skirt but I am typically a medium and it just ran too big
3.0,"I like the dress, but it is way too short. Made for someone that is 4 feet tall not 5'6. Comes just below the knees. Too short. I do not show my legs, they are damaged better to keep them covered."
3.0,Sized for a child not an adult
3.0,"It was large at the bottom, and way too pricey."
3.0,"My husband thought these were very nice sunglasses as he thought it's hard to find the round aviator type glasses.  Anyways, with in 2 days of receiving them, the nose pcs broke off.  For $10.00 who cares, but I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,I ordered a 2-3x and they were so small they fit my granddaughter who is a small!
3.0,Listed as men size but is too tight on my arm. It would be good if it came in sizes.
3.0,Cambia de color con el tiempo
3.0,"great skirt, a bit large in the waist.but otherwise, lovely."
3.0,I like the fabric it is perfect for hot summer weather. Fits good. Its not like the picture. Theres not alot of fabric. It does not flow to the ground. Im 5'4 it hits right at my ankles and i ware 36dd it is snug on top but wearable. Overall i like it enough to wear it and keep it especially for the price.
3.0,It’s cute but it made me itchy I should have known better since I’m allergic to everything.
3.0,"It was cute, but it looks like a beach coverup and not a dress. I’m tall and thin and I would not wear this to work. It may be pretty for a casual Saturday, but uncomfortable at work. Unless you plan to “show a little leg” at work, this dress is pretty awkward.<br /><br />The pictures suggest it’s more like a dress, which is misleading. I wore a $20 dress to a wedding and I would never wear this to a wedding. Maybe if it’s the third wedding... in a courthouse... or Vegas! Hehe"
3.0,"The head band easily snapped as I tried to adjust the hat so I had to add another one. It was flat as a pancake so I had to use the heat from a blow dryer to try and revive it but it's still a little crumpled. I almost sent it back, the picture was lovely but when I got the hat it looked like someone sat on it."
3.0,"It's a cute print. Good length for me, probably too short for anyone else. It's sheer. Like, I have to wear a slip under if I want to wear it as a dress; but I wanted it as a beach coverup, so, overall I'm happy with it. No pockets."
3.0,Seems to be of pretty good quality. Runs small. Around the kneck is kinda tight. not long enough either.
3.0,"Not crazy about this ring.  Fits true to size.  CZ stones are nice.  Color of rose gold plating is too &#34;copper-y&#34; for my taste.  From the top, ring looks thin and dainty, but from the side it looks thick and has ugly ridges where the prongs are.  This thickness, along with the prongs, make this ring uncomfortable to wear.  From far away it's not bad, but close-up overall look and feel of this ring is &#34;cheap.&#34;"
3.0,It's nice but it's a bit large it's soppused to be a anklet but it's almost long enough to be a choker
3.0,It is see through and come right above my knees. It's cute though
3.0,I wear a 34 DD and this wouldn't work for me...
3.0,"A little big and gaudy, didn't wear it for long, maybe one month.  Decent, didn't cause any irritation and didn't break."
3.0,The material wasn’t as expected
3.0,This was such a cute dress and felt like good quality but was much smaller than anticipated. XL usually works for me but I couldn’t even get my arms through to pull the rest down.
3.0,I have a 36” waist and this shirt in Large was too tight. I returned it and ordered another one in X-Large and it barely fits. I’m afraid that when I wash it I won’t be able to wear it again. Also note that there is no pocket on this shirt if that is a concern for you. As far as the look and quality it’s actually quite nice.
3.0,"It's a pretty big top, I'd order a whole size smaller.  The cuffs of the blouse at the wrist are really wide, there are no buttons.  It is a hard blouse to roll at the sleeves since the wrist openings are so wide.  Also the blouse is much brighter in real life, versus the colors in the pic are more muted."
3.0,Si too heavy
3.0,I loved the hat but had to return it because it was much too small
3.0,"I admit to having large hands but these are basically too small for adult hands.  I could not even get my fingers to go into the openings for fingers.  When I buy regular gloves I need x-large, not because my fingers are fat but they are long.  I could not even get my fingers to enter the opening."
3.0,"The sturdiness seemed good, but they were still way too tight. I was hoping they would fit me since I usually wear a size small, but nope! For reference I'm 5'3 and weigh 110 lbs"
3.0,"Admittedly, I did not look at the pictures close enough.  The navy blue band isn't navy entirely.  It is black and navy.  When wearing, one side is navy and the other side is showing the black color.  This is weird to say the least.  I believe most folks want to wear a band that is the same color throughout.  The strangest part is that the back side of the black side is the navy blue!  This seems like a design/production flaw."
3.0,Product is cheaply made. Much more attractive in picture than what it looks like on.
3.0,"Sizes were not what I expected but they were nice, comfortable"
3.0,Beautifully crafted - too delicate. One has already broken.
3.0,I would order a size up
3.0,It’s nice but fits small. The fabric on the sleeves is thinner than the rest but it’s good quality overall.
3.0,This had a horrible smell to it.  I had to air it out for a while.  It fits perfectly
3.0,"I ordered a medium and returned for a large. I AM 5'2"" and it barely covers my backside and is still form fitting as a large. I have a C chest, but am breastfeeding so my size fluctuates. It is very flattering on me. My husband likes it. So I ordered in several colors. The green and pink are beautiful. The construction is ok. The lace is very delicate. Try not to machine wash and follow their instructions. They are both showing wear and I havent had these for more than a month. Dont expect them to last but if you want them for a specific purpose and are ok with something pretty that doesnt need to last forever, this fits that bill."
3.0,"The size on this is true to the size you choose, which I really appreciate.  Unfortunately, the quality really isn't very good - even after being pressed, the seams tend to ripple up and not be smooth, so the nice material still manages to appear to be lesser quality.  The jacket is fully lined, though, and looks like it's attached properly so that it will hold up and hold its shape over time."
3.0,"The dress is pretty, and well made.  Runs pretty big.  I usually wear a medium for everything, I will be returning this and reordering with a small or XS."
3.0,This thing is cheaply made. save your money
3.0,Very nice quality but size L was still too small
3.0,It was lovely but I didn't get to wear it due it being torn when I received it.
3.0,Pretty dress. To small though.
3.0,I guess I expected better color coverage. I’m currently wearing the black ring and the threading is not lined up enough so there is a bit of silver steel color poking out. I keep double checking to see if it’s a booger.
3.0,The first item I ordered was lost in transit so I had to request for a replacement. And because it was meant for a gift I emailed supplier the first time and asked if it would come with a gift box and I was told it usually did. I got the replacement but was disappointed to see the top part of the bag a little deformed without the Kate Spade box. The color is not as pristine as it appeared online. It was a little dull but not so much a big deal for its price. The size is perfect for my need.
3.0,"Ive been using this for over two years. love the locking mechanism. The other wire keychains w screw locking mechanism loosens over time.  I carry a lot of keys and this one is not long enough. Thus 3 stars. Unlike other keychains, it doesn’t scratch my car’s dash"
3.0,Be nice if they were longer
3.0,A little large. Quality seems to be good but haven't worn it much yet.
3.0,Love pantera but the shirt ran small
3.0,Had holes in the sides that my wife had to sew.
3.0,I wanted to give this 5 stars but whoever stitched this robe did not do a good job. It’s a cute robe though.
3.0,"It fits...kinda.. it's a little small for the size I ordered. Also the lace is barely attached to the shirt, seems sewn on strange, but it works.. I was kind of hoping for a better product, but I will probably wear it, or I'll pass it to someone who can."
3.0,"It's ok,don't like the fabric"
3.0,"My husband did the testing for this one and said that these worked for the most part in keeping his shirt tucked in. It kept it tucked but was a bit strange to get all the tucking in done. Also when he bent and moved a lot his shirt bunched a bit. However, his shirt did remain tucked in for the most part.<br />These underwear with the shirt holders to work they are just a bit odd and take some getting used to. He isn't sure that he would wear them all the time or anything but for occasions that it might be very important that the shirt remain tucked no matter what, even though some shirt bunching may occur."
3.0,I hope they fit and are not ruined.
3.0,It's just ok don't like the quality little big
3.0,"I hate, hate , hate that they tacked up up the sleeves is unattractive and it never stays in place other where they tacked up the sleeve so it looks messy."
3.0,These headbands are okay but they are too tight on my head.  I've never had this problem any other headbands I've owned in the past.  They may stretch to a comfortable fit with use.  I'm an adult male with an average size head.
3.0,"I bought this as a gift for my mom, but it just didn't work for her. She found the cut a little odd and thought the material was a bit &#34;busy.&#34; The colored threads were too much. She said the quality of the material seemed fine, but it just wasn't the right gift."
3.0,"Not as large as wanted. But doable! Has very sparking stone! Pretty nice, but will look for larger radius next time!"
3.0,"Great set! Helps to keep prevent from over packing. Easy to locate items. Unfortunately, I was missing the medium cube from my order."
3.0,"I LOVE the plugs that I ordered, I’m disappointed that one set was not complete and it was the set I mostly wanted. I have yet to figure out how to get in touch with someone to fix this..."
3.0,"Did not stick at all! Oh and I'm a B cup, so those who are saying its not for big chested women... It did work for me either. Unfortunately it seemed very sticky when I took it out of the package, it just seems to cling to everything, but then as i tried whereing it through the day, I felt very uncomfortable in public messing with my boobs when it felt like it was coming off every 30 seconds.<br />But I did recieve a call from customer service and she was very kind and offered me a full refund (without a return of the product) as well as a free item. I appreciate the gesture."
3.0,"Soft material, nice colors."
3.0,"These items were all supposed to be the same size based on the size chart that the items were chosen from. One of them is the right size, the other two.... not so much."
3.0,"Flimsy, small and difficult clasps, was disappointed."
3.0,It fit beautifully and is very flattering on BUT as the picture shows one ruffle is slightly smaller than the other and starts slightly higher than the other. The material is also on the cheap side. I'm keeping it though because I do like the look and no one in my family noticed the ruffle flaw until I pointed it out.
3.0,The ability to adjust the size.
3.0,"I can't put any of my ponytail hair inside the cap. I need to do a lower bun in the back out of the cap, which makes me prefer others that I have that fit better"
3.0,"Very small pendant. Son has multiple necklaces, this is least favorite."
3.0,"The watch is very nice looking, especially for the price. I bought this watch as a birthday present for my 9 year old who LOVES Fairy Tail. I was pleased to find the watch looked great, worked well, and was easy to program. However, the cover/sliding piece of the watch fell off within a few days. It literally lasted less than a week, and my son is not rough on his belongings. The watch looks great, but isn't constructed well."
3.0,"It's not a bad product.  However it didn't look like what we see (the image of the picture ) on this page. I was expecting a A line, semi flare knee length, but what I received was a A line, big flare midi length. I returned the item."
3.0,They wont last much. quality is poor. They look nice though
3.0,The lenses were scratched when they came in
3.0,"Not sure if it me or the way this looks , To sheer  you can see through the material so would have to wear a slip under it , and does not really hang as well as it looks in the pics. Looks like a blouse but no shape to it. It is ok to wear around , but not one of my best buys online for clothes."
3.0,"The fit mainly. The product itself is made well, just too loose fitting."
3.0,The flaps don’t seem to work. My glasses still fog up. I like the color.
3.0,"Low quality,bud you get what you pay for..overall no to bad"
3.0,The &#34;pink&#34; earrings are really like neon pink and the &#34;gold&#34; is bright and kinda looks tacky.
3.0,Loved the legnth of the Jacket. The material is flexable and has bit of stretch that is good for perfect fit. But I was disappointed in the color. I thought it would be plain red but it was not. I just wanted a red blazer. Got an off shade of red that I still hav'nt worn. Tags still on it wish I got exchange for the yellow/gold or the brown one Is it possible
3.0,I thought it was going to be bigger. A little small and quality is poor but cant ask for more for the price
3.0,Disappointed. Very nice quality but mostly feathers and wings. Not much I could use. I wanted paris inspired more beachy themes. Not a Harley girl
3.0,"I was very excited about getting this bracelet. Once I received it, it was too small, it didn't appear to have all of the same beads as the photo and some of the beads looked tarnished. I don't feel like it was worth the money"
3.0,"I bought the product a size big, and it fit my bust, but was too short for me. The dress is lovely but the roses are not white as shown in the picture, rather they are a blue/gray color. It is an okay product. It is not great but it was not terrible either."
3.0,It is decent but would be better if it was red
3.0,"not a bad product, it gets the job done,"
3.0,I’ve bought these sunglasses several times and one of the screws for the ear pieces always falls out.
3.0,"The zise came to small, its not fit me well; its ok for me"
3.0,These were a little difficult to keep on but they served their purpose.
3.0,Eh i had to return it i wasnt a fan of it maybe i have to get a smaller size and i might try to buy it one more time in a smaller size but i didnt like the way it looked
3.0,Long delivery. Quality ok. When putting light on one cannot make out the words. Not too clear. Gave to my kids to play with.
3.0,"This was just as described...looked great....wished the loops were a little bigger, but still loved by all"
3.0,"First, the ""one size "" label is probably for Asian customers, mine stretches to 37"", which was OK.  But the materiel is much lighter than one would expect for denim.  Mine weighed 9 oz on a postal scale, compared to a short (20"") denim skirt I have which weighs 13 oz.  OK for summertime, only."
3.0,"I purchased this as an &#34;upgrade&#34; band for my Moto 360 Gen 1.  The band is very nice, heavy and seems to be of sturdy quality however all this doesn't help when it's so heavy the watch rocks away from the charger enough to stop the charging.  I figured out that The band was so heavy it would leverage the watch away from the inductive charger far enough to either stop charging all together or cause it to slowly charge.  At this point I have elected to remove the band and use it as a paper weight on my desk.  If you have a different inductive charger that would allow you to lay the watch back down on it then this band would work well however without that, I'm out of luck.  Buyer beware it will be difficult to charge with this band on using the OE Motorola charger."
3.0,It’s very cute but I am disappointed the size seven dress I purchased has short sleeves.
3.0,Looked different  from picture when I received it.
3.0,"This jacket is for the skinny!  Luckily my son has a very thin build however,  living in the mountains of Colorado, this jacket still fits a bit snug when he has layers underneath...  If you are of average build or plus a few pounds, this jacket will NOT fit.  Length is ok, just runs very skinny.  Nice and warm as long as you can get it zipped up."
3.0,I loved the print on this dress and the material is thick. I ordered a size 6 which is what I normally would wear. It fit but was a little too snug. I am going to return it and am still debating on whether I should purchase a size up.
3.0,Love the dress in the picture. The dress I got doesn’t fit anything like the picture. It has a much higher waist. The print was very pretty.
3.0,"It’s pretty, don’t get me wrong - but the “rose gold” isn’t really rosy looking to me at all. It looks like a poor attempt at regular gold. The band is small. If you are have a few extra pounds on ya then find a way to ask for some extra links unless you like the band tight. I personally like it a little loose. Has some bling for sure and looks stunning in pics with flash."
3.0,"I LOVED this make-up of this top. It was simply beautiful to look at. However, the size is misleading. I bought it for my daughter...in a size bigger than she would normally wear. Smashed boobies and her arms in the shoulder holes not the actual sleeves. Now we laughed our butts off but there was no way it was going to fit."
3.0,"Thought ordered 3 difference pair because they all looked different on line.  When received all 3 are the same, who wants 3 pairs of the same sunglasses.  Need change your on line setting or something."
3.0,"&#34;18k gold&#34; This word on description should be deleted,not even closed description. But, the way the product was made and looks is good. I like how it drops against my neck and chest. I'm not expecting this to last forever, but, with careful use it will give you sometime of wearing it."
3.0,"Fabric is good quality, but neck is too lose and not soft enough, so when you down your head, color sticks your chin and neck."
3.0,"Everything looks good except the chain. It was broken and a poor attempt to replace. The broken ends were tied together with an off color wire , disappointing."
3.0,This runs small. My 10yr old is 126 lbs and Small was too tight
3.0,"Product shipped and received as expected, looks and wears nice, but none of the medicinal hype as advertised has been felt, no pain reductions, not stress or anxiety reduction."
3.0,"A little light weight. Don’t fold closed as compactly as others I have. But they are less expensive, so a definite case of getting what you pay for."
3.0,"I’m a 36D bust, 27 inch waist, 38 inch hips.<br /><br />I followed the sizing chart and bought the corresponding size to my measurements. When I tried the shirt on the bust was very tight, the waist was pretty tight, and the arms were several inches too short. I did not end up wearing these to work out as I was obviously returning them. The fabric did feel as though it would be good for moisture wicking. I would recommend sizing up in these unless you want a compression look. And I would not recommend for anybody with average to long arms unless you are looking for in above the wrist cut off."
3.0,"Bought these for my wedding.  Length is right but the strapping is too big.  I had it as tight as it could go and they flopped all over my feet.  By the end of the day I was developing blisters in multiple places.  Also the rhinestones get easy caught on a longer,  lacey dress.  Otherwise I really liked the extra padding for the sole."
3.0,"This is a nice sweatshirt with good material, well-stiched, but it runs quite small. I was hoping to get an oversized feeling with ordering a larger size. But it also runs short. So, I'll just be wearing it to bed on cooler nights, although the shortness isn't nice there, either. If you are petite, this might be a nice garment."
3.0,I thought it was over priced but I needed it.
3.0,"Great bra, great material and seems supportive but I’d say this bra runs at least one cup size smaller."
3.0,My waist size is 29m. Ordered small..  TOO BIG!!
3.0,"Really liked the Baleaf yoga pants, and waited for navy to come back, but it's not navy!  It's bright sapphire blue.  I am sorry I didn't return them."
3.0,There isn't enough width of Velcro on the sides to help keep them on tight around my toddler's ankle and lower calf. Therefore they don't stay on well at all. She just kicks them off.
3.0,"It’s soft but thick and breathable. Has a bit of a smell but that would go away.<br /><br />The main downfall of this mask is that it is sown unevenly. The nose part is not centered, one side of the mask under the eyes has a different shape than the other. Returning. If they fix that, it could be a good mask"
3.0,"When I got the product, I loved it. Came on time and looks awesome. I have not taking the studs of but remove the hoops every night. After 3 weeks of wearing the studs and not removing, it started to irritate my ears and causing minor scar tissue around the earring hole. Little disappointed because it looks so nice."
3.0,Pro- The straps fit my Garmin Vivoactive HR watch well. They are comfortable.<br /><br />Con- the don't hold up long term. The pin easily bent during normal use making the strap fall off constantly.
3.0,I don’t like them because they are straight leg and I hate straight leg.  I like boot or ankles. They fit . I got a size small - I’m 5/5 half 125 pounds. I’d never buy again.  Not my style unless you wear them as jammies.
3.0,"I bought this mask thinking it was bling so was disappointed by the printed fabric. It is lightweight and comes with two insertable filters. It is ok for everyday use, just not what I expected."
3.0,"I got a pack of these for my mom for mother’s day, my mom has never had crocs before so she was really excited, and especially about the charms. The next day they broke off, like broke off from the attachment part that actually goes inside of croc hole"
3.0,"Had to return item, bad fit and colors too bold"
3.0,Doesnt last as long as original.<br />Should be cheaper.<br /><br />Made in the US would be better.  QC in China IS questionable.
3.0,This dress was kind of a disappointment. It looked super cute online but when I got it it was really thin material and the hips had an awkward amount of extra fabric. It would probably be worth the money if it was $10 cheaper.
3.0,Can't understand the measurements.  Just need the shoe size numbers.
3.0,"This fits my Garmin 3 perfectly well, but the band is too long.  If you have small wrists, skip this one as the band doesn't have a smaller setting without have the band hang onto the watch face."
3.0,"Latch doesn’t last long. The band is pretty & attaches well to the Fitbit, but after wearing for about 3-4 weeks, the latch stopped holding, the Fitbit would fall off - not good when around bodies of water or swimming! To be fair, I do a lot with my hands I'm pretty rough on the things I own, so if you’re not active with your hands or willing to change to this for elegant occasions, this might still work well for you."
3.0,Like them but kind too big and loose but they are pretty love the material
3.0,"The seam ripped the day she wore it. You could tell the 2 pieces of fabric did not catch together when they made it. True to size, go up if you are in doubt about someone."
3.0,Need to return.  Was not flattering on me.  It is light and flowy.
3.0,I wear a size medium and had to order XL for this shirt not to look like a second layer of skin. Use it when playing volleyball and so far no issues
3.0,"The latch on the loop end is useless, once u open it once it undoes easily."
3.0,Doesn't fit my arm :/ wasted my money
3.0,Have enough card holders not true to the color the color green I got was a bit dead than the actual picture on Amazon nice quality for the price
3.0,Broke easily and had to be glued together.  Cheap ad expected. The only
3.0,"Really like the looks of these however, they don't stay locked and keep coming loose."
3.0,"Its beautiful, but does not come with lining or cami as the picture shows. It can not me worn alone, either wear it under someting or wear a cami under it. It also runs small."
3.0,I liked the dress. The material is soft and comfortable. The only thing I didn’t like were the slits. They aren’t high.
3.0,"I really like the shape of these earrings, but the stem is not attached in the center of the earring, but at one of the points of the triangle. That means they shift during the day and rotate around, migrating to different locations on your earlobe. Cute but would not buy again."
3.0,They are huge - which is great for me. I have concerns about the lenses staying intact for more than a few months but I guess we shall see. They are pretty light weight and come in a handy carrying case. They look great - I hope they hold up though.
3.0,Shirt is very thin material and after the first wash the pocket began to come off.
3.0,The cardigan is comfortable.  But heaven forbid you have biceps.  You won't be able to fit the arm comfortably.  Made for a slender abercrombie figure.
3.0,"Little tight,snug. Didn't like the material.<br />."
3.0,"fit large, more for man than woman."
3.0,"It's ok on the fit, kinda tight around the bust area."
3.0,The sweater is not like what is pictured. It has an odd shape.. boxy in the front with a longer back. It's not worth the hassle of returning and with the right outfit I can make it work. It is warm and lightweight which works perfect for cold Texas weather (not sure how well it would work for northern temperatures. It is more of a flannel/synthetic fabric than a woven fabric pictured in the ad. I typically wear a small/medium but I wanted an oversized chunky look so I ordered a large.. it's large but more sideways than length and it fits like a typical small/medium sweater would fit normally. I am 5'4 in height and the large sits right at the waist line and the back covers right below he bum. I have added pictures for reference.
3.0,I really like the look of this hat (and the price) but I do not like how hard it is to reshape it. It comes folded up which is great for easy travel but I wanted it to look more like the photo and I can't get the wavy-ness out of the brim. I have read instructions online such as using water to form and it let it dry but I still can't get it completely out. It will work for home/pool time but I probably won't use it when I am not at home.
3.0,"A pointelle weave is a type of knitwear or woolen fabric with small eyelet holes that creates a lacy effect.  The eyelets holes in this sweater are very wide and unless you are okay with showing a lot of skin and having your bra being completely exposed, you'll want to wear something under this sweater.<br /><br />I loved this sweater initially - it is very soft and comfortable.  Initially, it looked fantastic but it didn't wash up well after being laundered several times.  The material tends to pill and it takes on an ""old sweater"" look too prematurely making it best for casual wear.  It still looks nice - it's just has a more rustic look with the pilling."
3.0,Not a bad strap but one of the holes stretched out until the pin was in the next hole. Very soft leather if you get it wet. Also the clasp kept breaking free. I had to put a differentband on my watch. Threw this one way. I gave it three stars because if you're very gentle with it it's a pretty good value for the money. I wear my watch is 24 hours a day and in the shower.
3.0,"Something that i was afraid of....leaves a sticky residue once dried.....i do not think this product is ideal for fishing rods. Visually appealing, once applied, and covers little crevices, cracks and peelings on your cork products, but it leaves it feeling really sticky amd gluey..."
3.0,They are really nice shoes  but one came with like glue looking stuff on the front of the shoe. They did fit my son perfect size.
3.0,"Not what I expected. The stone is a dark opaque color & it is smaller than what the model on display is wearing in the description, but with that said it is a pretty little piece of jewelry"
3.0,Pants are cute but very see-through.
3.0,"Material is very synthetic and costumey looking. Was hoping for a lighter, more sleek look. Will be returning."
3.0,I  wore this one time and the zipper fell off! For the money spent on this that should never happen! I now have to spend additional money to get this zipper fixed. I should be refunded for this poor quality.<br />On a positive note it is very cute and comfy. Fit is accurate.
3.0,"These are cute, but they are WAY BIGGER then I thought they'd be. Also they are not as ""icy"" but more of the amber color."
3.0,Poor quality workmanship the fit is irregular and the sizes aren’t right ordered a 3 xl and it is a size medium I will not recommend this product
3.0,I thought I would love this shirt... but the cut was just all wrong. HUGGEEEE!!!
3.0,"I love this jacket, and for the most part can deal with some light rain. On the other hand, on my first day of owning it, I noticed that some of the stitching had already come undone"
3.0,They don’t really look like jeans so I kept one pair sent the other pair back
3.0,"Runs big. I’m 115lb, 5’9”, I ordered a medium because I’m used to this material shrinking. Size was more of a large. To lazy to return. Hoping for the best when I was it to fit properly"
3.0,Cute dress.  I wanted to like it.  The top part was too big.  Nice material and print was nice. I had to return because it was too big.
3.0,"I found this dress to be just average. It is a little sheer, but that's to be expected with white. The lace is pretty, but the material is much heavier than I expected and not particularly soft. I am 5'6,"" 142lbs and 36C bust, so I ordered medium based off the size chart and it was huge. There is no shape cut into this so the belt is necessary, otherwise it just hangs. I didn't like it enough to want to try size small and returned it."
3.0,A little tight around the calf.
3.0,Great bottoms.  Top is loose on me.
3.0,This Hoodie is alright .. it didn’t really fit how I wanted .. I would stay away from it ..
3.0,"This is very cute and the molecule part is well made and sturdy. I want to like this. Heck, I want to -love- this, but the chain turns my neck green every time I w,ear it. I have skin discoloration on my neck as is, so it looks low-key dirty in low light. Add a ring of green and I look really gross. I don't know if it's worth trying to replace the chain,, or coat it in clear varnish. The chain isn't QUITE long enough to wear comfortably on the outside of, say, a turtleneck. It's a quandry."
3.0,I really love this band but one screw  to keeps coming loose. Going to try gluing it. 😭
3.0,"I bought a size larger than I normally wear, I bought a large and normally wear a medium. With this being said it fits well. The bad thing is that I washed it as the tag says and the fabric started fraying down the seam leaving strands hanging everywhere. Otherwise that which maybe a manufacturing problem, it fits well and feels soft and comfortable."
3.0,"They seem like quality gloves, nice feel and work very well on smart phones. Unfortunately they're quite small. They are equal to about a size medium, possibly even smaller. So if you have larger than average hands these will NOT fit."
3.0,Nice robe but very tight fit
3.0,They are mostly comfortable but the part that goes between the toes needs to soften up some...they still bother me
3.0,"Took forever to be delivered, over a month! But it is super cute."
3.0,"This wallet is great. I bought it when my sister's birthday is coming, so I knew that her favorite color is pink so i decided to buy her a beautiful wallet. Cutie wallet such a nice and cool."
3.0,Why are the back pockets so tiny? Why would you design something like that?
3.0,Don't like how big the pendant is and the chain is WAY TOO LONG. Overall it's an okay pendant though. 3.7 out of 5.
3.0,"I like the dress, it fits well but way too see through, I had a difficult time finding just the right thing to wear underneath."
3.0,"was hoping to add a name/address ""sticker"" to the inside instead of hand writing my contact info, however not enough room. I  used this to secure 2 zipper pulls together for added security."
3.0,"The pendant is really pretty, but the metal is soft and because of that it isn't practical to wear. The little sun rays get caught on things , and bend way too easily."
3.0,A little thinner material than expected.
3.0,"Listen to your sisters on this one - I didn't and now am returning. The quality is fine, the fabric is soft to the touch and not plasticy feeling, the internal bra more supportive than a standard camisole shelf bra with removable cups and overall it's a good buy. Two things: 1) runs small in the XL, size UP by two at least, and 2) the straps aren't adjustable, but that wasn't a problem for me."
3.0,"This bag could be great if it had a hip belt, padded straps. Probably good for ultralite camping if your tent, stove, clothes and sleeping bag are under 20 pounds. After 20 pounds it got a little uncomfortable. I loaded it up with a intex Challenger 2, a pump, a towel, two paddles, 2l of water and snacks. It weighed about 35 pounds total. I was able to walk 1.5 miles with it to the river but the straps fold in on themselves and were digging into my shoulders. Not fun. If you need to carry a lot of weight, look elsewhere."
3.0,The earrings are a perfect size; cute and comfortable but one pair was broken before I even got a chance to wear it. You get what you pay for!
3.0,I was somewhat disappointed when I opened up the plastic bag it came in. I truly love the various gemstones and was happy to finally find a RED gem of this weight and ordered it with enthusiasm. The stone I received was green and orange. The picture showed a beautiful red gem. Now I am hesitate to select another stone from this seller or online. I will have to find the true red stone at a natural gem stone expo if I'm able to find one near me.
3.0,Beautiful design but the fabric is unlike anything I have ever worn.
3.0,Did not really care for them colors are not pretty cheap fabrics
3.0,I like the idea of these but they were way too small for my 9 and 11 year old.  It smooshed their noses  and they were super tough to get over their head.  I think these are meant for fairly young children.
3.0,"6 out of 40 lights did not work upon delivery. the others were given out as party favors so I'm not sure how they'll perform over time.  Paid $7.10, probably a bit too high for the percentage of product that did not perform."
3.0,"Returned because these ran small.  Definitely size up or maybe even 2 sizes up. Otherwise, nice leotard...just fit off."
3.0,"The letters are washed, planning to return it."
3.0,I like them and I dislike them because they do not clip-on to the glasses too well but they do have Clarity where you can see good out of them
3.0,"I like the shirt and need it for a party, but it runs small.  Be careful of your sizing."
3.0,The ball on Back is not big enough and post is too long.  I am going to bend in to an l shape stud to fix both problems.  CZ is beautiful.
3.0,Bought this for my 16 year old and it was way too big. It's cute but we plan to return it.
3.0,"Bag showed up quickly. It is not the same color as the photos (canvas color instead of white) and it is not as elastic as other bags I have purchased in this style. The net is tough but thin, which has me concerned about the strength of the sac. Will update the review after a few uses."
3.0,Only three of the six had the proper number of beads. Three had less than they should have. So I can not give as gifts. They are light in weight and comfortable to wear as a bracelet. I will wear one but only with the proper numbers of beads. I am a bit disappointed.
3.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for. But, 2 of the rivets came out of the belt after just a few days of use. Luckily I had some and was able to repair  it."
3.0,It runs a little small and it wrinkles very easily
3.0,It is an okay dress to wear around the pool.
3.0,"Arrived sooner then it said it would so that's a plus and I got 22 instead of 20 so another plus, but literally 8 were the exact same pink one and 4 were the same orange one. I bought it for my boyfriend so literally 12 will never be used. But great price lol"
3.0,It is very cute and the material is but it runs very small. I had to return it for a bigger size but then it was completely sold out.
3.0,This wallet is really cute.  Its practical. Looks very rich and stylish.  I get a lot of complements on it.  Matches with several of my purses. Its just really really thin.
3.0,Not a bad top. It has an almost papery feel but I think that's because it's inexpensive. For the price it does the trick.
3.0,I didn't realize it was so tiny in width. I can barely see it.  Do you have anything wider?
3.0,While I knew the arm holes were large that would have been fine but it hung so the my side boob was showing. Obviously I’m wearing a sports bra but it was just too open.
3.0,"Weird material, feels cheaply made and it seemed to make her itchy. It’s cute though, I use it for pictures!"
3.0,I like that they are neutral and go well under shorts for girls. The material is a little thin though.
3.0,I'm 5'5&#34; 130lbs and it was a little loose all around.  Did not flatter me at all. It was also a few inches from the ground and I prefer my maxi dresses to be touching when I'm bare foot.
3.0,"great quality bands but received a headband not 2 wrist bands like shown in picture, when i realized it was wrong my son had allready worn and sweated in so not returnable,would love wrist bands to complete his baseball uniform"
3.0,"These run small, order a size up. Had to return so can't say much more except they will charge you to return them."
3.0,"These gloves were too small for my hands. But also, they came covered with lint/dust on them, as if they'd been sitting out on a shelf for a long while. I returned them."
3.0,"First pair arrived HUGE (as warned by many reviews). Over an inch too big, and I used their sizing chart!! Returned, ordered a size smaller and still big. Reluctant to order another, so just saving to grow into"
3.0,They're great if you've got long legs or can tailor them.
3.0,Great looking a little cheanly made
3.0,"Took 2 weeks to get here, but other than that it's awesome."
3.0,Donated to Salvation Army. Size way smaller rhan expected
3.0,For my 83yr old mom. She loved it. Very pretty
3.0,I’m not like a large to extra-large and I feel like I took it to its full extent and it just fits so make sure your small or smaller than the size you order
3.0,I really liked the quality of this mask but it was too tight for my son. It shrank even more when we washed it. The sizes seem to be inconsistent.
3.0,This case wadsn't deep enough for my large frame shades
3.0,Nice fabric but cheap clip. Broke right away. Recommend to manufacturers to use plastic. I easily fixed with a bra clip.
3.0,"This item was beautiful, but it looks like some is longer than the other and it look very old. But still it had good impression."
3.0,"I love the purse, however, I had to return it because it just doesn't work as a shoulder bag. The straps are too small; very uncharacteristic of a tote."
3.0,"Did not come with a charm. Other than that, it is as described"
3.0,It's more like a costume than a daily wear shirt material.
3.0,these are fine but not special. too oddly shaped
3.0,"This is a cheap quality locket. I was looking for something fun, yet practical and durable for my kid. This fell apart the second time she wore it."
3.0,"This dress is super adorable, comfy and flowy. The only problem is the bust area, it is not made for anyone with big boobs (DD). I am so bummed that I can’t wear this dress because I love it so much! But even after sewing the buttons on the chest, it pulls in weird areas and is too tight. The rest of the dress fits perfectly!"
3.0,Strange fitting
3.0,It was a bit too thin for my liking. It reminded me of a juniors section dress rather than something appropriate for work (if that makes sense).
3.0,"Nice jacket, but the zipper broke after a few months. Didn't even last a yr. If u have a cleaners who does a zipper repair cheap then this is a good jacket."
3.0,The color peeled off the black pair. It's just painted on. The other colors all seem fine.
3.0,These pants run a bit big. They are not suitable for hiking because they are big and not waterproof. They are great for atving as you cab put other layers underneath.
3.0,Some what small around the bust area. Love the pockets. Nice flow.
3.0,There is a hole in it i still wear it
3.0,"So I was looking for something I could use in a professional setting with business attire.<br />This is a nice item however it is a thin material so  purely decorative purpose like religious reasons or costume purposes, Which did not fit my needs. I also though it was gaiter style and is not so when I had it outside it would fly into my face so I couldn't see. I think it's a good product, just didn't suit my needs."
3.0,"Good fit. Stretchy and comfortable. Pads do not stick to fabric. Literally cannot adhere and doesn’t stay put. Very disappointing to not figure this out as the manufacturer, that their ladies undies are not period friendly."
3.0,Cute but won’t stay in place
3.0,"So let me say.. I have a workout legging addition. Which means I have over 60 pair of them ranging from 140$ all the way down to 10$. These are one of my cheapest pairs, but they don't feel as cheap as say, a forever 21 pair of workout pants, which actually cost more than these. They remind me a bit of the gymshark original flex legging material except not as breathable. The fabric is thin but feels rather hot, which I don't love, but not a deal breaker. The inseam is to short for me, but I'm 5'8&#34; with a 34&#34; inseam so I'm used to that. The waist is not as tight as I'd like. I'm a power lifter so last thing I want to worry about is having to keep pulling up my pants when I'm lifting. I got the S/M. Wish there was an XS/S option. I'm 143lbs and a size 4 in Lululemon. There was also a ton of loose threads on the inside of the legs, which I cut but leads me to believe they would easily get a tear or run. Personally I don't think I'll workout in these but I wore them out and about today and they were fine for that.I like how they look on my butt since theres no compression they let your muscles/curves show well, which I prefer no compression. We work hard for that booty girls show it off! For the price these are ok. Better quality than forever 21 or Danskin and cost less than those brands. Would I buy more? No, but will I wear these at least till they rip? Yes, just not to train in."
3.0,Chronograph hand did not line up with 12 o clock so I exchanged for another one. The second one was better but still not great. There is/was a lot of lash in the gears of both samples I got and the chronograph hand would move based on how the watch was oriented. At this price it's fine.
3.0,"Small is wayyyy to big. They should have included a fabric belt to allow smaller waist girls the ability to cinch it. I felt like i was wearing a paper bag. Pattern and colors are great but the fit isnt flattering. Wont wear again, getting donated"
3.0,Thin and not the quality you expect from this price point. I should have known better because I've had this problem with everything I have ever purchased from Bradford.
3.0,"These are the SERIOUS cutest but HOLY CRAP they are gigantic. I ordered according to the age and should have just measured my kid's feet. Hopefully by the time she grows into them, she'll be ok wearing such flimsy shoes (I originally bought them as she was learning to walk, but by the time she fits into these, she'll be driving...)"
3.0,"These earrings will enhance a ""southwest"" themed party costume.<br />Has nice quality wires. A molded silver setting with a synthetic stone? They will be  gifted to a girl child."
3.0,This is fun and appears to be well made but the fabric sheds VERY BADLY when it's washed. I have now washed it multiple times and it's finally a little better. It is holding up well to all of the washings so that's good.
3.0,In seam too short for 6' male  35 waist  36 was ok and comfortbale but cheap in quality  Easy return
3.0,"this is exactly what the hubby wanted but after just a few wearings (he does have a big head) the material is seeming to turn in on itself and the white insides are starting to poke out the black print..... it looks ok still, just little white fuzzies all over it but wondering if there is a better material?"
3.0,Smaller than expected but warm and comfy
3.0,it's fine underwear
3.0,I measured per the size chart. Should have gotten them a size smaller.
3.0,"Not sized as described. Very small. Fit my toddler's waist perfectly, tho was supposed to fit a six year old according to size guide. Quality of materials and workmanship are the.only reasons this gets any stars. Beautifully made. Super soft tulle. Lovely fullness. Were I in need of a tutu for a toddler I wouldn't hesitate to purchase again. However, given I needed this to fit a first grader I will be returning."
3.0,"They are cute, but the fit is too small for a two year old toddler whose feet are size 6.5"
3.0,"It's all right, I guess, but would have been happier if it actually shipped with the wrist thingy. Mine didn't have one. Also, not much room for other things. Would have been better if of the zipper compartments had a compartment dividing it, so there'd be more room for things like cards and bits of paper we tend to carry around in our wallets."
3.0,"This band took over an hour to take pins out. It’s still too big on a normal wrist. The adjustment tool has broken twice (which I now know is why they include 2 replacement heads). The pins are cheap and break/bend easily. I need to take our 2 more links but await a later point once my patience returns. In its present state it’s still too loose on wrist, the watch face flops about. The last 2 links were very difficult to unpin, and between this and the pin tool breaking so easily, I gave up."
3.0,cute dress but the sizing is a lilttle bit off.
3.0,I like the earthy design
3.0,Loved  the neck line
3.0,"Not for anyone with bigger calves, they only go part way up.  If you are larger calves, order other ones that are wide or you will be pulling them up all day."
3.0,dont like how it look on me
3.0,"Nice fabric, but too small! I wear an XL & to be safe I purchased a 2X, it would fit a 10 year old"
3.0,"Was disappointed to get the very long, heavy bobby pins.  The other orders I made were shorter and less conspicuous. The web page did not prominently state these were bigger than the standard size.  Too heavy for most hair."
3.0,"Fit was great (make sure to reference the sizing chat). It is very breathable and light. My only problem is that it is so thin that it is practically transparent. If that's not an issue to you, then you'll love it."
3.0,"Small, flashy, bright. Hard to pin on shirt as they attach with only a small safety pin."
3.0,"Thin, for fashion only, Will not hold up to washing, good for one season of wear only."
3.0,"I brought this band for another watch, Pebble Time, not a Seiko Z22, since it was slightly longer than the official Pebble Time bands.  Unfortunately, band material was too thick to fit the pins into the the Pebble Time.  The band is thick and the measurements given are accurate and it probably fits the watch it is made for perfectly.  The material is stiff but perfect for a dive watch and looks very durable. Just don't buy it for another watch and expect it to fit."
3.0,Back falls off occasionally
3.0,"Bought for daughter’s dorm. It is as soft as it looks. Only 3 stars because it is not supposed to go in the dryer. Sorry, but my daughter is not that careful with laundry and I thought this was just a wash and wear like everything else she’ll be washing at the laundromat."
3.0,My little girl wears a size 6 so I thought they would be a little small. They actually too big. Probably won't order clothes from Amazon again.
3.0,"Cute dress if you are very petite. I have a longer waist, so this dress does not work for me at all. Fabric is cute and the print is nice, it just runs short and wide."
3.0,I'm 5'8' and 145lbs. I typically wear both mediums and larges ...it just depends on the fit as I am smaller in the waist but definitely have more in the hip/thigh region.  I bought a large after reading the reviews and taking into account the sizing from the vendor. I'd say these are cute for running around the house but they ended up being too loose in the waist to wear for any running or squatting... the fabric is pretty thin so it's a definite no go for the weight lifting class.  They fit ok while I wore them at home but as soon as I started running in them on a treadmill they started sliding down.
3.0,Ok beads for cheap
3.0,"Who would put rayon in a sweatshirt?<br />Unless I'm missing a few decades, rayon needs to be dry cleaned.<br />I'm gonna pay 16.00 every time I wash a 6.00 sweatshirt? Glad the product isn't for my use.<br />Hope the person I gifted it to reads the washing instructions.<br />The sizing appeared to be Asian sizing. But the person I bought it for is petite.<br />What's up with the cotton industry?<br />Nothing right? Just have to pay 100.00 for the sweatshirt."
3.0,If you're looking for a photo shoot dress for your little one...this is perfect. The material is very fragile and did not hold up well even hand washing and air drying. And the belt is huge...it fit me.
3.0,Cute but fell apart within minutes of my daughter putting it on. The seams came apart. It was not tight at all. Very loose. Poor quality.
3.0,Lasted a week before ripping unfortunately. A lot softer of a material than I expected. I liked them a lot. A shame they ripped so soon.
3.0,"Too small and when you advertise these earrings advertise the real size, I was disappointed in thesize"
3.0,"Aw these were so cute but were far too small. I had to send them back, unfortunately."
3.0,I really really wanted this to fit. The colors were so pretty and vivid but this top runs extremely small. The xxl might fit a size 10-12. If it fits you you will love it.
3.0,"Fits a bit too tight, but otherwise covers your face."
3.0,It’s very flowly and I love the adjustable straps. Great for someone who’s 5’3” and has a hard time finding longer dresses. I just can’t help the seam issues in the front. It’s all I notice!!! Not a fan and I will be returning. Maybe a different pattern would be better as I like the material and flow. The pockets were a little low for me as well.
3.0,"Shirt wasn't as flowy as I thought it would be, and it was see through so had to wear tank top under it but I like it!"
3.0,"i did NOT receive any discount nor did i get these for free. i paid full price.<br /><br />They actually arrived much sooner that expected. The rings are ok. They didn't really fit my fingers and I don't have huge fingers. The leaf one only fit my pinky. But it's ok, I will make due with them. They are still cute. I wish I had gotten silver though instead of gold. But you do get what you paid for. They are fine for costume jewelry for teens that might be constantly losing jewelry. They are easy to bend so be careful on that."
3.0,Love it but too small.
3.0,These glasses were too big for my 2 year old.
3.0,"SUPER cute but too big for my daughter, hard to figure out the size."
3.0,"These are super, super thin. Soft and comfy, not cotton feeling, more of a silk feel. They run very large and can really only be used to sleep in or lounge around the house in. I wear mine with long tunic tops, thats about the only way they can be worn out of the house."
3.0,"I love the look of these but as I am 5'5"" and 108 lbs, the Smalls fit but are SO VERY loose because of how stretchy they are. If they had XS im sure id LOVE them, but I will be returning."
3.0,Its cute but the ring is easily broken.
3.0,It fit exactly as I expected but it broke within a month
3.0,"Super cute but not comfortable. I tried these on in the house and walked around for a bit and could tell if I wore them out, they would kill my feet. Sad to return them because they're super cute but not the comfortable night out shoe that I need."
3.0,This was purchased for a gift as a four pack of socks.  Upon opening I was surprised to see that there were only two styles of socks in the box. Four pairs with duplicate styles.  Very disappointing.
3.0,The closure stopped working after just a few uses.
3.0,"My daughter is 17 months.  I bought a 2T but its a little snug, the shoulder straps made a mark on her shoulders.  I bought it a little big so hoping to use it by this summer but seems like it wont last a few more months."
3.0,I'm normally a 81/2 but with the toe print already laid out for you it doesn't fit me right.
3.0,Very cute little outfit.  Fits as it's supposed to.  Nice and vibrant colors.  Nice graphics to the outfit.  My only complaint is that it's not very soft.  The material is not very breathable. The material is stretchy. Lots of room to grow.  This complaint is not enough to prevent me from continuing to buy the in the future.  I got this product on sale which makes it even more appealing.  Definitely worth the money on sale.  However I would not buy this product full price.
3.0,Hard to snap on and one of the enclosures became loose when I tried to snap it on.  Ruined a whole ring first time I tried to put it in.
3.0,"the 24 inch is not expandable you shouldn't put that as the title EXPANDABLE SUITCASE bought it thinking it was but ONLY THE 28 INCH IS EXPANDABLE, other then that it seems alright."
3.0,"The design is gorgeous, however a few minutes into wear the post fell off the resin on one earring. An easy fix with super glue, but still disappointing with such little wear."
3.0,Marked as a work tote but not big enough to hold a laptop
3.0,"It was missing a couple of rhinestones, but nothing glue can't fix!"
3.0,its okay. it was kinda big.fabric was thin.
3.0,"No size was mentioned in ad so I assumed it was nickel sized for the coin. Nope. coin is almost 2 inches in diameter, making this a big buckle."
3.0,Dress runs very small😪
3.0,I love it! The beads  are 18k gold plated as well as the clasp but the jewelry stoppers that holds the beads on the string is just metal it fades and that’s my only issue  but over all it’s a well put together bracelet
3.0,"Great color, nice fit, washes well, but of course, because it's satin, it can get very warm. May be perfect for colder temperatures."
3.0,"Not quite as pictured, stones are smaller and opal more glass then opal"
3.0,The metal bends easily and several rhinestones had fallen out by the time I received it.  But it still is cute!
3.0,Very comfy I think I just needed to go s size down!!!
3.0,They are comfortable I wish they had sold half sizes. The tan color has a bit of green in it.
3.0,"Poor fitting, too wide and too short  hips."
3.0,Shirt didn’t fit as expected.
3.0,It's a little low
3.0,"Fit was tight for my regular size. Should have adhered to the advice on the other reviews.  The material was a bit lighter/thinner than my perception from the picture.  Looks like it will wear out sooner than later. I will say it is a great looking shirt in person, loved the rustic and worn down appeal of it."
3.0,Nice hat good quality accept for plastic snap to change size very cheap would not recommend this hat to a friend
3.0,Too small for me so I gave it to a petite friend.
3.0,I ordered a small which I can wear. I'm 5'7 and 130 pounds but the small sucked the life out of me!!!! I have smalls in other yoga pants and they fit great!!! NOT THESE!!! Cute pattern but they are going back.
3.0,Returning. Looks nothing like the picture. Cheap looking
3.0,"Only one button. Doesn't stay on, takes a while to come on when pressing the button to show the time. Hard to set time."
3.0,I love how cute this is but wish it was a zipper instead of buttons. Takes forever to change a diaper. Also it’s starting to fade and not look as good after only 5-6 wears
3.0,It sheds a lot
3.0,Funny but falls off your head a lot
3.0,"Cute dress. Design is cheap-ish! Not the type of dress that looks like you paid a ton of money for it, but it serves a purpose. I don't hate it, but haven't worn it anywhere yet."
3.0,just wish the width were a little wider to get things out of it.
3.0,Cute dress. I gave it a 3 cause the material was okay and I wish I ordered a larger size.  I have a long torso.  It was a little short
3.0,"It's alright looking, doesn't stay very well till you tighten the cuff on your ear and a normal lope piercing would help"
3.0,"I thought the fabric might give a little.  A little snug in the chest area, I am 38 DDD and I had ordered an XL.  Hit me about ten inches below the knee, I am 5' 9""  It would probably need ironing.  I returned it."
3.0,I got this just for between getting out of outdoor pool and running to the shower. I wear a size 8; ordered a L and it's OK for what I use it for but certainly not roomy.
3.0,It was a little tighter than I expected.
3.0,"These earrings are as described. They are larger than I wanted, but it is my fault for not paying closer attention to the size."
3.0,a bit smaller than expected but still lovely
3.0,"This dress is made of thick fabric and is a little heavy.  It would be great for keeping you warm in colder weather.  The fabric fees comfortable on the skin.  The dress runs really big for a bodycon item.  I could have gone down a size or two.  I will definitely have to have it taken in.<br /><br />One thing I really don't like it the neck has an unfinished look.  It takes away from the look of the dress, in my opinion."
3.0,I ordered this dress in white. It is VERY see-through. It’s a cute dress if you wanna wear it as a bathing suit cover. Kinda bummed. The material is very thin as well. Just something to keep in mind.
3.0,"Really good quality, but they are larger than I would have liked. They are about 1 CM in size"
3.0,These are cute  good quality
3.0,Ring looked great for the first few months. Here I am 6 months in and you can’t even was the design on it anymore. I work a desk job so it’s not beat on much but it’s still on my hand every day. Great product but wish it lasted longer than 6 months and having to buy another one.
3.0,i found these to be on the  bulky side .
3.0,Not as advertised. The lenses aren’t as dark as soon. Very thin frames.
3.0,Look cute to large
3.0,It was described as a snakeskin pattern but was checkered instead.
3.0,Sheds... but it’s cute
3.0,Loved the leggings but then I went to work out did some squats and I heard a tear. There’s a rip in the butt already so that’s really disappointing.  One time use I guess.
3.0,Too big material is not that comfy but its a cute shirt! Will be ordering in another color a smaller size
3.0,Nice watch. Main issue doesn't keep time. But then again what do you expect for the price.
3.0,Bought two one was missing stones
3.0,"Shield is a thicker plastic and was folded. The crease adds to the difficulty seeing through it. Hat size is good for me , but seems to run small."
3.0,My wife bought this hat thing for our daughter's wedding and she looked funny in it. That's all I'm saying.
3.0,"This thing is adorable. The material, however, feel like cheap super thin cotton. Feels like something my grandma could make. That isn’t a bad thing, but, like... if I wanted an adorable apron made by grandma, I’d commission her to do so. Not order it from a cheap Amazon seller. Not really worth it."
3.0,"This is not leather.  I asked them to correct their description but they have not.  It is lovely, though"
3.0,Better in picture
3.0,"I am 5ft tall 117lbs, disproportionate with small waist and chest and large hips and thighs. The medium was comfortable on the bottom but huge on top. I think it would have been off on someone with good proportions. But beautiful and good quality."
3.0,The metal used is NON-HYPOALLERGENIC! It will rot your neck in 24 hours. Buy some silk cord if you have the same issue.
3.0,I think they’re absolutely adorable but 2 pairs were broken<br />😩
3.0,The headbands were not the size that I expected but they would do for that price!!!
3.0,"I've bought 7 pair of this brand. They look and feel great for the money. I usually break them in the first few months because I just throw them where ever, thankfully they're not expensive. I had to return a pair I recently received because they were already broke, don't know if its because of manufacturing or the packaging. If they would package these in boxes and stick a non trash looking carrying case in with it, the reviews would be higher."
3.0,Products is definitely too small normally wear M-L<br />Most likely will need XL or XXL<br />Fabric not too scratchy but still polyester store quality
3.0,I wanted to love these but they need some work. The pattern/cut needs to be adjusted so that there's more room for the bum. Fabric needs a little bit more stretch and a lot more softness.
3.0,"I was so excited to get this skirt. I loved the photos of it. I am usually a medium, but when I tried it on it was too big in the hips, and if you gather the front up with the tassel tie, it fits very odd and poofy, the fabric is stiff. Darn it! I really wanted this to be one of my favorite skirts!"
3.0,"This top (not quite a tunic) is soft, comfortably oversized and would be a slightly lighter weight alternative to a sweatshirt if not for a couple of problems.  The stripes on the sleeves are made of a waffled material, rather like thermal underwear material, are a bit on the skimpy side.  They are a bit smaller than the rest of the sleeve and so bind just a little when I move my arms.  The other issue is purely cosmetic.  The colors are not quite as pictured, are not color combinations I would have thought to put together and the material edging the bottom hem does not really match anything else, it is close to the color of one of the stripes but not exactly.  Having four different colors and two different types of fabric in this one garment makes it appear, in my opinion, rather as though it was made out of scraps of fabric left over from other items.<br /><br />I'll probably wear this as an 'at home' item."
3.0,"My oldest son picked this out for my youngest son for a Christmas gift. He loves it! BUT within a few days of wearing it the ""leather"" cord broke. He loves it so much he asked that I just tie it again for him. I did that 4 times before I cut it off and tied a different cord onto the ring."
3.0,"returned, didn't like style of front oversized flap. quality seemed good. I usually wear a 8-8.5 and  I tried these in both 8 and 9, I would preferred the 8. They were tight but I expect they would have stretched plenty and the inside fluff would have smooshed down."
3.0,"The watch for the money is pretty decent, doesn’t feel like anything great. The thing just looks awkwardly small for my wrist and I don’t feel comfortable wearing it. It makes me look like I got a little kids watch out of a happy meal and started wearing it everyday."
3.0,These are good compressions socks. I just have a very hard time trying to get them on and off. They are worth the price.
3.0,I had to have it shortened because it was too long and I am not crazy about it.  It is ok.
3.0,Nice watch but the band fell apart after six months.  Not able to find a replacement band at locally and will have to contact Anne Klein company directly.  Good value and Nice watch is now a pain in the wrist!
3.0,Begin to feel the weather in the teens.
3.0,It’s very tight and snags easily but the length is adequate for someone who is taller
3.0,Its nice tho
3.0,"Bonito, pero la tela no es suave, es incómoda, la entrepierna del pantalon es incómoda al caminar"
3.0,"I unboxed it and when i tried to put it on it didnt open.W,T,F I spend my money on this"
3.0,"XL - 160 lbs - 5'5&#34;<br />I really like Vivilli tops, have several. I have this style with sleeves. Without sleeves just doesn't seem as stylish, but is OK. That's a  personal taste. I think it's  the bulkiness around hips in what will be summer clothes. Again this has  nothing to do with quality, but taste. Kept it."
3.0,Since relieving these my daughters skin irritations have disappeared. However the metal coloring has already changed to a much darker shade
3.0,Not really my style but I think I'll keep it anyway and use as a housedress.  The color is pretty.  I mostly sleep in this dress because it is super comfortable but a little matronly looking.
3.0,Good quality good product<br />Runs bout 1/2 size small
3.0,"Too big, better for people who are tall and not pear shaped but good material. I’m 5’4 128 lbs and the small was way too big. Also the pockets made me look wide."
3.0,The lining in the right glove came loose at the tip of the fingers. At first it was annoying the the lining stated to fall apart then it was down right uncomfortable.
3.0,"The bracelets are a little large on both myself and on my boyfriend. They also pull arm hair, ouch!! Seem to be quality products though."
3.0,Like but thought it was smaller when I ordered
3.0,I loved this dress it was comfortable and fit perfectly. I alway loved that is has pockets.
3.0,It was okay but the torso could have been longer
3.0,"I liked this Bra when I first put it on, but after one wash/ wear the padding seems misshaped and a little too much cleavage for my gym. It is cute and I may try to wear it in the summer if I have an open backed top."
3.0,It took this product over a week to come in. Then it seem to run large in size.
3.0,Not as long as it shows in the picture.  Nicely made and very pretty otherwise.
3.0,This runs very small not what I expected sending it back
3.0,"it fits really well i like them but the material on the white seems thin and see through, compared to hanes and gildan brand"
3.0,The shoe that fit looks great but the other one had been stretched out and I can walk out of it. Going to return them
3.0,"The sole itself is the perfect size for my foot, but the braided straps were super tight and uncomfortable on my foot. I’m going to try wearing big socks with them and blow drying them to try to stretch the straps"
3.0,Very cute but piece fell off immediately. My husband super glued it and it fell off again at the Birthday party.
3.0,Very cute masks. Way to big for children face. We decided to keep them for ourselves.  The stitching overlaps. Writing it scrunched towards the nose bridge making it hard to make out word.  Does not look as pictured.
3.0,"Wrinkles really easily, not the greatest fabric. But still wearable and cute."
3.0,strings are sticking out<br />there was a mark on the hood from an improperly stitched seam<br />uneven distribution of filler
3.0,"Product was okay, I would definitely size up from what you originally are bc it does shrink a little bit in the dryer so I would size up but other than that it’s a pretty good product"
3.0,"I believe I ordered the x-large, but tight around the bust area"
3.0,Too tight around the ankles
3.0,"I expected this to be shaped for women, but this shirt was quite odd. It is like a big short square. No shaping to it, whatsoever. Other than that, the material is also a bit cheap feeling and the length of it is on the short side. Stitching is all well done. Color is a bit brighter than the image. Could be a good work shirt. Just not what I thought it would be."
3.0,"Loved the color and length, but the waistline was too high and not at natural waist."
3.0,I really like the look of this sweater!  It's thick and warm and the slouchy/chunky look is super flattering and perfect for fall.  My big issue with it is the chemical/dye smell.  I immediately washed it upon opening it (and it held up nicely in the wash - I air dried as I usually try to do with sweaters).  After the wash the smell decreased considerably but is still there enough that I decided not to wear it this morning.  One more run through the washer may help but definitely takes away from how much I like the sweater..
3.0,"Ring is nice, and heavy, however mine is missing the gold color on the band in a few spots."
3.0,Its a very pretty dress but a bit short. I'm 5'5&#34; and it's just at the bottom of my knee. The length on the picture is much more graceful. I wish there was an option to order a longer length.
3.0,This  is a very pretty bathing suit but I would not recommend it for heavy chested women. The bottoms fit great for somebody with curves and are very flattering. The material is very soft and durable and holds up well when washed. My only complaint was the way that the cups fit sense they are  an underwire and patted shape for heavier chested women it does look to be a little cramped.
3.0,It tore after about a month where you insert the clasp.
3.0,"I’m updating my review now that I have actually worn the costume. After only wearing for a few hours, most of which was spent sitting down, one side of the corset is frayed and coming apart. Also the corset really needs to be longer! The skirts kept slipping down no matter how tight I tied the drawstring. I am very disappointed!<br /><br />First impression<br />I’m 5’2”, 145lbs normally wear a M to L in tops & size 10 pants, ordered size L-XL. Haven’t worn it out yet only tried it on. So this comes as 4 pieces. Long skirt, over skirt, shirt and bodice. The skirts are full and look huge, but instead of an elastic waist they have pull strings. The material is light and thin. The long skirt was very long on me, but I am short! The shirt is also made from a thin material and definitely see through if worn without the bodice. The shirt has a gathered stretchy middle and long length. The bodice is well made and honestly the whole reason I purchased this. The color looks just like the listing photo.  It fits me snuggly when fully laced up and I’m not large or small chested just somewhere in the middle. I do wish it were a little bit longer though."
3.0,"longer than anticipated, still serves its purpose however"
3.0,"The pattern is beautiful, but the shirt is too short. My baby’s belly kept popping out."
3.0,"These bracelets are cute and exactly what I wanted. However, the pieces which are tied on (gem, tree, tassel) all broke the first day I wore them. I've made a lot of jewelry, so I repaired them without issue, but don't expect them to last."
3.0,Nice but the beads are falling apart
3.0,It smelled terrible and the buttons were rusted! After alot of cleaning it turned out to be a nice bag.....but the smell took a week to get rid of..
3.0,"I bought this bag as a gift for my daughter and she liked it as soon as she got it.  When she got home to swap the old for the new she went to zip it and the zipper broke, so it will be returned. Not very happy with this bag."
3.0,"I guess I expected something a bit more durable or heavy, if that makes sense. It is a very cheap material and I have a feeling it may peel with excessive use. It is cute for sure but not what I thought it was going to be made of."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:692b1726ea7e26665fd4466af41ee0ee]]
3.0,"Product works, but the ring that is turned by the crank handle tends to break easily after sun exposure and should be made of metal, not plastic."
3.0,"dress fits cute except the top area. If you are top heavy do not bother, I had to give it away."
3.0,My niece loved these for Christmas
3.0,"I posted a question about the size before i ordered. I was told to order bigger which im glas i did. It fits fine. Im not super impressed with the quality though. The material is think and comfey but as you can see in the picture the letters are curved. My shirt, however the letters are straight across which in my opinion makes it look cheap. Would i buy it agan? Probably not, but since it was a decent price, ill keep and wear it."
3.0,"Product is used for sliders on a leather strap for a bag.  Slightly thinner than I hoped, but works well on nylon webbing and 4-6 oz. Leathers."
3.0,Fits long/big. Weird fitting hoodie.
3.0,"I'm a little too nervous to wear this. It's super cute, but it seems like it could break easily. I still love how it looks!  Came better than I thought, but it seems too easy to break. I haven't yet, but I think I will every time I wear it."
3.0,Did not fit well n material wasn’t soft
3.0,"Runs small. My daughter was unable to fit comfortably in it, but we were able to re-gift it to a younger family member."
3.0,Arm holes are large so it hangs funny
3.0,They were nice when we got them but they broke within four days
3.0,Very nice set that didn't come with all the post.
3.0,"Need to really be careful, the size chart is very different from America."
3.0,the material is not cotton it actually a spandex material which gives more of a formal dress look instead of  summer dress
3.0,"This is a pretty cheaply made set. However, for the price (I paid $12 for the XL), you can't beat it for a photo prop. It does have a chemical smell when it comes but it washed out easily. Tag says handwash but I did it inside out in a mesh laundry bag and washed on a quick, gentle cycle. The smell was gone and it came out fine. I ordered the XL for my big 9 month old. She is about 29&quot; long and 20 lbs. The onesie and bow fit perfect but the pants were way too big. It looked really cute in pictures even without the pants. You will notice the black onesie has white &quot;cracks&quot; when you stretch it, but it wasn't noticeable with wear. I would recommend this for pictures though not sure how it would hold up with extended wear. I also wouldn't pay $20 for this but at $12 felt it was a good deal."
3.0,"I love the style of this dress, but fabric is very thin. I bought the black in a medium. I'm 5'8&#34; 128lbs 32dd the breast area covers fine, but is hard to get the side boob  to not gap open. I was hoping the dress would be long enough, but its about 2&#34; too short.  Forever 21 is selling the exact dress for double so snag it here ladies."
3.0,Too big on top but too small on the bottom. Otherwise it is beautiful. Lace is very pretty
3.0,T-shirt is fine but jeans are tiny
3.0,"These are pretty nice to have. My coworkers haven't noticed my piercing in the 3 months I've been at work. The top is thin and lies flat on the nose, it's matte so there's no light reflecting off it.  I cut the top of one retainer smaller and filed it smooth with a nail file and wear that one mostly since you would have to be up in my face to notice it, but I'd wear either one and be confident that no one would notice.<br />The inner ball isn't exactly smooth so I have to take it out slowly. I've accidently yanked it out a couple times (taking off glasses, washing my face, snag on shirts/blankets) and boy toes it hurt and get inflamed on account of the not so smooth inner ball. That would be my main complaint. For the price, i didnt expect perfection I'm going to order another set, since I've almost lost one already, best to have some extras handy."
3.0,"I definitely like the style and color of the wedge. It looked amazing, however, it is not comfortable for long periods of time. feels like I am walking on my toes the whole time and it was a bit tight around my toes which made my toes feel like they were going numb. Would not buy again"
3.0,Nice shirt but don’t have a beer belly if you want to wear them. For the young fit guys or buy a size larger.
3.0,"The dress is okay, the fabric is a little stiff but I’m hoping after a few wears and washes it will soften up."
3.0,"I returned this vest because the length was about 3"" too long for me. The fleece was what I expected and fit fine elsewhere. I'm 5'4""."
3.0,the necklace was as advertised but the pendant is so small it’s more suitable for a child in my opinion. I bought it as a gift for myself but i will “re-gift” it to one of my nieces.
3.0,"True to size and super cute but it's so itchy, washing it made it slightly softer but it feels like itchy wool."
3.0,"The colors look exactly the same. It is way longer and wider than I thought it would be.. pretty big scarf. Material is sheer as shows. Thought it would softer/smoother feeling. Not a horrible purchase, but not exactly what I was looking for."
3.0,These turn your finger green!
3.0,This suit was 4T. My granddaughter is petite 36 pounds and it fit her perfectly from the hips up. However. the crotch and leg holes were way too big and drooped at the bottom of the crotch. Even though it was a one piece suit the bottom part was cut different and probably 3 sizes too big. She had to wear shorts under it.
3.0,This strap was well constructed and looked fine — it just was not right for me. The color was off so it did not match the bag intended.
3.0,"Make sure that you read the product description carefully. The stone in this ring is very pretty!  The ring itself is rather big and heavy and not what I thought it would be, but that was my fault, not the company's. I misred the description of the ring."
3.0,"sleeves too long, weird collar."
3.0,Comfortable and great for yoga. Not good for dancing if you expect to be able to do turns and spins.
3.0,"just received this today, it is a bit grayer in color than I expected."
3.0,"A little long in the crouch, but not bad.  Material tends to pick easy though and accumulates fuzzies easily.  Probably will not buy again."
3.0,These socks fit as expected but unfortunately the colour was much more dark ( almost dark brown) than I was expecting.  Picture is misleading regarding the colour.
3.0,"I was a bit disappointed when I received it...definitely not a 2XL.  Very soft buttery feel to the fabric, glides over your skin.  But too small for what I needed it for - to wear with my scrubs at work - however I decided to keep it and use it as a back and shoulder warmer.  It doesn't meet across my bust."
3.0,Did not fit my frame as I believed that would.
3.0,The fit of this bathing suit is really flattering. The only reason a took off stars is because the strap for the top ripped on the seam the first time I wore it. I don't think the suit will last through the summer.
3.0,"I used this band for 3 months, but I changed to a Richard Tracy band last month and was shocked by the difference in quality.  The reason why I initially looked for a new band was because the inside of the band and the indents in the front kept getting dirty (white), with no obvious way of cleaning them out.  When I switched to the Richard Tracy, I found that the silicone was much more comfortable.  For this band, the silicone sometimes sticks to my wrist and seems to attract dust.  I wasn't aware of the shortcomings of this band until I changed to a different one.  However, if this is the only band you every try, it will probably meet your needs."
3.0,Got the wrong color not happy
3.0,No cap in this bottle. Otherwise item as described.
3.0,"Aright so, I'm kind of unsure how I feel about these. I got them as a replacement for my excursion tank top that I really like but its so old i cant find it anymore.. these are made of super cheap material its like one step away from bathing suit material- which i figure with yoga pants or leggings might not be noticeable with the black and grey but the blue one FOR SURE will only be used as an undershirt for me. The only other thing I have to say I dont like about the grey and black (the only wearable ones in my opinion) is that they arent long. Im 5'5 150-160 pounds and a medium fits me fine but it literally JUST reached past my hips whereas i prefer it to go a tad further?? It is stretchy but with this material i doubt with time itll stretch out.<br /><br />One upside is they pulled the stiching forward at the end to make u look skinny from the front so theres that. 100% recommend these for working out or for people who wear tops while swimming but for casual wear its a 3/10."
3.0,If you are plus sized and like your clothes tight and short and you are over 5'7 this for you sis!<br /><br />But if you are 5'7 and over and plus size this ain't for you sis....lol<br /><br />The dress does look exactly like the picture and the material is great but waaaaay to right for my mom.
3.0,Sending it back. It's too big in the chest area. Thinking of ordering it in a smaller size.
3.0,They’re beautiful but the clasp broke off the third time I wore them. I bought them for my anniversary dinner and now I’m going to have to buy a second pair with the knowledge that they too may brake if I ever wear them after that night. I love how they look but I’m disappointed in the quality.
3.0,"When it the purse arrived it had some scratches on the shell body and while the concept of this purse is cute, the straps are super cheap and flimsy and broke within hours of first use."
3.0,"The material is absolutely lovely! It's well made; it's just too small!<br />My waist is a 42/44, I ordered a 46 and its tight around my waist. The arms are also super wide and long. I'm keeping it because I'm on a diet. I'm sure it will look wonderful after I tailor the sleeves and get my waist down to a 38/40."
3.0,"Looked great while they lasted. One died within a week of going swimming, my fault for wearing leather in the pool. 2nd one just died tonight from normal use. Broke at the metal connection."
3.0,"Nice silk and nice design, a little small for the XL I ordered."
3.0,Zipper teeth will pull apart at time. I does hold quite a bit
3.0,Runs INCREDIBLY small compared to name brand . Quality is fine
3.0,"The size was good, but the material is a bit like canvas and not as comfortable as I had hoped. The style doesn't sit very well on a curvy figure either."
3.0,The color of this outfit is much more of a yellow gold than what is pictured. Not a fan.
3.0,Pretty much as described. Process was simple enough. Unfortunately the silicone gets everywhere if it gets too hot in the water. I ended up scraping a ton off of the grills. Only keep these in the water long enough to see it go semi-transparent. If you wait too long you'll have a gooey mess.
3.0,I wouldn't buy these again because of the size.
3.0,"I hardly wear them, because I do not like heavy earrings pulling down on my earlobes. They are pretty, don’t get me wrong, but i prefer comfort over beauty."
3.0,"I like the look but the material ruins it for me. It constantly catches all fur so if you have a pet, these will not work for you. Even at my gym, they pick up the fur and hairs left around.<br /><br />I would adore these if they were a more gym appropriate material."
3.0,I like that this product is available. I have been waiting for this product to return to amazon so as soon i saw it i bought it.  Its ok ..compared to my last watch with this print.<br /><br />The vendor doesn't provide a size option so if you have a 38/40 mm it wont fit accordingly it stick out on the sides. but it will fit.<br /><br />The print is very clean and not bad except they printed mines over a white band so the sides have a faded look because it layered over white. Overall its ok if they fix these things it be great 👍 hopefully this helps.. ive had it for a day so as far as lasting quality im not sure yet.
3.0,"I like the fabric weight and durability. I can wear these all day and not pull them up at all but I don't know if I got too big a size because there is a strange puffy crotch area, I'm 5ft10inches and weigh around 185 and so I got a large. It fits well everywhere else."
3.0,"I liked the ability to get so many different colors and styles for the price, however the quality is definitely lacking. I have already killed at least five of them by either over tightening and breaking it  or undertightening and loosing it. They also came with different length barbells which can either be good or frustrating depending on what you want out of them. Two of them, however, I have had in for a couple of weeks and they have worked really well for me. The trick is not gripping them too hard and breaking them. The metal is also very cheap, but I do not have sensitive skin so it works pretty well for me."
3.0,"I do like these pendants although the round owl was missing the latch to close it, and another one would not stay closed."
3.0,This is just a hoodie..its not at all like what is pictured you will need a heavier coat for winter this is a hoodie..very disappointing says winter outerwear but definitely is not..fir the money you can get a nice winter coat
3.0,The picture looks alittle better then the necklace  looks in person.  The flower is much darker and looks alittle less antique looking.  It was ok for the price.  I would not buy this again.
3.0,It would be a good gift for someone but didn’t like the chain it came with not thick enough...
3.0,"Super pretty,  chain sparkled. The clasp very very tiny. The loop at end of chain is microscopic. Tired for several minutes could not link them together. Bummer."
3.0,The heart broke off the post within the first week of wearing them
3.0,I am 5”7 and right around 185 pounds. I ordered this in a XL and it was too big. However that is not why I didn’t like it. The material is very clingy and would not look good on anyone trying to hide imperfections or that isn’t super thin. Not a fan.
3.0,ordered a extra large.. it fit pretty good in the waist and the length wa at my knees. But the chest area was made for someone bigger than a b cup in my opinion. The dress was somewhat stiff to the feel too.
3.0,Very cute but too big for my 5 yo daughter.
3.0,"It fits as expected... however, I find that it does not stay put and rides up in very uncomfortable areas. Being a mother of a toddler, this is not the ideal bathing suit for me, however cute it is."
3.0,Cinched at the waist. Clingy material. Really cute though. I would suggest ordering a size up.
3.0,not comfortable and looks cheap
3.0,Not really satisfied but it’s ok for casual date
3.0,The costume could have been a better quality for the cost and the face on the mask is cheaply glued on so it's not really easy to clean.
3.0,"Ordered 7-8 size for my son, but it was small. The measurements on the website run small. I would recommend ordering one size up."
3.0,"I purchased the purple and liked the color. The ruching also did a good job camoflaging my chubby belly. Unfortunately, the fit was great on my lower half but too big on my upper half. This left the top too loose and the silver snap was visible when I unsnapped the top for a deeper v-neck, no matter how many times I tried to tuck it away. So if you are bottom heavy, you may want to skip this one."
3.0,Actually a great little travel wallet..gave 3 stars cause it kept demagnatizing my hotel room key. If it wasnt for that would be 5 stars.
3.0,These sit cockeyed on the nose. At least 3 of the 5 pairs.
3.0,Dont fit like promo picture
3.0,"This dress is true to size IMO. I usually wear a size 4. Because the description says this is an Asian company, and because I wouldn't have time to exchange it if I got the wrong size, I got a size 6. It was a bit big though, I think a 4 would have fit better.<br /><br />I got this dress in white and it's totally see-through.I wore a nude camisole and a half slip under it and it was fine for a Halloween costume in a dark bar (which is what I wore it for). But if I actually bought this for an actual fancy event in the actual sunshine (or even normal inside lighting) - no way! You can see everything through it. If you hold the tag up under the fabric, you can read it through the fabric."
3.0,"I do like the watch. It looks pretty and very light. However, after some sweat, it left orange -yellow color my wrist that didn't come off for at least three days."
3.0,Was concerned about the shipping time. The seller got right back to me and assured me it would probably arrive sooner and it did. Good customer service. Good quality. For larger head sizes. Bit disappointed in the fit for me. Can’t really wear it but I’m glad it is offered. Probably would fit most guys. I’m a female veteran and I was stationed at Airstation Cape Cod. I was pleased to see this offered.
3.0,"This sweater runs narrow for a large, yet the  sleeves are too long.  The front of the sweater is much shorter than the back.  The front of the sweater does not cover the front part of my body like in the picture.  The back of the sweater makes up for it as it is too long.  Its just off in the sizing.  Fabric and color are good"
3.0,This fits somewhat small. Still a fun hat for the purpose it serves.
3.0,"I liked the fact it has no straps, but I dislike the adhesive material because It didn’t stay on when I decided to wear it. I had to keep adjusting it to fit. 😔"
3.0,The metal accessory on the side looks so flimsy and easily catches on the hair .
3.0,This is a really beautiful bead but NOT right for a Pandora bracelet. I'm disappointed that the hole size is huge. I won't be buying anymore beads that aren't Pandora just because they stay put on the bracelet.
3.0,"Weren’t all that, didn’t think they were worth almost 100 bucks."
3.0,"I didn't find these socks to be warm or cozy and didn't notice any wool.  They also were small on me which made them not cozy, although they were supposed to be my size.  At least they're low priced because they're just average socks."
3.0,"Good quality, but I wanted a longer cardigan"
3.0,The necklace is barely there.  I do like the pendant however.
3.0,"Guess I shouldn't have expected much, but this looks like a cheap ring, which is what it is.  NICE DESIGN though.  Love the style and have a much more expensive ring in this style that is stunning."
3.0,great stocking stuffers for the young girls in my family.
3.0,"Comfortable but run Way big. I'm a size 8.5 to 9, so I ordered the 8.5.  They honestly fit like a 9-9.5. The shoes are comfortable and I'm able to wear them....they just run way too large. I would recommend buying a full size down."
3.0,Like the looks. Couldn’t get it to go on. I tried for over an hour to put it on
3.0,This is your cute but very small. My daughter is 17 month and can wear 12 month clothes and the 1-2 year old size was too small.
3.0,The stole looks nice but is over priced. It's small in size and does not have a form fitted neck so it wrinkles when you wear it. It doesn't have the rich look or feel of most of the stoles I have purchased. I would recommend it at half the price.
3.0,Good fit and does not roll up you stomach but these are really thin
3.0,Too cheap and can really only handle shoes not boots. Does dry well and it came very fast.
3.0,"Like this shirt-dress, but it ran a little small in sizing. Great with tights and boots!"
3.0,Works as a great gift as the socks are very thin and light.
3.0,"Not able to use because it's to thick to bend. So I ruined the one,  trying to bed it. Therefore couldn't return them."
3.0,"I had to send it back because it didn't fit as described. All of my jackets are L size. I ordered the same here, but I actually needed a XL when I tried it on. The material is ok. Didn't wear in the actual winter season because I changed my mind"
3.0,"This little keychain was cute, but it’s quite<br />small and the light isn’t bright enough to be of any use."
3.0,"I love the product. They have a little give to them. I'm 5""1 140 lbs. A little snug but I can get away with it. I'll wear a tunic top lol"
3.0,I love the design colors and feel of the material but after washing as directed it came out fuzzy.
3.0,"I typically wear a medium to large in t-shirts, but I went a head and ordered a large. What I got was more along a medium petite. It is a bit snug and very short. I also noticed that the brand/sizing tag is cut off, so I don't know what size it really is. A lot of individuals said their shirt was true to size or large, this was not the case for me.<br /><br />The product itself seems well made and is somewhat soft. A lot of reviews said how soft it was. It was somewhat soft and probably will get softer when washed. It wasn't stiff, but I didn't think it was that soft compared to many other T's I have.<br /><br />I have requested a refund or exchange, I am waiting to hear back."
3.0,"Comfy, but a little small.  Still able to wear around the house, but not to sleep in."
3.0,The top doesn't offer much coverage. I'm a 38 D and just couldn't fit them in there
3.0,The dress was very thin and runs extremely small
3.0,Love them! Comfortable and trendy. I’ve gotten a lot of compliments.
3.0,"Too small at chest, back, and underarm area. Hard to move the arms well."
3.0,"difficult to put on by yourself needs 2 people with little fingers, lol!"
3.0,"It fits well, but it rides up. It goes from tea-length to mini-skirt in 5 steps.  I'm normally a size 2 and am 5' 8&#34;, I ordered a size small. If your just standing around, it's fine.  If you plan on walking, maybe get a size larger"
3.0,"It's cute but has no underwire and the white lining pops out at the top of the &#34;cup&#34; anyway. It's baggy for the size and I'm a big girl. I'm gonna try to tailor it but it's disappointing overall. Then again, nice low price so just set ur expectations at that price."
3.0,The only thing holding the dress up is this LONG tie that can only be tied at the shoulder. When they put this on the model they had to have pulled the tie to her back so it couldn’t be seen. Won’t work as designed.
3.0,"I wear a 9 so I ordered 10. Yet the 10 was like a small 8 and I could hardly get my feet in them, feeling like I would bust them out if I wore them. I returned them right away and ordered a different brand. However, these did seem to be well made. I would just suggest you order 2 sizes over what you wear."
3.0,They're gloves not too excited about them
3.0,Very small for a man
3.0,"Very little weight so it feels cheap, however you get what you pay for. It does the purpose of holding your tie to your shirt."
3.0,"It was perfect for the 1920’s party I went to, but it was a bit small."
3.0,If your looking for turquoise this was way too blue but pretty
3.0,"Buen material. Pero no es la medida, le pedí un talla más grande a mi bebé, y aún así le quedó muy pequeño"
3.0,"It fits, but tightly. Recommend one size up."
3.0,"Not really made for women with junk in the trunk. Too much material in the front, not quite enough in the back. I tried them on both ways and believe me they weren’t on backwards. The material is good quality but the cut is weird and a bit uncomfortable so I mostly just wear them to sleep in."
3.0,Fabric is super thin which isn’t the best when you wear a tucked in long sleeve.
3.0,"My item was eyewear, should have been more protected"
3.0,Don't believe it's real leather.  Handles broke within 2 months.
3.0,The dress was a good material and length was great. I returned it because the fit was too small.
3.0,the fabric was soft but fits too big  I usually wear a large but would get this in medium
3.0,It doesn't feel like cotton as I was specifically looking for cotton. Otherwise the size fit
3.0,"The company has a trustworthy customer service, that compensate a bit the product, However, every time my kid wears the dress it has a new torn, even though the dress fits loose on her. I'm not happy with the quality of the product, and I can't give a better review than this, since the dress was meant to be for her birthday and i will have to get her a new one because this one has stiches all over.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: It has defective seam and the fabric was thorned. It's s shame because it looks so cute. Also I think a little shorter that I would have like, but haven't check if the measures are accurate with the description"
3.0,see through and large but pretty flower print i ordered a small
3.0,The cut is a little strange. Doesn’t look great on.
3.0,Material is REALLY thin and much more clingy than the pic shows.  Returned.
3.0,"Good band, good fit but the pins keep popping loose from the Vivoactive 3 watch.  The smaller, button side seems to be the main one that does it.  Its not a constant problem but happens often enough to be a concern, especially when out paddle boarding.  Ended up switching over to the Kades brand.  They don't offer the band in small but my other Kades band had been rock solid and never had any issues."
3.0,It might be good for those people who need a blender to blend things like protein shakes.
3.0,Was excited about it but was not what i expected so i gave it away.
3.0,Really cute but couldn’t wear them because they hurt my ears.
3.0,It was way too big. I wear a medium and this is more like a large.<br />It’s good quality but Beware! It’s  not cotton. It’s a stretchy material and not flattering at all.
3.0,"I was looking for a lightweight sweatshirt for when I’m running outside in the evenings, and thought that this looked cool enough that I might also be able to wear this casually when I’m running errands during the weekend.<br /><br />The good part is the material, it’s light weight, breathable, and exactly the type of material I was looking for.<br /><br />The bad thing, I got a large and it’s fairly baggy looking on me, so I think it runs a little bit big and I’m about 5’8” and 165lbs. My other complaint is the workmanship on the clothing itself, when you flip it inside out, the stitching looks like it will unravel after a few washes, and you can see some errors in the stitching."
3.0,Gave it 3 stars cause it’s a nice shirt.  Gave it to a super tiny friend cause the xl fit like a medium. Bummed cause I really liked it!!
3.0,Definitely much smaller than I thought it would be if you are looking for a bold look this is not it. Small and simple
3.0,"A little too small for a size large. I am 5'5&#34; 146 and originally I purchased a Medium in a different color (pink, red) and they fit well. These colors have very little stretch (material flaw I suspect) and I needed to go up a size and they were still a little too small!"
3.0,"Kinda cute, just because I LOVE butterflies but it looks a bit like &#34;it was rose but got a little bit rusted&#34;...let's hope it doesn't get worse!<br />Took 3 weeks to arrive."
3.0,The clasp is too small for even my very thin chains . Shipping was quick though . It's just ok
3.0,"The color of the dress was lovely, and the cut was cute.  However, the solid part of this dress is far too short. I am 5'9&#34; and the laser cutting exposed my underwear while trying the dress on.  This might be a better choice for someone on the shorter side."
3.0,"Here's the thing the collar is nice and the ring is sturdy, the issue is it didn't come with the featured leash. I needed it for a costume and ended up using a different set because of this."
3.0,The sleeves on this are really long. I normally wear  an extra large in tops which is what I ordered but it seems that the sleeves are meant for someone 6 inches taller than I am. The rest of the shirt fit fine.
3.0,"Very cute top but runs very small. I am 5'8&#34;, 190 lbs and ordered a large, but could use an XXL. May return for larger size."
3.0,They are small like kids glasses. Nothing like what the model is wearing.
3.0,Robe fit the arms but not around the body. Was not able to close fully.
3.0,Good material and not see through (I got white) but the straps can’t be adjusted so it can’t be tightened at all for the top or back so it doesn’t fit great
3.0,"This makes life a bit better, these days 😊"
3.0,"Pretty, but small.  I never described my neck as large, but had to give to my 6 year old niece."
3.0,"Really disappointed, this dress is not made for tall women."
3.0,"It's fine, but a bit clunky all the way around the finger"
3.0,"Three stars for the design, material, and ""flowiness"". But sadly I have to return this because this is made for people with super short torsos and it rides up the crotch and poufs out in weird places. I didn't think I was that tall (5'3"") but apparently it's only my legs that are short?"
3.0,"It's okay, very soft and pliable."
3.0,I ordered a 3X & it was more like a large.
3.0,"This fits a little bit small. I wear a large in most regular t-shirts, so I got an XL so that it would flow away from my body... it doesn't. The graphics are nice and everyone got a laugh."
3.0,Didn’t love the fit - I must be taller than how it’s intended to fit because it was short and felt tight
3.0,"Low end on the quality scale. But for the price point of $5, I got what I expected. Nice looking shorts out of the bag, but probably won't hold up to a lot of laundering. To be determined."
3.0,"pretty and very light weight, maybe not worth the price."
3.0,Does not look Rose gold in person. Didn't realize the short screw on backs. You cannot tighten them up. Ill fitting unless you have a fatter earlobe. Won't buy ear plugs again.
3.0,"The chain is only 18&#34; and very flimsy, so beware. The diamond chip is the size of a mechanical pencil tip but surrounded by beveled metal to give the illusion of being bigger in the photo. I have to look pretty darn hard to see the diamond accent; enough to make the title &#34;diamond accent&#34; be disingenuous in spirit if not fact. Overall, I'm underwhelmed. There are a lot of snowflake pendants out there and I'd probably look at those unless the price point is under $25 for this."
3.0,"The chain is strong, but the clasp catches a little. I'm keeping it."
3.0,"The glasses were better than expected, with a sturdy frame... however, the wig was pretty shoddy.  There were too few fibers and poor quality material: you can easily see the mesh holding it together while it's on.  I purchased another manufacterer's wig for a child's costume, at about the same price, with much better quality."
3.0,It was a bit smaller than the usual small I always wear.
3.0,Sizing way off. Much larger than expected.
3.0,"The top was to small, the bottom fit good. I resell it"
3.0,Got these today I thought it was going to be bigger than the size I got. Can only fit my phone and small wallet nothing else.so if your  trying to put alot of things inside wouldnt recomend.
3.0,Small enough to wear daily
3.0,"See thru, it is okay but I think personally material looks cheap"
3.0,"Too sheer for me. The style would look better if the material was a linen as oppose to a chiffon kind of material. As it currently stands, it is hard to see the distinctive pattern because the sheerness mutes the colors making them look dull."
3.0,"This is exceptionally long for a belly button ring. If your piercing is really high or you have a long belly button OR you like having it dangle in your pants zipper, this might work for you!"
3.0,but its a little thin the won't protect you from white walkers. Hoder wouldn't Hold the door for you. and prince Joffree would think your cheap. and would not not stand up to Kalisi's dragon's flame. also you will faster than Kal Drago and Sean Bean. if You had to use these socks to protect you from the elements. but again they look nice
3.0,"I love the vibrant red color, but I mistakenly presumed this print would stand out more. There are see through sections I wasn’t expecting. I tied her in a bow for dramatic effect, to which you could not make out the print and it came untied and became extremely wrinkled after a few hours of wear. Not a sturdy scarf but still pretty with a fun concept. Also, I am new to scarves, scarf wearing. At the end of the day, Id say it’s a fashion miss, but I can find a way to make do or elevate it somehow."
3.0,"The charm is very pretty, however when I looked at the specifications, it stated 22 inches, so I thought it had a chain also. I do see now it says ""no chain"" underneath the 22 inches. A bit misleading."
3.0,pretty but color fades
3.0,It smelled when I opened up the package.
3.0,The male voice has a very definite accent and it is hard to understand.
3.0,I sent it back. It's longer than pictured and ran big. I ordered a small. The material is nice and it is certainly well made. It just didn't work of me.
3.0,"After reading reviews I thought it was a little bigger and was hoping to use it for teaching but it isn't quite big enough for a binder. Nice quality otherwise, just not what I was expecting by the reviews about its size. The insert is nice and big though which is what I wanted so it can be used as a purse when I'm just heading to dinner and such. Fits an umbrella, a small iPad, a mini first aid kit, a small pad of paper, a pencil box, and a few other random items along with the insert but add more and it won't zip up."
3.0,Smaller than expected and cheap looking.
3.0,Well made and great color but the straps keep slipping off my shoulders do not know why but would not buy again
3.0,Its a cute hat but my only complaint was that i thought I purchased one hat but I was charged and received two hats. Thank God my sister can use a hat for a vacation.
3.0,I love the colors and the material is soft but incredibly thin. I’m not mad cause $5.99 is almost free but I’ll never leave the house wearing these. Great for home gym use.
3.0,Nice but size was small.
3.0,We ended up having to cut the ear loops to make them smaller. The fit was huge.
3.0,These are okay earrings their main out of foam the day Ingles on the bottom our little overkill and make them very long the decorations self is also kind of big and bulky the only one out of the four that is actually some kind of metal is the skeleton so I guess is a good thing there only worn when time a year
3.0,"Very cute but runs small , size 6-8 is more like 4-6"
3.0,"I received a good item (no rends or stitching mishaps) and it is exactly as pictured. Be warned that it is a material that easily 'runs' or 'pulls' (think stocking) so cant wear with jewelry that has sharp edges! Overall good product, looks great with tights, and I love the way it falls on the body."
3.0,Bought from Sincererly Hers.<br />Its larger than I expected and the chain is bulkier than the picture shows.it's also shorter than said. But I like it.
3.0,"Don't get me wrong, these shorts are super comfortable and really stylish, but the only thing that annoyed me was the button closure. The top of the button isn't securely attached so it moves around and makes the shorts a little looser in the waist than they should be.  I thought it was just a defective button, but I bought a pair in two different colors and both of their buttons were like this. Again, stylish, comfortable and fit great, but the button is super annoying."
3.0,"One side of the bag is not standing straight,  because of the packaging quality .  There was nothing inside a bag itself to protect it from damaging."
3.0,"Love camo. The material is thin and runs small. I'm 5'7""- size 16 and ordered the appropriate size, I gave them to my friend who is 5'- size 4"
3.0,"Quality feels cheap, looks pretty nice though."
3.0,"quality seems okay, but I ordered a men's large. I wear a 10 to 12 in ladies.. The pants are tight.They fit like a boys large, not mens"
3.0,"Seller and shipment all good.  Wasn't especially pleased with this bag for a couple of reasons:  1) the color is just unattractive and doesn't really look like the image, 2) it does NOT stand alone.  In other words, the ribbing doesn't provide any kind of upright support at all so it pretty much collapses in on itself when you set it down.  I tried wearing it for about a month but just couldn't get into it, so I gave it to my sister.  On a positive note, she is pretty rough on handbags and it appears to be holding up reasonably well for the price."
3.0,Very sweet dress but was far too big. I'm a size 10/12 and the dress was very big in the bust and waist. Would have exchanged for medium but they were out!
3.0,It looks just the name brand but the fabric is not comfortable. It doesn't stretch.
3.0,"Well oK I liked these earrings, but they are much smaller than I would have thought.. I will wear them,  but they won't go with the outfit  I was going  to wear,so I will have to buy some larger ones"
3.0,"Works okay with TruVision Readers brand reading glasses, but it's too small for most other glasses. Not big enough to put the microfiber bag the glasses come with into the case as well. Interior material is cheap and pulls away from the case."
3.0,Feels too tight and long and I’m 5’7
3.0,"After reading all the reviews I made sure to buy a much bigger size, but they were still too tight for me in the waist.<br />Everything else about them was great, but be forwarded, if you don't get the right size or do not like them and need<br />to return them you will be charged to send them back. I was going to rebuy these and get a bigger size, but do to the recharging fee, I'm hoping to find them elsewhere."
3.0,"I wish jewelry sellers would show their products on an actual human. This is much more dainty than I thought it would be and when they say 14 inches, they mean barely--it's smaller than my other 14-inch chains. It's pretty but kind of barely-there and not what I was looking for."
3.0,I led them but they were to small.
3.0,did not fit as expected - otherwise nice dress
3.0,Don't work as well as desired and come off - sticky.
3.0,no sole for long wear
3.0,The product I like. Good sock. However I bought this item and I only received 6 pairs. I contacted amazon and they said send those back and they will send a replacement. Just received my replacement and again I was shorted 6 pairs.
3.0,Cheapest glasses ever. Dnt waste your money
3.0,bought these for my son.  He liked them very well.  Nice size. Comfortable.
3.0,Bows fell off inside of packaging but beautiful slip. Fits perfectly!
3.0,Charm was great and main reason I purchased. Chain broke after three days.
3.0,"Pink is not as vibrant as shown, still a beautiful shade of pink.i wear a 2x.ordered a 3x.bad mistake stick with your original size.very long. A really nice skirt worth the price."
3.0,"I removed from package, and opened the battery compartment to put some good batteries in, and the battery door clip broke off with next to no resistance applied... Now what? Hopefully the rest is built better and works...will update."
3.0,"Fabric is cheap, thin and can feel like a paper bag. It’s not flattering and looks cheap. Definitely overpriced and don’t recommend"
3.0,"I did not really want push up bra, it is VERY tight around the chest and the arms are quite snug too.  I can fit it in but pretty sure that I will be in pain after a few hours.  Since I am dieting maybe it will improve.  I also got the Sleevie Wonder and that is more like what I was wanting."
3.0,"I have small feet (4 in kids, 5-6 in womens) and so they fit okay. They do slide down a lot when walking, so I don't wear them very often."
3.0,"Wore one, a button came off.  I'm 5'3 209lbs and big chest. It stretches, but it was tight. Thankfully I had a robe to cover, since I wore for my postpartum."
3.0,"The dress is cute, but the top is a bit thin... doesn't look good quality. My teenage daughter said I looked like Minnie mouse... and it ran just a tad small. Just wasn't the quality I was looking for, I did return the item."
3.0,"Beautiful tie, one of the better quality ties I own. Marked down because the pocket square was not in the package."
3.0,"I bought this wig for an 80's Rock costume party. I wore this with a bandana around my head and it looked great!<br /><br />However I often found many strands of the hair were ripped out every time I adjusted the bandana. It was a little difficult to keep the wig in an orderly shape, but it served its purpose and looked awesome!"
3.0,Good material. Don't like the waist band that folds over with wearing . Ok. Not my first choice
3.0,The earring looks pretty from the front and is basically fine for the price but the back is poorly constructed.  They just plopped the metal into a lump on the back bottom part of the tear drop without making any effort to smooth-out/refine it.
3.0,It came really fast but I ordered a small because I'm usually a small but it doesn't fit. I'm 5&#34;1 110 pounds and the small didn't fit so I'm ordering another one side medium and hopefully that one fits. So if your interested you might want to order a size up. The bow just comes with a bobby pin to put it on yourself it doesn't come attached. And the clothes is a bit thin.
3.0,"They were larger then the actual size 5. The flower on the side was missing. But they still served the purpose, even though I am still disturbed with the fact that any company feels they have the right to violate their clients with false representation and take away the joy that comes with shopping, and losing a clients trust. How unethical!"
3.0,"I loved that they came in quick...plus they were adorable. They were all too long and had to have the chain hanging down....not comfortable. The bead one broke immediately as I took it out, arrow one broke soon after, and the dreamcatcher lost its bead. Not recommended."
3.0,As much as I wanted to keep them they were way too wide.
3.0,I love the oversize and that they look like a designerbrand The plastic feels cheap but they don’t look it unless you touch them. I’m general very happy!
3.0,"Ok, doesn't seem to help anything, and the way it's made, it catches on things."
3.0,fit ok. The seems were in the middle of the shirt though. Not very true to pic.
3.0,"This case is super cute, and I get lots of compliments. One problem is that it easily comes off, and can be hard to slide into pockets due to the rubber-like material."
3.0,"Great drape, but the fabric looks cheap up close, like you're wearing a parachute."
3.0,The band is small. The buckle  is on the side not centered on the wrist. I'll keep it but  would not purchase this brand again.
3.0,The lace was way to long and the straps are kinda saggy
3.0,"This shoe is very cute, great almost rose-gold color, and the ankle detail with the zip up heel is perfect for little girls. However, the show ran very wide on my daughter, especially from the heel to arch. My daughter could fit her entire LOL doll next to the heel area inside of the shoe with her heel in it. She is a size 4 big kid and the length was perfect, little extra room to grow but the width in the heel was ridiculous.  Also, the shoes came from amazon just in a bag, no box. The toe box area on one of the shoes was squashed because of this. Returning them!"
3.0,I like butterfly's hence why i ordered this. Found it rather small & seems more suitable for kids glasses. The handles are already unraveling. Seems kind of cheap.
3.0,I didn't realize it was polyester
3.0,The photo shows a long solid shoulder strap but it came with a chain strap instead. The phone case is too small for my Pixel 2. Other than that it's nice.
3.0,"Fits everywhere, but too small through the arms. Also, the material wasn’t the same as in the picture."
3.0,"Love the pants, but run small.  If in doubt, size up!  Loved otherwise so I ordered a size up!"
3.0,Don’t fit right too small
3.0,Not a very good fit.  The buttons seem to face down making it look cheep.
3.0,I really like the way it looks. It's more professional when I go to work than the purple silicone band. I got several complements on it. I waited to review because I wanted to see if I got the same &#34;green stain&#34; results. I don't wear it in the shower or exercising (which defeats the purpose of having a fitbit) and yet for the past three days now I get a green stain on my wrist. I read other reviews saying the same but I was hoping the issue had been fixed by now. I can't keep wearing this if I keep getting a green stain.
3.0,Wasn’t even the right package I picked but still got a lot of cute ones and it came with alot a few did break easily didn’t like that n of course it’s the cutest one 😒 overall 4 outta 10
3.0,"Cute but too big and bulky, I am 5&#34;3&#34; and weigh 102lbs  so it is not a good fit for me.  I did keep it and made some minor adjustments in the back.  Love the colors!"
3.0,"Love the style, reasonbly priced but size chart ran small."
3.0,The pants aren’t as trim fitting as the photo and are a bit more flowing. And they aren’t completely see-through but they are a bit.
3.0,The fabric and construction are cheap and flimsy (as many clothing items from this company). They run small so order at least one size up. They are more costume worthy than wardrobe worthy as far as quality goes.
3.0,"Will update once we get back from Wyoming<br />UPDATE: these glove are good for walking around in the cold and doing minor thing.<br />Wyoming temps were very cold, -6 to 23. Wind shield from -17 to - 28.<br />While walking around town they did great no issues but did have glove liners as well.<br />Used them during snowmobiling for 4 hours. Wife hands stayed cold and sometime to cold during the ride.<br />My hands were cold the whole time put not as bad since I had electrical warmers on the hand grips.<br /><br />Not bad glove just not good for cold weather under 20 degrees I would say."
3.0,I kept this because the color matched a pair of leggings I have perfectly but it isn't very flattering.  Looks a bit like a maternity dress.
3.0,The knit boxers were very soft to the touch but they move around a lot and are quite large
3.0,"These sunglasses have very nice packaging and include a sturdy, protective case with a cleaning cloth. The oversized, stylish sunglasses with a more feminine look than traditional aviators.<br /><br />The ears and nose pieces could be more comfortable, but it could just be the way they fit on me. The lenses are very light colored, so I would want darker glasses for a day out in the bright sun. I found myself still squinting from the glare of the sun when I wore them on a very sunny day.<br /><br />Overall, these glasses look good, but won’t do the job in the bright sun, which is why I wear sunglasses."
3.0,"Plastic lenses, but comfortable and so far scratch resistant. The frame is durable and the bridge support is comfortable.  I'm thinking this pair should be priced in the $12.00 to $18.00 range."
3.0,It didn't fit the way I hoped. Runs kind of small in size. Gave to my daughter.
3.0,"Very cute and nicely made,  but they don't squeak and we were so excited about that part! Very disappointed that they don't squeak as advertised"
3.0,Adorable outfit however the snaps on the bottom are not strong or sewn in well and two snaps ripped out when I tried to unsnap them in order to change my son's diaper.
3.0,This has a strange smell that I can't get rid of by washing it. I'm not sure if it's the material? The material is a spandexy type material. I'm a bit disappointed because I love the pattern and colors of this.(the blue)
3.0,Runs a little smsll
3.0,"The coat is not too bad, nothing special. The fabric in the inside is really cheap. Ok for the price."
3.0,kink Of big for my Tragus piecing but I’ll still use them elsewhere
3.0,"The strings detach from the mask easily other than that, mask is cool"
3.0,"Looks like the picture! Super cute, gets dirty very easily. Also one of the little pins to put it on broke after only one week. I can still wear it but once I take it off I won’t be able to put it back on :("
3.0,"Baggy pit to pit, long sleeves like a mens style fit closer to my elbows & the waist was longer but it was too much material to be able to tie it in a knot like the model has. I tried 10x and could not get it tied like I can with other shirts. The letters look cheap but the price was as well. Tee almost has a smooth active wear feel."
3.0,"The magnetic ones are honestly painful after a little while because the magnet is too big, the illusion type ones are unrealistic but the seamless style is comfortable, looks good and is easily adjusted"
3.0,Not as sturdy as I thought it would be.
3.0,"This bag is nice-looking but was obviously made in certain circumstances.... All the metal pieces had sticky newspaper bits stuck to it, it took me quite a while to clean everything.<br /><br />I haven't used it as often as i thought i would, though."
3.0,"The picture looked like a rich blue and a cute cut, but it's a weird shade of blue, and poorly made. I'll be returning. It looks like it's worth $10 or $15 max. Pockets were cool though."
3.0,Color is strange but it's very warm
3.0,"The dress is a nice style, but the fabric is rather thin. I will need to wear it over shorts."
3.0,So they are super cute but the zippers broke off after one use. The fabric is thin and cheap it fell apart on me.
3.0,Color is accurate but the neckline on this is not as wide as depicted. Closer to a crew neck rather than boat neck. Fabric is far more polyester than expected.
3.0,"Much bigger pair of earrings than I expected, though not bad for the price!"
3.0,Not what I expected so returned it!!
3.0,"The dress fit but it was not as long as pictured. Also the color was off. I rodered the blue one and in the picture it showed that it was a brighter blue. However, when it came it was a dark blue. Very disappointed because I loved the color that it showed. I know that there are discrepancies but it was not even close to the same color."
3.0,Mine had a spot on it. Made for hour glass body types with small breasts. Not for anyone over size US 12.  Not for women over 5’9”. Otherwise cute.
3.0,I love them they are very cute but…. They are too big for me personally I bet someone else can pull it off
3.0,If ur large get extra large too tight
3.0,"These r cheaply made. The ball xame off of the post on the first pair I wore on e first day I wore it. Not a huge deal because these r very inexpensive. They do provide a nice and subtle finish to an outfit which is the main point of jewelry. It’s also very nice that these earrings come with both silicone backs and metal. Overall, satisfied."
3.0,Not the best quality material but a cute shirt overall.  Fits just like the picture.
3.0,i love this necklace but it came broken in half and i fixed is but the chain links dont stay together. i ended up taking pliers and tightening every link
3.0,he said it was ok
3.0,Cute but size runs very small
3.0,Seems to run on the small side.
3.0,"The dress is cute but came without the sash, so I have to buy one, dissatisfied"
3.0,Was larger than expected and the lace trim looks completely different than the picture.
3.0,"It is billed as one-size-fits-all, but it doesn't.<br /><br />It is too large and lacks the elastic to fit snugly."
3.0,They are exactly what they say they are going to be.
3.0,It fits great but was late getting to me.
3.0,"I haven't worn this yet. I took it out of the box to do this review, it's all packed individually. But I was trying to hold the necklace for a better shot, the little stone just came out. Now I'm pretty sure I can put it back and kind squeeze it so it stays put but I kinda worry about when I actually wear it out. It's a shame because it's a sexy set."
3.0,I like the look of this but I have to adjust it several times a day when it loosens on its own. I would recommend something with a clasp instead of a magnet.
3.0,Material is kind of thin and the quality is ok.
3.0,"Very nice material. How ever I have returned due to super small size. I ordered a 40 I normally wear a 38.<br />I couldn’t button the breeks they ran soooo small.<br />I have reordered a 46 to be safe.<br />I have purchased a few other W&H items, all quite nice but had to return all and order several sizes larger than normal"
3.0,Bit more Star Trek looking in person still cute though. Very 80s vibe. Good for price but won’t be staples.
3.0,"nothing special, and overpriced."
3.0,A little weird fitting and too large in the bust area
3.0,I am larger busted. The fit was not great.
3.0,"It’s a beautiful band! Very easy to attach and resize. But the buckle is really uncomfortable. It has rough edges that scratch and dig into my wrist. Otherwise it would have been a 5*****. Now that I know the size is right, I’m going to try some polishing grit sandpaper and see if I can file down the rough edges."
3.0,"Cute concept for sure, chest part doesn't have much support and straps do NOT tighten enough to help with the lift. I'm a smaller girl 125lbs and don't have much of a belly so I bought a medium. Bottoms fit great. Top makes me look a bit puffier that I am but it has a tight base so it doesn't fly up like most tankinis do. So good for water parks and diving boards :)<br /><br />So only Real Negative is the Straps don't tighten enough and I feel and look puffier than I am. And I didn't get fancy bag like some people did."
3.0,Super cute but material was too thin.
3.0,Le falto el estuche
3.0,"I've learned to like this romper, but it does not fit as the photo shows. I'm 5', a 34D and wear a size 2 pants. A large is small on top and the bottom is short. I would've loved for the top to fold over nicely as the photo shows, but an ivory bralette underneath makes it not only wearable, but very attractive. If I had to order again, I would order an extra large (2 to 3 sizes up from what I normally wear). Not great for the ego, but worth it for such a pretty romper."
3.0,I usually get the hanes brand crewneck for work and decided to try the russel brand since it arrives faster through prime. Decent crewneck nothing special except i don’t know if it was just mine but the shoulder inseam sticks out a lot … I wonder if it will go down after some washes but if it doesn’t it will probably be used for the gym. I weight 200lb 6ft and got a size L
3.0,These definitely did not last the squat test...too thin...too sheer for me. I also thought they ran a bit small.
3.0,"Arrived on time, its beautiful.  The main zipper is inconsistently bad.  If I work with it for quite a while I can get it to close.  Then soon after<br />that it will not close.  All I have in the purse is a check book and keys.  I don't stuff it.  I am disabppointed, but not enough to send it back."
3.0,These shoes came in smashed.
3.0,"Adorable suit except for the fact that it runs very large.  My son wears a 2T normally, but this 2T suit was WAY too big.  I am in the process of trying to return it, I was so disappointed it didn't come in an 18 month.  Hopefully the return goes smoothly!!"
3.0,I got a medium because people said it ran small. I think over all it is just not made very well.
3.0,Jacket is smaller than a normal medium.
3.0,"Nice leather so far. Problem is that Apple Watch pulse and electro cardio readings are distorted if cuff remains attached to the band. Cuff is removable, but what is left is a watch very plain watch. Overall bands is not worth $90.  Should’ve cost $45-$50"
3.0,"I expected more length, but it fits and has a nice color."
3.0,"Sadly, this is meant for a much smaller neck. The layer chain is well over halfway up the chain, meaning it rolls constantly and tangles. It does fit my neck, the pendant is in the correct position, just the layer chain with the silver beads is so short and high up the chain that it doesn't lay right. The stone is also really really dark. You have to put a light behind it to see any blue at all. It looks black instead sadly.  I love the piece, I may move the pendant to another chain to be able to wear it, but as is, unless you have a really tiny neck, I mean teen sized or smaller, it's just not quite right."
3.0,I wish the zippers can be strong
3.0,"They kept extending the delivery date for quite a while, so that was frustrating.<br />The slippers are very cute but they run large and I have to share that they are horrible on hardwood floors as the rubber soles leave streaks wherever the kid moves!! It has been a nightmare as it looks like there's been a party every day at the end of the day.<br />I still can't tell if they will last or not, but I can say that the fluffy inside has receded noticeably, to the point the slippers don't longer ""hug"" my kids' feet, but look even larger than when we got them."
3.0,"This is a high-quality, lightweight shirt.<br />Size/Fit:  I'm 5'5&#34;, 150lbs, 36D, 30&#34; waist.  I ordered a Med (I wear my tops fairly fitted).  This shirt fits perfectly across my midriff, but doesn't even come close to closing across my chest.  I'd have to go up at least two sizes to be able to button the chest area, and then the midriff would be huge.<br />If you're not large-chested and/or like your shirts a bit loose, this is a terrific shirt.  If you're looking for a tailored shirt to fit a woman's curves, this isn't it."
3.0,"This is a nice robe, however I do not like the pilling it is beginning to do.  Fit is nice and it is very soft."
3.0,The upper arm of the sleeve is way to tight.
3.0,I ordered the 2 pack that specifically states a gray and a black shirt. Instead I got 2 black shirts.
3.0,"I really wanted to like this dress, and it fits everywhere but my chest and shoulders. If you're larger than a d cup you definitely want to order up a size or two. The waist is elastic and very stretchy."
3.0,I initially purchased the solid colors and like everything about it from material fit and price. Decided to try the printed one and after 3 washes this is how it looks.
3.0,Cute but sleeves are tight especially around lace
3.0,"It’s a cute bag, but evident that it’s not the best material. You get what you expect for the price. After a couple days, one of the zipper things fell off the second zipper hole. Cheap price so cheaply made."
3.0,Fits really well. Just all the right spots of you curvy like me. Only dislike its a little see through
3.0,Really small and not well made
3.0,"They were too slim for me.  I can do slim fit shirts all day long, but won't get slim undies again."
3.0,"They look good but the metal is weak. While pressing on the clip to open, the entire U-shape under the bar will collapse. After repositioning the clip to open again, the clip becomes useable. Main issue -weak metal."
3.0,"Not crazy about the material and the bottom does not fit loosely on me (i do have wider hips, but still)  to me it doesn't look very similar to the picture at all as that girl is probably like 80lbs... I'm 140-5'5 and it just ok... It is cute, but not like the picture and the fabric is softish just feels cheap and is super thin.  I got it in tan, which looks like isn't even an option anymore and it is on the border of a weird gold color not the tan pictured."
3.0,"It looks nice but i can't figure out if you wind it up or change a battery. If you change a battery, i can't figure out how to change it. so once it's dead, its dead. it looks nice on my suit but it has no functionality left."
3.0,"Pretty dress, has a cute, wholesome, flirty, girlie look. It really does look almost exactly like the advertised photo. I like the design, with ruffled bottom, longer in back, higher in front. Nice, and cool, with country floral summer print. I can see with a cute straw hat. However, it has some concerning quality control issues. The zipper is sewn in poorly, and incorrectly, looking pretty bad in back. I’d be embarrassed to wear that way. Luckily,  I sew, and can repair before wearing. It also calls for going over carefully, & cutting off misc, hanging strings. I am very glad I read reviews and ordered one size up! I am 5’8” 35.5-27.5-36.5, & normally wear a size Medium or 6. I ordered Large. I expected it would still be a bit big, but not at all. I am sure Medium would have been too small. I’m not sure why they call this a “Green” dress. It is “Black”, with small floral print, which has only small green flower stems.  Had quality been better, and sizing more accurate, I would have given 4-5 stars."
3.0,"Unless you have a skinny girl. My girl is very muscular & has a typical baby fat ‘pooch’ belly but she’s not what you’d call chubby. She’s just kinda big for her size I guess? So I buy her stuff a size larger, typically. This 12-14 fit more like a 10."
3.0,It's a very cute top but it did not fit as expected. I returned it and plan to order a larger size
3.0,"The product itself is effective, and overall it is ok.  The delivery however, that is another story altogether.<br /><br />Due to the order and delivery date occurring on a weekday I opted to have it delivered to my office, as I have with all of my online orders in the past.  However this time it was not as expected.  The delivery service that was chosen went to the correct floor in my office building, but they chose to just leave the package on the floor in front of one of our secured doors, one that was NOT the delivery entrance.  Instead of looking for the right doorway, which was the only other one available, they chose to leave it out in an unsecured location where it could have been picked-up by anybody, anyone but me since it wasn't on my actual floor.<br /><br />Hopefully this message will help the product provider(s) to ensure the delivery services they use actually do what they are paid for and do not risk losing a product."
3.0,"Pockets are tiny, will not hold a cell phone. Even to small for my hands,other than that it's fine .I am 6' and 175 lb., so I'm not really big."
3.0,My wife love that the pink is satin. All her thongs n boyshort r the same material. They look awsome on her. Only reason i am giving this 3 stars is cuz the lace sticks to itself like a dryer sheet kinda feels like 1 to. If i could order panties without the lace for my wife i would.
3.0,"I bought these shoes to replace my old UA basketball shoes.  My old shoes fit perfect so I ordered the same size.  These shoes are smaller and narrow.  I guess they vary from style to style.  It's hard to recommend anything since my last shoes fit fine, but this particular style runs small."
3.0,"Design is pretty, but it's heavy and can get uncomfortable. The chain that comes with it is too short for this type of pendant. The price can't be beat, and for the price paid, it's def worth it!"
3.0,The gloves were ok..some of them tore as we put them on..but overall ...ok for a one time use
3.0,The shorts were too big and the shirt ran small and was too tight. I’m top heavy so I ordered a 2x to accommodate that. I haven’t worn the shirt anywhere because it’s uncomfortably tight! The shorts I have to keep pulling up.
3.0,"My order was delayed, so I wasn’t able to wear it for the occasion I bought it for. The dress fit as expected.  It looks great on me but the fabric is flimsy."
3.0,Material is not stretchy. It is too small.
3.0,"I love how cute these booties are but they were too small. I wear an 8, ordered an 8-1/2 and they were still too snug. I sent them back and will keep shopping!"
3.0,Fits ok to big didnt care for the colors
3.0,An ok top.
3.0,"Looks great and definitely liked the smooth mobility. Durability on the other hand was not what I expected, the largest suitcase cracked during it's first usage."
3.0,"Fits small, but very cute."
3.0,"Too small for me. I believe I read the description afterwards and it does say somewhere max chest size 46.<br />I'm a 48 chest and I was able to squeeze into it but thought we were going to have to use tools to get out of the chain mail 😂 mail looks great on my fiancé who is only 5'3"" and barely 100lbs"
3.0,Really short and the wrap then tie doesn’t stay in place keeps rising up. I might try to sew it some way to stay but then once all said and done the cost of the top all together isn’t worth it
3.0,The shipping was fast and the top seems pretty high quality and it would last a while. The parts that cover breasts are VERY close together. I am a 32DD and it barley covered my nipples! Gave it to a C cup friend and she loves it
3.0,The slippers looked cheap. The material didn’t appear like the picture. We returned them. My husband wears size 14 and they were pretty true to size.
3.0,still fog up.
3.0,"The dress is very cute and made pretty well, however, it is much longer than advertised.  I pulled the straps as tight as they could go and will still have to hem it up.  The pockets are a great feature."
3.0,"didn't fit as expected, I ordered it a little bit too big"
3.0,"Love the look and feel of these earrings. However, the ball separated from the post within two months of receiving them. Disappointing."
3.0,Cute but breaks very easily!! One time costume piece.
3.0,"Cute dress, fits pretty good. Love the print but the fabric is a little weird,  feels like I'm wearing a dress made out of parachute material!"
3.0,They look good but the fabric is very thin. I’ll see how they do when I embroider them.
3.0,"The shoes are nice but they scratch up easily . Shy splash that hits it , it stains . It also came with a black spot in it smh . So I will just give them away to my niece"
3.0,Seems like when putting on the soft part they misaligned it and I don't want to try and it myself due to being afraid of messing it up. It came on the bag as shown in the pictures. The lady loki one came better than this one. They literally folded the sides just to make it fit for shipping. Kinda disappointed.
3.0,Cute dress but fades quite a bit in the wash
3.0,It looks like one of Coaches’ older product lines it’s not really the quality than I’m used to from them
3.0,"Let’s be real about this suit. For starters I was really excited to get it, based on reviews and photos of children. I’m giving3 stars due to the fact that the stitching is very poorly done. There are strings hanging everywhere on jacket shirt bow tie and pants. Yes, you can easily cut these off (which I did ) but that besides the point. Secondly, the material is very cheap. Feels lightweight which is kind of nice due to hot weather! The package came with all the pieces shown, exact colors except  pants are a little darker Olive than photos. The shirt is really cute, bright and makes the whole outfit.<br />Let’s talk sizing: the jacket length for arms great. The shirt same length, plenty of wiggle room for heavier toddler. My son is 24lbs 32 inches tall. The pants are weird they are tight on his belly, where the buckle is but super lose around the ankle. One my son these pants fit straight down and are not tighter around the ankle like other reviews. Maybe I was sent the wrong pants(not sure).<br />Is it worth the price? Well, I got it with 1 day shipping, yes it is worth it to me. If I had seen the outfit in person tho I would have not gotten it. All together my son does look cute in this outfit but it maybe a little over priced for low quality clothing."
3.0,Much smaller fit then my FotLs.
3.0,Fits baggy in front and back. Got a medium
3.0,It was lovely except for the fact that it completely smothered me. And I'm not what I would call thin.
3.0,Was so excited to get this! I thought I was ordering a medium and it was xxs. Went back and looked at it again online and it still did not say it was xxs. But it was a beautiful color and looked great when it arrived!
3.0,"Super cute socks, run on the small side.  My friend with a size 10 foot has to stretch them to make them fit and even then they are tight.  I wear a 6 ans they fit, however sad to say they shrank in the wash and now are crazy tight.  So sad because they are super cute."
3.0,I ordered the Red Rose but I got Magenta instead. The fabric is soft but I did not like the color. I ordered the large and it fit but wasn’t very flattering.
3.0,"I received this product a little before the shipment date, but thats not saying much because it still took like 3 weeks to get here.<br />The fit is interesting at best. I'm smaller chested (34 B) and while I didn't have a problem fitting into this top, there is some major side boob going on. This is a very cute halter top, and I wore it on the beach as a bathing suit and also with a few outfits. Versatile.<br />I would like one of better quality, but understandably for the cheap price I paid, I get why this one isn't perfect."
3.0,I bought this for my daughter who wears hats and caps all the time. I tried it on to see how it would fit her and found it was a bit small. That is saying a lot since I have a small head. The top doesn't sit with extra material like this type of cap should. It is cute though. maybe for a child?
3.0,You get what you pay for. These are cheap and clumsy. $1 store quality.
3.0,Nice looking shoe. Unfortunatey the sizing run large.  I had to return. Order a size smaller
3.0,"Heads up, ships from China, so don’t expect it too fast. Other than that, apply your own feeling about buying from China. The website wont/doesnt let us know where products come from, wish they would. I might pay a couple bucks more if I knew it was coming sooner and “local”.<br />Bracelet is OK, looks too small for an adult, but is on a stretchy band so my wife got it on OK. Just hope it doesn’t snap after a couple days."
3.0,"The necklace is very pretty, but the little chains broke a few times. I have had to put it back together within an hour of the first wear. There are multiple levels of chains, which I personally enjoy that look. The leaves are also very pretty. The metal is a bit thin, and you can easily bend those leaves in half. I would assume if they were thicker, the whole necklace would be heavier which would be painful. I still use the necklace. I think it is sturdier after i re-chained most of it."
3.0,"Adorable style, however, my 5-month-old​ granddaughter has yet to wear them due to being too large.  The shoes are wide was well."
3.0,"Appears to be well built, and the money clip is a nice addition.  But, does NOT completely block RFID.  On a good note, it does interfere some with the reading of RFID forcing several reads attempts before it successfully reads, and limits the distance in which RFID can be read."
3.0,These are cute scarves but WAY TOO SMALL to tie around your neck (unless you are really small).  I’m 5’7” and weigh 145 and they choked me.  Would fit a young child nicely.  I did tie one on my purse.
3.0,"Color and fabric is nice and I like the size and organization of the compartments. However, one of the front zippers is jammed and I have only used it once."
3.0,Ok for the price-
3.0,A lil on the small side. But its really cute. Suggestion order one size bigger.
3.0,The size that would generally be for a 5 year old was WAY too big for our 7 year old. Thought about trying it on myself for sh*ts & giggles. Great quality but ridiculously big.
3.0,The scorpion on my ring looked smudgy and hard to see. Otherwise a decent ring.
3.0,"This was a birthday gift for my son. When it arrived, it was huge. Then I realized you sent the wrong size. Will just have to return it. Bummer though because we took a group of kids to the movie for my son's birthday and it was too late to have the correct size to wear to the birthday event. We like the image."
3.0,The quality of the dress was excellent but it was way to long for a kid
3.0,"For the price - good buy; however, the stone was not secure within the setting."
3.0,Not a very great fit but it looks good. Kind of small
3.0,"I don't think they will last long, the bands crease after once use and remain creased/misformed."
3.0,These are pretty and cheap and perfectly cute. Only thing I didn't like is that they are a little long. I'm 5'5 and they go past my knees which is not the best look. you can't hem it because the pattern would be cut off.
3.0,"Not bad for the money, but a word of caution… the stitching on the hems isn’t very strong.<br />I bought 6 shirts (3-large, 3-xl) and 2 of the xl shirts had stitching come loose after the first wash (never worn)<br />The stitching on one shirt came undone so badly on the sleeve I had to return it. The other stitching issues are mild currently and I can probably re-enforce the hem before it gets worse.<br /><br />I’m sure it could be a case of something slipping through inspection, they were fine otherwise. But it’s still a let down when your kid hasn’t even worn their new shirt and it’s already coming undone."
3.0,Was nice quality but VERY short.  i got a large. I am 5'8'.  I can't imagine the golf courses i play at being okay with the length.
3.0,I like the shirt it was just a bit large
3.0,"Liked it but sizing way too small.  Ordered medium; I am a US size 10/12 and the measurements should have worked.  I'd say the size M is about a US size 6.  Description of &#34;jacket/coat&#34; is probably correct since it falls at thigh length (probably, since I couldn't even get it on!)  Fortunately,  I was able to return it without incident for a refund."
3.0,"If you normally wear an extra large glove, these won't fit comfortably. I can jam my hands inside, but I won't be using these gloves more than once. They are about what I expected for the price."
3.0,It's ok for the price. Not great just ok
3.0,It's cute but one of the stones fell off. Better to get one without a stone period.
3.0,"Love the size, great purse.  They only reason I gave it a 3 is that it is orange shiny sequined under the top layer and it shows through and sparkles.  Im not a fan."
3.0,This was a gift.  I was told they liked the chokers.
3.0,Not properly sized for kids (or non-adults) and smells very bad.
3.0,"This necklace is beautiful, but very loud. I mean, this thing CLANGS. I feel awkward wearing it because it sounds like I'm playing tiny gongs when I walk."
3.0,It was too small for any of my regular keys. The slit was too small. When I put it on my tiny mailbox key the cover was too thick and wouldnt fit through the keyring and is really bulgy and thick.
3.0,Returned this because it was too stretchy so it was too big for me.
3.0,They did the trick. I covered them in aluminum foil and added them to a fur hat. Perfect for keeping the Q’s away.
3.0,not gonna keep your noggin warm
3.0,"I think the dress has a potential but it runs bigger than expected. If you want it fit and to your body order smaller size. Also, the opening on the back is not as open as on the picture. I wish it was more open. I ordered M size."
3.0,"I love the style - the only problem is that every.single. piece of hair sticks to it, even right out of the wash. For that, 3 stars because it’s such a pain to wear and wash. Otherwise it’s a great!"
3.0,Does the job but nothing special about the material and it's a bit loose around the top
3.0,They look black. Supposed to be navy blue.
3.0,Top nice and snuggly warm. Pants at least 2 sizes too small.
3.0,"I like that its very large, it just seems that i have to put a lot of pressure behind the rub to actually get my silver shining."
3.0,It’s nice but the neck string is way short. I usually wear a small or medium and it did not fit.
3.0,too expensive. After I bought these I saw cheaper and better ones in burlington
3.0,"these were not true to size, I got a large which I wear a medium and these fit like a combo small/medium. The material was great quality, soft and held up in the wash with no fade or shrinking."
3.0,There is see-through mesh at the waist line.  I feel like this should be clear as I can't wear it to work as I expected.
3.0,"I really wanted to be thrilled with these sandals but instead found them just ok.  Right out of the box,  they have a slightly cheaper feel to them but when you put them on, they are actually quite comfortable for 22.00 shoe.  The colors are really cool and the materials used to make the shoe are soft and do not rub. The sole is not super supportive but it is soft and nice to walk on. I don’t have much arch support naturally but they still work for me. They definitely run large and are wide for a woman’s shoe but straps adjust and initially I got them to fit nicely.  I have wide feet so it made it easier.  Now, there were a few issues.  First issue - the shoe would fit better if it had an adjustable heel strap.  Not a biggie but would help with customizing size.  Second - they make a strange and very faint “whooshing” when you walk.  At first I thought it was my imagination but after walking around the house and later outside, I still heard it.  I can live with it - which is good because It did not go away as the day wore on. Third - I did get them wet.  I’m very outdoorsy and it was bound to happen.  I wore them in a canoe and the water caused the fabric to really stretch out.  I had to keep readjusting them to get them tighter.  So much so that at the end of the day, I had them about as tight as I could get without running out of velcro.  So to sum it up, if you have wide feet, are just looking for fashion not function, are willing to put up with a very faint “whooshing” while you walk and are willing to keep them dry these shoes might be perfect for you.  If your noise sensitive and or are looking for an outdoor sandal that stays on your feet in the elements this product might not fit your needs."
3.0,Cute shoe but runs small. I'm exchanging for one size up for<br />My daughter.
3.0,Sort of small and not comfortable
3.0,It’s so adorable and well made but being a size xsmall waist bottom wise and large/xlarge top it stinks cus the top only covers 40% of my breasts!
3.0,"The style and color are very nice, and the fit is what I'd expect from a medium. I sent it back because the fabric was very wrinkly and cheap-looking."
3.0,"The brooch itself is beautiful and looks just like the picture; however the reason I only gave it 3 stars is that the closure is on the bottom of the pin and when you think you have it closed, it opens again and again.  Very frustrating.  The clasp should have been done to close at the top."
3.0,Very good value for so many chains with clasps ($23).  All chains are in working condition except some of them are extremely oily. Machine oil I gather since they’re not handmade. Very messy involving a lot of cleaning. Cloth wiping is not enough. I’ll have to use quite a bit of jewelry cleaner. I’m hoping that will work. Debated about sending them back but it is a very good deal for thick chains with clasps.
3.0,"The torso was a lot shorter than I was hoping for.  Im 5'10, so that is a common challenge for me. I was buying it to wear to a wedding.  It is a casual but beautiful dress and would have been perfect except for the fit.  I bought the XXL and I am 190 lbs if that helps give an idea."
3.0,Was an awkward fit. Stitching took away from the appearance of the blouse.
3.0,I love everything about it except I can’t use the touch screen as you have to push really hard on it and sometimes it still doesn’t work
3.0,Slips out a lot when I’m sleeping
3.0,Looks good. Magnate not quite as strong as Apple's.
3.0,Fits very snug. Would’ve been easier if it had a zipper. But it is a nice dress for the cost.
3.0,The top broke day 2 of me trying it on. I still keep the pants they are pretty goo.
3.0,"They're pretty and they're soft.  All of the fingers are the same length, so some of them are empty at the ends making it difficult to do some things with them on."
3.0,Cute but the shoulder strap does not stay up andnis quite annoying. Wish there was a way to tighten
3.0,"Rather sheer, but cute graphics"
3.0,"Too small if you wears size 10 and up.  I can get my foot in it and looks cute, but not as comfortable as I'd like...Will continue to wear what I have because they don't hurt (if you don't have wide feet) but would not buy again."
3.0,Decent quality but sizing is off. I’m 6’3” and the length was decent. They came down about mid knee. I typically where a 34 but bought these in a 36 after reading reviews. I should have probably bought a 38.
3.0,Beautiful but too small for the size
3.0,This material is very unforgiving. It fits snug and if your a chubby girl like me it shows everything 😳😩
3.0,The earrings are very pretty  and I like wearing them.  They do seem cheaply made and I'm afraid they soon just fall apart.  I've only worn them twice. I'm giving them 3 because they are not very substantial.
3.0,My kid loves these shoes. They fit well and matched with all of his clothes. He fees like the cool kid in class now.
3.0,"Runs small from the shoulders to the pelvic area, but  my height is 5’8”."
3.0,"The pattern in the inside wasn't very vibrant and clear. But it has held up very well through several windy, rainy days!!!"
3.0,"Well, first I'll address the color.  I bought the Pink shirt and it is very peach/coral. The pics I posted show it pretty well. If I wanted to keep the shirt or trade it for another color I would size up from the Medium I bought to a Large. It's a very stretchy material and therefore very clingy. It isn't speckled, or whatever its called like in the picture, and there isn't a darker color around the seems like there is in the product listing pictures on my phone. The shoulder seems are also sewn weird to where it folds and bunches around the shoulders in a slightly strange way. It's barely noticeable but would bother me. The pros are that I believe it fits true to size and the color isn't bad, just not what I wanted or expected. I am 164 lbs @ 5'3"" measuring 36DD-34-43, and I normally wear a size 12 in jeans and Medium or Large in tops."
3.0,This idea of a bracelet was perfect for Father’s Day but it’s way too big. There are no instructions on how to adjust it which Is why I gave it 3 stars.
3.0,"There were mixed reviews on this about getting your normal size and sizing up, I should have sized up! Definitely go up at least one size if not 2, especially if you don’t like a skin tight fit. The material isn’t very soft and it is slightly sheer so you will need a cami underneath"
3.0,"I love this sweater EXCEPT for the sleeves being to short.  Too short to call it long sleeve, but too long to call it 3/4 sleeve.  I've washed it a few times already and it didn't fade, the fabric is very comfortable, but the length of the sleeves really bothers me so I won't be buying another one.  Oh well."
3.0,"The colors are definitely different than in the picture. I ordered a small and it's really big. Instead of the red-ish accents, it's bright pink. Not my favorite."
3.0,"The material stretched out very quickly, I would recommend ordering up a size. Also the band of the pants came up much higher than I prefer."
3.0,"Cheap, insubstantial, not like how they used to make pens like these..."
3.0,"The material of this is a thinner material which is nice, but the fit is much smaller then anticipated. I ordered an XL when I wear a M or L, as I wanted this to be a bit more slouchy and it came in and was pretty skin tight. I ended up returning the shirt, but that was an easy process to return and I got my money back quickly."
3.0,I see that whatever I have bought is smaller than expected from this seller
3.0,Quality of the fur isn't the best but it gets the job done.
3.0,Just costume shades. I really didn't expect 'Ray Ben's for the price. I bought them for costume purposes and they are perfect for the Walter White look.
3.0,The finishing was not as expected. The glue was all over the front pocket. Otherise roomy  wallet with soft leather.
3.0,Magnetic Clasp is on the small side.  Can pop off easily.
3.0,Compared to my doctor prescribed readers at +2  this safety readers +2 seem a lot stronger also because of the curb of the lens  there is bit of fish bowl distorted view.  ok  for occasional use  at work I guess
3.0,Pretty but I thiught they clipped on I no longer have pierced ears so these will be given away
3.0,Meh. Not bad for the price but definitely feels like a cheap product.
3.0,The necklace looks nice.  The clasp was completely stuck together when i received it in the mail.  Had to use plyers to separate the clasp but then the mechanism didn't work afterwards. Other than that it's fine.
3.0,Not crazy about the fabric
3.0,"I purchased the Fitbit Charger Cable by Geekius (2-Pack) - Replacement USB for Fitbit Charge, Charge Using Phones or Laptops, Wireless Wristband Accesory, No-Reset Compatible Spare for my Fitbit. I do not have the Charge HR, and it seems chargers for that are much easier to find than ones for the regular Fitbit Charge. These do work, but they do not seem to stay in very well if you move the fitbit around while charging. They come in a nice tin container that I will use to keep track of my chargers. They are also a little longer than the original cord. For me, that is neither a plus or minus. These are just spares, so I am okay that they are not perfect, but I do not think that I would purchase them again. I want my chargers to remain connected, even when I move the cord."
3.0,"Nice looking hat for the cost, but way too big."
3.0,"Fit is fine around the waist but the length is much too short for a medium.  If I were 5'9&#34; it would be okay but being 6'1&#34; means that wearing these boxers is very uncomfortable because everything is not contained, if you get my drift.  I have other pairs of Izod boxers that are perfect regarding length so maybe I got a bad batch."
3.0,This dress was cute but just a little too tight and too short for what I wanted it for. I have a 38 DDD chest and it was just too tight on my breasts.
3.0,Beautiful bag - just in time for Valentine's day BUT it has some great big nasty brown spot on the strap that's crunchy.
3.0,Thin. Not very stretchy. Just ok.
3.0,"There was a bubble in the glass by the star.  It's still very pretty, but disappointed in the quality.  Don't know if I'd buy another one of these.  The person who received it for Christmas said she liked it, and hope she really did.  For the price, the quality just wasn't there."
3.0,Runs very small.  Cannot wear it.
3.0,"I love the theory of the product but it has one small flaw that kept it from getting a 5 star rating. The loop that goes around the foot has a an adjustable keeper. The diameter of the keeper is too large which makes it fall off frequently. Every time you remove the straps, you must check to make sure the keepers have not fallen off because they do quite frequently. I would consider this product flawless if the keepers would stay on."
3.0,My first impression was it is heavier than I expected. I like the looks and feel of it but am a little apprehensive about the durability after using it for the first time on a trip. The bottom seam inside the left chest pocket opened up the first time I put my phone and a pen in it. Contents dropped down into the bottom of the vest and it was a bit of a hassle trying to figure out how to get them out. I will re-order another one and hope this was just a sewing fluke.
3.0,Too small in bust<br />Thin material<br />Buyer pays for returns
3.0,"It fits but it's a little too short to wear on it's own. I wear a size 13 pants in juniors, large tops in juniors, I'm 5'4&#34; 160 pounds and I ordered an XL. The fit in nice  and it's cute, but I'm definitely going to wait for leggings season to wear it."
3.0,"Bought one for my 9 year old nephew and it fits perfectly, but the writing is almost completely off after a few weeks."
3.0,"Very cute, bought it here because I’ve seen lots of scams on social media apps claiming the exact same ring is specially designed for their company that “donates” proceeds to the ASPCA. It’s really cute but literally the second day I wore it one of the little stones popped clean off. Since there’s only four it’s really noticeable. Really cute but not worth the money."
3.0,My daughter loves it but the sharp edges catch on her hair and clothes.
3.0,ToO small
3.0,It is a pretty bracelet but it's too small for me.
3.0,Fit nicely everywhere except for upper arms. Totally bummed. Had to return.
3.0,"This is a cute top, definitely super cropped, but what made me return it was the fabric. It just felt like thin cotton and I wasnt a fan."
3.0,"It's gigantic everywhere except the arms which are supposedly batwing but are sized for someone with toothpick arms. The fabric is a lovely soft and comforting hybrid between cotton thermal underwear and a light waffle weave chamois and very relaxing, not too hot or too cool. The yellow color is lovely. It is a real shame that the fit was so off. If I dry it in the dryer to shrink it, I won't be able to get my arms into it. Not enough extra fabric to let out seams in arms. A true disappointment. Please Asian designers, standardize your sizing and measurement. This garment has to be sent back and unfortunately it's not the first one. There is a body this will fit out there somewhere but unfortunately it's not mine."
3.0,"Very cute, luckily for a very petite little girl"
3.0,"Fit great , weird coloration when looking to the sides in them"
3.0,"Like it on the whole but, the sleeves are tight."
3.0,I would've given 5 stars if my pocket didn't come with a hole. Buy I like the material
3.0,Too much stretch. When first put on fit is okay but a little big.  After wearing them  for a short time I find myself having to haul them up because the waist has stretched so much.
3.0,"I was disappointed with this item, I don’ t know how fast they are produced but my ring fell of and the lobster clasp broke after the 4th time i wore it."
3.0,Not touchscreen compatible
3.0,"It isnt what you think it is, it isnt made of glass and silver as it looks. Its a simple endant you could make yourself. You are getting what you pay for. Its good for its price."
3.0,"This shirt is a nice olive color, it is roomy and flows nicely, very comfortable and light weight for hot weather. The material is actually shinier than expected from the photo, but this is not a big deal. It looks good. It actually looks good enough to wear to work with a nice cardigan or even on its own. I ordered the XXL and for reference I am a typical size 18 on the top and 20 on the bottom, so between XXL and XXXL. I am happy with the fit, style, and fabric.<br /><br />However....they sent me a used shirt. It came with no manufacturing tags, and it smelled strongly of colon or some kind of perfume. I never wear perfume/colon, but I know that new clothes do not smell like this. Clearly, someone else had worn this shirt for an extensive period of time and then returned it. I am disappointed that this would be resold. I immediately threw it in the washing machine and hung it to dry before trying it on. I have purchased used clothing before, so okay, whatever...you wash them first and they are fine. BUT if customers are going to pay retail prices ($24+ for this one) they better get new clothes. 4 stars for the shirt, 3 stars (maybe should have given 2) for shipping out a clearly used item."
3.0,Wasn't that great
3.0,"Its too small to be an anklet, i'll just have to wear it as a bracelet..."
3.0,"I have the white pair of gloves with the light green stripes.  They are comfortable and fit well.  I can move around with them on, including quick texts and other typing on my phone.  They can't replace the fingerless gloves for texting though.  Still there isn't anything that really stands out about them.  They look nice but they aren't better quality than other comparable gloves.  The price point it probably fair for these but you can find comparable gloves at any retailer."
3.0,"I have the same item, same size in a different color and it fits completely different! I was a little disappointed at that. I like the quality of the shorts though."
3.0,Definitely runs large
3.0,"This one is one its way back. It is a great looking pair of lounge pants, marked as XL but way too small for an American. It is made in China, and maybe an XL is big enough for them. I am not a large person ... 6&#34;1'  and 193lbs. Size L should fit me ok but I wanted something larger. This one did not quite do it."
3.0,I was so excited to get these since they had such good reviews and are really cute. They are very light weight. Also they run small not true to size like stated. I ended up returning them. I was going to reorder but honestly not worth the hassle since I'm not sure if the next size up would even fit. I highly recommend sizing up if you do purchase these. I wish I had read through more reviews before purchasing.
3.0,"Very cute, but broke immediately."
3.0,Wasn't the material i expected
3.0,"The colors/patterns are nice, but these bandanas are larger than expected."
3.0,Way too long for me--gave it to my daughter-in-law.
3.0,I really thought this jacket was great at first. I purchased in January and barely a few months later the main zipper fell off my coat. I was just on a walk with friends and I heard something hit the ground and it was my zipper. Very disappointing as now the jacket is a little useless but would have loved it if this didn't happen.
3.0,"I really wanted to love these earrings and even bought an extra pair to give as a gift. Unfortunately, whatever the metal is, I'm very allergic to. My ears ache whenever I wear them.  I never had that problem before. Chinese made. Beware."
3.0,BETTER FOR MY DAUGHTER. IT WAS TOO SHORT FOR ME
3.0,"I like the construction of this towel wrap. It’s very well sewn with snaps down the front. Usually the wrap towels just have Velcro or one button at the top, but this one has snaps all the way down with nice soft lace edging on the top and sides. The color is a very pretty apricot/peach and the material an absorbent microfiber. The problem is it is cut small and I mean very small. It is suppose to be a one size fits all and I got this for my disabled mom for after her bath. She usually wears a large and this just is too tight. The elastic around the top is very substantial but it can’t accommodate more than a small/medium person if that. Since she couldn't wear it, I adopted it and I’m med/large and it is really tight on me. The double snaps that are very sturdy hold when I’m standing but if I bend or reach, POP! I’m bustin’ loose. And the elastic pulls so tight it leaves, marks. It’s a shame because this is one of the best sewn towel wraps I’ve ever seen. But unless you are petite to a small medium it is not going to fit comfortably or stay snapped. I wish it came in Med/Large cut as like I said it is very well sewn. But alas the one size fit is not true. I use it as a hair wrap so at least it didn’t go to waste.<br />I’m giving it three stars because it is so well made. I want to give it more but since it isn’t a one size fits all and is cut so small I have to go with three. I mean it’s not a bad wrap just not represented correctly with the sizing. I like the construction but it’s not one size fits all. I'd give it two stars because it's veeery small cut but it is well made as I've said with the snaps all the way down so I'm giving it three stars for that."
3.0,There not best but its aight
3.0,Very different. After reading reviews I really hope that it would fit me but the extra large was too small all over. I am a 12/14. Disappointed and returned.
3.0,Ordered a small and it fits like a large. It runs big.
3.0,"Nice, lightweight sweater to wear with a longer tunic top or dress.  But the large was really more of an extra large, sleeves were very long as was the back length.  Definitely order a size down."
3.0,The gold came out super quick. Its a shame because it is high quality the stones are fixed in a very dainty way but if the color comes out it looks weird
3.0,One pair of the earrings were broken.  The other 3 were fine.  Light weight.  Cute.
3.0,This is actually a long sleeve shirt not a sweat shirt
3.0,A actual t shirt a little small and the neck is really wide
3.0,"Really like my hoodie but wish the decal was on back not front.  Keeps me warm, great quality."
3.0,"I got this today an its very pretty, but ford logo is very faint.  Is it old? Lol."
3.0,Works well. But it usually falls 2 minutes behind every day.
3.0,I purchased the blue Christmas tree leggings. The fit is okay but the material is thin and does become kind of see through when you wear them.
3.0,I bought this as a gift and I should have gotten it one size larger
3.0,I haven't had a chance to use it because my lock hasn't frozen since ordering but the light has already stopped working which was a little disappointing.
3.0,A bit tight in the straps but I think my foot is wide with a high arch. Overall they are OK.
3.0,"It looks more &#34;feminine&#34; than pictured, just not for me.  I wen with the Ruggan Business Backpack for my surface pro 4 and ipad.  Seems to be well built, but also didn't have a lot of pockets for those loose items."
3.0,Thin and short-waisted. Will have to tuck in which I'm not too happy about :-\
3.0,Much bigger than anticipated. Sent back
3.0,"I loved this suit but the sizing is not good.  Bikini is too big, top is to small in the bust for a plus size"
3.0,Run large fell off nose
3.0,La tela no es de buena calidad.
3.0,Did think that the bow and the roses are pined on plus one of the roses was unglued when I opened the package. I likes how the dress came inside out. I love the shade of purple. My daughter loves it. I gout don't like that the bow and roses are have to be safety pined to the dress and that one of the roses came unglued before we got it.
3.0,Like it but after awhile the white lines start to fall apart but I love the concept of it. It just needs to be better made. Would buy if made in different material.
3.0,The fit is nice and comfortable. It looks good from the front but on me for some reason the back looks funny and puffs out. It doesn't lay flat  like the photo. I am petite so it's not because of big hips or waist. Don't love it.
3.0,"Fit is good, but the cage detail on the arms is a little sloppy looking, and the ruby color is NOT as shown, it's bright primary red rather than a wine color."
3.0,Everything fit great except for the sleeves. The material is really thick and doesn't lay or curve to the shoulder area so it gave my shoulders a broad look. I wouldn't have minded for a more professional setting but I was look I g do something to wear to a wedding.
3.0,"Thought if I bought the xl it would be slouchy, but it fits more like a large.  The fabric is soft, but thin for a sweatshirt."
3.0,The arm holes a too big so I have to wear a certain kind of bra. It's still super cute though!
3.0,"These are pretty nice pants, but they fit very small on me.  I'm 5'9&#34;, 155 lbs, and usually am a medium when buying sweatpants from any of the usual brands you would find at target for example.  These pants are really run very small.  If you're my size I would recommend a large at least."
3.0,Was was too short in torso
3.0,"I like the fabric and the feel, but the fit is a little big and makes me look larger than I actually am.  But a comfy dress for running errands or for a casual day."
3.0,"Purchased this shirt for a wedding when we needed 2 of the guys to match. One being Medium other being 5XL. Was able to purchase both.<br /><br />If you are a heavy sweater, would recommend a shirt underneath as it is a thin material and shows that heavily.<br /><br />Medium and 5XL came from 2 different locations and one shirt was late arriving. Recommend ordering this well in advance."
3.0,This is so cute on my daughter but what a pain in the butt!!! No snaps so changing diapers is literally removing the outfit and putting it back on
3.0,"I liked it. BUT, it was just too large<br />.."
3.0,Cute but seam ripped right away where sewn
3.0,I like the gloves. I like the price and quick shipping. The reason for a lower rating is due to the fact that the fabric pills and is slippery on the steering wheel when driving.
3.0,"I wear a 34DD and the size fits but it doesn't hold up properly, if it came with halter straps it would look a lot better."
3.0,I ordered a size 10 years. Fit like 8 years. If I want to go to a larger size I have to pay for shipping. It’s just a kids t shirt and not worth it. Not happy.
3.0,Great show but the Ivory is more of a gold color.
3.0,LOVE the print. This is a true spandex. It does run small. if you are heavy chested it is revealing. Also very short. Great for parties though. I am 5'8&#34; and it comes to my finger tips when I put my hands on my sides.
3.0,"Excellent shirt, very well made. Logo of company on pocket was installed upside down on my unit. Very poor quality control."
3.0,These are cute shoes but they run too small. I ordered a 9 1/2 which is always adequate for my feet. Very cute though. Shoe laces are odd with the black stripe. They should be solid white.
3.0,"Reasonable price and okay product. as information shows , I thought this is a large cloth. However, doesn't look large."
3.0,"Tight around the head area when trying it on , and little tight but its comfy n cozy if it was a lil bigger"
3.0,Super cute dress! If you have a smaller chest this dress would look amazing. With larger boobs every time I moved my boobs would slip a little bit. It was a nip show just waiting to happen. Although it was super cute I did send it back based purely on the chest area
3.0,"Much larger waist than you would think.  Buy a size smaller.  Even though they ran large, the inseam could be a bit longer.  Fabric was very comfortable however."
3.0,"I’m an 8.5 and these size 8 fit me just fine. The backs don’t rub up against my heels and they are wide enough that they are not squeezing my feet. I like the knot design and the material seems durable. Unfortunately, these shoes are not comfortable to walk in and they smell atrocious. The cushion at the pads of your feet is very slight. I can see the cushion in the heel, but when you’re standing on it, the heels just feel super hard, like you aren’t even wearing shoes at all."
3.0,"Could be a little wider, then it would be be 5 stars."
3.0,"One time use for a costume, they were great!"
3.0,It was okay the pockets are weird kinda ruined the dress.
3.0,"I'm going to keep this and hope that I lose 10 lbs. I normally wear a 10 or sometimes a 12 so I ordered a large..That was a mistake. Need XLG.  It feels tight and shows EVERY bulge. This type of fabric requires a spanx type undergarment which would be way to warm in the south. The print/color is gorgeous. The dress is a great value for the money. Some women look better than others in tight clothes. If you are OK with very tight dresses and or you have a great figure, then buy this dress!"
3.0,"I was looking for a pair that I could wear inside ankle boots and not have show. They do poke out a bit, but they're close enough to my skin color that they're not too noticeable."
3.0,"I thought they would be smaller, I am petite so too big an earring for me"
3.0,I really liked the look and the style. It was a bit too small in the front for my body. Good quality material!
3.0,"Beautiful,  was shorter than I thought though I am 5'5 and only fell to my waist,  but overall nice for the price"
3.0,This product was a little on the small size. Dissappointed in that. Other than that its a good belt buckle
3.0,"I really love the pockets and the fit and it's super comfy, but after having it for barely over a month the zipper broke-and I didn't even use the zipper, I used to slip it right on"
3.0,Way too thick and bulky. The leather felt like plastic.
3.0,I like that they’re wide but not that the wedge is that narrow.
3.0,Good grip
3.0,Ordered a size too large
3.0,The color and texture
3.0,"I love the style and the flow of this dress, however it does run a little small. I normally wear a medium but since this was made in another country I ordered a large and actually I could very well fit into an extra large at that. I'm not going to return it but it will be great to just wear around for quick shopping excursions."
3.0,"I love the top, I ordered the large, and it fits perfect, I am a B/C cup size small top or 4-6 weight 120 height 5 foot 6 inches. Size 2 pants. The bottoms are too small if you are looking for coverage, there is very little. The front of the bottoms are fine. But I can't wear the bottoms in public, or in front of family, I paired the top with purple sting bikini bottoms which looks great.kept it for the price looks great with cut off denim shorts as well."
3.0,The frames are wide but the arms of the glasses are not long enough.  The glasses do not sit well on my face.
3.0,This band is very comfortable but it stretches out very easily and doesn't go back. If you have small wrists it will likely be too big to start.
3.0,cute but the &#34;silver&#34; color rubs off very quickly. You get what you pay for.
3.0,This purse is very nice and like all the sak brand poses very well made. Be careful when you order the peacock because in the pictures online it looks very blue/green and in person it is very definitely black.
3.0,"Pants not flared; wearing boot from broken ankle surgery, makes it challenging to put on. I purchased three different colors. Great set, quality material, I now have to wait 2 months to wear them."
3.0,"The material's thin (though for the price, you sort of expect that), and it's slightly too small for me (XLs fit at most other places). I wouldn't recommend this in general unless you're on the smaller side."
3.0,It arrived quicker than expected but was too big. Had to pay a tailor $70 to make it fit.
3.0,"Bad quality hat. The seam looks horrible and is very uneven and sewn badly. If I didn't need the yellow honors stuff I would return. Skip this and try another brand. Very cheap and will not be using the hat, Got it to take photos with but wont be using. An item can be made with cheaper quality fabric and still be sewn properly."
3.0,The bracelet  looks cheap when it stretches out on your wrist.  I like the stones and the ease it goes on
3.0,Is water resistant but water will get in and cause to get trapped and make the lense cloudy so don’t get wet
3.0,Hangs low enough so it doesn't choke you
3.0,"Bought this because the listing clearly advertised it was genuine leather.  The bag is pvc leather, slick and shiny.  Aside from that, it is a cute that would hold a normal wallet, keys and small cosmetic bag.  It has great deep side pockets.  Will keep just to avoid the return process and it was reasonable price."
3.0,Had these for 3 months and the soles are already falling off. I only walk around in the house with them. And I don't even wear them very much since southern California doesn't even get to cold. Otherwise they are really nice... Oh well.
3.0,Nothing wrong except too big for my glasses. The color was great. j
3.0,"The watch looks great. It has a clear and nice looking dial. Sadly the construction is sketchy. After walking to my car in the rain it was cloudy on the inside, it went away after an hour or so but it still fogged up meaning its not sealed. The band feels cheap like its going to break apart. It also loses time pretty consistently even with constant winding. I have to set it at least once a day. Its a shame because it looks amazing."
3.0,The quality was ok...😏
3.0,Three layers of fabric...not very breatheable.
3.0,"Not a particularly large man, and these were very tight on my wrist. The furthest hole to use was way too tight and I ordered the largest size."
3.0,"It fit really well - better than most, since my size is hard to find. But after a while, the fabric became more and more uncomfortable. I’m having to return it because I just couldn’t stand it."
3.0,"Bag is good, its just too darn BIG. I am going to alter it myself."
3.0,Very cute as expected but the sparkles rubbed off of one shoe pretty quickly so shoes started looking mix matched after only wearing a few times. I suggest not to send your child to school in them.
3.0,"Cute dress, nice design, but material wasn’t great. The dress is already “shedding” and fading after the first wash. Still comfortable to wear but probably won’t last that long."
3.0,In the pictures the dress seems to be more of a cotton material yet it is actually more of a polyester. I ordered the blue color and it came in as more of a darker teal color than the picture. There is also some sort of petty coat under the dress which makes it quite puffy. Other than that the dress looked like the picture and fit true to size but because of the underskirt it was unflattering so I will be returning.
3.0,"The purple ones are much darker in person than they appear in the picture. And I agree with other review, the clip feels cheap, so we'll see how they do."
3.0,"Ladies, am 5 5 and weight 184 lbs, small waist high thighs, the zipper is on the left and unless you have a super tiny waist then this is not for you. It's very nice and gives you the shape only on your waist. But my zipper didnt go all the way and they dont offer XL which would've been too big for me but probably would've closed.....so unless tiny waist dont buy, as my zipper didnt go all the way up, not even laying down."
3.0,"Super thin, and the Texans logo is cut in half :(  I'd thought it was just the posting photo and that it'd be a full logo, but nope. It's alright, could have used a file folder for less money and still have more support."
3.0,5'2 - 160 - a large fit perfectly. Ended up with the wrong style though.
3.0,Definitely order two sizes bigger the your original size to get the right fit
3.0,These glasses are beautiful but the lens is very flimsy and the glasses were missing a screw.<br /><br />I wish they were better made. I had to return them.
3.0,The design has started to crack and peel off.. expected better that this..
3.0,It doesn't seal around the face. I use it with essential oils for purification of the air.
3.0,"Nice gloves, but too tightly fitted for rheumatoid arthritis in my hands. Might be ok if you have really small hands."
3.0,Like them very well but size runs very small as not advertised
3.0,[[VIDEOID:a974906fbe45dc43a5861d8a0a4ab5d3]] The material is itchy and the fabric is cheap and see through you need seamless underwear and over a size smaller if you got small boobs over it looks pretty but the material is uncomfortable
3.0,Fair with the price
3.0,"When you sweat, they start to slip."
3.0,It's a little snug.  I'm 5'6 150lbs and it was a bit tight around my mid section.
3.0,I liked it but must have ordered the wrong size because it is to small for me.  I will have to get a larger one.
3.0,"Ordered a size small, it was extremely too big. I am a size 0/2 and the small was more like a 5/6"
3.0,I loved this dress in the picture by it is very small and difficult to zip.
3.0,I love this skirt. Ordered my usual size medium. It was way tight in the waist<br />So disappointing. Had to return
3.0,"I'm right in the middle of the sizing chart for a medium, but they're a bit small on me. The material is fluffier and warmer than I expected from pictures. No pockets.<br /><br />Otherwise, comfy feeling. Great pattern reminiscent of Batman: Year One graphic novel cover."
3.0,Beautiful but runs real small in bust
3.0,The socks are too tight on my legs
3.0,The accessories are cute but the shirt even stretched out is so small even my husband laughed and asked which kid did I buy that for. I bought a woman’s xxl.
3.0,It’s great but too big of a size . Do you have a smaller size ??
3.0,Didn’t like the fact that can’t put in the dryer
3.0,"If you buy it try to choose a size up. Runs small, tight, I just broke up my nail trying to put on the pants.. I couldn't put it on, I'm medium, 5.4f 140 pounts, just for have an idea. But good quality."
3.0,Not as long as in the picture otherwise it does run large. I usually wear size large and ordered in small/medium and it was still loose and comfy.  I ended up returning because I wanted this to be long enough to cover my entire behind and it did not. I also did not like that it sheds.
3.0,Not exactly what I thought. Used a pair and  ended up with a small hole in 1 of the gloves. And they were a little bigger than a medium
3.0,"Colors were nice, it's a little bit lighter than in the image, but that was perfect for me.  Arm seam tore open the first time I used it, but I was able to sew it back and haven't had a problem since."
3.0,"I really loved this dress BUT the one I got is sewed in the front so it looks really weird, this is not as it is pictured on other customer reviews so I guess I just had bad luck... I will not return as I noticed this after washing it and I have found returns to be complicated but I am really disappointed :("
3.0,Sub standard quality.
3.0,I loved this adorable belt however it fit me but not like I would have preferred wasnt quite stretchy enough. I am a size 10
3.0,I bought an XL size and it fits like a large
3.0,I bought this dress because it was so cute! I love the adjustable one shoulder however it does not fit my body type. I got a Medium which usually fits me (the large dimensions were too big). I am a 32DDD and waist size 4-6. Everything fit except the top part. The side that was not tied kept falling down :(
3.0,Very form fitting.  From the picture looked like it was a loose fit.
3.0,The material is not what I thought it would be but it's a nice shirt
3.0,Fabric was not of great quality. Not African fabric just satin coarse fabric.
3.0,"These are the only ones that I've really wore cause I thought they were the cutest, the silver is turning brown and the back is turning green and it's started it irritate my ears. Kinda scared of wearing the kittens now."
3.0,I was a bit disappointed; was wearing around house first time  and realized there was a 1 1/2 inch hole in the wrist seam. Since I had already removed all labels I mended myself. Now my husband is wondering if seconds are being sold???
3.0,Nice but needs under slip : (
3.0,"I purchased for my mother who has poor vision. After finally figuring out how to operate it, it does announce the time, but it looks and feels so cheaply made, and very bulky and masculine."
3.0,nice quality but personally too big
3.0,Probably would not order again.
3.0,"It is a really pretty scarf but it is a bit too short.  The picture makes it look like you can wrap it around your neck once and have it hang down, but it is too short to wrap around once."
3.0,"The material is nice, I love the lace and wish I could get one in my size but it was not true to size for me and ran too small"
3.0,"These pants are great quality and I was so hoping they would be a good fit for my husband b/c it is so hard to find pants this length!  However, the stride is very short.  They fit everywhere else but this.  I really don't get it b/c he has other RL pants that he can still wear.  Oh well.  Other than that, they look and feel great."
3.0,The shirt is no way near the size indicated. Fabric is soft and color is beautiful
3.0,"I loved the pattern! However it was very see through. Also it's extremely low in the front, definitely not as pictured. You would need to safety pin it."
3.0,Red crystal are are cheap looking.
3.0,"Loved the look, quality was great. Unfortunately it fit way smaller than expected, unfortunately we had to send it back."
3.0,They slip in and out of the frames with ease...
3.0,"I adore the look of this tutu. However, five minutes of wear and the stars are falling off. They’re stickers. WHY?! Still usable but garbage as far as obvious no stars integrated into fabric like much mesh."
3.0,"This dress looks different then the model wearing it. It has an empire waist instead of an Aline dress, which was what I wanted."
3.0,"I bought these for my son and he finds them comfortable enough to wear around the house for long stretches.  They don't seem to muffle loud sounds that well, but they dampen noise well enough.  I was not happy when the padding popped off after a few days but it was easy enough to snap the pieces back together.  These do the job well enough considering the affordable price."
3.0,I can only hand wash because it’s so delicate. Great fit though and great color. Lost button on first wash.
3.0,This dress is so pretty and my 7 yrs old daughter looks so nice on it. I ordered another one (pink) for my 3yrs old daughter but unfortunately they sent me the wrong size (5-6Y) and it's way too big for her.
3.0,"Love the dress, ordered up in size.......it fit, kinda, but little tighter than I like.  So...ordered up another size....this one is too big...actually huge.....armholes hang (hate that unless using for beach cover).  So now have reordered again in original size ordered...we will see!  Holding on to this one until new one comes in.  I'll take it in myself, if need be....The dress is really cute, so hope I can eventually end up with one that fits....planning on a cruise, and it will be perfect.....<br />If next one fits, I'll change my rating to 4, only because of size inconsistency.  Hoping it will wash well!"
3.0,"It's very nice looking and appears to be of much higher quality than the price.  However, it does not keep time accurately at all."
3.0,"Runs small, ordered a medium. I ordered the navy and they looked more grey. Ended up returning. I have a pair of joggers from Senita that I love and these aren't as good as those."
3.0,"I got a 3T, which is usually what my son wears but this seems to run smaller than what I was hoping."
3.0,Way too much fabric - I was swimming in it!
3.0,"They don’t stay up on your legs,had to keep pulling them up."
3.0,"This band seems to be good quality; but even fully extended, it’s not long enough to fit around my hand! My hand is about 3.5” when measured just across my knuckles, FYI. I’m not a small guy but this is the first “one size fits all” band I’ve encountered that I couldn’t even get past my hand!"
3.0,Very very small for price even though 14k and didn’t have any backing so don’t loose earring. If fell out.
3.0,Very comfy. Only downside is that the fabric started to show signs of rubbing after one wear!
3.0,"I normally wear a 14 or 16 top, which according to the seller's size chart means I should have ordered a L or XL.  I ordered an XXL because I really wanted it to be loose to wear over leggings.  First of all, it is too small through the middle.  I'm not particularly thick through the middle ~ pretty average, I think, but I don't like tops to cling, hence ordering up in size.  Secondly, it is nowhere near the length shown on the model.  I am 5'4"" and it doesn't come close to covering my rear end.<br />Otherwise, it's super cute and if you aren't carrying any extra ""baggage"" in your mid-section, it's a great top."
3.0,"I was expecting it to be a little bigger: got a little bit of a headache when I first wore it. If you have a bigger head, might want to try a different product!!"
3.0,"fabric fits stiff, not soft at all and it sticks together"
3.0,Returned: I ordered this dress in medium which is my normal size. The sleeves were snug but would have been okay if the chest fit well. The chest was too big. I am a 36B and I think this dress would fit well for someone larger in the chest area than I am.
3.0,This is a very flattering dress and it fits perfect . The only bad thing is I was needing a RED dress and it is far from red! It's more like a bright pink.
3.0,"Looks cute, good material. Is a little shorter and tighter than expected and I ordered one size up than my usual"
3.0,"The description states that these are compression tanks, but they are not. I love the vibrant colors and they are comfortable to wear. However I was looking for a more flattering tank for my belly fluff."
3.0,"Ok the dress looks just like the picture but does not fit like the picture.  I ordered a medium, I am 5'6.  The dress was much longer than it looks in the picture.  The bodice was also wider even when tightening the corset part in the rear as tight as humanly possible but allowing you the ability to breath. It didn't have the puff or flare at the bottom, it was heavier than I thought, it almost felt like a wedding dress.  I still like the dress but will probably have alterations made to it in order to get the look in the picture."
3.0,I ordered according to measurements but I have to return for an exchange. too big.
3.0,Spend a couple extra dollars and get the ones that flip up. I have both the flip up style much better.
3.0,Do not fit over hlasses
3.0,"I was really excited about this dress, but only to be disappointed that there were no holes for you to slip the string in to make it into a wraparound dress.  How was I going to wear this?!"
3.0,It broke about the third time wearing it. The clasp was weak from the start...very thin chain. She managed to turn it into something she could wear.
3.0,One of the hooks was missing when recieved package so you could not lace up. We're going to take to a shoe repair place to try to have fixed so we do not have to go through the return process.
3.0,The shirts were cute but to small in the breast section
3.0,They are so cute! I really love them but the package was a little damaged when it arrived so the glasses are a little crooked and one of the legs was a little loose.
3.0,Bottoms are quite big. Top is perfect but I would be worried to dry.
3.0,It's pretty but don't buy this for durability. The heart came out of the keychain two days after I had bought it :( I am going to attempt to super glue the heart back in place.
3.0,Fits great. Looks great with leggings. The writs detail is cute.
3.0,Necklace came broken but everything else was ok. Didn’t return bc other items were ok and we didn’t have time to return before Halloween.
3.0,I like the look and feel this bag but I do not like how there are so many pockets on the inside.  It causes my cell phone to get stuck in the smaller pockets. I have to put it in just right or it will not go all the way down. It’s too much of a hassle.
3.0,"I liked the dress at first, but washed it delicate cold cycle and hung to dry and it pilled and the color faded after one wash.."
3.0,"Should have read the reviews about adjusting the size. I apparently lack the skill to do it on my own, and cannot find info on you tube."
3.0,They were very durable but unfortunately had to be returned... There was no way to charge the watch without taking it apart everytime ...
3.0,Maybe I miss read the description! They are way to big for a newborn! I couldn’t use them for the occasion.
3.0,The sword itself looks nice. But it does not come with the little stand for it. The pics suggest it does and there are no other notes indicating different.
3.0,Neat product but no instructions included
3.0,Bag was a good size however it smells terrible.
3.0,Earrings too small for an adult but perfect for a girl.
3.0,Fits smaller than size says. Go a size bigger.
3.0,They were very cute but more purplet pink than hot pink. I wanted hot pink
3.0,"If your shoe is big, this isn't going to keep it on your feet. I would only use it if your foot is wiggling and you need a little stability."
3.0,Beautiful heart necklace but I expected the heart to be bigger and the necklace longer for the money.
3.0,"This keeper strap is comically short.  That's not an issue while you are wearing the sunglasses, but if you remove your glasses, the strap will have them snugged up to your neck so closely that you don't have much range of motion.  Three stars because the strap will prevent the loss or damage of your sunglasses...**if** you don't remove them and set them someplace, which you'll probably do, because the strap is absurdly short."
3.0,"I ordered this shirt for my husband because it is advertised as a men's shirt. I ordered his normal size and it is extremely small and short. It also has 2 seems on the back that make it appear to be a women's shirt. The sleeves are also short, almost capped looking which gives off feminine as well. He likes the print and will keep it but a little disappointed."
3.0,"This is definitely a weird shirt. The fabric, the fit, the cut, the style, even the design/colors. I was expecting some thing else. The fabric is a thick stretchy plastic blend I am sure. The style is cute, but the cut of the fabric sits funny across the breast. I think the color description could’ve been a little bit better online as well. They tried to make it look like gray sweatshirt material with pink and purple flowers on it. I thought that was a weird choice. Ironically, although this is not one of my favorite shirts, I do get quite a few compliments on it when I wear in"
3.0,Beautiful but definitely large and a bit heavy
3.0,I own lots of these dresses from this brand and I love them all. Unfortunately this one has a thinner fabric that the rest. Very unfortunate. Can’t be worn with any kind of underwear.<br />I don’t go comando to the office. So it’s useless.
3.0,"Pretty. Larger in size than expected. However, the thinnest part of the post, the part that goes through your ear, is unusually large. Not standard size for an ear piercing in the U.S. at least, where these were not made. Awkward and left my lobes sore at the end of the day."
3.0,"The shirt is okay For the price, I like the fabric its Light weight so it definitely would be good to wear to the beach or on a hot day. It’s a lose shirt with the ability to adjust the straps and The colors are also nice too!"
3.0,"The tankini top fit great...However, the bottoms were very big for a size small!"
3.0,"Got the XXL, very tight in the chest (40DD)<br />Fitted throughout. I'm not comfortable with this tight of a fit for my size so I returned it. Very pretty dress just not for me."
3.0,Too small for a large wrist. Wish it was bigger it is nice and stylish.
3.0,This set is kind of pretty but nothing I would have bought if I had seen it before I purchased it.  I returned it.
3.0,Im 5'10 and the top was more of a half top on me and the pants hang/ sag in the crotch. I had to get them taken up by a seamtress
3.0,"I like the bag and I am using it. Lots of compartments to organize contents. I like the card slots in the front zipper. A few negatives: leather is not good quality though it seems strong; could be a little wider as I can just about fit my coin purse in horizontally, strap could be a little longer."
3.0,I reviewed the NEOSAN Womens Beach Cover Up (Oversized Printed Swim Bikini Pool Wear) I was excited to try out this item because over the past year I have lost 60 pounds and I had to buy a new swimsuit so I was looking for an affordable cover up regardless. I ordered the &#34;bohemian green&#34; there's no size as it's one size fits all it arrived very quickly thanks to Amazon prime.<br />I wish this item wasn't too big for me. I wish it looked as good on me as it does on the model in the photo. The colors in person are just as vibrant and pretty but the fit was way off for me. Wayyyyy too big for my frame. It's an affordable cover up but it's probably better for ladies with more curve. For specs I'm 5'3 and I currently weigh 109 pounds.<br />Aside from the item being too big and being one size fits all I think if the company were to actually make sizes I'd buy it again in a heartbeat and get a small because I did like the material (very lightweight and soft) and the colors are pretty and vibrant.<br />I'd still recommend if you felt confident the cover up would fit you better and look better on you than it did on me. I didn't take any photos of me wearing it because it was very big on me and did not look flattering on me.<br />They have TONS of colors and designs! I give 3 out of 5 stars because it's only one size fits all and it's not for every body frame if you are short and thin it may not look very flattering on you.
3.0,"It is beautiful,  but upon arrival multiple gems had fallen out and the chain broke immediately.  It's all fixable... I guess you get what you pay for. Makes for an awesome costume/performance piece though"
3.0,Nice but rvery large I had to return it
3.0,Received in good order.
3.0,Really cute dress but did not fit me right. The area with the pockets stuck out so much and wouldn't lay flat. Made me look like i had huge hips so had to send it back.
3.0,The black looked the best. Looks more trendy than the other colors.  Other colors looks cheap
3.0,They are nice but I have long toes I guess because they were tight on my toes. One sock had a small hole in it but no biggie
3.0,Socks as pictured but too small for a man.
3.0,"Loved the jacket. I was very warm in NJ. However, the hood is extremely large. Like 4 heads could fit in it, that’s how huge it was. It never stayed on my head. That’s the only reason I’m giving it 3 stars instead of 5"
3.0,"I bought this for a wedding.  It's gorgeous, but it just fit so strangely on me.  I'm 5'4&#34;, and it seemed much larger on me than on the model.  Also, with the way the pleats around around the waist, it made my waist look huge.  Also minimized my bust.  It just didn't fit me well at all.  Returning it."
3.0,Came in the wrong color...
3.0,Plug wires did NOT fit my 2007 Chrysler town and country.
3.0,It was a very nice chain however even without wearing often the chain broke next to the clasp. It would have been much better if it was attached to the clasp in a more sturdy secure way.
3.0,"I ordered a medium, I'm a size six and it was way too short. Also the stitching was very poorly done."
3.0,"Great pattern, and the design looks great, but it's way too snug. At first I thought I'd purchased a child size on accident, but this is in fact an adult or one-size-fits all beanie. If your head is smaller than normal, this beanie is for you."
3.0,All is great except that it didn't come with the polarize mark on one side of the lense like how it was describe.
3.0,After reading reviews I order 2 pair in size small. I’m 5’3 110 lbs. They are tight on the waist and dig the crotch. I would have been much happier with a medium.
3.0,"Wasn't very soft, uncomfortable to wear but was made well. Just not my liking"
3.0,Honestly i love it but the problem is that the color is not the same. I don;t know if they sent me a coral tone and not the red one as in the picture or if the image is brighter and makes it look diferent.<br /><br />But anyways looks very nice.
3.0,"It does match the photo description and it very adorable, but the sizes are very large!!"
3.0,Good smell
3.0,"Ladies, if you looking for a cute, fitted sweatshirt to show off your svelte figure this sweatshirt is NOT for you! Be aware that these are standard adult/male sizes and a relaxed, classic fit.  Based on the size chart, I ordered a medium (I am 5'7&#34;, women's dress size 8/10, with athletic broad shoulders). If I was wearing the sweatshirt for lounging inside the house, I would've kept the medium, but since I wanted to wear the sweatshirt as part of a Halloween costume, I ended up exchanging it for a small so the sleeves wouldn't be so long. Amazon Prime delivery was very prompt and returns are incredibly easy - and free! My only criticisms of the sweatshirt is that it is a bit see-through in white and the sleeves are very baggy, which is good for moving around but not the most flattering look for women. Also, it might not be evident in the photos, but these sweatshirts have side panels, probably to accommodate any extra baggage people might be carrying around their midsection. Again, this is functional but not very flattering for those who don't need it. However, I appreciate the quality and durability of Russell Athletic gear and liked that it was available on Amazon Prime."
3.0,This watch wasn't exactly what I was expecting. It is a little flimsy and feels a little cheap. But I guess the price is okay for what you are getting. I am not super impressed.
3.0,"I was expecting a lot from this bra, bc of great reviews, but the underwire cuts into my wide set chest."
3.0,"I liked the glasses a lot.  Until I took them off and put them on top of my baseball cap as I usually do when indoors.  They broke in two right at the nose piece; the plastic frame is more brittle than one would expect. BUT for the price, I'll order them again and be a little more careful."
3.0,Liked the product however not true to size. Ordered XLARGE  they are more size medium
3.0,Lovvve it!!!
3.0,"I wish I liked these more, but they just slip off my feet. I'm a size 6.5-7 and bought the smaller size of these socks. Unfortunately I prefer barefoot yoga to wearing these."
3.0,The rings are really flat and don't fit most keys.
3.0,"The only problem I have is really wanted red pair, as I seen pictured and the set did not include one. They are very comfortable and of great quality. Just the colors that are pictured it isn't what I recieved. There is a dark red, and red black speckled that was not in the set."
3.0,"I love this set of earrings. The reason for a 3 star rating instead of 5 is because I gave the smaller ones to my daughters ages 6 and 13, I purchased these 5 months ago, and the clasp on the smaller ones have already broken completely off, however  I wear the other pairs daily, and have had no issues.  I love Stainless Steel because they never get rusty, or turn colors."
3.0,"The watch itself looks like the photo, so no complaints there, but it was shipped in a padded envelope.  No box. No manual.  Nothing.  Just a wooden watch.  I'm a bit embarrassed to give it as a gift with such poor presentation... Off to find a watch box I guess."
3.0,"My wallet was starting to split on one end, so I made a purchase.  I normally like to feel a wallet in person, but I took a chance.  The wallet is very shiny and slick, making it a little easy for pick pockets or slipping out of a pocket.<br />The quality is nice, but the large embossing of the brand and the features (RFID, etc) is a little bit gaudy.  It would be classier to have an insert card with that info, and not emboss the leather.  It says 100% leather, but the lining can't possibly be leather, so that claim is questionable.<br />I like the individual card pockets for sure.  I wish it had dual bill compartments, but one problem I had is that I put a MicroSD card in my bill compartment since that's where my valuable bills are, and didn't realize there is an opening in the bottom of the bill compartment, causing it to get lost.  Many family photos and other information were lost, along with my $20 high capacity memory card.<br />That said, this would make a great first wallet for a young man - and comes in an elegant gift box for a nice presentation."
3.0,"I gave this to my wife. Her job makes it hard to wear any decent jewelry; as such, this comes in great for its look and price point.<br />It has a good look and feel to it. The hasp stays on locked, and she's had no problems with it. It's color lets her wear it with most of her uniforms, and its simple look is great for daily use.<br />It's not expensive, and if it's lost, can always get another."
3.0,My phone is 5.5 inches and it doesn't fit. I have the Razr Maxx. Seller said any phone under 6&#34; would fit.
3.0,"I loved everything about these pants, except the color.  I will get the light sand color dirty 30 minutes after I put them on.  So I am sending them back.  Please Quicksilver more colors or at least a color (darker tan) that will not get dirty so easy."
3.0,These are cute but very uncomfortable. The straps across are not stretchy at all making them quite tight. They seem like they're made from decent material but unfortunately i will not be able to wear these at all.
3.0,"This bag is cute, simple and durable. However, it’s a bit smaller than expected and overpriced."
3.0,The print is awesome and the letter on receipt was nice but there is a flaw in the fabric around the neck.
3.0,I loved this bracelet but the second time I wore it one of the strings came loose.  I have returned it.
3.0,For a cotton flannel it has a it of a scratchy feel. Not like the others I've purchased from them in the past which were very soft.
3.0,This is a 2 pack of Spider-Man shorts. A little thick and not a lot of room- pretty true to size! Good for playing at the park and other active events. Play clothes basically.
3.0,Was pretty pleased with product . My only neg I wish the back was stronger but you get what you pay for right. Overall good product for the price.
3.0,"I was looking for workout tank tops and these were highly rated and advertised. The fit was good, I got my normal size and had no complaints in the fit. I personally didn't like the material which was mesh, almost like those practice soccer jerseys. I was expecting a cotton blend or some polyester, but I guess I should have read all the details. I also really don't like the y-back because it is itchy for me, but that's just personal and probably not a problem for the average guy. All in all, if you don't mind the y-back and you want a very breathable mesh material, then you will love these tanks. They are just not my preference, but nothing wrong with the product. The product is good and as advertised."
3.0,Ordered twice and got the wrong stats.  That's the reason for 3 stars.  I went direct with the company and they shipped what I needed in a few days.  If I could rate that part I'd be a 5 star.
3.0,Poor surface finish
3.0,"I normally wear a size 10 but I ordered up so I could wear with thick socks. It's a good thing I did because these boots run small. They are okay for the price, not what I was expecting."
3.0,"I love this hoodie.  It's comfortable, fits perfectly.  It's the perfect thing to wear on a cool Arizona morning.  But.  I had it less than a week, wore it only to go outside, hadn't washed it yet and it started pilling up all over.  On a new item, having it less than a week, it shouldn't be pilling"
3.0,"Very good for the price. The yarn on one begun to unravel, but I was able to fix it. They look good and help keep your calves warm."
3.0,"I love Icebreaker and this has all the quality you'd expect, but the Chute needs to be bigger or stretchier for my man-sized noggin and neck. Had the Cool-lite version before I lost it, and that wasn't as constricting.  Both versions need to be a about two inches longer to make for an effective (ear-covering) beanie."
3.0,Ripped after a month maybe. Not good for active little ones
3.0,"The watch in general is quite stylish. Not really a fan of the rather small date window however, which is hard to see with less than perfect vision. Other than the date, I really like this watch for the price."
3.0,Very thin and somewhat itchy but just fine for the cost.
3.0,I got this for my daughter’s Angel Halloween costume. The feathers kept falling off until most of the cardboard wings could be seen.
3.0,"Doesn't fit as pictures, but when washed doesn't shrink looks nice I'm 5,6"" 135 lbs I ordered a medium sleeves come to my wrists and the length just passed the top of my pants."
3.0,"Nice color and nice leather, I don’t like all of the different compartments makes very difficult to find anything. I bought it for more of a tote for work but that didn’t work for me."
3.0,Didn’t like. Not as advertised.
3.0,"It looks great, but after about 2 weeks of wearing it, it broke... poorly made and disappointed."
3.0,"I like the eye glass holder, but there were stones missing from the white one.  They were in the bag loose<br />I tried to glue them in, but it doesn't look all that great."
3.0,"I just got this unit, looks nice and is quiet. However the product details say specifically ""and multiple Turns Per Day settings."" So far based on the instructions and unit, that is not true at all. And the default and only setting is insanely high. Most Automatic Watches from what I have seen recommend 600-800 Turns per day. I had to manually figure out the TPD on this model cause it's not listed  but it runs at over 4000 turns per day. 2 minutes one direction (15 turns) 6 minutes rest, and 2 minutes the other direction (15 turns). Which if on all of the time would be over 4000 TPD. The whole point of a watch winder is to keep the automatic watches you are not wearing running until you wear them again. Having to turn the box on for a few hours a day and then turn it off 3 or 4 hours later defeats the whole purpose of setting and forgetting. Over all not a bad deal considering the price, but definite false advertising which doesnt give me confidence it will last very long or function well through time..."
3.0,"Nice feel to the material and they seem to be good quality, but I couldn't wear them because they were much larger than expected.  I ordered a 2X (I typically wear a size 22 so assumed 2X would fit) but these were too loose.  I purchase panties with spandex to give me a little control, so being too loose defeats the purpose."
3.0,"These are actually quite uncomfortable as it. The underlining was designed on someone who doesnt like loose fitting underwear. That, but coupled with my large thighs, I felt very constricted while wearing these. On top of that, they were a bit too short, essentially underwear."
3.0,Button keeps popping off. Had to use gorilla glue to wear them again.
3.0,Too big-3T was more like a 4T
3.0,"Too small, but it's very pretty. I will get it tailored to fit better"
3.0,"So I really loved these at first...<br />However the rubber around the earrings randomly fall off and half the time you can’t find it to put back on.<br />So I decided to chance my luck by ordering a second pair,  hoping that I just got a bad set.<br />& To my surprise the same thing happened with the second pair.<br />I’m really disappointed because I really adored them!"
3.0,"I liked the way the dress was made except that it was way too long (yes, I'm 5'4"", but it was still really long).I also loved the colors - ordered one in powder blue and one in teal (may not be the actual color names, but close).  I did NOT like the fabric.  it was thin and clingy.  Might be OK for a tall thin person, but not for me.  I would feel like I was going out in my jammies!"
3.0,Doesn't fit like the picture at all. Has a really weird material  I would get 2 sizes up
3.0,It's nicer in the picture. It's a large hat for my small head and think it is more for fashion than for warmth with fashion.
3.0,"These are decent for the price and are shiny, came nicely sealed. Only problem is that the product says the key earrings are about 2inches. I was excited as that is the exact size I was looking for. These are cute, but the earring is just about 1 inch in length. So they were just smaller than expected, still good."
3.0,"Usually wear s-m i ordered a m, bottom was fine, but the top was small for me. The triangle is a bit small for my breast. I wear a 34d."
3.0,"Cute, but really flimsy and cheap feeling"
3.0,"The print is amazing! However the material it's made of is super super stiff, my head looks so boxy with the hat on. I'm going to have to wash it or something to make it look more comfy/natural on the head"
3.0,Nice quality although the green is much lighter in person than in the photos.
3.0,"Nice eyeware but too big for my face, so Returned them."
3.0,"I like the shoe itself, and it looks great and is comfortable.  The problem is the laces are too short to lace and too loose to be a secure fit.  They either need to be secured tighter like some other Skecher's slip ons I have, or they should come with longer laces.  The bottom is foam and wears fast as well.  1 star off for laces, 1 star off for soles.  3 stars for comfort as they are very comfortable, adn look great as well."
3.0,"Poorly constructed, too small even after following the sizing chart, and bottoms are much shorter than shown."
3.0,"We loved the fit and design. However, the first time age wore them the sole came off of one of the shoes. I used gorilla glue to reattach and it was good, then the sole completely fell off of the other. Not sure if I want to risk buying her another pair. I wear the same brand shoes and I have not lost a sole."
3.0,The swim suit was large.  So am I ....  The surprising part was that the were very long reaching down to my calf .  I have to say I got more stare when I headed out to the pool that I have ever received.  The were worth the laugh that my wife had when I modeled them.
3.0,"Nice pattern qnd very comfortable to wear!  Size is little bit smaller then it is suppose to be, perfect for walking, gym or anytype workout"
3.0,It’s really pretty and I get compliments on it. What I don’t like about it is that if I move my wrist back and forth the band gets loose. I’m always having to tighten it so it won’t fall off.
3.0,It has pockets! Not as flattering as I’d like but it’s a cute summer dress.
3.0,"This tool is ok but I still have issues getting my bracelets on quickly, still takes a bit of time."
3.0,So small they don't stay on my feet.  I have size 9 1/2 medium feet.
3.0,"I ordered both black and gray, size medium, versions of glove.  Both were snug on my usually medium sized hand, but the black ones were very slightly smaller than the gray ones.  Thus, the gray ones were OK, the black ones too tight.  They are both very thin on material. but for the price, if you get the right size, they are satisfactory.  At least from a short period of trial."
3.0,"These socks fit a little bit tighter than I expected. I'll have to wear them more to see if they get more comfy after more wears. They are on the thicker side too. The packaging needs more marketing and branding support because of the following found on the paper labels, ""recommended for recycling us,"" and ""do not drop it away after less washing."" What does this mean? Also, they are claiming that there's copper in the socks... I suppose this makes it somewhat antimicrobial? Overall, socks feel somewhat generic aside from the copper content claim."
3.0,Great for the hot tub
3.0,Little heavy on the finger.
3.0,Nice shirt way too small. I purchase a 12 and it look like a 7/8. I’m giving it to younger kids who likes  fortnight 😕
3.0,My mother loved them 😍
3.0,"Nowhere near as “full” as pictured, and just average construction. You get what you pat for on this scarf."
3.0,These are heavy and can be hard to breathe in when talking a lot. I’m a teacher and I have to catch my breath sometimes when wearing these. One can without the adjustable piece on the strap.
3.0,Must order size down!!!! Small is too large
3.0,"Ordered cause it was meant to come with matching bands and face covers.<br /><br />I received the bands, which look nice but the bright purple face cover was a very light, navy blueish pink color.<br /><br />Everything else seemed ok but I ordered for the purple."
3.0,"Okay, but pricey! Some sort of oily stain on it only worn once."
3.0,BOUGHT IT TOO SMALL HAVENT USED IT
3.0,"Looks nice, but not comfortable.  the top is scratchy and VERY padded.  The bottom half is fine.  I'm not big chested by any means, but the top did pinch."
3.0,Just a decent cover up to wear on my upcoming trip.
3.0,I wanted to use these outdoors around a pool (for swim meets). I intentionally ordered non polarized because polarized can make it more difficult to read certain screens. The glasses are comfortable enough and the style pretty cool but the glare that comes in through the side is unbearable and the lenses themselves are not very tinted.  I would like to exchange them for a better fitting pair but they are un-returnable now.
3.0,"Bought these in 2T for my LO as they were transitioning out of 18mo pjs. While the rest of the 2T pjs now fit great (some even on the big side yet), these barely fit over his head and arms. They were a good ‘in between’ size for us but will be too small very soon."
3.0,"The fabric is pretty thin and see-through, so you need to wear a tank top underneath. The shirt is also pretty long, which is not my preference. Otherwise, it's a good basic white shirt."
3.0,The quality is good (materials) but it is MUCH smaller than I thought. It's virtually useless as a locket.
3.0,returned lens too large
3.0,"Nice, thought better quality."
3.0,am not a fan of the material.  I would rather have it be cotton or rayon (something that moves fluidly)
3.0,They are cute but not good quality
3.0,This were very small I wasn't happy about them
3.0,Fabric too rough. Definitely not Chiffon or close. Will wear like iron.<br />Washable under cold delicate cycle though label says hand wash.
3.0,Very cute little tutu but the stars do fall off easily.  Was a little on the small size for my 7 years old granddaughter but perfect for the 3 year old.
3.0,"Light, not strong enough, feels cheap, will update after my trip to Europe, i am hoping it would survive but i dont think soo....."
3.0,My only direct is that I've been wearing it less than a month and it is already peeling
3.0,I saw this dress many years ago and fell in love with it. I did not order it at the time because this dress did not come in plus sizes. I have since lost weight and looked for this dress again. I finally found it and ordered the XL size. I got the dress today and was worried the dress might be too tight across my tummy but it was tight across the chest instead. The good news is that I’m still losing weight and a minimizing bra will bring me in so I can wear the dress now if I want. Another thing. The picture shows a neon yellow stripe in the dress with orange and khaki. The dress I got was neon green with orange and grey. I was disappointed in that but the dress is still pretty. The chiffon material is thin so I will be getting a full slip to go underneath for coverage. Lastly the stitching is not the best but giving the dress a good pressing will lay the stitching down. For $6 I would say I came out pretty good. I suggest making the dress in larger sizes and cut it more generously in the chest area. Also make the dress in the color combo pictured too. I gave three stars because of fit in the chest area and wrong color combo received.
3.0,Looks pretty but it's too big for me. I guess i can fix the sleeves but i was a bit disappointed by the size fail. The color is great and the shoulders are cute.
3.0,"I am a woman and I love the strong, polished metal look of the hoops.  The size and weight are exactly as I expected.  I wore a pair camping  and swimming this weekend and they still look great.  I am a bit disappointed with the studs.  The weight and finish is just as nice as the hoops but the post of the studs is too thick.  I could not put them in my ear without discomfort.  I am keeping the set because I like the hoops."
3.0,"After reading reviews saying of your order your typical size, it’ll be skin tight, I thought I should size up. I’m usually a 2-4 in clothes so I ordered a 6, it was way to big and and was super bagging in my waist. Definitely should’ve ordered the size 4. Also, the hook and eye at the top of the zipper gets caught in the crochet/lace and pulls on it, it snagged and pulled part of the crochet off from the seem."
3.0,not very heavy but nice
3.0,"I bought this item for a cosplay event and, while it served it's purpose wonderfully, it does feel a bit cheap (granted, it is cheap)."
3.0,"Were very cute for my 4 little girls ages 5,6,8 & 9 and they liked them to! I thibk the price could be a little cheaper though."
3.0,"Absolutely stunning! I wish you’d make this in more gemstones, I’d buy them all!!<br /><br />Update: unfortunately I had to return it after a few days because it turned my finger green. I have lots of sterling silver rings that don’t do this so I’m not sure if it’s a reaction on my part or the type of silver. Very disappointed because I loved it!"
3.0,They shipped quickly and I like packing in cubes.  My only complaint is that I have only used them twice and the mesh is breaking away from the seams.
3.0,"I was shocked at how small these shoes were, not true at all to size, and I own multiple shoes in this brand. The quality could have been better, in my opinion -- very little support from the upper."
3.0,So short
3.0,"I LOVED this outfit, it just wasn't meant for my body type.  I am 5'10'' and 150#, hour glass shape.  I have a long torso which is where the problem was.  It fit perfectly width, in the hips, and such but I am just too long length wise.  It was all up in the business area, not attractive.  But other that that it is beautiful.  If you have a shorter torso this will work for you."
3.0,"Ankle part of the sock is too loose, so it runs down alot. but the grip is not bad, and compared to the other socks on amazon, the price is pretty good."
3.0,"While the pattern is beautiful and the fabric has a lot of movement this skirt is far from free size. It may work out for smaller plus size ladies but the cut of the skirt is not wide enough throughout. That being said if you wear normal sizes this skirt is fun and a good addition to summer. It is lightweight so it feels airy and the bright colors are great in the sun. Overall it is a pretty skirt but if you are over a size 20, I wouldn't bother."
3.0,"I will add pictures later as I’ve repacked them not sure if I’m going to return them yet. They are NOT champagne/ivory looking like the site shows and says but rather an ugly pale yellow. The design is as shows and the sparkle are pretty, but this dress does NOT poof out at all - Not even a little bit. Will definitely need to purchase a petticoat for it if I decide to keep them. The flowers are just thrown in there with pins to put on yourself and are smushed from being shoved in the bag, and one of them was missing the big bow for the dress (which is also on a pin) and looked returned - shoved in the bag, missing the bow, flowers already on and all wrinkled. I may keep them to avoid the hassle, but if I’d known this beforehand, I would not have purchased them."
3.0,my bro in law didn't really like the material all the much or look.
3.0,There nice but run really small
3.0,"It's just OK.  My fault for not reading more closely.  Thought I was buying a metal sign but it's just plastic.  Wish it was metal.  Seller delivered faster than expected, though."
3.0,They fit more like a normal pair of boxer briefs and not really like compression shorts. I'd get a size smaller.
3.0,"The necklace continues to shift throughout the day, so it is difficult to set it at a specific length on your chest. If that doesn't bother you, you will like it."
3.0,"I think these shorts are a good overall value, but they run small.  I have other RBX shorts and have loved them; but these should have been ordered in a size larger than their mostly cotton counterparts.  That's what I get for not reading the reviews before ordering."
3.0,Got what I paid for.  Enough said.
3.0,sizes run small.  For the first time in my life I had to return to order a XL.  Hopefully that fits when it arrives
3.0,For the price of $19.99 this is a great dress but my 7year old daughter is small and slim. This dress is short and wide. If it was for a nice formal event it fits so poorly I would send it back. Luckily we are using it for a costume party so it will work.
3.0,i didn't wear it for what i bought it for  runs small
3.0,Came small. Not as warm as I thought. Are cute
3.0,"Pretty, several of the pins broke while putting onto frame.  Plastic is not really soft like original.  Equal to price..."
3.0,"Cheap material, very thin and silky. it's shorter in length than I thought. It is pretty, and with a belt and accessories it's nice"
3.0,They are sharp to look at but VERY difficult to get on for everyday wear.
3.0,"My top didn’t fit at all, but the bottoms fit really good. They are so soft till you was them a couple times"
3.0,Too small in the breast area and fabric does not give.
3.0,Needs some supporting strap near neckline.. good fabric.. good fit
3.0,I liked everything but the necklace was not in package
3.0,"The top is gorgeous, but be aware the sizes run small."
3.0,Some is good but it mix with different material
3.0,Runs small<br />Pretty color<br />Not light weight
3.0,Very very long!! Beautiful but so long!!
3.0,"Decent shirt .  Soft, feels kinda feels rubbery fabric. Alittle thick .not happy with the qualityOver all it's pretty baggy .. in the chest and back .. it's a odd fit."
3.0,Bought 2 pair. Extremely comfortable and stretchy but the pant length is wildly different on my 2 pairs. I picked the same size both times and double checked. 1 pair is regular pant length and covers my ankles. The other is basically a pair of capris and barely goes past my shin. Not good for winter and not happy about it.
3.0,"Great jacket, but the sleeves are not long enough,  few more inches would make  a big difference.<br />I order a medium and the sleeves are 4' short from my wrist."
3.0,"Cute, material not as I expected but I still like the print. Only thing is the shirt doesn't stay off my shoulders."
3.0,This bag didn't work as good as I hoped for the zipper was hard to pull. The pockets were to narrow
3.0,"Seemed like good product, sizing runs small."
3.0,"I didn’t like the material.  It was not as soft as I’d hoped.  The best way I can describe it was that it was thicker than I expected so it didn’t hang straight down, but flared out.  I returned it without any problems."
3.0,Those are both 7 - 8 years. The vest was too big for my 9 year old. And it's very wide. So if your son has a thin build pls look some where else
3.0,La talla no se corresponde y lo tuve que regalar
3.0,"I ordered a size XL. I am 5'4&#34; but have a long torso.  I wear a 12 or 14 in bluejeans, size 10 dress, bra size 38 D, and weigh 155 lbs.  I ordered this cute vintage style swimsuit with the hope that even though it had been reviewed as short wasted, I could make it work....no such luck.  The size XL fit everywhere else.  It was billed as a size 10/12 and fit as a 10/12 just short wasted.  It would have been quite cute, if I could get past the riding up in the back or down in the front due to the lack of overall length, and top support.  I would have gone with at least 4 stars for the style alone (sucker for vintage clothing), but the fabric is a bit thin (expected for the price), and the bust does not even have one of those cheesy elastic band shelf bras.  The lightly padded cups are sewn directly to the suit.  That offers some coverage in the bust area, but no-none-zilch support.  Basically if you are over the age of 30 or have more than a B cup this may not be the best suit...unless you are cool with scooping the girls up all day and affixing them, yet again, where they belong.  It IS super cute, so if I could get past the permanent wedgie I might have considered wrangling my boobs back in to place all day.  :)  For all of you long torso-vintage lovers-with larger busts try this suit instead (link at the end).  I bought the 2X and it fits perfectly. First bikini I have felt comfortable wearing since high school...and my husband loves the retro pin-up styling, and says it makes me look thinner ( bonus) while highlighting my curves( double bonus)!  :)  [[ASIN:B01G1E0N0A Angerella Women Polka High Waisted Bikinis Swimsuits Swimwear(BKI046-N1-2XL)]]<br /><br />**update**  found a similar one piece by Cocoship that fits much better!  the style in the picks looks identical but intead of the &#34;boy -short&#34; style bottom that ride up, it has elastic that keeps the suit down and in place.  I ordered it in a size 14 in the green.  The 14 fits like this cherry design suit in the 2X size but the waist is a little longer.  still not a bunch of support in the top, but the longer waist helps with that a bit too, just because the cups sit where they are supposed to.  [[ASIN:B019HXRP7G Cocoship Green 50s Retro Solids Inspired Classic One Piece Vintage Sheath Swimsuit Skirted Front Bathing Suit 16(FBA)]]  This is the link.  :)"
3.0,Has no flexibility very stiff. But looks nice
3.0,"My grandson loves these shoes, but the toe seam is coming apart after less than 2 months."
3.0,"This blouse seems well made and has nice fabric. Overall it could have been a lovely blouse if it hadn't been just a bit too snug for my taste. I wasn't wild about the choker neck either, it was also a bit on the snug side. I'd probably order a size larger if I had to do it over again."
3.0,Be aware they have no palms so you can only show the back of your hands.  The glove have Velcro fasteners at your wrist to hold them on.  They are well made and look good.
3.0,"I like these, but for some reason, the back of both grey pairs have started to unravel in the seam of the elastic waistband. The black pairs are totally fine though. They're comfortable and super soft. I've only worn them about five or six times each."
3.0,"I’m 5’3” about 105lb. and the fit was too loose in the upper portion, not flattering."
3.0,"I give it 3 stars for appearance and quality. Unfortunately the belt is shorter than advertised. The website claims it is 49&#34;, the belt is embossed with a 48, but I measured the belt and it is just under 46&#34;. I returned this belt only because of the size, too bad because it looks like a nice belt. This is not my first ratcheting belt but it is the first one that was not long enough. My other ones were way TOO long and I had to trim a few inches from them. I don't know why the manufacturer couldn't spare a couple more inches, or at least get the length correct in their ad."
3.0,I absolutely love this dress but when it arrive it was wrinkled so I ironed/steamed it last night and the dress literally melted. Beautiful dress if you dont plan to iron it
3.0,I ordered this to use the hat and scarf on a decorative snowman Christmas decoration. It is very small for a child and not real thick and warm. Good for what I needed it for. You may want something more substantial for a child.
3.0,"My son loves these jammies. However, after one wash they shrink significantly; like to the point where it's a belly shirt on him. Let's put it this way: he's a size 3T and rocks the Catboy belly shirt while the same 3T Gecko jammies fits my 14 month old. Both are normal sized kids."
3.0,"looks just like picture, but was a bit too big."
3.0,"Although I like the color and size but the pin slides the opposite which causes the watch to fall, I can not believe the manufacturer short sightedness! I just received it yesterday and as I test which hole the pin should hold or go in the slot, I notice that it slides to the other side and I could lose my expensive watch, I am just disappointed and do not feel like having to waste more time to return."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:b0563cc9fa8846482510c0379322c0b2]] So the ""s"" rod feature is not as in the product's description. They both face the same direction rather than to look like a mirrored ""s"". I'm not happy about this<br />Also a little smaller than I thought it'd be but it works out 💁‍♀️<br />It's okay"
3.0,"These masks are well made and form-fitting, a little too form-fitting. The only problem we had is that it is very difficult to breathe with these,  making it uncomfortable and more likely to pull them away from the face to get air, which defeats the purpose of being protected. If these were more breathable, I'd give them 5 stars."
3.0,"This item sizing chart was off more than a size so order at least two sizes up, not just one. It's exactly as pictured except for the size. The large size in the purple dress fits my daughter, who is a size 1/2."
3.0,Let me start out by saying that I have these pants in black and absolutely love them. I get so many compliments when I wear them. I ordered the Navy pants just like the black ones. The fit is still amazing but I washed them once and the seams are coming apart. I wanted to personally contact the company but I’m not even sure how to do that. I would really just like a new pair to replace these.
3.0,Material no es muy bueno
3.0,Look like I paid for it &#34;very cheap&#34;
3.0,"Cute, but not real. Very stiff and cheap."
3.0,"Cute and fit ok, but the thumb on one hand had the touch pad sensitive part on the back, rather than the front, making it useless. I returned."
3.0,"Looks flimsy out of the package, but not bad in your hair.  Doesn't really grip very well.  But it looks cute for the money."
3.0,"Fits a little loose even on last loop, I love the design and craftsmanship overall. I wish it fit a little tighter. Love it."
3.0,My husband received this for his birthday and has worn it a few hours now and the seams are coming apart.  The hood and shoulder are open and the sleeve is unraveling.  he has just been lounging.  A little disappointed but this was affordable so we are now making this a at home only hoodie.
3.0,"I am updating this for now from 1 to 3 stars since Wiki customer service reached out and sent me a replacement umbrella. So A+ for customer service. But I'm not going up to 4 or 5 stars until I use this replacement umbrella and test if the next one breaks as well.<br /><br />After using for a short time, a light breeze came thru and the entire umbrella arm snapped. Very disappointing that an outdoor product would not be built sturdy enough and can only be used in absolutely calm sun conditions."
3.0,"cute and would use more often but with kids, im hesitant because it doesnt provide enough protection"
3.0,still really comfy!
3.0,"It looks really cute, but as other reviewers have said it does fit small. There is an odd lining and it doesn't move as freely as I would like while sleeping. But if you want to try it on and stand there it would probably be ok.<br />It's just not as functional as I had hoped it would be."
3.0,Service was excellent.  Product runs a little small in size.  Fit was okay because I am so short.
3.0,body was cut very narrow so it is very open on sides instead of draping as the style should
3.0,"Arrived folded neatly in a sliding zip top style plastic bag with brand logo on it.  I loved the shade of aqua, loved the soft stretchy fabric.  The fabric felt really smooth and cool to the touch and very comfortable.  I wear a small in women's shirts and I ordered this in a small.  The strip of fabric behind the neck looks cool and keeps the top from falling off your shoulders.  I loved the look from the chest up.  The sleeves aren't cap sleeves they are a little longer and make arms look slimmer.  Shirt was a little loose in chest but not oversized.  The waist and hips is where it gets weird.  If you have a very long torso it might fit great but on my average to short torso it looked odd.  It came past my hips before it flared, making it look like some strange oompa loompa tunic.  Really bell shaped and flared out a lot lower than the widest part of my body creating a very unnatural shape.  The material was great, length would be perfect with leggings, loved the color and the neckline and sleeves.  The weird hip thing means it's going back.  On a larger person or someone very tall it might be great.  Not so much on me."
3.0,It’s a very cute lightweight jacket. The pockets are so small that my daughter couldn’t fit her hands in the pockets.
3.0,I was disappointed to get these and find that only 1 side adjusts. These would be perfect if both sides were adjustable. It's lopsided when I wear it. Other than that it's very comfortable.
3.0,"nice product, just toooooo small"
3.0,"My husband loved this watch. Its stylish and has a highend look. Its a bit bulky though and would sometimes cut into his wrist making a red mark. This wasnt a huge deal. The real con is that one of the wrist straps came unattached after just 5 months of everyday wear. We cant figure out how to fix it and for a watch this is poor craftsmanship. It should be constructed better. The straps themselves are silicon. So while we loved this watch, my husband was unable to get the full value of wearing it because of this issue."
3.0,Much smaller than the picture. Still Pretty though.
3.0,"I got the blue suede ones, size 8, and although they looked great on, the point was too snug for me and it was uncomfortable, making my big toe hurt. I tried going half a size up, but my toe would still rub against the point and the shoes would even slip off. I would recommend trying them on for a while, it might just be something with my toes :("
3.0,The Costume was really great and put together really well however the size came too big for my daughter.  So the run on joke now is that she will have too grow into it.
3.0,"1st off, they are too big for my face. And not all of them are mirrored."
3.0,It’s the same has the picture above if you have bigger bust and your medium the top it’s tight I would give four stars but I have seen that the price is high ...(quality not bad but if you paying $15 do not buy quality could be cheap for that price )
3.0,"Husband likes this kind of wallet, so the purchase is for him.<br />Leather and look are quite nice.<br />Would be a solid 5 for the price, look and function, but it doesn't expand as much as he would like.  That being said, it has made him cull out unused cards, receipts etc.  Might be a good thing in the long run."
3.0,"Okay. First - the good. They are absolutely adorable and fit as expected. I LOVE the embroidered design and think these are the cutest ever. The sole is soft and feels nice and you can tell it has been hand sewn into the shoe. Now, here's the bummer. The embroidered pandas are super rough feeling atop the toes. Personally, I was hoping to wear these without socks but the irritation is very noticeable and not comfortable at all. I found a &#34;quick fix' - I have tons of fleece scraps from old projects, so I cut to shape and attached it with a thin piece of double sided tape - temporary solution for the no socks look. I didn't want to try fabric glue for something more permanent because I was afraid it would seep through the fabric of the shoe and stain/ruin the appearance. It makes walking in them more bearable but I really wish there had been a softer fabric/guard or something put in place to have prevented the irritation and the need to &#34;fix it yourself&#34; in the first place. Still totally love the look, just a bit frustrated about the discomfort and work on my end for a more comfortable fit.<br /><br />ps - slight glue stains on the outside of shoe (in pics) but nothing that would jump out at the naked eye."
3.0,"Just like others also said, they’re cool piercings but they sent me the wrong size too, mine are all too small! Now I have 10 that don’t fit!"
3.0,Size was too small
3.0,"Returned it, wasn't as nice as in picture."
3.0,"Took forever to get , the concept is nice but the watch band is cheap and started too come apart."
3.0,"I like the colors. They are cute and comfortable, but ONLY TWO pairs fit me. The other four pairs are very small and  I can't wear them."
3.0,"I like the size, was perfect, and what I did not like is a big Advertisement printed in the back of the shirt!  what is that about?  This was a gift and not OK"
3.0,"the tab at the end of heal is for looks, its only 1/2 the size of the photo doesnt do anything. the sock is thin material which is good, but the sock ends up slipping off the heal and ending up as 1/2 a sock on your foot. I did order the correct size for woman not the issue. the seller shipped usps which i requested prime delivery. usps cant read usually ends up delivery to wrong address and street if you get it at all."
3.0,"I really liked the socks. Lovely color, comfortable, warm. Just what I was looking for. However, they run large. Way too big for my size 8 or 8 1/2 foot. I could not wear them with a boot. They would fold over and cause discomfort.  I hope my husband is as fond of the color as I am, because I am going to have to give them to him. A little bummed."
3.0,"The fabric was lovely, but they just didn't fit me right. I'm a pretty consistent 10/12 so if you're at the top of the size range, these might not be for you."
3.0,runs way small
3.0,Ok quality. Good length to wear with leggings. Sleeves are tight and material can be clingy. Other than that it's an ok shirt.
3.0,"The suit is thin and not double lined.  It is doable and I'll still keep and use it, but if it was double lined - at least in the crotch area it would be great!"
3.0,Purchased as a gift for a friend to replace a similar bag that was wearing out.  Nice looking and soft leather but she was disappointed that it was one zippered pocket less than her previous bag.  She had used the bag for 2 days so I didn't think it could be returned.  Nothing wrong with the bag..just a personal choice.
3.0,"After reading the reviews I ordered a size up. The pants fit fine but the shirt was tight in all the wrong areas. The fabric is also not soft, it’s almost scratchy"
3.0,Like the looks and color. Dislike the way it washed.
3.0,These came smaller than I expected.  That could have been my fault.  Just be cautious.<br />The material was scratchier than I would have liked.  Nice concept.<br />The color is as advertised as well as the length.
3.0,This bathing suit is a nice color and nice material but the fit around the breast is annoying and small in some spots and large in others.
3.0,like suit but ran small
3.0,Have only been using these since Christmas and the touchscreen pads have already begun to peel.  3 stars because they still do a good job of keeping my hands warm while holding onto the steering wheel.  Disappointed that they are already wearing out.
3.0,"Good quility, nice and clean cut. Only down fall is at seam where waist is and end of sleeves the fabric at the end curls up. Ironed it but did not solve the problem"
3.0,Looks masculine. Had to return it
3.0,"Purse was very nice.  but I had to return.  After 2 weeks, stitching stated to come undone at the bottom of the bag. Otherwise bag is large enough to fit  everything, notebook, books and plenty other stuff."
3.0,"I can normally wear a womens's US size Medium, approximately a size 8.  I ordered a 2XL which is supposed to be a US size 14 and it was still too small.  The upper arms were tight, the sleeves a little short and too tight across the back when you cross your arms in front of you.  Very disappointing since I went way over the size I needed and it is a nice coat.  Returns look easy though."
3.0,I am a big fan of thinoptics. I decided to try these as a cheaper alternative. The glasses are well made and the nosepiece is soft but the overall construction is much stiffer than the more expensive model and they pinch my nose to the point of discomfort. I won’t return them because they can be used in a pinch (pardon the pun).
3.0,On the cheaper side
3.0,works well for an evening out with few items in it
3.0,"The shirt is really cute. However, the material is very thin, especially the shoulder straps. After receiving the product and being able to see it up close, it is definitely not work the $21.98 I paid for it. I think the quality of the material makes it worth maybe $10.00. The tank makes for a decent lounge shirt though."
3.0,Had to return it was a bit tight so make sure to order a size up or higher
3.0,"Hubby was looking forward his new boxers, but was disappointed with the lack of softness - material is on the stiff side, so he was not happy.  I tried washing multiple times to soften, but the material (cotton / span / nylon) but wasn't able to make them more comfy.<br /><br />I'll know to be more mindful of material blends before I purchase the replacements."
3.0,I think 3.5 stars would be a better assessment. Not bad but not great. Decent buy for the money but they did come with a weird smell. Don’t know what it’s treated with but ughhhh. Definitely air it out a few days before wearing. Overall build quality seems pretty decent.
3.0,"This is a pretty sweater. The snow pattern is cute and as same as shown in the picture, which is perfect for winter, especially Christmas season. However, it feels a little thin, and the knitting is a little loose. So I feel the shape wouldn’t main well after wearing and washing. So, it’s still a good holiday sweater, but if you are looking for a high quality and long last sweater, this wouldn’t be the choice."
3.0,"I followed the instructions given to work out the socks, when I pulled them up on my first wear, I heard a tear. Worn them the rest of the day and were very good and comfortable, please advise on how to handle this tear."
3.0,"The hat came packaged flat, so it doesn't look as full and formed as in the picture. I'm hoping I can steam and reform the sinamay so that it looks better, but pretty annoying that I have to do that to begin with."
3.0,Material isn’t the greatest. After a couple wears I noticed a pin hole.
3.0,Good product except some lights arrived in not quite working manner. some lights would not work but you could take them apart and bend the light wire to make them work. mostly all worked but a few did not.
3.0,"The fabric on the dress was decent. When I tried it on It seemed a little crooked in the front, after some adjusting I think I got it to fall more evenly. Unfortunately it was too big under the arms so I had to return it. I’m small busted, so may work better on someone not so small on top."
3.0,"These gloves arrived promptly and worked as advertised when first tried.  Wonderful warmth in frigid temperatures.  The first time my hands--I have Renaud's Syndrome--felt comfortable for an extended time in cold weather.  However, the third time I tried the gloves, the switch on the left glove failed.  I have filed a claim with the manufacturer.  We will see how they respond."
3.0,I have three other Lauren jogging suits.  This suit fits the poorest of the group.  The left sleeve is so large at the cuff that it looks terrible.  I think this is headed to the Goodwill store.
3.0,Nice fabric pocket only one pocket and it’s really big
3.0,I ordered the Large because reviews I read said it ran smaller than the size. The sleeves are shorter then they should be for the size I ordered.
3.0,"I like the concept of this product, but we had a difficult time keeping these on my child's hands. Maybe it wasn't a fault with the gloves. It could have been her attire as she was dressed in many layers the only time she tried wearing these. That being said, I think they would have kept her hands warm and dry if they would have stayed on."
3.0,"This looks like it would have been an acceptable belt.  Be careful when placing the order, make sure it will be long enough."
3.0,"I thought he stone was auquamarine, but it turned out to be a dark blue, similar to a topaz."
3.0,They look fine but the diameter of the back is too small and they don't hold the shirt closed very well.
3.0,"Size is completely off. Luckily it's stretchy enough to get on, but after much dancing around, and is still very tight/form fitting. I have bought these before in XL, and they fit perfectly then, and now they're small enough that I would put them at a Medium. Luckily I like my leggings loose so I was still able to get them on. I think after a few rounds of wearing they might be more comfortable but still. I would definitely recommend going at least 1 size up, if not 2."
3.0,"I like this pair. It was a little crooked when I got it, but it is expected given what I paid for them. I prefer the price because I'm not good at keeping and taking care of expensive sunglasses. Overall, a nice soft look it gives me, I still have them,  and I would buy another pair."
3.0,"The slippers are adorable, but are not PINK as listed when I ordered.  They are white (VERY BAD FOR A TODDLER!) with pink inside. Frustrating because they are already dirty after two days of wearing only in the house.  But when she crawls around on the floor and walks around in white slippers all day, it's not surprising.  I would have returned them but they were to be from &#34;Santa&#34; and did not have time prior to Christmas.  I definitely would not have ordered had I known they were white on the outside.  I would have rated them as 5 star slippers if they were pink as listed."
3.0,"The tassels are attached in a “cheap” way— instead of being individually attached by the metal grommet, they’re sewn on in a straight line. I ended up not wearing this because I thought it looked tacky. The dress itself was soft and cute. Liked the fit of the dress!"
3.0,Scarf is ok but not what I wanted or was expecting. It is very thin and not very long. Wish it was longer and thicker to make it look better on neck. Looks more like a necklace than a cold weather scarf. Good quality and color though and would recommend for a scarf for the spring or fall.
3.0,I used these only a few times.  The plastic shield sits against your skin and face and creates sweat and got uncomfortable.  I will still use these for kids and people who are hard of hearing.
3.0,Smaller than hoped
3.0,"I love the vest it heats up very nice battery last about 6-8 hrs, but now I've had 3 vest and 2 of the battery pack the part you plug into the vest broke and I've tried getting ahold of the seller to see about replacing t h e battery but you can't get ahold of them and can't find the right replacement battery."
3.0,"Looks like the picture, however the clasp wouldn't open. Sucks my liked it, but had to return."
3.0,"These are nice & long, but the material is rather itchy to me.  I have sensitive skin, so that might be it.  I couldn't find anywhere what these are made of, but it's not cotton, and likely not real wool.  I think it's acrylic or something.  I can't tell."
3.0,"Looks nicer in the pictures. Chains keep getting tangled and they don't lay the same like in the model picture. But, still wearable."
3.0,"the shade of green was 50% of what is advertised, 7mm nice and large though"
3.0,RUNS SMALL I ORDERED AN XL AND I AM A SIZE 8 AND IT IS TO SMALL.  HAD TO GIVE IT TO MY DAUGHTER WHO IS A SIZE 6
3.0,":-( They are beautiful, and just what I wanted, EXCEPT: the loop is too thick to go far enough into my piercing to stay in my ear."
3.0,They’re cute but feel very flimsy and cheap. I only need them for a costume (one night) or else I’d be returning them.
3.0,"DONT expect this to warm you up during a cold day because it won’t. It’s thin, 100% polyester or some sort of other material. No cotton at all. :("
3.0,"They are cute and my daughter likes them, but the flower fell off after the second time wearing them. My daughter was even being careful, trying not to get them dirty. Disappointing."
3.0,Not comfortable with my feet. Not necessarily the fault of the sandal
3.0,This pin is very pretty but I was again surprised at how small it was compared to the other Lion pins I have purchased on Amazon.
3.0,"The one I received is a bit more yellow in color than pictured. Almost like brass but not quite. Not sure if they are all like that, but mine was."
3.0,Its too big for me i would need a large size instead of extra large
3.0,I truly love the dress but you have to be very curvy in the right places for this dress to work
3.0,"I recently bought this cover-up to take with me to Hawaii, it fits but is a little snug for a cover-up, so I would order a size up if you don't want your cover-up to fit snug."
3.0,"I really do like this set, it is very pretty but unfortunately the zipper on the bigger purse came unzipped from the middle on coming out of the box, about 70 miles drive to nearest ups to return it so i'm pretty much stuck with a broken product"
3.0,"Nice quality, too small (tight band that doesn’t stretch)"
3.0,these are cheaply made and can break easily but cant find the graduated darkening type any place else<br />For 10 bucks I just reorder
3.0,"Run small, order one size bigger"
3.0,"It’s a decent product for the money. Not great, not awful. You get what you pay for."
3.0,bought this for my husband and it did not fit him. The ear pieces were too short and the rest of it barely covered his nose and mouth and then kept riding up.
3.0,Love the robe but somewhat short.  Even after reading the models hi I am also five 8 1/2 I think it's a little short otherwise I love it
3.0,"The material is very stretch and thin, but not see through. The dress has a “v” front and adjustable straps. A small fit me from the waist down but was too roomy for me from the waist up so sadly I am returning it."
3.0,Order up 1-2 sizes
3.0,I ordered the white cap and gown with a 2020 tassel but the tassel did not come in the box
3.0,Design looks good on shirt but the shirt runs a lot smaller than expected.
3.0,It is more cloth than polyester or fleece don't waste money on it if you are looking for a true dri fit hood would've saved me time. Only kept it because I needed another sweater and didn't feel like waiting on another one. Also it stains very easy and is super difficult to remove stains
3.0,"I should've maybe sized down, but although I like the way this fit on the body, the arms were a little bit big and long. I tweaked it by ruching the side of the arms and now it's looks like it fits me perfectly. It is a cute color and just the right length."
3.0,"These are REALLY Short!!! Like they come up to mid calf. I love the soft inside lining and the color/style of them, but am wondering if they come in a long or if I should exchange them for a size up? They are also a little tight in the upper leg area. I've contacted the seller and am waiting on a response. Hopefully this will be corrected soon. Otherwise, I will have to save them for winter and wear them with boots only. I was hoping to sport them this summer though :("
3.0,"Just remember to take them off when you wash, particularly if you bleach your shirts or they'll start to oxidize and stain the material."
3.0,Not too bad Outfit eventhough you can see through it.just need to wear something underneath.
3.0,"Although the appearance of the tote is nice, the strap arrangement is clumsier than expected due to the stiffness of the handles, and the zipper end is not anchored, making the opening and closing difficult.  I'd rate this item strictly satisfactory, not to be bought again."
3.0,Size great ... logo very offset
3.0,Uhhhh..<br /><br />It's a cool concept but kinda odd that I have to come back to the Amazon listing and watch a video to learn how to wear/put it on.<br /><br />I would've loved a little booklet of sorts to show all the different ways you can utilize and change it around to wear it in different ways.<br /><br />The actual print /color is really pretty and the fabric is great for a beach wrap or bikini cover.<br /><br /> I love the rainbow ombre and once I watched the video found it really versatile and great to have so many options in one piece of clothing.
3.0,"The look of the glasses is really nice. They look expensive and the tortoise/gold is beautiful. But, they looked comically big on my face, at about 5.75"" wide (and I tend to like larger sunglasses). Also, they were not comfortable since the molded/integrated nose pieces dug into my nose weird. I've never had that problem with other sunglasses, either with or without nose pads."
3.0,I like the black and I kept it. Returned the two other colors I got and a second black one I got bc the coloring seemed off where they were all wrinkled in the packaging.<br /><br />Great if you’re nursing.
3.0,"Barely polarized, arrived bent but sit fine on my head. Wish they had an actual polarization"
3.0,Very stiff material. Doesnt lay nicely.
3.0,Good quality solid stainless steel material but only fair workmanship because the edges of the links are sharp and should have been beveled to assure a smooth touch against the skin. Other than that the price is unbeatable.
3.0,I like to were it with my  Sweater.
3.0,Not a good fit but ok not bad
3.0,I had to return! It was too small. My baby is average size in weight and is a little on the taller side. But this outfit is too small that it fitted short on my 3 month old. It also is button up widely between the legs making it snap open on every movement. If you want to purchase you need to size up!<br /><br />Edit:<br />I was so focused on the negative aspects I forgot to list the pros!<br />I have to say it’s very cozy and the material is great! Extra warm for the winter days and it’s very thick so your little one will for sure be nice and cozy!
3.0,"I bought these to replace a similar product which became scratched. They are lightweight and comfortable, but the invasive bar where the temple pieces attach to the lens is distracting and unnecessary. It's in your field of view all the time. It would be easy to create a different mounting scheme, which most other glasses use, which didn't impact the viewing area.<br />Update. Lens scratched easily even though they never left the office. Throwing them out."
3.0,The quality of the bag for the first 2 weeks was excellent. But later on the handles from the bag would put marking into the bag. And some of the string on the straps are starting to peel.
3.0,They are cute but they don't stay in the shoes
3.0,"Nothing to do with me, so returned!"
3.0,"Just a basic skirt, nice length, but not the best quality fabric."
3.0,This description said it would fit 44DDD...in reality it fir 40B. I even sized up but it did not come close to being the right size so I gifted it to a frirnd
3.0,It’s okay. The pockets are set way too far back though.
3.0,"My wife had these on her Amazon Wish List so I ordered them.  She likes them but says her heels slips off the back and she doesn't like that.  Otherwise, she says they are comfortable."
3.0,"It looks a little cheap, especially the head part, and it doesn't allow for adjusting on different size wrists.  It was a Christmas present and I kinda wish I had gotten something else."
3.0,"This sweater is really nice but after one washing the sleeve became unraveled!  It should be a quick fix, but a disappointment none the less!!!"
3.0,Beautiful but it fell apart first week
3.0,Really cute but kind of scratchy material and needed about 3 sizes bigger to be comfortable to actually sleep in.
3.0,Nice shirt but I received the wrong size. Very disappointed as the shirt is nice but I cannot wear it
3.0,"I really loved this hat, but the pom pom fell off after being worn four times. The fit was a bit large, but I kept the hat anyways, because it was definitely warm enough, and I liked how it looked. After the pom pom fell off, the hat unravelled."
3.0,I like them a lot... Comfortable and so cute!!
3.0,They just look cheap on the sides
3.0,"I really enjoyed the item, however, it has been a week and my strap broke off and the stitching, which holds the inner pocket to the purse, is swiftly unraveling. Pretty adorbs doe."
3.0,Gave to my grand daughter
3.0,"Strap was freyed I just returned and re ordered jic it was just a defective, the fabric is dreamy, hopefully the new one will work!! Size up."
3.0,Very thin fabric.  Don’t expect to hold up.
3.0,"They may be cute, but they fall down and rip pretty quickly"
3.0,"Cute style but doesn't wash well, stripes bled slightly"
3.0,The swimsuit itself is very pretty but I gave it 3 stars because it didn't fit my thighs
3.0,It wont say on keep sliding off
3.0,"They look nice and everything, the only trouble I had was how hard is was to open, I understand it was made to not fall off your ear, but man that strained my fingers."
3.0,Love but the clasp comes undone easily. I am scared I might accidentally loose my fit bit! Nice other than that!
3.0,Metal turned black so I don’t wear them anymore. Didn’t stay silver looking and shiny for long.
3.0,Ended up fitting small. I even measured myself to get a good fit. Still didn't fit right.
3.0,"I really love the look and functionality of this bag.<br />I get so many compliments and comments on it, and it fits everything I need for a day without looking large or clunky.<br />The negative is that it falls apart.  I wish I would have gotten the insurance plan, because both the strap AND the handle broke well within what's offered in the &#34;insurance period&#34;."
3.0,"good quality fabric, but there is a lot of material on the dress that weighs down on the skinny spaghetti straps. I ordered a small but it seemed like a large because of all the material. kind of felt like a parachute. this dress is good if you like extra room. had to return because too big."
3.0,Too much extra material for the lady in my life.
3.0,"These are good, but not as good as adidas addisage which I love (but are 2x more expensive).  I feel the nubs in the forefoot more than the heel in these sandals.  And they do feel a bit more prickly than the adidas.  I liked feeling it in the heel in the adidas shoes, because I have plantar facititis, which is why I wear massaging sandals.<br /><br />I'm going to keep these and try them for a while and will update this review later on.  Maybe I'll get used to them and start liking them better.<br />I took some photos to compare the two.  (My adidas are very old and beat up.  My new pair got stolen at the beach, thus the need to make a new purchase)<br /><br />Fitwise, I ordered the &#34;M, Women's 8-9&#34;.  They are a tiny bit larger than the adidas Women's 10 that I normally wear.<br />The packaging has a better size guide than the listing, here it is:<br /><br />S/P: Women's 6-7<br />M/M: Women's 8-10<br />L/G: Men's 9-10<br />XL/XG: MEn's 11+<br /><br />Hope that helps"
3.0,"Thinner than I expected, I have a different one that is fluffier than this one."
3.0,"I’m 5’11” and I bought the xxl. Luckily I’m all leg bc the shirt is almost too short for me. Sleeves r not long enough for me to use the thumb holes. If ur looking for tight and stretchy, this isn’t it. It’s just tight and it kinda pinches where my arms bend."
3.0,It is like a dress a does not wash well.
3.0,Smaller than pictures but a good gift for ladies and children.
3.0,"I liked the top, but it didn't fit as pictured."
3.0,graphic design was too big and I could not adjust it onto my face
3.0,Muy largas y anchas
3.0,This is not a chambray dress.  It is a navy dress with a white print.
3.0,Pretty cheap plastic. The clip of the silver on came off on the third time wearing it
3.0,"Looks to be made of great material, unfortunately my son did not like the feel of it. Tried it for a day, was not okay for him possibly for others it might."
3.0,"VERY thin.  See-through even in black.  Fabric of neckline twisted so it looks a bit cheap.  Soft and comfortable, but already starting to pill and show wear."
3.0,"Elastic, detached at one end. It still works as a wraparound but there is no elastic ensuring a snug fit."
3.0,Ima very small person they were supposed to be adjustable but didn't fit only 2 fit
3.0,Too small than expected !
3.0,Very very thin a little small for the size I got. Colors not as vibrant as the pic indicates. But with an undershirt good long sleeve shirt- can call that a sweater.
3.0,Everything looks green - can't see the color of the buds.
3.0,Super cheap and doesn't protect against any bacteria. One should wear black medical mask under this rhinestone mask. Overall not bad for its price.
3.0,"I ordered this top a size up like I have my other tops from PattyBoutik.  This one is just a little too large when ordered a size larger than what I typically wear. And it is very long. The top is nice over all, but these are just things to be aware of. In addition to this the design on the front of the shirt started coming off after just one wash and I am very careful about how I wash my Patty tops. I also lay flat to dry. Again, top is pretty and good quality material just much longer than I expected and larger as well.<br /><br />This will not stop me from ordering more PattyBoutik tops. I do love them. It is just this one may need to be ordered in your normal size."
3.0,"The pattern was nice, the material was very thin.  I expected a dress with a halloween pattern.  The actual material is costume quality not clothing quality.  It is great for a costume but not a quality that would suit day to day wear."
3.0,"I loved these glasses. They’re super cute and stylish, however, one of my lens popped out on the bottom and it won’t pop in. It’s as if it wasn’t even meant to fit it. The glasses are cheaply made but they are cute nonetheless."
3.0,"Its wht you would expect from a $12 dollar hat. It took a month for delivery and it had creases when I opened it. Overall not a bad hat, but you wont be getting a New Era, or Mitchel&Ness Quality."
3.0,"Even though I ordered the small, and my wrists are not &#34;dainty&#34; by any stretch of the imagination, it is still a bit large on me. The connector to the actual device occasionally will come loose so that the band comes off my wrist. I do like the daisy pattern on it."
3.0,"The ear cuff itself is a little uncomfortable initially, but once positioned it is great. Cool buy. Great for cosplay"
3.0,I give these 3 stars because they are pretty.  I have a size 8 foot and these are big on me.  I will have to end up tying them in some way behind my ankle for them to fit properly.  Kinda bummed.
3.0,"I ordered S/M because i wanted a snug fit to hold my tummy down. Happy with this product and size as well. After getting it pass my hips it was smooth sailing afterwards. Panty lines are a bit thick though, great product otherwise. My weight is 145 lbs"
3.0,Very cute and fit true to size (sleeves a little short as I have long arms) but the material isn't top quality and started pilling after wearing a day at work (and I sit at a desk).
3.0,"It's OK , it's more boxy looking than it looks in the picture. It isn't slimming as stated in the description !"
3.0,I am size 8 and ordered the size by looking at the chart but it fit too small
3.0,It had strings hanging off that would have needed to be trimmed and the fit was too large.  The colors were pretty.
3.0,"The shirt was thin, and when it was washed a couple times, the material began to pill (lint balls). Size down from your normal size if you want it more form fitting."
3.0,"I liked this top, but it was way too big. I ended up giving it to a friend and it looks great on her!"
3.0,"Quality is good, design is just as pictured. I do think it’s way to baggy though. I don’t think I’ll wear it as often as I had hope because it’s so large and flowy. I would order down a size."
3.0,I wanted this dress to fit so bad but unfortunately it didn't.  The colors and patterns are beautiful but it's too tight and shorter than what I expected
3.0,They were too larger so he didn't use them but twice. Went back to pullups
3.0,"Really loved this dress, beautiful fit, short but nicely tailored. However today was my second or third wear and there's a tear in the seam on the arm. I'm sure I can mend it but it's unfortunate for it to be wearing out so soon."
3.0,The MK watch looks good but the box came damaged.
3.0,anti fogging only lasted for 3-4 swims
3.0,"They are nice, I had to return them because they did not fit correctly. Also very thin in material hence the three stars."
3.0,They are easy for my three year old to get on.
3.0,My main issue or complaint is after wearing these for a few times the paint or coating starts to flake and peel off.<br />Now the addage you get what you pay for comes to mind because they were really inexpensive.<br />With all of this being said even tho they arrived befo4e eatimated time and they were easy to put in and wore comfortable I do not think I will buy any more of these.
3.0,The pattern is as pretty as it looks in the pictures . The only thing I didn’t like is that the material is not bendable . It has a really hard lining underneath that makes the material not mild that well to the body . Looks stiff
3.0,"This was a good concept, and I really wanted to like this watch band, but the magnet has been more trouble than it's worth. If your not careful when you out your watch down the magnet creeps its way up to the watch casing and stops the movement. I have to make a concious effort to avoid getting my arm too close to metal objects or else the magnet sticks to the other object and the watch falls off. Being a maintenance engineer this is a big problem for me."
3.0,"Beanie was awesome, unfortunately I received a bad one because like 2 days later it started coming apart on top and it was just a tube lol."
3.0,The light needs to be brighter
3.0,Poorly constructed. Was very disappointed
3.0,It's super cute. My daughter(5) got it for her birthday and she loves it. It came with everything listed on the post. It just seems kind of cheaply made. Not a huge deal for us because it's just for kindergarten but I don't think using it for a child who carries a lot of stuff would be wise
3.0,They need a size in between the last two sizes
3.0,The run smaller than I expected.  They are just okay.
3.0,It is beautiful just to small but still gonna wear it!
3.0,it looks just like the picture  but the pleats are not as deep as the picture you have to know how to iron (which I dont)🤷🏾‍♀️I guess to get the look
3.0,The product itself was amazing the look the feel of the jacket was better than I had anticipated. However the sizing for these jackets is way off. I purchased a 4XL hoodie jacket and it's the exact same size as the extra large jackets I have. So even though this is a great product it looks good it feels good be careful when picking your sizes you may have to pick literally two sizes maybe even three size above what you normally wear in order to accommodate this
3.0,Cute but they're too tight and always slip off my head. I constantly have to readjust them when I wear them. Or I have to wear them further up on my head/forehead than I want to to keep them from slipping.
3.0,I have extremely skinny arms and these fit way too tight so not able to wear them
3.0,To long. Would have to cover my whole face to see design.
3.0,I had to return them because they did not fit.  It's possible that my feet are swollen due to pregnancy.
3.0,"I really liked the style of the dress, but even a size xl was too small for me and I wear a 14 and xl in other clothing.  Sadly I had to retun it. I don't think the xxl would have fit properly."
3.0,"Good quality. I ordered 2 for both myself and my boyfriend and it fit very well on both of us. I’ve washed already several times and it has held up just fine (use a delicates laundry bag) and the adjustable ear loops are great. Only downside is this mask is not ideal for those who wear glasses. It is also really annoying to wear if you’re doing anything that requires heavier breathing (ie. walking uphill, running, etc) as the inner fabric sucks to your face every time that you breathe in.."
3.0,I had to go to babiator's website to find that the heart shaped glasses size differently than the other styles. I didn't find out about it until after I received the glasses in the mail. I'll have to return them for a bigger size. Other than that they were pulled by my almost 2yo and seemed to stay put.
3.0,Nice summer dress but runs small
3.0,I didn't like the material but it's okay
3.0,Clasp broke
3.0,"These sunglasses appear to be good quality, though the lenses seem more square than they appear in the photo. My problem comes with the darkness or tint of the sunglasses... they are not that helpful in bright sunlight. Inside the car, or sitting in the shade in a sunny area they are great... but at noon, with the sun beating down, they just aren't as dark as many other pairs I own. The tortoiseshell and blue metallic finish combo is hard to find, so I am going to wear them anyways, but for beach days I will switch to another pair."
3.0,"Fits well, lightweight, and looks good. I’m not sure what’s wrong with the pants though, they are cut strange so you end up looking severely bow-legged. If it weren’t for that, I would buy another one. It really kind of bothers me, especially for the price. That’s why it gets 3 stars."
3.0,"Beautiful and nicely package. After I sprinkled holy water and wear it, I felt good spiritual feeling."
3.0,Ordered adult and received child.  Still worked out because he is small but you could tell them t didn’t fit.  Didn’t have time to reorder- needed them two days after received.
3.0,The t-shirt is okay.  I expected it to be wrinkle free but it’s simply t shirt material.  I had hoped for a crisper look.  The colors were just what I wanted so I will keep it but I’m not impressed.
3.0,It came today I just came home and opened it it's broke missimg etc it looks nothing like pic
3.0,I like the top. It's smaller than I thought but I am losing weight and it will fit in a few weeks. I am keeping it!
3.0,alot larger than i expected
3.0,They are loose around the calf and ankle.
3.0,"Did n it fit my face.  Love the quality, just did not fit"
3.0,"Took a long time to get here. But I wear it all the time, looks like a very slick, quality product. The leather hasn't faded yet, although it doesn't seem like strongest of leather.<br /><br />Update: Wore down very fast, but was to be expected for the price."
3.0,falls off my face. The venom mask is a bit cheesy
3.0,These are exactly as they state. Great condition however they are extremely small and will slip right through the ear. I would recommend buying larger earrings
3.0,"Not for tall people, arm length is short. Bought one size up"
3.0,"It wasn't really what I expected, but I will wear it occasionally"
3.0,"Great glasses.  Keeps the hot florida shiny sun at bay.<br />When my wife told me the glasses make me look hot,<br />she couldn't see me blushing because of the great coverage.<br /><br />HOWEVER the frames of one pair cracked and separated over the right<br />eye. Not Happy, I hope LINVO will replace that pair."
3.0,Not quite what I expected but will do
3.0,Too small at the bottom but too wide on the shoulder
3.0,The shirt arrived in a nice pouch. Surprised at the material and quality. Then....I turn the shirt around the find a long line on pink!  Pink on a white shirt. It was along one of the pleats on the back of the shirt. Whether it was stained or from material idk. Returning.  This is the reason for the 3 stars. May or may not reordered.
3.0,Reloj elegante
3.0,I liked it but it was too small even though it should have been my right size and didn't want to order again.
3.0,It would be very cute if it fit. Runs small and not flattering for large chested women.
3.0,I love the concept but was made poorly and the hat doesn't sit right because the main stitch seam is down the front
3.0,Very pretty. But way too big for me to make earrings with.
3.0,"The WearMe Pro sunglasses are a nice set of sunglasses.<br /><br />The sunglasses come in a microfiber pouch that is suppose to help protect the sunglasses. The pouch can help protect the sunglasses from getting scratched, but it's the pouch is not sturdy or strong enough to protect the glasses if they were dropped, sat on, etc. A harder case would be better to fully protect the sunglasses, but this still does well to protect the lenses from scratching.<br /><br />The metal of the frames are durable. The metal of the frames is well made. The frames are lightweight and comfortable to wear. The ear pieces fit the ears nicely. They don't irritate the ears. The ear pieces also fit comfortable. The only part of the frames that I have a problem with is the hinges. The hinges feel a bit weak. I fear that the hinges might break if they were accidentally bent the wrong way.<br /><br /> WearMe Pro has several choices of colored lens to choose from. I went with the more rainbowed (blue, green, and purple/pink) lenses.<br /><br />The lenses are mirrored or reflecting. The lenses work well to help protect the eyes from the sun and UV rays. The lenses are clear and easy to see through. The color when looking through the lenses is a nice blue-green. It helps reduce the amount of brightness, since the sunglasses are polarized and will darken in brighter lights. The color and lenses help keep the eyes from getting strained.<br /><br />I'm not a big gold fan. If only there was a option to get these sunglasses in a silver frame rather than gold, I'd enjoy these sunglasses much more. Although, that is a personal opinion and doesn't affect the actual quality or performance of the sunglasses.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Nice color for lenses<br />- Polarized lenses<br />- Lightweight<br />- Comfortable<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Hinges feel a little weak<br />- Wish it'd also come in silver (frames)<br /><br />I received this product through a promotion in exchange for a honest and unbiased review."
3.0,"I ordered the small (36"" bust/32D and 26""waist). The dress fit fine, but I didn't like how it looked. I have larger shoulders and the dress exaggerated my shoulders, and simultaneously hid my bust and made it look overly large? The rouching in the bust area was just weird and unflattering. Everything over the waist just did not look good on my body. But the skirt portion was very cute. I think if you are a slimmer person with thinner arms and shoulders, more similar to the model, this dress will look lovely on you"
3.0,Great idea. But one guy seriously asked me if it was some kind of cult jewelry(although not in those exact words).  Not a good look for a guy.  Innovative but I only used it a few times.
3.0,"This dress is really pretty, I love the material. But it’s definitely not true to size. It fits perfectly in the chest for larger breast but the waist is really small where the one layer of stitching was way to tight. Wish it fit love the style of the dress."
3.0,Very cute bag but way smaller than I expected.  I ended up giving it to my 2 year old great niece.
3.0,Love the glasses but rhinestones coming loose from rim I should be able to glue back on
3.0,"Kind of short and tighter then I wanted. The chest area was also cut strange, maybe my chest was just to big for it."
3.0,"Both earrings were the same, not as listed or in the photo."
3.0,was a bit too tight for my style.
3.0,It's TINY. The pictures are very misleading. I was expecting the charm to be 3 times larger. I gave it 3 stars because it's nice and shiny.
3.0,The tunic ran very small. The quality of the material is thin. The dress is very see through.
3.0,"Too small. Too thin. Too short. I got the XL size and couldn't believe how small they were! They were super thin which is ok, but they were so shot the only covered half the shin. Maybe they're a kid's XL?? Nope, I just checked. WOMEN'S XL! If you're a small person, get the XLs and they should fit perfectly. Otherwise find another option."
3.0,"I grew up with magic mittens and gloves and still wear them sometimes as an adult. I bought these for my two kids and I was very disappointed in the quality which is okay at best. Again, I have owned many pairs of these type of gloves and mittens but these are very subpar. Many strings hanging off the ends, the wrist band is uneven and if you flip them inside out there are many loose strings as well as lumps of different colored thread on the wrist band. They serve their purpose but very, very cheaply made. Would not recommend and will look for a different brand in the future."
3.0,"As a teacher, I ordered this shirt to wear to my schools literacy day- we were supposed to dress up as our favorite children's book.  When it arrived, it was not sized like a normal women's/ladies shirt.  I wear a medium, and had ordered a large to give myself plenty of room.  The shirt would not fit.  I literally could not get it over my head/shoulders.  It was sized more like a child's large than an adults.  When I contacted the seller to notify them they had sent me a children's shirt by mistake, they emailed me back stating that it was in fact a ladies shirt, but they ran very small.  I feel that was information that really needed to be stated on the sales page.  The only adult lady/woman that this shirt would fit would be one the height/build of a ten year old.<br /><br />I am giving the item 3 stars because it is a cute shirt- for my ten year old niece."
3.0,It was good a little tighter than I thought
3.0,Wasn't that impressed.
3.0,"I had an orange version of this shirt (large) so I knew what to expect. However, even though the plastic wrap had an L label on it the shirt itself was a medium. It did fit my son so I (we) decided to keep it. Lucky him! He now has a very nice five star shirt. No stars for me, though."
3.0,It is what it is but the clip should not have sharp teeth. It could damage delicate jewelry.
3.0,"I got these in size 11 for my mom. She said they fit well and are comfortable. However, the major drawback was the stretchy back strap that would rub into her skin and leave it irritated. So, she's unable to wear them."
3.0,"The shirt seems fine, but it is too large.<br /><br />The description for this item was<br />&#34;ZITY Cycling Shirt Men's Workout Polo Shirt Short Sleeve Navy US M/Label XL&#34;<br />so, I read that as US Medium and did not regard what the &#34;Label XL&#34; meant.<br /><br />I ordered four similar style 'golf' shirts in Medium size from different vendors.  I'll see how the others are."
3.0,"They aren’t as snug as I’d like, very wide"
3.0,"Magnitized closed, so not something you can wear around your children if you have them. A beautiful necklace though it doesn't look exactly as the picture. The moss inside of the charm is different in mine. Worth the money"
3.0,The strap pops open from time to time
3.0,I really liked this sweater but it fit too small. I was hoping for a longer sweater.
3.0,They weren't exactly what i wanted but made of good quality and nice for the price.
3.0,"Quality of product was not ideal, the hat was too small and didn't fit."
3.0,they are a little big but def really cute
3.0,I was hoping it would be close to the image shown as far as how it fits your face. On as a face shield one can’t see what the image is suppose to be.<br />Otherwise it’s nice and soft which I am quite a fan of.
3.0,One of these (the lightening bolt) is too thick to fit into my earring hole. And one has the dimond way to far down so it doesn’t latch at the top of the ear like it’s make for someone who has giant ears. Would not recommend these for someone with particularly small ears but they are cute!
3.0,Beautiful bracelet but the stones fell out of it before I could give it as a present.  The seller was great about giving me a refund even though I told them I didn't need one because I hot glued the stones back in and hopefully they will hold because this is a nice bracelet for the price.  Seller was geat!
3.0,Cute dress. Fit as expected. The colors are just off. Background is peach. Flowers are more orangey and the blue is more of  a bright teal color.
3.0,The fabric isn’t the greatest and it runs small.
3.0,"These are super cute, yes ... however majority of them are hard to open up and you will have to thread the chain through the opening therefore if you want easy access to change out felt or jewel of choice you will have to take off the chain and like I said several of these are very hard to open up. I still like them and will find a very good use for them however not really what I would recommend for any essential oil diffuser project."
3.0,They hold on well but are clunky. Not very flexible
3.0,I forgot that I have a big head.
3.0,"The dress is ok. There is a lot of weird bunching and extra fabric that doesn't really belong that causes odd bulges in the dress when worn... And the slits are an awkward length on me; I'm 5'7&#34; and they are too short to really give the dress the &#34;flowy, peekaboo&#34; look I bought it for. But the fabric is a nice weight and the stitching seems to be well done."
3.0,"I didn't do my due diligence to find out these are only sublimated on the top. They are inexpensive, sure, but they also look a bit 'cheap' with the bottoms still white. In retrospect, I'd look for socks that were sublimated on both sides."
3.0,"my first pair of these pants shrunk in the wash and even after being very careful, my second pair shrunk in the wash too. by inches. otherwise they are soft and comfortable, if you don’t mind having flared capris"
3.0,I gave it only 3 stars because the sole was harder than I expected & the arch support bothered my foot. May be perfect for someone else.
3.0,"Love the sculpt, turned my finger green. :("
3.0,"I like the coat, if I had known it was coming from China,I would not have ordered it. Bought one before,not like this,it was a size 3x, couldn't get both arms into it,I wear a large,lost $50.00, they make them for people in china,not american women"
3.0,"Unless you have the perfect body, it'll show every peice of fat that you have."
3.0,"I love the color on this jacket! It says rose red but it's actually like a neon pink (has a slight touch of orange). Sadly, I've bought this jacket twice and will have to return. It's huge!! The whole jacket is very long. I'm short (4'11"") but this jacket is longer than others I've purchased. Initially, I ordered a L and they shipped an XL in L packaging. The 2nd time they sent the right size, but it's still big. I'm not sure if I want to reorder it again because the material is thin compared to some other jackets I've ordered."
3.0,La tela no es suave
3.0,Its is just the same as the one that came with the boots
3.0,"Really loved the distressed look of the grey sweatshirt in the photo.  Sadly, in person it's a standard grey. Not distressed whatsoever.  The cut on it is also weird.  Incredibly tight around the chest - I got a medium and I'm a B-cup so I had to return it."
3.0,Very cheap design and pins fall out when in my ear.
3.0,You get what you pay for. Quality is lacking but it looks good. Probably won't get a substantial number of wears out of it.
3.0,Had a problem with the string staying attached to the leather after less than a month.  Otherwise I like the bracelet
3.0,"I like these, but the color of the middle piece is not turquoise/aqua colored at all, as advertised. The shipped and arrived quickly, but I was disappointed the color is off."
3.0,I do like it but the zipper broke the 2 day and I was disappointed.
3.0,"I am a 14...ordered a 16....was too large at the bottom and too small at the top.  :(  I am busty (36F, 41&#34;) but I had hoped it would come closer to fitting in the bust area.  I had to return it."
3.0,"Eyes are too small to see out of. Other than that, nice mask!"
3.0,A little small to the fit
3.0,Some are not real nose piercings?
3.0,Crop top is an understatement
3.0,"We bought this for our daughter who is obsessed with stars. We gave it two her about  a week before Christmas and while it's pretty and out daughter loves it, I'm very disappointed that last week one of the lights already burned out. The instructions are very vague and I'm still looking into if I can replace the led."
3.0,I liked these masks but the straps are not sturdy and broke easily.
3.0,Pants are longer that expected and are too short in crotch.
3.0,Have had a few weeks and already have holes in some. Expected better
3.0,"The socks are super nice; however, two pairs had holes in them after removing the plastic tag (with scissors). Very disappointed, especially since I gave them as a Christmas gift."
3.0,These were too stiff for me in the toe area.  I have a wide foot and this shoe style just didn't seem to work for me.
3.0,"This is a beautifully made quality boot with one major flaw.<br /><br />It seemed the makers of these shoes put a lot of thought into these shoes not sure why they overlooked the fact that these boots are way too narrow for their targeted audience.<br /><br />Babies have fat feet.Some have very chubby feet. For that reason most baby shoe manufacturers err on the side of making a wider shoe to fit most of those chubby feet.  This manufacturer essentially shrank an adult shoe and put in a soft sole.<br /><br />My daughter is currently a size 6.5 and i bought these in a size 7. While the boots are a tad too long, they fit her almost like socks In every other way including the shaft.<br /><br />From what my pedi advises baby feet need relative freedom to grow( she's an advocate of letting babies go barefoot as often as possible) so this shoe is breaking that rule. Because its leather and a soft one at that im hoping it will loosen up with wear... But by the time that happens she may be in another size.<br /><br />These arent issues that should be present in a baby/toddler shoe. Most parents wont be bothered to stretch a kids shoe and they shouldnt be.<br /><br />Hopefully they revisit this as these are very cute well made shoes but its all for naught if they will prove uncomfortable or detrimental to the wearer.<br />Luckily i bought them very heavily discounted or they would have been a return for sure."
3.0,Purchased the product because my wife really liked the Vera Bradley pattern.  The strap was purchased specifically for her sunglasses and does not work.
3.0,They are what is shown.  Small-ish but still an OK size.  Color is good and the tag's sturdiness is OK given the cost.  The two take-ways are:  1. There is no plastic cover or protection for the card with the lettering.  Not necessarily an issue but it is a heads up if it might see moister.  2. The plastic attachment tie is solid and strong BUT the loop is completed by going through a friction frame and is secured by two little plastic pins to hold it there.  Not a sure thing to last through what a suitcase or a child's backpack will endure during use.  They are fine for light use or they need a nylon tie down to supplement .
3.0,I found this to be uncomfortable.  My hair catches in between the pearls and the crystal.
3.0,"this fabric is very thin, like a nightgown. the buttons on the shoulders probably mean itwon't be good to sleep in  - so i guess it's for layering. mediocre quality."
3.0,"I have bought many of these before covid nonsense and the material was quiet and soft and durable. Now the bags are horrible noisy and stiffer, I am hoping this will go away over time and washing them , so far it has not .Sigh... another nice product changed due to the pandemic ......ugh"
3.0,"These were a bit higher waisted than I would have liked, and a bit baggier in general. Might have been alright if I'd sized down but I didn't love how thin & delicate they felt (probably not very durable) or the extent to which they attracted kitty fluff & detritus (best as a lint roller rather than a pair of pants). I would have liked the waistband to be a little tighter, too, personally, though maybe a snaller size would have accommodated this."
3.0,"I like the colors and pattern of a faded and rustic old glory. The elastic band around the top holds well. I ordered the size that was best for me, but dang they squeeze my arms so much so that’s it’s really uncomfortable. I suggest sizing up."
3.0,"This belt is too long to be described as a Medium.  It would fit a 38 waist, at least,  I reordered a small.  I have a 32-34 waist and a small fits very good.  The problem with a belt that's too long is that a pants belt loop has to be used to take up the access and the belt is too thick to have to double up on a pant loop for that purpose."
3.0,These are really cute- but really see through :/ but they're nice for around the house.
3.0,they're warm but the smart touch doesn't work
3.0,"The glasses are fine, but the reason for the 3 stars is that I only received 2 pair.  The buyer explained was that the third pair was sold out. I bought them as a set, how could that be correct?"
3.0,I bought this over a year ago and a couple wears in the button that keeps the strap in kept falling off. Now I have to safety pin it to keep it in place. Fits a little big as well and has a very square shape to it.
3.0,"very comfortable to wear. do not press against eyeballs like others i've tried.only negative is that they tend to slip when i move my head allowing a small amount of light leakage around the nose. this has been true of all others i've tried though and it's not difficult to readjust them so no light gets by<br /><br />Addendum: after 4 months of usage the material surrounding the foam began to peel.  Very disappointed as they fit well, but it's too expensive for me to replace them that frequently"
3.0,Two of the bag in the set couldn’t hold the weight
3.0,It's a little hard to see though it but its cool.. when ur breathing it fogs up.  So even harder to play around with..
3.0,Not shoes<br />Survey does not apply
3.0,"The color, fit & style is perfect, but it was heavy & material itchy."
3.0,It's ok. Headband is just a piece of camo fabric you tie yourself.
3.0,"Very cute, BUT runs very SMALL! Bought this for my daughter who is an adult size 6. They only had size large and bigger in stock, so I took a chance with a large. I reasoned that we could safety pin the costume if it fit loose!  I can't imagine how teeny a small or medium would have been on her! Glad we ended up with the large size. This is cute but the fabric is the typical THIN costume fabric so it doesn't offer much in the way of coverage. Make sure you order a couple of sizes UP and have undergarments that offer plenty of coverage. Other than that, it was a fun costume!"
3.0,Oops - may have returned this a bit too soon........I thought there was a duo deal on this - one that included the bag and an umbrella.  Guess I need to slow down and read slower.  May have to reorder this ;)
3.0,The style and color of the dress.
3.0,"They are super soft and comfortable. However, they aren't warm, they are very thin."
3.0,My daughter like thank u
3.0,the lettering was not good quality
3.0,Decente calidad por el precio
3.0,"hi,<br />to be precise and short I want just say: they absolutely don't help at night ,especially in big city, like New York, but  you can wear them on cloudy days, during predawn and at sunset hours. they work OK as dress glasses.<br />thank you"
3.0,Vintage Inspired Classic Half Frame Horned Rim Wayfarer Sunglasses is good item
3.0,Metal trim very bright gold.
3.0,i loved the earrings they were just broken when i opened them
3.0,I love this ring.  It is very pretty and have had lots of compliments on it.  BUT everyone of the stones came of the band.  No I would not buy it again.....
3.0,"The packaging was great, I will using the little box it came it to store my nose rings from now on.  The rings themselves were rather small.  They just barely fit my nose, but this may be dependent on the size of my nose.  The metal is good quality."
3.0,"Meh, I beat this one up pretty quick and it stopped working shorting after. Not the most robust watch. Light like a feather though."
3.0,"I loved this outfit! the material was nice and soft and my son looked so cute in it, but he was only able to wear it twice because it fit him too snug. I  bought a size he would be able to grow into, but I should have bought 2 sizes larger because it was a small fit."
3.0,I really was disappointed in the feel of the material of this maxi dress.  Not as pretty or as vibrant as the picture.  Did not like the look or feel of the bodice of the dress.  It was a very stiff and cardboard like cotton material that did not flatter the chest area.  Very loose in the sleeves.
3.0,I’m happy with this dress.  Bought for s 4th of July event. It was a hit. Color not as vibrant but still fun. Plan cut. Not as tailored as picture.
3.0,"I'm not very impressed;  in the picture I see that it is worn on heels, but it is not a good quality of the fabric to be elegant"
3.0,These ran very small. I usually find XL just right or even a little big. These were tight and showed everything. I like the fabric though and will keep them for when I am smaller myself.
3.0,I’m 5’9” and have a hard time finding maxi dresses that are long enough.
3.0,"Bought for a gift, way to small for a guy. Max ladies size 8 shoe."
3.0,"For the price, yes it's great. BUT, and a big BUT, the closure was welded shut. Thankfully, I have jewelry repair/making supplies on hand and clipped off the bad closure and put on a new one. I wish I could have given it 2-1/2 stars for that very reason and not 3, so I rounded up. However, because the design is impressive and I received compliments on it and was able to use it, this is my honest review. If you order it, have a metal/wire clipper on hand and a lobster clasp closure on hand just in case because with the price being so low and reasonable, I don't really think it would be worth it to return it."
3.0,Had to submit a return. I’m typically an extra large but read that this dress runs large and so I ordered a size smaller and purchased a large. Well that was even wayyy to big. I’m considering ordering a medium or small... but the fabric was very comfy
3.0,Returned this item. Was not crazy about the material.
3.0,Very nice Spurs like the size the only reason why I gave it three stars the zipper broke the same day it was so hard to open
3.0,Soo cute looks great on and size was as expected. The only reason I'm giving a 3 star rating is the color is way off. It is definitely more orange than the picture
3.0,"I’m 5’2” tall and these were way too long and big for me. I usually wear a 3XL or 2XL, but lately some 3XL items I’ve purchased haven’t fit, so I bought a pair in 3XL & 4XL. Both were way too large and too long for me."
3.0,great looking but legs are too short. i can only wear these with tall boots or as capris. im not even that tall. im 5'5''
3.0,"I have 9 pairs of Ekouaer pajamas ranging from the chemise, shorts sets, capri sets etc. This is the first one I purchased that had a print and it is not the same fabric. I wish I had not washed them because I would return them. The are almost like a rougher polyester feel- and I will likely not wear them. My advice is to stay with the solid colors because those are wonderful"
3.0,"I had to order a larger size.  Liked the print and the material looked good. Since I sent it back, do no know how it washes."
3.0,"I'm a pretty slender girl but I'm a bit long-limbed at 5'7&#34;, so I got a US-M/Asia-L. The torso aspect of the shirt fits just great, not super tight, just the way I prefer it. The sleeves however, are SHORT. They barely cover my wrists (this is a huge pet peeve of mine when it comes to shirts)."
3.0,Not as tight as when initially bought and can't go down in size because I got a small. I'm 130ish pounds.
3.0,I did not like how it fits in the back.  It hangs low.  I have to trim it so it won't hang below my bottom.  The material it's ok.
3.0,it's a very nice shirt but just fits smaller than a usual small would in every other brand.  I'll probably have to hand dry it because if i dry it then it may shrink and i'm already pushing it as is
3.0,Chain was too short to fit around neck... Had to put it on the last latch... Almost couldn't even wear it... But very cute for any outfit
3.0,Product was good but arrived late.
3.0,"Beautiful dress but belt does not keep dress from falling open. No fasteners, snaps, buttons or anything other than the belt!! This dress just whoops opens right up. I'm having to pay extra for a snap and button to be added. Otherwise, great fabric, solidly and prettily made."
3.0,I don't have small nipples bit these weren't as cute as expected....a little longer and wider than expected
3.0,BRoke my ankle in Feb. wrecked both knees also.
3.0,Smaller than I thought cost a lot for it being so little
3.0,Broke after first two weeks. Barely hanging on to lanyard by two threads. But overall ok c+
3.0,"These capris are not to wear as pants. They are way too thin and see through...however, they are very comfortable and work well under a dress. They are very thin, so are nice to wear on a warm day. I thought they were more like yoga pants when I bought them, but they are not."
3.0,I am using this for my Fit Bit Charge 4.  I have small wrists  so unfortunately the bands don't fit as snugly as I would like.
3.0,"I liked the color and style, as well as the texture, however it was just too tight in the arms and was clingy everywhere else, buttoning it was out of the question.  It left nothing to the imagination as to wearing a blouse under it.  I thought I had read all of the guidance correctly, but just was not large enough to be comfortable."
3.0,You would think it would fit comfortably on both shoulders but it doesn't. But it doesn't the job. Needed it to be versatile cause I have a bad shoulder and it still makes me carry it on that shoulder for good support and less of a choking hazard. On the other shoulder it doesn't stay well and chokes me.
3.0,"They were made with cheap fabric, but they were worth the price. They’re not everyday sandals for a baby, maybe just for a one time event."
3.0,It is not real leather
3.0,Too small.<br />Looks good though. Exactly as pictured. Ordering. New size.
3.0,Ok product for price. Nothing special. Runs a little small.
3.0,"I had to order two pairs of these as the first pair was a little bit too small. The Sole of the flip flop is thick so you can stand and walk in them for alot longer than the flatter, barely no cushion kind of flip flops. The design is cute And vibrant but I wish the company’s logo wasnt Bright white on the strap. I dont like the contrast it makes surrounded by all the blue, its like its glowing lol and it would have been better if it was blue like the strap or atleast black since the logo is raised and not flat. I fixed that by coloring the logo with a blue sharpie, and it looks WAY better that way. All in all i like the flip flops. As a tall woman with big feet (even if they dont look big) i wish this company would expand their womens flip flops sizes because if your foot is a womens size 11, 11 1/2 or 12 and up then you just have to buy a pair from the mens but the colors are cuter in the womens flip flops and even men with big feet 12 1/2, 13 & up will probably find these too small so hopefully they expand soon. I took 1 star off my review because they need to expand sizing and another 1 star off for the bright white contrasting label on the strap."
3.0,"Very thin, especially the white one in the back. Thin fabric is doubled in front making it tolerable but must wear camy under it. Havent wore it yet, was expecting a cotton linen sort of frabric, not chiffon. The black is the same but more forgiving."
3.0,"This is a nice heavy-weight shirt, but I washed in cold water the first time and it faded.  The ruffled sleeves are cute."
3.0,"I ordered the kids size and received the adults.  As imagined, my 6 year old was pretty disappointed considering they were just too big to wear all day at school.  ☹️"
3.0,Super cute and petite for my 4 yr old granddaughter but still way too long.
3.0,The dress is okay. Looks cheap and is kinda see-through which is why I put 3 stars.
3.0,Dress could be a little longer but it's acceptable.
3.0,"It did not state in the description or show in the picture that these earrings are clip ons.  Despite that fact, they look alright and are a decent weight.  I still wear them out as they stay on fairly well for clip ons."
3.0,Even xl size was a little tight. Also don't get the dark color it is very warm. Brim larger than others I have bought.
3.0,Cute fashion bag. It's not a sturdy as it looks in the photo. I suggest carrying less to prevent popping the straps due to weight.
3.0,"Cheap for what they are. Very long delivery, but the expected dates are right, and a very wide range.<br />They sort of work, they reduce static charges as you walk around in a dry home, common in winter. Not much else to say about them, they are 'OK'."
3.0,there are comforable
3.0,Looks fine now that its repainted. Seems solid with a lot of detail. Too bulky to be worn as jewelry. You may get injured. The piece arrived with a copper like surface showing through the thin paint job. I repainted with a couple coats of good spray paint and it looks fine. Get what you pay for?
3.0,Ordered the mushrooms and got the wrong ring but it was still cute. It had butterflies with a meaningful message on the inside. it was ok because the gift receiver liked it still. It felt like good sturdy quality.
3.0,Did an OK job
3.0,Hi its a nice soft sweater. You have to look closely in the pic to see how thin it is.<br />Its a bit slouchy like in the pic but it doesnt seem too much shorter in the front than the back and it also doesnt come off the shoulder enough to see the tank top underneath..It does fit so I can use it but I was going<br />for more of the look on the advertisement.
3.0,"Super cute, but the distressed part on the bottom was ripped upon arrival, and a part to the (what you use to tighten it) strap came off. Which is an easy enough fix I suppose, just need a little sewing kit. Just a little inconvenient is all. Again, super cute and comfy. If your handy with a needle, I see no problems for you."
3.0,Insert keeps popping out.
3.0,They were larger than I had expected them to be
3.0,"At the point at which I ordered this item, the smallest size offered was medium, which I selected because I was fairly certain I was not L or XL. Looking at the measurements for a medium I am on the line between medium and small, so a medium should have been at least close to fitting, but if I’d known a small was going to be added to the offerings I would have waited to get a small even if it potentially meant the price would go up. The sleeve length and width is great, and the overall length is perfect, but the overall width could fit me and a couple friends, and cannot be mitigated by buttoning up as the buttons are solely for show. I was also disappointed because I expected more of a sweater-like feel to the fabric, but it definitely feels like a casual suit jacket. As this is a 100% polyester item, I suspect that despite the directions saying to wash in cold water that warm water washing will not shrink it much if at all. If I find this assumption is wrong and washing does modify the garment I will update this review, but I do not have high expectations at this point."
3.0,Not happy with zipper<br />Broke within a few months of use
3.0,"Great brand and great school, but the white color of the shirt was see through. Also, the Large was indeed very large. Still a good product, just make sure you know what you are buying."
3.0,They add really had me fooled.  I thought it was the MEIJEILUO brand sling bag.  It looks exactly like it until you pull it out of the wrapper.  Then it's clear that it's a cheap imitation.  For $3 extra dollars I should have bought the real thing.  Pretty sad when you have Chinese knocking off other Chinese products.  I would not recommend this to anyone.
3.0,It's alright.  44D breasts and it couldn't close all the way which is fine because I wear my shirts open anyway.  The shorts is the issue.  This is not for women who isn't a toothpick or have naturally big butt and hips.  It'll look like brief underwear on you. I just use it to sleep in.
3.0,The stones where very small . Thread Are not really strong.. They break easily
3.0,Top is”so-so”.  Not as quality as I’d prefer but colors are cute.  Fabric appears to be on thin side.  Not sure if I’ll keep or not 😔
3.0,Nice fit little smaller than expected
3.0,"This was really cute but the collar is awkwardly small and tight through the upper chest/ armpit area. Otherwise, it's great."
3.0,"the bottom half is made of a cheap, shiny, spandex type fabric. Im not a fan of it and doubt I'll keep it."
3.0,I didn’t expect a ‘sweatshirt’ to be so thin. A little disappointed and it runs small.
3.0,"Love the design, but it runs small and design doesn't run all the way around the belt."
3.0,Took forever to get here. My daughter likes thè bracelet though.
3.0,I absolutely loved this dress is ordered it in black for a wedding this weekend. Unfortunately I'm returning both sizes I ordered for to the area under the breast being made too narrow. I originally ordered a 10 and the zipper wouldn't go past this area on the back of the dress. So I then ordered a size up to a 12 and saw no difference in this area on the sz 12 dress either.  I'm bummed because the dress is gorgeous and sophisticated  but didn't fit properly in that one area. I normally wear a size 8 FYI.
3.0,It fit nicely but as i put it on it got a tear by the zipper didn't like but i fix it love the dress.
3.0,"I typically can wear medium(8-10) 5""6 and 145 lbs.  This was too snug and it just didn't fit right, I gave it to my daughter and it looked great on her. She is about 5'5 and 135 lbs.  Of course she has a flat tummy too."
3.0,"Ok, not necessarily high impact. Enough support, just not as much as I’d like"
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:e7dcb9a200dae1f34fd788fda8e2cf21]] Cute, lightweight, and comfortable while standing still. My crotch eats them immediately, and the waist band rolls down. Just not a good fit for my body type. I could never exercise in these."
3.0,Ordered a Med. It was huge. I’m 5’6’ 130 lbs. I returned it and didn’t order a new size. Didn’t love it
3.0,It’s cute but a bit bulky and not very delicate.
3.0,I would give it more stars but it's short other than that I love it
3.0,Really cute but cheaply made. Broke after a week.
3.0,Major camel toe - will be returning. I’m bummed because I had high hopes with the reviews 😞
3.0,"These are well made, nice shape and the green is just the right shade.<br />I would give these 5 STARS if it were not for the clip which is excedling strong, especiallly  for one with arthristic fingers.<br />however once clipped on they stay in place."
3.0,Shirt runs small. Was disappointed that the graphics are vinyl transfer and not screen printed. Shirt is soft as stated.
3.0,It really holds the misfit. Like death grip. Super hard to get in and out should you want to change to another holder. But it will never fall out!
3.0,I thought this watch would be bigger than it is.  The time on the watch was correct when I opened the package.
3.0,I haven't worn this hat yet.  I think it will be great when the weather gets colder as I can pull it down over my ears. It has a wool blend feel.
3.0,Very nice tote except for one problem. The leather has a fishy smell. I am hoping it will disappear.
3.0,"Though these are a little cute, they don’t look as cute ‘in person’ as they did in the amazon photo. However, they are still cute shoes. I think what takes away from the cute quality is that they are a little big on, especially across that wide strap with those wide toe areas, so it gives them this kind of old-fashioned dated look.<br /><br />The design on them is fine. The blue color is really pretty—I like that blue a lot and would wear them just for that blue. As well, the heel is stable and not too high so for those times I just want a little heel when I’m tired of flats or high-heels, these are a good alternative.<br /><br />But, they fit big on me, loose. Since they don’t have any straps other than the one across the front part of my foot, there is not a lot of support, and since that strap fits big, I am not as confident wearing them. I think putting something at the ball of my foot—one of those adhesive gel things—will help with that.<br /><br />Finding your size is problematic, only in that you may feel, as I did, a little unsure of just what size you are going to receive. I looked at the size chart—a 5 is a size US 7, so I guess that’s what I received. I wear a 6.5 to a 7 but they don’t offer half sizes. These likely are a 7 as they fit fairly well from heel to toe, but probably with these a 6.5 would have been better and perhaps helped (maybe?) with that too-big strap.<br /><br />It would be a big help if ‘find.’ would find a way to be more helpful or clear with finding our shoe size and if they offered half sizes—yes, we can look at the sizing chart, but if you look at the title of the shoe, it doesn’t indicate size to coordinate with that. It’s a little confusing (at least at the time of this review).<br /><br />They’ll be nice in the summer. The blue color is my favorite part, as I wrote above, with the heel being the second favorite part—everything else just makes the shoe not-quite-right. I’m glad I have them but wish they fit better.<br /><br />I hope my review helped you today."
3.0,"The ""glass"" over the face of the watch is actually plastic, which scuffed pretty disastrously within one of the first few wears. But I love the way it looks, (and I love what I paid for it even more -- it's richer-looking than the price would suggest) so I'm glad I bought it.<br /><br />The box it arrived in was even rich-looking, so this might be a great gift for somebody who doesn't mind a plastic-faced watch."
3.0,2pack. Good price. Warm for this fall weather.
3.0,Looks like a nice purse but material is cheap.
3.0,Did not hold up well to our recent winter.
3.0,"It is not for people with asthma! Very very very hard to breathe in. I felt out of shape by walking 50 feet in this. Its comfy with the ear loops. Would’ve been great if it were a smidge thinner for people with asthma. Nice quality and nice price, though."
3.0,"I thought this would make a great bath toy for a small child, but it won't work.  Baby ducks are too small and could pose a chocking hazard.  Recommend for over 3 yrs old."
3.0,"These are see through. Bought them in two colors (light purple and black) and they are both see through. It's like wearing thick stockings. The compression however is top tier and that's why I am keeping them. (5'8.5, 170ish and I ordered medium)."
3.0,A little longer than expected. Might go a size down
3.0,"Cheaply made, I’ll fitting beanie with a patch. Not worth the price at all."
3.0,It was so so cute but not made for big boobs. Will maybe order again when my boobs go down
3.0,"A little heavy, but nice to use late in the evening for checking emails, etc. on my phone before bedtime so I can fall asleep quickly."
3.0,I really liked it but I only gave it a three because the bracelet came apart I was able to fix it the first time but the second time it did it I lost it it's too bad cuz it was just what I was looking for.
3.0,The material was much thinner than I expected.  I ordered the pale yellow.  I loved the color but it is see through.
3.0,"After just a year of wear, the pearl slid right off the post while I was at work. Great price. Okay craftsmanship. Overall a good deal."
3.0,"I love the cork insole and the cushioning of the soles.  They are a little narrow and stiff but, hopefully will become very comfortable as they get broken in. I love the look."
3.0,Bracelet runs small. I wear a 7.5 and this bracelet is one that you will be aware you have it on because of the snug fit. A lot of little stones fell off as soon as I started to put it on my wrist.
3.0,"Cute colors, good construction for the price. Was able to almost put it on, but I prefer being able to breathe. Seem like they'll be good running bras so I'm saving them for after I start to lose some weight."
3.0,"Damaged product. I don't know if it was due to storage, packaging or a combination of both, but some of the flowers sewn on the bag were badly bent. Cute purse otherwise."
3.0,"The back of the bra ends up cutting into my neck while I'm wearing it. To me, that means it isn't made to fit DDD like it says. If it weren't for that, it would be 5 stars.<br /><br />I ended up cutting a V into the back of all 5 of the bras.  The fabric doesn't run which is great since I had to do it so they wouldn't cut into my neck."
3.0,"Color was what I expected.  A little longer tail and shorter interior lining than anticipated BUT the biggest thing was that the shoulders were sewn differently.  From the pictures/advertisement, the arm seam are angled from the neck to give the flowy style for the arms.  As you can see from my pictures, the arm seams are at the top edge of the shoulders making the sleeve somewhat constricted, not flowy.  The blouse fits fine (before washing) but just disappointed that the item sent wasn't exactly what was depicted.  I'm returning for this reason as I think the blouse would shrink based on the fabric which would make the arm sleeves really tight."
3.0,Thought it was going to be heavier but it does the job
3.0,The pale pink limits it to work with rest of wardrobe. You don't see the pink in the photos shown.
3.0,These size on the small side. They are created for the fit body. My husband is 6&#34; 215 and the XL was horribly tight. On another brand that is a bit relaxed he wears a Large...
3.0,It’s ok. The paint chips easily.
3.0,"Absolutely loved when I put them on.  The fabric is butter soft which is what I was looking for.  I'm 5'3"", 170 lbs and got the large.  Here's my complaint.  As soon as I sat down the waist rolled on me.  There isn't enough yummy control. I have a muffin top. Most leggings hold me in.  I don't know if going down a size would work."
3.0,"Disclaimer: I received this product for a free or a discount in exchange for an honest and un-biased review, this does not change my opinion of this product whatsoever. This is my honest opinion on whether I liked or enjoyed the product, thought it was of a high quality and did the job accordingly. I have no qualms on warning fellow customer of a bad product<br /><br />These are sooo super cute! They are sturdy and feel and look very high quality. I am super bummed because they are a little too thick to fit in my ears (it's been a while since I wore earrings) I am going to have to slowly stretch my holes a little to fit them in :( ughhh I am soo sad!<br /><br />This is the second pair of MOWOM earrings I have purchased and have been way too thick to fit through my hole, if they were pointed at the tips i would have probably been able to get these into my ears but the edges are totally straight like a screw, unlike normal earrings and so I can only get these about half way in before they get stuck and hurt :(<br /><br />So attention anyone else who has particularly small holes or hasn't worn earrings in a while you might struggle to get these in your ears but apart from that I am going to give these 3 stars because i love them but these are so much thicker than regular earrings! I wish they were pointed at the tip so it would be easier for me to slide them into my holes."
3.0,Costs little and you get what you pay for. This is designed for party use. It is not terrible it just isn't great.
3.0,Really cute skirt but it broke immediately
3.0,I ordered a large orange hoodie but received a yellow large but it turns out that that would be a good workout sweater and I really ordered another orange hoodie XlI guess I wish that I would've ordered an ex ex L because it's going to be for cold weather and I'm gonna wear a lot of stuff under it to the bronco games
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:5b257b2ae7a9c93fb49f3a714d175be5]] These are much smaller than the picture. The material is really light weight. They appear to be oval with a dangling heart, yet they are round. I gave them to my seven year old granddaughter. It's more suitable for her."
3.0,"The size chart doesn't consider its expansion when tightening.  My waist is 34&#34;, so I purchased the M (32-35&#34;), but when tigthening, it was about 6&#34; too long.  I should have purchased the S (27-31&#34;).  It's ok if you wear your belt loose."
3.0,"This is not for us curvy girls! I kept it in hopes I can wear in the future, but definitely size up if you are blessed with hips."
3.0,"While it has never actually fallen off my ears, it doesn't hug tightly enough to feel secure. It slips down and I often need to readjust it, and sometimes it slips out of place enough that it exposes a bit of my ears."
3.0,"Great seller!!!!! Very Attentive and Reasonable!!! :D A++++++++++++<br />Swimsuit fit as expected. I ordered a size Large. Unfortunately, the clasp ended up breaking before I could wear it. (Stitches came lose) It fit well but thought a size XL would be better. After talking with this seller about the clasp, they were able to send me a brand new swim suit with no additional cost. I had asked for a size XL but I ended up receiving the same size Large I had ordering initially. So now have two adorable suits, one broken and a brand new one that both don't fit the way I need LOL. Also, the suit did not break due to the size !! :)"
3.0,"This dress looked so beautiful I was excited to see it arrive.  I ordered a large as recommended, then when I “tried” to put it on it was at least 2 sizes to small. I then quickly ordered an XL thinking it will fit perfectly it was the exact same size as the large.  I’ve never felt better her in my life LOL I never wear an XL unless I want room.  This was incredibly saddening.  It’s size is NOT accurate. Definitely made for petite"
3.0,"I love this jacket but it has an unpleasant odor. The sleeves are nice and long for my long arms. Rarely find long sleeves for me. I aired it out but it still smells. I know I wouldn't be able to enjoy it so I'll most likely send it back and order another and see if it doesn't smell. Doesn't smell like leather but has more of a ""barnyard"" odor. Hope I get lucky."
3.0,Much thinner than I expected as the photos make it look more solid than it actually is. Served it's purpose tho.
3.0,"Good earrings at a good price, the problem is that most of the ones in my package have alot of sharp edges and are crooked, other than that they were awesome!!"
3.0,"I ordered blue but got purple. I liked them so I kept them. Slightly bigger than expected. Overall, these are beautiful and dressy."
3.0,"Two steps away from greatness.<br /><br />First of all, I bought this with my own money. No discount.<br /><br />I didn't really want a beanie. I wanted to use this in my ski helmet. For eleven dollars and change (delivered with prime shipping) this thing is pretty cool. The pairing was easy. The function buttons have good feedback. The speakers were surprisingly good. Most importantly, it has a zipper to remove the two speakers (one of which has a control module and battery).<br /><br />The headset dropped right into my Giro G10 ski helmet's ear pockets. The buttons are raised enough to feel them through the padding. The speakers are not as thick as [[ASIN:B019Q1AKEY Dreamruns Wired Ski & Snowboard Helmet Stereo Speakers]] and that is a plus. I skied all day with The Dreamruns last weekend and they were thick enough they applied too much pressure and hurt my ears. These didn't.  Also this has bluetooth built in so you don't have to buy a bluetooth controller like: [[ASIN:B00UUDZO9E Jumbl&#8482; Bluetooth 4.0 Hands-Free Calling & A2DP Audio Streaming Adapter/Receiver - Blue]]<br /><br />Considering that other bluetooth skiing headsets are much more expensive this thing is a steal.<br /><br />As a beanie it is warm and comfortable.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Unfortunately the Multi-Function-Button only has the following capabilities: power on, power off, play music, pause music, answer incoming call, call most recently dialed outgoing call. What's missing? Siri or Google Now voice control. There is no way that I have found to activate them. This is 2016 for crying out loud. While I'm skiing I should be able to tell my phone what to do without touching it. I want my phone to stay safely zipped in my pocket. Oh well. If you just want to listen to music, answer incoming calls, and don’t care about voice control, this thing works great.<br /><br />2) In the event that you actually want to use it as a hat you should know that the speakers, although adjustable, won't go over both your ears unless you place the control module over your right ear. It’s no problem to get the speakers to fit properly once the control module is over the right ear and the velcro zipper adjustment is completed over the left ear *BUT* the right and left channels are reversed. The control module is for the left channel and the smaller speaker is for the right channel.  It just shows me that the people in charge of the product aren't paying close attention to details. Still, for such a low price I can deal with the oversight.<br /><br />If they fixed the two cons at this price it would be a five star product for sure."
3.0,I bought it for our 3-6 m.old. it was hard to fit in and it never stayed on for some reason. with baby simplest leg motion boots felt off.
3.0,"It’s okay. Paper thin cheap material, has a weird shape that’s super unflattering. Personally not impressed"
3.0,"This is an ok hat.  I doesn't cover the bottom parts of my ears very well, so I have to keep tugging on it.  If you have a small head, it should fit fine."
3.0,"This is a very good sweat shirt.  Although claiming to be the same size as the older versions I  have bought, the new one is slightly smaller.  I have<br />not gained any wight.  It still fits,  It may stretch a bit -- I hope so.  It is warm and comfortable."
3.0,"The fabric is nice and if you are shorter than average, it's probably good. I am 5'7&#34; and normally a size M/8. Based on the size guide I still bought a large and the waist was tiny and the hem came to my ankles. I also bought a black XL and it just fits. still MUCH shorter than the photos though. I would go to the largest size and pin it or have it tailored. It's so inexpensive that it'd be worth it if I could get it long enough."
3.0,"Pros: the fabric is very soft, seems well made. I love the print.<br /><br />Cons: smallest size still too big for me. Not true to measurements listed in the description. Where the prints are sewn together on the hips pokes out at a weird angle, doesn’t lie flat.<br /><br />Over all it seems nice but I’m bummed it didn’t fit so it has to go back."
3.0,This necklace would have been better if the gold colored plating had stayed on longer. It now looks slightly goldish silver in color. Other than that it is a nice pendant.
3.0,"Chunkier than I thought but still like. The issue is that is started to turn daughter's finger green pretty soon after wearing. Did not have that ""metal"" smell that one would associate with a cheap metal ring...Hoping it was just a fluke."
3.0,i LIKE THE PJS BUT THE TOP IS ITCHY AND MUCH SMALLER THAN THE PANTS
3.0,"Got a large based on the measurements given by the seller but I think a medium would have fitted perfectly. I'm a U.K. size 10 with a 26 inch waist and 37 inch hips and I'm practically floating in the skirt. I will need to get it sized down by a tailor as I can't return it, being outside the US. The fabric is also thinner than I would like but it's cute enough."
3.0,"First off, it's darling, and it seems to be quality material.  Unfortunately, there's nothing 'loose' about it.  It fit over my arms and bust just fine, and I suppose I could wear it if I wanted something clinging to me, but that's not the case.  I ordered according to the provided size chart, but the chart only addresses shirt measurements.  With an item that's supposed to be knee-length, it would be nice to include hip circumference.  I gambled that it would fit because of the 'loose' descriptor, and I lost.  If you're a pear shape, be wary, or order up a size."
3.0,Really cute but they fit on regular or small heads. I was hoping they were large as they appear.. to fit on my over sized head nope.
3.0,Had to return because it was too small. The XL was more like a medium.
3.0,I am an adult woman and this was a bit wide for my feet. The synthetic leather looks a bit plastic on the outside. Reasonably comfortable.
3.0,"This shirt is made well, the colors are nice, but the sizing you need to size up two sizes from your regular size. I really love this top, but the material looks thinner than the pictures. It is light for summer. I usually take a size Lg, & went by the reviews and ordered down to medium, I should have ordered a size XXLG, it runs very small!"
3.0,"Given the fun, modern design and cut of this shirt, I fully expected to love it. Unfortunately I don't. I get that one can throw the ""organic"" label on anything and charge more, but almost $80 seems ridiculous for this sweatshirt.<br /><br />The fabric has a fairly rough feel to it. Given that it is nearly 100% cotton, I assume it will soften considerably over time but I probably won't wash and wear it long enough to find out.<br /><br />The fit is a bit too boxy to be flattering. It might be cute on a more petite girl but this average-height (5'8"") lady doesn't love the way it looks. The description states that the sleeves are structured for ease of movement. I actually find them quite stiff and restrictive.<br /><br />It's just not a very comfortable sweatshirt. Things I do like about it are the colors, design and flattering neckline. If this shirt was softer and made with a bit more stretch, I think I would really love it."
3.0,It is beautiful. Accents just about anything perfectly and the chain is adjustable
3.0,I love these boots but they are too narrow for my feet.  My feet are a little wide. I had to return them.
3.0,"I ordered these in a size 1 for my son.  He could not fit his foot into it.  I do have a younger son who wears a little boy's 11.  He wanted them, so I did not return them.  They are slightly large for my younger son, but it caused pain for my boy who has other size 1 shoes, to put these on his foot.  But the lights are awesome.  We have only had them a day and a half."
3.0,I guess I didn't read the description close enough. I thought this had a magnetic backing to protect my clothes but it is a pin. The flag pin is attractive but I am going to alter the back with a strong magnet. Prompt response. In sending the product from the seller.
3.0,"The top fit well, but the bottoms were way too small. Closer to a size large than a 2x."
3.0,Very pretty dress. Material is thin so you can see through it so you will need something to go over it like a jean jacket or something. Very soft. Length is perfect for 5'5!
3.0,Super skinny tie
3.0,"Sad, even the 6X didn't fit me :(<br />I was lead to believe it would fit like a XL."
3.0,"I wear a 16, got an XL. The front is way to high to be a dress.  I'm 5&#34;5 and if I wore this garment as a dress my crotch would be on display, while the back hits below the back of my knees. But with leggings it makes for a cute shirt.  Very lightweight. Arms a little tight.  3 stars because I still found use for it."
3.0,Great for pictures but not for walking! I’ll use these for my cosplay photos then will switch to more comfortable shoes at the con! They look good though.
3.0,"It's really pretty however ours came REALLY REALLY wrinkled. There are no instructions on how to remove the wrinkles other than don't iron, don't dry clean. I emailed the company and they said to wash it in  cold water and hang in the sun? Cleaning instructions would be helpful. As far as sizing...order your regular T- shirt size worked for us."
3.0,"these are ok, feel like felt and they itch REALLY bad. Little white flint balls end up alll over them and then strings pull and it leaves a mark"
3.0,"It fits nicely ... maybe a tad bit small, so if you are debating between two sizes, go with the larger one. I really wanted a white shirt, but it is a little see-thru. Since it is snug, wearing a cami or tank under it won't look good."
3.0,"Sizing is way off.  Ordered 11.5, had to send back.  Ordered an 11, and the size in the shoe says 184mm.... which does not correspond with any of the size charts.  Ordered a 10, and that is 180mm.  Again, not right.  Like the product, but sizing is a huge issue."
3.0,"The product photos are very deceiving--it looks very different than you'd expect. It's soft and relatively comfortable, and it fits well. But the material and the design is kind of weird and looks cheap. Fine for wearing around the house for an extra layer, but I doubt I'll wear it out of the house."
3.0,More hold than rose gold
3.0,The lenses are smaller than I thought but they are really cute and comfortable.
3.0,After several attempts we finally got the right color!
3.0,Beautiful bag but smaller than I anticipated.  I will be keeping it because it's so pretty but not practical for everyday use.
3.0,"Really good material! I actually use this shirt with a black fitted dress. That way, if it rolls up, no skin will show. What I did not like, was the fact that it was a little shorter than I expected, and even saw on the picture. I highly recommend that this shirt gets air dried and make sure you understand that they go by asian sizes."
3.0,It's just a bit cheap looking.
3.0,The purse is not horrible but the straw is more yellow than beige.
3.0,It looks adorable on. Only gave 3 stars because as soon as I took it out of the packaging most of the charms fell off. Luckily a pair of needle nose pliers did the trick to reattach them tightly!
3.0,"The PRO's:<br />-dripping in sequins, front AND back<br />-nice color and pretty dress overall<br />-great price<br />The CON's:<br />-Large is more like a Medium. I'm 5'7, 170 pounds, 34 waist, 38 DD and the large was barely fitting, too tight<br />-Way too short in the back, it shows the tush without even bending -maybe cuz it's too small overall, although it fits well on hips<br />-Stiff and itchy at the edges because of the sequins<br />-Doesn't stretch much, if at all<br />I'm still pondering whether to keep it (to wear after I lose 10 pounds), gift it, or send it back.<br />For 14 bucks..I dunno, I might keep it and see how it fits in a few months, shed some pounds meanwhile, for the summer season."
3.0,"I got these after reading some of the reviews. You have to take any review with a grain of salt. I for one, own the real deal (these are definitely knock offs!) but don't want to wear them everyday.<br /><br />So, I purchased these knowing that despite the picture, they would probably be just a low price fit and material.<br /><br />They did not disappoint! They wear price appropriate. I like the size, but they have an odd fit, something is a little off. Maybe it's because they were shipped in a large paper envelope, no box!"
3.0,This is hard rubber they do not stretch. My grandson's sneakers have eye holes on the sides this will not work with them. I couldn't get them to work on my granddaughter either.
3.0,"The material is thin and cheap and feels like it would be very easy to tear.  But, it does keep the rain off, so does the job it is intended to do at least."
3.0,"Usualmente uso esta talla, pero esta en particular me quedo grande"
3.0,"I based my size choice off of my chest size which matched up to getting a medium leotard.  Once it arrived and I tried it on, my chest did not fit in at all.  Very far from flattering.  I will be returning the leotard back soon."
3.0,"I will probably be replacing this very soon, even though I just bought it.  This snags my clothes badly, even though it LOOKS like it wouldn't.  Seemed durable, but it's costing me too much money to replace clothing."
3.0,"It's a little big on the ears, and flips upside down a lot; otherwise it's okay I guess :-("
3.0,"So Im actually very disappointed now. I bought 2 pairs one green one black To go under skirts. Black came in 2 days perfect, love them, loved the feel, and LOVED the fit.<br /><br />A week later I got the other pair (SUPPOSED TO BE GREEN) they came in grey. Not even a pretty grey.<br /><br />Would have been 5 stars had you sent me the correct color in a timely fasion like my first pair. Had every intention to buy serval more pairs, not so sure now."
3.0,Quality good but the hole  Is so large that  it stays turned upside down on the chain. Would not reorder.
3.0,Have come apart drying off after the shower.
3.0,"Material wrinkles easily, but it’s a pretty bright red dress."
3.0,"Very cute swimsuit but the bra does not fit well. I'm a size 12/14 and ordered an xxxl, the suit fits fine and it's really comfortable, but the cups are ill-fitted. They look like they would scoop up water.<br />The straps are detachable, so I'm going to move them over an inch or so and see if that helps."
3.0,Bought for my daughter.  She said that she loves how comfortable they are and how warm they are
3.0,"Buyer beware!!!!<br />This shirt is White, Navy Blue and ORANGE, not RED."
3.0,I bought this for our kids since we had very few goggles. These goggles do not fit larger heads like adults' but they do serve well for those with smaller heads. They don't irritate skin and they stay on fairly well.
3.0,fabric seems thin.  just washed but haven't worn again test. Took FOREVER to get here.  Color and pattern good.
3.0,Robe is sewn well but the fabric is a bit sheer. I got a white one for a friends bridal shower gift. Robe has pockets and you can see outline of pockets. The darker colors may be more opaque.
3.0,Bought for the more adventurous nights with the wife. Fit wasn't terrible. Keeping the mouth opening lined up with the eye padding wasn't the best and my wife wasn't a fan of the smell of the material. Not unpleasant but you get what you pay for.
3.0,Loved this shirt but too small and short.  Returning and going to wayyy size up - 3 sizes.  Still a very chic shirt just watch out for sizing.
3.0,"So the product itself is fine, but it's way too small for a toddler...it should be sold as an infant hat..."
3.0,"In theory, the cubes are great. I used them for 1 trip and rolled all of my clothes and was able to fit lots of clothing in 2 small bags. Unfortunately, they are flimsy. After this single use, one of the cubes has a hole in a seam that I worry will happen to the other cubes in the set as well. A 4-5 star product that I would drop to 3.5 for the quality control, so have to drop to 3 without that option on Amazon rating system."
3.0,So I got a small and I’m 165lb with a bust of 38DD. IT FITS BIG AND I got a small. It’s cute shirt but runes super big
3.0,"These Cocoship 2-piece sets are an oddity!  The bottoms were a good fit, maybe a little big, but the top is small and a very strange shape. I didn't necessarily mind the rigidity of the cup but the placement of the cups was off.  Additionally, the stitching quality is suspect as the center front zipper is crooked, wavy, and not dead center.  Not a great item.<br /><br />I am keeping the set for the bottoms and will wear them with a different top I purchased elsewhere.  The retro cut is cute and the leg holes are cut low so that my behind is all contained.  The top is going to Goodwill."
3.0,It’s very cute but way larger than I expected. I’m 5’4” and it comes down past my knees. The bonnet-style hat is just adorable and the whole costume itself is practical and comfortable.
3.0,very small but I liked the style
3.0,Large in some places and short/small in other spots.
3.0,Loved the charm.The chain was in knots
3.0,The color was wrong.
3.0,"The quality of the suit was great, but the fit was entirely too small.  I normally wear a 6 or an 8, and the large top did not cover enough of my chest.  The bottoms fit pretty well though."
3.0,"I'm 5'0 and 165 pounds. I ordered a Large. It was hard to get it over my chest and hips with the zipper completely undone and it's impossible to zip up. The apron feels like it's meant for a medium instead of a large. Fortunately, I'm somewhat crafty and I believe I can manage to pin the collar shut and do some hemming to make it look like a keyhole dress. The fabric isn't my favorite but it does have 2 built in slips under the dress that are white and one sheer with white lace at the bottom. The outfit overall is really cute but it's unflattering if you have a big bust. It will make you look lumpy and kind of flat. I'd say go for it if you have a smaller frame because really my main issue is the sizing."
3.0,Very sturdy case but the buttons are hard to push and the clip comes apart easily. But not bad for the money
3.0,I wish it was all solid color.
3.0,Beautiful but I needed 2-3 sizes bigger than what I ordered (norm size L). Gave away to friend who loves it and she usually wears a small
3.0,This is a beautiful dress but the pleats mess it up.  I haven't been able to was it yet as the pleats lee coming out wrong. The material is float.  It's hard and rigid.  I really wanted to wear it.  Sigh
3.0,"These earrings are ADORABLE but due to the way they open I have a really hard time putting them in my ears. I have only been able to get them in once. The design is real cute and the material seem sto be of good quality, theyre just so hard to wear."
3.0,It's a bit heavy on my nose but it's clear
3.0,"I wouldn't call this a fleece, it's really nice but this must be the loosen definition of fleece possible."
3.0,"Pretty design, pretty color. Love the fit! But, it’s a painted on design. Plus, if you’re wide in the shoulders, because the print is so long across, it accentuates this."
3.0,"The Molly Clog Shoe didn’t fit correctly. The EU 38 too small and EU 39 too big. Weird. Therafit shoe also shipped the incorrect color of Mindy clog (gray instead of black). I returned them for an exchange and haven’t heard anything since 🤷‍♂️🤷🏽‍♀️. FYI, they keep $10 to put the shoes back!"
3.0,No really true to size. But really cute
3.0,"just ok - cheap, plastic-like material, but it was inexpensive so I guess I should have expected that."
3.0,"I ordered a medium, which is my size 95% of the time.  It looked like I was wearing a kids shirt that I buttoned wrong. It might have been cuter if I ordered a larger size.  I thought the asymmetrical concept was really a cute idea."
3.0,Cute and lightweight as I wanted but sleeves are so short. Don’t even cover wrists. Disappointing.
3.0,Was too loose and too low.. with the straps being that wide. I had to return.
3.0,"It was a really pretty dress, but wished the floral print continued onto the back, made it look cheap."
3.0,It’s a cute dress. Shorter than I thought it would be. The bust is small and fits tight. The pattern is much larger than the picture.
3.0,The suit was well made and beautiful but it was way too small. I would have repurchased if they had something larger than an XL.
3.0,it run small
3.0,Well there very soft fit foot wise and leg not to tight at top like most compression socks but they go a little to far fir my liking and will bunch up behind the knee ! Wish they were just about inch shorter they would be Perfect! I really like them other than that one thing !
3.0,The red color was amazing. It will help bring my costume to life.
3.0,I was initially satisfied however all 3 fell apart within 6 months.
3.0,Was looking for something smaller.
3.0,"The cup size is perfect,  yet the back and sides need to be a little longer.  The style is pretty.  Don,t know the product link"
3.0,Can wear it as a dress!
3.0,It feels very cheap and it runs large.
3.0,Cute. Usually wear a medium and it was a little big on me. Not great quality. The seam broke and made a whole like the second time worn
3.0,The compression is what I expected but I'd prefer that the band at the top be wider and that my toes didn't get caught in the blue weave on the inside of the sock.  I have a different brand compression sock that has a band of color around the foot and ankle but there aren't any threads inside to catch my toes on.
3.0,Delivery was very timely.  The necklace is a little thin.  But I really cant complain for the price.  The medal itself is nice. Not too big and not tiny.  This is going in the Easter basket for my 8 yr old son.  I think he will like it.
3.0,"I have the pink and gold ones and once I seen the all black,I knew I had to have them and now I do.The all black ones seem more sturdy than the pink/gold ones.I love how big they are."
3.0,"Cute shirt but the arms are way too small. I'm 5'3 size 8/10 and ordered the medium and large to try based on the other reviews. For the medium, the body fit fine with plenty of flow, but the arms were very, very tight. I tried the large, and while I could tell it was bigger, the arms were still too tight. Unfortunately, I  had to return both bc of the disproportionate way they are made."
3.0,cute fit but could use more support
3.0,"The band is sparkly and pretty. It’s also comfortable to wear. However, the buckle doesn’t stay put and slides down to make the bands loose throughout the day. Switched out after a week."
3.0,Runs large. Definitely have to layer something underneath and wear with a cardigan. Seems like it's made out of bathing suit material and makes it look cheap.
3.0,It's really cute but the pearls on the sleeves fall off every time you wear the dress which is really disappointing at this point the sleeves will be bald after wearing 5x. And the dress overall is loose and will need a belt to make it look good without it looks like you're wearing a smock
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress. The material felt good and has stretch. It fit perfectly and hides my big belly well. What I didn't like was how the front seam was sewed at the bottom of the dress. It left the edge with a wavy pattern which was totally obvious. I also didn't like how the X part (on chest area) kept riding up to my neck, accentuating my double chin. I'm 5'2"", 210lbs, size 16 in dresses. I ordered an XL. This dress will probably look good on women more taller and slender."
3.0,Very comfortable but the fabric pilled and looked worn after then first wash.
3.0,"I've alway wanted a pair like these.  They are expensive and I caught a lightening deal, so I took the plunge.  They arrived on time.  I tried them on and they didn't fit like the model.  They were a little short.  They just didn't look right on me.  I returned them. If you are slim like the model it will look good.  I'm not that big, but they didn't drape the same way. It made me look bigger. I wouldn't tell anyone not to buy them."
3.0,Fabric was a little thin and seams were showing threads out of the bag. Nice color and style as pictured. Not great for Apple shaped petites with shorter legs. The light blue color block falls across your thighs and won’t flatter straighter builds. Missed the return window so will try eBay.
3.0,"I purchased the band shortly after buying the Gear S3 Frontier and it's a very nice looking band.  As others have written, though, the band is fairly stiff and inflexible and, for many wrists, too long.  Though I was able to wear it comfortably, it was always difficult to put the band through the second retaining loop.  The holes are also fairly separated from one another, meaning it's difficult to find a good snug fit for the watch.<br /><br />Eventually, I decided to go back to wearing the original band that came with the watch because it is more flexible and easier to put on and remove.  I deducted one star for the stiffness of the band and the inability to find a good, snug fit due to the large spaces between the holes.  I deducted one additional star for how difficult it is to remove the band if you no longer want to use it.  Unlike higher quality bands, which consist of two pieces held in place with a spring along with a visible post that you can use to compress the spring and easily release the band, there was no visible way to remove the band.  I had to resort to using a thin wedge--like a knife or a small screwdriver--to pry one end of the band loose so that I could remove each piece.  I found that to be a poor design and frustrating.<br /><br />Pros:<br />• Good looking<br />• Durable<br />• Breathable material<br /><br />• Cons:<br />• Stiff<br />• Large gaps between holes<br />Difficult to remove"
3.0,Light duty hoodie. Worth the money.
3.0,They are really cute. They definitely run too big! (Probably about a size maybe size and a half too big) And the in soles come out after taking your foot out of them.
3.0,"Love the material and breathable bag; however I thought 2 shoes would fit into one bag and they do not...possibly slender shoes such as flip flops or sandals, but they do not fit a pair of sneakers.  I bought this to take to the gym and transport my sneakers."
3.0,I am not sure what I was expecting with this skirt but this is not it. My fault for not buying the right thing. Material is a jersey stretch and feels very light and airy. I wanted a cotton to match the rest of my outfit but it will work for this one time. Fit was perfect though on the waist and length.
3.0,"I give these 3 stars because they are nice sunglasses. However, they are definitely not the item I  ordered. I was ready to return them because they were much smaller and darker than the ones I ordered, but I needed them ASAP for an outing so I kept them. They ended up working just fine, but you get a little disappointed when you do not get the exact item you ordered."
3.0,"Brought this dress after seeing a post from an amazon influencer. I totally missed to see the back of the dress. Not sure if i will wear it now and how. The dress fits above the knees and runs big on me,. I am 5.3"" and 134lbs. will have to find ways to cover the back and also wear the dress.<br />The quality is good and decently made"
3.0,"Backpack is really nice, like it a lot.  Unfortunately I didn’t like how the mouth piece worked. It would get stuck and it leaked a bit.  Bummer<br />Wish I could’ve just traded the bladder for a different type suction tube."
3.0,"Looks quite a bit longer in the photo, so I'm a bit disappointed in the short length of it when received. But having said that I still like it and will keep it. Fits well, nice color, and very affordable."
3.0,I always buy 2 sizes bigger online. These sizes are for children way to small.
3.0,It’s a little tight in the bust and little long
3.0,"They are way too big.  Fall off my head.  I can't wear. I like the color and the weight, I wish they fit."
3.0,"This is a really nice and inexpensive beach cover up, however it definitely runs pretty large. I am 5' 1 and of small to medium build and this cover-up definitely consumes me up. It is of course a great item to throw over a swimsuit on a hot day as it will help with providing you a nice breeze.<br /><br />Overall, i do recommend this cover-up as a cheap alternative to much more expensive options."
3.0,"The earrings were a little smaller than I expected, and the gemstome does not look as high quality in person as it does in the picture. But they get the job done."
3.0,IT'S NOT AS ILLUSTRATED. it was still nice. I'm 5'5 140 and ordered a small and it was too big. I would have kept if the fitting was nice
3.0,"I just received these earrings. The description stated that these would be 5 “small cuff huggie hoops” & ”eternity-band-setting” earrings. Three of the pair are post style earrings and NOT hoops, so they are not what I wanted even though I read carefully (you really cannot tell from their pictures). They are pretty and designs match the ad photo."
3.0,But not very comfortable for me.
3.0,"I liked the color, but I ended up returning the band. The material was almost thicker than the metal attaching pin, which made it really difficult to put on my versa. If you don't switch out your band a lot, then this band would work great for you, but I usually switch mine out every day."
3.0,too thin and small not a rosary
3.0,Not too heavy the glasses are comfortable
3.0,Dress was very cute but I sent back because it was see through
3.0,my husband wears a 11 and large was too small for him could have used an extra large but the size stop at large
3.0,Lovely jumpsuit But was too tight for the size I order I have to my daughter and she wears a larger And it was even tight on her It just runs small you need to order 2*s the size
3.0,"Was looking for a slouchy fit top to wear with leggings. I ordered a M when I normally wear S and it was still not flowy/draped enough. Kept it because it is a lovely T with high quality, though, and the color is fab."
3.0,"Very beautiful, but collects fuzz and the bracelet is already starting to fray after wearing for two weeks.  I would definitely buy this again, but I'd recommend not buying for everyday wear."
3.0,"Beautiful earrings, however one of the backing was broken and wouldn't close, so I am returning them."
3.0,"This anklet was cute, nothing fancy, but for the price I paid it is a cute little piece of costume jewelry."
3.0,Love the looks not the quality but expected for the low price
3.0,"The hat is great for its price; I liked the feather accent. The actual material is fairly thin and given it arrives folded in a box, it takes a little work to get it in the right shape. Thinking I will upgrade to a real one for next Oktoberfest."
3.0,Hard to read in daylight but the indiglo function is absolutely bright and vibrant. When not pushing that light the numbers are too muted against the grey background. I have had several times since 1995 only watch I've ever had. First time with this issue. Possible that the faceplate is too dark
3.0,"Love the fit and comfort, but the black is already starting to fade and the fabric is becoming fuzzy after just two washes.  I've only hand-washed it in cold water, so didn't expect it to happen so quickly."
3.0,cute but not for my body shape!~
3.0,Material is like spandex. Fits about 1 size smaller than it says and color is not what it looks like in picture
3.0,quality was good but extremely small
3.0,"I'm 5'2&#34; and 247 lbs. Just a bit too tight. Will keep, because I'm losing weight, so it won't be long before I can wiggle into these comfortably."
3.0,They must have small size 13's in China.
3.0,The shirt is a nice light material.  I ordered the size I always wear and it was way too small.  I was unable to wear it.
3.0,I love the look. I bought a size 9 (my actual size). It was too snug so I ordered a size 10. It fit the same as the 9! Make sure you order up a size or two. They were ordered within days after the first pair was received. So it's not because of weight gain.
3.0,Works ok. Does not lock tight enough for some reason. It always migrate if I leave it on for some time.
3.0,"Thick and warm, however they run VERY large.  They were too large for the intended recipient."
3.0,So I bought this for my 9 yr old niece primarily for the pedometer. It didn't work. She also didn't like that you cant change the main wallpaper. I had to return it.
3.0,"Really nice earrings, however not real gold and because of that, they irritate my ears to the point of me rubbing and scratching my ears, then they begin to bleed...."
3.0,These sandals run 2 sizes too small for my kids. They seem nice quality though.
3.0,It may just be my body shape they fit but not like I would like them to fit I don’t like how they fit around the waist and my waist is the smallest part of me I’m kind of picky about the waist of anything and where it hits me is a game changer for me I kept them but if I had it to do over I would probably have returned them
3.0,"its small-- must find a way to make it bigger for wrist. will have to do some research to figure this out. otherwise, very nice"
3.0,Just what it says on the tin: black clip on earrings surrounded with diamantes. Fine for a costume but not actually attractive in any way.
3.0,This was pretty but the crystal fell off on second wear. Hook was not connected in center of the stone.
3.0,Short on the bottom
3.0,Exactly as it seemed.
3.0,Ok quality but shorter than shown.
3.0,Cute but not pearls.
3.0,"These are ok, they are a bit thin and cheaper made thank I expected. The waist when stretched sounds like its ripping??"
3.0,"Good looking, ear cups fit me, just a little small, bought it for my 3yo, could be a little smaller to get them off his jaw and seal better. Seem a little tight, even on his little head. He doesn't seem too upset having them on."
3.0,Product size was not accurate.
3.0,I ordered the set with light grey and “black” the black is heather grey NOT black. I’m super annoyed! Other than that they are fine. But I’m returning because I need black
3.0,"The shoe is pretty cool. The color is bright and hasn’t scuffed so easily. They charge pretty quick, and the remote works very well.<br />The issue is the lights themselves. Although they are bright and very cool to look at, especially at night; the lights end up going out and not turning on, or the colors just mess up and get stuck.<br />Unfortunately, after about 1 month of wearing one to two Days a week, the first Light got stuck on two colors, like it couldn’t properly switch to the others. So it was either green or blue. Nothing else, while the other lights would cycle through a range of colors.<br />Another month and some lights started to flicker out and not turn on again.<br />Definitely a great novelty buy, and they’re decently comfy, but don’t expect them to last you forever. If you’re cool with that, then you’ll be fine and should buy it. If not, then maybe keep looking."
3.0,"Although these are pretty, they didn't seem to really be that well made.  The stem part that goes into my ear, was completely bent, and I am scared to bend it straight because them stem will probably;y break off :("
3.0,It is some what large and too long. It is a very pretty dress.
3.0,"My problem with this top is that it wasnt as long as I thought the picture showed.  I decided to keep it, but I wouldnt by another."
3.0,surprisingly small
3.0,Mask runs a little on the small side just a FYI .  Mask comfort is ok nothing great
3.0,Doesn't look as I expected but is not too bad.
3.0,"Not really comfortable, but look good"
3.0,Pieces don't fit flush together.  Has gaps where the pieces should connect.  The color however is exactly what I wanted.
3.0,"Beautiful ring! Definitely turns heads. Everything about it is cute and pretty. I wear it to work and I don’t know if I am hard on my hands or what but after 1 day the white gold plated has chipped off on the back and it looks like some copper color underneath,, it’s not noticeable right away but I would hate to see it after a month or two. Hopefully the plated doesn’t come off soon."
3.0,I was looking to where the slippers on my wedding day for my getting ready for Tire. I received the package it said size 10 but the actual shoe said size 8. So I was a little disappointed that I didn’t get to wear them for my big day and I had to return them. But they are beautiful slipper and it looked like they were great quality.
3.0,Small fit and not as pretty as picture but still nice.
3.0,Muy lindas pero demasiado pequeñas. Pedí dos números diferentes y enviaron el mismo número que además no cordinaba con el size que decía.
3.0,Looks ok but I order 22 mil and it is under 21 mil.Returned and thank God for the great customer service.
3.0,Quality looking but will turn your skin green
3.0,"Very understated, but lovely bracelet. Unfortunately, tarnishes quite quickly (less than a month after purchase). You get what you pay for."
3.0,"Fit fine, feel good... Price right... Balled up when washed... SOLUTION: turned them inside out when throwing them in the washing machine, result = no problem..."
3.0,"I bought these because my daughter loved the hello kitty, but I wish it was done a bit better. The hello kitty falls off pretty easily when brushed off with literally anything so they are easy to lose. Same with the strap, it is not that great and when playing around or just putting on your jacket can un fasten the strap and fall off, which is why there’s a black rubber band to help but even that won’t do."
3.0,Fits a little tight. Nice looking though.
3.0,SHOULD HAVE ORDERED FOR MY WAIST SIZE 10 YEARS AGO !
3.0,It's cute but I don't like that the letter don't stay in place on the hair pens. If they were a little thicker they probably would. Debating on sending it back
3.0,"It looks ok. Very small in real, anyway my wife liked it"
3.0,This is a great device if you carry your phone on your pocket or belt but it will loose sound quality at 4ft or longer. I tried to connect to my pc blue tooth to listen to sound but the sounds goes away when I turn my head away from the bluetooth transmitter. Other than that its ok.
3.0,Everything about it looks and is great. But the watch broke the first day.
3.0,The charm is ok. You really can't see the blue color and the opal is a flat color. I would not recommend.
3.0,Seemed to stretch quicker than I thought...nose piece doesn't stay firm over nose.
3.0,Got this as a joke for my boyfriends dad and it is a very thin material. You get what you pay for here. Still pretty nice.
3.0,Very cute but it runs small.
3.0,Too small for my big head
3.0,"I really like them, but they have a chemical smell that has not faded much even after several washings. If you are not sensitive to that, then they are warm and comfortable."
3.0,Very stiff and does not hold as much as I would like.
3.0,"the fit was weird, not for hippy ladies"
3.0,The fit is wonderful. But every dog/cat hair in a three mile radius will attach to the jogging suit.
3.0,Nice fit material no so much but I can deal with it looks great with my jeans
3.0,Lovely set. On the small side but perfect for additional holes in ears.
3.0,Sizes fit small buy 1 size up if you want it to fit right! Buy 2 sizes if you want it to fit loose!
3.0,They are ALOT bigger than what I expected. They are still  absolutely adorable and seem to made of quality material.
3.0,"no lining in this handbag.,but it was nice looking."
3.0,Unfortunately I have to return this product because it did not fit. You may need to size up two sizes versus one if you have a lot of lower belly.
3.0,Well made product but don't fit well at all...they sit way high on the eyes. The only way they sit well is if you put them on the end of your nose. So they may fit some well but not I.
3.0,Material is good but elastic part was not properly assembled some of them are tight or just not even. And for the price I would of expect better fit and consistency between each mask. I bought a pack for me and one for my girlfriend and same thing Like the design and material but some of them were not even. And were uncomfortable to wear.
3.0,"Glad I bought a medium, when usually I buy smalls in just about everything. The medium is slightly shorter in the legs than I would like and I'm 5'6 and 120lbs."
3.0,Material is ok overall...outfit fits really small a medium would have been a better fit for me althought I'm more on the petite side
3.0,For some reason the pin is a tiny bit to  small n band doesn’t stay on. I know I ordered the right sixe 18mm
3.0,item was smaller then description.  it was returned
3.0,The balls were bigger than I thought and the strand smaller.
3.0,Just okay. Was listed as hitting below the knee but actually stops at knee...I'm short and should not have this problem!
3.0,"Look, if you are ample, don't buy the bra.  After a good wear, you will sag.  Invest in Goddess.  This is a $25.00 bra and it will look it in your clothes."
3.0,Send  it back was to tied on me didn't like the way both of them fit
3.0,"Great dress, overall! It’s good quality and well made, with a zipper at the side and two buttons at the neck for easy on/off. But the waist hit me waaaaay too high- and I’m high/short waisted as it is! I’m 5’8” and a 4/6, so I have a feeling this dress would be great on a shorter person. The first picture is me pointing to where my actual waist is vs. where the waist on the dress is. The second picture is me shrugging my shoulders to show how much it rides up every time I move. Unfortunately going to return this one."
3.0,"Super cute, but the buckle tends to loosen as the day wears on"
3.0,These don't have much support and the flare at the bottom just looks kinda weird. The pockets are nice.
3.0,"Fitover fan, but these were too small to fit over glasses.  Had to return them.  They looked good and feel like they would have been fine, just needed them a little bit larger."
3.0,The dress is super cute but the split in the back is very high and there is no way you can wear it unless you get it fixed by a seamstress.
3.0,"Who do I contact about product concerns. I've received the product and purchased it under the impression that it was compatible with my Moto 360 watch, which it is not."
3.0,"Pretty good material but too big for my almost 3 year old. My kids are on the trim/skinny side, but they fit my 4.5yo better."
3.0,Two small but I hate sending anything back
3.0,"This is a nicely shaped, very lightweight jacket.  The hem of the back hit my beltline, so it's not too short.  I am a size 10-12 and I ordered the XL, which fit just right.  It arrived pretty wrinkly, so I will need to iron it out both for the wrinkles and to get the lapel to lay as in the picture.  I will use this in the spring and summer for work with a sleeveless white shirt and tan capris.  I think it will be a nice addition to my seemingly all-black wardrobe!"
3.0,"It’s comfy, and has nice weight to it, but it had an area where it was not hemmed right, with the loose end exposed.  I had already washed it by the time I noticed it, (it is in the back), and i bought it to wear at home, so I kept it.  Apart from that, worth buying."
3.0,"The connector chain in the back is so fragile, keeps popping loose or getting caught on collars or hair..."
3.0,XL fits a little small...
3.0,"I made the bugs repellent using the essential oil in the 8oz bottle, it nozzle stop working after 3/4 of the bottle."
3.0,This fits great and the material is not thin like some. Appears to be well made. My only problem is that it smells bad--like turpentine or something. It's gone through the wash 2x now and the smell is still slightly there.
3.0,I liked the soft leather and loved the color. It was smaller than I expected.
3.0,I was shocked that you could see my undergarments in this dress. I also feel that the bodice runs a little small for larger busted women.
3.0,"Love the mask, but had a horrible time trying to get all the wrinkles out of the mssk."
3.0,"Although the description says it fits an iphone 6Plus, it doesn't. The iphone slides in, but you cannot snap the closure."
3.0,Its ok for a starter or a kid play purse...chains like to spread open an come apart
3.0,"It’s just OK, doesn’t stretch very much and gets loose pretty easily.  I measured exactly in between the XS and the S, so I ordered both.  Not very accurate sizing as the XS is too large!  The thickness of the band makes it less comfortable, though it is attractive.  Will not buy again."
3.0,"Really like the look of these, but like many brands that originate from Asia, the sizes are hard to match up, as these run a bit small. Good side pockets and the built in underwear will hold a large phone. I do like the zippered back pocket, but it will scratch up a chair or the seat of a car, so beware of this as I am not sure how to get the scratches out of my leather seat."
3.0,"The fabric is soft, but the shirt runs extremely small. Definitely size up!"
3.0,"This was very large. I followed the sizing instructions and ended up sending this back. Cute design, but just way too big."
3.0,These worked well for resin. You do have to be careful though because the color scrapes off pretty easily. They also show wear a little easier than I would like.
3.0,"(Reviewed by my wife): I love everything about this dress except for the wrap top.  The wrap likes to slide open and expose my breast/bra.  I may try to see if I can sew on a snap to keep it closed.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is an amazing dress.  The royal blue color is exquisite. The ruching at the waist is so flattering.  The A-line skirt is feminine and forgiving.  The length is just right.  The stretchy fabric makes the dress comfortable and practical."
3.0,I wear medium to large in most brands. Large is a little tight in the chest/armpit area
3.0,"Way smaller than I expected, I'm a 34b for reference."
3.0,Its ok nothing great
3.0,I was excited that the onesie arrived in time however the lettering in my baby’s name was peeling.  I didn’t even realize that it wasn’t stitched in.  It was to late to order another onesie in time for his party so I used this one however the lettering should be stitched and not ironed on.
3.0,The design is actually very cute and looks as pictured. But this is not a sweatshirt it a weird thin polyester material. Fits small size up one or two. It’ll do for a onetime wear for St. pays but I don’t elect a lot of life out of this.
3.0,I was not expecting the inside of the dress to be white on a Navy dress and it looks super tacky when you’re wearing it and the white from the inside is showing. Not what i expected and not worth the money.
3.0,Very small and sticks to face.
3.0,"Kids size, very small. I probably didnt read the size correctly so my own fault but yes, I think this would likely fit a tween or a young teenager, but not much older than that. I myself have fairly small wrists and it wasn't even close to fitting me comfortably"
3.0,"Held up for about 10 washes. Hem came loose, shirt is trash now"
3.0,"I purchased this bag based on the reviews and description stating that the phone could be used through the bag. Although yes in fact you can use the phone l, it is not the easiest thing to do. Takes a lot of effort to get the touchscreen to work. I tried it with and without my case on the phone and neither worked for me. Unfortunately I have to return this product. I feel it is a good bag just to carry your phone around easily, it just didn't work the way I intended it to."
3.0,I ordered this for my 8 year old son. He is normal size. It fit just right if not a little on the small side. When I ordered I could not find a Kelce jersey that was bigger than the size 7. The size jump up to adult after the size 7. My son still loves it and I am glad I ordered it.
3.0,The dress fits nicely everywhere but the chest. It's definitely intended for the more well endowed. I'm a 34 B and it left a lot of dress in the front needing to be filled.
3.0,"Although it does look nice, my shades came in crooked as one side was higher than the other. But you do get what you pay for."
3.0,"The wrong size came at first, so I had to reorder it again. After reordering it, the right size came in the mail but it was too big for me. Had to take it to the tailor to get it fitted. But overall, lovely pattern and material."
3.0,"The necklace is beautiful, but it arrived broken. Before shipping I think that it should have been inspected. Now I have to go and purchase a jewelry kit to repair it. More money to spend."
3.0,Broke before my son could hand them out as valentines treats for his class.
3.0,"With these shorts on you can clearly see my package.  I really like the shorts, but the fit on the front is very tight."
3.0,My mini is in 10-12 pants from Cat n Jack (Target) leggings.  these fit my child.  but were tight.  No larger size is available.<br />Nice feel and pretty material. Wish there was a larger size.
3.0,"I’m 5 ft 9 in, 175 lbs.....it wasn’t long enough for me."
3.0,I really do like the colors and style but it snags very easily and I could wear it a few times after finding a few snags
3.0,"I isually wear  size 14 or 16., I ordered 16 and they are too tight."
3.0,When I received the sunglasses the case was destroyed. Dissappointed that my case was messed up but the sunglasses overall were fine and fit perfectly.
3.0,"These slippers are great for old folks who can't seem to keep their aged feet planted firmly upon smooth floor surfaces.  The heavy rubber bottoms are superior to the tiny rubber friction bumps/strips stuck onto sock type products.  Unfortunately, the elastic collar that helps keep the slippers' stretchy upper body in place is only about 1/8&#34; thick and has a defined limitation to its maximum stretch.  While this does keep the slippers secure, the tightness of the elastic is excessive, and it will bite into the flesh of old folks who may have delicate, thin, or edema-ridden, or diabetically damaged foot skin.  To avoid such injury over prolonged wear, say over a couple hours of use, consider using an inner cotton sock before applying these slippers, or cut a pressure-relief notch into the front of the elastic rubber band section.  The maker could have used a gentler, wider elastic band of about half-inch width and way less tension, or limited the elastic to only about three-quarters of the circumference of the slippers.<br /><br />Since the bottoms are a thick pad of rubber with a distinct left and right mating, they are perfect for transferring a senior citizen from home to the doctor's office, when walking on public sidewalks may be a factor.  It's a much better solution than anti-slip socks, assuming your senior citizen cannot wear normal footwear, for whatever reason.  The rubber sole has SO MUCH traction, in fact, you must be aware of sticky glossy floor surfaces and carpets, to ensure that the wearer does not catch a foot during a clumsy stride and do a face plant because their dragging foot got stuck on the floor!"
3.0,"Super cute, should of went a size up"
3.0,"Leotard is very pretty, however it’s very thin. Far thinner then any other gk leotard."
3.0,"Runs small, you should size up. The padding is almost like a push up bra."
3.0,"They’re very lightweight and don’t have a lot of support. I don’t see how they would help keep you warm. However, if you’re looking for something comfortable to wear around the house, then definitely worth the money. A little short for me, but I’m 5’9” and used to leggings being too short."
3.0,I have to keep sewing it because they are WAY to big.
3.0,This did not look as pretty in person as it did in the picture
3.0,"I wished that the face was larger, but good watch so far"
3.0,"The only good side to these products are the polishes. The shoe brushes constantly loose their hair unlike the kiwi brushes. Other than that it does a good job. The foot rest is kind of loose after you screw it to the box, it won't stay firm after you screw the screws tightly, I think it would be better to nail them to have a firm foot rest (personally). Other than that it gets your shoes polished but kind of pricey in my opinion."
3.0,"The shoes aren’t as breathable as I was hoping. They started falling apart after 3 weeks. My son is still wearing them when we go fishing or in the garden. A bit disappointed, but didn’t really expect much for the price I paid. So fair enough. They are really cute and comfortable. Quality could be better, but oh well.."
3.0,Broke after a few wears. looks great though!
3.0,It's cheap and best.we wore during our flight to protect ourselves from covid 19.
3.0,"Bought an L, im usually a size 8, but this was too small for my hips! I guess because its asian. Looks pretty though! Hopefully an XL would fit  me."
3.0,"Wish it was a beanie, not an open top."
3.0,It is well made and comfortable.  However it appears to run a bit on the large side.  I measured myself based on the sizing as the listing showed.  But even in the smallest fitting it is still to large to do me any good.
3.0,Nice bracelet but fits tight when trying to put it on your hand. It feels as if it is sized for a child.
3.0,It really is a beautiful cut and nicely made. I am a very busty girl so the arm holes were to tight when I lifted my arms.. so I gave to my co worker... she loved it... That is the down fall of big chested people I don't fit into most sized things .
3.0,great gift but it does turn skin green and the finish is a little bubbly looking
3.0,the threading started coming undone after the second time wearing it.
3.0,"Fits as expected. Thought I was getting a paler green, but its very Christmas green...not quite as pictured. The picture of Will Ferrell is very crisp and good quality."
3.0,I love this except after a week or so the velcro ovals started coming off.  I glued the ed m back with fabric glue and I was back in business.
3.0,This has no padding? Wtf
3.0,"This is a strange top, overall it fits weird.  It is a tad short especially if you are busty, like the length just isn't there, you have to wear something underneath.  It is an over the head kind of top with how you have to put it on, there aren't any functional buttons or even side zippers so it isn't a tight fit.  Also, it is more of a long sleeve top than 3/4 length as depicted with close-buttons on the shirt arms.  It is a cute top I guess, I won't wear it often but its not bad."
3.0,I love this dress but it was a bit smaller than expected to I won't be wearing it again. I had to pull it down all night!
3.0,"They fell apart after a month,"
3.0,Material is very thin but will serve well as a bathing suit cover up.
3.0,"I am 5.4 , 190lb I ordered the navy blue and Large size. Then on a second thought I wanted to change it to XL because I thought it would be a lot sung. Thank goodness it's been shipped so I couldn't change it. So, the dress arrived super quick and I wore it for a test. It fits beautifully and gives a girly look. However, I had to iron it because it came out very rumpled. I have three reasons for giving this dress 3 stars. first, the skirt material quality wasn't as I expected n the length was just a little below my knee. I expected  a good soft material and for it to drop well below my knee since I am average height. Also the fact that its not machine washable. Overall, it is a chickly dress. Just stay true your size."
3.0,"Some Stones are loose, afraid of them falling out of the studs. Other than that good deal"
3.0,This is pretty but very small. I would say that it would be nice for a small person or child. If you are a larger person I wouldn't recommend this piece. Unless you like smaller jewelry.
3.0,"So the pink doesn’t match the pink on the pic, it is darker than I thought, quality seems like pretty good, just the color is emmmm....."
3.0,Too short for me .. but very nice fit and soft.
3.0,"The lenses are not purple as pictured. Was counting on that for the purpose of a costume, but if you dont mind plain black lenses, then 5 stars."
3.0,It is very cute however it feels HUGE in your mouth if you are not used to its size.
3.0,"Very small, definitely not a statement piece"
3.0,Should have been a bit bigger.
3.0,uncomfortable to wear
3.0,"Buy bigger than you normally wear, soft"
3.0,Not a bad night shirt just wanted a different look than it did on a thicker person.
3.0,"They are ok, but they don't fix all lockets."
3.0,Usually wear a medium in dresses. I ordered a large but it was still too small. Returning and getting an XL
3.0,Funding that mine don’t last more than 6 months
3.0,The straps frayed after only a few months of owning it. It's a beautiful dress but I have to cover the straps :/
3.0,"Ehh, get what you pay for, not the best material, looks like it will fray easily."
3.0,Wished it was a bit longer
3.0,It fits. Haven't heard any compliment s yet. But we'll made
3.0,"I really love the dress, but when I tried it on was so big on me. So big can not see the corset part in back. Well after examining it and looking at my ordered I had noticed it was the wrong size I got and it was ivory not white."
3.0,This top fits a little too large...so it u like ur top fitted buy a  size down
3.0,"I bought 3 different patterns. The prints a great and I initially love the fact that they stretch. However, after wearing them at Disney World for a week and putting our trading pins on them, I have discovered some problems. First, the pins will leave obvious holes in the lanyard. Second, the part of the lanyard touching the back of our necks ended up stretched out and warped. This could be due to sunscreen and/or just being stretched out often. I just don’t see these lasting when used in the parks."
3.0,"I was not able to carry it on,I have to check it in,it didn't fit the carry on ."
3.0,Loved this hat very warm and cozy for the winter! We very much liked it sad to have to return it but it runs very small so remember that in ordering. Such a shame it's so warm we loved it!
3.0,Not for small frame.  Cute and seems ok made.  Gave it to the neighbor girl.
3.0,I like the dress and the fabrics nice not thin! I would of givin it 5 stars but the width of the upper arms runs small... but other than that the dress is great!
3.0,"Cute, but runs very big!! I ordered a small, I’m typically a small and this shirt fits me like a large."
3.0,"I was disappointed but I have to say, I don't know much about the power ratios. It as not strong enough for looking at and for markings on old and fine jewelry. it is great for my grandchildren to play with."
3.0,Good but medium is like Large
3.0,"When they first came in they fit pretty okay, just a bit tight but after a couple of washes they really shrunk. The waistband digs into my waist and they're pretty uncomfortable to sleep and move around in. I'm a medium when I wear leggings and spandex but I should've gotten the large. Definitely size up when ordering and expect them to shrink in the wash. Other than that they're a pretty good quality and they haven't stretched out yet."
3.0,All the other colors where fine but the red one I wanted listed was misprinted as you can see the logo isn't all there.🤔
3.0,"This dress looks liked the photo. It needs a good cleaning because it smells funky and has a lot of static cling between the lace and the slip. The size chart says the XL is a 16-18. The bag lists it more accurately as 10-12. That’s a pretty big difference. Nevertheless, I think this is a good find! Like I said, it looks like the photo. It’s not expensive. It’s pretty. Just order a size up."
3.0,I was happy it's actual metal and to get these on but soon discovered that a few of the uh gems arrived busted off like the one shown in the photo.
3.0,The overall fit was good. The arm section was really tight. I have not work yet but will work on the arms to get there!!! Look and design was exact.
3.0,Not as expected. Runs too big
3.0,"The material is too sheer for me. I do not feel comfortable wearing it as a poncho blouse or as a coverup since it does not really cover much. There are open cuts in the arms and slits in the front and back. The fit is unflattering makes me look big. You will definitely be drawing attention to yourself with this piece because of the cuts and graphic print.<br /><br />This on the other hand is more appropriate for me to wear as a scarf, very light summery and the baby blue and magenta floral looks great around my neck.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount price in exchange for my honest unbiased review."
3.0,"CUTE! -- but the material is a lot thinner than I expected.  What's great is when I pulled it out, my daughter knew exactly who I was going to be for Halloween."
3.0,"Overall the shirt is pretty cute, I just don’t like how deep the V is…it’s very revealing and as a gal with a big chest I don’t need a V that deep. The top is pretty form fitting and almost spandexy…so keep that in mind."
3.0,"The necklace does not look too cheap but definitely not worth what I paid.  It does, however, look similar to the one in Casino Royale and perfect as a Halloween costume."
3.0,Got a newborn and it was definitely WAY bigger then an average new born.
3.0,"I do love this shirt, but as a night shirt.  It is very big/loose and the front is not fitted at all.  Even tried to use it as a gym shirt but it was just too big/baggie and to much hassle trying to constantly adjust.<br />Also, it is extremely sheer."
3.0,"With all the good qualities about this outfit, I still give it 3 ⭐️‘S because the skirt materials was very thin leaving my ass imperfections exposed. I passed it on. If you have a nice butt don’t buy. Does nothing for big booty women."
3.0,"Very cute suit, but I am a 38DDD and the size I purchased was recommended for my bust size. Way to small for the girls. If you are smaller in the chest area, I would recommend, but not for big busts."
3.0,"Runs very small, weird shape cups , to pointy"
3.0,I should have ordered an large the only problem I had with these shorts is they rise up between your legs when you're walking.
3.0,"My now wife is a woman that loves presentation and thoughtfulness. She always puts a lot of details into the things she does. When I popped the question I wanted it to be special and memorable. This LED ring box gave the ring that extra flare I was looking for. She loved the ring box as well the ring. She loved how the LED light makes the ring gleam and glisten. This is better than the cheap original ring box the ring came with. Overall it’s just nicer and a very good cool idea. It made the proposal just a bit more special. Sadly after a few months the ring box broke off on the hinge, and the switch that turned off the LED was out of alignment and thus keeping the LED on when not in use. My wife said it just broke off without even being forceful. It was nice while it lasted. I recommend spending a little more on a higher quality box. You get what you pay for, thankfully it wasn’t much."
3.0,Fits alil big on top but that can be easily fixed.<br /><br />I did expect for the Plum lace dress to be a darker Purple color rather than a Magenta color but for the price i paid i'm going to keep it reguardless.  Just an all around great dress for many different occasions.
3.0,"Muy lindo el diseño, pero la tela del cubre bocas  es muy fina y tiene poca protección. Pero aún así me encanta el match del cubre bocas  con el pañuelo para la mascota o para el cabello."
3.0,"Pants are made very well but they are not made for ""curvy"" women. :("
3.0,"Very cute, but way too short for me. I’m 5’8 and it was well above my ankles."
3.0,"Ordered xl, and it was like I was wearing a skirt, down to my knees."
3.0,A little smaller than I had thought they would be and they are a little crooked- bent funny or something. Pay for what you get I suppose.
3.0,We needed to look up the connection instructions online. They should come with the hat. They fit my boys (adult small helmet size) ok but the speakers are a little hard against the ears.
3.0,one shoe squeaks when walking
3.0,"I really wanted to give this item a perfect score because it is BEAUTIFUL and incredibly well crafted.  Truly beautiful, color and construction.  That said, I ordered an XL because I have an abundance of overhead baggage, if you get my drift.  I am 5'4"" and a 38DD, so.... This garment fit my husband, who is just shy of 6' and weighs 220.  If I knew how to adjust for size, I would absolutely order it again because it is the prettiest and best ski suit I have ever seen and I am an avid skier."
3.0,They are not knee high.
3.0,"I love the idea of this bag, but unfortunately, there is a built in laptop sleeve that is limiting.  It did not fit my new larger screen laptop that work recently upgraded me to.  If you have the full keyboard with number pad, this will likely not work for you."
3.0,"I purchased this bag for an upcoming adventure to Costa Rica. The size is perfect and the bag itself is very lightweight. I used it for several days and received many compliments. The design of the bag is great for organization with all its compartments. Unfortunately,I don't think I will be taking this purse with me on my trip...The zippers are cheap and make it difficult to access your stuff. After fighting with the zippers for a several days I switched back to my old crossbody."
3.0,"I was excited to order this because I was needing an outfit for working out in outside in the heat. However, I won't be able to use this as that because it is too small. It does say one size fits all and it states that is made in USA but I highly doubt it can be listed as a one size fits all. Most American women would not fit into this and if it is marketed as a one size fits all it needs to be made in such a way that it at least fits a size 9 comfortably. I double checked the measurements stated that it would fit before ordering and it does not match up to those measurements.<br />The material of the top and shorts is a very comfy stretch type material similar to stretch underwear type boy shorts. The top is very small and since I am a 36 D it really doesn't cover much. I am 5'9 and am an athletic size 9 and the bottoms are very small. I would say that this should be more geared towards females that are no larger than a size 5 in pants and have a smaller circumference in bust (32 maybe 34). I work out a lot and this just made me feel like crap in like a fat guy in a little coat type way. I was so hoping to be able to wear this because it is extremely cute and feels like it would be very easy to work out in.<br />I am still rating it 3 stars because it is of good quality material if worn by the proper sized person and I would recommend it for females who range in the thin sizes of 0-5.<br />The water bottle in the pictures is a 16oz water bottle to show an estimated measure of size<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion and review. I shop frequently on Amazon and rely on other reviews to help me make my purchases and as such I try to leave detailed and honest reviews based on my experience alone."
3.0,Material around the waist is not very stretchy which makes taking the shirt off a bit of a battle every time for people with big arms and wide shoulders.
3.0,"quality not the same as original obag handles, fraying etc, quick return"
3.0,"A former reviewer talks about it not being cotton. The description seems to be fixed,. But, I am a big and tall guy and ordered XXXXL to have extra length and looseness, and they mistakenly have that size turn into an XXXL (which is what I got). I confirmed it wasn't my fault by adding an XXXXL to my cart and once it was in the cart, it became XXXL (which isn't even an option to order on the color), This needs to be fixed. I might keep this as it fits (but a bit snugger than it might should be) and the length is nowhere near long enough, but I wasn't looking for a gown like this, but a longer shirt that won't ride up when I toss and turn. So, this still might fit the bill. The material seems to be nice, and it looks okay."
3.0,"These sunglasses are ptetty cute and seem quite durable. However, they were a little small looking on my 9 year old. The sides actually pushed out a little when they were on her. Going to return and try something  different."
3.0,I purchased this product and broke it the first time that I used it. I still use it but without half of the end that grabs the waist band. I would not buy this product again....
3.0,Somewhat taller than its appear in the photo
3.0,"I'm 5' 7"" 110 lbs. These are entirely too big for me and I ordered a small. XS is needed."
3.0,I got the right size for me. It is ok. But the picture shows a great soft fabric but the quality is not quite as the picture. I will keep it. It’s got a nice design to it.
3.0,"Lovely color but didn’t fit me right.  At 5’3, it was too long.  The top part was slightly small so didn’t follow the shape of my curves.  It would probably fit size B or small C cup better.  If I had enough time before my event I would have had it altered as I really liked the color and how it looked otherwise."
3.0,I wanted to love this but boy does Amazon want their girls padded up or what! Fellas (who clearly designed this) ... maybe try a removable insert for those who aren't quite so cleave-happy?
3.0,"Doesn’t fit face well at all because of the shape of mask, only reason I gave it 3 stars is scene on it."
3.0,"All fell apart however, they were my favorite while I had them."
3.0,"Arrived one week before scheduled. Small cut. I wear a large, bought an xl, but it fits like a medium."
3.0,Wearable but nothing special.
3.0,"These are comfortable, thick, and exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately, after the first wear the fabric balled up between the thighs. They wash well and the color hasn’t faded."
3.0,Fits well looks good but has strong smell<br />Leather to moldy<br />Bought 2 same smell
3.0,"Good bag. It's big ish keeps items cold, can fill up quickly,  all in all for the money good seal"
3.0,"You need to be tall and thin to make this dress look good.  Nice quality, though."
3.0,I normally wear med large the xlarge was too small.....need a2xl to make it work...do they come that big
3.0,"I ordered the blue dress with the sleeves. I'll say the dress fit well, but I was unaware that it was a two piece dress. The skirt is see through, and it comes with a matching colored set of briefs. While the dress was great, the briefs did not fit well. There was a gap between where the briefs ended and the waistband of the dress--which showed a weird amount of tummy skin. I am returning it for this reason. You could probably scout some boyshorts or some alternative bottoms if you really loved the look of the dress, but I kind of looked like a Little House on the Prairie character with those sleeves."
3.0,"The fit and style are fine. It is soft. However I live in a hot and humid place (South Carolina) and I need natural fabrics in the summer. I'm not bothering to send it back, since it was very inexpensive, but be aware that it is NOT cotton rich, in spite of what they claim. Feels like nylon or something similar. Just be aware."
3.0,It is hard to see out of
3.0,"I guess the fact that they were coiled up made me think these we're a bit bigger. They are very thin and plastic.  I use them with dresses that don't have waists, and it doesn't look substantial at all."
3.0,"They are really cute but they're weighted funny so the large star either dangles below your ear or falls away from the ear. I would not purchase again, even though I have special backs to hold earrings like this in place. Just couldn't make it work right."
3.0,Haven't worn the dress.  I think I need to get a bigger size or lose the weight.  feels and looks fine.  will not return it.
3.0,Dress material is too warm.
3.0,This dress is very short-waisted.
3.0,"I'm only 5'2"" and this shirt rides up a little bit at the abdomen. Also the straps are kinda weird, they curve in at the armpit area, exactly where the bra strap sits? so it exposes the bra strap. I bought this for work and thats a no no for me. I'm about 160 pounds with a 36DD and ordered a large. I could have ordered an XL, but i really hate baggy clothes, so I would have probably returned it had I gone bigger."
3.0,"Nice, however they are a little to small to wear on the lower ear. They are perfect for the top hole in ear or for a small child. Otherwise nice buy."
3.0,"If you are flat and no curves this dress will be fine. However if you are thick with hips and thighs, YOU WILL BE DISSAPOINTED. Sent it back"
3.0,It was either too small or my body just isn't right for wrap dresses. The top just looked odd and too big. The print was super cute though.
3.0,used them in gym and they worked great.
3.0,"I bought two, one came the color that I expected, but the second one didn't. I thought I was getting a bloody, kind of wine color but I got a plain red and I already had a red blouse, same stile."
3.0,Very nice shirt but they sent the wrong Size so I sent it back
3.0,Meh... seemed to run a big and more frumpy then I wantes
3.0,Junk sizing. Size up by 2!
3.0,"The shirt itself is not the softest, but it is very comfortable and fits as expected. Tt is not baby doll cut, which was perfect for me, but it is definitely still cut for women. That being said, the 3 stars are due to the design on the shirt. The silk screening is not quite thick enough, as there is a bit of bleeding of the navy blue through the white silk-screening. Overall, however, the shirt looks good, it just looks worn and not as new when you get it."
3.0,This robe is pretty but becomes very wrinkly when washed.
3.0,For the price these are pretty decent shoes. The ties constantly came off so I glued them. The soles are wearing down quicklt though so I would not repurchase.
3.0,"This is a very nice looking and well made hat, but as several reviewers stated, it does fit small. I am returning it for this reason. I have an average sized head so I thought it might fit. However, I also purchased the Coolibar Marina sun hat and like its fit much better. I will review it separately."
3.0,"The picture and the actual pendant look different. The picture has more details in the snowflake, but the actual pendant is more solid. It is pretty, but not as pretty as the picture. The gem in the middle is a cloudy whitish stone. It's okay, not the &#34;wow&#34; that I was expecting. This was provided at a discount for an honest review."
3.0,It does tarnish fast
3.0,I really like it .. but not quite  what I expected it to be.
3.0,Cheap quality. Right in the chest but very big everywhere else. Would not purchase again
3.0,It was very hard to change the size and the tool to do so was constantly bending I was really afraid it would break. We changed the size eventually but it took man power.
3.0,Mario is my son's favorite character. So he was excited to open up his presents on Christmas and see Super Mario pajamas inside.
3.0,Runs small should have gotten one size up.
3.0,While trying on this shoe I almost fell because the heel was not sturdy at all. Had to return them. Over all design of the shoe is very sexy though. i would recommend someone for someone petite.
3.0,"Comfy. Good fit. I have short arms and the arm length is fine. My only complaint is a small hole in a seam in the shoulder, but I can sew that."
3.0,A lil to small give me blisters.  They are really cute and easy to walk in. Just a Lil to tight.
3.0,The waist is slouchy and the buttons are not stitched on well
3.0,These are very nice shirts but way too small for my husband.  He normally wears an extra large.  I gave them to my son who wears a medium and they are a little big but kept them.  He is hoping to grow into them as he works out regularly.
3.0,"The top of dress did not fall off shoulder however, am able to wear the dress as a maxi dress just want have that look that is posted on-line."
3.0,The sleeves are super tight and make them look buff. Fits more like a youth large than an XL
3.0,"I ordered the bag because the words were ""MUSIC IS MY BAG"" I received a bag with words instead ""MUSIC IS MY LIFE"" I kept the bag anyway because I love music & bags."
3.0,These gloves fit well but do not provide any type of support. I purchased to help with CT and they not only do not have the thickness to support but do not compress at all.  I wore these during the day for a week and while wearing them my pain was a little less noticeable. I would guess that is due to the copper only. My first purchase of this type of product so I am not certain what to actually expect.
3.0,"The swimsuit material feels strong, and I loved the fit in the lower half of the swimsuit. However, the suit had little support in the top portion and my straps are already fraying after a month of use."
3.0,Little too long and didn't look right on me
3.0,I love these But I got a size XL and I wear a Large. I should have gone up to XXL
3.0,Adjustable straps were uncomfortable- returned.
3.0,See through and run big.
3.0,"Cute earring, but nothing special. It's delicate and my daughter worries that the ear cuff will break in half if she tries to adjust it too much. Other than that, she loves it."
3.0,"Very cute and a little big for my 6 month old, but I'm glad she can grow into them. Out of the 5 headbands only 3 actually look good. The other two look like they weren't glued right. But good purchase for the price."
3.0,Broke in a year so you get what you paid for!
3.0,It does NOT look as shinny in person. Cheaply made. I did not expect bling for the price...Just cute.
3.0,Well I didn't expect the shoulder to be as broad as mine is. The material is also heavy but the color is as expected.
3.0,"You get what you pay for...I'm learning this about purchasing products on-line!  These are made of a plastic-type product and are an odd size.  I'm going to use them for international travel, just to hold a couple cards and keep them in my front pocket.  They don't appear that they would last with everyday use and don't appear to be of high quality."
3.0,"Extremely thin material. I understand why it’s quick drying. They are so thin, it left nothing to the imagination,if you catch my drift."
3.0,The mask was too small and hurt my nose. I gave them to my sons and they did not care for them either<br />They do look cool but very uncomfortable.
3.0,"It’s ok. The material is thin. If you are busty size up. Definitely longer. Its cute, but wouldn’t reorder."
3.0,They are thick and warm but the toe area fell apart after the first wear. Gonna have to sew em back up.
3.0,Broke in very short space of time. Had to return
3.0,"It's nice.  Good quality.  But it's really a heavy sweatshirt, bulky and not easy off and on.  Color is beautiful.  It looks just like the picture.  But that cape-like effect is weird.  I wish it were just a plain hoodie instead.  I've only worn mine once.  Not sure when I will ever wear it again."
3.0,Looks good but will definitely not hold up to rough wear.
3.0,Top was very short and thinner than expected.  I’d imagine after one wash it would fit a toddler
3.0,"This skirt is well made and the pattern is very cute. However,  I found that there is just too much fabric making the skirt extremely  full."
3.0,"Too small for a large, but should be disappointed for the price."
3.0,The sizing is off so make sure you order larger than you normally would. Mine was missing 2 buttons but I bought some from my local fabric store and added new buttons to replace the ones that were on there originally.
3.0,"Es lindo, pero se pone feo muy rápido"
3.0,"It's a very pretty band and durable. The colors are printed sharp and bright on the silicone and are very pretty. I gave it 5 stars because it's great but personally, not my favorite band. I only wear it on the third largest hole and there's barely 1/2"" of excess band to tuck under which makes it more secure. It also feels really gross when sweaty so I'll stick to the thinner bands. I'm actually changing my stars to 3 now that I think about it because it really needs to be longer to accommodate the largest holes."
3.0,"This is an okay wallet. The smell is quite strong, even after a few months, so be warned. It's bearable to me, but I could see why some would want to return it because of the smell. I can fit a good amount of stuff in this wallet though. It serves it's purpose, and seems sturdy enough."
3.0,Not a true xl..but love how it feels..pretty
3.0,Not big enough for a fat face with a beard
3.0,"And I mean ""worn"", like to a function then returned as if it were not.<br />I love this jumpsuit and I am not returning it. Had I found this garment in a consignment or thrift shop for $45 with the weary-lookin tag still attached but with frayed, haggard straps, I would snatch it up right away. The price on the tag is $388, and I would have paid that much for it - if it were in pristine condition.<br />The straps explain the deeply discounted price, but I wish the seller would have stated up front what was wrong with this garment.<br />Five stars foe the jumpsuit-its gorgeous and fits perfectly! The fact that it's a thrift store garment? 🥴"
3.0,"Not very durable, very flimsy. Be careful with these glasses as they bend easily, but they're very cute and I get lots of compliments every time I wear them!"
3.0,"Very cute! But the material on top of the toe didn’t take long before it started peeling off. The shoestring started shredding, too."
3.0,Too round. Looks a little like a marble.
3.0,Strange fit by the sleeves.  Nice pattern and material.
3.0,Fit was fine and they are comfortable but do not look like the picture at all.
3.0,Material is great. But Ordered for average 10yr old. Men’s small and it was way too small.
3.0,Nice fit but the bottoms are see through!!
3.0,"When I washed it , it shrank!!"
3.0,"These shoes are huge!!! I got 6-12 month size for my 8 month old who usually wears things about normal for her age. These shoes are adorable but way too big for her, they may fit closer to 18months."
3.0,"[[ASIN:B01FFARCVE Bracelet | Anchor Armband Black | Wristband | Accessory Arm Band | Bracelet for Men and Women]]<br /><br />The bracelet is made with black barrel rope design, it does give a little stretch. I have a small wrists and I could not get it to fit. It might be possible to use as a ankle bracelet for a lady who has a small ankle. I don't know if it is even possible for a lady with small wrist to accomplish getting to use it. I can only give you this review as to it does not fit. Maybe a a small kid would be able to wear it. the design and the hook are very nice looking<br /><br />Disclosure: This product was received at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased, review.

3.0,Definitely get a size or two up from what you are originally
3.0,These goggles were great for about 5 trips to the pool until they broke. Plastic snapped off and no longer close. It’s a shame as my toddler did like having the closing in back. Although to last only 5 times makes them not worth anything.<br /><br />As an update the company did send me another pair free of charge. We have yet to use it yet but will report back after some use to share if the new pair is better
3.0,It fits snug so I'm not 100% satisfied with this shirt
3.0,They fix my husband fine. But big for me
3.0,"Runs small, ordered 2sizes up .good quality dress"
3.0,"Cute, just wish I was able to push the buttons"
3.0,Great size and look for your a weekend bag but I still have not been able to get rid of that plastic / chemical smell. I have tried airing it out both inside and outdoors but no luck.
3.0,"The pendant with the slide-away magnifying glass is beautiful and I love it. The chain, however, is flimsy and cheap and broke on the first day I wore it. I do have to say that the four year old children that I teach in Sunday School loved it and were enamored with it and they constantly held it and pulled on it somewhat and that may have contributed to it breaking. But I think it would have broken eventually anyway as it is a cheap chain. I love the pendant so I am going to just purchase a new chain for it. If the chain was better quality I'd give it 5 stars. I was hesitant to buy it as the price was so cheap, so you get what you pay for. I haven't had it long, so I'll see how the pendant holds up in the long haul."
3.0,5 stars for appearance.<br />3 stars overall due to the fact that only one cufflink actually showed movement and the other does not. Overall very nice. My husband loved them.
3.0,"These pads help keep my glasses on, but they slip around and leave  sticky substance o my glasses.  They are just so-so."
3.0,"This is a lovely dress, but it was made to fit someone with a longer torso. Will have to have it altered. Luckily, I'm married to a Tailor, I can't be bothered returning it. I'm sure it will look awesome once it fits."
3.0,Very cute but really thin. Definitely is a statement piece and not a real jacket. It was a bit tight on my back
3.0,It's pretty and was a little smaller but it's okay
3.0,"Great shirt, my son wears them to work out at Cross Fit"
3.0,These earrings are very pretty and nice quality so overall im pleased with the purchase.  The only thing I would point out is the actual earring post  is quite thick. The thickest I've ever seen.  I as adult with bigger ears can were them fine but I don't think they would  be great for younger girls.
3.0,Fits great until you try to move & embarrass yourself with a nip slip. Gorgeous color- wish the top was an inch longer to avoid nip slip.
3.0,"I was very dissapointed that the front zipper was not on my purse.  I know the new model does not feature a zipper on the front pocket, but since I the picture on Amazon shows the zipper, I thought I was purchasing the old model.  I believe that is false advertising!  I will keep the purse because it is so functional.  But the purse is much better looking with the front zipper."
3.0,Did the job for a Christmas gift to my boss but would NOT buy again! It was cheap and almost tacky looking.
3.0,The back of the shoe was broke in the heel.
3.0,"Nice, swimsuit the smallest size was still to big. Would've kept it if it fit of coarse but I am in the process of returning it"
3.0,"There was only one button hole out of four buttons, had to make my own holes for the other three. Material is thin, but looks cute."
3.0,"Well made, but slim fit, except around the waist- I ordered the large size and they fit very well (I'm 35/30). Only real complaint is the front pockets; they are small, not deep enough, and because of the inner material tend to ride up and not close/sit properly. I plan to have them sewn closed and simply not use them. Side and rear cargo pockets are not overly large and snaps close well. Seat and knee reinforcements are ok. Knee protectors are adequate, hip pads are simply thin, flat foam; I won't be using either provided. Overall these seem like a nice option for casual riding, time will tell."
3.0,"I bought this skirt because I have one just like it that I love so much I wanted another one in a different color. This one looks like it had lots of bright colors in particularly bright blue which I really need.<br />Unfortunately, what I received was exactly the same as the one I own with Navy and deep, unsaturated colors.<br />Even more unfortunate is that Amazon no longer offers free exchanges unless you drive the car to a UPS site.<br />I practically never leave my house and there is no drop off site in route to any place I do go when I do get out.<br />I order enough from Amazon that I should be able to schedule free pick up for my next delivery.<br />Amazon wants me to pay almost as much to pick up the item as I paid for it.<br />Not happy. I don't exchange much, but I have always purchased things at Amazon knowing that exchanges and returns are free: hassle-free and cost free."
3.0,I was hoping it would be a little bigger but as I am going to be losing some pounds I don't want to send it back
3.0,"Overall a good find . The only thing is that the color does not match what is advertised, instead of a dark brown that is shown she got a lighter color."
3.0,"These earrings have very short posts, meant for children's slender earlobes, not adults' pudgy ones.  The backs screw on and completely cover the posts, such as you would wish for a child or baby with pierced ears.  The quality is fine, but buyer beware."
3.0,"I usually fit large, but the waist was super tight and made it a little uncomfortable and hard to breathe. The leg part was a good fit though. Maybe the pants are telling need that I need to lose more weight...? lol"
3.0,I just got mine today. I got the rainbow ones. They aren't that bad to be honest. They're about an 18 gauge. They came right on time. 😊
3.0,"Looks nice and good quality but this hat is not as warm as you might hope<br /><br />Needs to be a little thicker to keep cold winds out - when it gets below 30 degrees, it’s chilly"
3.0,"Beautiful lace details on top. A tiny bit short for my comfort, but not too bad.  What concerns me most is the propensity for static cling! I will be generously spraying with Static Guard on the day I need to wear it. If it does not work, it will have to be returned. The lining and dress are clung together and cling to my legs as soon as I walk. That's such a shame because it could be a great LBD to wear to many events!"
3.0,"ordered silver and antique brass, got silver and gold...too much trouble to return, so gave the gold one away...liked the silver one but would not order again as I would not be sure that I received the correct item."
3.0,"Great and cute product. But after a few days of wearing it, nothing aggressive, my daughter was coming out of a car and the flip flop top cane out of its hole. So not a great quality."
3.0,I will be buying another one that is easier to use. It is odd that it is difficult to put on or take off without removing one of the connectors from the arm of the glasses. Not enough room to put over one's head easily and then tighten and loosen for some odd reason.
3.0,Was ok.  Doesn't wash well.  I wouldn't buy again.
3.0,Really long. I thought it would be cute and short like the pic but much longer. Also our your size. Im 5'7&#34; 145lbs and I have to exchange it for a smaller size.
3.0,"Cute, but it's pretty small..I'm pretty small too, but we're talking minimal coverage. If you're large on top, I would recommend against it. Reminds of a hotpad. Not sure whether I'll wear it or not."
3.0,Nu me gusto  ella. No quedo con  esparaba  rentuns delvuerver
3.0,"This item is much more flattering on the body than the hanger. The sleeves are NOT stretchy and are very tight! I do have fatty arms, so I’d almost size up if you have bigger arms. This fabric is not high end, so not sure why someone was raving about that. It’s literally a polyester that someone almost just took scissors to cut the scallop shape. I’m only wearing this once for a wedding and it’ll serve its purpose for that. It does look nice on! I cut the belt loops because it looked awful. It looks fine and stays with the belt just tied around your waist. I’m pregnant and trying to hide it, so this dress in black works well for that. I’m pairing this with an ankle boot. I’d say it’s cute, but I can’t wear this again with the sleeves being so tight. I just don’t have time to return for a larger size."
3.0,The white dress is see-thru. Thin material.
3.0,"Watches. If you're in the market for a timepiece, there are quite a lot of brands to choose from and literally thousands of actual watches to sort through from a few pounds up to something slightly more expensive, let's say. To add to that burgeoning list is this ticker from a company called BesWlz.<br /><br />It's at the cheaper end of the market, so I wasn't expecting much, least of all something the size of a small dinner plate. Black and green, there's both analogue and digital readouts with the latter also showing day, date, stopwatch and alarm. That's all simple enough but what I've never understood is why these watches have flashing signs that seem to have no discernible function. This watch has three circular dials inside. One is an icon of a figure, which flashes when it stopwatch mode; another informs you whether the alarm is on and if the time is on 24hr mode (but you need a microscope to see it), whilst the third is the one that just flashes.<br /><br />The four function buttons are silver and not recessed like other watches from the brand, so those with larger hands won't have any difficulty in accessing them. The strap is unusual in that it is a double pin affair. Usually, it's single and small pointed but the ones here are in a fairly large 'H' shape with square ends and equally large square holes. It's also water resistant against splashes, etc. It's nothing exciting. It tells the time, which is all you need to know. The enclosed instruction sheet is easy to follow and it's cheap. It's marked as 5ATM, which is supposed to be suitable for swimming, white water rafting, non-snorkeling water related work, and fishing. Oh, and there's a backlight too. One for the kids.<br /><br />One thing that I found wrong and against the ethos of Amazon is the enclosed card. It offers a money off coupon if you give five star feedback. Okay, it might only be $1 but that isn't the point"
3.0,The package says new and improved. They're new. They suck. They feel like the crappy mass produced socks I no longer want to buy. And now I've paid a premium price for that experience. It sucks.
3.0,"Not what I expected, misread thought they were stride rite.  Lights are bright.  Cute shoes."
3.0,"I love the color of this dress, but it does fit a little awkwardly.  Bunches up around the behind."
3.0,"Gave the product a 3 because the size chart is not accurate. The product description is accurate, but this product sizes ran smaller than the average american size charts. I recommend moving a size up if you are purchase this product line."
3.0,Cheap hat not as shown
3.0,soft material not to this. Had to replace the stone that was in the button because it fell out. Runs big so I would suggest ordering a size down
3.0,"I bought these pants in black for a summer trip to Italy--I loved the style and the lightweight fabric (but I don't think it's linen as stated). The fit was great--I am normally anywhere from a 10 to a 14 in pants, typically around a 12, and the large fit perfectly. The waist has some elastic, which is great for pasta dinners. However, the fabric does reveal a not-perfectly-flat stomach, so keep that in mind. The sewing wasn't great, but about the quality one would expect for the price.<br /><br />I did not love the matte gold studs on the sides and tried to remove them, but it was impossible without damaging the fabric. Overall, these were great hot weather pants--light and cool with some style--but the crotch ripped after only a few wears. I sewed it up, but it ripped again so I had to throw them away. I did put these through a bit more wear and tear than most people probably would, as I am a pretty active traveler, but I would recommend handling them with care."
3.0,Already ripped
3.0,Cute dress but returned due to too much room at the hip area.
3.0,Tried to put in this jacket abs does not fit.  I bought a 3x and I wouldn’t even call it a 2x
3.0,It was nice material but did not like the style on me.
3.0,Very frustrating to put it on<br />I just ended up throwing it in the garbage
3.0,They were nice the fit is off you will need to size up I have to return mine for another size thin and light material so great for summer
3.0,It's a bit bigger than other chokers
3.0,Like the shirt but was disappointed to see the words “I smell children” were missing.
3.0,Small leaves jam the vacuum head easily. PITA
3.0,"Misleading = the center heart is 3 stones not 1 like shown......it is a pretty  ring,  nice price, fit to size, and well made but the heart is made up of  3 stones not one and that is not what is pictured here.  Pretty but a single stone would be nicer."
3.0,It is very comfortable. I would say that it is thinner and more see through than I had expected.
3.0,Not as compressed as I wanted.  They are comfy though.
3.0,"My BWH is 38(32G)-30-40 and the bottoms on the suit fit well, but there is no chance on Earth that the top will fit without alterations. The cups are already padded (and come with additional insertable padding) to be even shallower than their outward appearance would suggest. As-is, I can either wear the top to guarantee no slippage and get intense boobloaf and underboob, or I can wear the top at the base of my boobs and be eternally seconds away from a casual slip.<br /><br />I'm going to purchase red swim fabric to add material to the top of the cups and edit the halter straps (which -complicit with the tie band- will let heavy boobs stretch back for the hell from whence they came) to hopefully provide more support.<br /><br />That aside, the suit is cute though."
3.0,"Cute outfit, but top was too small. Had to give it away."
3.0,They feel like they are both the same foot.  No matter how I arrange them they just feel a little odd.
3.0,"It fits fine except the arm holes are kinda tight, not so tight that I wouldn’t wear it but just uncomfortable."
3.0,"These are nice now, but I can tell the fabric will pill and not last well."
3.0,"Purchased two. Design and materials are decent quality. Stitching is actually pretty bad though. Apparent lack of quality control. Also the fabric is on the heavier side- I wish they made a lighter, more breathable version with better material. Good enough for light training but I would certainly not recommend to friends or collegues."
3.0,"I absolutely love this dress.. Unfortunately I had to return it and go an altogether different route.  My husband and I are going on a cruise in April. I was planning to wear this  for formal night and pictures, (which also happens to be our 21st wedding Anniversary. ) The striped bust area of the dress was poorly laid out when it was sewn  onto the navy blue bodice/skirt. The stripes were crooked which gave the illusion that one of my breasts sagged lower than the other.  (See attached photo) This may not have been so noticeable on someone with a smaller bust but it's really hard to say for sure. I'm 5'9"" tall and I weigh 250 pounds. (Most of it is boob and midsection. I'm a 40 something year old with a mom bod, what can I say?!) I wear a 40I bra and a size 18W pants/dress. I take a 2X in tops to accommodate the girls. I purchased this dress in a 3X as per the size chart. The dress fit and had a little bit of stretch to it but I did not have a whole lot of wiggle room.  (The striped area is  made of a T-shirty type material and is a bit more forgiving than the bodice) I may have been able to go up a size depending on how much bigger a 4X actually is. I just didn't want to risk getting another defective dress and then run out of time to order another in it's place. Being a plus sized girl limits my options down to a few as it is and I've already purchased shoes, accessories, and a purse to rock the nautical theme. Even my husband's dress shirt has been coordinated to complete the look for our photoshoot. You win some and you Lose some. On a positive note, Amazon provided me with a free return shipping label and a full refund. I hope if nothing else, my lengthy review helps someone.else determine a proper fit. Thanks for reading!"
3.0,The blue is a pretty dusty blue as pictured. Love the tan stripes with it. Shirt is long and fits tighter than I like.
3.0,"A couple of these are really cute, but I think I’ll only be able to wear two out of the five this set comes with. A couple of the pairs were a bright yellow gold color and look cheap. Also, the pair with the hearts on them the post actually bent trying to close it and it doesn’t really click into anything, so I’m not sure how long some of these will last. I like that they were 14k gold plated at least, but not sure if they are worth purchasing."
3.0,"I loved this dress it fit great for someone who is curvy!! I received several compliments when I wore it!! However, the wine/red from the bottom half of dress bleed on to the white. 😕 #Disappointed"
3.0,"Love this brand in the full foot style, they fit perfectly. The toeless one however are severely coming unraveled. I personally bought another pair of the footed ones but will not purchase the toeless ones again."
3.0,"Ordered the grey- definitely more of an olive green. They look like good, thick tights though."
3.0,Love the glasses but the temples broke too easily.
3.0,It's ok...not for long torso
3.0,Its small and plastic. But good quality.
3.0,"In this case, &#34;assorted colors&#34; meant white, white and white. They ride quite a bit lower than the natural waist, so if you have anything other than a flat stomach, they are going to be large. Nice quality, though."
3.0,This was a nice hat. It was well made and cute. Unfortunately it was too small and I had to return it. Return was quick and easy.
3.0,Yes it’s very good
3.0,Had to send back runs SUPER small!<br />But it was very pretty
3.0,"I loved the look of this piece of jewelry and knew someone to whom it would compliment both in personality and her over the top style. It was meant to be her Christmas present!  I received the lower part of the order quite late, and I sent an E-mail to express my angst and to encourage some further effort in securing the rest of this order. I am offered a re-fund. As kind as that solution sounds - I'd rather someone take the effort to research this order and secure the missing upper sections. Henceforth will I be your loyal, happy buyer - replacing this feeling of  disenchantment currently felt???"
3.0,Nice shirt overall. But you can definitely tell it is a synthetic material. There is little stretch so size up. My go to brand is wrangler and these are much more stiff.
3.0,Great Watch! Is beautiful.
3.0,I don’t see that this worked
3.0,"This is cut very small, but nice light fabric. I gave to my daughter. she loves it"
3.0,I Do Like The Style Of Product
3.0,"Positive:<br />I love how vibrant the colors are. The product truly reflects what's shown in the picture. They're lightweight not too bulky, I think I'd be comfortable in them for an extended period of time. The elastic band is a bit stretchy so I think these leg warmers would be good for people with relatively average or wide calves. You can tell the fur is synthetic, it has a bit of a shine but it isn't shedding too badly. And lastly, shipping was super speedy!<br />Negative:<br />Before I could try them on I noticed a pretty large hole in one of the leg warmers. The elastic band is not connected to the fur nor the inside liner. I'm really bummed about that..."
3.0,After a while of the Velcro does not work
3.0,This is a well made robe.  The reasons I gave it only 3 stars are because it is large for the size selected and it's also rather heavy.
3.0,"This dress is so adorable! ! I wanted it to work so much, but it's very small in the bodice area. I ordered a size up but still too tight across the chest. Also too short from shoulder to waist :(. I'm a 34 D and usually a size small . The material and workmanship are excellent quality . But if you're a little busty or have a long torso this dress will nother fit you well."
3.0,It is a lot bigger then what it shows on the picture. I’m a female and it is more for a male. I thought it would of been thinner than what it actually is.
3.0,Ok a bit flimsy but has  lasted through 3 wearings and price was very inexspensive
3.0,"Very warm, just too big for me. (7 1/8 hat size) I'd like to see various sizes. Took a chance and overall it's a good product for the price."
3.0,As described.  Decent inexpensive sunglasses.
3.0,Cute dress very small. Order 2 sizes up. Also if you’re ddd don’t even think of it. Even the xxl didn’t fit my boobs
3.0,"I ordered this in purple.  The color is beautiful a true rich purple shade.  I had read other reviews indicating this ran small so while I am typically a size medium, I ordered an XL.  It fit well in the front, a little blousy but not too much, just perfect to cover a little belly if you have one.  However, the back has none of that so was pretty fitted in back so if you have a little &#34;spill over&#34; on top of your pants, it shows.  Also anything coming up around your bra in back shows.  While it's so pretty I think it would be better for someone without any extra &#34;fluff&#34; in the back area due to how thin the fabric in back is."
3.0,These were a little smaller than I had imagined. Otherwise nice.
3.0,"When I read about the product on web site, it was not clear that the umbrella is NOT the one-piece type that's been used for generations.  But I'm stuck now."
3.0,"I wanted to love this, but sizing is small - had to return.,"
3.0,"All of my clothes are M, but this M is too large. I should have bought an S."
3.0,I was definitely not expecting for this to be a crop top. It was nice and heavy material but very short!
3.0,Shirt had no shape. Returned.
3.0,"Had high hopes but nothing like my others. While it does smooth and pull in, it's a little uncomfortable. It also does absolutely nothing for the butt.. it actually smoothere's mine and pulled it in"
3.0,"There was a stone missing before I ever got it out of the plastic. It would cost as much to return or replace as it cost so I won't return it. That said, I bought it as inexpensive costume jewelry and will probably even still wear it, because it is quite pretty. I did expect that I would be able to wear it once without the stones falling out though, so that it why it gets only three stars. For the money, it is very pretty and was packaged well, in a box, the bracelet covered by foam sheet and the box in a plastic bag. The package wasn't damaged and the product appeared to be new so I can only assume the stone falling out is a matter of getting what you pay for."
3.0,Cute but super cheap material. But what do you expect
3.0,"It's ok ,, a lite leather jacket is what I was looking for. But it came with the zipper broken. No problem I purchased another zipper and fixed it myself.<br />What erks me is that the seller put a clamp where the zipper was broken."
3.0,Not bad for the price but all the functionality of the buttons don't work.. rose gold does look nice on the wrist with the black mesh band
3.0,The material is thin and silky. Very see through so make sure you have a long shirt to wear with it. They looked way cuter on the model. Not sure I'll be wearing them often. Meh.
3.0,"As others have said…. No stretch in the fabric, for me…. An XL was slightly too tight on a size 16 frame ( 5’9” 224 lb) . The length is lacking, this is not close to tunic length and although true to the pictures, the hood laces are inexplicably/unnecessarily long. Color was true. Unflattering pic gives you the idea.<br /><br />Sleeves are too short for my liking just makes it look like you’ve cut the sleeves off a hoodie."
3.0,"This is a cute little dress. The material is actually fairly heavy due to the sequins on the dress. The straps are tied so you can adjust it to where you want it to. The sequins are a beautiful navy blue. The dress is somewhat fitted but still loose enough to not cling to you. I am 5'7"" at about 200lbs and this fits well with some room to spare in a size L, so definitely a tad on the larger size.<br /><br />The dress is well made overall but fits. It will be perfect for some dinners out or other evening events where you need something to dress up for.<br /><br />I did really like the coloring and print on this dress. It does lack a little bit of definition and is a bit baggy on me though but overall it is pretty cute."
3.0,Nice but runs small. Returning
3.0,Not as large as promised.
3.0,"I love the color of this shirt and the fabric is soft and easy to manage but the model shows that the shirt is long enough to cover over her hips.  When I put on this shirt, it just hit my waist and was not long like the photo appears.  I kept the shirt because it's cute but it was not what I expected."
3.0,It's ok wish it is better looking
3.0,It is a nice costume especially the skirt but the glasses and earrings are very low quality. This whole set costs more than double what it's worth. For the price the bag and wig should be included
3.0,"I bought this for my boyfriend who is required to wear high vis and reflective clothing, and it came quickly and looked great. However, after only a few washes the reflective lines are fading."
3.0,Cute top but very small.
3.0,I bought this tie because they had a boys size tie that was listed as the same color and brand that I ordered as well. When I recieved all of the ties the men's tie was a different color than the boys ties. I was also suprised by the width of the tie. It was extremely wide and was not what I was looking for. Not a bad product just didn't work for me.
3.0,Two different colors but comfy
3.0,"Good quality product, but it doesn’t work well if you have big boobs. The strapless side spills over."
3.0,Quality. Runs very small. Ordered lb. Athe... seems like a very small. Disappointed!
3.0,"The glasses are fine for the price, but I do have to anchor them in my hair clips because they tend to slide down my nose and my ears don't hold them up."
3.0,"I was surprised by the size.  The pendant ball is a full one inch in diameter. I thought it would be the size of a marble.  Okay, but I would wear it more often if it were more dainty."
3.0,"I like that the boot cuffs have multiple colors. It's a great bargain for the price. I do NOT have large calves, but I found them to run small. They do not have a lot of stretch. They would be great for thinner people or younger women/ teens."
3.0,only comes with one tree. thus: :(
3.0,"5’10” / 150lbs / ordered a small in black<br /><br />This def runs big. I usually wear a large in dresses and ordered a small in this. The back is really open and cute, but the front sort of fits like a bag. I don’t think it wraps in the top in the right place for me and gave me a very boxy look. Also the slit is alllll the way up the front of the dress haha so if you’re not careful everything can hang out. Material is soft and seems to be well made, just a weird fit."
3.0,I ordered white & picture shows white but color I received is more like off white/almost cream.
3.0,The dress runs big for sure had to return
3.0,"I'm 5'3 135lbs 32D and between a small closer to a medium. I bought this in a small and it was very ill fitted on my body. Loose in areas it shouldn't be, the color and style was correct so I'll give it a few stars."
3.0,Begins on the smaller side and dramatically shrinks after wash (and no dry)
3.0,"It was little to big, I ordered small and its pretty long"
3.0,"While I am 3 starring this item, I do feel that it's better than that, just not as good as a 4 star, here's why.<br /><br />CONS:<br />To start, it's not fully metal and it's not stainless steel, which I was really hoping it would be. Also the band is not as lovely as it shows on the photoshopped image. It's actually not even that high quality. It's actually painted plastic with what feels like an aluminum shell and I question that as well. It's mostly just painted plastic. The only metal I can see on this is the screws to fasten it all together. It's a vast improvement over most I've seen out there but not worth the $20 price tag. I would of rather paid $10 at the most, say $7.99 like the one's sold by gamestop. I have 2 of those, the red and the black, and those are much higher quality and construction. They feel much more solid than this thing does.<br /><br />PROS:<br />On the flip side, it's got a nice look to it and matches, design wise, very well to the Apple iPod. It really does feel like they were designed for each other. One the iPod is in there, it's in there, you won't be hot swapping it any time soon. They included a generous amount of links (4 links) to expand the band which left it fitting quite loosely, which I prefer. I don't like to restrict blood flow to my fist and I'm not a fan of tight bands which pull my hair. The rubber backing to the band is a nice touch and keeps them from pulling or snagging on my arm hair.<br /><br />Considering the limited supply and discontinued product, I can see why it's priced higher than expected, still it's lower than when it originally came out. If you're considering buying it, I can't say you won't be disappointed, it truly depends on you. Check out the images and decide for yourself.<br /><br />Some of the &#34;metallic&#34; paint was scuffed but considering there aren't many of these around, I'll have to take the hit on it."
3.0,Returning<br /> Nice material runs extremely small
3.0,"Bought a black and a silver one, both have the same issue. The cuff itself is slightly too shallow to comfortably reach the barbell. It'll fit if I squish my ear but that gets uncomfortable quickly."
3.0,"Cute dress but it’s shapeless. The white in the dress is also a bit see through. For these reasons, I returned it. Go down a size if you’re considering two sizes. It’s plenty blousey. If you’re busty, go down a size. Otherwise the dress hangs from your chest in a tent-like way."
3.0,"seems to be well made, but it was too small."
3.0,Shrunk on cold was.
3.0,The fabric was not great quality and had a small tear in the chest area where the seam is.
3.0,These shoes are really well made and of good quality.But unfortunately the size mentioned are true to US sizes.You should order bigger ones.Wish they had a perfect fit for my size.
3.0,tight on the bust but huge below.  also the neckline is much higher than the picture. I didn't like the fit at all.
3.0,"Completely see through. All of my tattoos and colors of undergarments are on full display. Also as a large busted woman, it makes the waist fit higher than described."
3.0,"The sizing was fine, the color was not at all like what i thought I selected. I choose the light gray with red accents versions, what I received is dark gray and dark pink accents. It's fine, but but beware."
3.0,"It is not the same color as picture, its very shiny and silky.  The fit is good."
3.0,"I have a brown bag almost exactly like this one, the different is the top zipper, main opening is almost 2"" longer.  That extra length makes a big difference in being able to get items in and out of the bag.  This would be a great bag if they would make the top/main opening just a tad longer.  Otherwise it is a very nice bag."
3.0,Black camp had good deep pockets.  Pink has no pockets.
3.0,"Like: soft material<br />Dislike: Runs small, I bought the XXL which is my normal size but is tight fitting. Wrinkles easily."
3.0,It’s super cute just thought it was all silver bling it’s just spray paint silver
3.0,Dissapointed in where the stitching ended on the edge of the brim. Purchased for a fundraiser. Hoping it will sell with that flaw.
3.0,"I like this for a hang around the house weekend sweater. The material is thin for a ""sweater"" and the sleeves are a bit awkward as you can't easily push them up or roll them due to the cuff placement. Still a cute top for the price."
3.0,Dont love it but it ok
3.0,"Arrived quickly. The colors are nice and the quality is standard mid-grade nylon. Only issue was the sizing is off. The black ones were a bit loose so I needed a garter belt. However, the white ones were so tight, they nearly cut off circulation."
3.0,"These are cute like everybody else is saying. However, they do tend to flip around so you see the backside versus the front side of the hearing. Not an issue large enough to warrant returning them, but wish that they faced forward more. Overall cute earrings."
3.0,I have to make some small gold ring to squeeze the chain. Too much hassle...
3.0,"I usually wear a 7.5 or 8 size sneaker.  These fit well.  They are very light weight .  Unfortunately, they hit and rub on my heel, but that is resolved by wearing my padded roll top Thorlo socks."
3.0,Love this dress but it was a little too small for me. It was a bit snug & not cut just right for my “mature larger chest”.
3.0,"Super cute, nicely made but this fabric has no give and the top is not for busty ladies. I got XL and I’m 42C. I looked like I was trying to wear 4 sports bras under this dress, haha. I gave it to my not as busty friend and it was much better. It was too cute to return."
3.0,"For the price, these socks with soles are good, and advertising was correct.  But I was hoping for something that would come over the ankle and that had good padding.  I had moon boots back in the 80s, and absolutely loved them.  I had them for about 20 years, and had to get rid of them when they got a rip in the top, and foam started to degrade since we had moved to a damp climate.  I was sorry to see them go and was hoping the slippers would be similar."
3.0,arrive damage
3.0,"It’s cheaply made look wise, and not the most comfortable band. It’s just a meh."
3.0,"Im 5’3 153lb 36D, I ordered a large because of some of the reviews, and it was a dress on me. It fit around the chest but was way too long and way too loose around the stomach, and there is no exchange option.. you have to order and pay for a replacement, and wait until they receive your return and process it (which I was told could take up to 14 days) before you are reimbursed for that one. I ended up just selling it on Facebook market place so that I could order another one that hopefully will fit."
3.0,These fit loose on me.  No tummy support as it states. Thin material.  Made in China.
3.0,"I didn’t like the fit of this dress. I’m 5’6”/5’7” and the dress fell above my ankle. It was too large everywhere else, and looked more like a maternity dress than a cute tailored dress."
3.0,"Way too long, and the lace is more yellowish than cappuccino (as pictured) and just looks dingy against the white skirt."
3.0,"I would very muck like to discuss the CD with the makers. A downside is that there is no one to talk to when changes need to be addressed...such as ***once you input the critical info, it is not saved after it is closed. This is vastly time consuming and lost hours-I would have liked to know that before I spent 9 hours customizing.<br />After we logged the info in, saved it to the computer, and went in to make minor changes, noticed it was all gone! We tried this several times with the same results."
3.0,"One feather came off in shipping a second came off during initial handling.  Not too difficult to re-attach, but it was disappointing to have to fix something brand new.  For the price, it does look very nice on.  The size is just right."
3.0,They fit well. But the little rubber tips to protect you glasses fall off easy and will leave a mark in the 2 spots where the set on the lens. They are my work glasses and it is not in my view area. So I am ok with that. But if it was my nice everyday glasses it will damage the lens and that would not be worth it. The sun glasses part works well and I am happy with that.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:fdb64bf7ab4b18d48ea6e7e55c2fef43]] The band is too loose because I have a thin wrist..  I will have to add something to make it tighter in order to make it stay on my wrist.
3.0,"This product fit very well and was comfortable for my daughter at her indoor swimming lessons, however, it frayed quickly from the chlorine, even with proper care and rinsing it right away after use."
3.0,Really love these.  The fabric and stitching is strong.  These aren't going to shred in the thighs like other yoga pants I've experienced.
3.0,Tote nicely designed. Looks like photo. Straps are flimsy and very wrinkled.
3.0,It’s really ill fitting. I have a large head and it’s huge on me!
3.0,"I had to have the first one replaced which they did very quickly and respectfully.  The second one didn't work when it got here so I replaced the battery and that fixed it. The back I'm afraid may not have a great seal but it works as it should now.  They are a great company, might need a little more work in some areas though."
3.0,"Bag too deep, but holds alot"
3.0,"Very cute, but seems to be made out of cheap material. We bought this set for our families first trip to Disney. The backpack strap didn’t even make it onto the airplane. It broke at our airport. 😢"
3.0,"I purchased a medium and it fit up top, but it was wayyy too short. It hardly landed past my bottom— I am 5’8 150lbs with small chest. It kinda made me think of a fancy maternity top. I would not be able to move without giving a show haha! If I were to size up it probably would have been too big up top and potentially still too short so I passed on this one. Otherwise, it was very pretty."
3.0,"Perhaps they are slightly long for my 5'5 heigh self, but I found the leg openings to be uncomfortable if I wore these with any type of open back shoe. I just end up stepping on the hem and its kind of rough especially with the zipper that it is painful. The pants are also kind of scratchy on the inside too so that doesn't help."
3.0,I'm giving it 3 stars because it's not the dresses fault that it was too large I also think that this is not the dress I ordered. I received this one in a coral color and also in Black and I would never order the same dress even if they are two different colors. So just be careful whether you order a junior size or a woman size because the junior size fit and the woman's size was way too big this one's being returned
3.0,"Was really pretty when first received, but only really lasted for about a month if that long. After that, the band became dirty looking and the shimmer is gone.  Was great for breast cancer awareness month, but had to buy a new band because it looked so bad."
3.0,just bit large would order a size down
3.0,"Dress had some loose threads. Was very thick, it depends on the look you want, may be too heavy for summer"
3.0,outer runner short is good and dryfit for the discounted price<br /><br />But the inner tight is not tight at all.<br />for the price discounted worhthy
3.0,"I really wanted to like this product. Cute color, button detail, soft fabric. However, the fabric is very thin which caused two problems: 1) my undergarments were visible through it and 2) I'm overweight and it showed off my problem areas. I am returning.<br />Edit: I am normally a size L. I ordered an XL and it was snug on me. Definitely order up!!"
3.0,Fits snug across the chest and in the arms. Material was super thin and not the best quality but the dress was beautiful
3.0,"They are pretty good, but the first ones I bought were un even, and the second ones I got have a weird discoloration on the front, which is pretty noticeable"
3.0,These wings happen to a visually pleasing item. It’s not very large and my petite 6 year old wore them comfortably and the size worked for her. They would be small wings on an adult. Note that the wings are feathers glued to a backing. We had quite a lot of feathers fall off even after one short use. I glued them back on and they stayed but the original glue wasn’t great.
3.0,I like the boots they fit good they are a little heavy.
3.0,"I would say I love it, but the color blend everywhere."
3.0,Looks like it's good quality... but I was deceived by the picture... I assumed it came as a pair. Make sure you order two if you want one for both feet!
3.0,"This purse is okay. Yes, it seems to be real leather and the embossing is beautiful however it is very heavy and bulky. The seams do not lie flat at all which cheapens the look of the purse however it does have a lot of different pockets and storage area which makes it super nice! The shorter handle is way too short and if you use the long strap the purse hangs way too low and hits your leg. Yes it's pretty but there are a few things that could change to make it better. I must say it was a great purchase for the price."
3.0,"It is a very pretty color however, the model must be a size 00 or something, because the sweater I received wouldn't hang that loosely on ANYONE.  Small small small!!!"
3.0,"Necklace as pictured.  Standard material.  Wouldn't wear it in water, to make it last longer.  I unfortunately received the incorrect name for the third time."
3.0,"Nice pjs, but not the same fabric as others. These are a jersey knit."
3.0,Its seems much smaller for the its size.
3.0,"When I first put this waist trainer corset on it looks nice, but as the day goes on it bulges out and makes my stomach look weird and bigger. I think I should of gotten a size smaller than I wear, so maybe it wouldn't do that and stay tight and form fitting. I would really like it if it fit better."
3.0,Terrible swimsuit type material.
3.0,"The Product itself was good. However, it came in very poor packaging. Box was carelessly torn open and the  watch was upside down inside the case. Not sure if this was the manufacturer’s fault or Amazon."
3.0,"The pattern is great, super cute. Fit was a little weird. Snug in the waist area then extra long like they were a &#34;tall&#34; size. These are also a thinner cotton pant not quite a winter wearable but still cute overall."
3.0,It doesn't stretch enough. The waist area seem tighter than the regular tights I buy her. It appears that it fit for a much slender kid.
3.0,If the bones were printed on the underside of the socks I would have rated higher. Putting it on when using shoes pose a bit of a problem as it grips the top part of the shoe. I bought for work as I wear boots often for work and also walk in houses with hardwood floors. So the grips aren’t on the bottom which still causes me to slide. Also putting on my boots is a bit harder and causes the socks to ride up on the foot and cause some discomfort.
3.0,Very pretty was very big great value for the price will not be able to wear it for the wedding but will grow into it maybe for a birthday dress
3.0,"Stretched boot ok, not great"
3.0,"This is a very pretty dress, but I returned it because it was too small.  I suspected that the size small might not fit me, given the measurements on the size chart; however, because I’m only 5’, I didn’t want to order the medium, which would have been far too long.  So I wasn’t entirely surprised the dress was too tight.  What surprised me was that the tag inside the dress said “XS.”  Extra small wasn’t even an option on the size chart.  I weigh about 110 lbs., but I’m not sure whether I was too big for the small size or received an extra small by mistake."
3.0,"I didn’t even try the top on, but it looked really well constructed. As for the bottoms, I was really hoping they would be taller. The sizing was kinda on the larger side. I would have lost these if I swam in them."
3.0,"Nice, but not top quality."
3.0,"Gloves seem to be good quality and light up bright. Unfortunately one of the solder connections on the battery was disconnected, which made one of the gloves not work. I will try to fix it."
3.0,I ordered the Khaki color and got this coral color. It's petty but I really wanted the  Khaki
3.0,Size up on this one.
3.0,Lots of threads that make it scratchy. Only one pair is nice. The rest you can only stand for a while.
3.0,At first I was 100% disgusted and completely over Amazon… Once they fixed the dog poop issue the dress was really really cute!!!
3.0,Item took a long time to get. It fits good it's not fitted though.
3.0,"Like many others have noted, the sword falls out very easily.  The design looks great, and the product is very cool otherwise... but the fact is, if you do use this as a keyring, you WILL lose the sword within a few weeks.  So buyers beware"
3.0,kind of bland...looks homemade
3.0,Too small in the bust if your blessed in that area.
3.0,"They're about the quality you'd expect at this price. Not too comfortable. They arrived scratched and a bid smudged, and I wasn't able to clean any of the smudges off. Whether this is due to poor production or poor packaging during shipment, I'm not sure."
3.0,My 15 year old daughter loves the top. The bottom runs small. Very cheeky. Maybe ok for someone older. We are keeping just for the top. Ordered a medium. She is 5'7&#34; 125lbs. 34C.
3.0,The seam on the shoulder wasn't sown very well and I had to have it repaired.  I like the sweater other than that.
3.0,My husband loves the. But the wrong size was sent. This is just one size too large. Would buy the right size if I could afford to at the moment and return the larger size as my husband does not wish to stretch his ear any further. May never get used at this point.
3.0,Loved the suit itself but was smaller than expected. Definitely order the next size up!
3.0,"Not bad, for the price.. sizing a bit small but not to bad, I think I got a medium size."
3.0,A little flimzy n very light .. expected better quality
3.0,This product fit my watch perfectly and it looked great. Unfortunately the metal bar that connects the watch head to the strap broke. Really wish they included a few extra strap pins!!!
3.0,"The dress is very high in the waist, but also does not have a button where the elastic meets, so there is a gap. I will need to iron it as it is very wrinkled if I keep it. It was not delivered to my hands as stated by the carrier. It was thrown on the porch not even in the basket I have for packages."
3.0,Does not last long
3.0,"The dress was beautiful. I ordered it in medium. It fit my frame well, but did not have enough fabric in the bust area. Even with a camisole, I could not pull it off. Had to return. Recommend going one size up."
3.0,I wear a medium and ordered a medium bc I went by the size chart. Sizing for the coat may be be of by like 2-3inches. It fit okay the arms are a bit small though.
3.0,this did not for the oakley style we have and it sounded like it would. disapppointed. they are good quality.
3.0,"The mask is too short , either I pull up to better cover my nose or pull down to cover the mouth properly."
3.0,"I wear a size 10 or 11 wide width shoe depending on the brand and these fit my foot well, actually didn't compress my toes, like some other compression socks that I've tried. But these socks were too small for my calves and would roll down throughout the day, causing a severe indent in my leg. I wore the socks another time, just to give them a second chance, but they only rolled down sooner in the day. :( These might work for some people, but not for me."
3.0,Thin... thin... thin!
3.0,Glasses look nice but too wide on the nose bridge area.
3.0,Nice but fit too tight
3.0,"Bought about ten of these for a slumber party for a group of 9 year olds. I didn't have time to do as much research or shopping around as I wanted.  The material on these is really thin, not particularly soft, and the robes are really short. Nonetheless, I'm still giving three stars because the robes arrived on time, were decently priced, and we loved the color.  We've also washed them a couple times now and they're holding up fine. I would've give these as a real gift (they're just too cheap), but they were fine for use at the party and as reusable party favor."
3.0,The color of the actual purse was quite different than the picture. It is light and roomy.  I kept the item. For the price it will be ok.
3.0,Bought for my daughter and it's way to small!
3.0,Not see through. If you're between sizes go down. Not super heavy fabric. Feels like bargain leggings but that's coming from someone with well over 100 pairs of leggings lol
3.0,The fan isn't very strong and it's solar so it doesn't work unless you are in the sun.<br />But my kid liked it.
3.0,Measured and ordered based on chest size. Much smaller almost two inches difference.
3.0,more like toe less socks
3.0,Little flimsy...my son still liked it
3.0,"I ordered these at the same time as another pair by a different company (same prices).  Not only did these NOT come with a case or cleaning cloth, but they were rolled up in a plastic bag, and that's all ya get.  They also don't look as nice on my face as the others do.  So knowing what I know now, I'd pass on buying them again."
3.0,Bag is just ok. There are better ones out there.
3.0,"Bought this for a wet sort of caving adventure, unfortunately there was nothing &#34;quick&#34; about the drying on this shirt - it took hours to really dry. I mean, I'm not expecting a wet suit... but cmon."
3.0,"Expected more from this wrap dress. I don’t love that the color doesn’t go all the way through (white on the inside), but it looked so cute on. Even though it looked cute on —there is nothing to hold the one side together so it doesn’t come undone, as wrap dresses usually have a tie on the inside as well, but this one didn’t. So even though it’s cute I wouldn’t feel comfortable going out in it. If anything I’d wear a bathing suit underneath and use this as a cover up. More cons than pros with this dress no matter how cute it was on."
3.0,It’s very cute but however it’s small!!! It’s really a choker I’m thinking about returning it... IDK
3.0,Great fit but the material was not good. It was very thin!!
3.0,"The raincoat is black with silver reflective striping on the pockets and the back of the coat. Along the front of the coat, you have a zipper (extends 31 inches) and snap buttons (7 of them). The length of the coat made it difficult to get the zipper started. The snap buttons worked fine.<br /><br />The front of the raincoat has two pockets- they are both kind of small.  The pockets have a flap over them, but it would have been better if there was a zipper or buttons. Also, I would have liked for there to have been at least 1 pocket on the inside of the coat.<br /><br />The material is thinner than I expected. One advantage to the material being thin is that the raincoat is easy to pack. I think it would have been nice if it came with a travel bag. It only comes with a plastic bag. Also, as I look at the plastic bag, it reads “rain poncho” and there is a picture of a poncho with only 1 pocket on it.  I can understand how the design may have changed over time, but I think it’s important to differentiate between poncho and raincoat. This looks and feels more like a poncho than a raincoat to me.<br /><br />For reference, my fiancé is wearing the medium. He is 6’2 and 185 pounds. The poncho hits him a couple inches below the knees. His arms are 29 inches (which is pretty long) and that’s why the sleeves are a little short on him."
3.0,"I really love this brand of yoga pants. This was my first time ordering the ones with pockets, but they aren't sewn on even. So I'll return them. But they are very comfortable!"
3.0,"Material is soft but not flimsy. Sewn well,came nicely packaged and I like the company ,have ordered from them b4. However it earned 3(*)bcuz the design melts into the background which is why I ordered it, for the design. Maybe highlight the design with more vibrant colors or make the black less dark close to the design.<br />I would still recommend the company as their face masks are comfortable, was well without color running into the wash, no fading yet and have had for awhile."
3.0,nice product.. sized very large
3.0,Bra cups escaped and I can’t find the stuff in pad however very comfortable and I recommend  washing them by hand so you do not lose the inserts
3.0,"I have one for my 4 year and fone for my 2 year. They look nice but quality is very poor. The two years one show is laced, the 4 year one are non lace (some kind of pull down strip)"
3.0,beautiful necklace but cheaply made the tear drop design is very pretty and sparkly<br /><br />i received this item at a discounted price for my honest opinion
3.0,"Product is a perfect fit, great material- I was thrilled until I noticed small rips and snags on both sides. Theres no time for me to return it for a replacement as it is needed for this week.  My advice: order well in advance in case there is an issue and it needs returning."
3.0,Nice outfit but cheep material.
3.0,"This would be my fourth (two brown 1 black) pair of Chukka from Bogs.  The first three were great. fit as expected and lasted for years.  I assumed  this would be the same.  But after first wearing, the fit chaffed.  The nubuck finish looks cheap.  I tried to break them in, not successful.  Though the previous ones lasted (and are Lasting) years, this will be the longest lasting as I never wear them. the rumor is the Florsheim bought bogs and decided on the change.  I am sure the decision was made by men/women wearing suits and shiny shoes  who never wear casual shoes.<br />They are now like all the rest of shoes out there, nothing special.  Sad.  Look for a  pair of the old style.  I am looking but can't find in my size."
3.0,My son said it was uncomfortable to wear .would rather be cold 😬🥶
3.0,Hard to use  for a down home washer they are hard to use it helps me get the hard to reach places but they are a bit bulky n get in the way
3.0,This belt lasted about 6 months when I wore everyday to work before the plastic buckle broke. It never set off the metal detector.
3.0,"this was somewhat large, the description was runs small, and the advice was to buy two sizes up, but i normally wear m/l and I bought a 2xl, and it was big in the arms, bust and waist, im 5'6, 165lbs, 35inch waist.  the material is very nice and stretchy, I will probably buy again but a small size a l or xl im not sure"
3.0,"Prints are poorly made, short strap"
3.0,Would give more stars but this photo isn't what I got. Mine is a darker blue with a dark pink. Would have preferred to get the colors I ordered.
3.0,About 10 sizes too small
3.0,"I liked it, but the bra section was just too small to cover my breast enough."
3.0,"Harness is a great feature to allow air to flow above your skull. Unfortunately the MIPS is not well integrated. I discussed with Giro tech support and they were of no help. Eventually i placed double sided tape on the front between the harness and the MIPS to keep some tension on the harness. That doesn't alter the MIPS functionality and gives so much cooling effect, almost feeling riding with no helmet. It's so unfortunate that Giro did a such lousy job in integrating the MIPS. As a result they came with a new helmet model made of one helmet inside the other. All it took was to place 2 pieces of tape LOL"
3.0,"I received the glasses quickly, which was definitely appreciated. The glasses are of pretty good build quality and style considering the price. Was disappointed to see that the lenses of the black/white pair was more of a purplish hue than the traditional black lens, which I felt wasn't accurately shown in the product pictures. See customer photos for a more accurate picture of the lens color."
3.0,"When Fruit of the Loom makes 5xl underwear, they make the waist the proper size, but do not proportion the pants for the belly beneath the waist.  Quality is fine, but the more expensive Harbor Bay brand is best."
3.0,Just to wear around the house.
3.0,Ordered my normal size of an XL and it was huge! Returned.
3.0,"I like the dress but it is not what I ordered, if you look at all the photos the dress on the model has longer sleeves and the top button is undone making appear that the dress can be unbuttoned. The one shown alone has short sleeves and buttons that cannot be undone which is what I received."
3.0,"Pros- easy to adjust, fold and waterproof. Color doesn't fade.<br />cons- band gets caught on sleeves, magnetic power is low not recommended while running."
3.0,"The fabric is very rough, and the dress is overall heavy and uncomfortable."
3.0,I gave 3 stars because the shirt is absolutely satisfying and very cute. Fabric is a little on the thicker side but that's perfect for winter. The sleeves are long so it can get a little annoying.
3.0,"My son ordered this shirt and found it way too  large for the size.  He usually wears a medium, but this one looks like a X-large to him.  I tried to wash and put in a dryer and hope it will shrink.  It did nto shrink too much.  So if you like this style, order one size down."
3.0,the pictures make the top look like it would be stiff and stable as a 1500s-1700s bodice would look how ever its not. It's a thin stretchy/floppy material with only two lines of boning which kind of is a useless touch since it's not even enough to support anything. the color is accurate and I suppose the picture they used didn't exactly lie. it was probably my fault for not looking at the description for fabric material.
3.0,Wish it had cotton synthetic HOT...love style and color
3.0,Cute but not look good on me and little small
3.0,"Nice looking socks. I’m not sure that they are authentic Trumpette socks. Previous Trumpette socks I’ve purchased had a lining so no threads would hang nor lint/fuzz get in between the baby’s toes. They also come off of the baby’s foot easily, unlike Trumpette socks I’ve purchased in the past. They are cute socks for the price, but I wouldn’t purchase them again."
3.0,Style was perfect I wish the knit material was thicker. Fit was correct
3.0,Nice Dress but all accessories where missing :( !!
3.0,String to weak
3.0,"It looks very nice but- it’s so much pressure on your nose when wearing it :,0"
3.0,"I have 17.5 in calves and small ankles. they are wide, my legs had plenty of space. The ankles on these are made for women with very wide ankles, and even then I think they would have room to breathe. They are cute but  very wide. and they do run big. I normally wear a 9.5 and I ordered a 10 based on the reviews and they are big. I they you could order your original size."
3.0,"+Perfect weight, it's not too thin or thick<br />+Love the turtleneck, it's just the right height<br />+Perfect black - just the right coloring, it doesn't look dyed<br />+This is comfortable to wear - material is soft<br /><br />-I found that this sweater does run slightly short, if you are a little taller, you may want to size up for comfort, or, this top could be too short for you."
3.0,Not real sturdy but nice for a backpack
3.0,Is ok not what I espect arrived later than they say :( quality is not that great as well but it was a fare price ...
3.0,This sweater is not flattering. It doesn’t look the same as the picture at all. It is not oversized and the arms are not flattering. I don’t like it.
3.0,I bought this as a last minute gift for a friend who loves Tory Burch.  I would have returned it if I'd had time.  It is so ugly and cheap looking.  She will use it as a beach bag I guess.
3.0,It’s very pretty but much smaller than I expected. I don’t really like the elastic cord it’s on either. Beads are beautiful but just really small.
3.0,I absolutely loved everything about this headband except for the fact that it slides off your head a lot & it breaks easily.
3.0,Good for the sale price. A very attractive watch for the price.I would not purchase this at the regular price.
3.0,Poor quality. Light weight coin. Feels cheap.
3.0,The purple is very dim and can only really be seen in total darkness. From the picture I thought you would be able to see it during the day.
3.0,"Loved the color, loved the stretchy fit. The fabric is like. Soft synthetic stretchy material. The shortness was a bit shorter for my liking cause I was at an event where I sat down a lot."
3.0,"Cheap material, ripped too easily. I guess that quality is built into the price."
3.0,"I didn't think this top was very flattering on me. It hung in all the wrong places and made me look very wide. It might be a cute fit or a style that some people like, just not for me. Also was not as long on me as it looks in the picture."
3.0,"Although a little big, I recommend."
3.0,Thicker than others I ordered.  They are ok and will work for workouts but not for all day walking.
3.0,"Really cute. I ordered an XL, because I am finding that even though I am a L, most clothes on Amazon are running small. This was too small, with no give to the fabric. Otherwise, this is a very cute dress and I would have loved it! That is the only reason for 3 stars."
3.0,I got the Aqua and it is beautiful but wished I got an XL. My waist is 38 and it could have been looser around the stomach area
3.0,"Cute, stylish, retro dress my husband bought for me. I'm 4'11&#34; and my measurements fit perfectly for size small. No alterations needed except for the length. It it was so long, it touched my shins. For an already petite body, I looked more stunted. I had it hemmed so that it touched just at the middle of my knees. Other than the length, it was perfect. The fabric has a little stretch to it and is very soft against my skin."
3.0,King of cheap material but it's okay. Hangs off the shoulder like it says.
3.0,"Soft fabric and good length (slightly long) to wear over leggings (I'm 5' 4"" tall). Sleeves were a little long, which I like, but were not tight. The only problem is that the rest of the garment (front to back) was too small, and I ordered one, full size up. If I ordered two sizes up, the length would be really long, as would the sleeves. Just didn't work for me."
3.0,"This is a medical alert bracelet so the lettering should stand out and be easily read. It is on the blue, black and white versions. Those have contrast colored letters.  The grey bracelet has only embossed<br />letters that are the same grey.  Isn't very noticeable at all. The other 3 bracelets are what I expected them to be. Good quality."
3.0,"I really didn't ever use these, so cannot comment."
3.0,"Fits perfectly, is comfortable and not itchy. My only problem with this bra, and maybe it just happens that I got an exception, I don't know, is that the zipper gets stuck."
3.0,"Well, I an 4'8&#34; and I could not get it down on my hips. The sides are stationary.  Might do better if the sides were longer Velcro strips so it could be adjusted."
3.0,"I was okay , the material wasn’t breathable . It kinda feels like Halloween costume material . That I didn’t like."
3.0,"This scarf definitely feels warm. However, my problem with it was that it felt somewhat itchy. Perhaps it would be better if the cashmere content would be a bit higher to give it a smoother feel?"
3.0,"The shipping process is awesome. However, the product information does not accurately reflect a correct description of the socks. The description says size 0-12 months. The socks will not fit any 12 month baby. They will fit school age children."
3.0,"The print is off and not beautiful, looks cheap. It's soft and warm though.<br />I bought it as a gift and was not happy with it, but I didn't have time to return it."
3.0,The fit was fine except it was quite short. It looks longer than it is. If you have a booty then this dress is not for you unless you want to be pulling it down all day. I paired it with a plaid shirt around the waist so my butt wouldn't be out when I was walking.
3.0,Ordered a large and it fits like a small
3.0,material looks kinda cheap
3.0,Beautiful and comfortable but the little hooks for shoe strings started falling out on the third day
3.0,"I'm happy with the charm, but it is much smaller than I realized from the picture and difficult to see the faces of the children."
3.0,Material thinner than expected and too short.
3.0,Great feel and silky texture but the color does not match the picture. This is more of a blue than lavender
3.0,"It was very poorly made, and the colors were very dark and dirty looking. Also, a lot smaller than I expected. It also took several weeks to get here. I didn't realize it was shipped from Asia."
3.0,Didn't like fabric.  Good retro.
3.0,Not what I expected. Very thin material.
3.0,The face mask is very attractive and fits my face nicely
3.0,"Moderately difficult to apply without wrinkling of skin or smooshing of the girls. For reference, I'm a 34 DDD (natural, no implants). For smaller girls, would probably work fine, but I will probably only use these occasionally since they don't quite support me well enough. Tried these out at work one day and held up to eight hours of contortionism and constant activity in the veterinary field. Due to my larger bust, they were a little bit saggy towards the end of the day, but good alternative to going braless and the adhesive seems to work Fine. Granted, did not get super sweaty and it was not super hot, so no clue how it's going to hold up in the summer."
3.0,Very cute but bulky and a bit uncomfortable to wear.
3.0,"Good for what it is. The clasp can be a little tricky to close securely, but once you get used to it, it's fine."
3.0,It wicks but don't buy this for warmth!
3.0,It runs really short. I’m 5’11 and ordered an XL. It barely covers my butt.
3.0,Very cheap looking.  Made a mistake giving 3 stars.  One of the top butterfly on one of the ear ring was missing:(  I can't rate even a one star on this.
3.0,Good quality but runs small.  I bought for my daughter and am glad I read the reviews...she typically wears an adult small and I got her a large which fits perfectly.
3.0,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZZSH6D5/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1
3.0,Overall this dress is “OK”. It’s a thin linen dress with actual real buttons down the center. The sleeves in the picture are misleading as the sleeves on the real thing are very large and stick out at an odd angle. Not overall flattering. Will wear it because I have bought it but wouldn’t recommend it at all
3.0,"I didn't really notice any 'pushing up' with this bra. Pushing up would require a firm cup. These cups are flimsy, just like all the other bras that have removable cup pads. It does however, firm up the sides, holding the loose skin or fat closer to the body and into the bra. The band is no more supportive than a loose sports bra.<br />Update:<br />One thing this bra has that others in this category do not is that in the straps, the bottom of each strap is unhook able enabling a crisscross design, which, in this shape, does give more stability to hold 'the girls' up. The straps are wider than the average bra, that gives it more stability. So, even though it doesn't give much support in the conventional style, if you don't mind wearing the straps crisscrossing, it will give you support that way. Then, you will love this bra."
3.0,"Bought this necklace for my 9 year old niece, who loves sloths.  It appears as pictured, although there was some air bubbles in the facing of the metal on the sloth itself. Kind of a bummed about the bubbles, but should have expected the quality considering the price."
3.0,Nice looking piece. It looks good and well made. however this did not last long as it has now fallen apart with the metal part coming off from the leather. I have not been able to fix it. I am not sure i can recommend this product to anyone based on my experience with it.
3.0,"Standard body briefer. Straps kinda smush my boobs and the hooks like to come undone while I'm pulling it up my legs. I ordered the largest one available, the size 10, and its very clear this garment was not meant for anyone over 5'8&#34;. I am 5'9&#34; and change, and the band is about 2 inches lower than where it should be - probably why it smushes my breasts instead of giving me the model's perfect V. I purchased another bodysuit type garment from a similar vendor and it too seemed to be stitched for someone a couple inches shorter than me."
3.0,I returned this item. It arrived too late for me to use on my trip. It also didn't fit well and was not as nice looking as I expected.
3.0,"It is a nice way to change up your look. A comfortable,adjustable chain, but you have to keep an eye on it since the cross can pass through the infinity symbol. This can make it very easy to lose the item."
3.0,They look great for display for a party but couldn't keep them put together. Barely touch them and they fall apart. We put duct tape on them but then they couldn't be folded back. Kids didn't mind they still rocked them
3.0,"I have damaged rotator cuffs in each shoulder, so need help because I don’t have range of motion in either arm so putting on support socks are a chore. These did not help with that at all. Also the magnets kept popping open. At any other time I might have learned how to use them, but they required too much stretching of the arms. Liked them because they are lightweight. Too bad I had to return them."
3.0,The cloth it self is thin. I’m just gonna use it for a bday party that has a Paris themed..
3.0,"I truly had high hopes for this to work out because it is so hot in texas and this would be great for the weekends. However it was way too tight in the bust I couldn't pull it off. I do think for people less busty it might work, it was a tab bit see through but oh well."
3.0,"Received these gloves last week and they were not really what I was expecting from the picture.  The picture made them look more of a slim fit type glove but they are much more thick than I expected.  Straight up ski glove thickness.  Because they are so thick the touch screen usage is pretty limited if you thought you could type in these.  Got to try them out last night.  Not bad but again not what I expected a -40 degree glove to do.  Maybe kept my fingers stayed slightly warmer than a $15 big box store Thinsulate ski glove would but after about an hour or so my fingers were feeling the cold and it was temps just in the low teens to single digits.  By the time I hit the two hour mark my fingers were just as cold as in any other glove.  Since there were double what I would normally pay for gloves I thought they would be significantly better.  Overall a decent glove, but if you were expecting that you were getting a glove that will keep your hands warm all day that you could do a bunch of texting while on then you will be disappointed."
3.0,"Admittedly, my daughter wore these several times a week, but they lasted less than two months. They got worn out quickly and had holes in them. The lining is actually pretty thin. She loved them though, clearly!"
3.0,"It's a shame because I ordered my usual size, and everything from the Ribcage and up is PERFECT!  but the shirt is a tad to short so if I'm working out and Bend over or Stretch by leaning backwards, it exposes skin.  That is my only problem with them is just slightly too short in the torso, other than that they are great!"
3.0,2 it’s perfect 👌 but the other one it’s totally different material not stretch it all so don’t fit me 👎
3.0,Cute necklace but more for a child or teenager. Very short for an adult. It was packaged so beautifully
3.0,Funny fits well
3.0,"The lacing in the back is just for show. I could get it tight enough for my 36D's so I just wore a cutesy black bra underneath. I got tons of compliments and loved that the hat was small enough to stay on my head and off my eyes. There was a hole where ther white fur meets the red fabric at the bottom of the skirt, my no one noticed and it affected nothing. For the price it was a fun costume."
3.0,not a well formed brim.
3.0,Cute but it’s bigger than what I expected.
3.0,The lace on the bottom strunk in the dryer. Air dry if you don't want to ruin the dress.
3.0,But some came broken.
3.0,The cloth is almost see-through… thinner than I expected. and the neckline doesn't sit on my shoulders like on the model (of course). More &#34;flashdance&#34;-y. But it works for hanging around the house...
3.0,"I returned this. It fit just fine and was slimming, but the ladder down the front middle was wonky and crooked, so it looked awful. The shelf inside was a bit low too. I will say that there is no way this would have budged if I kept it though- it moves very easily. As someone with DDs, that's a big deal!"
3.0,"Bought it for my daughter for Christmas. It is really pretty, seems well made, nice size and most importantly..she loves it!<br /><br />Edit: After 3 months of use the cross body strap has broken. While the purse is still usable because of the other straps, it was mainly bought to be cross body."
3.0,I know they are a compression garment but very hard to get on and off
3.0,Finishing is not good that much means the firem
3.0,I got this for proper design placement using my own htv designs (iron-ons) and the numbers aren’t perfectly even with the opposite side. Not great.
3.0,"These are nicely made, but when other reviewers have remarked that they are small, they're right - they are TEENY TINY. I'm a small person and I thought that was fine, but these are difficult to see when you have them on - that's how tiny they are. If you have a child with pierced ears, this would be a good choice."
3.0,They are “ok” very thin and see threw
3.0,The tie around one is way smaller than picture shown.  Thry are cheaply made but good for price.
3.0,"Runs small, I should have ordered up a size"
3.0,"I ordered this watch band in July.  Initially I loved it!  Super comfortable.  It started falling off randomly. I would find it in the seat of my car.  It is November, and today it won’t stay on!  A little disappointed. Looking for a new one."
3.0,The product fit me well.  However the fabric color bled when I washed.
3.0,Love the look of this purse but the button in the front doesn’t stay closed. Not a huge issue and might be that I’m keeping too much in it but can be annoying.
3.0,"they are just ok, not as nice as I thought they would be."
3.0,"I ordered three of these shirts as maternity shirts — red, turquoise, and charcoal. I had bought the charcoal first and loved it. I'm plus sized and the fit was snug, but worked well with my baby bump. I quickly ordered two more in bright colors, and was very disappointed. The way the fabric stretched made the bright colors almost transparent across my bust and belly, unlike the charcoal version, and in general the fit seemed tighter. The fabric is wonderfully soft, so I might order a size up in the bright colors to try again, but the two I got are getting returned. I'm keeping the charcoal though!"
3.0,"Fell apart after one wearing, but very lovely, regardless."
3.0,The pattern itself is beautiful and works well with my salon theme however the back hook doesn't even make sense it doesn't connect properly around the neck of a client. Also it is not waterproof or chemical proof so it would only be for hair cutting or styling.
3.0,these did not fit like the regular blue jeans. quite a bit smaller.
3.0,Nice but big around head
3.0,Nice color shoe is rough under fur
3.0,Great for everyday use.  Just a tad smaller than I had hoped.
3.0,"pretty, but the sizing is not true to size for USA"
3.0,Top heavy
3.0,"These wedge sandals are true to size and comfortable, however, the heel strap is quite a bit bigger than it should be which makes it awkward feeling, thankfully for the straps that tie up your legs because they really hold the shoe in place. The downside is that these shoes are not as cute as I'd originally hoped they were. The material used on the wedge doesn't match the material used on the rest and the two materials just don't go together. Plus the wedge material has a huge noticeable seem in them."
3.0,"Frankly, I was disappointed.  I ordered two sets for gifts for girls.  One was just what I had read and anticipated.  The other was larger and the earrings were too large for a young teen.  I'm just not clear why I didn't receive the same jewelry when I ordered two of the same thing.  I guess I'll just give her the necklace and leave the earrings out of it."
3.0,"Very pretty, but a hassle to take Fitbit in and out"
3.0,These are a little to big for the size.
3.0,"This jacket runs small, so I would order at least one size up.  It was too small for the 4-5 year old, but is a good fit for our 2-3 year old."
3.0,"Very soft, but runs way small. I wear a 12, ordered a 16-18 and it was still too snug, plus way to long then."
3.0,"Nice quality, but their sizing chart is garbage. Gave it to someone with a bigger noggin."
3.0,The quality seemed nice and as per pictures. But it lasted one use and the closing did not work anymore. Cannot used them anymore
3.0,The turtleneck shirt itself fit great but the neck was too big.
3.0,Nice but are short
3.0,"Nice swimsuit, but not for my body."
3.0,I liked the bags but they didn’t last long at all they fell apart with only a outfit in it
3.0,Stones were medium blue.no color variation. Had hoped for blue - green mix. Will return .
3.0,"I WANT to like them more than I actually do.<br />I think if the colors FADED into one another, rather than just abruptly going from pink to purple, I would. Also I'm short, so there's less real estate for them to stretch out over anyway."
3.0,This are huge!
3.0,My daughter loves the look of these bright red shiny pants.  Not breathable at all.  These are fine for costume use but don't expect them to last.  Crotch is ripping and coating is peeling off after trying them on for an hour.  They will most likely last for the night we need them up on stage but then I'll have to throw them out.  You get what you pay for I guess and we are satisfied they will work for our short term needs.
3.0,It's a decent shirt but the you can see the pockets hanging from the bottom. I can easier fix but shouldn't have to.
3.0,Nice print but the size is way too big. I am usually a medium but the size small of the shirt fits like a large.
3.0,"Hard to get on by myself. When on and when worn with my bracelets, I get a lot of compliments."
3.0,Like the design but run small.
3.0,"Anybody who likes the Witcher show will probably like this pendant, but don’t get it for your Viking friend. According to the title, this necklace features Viking runes and there is some sort of basic geometric shape that could be considered a rune, it is not Viking. I also believe that these are mass produced and although they may have a vintage (or more correctly an ‘ancient’) look, they are definitely not vintage, nor are they a coin of any sort. My biggest complaint however is not about the style or even the pendant itself. As you can see in my pictures, with moderate wear time, the plating has come off the chain and it is now very abrasive to my skin. It is rough to the point where I’m concerned about the manufacturing of the metal itself and do not trust it against my skin. I’m going to put mine on a better chain or leather cord and it will be fine. If they supplied a better chain, I’d have given 4 stars."
3.0,"It came flattened but we still used it and had a great wedding.  However, I wish the flower had not been flat"
3.0,It is difficult to keep them in your place
3.0,"I have had this necklace come apart at the clasp a few times now, it looks great but is definitely super cheap material.."
3.0,Cool boots for price but they don't fit.
3.0,Size to small color better in the picture
3.0,Pretty but itchy. Wouldn’t buy again.
3.0,a tad small but nice
3.0,Love the hats but Unfortunately one of the two hats came with a hole in it.  Very disappointed to find a hole in a new item.
3.0,"The socks aren't as thick as I thought they were going to be, but they're still cute with boots"
3.0,I think the arm bands were made for a man or larger person. They are to big for my arms. Everything else worked out nicely.
3.0,It was bought as a gift....for my insane brother who follows these devils!
3.0,"nice and comfy dress, fits large"
3.0,This shirt was initially cute but beware of washing it. It fades quickly and shrinks.
3.0,"The bag is cute and classic.  But the inner compartment is only like half the height of the bag.  I could fit next to nothing in it.  The pocket on the front was only good for loose change or keys, otherwise you couldn't zip the inner compartment due to the entire bag bowing out. I would've returned it but my niece liked it so I gave it to her."
3.0,Good value. Does not fit
3.0,Tight on the neck and too short.
3.0,It fits me perfectly when I was pregnant. Good quality and comfy.
3.0,Very cute but easily shreds apart.
3.0,Color was more green than inline photo.
3.0,I ordered 2 sizes bigger and still small
3.0,The charm fell off the second day we had it:(
3.0,"Durability is shaky, zipper is shaky.  Not horrible for the price."
3.0,The dress should drip try ask to not have so many lint balls.
3.0,I personally wasn't very impressed. They're nice but the pic was a little deceiving. The ones I got were a lot more rounded than what was shown. Very light in weight. Not an exact match.
3.0,The print on the front is too plastic and gets too hot.<br />A little short
3.0,"It is more sheer than I expected, so that you must wear clothing under the dress. It doesn't fit right, not exactly too small, just an awkward cut so that it is falling off my shoulders and feels tight around the back and arms."
3.0,The coat is like what the pic looks and. I order a size up. ..  Fits perfect
3.0,The color was perfect but the decoration are not as cute as advertised.
3.0,I am just 5 4 and had to return because it was too short.
3.0,"A cheap watch that lasted 2 years before the mode buttons stopped responding, and the too-short strap broke. My previous, inexpensive Casio lasted longer. Oh well."
3.0,Beautiful purse wish the wallet was a flip open one.  bigger than what i thought thanks
3.0,Not bad. It’s really cute
3.0,Super cut on but started getting sweater balls after 2-3 washed on &#34;knitted&#34; cycle.
3.0,"I used to have a necklace like this and it was my favorite. I lost it so I searched for one here and found this one. It's the only one like mine that isn't goldish so I ordered it. but the necklace chain was broken when it arrived, and the little metal thing on the door hinge was poking out, not quite clamped the way it should be, so it feels like the door might come off. My son chose it to give me for mothers day since I had wanted one anyway but I was sad I haven't been able to wear it. I would return or exchange, but I misplaced it and can't find it now. If those two issues hadn't been there this would have been perfect! If you're good at fixing minor jewelry issues then this is still a great buy!"
3.0,Honestly they're kinda mediocre. The little flaps that go over your fingers kept popping down so I just cut them off. I've only had them a few weeks and the cotton is kinda balling up like lint. Not very thick either so if you're in extreme cold I can't recommend. But for the price they're ok I guess. The should have just used velcro instead of the buttons for the finger flaps and made sure the cotton didn't suck so bad. But it's whatever
3.0,"The watch itself is absolutely stunning and sleek. However, after using the watch minimally (10 times over the course of 3 months), the dial knob came off and I will now have to resolve the matter of return/replacement with the third party vendor as Amazon only covers returns for a fixed amount of time following delivery confirmation. I am aware that most warranties do not cover normal wear-and-tear damage to the item (ex. scratches to the dial, leather wearing down, battery not working), however the dial knob itself falling off without any tampering is puzzling and would greatly appreciate assistance with this!"
3.0,They would be nice except the compression left a bulge in my belly area instead or smoothing anything
3.0,Dress was beautiful however large in the chest then I sized it at.
3.0,"The umbrella is well made, appears that it'll last, but I was looking for traditional style and a wood handle.  It's plastic!<br /><br />Nothing in the description says that it's plastic.  I'm keeping it, but it's not what I thought I was getting."
3.0,"Hmmm... I think if you have a narrow, ruler shaped torso this would look great. Honestly. But if you are an hourglass like me, it does you no favors. And the pockets are placed along the side seam, so they buldgr a little where you should have a smooth silhouette on along your waist. The construction seems great though, and it is warm! The double zipper adds extra warmth too. It's not a bad hoodie, it's just a bad hoodie on me."
3.0,Chain is cheap as u kno what. Charm is cool. Just buy new chain is all so t dont randomly break and fall.
3.0,"Vino sin el eyepatch, y pues me queda un poquito grande. No se moldea muy bien con el rostro y cansa tenerla puesta luego de unos minutos, no me imagino con el eyepacth. Se ve decente visualmente."
3.0,I have tried and tried to get these broken in so I could wear them to no avail. And I just can't wear them. They fit well but they are stiff and hard. I think that is the  problem.
3.0,"Like the watch, easy to read, length of the band is good.<br /><br />My disappointment is, it does stay clasped, it's too short. Keeps falling of my hand. I am going to put velcro on it.<br /><br />Can be worn casually  or every day. Thank you for my order."
3.0,"I have had this back pack for about a year, and it has seen a lot of travel over these past 12 months.  First off, there is a lot to like about this back pack.  If is super well thought out, it doesn't sag when you have it adjusted properly, the nifty charger/accessory compartment is wonderful, I really like it from a user standpoint.  My biggest gripe, and I see it here often, is that the straps are fraying at the top where the straps meet the backpack.  You would think that this would be an important thing for a manufacturer of backpacks to take into consideration which is why I gave it three stars.  Does it still function?  Yes, but it looks bad and I fear that the fraying will continue until it eventually becomes unusable or fails altogether.  Too bad they missed this important detail at E-Bags, otherwise, it would be an easy 5 star rating.  I've had many people comment on this backpack, and when they ask me for a recommendation, unfortunately, I have to tell them about the straps and that I probably wouldn't buy it again for that sole reason.  I hope they address this as a running change to the backpack, it would be a no-brainer 5 star if they would."
3.0,It was nice. Not quite as sparkly as depicted. Biggest issue is way too long and shipping was very late.
3.0,It is a fine product and I have recoeved many compliments on it but it is a tiny bit small around the bottom. I have a 44 waist and it shouldnt be that tight. The other shirt in my order is the same size and fits perfectly
3.0,"The black and grey shorts fit my daughter as excepted, but the white shorts were hard for her to pull up. They were not a Large."
3.0,I like the ability these headbands have to absorb (I have a very sweaty forehead when I'm on the treadmill) but I wasn't as pleased with the texture.  The material is almost scratchy (definitely not a soft terry fabric) and every one of them have thick seams that are definitely noticeable and almost uncomfortable when you wear them.
3.0,It looks nice the top and skirt fit more like a large than a medium
3.0,Too narrow in the waste and couldn’t even get on.
3.0,"I purchased 2 for gifts & was dissapointed in the quality of the hoodies , very thin for the price. Neither my son or his roommates fit both 2 sizes too small so I had to go pick them up and return them to the Amazon fresh store. The guys love Bebop Cowboy so it ended well just a hassle for me."
3.0,Color was described and pictured as Red. A Burgundy leather watch was delivered. Very disappointed.
3.0,"Picture makes it look fitted but it fits more like a nightshirt. Its still comfy so I'm keeping it to wear around the house, but no out and about as I had planned."
3.0,I got the wrong color! It would have been better if I got the color I paid for.
3.0,Not what I expected. Peacock is beautiful. Material on bag is stiff and heavier than I anticipated.
3.0,"They are a bit tight around the foot. Can't wear cushioned socks with them, gotta be thin ones. Other than that, I like them."
3.0,"Top was perfect, pants were not made for thick girls"
3.0,The lace is pretty but the style is very boxy and the fabric is not amazing
3.0,Loved everything about it except cheap zipper. Won’t last long if you get it to work. Will be returning.
3.0,"This hat will be fine for the beach or pool, however it arrived in just an envelope (meaning it was all squashed and wrinkled from day one)."
3.0,The tie strap was sewn in to dress at an awkward place in dress had to return
3.0,These are so fun.  The kids love them.  When the package came it was already open and there were some missing in the 40 piece packet.  Out of the 35 we had 6 or 7 were broken/not working.  I though there would be more than enough for my child's class to hand out for his birthday but we barely had enough.
3.0,"Runs small. Worn twice and already lost a hook!<br />Oyherwise, comfortable and the fabric is nice."
3.0,"I am a 40DDD and this dress fit up until the zipper got to my boobs. Keep in mind the zipper is up the side of your body, not the back. But the material was great. I ended up returning."
3.0,"These are the perfect panties for after c section. They come up high enough and are tight enough to hold everything together. I would have given it more stars, but the pack I received had a wrong size. I ordered XL and got half XL and half L. I didn’t feel like sending them all back, so I just kept them."
3.0,The straw hat got here a week earlier and that's awesome an all BUT I thought it would come in a box instead came in a bubble wrap meaning it came all wrinkle so I have to shape it up my self. Totally not worth 40$ with the shipping an handling more like 20$ maybe 25$. Yes its a replica straw hat but if it would of come ripped because they lack putting it in a box. Other that all that it looks nice the size of the hat looks small perfect and the buggy's scratches looks good pretty real in my point of view.
3.0,It is pretty much what it looks like in the picture just made of cheap fabric
3.0,"My son would have given them 5 stars, but I had to order a second pair, so that is why I am only giving them 3.  They are small.  Totally order up.  My son is very thin and usually a 32 is lose on him.  He could not button them.  With that said the button whole was not cut open, so even if they fit he would not have been able to button them.  I re-ordered him another pair and they came quickly."
3.0,And that’s my size
3.0,"It looked ok and maybe could have been ok if I could fit it. Size chart was definitely off. The material felt a little on the thin side. As always, easy and convenient return policy."
3.0,"It is made nice, looks nice but it is no where near wide enough for a big busted gal. The top ends up rolling up above or below your chest not fun if you are wearing it with a top that is too low cut! Also the fabric is just little bit thinner than I would like it to be. I can see my cleavage underneath it.<br />It is very pretty and is such a great idea. Just please make it wider so it doesn't roll up. That is my only problem with it. It fits well around and it is very comfortable when it is not rolling up on itself."
3.0,The bands were not what I expected.  They are ok but not the type that I used to order.
3.0,"These work for the price you pay, but not the best hosiery socks I've found. They tend to be super tight up around the top elastic, but all wonky and twist easily in the shoe. Don't like having to remove my shoe a few times a day and straighten up the sole of the socks so you can't see the cotton bottom all twisted."
3.0,"The necklace and pendant is cute.  However, there's no message or nice gift box included which really sucks.  I'll have to make my own."
3.0,"Great top, really it is except it’s UNHEMMED!  This is a knit fabric which is vulnerable to unraveling. It does not state in the description that it’s unhemmed. Lucky for me, I sew and have a sewing that I can use to hem this. Unlucky for me, I have to hem this. It’s not the end of the world but not something I expect I have to do to a purchased top. GRRRRRR!"
3.0,"The fabric does not have any give. It's a nice shirt otherwise. I think it's true to size if you like tight clothing, but I think this is meant to be loose."
3.0,"I love the material of this dress and how it fits. In the pictures, the accent strings on the side look sexy but are slightly awkward when worn. If you find a way to alter the strings the dress looks super cute. Not a regrettable purchase but If I tried it on in person prior to purchasing it I probably wouldn't of bought it."
3.0,"You get what you pay for. Bought to wear to wedding. So cheaply made, the necklace broke in half taking it off after the wedding. Had to through it out."
3.0,"Sturdy shoe, easy to walk in, but the hardware detail digs into your toes. Such a weird spot to put hardware on a shoe, especially a metal piece."
3.0,Beautiful color.. zipper was very hard to get down. Came packaged nicely but very wrinkled.
3.0,Fade quick.
3.0,"This is a good tank, but it is short in length. Would get 5 stars if it was longer."
3.0,"I am 4'11"" and my measurements are 37-29-36. I bought this and it veryyy big on me. I'm returning."
3.0,I read the size chart and still too small for me so I end up giving it to my wife  it looks better on her
3.0,"Love the way they look and they’re soft as well, however they’re very loose and don’t fit neither me or my husband’s heads well."
3.0,"Wanted to love it, but it's too pink for my taste. Will be returning."
3.0,"The reviews are all over the place for this dress, so I’ve decided to add mine to the mix. I ordered this dress in XL even though I am a M-L, based on so many reviews of it being very small. THIS IS TRUE. It fit well in the chest and shoulders whereas an XL would usually be falling off me. But it was very tight and unflattering in the waist. Also, the fabric of the bottom is REALLY REALLY cheap and peculiar. It would be okay in dim lighting but in daylight looked very cheap. I’m sure it works out for some, but not for me. Also, it runs VERY long. I actually liked the length because I am 5’6”. But a short woman would find this tobe like a maxi dress."
3.0,"Was happy to receive this item but was a little disappointed with the overall look. While wearing it people were wondering if I had gotten into an accident by looking at the size of the lips.<br />Too bad the lips were NOT smaller, therefore not so realistic. Other than that it was well made."
3.0,"I was looking forward to getting this top, but the product was way too big. I washed it in hot water in hopes that it would shrink. No luck there.  Then, of course, I couldn't return it. Looks like I will be giving it away to someone else."
3.0,Very pretty. Stone does sit up high and occasionally snags my clothes. There is no opening under the stone as in most rings. Thought that was weird. Gives it away that it is fake.
3.0,The topping is brown and not green like advertised
3.0,"It is very cute but run alittle small,, i should of ordered a bigger size"
3.0,Liked the fabric and seem well made but didn’t like the slim fit. I’m an older (70) women and don’t like to see underwear seams. Don’t think a larger size would have made a difference.
3.0,"From the reviews, I thought these masks would be thin. They aren't what I would consider thin.<br />I have issues wearing a mask - if I wear one for more than 10 minutes I start coughing, get a sore throat and headaches and my blood pressure goes way up. So I have stayed isolated and avoid going anywhere as much as possible. But occasionally I have to go out to take care of business. I was looking for a mask that I could wear that would do the trick, without causing the coughing especially. This one doesn't do it either.<br />It is stretchy t-shirt type material , but not thin t-shirts like I have had. It fits fairly well. It may work for most people, unfortunately not for me. It's no more breathable than any of the other masks I've tried."
3.0,Pros: Not too big. I bought one of these from another seller a few months ago and it was huge! Looks almost identical to the rose gold one on here but way bigger. This one fit my nose perfect. I did like that it was in a pack of 5 for variety.<br /><br />Cons: I wore it for around 3 hours walking around. It was a warmer day and I noticed it turned my skin green around my nose. I had to take it off.<br /><br />I would not recommend for long wear especially if you may sweat or if it’s warmer day. Otherwise very cute especially if you stay indoors in AC.
3.0,"Quality was good, but It was on the yellow side, I was expecting  A champagne gold.  I sent it back."
3.0,These are very cute but the clasp is super cheap and will break. It can be easily replaced though and the overall look of the bracelet is awesome. I bought a few of these and this review is pretty much the same for all.
3.0,"Love the coat, but the zipper broke after a month and can't be repaired; requires replacement zipper."
3.0,Shirt quality is OK for the price but is not true to size.  Would recommend purchasing size larger than normal (fits small).  A little disappointed with total quality of this product.  Would not purchase again.
3.0,"I'm 113 lbs, size 6 dress and the pants fit fine. Comfortable pants. No issue with zippers. The pants are water-resistant/water-repellant, but NOT waterproof as advertised."
3.0,Seems comfy at first but it does seem to dig in as the day wears on.
3.0,"cute shirt, wore it to work but the button at the top in the back came off, i just safety pinned it together - it worked for the time being"
3.0,"These leggings have no vertical seams at all. I would imagine they are great for wearing as an under layer or even under a cute skirt or dress, but they will not shape your butt and upper legs like regular outdoor leggings well."
3.0,"I just wear the hoop in my ear because I couldn't get the ball in, but that could just be because I'm an idiot."
3.0,"Seems that they've changed something...  He's had this same pair before, but these are little big.  Otherwise great!"
3.0,its not made out of much quality material but it'll do if you use it here and there...
3.0,"The colors are very nice. I had to return them as the dots hurt the bottom of my feet while standing (the yarn is also hard).  I had ordered this other kind from another vendor - [[ASIN:B01FW9LG5Q YogaAddict Yoga Full Toe Socks with Grips (Non Slip Skid Lines), 3 Pairs Value Pack Set, Men & Women, For Yoga, Pilates, Barre, Martial Arts, Hospital - size S/M]] and I will be keeping them. The lines instead of dots are tolerable, and the material is soft."
3.0,"I ordered a size medium, im normally a size 6 in pants and dress sizes and I'm about 5 foot 7 inches amd 130 pounds, they are very loose  but I actually dont hate them.  Will re order in smaller size."
3.0,"They are cute, fit fine, but... they inseam is shorter than pictured."
3.0,"These bags worked great when we traveled. Since they folded into a nice neat small square they packed into our suitcases nicely. We also were able to carry them in our pockets and pull them out when we went into stores. They were a life saver. If I have one criticism it would be on the stitching along the pocket, on several of the bags the pocket started to come apart. We even took great care to fold the bags correctly and not to just stuff it into the pocket."
3.0,I probably should have sent this back and bought a bigger one. These two are too short.
3.0,"I absolutely love toe socks; they make so much sense to me for health, warmth and sanitary reasons.  These are very nice, but you don’t receive the colors displayed, which I DON’T like!  What is displayed is what you should receive ... unless color choices are available.  Two colors were correct, two were not what I wanted or could use, but were not shown in display.  Show what you are selling or state CHOICES NOT AVAILABLE."
3.0,I ordered a womans 3xl but it fit smaller than the previous one I ordered that was a man's 2xl (different company).  I will keep it because I'm tired of trying to find one that fits well or like a 3 xl should.  The heating is good.
3.0,Good for the money but tour in the knee after this the second game for youth basketball.
3.0,Tons of volume. Maybe too much volume. I could not get over the chemical smell and had to send back. I couldn’t gamble that it would air out by Halloween.  The two fabric layers underneath are nice and prevent any itching.
3.0,"The medium pink is a VERY bright totally neon pink. Kind of tacky…To be frank. I think that’s very misleading and rude. Get the colors right, or no one will keep buying your bikinis."
3.0,"Hm. I probably should have read the reviews before I purchased this jacket. I was hoping for the jacket as pictured, but it's definitely a costume jacket. I'll be returning it."
3.0,Had to make adjustments but good quality material
3.0,I love the swimsuit but it was more green than a mixture of pink and green. Plus had darker green colors that looks like the sick emoji 🤢 for better context. It honestly is not bad but not flattering on medium tone skin.
3.0,Its really a very but very light pink. Not as shown but nice.
3.0,"I ordered these thinking that they looked true white in the photo - not off-white. When I got them they were a deep cream color, and the lace at the top was a dark almond color, so they really weren't even off-white. They're also pretty small. Otherwise, they're very cute."
3.0,"These are my third pair of fleece ear covers, not because they fall apart, well so i thought, but because I can't never keep track of them. These are life savers during the winter for sure. Not cumbersome at all and very warm. If you are looking to not wear a hat during the dead of winter, this is the next best thing. Just try to keep track of them when you take them off. I love these things and recommend them during the winter. They are adjustable to all size heads and are extremely comfortable and soft to wear. UPDATE to this entry, after only a few times of wearing these, they fell apart, so to recommend these would be foolish...too bad because I did like them..."
3.0,"I'm a US 12 /38DD and it fits fine everywhere except it's tight across the shoulders. If I didn't reach it was fine, lol. Definitely a nice pattern with lovely flow to it."
3.0,"It looks very nice and I'm a big fan of The bracelet style, but the screw on ball kept coming off until I lost it. Not worth the money in my opinion. You get what you pay for."
3.0,"I'll be returning this because I can't get the dress over my bodacious booty.  I also didn't like the sewing with the sequins.  There were small threads all over the place.  The dress itself was a beautiful color and I just wish I had looked at the pictures of the back to see that it was a lace up, corset-style dress.  I'm afraid if you try to lace it up too tightly the sewn in loops would rip."
3.0,I love this sweater but when I received it it was not the color I ordered it was the white with blue letters I ordered the black with yellow letters
3.0,The bows are good size and I like the thin bands. I just wish the bands matched the colors of the bows. It looks awkward when they are different colors for example the navy bow arrived on a black band.
3.0,Cute but way long!! Purchased for my 6 year old and it could honestly have fit a kid that is in a 8-10. My 8 year old ended up wearing the small and it was still a little long on her and then her best friend who wears a 12 wore the medium and it was big on her.
3.0,Can't stand alot of wearing
3.0,Was great at first. Then with continued use the earrings started to fade and get really not nice looking. Disappointed.
3.0,"Very thin, and ruffles didn’t seem to lay right. Looked so much cuter online."
3.0,Make it smoother
3.0,This shirt was very small and was more like a shirt you would wear to the gun instead of an everyday shirt. Hate it
3.0,It's cute but the pink is too bubblegum and not the dusty rose color shown.<br />I gave it away.
3.0,I ordered a large (size 10)  but it was to small. I can get it on but it is snug which made me tug at it a little and it ripped...If it fit I would have loved it.
3.0,Great for hikes but NOT waterproof and hard to clean. also when drying out I had to put them through the washer or they would smell horrid. Ok for the price
3.0,"Ok, but not quite what I had hoped for.  Sort of look like cheap knockoffs. But, fine for around the house. I’ve seen worse polyester blends, but not too much worse. You could probably do better."
3.0,"These are cute and my daughter loves them, the fit is great! However, it's only been 2 weeks and there's already a hole in the bum of the pants 🤦"
3.0,"I ordered a medium and I'm 5'5"" 130lbs 34DD. This was fitted through the stomach and over my chest and I wouldn't have wanted it any tighter, however this would have needed adjustable straps or straps to be a couple inches shorter to lift my chest even a bit or provide any kind of support at all. As it was it just flattened my chest and even at a standstill I felt unsupported and uncomfortable."
3.0,"They are not bad but they just do not look like the items in the picture. Firstly, the butterflies are not small and dainty like in the image. They are HUGE, making it look much more costume like. Secondly, the individual butterfly is not and earring but a cuff so you can not wear it to balance out the other side. They are not shaped like the ones shown on the woman’s ear. Again that aren’t bad just much bigger than expected and not as pictured."
3.0,One string came bent
3.0,Good for the price. Much more color (pink) than pictured.
3.0,I tried wearing this on a very cold day.  It was too bulky under a navy coat and too long (and bulky) over the coat.  It's pretty but I doubt I'll wear it often.  I can't imagine it being cool enough to wear in the summer.  Poor purchase on my part.
3.0,"Its okay. I love the design but as soon as I got it in the mail, the thing broke! Its very cheap material ! You definitely get what you pay for. I was able to super glue it back together since sending it back would just be a waste of money."
3.0,"Okay gloves. You get what you pay for. I'm glad they're not leather, but they make my hands smell a little bizarre after wearing them for more than 10 minutes."
3.0,"An excellent strap for material and build quality, except how to fasten the excess band to the wrist.  The loops of material you thread the band through and hold the extra strap beyond the adjustment holes are called keepers.  Good bands have two.  A fixed one and a free moving loop.  This band only comes with a single free loop and it is TOO LARGE.  It allows the  extra band to separate from the main band giving the appearance of an oversized belt.  Despite the overall strap lengthy being perfect for my wrist size."
3.0,ALOT BIGGER THEN I NEEDED
3.0,Very beautiful dress..it had a  really good fit.  The quality is ok and you need to iron the dress if you was it.
3.0,Runs small material was cheap
3.0,ring holding gold trim snapped off before I even wore it once
3.0,"Nice color, nice feel, but it does hot hold it's shape and is very droopy and lopsided."
3.0,"Item was bigger than what i expected, but it was nice."
3.0,love it but its way to large I recommend getting a size smaller
3.0,Item is cute but jewel is to big
3.0,No belt in my package. I still like the dress. I don't know if I'm going to keep it or return it.
3.0,The material is too Loosely woven and then love the colors and patterns
3.0,"Jeff & Aimy's Warm, Luxurious Cashmere Feel Winter Scarf for Women (blue cat design) is wonderful-if you are around five to eight years old.<br /><br />The description on this reads a women's scarf, and unfortunately it is not.  This is simply too small to be a woman's scarf-perhaps I could wrap it around my wrists if I get cold?-I am not sure.  This is approximately half the size of what a normal size woman's scarf is.  However, I love the material used.  This is very soft on your skin and does feel good to wear.  The design is really cute.  The stitching of the cat face is very distinct, and the blue color with the white stitching accents is very pretty.  I like the white ball at the end.<br /><br />Overall, I wish I could wear this, alas I am way over the real life age range for this scarf.  I love cats and the color blue so that is a shame.  But this is great for a child in the age range I earlier described who loves cats."
3.0,Cute but the chain feels like it could break at any minute. Feels cheap. And it’s only one size - can’t adjust chain.
3.0,"I have color option 1023, which is the rainbow nebula mask. It has white trim, white elastic, and the inside of the mask is white. The colors are bright in person. I’m a fan of anything with a nebula design, so the print was a plus for me.<br /><br />The mask has two layers: the outer nebula layer and the inner white layer. It does not have a filter pocket or nose wire.<br /><br />The mask passes the candle test.<br /><br />I tried wearing the mask for running a few errands. I had it on for maybe 2 hours (I took it off when driving) and by the end of those 2 hours, my ears really hurt. I thought the design of the elastic, which goes around the head and adjusts via a cord lock, would prevent pressure on my ears.<br /><br />But to get a tight fit on the cheek sides of the mask, I had to pull the elastic pretty tight. So the elastic rested right on the top of my ears and pulled the entire time I wore the mask. A strap extender can’t be used. When I tried to rest the elastic lower on my neck and bypass my ears, the cheeks gaped open and the mask slid down my nose."
3.0,I think the material should be a little bwtter.
3.0,"Loved the logo and feel of the shirt, ended up returning because of the length. Bigger girl but not super huge either. For everywhere else, but I would barely lift my arms over my head, and my stomach was showing. 🙄"
3.0,"While I love the lower rise of this style 90-Degree legging, both pairs I bought (Black and Magenta Haze) are sheer in the rear, unlike the higher-waist version of the capris. They are super-comfortable, though, and I will wear them for lounge wear, but not to yoga."
3.0,"I loved the look but it's very cheaply made. Part of it broke the first time I tried to wear it. I was able to put it back together but it kept breaking off. And no, I'm not rough on jewelry."
3.0,"Love the color and style of the dress. However, the dress was larger than normal size 4T. I ended up ordering a 3T and it was even larger than a 4T. Overall, we ended up rolling her sleeves up since this was for our family pictures. They turned out great and you can’t tell the rolling of sleeves. Sizing sucks but style and color is great."
3.0,Cute but feels very cheap and flimsy
3.0,Beautiful dark green color exactly what I wanted however the cut of the dress is not as pictured. The straps are thicker and the low v neck and back are not low. The cut length of the v neck and back doesn’t bother me but the extra thick straps isn’t what I was looking for. I really wanted a thin strap vs the thicker strap but I will keep it.
3.0,"This is a GORGEOUS, adorable outfit. However I bought an XL and it was so extremely tight on me that I unfortunately had to return it. I'm 5'7', 170 lbs, and can usually wear size large. I would suggest ordering 2 sizes UP with this outfit."
3.0,"They're super cute, and good quality.  Love all the different colors.  My one complaint is that the seam is at the end of the sock, not at the bottom of the toes (on the upper part of the sock) like most socks.  So they bunch up at the end of the shoe, and my daughter has complained a little.  Doesn't stop her from demanding her Minnie Mouse socks though.  I guess her devotion to the Mouse is stronger than her desire to be comfortable. =)"
3.0,These pants were not flowy like in the picture they were super tight and fit more like tighter jean shorts than anything else. They still look fine they just don’t look anything like the picture.
3.0,"Needed new pants for the gym so I ordered two pair of these. Forrest green and dark blue marl size small and medium. Neither are see through! Im 5’6 140lbs, the small is a little tight and the medium fits perfect, I could probably fit a large too they’re very stretchy. The waist band in the small is a little tight which makes it harder to get them on.  I’ve worn them once and got many compliments so I’d say for the price these are a win.  Oh also I got them both within two days of ordering👍"
3.0,For a compression shirt there is not much in the way of compression.  They are great for an undershirt.
3.0,"Quality if fine, the color is off from the picture.<br />This sweatshirt is the color of a pink highlighter not a darker pink like the picture shows. I bought it to make a darker pink bottom and it does not."
3.0,The whole thing is plastic with printing on it. Looks cheap.
3.0,"I have another pair of Tanming wide-legged pants in another fabric and style that I adore, but that are just a tiny bit snug in my regular size (L). I expected these to fit similarly as they are a similar cut, so I ordered a size up (XL) so they would have a bit more ease at the hip (I'm an hourglass shape, 5'6"", 185 lbs, normally size 12/14). These were TINY. I could get them zipped due to the fabric, but they pulled atrociously across the hips, gaped at the pockets, and gave me the dreaded camel-toe fit at the crotch.<br />The plus is that the caramel-color was a bit on the rust-side (you can see that the coloring of the stock photo has been adjusted to make them appear less orange-y) but I took a chance since I was looking for a rusty orange anyway and they met my expectations. Definitely less brown and more orange, though still in-between. I want to love them, but I will honestly have to drop a pant-size to be able to wear them. I was unable to return for a larger size, since I ordered the largest size they had available. I kept because of the very affordable cost and because I am working hard to get in shape. Hopefully I will fit them later in the season."
3.0,They run two or three sizes small. They also sent the wrong one.
3.0,"Nice hat, but the picture doesn't do it justice.  The brim is quite large and a little floppy.  it is not a panama style hat like it looks in the picture."
3.0,"These are absolutely NOT compression tanks and I would not describe them as 'long'. I will wear them under shirts, but I do not think they are the best type of tank for working out. I don't understand the other reviews that describe them as smaller than expected. I ordered up a size based on other reviews and they are loose fitting. I would recommend ordering true to your size and not adjusting your order based on the reviews like I did."
3.0,"I'm 5'10"" & about 178 lbs. I ordered an XL based on reviews that said it was short. It definitely is short. I'm usually a department store M to L. I tried to take a picture of my waist (with my arms up) to show how short it is. I decided to keep it since the peach color & cactus print is so cute. Due to the spaghetti type straps, I have to wear a strapless bracelet if I don't want my bra straps to show."
3.0,These bras are really comfortable and fit well. However the reason for only 3 stars is the removable padding. I absolutely hate that its removable. They constantly fall out in the washer and they always have to be adjusted before putting the bra on. It would have been nice had the padding actually been built into the bra. They also chose really cheap padding that came apart after just a few washes. I ended up buying nicer padding so that was an added cost to these bras. I'm not sure I'd buy these again only because of the padding issues I've mentioned. If it were sewn/built into the bra I would purchase again.
3.0,Good for washing dishes with hot water and good for scrubbing.
3.0,Way too loose on the band disappointed
3.0,I bought this for fun. I have only used it twice so far. Friends have asked were I bought it from.<br />All in all I like it.
3.0,"Nowhere nearly as warm as claimed. Works well in temperatures down to 30s, but not at all in 20s, or lower."
3.0,"Only Three stars because while  they were very cute, these are super super small. You need to have very small nipples to fit through these."
3.0,NICE COLOR I ASKED FOR A LARGE SIZE BECAUSE THE REVIEWS
3.0,Beautiful but too much copper so they tarnish really fast.
3.0,"This is more polyester looking, and therefore I was disappointed. I thought it would be more  of a cotton look or flowy. But nope...looked like my mom would wear it..kinda like a Chicos knockoff. I got the animal print and returned it...tried two sizes and both looked bad."
3.0,"The pink in photo  is not what u get. Also its a tad bit thin. The pink that u get, you'll  need sonethibg over it. The length  was good."
3.0,I did pretty much understand that what was called “white” was not really white which you can appreciate in my photo against my white shirt. I’d call this color almost shy of a pale yellow. Not my fav - I do like cream but I wouldn’t call this cream (or white).<br />For the price the quality and material is ok.<br />It fits well - sleeves fit me well without being too long (I do not have long arms so be aware of that)<br />I got a small and glad I did. I can wear anywhere from xs to s.<br />I have a very long torso. In my second pic you can see it does go down past my hips so a good length.
3.0,The L/XL is small the XXL is huge take your pick
3.0,Extremely small stones which do not appear to be very clear.
3.0,it's a nice looking dress. very comfortable. the description says cotton blend but the tag says 100% viscose. It was a little disappointing to find out it wasn't cotton. the buttons are only for decoration. has a hidden zipper on side. can be worn dressed down or up depending on accessories. the one thing I didn't like is the sewing alot of loose or hanging thread. overall nice and comfortable dress.
3.0,"Ordered my regular size but they were to small!  Was disappointed, gave them to my daughter!"
3.0,They are beautiful. I just like my lip rings shorter but these ones didn’t give a size. They’re a bit longer meant for bigger lips than mine I guess. Still worth the money though.
3.0,"Very light weight, which is good. But like the majority of the reviews…it’s almost transparent. Great for an undershirt."
3.0,Needed something to cover up a bad hair day and this was okay.
3.0,"Super cute, but has no stretch to the fabric. When I move or reach I feel like the fabric might rip. Hasn’t yet, but you never know."
3.0,Made small so order up a size. Also pattern not really as pictured
3.0,When ordering the color looked like it was a deeper gold color than the lighter version I received.  WILL make it work.
3.0,Definitely not for pregnant women. However if you just need an unhappy of two after the holidays they work fine
3.0,"These are cute but bigger than I would like. They are OK for walking a bit but not far. My feel slide in them as they are quite wide. I have semi-wide feet (I occasionally need the wide version of shoes but not often) and these just had too much wiggle once on. The shaft was also big, not huge but I have a wide calf and these are bigger than I would like. Also, the dots are more oval over the foot and then change to dots on the shaft. They keep you dry, but aren't great for wearing very far due to poor fit and are cheap looking."
3.0,"Good material, cute style, but a little too large fit for my frame. I am a size small and it fits me like a large."
3.0,"This T-shirt is on the thin side and you can see through the material. I wanted it for nighttime, so it's okay with me. But for daytime wear, I like a thicker material.<br /><br />The neck is a bit wide and the sleeve cuffs are sewn into that configuration. The size is a bit small but being thinner, you can stretch it out as needed."
3.0,The size was not accurate my wife is 5'2 123 lbs and she has to use an xl and the didn't fit that well.
3.0,This looked like a prison suit when on but it was so comfortable I decided to keep it to wear at home where no one will see me
3.0,"Very pretty, but muuuch larger than I expected! It’s about the size of the necklaces flavor flav used to wear. Overall, very pretty, just embarrassed to wear it in public due to it’s ginormous size."
3.0,"I wanted to love it but the fit is very square so not super flattering for a woman. But the reason I returned it was the black/orange color was more of a black/light yellow and so it didn't go well with my snow pants.  I'm 5'9"", 160lbs and large fit, but not a ton of space for layers."
3.0,Have had a few feathers come off and the feathers were already sparse.  Had to purchase more feathers to fill it all in.
3.0,Quality of the leather isn’t what I expected.
3.0,"Loved the color, but it was waaaaay too small for my average sized head...23-24 inches in diameter (depending on my hairstyle).  The color and quality was awesome, but I had to donate it to goodwill.  I should have returned it but just didn't bother. Be sure to double check the sizing prior to placing an order."
3.0,"Sweater is beautifully made/color is subtle but elegant. Returned it because of strange sizing. Sleeves were too short, yet rest of sweater too big/baggy fit. Shame....good value for a beautiful sweater but sizing is bizarre."
3.0,"I received the wrong size and color but the cloak itself is nice, sad I won’t be able to use it."
3.0,This product looks different in person and I had to return. I did not like the thin material and look of the outfit.
3.0,"Its pretty... from afar, the tulle is very stiff which is nice to keep shape, but the lace detailing around the edge is cut haphazardly, there is pieces of tulle hanging on by a thread. Im keep this veil only because of the weight/its the exact style I want for a decent price. Just needs some work and it will be perfect. Still kinda disappointed..."
3.0,Were kinda small on me. My hips measure 40in and I am 38 weeks preggo Otherwise they are great. Keep ya cool in the summer. Cool design material is very thin.
3.0,The solid plastic pieces don't work at all-waste of money. The coil wraps keep my wrongs in place but are a bit awkward.
3.0,I read all reviews and got a large. I could have gotten a medium. The length is weird on me as im 5 feet tall it falls funny. I im not too fond of the dress but itll serve its purpose. Im very curvy so if ur planning on getting this dress go a size down
3.0,Wanted to love the dress. The dress itself is beautiful and fit perfectly except the arm strap. Given I have larger arms just felt a little tight and lift arms would make them red.
3.0,I bought this thinking it was similar to previous purchases and was surprised that the material was super itchy and the size was a little larger than expected. Such a bummer I normally really love this brand so I'll definitely give it another shot
3.0,"I ordered one in black a few months ago and LOVED it...exactly as pictured (high quality chiffon). Ordered another in brown but very different from pictured and nothing like the one I received the first time: cheap material, stitching shows, wrap stitched (rather than snap) high and then a huge gap to the front bottom..."
3.0,"I was a bit dissappointed to be honest .<br />The flowers are a bit bigger than I expected , they look huge on my one month olds head ,but they'll probably look better when she's older but I'm afraid the headbands will be too tight by then , they don't look exactly like  they do in the picture but they're still pretty cute and I will still be using them for my daughter"
3.0,"Extremely thin fabric. I wear a 14, ordered a large and I believe I would have needed at least an XXL"
3.0,"Comfy but see through, had to buy something for underneath and bones lined up weird"
3.0,"Clip-ons are okay, however they are too thick and bulky. They shade my eyes from the sun so product works as intended."
3.0,"Purchased for my wife and she probably won't wear it much. Once you tie the front is quite a bit shorter than anticipated. Otherwise not a bad product, she just wishes it was a bit longer."
3.0,"great design for smaller figures, the top provides ZERO support. if the straps were adjustable i would give this a 5 star rating because the material and color are to die for!!! but  not good if you have larger than a c cup!"
3.0,Great shirt but runs small. I bought it for my 13 year old but it’s too tight so my younger child is going to wear it.
3.0,Item was thin and was too long for my husband. I bought this as a gift for him. Returned item
3.0,The ring looked more like it should be on your toe and not on your finger.
3.0,"Not leather, way too big for right now but they are so cute."
3.0,"The fabric used is rather scratchy, which isn't fun if you're wearing this for pj's. I don't know about you, but I like really soft fabrics to sleep in. I haven't washed it yet, so here's to hoping it gets softer after a few washings. If it changes, I'll update this review.<br /><br />The size was okay. Yeah, I know it says ""off shoulder"" but it's a little more ""off shoulder"" than I like."
3.0,"There were fir a costume, so they were fine for that. Otherwise, the material is pretty cheap."
3.0,It is very good quality! It’s the second time I buy it!
3.0,Very cute and dainty but turned my neck green and made my neck itch :(
3.0,Very nice piece for casual wear
3.0,cute but way too small. the 2x fits my teen whos a size 11 juniors.
3.0,Nice dress but too small. I have to return it.
3.0,They're okay but they don't have backs???
3.0,"I really like the design and fit of this piece. However, it arrived with one of the gemstones missing and the shape of the clicker itself is quite crooked, so it's hard to wear without it looking lopsided. Would have given 5 stars if it looked just like the picture."
3.0,This item suited the needs of pleasing an 11 year old who is a big fan of the Hunger Games franchise. The price was reasonable. The necklace however was not even close to what was shown in the product photo. As you can see from the photo it was chunky and the mocking jay was placed differently. The thin bronze chain shown in the product photo was actually a thick silver colored chain. The whole item looked a little on the cheap side.
3.0,Was not flattering on me.
3.0,"pretty, but cheap, thin material, ran small, and the zipper on the size puckered and didn't quite match the colour of the rest of the dress."
3.0,Bought these shorts as an experiment for wear to work. Wore them around the house and they are very comfortable. The downfall is that they are so thin and cheaply made that o ripped holes in them putting my hands in the pockets. Very disappointed in the quality of this product. I will not be purchasing a 2nd pair.<br /><br />After contacting the seller they are doing what they can to make it right. Outstanding people and great service!
3.0,"Saw a picture of this romper and bought it on impulse without thinking to read any of the reviews first. I am typically a size 12-14 with a 34in waist and 40in hip. Ordered a xxl.<br /><br />Received it and was very pleased with the quality of the product.<br /><br />This romper however, was WAY too small and rode up in places that I didn't even know I had and feeling a little bit like a Natalie Imbruglia song.<br /><br />It's really too bad. It was pretty fabulous otherwise.<br /><br />Buyer be ware. This thing runs SMALL."
3.0,A little smaller than what the size said but fits ok overall. The image does seem more pleated from the front than what I got but it’s still ok to wear .
3.0,I ordered and received the 2x. I’m normally a large to xl in hoodies and jackets but based on the slim fit style I ordered up. I can not fully close this jacket. It has zero stretch. The material is thick and soft on the inside but it is not made for women with curves. I will keep it because I am on a weight loss journey but be warned order at least a full size up.
3.0,"It's a decent hat, however, the material is not what I expected and it has one of those crapy plastic hooks in the back. If you truly love Ruger as I do, it's worth the money."
3.0,"Little girls like the look of the shoe, but the toe wears out quickly"
3.0,The hat itself is cute. They rolled it up to ship it though and I can’t get it to reshape so it doesn’t look good on me. Looks great on a desk or on the wall as a decoration
3.0,Time wise this watch seems to be spot on. But very early on (say 4-6 months) the strap began to separate. It was still wearable so I let it go. This a.m.  the adjustable strap loop just broke. Just from using it.  Bulova has long been noted for it's quality assurance but this strap belies that reputation.
3.0,"The design of the apron is nice, but the quality is definitely lacking. It also seems to run small. If you're over 6 feet tall then this apron is definitely not for you."
3.0,true to size and pretty but very tiny - perfect girl for a little girl.
3.0,its a little heavy for a lady. but its a beautiful watch
3.0,Too bad this wasn’t true to size.  Seemed like a nice shirt
3.0,Too short I am 5'10
3.0,"I love Very Bradley, I have many wallets and purses, but i am highly disappointed about this wallet.  The zipper and lining do not match up so all my coins continue to fall out, so I have to make a conscience decision to make sure it is facing up when I  put in my pocket or purse."
3.0,Super cute boots but the pull tags on the top of the heel both snapped off the first time I pulled the boots on. They look cute without them though !
3.0,Did not look the same as the picture and size was a bit inaccurate.
3.0,El el ruedo del pantalón tiene otro color no me gusto
3.0,They smell awful! Washing to see if it helps but possibly returning them
3.0,**update**<br />I think my initial review was made in haste and I wanted to correct it. There are 4 pairs of earring in this set and not all of them are loose. In fact I think the “feather” ones are beautiful & fit much better than the ones with the crystals. The 3 stars pair are also lovely and the stars with the dangling star on them are super cute & I've gotten compliments on them. The ones that I tried on first before making my first review are the loosest and I wish they fit better but the rest of them are lovely.
3.0,"XL usually fits me,but this XL ran a little smaller.I was still  able to wear it as long as I didn't have to lift my arms over my head."
3.0,The design is great but the chain is really short and kind of plastic-feeling. I have a pretty slender neck but still have to go to the end of the extender to wear this necklace and not choke myself.
3.0,Elastic broke shortly after we got them
3.0,"Perfect size anf decent quantity, the zippers are just cheaply made."
3.0,"This shirt is cheaply made and the style and fit are crazy. Huge in the shoulders and top of sleeves,way too tight in the tummy."
3.0,My 3 year old son loves these gloves but they don't really fit and they are pretty poor quality. I probably wouldn't buy them again but they were fun for him to play with for a little while. If they had elastic they would be better. I had to put one of my hair ties over the wrist part so it would stop falling off and frustrating him.
3.0,"Material causes them to slide down a lot. Hard to work out pulling your leggings up every 10 seconds. Phone pocket feature is nice, though."
3.0,I normally wear a 1X possibly 2X depending. I saw people said to size up so I ordered a 3X. It was quite small in the bust (36DD) I returned and got a 4X. Fits just right. It's cute but the material is thin. Can't beat the price though!
3.0,"Used once, gave them away! Too slippery for me to walk."
3.0,"Very pink, more than the picture shows.  But other than that, great sunglasses, I was just looking for more darkness at the top."
3.0,"Cute, however, too big. The cold shoulder side slips off. It is nice and long. Not what I expected since I ordered a small in another style from the same company and it fit okay. I will keep it since I think it is okay around the house or grocery shopping, but not so cute when it is so big on me. I won't wear it to work again. It is nice and cool to wear on those in-between days that start out cold and end up warm in southern CA."
3.0,Simple top with an iron on decal... took a long time to arrive 2-3weeks
3.0,"A little thick and v neck is not very low, a bit awkward in placement."
3.0,It is a ok but it is not made for all types of people to wear even though it is clear.
3.0,Pretty dress but would be better in another fabric
3.0,"I like this brand, but the opposite I just got had a red elastic waistband, as opposed to a black one like the picture. I'll keep them and wear them, but I don't like the look as much, and I feel misled."
3.0,"Invisible strapless bras aren't made for big boobied women. I am in-between a c and d cup currently. I ordered a d cup and they still seem somewhat small to me. It takes a few tries to get the perfect fit when sticking this thing on. It works for when you really don't have any other options available.

3.0,Too wide for a dress belt. Made in China.
3.0,Not as plush as shown and bottom super thin.<br />Probably won’t last through the winter<br />I’d order a higher price point next time
3.0,Purchased Feb 2017 and in Dec 2018 the buckle broke for good.  Not sure if I would buy again.
3.0,"Nice soft and light fabric, but it does have a good stretch to it, so it may seem like it runs large. Returned and bought a smaller size. Easily wearable for the summer with a  tank and sandals for a casual and flowy look. I wear a 6-8, so I opted for the medium, and even though I would wear it as high waisted, it ran on the bigger side."
3.0,Chain doesn't really work with pendant but for the price?  Worth it (needed eaight more words so this it it:)
3.0,"The size runs small. I'm a US medium, 30&#34; waist, 36&#34; hips. I was able to put them on but it's tight and my belly bulged out (no, no, no, lol). The fabric is thick and there's not a lot of elasticity, the label says 92% cotton and only 8% spandex. They look exactly like the picture. Some of the reviews are totally misleading. It's a keeper but I will exchange to an XL size, it's 92% cotton it will definitely shrink after washing."
3.0,should have bought a 2xl it would have work fine for an xtra large it was basically a size smaller so if you are a large buy xtra large if you xtra large buy 2xl
3.0,Fits a little tight on top and the quality is ok but nothing special
3.0,"Soooooo cute, but too small."
3.0,"I wanted a way to honor my 28 years of Army service.  The pin seemed to fill the bill.<br />Unfortunately, on arrival I found that the cost to ship the pin was more than the cost of the pin.<br />Lesson learned."
3.0,A little small but like the material
3.0,way too heavy of a material
3.0,"This wig matched the Romeo costume that I needed for Halloween. However the wig was too small to be for an adult head. At least an adult that was not bald. There was no elasticity in the wig, it was hard netting with no stretch. The wig itself is pretty stiff as well. Granted Romeo’s hair is supposed to stick straight up but there was no way to make the wig look full. It served its purpose but it was not worth the price."
3.0,The sweater is a bit large and the material is the same material as Halloween costumes or a robe.  Not really sure if I will wear it again.
3.0,The string on the back side wasn’t long enough to tie properly. And the back upper part for awkwardly on me. The dress fit fine but the back is what ruined it for me.
3.0,Runs small. I should've ordered a size up.
3.0,The fabric is very stiff and not stretchy at all.  I am not sure if it will soften up in the laundry or not?
3.0,"First of all, order two sizes up.  I wore this dress to a wedding for one day.  The threading came out.  Like half of the beading fell off.  I ended up having to trash it after one use, but it was beautiful while it lasted!  I'm a 16 and ordered size 20."
3.0,Well made but it's not leather!
3.0,Bought to keep feet warm during winter.
3.0,"This tote is smaller than I expected.  The stitching at the main side seams is flimsy (you can see daylight through the stitching).  However, it is a sturdy bag and the leather is very pliable and weather-proofed.  I got caught in a rain/sleet storm yesterday and the leather held up, no water spots."
3.0,"The product it’s self is worth the price, perfect size, great look and quality. I don’t like that I only received 95 charms and they vary in the number of Each Number you get i.e; I received 18 number 8s and 3 number 4s."
3.0,Upper arms were very tight while the rest of it fit just fine.
3.0,Jumpsuit is nice but very light material and low cut
3.0,I am giving it a 3 because even though my children love it..the pin has already broken off the ring that held it to the boogie bomb. It was cheap plastic and not a sturdy metal.
3.0,"Pretty thin, and too big for my head.  I have had to take it up with safety pins to use it.  I am an average-sized woman."
3.0,"One of the seams started tearing out before we even got to wash it. Other than that, the person we gave this to likes the sweatshirt."
3.0,The color on the band immediately started to wear off. Quality isn't good.
3.0,I wore this shirt under a cycling bib while riding a race over 20 miles and when I returned I noticed the sleeves felt a bit wet.  It was because the material is not dry wick.  My arms were cold and I could feel the moisture in the sleeves.  I will be returning this product.  I thought I would share this information for people who may use this item during the winter months.
3.0,"Unlike other reviewers, the size I wear is the correct size for this shirt for me.  But it does cling tightly in the arms which I figure is because of the spandex.  It's pretty and fits reasonably well, but it's not the most comfortable shirt.  I don't like the waist at all.  It's gathered in this weird way that makes the bottom roll up.  The fabric is super soft.  The neckline is nice (and I don't usually like v-necks).  It is super lightweight so even though it is long sleeved it will not provide much protection against cold weather and wind."
3.0,I love it..didnt come brown...came o.d.green..like it anyway...kinda dont stay in place
3.0,Cute!!! But heavy. Ouch!!!!
3.0,"Love(d) these pants. Still wear them and are great, EXCEPT the wide elastic band that makes the waist so great folds in half. So, you lose that feature and could’ve purchased numerous other options with a regular waist band. Could be fixed if you have the time to see it on at the top and/or bottom but who has the time (or skills or energy) for that?"
3.0,"I liked the material, but not the fit for my body shape."
3.0,"They arrived and several pairs don't work.  But the ones that do have been fun to use.  Achieved the fun, holiday look that I was after."
3.0,This blazer is lightweight and cute but did require ironing out of the package and is much larger than I anticipated. Also the pockets are not useable as they are sewn shut. It is a cute blazer for mild weather and very fashionable.
3.0,"Ordered theses for my daughter she loves the butterfly ones. I thought I was suppose to get a pair of pink studs but they sent a clear, a blue, and a multicolored pair. Which wasn’t what was in the picture. Not even worth breaking her heart and sending them back"
3.0,I was already expecting these to be small for me so I wasnt exactly banking on them being what their title description is... but at the very least they stay up even if they give me a bit of  leg muffin top! And they havent gotten stretched to where they become loose so that's also a good sign for long term I guess.
3.0,Great value but a little too dark for night driving.
3.0,The pearls and logo are all cheap quality. It’s better than nothing but shouldn’t be worth $40
3.0,The package came open and the wand was not package as in the picture
3.0,"Dress sleeves were small making the dress very uncomfortable, hence i return the dress.<br />The color was beautiful though."
3.0,Next size larger they run small
3.0,"Boot a a gift, the silver finish has already worn off. The look and function of the bracelet is great though."
3.0,"I love the pattern. However it is small, even the bill."
3.0,La tela es muy delgada. Pensé que iba a ser un poco mas gruesita. Realmente parece solo diafraz y no traje de baño como tal
3.0,What size are these intended for? An adult medium that should fit is like an adult small/x small. I'd order 2 sizes up if getting one. I mean it's cute just way too small for the size I bought.
3.0,It's cute but does not fit well with the shape of my belly button.
3.0,I felt like the material was very thin. The top was wider than it needed to be. Would look nicer tailored under the armpits.
3.0,"I thought I was getting something more leather looking. It is not. It's more plastic than I wanted.  However on a good note, it has a lot of room and pockets which is exactly what I was looking for."
3.0,to small...good for kids party...look really nice...the material is ok.
3.0,They do fit over eye glasses very well.
3.0,Jacket was more boxy fit than I liked. Material was okay more lightweight so it wrinkled easily.
3.0,I love the idea of these shoes but after trying 3 to get the right size I gave up. I truly wanted them to work for me but the sizing seems all over the board
3.0,coarse material is a bit uncomfortable on the skin.
3.0,I ordered this for something light to throw over sleeveless outfits in summer as I liked the style. I have broad shoulders and it kind of made them look worse. Hence returned it back.
3.0,"Luckily I know how to use sowing machine and also luckily dress had small panel on chest, behind the buttons. So I was able to make it work. It is pretty, but I wish they would have XXXL. I  am 6' tall and 239 punds. If it would of been XXXL, it would fit perfectly..."
3.0,They are very thin if that's what you are looking for.
3.0,My 5 year old wouldn’t wear it saying it was a little too tight.
3.0,"The top part didn’t stay folded down easily, so it’s always needing to be adjusted.  Other than that, it’s cute. The fabric is soft and forgiving."
3.0,"It is a cheap quality for the chain. However, it did look good when I wear it on a black sweater. when I wore it the first time, it is broken. But given the fact that it looks good for my sweater, I will give 3 star."
3.0,"The set was cute it came in a cute little jewelry bag, material seemed to be sturdy. The ring fit perfectly for a size 5 finger however the earrings on the other hand, were not. The stud broke while trying to put the backing on."
3.0,"I'll keep buying these because they look great and are very inexpensive. However, the hinges are super weak, and the threads that hold on the hinges wear out, leading to loose screws and and easily bent frame. By the time they reach that point is usually around the time I lose them, though.<br /><br />I figure 3-4 of these per year is still way cheaper than the big brand name ones, and I'm bound to lose those at some point."
3.0,"Pants are comfortable, seem to be well made except the front button isn't sewn on well at all. I took them out of the package, went to unbutton and the threads snapped and are now barely hanging on."
3.0,Nice for the money! About what you should expect. Nice color
3.0,Super cute but nearly impossible to clasp together once you get them in
3.0,a bit small but okay
3.0,its as advertised....but very shiny.....not exactly what I was looking for......but it is a nice chain.
3.0,I ordered bigger and it was still too small. It works good as a nightshirt anyway. I like the material.
3.0,Used them in birthday treat bags and at Halloween. Several of them did not work but kids were excited to get them.
3.0,The material is very nice  but I wouldn’t buy again because the neckline does not lay flat. It has the look of being stretched out. I’ll probably return it.
3.0,Pants fit great however the buttons fell off of the pants before I could try them on.
3.0,"These are great for the price but they do not hold larger pieces of jewelry (like a cuff) They did take quite a while to ship but I knew that when I saw they were shipping from China.  Colors are pretty,"
3.0,"The large was way too big, it was more like a 2XL than a large."
3.0,"The axe is great, but the plaque is a cheap piece of wood with Home Depot screws. Nothing like what is pictured. No offer was made to replace from seller."
3.0,Liked the sparkle sad it was all plastic and not rhinestones.
3.0,Love the look just absolutely hate how they're literally flat. Usually there's son kind of curve to shape your face but these don't have it. Whatever for the price tho.
3.0,"Fabric is pretty good. Way too small! I would order 3 times bigger for an adult, 2 times for a boy."
3.0,"They were very nice, but too small for size 10, I gave them to a friend"
3.0,"my son loves it...its broken from chain first day,"
3.0,They are cute and cheap but the button ripped before my son could wear them
3.0,"These sunglasses come in a great variety of colors and are stylish.  I originally ordered them for my husband but ended up giving them to my son because they are very narrow, more of a young teen fit than adult.  My son loved them though!  These might work for an adult with a very narrow head/face but otherwise, I think they are perfect for kids.  And they are at the price point where would certainly order them in other colors for my kids.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.<br /><br />Update:  after less than a week of use, one of the nose cushions fell off."
3.0,"They are a little tight, and I even ordered the next size up."
3.0,"Not the best fit in the world and it's very cheaply made, but hey...it looks cool!"
3.0,Very small 14 month old
3.0,I'm giving this 3 stars because they are way too big comfortably fit the average sized ear. I ordered one for my daughter and one for myself. Neither of us was able to successfully wear them. We tried bending and shaping but nothing worked. Very pretty to look at though. Just waaaay too big.
3.0,"Really cute, just too small for me. DEFINITELY order up at least one size."
3.0,"It was an adorable outfit. However, it was purple instead of the reddish coloring shown in the picture. I ended up returning as it was meant for family pictures and didn’t work."
3.0,Wasn't quite as stylish as expected but will work fine for a tote to stow under the seat when flying. Probably wouldn't purchase again
3.0,Very nice but doesn't stay in place.
3.0,"The top was too small, bottoms were just right."
3.0,The writing on the outside is unnecessary and makes it seem cheap. The zipper seemed a but cheap. The color is great and you can fit a ton of cards and money into the slots.
3.0,"There is no extra fabric around the waist, as pictured.  I would order AT LEAST one size bigger than you usually do."
3.0,"The material feels a little like burlap, and the arms are a little too snug.<br />The rest of the fit was roomy.  It's cute if you wear it over something very thin but definitely not the best made product."
3.0,Unable to comfortably open clip. Arthritis of hands.
3.0,Funky Design. Looked funny on me.
3.0,It feels inexpensive. It’s not a thick bag
3.0,Shirt came in and it’s a bright orange..... nothing like the photos......
3.0,the blue stone is almost white color disapointment
3.0,Not as loose and full around the stomach as it should be for a plus size garment.
3.0,Didn't like the plastic crystal
3.0,Giving it 3 stars because it digs into your skin under your boobs.  Arm size perfect just firm enough . not great for big breasted women it will dig into the sides of your breasts as well.
3.0,The blouse is cute but way too small. I wear a ladies large or extra large and the 3xx looks like a medium.  I'm going to see if one of my friends wants it and if they don't I'm sending it back.
3.0,Cute but cheap quality. I'm not mad at it.
3.0,"Cheap material,It feels snug at the top and the elastic is to high,waste of money"
3.0,Great price and shipped early 👍 Trouble is there were no instructions and you have to purchase separate install equipment like putty tape and screws.
3.0,"Should this umbrella come with screws? The package only contains the umbrella, a lower stem, and two foundation legs. I don't know what type of screws I should purchase separately?"
3.0,"This is cute, but runs a little small. It is NOT a sweater. I don't like the material. It's very thin and light, kind of a jersey/nylon feel. One side in slightly longer than the other in the front too. Just okay."
3.0,I received this product but it stinks like mildew.  I had to take it to the cleaners to get the smell out. It didn't work.  I am now putting this in a vacuum bag with a bunch of dryer sheets suck the air out and will leave it till next winter.
3.0,I'm a size 00 or 0 and 32B cup size and size small was a little big. The bottoms were perfect but the top was not as expected and the color was off. I ordered the red one and I ended up with a hot pink somehow. would be good if it was smaller.
3.0,Diameter of the backs is too small for the button holes of my shirt.
3.0,I've bought others and they seem to fit better.
3.0,i use  this  coat  for  cold  weather.
3.0,"The battery pack was bigger than expected and was not shown as part of the pictures. If I knew about the battery pack, I would not have purchased it. In addition, the suspenders had some rough corners that proved to be itchy and uncomfortable."
3.0,It's a bit to small
3.0,Runs very small. I'm an 18 and aftercreadjngvrevirws ordered the 5x. It's adorable but def snug. Order way up!
3.0,"The red hat was large, but the black hat was small."
3.0,He loved it. It’s not sturdy though and broke a week after being on his keychain.
3.0,"My face is normal and almost all wayfeir fir on my face. These are bigger and little bit on heavier side for me. Still, I am not returning because I have all others in smaller size and keeping this as one bigger pair for myself."
3.0,Very small sizing but beautiful embroidery!
3.0,Very cute hat but it is a little small on my five year old daughter.
3.0,The overall look and design of the dress is really nice. I do like how it looks on me but the dress does fit a little bigger on me than expected. The material is good quality. It is comfortable. I am not sure why they want me to rate the thickness because this is not the thickest dress/material. Other than that I do like the dress. It maybe my own body but the dress does feel larger than what I expected. But of course it still looks good and I've been wearing it if the weather permits.
3.0,"If you are in need of a cheap pair of glasses this is a great option. You receive 3 lenses: Sunglasses, shooting/night, and clear. The included case holds everything nicely, comes with a bag to hold the extra lenses, a cloth to clean the glasses and a strap you connect to each arm to hang the glasses from your neck.<br /><br />A little about me and sunglasses, so you will get an idea of where I am coming from while reviewing these glasses. I have used Oakley sunglasses for the last 25 years and not much else. So it has been something of a novelty to try these out.<br /><br />I first tried the yellow lens to see what it was like to use for nighttime driving. They obviously added yellow to everything, but I think it was a bit too much and I didn't notice much of a change in contrast like one would expect from these and the glare was fairly bad as well.<br /><br />Next was the red sunglass lens and they block out light to the degree I like from my sunglasses. I was not sure about the frame not being placed at the top of the lens like normal sunglasses and light coming in from the top, and I have only experienced it a few times and only briefly. The only thing I noticed that I disliked was that they distort images from any electronic display to varying degrees based on the type of display. I have not seen this before.<br /><br />Changing the lenses are fairly easy when you have done it a few times, be sure to have the cleaning cloth ready as you will need to wipe the lenses clean after you have finished.<br /><br />PROs<br />Lightweight<br />Included Accessories<br />Multiple lenses<br /><br />CONs<br />Distorts electronic displays<br />Some light can get in from the top as there is no frame there.<br />Yellow lens adds too much yellow and doesn't add nearly enough contrast and glare is excessive.<br />Lenses are not Polarized.<br />The Sunglass lens contains Mercury.<br /><br />Overall, these are fairly nice for the price and will last if you take care of them. I have only used these for a couple of weeks so my experience is still limited."
3.0,"The product was alot smaller than I had expected, but I still think its cute! I have enjoyed wearing it."
3.0,"This band looks nice, but not only is it extremely heavy (adding weight to an already heavy watch), but it was a pain to put on. Most bands just pop in, but this one had to be aligned just perfectly as it was cut to the exact size needed, not a little bit smaller like most watch bands."
3.0,Silky material is okay but would have preferred more of a cotton blended material. Ordered XL for looser fit but it runs small. Wouldn’t recommend purchasing.
3.0,Very big.  Gave to next door neighbor.
3.0,"Such a cute dress but as soon as you use the belt that comes with it, it’s extremely short In the back. The belt is a must because it’s a pretty roomy dress and the stitch line across the front was crooked so the belt was needed to cover it up. Unfortunately I will be returning because of the the length."
3.0,It's OK. It fits ok. I thought it was going to be more fitting in the neck area. Some people ask me if I got it in Shein. Maybe is a lot cheaper there. 🤔 Not sure if I pay too much then. I would recommend more research.
3.0,Was expecting all shirts to be the same athletic fabric... the black ones were cotton. Not my kids favorite.
3.0,The top fits my daughter perfectly and is super cute. The scarf is also nice. The pants however are a bit short and they are a bit baggier than expected.
3.0,Well these are poorly made in my opinion. Looks like it's all plastic and was painted. The spikes are obviously just painted gold and the gold even runs off into the black paint. I don't even know how they go on my ears. Looks like there is no space for my ear at all. Maybe far away no one will notice.
3.0,Loved them just smaller than what I expected.
3.0,not what the picture showed
3.0,I thought material was more giving and easier to move with you. Sleepwear should be more comfortable and go with your flow. I wore it so I'll keep it. Just not sexy or thrilling as it looked on line.
3.0,Basic earring. Not much to say about it. Wife only wore them a couple times.
3.0,I would like this better if it tucked in at the waist a little. It kind of hung off of me like a sack and my friends safety-pinned it in the back to give it a more hourglass silhouette.
3.0,Little too long
3.0,Make sure you indicate what side you are snapping too. My skulls were upside down had to twist them ( not easy).
3.0,"**Buy it if you’re willing to take the risk of a few losses**<br />-1 pink gummy bear missing (lost of profit of me selling one pair of earrings)<br />-1 piece malfunctioned (missing the letter “t” in sweet<br />-1 lolipop has black stains on it.<br />-some pieces are mis-shaped.<br />Over all 3 pairs of earrings at lost.<br />Cheap price, but count and check each piece if you decide to order."
3.0,Looks nice but the chain crimps horribly. It's supposed to be a gift and I hope it doesn't crimp as much once on him or I'm going to be very embarrassed. It's smaller than I expected but the stainless steal is nice and it looks great other than the crimping.
3.0,These fit well and are cute!! But go commando or wear white underwear with these because you can see any color through them!
3.0,"The cut is very boxy, so it wasn't very flattering and I ended up returning it. Cute concept, though!"
3.0,Cute but they are a little see through.
3.0,boots were just okay
3.0,"Very cute combat style boots. They are a little difficult to get on and off. Overall they are comfortable, but a tad on the narrow side. Materials are very light weight, not sure how they will hold up. I have worn them several times and so far so good."
3.0,"Pretty, but I had to return...said it had 70 pearls, but only had 52...I counted.  and the photo showed it gently draping.  I could not get it clasped around my neck...more like a choker.  I might order it in a longer size.  It was very pretty."
3.0,Description says it fits up to 36C. I am a 36B and it is tight. Would definitely size up if you purchase.  The bra itself if of good quality and I like the thicker straps. Hoping it will stretch out over time.
3.0,I really liked these but had to return because the part under the ankle kept cutting into my skin and was too uncomfortable to walk in. Size wise I am normally a 9 but as others recommended I sized up to a 10 and they fit my feet perfectly. I will definitely give this shoe brand another try but this particular style just didn't work for me.
3.0,The sleeves on this sweater are a bit awkward and the color is not true to what is shown. I got more of a dark Army olive green instead.
3.0,"The material was very nice, wide pant leg. I usually wear 1-2 xl but because I wanted a baggy look and to make sure pant leg was loose ordered 3xl. Pants arrived without delay, problem was they looked like size small at the most medium- to achieve the look as the pictures. When ordering I didn't pay close attention is 3xl was Asian or us size. Because they were too small I had to return them, which was a bit sad because I really like the material. Yes, I did check the tag to make sure there was no mix up in size."
3.0,Me gustó el modelo del vestido pero esperaba más calidad de tela
3.0,"good quality, but was too small"
3.0,For the price you get what you get when you don’t take it off periodically your skin starts to deteriorate
3.0,Not flattering in the butt. Kinda made it look long and flat. Not for me.
3.0,They are too tight . The magnet is so uncomfortable
3.0,"A little heavy in the weight of material, although I like that it is long."
3.0,"Designs are great, super soft too. 2 of the gaitors have super wide rims (a good 2 inches wider than the others) and don’t fit my sons face and fall off. So only 2 of the 4 are actually useful which stinks."
3.0,I ordered two of these one was from Relipop one from some other company. Totally different. I don't think it was fair that i received something different from what i have paid for
3.0,"I like this small MP3 module - easy to use (manually) and the sound quality is decent.<br /><br />I'd recommend some improvements:<br /><br />1) Put some headers on the board so one can (easily) connect the buttons to external controllers - I had to solder wires to the ends of the tiny button connections so I could interface this with a NodeMCU (or Arduino) for my purposes.  It was a pain in the butt, but I managed.<br /><br />2) Ability to set boot options (that are stored/remembered for the next boot).  The default on boot is that it starts playing the first .mp3 file on the card - that seems daft to me.  The default should be no sound on boot, and that you trigger the playing of .mp3s by pressing the button - or at least have a way to toggle that (perhaps with a couple of header pins on the board).<br /><br />3) Include some documentation with the board - there is none.  There are locations to solder battery connections (BAT+ and BAT-) on the board - and one ASSUMES that, because the default power source is USB, that 5v is what's needed, the same could be said of other boards (e.g. some ESP8266) that are 3.3v and would be fried if you applied 5v to VCC.<br /><br />4) It would also be great to be able to access the button functions via the micro-USB port programmatically - perhaps there is, but with no documentation, no one knows."
3.0,Stretches out a little too easy.
3.0,"The finish wears off kind of quick on this keychain. It needs to be more durable. It has a certain cool factor about it, and I would rate it a lot higher if it would just hold up over time."
3.0,"I had to resew three of the straps before wearing them - there was so little thread holding them closed they never would have lasted a single wear. The cotton of the tanks are very soft and comfortable, though, and are great for the summer. I'm 180 lbs and I purchased a size small; I wear them as undershirts so I like them a little snug. But at 5'2&#34; they're definitely too long - I had to hem all of them so they weren't reaching the tops of my thighs!"
3.0,"This is a very cute product, but as many other people have stated, it runs small. I got the XXL, and I'd say it fits like a L maybe almost like an XL. Really, that was fine, what I really have a problem with are the sleeves. The sleeves are very small, and because of the material there isn't really a lot of give to it. Also, the seam where the armpit should be isn't in the right spot so it doesn't really fit in the right place either. I still love this, it's very cute, but I might end up having to sell this item and find something else that fits the way I like"
3.0,"Loved the style for my son, but this sweatshirt looked terrible after 1 wash. The already small fit got smaller, and the material inside prevents you from trying to stretch it out. My son still wears it but it's definitely not as good quality as Adidas usually is."
3.0,had to send back too small
3.0,"Too long and too wide with weirdly tight sleeves, but still super cute. I'm 5'4, 145lbs with an athletic build."
3.0,Quite a few of the berries had fallen out in the box. Great for the price. The branches were a little bendable. If some of the berries hadn't fallen off I might have given another star.
3.0,"While the listing says ""maxi"" the photos show this as mid-calf.  The item that ships in July 2022 drags on the floor about six inches. Yes I am short but one would need to be six feet for the CURRENT model of this nightgown to be  ""as pictured"". The length wasn't mentioned in inches that I could find so naturally I went by the photos thinking it would be full length-ish for me.<br /><br />It was also two sizes or more larger than a normal 2x so way too big and the sleeves are very narrow so they are tight on me. I have normal sized arms for my body.<br /><br />So don't go by the photo!  The print on the fabric is also smaller than the fabric pictured which may be a plus or minus difference."
3.0,These socks do the job - I purchased them to fit under some slip on canvas shoes I had purchased.  My only complaint is that the lace on a few of them began to get holes in it after I wore them only 1 time!
3.0,Cheaply made but comfy for around the house
3.0,okay but too tiny
3.0,"A few points:<br />- Consider sizing up from the measurements listed.<br />- If you have large breasts, move along.  This dress is not supportive in the chest and the fabric rolls/slips easily.<br />- The dress is super comfy - the fabric has a surprising amount of stretch.<br />- The blue is a royal blue, not really navy.<br />- They made this dress for someone about 6 ft tall.  If you are shorter, budget for hemming."
3.0,Soft material that would be comfortable IF THE medium didn’t fit like a Small... bummer.
3.0,"Quite stylish looking, but yellow face just not to my liking (looked white on screen).  Definitely a large, masculine-styled watch."
3.0,Had to return due to a melted spot due the closure of the envelope
3.0,Love the material under the breast area.  The least is the straps don't stay attached on the suit.
3.0,As pictured but tarnishes fast which sucked because i got so many compliments and then when i took it off there would be a green imprint of the jewelry on my wrist.id laint it with clear polish before wear if i repurchased
3.0,I expected the quality of the dress to be a more thicker.
3.0,"This is not a bad pair of sunglasses for the price.  I normally purchase over-size glasses, but these are way-oversize.  I also purchased the wine color, which is not exactly wine in real life, kind of brownish and dark, but not bad.  I was hoping for grey lenses (in the picture, they looked grey), but these lenses are brown.  For that reason, I will be returning them."
3.0,"The dress is beautiful--has great detail and the pattern stands out lovely. But--the first dress I ordered came in a bag labeled with the size I choose, but the dress inside was one size smaller. I ordered a new one assuming that it was an error in packaging--while I sent the first ordered one back--and the second dress was in the same condition: size noted on bag was what I'd chosen but dress inside bag was one size smaller. Disappointed. Wasn't sure if it was random packaging or all dresses come one size smaller, but didn't want to get into the hassle of return another dress and risking the next dress ordered."
3.0,I WANTED THE SHIRT IN BLACK
3.0,"A little disappointed in the width - I ordered EE, but these are pretty narrow.  Otherwise, they are OK.  Rob/Sea"
3.0,Ordered a medium sleeves a little short but overall it's a cute shirt
3.0,The comfort is the only reason I like it.  During wear is loosens up throughout the day.  I'm glad I waited before buying a second one.
3.0,"I was a little dissapointed with this dress, when I was placing the order it looked like a solid pattern flowered dress. When it arrived it is actually a lace material, was not to happy about that, so gave it away."
3.0,"Although I love the style of these, but they do run pretty small.  I chose L/XL so they would hopefully be baggy, but they are still almost fitted.  I would say this was Junior sizing instead of women's sizing.  The material doesn't have much of any stretch to it either.  They are supposed to have a relaxed/baggy fit, but I would've needed a larger option for that.  If the sizing was more accurate than SM/Med or L/XL, these would have been great."
3.0,I didn’t like the fit of the black pair of the same pants. They did not fit the same as the others and the length was too short.
3.0,These are both VERY small ...I would think better for a baby than an adult.
3.0,The elastic is sewn on in a weird spot. Had to remove and sew back on much lower so it would fit. Very hot with the foam inside. Wish it was lined with something else. Looks amazing though!
3.0,"Looked good, but didn't fit."
3.0,"I really like the shape of the dress but it is a little longer than expected. I'm 5'6"" and thought it would hit above the knees but doesn't. I really dislike the cheap material as it is thin and sheer. Very disappointed. Probably will be used more like a cover up than a dress even though it is long."
3.0,They were pretty but broke easily.
3.0,its a wee to big<br />.. most likely its the wool it stretches
3.0,"I like the presentation! It comes in a lovely box and a tool with instructions on how to size the belt. However I'm a large man 6'5 400lbs I'm hard on my belts so I expect some signs of wear and tear but, the first time I wore it for 10 hours the outer surface showed signs of cracking where it buckles after the first week the coverage is gone but, it's still holding together it's not coming apart or anything just the outer layer rubbed off I would recommend this for a cheap belt that works but, a dress up belt you may want to spring for the full leather"
3.0,I really loved this shirt at first.  I washed it once and the black is now blue.  Not at all pleased with that!
3.0,I usually wear a medium but this dress had too much material on the lower part.
3.0,"Cute dress but seems cheaply made. I'm concerned on how it'll wash because a couple of the rhinestones already fell off just trying it on. I'm 5'3 125lbs although the material is stretchy is only has a little bit of give and because I carry my weight in my lower half it means small strides for me. Fits well everywhere else, hits right above the knee"
3.0,"The shield logo on the front starting peeling off about a week after I received the tank. The tank is a little bigger than I anticipated, so think about ordering a size smaller, but that's relative. Other than that, it's a pretty good tank."
3.0,"I tried my best not to get it wet,  but it still managed to discolor after a week of all day wear."
3.0,"Top fit perfect, bottoms were too small"
3.0,"First shipment: there were not any clasps to connect the straps to the front bib. I double checked the package and they were just not included. not sewn on to the clasps, nor included separately. Second shipment included a small baggie with the straps and I tried to figure it out. Not sure if I did it correctly as there were no instructions. Keeping them out of frustration."
3.0,Order 40 pcs and 9 of them didnt work. Rest was okay.
3.0,Once they are put on the are stretched out too much to tell what it is
3.0,Only giving three stars because these honestly could work if they weren’t made so bad :( button is like ripping off and all I did was try them on. They’re cute on though so if you can sew try these! Just secure the buttons yourself lol.
3.0,"My cup size is DD. I bought the 3X bras, and was hoping they would offer enough support and coverage. The support is ok, but my breasts spill out of the top. There's not enough fabric to cover everything."
3.0,"love that it’s flat except I didn’t get what I ordered which was a plain silver, I got a blue one with a silver star instead."
3.0,"As with everyone else that has written a review of this product so far, I received a discount. I did pay some money for this though. I, too, noticed an odor after opening this. It was fine after airing it out after a few hours, but I hate getting new things that already stink. I ordered the blue one and the color is pretty true to the picture. I have used this in hotels twice now. The stitching and zippers look and feel well made, as does the material. I had it hanging by the hook for 3 days straight and there is no tearing or stretching. I don't like the size. This is fine for someone that doesn't use hairspray or any bottle larger than travel size. It was too small for my hair brush and didn't fit all of my beauty needs for the weekend (brush, hairspray, shampoo, makeup, toothbrush). This is just tall enough to fit a manual toothbrush, so anything taller will have to be packed separately. The dimensions are off in the description, or my bag is defective. Mine measures a little over 8&#34;x8&#34;x4&#34;."
3.0,Looked as expected but not overly cozy
3.0,"I was hoping the suit would fit because I’m typically a size small in most brands, but I’ve never tried this one before & I’ve determined this is one I’d probably need a xs. It was hanging off of me everywhere, top & bottoms. Unwearable, so I returned it. The quality wasn’t really great either, but I didn’t expect much for the price."
3.0,"My grand daughter loves this night gown. The only thing is I thought it was floor length and it wasn't it comes to the knees. I wanted a long floor length for her birthday, she is happy and that is what matters."
3.0,The shorts are nice but the top is a tight piece of fabric with a string to tie in the back. The top is definitely not for anyone with medium to large breasts.
3.0,I liked them but missing the pink nose piece
3.0,The hips fit a bit large and the legs are not as tapered as shown in the photo.
3.0,"I love the print I got, very beautiful. I usually wear a small but bought this in a medium. It was very tight in the sleeves and chest area (I'm a 36C). I did like the look of the dress but the pockets hit right on my hips and make the dress stick out quite far on the sides. I tried adjusting and pushing the pockets flat, but then I would move around and the pockets rested right on my hips again. It just didn't look that flattering on me so I'm sending it back."
3.0,"You get what you pay for that's for sure.  I typically am a 14 to 18 depending on the style so I got the biggest size offered thinking I'd try it.  I do manage to fit into it and can breathe okay but it's still rather tight.  Because of the cheap material, I always feel if I let out a sigh, it's just going to split in half.  I haven't worn it out yet because I do fear we'll be in the middle of dinner and it'll break on me.  I'll probably just end up wearing it around the house or if I go out for a very short period of time (which because of the pandemic isn't hard to do).  It is very cute though and I'm glad I got it.  I just wish there was a size larger or it was in a more breathable fabric."
3.0,They are cute and good quality but they are very hard to open.
3.0,Worth the price. A little etter than expect but the package is a little janky.
3.0,my daughter wore 2 pairs so far and lost one of each of them. they fall out easily. waste of money.
3.0,"The dress itself was absolutely gorgeous, looks just like the picture, and was of good quality. However, the arms were comically small, I could barely get the shoulders past my elbows. I'm normally a 12/14, and based on the reviews saying it ran small I knew that even the XL was a risky purchase, but it was insanely small, I'd have to go at least 2 sizes up to get my arms in (which unfortunately they do not make).<br />There is no stretch to the fabric."
3.0,"It pilled up in the first wash, hadn't even worn it yet. It is still nice and will wear it, but disappointed in the fabric."
3.0,Awkward fit too tight around my stomach but loose every where else
3.0,"This tie always looks untightened on my son's neck because it's not actually adjustable.  It's not a zipper tie or a clip on tie, instead it has a clasp at the back of the neck.  Also, this makes it so adults have to dress him."
3.0,"These glasses are great for the money.  If they break by accident or lost, you can easily replace them due to the cost.  I recommend buying a couple.  Also, they have that classic Wayfarer look without the high cost of the originals.  Are you listening  Ray Ban?"
3.0,"I liked the design, however the color was a little brassy looking."
3.0,It was a little difficult to attach to a mask. After you get it attached it wears fine.
3.0,The bags were as advertised. A little smaller than I had planned but they will work for my projects. I wish the bag was an inch taller and and an inch narrower.
3.0,Will try to see if can exchange for next size up.
3.0,I love this! The only downsize is the case continuously falls off. It looks amazing but I lost it in the first week
3.0,Fit fine...threading coming apart. Sent it back
3.0,"The swimsuit is beautiful, but the bust and blouse of the top seemed to be two different sizes. I wear a medium most of the time but some smalls, too. I ordered the medium in this swimsuit. The bust was very small while the blouse of the swimsuit was huge. I found it very incongruous. I wouldn't order the medium unless you are no bigger than an A cup."
3.0,"It’s a cute dress, but it really looks like a robe"
3.0,"if you have small head shape i wouldn't pick these, they aren't big or anything just like awkward, like bulky, hang off the side of your head a little but. but def worth the buy."
3.0,"I was not a fan of this dress. I bought a similar style in a different color at a dress boutique a few years ago and it was less expensive and better quality in my opinion. Be warned, if you plan on wearing anything underneath it will show (I.e. underwear, spanx, strapless bra). It is a cute style overall."
3.0,"I love this shirt, but it runs a little small.  Would suggest ordering a size up."
3.0,Analog  not working even with new battery
3.0,"I'm large on top. This suit pushes everything  to the under arm area.  No, it's not too small on the bottom. Just suitable of you're large on top."
3.0,I thought there were inside pockets otherwise I really like the size
3.0,"This is exactly what I needed to elevate my Locutus of Borg costume. The mask is well made and sturdy! My only issue is the nose piece - it's very tight, pinches your nose and can impede breathing a bit depending on the size of your nose. Not flexible material, as it's nice and sturdy. Thats my only gripe."
3.0,For the most part this suit is fine. However I feel like the photo and description are a little misleading as the suit is much more risqué than you would expect. The sides are cut in very far and there is a ton of side boob. Other than that it fit as expected and the quality and material are great.<br />It's definitely not a family friendly pool day suit but will remain on reserve for adult beach trips when you don't need to move much haha
3.0,"I didn't realize how small and poorly made these items would be when I ordered.  I wanted something to remind me of the sayings, but when I received the necklace and pendant, I was disappointed.  If they were a bit better quality and the &#34;magnifying glass-ish&#34; plastic thing was better rounded, it would be worth it.  Right now, I may end up using them as a decorative bookmark."
3.0,Bigger than expected...but it's cool!
3.0,"Runs small! Not sure I will be able to wear, I like my things a little looser"
3.0,"They are great, I and my sisters loved them!"
3.0,"Amazing product but unfortunately only for a short time. They will rip on you and for the money spent on them, they are not worth the high cost! You can find a similar product elsewhere that are cheaper and work just as well!"
3.0,"Fit: I'm 5'3"", 140lbs, and generally a medium in US sizes,  dress size 8 to 10. This jacket was so long and too baggy of a fit for a medium,  it just ran so big. It came down to my mid thigh and was baggy all over. It's fine if you like a loose and baggy fit but I was expecting something more fitted and this was not it. Due to the length I don't know that sizing down would have been a good option so I ended up returning this.<br /><br />Fabric: it actually seemed like good fabric but nowhere on it or the tag garment does it say it's UPF 50+ like the listing. Some of the seams are not done well either and the jacket I received had a loose surged ends."
3.0,"1"" buckle arrived as 1-1/2"". Refunded, didn't have to ship it back"
3.0,These shorts aren't like the picture. Looking for an old style mom Jean then get these. Not what I wanted and will probably give them away. Just wasted my money again. It's always a risk buying clothes online
3.0,Its ok. I could have just bought foam in home depot used for AC's probably would have been cheaper. Was very hard to get the label peel off. Took forever to get.
3.0,"Charm was as described, but the Mickey is so small that you can't really tell it is him."
3.0,"I was so excited to receive this dress. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to return it.<br />First of all, (and this might not bother everyone) the seam is running down the front of the dress and the pattern is not matched up. However, there is no seam in the back... I was hoping I could just turn the dress around and wear it backwards but it makes the chest (which is already tight to begin with) fit very weird.<br />Secondly, the dress I got had damaged side seams. I included a photo for reference.<br />The fabric is nice and light but not see through.<br />The length of the dress fit my 5'5&#34; body perfectly.<br />The pockets are an excellent touch.<br /><br />Guess I will have to search elsewhere for a dress that delivers all around."
3.0,Buyer beware you pay return shipping. I basically would have gotten the dollar back from shipping with upsToo small fit is small across the chest and the length of the arms is too short for an xl
3.0,"My dress-up crazed daughter loves these shoes but with only occasional use, some of the jewels have fallen off."
3.0,It’s a ok belt
3.0,Usually I wear size 8.5. M is small and wide.
3.0,"It was gorgeous just way way to small. I have to return it :(. Usually I'm an XL - 2x, which the size said it would fit. It doesn't. Way too tight. But on someone slimmer it would be really pretty."
3.0,"I love Miss Me Jeans because they make my butt look great. These are very clean-lined and in a dark wash. Definitely more mature/fancier than the ones with so much pocket bling that you can't make if through airport security. Only complaint is that they are very long, even though I ordered a shorter inseam (I'm 5 1/2 feet, 105 lbs). Will run them through the washer/dryer a few times to see if that helps."
3.0,"Great quality, but runs small"
3.0,I love the concept of having a glove & using it as a scrubber too. The only thing is that the rubber lacks the flexibility to grab smaller items & you can break it drop a glass of you are not careful
3.0,"Too big and heavy for my use. They are bigger than they look in the review photos in my opinion. Also, pay attention when it says not eligible for Amazon prime. These are not free to ship back as prime items are. I paid $3.33 to ship these $8 earrings back."
3.0,"great value, but the last time I ordered these they had bigger lenses and a more durable frame. This time, it seems like the frame breaks very easily and the nosepads come off pretty easy too."
3.0,"Really great quality socks! Thick and nice feeling HOWEVER the colors are TERRIBLY inaccurate. I don’t want to return them because I want my baby to wear them now but one color of these looks like the photos. There’s two shades of brown, two shades of pink, and two shades of blue. This is mildly upsetting as I ordered due to the lovely colors in the product photo."
3.0,So funny but sadly fell apart 2 days in. But had a blast while it lasted!
3.0,"slightly too big,kept sliding down. otherwise it was just what I was expecting"
3.0,I ordered a pack of 3 pairs and only received a pack of 2 pairs! Please help! I payed for a pack of 3!!!
3.0,Nice patterns and texture.  Quite large and unfortunately - so silky that I cannot get them to stay on my head.
3.0,"Not comfortable, stone is too small"
3.0,Lovely design very striking and eye catching. Downside...they arrived very poorly packaged so the post of each earring was bent out of position.
3.0,"The dress is pretty, it's definitely thin material, so you'll need something under it. The problem I had with it was that it had been used before. It smelled strongly of perfume around the neck area and nowhere else and it had a snap sewn into it to keep the top part together. The first one I ordered that didn't fit right didn't have a snap and didn't smell but was much much more wrinkled. This one wasn't as wrinkled. I know it was worn and returned."
3.0,"I followed the other reviewers suggestion if ordering a size up. I wear an XS in every sports bra I own (Nike, Reebok) as well as all my tank tops are XS. I LOVE this Gaiam bra but did order it in a Small. Fits perfectly. Would wear for more stationary or controlled activity like yoga, spinning, etc. I don't think I would wear it cross training or running.<br /><br />Update: 8/3/2019<br />I still like this bralette but would say one cycle in the wash and I'm not convinced it will hold up well after a few more. I might resort to hand-washing it. I saw some fuzzies (from washer, not dryer). Definitely don't put in the dryer..."
3.0,"Cute but running kinda big! I just put it on and ooops you cant wear a bealt, no belt hooks (I guess are called hooks), slides down off of me."
3.0,"I bought this to go with my Madonna costume for a party. It does get the job done but is poorly made. After just having it on to try on the out about twice for others the belt started to peel apart. The top white portion is coming away from the actually belt part...but for what i need it for and the low cost, it is not a bad product to buy."
3.0,"Cheaply made base metal. Price was too much for what it is. I love the fleur de lis, tho."
3.0,"The hour and minute hand often block the digital time--not a big problem at first, but when I somehow broke the knob off to adust the hands (must be quite fragile), it's become quite a pain."
3.0,"Style is okay, but I don't expect them to last very long.  Not for everyday or constant use, so they meet my needs.  But, I expect"
3.0,"Creo que quedan muy justo y eso que soy de espalda ancha compre L pero me quedo como un M, pero apesar de sentirlo un poco justo para mi gusto estan lindos y comodos"
3.0,NOT. ‘Full enough’. Color and design was great but a little on the snug.side
3.0,"The top is a little awkward. The skinny strip of material in the front is a longer than necessary, and the material isn't stretchy at all so it makes me look like my boobs are going to pop out. I wouldn't recommend this bath suit to busty women. The bottoms are fine though, they also aren't stretchy so they don't move with you as well as I'd like."
3.0,"Good hat, was smaller than I wanted it to be but I am also pretty sure I have abnormally big head, will probably return it since it’s tight. If you feel like you have a big head then I wouldn’t recommend getting this."
3.0,item returned.
3.0,Good product way over size
3.0,Shirt material was not exactly what I expected of a poet shirt and even thought I returned the first one in Large because it was way too small the second one I received in XL was still a little small. The fabric is scratchy and uncomfortable and lays funny.
3.0,"very pretty, but seems like will break easily"
3.0,The pictures made it seem more durable and in person it's kind of cheep looking. Like something from the dollar tree .
3.0,Was wanting a flannel shirt but this shirt was not flannel material. But still a nice shirt.
3.0,"Small tight on head and not able to wear it very long, must have been made for a larger child not adult (American size heads). Would not recommend"
3.0,The color and the material and the print was awesome. I wish I could have kept it but I'm way toooooo short. It was down to my ankles instead of at my knees. I'm 5'3&#34; and it just doesn't work. I think the colors and the print and materials are great but the proportions are wrong
3.0,"I thought there would be more ventilation for a work shoe,  I've had better for less money, adequate slip resistance."
3.0,"I laughed out loud when I first saw this..and not in a delighted way! more like, what a crappy-looking ring. The colored 'stones' are miniscule. At first I thought they might be Sharpied on, but if you turn the ring in the light, there are definitely little sparkles. Maybe some of the other letters turn out better? The ring itself seems fairly sturdy, and is somewhat adjustable, hence the rather generous 3 star rating."
3.0,"The bad: This is a cool costume, but I was a little disappointed with it. First off, I ordered a Large based off the measurements in the sizing chart - it should have fit just fine. Instead, it was quite huge on me and I had to hem the pants and tuck the shirt in a lot to make it not look huge. Also, I was a little disappointed with the type of material it was made from. For the price I bought this for, I was a bit surprised that it felt like the same material those 10$ costume store costumes are made of.<br />The good: it's a cool looking costume."
3.0,The broke in 2 day and this tape thing came off and so Hard to open
3.0,"Ordered XL... its Cute, runs small though and very thin"
3.0,"Do not fit like the originals, takes some getting used to."
3.0,"This is my second pair. They look nice, love that they are polarized BUT... they do become loose easily. However, It does come with a screwdriver keychain for the glasses but you have to be tightening them often. That’s the only problem"
3.0,It's OK - somewhat small for a real Hawaiian shirt.
3.0,"Would have given this 5 stars had it not been for the fact that I received a used product in an open bag with the clear straps and tags ripped off (which damaged the sewing). If I didn't need this for tomorrow I would've asked for a replacement but sadly too late for that.<br /><br />Also to those stating it runs large, I would disagree, and many of the people stating the bust doesn't reflect the picture are likely ordering sizes too small."
3.0,"Fits very well. Though this item would be better suited for warmer areas that never see temps below 50 degrees, this barely qualifies as a wind-breaker. I live in Heartland america where the temps get down to below zero some years. I used to have a military jacket, it was a handy down from my dad when he worked on the flight-line so it was authentic. However through the years it was worn and finally had to retire it. When I saw this I thought I was getting something similar, however I am slightly disappointed. I have flannel shirts that are thicker than this, shirts mind you. That being said, I like how it was designed and it is well constructed and plan on wearing it for certain events. Good for somewhere warmer, but not where I currently do. Take it as you will."
3.0,These things run small. I ordered the large like I always buy but they are too small for my thighs. They don't have the normal hole for me and this was my mistake they are boxer briefs. Not a high fan of these although I do have a few pair in a large that fit nicely.
3.0,Its a nice pattern but didn’t look right. Its too short so if you don’t mind your tummy showing then go for it.
3.0,get what you pay for.
3.0,"Really love this watch. I've had it for 2 years and its accurate reliable the water resistence hasn't failed yet and it's pretty tough. However,<br />(yes there's always a however these days since everything is made cheaply in China)<br /> I've started getting this weird bleeding on the left and top. It's not backlight bleed like when it gets too hot. I heated it up with a flashlight until the screen was blacked out and it slowly cooled off and recovered but those weird black blotches were still there.<br />Not really sure what the deal is. It still works but I've noticed my battery is consistently staying on medium charge instead of high charge like it used to. I'm thinking maybe a solar cell has ruptured or something along those lines.<br /> If anything changes I'll update this review (since it's not a cheap watch I'd like to let others know what to look out for before buying one.)"
3.0,Did not like the material. It was cheap material and poorly made. Will give this dress away did not like it.
3.0,I like the colors and the size. But there is no nose bridge or filter pouch as described in the description. I’ll be sending these back.
3.0,"The suggestions in comments and the product tester encouraged to size down. I wish I wouldn't have done that, but otherwise they are super soft and comfy1"
3.0,"Wayyyyy too small, sad because they are so cute"
3.0,"LOVE the colors but, sadly, they are too tight for my hubby's head. We are doing what we can to stretch them out but not sure it is going to work. I won't repurchase since they don't fit but, again, I love the colors and they seem to be nice quality."
3.0,Ok product but long ship time out of china
3.0,"Im a size 5/6. 5'3"" bought medium a little big but look good on me."
3.0,"It was cute, but the red material was cheap and the checkers were not quite the same as in the image."
3.0,Heavy product. Was planning on wearing everyday but they hurt. They are cute. Just going to wear them for special occasions.
3.0,"Cute hat but a little too flimsy, starts to look floppy too soon"
3.0,Needed something loose and comfortable after surgery. This was perfect. Easy to get on and off. Would buy again<br />I ordered the black one it just arrived do not get the black the lips are yellow. The worst.
3.0,Had to glue the noses and whiskers back on and the elastic on the back too
3.0,"Smells, wash immediately! Nice colors:)"
3.0,"This item is ok....  It showed I would get in a short period of time, but after ordered, then showed over a month out after placing the order, kinda deceiving.  The paint job is kinda poor, reminds me of kids not staying in the lines when painting.  The key chain is very cool, but overall for cost, a little lower would feel better for what I got as the end product."
3.0,I didn't get the color I ordered but my sister still loved it.
3.0,They are very comfortable but the elastic at thecwaist is not any wider than other brands and will roll down under the same circumstances.
3.0,"Love the style, they are on the darker side."
3.0,It's ok..ordered a small but the top sides are a little big..
3.0,"The large fits perfectly. The material meh; it is a little thin compared to Capezio’s princess tank/ the basic collection. I usually wear size L leos for ballet classes. The strap are adjustable, which makes this leo really comfy. Unfortunately, I will return it because I don’t like shiny/ silky fabric for my leos."
3.0,The gown was beautiful!!  Color was great. Was just a little too snug. I usually wear XL. Wish they had a larger size or offered in plus.
3.0,Love this but fits smaller then says and arms are small
3.0,"I like that it is easy to wear, cute and has a pocket‼️"
3.0,Okay but tiny
3.0,Love this shirt but it was kinda small! I bought a med and I'm 5'3 130 and a med was a little tight glad I didn't get a small
3.0,"I absolutely LOVE this necklace. However, I had to give it three stars because when it came in the mail it was broken and I had to find pliers to fix it. It only took a few minutes, but it sucked because I don't like buying broken things. Anyways, the necklace itself is awesome and looks super cool and is quite the conversation starter. Hooray"
3.0,Love the look of it was disappointed in the width ...
3.0,"I love this ring but the two metal ends keep digging into my finger. I  adjusted the ring and still have the same problem. It's uncomfortable. Hence, the rating reflects this. This ring could have earned a 5, but these ends are now chipping also."
3.0,Gloves phone touch did not work but hey were still warm
3.0,Lower your expectations to the level of the price and you wont be disappointed.<br />Biggest issue to me was the extremely long delivery time.
3.0,"It’s very cute and looks adorable on my baby, but the bow falls out after one use. Wouldn’t buy again unfortunately :("
3.0,The torso of the swimsuit is short with longer straps so it does not provide the best coverage.
3.0,Too heavy.  Beautiful but very heavy to wear
3.0,Cute but very loose. I use this as a nightgown/cover up. Not a dress I would wear out. I am 5'3&#34; 115 and it's not flattering in the slightest.
3.0,"This jacket has good qualities, lightweight and fits well, but it’s no big thing. The Olive color looks like baby poop"
3.0,"love the fit and style, but the button on the top neckline is pokey and comes up way too high, I had to cut it off and hand sew the seam shut."
3.0,"The Texas charm is cute and does look like the photo but the size in the photo is very misleading. I thought this was going to be a cute little Texas when in fact it's freakin' big! It would make an adorable keychain but for a necklace its very Flavor Flav . If that's your thing, then by all means buy it! I returned it the next day"
3.0,"Cute earrings, smaller than I thought and very thin. They sent me the wrong color but for the cheap price, the effort it takes to return and the time I'd have to wait for a new pair I'll just keep them.  That was the only disappointing thing."
3.0,This vest was an exact fit.
3.0,"Nice shirt, sheer, but I don’t like the shoulders.  If you are modest, you have to wear a cami with it."
3.0,"I'm 5'8"", 190 lbs with a round middle. I purchased the white jeans in size 14. They hit me below the belly button and are skin tight from waistband to about 2"" below the knee. They are very stretchy and therefore comfortable throughout, but they make my thighs and knees look like sausages. Hopefully they will stretch out a bit with wearing and laundering. I would describe these jeans as bootcut, not flares."
3.0,Just keeps catching on everything. Clothing because it is not smooth.
3.0,I was too short for these.  I am 5 feet tall. If you are short like me consider this before buying.  I did shorten them and they worked fine.
3.0,"I purchased these with the express intent of getting cute piping on the briefs as in photo. Instead I receive all black, no piping coloring. I'm severely disappointed, but the fabric is incredible! I love having my bits rub against it. So 10/10 for fabric, but 2/10 for actual presentation. At least I think black undies are sexy and so does my partner, so still good for that at least. But GODDAMMIT SEND ME UNDERWEAR WITH PRETTY PIPING!!!"
3.0,"These started out great, but it did not take long for them to lose all cushion and become flat and uncomfortable."
3.0,A little too small for me but great quality. Just needed something bigger.
3.0,Nice Quality but threads are coming out.
3.0,"Pretty, but not any larger than my last normal size pair.  I have a really small face (wear childrens hats etc) and these just look like normal size glasses on me."
3.0,Very colorful. Different size socks came in same batch. A little disappointing since I am giving them to the same grandson.
3.0,I went with the XXL because I'm top heavy aka busty &amp; its alright but doesn't appear like the picture there is no pucker to it my bust pulls it too tight
3.0,"This is definitely a $25 corset. It's *not* a $100 one. It needed minor alterations, fine for my beginning sewing level, but not for a person who doesn't sew at all. First thing I did was take in a pair of bust darts so it curved and fit better up top. Then I cut and resewed the strings so it cinched more like a real corset, toward a place in the middle. I've worn it out clubbing and dancing about 4 or five times, and I had to go back and sew the front closure snaps back an, and tuck the metal bones back in and re-sew them. It's definitely important to size like a regular piece of clothing, not like a waist-training corset. i.e., don't plan to cinch down hard or put a lot of strain on this. Still for $25, I'm happy to have it.<br /><br />I'm 5'3, and have ~41&#34; waist. I wear either a 2X or 3X at Lane Bryan or Dress Barn. In this piece I wear a 6X."
3.0,In all a good product a lil big
3.0,"Decent,  I  would order it again, it was a gift."
3.0,The dress itself is very cute and looks pretty good quality for the price but it is advertised to come with wings and it didn't and a replacement won't be here before Halloween so it's very  disappointing.
3.0,"I bought the ring and broach to match. Both beautiful, but the rose part broke of on the third time wearing.  Broach is still good."
3.0,"Gorgeous color, nice lightweight, cool, soft fabric.  Ran smaller than I expected."
3.0,Waders run pretty small. I ordered a 14 and honestly i wouldnt even call them a 12. Foot was cramped with a light sock.
3.0,Cute but probably won't last
3.0,"It's half the price of other good stuff, I'd say stick with good ones if you can afford them."
3.0,Cute outfit. I’d order more but the button loop to open and close the back is thin twisted elastic. Impossible to get in and out of. Up the quality of the closure to a thicker elastic and it would be great.
3.0,"Please note that this was purchased for a costume and I'm not looking to get a lot of wear out of this thirt.  That being said, I'm glad I only have to use it once, maybe twice.<br /><br />The material is thin and see through, the button holes have a lot of extra thread so that the buttons easily get caught when trying to undo them, the fit is too small through the waist.  It's like the shirt was made for a long thin torso with a well built chest and shoulders, becuase it fits fine through the bust and shoulders and has enough room down to the wrists.  I can't button the bottom two buttons at all!<br /><br />It's not a huge deal to me since this is being tucked into a high waisted skirt and then being mostly covered by a vest.  If you want a cheap shirt for one or two specific events, you could probably make it work - but wear something under it or over it.<br /><br />But if you're looking to invest in a nice shirt, this isn't it.  Keep looking."
3.0,The material isn't bad and you can see how they cut the cloth  it's something that I don like also if you are a C o D Cup for you breast this is too small for you I'm 36D and it's too small for me I'm going to return this product
3.0,"All worked, but not for very long. When they worked they were great. Wish they would have lasted more than an hour or two."
3.0,"Dress arrived on time. Design matched what I ordered. Dress fits a little big on top, but very cute."
3.0,Quality is mediocre. The &#34;leather&#34; is stiff and the clasps are cheap. But the bracelet is cute.
3.0,Appears bigger online...expected to be larger...but they are nice....just really too small.  Probably look better on a child.<br />From ear lobe it's one inch and the size of the Anchor is ~1/2 inch.
3.0,No surprises. Simple basic strap. Not much for color options or patterns for $9 spent.
3.0,Quality was good..item did not fit loose enough at hip area for pallazzo pants....waist fit was perfect.
3.0,Returned because it was a gift.  It was too small for an adult woman
3.0,"2.5 stars, look cool, black on black on black on black is cool, but after 3 hrs my ear starts become irritated. i have sensitive skin...or maybe these are just real crappy"
3.0,The picture was misleading and I did not realize I was getting something black which wasn't all that bad considering I love black. The skirt is really beautiful. Kinda see thru. Gorgeous. What bugs me is that the skirt is WAY to tight. I've worn one size fits all clothes before but this is like an Asian one size fits all. Definitely not for someone 134 lbs or more.
3.0,she has been asking for these choker and i was excited to see all the different colors it came with especially for the pink because she is obsessed with pink. when it arrive it came with all the other colors but the pink one. she was still happy that she got the other colors but i was very disappointed.
3.0,not as shiny as picture ..and darker
3.0,It wasnt what i was waiting for but is good to kid. Normal good expensive
3.0,It was ok the bangs on the sides were a little bit long so had to cut them to size
3.0,The material is VERY strong and I was a little too thick for these. They cut off my circulation. But if they fit you I can almost guarantee they won't rip
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:e9d7446c4cd03db126293111dbb53124]] The vest looks good and fits well.<br />That being said, even though the description said lightweight, I didn’t expect it to be so thin. The material has the patterned stitching but doesn’t feel padded.<br />The zipper is also very defective. It  goes up fine but it gets terribly stuck when trying to unzip it, every time."
3.0,Cotton isn't very soft but these are reasonable dusters for the price and come in various sizes.
3.0,I like the look of these pants but don't like the material it's made out of too much. I've only worn them twice and they're already become be worn in the thigh area. I don't think it's worth the price I paid for them....but they look great on me.
3.0,"The colors are just like the photo I bought a bigger size so she can grow into. but Im disappointed, expected a thick regular hoody. The material is thin. This hoody is for rainy and windy days. But if you're wanting this in the winter for your little one I wouldn't recommend it. It more jacket like but child loves it! UPDATE AFTER A WEEK OF HAVING IT: The cheap material is really coming through"
3.0,The shoes themselves look cute but when I received the item there was a marker stroke on the bottom of the one shoe when it should be in a brand new condition. Reached out to the seller but was told that no extra pair in the size I ordered was available for a replacement. Wish they would inspect the items before shipping out to the customers.<br /><br />Otherwise shoes fit great. My child's feet measured about 120mm and size 4.5(Medium) fit just right. There isn't a much of room between the big toe and the top edge of the insole but that 's how it should fit I guess since size 5.5(Large) one I have is too big.
3.0,"The glasses made the greens more pronounced, but they didn't help me differentiate between yellow and red traffic lights.  Also they made LED billboards look weird; blues came out green.  Overall, they didn't make enough of a difference to me to justify the cost, so I'm returning them."
3.0,"The fabric is thin and wrinkles a lot, so I won't wear them outside as I hoped."
3.0,"I order this for my wedding, it's really beautiful the problem is it came  with missing pieces. No earrings and no ring. So I am  giving 3 stars for that reason"
3.0,It is a very cute top. It is listed as a ‘plus’ but is not. I am a size 14/16 and this top is too tight and the sleeves are a couple of inches short.
3.0,"They were pretty tight considering I ordered the larger size. I normally wear a S or M. There was a slight odor when opening package, but an immediate wash took care of it. I like the light fabric, but haven’t worn them yet."
3.0,The straps are not strong enough to stay snapped. I am going to try putting some velcro on them more strength as the bottles my fall out.
3.0,Unless you are a some hunk who can pull these off these will end up making you look like an old lady who just finished getting her pules mediated at the doctors. I have the same pair but with the designed logo on them that do not make it look this way however I assume it was due to the matte color of the frames. Although the polarized is great
3.0,This only gets 3 stars because I order this shoe for a 80’s party and only one shoe worked. So I didn’t get to enjoy the shoes for what I purchased it for.
3.0,"These glasses come well packaged.  Frames are sturdy and attractive.  I really liked the look.  Unfortunately, I couldn't see anything close up - it was blurry.  I could see things far away - like my tv.  But since I wanted something that would work with seeing messages on my phone or for computer work - it didn't work for me."
3.0,They were okay - nothing that I would recommend. The boys ages 7 & 9 were not really impressed - the lights did not last too long!
3.0,"Not sure who is the bigger idiot, me or the person that designed this (black band) watch.  The watch functions fine.  The leather band is decent quality.  But I strongly, almost insistingly, suggest you not buy the black version of this watch.  You absolutely cannot see the hands, even in bright outdoor sunlight you can't make them out.  Everything is black, the hands and the dial, with nothing distinguishing between the components.  The second hand, being red colored, is the only part you can easily see.  Forget about dim or dark rooms (it doesn't even have a dial light option or even glow-in-the-dark hands).<br />And yet the description on this page says, &#34;Easy to Read Simple fashion quartz watch.&#34;  Probably true with the brown and/or grey band (photos show a white colored dial.<br />So, again, there's nothing wrong with the function of the (black) watch.  You just can't read the darned thing."
3.0,Nicely made but faded after one wash
3.0,"Going back huge! Message gets a 5 . Quality was ok, soft, just really disappointing that I have to return it. Today is ALL ABOUT SPEADING & standing UP!!! 34”DD & still was huge, also really long."
3.0,"Good thickness. Came kind of high around the ankle for my tastes. I use them for wearing around the house and the designs of the rubber grips puts pressure points on my feet which make my feet hurt after a while. Rubber grips starting to come off with less than 5 wearings, but there is still a lot of rubber left."
3.0,"Though the dress is cute it’s very different then listed. The color is pink and blue. Very pink. The length of the dress is way way longer then picture. I get that the model is taller then myself who is 5’3, but this dress is past my knees. The sides of the don’t go up like the model either.<br />There’s nothing sexy about the dress."
3.0,Appears to be good product but sizing was wrong and have not been able to use.
3.0,"This dress is adorable, except for the flappy back.  It looks like it will fit like normal, but the back was loose and weird. There is also no option for cleavage even though it is advertised as being able to have some. This doesn't bother me at all, but it may bother some girls.<br /><br />Dress design is adorable.  Not executed well."
3.0,"This jumpsuit is ok quality, however it is accomplishing what I got it for pretty well. I sleep in this and it’s super easy to get up at night with my daughter to nurse her then jump back in bed. The sizing is quite a bit bigger than I expected. The top is very loose, I’d say size down if you don’t want everything showing!"
3.0,Material is super thin and sheer. I returned this product.
3.0,"This dress is extremely see-through and the material is weird and shiny. I should've looked at what it was made of prior to buying it. In the future, I know if something says it's made out of polyester then it's going to have a weird sheen to it. I'm not sure how strange it looks on the patterned dresses, but it just looked super cheap with the green dress. It almost looked like I was trying to wear some fancy gown that I bought off Wish. Such a shame because the fit was actually nice. I'll be returning it, but I might try one of the pattern dresses instead. Also, I bought a size small. I'm 153 lbs, but curvy with muscle. I feel like I could've gotten an xsmall to be honest."
3.0,"Little cheap feeling.  Little small for my face as well, it didn’t really go over my chin so when i spoke it would fall down.  I think the behind the neck design isn’t that great.  I would avoid, besides there are vent holes which defeats the purpose of spreading the disease if you have it and dont know it."
3.0,the choker is rather small - I put the stone on it to wear it and the small ring attaching it to the choker came off. Good thing that happened at home. I like the charms but the construction was not well done.
3.0,Love this shirt but it was too short! The quality was good but the sizing is off.
3.0,This is our second one and both broke within the first few weeks.  Cute but be careful.
3.0,"Likes: style, material being durable and decent quality<br /><br />Dislikes: it seems to fit as a general small which is challenging when there is XS being a 00-2 and small being a 2-6.<br /><br />For me it’s a tad loose in the stomach where if it were a little more cinching in the tummy area it would be the perfect suit !"
3.0,"The print is beautiful, I love the pattern and fits true to size (with a little length) however this dress is INCREDIBLY TRANSPARENT even with the full length white layer under the main layer of the dress. I had to order a full length slip in order to wear it, which isn't a problem, but added to the cost of the dress and makes me feel bulkier than if the bottom layer would have been more solid."
3.0,Beautiful but seem kinda homemade?? I do love them however.
3.0,Spikes are a but flimsy
3.0,The croch part is too tight.. im usually  a large ordered  an XL and it felt tight. The material is nice and the color is amazing  i just  wished it would have fit comfortable..
3.0,Like the fabric but the neck was too big.
3.0,"Product runs slightly large. Just as others have stated that the cups run large on the tops, that was true for me too. I tried to tie the top tighter to make it work, but it was just hurting the back of my neck. I really like the bottoms, could have gone down a size even! I wear a size 16 pant/40-D bra and ordered the 16-18."
3.0,Exact....Sheer....Good delivery time
3.0,Cute. Very lightweight. I broke off the leaf chain almost immediately intentionally. It just didn't seem to look right on me ... Maybe on someone else but the leaf part was too long for my looks. Still very pretty without it and I got a lot of compliments. I have the silver set right now and just ordered the gold as well so I can switch one and give a set to my sister.
3.0,Would be a nice hat if it wasn't so big all over that it could fit an Amazon.  I will have to try to somehow take it in or put a hatpin in it and tack the brim up.
3.0,"Not the greatest material, but I suppose it's worth the money."
3.0,"The stones were pretty , it is very big . Must have size 9- 10 foot"
3.0,"It was packaged so well with tape and bubble wrap that i had complications trying to open it and It broke as soon as I opened the package........<br />I put another link on the chain myself to fix it, the chain is a plastic and super light, it looks pretty real, except if your really looking at it and staring at the chain then you can tell its plastic.<br />would I buy it again, NO not with the price it is at but if the price is lowered down then yea I would consider to buy it."
3.0,The color on the photo is different but it looks so much better in person. I bought mine a size up and I should’ve went 2 sizes up because it’s still kind of small. I would just have to wear a T-shirt up under it.
3.0,"Really disappointed, these ran the length of the panty hose as I was putting them on, didn’t even get out the door with them. Don’t waste your money."
3.0,It was shorter and like the other person said it should have had a longer chain so it lays flat.<br /><br />Still like it.
3.0,Didn't like the gold tassel things. You can't see them in pic
3.0,"a bit tight however there is cushioning in she shoe, hopefully after some wear it will be just right"
3.0,"Nice style, but way too fitted. Not at all comfortable. I was hoping it was like another one of the same brand that I already owned. Quite disappointing."
3.0,"Surface treatment of brass buckle started to wear off within a week, revealing very shiny metallic surface. Poor quality workmanship. Leather belt is OK."
3.0,Over all a cute bathing suit for the price. My only complaint is theat on e of the shoulder straps isn't even attached so I'm going to have to fix it before I can wear it.
3.0,"The pleather is firm towards the middle, but the edges are softer than they should be, making it very prone to fraying. I used it for an archery waist belt base, and it was actually a plus that it was so easily damageable. It made my costume look more authentic!"
3.0,"It was ok for the price, but when it caught a door as I was going through it came apart.  The pin holding the band on bent, and the watch fell off. The back also popped off at that time.  I got it put back together, but the pin is compromised, and it will only be a matter of time until it breaks for good.  The black is wearing off the clasp as well.  Otherwise, it keeps time and looks decent for the price."
3.0,I like the color of the outfit
3.0,"Meh at best , cheap threading near the zippers."
3.0,"I LOVED these straight out of the package. Unfortunately, they tarnished quickly. Guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,"I thought the design was woven into the fabric, like it was green silky fabric with a bird print, but it is actually screenprinted onto the green fabric, like a t-shirt logo. This means it will flake off over time and with washing."
3.0,Nice quality but runs super smsll
3.0,It does fit but the leg area is very tight and the top doesn't really close. But it's a very nice design
3.0,The shirt was to small however the color of the yellow was just like the picture pretty accurate.
3.0,Good quality. Longer than expected.
3.0,Very cute but broke before my mom wore it so now I got to try and fix
3.0,I know it’s supposed to be oversized but I feel XS should have been smaller. Also I ordered cream and it looks more khaki
3.0,"After owning these pants for about 3 months, wearing them once a week; the waistband seam is opening up in multiple spots."
3.0,"Didnt like the material, But shirt was pretty, a Bit big."
3.0,Hard to fit a laptop in it.
3.0,I love the ring but I ordered a 6 and it’s more like a 4<br />I wish the size was accurate
3.0,"Not bad, but not great."
3.0,Small pieces of plastic are hard to put on there and they dont give you extra ones so if you lose some like me then you’re out of luck. Very hard to put in.
3.0,I ordered a 16 I got a size 7-16. They were great quality just run small.
3.0,typical flat crossbody bag.
3.0,The dress is beautiful.. but it was to big and when I tried to return it I had to pay for shipping to send it back to China so i would have paid twice for shipping ... no thanks
3.0,"I'm only 5'1"" and 150 lbs.  Dress is cute and fits just right, except for the length. It's very short. I bought it to wear to work, and I did. But every time I'd get up and walk around I'd have to keep pulling it down. The length was not appropriate for the office. It was a mini. But if you don't mind a super short dress, I'd definitely recommend buying it cuz it's really cute."
3.0,"This was extremely small, like a child’s size, and the fabric was very thin."
3.0,"I am glad that I bought just one as a trial gift for the ladies in my office.  They liked the look and the fabric, but the size was way off.  They must be children's sizes.  The two ladies in my office that said they wanted mediums found the extra large I ordered to fit perfectly."
3.0,Hard to get on by yourself- The clasp is not easy to put on
3.0,"Love the look, love the style, love the colours, after trying it on a little disappointed in the size. A little small, I hope its comfortable to race in."
3.0,"I think this is a cute ear cuff and it is quite sturdy.  It sometimes can hurt the area where it's attached, but it is well made and does not tighten or loosen up once it's in place...this is a good thing!  I've had some in the past that seem to easily get looser the longer you wear or use them.  This is a well constructed item."
3.0,"you get what you pay for, always keep that in mind, for the price these pins are fine, pretty much as pictured"
3.0,Absolutely zero stretch and unforgiving. Go up a size from what you’d normally wear in this brand. Small around the waist but huge in the legs. I was so sad because I wanted to love these and use them as my bum around pair. I’ll have to starve myself for a month to close them.
3.0,"This bathing suit comes packaged in a ziplock bag which keeps it clean and odor free.<br /><br />The style is really nice on this bathing suit.<br /><br />I am 5'6"" and wear a 2XL.  I am a pear which means I carry my weight below the waist around the belly, derriere and thighs.<br /><br />The black part of the suit is typical stretchy bathing suit material but the trim with the see through stripes is not stretchy.<br /><br />The striped part makes it difficult to get up.  Once up it was okay at the waist for me.<br /><br />The striped part around the top and straps is a problem for me because it isn't stretchy and therefore it doesn't conform to the body.  It was literally hanging open at my bustline and not conforming against the skin so the girls were not supported and they were not covered without gaping.  It was a terrible fit at the bustline.<br /><br />There was also not enough fabric across the derriere for my taste and every time I moved it inched up more and more.<br /><br />The suit did seem to be made well and had no raveling or uncaught seams.  The trim was an unfortunate choice for a swimsuit since it had little to no elastic.<br /><br />So, if you have a larger bust and smaller derriere, this might be a good fit for you, but unfortunately, it is not a fit for my pear shape in any part and with no stretch in the trim it is just a no go.<br /><br />This bathing suit was made in China."
3.0,This dress is way too big and totally see through in white. The fabric is stretchy and would be comfortable if it wasn’t falling off me
3.0,Ok quality. Color was more lime green instead of army as pictured
3.0,"While I really wanted to like this bracelet, it kind of started to slowly fall apart layer by layer after a while. I didn't expect stainless steel or sterling silver for the price, but I wish it had been just a little more quality-controlled."
3.0,"When the card holder arrived, I was quite surprised at how thin and small it was. Even for a gift card holder, it is quite small and flimsy."
3.0,"Love the shirt but it ran very small. Very tight on my arms. If I went a size up, I think the rest of the shirt would have been too big. It did not seem proportionate to me."
3.0,"Color was nowhere near what was pictured. We returned because the 4 was too big. Daughter is 35 lbs, 40 in tall."
3.0,super long
3.0,"Not sure why the zipper is on the back. Impossible to get on or off without someone to help. Also, the neck area needs a fix. By the end of the night, I had a red rash mark all the way around my neck from it rubbing as I moved."
3.0,Quedo super grande y no ajusta los senos.
3.0,I do have a hard to fit foot. These just don’t hold up at all.
3.0,"Wife didn’t like the way they felt. Said poked her. She re-gifted them, friend said same thing."
3.0,"Very big for price.. has nice little area in lid part for brushes, lipstick, pencils etc. My only issue is if it will hold up. The inside is lined with a really thin paper like material."
3.0,"Not for you, if you're looking for quality."
3.0,Need elastic in waste to stay up
3.0,I assumed it was cotton :(  Aside from that the shirt is fine.
3.0,I’ve had these for a few months now and gone on a few trips. The were great at first and now the zipper is starting to wear so it’s a bit tough to close. I am able to fit three very full ones in my suitcase that is carry on size.
3.0,Good for photos
3.0,"I ended up returning this dress because it was too big (I am almost ALWAYS a medium and the medium was giant in the shoulders and just big all over) and the material was weirdly shiny and stretchy. I love a good stretch in my clothes, but this seems like it could be a costume for a kids dance recital. I was super disappointed too, because it looks darling in the picture! Oh, and I guess I just can't pull off all the stripes.. kinda looked like a circus tent :)"
3.0,Fits much smaller than similar items
3.0,The nose guard on each pair came off and the glasses bend very easily.
3.0,"Looks and feels like a well-made bag. It may even be worth the price. However, if the handle strap and the strange tag (with no words on it) are any indication, this is not a leather bag.  The material is rather stiff and cold, not like real leather. The backing and lining of the rest of the material keeps from confirming without causing damage.<br /><br />Docking 2 stars for misleading info."
3.0,"I got this for family portraits because I needed the color last minute. The shirt runs so big and the peplum is more of a high-low style and was not super flattering. I am 5'6"" and 145lbs so I ordered a medium but should have done a small. Ended up taking the shirt in a few inches and tucked it into high waisted shorts for pictures. It worked for what I needed, but I would not buy again, at least not for the price. Beautiful color though!"
3.0,"I read the review and caught that the lapis was faceted but I bought them anyway. Unfortunately, the faceting of the lapis really diminishes from the stone itself. Makes it look cloudy blue. Its a shame because the shape, size and color were exactly what I was looking for but the faceting ruined them."
3.0,Not as thick as I expected to be
3.0,They are beautiful but the stud is so thin it's easily breakable.
3.0,"I'm giving this shirt three stars, because my husband really liked the design and the mottled color.  Unfortunately, the quality of this shirt is really poor.  The material is really thin and although it arrived in undamaged packaging, the shirt had three small holes a little above the waist, so they couldn't be hidden.  Therefore, I had to send back, which was made very easy by Amazon.  If this shirt becomes available with better quality material, I will consider repurchasing it."
3.0,These socks end up hitting me in the knee joint. I have to fold the top of the socks down about an inch and a half. These socks do not have the compression of some other brands I am using
3.0,"A little on the thin side.  Feathers started falling off as soon as I took it out of the packaging.  In the future, I will just go to the local costume shop and buy a fuller one for a few more dollars."
3.0,Material is very cheap and it stretches out very easily!
3.0,Mask fits my husband well but only received 1 mask and description indicates 2. High price for only 1 mask.
3.0,"One of these came apart the first time I wore it,  another a few weeks later. The last is holding strong, though."
3.0,"Good quality but run very small, had to buy the XL in order to fit a size 13 foot."
3.0,"Thanks to the previous reviews, I knew to go a size above to get the closest fit for my LO. And yet, these shoes are tight on the top of the foot for my 6 months old. The length is appropriate for the time being but a few hours of wearing them leaves red angry marks on my LO's feet. I'm hoping the elastic will relax a bit in time as they look well made and are super cute, in which case I will come back to update my review.<br />I have taken a picture of the different brands of soft baby shoes I have and labelled them to give you an idea about the sizing of this brand."
3.0,"I do like these shorts but they're a little too short for running. The material is nice and I'm going to keep them however, they ride up while I'm running. I'm 160 lbs, 5'1"" and will run 3 miles on a treadmill - my legs are on the smaller side for my weight. I haven't used the pockets yet but it's a nice option."
3.0,The clasp was broken.. It's sad because I mailed it to my sister directly as a gift.. I was a bit embarrassed it came broken
3.0,"The necklace is pretty, but the clasp and extend part are always falling to the front."
3.0,"Cute and worth the price BUT don't throw it in the washer and dryer! It shrunk to about half of it's normal size. It is still a cute, beachy top... But now I just have to wear pants or shorts with it."
3.0,Fits well however after one washing the number on the back cracked and chipped a bit.  Gives the shirt a distressed look. Which it shouldn’t have.
3.0,My shoulders were too wide for the shirt/dress.  The top wouldn't sit on my shoulders pushed up and gaped.  I think if you have slender shoulders you'll be fine.
3.0,"Love the bracelet, very stylish, appears to be well made, but I have an issue with the fastener. Bracelet tends to come unfastened during the day with normal wrist action and I have almost lost it several times. The &#34;wings&#34; on the metal need to be slightly wider. Other than that, very happy with the product!"
3.0,The cups weren't US standard F cups. They were much smaller. I like the design and the color and the bra fit around me but I overflowed in the cups.
3.0,"I needed boots to wear while doing metal casting in a foundry. It's pretty hard to find boots small enough for a women's sized shoe. I wear a women's 8.5, men's 7. My toes hit the front of these boots even with thin socks, which was super disappointing since they shipped from Europe. Sending them back would've cost more than it was worth. So, I would recommend you order a half size up.<br /><br />The boot itself is a clunker, but that's to be expected for a foundry boot. However it's even clunkier than most foundry boots I've seen. I felt like I had moon boots on. The leather was  really stiff and the front flap felt like it would bruise my ankle if I tried to walk around in them for a while. I feel like they would take forever to break in. The sole is super thick and heat resistant, which is good. I think it's well made, but it was not comfortable at all to me personally. It's super safe though!"
3.0,Ok for the super low price  You get what you pay for.
3.0,"I’m not sure what I expected, but the quality is low and noticeable. It costs less than $80, so I only have myself to blame. I’m 5’9 and 145 pounds, so I ordered a small. It fits me well enough expect it’s tight around the shoulders.<br /><br />I don’t know who this jacket is for. This jacket appeared (at least online) to be a fashionable jacket, but the moment you see it, you realize the low quality will immediately give away the amount you paid for it. You want to look good? You got to pay more than this. Do yourself a favor and spend more at the more well-know brands."
3.0,fit ok but waist band very tight. tighter in some colors.
3.0,"Not high quality, but a cute pair to get you through a sunny season or two.  The tortoise color/print is very nice."
3.0,"Print quality...great<br />Colors....great<br />Fabric quality...great, as expected<br /><br />Fit/Construction.....failed. Fits nothing like it's shown in the advertisement.  If I'm a non-Guyanese and I'm looking at this product I wouldn't know what it reads or what the design actually is! This mask was sewn in a TUBULAR form. Totally straight up and down, instead of going out wider at the SHOULDERS to make it fit as shown in the ad. Very disappointed in the way this mask was made. Doesn't sit at your neck properly ( no matter how I try to fix it straight). You need to adjust your pattern. Bought a few of these masks, can't remember if they're all from you but some may be going back if this problem is consistent throughout. Elastic at the nose does fit nicely though.<br />I'm giving you 3 stars because this is still a nice product.  Although I dread to know what will happen with people with a ""thicker"" neck (men).<br /><br />Marcelle Simon"
3.0,I shrunk this terribly in cold wash and air dry. Gave it to a thinner sister.
3.0,Cute shirt and made well but runs small. I would go up a size
3.0,I gave 3 stars because of the bottom of the flip flop having holes. They should not add these holes. If they kept it flat without the holes like my Telics... I would have given them 5 stars. Pebbles get jammed in holes and drop out periodically in my house and do damage to my vacuum. Took me a while to figure out why pebbles were showing up all over my house. I also have concern for a sharp object going into my foot because not much cushion left beyond the holes. They are very comfortable and have great support for my high arches. Please make these without the holes... because the price was right for me.
3.0,"Material is poly spandex and rather heavy. I am taller (5'9&#34;) and it is just not long enough for me, I am returning."
3.0,"The sleeves hang way too low from the shoulders. I love the style so I cut off the sleeves, re-sewed them higher on the shoulder and now they fit right."
3.0,"Not crazy about the fit. Material was nice and cozy but I didn't like the sleeve length (too short) and the waist band too constricting. I gave it away, after two wears."
3.0,"It's really cool looking, but ... the material goes straight across the face at the nose instead of downward slopping from nose so covers up your eyes.  If your handy at sewing it shouldn't take too much work to remedy.  Otherwise great mask, comes with filter, and arrives very quickly."
3.0,I'm 6'2&#34; and 220 lbs.  I'm not a small guy.  I still have to put the watch on the tightest setting to fit properly.  There is no size option when purchasing this item.  So unless you have very large wrists.  Skip this product<br /><br />Update:  Seller offered full refund.  Their customer service was excellent and polite.  Also wanted my opinion on how to improve the product.  Kudos.
3.0,It looks good but very poorly-made... Skip it...
3.0,"These shoes are cute, but scuff easily and aren’t nearly as comfy as other boots from Dr. Scholl’s."
3.0,"A little smaller than what I thought it would be. But, it is wearable."
3.0,Este pakete no benia  en el pakete los demas si estava  en el paquete solo falta este anillo azul y queria saver que paso con el perdido  benia incompleto  gracia  buen dia espero respuesta
3.0,"It is very cute, i like the fabric. The only thing I can complain about is the boobs part I really don't like that it doesn't hug me they way I want. Maybe that a personal issue but if you have a small body with large breast you would look great in it."
3.0,Comfy but very little compression
3.0,Shoes we adorable but I ordered a size 2 but the fit like a 1.
3.0,"I thought the compression would be a little tighter, however, they're quite comfortable. I only wish they were a little bit longer as to properly tuck in like an undershirt."
3.0,These are basically rip stop fabric pants with front pads on legs. I wear 36x32 and these are a little tight.  I tend to like a bit more waist room. I plan to wear them at my next scenario event.
3.0,Cute sweater but it wasn't the color I ordered.  The light cream/tan-ish color is a burnt orange color. I kept it anyway for the fall.
3.0,"The color is different, it is not black is grey, not as the photograph"
3.0,"Set is very pretty, however, please be aware that the hearts in the necklace are attached together, they don't bend."
3.0,"After a while, I ran into some issues.  The wood keep nicely, but the metal starts to break down against my wrist and doesn't look as nice.  The time kept ok at first, but was a little fast.  It gradually got worse.  The date dial suddenly stopped working one day a few months into ownership as well.<br />The design concept was nice, though, and I like that I didn't need to add batteries."
3.0,Gotv these for my boys ages 5 & 3. They are cute they haven't held up well. The boys wear them at home when it's cold so they slip on the wood floor. A couple pairs already have holes in the big toe. You may have better luck if your kids are not as active or if you wear them as outing socks.
3.0,"Recipient wasn't sure how to really identify platinum but found some gold and silver pickers.  Most of his finds were ""dust"" size so not as much kept as expected."
3.0,"Looks and feels great. It's not long enough to tuck my keys into my back pocket but it does its job well. I a lot easier to remove and insert key rings than other belt loop key chains I've used. Quality is Good to okay, the stitching is already coming apart near the stainless. Other than that, a good gift and product."
3.0,I used it for a family photo shoot for our baby girl
3.0,"Nothing to crazy, just soap, brush, and a towel."
3.0,These are very pretty but they do not hang loose. By that I mean they are apt to catch and twist around so they don’t have a nice loose feel when they are on you. You feel like you have to keep straightening them.
3.0,Family did not like the fit on me. I liked the design but returned cause just not liked how I looked in it
3.0,"The size chart said 32DD and 32E was a size Medium but that’s obviously not true. This bra didn’t fit me at all. I should have ordered a Large but now Large isn’t available at all. It’s a shame because I really love the color and design. It would have been the perfect wire-free workout bra. I love the thick, adjustable straps and the velcro is actually nice. The cup size was just way too small. Don’t trust the size chart if you have a big cup size. Size up if you can."
3.0,"The top fits irregular, neck stretched, shirt to short. Bottoms a bit to short when she sits down. I would recommend ordering a size bigger than normal. I haven’t washed them yet so I can’t tell how well they hold up. I bought two sets and I wouldn’t buy again."
3.0,Not quite as cute as the picture. Hangs below the earlobe and a little in the heavy side
3.0,The size was not great but it was still nice.
3.0,Cute color! Could of been good except the fabric started rip literally as I putting it on. Hole in front already. Just not sown good at all. Was a little big on me. I’m 5’9 and 235lb
3.0,Clasp broke on the necklace the first time I put it on.
3.0,Puckered up badly after washer and dryer!
3.0,"Very stylish, not your typical hoodie sweater. Reasonably priced however the zipper can be improved. Wouldn’t mind paying a couple dollars more for a better made zipper.  I could give this a solid 4 stars but the zipper blew it...Not sure how long it will hold up."
3.0,The dress is great. I’m disappointed because when I ordered the pictures included the accessory kit listed as included as did the description/write up. I was expecting it to come.
3.0,Im going to wear this product however if you are tall its not for you the only reason its going to do is because its for an old school party im 5 10 they are very short
3.0,Broke within a couple of days of having it. Sad.
3.0,It wasn’t quite my style
3.0,Very boxy fit.  Also very difficult to get it ironed and ware able.  Washing it and hanging did NOTHING to get the wrinkled from it being packaged out.
3.0,"This is a great looking watch, the only problem with it is the standard size wristband that isn't a standard size. The wristband is almost too small for me to be able to wear the watch. I am a bigger guy, but I buy cheap watches all the time that say they have a standard size band and they fit great, If ordering this watch and you are a bigger person make sure you order this watch with a larger band then a standard size."
3.0,"The top fits fine but bottoms are too small. Would definitely go up 2 sizes, I only went up one."
3.0,"Edit- I love how supportive and sexy this bra is. But after wearing it for a full day I’m disappointed at the comfort of it. I have skin welts on either side of my Torso from the bra.  I’m hoping it just needs a break in period but it’s not looking favorable. Removed 2 stars due to this. I’ll try a few more wearings because it’s so darn sexy yet supportive, I’ll update review if anything changes.<br /><br />Took a chance on this bra. I’m used to having to spend $50+ to get a bra that fits me decently. I ordere 36DDD, and it fits like a glove. Very supportive and sexy. Only drawback was there are 4 hooks on the closure. I assume due to the cup size. It’s not enough of a drawback to warrant removing any stars I’ll live with it because the rest of the bra is perfect."
3.0,I like the style and the fit of the waist is good. The shorts do bind up on my thighs during breast stroke making it hard to get a good kick. Nice style but I will not use them for swimming laps.
3.0,"Delivery was fine, came on time, etc.  They are effective in shielding the wind, as earmuffs do;  they are a tad bit too big for my small head, but it's fine.  They DO NOT look as pictured, however.  I bought them because of the plush, extra soft luxurious look they had in the pictures.  Don't be fooled, they're just regular thin fleece earmuffs.  There is no plush black fur lining, and the earmuffs themselves are not any kind of furry or soft on the outside.  Just fleece."
3.0,Bought these for 11 yr old girl- she wore holes into them within a couple of weeks-at the toe bend. They were cute but not very comfortable- but at her age she cared more about the cute.
3.0,"It is ok, the gold coloring is much darker than what is in the picture"
3.0,Very cheaply made and headband isnt to durable but would be great for one or two uses- costume or play!
3.0,I wanted light blue shorts which is how these appeared in the photo.  They are actually turquoise
3.0,Fits but it's a lil small and short love the opening in the shirt the arm area is a lil wierd will post pics later
3.0,I first ordered an extra large in this and it was 4 inches to big so I returned it for the large which I received today and it is2 inches to small. There should NOT be a 6 inch change from one size to the next. Thing that really is to bad is the coat it really cute but if it doesn't fit....
3.0,* Update: I was very pleased that he company reached out and offered a full refund after the 30 day return policy on the item. It really is a pretty bag.<br /><br />I had this bag for less than a month before the latch ring and leather piece fell off the side of the bag.
3.0,"I am 5'4 and I ordered a medium..  it's a cute romper but it was too short in the torso.  It's definitely cute but I think If I got a lg , it'd be too baggy."
3.0,This dress is stretchie  Not sure if I will keep<br />It. I am going to try it on again and go from there
3.0,Cute but does not hang off shoulder. Runs small.
3.0,Cheaper made than I expected
3.0,Little loose but for day to day and rough use..
3.0,Too big for my 6years old daughter
3.0,"Super wrinkly out of the package and clearly wrinkle-prone, not very tailored looking, and no lining. Fits more like a lab coat than a nice blazer. Definitely needs to be dry cleaned so the fact of was cheap is completely negated. Won’t be buying the other colors I have in my cart."
3.0,The material is kind of heavy & a bit too thick to feel totally comfortable in.
3.0,"This is a decent suit for the price, but it’s not designed for even the moderately tall person. I’m 5’8” (135 lbs) and it pulls my posture into a slight hunch if I’m not careful; I can’t imagine anyone even a tiny bit taller would be comfortable. I ordered a medium, but this suit has the strange ability to be both too small and too large at the same time, as it’s also loose fitting in the abdomen while being short enough to pull at my shoulders."
3.0,"It's a very comfortable light support bra, but not made for anyone with brrasts larger than a DD. I wear a 40 DDD and my brests were spilling over."
3.0,They are so short- barely past my knees abs I’m short. The elastic in the waist is super thin.
3.0,"Quality is ok for the price, but the crotch area is a lighter color and it does look quite strange"
3.0,this product is more quantity then quality. you get what you pay for. cute but a bit tacky with the fake diamonds
3.0,"Everyone loves this top, but do not put it in the dryer because the decal starts to crack."
3.0,"These look adorable on my wife, but they do lose a bit of there fuzziness and they start to matt after a few washes. If you plan to use these lightly, they are a good buy."
3.0,"I'm 5'8. Unfortunately, this dress was too short for me."
3.0,It's a little thin and without something underneath you can see right through the top.
3.0,"These shorts are very nice. I like the nice warm  navy color, style, how lightweight and cool they seem. They would be perfect for a woman with a longer torso.  I have other shorts (Nike, Adidas and rbx) with a 3"" inseam, just like these shorts, that fit perfectly. If I fold over the waistband of these shorts they are the right length. I love these shorts but they are too long waisted for this short girl (4'7"")"
3.0,"Reviews said the medium was small so I sized up and the Large is way too large, I will have to hem the seem.<br />The material is really nice, and the print is cool."
3.0,"I have a 45w charger that I use on my Note 10+. The phone is capable if ""Super Charging"".  I can go from 0% to 100% in an hour.<br /><br />So I figured a 65w charger would do the same and I'd have a spare. But this just ""fast charges"" my phone. So I just use it for my laptop converted tablet."
3.0,I actually had to modifiy the dress because it just didn't fit quite right around the chest. its still cute tho
3.0,It was much shorter then I expected. I defentely needed to wear leggings under it.
3.0,They were a little big for my three year olds hands and I could feel that moisture was soaking through. My son's hands weren't terribly cold but I expected them to be a lot drier. I will probably look for another pair next season.
3.0,"Super cute, didn't rust or change my naval green. I like longer chains on my belly rings since my torso is so short. It just didn't last very long the chain broke off in random pieces about 2 weeks into wearing it."
3.0,"They run a little small but overall are cute cheap sweats. The rainbow is just a ribbon sewn down the side so it doesn’t stretch a ton, but for the price it’s fine."
3.0,Dress was too small and showed too much inappropriately
3.0,I can see my undergarments through this material.  I will be returning it.
3.0,"I like the fit although it runs big. It's stays on very well. It also covers up very well.  Unfortunately, it is not very absorbent. It is very lightweight. I wouldn't purchase again, but it works well enough not to send back."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:98cce7e81d40d4fae6f3c68a34c8d7fc]] Fast shipping looks good but feels very cheap and very thin. You get what u pay for
3.0,Beautiful but to small
3.0,"Hi, I ordered the large shorts as I noticed they may come<br />in a smaller fit, but I needed the medium shorts.  My fault.<br />The strings in the front of the suit are bulky and looks bad<br />on the body.  Otherwise, they're good!  I'll still wear them."
3.0,The straw quality is cheap less good compared to cat an jack brand at target. The bow and ribbon came half unglued and already fallling apart . The purse is cute but overall would not buy again
3.0,"My husband liked the outfit the shorts were a perfect fit, the shirt was a little short but otherwise fit the chest and arm area. The shirt is why I gave it 3 stars"
3.0,"First off let me say that I do LOVE these Kate Kasin skirts! I own one of the plaid and one of the velvet leopard designs in 2X. They fit very nicely on my body and can be dressed up very professionally!<br /><br />That being said, I have 1 MAJOR con about one of the skirts. I bought both skirts for business school to wear in classroom settings. I've worn the plaid skirt multiple times and I've had no problems with it.<br /><br />However, the velvet leopard skirt RIDES. UP. LIKE. CRAZY! I wore the skirt once to school so far, and I usually have my backpack on me for supplies. Because the inside of the velvet skirt has such easy slip, it literally goes from knee-length to mid-thigh in 5 seconds whenever I'm walking around on campus with my backpack on. With no backpack it's totally fine, but with my backpack on I'm literally having to hold it down or pull down on it constantly! I'm going to try buying some cotton slip shorts used for underlining to see if that helps any. Until then, I refuse to wear the velvet leopard skirt again unless it's outside of class (and maybe not even then).<br /><br />I would give both of them 5 stars, but the issue with the velvet skirt makes me give them 3 stars overall. If wearing the slip helps any, then I may change my review later on. I also included my measurements to help with sizing.<br /><br />Height: 5' 3""<br />Weight: 225-230 lbs.<br />Bust: 46""<br />Waist: 35""<br />Hips: 48"""
3.0,"It took me a while to get used to the nose, still not really sure I'm in love with them.. they are a bit tight on the bridge but they don't let water in, after about 1500 yards though I have to take them off and rub a bit so that's not overly awesome. Other than that, they are pretty good."
3.0,"It's a beautiful purse. It's generous size. But....... It is too heavy. It's heavy before you put anything in it. The handle was very uncomfortable in my hand when I carried it in the house. It was an instant, &#34;I need to send this back.&#34; I do wish it had worked. It is so beautiful. It does have a shoulder strap but I only use that for a cross body strap. This would have been way too heavy for that. Maybe they could make this as a little backpack."
3.0,the crystals look a bit shaky
3.0,The fits very well. Very flattering. Unfortunately the one I received was damaged.
3.0,"This robe is a little small, and the material is clingy, Which does not help at all. I love the color, and the design is great!"
3.0,No elastic in body of sock. Falls down.
3.0,Pretty but too tight
3.0,The listing says these come with a belt and elastic waist... inaccurate description...pants didn’t come with either.
3.0,"Purchased these for my bridesmaids to wear during our wedding and I love them, however a few of them I had to tighten/reattach a few of the dangling strands. Which wasn't a huge deal more of an annoyance. But they were beautiful!"
3.0,My blue aventurine broke wish I could get another one
3.0,Fit is small. I wear a lot of 1x size and bout the 2x size for roominess. Umm...way too tight and I've lost weight.
3.0,"Got the green sweater and I like the color. The material isn't the best, but it's not see-through, at least. It's NOT long like on the model, for sure. It comes to the middle of the pelvis, is all. I was really hoping it would come down longer like on the model. It's fine, but I wouldn't buy it again."
3.0,I'm looking for a sock that doesn't leave huge indents around my ankle.  I tried these and they were very tight around the ankle.  Foot fit fine.  Nice weight and appeared to be good quality but I sent them back due to fit.
3.0,"There was no draw string for the bottoms, so you can’t loosen or tighten them"
3.0,"Meh. Maybe a raver would get some fun with this one but feels exactly at or below its price point- very cheap feeling, gimmicky and toy like. But hey if your looking for a fun disposable time piece this might work for you. Its sized right but the glow strap is very thick and grippy and will drag and catch on everything. The bezel feels like it could fall off and is loose and sloppy. The obscure markings are interesting but maybe more curious. It's definitely unique! Dakota makes some nice watches if you can find them - specifically the diver with both lume and tritium. This watch company is surely thinking outside the box but this one misses if maybe only expecting more from them."
3.0,"If you are a 5'8"" person that weighs 130# you will swim in this vest. It is huge. Naturally I am cold all the time and when I attend high school football games, I freeze. I thought this would be a great solution. However, it's so big, it's bulky and uncomfortable under my coats and I have to turn it way up to heat OVER my heavy-duty jackets. Pair this with the added cost of the battery pack, I would not repurchase. This would make a great gift for my appropriately sized dad WITH the additional purchase of the battery pack, this needs to be factored into the cost of the vest and is the biggest drawback to this purchase."
3.0,Great color and fit however for some reason the back is shorter than the front
3.0,IT WAS OK
3.0,Perfectly fine casual tee.
3.0,"I really liked the pants. The color was exactly what I was looking for and the length was perfect. I'm 5'7, 195lbs, and wear a size 11 in jeans. I ordered the large, they fit but the pockets were awkward. They kept sticking out no matter which way I pushed them. Maybe if I ordered a size up they would lay flat, but then the pants might be too big around the waist and would be hard to adjust with the zipper in the back. Overall, I'm pleased."
3.0,"Not much to say cause wearing masks is never very comfortable, but it’s cute and I get a lot of compliments on it!"
3.0,"I ordered this for my wife and she was complaining that it is too tight and she has a small hands. That is the only main issue, other than that it is well crafted and has good quality. I am thinking of returning this back.<br />If you are medium I suggest to order the large size."
3.0,"These pj’s would be great except that the waist is much too small. I have a pair already in medium, but they are too big, so I ordered this pair in small. Everything was good except the waist is impossibly too tight and can’t really be fixed. Too bad!"
3.0,It fits somewhat ok but not entirely.  Hard to find shorts that fit correctly.
3.0,"Runs small, I ordered an XL and it fits more like a L or even medium. Arms are tight. Overall style and quality are as expected otherwise."
3.0,"I liked the fit and cut of the dress (I'm 5'9&#34; and 140 lbs), but the fabric was so thin I don't think I'll ever wear it outside the house or maybe to the beach."
3.0,"The watch came with a dead battery. Fortunately I had the necessary tools and a battery to take care of it. The chrono dials had the hands installed incorrectly. They reset to odd positions. (7, 3 & 1 O'clock) The link removal tool provided came with the push pin bent. Even with the obvious issues I still gave it 3 stars because it does keep pretty good time and looks pretty good. If the manufacturer would just install the little plastic spacer under the stem that keeps the battery from running down and up their Q/C a bit this would be a 5 star deal."
3.0,Looks okay but I wouldn't buy again
3.0,Very delicate. So pretty & simple. Wear with casual or dress.
3.0,"This skirt is cute but I got a medium, which is what I wear in just about every style, and it's much too big to be a high waisted skirt. It falls at my hips."
3.0,I have not used yet since CDC said this style was a poor choice for stopping coronavirus! Great for allergies I hear!
3.0,"Light weight, looks awesome; however its a little hard to wear and adjust to fit face."
3.0,"The lettering falls off after one wash. 8 love the sure, but the silk screen lettering is a disappointment"
3.0,Glad I got the clear ones too.
3.0,The print is beautiful but I found the size medium too large. Especially the shorts. Im about 5'8 and 157 so I thought medium. Ig small might have fit better
3.0,"They are a little small, and I don't have a large head.  The material is cotton and not stretchy."
3.0,"I think it’s a good set for the price. Not high quality silk, but the price reflects that. The set runs true to size. I think it’s a cute set for a gift too."
3.0,"The size fit as expected, but I didn't like the material. It was very stiff so it hurt my toes. I also could feel the threading around the edges of the shoe which I could tell was going to hurt if I wore them for the day. I returned mine. Very disappointing because I always like the Bandolino brand."
3.0,"I like that it’s not tight at all, it’s too loose up top. Definitely better if for a bustier body type"
3.0,":(<br />they have begun to rust, i thought they were sterling silver. I really loved these too."
3.0,"The face of this watch is just to small, have had Casio watches similar to this one for years, but none of them were this small, even the wrist band barley fits. But it does keep time, so all is not lost."
3.0,I didn’t like the material used. The picture presented a different look
3.0,Lower quality but you get what you pay for .
3.0,Very soft and comfortable but ran really small.
3.0,Se encoge muy rápido y corre un size menos.
3.0,"Too small , seller should list the overall measurement"
3.0,"Good quality and shield your eyes nicely. But the ends of the arms are just too tight around the head. And this pair is pretty wide, so unless you have a 'wide' head yourself you look like you're wearing sunglasses that are too large for you. Shame really I can't use them for these 2 reasons, because they really are good quality and look very nice. For these reasons I can only give 3 stars."
3.0,Doesn't fit right. Stiff in the under arms.
3.0,"I really wanted to like this item, they were the perfect, opaque color I was looking for, and felt very soft to the skin, but they don't stay up very long and need to be ""pulled up"" in the most inconvenient times.  I'm sorry, I purchased based on the size guide, so maybe I need to size down...???  going to go against instructions and wash in lingerie bag and see if they'll shrink...wouldn't hurt, at this point, but I'll let you know how that turns out...!!!"
3.0,Wanted a loose fit. This was too firm fitting. Great material and well made but I won’t be wearing it until I lose some weight. Which I am not big at all. More just curvy but I don’t like a form fitted sweater dress.
3.0,"Very nice looking wallet, but my cards bent and I had to switch back to leather after replacing my visa. Would not swipe due to the damage from the wallet. Perhaps it's the nature of these type of fabric wallets, I don't know"
3.0,"I specifically bought these because I saw there was a chart on the box to tell which stone is what. Well, there are pictures on box that I didn't get and I got ones not on the box.  And it's hard to to tell from pictures if it is same thing. So if you are a beginner, like me, it will be hard to identify what crystals you are getting. But quality seems to be good."
3.0,Loved this! Great size.
3.0,Too heavy and no top closure.
3.0,"It fits. It’s comfortable. It is hard to get on and off because of the torso. However, the models picture gave me an impression that this was a kind of flecked jersey-like green. It’s just a plain army green. Kind of bummed about the color but I’m keeping it."
3.0,Fit as expected but I am very tall for one pieces. Comfortable and made it through the whole event
3.0,Cute but too small for me. I returned it
3.0,"It fits perfect and it’s dainty and cute!<br />The hardest part was finding the hole to stick the rod part in (that’s what she said), but that doesn’t change my rating!<br />I’ll update if it starts to hurt my ear or something but so far so good!<br />Edit***<br />My jem part fell out and it’s only been like 3 days. I bent the rod slightly too. Ugh."
3.0,Like many others I expected 2 key chains.  It is a fine key chain and I would have purchased it if the picture showed just one.
3.0,"Good for a one time use, the white on toe rub off quickly after 1 use."
3.0,its way brighter then in the picture.<br />not such a comfy material.
3.0,Was very pretty but too small. Couldn't figure out how to exchange it for bigger size.
3.0,"Way to small,  get your size twice as big or somthing.  Couldn't even fit mt boozangas in it at all."
3.0,Make sure you know what size you want. They are sized as expected.
3.0,They are really cute and look good but they are kinda low quality
3.0,"I wear a size 18, and ordered this top in a size XL.  It is too snug. I can get it on, but I don't wear my tops that tight. I am losing weight right now, so I am keeping this, as I think it will fit if I lose about 10 lbs. I am 5' 2"", and it covers my bottom and hips."
3.0,The way they hook is something I’ve never seen before. They are very weird. See picture
3.0,"I am keeping these, but buyers should know that mine do NOT have pockets.  I really wanted pockets, but nope, none, despite description and photos indicating shorts have pockets.  I like the fit, but it's smaller than usual.  That's fine with me as I ordered a small and they're often too large for my skinny frame.  They're a nice, thin fabric for summer and look cute, but sad about absence of pockets and false advertising."
3.0,"Thank you very much for sending me the clip-on shades, they fit and work great...  The only problem i had was the shipment came late, even threw the initial notice that the 1st shipment date was changed!!"
3.0,the length. From chest to crotch it isn't long enough. Fit around just not up and down.  Super cute but super small!
3.0,By the reviews it says this product runs small. Usually I order a medium or large in items (depending on top because I’m big busted) I ordered this in a small and definitely needed a medium. I retuned it on the fact I didn’t feel comfortable wearing it. But in general the dress was nicely made and I believe would have been comfortable.
3.0,Its fits weird on me. I'm 5'5 145 lbs. I usually wear a size small but ordered the medium. Something about the way the sleeves are sewn is just uncomfortable
3.0,This is cute but the white is very thin.  Just did not feel comfortable wearing it to work.
3.0,They are not as wide as you would think. The steel toe is extremely narrow and is not well padded. Very irritating where it meets the side of your foot and is painful. I sent them back. Thank you Amazon for your amazing returns policy!
3.0,"I liked this vest very much immediately - fit well, a little bigger than anticipated but OK.  Warm, Comfortable everything I was looking for.  Unfortunately the third time I wore it one of the snap closures popped off totally - which I did not notice till I returned home and wondered why there was a gap.  No Snap!  They are attached like grommets and the snap grips must have given out.  Will have to replace snap, but will now look silly with one mismatched closure............"
3.0,I am pleased with the quality of the bands but find it challenging to remove & replace links to adjust size.  I will have to find a jeweler to make the adjustment for me....
3.0,"Lovely shoes, but tends to flip flop on me. I would need an ankle strap to walk in them properly."
3.0,"This necklace is a glass dome with a photo inside, not gears. It is fine, but not what I thought I was getting."
3.0,Such a cute color. Really pretty but had to return.
3.0,Nice color and durable just fit on the smaller side for men.
3.0,Runs very small. My boyfriend couldn’t wear them
3.0,"The fabric looks cheap, and it's not as pretty or soft as the picture would suggest, but it's ok. A bit disappointed over all, but then again....it was very cheap."
3.0,"Initially, I really liked this sweater. I liked the material. The downside was that, to me, it looked a lot longer and more loose-hanging in the pictures than it did when I got it. Purchased it probably September 2019. I bought an XL, which is my typical size (I am 5'7"" and at that time, was probably around 180-185).  I did not like the band around the bottom, which seems to make the sweater to not hang as loose around the front. I did not really wear it a whole lot before I noted that it began to pill just about everywhere. (Should have washed it inside out - learned that later). I used a sweater shaver on it and it made a little bit of a difference. Overall, I was pleased with it at first, but after just wearing it about less than 10 times I am disappointed in it and wished that I had not purchased it. It also felt small in the lower sleeves.  If you do purchase, and like your sweaters long and loose, either pass on this one or order about 2 sizes larger."
3.0,"These are okay if you plan to wear with something covering your butt bc it has those weird crotch seams. I’d call these compression tights not leggings. There’s also no tummy control as it says bc of the small waist band.. more like tummy smoothing I guess. Again, these are not flattering without some kind of long oversized shirt or a dress."
3.0,"I like the ring, it's pretty and fits well but the surface is rough and kind of sharp, and the little jewels don't have any kind of sparkle to them."
3.0,Size mismatch
3.0,Black pair unsown at the seam. Love the soft texture but the first ones I put on can unstitched at the seam.  I have not worn the others yet so we will see.
3.0,It is great for my female friend but the matching one did not come close to fitting me....
3.0,Only washed it twice and it has lost its shape .
3.0,Dress was way too small. I wear a M but then I ordered a L just to be safe and it didn’t fit me.
3.0,The material pills a bit too much.  Nice fit.
3.0,"i’m 5’4 & weigh 115 pounds, i went for the medium because i didn’t want a tight fit & usually buy mediums any way, but the top is way too big & the adjustable straps just make it ride up awkwardly in the back, so i’ll have to try to remedy that somehow. also the lace on top just seems unnecessary, i think like i saw in another review i will cut it off. this doesn’t matter to me, but the stitching is a lil wonky in places if you care about that sort of thing"
3.0,Super cute key chain. I got it for my brother... it broke though within a few months.
3.0,"Did not like the elastic, returned for refund. Also found neck tight."
3.0,"I love how easy these made my travel! Perfect sizes and perfect amount. Great price too. Unfortunately, after one trip they are fraying and it is past the return window. I can't imagine they will last long at this rate."
3.0,Got these as a gift for my husband on our wedding day to wear. They are very nice looking but I will note they are true suit cufflinks so they are too long to wear with just a button up shirt. Which is sadly why my husband didn't wear them on our wedding day.
3.0,Size does not fit all.  It is for people size up to 6 US.  Very small.
3.0,They were too big on the ear. Also the gold did not seem as nicely finished as the ones purchased directly from Moisenite
3.0,Sin como peligroso se enreda uno mucho cuando camina siempre se siente que tropieza
3.0,"Neckline much lower in display photo than actual shirt. Was a little big too, ordered small, Fits like a medium/large would. Fabric is nice, back looks nice, but front is crew neck not low at all."
3.0,"The product is cute, love the box the chain comes in, but the size is exaggerated in the photos it is much smaller in person"
3.0,"top looked too frilly in person, and the shoulders were incredibly tight. the bottom is also not as high waisted as it appears. still okay."
3.0,These look as pictured and thanks to amazon prime they arrived in 2 days.  I am not sure to exchange because they are so narrow I don't know that a size up would do the job.  I usually wear size 8 1/2-9 womans.  I ordered a 9 because everyone was saying they were true to size. I DISAGREE and I don't have a wide foot but I don't have a narrow foot either.  I'm pretty bummed they don't fit. They are cute.
3.0,"I don't know if this item was too small or too big to be honest, it just didn't do the job of covering and supporting my boobs.  When I first put it on it was pretty great, I loved the idea of not having to reach behind my back and hook this bra.  However, once I started walking around and moving, my boobs were pretty much hanging 1/2 way out.  It's not so much that it was too small, it's just there is no way to adjust the bra to make it stay put so it sorta moves around in weird ways.  I think really it was too big...meaning the strap around the body/back...but, like I said, there is no way to tighten it so it just sorta drifts around once you start moving."
3.0,My boyfriend brought it for me back in January for my birthday. Was extremely sweet of him. He brought it in a rose gold color. However my once rose gold beautiful necklace is now a rusty looking silver necklace. I can't no longer wear due to causes my neck to breakout.  I gave it a 3 star rating due to the facts I had mentioned previously. I hope this will help someone. Enjoy it while it last 😁.
3.0,The actual color of the scarf is different than the picture. It's more orange. It did not match the outfit with which I intended to use it. I still like the scarf and use it with different outfits.
3.0,"For the price, these keyrings are good quality and the colors are bright and shiny. However, product pictures show jump rings but when I received them, no jump rings were included. I guess I should have read the reviews as many others did not receive jump rings with their order as well. I might consider these again in the future but the lack of jump rings when they are pictured is a huge disappointment."
3.0,"Received it and loved the fabric and color. Upon first wear, the seam separated about 1 and 1/2 in. on the right arm."
3.0,Little smaller than mostly brands in my size
3.0,Dry leather
3.0,Does not fit!
3.0,My dad said it was OK
3.0,"Not bad, A little big for a size small though."
3.0,"My SO is an Illini graduate, and I really like this graphic. The tee is a tee....it's heavy, thick material. My one complaint is it is a &#34;boxy&#34; fit toward the bottom. He's 6' 2&#34; so perhaps on someone shorter the bottom would be less boxy since it would fall lower on the bodice."
3.0,"It looks and feels ok,especially the sweat band inside it...however it does not fit well behind the ears and my ears hurt after a 12 hour shift from where it’s wrinkled up and scrunched up around the ear area."
3.0,Good fit but very thin. Definitely requires an undershirt.
3.0,"I like that you don’t have to pierce your ears, however my granddaughters ears became very red on the lobe of her ears."
3.0,Good but left the design imprint  on my legs and didn't like that
3.0,It's nice but it could be longer and a belt or tie should have been included.
3.0,"I actually loved the suit, as did my 6 year old granddaughter. The colors and design are beautiful and showed the Shopkins characters in vivid color. We didn't love the size.  This is in no way a 6X.  My granddaughter wears 6 and 6x in all of her clothes.  She is a slim girl and yet I could not get this past her waist.  It was very disappointing to have to send it back."
3.0,These sandals are cheaply made other than looks okay. Can't really use them daily during the summer as they wouldn't last long otherwise worth the price I guess
3.0,"Is a little hard to shop here when the sizes are impossible and the measurements seem to be always wrong. My son is 13 and he measures 5'4"" 110-115 pounds. I bought him a large and it was humongous. Beautiful bright hoodie tough. Beautiful enough to keep until he grows into it."
3.0,"i recieved these bangles with earrings and  that was in sone package i returned these both in same package and both had same labels same order no and everything but i only received update for refund for earrings but not for these bangles i want to know why?<br />beautiful bangles, very elegant and looks real but sadly i am returning them because many stones came out from both of these bangles during shipping, and will buy different bangles in same color stones again.."
3.0,Came too small. Had to give it away.
3.0,The ring gets caught on everything. Stones are a dingy look to them
3.0,quality poor.
3.0,"First let me say, I love the material. It was wrinkled when I received it. Put it in the dryer, every wrinkle gone w/in 15 minutes. Love that.<br /><br />However, I ordered a medium which is the size I wear, and it was tight across the chest area (and I was wearing a minimizer bra). It also feels tight across the shoulders, and I'm not a tight end, so it should have felt fine. If I'd ordered a large, it would have gone down way below my cleavage. I'm one of those that gets ticked off having to buy a shirt to go under a shirt just to cover up the girls. However, if you don't' have a problem with an extra shirt underneath, you should do fine. Just make sure you order one size larger.<br /><br />Overall a nice shirt if you can get the right fit. Unfortunately, I don't see a place I can wear mine out in public w/o fear of tearing the shoulders or popping a button off."
3.0,These are true cycling shorts with the compression liner inside. Not for my guys!
3.0,"The material is not what I expected, it’s ok tho."
3.0,I loved this dress when I say it online and when I ordered it I ordered a size up and when I got it it was still too small. I got the package as expected and the dress was beautiful.
3.0,Wild Kratts my grandchild’s favorite but this shirt was way too HUGE.  Runs big. Also a slinky fabric
3.0,They were alittle different from the pictures and had a hole on the right leg
3.0,"I have longer arms and the sleeves on this are too short for me, but I wear it over a black long sleeve shirt which helps. Just wish the sleeves were longer"
3.0,"Runs very small, cheap quality, maybe good for one or two wears. The hem came apart after first wear. Cute though, if it fits. Size up."
3.0,Bought it for my daughter to wear as a flower girl. That’s the only time she wore it. The bow didn’t even make to the end of the night. It came off at the start of the reception. Sucks.
3.0,The top is nice but I prefer a longer length.  I washed it and shrinkage length wise.
3.0,Casting quality of ring is not as addvertised. Expected a better quality ring. That being said ring does look as pictured just not as clean and crisp.
3.0,It served it's pupose :-)
3.0,"Cute.  MUCH, MUCH smaller than you would expect."
3.0,Pretty good golf shirt. Not the best I've purchased but certainly not the worst. I was hoping for it to stretch a little more but it still is comfortable.
3.0,Yes I'll buy another pair.
3.0,Same style but heavier material than pictured so it doesn’t hang correctly and slightly different color. Runs large.
3.0,"I've ordered 3 sets of these, and excepting the ""gold"" frame version of set, love these as they fit my face/head best, light weight and stylishly clean.<br /><br />Unfortunately the ear / temple support break frequently and unexpectedly at hinge location. I have salvaged several using pieces from ""gold"" frame which I do NOT use (just not my color) ... however this is not a desirable nor practical solution. Either the size of plastic at hinge screw hole location is too thin to tolerate normal use, or another more durable material should be used as these are clearly deficient for practical use/longevity. ALL have broken as I use them over time, relegating me to purchasing new set of 5. I'm a mature business person so do take care / do not abuse, but normal wear and tear supersedes durability of these glasses.<br /><br />Secondly, I would like option to order specific colors of these glasses ONLY, not limited to ""set"" of glasses with ""gold"" which are a waist as I do NOT use them, color not good for me.<br /><br />May order again, but looking for alternative / more practically durable product with similar style, frame size and widths going forward."
3.0,"The pencil was much smaller than I imagined. But I think what bothers me the most is the cord it is on. It's pretty thin. I am not expecting it to last very long. It's cute, though. But I think overall it is overpriced."
3.0,"Bought to use as an art smock, but its much smaller than anticipated. Would really work better as a bib with sleeves."
3.0,The product looked great but I thought it was overpriced. The adjustable hat would not fit over a wig even on the largest position so I just safety pinned it to the wig and that worked fine.
3.0,The inside pills on the inside leaving orange fuzz I'm my shirt.
3.0,I'm 5'6 and weigh 153lbs. I read a review that if you are about my size a large would fit just right but I would have preferred an x-L instead.
3.0,"This is the second time I have bought these, I don't know why I expected different results. The fabric is cheap, like really cheap, the price should match the quality."
3.0,I bought the largest they come and from what I read in the comments/size chart they should of fit.  They were tight on my thighs which made them short in the top area.  I wish they would of been baggy.  I'm returning.
3.0,"These are such cute boots! No problem there. When I opened the box they came in the boots had scuffs along the back of the heel. Very disappointed for a pair of leather boots that cost that much! Also, the boots run narrow. I never have a problem with that in shoes but these ones run narrow!"
3.0,I didn’t like the material and the fit.
3.0,Not sure if the zipper or the handle will hold up... we'll see.
3.0,Sizing is incorrect
3.0,"Honestly, I got my monies worth as it was pretty inexpensive. Very see thru- must wear a slip"
3.0,"Not for adults. It’s very small and hot to put on. Claustrophobic folks will only use it once. It doesn’t curve up like the images suggest. I doubt it's durable. Not worth the phone call to request a refund.<br /><br />Let's hope it would be useful to some child in our extended family. Otherwise, it will be recycled."
3.0,Smaller than actual size
3.0,The original socks I ordered are not made anymore this was the substitute. They are not true to size and very long. They also are not the same nice quality much thinner. I hate my socks bunching up at my toes
3.0,"Material is a bit thin for compression style, well made."
3.0,Platform of shoe is very straight so doesn’t fit high arch feet
3.0,It's a bit too large but I'm making it work for now. I do like that I could resize the length which is the main reason I purchased it. When I purchase a new one it will have to be smaller than the suggested size according to the size chart.
3.0,This is the 2nd band like this I have purchased. This one wasnt as wide as the other and seems to slip a bit. I got used to it. The reason I give it 3 stars is because the color started to wear off in the first month of wearing it.
3.0,After reading all the reviews I decided to go with a larger size and I'm glad I did.  They definitely run small but are very cute very comfortable and very sexy. not the best quality - so we'll see how they hold up .. hopefully they don't fall apart in the wash
3.0,"This was too small, I was still able to put it on, but it’s tight and did’t give me the more loose  fit that I wanted"
3.0,I bought this for myself but did not like the chain being so short against my neck so I gave it to my niece as a gift and she absolutely loved it she wears it everyday
3.0,"The glass is fine, blue blocking’s is fine, but the smell of the nose pads is terrible. The off gassing of the plastic nose pads is overwhelming and can’t possibly be good to inhale. It smells like you’re wearing burning plastic on your nose."
3.0,"Went by measurement chart, too small"
3.0,Deserves 5 stars but the zipper was broken when purse arrived.
3.0,Original look!<br />Comfy!
3.0,"In the first aspect it is nice jean, but it stretches a lot, like a party balloon, creo that you can put on the person who even has 2 more sizes. The color and style type ""washed"" is very beautiful. The only thing I don't like is the metal Buffalo logo stuck to the right back pocket. It does not look like the Buffalo but rather a louse or tick. Possibly this logo is only used in ash -X models, I have seen that in other buffalo jean models the most beautiful logo is used. But will use it sometimes."
3.0,"Some compression but where the sock ends across my foot, feels like its cutting off my blood supply"
3.0,"It's lovely, but one of the chains broke off and the latch was missing."
3.0,Very pretty but my face is very thin so mast was a bit baggie ..wish it came in different sizes .
3.0,"Overall I like it, had to fix a few holes in the hem stitching"
3.0,I have a fallen arch and plantar and I can clearly see that the orthotic in the shoe is allowing my right foot to bend inward.  I'm 215 lbs.  I find the shoe comfortable but not supportive enough.
3.0,Fingers too long but fit otherwise
3.0,Didn't even work when it arrived.<br />The band is half metal and half chrome covered plastics. Had to return.
3.0,I should have read the reviews but I trusted Turkish quality. I shouldn't have. Very thin and poorly made! I'm extremely disappointed.
3.0,"So so small, wish it was a little bigger :/"
3.0,"It’s cute but NOT authentic at all, which explains the price."
3.0,Missing letter
3.0,This isn't really a corset. It's more of a fashion piece. It's made out of a beautiful thick black material that is very stretchy.<br />If you are in good shape this would be a great outfit accessory. However if you plan to use this to synch your belly or define your waste line this corset will not work. The ribbing is too thin and fat just ends up bulging out of the sides making you look like a pack of not dogs.<br />I'm going to put this away until I get in better shape.
3.0,Its cute and soft but a little dirty when i got it.
3.0,"This is my second set; Nightmare Before Christmas is my other.  I'm not as happy with this one.<br />The pants are super soft, comfy, and a little stretchy.  The Thumper top has the fleece outside but is scratchy on the inside; my other set wasn't like that.  If I had purchased Thumper first, I wouldn't have gotten another; the top isnt comfortable."
3.0,The material is soft and looks just like the picture but the two thumb holes are very different sizes and it reeked of smoke when I took it out of the package. I’m not overly disappointed just because of the low price
3.0,I love the purse but one of the belts that go across the end of the purse will not stay buckled I don't know if it is broken or place on the purse incorrectly but It will not stay in place.  The rest of the purse is awesome though.
3.0,"Can’t stand shoes wear flip flop all time. Even with my fat caves they fit, keep my toes warm inside in winter"
3.0,I really wanted to love this but it is rough. The material feels really cheap and it wrinkles easily.
3.0,"So, apparently there are words all over this dress, but unless you zoom in on the picture you'd never know. Even better, it's not consistent...  some areas read &#34;Focus on the good&#34; other areas just read &#34;Focus o&#34; or &#34;Focus on the g&#34; (kinda funny as least). It runs a little small and it's not that bad of a print, but had I known it came with an inspirational message in the print, I wouldn't have gotten it"
3.0,"Although my mom loves her key chain, the engraving definitely appears to be done in large quantities. I would not buy again."
3.0,"If you are big busted, this top fits strangely"
3.0,This is a pretty dress but had an odd fit. I probably will never wear it. The waist is small. So sad about it because it took a month to receive it. I will never order anything that takes that long to receive again.
3.0,"Bulky, but will work for me. I was hoping they would be a tad smaller."
3.0,Thought I would love it but its a bit cheap looking imo
3.0,"Runs small. You should definitely size up. Otherwise, I would have been satisfied with the product"
3.0,I’ve bought multiple pair of these in a lot of colors but for reason the black ones NEVER come the right size. I bought them once in a small and they looked like children leggings I couldn’t even believe what I bought LOL. The second time I bought a medium and they were still relatively small but the stretch helped. The black ones just do not feel or fit the same as other colors I’ve ordered.
3.0,"This is a well constructed shapewear piece and if it fit I can tell it would have worked well. Unfortunately it did not fit my body. For reference I wear a size 10 with a large bust, small waist, and wider hips (measurements 34, 29, 39) so very curvy. I purchased the shapewear in a size large for an event I had to wear a tight body con dress and I just wanted to smooth everything out. The piece was too big and too long. Because of this there wasn't much smoothing and the zipper created very noticeable ripples under the dress. I ended up not being able to wear it for the event. Despite this, if it weren't too large, this would be a nice set of shapewear. I easily could have gotten a medium, maybe even a small if I wanted to risk it. Be aware that sizing larger than expected."
3.0,its pretty.
3.0,The arms are too short
3.0,"Didn’t work, and it’s been returned. The quality was nice however I have small wrists.... and I took out all the links and it was still very big"
3.0,"My daughter picked this backpack out and I thought it was a good price. We have had it a month and only used it for 2 weeks of school and I have already had to do a few repairs. MANY and I do mean MANY threads from sewing the bag were hanging out everywhere right when I first opened the box. I tied knots and melted the ends carefully hoping that was it. But more threads keep coming loose and I question how long they will hold together. The bottle holders, zippers, seams, straps, and simply everywhere. The Zipper for the front pocket came off last week (end of week 2), I put it back with some care and patience and used a safety pin to help secure it. But seriously...? It looks cute but it is CHEAPLY made...."
3.0,"Bought for my husband. We have been buying Saucony shoes for years, but this pair did not fit. I bought his usual size."
3.0,This skirt was kind of restricting and sat at the wrong places!
3.0,"I wear a medium, so the fit was perfect, just not right for me. It did not flatter my body in the way that I imagined and the place on the shoulders is not as beautiful as shown. Looked cheap. The fabric of the dress is thick and has a little stretch. It is a cute design, but the Lace work needs work and the flare is not as dramatic which are the reasons I returned this product."
3.0,"Good quality from what I can tell right out of the package, but I was sent two moons instead of a sun and moon."
3.0,Nice but needs to be a bit longer to be knew high
3.0,I loved these but had to send back as they ran two sizes too small.. I am a size 10 and the large was too small😝 If you have no chest or hips these are beautiful..
3.0,I was kinda disappointed with the sleeves and the material was not exactly what I expected.
3.0,The photo makes them look more fitted through to the ankle.
3.0,"A little small in the bust, so you need to wear a cami underneath"
3.0,"age 35, 5'7, 200 lbs. I got this as I thought maybe this would be modest enough to walk around in before bed/middle of the night, but yet slightly sexier than old t-shirts I normally wear. Ya know, spice things up a bit. well... um, its not sexy. it is NOTHING like the pic. although, she is sexy and thin, so maybe that is why? I've got some thickness on me, but this thing hangs, it sags, the buttons don't really keep it closed, which is super weird because this is certainly NOT tight on me. Think 'hospital gown-ish"" but with a front closure. I was wearing it though cuz I was hoping I was over analyzing this but then my teenager saw me in it one morning and started laughing and said I looked like my old Aunt who wears old sleeping dresses around.. aka,, mumu dress.  but if you are looking for that, this is certainly comfortable, has a nice soft fabric and doesn't get bunched around my legs at night."
3.0,Pretty nifty product but nothing to write home to mom about.  It helps in cinching your waistline in your clothing ware.
3.0,It does get tangled but overall cute for what it was worth.
3.0,Mask pulls tight across eyes and blocks vision.
3.0,It is much larger than expected. The design is pretty.  But I’ll get limited use due to the large size.
3.0,Very attractive but has a tendency to pinch or dig in at times.
3.0,Not quite working for what I wanted them to do. Wanted bangle bracelet but afraid charms will fall off
3.0,Beautiful dress just didn’t fit as expected. Runs small in the arms and shoulders.
3.0,Does what I want it to do for a particular outfit.
3.0,This was a very pretty chain but it broke soon as I put it on I was able to hook it back though. Also didn't fit around my waist but I can't blame them for that lol. Just wish it had loops for you to adjust the size
3.0,The bracelet is very pretty I would say the fitting is tighter and if you have a bigger wrist it may not fit
3.0,"This looked so cute online, but I ended up returning. I have a 42-43&#34; hip. Although I was able to put it on, and it fit my lower waist perfectly, I am not willing to battle with it at the pool. And, after trying this pull-on style, I realize that a side tie is much more practical for me than pulling anything on or off while in a bathing suit. Too risky for a wardrobe malfunction lol"
3.0,"Bought mom,  it is ok but I should have gotten her a much nicer watch after all she has done for me."
3.0,"nice but Hugh watch, doesn't feet kids ."
3.0,"Cool, but very heavy. I don't see myself wearing them because they are so heavy and I don't want to stretch out my ear"
3.0,"Super cute, love the tassel look. Was worried they would be bigger but they’re a good size. However they were both different sizes. One was quite a bit longer than the other. Just trimmed it with scissors.  Deducted stars for length difference."
3.0,It was great for the first couple of day until the third day when I pulled a lose thread and now there's a hole and I am to afraid to wear it if it tears more also it keeped everything in but it's long and bunched up.although there are cons the pro is it is made out of good material.
3.0,It works...it;s not phenomenal it serves it's function
3.0,it's a tee shirt
3.0,Soft material and fits true to a US toddler size.
3.0,I brought the Tan jeans and they were kind of baggy on me.<br />I recommend If you purchase to go a size down
3.0,"No matter what straps I shortened, the body of the entire bra was just too big (I'm a 44B and although the band size was ok, the rest of the bra was just huge, and because it's pretty solid material, it was like wearing soft, oversized mixing bowls. Definitely not a good fit for me. Pretty bra, though. You may have better luck, just know it might run large."
3.0,"Not for larger breasts over a C cup. Made my boob shape look strange and didn’t stay on very long. It kept sliding over as I moved. Maybe I just don’t know how to wear it correctly, who knows?"
3.0,This is a beautiful dress and is a good quality. However I have no idea how to wear it with a bra or basically not showing my breast because it is SO open in the front. Wish I could make it work. I had to return it though.
3.0,"Overall the shirt is nice. Nice color, style, fabric feel and fit. Just one issue that throws everything off is the weirdly placed pocket. It's waaaaay too close to the center of my chest. Not sure if this is something that i will want to wear out. ..??"
3.0,I love how there was two ways to wear this shirt.  Super flattering on my ladies. I am 403 and it fit a little snug. But not too tight. But I expected it to be a little bit snug. My ladies are huge from having a baby but I do recommend at his shirt!
3.0,The dress is very pretty but the sizes run small.
3.0,Weren’t scratch resistant.
3.0,I like how it's cute and dainty
3.0,I returned this product because of the fit.  I also realized that I'd prefer velcro tabs over buttons.
3.0,"I ordered 3-different 3X shirts, 2 Hanes, and 1 LeeHan Ton, and for the money, the quality seems fine, it’s just way to small. I have 2X shirts that’s fit better, and I tried to take a picture with the LeeHan laying on top of the Hanes of the same material to show the difference in size, but the picture didn’t turn out very well. Regardless I’m trying to lose weight, so I’m keeping it for motivation!"
3.0,Wife didn't like
3.0,"For q 4 xl , fits like a 2 xl"
3.0,I need a larger size. Reason I have a large frame. So normally my size is 2x-3x. This is my factual information. Thanks.
3.0,"I ordered these as a gift and expected the swirled rainbow earrings as pictured. Instead, received the .5"" Round Nylon posts in assorted colors GirlPROPS also sells. Did not bother returning the set after triple checking to make sure the mistake was not mine; after all, it's only $4.99 and the recipient loved those too. Decided to give some sort of review for this product I originally ordered just in case the incorrect fulfillment happens on a regular basis--that way, other customers are pointed in the direction of the .5"" Nylon earrings they should be expecting. [[ASIN:B003U9JRCA Set Of 18 .5"" Round Studs (9 Pairs), Nylon Posts In Assorted]]<br /><br />But still satisfied, nonetheless."
3.0,Great coat but side pockets could be more comfortably placed. You have to kind of cock your arms and drop your shoulders to get your hands in.
3.0,"These socks are so adorable; I loved them and wanted to purchase more. After several washes and dries, though, they have shrunk enough that it's difficult to put them on. If I buy again I guess I'll hang them up to dry."
3.0,"This band is very classy-looking, although it did remind me of the bracelet Joey gave Chandler (""a reject from the Mr. T collection""). It also felt very secure, like it would last a long time. But I won't find out because it's SO uncomfortable it actually gave me a cut on my wrist. And it pinched anytime it moved (I like to wear it a tad loose). I would never recommend it to anyone I actually liked just because of that. It's so unfortunate because of how good it looks, but alas, it was not meant to be."
3.0,Turned brown in pool
3.0,The dress is thin and sparsly made.  I bought 2 sizes up and still barely fits my breasts.  The dress doesnt have the flowy look or feel to it as the photos portray.  I was highly disappointed.
3.0,Product is advertised 15% spandex. It’s only ten. Does not provide support I was looking for. Due to lymphedema therapist said to get 15% so I ordered these. Very little support. Not what I expected.
3.0,So this was really cute for the two times I wore it and then all of the sudden I noticed a rip on the side. Which made me upset since this was such a cute top. And I have no idea how to sue. So just be warned its fragile.
3.0,"These sunglasses are OK, but not quite what I expected.  Don't think I would order again, but there wasn't anything specifically wrong with them."
3.0,"Bought this just for a costume.  So given the price, it did what it needed to do.  However, they are very thin, cheaply made, and therefore not a good choice if you want them for multiple uses."
3.0,These water shoes provide protection and stable footing. Unfortunately the fabric has frayed after one weekend at a water park. These will not last long.
3.0,"I bought two of these, one for each of my younger granddaughters.  They loved them; but when the five year old put the mask, on the elastic broke.  She was so disappointed."
3.0,The shoes are well made and are worth the price but run a half size small
3.0,It’s interesting trying to go to the bathroom with the rear having an opening.  Let me just say be prepared when you wear a long dress. The belly doesn’t support like it claims.
3.0,"These were ok, they kept coming off my kid......and we eventually just kept them off."
3.0,its ok for the price doent last long the zipper
3.0,Not really warm.
3.0,This was a super cute bathing suit cover. However after the third time wearing it the side ripped. I am very upset over t
3.0,"Love the colors BUTTT my box was missing the removal tool, there’s a place for it but it was missing. Now I have to TRY to contact customer care and hopefully they’ll send me 1."
3.0,I’m tall- 5’11”.<br /><br />It’s quite short. But comfy.
3.0,"Arrived as expected. Material was what I was hoping for with breathable fleece feel, yet lightweight enough for cool, foggy coastal rides. The extra large size isn't correct as these only reach my mid-fore arm. These are easy to pull off while riding."
3.0,A little bigger than I thought they would be. Well made.
3.0,Loved the look of these jeans but they run extremely small.
3.0,I had to take gorilla glue to keep stone in place. Kept falling out just randomly while wearing it. Still a pretty necklace
3.0,"Oh yes Americans… This is very very very small. It cinches in at the most unflattering point and gives you severe muffin top from nothing. The worst. Skirt is alright, but I'll probably have to gift it to a very skinny teenager."
3.0,I was frankly a little disappointed in this. I'm not convinced it's really NF.  The fabric is really thin. It is cute.
3.0,It was lovely for a while until the bottom fell off and the light no longer works. No worth the money I paid.
3.0,Such cute shoes but the ankle strap is complicated and very tight.
3.0,"The quality of this was pretty good, however the sizing was SO small, I ended up returning it. I ordered a medium based of the measurements.. (I had a breast augmentation recently so I don't know my exact bra size), but I wore a small in sports bras prior to surgery and thought a medium would fit... Nope. Definitely order a size bigger than what you normally wear. I would say I probably could of used an XL in this. I'm 5'9&#34;, 155 lbs, and if I had to guess my bra size I would say a 34D."
3.0,"Good set of earring, but they can look cheap.  Good for casual everyday wear.  Stems on earring are long and can be uncomfortable.  I like them all right. They look fashionable enough, but do not expect them to be high end jewelry."
3.0,Fit nice but very cheap material
3.0,"I really liked this, but I feel like the sizing was somewhat large.  I am a solid 8 in heels - always.  My foot slid forward and you could see a gap between the back of the shoe and my foot, which looked a little silly.  But the shoe is nice.  The heart part is plastic, but had it fit, it wouldn't have bothered me.  I ended up returning the shoe."
3.0,"I love the material.  These are really soft and fit great through the hip, thigh and leg.  But the waist cinches in way too tight to the point where they are too uncomfortable to wear.  I bought the same size in another style and they fit just fine in the waist so I think it's the maker.  I wear a size 12, almost 10 jean and I ordered size large in these."
3.0,made cheaply. A good pair if you were going somewhere where you may lose sunglasses.
3.0,"The leg warmers were soft and comfy, but can not get them to stay up. The tops keep falling down and gather at the ankles."
3.0,These are okay.  They are pretty but they are also kinda cheap.  But hey look at the price.  They do look very nice and are comfortable to wear.
3.0,Cute but not as sparkly as I thought it would be.
3.0,"Received luggage, however, was not expandable.  Kept any way.  Used on round trip from east coast to west coast and survived air plane cargo."
3.0,"Seems like a good watch, but does not have the one feature i ordered it for.  When you set a countdown time, like 3 minutes for instance, it counts down , rings, but then stops. It doesn't have an auto repeat."
3.0,"Nice looking watch.  A little small fit for my wrist right out of the box, but I can probably get a better fitting strap later.  Doesn't seem to hold a wind up for too long.  I notice that it could lose its wind up after maybe 8 to 10 hours and just stop.  The pendulum does pick up the slightest movements though to keep the watch going.  Even from just small movements.  So if you're wearing it all day and just doing normal things, you should be fine.  Just check on it once in a while through out the day and wind it up at night before you go to sleep."
3.0,"{ This Review is for; GUBERRY Womens Deep V Neck Long Sleeve Velvet Unique Cross Wrap Sexy Slim Fit Tops  Pink, Large }<br />I usually wear Small, or Medium. My bra size is 36C or 36D depend on brand.<br />This Pink color is like Rose gold, very beautiful color with slight sheen. Fabric is soft, stretchy, and light weight.<br />Before order, I looked sizing chart and read reviews, and decided ordering one size larger. But Bust and waist are just way too large for me. Bust measurement is bigger than size chart.<br />I wanted fitted style, so returned Large, and will get Medium."
3.0,"I like the shirt.  The only problem I encounter while wearing it is that it tends to slip off my neck because the opening is too long with no<br />buttons.  The neck line cannot be adjusted.  The fabric is good, however, and I do like the color.  I wear it anyway."
3.0,"I like the skirt; however, my belt was missing and I really need it..."
3.0,Clip is too stiff. I keep tearing money. Pockets are difficult to remove cards. Maybe I keep too many cards.
3.0,Standard costume cowboy hat. Runs very large and won’t stay in my head (& I’m not a small woman). This is a novelty that made for wearing once or twice and then discarding. It is well made for what it is. I can’t imagine that these are costly to manufacture so I think $20 is too much to pay for a novelty hat you’re going to wear once or twice and then throw away.
3.0,"All I wear is stainless steel because I tend to lose my jewelry often. These are a cute little pair but after a day or 2, I started developing an allergic reaction to them. I put on another pair after letting my ears heal and it was fine. I then put these back on and I got the reaction again. They're cute but I can't wear them anymore. So sad!"
3.0,I really want to like these but the fabric is kind of weird and hugs my love handles and I'm not a big person. It also leaves a weird panty line.
3.0,Fits okay.. definitely runs small. My 10 yr old is having some body issues and she asked for this outfit..it didn't help her as it runs small. She would like another one in a bigger size
3.0,"This shirt was something I was really looking forward to. As a tall (relatively slim) man with a longer torso, finding well fit t-shirt is difficult. While the fit of the shirt was fantastic, the construction and fabric were problematic. The fabric was ULTRA SOFT - sooo nice - but it was so thin, that my nips were practically poking through. Secondly, the construction of the sleeves was poor. I assume it has to do with the fabric choice, but it does not have a smooth seam where the sleeve meets the body of the shirt."
3.0,Received two difference sized socks in the single pair ordered.  One is two inches longer than the other.  Makes one question the quality control.  Use as bed socks for cold feet at night.
3.0,"I loved this top when I received it.  It is lovely.  I was disappointed it did not fit.  AT ALL!!  I ordered a xx-large.  It was so snug in the shoulders I knew it would not fit.  I am 5'3"".  I gave it to my friend who us 5'8"" and wears a size four.  It is still a bit snug on her.  Lovely top, but does not fit."
3.0,"This dress was a beutiful gown in itself, upon ordering it and it arriving (arrival day on time) The dress was a big larger, but not in certain areas but overall (which can be a good and a bad thing) The gown DOES look like the picture except for the top, there is more white on it that is the background of the beads, however the dress has stayed together and does not have things coming off of loose ends!! We really did enjoy this dress however, it is AGE APPROPRIATE which we loved for our five year old,I only rate it a 3 start due to the size charting but now we know to go smaller, the color is also very accurate its a perfect baby blue, not an off blue or darker it perfectly matches the picture, we are searching for another dress for her upcoming big birthday and we are considering ordering from this product again! also VERY GOOD ON PRICE, for a moment we thought it was a scam or a bad dress because how INEXPENSIVE it was, but when we received it the ONLY issue was the size, aside from that for the price and quality, AMAZING! we have another party coming up and might consider shopping here again!"
3.0,"The fit was perfect, nice sleek design, but I hit it against a counter while walking by and it busted. Not quite as durable as it appears."
3.0,"this is definitely NOT a one size fits all. Im 5'1 and usually wear a M/L in sweaters. It fits however, not like the photo. The back of my sweater rises, and shows off my lower back. Its a sexy look that I was not intending, but It worked"
3.0,My daughter loved it but it is really small and the clasp has opened up on it twice and she nearly lost the charm. I wouldn’t recommend this key chain
3.0,Nice design on this item.However one of my lens fail out after one wear.i might order another pair
3.0,"These shoes are ok. Wore out really fast, my daughter already has holes in the toe area."
3.0,Bought the royal blue sweater in medium. The color is beautiful and it fits great. I gave it 3 stars because the material is very thin. Not made for cold weather.
3.0,Look fine however very thin.
3.0,"So....the order process with these tops was very confusing. Pick a size and add to cart. When it's in the cart the title changes and it displays the wrong size. Totally unsure what size I was going to get. I did end up receiving the actual size I ordered and not what was in the title. I first ordered the 4XL because of the confusing title and it fit like a 2XL. I then returned and ordered the 2XL which fit like a L-XL. If you want it to fit like the model, more relaxed and loose, then I suggest ordering a size or two larger than you normally wear. Material is thin and clingy and the lighter color is slightly sheer. Top is poorly sewn and not very good quality. If you can find the right fit, it would probably work as a nice casual top."
3.0,The quality isn't all that good but ok for the price.
3.0,Makes my but look to flat 😂
3.0,It was bigger than large it was like extra large but it was beautiful I jus gave it to my sister  as a gift
3.0,The top fit fine.  The bottoms are too small.
3.0,"Nice pin, but the rubber backing piece doesn't hold properly.  I bought two of them, and both times the back came loose and the pin fell off my bag and disappeared."
3.0,"The shirts do Not appear to shrink, which is good, as most shirts from China go from XXL to toddler after a first wash. But, the neck opening is HUGE. I Think they make the cuts from the material and don't quite worry about accuracy, they just sew on the collar and send them out. I bought the 2 shirt package and the neck openings are big and Very different in size..  but, my expectations were low to begin with so..."
3.0,"Nice sandels but they run very small.  My son wears an 11, so we ordered a 12...too small.  Initiated a return and ordered a 13....too small!  We'll be returning both and looking for another manufacturer."
3.0,Got it for my 14 year old son . it's nice .not in English so have no clue what it says
3.0,"Very pretty wish the strings were thicker, feel too thin nd could come apart. No pockets on this one. Love the design!"
3.0,It's nice covers important areas lol . You can wear to dinner with heels or casual
3.0,The gold color turned brown.
3.0,I wear a D and this bra was not much support during my workouts. I wear it mostly when I go walking now.
3.0,I have other Judy Blue jeans and have always purchased the same size with no problem. These are not like that. Mercy
3.0,"Be warned, the nude color is actually pink."
3.0,"They're ok, just looks more like a star than a starfish."
3.0,I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT BIGGER BUT RUNS A LITTLE SMALL
3.0,"All damged, not wearable, had to throw away."
3.0,"It served its purpose, I wore it with an ugly Christmas sweater. It was a little too long though, And wife wrapped it around the stroller when we went walking a few times in the evening around Christmas. They stopped working after that. I guess it needs new batteries. I saw cheaper ones at walgreens, but I had already bought these"
3.0,zipper busted on 4th wearing.
3.0,"This ring was beautiful, but you can not wear it all the time as the silver coating wears off and it is a copper colored metal underneath.  Mine is still silver on the sides, but the edges against where the stones are is copper colored now and makes the ring look cheap.  I would have paid more to have this exact same ring in real sterling silver.  I love how they made it like a real rainbow with the colors moving from red to orange to blue to green to yellow.  Much nicer than some of the other rings out there with all the reds together, all the blues together, etc.  The price was right, but it wore too quickly for me."
3.0,"I love the color and pattern of this swim suit. The cut is very flattering, maybe a little too much. The cups are supportive but the strap around the neck is flimsy and I needed to replace it with something that wouldn’t slip off easily. I wear a 36F (DDD) bra and this covered nicely once I found a sturdy strap but definitely works better in the bedroom than in public for me. My little kids could pull it down too easily for comfort. If I had a private pool, I’d wear this all the time. Great coverage for the bottoms. The high waist helps smooth and flatter larger derrières."
3.0,"The material is light which is perfect for a workout shirt. The stitching somehow bunches the material at the seems just enough to be distracting. Good for lounging around the house on a hot day. Not terrible for the price, but I won't buy again."
3.0,"The shirts are perfect length and do not ride up **A + for that.<br />Little tight but it holds in your tummy and it is a comfy tight I am 5'6"" 190 pounds wear a size xl what I bought if you want looser go up a size. **A for that.<br />Material is comfy **A for that.<br />As many have written here the lace is not all sewn on and some is coming off. Better quality control should be hired to inspect. ** F- for this . Would I buy again. Unsure. I might try a different company just for the fact that I am not buying at a store that sells uhoh clothes."
3.0,I love PattyBoutik dresses but in this case the waist is a bit high. I've kept the dress hoping I can figure out a way to make it work. The colors are beautiful.
3.0,"The one I received does not look like the picture: there are many seams in on the front where the leather has been pieced together, and there is a lot of puckering. Mine does not have the Viosi logo on the front. Nevertheless it is serviceable and didn't cost much."
3.0,Dress material was thin and it fit a little weird at the waist. It was super wide and when it hit my thighs it was tight. The slits on the side where a little higher then the photo. In the end i return the dress...
3.0,"Great size (not too dainty), but very average quality."
3.0,"I loved the way this necklace looked in the product image. I did worry, though, that it would be cheaply made in reality, even though it didn’t look to be in the pictures. I have never found a turtle necklace that I have quite liked the quality of. This necklace, though, it just right.<br /><br />Upon opening, I first noticed the chain. It is thicker than I thought it would be. I do not like chains that are too dainty and this one, while slim, it solid and sturdy feeling. It is also shiny and to me, just the right size. The turtle is colored so beautifully and vibrantly. It is also slightly larger than I though it would be. I was imagining the size of a penny, but this is closer to the size of a nickel, but just slightly larger. The clasp on the chain is easy to use and there are many loop offerings at the end of the other side for multiple length adjustment possibilities.<br /><br />Overall, this is a solid necklace and very cute. It has exceeded my expectations in every way and I am very happy with it.<br /><br />Update: the same day I received this and reviewed it, I wore it all day. By the end of the day, the chain hadn't necessarily broken, but there was a gap in the circular connector that allowed the other side to slip away. This an be reattached and tightened, I suppose, but it would be easy to lose due to this issue. The turtle is still beautiful and if the chain does fail beyond repair, I could replace it, but it's just not ideal."
3.0,"Not great quality, the gems look and feel so plastic"
3.0,It was very cute and exactly what I was looking for but unfortunately it was not true to size. It was wayyy to big on me so I had to return. I thought about ordering a size smaller.
3.0,Dont wear longer than 5 hours or your neck will break out
3.0,"Did not look like picture, but did ship fast and was cheap so I got what I paid for I guess. Will not use again."
3.0,Fits tight in waist abut smaller than your normal size but the rest is long and full Flowy skirt.
3.0,Heavier material than expected and a little longer than I thought it would be but also my fault for not sending back so.
3.0,These are regular dry fit running or yoga tops. There is absolutely no compression or support to them. Very misleading as I purchased them for the compression. I’d otherwise rate it higher.
3.0,Dislike never wore you can see through it
3.0,"Bought a small but way to large, style was a little different and too bunched up for me to keep. Cute dress and great deal just not for me"
3.0,Cheap plastic construction in my opinion.
3.0,"Adorable dress but the arm holes were too large. Wanted to exchange for a small but they were out of stock, sadly."
3.0,These are great to have BUT the little cases they come in to hold them in your wallet have little hard nubs that scratch the lenses each time you pull them out and put them back.  If they change the little wallet holder to have a soft inside that does not scratch up the glasses I would give it 5 stars.
3.0,Not the nicest quality
3.0,"I love the style but I have big hips and when I wear it buttoned, I have to leave the last two buttons undone because its very snug on my hips."
3.0,I like the front of the necklace but hate the ribbon tie in the back (should be a chain or beads in the back).
3.0,Very pretty.. fabric was weird and fit was just kinda awkward honestly. Tried multiple times to wear to the pool but was just uncomfortable ended up wearing my cover up.
3.0,Fit too small and tight so I had to return :(<br />It was made of nice and thick material tho
3.0,"One of the rhinestones broke off  immediately, but otherwise good."
3.0,"They didn't look exactly like the photo. I gave them as a gift. Receiver was happy, but I wasn't. Also? The colors were faint, not bold. Bummer."
3.0,Good price for 3 pairs. Comes with a plastic case each. However one pair had dirt on it and another had smudges. They were easily cleaned off but still makes me wonder if the conditions were unsanitary.
3.0,It's a cute appearl piece if it would fit correctly. I ordered XL and that should have been a little loose on me but the bust fits too tightly for me to wear. The sizing for XL states it has a 41.73 inch bust. I am 39 inches and it's too tight. The lace is nice and a good quality. The fabric is chiffon and will not stretch.
3.0,"Just a warning: One Size Fits All in this case pretty much means you can fit all of your family in one belt. These things are absurdly large, but overall the quality is nice. It's a shame that these belts will likely need to be cut and tinkered with before they will actually fit properly - but that's what happens when you order clothing items online!"
3.0,"I really liked this wallet initially, but when I checked my pockets after removing my work uniform, I found that the inside of my pocket was stained red from the wallet. The color is beautiful, and I love the wide 'easy-to-remove -your-card' slots. If you use a bag, then this issue won't be much of a problem. Just remember to not put it in your pockets, or get it damp."
3.0,It fits weird around my neck and in my armpits...
3.0,Were way too tiny!
3.0,Nice button pearls but not uniform in size...one is a bit bigger than the other...
3.0,"Bought this for my mom to wear at the race track and she loved it. Fits well, colors are vibrant and the material has a nice stretch to it. Lightweight, so it was nice to wear during the hot San Diego summer"
3.0,"The shirt is very nice and well made, but after first wash, its skin tight like a rash guard. fits more like a m-m/l"
3.0,XL was too small and usually wear XL. Right and no room to fit
3.0,"This slipper missing Rubber Sole. The reason is, slipper is not consuming the weight of a person, but since the Sole is of Hard Plastic kind of material, the pressure of the body is reflected back to the individual's feet. The person cannot feel the Acupressure reflection, which massages feet. since it has a Solid Plastic kind of material Sole.<br />If you guys make this correction, the slipper becomes flexible, absorbs the weight of the individual and the person can actually feel acupressure feeling, and massages feet.<br />The top acupressure layer is fine, but it can work only if the sole is of Rubber, just like all other slippers made of rubber.<br />If you make this change, please send a Rubber version of this slipper.<br />This is not a criticism, it is merely a suggestion to make product better and meaningful to consumer."
3.0,Very painful after wearing for about 2hrs
3.0,This shirt fits true to size. It fits like a normal tee shirt would fit. I am 5ft 4 inches. It is a Cold Shoulder Tee Tunic. It can be worn with or without a belt around the waist to bring out the style of the shirt because it is a tunic.<br />The other reviews stated that it was tight around the neck. This was not true.  Mine fit just as shown in the photo.<br />I would recommend this item and it has a unique style.
3.0,These are very thin
3.0,Also see-through...
3.0,Not the best quality. Still works. Don't think I would buy another one.
3.0,Looks better in the picture than reality
3.0,Very tight fitting . Not for larger women. Color was nice.
3.0,"The fit was fine, but the color was not. Before I purchased it, I asked if it was a dark, brick red like it looks in the pic. The seller responded that it was. When it arrived, it was a bright red. Think Kool-aid... It does not match the dress for which I bought it.  I will probably never wear this. It is just too bright red. It’s hard to tell in the pic I took, but my dress is a dark, brick red and the shrug is not a match at all. The sleeves kind of bell out also."
3.0,Beautiful hat...worth the money
3.0,The Jacket looks great and came in a protective plastic shell. Although there was an odd odor for about a month that I could not get out with anything. It did seem to go away but still emerged if I got to hot while wearing the jacket. It was a little thinner leather than I was expecting but wears well. The color is way brighter than the picture leads you to believe but if you are a little crafty you can bring it down to a weathered look.
3.0,"The top was larger than expected.  Sleeves were shorter when compared to how you would expect.  There was no compression for the size I ordered even tho we sized it online.  Just order a size or two down and problem solved!  Sleeves may be a bit shorter tho.  Overall build and material was great!  I would recommend, just watch the sizing."
3.0,The teeth on the zipper wouldn’t stay connected. I have to pull it over my head if to take the jacket off if I zip the jacket all the way up...
3.0,Picture on model shows clearly adjustable straps but I didn't notice the later pics did not show them. The dress that came did not have adjustable straps. It hits higher on the chest and above my natural waist because I cannot adjust the strap length. It's still a fairly cute dress but would have been perfect if I could have fixed that one thing.
3.0,"love the color but it was bigger around than I really needed so the underwire doesn't fit as tight as I would like it to, I probably should ordered a large instead."
3.0,Thin bendy plastic. It's aight but cheaply made.
3.0,"When I first received the umbrella, I really liked it. When we finally got some significant rain with wind, I was able to use it. I noticed a little later, after the window to return had closed, that the seam along one edge was starting to tear. I'm not sure how much longer the umbrella will be useful. I think the manufacturer should redesign the seams along the edges to be reinforced for long lasting wear."
3.0,These are incredibly cute but pretty uncomfortable. It feels like I'm standing on concrete when I wear them. Not soft or cushioned at all.
3.0,I like that it's soft and seamless but the small size isn't small enough. I don't know why underwears tend to run on the large side and don't provide x-small sizes. I love that it feels like I'm not wearing anything BUT I get a wedgie wearing this because there's no support to keep that area stiff and prevent it from bunching up when you're going about your day and moving around...
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:2e341cd556648941529a7c1861ee2e2]] So, it's Sunday...<br />I'm getting ready for a date with my husband. I pulled the purse out and took the strap out, for the first time. The purse was fine but, the starp has dirt on it and the hardware is tarnished as if it's been worn out!<br />I am very unhappy.<br />Just find another purse... it's not worth the aggravation."
3.0,"Extremely cheap, thin material. Looks like a baggy wet sock on your head. Unfortunate…"
3.0,Didn't fit my Fossil watch like I thought it would. Return process was very easy.
3.0,"The earrings are beautiful, but the quality is average, and a little big for me, a little bit heavy.  Such a price and quality should be acceptable."
3.0,Not exactly as quality as I had hoped for. Definitely sized to fit small.
3.0,I recieved them and the elastic was stretched out.  I know they must of been last years stock.  Will have to take tepaired.hem to be r
3.0,"I have large feet, so they were too small.  I gave them to a yoga class member.  The yoga socks were big quality."
3.0,"These sandals look good, but using it for long is not as convenient as the base is too rigid for my little one and the straps might be too rough on her skin. The same thing had happened to me with other sandals of the same style, so maybe good for using them for short time."
3.0,Received the kimono and straight out of the bag it looked and felt great. Was able to roll with it that day and felt really snug. Despite using their sizing chart to make sure I got the one that was in my size range once I put it on I felt like the gi ran smaller than usual. After one wash the pant shrunk so much it made hard to move in them.Go one size up!
3.0,"I really like this skirt, it is beautiful and drapes wonderfully. BUT I ordered the blue skirt  and the gray skirt; the waist in the blue skirt is SIGNIFICANTLY smaller than the gray skirt. The sizes run SMALL in the waist, but fine for the rest of the skirt. I am losing weight so I’m hoping to be able to wear these comfortably in the near future. But if you want something you can wear comfortably NOW, I recommend ordering a size larger."
3.0,"Nice apron but when my daughter wore it for the 1st time, the patch fell off.  It was glued not stitched on."
3.0,It's a really cute dress. I had to stitch the fabric around the chest area because the material there is raw. No hem. I don't like that. That's the only reason why I didn't give it a 5
3.0,"Hard to tell in the picture, but I guess it goes to you get what you pay for. This looks nice in the photos, but in real life despite the knitting on the outside and the lining on the inside the air passes right through it. Inexpensive but also unimpressive performer."
3.0,They fit nicely but my daughter wore the toes out in a couple days
3.0,"The ring in the solicitation photo has more definition than the actual product, but ok for the cost."
3.0,"Looks and feels cheap.  Disappointed, but there was nothing wrong with the band other than the cheap look/feel.  Color looks plain not “deep and rich”.  Good watch band for a sub $100 watch.  Not a good band for a $1000 watch."
3.0,Cute but fits smaller than expected.
3.0,"these are thin and small through the hips and thighs.  Grant it, I am a &#34;women&#34; not a junior.  I typically wear a size 10 jean, a L fit like thermal underwear only thinner and with a boot cut. Not what I was looking for."
3.0,It’s not fit perfectly so I decided to adjust it myself but still doesn’t feel right. Maybe I’m too thin for this kind of bracelet :/ It keeps sliding down - the ring part ends up going out of the finger - quite frustrating how to make it stay ??!!
3.0,Not very stretchy and has some hanging threads but overall really pretty
3.0,They are good just got to be able to use with both eyes open
3.0,The shirt fit to size except is not nearly long enough to be a dress. Doesnt even cover my butt. But I am 5 10...
3.0,A little too small and cheap material
3.0,"Little  short would have liked for it to be a little  longer,  great material,  I would buy again"
3.0,The hat is beautiful but it seems to be a little too small for my head which I think is pretty small
3.0,"Glasses seem flimsey. Not really polarized. The lenses fall out, and the frames broke after about a month.<br />They say they are lifetime guaranteed, but try to find info on a return and you wont.<br />I wouldn't buy again!"
3.0,"I liked the bag but it was too small to hold my phone. If it won't hold my phone,it's worthless to me. Returning isn't an option so hopefully I can sell it. If you're looking for a tiny purse,it would be great. If your phone isn't miniature and you want to be able to put it in your purse,look elsewhere."
3.0,Product runs small. Order a size up. Quality is nice but thin.
3.0,I was looking for fingerless gloves that I could wear while typing.  These are soft and fit well but they are starting to pill after only two wearings.  Will leave these at home and continue to hunt.  I would not recommend these.
3.0,"This dress was great quality, stretchy and durable - as pretty as the picture. Had to give it a 3 star bc the ""dark grey"" I ordered was more of a light grey purple. Not like the pic at all and not very flattering."
3.0,"I can tell most of the reviewers have NEVER owned a true heavy duty rugby shirt - true heavy duty starts at 12 oz. such as Barbarians  and keeps going - Rowing Blazers has an actual 14 oz.  This rugby shirt barely passes as a 'rugby shirt'  - it is a CASUAL  RUGBY-STYLED shirt and that is it.  I was really disappointed in the WEIGHT of this shirt as it was VERY LIGHT IN WEIGHT, meaning WEIGHT rating of fabric - fabric is probably around the 6 oz. rating.  I was really hoping for the HEAVY DUTY, but alas, the shirt is ""not"".  Oh well, the search continues.  The Pros:  looks nice, comfortable  By the way, I am LARGE all day long, but ordered XL due to all the whining about sizing.  The XL feels comfortable even though I am Large - maybe after a wash or two it will shrink up ?  Bottom line:  XL doesn't feel overwhelmingly too big"
3.0,"Biggest complaint is size--I wear 13's because 12 1/2's usually aren't available. I bought the ones meant to fit size 13-14, and they are barely big enough.  Other than that I like them, the 3 tone color makes them easier to find"
3.0,Not as comfortable as other brands but you get what you get. Affordable option
3.0,I tried it on as soon as It came. I love the feel and fit but the colors didn’t match!!! The dress the model has on is more of a burnt orange on top and the real dress has a top the color of a carrot. Will order I a new color. I fit the large perfectly I am 5’8” 200lbs (and 4.5 months postpartum...it has room for me to loose baby weight and it still look good)
3.0,It fits perfect I love it but the letters already started peeling and I wore it once so I'm bummed about that because the not gona last me much longer
3.0,"Was cheaply made. I tried wearing it and not only did it look like poor quality, the edges if it are blunt & uncomfortable.  Save your money."
3.0,Looks just like the original.<br />Does not fit as precisely as the original
3.0,Cute dress but it is listed as knee length but it’s a mini. Returning.
3.0,"I'm 5'5&#34;, and I typically wear a medium (& sometimes a small if shopping retail).  I decided to keep the dress, but I found it be a bit large and long.  Without the belt it looks like an old lady's house dress.  Luckily the belt helps."
3.0,Very good but a lil to big
3.0,"This beach cover up was just ok.  It was not super flattering on.  Especially with my body waist size 8.  It was very busy and seemed to make my puffier areas even bigger.  I actually thought this cover up was cut kinda big.  There was lots of material and if I was smaller, there would have been way too much material.  Also, the material was thick.  Kind of like the material of a bathing suit.  This made the cover up very hot."
3.0,"I was excited to find these pants on the Today's Deal list.  They arrived quickly and fit as I expected. I'm 5'7'/150lbs, I ordered a size 10, perfect size and length.  But the very first day I wore them I noticed the outside seam on my left leg was open.  The pants are not tight so there wasn't pressure on the seam, they were just poorly constructed.  My husband suggested returning them, but I like the pants so I plan to have the seam repaired.  Originally I thought I would order the other colors, but now I'm not as likely to do that."
3.0,Ran a little small.
3.0,"Flimsy, shiny 90% polyester"
3.0,Is very cool but the black one looks alot more silverish
3.0,Very pretty & shiny. But post is very long.
3.0,Awesome glasses but they were NOT green. The lenses were a basic dark-grey and were not polarized. I do enjoy the DoSmart lenses and wish these would have been the same as the picture. I ended up returning them for a different version even though I knew they would not be polarized. The build quality is THAT good for cheap glasses.
3.0,"Cute gown,  nice fabric,  but somehow it seems shorter in the back.  Maybe it's he shape of my mother's body or her posture, but it barely covers her behind."
3.0,"Ordered gold, gor silver, very small, arrived veryyyy late"
3.0,I really like the way they look in person but trying to screw on the ball of the earing is impossible. It could be because I have long nails. I still think they are worth purchasing.
3.0,The size is medium if that works for you this is a great price.
3.0,"The sweatshirt is only 43 inches across the bust and the specifications stated it would be 48.8 inches. Otherwise the shirt looks to be as described.  The shirt does not feel like 30% cotton/70% polyester.  It Doesn’t have the texture of an average sweatshirt.  It has a heavy nylon type texture.  It’s nice, just not what I expected. Graphics are good and crisp."
3.0,"Glasses are fine and as expected.  Took nearly 3 weeks to get them which is pretty slow turnaround.  If you need them quickly, look elsewhere."
3.0,"Fits as expected, didn't love the skirt fabric or the way it hangs, but it will do."
3.0,"too short, they should be advertised for petite."
3.0,"Wrote to the sellers about my concerns.  Insert fits perfectly in my wallet and has 8 pages to hold credit cards, license, etc. lots of room.  However, the &#34;flap&#34; that goes into the wallet and holds it all in place is very poorly made.  It is thin, thin plastic and , although I bought three inserts, two are already ripped off completely making the inserts unusable!  That plastic flap must be a sturdy, solid piece and it is not."
3.0,"It worked great for the first few months. I use shirt stays a lot (military) and after 2-3 months, one of the clips wouldn't hold my shirt. I got a butter knife and played with the clip mechanism. Now it works fine but I am not sure how long it will stay. I would recommend this items if you only use shirt stays 1-2 times a month but for continuous use, I would look elsewhere unless you're willing to adjust it with a butter knife."
3.0,I expected these to be much thicker. It serves it's purpose but it gets soaked very fast while I'm running!
3.0,I never know if I'm a 24 or 25 in C/E jeans. I like them but this size was huge. Great color and beading.
3.0,"Shirt fits well, but &#34;hankerchief hemline&#34; makes a tail in the back, not to the side. Made of rayon which doesn't wash well and buttons are sewn down so neckline isn't adjustable."
3.0,Material is cheap-looking and really light.  Sleeves aren’t as long as in pic... almost a cap sleeve.  Get what you pay for I guess.
3.0,The two back clasps were attached backwards.
3.0,"slightly see through, same as the jiggly puff version"
3.0,"Good Hollbrook knockoff, with nice gloss finish. The lens are pretty dark, but I like it. Materials are plastic, so be careful. Only bad thing I have to say is that mine came with a small scratch out of the box! 3/5 good price and good cheap sunglasses"
3.0,"It's definitely warm. But if you wear RX glasses like I do, they will constantly fog up and you won't be able to see a thing. You can't wear sunglasses with it either, obviously. Not safe for me as I ride BMX in a city setting where the crosswalks are sketchy at best on a clear day at noon. Gave it to a family member with perfect eyesight though, they seem to be getting pretty good use out of it."
3.0,"Let me preface this. I love this stupid watch band. The issue is that sometime it just falls off and I worry of losing it. I have lost it before. I can’t put my arm out of the window when I drive Uber. If they could fix this issue this would easily be the best watch band of all time, but it is a very pressing issue."
3.0,Crap. Don't order
3.0,"comfy but they immediately developed holes.  They are still wearable since they are underwear, but disapointed in teh quality"
3.0,"I love the look of this bag. Pros, material is nice, straps are soft and stay on your shoulder, nice size (not too large). Cons, there's an inside zippered pocket down the middle of the bag that has to go. It's floppy and gets in the way. I could do without it. The cell phone pocket could be deeper. Holds only about half of my iPhone. It's a nice bag and the price is good, just wish the center pocket wasn't there."
3.0,"Its really cute on, its kinda short though!! It's like a silky material but definitely seems like it'd shrink a TON, so be careful. Definitely glad i bought it"
3.0,"On a slim girl, this would be fine. I do a lot of lunges and squats, therefore I have a booty. Booty makes this dress way too short for my taste. I even got this in a medium"
3.0,"I bought my husband's size first L for our baby shower, but it runs very small and tight on the waist, so I had to buy an XL"
3.0,"This Orchid Row “chiffon” kimono has a nice floral print on fabric that’s 100% polyester.  I don’t care for the feel of the fabric as it’s so synthetic feeling and not breathable or airy. While chiffon can be made from polyester (or silk), I think of chiffon as sheer and floaty but this polyester feels thick and heavy.  It just hangs on me and lacks any movement. It doesn’t fit like in the photo or have the same sheer, flowy quality that’s pictured IMO.<br /><br />This is a one size fits all garment, and I am tall at 5’11” so this kimono may fit me different than others.  The sleeves barely cover my elbows, and the length just covers my knees. The top looks boxy on me and isn’t particularly flattering, though it doesn’t look bad. This has slits on the sides that go to the top of my thighs. They should give the fabric more movement but they don’t.<br /><br />I’ve tried this kimono on many times over various outfits, such as a tank dress and over a tank with jeans or pants. But I’ve still never worn it. That’s a bad sign for me as I wear things right away if I like how they look and/or feel (unless I get them off season). At most, I could see wearing this at home as I think this looks like pajamas or a robe on me, yet the polyester fabric lacks the softness or comfort I want for hanging out at home. This is just okay. 3 stars."
3.0,"These are so cute, but compared to other nike shoes that my child wears, these run extremely narrow."
3.0,"Ordered a size bigger so it would fit on my index finger and did the exact same thing with a cheaper brand and the cheaper brand fits where I want it and this one does not. Sadly disappointed. Also, it does not spin nearly as easily as my cheaper one."
3.0,Tight!
3.0,"A nice color, and nice medium-weight cotton. The neckline is flattering. Runs very large."
3.0,Flower part of dresses color fades after a few washes. Beautiful dress other than that
3.0,Writing this review late. I think I got this sure at the end of the summer. I literally wore it two times and I want to put it on a few weeks ago and one of the strappy things across the front reserved. Very disappointed.
3.0,"These pants seem to fit the waist as one expects them to, but the length is way long unless one is 6'5&#34; or taller."
3.0,"I liked the look of the cuff, but it hurt my ear so I can’t wear it."
3.0,Super cute but I ordered three sizes up and the bra area is still small. My breast hang out the bottom I ordered an xxxl and I'm a DDD.
3.0,This shirt is cute and the fabric is nice but it's not exactly as pictured. The sleeves are just normal not rolled up. The neckline is really high and unflattering especially on a large bust. The front is just a paint gray tshirt with an unflattering neckline. Too bad because this t-shirt had a lot of potential.
3.0,I am 50 something and I've worn the same size bra for most of my adult life. These are NOT B cups. I really think they are C and labeled wrong.
3.0,"I do wear XL in shirts. T-shirts, regular shirts, etc. However, the XL in these ""TOP PRO Men's 3/4 Sleeve Casual Raglan Jersey Baseball Tee Shirt"" was way to large for me. Large enough that I didn't think a few trips through a HOT  a washer & dryer would shrink the shirts enough to make them usable for me.<br />ALSO...the neck on these TOP PRO t-shirts are what my wife says are ""Scoop Neck"", not regular crew neck, or whatever t-shirts usually are.  Fortunately, I purchased these on Amazon, so returning is easy. Now, back to the hunt..."
3.0,Fits great looks sexy but the only thing I don't like about it is the white underlining always slips out into view.
3.0,"I ordered a red band. Good color and construction. Seems like it will hold up. The product description said it was leather but I think only the liner of the band is leather. The band has a small basket weave design embossed on it. The band is a little shorter than another I ordered, which made me happy since I have skinny wrists."
3.0,"The dress is beautiful, but the fabric is too sheer or it was cut too small. The outline of the pockets was visible. Maybe if it were lined or a thicker fabric this would not have been the case. I bought the same dress in black, and it fit perfectly.  I love the style, and would buy it again if I could find the right fit."
3.0,Short necklace
3.0,"Cute bathing suit, but the bathing suit top is more like cones lol I didn't like the top but I loved the bottom so I'm keeping it."
3.0,Didn’t quite like it once I saw it look old school
3.0,The swim shirt was too big on me. The bottoms fit fine. The padding did not hit me right at all.  The print is cute and could be attractive if it fit correctly. I am petite and went with the size chart to fit me. Not sure if the small would have fit any better.
3.0,To big to wear
3.0,"Earring were too long, the back pin was too small."
3.0,Cute design (pineapple) but the fabric is weird and it arrived dirty. Like it had been worn and had a dirt spot on it. Not happy with this purchase.
3.0,I had to return it. It would not fit my watch
3.0,"Bought these for my 2 year old niece as she has a February birthday, however they look pink to me. Cute, but not super purple like I was hoping."
3.0,The style is cute but the material is not what I expected. It is like material used for leotards.<br />  Good for around the house.
3.0,I purchased a size Large and it was too small so I ordered an XLarge and it almost fit the same way. I ended up cutting slits in the legs to make it work
3.0,"Nice, soft material, but the sleeve came unsewn after the first wear : ("
3.0,It broke within 3 days. The stones are a very awkward size.
3.0,"The lace didn't lay very good, ended up having to cut it and redo it back onto the headband so it didn't gather as much."
3.0,"Fits true to size, however isn't made for girls with a bigger chest, because there is no support in the bra area. Over all great in comparison to the picture."
3.0,"It fits a little small, stuff in pockets that weight it down pulls on neck. The stitches of the material starts to come undone after washing. But over all not bad for the price."
3.0,"Overall finish and looks are awesome. Great looking helmet that looks much more expensive than it is. Packaging was good and shipped extremely fast! Fit.... Well I wear a large in icon, speed and strength, scorpion, hjc and LS2. I ordered a large expecting a snug fit but ouch! Very uncomfortable on the ears! I would say order a size larger than you normally wear. The lens does have a minor fish eye effect but not that bad. A CONSTANT wistle above 35mph is very annoying inside the helmet. However, its not a $500 shoei is it? It does have its glaws but for the price its a good deal in my opinion."
3.0,"1 out of 3 shirts in the package came with a snag in the fabric. The material is similar to a basketball jersey feel. I wish it was softer and I wish all three shirts came without issues. Other than all that, they fit fine."
3.0,"The yoga pants have a wide waistband and they are super soft and comfy however they didn’t offer me any tummy control. They are on the thiner side but not see through. I wore them around the house all day and they kept falling down and had to keep pulling them up, I would say they are house comfortable pants but not for yoga<br />I ordered my regular  size L and it fit good w out overstretching or showing anything unwanted"
3.0,Glasses are stylish.  I still get halos.
3.0,"This is not a bad wrap for sweat but I do boxing and other cardio which results in a lot of sweating. I find that I still have a lot of sweat pouring on my face; however, not as much because of the wrap. I decided to try a different brand to see which ones works better. I don't remember when I bought this but this week the thread started to fall apart. I wash it in the washer machine but hang dry. I think it is a product you should still try for yourself (regardless of reviews). Everyone perspires differently. Again, not a bad workout head wrap."
3.0,I love the colors of this suit but it just didn't fit my body right.  The top was too snug and rode up in the back and the bottoms were loose and a little saggy on me.  Just didn't work for me so I'll be sending back.  I think if you're smaller on top than on bottom it might work for you.
3.0,The shirt is a good 6-8 inches longer than pictured. It's more of a shirt-dress than a shirt.
3.0,Watch for the elastic band doesn’t fit as expected
3.0,"I ordered a medium because I have a long torso and a curvy bottom section lol. I am 5'7, 130 lbs, 32DD, but I would have gotten a small instead since the upper part doesn't fit very well. I sent it back. It was really cute it just didn't fit me well."
3.0,They are nice but don't stay up on your nose very well. Have to keep pulling them up
3.0,My daughter loves the way they look but hates how they fit
3.0,Returned the purse. It is okay but it looks prettier in pictures. Did not like the string on it. It is way too long and the purse is not that big.
3.0,"The Navy blue is not as dark as it looks online. It more of a dark royal blue. Love the fit and feel, but not the color I expected."
3.0,The fabric is thin and flimsy. I do like the black with tiny flowers but I would never purchase this product again based on the fabric being thin and 100% rayon. Have to wash by hand. Spaghetti straps look as if they may break at any moment.
3.0,"The top was very comfortable, but the shirt was a bit too big for me. It was also see through. It would be cute if worn with a swim suit other than that I recommend wearing a light tank top underneath. I am pretty petite so I order a small but it was still a bit loose. It has many flaws not sure it was worth the buy."
3.0,They were larger then expected but still very stylish
3.0,Not long enough in the leg for my sons's taste.
3.0,super thin and to big
3.0,"I'll start off with the fact I think they're a good value, but wow, I went through the entire gamut on these sunglasses. I read the other reviews before banging away at the keyboard and I do think my review is going to pretty consistent with a couple of the others. First, I really would like to give these four stars, but I can't. I think the lack of documentation is significant. When I opened the package, I saw the small plastic inserts and thought, oh wow... what the heck? I tried them on, hesitated for about 10 seconds and then said aloud ""there's no freakin' way...."" Either the inserts need to be removed or these glasses have to go back. I figured out that you just need to exert some force and rotate the bottom tabs out of their slot. The insert was removed without damaging it, or the glasses. I now see that someone mentioned on another seller's similar  item that the insert is meant for prescription lenses. The insert seems small, but I don't wear prescription glasses. Each lens would have to measure roughly 1.75"" x 1"". While a great idea, I don't think a customer should have to surf the web looking for this information. Trying to figure out how to change the lenses without experimenting would also be a major plus and it would be easy to show in instructions... if they were included. The only other thing I'd consider a bit suboptimal is that of the four lenses, three of them are considerably light tint and the highly reflective lens is pretty dark. So, I do think the extremes are covered, like bright sunny days on the slopes or water, or install the light lenses for days with complete cloud cover. I'll have to try them on a day of mixed sunshine/clouds and mixed terrain, like in and out of trees coverage.<br />So, with decent instructions I would have given these sunglasses 4 stars, because everything else about them seems to be pretty nice. The case is top notch. Eventually, you'll figure out that the lenses are very quick and easy to exchange. It's actually a nicely executed feature. While they're very lightweight, they do seem very flexible, meaning they should hold up fairly well to the abuse I'll eventually put them through. The frames do sit a bit far off the temple, so for folks that have a wide head, I think these glasses will work well, without feeling like your head is in a vise. For customers with heads thinner than average, I think these glasses might feel awkwardly large. I have an average sized melon and they feel just a bit wide. I haven't yet tried them with a full faced helmet, but when I do, I'll come back and update if there's a problem. I don't expect there will be. The glasses came with the nosepiece pretty bent out of shape, but it was easy to bend to a nice fit. They seem to stay on my head very well and I like the rubber grip toward the ends of the frames. They're comfortable.<br />So, either add a bit of information on the amazon item's description or send a little documentation and you've got a nice product!<br />If you missed or don't completely understand the ""Vine Voice"" tag on my review for this particular product, I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I typically only engage with products in which I have a bona fide interest and always attempt to share my opinion and experience as constructively, as possible."
3.0,Not what I expected.  A little tight.
3.0,"Very cute, love the size. But bend easily, honestly I'm sure they'll snap one of these days. Would not recommend for daily wear as they are loosing gold plate & turning green..."
3.0,"You can see the trim of the black underneath the white part of the shirt. The shape of the neckline is actually really nice. It hits at a good height to be modest enough for work but adds interest. It’s also very long when untucked, as you can see in my pictures. I tuck the front of my shirt in anyway so this isn’t a problem for me. The shirt is way too large in the armpit area I got a size small. My bust is 32” but even with a padded bra that easily adds 2”+ this shirt is still ill fitting in the armpit area. Usually a padded bra solves this but unfortunately this shirt is far too large. Overall, it’s a decent shirt but clearly they don’t offer sizes for smaller framed or busted women. The small is the size of a medium at least."
3.0,I bought these because I’ve been wanting all black bands for a while and everywhere I check there’s always a mix of colors. I don’t like that they have a logo on them; wish they were all black but they get the job done. Sometimes they feel a little tight but I just stretch them. I think they’d be best for like teen or pre-teen. I don’t recommend them if you have a big head lol but they seem durable... material doesn’t look cheap.
3.0,Ordered medium first time they were just right ordered medium second time they were to small but I love these gloves
3.0,"Sort of cute capris. Stretchy material. But, inexpensive looking. Material was a bit thin and didn't wash super well."
3.0,This tank top runs large.  I do like  it in general but not sure I would buy again
3.0,"Felt like it fit uncomfortably, and maybe it's just not broken in, but a bit stiff for leather."
3.0,"I'm losing weight so hopefully this will look better on me later down the road. But...I do like the cut and the flowyness. Not entirely happy with the cowl. It's kinda floppy, but then I didn't mess with it much. The material is very clingy (cups under the girls), but heavier than I thought it would be and isn't see through. So it's not that bad, but I wish I'd gotten a larger size so I could wear it now."
3.0,Material is not as breathable as I would have hoped.
3.0,NOT SOFT at all! Does not dry but light weight enough to not sweat to death. It stays put and is what I wanted but with it was softer and absorbent.
3.0,"It's pretty but it is very thin, see through, and poorly stitched. But that's what you get for only paying $10 for a dress. I order it on Nov. 25 and it came on Dec. 13. I order a size medium. It fit everywhere nice except around the boobs. Either the strings in the back need to be shorten or you need bigger boobs to fill it out and the dress is quite long and I'll be tripping over it. (Im 5ft 4in). Tbh don't waste your money. Save that $10 towards something else."
3.0,"comfy, but the glasses get foggy"
3.0,"I am so saddened by this ring.  It's way, way too small!  3 stars because it's an absolutely gorgeous piece, but not 5 because of the size!  I tried to put it in my Daith, but the straight part didn't even come close to going all the way through.  And I can't return it, so I guess I'm stuck with it unless I get my other ear done with a smaller piercing.  It would probably work well in a nose piercing, but definitely too small for my ear."
3.0,I dislike the earing was make out of paper and the bracelet doesn't stretch.
3.0,ORDER A SIZE LARGER. TOUGH TO PUT ON
3.0,All but one pair of earrings came as shown in the pictures. The hoops with the gold ball came as half a hoop and not a full one.. not sure if it’s intentional or broken but I bought the variety pack specifically for those full hooped earrings with ball and chain like in the pictures. So a little disappointed but happy with the others.
3.0,"It's okay, the material is soft and has a nice stretch to it but the material also feels somewhat cheap and it doesn't have a very expensive look to it at all. It fit a little funny but it was rue to size. If you are looking for something simple to do errands in, or for an informal get together by all means it is okay for that but it is no night on the town look. Delivery was very fast though."
3.0,Its super cute and comfortable but it does NOT glow in the dark.
3.0,"I had hoped for more. The back of the gloves seem waterproof, but the fingers are definitely not. Also, the touch screen fingers only work sporadically.  Haven’t figured out the magic to that.  They hardly work at all on my apple watch.  The grippy palm is nice- but definitely not all I hoped for."
3.0,The material feels nice but it came with a really light pattern around the edging next to the black piping and in the back down the middle. It looks like it was a stain. I washed it and it remained the same so it must be the pattern design. The hood is really small so it must just be decorative.<br />Overall it looks cute. Needs to be ironed though. The creases dont go away even after washing it.
3.0,"I bought this for hunting but I have yet to actually try it out in the woods yet so I'll do an update later but I would like to share my first impressions.  Watch the size you order.  I went off the measurements suggested & I'm at the bottom of the Large scale.  It says it's generously sized to fit over clothing but it would be tough to get it over much ""warm"" clothing.  It would be fine with a thin shirt but a sweatshirt would be pushing it.  I would have much rather gotten an XL.  I was going to send it back & get one but they were out of XL when it arrived so... :o(  The other concern I have is how much the face screen affects your vision.  It does filter out quite a bit & I'm worried that it will be hard to see well in low light at dusk.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I'm not downing the product.  I can't stand mosquitos landing all over me so if it stops that, I'm good. LOL<br /><br />On a plus note.... I was worried about the Insect Shield having an odor being it will be used for hunting but I can't smell anything on it & I have a hyper sensitive sense of smell.  I would have ordered on without the Insect Shield but the other sellers that had it, wanted way more for it so I took a chance.  No problem.<br /><br />Once again,,, I'll post an update when I get a chance to use it in the woods.<br /><br />......................... Update..........................................<br /><br />Okay, I've used it out in the woods and I'm not happy.  I can say that it did it's job however, I have two major issues with it.  First is the black face cover on the hood.  It's just a little too light restrictive.  It makes it pretty hard to see outside of the brightest conditions. :o(<br /><br />The main problem I have is how fragile it is.  I don't think I'll be able to use it again, after just one hunting trip.  We had to walk into the woods tracking a hog and it's COVERED in little round burrs!  Trying to pull the burrs off is destroying the fabric by pulling little threads out, making it look similar to runs in pantyhose.  I don't know if I'll be able to get them all out and it still be usable... The material is just like a flimsy mosquito net you'd buy at Wal-Mart.  For $35.00 I'd expect a little higher quality.<br />I should have put that $35. towards a Shannon Bug Tamer Plus jacket.  I have the pants and the only place any burrs stuck to those was on the drawstrings which were able to be pulled off easily.  Lesson learned... $35.00 later.<br /><br />If you're just going to be wearing these around the yard or camping (where there are no burrs), this might be fine... But don't try to use it for hunting."
3.0,"It's a nice material, workable from summer through winter. They run quite large though. I am 5'2, weigh about 160-167, am curvy with 38C, waist 31-33, hips 42-46 and usually wear a large or an XL, sometimes even a xxl in tops because I like things loose. After reading the reviews, I decided to go with the large. It was waaaay too big--almost to my knees in length, and just way beyond loose and cozy and moved into the tent ⛺️  category ."
3.0,Not US size large
3.0,Very thin satin material. Does its job as a play dress up magician cape.
3.0,"It’s really poor quality, but it helps me for what I need it."
3.0,Nice belt but runs small.
3.0,"Great size easy to take off, but the stone was not nearly as pretty as the picture, it was more of an almost blackish purple."
3.0,"They're cute , but the shades will bend out of shape if you're not careful."
3.0,Do not like the material at all. It feels like a sack !
3.0,Very soft cotton fabric but thinker.  Looks pretty but I want to return it.
3.0,I  like the style. The quality of the out side is good  but the inside is cheap .you get what you paid. No complain .The small pocket buckle felt off  after using half day.  have to  return.
3.0,"Cute shoes, but the back on the shoe rubs on the lower part of leg making them painful to wear. I've tried wearing with taller socks and still feels awkward. Disappointed that they aren't comfy."
3.0,"The shirt fits GREAT...however, the color is MUCH brighter than the photo shows. However, since the fit was great & the price was right I kept it."
3.0,Easier to use as Pajamas than for regular pants as it is very puffy
3.0,"Cheap looking hat at an affordable price. Out of the box, it looked a little weathered and flat. Otherwise a decent hat for the price"
3.0,Cute but not very sturdy.
3.0,"I am 5'4"" and 140 lbs... I ordered both a small and a medium.  Even the small was way too big and BOTH pairs were too  short.  (I like my pants to come down past the ankle and rest on top of my shoe, though.)  The material seemed nice enough and I liked how light they were but the fit were definitely not right for me."
3.0,"These boots were ok, but just not quite what I was looking for. They were uncomfortably hard on the bottom, and the style was a little too punk for me. I was going more for an industrial look, and these don't quite hit the mark. They weren't bad, just not what I was looking for. I returned them."
3.0,"More details below, but the short version is that this is a reasonable pocket watch- but despite other reviews, don't expect it to be nicer/look more expensive than what you paid (I paid about $20 for this, and you can tell it's a ~$20 watch).<br /><br />Purchased this pocket watch as a gift for a friend- each year we exchange clocks during the holidays, and I wanted to find something small that showed the mechanism clearly. I went through a ton of options and found this- reading the reviews it seemed like there were a lot of customers shocked by the quality and talking about how absolutely lovely the thing was.<br /><br />When it arrived it seemed... fine.<br />Pros-<br />Keeps fine time if you wind it appropriately<br />Not terribly loud, but you can tell it is there<br />Cute artsy clock hands<br />Shiny and clean with easily visible workings<br /><br />Cons<br />Chain feels light and a little cheap<br />Front watch face is some sort of plastic and is extremely loose- rotates freely in its socket<br />Cover is loose and wiggles on its hinge, even when closed<br />Metal body feels light and cheap<br /><br />Overall this is fine- If I was still in middle or high school wanting to be different, this would be a perfect, affordable item. When you get a touch older or if you're giving a gift, it seems more like a novelty or an impulse buy. Just be aware this isn't the steal of the century other reviewers make it out to be. It's fine, but it doesn't seem particularly high quality even at first glance. If you do decide to get it, do so just because you like it, not because people are saying it's some kind of deal."
3.0,It's just ok. Arrived frayed in 3 spots. It did fit and audio did work.
3.0,I bought this for my 8 year old daughter but I think it’s too big. I returned it.
3.0,beautiful bracelet ....I only gave it 3 stars because its a little tight.....its elastic.
3.0,"i got this as a gift for my mom and i it seems sturdy and is nice but i have two very small issue, unlike a real license plate this is flat sheet metal (which for the price makes sense, just not what i was expecting) also on the face side there is the company's logo in the print and while very small it does take away from the appearance. i will also add that despite my issue with these small things she loved it and is verry happy with it"
3.0,I love Giesswein slippers......but these didn’t have the insert that I’m used to in Giesswein slippers.  Still well made and they will get used.  Don’t buy these if you are looking for the sturdy ones that are the norm.
3.0,"Buyer beware, this shirt is not black, it’s grey. Not even close to black!"
3.0,Fits very awkward on ladies with small waist and bigger legs. Color was very pretty tho.
3.0,I really like the dress . The fabric is nice but sadly I got the dress cut with very few flowers.<br />It shows bold flowers mine has few.
3.0,"I went by the measurements and got the largest size possible. It was still too small, I couldn't zip it up past my chest. I am sad that I will have it return the product because it was nicely made."
3.0,Material sturdy and stays clean but handles have frayed and are detaching from bag. The fraying handles are unfortunate because this is a super cute and handy bag for work.
3.0,Functionality: 4<br />This passport wallet is a great size and has enough card slots for my use.  I like it because it's about the size of the passport so it can fit in your pockets.  The large bill pocket is nice and can fit a variety of currencies.<br /><br />Quality:  3<br />The stitching looks good and they seem like they can hold up to daily use.<br /><br />Material:  2<br />The leather isn't the greatest quality.  It's thin and the inside pockets looked like vinyl when initially seeing it.
3.0,Too thin no
3.0,It has very soft material and fits width nicely. But the length of it is pretty short. For a taller person I wouldn't recommend
3.0,Super cute just had to pin the middle otherwise a lot of boob would show. I’m a little taller so I get a camel toe
3.0,I'm 6ft 1 and I wish they were longer
3.0,I always wear XL. In this jacket in XL the sleeves are 2 inches short and the front buttons are 1 to 2 inches tight. I'm going to guess I would need an XXXL in this jacket and I've never worn anything like that! Wish it fit cause the jacket looks nice.
3.0,They are comfortable. However they come up really far on your waist.
3.0,Nice set. Too small for me.
3.0,Cute dress but a little long
3.0,"Phone case arrived the next day, yes... the next day! I absolutely love the bold colors and the way the case fits! However, the clip is another story. I find the clip almost impossible to use. You have to fight with it to get it to connect with the case. I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the clip. I would purchase this item again for the price they are at."
3.0,It's a bit tight compared to the size chart and it's a bit thin. I can see my tattoos through the shirt.
3.0,"Delivery on time, but the product wasn’t fit well, on the description of the product never mentioned the the model it’s narrow on the front .<br />Ty"
3.0,"Dress was decent, but way too big.  Usually get an XL to avoid a tight fit.  However, this dress was way too big.  I'll have to alter it a bit.  Used size chart too gauge but way off.  If I order again I'll size down to a large or medium.  Usually fit a size 12 comfortably."
3.0,"I ordered the white background color with pink and got a yellow background with blue foreground. For a medium size it is tight. I would advise strongly to look at the sizing charts.<br />The material is strong and durable, however, Ingot a sunburn while wearing it on an17 mile bike ride. The  sunburn is on my back where the shirt was covering. Pockets are good size. I put my phone, wheel tube and snacks. Works great."
3.0,Definitely overpriced. This is just big enough for a child.
3.0,"This dress is pretty, I kept it for a week or so and each time I tried it on I just wasn’t feeling it.  Could be my body type, I’m typically not a fan of off shoulder on myself and that along with a fuller figure (38/32/40-ish) It just made me look larger than I actually am.., so I returned it sadly. It’s beautiful dress!!! Has a liner underneath too.  I’m sure it would look great in many ladies."
3.0,"fit too tight, and run a lil small so make sure you get a size bigger what your child don't normally wear!"
3.0,Gold-1 is way more gold than the picture shows. But overall cute purse
3.0,I purchase pd this for international travel. Due to the weight I decided not to use this and gave it to my son.
3.0,"Button snaps. If these came button fly these would be great. These snaps pop and the zipper unleashes with a fury. Definitely don’t want go commando in these, liable to look like the prank spring loaded snake can.  Too bad. I may have a seamstress change these out. A bit small on size ordered.  Comfortable, nice pockets. Kinda shiny as well."
3.0,"Nice wallet, unless you want to hook it to something with the strap on the side. The ribbon pulled right out after having it on my keys for a couple of weeks. Fine otherwise, but I'm looking for a similar design with a durable strap."
3.0,These sunglasses clip ons have a light grayish tint and have a very fancy look! The only problem is that they look like more of a computer uv blocking sunglasses and not strong enough for the outdoors!
3.0,"This is a cute pair of earrings.  The length is nice and the colored ""stones"" look great paired with the silver toned metal.  The issue I had was tarnishing and construction.  On one of the earrings, the colored bits are off their mark.  They look like they were sloppily glued on.  The other earring is quite tarnished.  It turned my ear lobe black.  I won't be wearing them out and about, unfortunately."
3.0,The band is nice but the protective case didn’t fit at all
3.0,I bought these for our trip to Disney and Universal so we would be prepared in case of rain. Perfect for those slightly rainly days!
3.0,"I got this for a friend for Christmas. While he's not one to boast about how wonderful something is, he certainly seemed to appreciate it. I tried it on myself before wrapping it up (C'mon, you would too), and it's not a bad product. Certainly not as comfortable as I expected, but it's a good deal for such a jacket."
3.0,"Watch looks nice, but isn't great quality. Removing links from band is difficult because both links and securing pins are soft and easily damaged. The watch is self-winding, but self-wound &#34;charge&#34; only lasts ~3 hours, so you need to set the time every morning. My last self-wound watch would keep accurate time for more than 24 hours without wearing it."
3.0,Kinda disappointed with the appearance and looked cheaply made and would not buy it again. The other ones were great that I bought just not this one
3.0,Cosplay
3.0,A little tight on the temples but I do like them otherwise.
3.0,"They look great, lenses are polarized. Terrible quality. I took them boating and broke as I was opening them to put them on."
3.0,I loved the old model of this bra (the white one and old black one) and am very sad that they've seemed to discontinued the white completely and the black has changed the fit so much it barely feels like the same bra and doesn't fit at all. These were my go to before the change but I've now had to search for a new favorite style.
3.0,Kid sizesd.... to small for adult men
3.0,Not as fitted as it looks<br />Kind of loose in the waist area would require adjustment
3.0,"Cute design, love the colors.  I ordered a large but it fits more like an XL.  The shirt is made of very thin material and probably won't last long."
3.0,not to soft
3.0,"Fits nicely. I'm 5'3 and it's about two inches above my knees. However, the yellow color is quite see-though. I wore it for a costume but I probably won't wear it again because of that, the material seems cheap."
3.0,"Another insurance company rip-off I mean can we get someone to help, pick up, stop ignoring calls on hold & just drop! Poor customer service.. could have let money fly out of the car window.."
3.0,"Run very small, very thin material"
3.0,"I had some higher expectations, so it isn't everything I imagined. The dress itself is okay, but the material is less soft than what I assumed. The dress came a little rumbled and wrinkled within the packaging, and it sits on my form rather stiffly. It may just need a good few washes for it to fit comfortably.<br /><br />Overall not too bad, but if you need it for a specific upcoming event, I say try something else."
3.0,"I have similar coach shoes in brown and I know they run small so I got an 8.5 like my other shoes  (I normally wear an 8). The shoes were so uncomfortable bc my toes were hitting the front and top. I have narrow feet so the width is good for me,  but they definitely run narrow for a B width. Going to have to return them. So I can't speak to how comfortable they are to walk around in yet. They are cute though."
3.0,"Hi, question to manufacturer/seller. I got the child size for my 7 and 8 year old kids. They are very loose. In fact they fit me (woman) better. Is there a way I can adjust them to fit the kids? I am stuck with these masks if they don't fit the kids. Can these be exchanged? What are the dimensions of the baby size? Are dimensions posted for kids masks?<br />They look well made but wondering how to make them fit the kids. THnaks."
3.0,"I like them,  but you get what you pay for. They're not the highest quality, but they look great."
3.0,I wasn’t expecting it to be that red..-I thought more of a pink. I was also hoping it would be longer so it would cover my hips more. Otherwise it did fit good and I did end up liking the color. It is made well and of good material. Still can’t decided whether to return it because there doesn’t seem to be more available with the color I’m looking for in my size of medium
3.0,Not 50 inches long like the title suggests. But very good quality stole.
3.0,Not as fluffy as excepted and the bow is plain you have to clip the bow to it not good for little babies heads. And red is not very bright pretty dull
3.0,"The colors on the hat are artificial to the point of fairly ridiculous, and wont match anything red or blue you own."
3.0,Wish the charm was little bigger
3.0,"Size appears to be off. Ordered it larger than I wear as I like looser more comfortable clothing. Was tight..Kept it, due to shipping cost to send it back."
3.0,"This gets the job done and came quickly and at a great price, but it is part of a shower liner with shoe laces as strings."
3.0,"Beautiful colors, very happy with them. The bar is a little longer and thinner than I would like but over all very happy with them. And a great price for as many as you get.<br />Update: I had put 4 stars but now I've changed to 3 because after only wearing for a couple of weeks the paint has already came off the balls"
3.0,These are quality made but for sure they run small. I always wear a large men's glove. I could barely get my hand into the glove and the blood was cutting off in my fingers. I'm not sure they are warm enough either--however I can't wear them long enough to be sure.
3.0,Check Bison's sizing chart.  Amazon uses generic sizing charts.
3.0,"Note to Seller .... If you Did Not Sell the silver ring with this set and you would have five out of five stars for this item. My husband loves silicone rings, kind of obsessed. Although he loves his original wedding band, he is very active and loves not getting it caught on anything or rubbing his finger the wrong way while exercises. He rows once a week and lifts weights several times a week, so these are perfect for him. Unfortunately, the silver ring, when rubbed after awhile, looses its silver and begins to rub off. The gray and black rings are perfect.<br />This item brags of:<br />**** 3 DIFFERENT SILICONE RINGS FOR THE PRICE OF ONE: Get the best value with our high quality 3 silicone ring pack.

3.0,I only recieved 92 instead of 100. The quality is below my expectations.
3.0,I bought for my granddaughter she normally wears a womens medium to large. I bought the large and its too tight  torso is short and arm openings are small the dig into her arm pits and built in bra isnt long enough sits up on breast.
3.0,The picture is not that sharp
3.0,"I purchased these compression sleeves for my husband.  The blood pressure medicine he is on makes his skin very thin and easily damaged with the onset of UV rays.  First of all he loved them.  He is a bigger guy and they fit easily on him without rolling down.  He said they were cool  even when he was working out in 95 degree heat.  And they seemed to ward any sun damage and even protected his thin skin from cuts and scrapes.  However, after only wearing them twice he snagged one and it now has a hole in it.  I would say they are ideal for someone not doing a lot of physical work but I think I'm going to have to find a little thicker version for my husbands line of play and work."
3.0,"I really liked these pajamas overall I bought them for fall weather.  However after several washings the material thinned and fell apart, not even on the seams...I couldn't fix or patch- big disappointment!"
3.0,"This is not made really well.  The stitching is fine amd the fabric is ok but the zipper is monstrously large, like a zipper for a big duffel bag, and the size is way smaller than it should fit"
3.0,Not polarized despite product description and label--OR--I'm used to a certain level of polarization and this is hardly it. It beats having no sunglasses though.
3.0,This is a really cute dress. Ran a little small so I suggest ordering up a size.
3.0,"I really like the look and feel of the ankle bracelets, but the material does seem very cheap."
3.0,Very form fitted. Can see every nook and cranny.
3.0,"I normally wear a L in every shirt I own. I ordered a L in these. These fit somewhat in the arms and in the chest, however they are extremely short (even for a crop top style.) I can only wear them with very high waisted leggings. Probably wouldn’t purchase them again. Gave them a three star because they are soft and if someone wants a shirt that’s super short this would be fine."
3.0,Shoulders are way to big and the arms were too tight.
3.0,A gift for my granddaughter the school she goes to have an elephant for their mascot.
3.0,Cute and comfortable but broke within a month of receiving it (one day after the replacement window closed). It was good while it lasted.
3.0,"All of my boots are Size 6...however, I should of ordered 6.5....maybe even 7 if I had to wear heavy socks. Yes they fit...if I am sockless, which may be fine living in Texas. Too bad because they are actually super cute. I would consider buying other colors..."
3.0,I love the style of the swim suit. It was a touch smaller than I expected.
3.0,"Really cute, my only complaint is the card slots seem a tad small. It's hard to get my cards in and out of them. It can be done, just requires some effort."
3.0,The material was not what I expected and the top was way too large. I wear a medium in most clothes  and sometimes a small. I ordered a small and it was still too big
3.0,These are really thick and hard to breath through
3.0,the one is a little cartoonist for me but the 2ed one is really cute. fits well as expected
3.0,Tight and thin material. Very long. Can’t wear a bra and too thin to not wear a bra. Will be returning.
3.0,"The material is great, however the fit is a little off. My son is a 14 but the pants if worn at the right place are too short. If you allow the pants to be worn below the right spot then the vest appears too little. Pants need to be about an inch longer."
3.0,The clear bands fit most sizes but aren't very attractive. Not sure how long they might hold up to daily use but there are three pair per pack.
3.0,Color and fabric were beautiful but the neck opening behind the bow was very low
3.0,Not large breast friendly still cute
3.0,Zippers are cheezy. General quality typical of Chinese made merchandise.
3.0,I'm sure these would have been great if I could fit them. Even the largest size carried were too small.They are cut for someone with super narrow thighs.
3.0,make sure u work out if u want to buy
3.0,"This dress runs small.  Don't believe the other reviews. I had to return the dress after trying it on.  I wish it fit, because the quality of the dress is great and it's super beautiful in person."
3.0,Using size charts. The pants fit o.k. but the top is too small.  I'm nut sure how I feel about the fabric. The ankle slits are weird.
3.0,"The quality on this did not wow the person who it was purchased for. So it can’t be a five star, but it wasn’t that bad either just kind of OK."
3.0,"These glasses are so extremely gorgeous! However, when i tried them on they were uneven on my face. One side leans higher than the other and i'm not sure if its noticeable to others, but I noticed it the moment i put them on."
3.0,"The fabric is way to thin for the price of this dress. I was hoping for a warm winter dress, and this just isn't going to cut it. On a positive note, though, the fit of the dress is spot-on and is very flattering. I guess it will be a fall dress instead."
3.0,"Perfect, beautiful scarf, but the one that I received was a little damaged - string was pulled and distorted a small area of scarf."
3.0,It's not as big as it looks in the picture
3.0,Tight waistband
3.0,Super comfy and cute but no where near heavy enough. They are light weight. I could wear them on a fall evening but anything under 50 and I would freeze! They’re lighter than a normal sweatpants and aren’t fleece lined but just the back of the material is ‘fleece’.
3.0,Colour is not as vibrant as represented and it DOES run large. Comfortable though and is fit for the purpose for which I bought it - relaxing
3.0,"I'm tall (5'10"") and quite busty.  The elastic waist rode up under my busy and was very unflattering.<br />I decided to return it.<br /><br />The dress itself had a strong chemical smell when it came out of the package."
3.0,"The right side of the necklace (with the red, purple and green gems) is great, but the left side looks like crap. The color is clearly painted on and they don't really mesh with the right side. I'll probably paint over it with more complimentary colors, because it is a awesome design and it seems pretty heavy duty. My sister saw it and said it was &#34;ugly cute&#34;"
3.0,"Cute, and would probably fit if I was short and small chested."
3.0,"This would be SO cute and comfy without the horrible shoulders.  Pads can't be removed, which I read in other reviews but assumed I could finagle.  But even without them, the sleeves where they meet the shoulders are bizarrely shaped."
3.0,It did what it was suppose to but it is very cheap. It’s to be expected. It is worth what you pay for.
3.0,This dress was too small!  I had to return in and go up two sizes so it would fit.
3.0,They aren’t the same color.
3.0,"Cute dress, ran a little small and was definitely too tight in the hips."
3.0,"The claps on the left side do not stay on, they keep undoing. The right side works great. They fit a little bit big but feel good. If the claps work, I would have no complaints."
3.0,Oops. Reviewed wrong object
3.0,"Pretty, but runs small."
3.0,"I like the magnified look of this charm, however, it is tiny and gets lost on my bracelet.  It's too small for a Pandora bracelet that contains average size Pandora charms."
3.0,"Cheap polyester-ish material.  I have washed it and it has not shrunk, but I don't dare try putting it in the dryer!  Sleeves have stripes printed on the same polyester-type material and it runs just a little smaller than I expected.  While front and back are longer, the sides rise above my pant line and sleeves are just a titch short.  Overall I still like it-and get plenty of compliments-but was hoping for slightly higher quality."
3.0,not as warm as you think it will be
3.0,"SUMMARY: This fit very well. It was VERY Handsome. Itchy. Low-quality zipper.<br /><br />One major problem: zipper was so dang cheap and the cloth overlapped too far into the zipper ""lane"" that it got caught ALL the time. It was an epic chore to try and zip this up. I gave up trying to fumble with it after the first day. This was not a cheap cardigan but it wasn't expensive. For it's price, they can afford to spend one more dollar on a high quality zipper.<br /><br />The material is itchy, as well. I don't like itchy. From the pictures, I thought it would be smoother material like a knit sweater. It is VERY heavy, very high-quality material. But I can't handle the itchiness.<br /><br />Fit is spot-on. I'm a muscular dude with big arms, chest, and shoulders. I have to be careful what I purchase. This fit well. I'm sometimes an oaf and would like to dress better. This fit my style and looked great. Would have loved to wear this during the winter. Zipper and itchiness made this a deal breaker.<br /><br />Honestly, I would have dealt with the itchiness if the zipper was very high quality and the design around the zipper didn't cause the material to overlap into the zipper lane so frequently.<br /><br />I have your workout pants and shorts, COOFANDY. You have great products. This is a rare miss. Wanted to love it."
3.0,Glasses are fine. Smaller than I expected but for the price they are good. I would recommend to someone not looking to spend a lot of money but wants good sun glasses for sports.
3.0,"The cut is ideal for layering, hiding both stomach and hips. I wear a 42F bra and was worried it would fall open but it hangs nicely in front. But it clings to my back and sides even though I picked a larger size than I needed. It's just the material that makes it so clingy. It is quite thin. That also means you get zero warmth from wearing this, it is just to hide the bulges."
3.0,"Honestly the material of the dress was nice, the fit wasn't too bad (thought I'd suggest go down a size if you're in between sizes), however it just didn't fit the way it does in the picture. That wasn't a huge surprise, as the models are of impeccable shape, but still. I bought a medium, I am 5'6"" and 140."
3.0,"I did not get the blue clips thay were supposed to come with it. I only received the pink, black, and silver ones."
3.0,"Love the wallet, my iPhone 11 Pro in an otter box fits snug but perfectly in the front pocket. Also fits in the wallet portion as well so I like that. I would have given this 5 stars if I received the one I actually ordered. I ordered the Blue and instead for Gray"
3.0,Love the look and feel. The band has popped off the Apple Watch side a few times. Luckily I was just walking.
3.0,"The chocobo is actually white and the black bleeds through, it's not applied very well so it's not filled in very well. Lucky I'm fairly crafty so I have fabric paint I'll just touch it up when I have time... (Which I have very little of hence why I bought the hat instead of just making my own) it got here very fast but does have a slight smell."
3.0,Wore once and tassels fell right off<br />Other wise very nice
3.0,"Too short, very disappointed that one cannot find sweats that are long enough. It would be different if we were an Asian country where people are shorter but we’re Americans normally taller."
3.0,These handles were exactly what I needed for my Samsonite suitcases. They are sturdy but unfortunately the tabs holding down the handle are made of plastic. I don't know how long they will last. The Rubber handles seem strong but have a very strong rubber industrial smell... like going to a tire shop. And that smell stays on your hands till you wash them with soap. I guess you get what you pay for. These handles serve the purpose.
3.0,Material fine but runs small to size
3.0,"These glasses are cute but are not non glare at all, as I saw in a previous review picture they appeared  to have the green tint which I assumed was non glare. I don’t have that same green tint. Taking pictures with these on will be tricky...."
3.0,Just okay. Ended up sending it back
3.0,Shoes have an annoying click in the left shoe.
3.0,"SO CUTE! But WTF is up with their sizing? I'm a US size 2 or 4, (5'7&#34;, 125lbs), the smallest size is a 4/6 so I ordered that expecting a little wiggle room. Wow was I ever wrong, I could barely get it to zip, it was tight like a bra or a corset, and its not stretchy so its not a flattering tight, it makes your sides slpoosh out. The zipper also kept falling down. Returning and ordering a size 8 - 3 sizes up from my regular size!<br /><br />its amazingly cute and incredibly well made though! I was expecting something much cheaper. The lace is very think, I tried it on without a bra and you couldn't even tell! Pasties would be *plenty* under this."
3.0,Pretty dress but fits and looks like a bathrobe.
3.0,Bought a 2xl and it’s too small. Runs very small
3.0,expected more flare at the hip line
3.0,The dress is very nice but a little tighter than I would have wanted if I loosen the sleeves a little it will be much better.
3.0,"I ordered a small (5’4”, athletic, 132 lbs), and the bottoms fit perfect but the top was too large. Usually things fit me the opposite (soccer legs). Anything smaller wouldn’t have fit, and unfortunately you can’t adjust the top size. Super cute though!"
3.0,"cheap material, those shorts are more like Bermuda short( no for training)"
3.0,"Very nice for the price. The fabric of flowy and shiny (not satin thought). Order 2 sizes up! the waistband is VERY tight. Usually, I order a M, but after reading reviews got a L--if I'd gotten a M I wouldn't have been able to wear it! an XL would be more comfortable. A little see-through too."
3.0,"Despite being titanium, it's too heavy.  Also the subdial hands are too skinny and thus hard to read."
3.0,Super cute dress...if you have no sense of smell. The dress has the worst chemical smell I’ve ever experienced when buying a new clothing item. I’ve soaked it in vinegar and rewashed it now 4 times. Still smells just as strong. I guess I’ll try borax next? I’ve never had to do this for any clothing before. But I can’t wear it until the smell is gone as it gives me a headache.
3.0,Way too long and tight up top
3.0,"Clip tends to hurt my ear, but I love it just the same.<br />Debra"
3.0,Looks big. Clothing is itchy and not soft
3.0,"Runs small. There was no place to select a size, so I thought it would be a bit oversized, but it just fits. I'm 5'3', about 120lbs. If you're much bigger than that, don't bother. The color and style are nice, but the construction of this sweater is poor - loose threads, jagged unfinished seams, frayed edges where the binding is around the neck. There's NO WAY this is a cotton sweater. It's acrylic and it has a strong chemical smell. Definitely not one of my better purchases on Amazon. :-("
3.0,"The PajamaJeans fit larger in the legs than expected and tighter in the waist.  I was experiencing a new brand, and was a little disappointed that the legs weren't tighter.  Normally wear Riders.  I like the elastic waistband, but these don't stretch.  Length was fine.  Once I took out that stupid waist string and wore for a day, they seemed more comfortable, but still plan to try another brand next time.  Be interesting to see how they fit after washing.  I wash in cold and use PermaPress for dryer setting.  Will try taking out after wrinkles are gone and hang up to finish drying."
3.0,"Happy with quality of purse, although there was a black mark on the side.  Looked like a 1/4 inch line of permenant black marker.  Other than that - very happy."
3.0,Sizing was perfect but the top was completely see through ended up sending it back.
3.0,"This barbell is super cute! It's not too long for my ear and it's not too thick, and the feather piece looks a lot better in person than it does on the listing. However, the question-and-answer section on the Amazon page states that the barbell is internally threaded when it is actually externally threaded, which is not as good for your ears as it can cause tiny cuts in the piercing holes. I wish the listing had said this, or that they would change the design slightly to be easier on my piercings."
3.0,"I have the medium size in the med weight of this product and its huge and baggy all over. Where as the small is too small. Im 5.11 185lbs and I cant get one of these that fits right. This is a tad short in length and sleeve. I guess if your a small to normal size guy then this is fine. Maybe Im crazy, but this doesnt seem that warm to me. I wear it every day, under a fleece, inside all day at work at room temperature and Im not hot or sweaty. Maybe thats something wrong with me, but Id need this to be twice as thick to function as advertised in extreme conditions. Id probably get more out of just having a long sleeve T shirt and then a fleece over that than spending $80 on this top. Its a nice quality shirt, but IDK that Id buy it again. If they offered one with a slight V neck cut that would also be an improvement IMO."
3.0,"I wore this concert as a teacher for a school concert. The dress fit was fine, but for me the material was pretty thin. I kept having to adjust the skirt portion of the dress and for that I wouldn’t choose to get this dress again. For an event where there are a lot of eyes on you, it made me self conscious the entire time instead of allowing me to just be comfortable and not worry about my outfit. I would’ve loved this dress if it wasn’t as thin of a material."
3.0,Be very careful washing and drying. I followed instructions exactly and it shrunk so much it’s now a shirt instead of a dress.
3.0,"It's a flat belt, but not exactly what I was looking for."
3.0,TO SHORT IN THE TORSA
3.0,"The colors were beautiful, but it ran a little small.  And it was for my teenage daughter.  Plus, it was flimsier than I expected.  But it worked for our occasion."
3.0,"Its cute, but i was a little disappointed that the chain was chincy looking. Kind of on the expensive side"
3.0,Purchased as a gag gift - got the large that looks more like a small. Funny but definitely would fit small.
3.0,a feather fell off and it would go up too high on my back
3.0,Easy to adjust size. Seems secure. Only problem is that the band and the cover are very different colors. Wish they matched better.
3.0,"This dress is super cute. Unfortunately, it's very tight in the waistline and kind of see through"
3.0,"It's cute! However, it's completely see-through. I'm going to buy a white or cream slip dress to wear underneath, but for now, it's only a beach coverup."
3.0,I needed a fairly small gym bag that could fit easily into the fairly small lockers at the gym. I spent a lot of time looking for just the right bag. This one's OK. It's the right size for my stuff and it squashes easily to fit in the locker. I wish it had a zipper pocket on the outside (the pocket is completely open). The construction is good and I liked the color. It will do.
3.0,"I ordered these because they were made in America section , first thing I see is a sticker from China on the lens.🤷‍♀️"
3.0,"I have arthritis in my thumbs and it makes it hard to put on pants that are tight, I thought the extenders would help, I was wrong.  I bought rubber and fabric extenders.  The rubber ones don't stretch at all and the  button hole on all extenders are to small to put a button through due to my bad thumbs"
3.0,"I bought a medium. I weigh 116 pounds. I wanted comfortable shorts. The waist is too tight. I can wear them, but I don't like them."
3.0,"I really didnt know what to expect when I ordered this bag since the price is so low. I wasnt sure if it was going to be too small for me. I like to use my purse as a diaper bag/purse. This is a great size. I can fit diapers, wipes, sippy cups, change of clothes, wallet, bottle of water, phone, and all the other random little things I typically carry in a purse. I like that the little strap fits over my shoulder perfectly. The only thing I am not crazy about is the gold accents. I wish they were silver. I think it makes the bag look cheap. I love that my cell phone fits in the back zip pocket and my keys fit in the front zip pocket. I couldn't decide between a few of the colors but I settled on the Burgundy one. Overall, I do think this bag looks cheap, but it's cute."
3.0,"Bought for early pregnancy outfit. I'm medium/ large. Just found it made me look frumpy. Cute for petite girls, but found I ended up feeling more confident in more form fitting outfits as my belly grew. Also, it wrinkles so bad! Can't cram in closet and have to take out of the dryer the second it is done!"
3.0,"These gloves may be good for women, but they aren't good for men, especially if the man has large hands!"
3.0,"The necklace is shorter than I imagined. It is beautiful, but I have to tie the straight piece in a knot to avoid having the necklace fall off"
3.0,Love them but need to need HAND washed
3.0,Quality was nice but they were too small for my 8 year old.
3.0,Not flattering at all. Ordered and X-small and it’s still too large.  The top is loose around the clasp.  The bottoms are poochy in the stomach area and looks really odd like it should be the butt part.  It’s just unflattering all around.  Really was hoping for the best.
3.0,Very cute!! Everything fit great except the shirt was huge for a 12-18 month. I had to wash it several times to try and shrink it down. The skirt fit great!
3.0,Nice earring but quite large for me. i failed to read the size and had to return. Overall very pretty and good price
3.0,Wife thinks it's a little large up top but I think it looks great 👍
3.0,The stick is thin but i love them
3.0,Does what it's supposed to
3.0,Well it flowery! The sleeves were tIgHt!!!! Gave it to someone in need.
3.0,Material is like a polyester material and is very large for size.
3.0,"I love this top but the one problem, with it is, it's tight around the arms. I have large, muscular upper arms and it's tight. The rest of the top fits perfect."
3.0,"Shirt is more like a football jersey material than it is tshirt type material. Much more clingy, shiny and tight than I expected from the reviews. I returned it for a refund. Looked like maybe it might have been cute for someone if you're looking for something shiny, clingy and like football jersey material."
3.0,"The quality wasn’t quite what I expected although for the price, perhaps it was. Cute design and works for this intended purpose. Took much longer to ship to me than I liked."
3.0,"The color of the pants is very far from what is advertised, the picture shows a dark Royal purple, what I received is a light plum. Along with that the are quite short, I'm 6' and they barely reach my ankles.  However the shipping was fast, overall not very impresses....."
3.0,Very tight on my feet and calfs. Cut off my circulation and were not very comfortable.
3.0,"I gave this a &#34;3&#34; because I love the idea of the ease of nursing and the fabric, but it ran a little small I think. I have not sent it back yet, but I am going to soon!"
3.0,"I’m 5’6. 36C, 28 waist. I ordered a medium. First off, it’s not cropped as said in listing. It goes past my hips! It’s oversized everywhere but the arms and the actual hood. I was hoping to wear this to the gym but it’s too long. The material is low quality. I doubt I’ll wear this any other place but home."
3.0,I love the look but not all that comfortable for lots of walking.
3.0,"Nice to look at, but the get wet really fast. I knew they were not waterproof, but not this wet this fast. They are for ""dress"", not for being practical. Comfortable and a nice color. I will wear them, but not for warmth of wiping snow off car."
3.0,It’s not  khaki color at all! It’s more of a yellow/flesh color not at all the color I wanted otherwise it’s great
3.0,"Loved the color and the material,but it is too small."
3.0,"I get that there is an obesity epidemic, but this is insane. My toddler has so much extra room in the stomach with this"
3.0,Cute. Super small & tight on the nostril. I like that. They did start to turn my nose green under thoee. Other than that they’re alright. You get what you pay for.
3.0,I love the feel of it but I got a large and it’s big on me should have gone with the medium
3.0,"Cute hat did what it needed to do, could be bigger but whatever.  Hat didn't come in a box but wit a firm plastic insert to keep the hats shape. Arrived on time and no wrinkles like others say. Price is right."
3.0,"These maternity leggings are super confortable. Two reasons why I only gave them a 3 star rating. 1) The first time I wore them, I got a run straight down the middle of where it goes over the belly. This happened at some point while I was wearing them. 2) They don't fully go over the belly causing you to keep pulling them up, and probably the reason why I got a run in the first place. I still wear them with long maternity shirts or dresses because like I mentioned before, they are super comfy."
3.0,I loved this outfit but the ribbon trim on the tutu was ripped before she even wore it so I had to return. It didn't look like the ribbon was securely sewed to the the tulle.
3.0,This is an cute infinity scarf. It has a nice knitted pattern but I think it actually looked a bit better in the photos. The description says &#34;acrylic&#34; (my bad) but in the pictures it looks more like soft cotton to me. A little disappointed but it's ok.
3.0,"I really didn't know the earrings were so small. I wanted a bigger pair. However, they were pretty. I kept them and gave them to my sister"
3.0,"It gathers too much in the front and looks weird due to the way it hangs. I have this in another brand and it is my favorite workout top, but this one isn’t as flattering."
3.0,"The saying goes you get what you pay for....and it's true with this item.  It's very cheap feeling and smaller than anticipated.  I ordered it going by another review on here that said it was a larger, messenger type bag and IT IS NOT.  It's a small crossbody type purse.  People commented that it broke very quickly and I can see why.  I love my Boston's so I'll use this purse, was just disappointed once it arrived."
3.0,I won't buy again
3.0,Wouldn't buy again but arrived quickly
3.0,Bought as a gift. Recipient asked me to exchange them. They were really pretty but heavy and large.
3.0,They are nothing like the photo.  They are smaller and look like something you can buy at Wal-Mart for $3.99.  I'll wear them but wish they had been wider like the photo.
3.0,"For the price, these are great! I purchased these as gifts to include as a little something extra in gift bags for Christmas. They loved them."
3.0,PLEASE READ all the reviews.  When they say the fit is small they MEAN it.  Do not rely on the size chart.  That is the reason I gave it three stars otherwise the Sweater looks great and appears warm.
3.0,"Sleek and pretty, but I’ve seemed to already lost a stone but all and all I like it"
3.0,Doesn’t stay together long.
3.0,Huge!!  Way too long! I’m 5’3”<br />Back they go!!
3.0,The top fit okay but the bottoms have a loose material that sags a bit
3.0,"Thin material that sheds, ran small, sleeves too short. Needed something thicker, less messy."
3.0,I absolutely love the design…but why no bigger band available for the 44mm :( hopefully they fix that soon
3.0,"The fit is great and I love the fabric, but the pockets both had holes in them when my dress first arrived, so make sure you check them before putting anything important in them. I managed to fix the pocket seams easily though."
3.0,"It's a cute shirt, reminds me of the 80s, but the material is .... weird, it's silky but cotton like... inside feels more like a softer terry cloth...  Thought it would be more like t-shirt or even soft sweatshirt material....  Fit is a bit off too, sleeves are a bit on the short side, and def needs a tank or something under it.<br />It was not what I was expecting, although I always have low hopes for some of these shirts and they look amazing on the skinny model, but not so good on people with any kind of a body or weight."
3.0,"Cut big, very long legs and mock draw string three things I hate"
3.0,"The fit on this dress runs small. Go one size up from your normal size or go by the measurements on the dress. They are accurate. The material is very lightweight and needs a slip. It WILL need ironing when you get it.The quality was what I would expect for the price- not spectacular. I wore it as a bridesmaid dress. They were looking for something cheap and causal. The sides of the skirt are longer then the front and back- hankerchief hem. On a positive note, the hem flutters a bit as you walk! It is cute with a cardigan over it."
3.0,"The hat looks cool, but the fabric is floppy and thin."
3.0,Very pretty but clasp isn't very secure one falls off if I'm not careful.
3.0,"The top was way too big and the bottoms were too small. One of the strings was damaged and unattached when I got it out of the packaging. Very cute suit, just not the right fit for me."
3.0,"I am 5'4&#34;/140 lbs. and ordered the small.  It is so long that it can't even be worn with heels!  I will get it hemmed at an additional cost.  Also, the material is somewhat strange like a tablecloth or curtain, not normal clothing material.  On the plus side, the colors and pattern is quite nice.  I ordered the navy blue with flowers."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:8853c00b7241499964781585f4755369]] Update after 1 month of wearing. Already have two holes that are both expanding. I use the pants a lot but in the end, I think these are made with cheap material.<br /><br />These pants are awesome. I can never find stuff like this shopping in retail stores. The pockets along the mid-upper leg portion are cool and the zipper is great.<br />The only small drawback is that they are slightly too long. I’m 5’6, 180 lbs and I ordered the small. The waist is perfect but the length is 2 to 3 inches too long. No big deal because the pants are great."
3.0,I could have used a smaller size I thought my head was average enough for a one size but this was hard to keep on!!
3.0,See through in light colors.
3.0,"Great idea, but the printing on the shirt could have been in higher quality."
3.0,Nice looking shoe - just way too wide  I wear a A or B width Shoe and the last pair of Yellow Box shoes I bought very similar to this style fit perfectly.  Very disappointed that these were so wide.
3.0,Not quite what I expected but it will do.
3.0,"It was cute, but I washed it once a dried it flat and it still shrank up a bit. :("
3.0,"I loved the material, but I definitely suggest sizing down!!"
3.0,"I really wanted to love them, all of them. I do love two or three of them. Although it's advertised they come in assorted colors, which i liked, they also come in assorted sizes. Unless my hair is in a bun, i doubt the others will fit."
3.0,The black is even see through.
3.0,It was worth what I paid although somewhat small fit.
3.0,One bat short.
3.0,Looks construction gloves.  Are so hard. Not for biking
3.0,"Definitely a mixed bag on this. After one wearing by my 9YO, my feedback:<br />The Good:<br />* The seal on them is much better than their previous goggles<br />* The mirrored finish on the front of the lenses looks awesome<br />The Bad:<br />* The pictures provided are so misleading as to almost constitute false advertising<br />* The &#34;red/white&#34; goggles I ordered were not red with white straps as shown. The body is ARGUABLY red, but the straps and gaskets are undeniably PINK. This is not an enormous deal for me as these will go to my daughter instead of my son now, but it is absolutely not what the product is described as.<br />* The hard case shown is not provided. As noted in other reviews, the goggles arrive in a mesh bag, with nose clips and ear plugs."
3.0,Waist rolls down otherwise length is perfect
3.0,The stone is not as shown in the picture unfortunately.  It looks much clearer than the one I received.  The one I got was totally saturated colors and hence did not look much like a crystal.  Probably my own fault for not knowing what the crystal they were selling may actually look like.  Will not be returning it as it is too much trouble but it would be nice if they put a picture closer to what it actually looks like since mine wasn't even close at all.
3.0,soft and comfy.  one leg is longer than the other and some seems are already coming loose.  I'm 5'5&#34; and usually a small-medium or size six and the S/M fits me fine.
3.0,"As is. I wished the gray part was a bit longer as the picture shows it hitting her mid-thigh but mine only came to like my waist. I am a petite woman (4&#34;11, 120 pounds) Feel is nice."
3.0,"Because of the way the opening is made, this cardigan sits oddly.  I won't purchase this name brand again."
3.0,"The color, and shape were perfect. I was able to wear this shirt once. The straps in the front were like a rubber band covered in string. My first wear one of the straps detached from the shirt<br />I washed the shirt and the front straps were completely damaged, the white rubber band was coming out."
3.0,Fix your hair AFTER you put this on—and you'll be fine. The neck is a little tight. But it's comfortable once you get it over your head.
3.0,"In the picture it looks like the socks cover most of your foot. But when you put them on, they don't.<br />However, I will make it happen."
3.0,"Love the feel and they are not at all see thru which is great, BUT I am CONSTANTLY having to pull them up. There is not enough elastic in the waistband to keep them up."
3.0,"Nice looking glasses.  Fit as expected.  Only problem is there is some residual plastic film on the edges of the lens.  It doesn’t affect me when I wear it, but annoys me as when I see it, it looks cheap and of poor quality control."
3.0,"Bought for my adult son, it fights very snug. We were hoping it was looser around the neck."
3.0,"These suited my purpose, using for scavenger hunt prizes at a kids birthday.  Very hard to set time and some didn't work, but kids liked them ok and were excited to get."
3.0,I purchased the dress for my daughter to wear to a wedding reception and she wasn’t very crazy about the material of the dress. The dress looked pretty on but she felt it didn’t look as expensive in person as it did online. But I’m sure with the right jewelry and shoes it will be a great and really a great reasonable find.  I paid the few extra dollars for faster shipping and it came a day earlier which was great. I’m so happy that the dress was double package because it was storming and water made it inside the package but the dress was inside another sealed package thank goodness. But there were no packing slip enclosed at all. I think that should be enclosed and I didn’t get a notification of the delivery.
3.0,Bag holds a lot and is great for this person who has to shlepp a ton of stuff around Gotham.  One of the wheels came off almost exactly a year after I bought it however. This is the picture 2 days before the entire wheel came off
3.0,Not a perfect blazer but good for small occasions. I feel this is higher on price. Fits as expected. The fabric feels like cheap.
3.0,I did not like the feel of the material.  It did feel cheap. I did return it.
3.0,It's not a dress. It's more like a shirt. Too short.
3.0,I thought the fabric was heavier. It fits above the knee and i am 5' 5.
3.0,The attachments broke off
3.0,"The necklaces broke after two uses. A few of them still work so I’m not going to return them, but if you get these just be wary of that."
3.0,Larger than expected but inexpensive so won’t return!!
3.0,"These are cute Christmas charms for nails. The Tweezer is super helpful, too. I was disappointed that it only comes with one of each charm, I expected more and I think the cost is a bit high for a total of 24 charms."
3.0,LOOKS DIFFERENT FROM PHOTO
3.0,"Size ran small, and not long enough."
3.0,It is an ok skirt.  I usually wear a medium  size 10 and when others stated to size up I tried to get a large but they were sold out so I decided to take a chance with the XL.  It did fit and was comfortable but was a tad to loose. I'm 5'8 150 pounds. It was really narrow at the bottom just as others had said but so much that I couldn't walk so I decided to keep it.  The camel color wasn't too bad but for the price I can't complain.
3.0,Great color and style but needed to go up a whole size. I wear a 9 and this was a size too small.
3.0,Nothing great.
3.0,I’m returning
3.0,Clip a little hard to open
3.0,Did not fit properly so I had to return
3.0,In the picture it looks  a lot better than what I received -- but in general terms it was as described
3.0,"I ordered this in size large 1st, fit everywhere except it was tight on my breast. Ordered an XL & it got almost the same as the Large. Otherwise I's really cute. Im 5'2"", 180lbs, curvy & 36C breast."
3.0,Had a smell to it.
3.0,I thought I caught myself when ordering the red hair that they were child sized. However these are also pretty small and uncomfortable to wear. Also the lenses are transparent. May be great for an Elton John costume!
3.0,Ya avía tenido una igual pero está viene mas corta
3.0,"First of all the glasses they are very nice, but I give it 3 stars because: Jamas that is green and second are very pequellas, if you have the big face these glasses no officers to cover you total eye ie eyebrows remain outside ."
3.0,Fits pretty small
3.0,"The color is pretty, and I'm happy with the fit. The fabric is thin and cotton; consequently, it's just ok."
3.0,This product is ordinary quality
3.0,"I bought these aqua socks to wear in Croatia. In Croatia there are more rocky beaches than sandy beaches and it is not uncommon to happen across sea urchins. I bought these socks to keep my feet protected. They were good enough to walk across rocks if they weren't too pointy, but I suspect they would do almost nothing if I would've stepped on an urchin. They were also much bigger than what I expected. I think I would've preferred something tighter with a slightly thicker sole."
3.0,"They are pretty sunglasses, but the quality of the material doesn’t match with the price."
3.0,Cute but the watch did not work when we received the item.
3.0,"The bouquet that I ordered wasn't the one I received in the picture. Rather, it was all black expect white tips on the roses. If you are looking for one that is exactly like the one in the picture, I'd advise for you to look elsewhere. But if you're like me & manage to think that anything will suffice, then this is for you.<br /><br />( if any would like to see the bouqet, then let me know )"
3.0,the clips are not strong enough and are sliding off the cardigan
3.0,"I love, love they style and the colors. Purchased a similar pair from the same seller. They are however very heavy for studs. The little plastic back can barely hold them in place. I will have to get some extra backs for them, the metal kind and see, if they will hold them better.<br />They did arrive in a nicely cushioned card board box.<br />I received this item at a discounted price for an honest and unbiased review."
3.0,"This is cute! I thought it was a little thicker in material to keep warm , but it not.  I still wear it sometimes."
3.0,"My son wears these as slippers, and they work well for that. They are a bit too flimsy to wear outdoors as boots."
3.0,"Pretty cheap, but what can you expect for $10.00?"
3.0,Haven’t even worn one whole fall/winter/spring season and already Lester has torn on the left wrist area when pulling on the glove - Very disappointing!
3.0,Ok suit for price $18.00 but  The bra side wire popped out after I wore it one time.  The plastic wire now  jabs me below arm pit .
3.0,"They are beautiful though. The thing about Tech Gloves is that if they don't fit snug, they don't work."
3.0,"These were ordered to match my 4 daughters for a baby and a wedding shower on the same day. Dresses arrived late, Ordered July 25. I ordered 5 dresses. Originally only received 4. A day before the event I needed them for. Several days after the event I received the last dress. The seller was not helpful at all while trying to find out about the fifth dress. Just kept saying it shipped.  Told me to check with neighbors, family, and post office. Never explained it was being shipped separate. Now I want to return them because I no longer need them and I am afraid I am out a lot of money.<br />Dresses themselves are ok. The dresses where thin, simple but pretty. I was having an impossible time finding matching dresses. I needed an adult xl, adult medium, toddler 5-6, and 2 6-9 month.  For sizing I wear a xl or size 18 their xxl fit me fine.  The two 6-9 month where completely different sizes though!! As you can see from the photos I shared.<br /> If ordering give yourself 1-2 months before the event you want them for. Had I received my shower invitations earlier  and ordered these much earlier I would have been ok. My shower invitation arrived 3 weeks before the shower. I needed more time than that to work with this seller."
3.0,These were more of an orangey color rather than a deep red. They came with a nice hard case tho
3.0,I agree with other reviews that the strap is too loose.  Every once in a while they feel as if they are going to slip off my feet.
3.0,Fabric is awful but it’s super cute and well worth the money in my opinion
3.0,"These tanks are super cute, and I love the light weight material. Colors are also very bright. I purchased the BK/Bl/PNK. I was very tempted to keep them. However, I really need tanks with some ""shape"" control. These tanks have no compression at all. I even purchased a smaller size.<br /><br />If you are looking for a nice silky feeling tank... You will not go wrong with these."
3.0,"I love the look of these. This is my second time buying them because in my first pair one of them broke. I figured it was a fluke and bought another pair...and once again one of them broke. They also do not stay screwed together and randomly just fall apart. As much as I want to buy another pair, I will not be wasting more money on  them."
3.0,"I had great hopes for these sunglasses. They looked good, seemed to be of decent quality. But there's two issues that caused me to return these sunglasses.<br />1) This might just be specific to me. They seemed to fit weird. Every time I put them on one side shifted up slightly. Maybe I have one ear higher than the other, but I don't get this problem with other sunglasses.<br />2)  Also, when wearing them it gave me a slight disorienting feeling like the lens were refracting the light differently and this is the main reason why I returned it.<br />3) A minor issue that might actually be a plus to some people. They don't block much light. Any time I was facing in the general direction of the sun I had to really squint. Perhaps this detail was in the description or in some of the reviews, but just beware that it only mildly blocks the sun. I could have lived with this because in some situations I only want to block the sun a little.<br /><br />Something else to consider, there are different models for this listing so maybe it's just this particular one."
3.0,"This feels stiff and wrinkles easily like cheap bed sheets. It's comfortable because it fits a little on the big size.  But, the material is not soft.  I think it's over priced at $30. Feels more like $15 worth."
3.0,"When I tried to reorder the Pambras that I purchased last summer, this is what I received.  They are not as wide as the Pambras.  When I get dressed, I still go to the older ones first.  I wanted a larger supply so I wouldn't have to do the laundry as often (& have enough for vacation), but I will probably still try to keep the older ones washed.  They seem to work better than the new brand.  I wish I could sill find the other brand."
3.0,I thought the pumkins were bigger.
3.0,"Loved the design but the button thing seemed to rip on me? I've had it for roughly over 2 months but even after a week or two, I had issues when i came to opening without it ripping."
3.0,"I bought this hoodie for me to wear on stream, and I did, for 4 streams in a row. On the 4th stream I accidentally spilled some soda on it, so I figured I should put it in my laundry since I needed to do my laundry anyways. Well, I put it in the wash with the rest of my sweaters/hoodies, and when it was done and I pulled it out, the metal pieces where the hoodie string are came off, the zipper ripped off, and it looked like a total mess. Out of the 6 hoodies/sweaters I washed, with some being lighter, some heavier, it was the ONLY one to be ruined. The hoodie string even came out of the holes and was at the bottom of my washer. I extremely loved the look and feel (the cotton on the inside was SO COMFY) of this hoodie, but I don't know if I should buy another $50-$60 twitch hoodie if it's just gonna go to pieces after a single wash again."
3.0,To large on arms
3.0,Cheaply made for the price
3.0,"I have now  had to replace / order 3 of these rings in about a months time because they are incredibly fragile. I really loved the look of the ring. I ordered the first one and it unfortunately broke quickly after getting it. It didn't take much to break it so when I re ordered it I even ordered a 3rd thinking that should last me for awhile.<br />However, I am disappointed that the 2 replacments  that I ordered both broke very easily and quickly and that one of them even came with a crack already in it.<br />For the first 2 days I would have given the ring 5/5 rating cause the color and feel of the ring is fabulous, but.... just so flippin fragile. Very annoying. So, a 3 is what you get.<br />To sum up, if you buy the ring, just be very very careful."
3.0,"Good looking band. Really sets the watch off. The bad thing is, least bit tension and the band will come loose from the watch"
3.0,A  little  small  ??? You get what you pay for
3.0,"Pretty low quality, but it was inexpensive.  Very small.  Looks pretty good on."
3.0,The picture looks a whole lot better than the real watch. The numbers are hard to read as they are not white like the picture shows. Its small and very light. This watch does not fit my style.
3.0,Looking for something a little  different.
3.0,Great material super soft but the Waist was too big felt too loose... had to return
3.0,"The earrings are pretty and I wanted to like them. However, I noticed that one of the earrings was a 1/2&#34; longer than the other one. I contacted the seller through Amazon and the seller was very accommodating."
3.0,The shirt it just ok. She side slits go so high that you either need a tank underneath or high wasted pants. Kind of uncomfortable and awkward
3.0,Nice style shorts military looking but definitely too tight on the legs unless you have skinny legs do not purchase
3.0,"I really liked the style and color of this dress; however, I had to return due to small sizing."
3.0,"This is a beautiful dress, but make sure you have a flat tummy, this dress accentuate everything, good and bad."
3.0,They are ok for the price but very thin frame
3.0,It's ok. Am having trouble finding that perfect eyeglass case that is durable an long lasting. I've tried so many in the past several years. The most they last before falling apart is one to two months. I'm about ready to give up. Don't believe one exists.
3.0,Order a larger size
3.0,It is smaller than I thought.
3.0,This is for sure not true to size fits very small super cute but fits very small
3.0,I got a size up just to be on the safe side and it was so super short. I’m 5’9” for reference. Maybe this will work for shorter gals. Too bad bc it was really cute.
3.0,Clip broke after only a couple months of use.
3.0,Pretty and cute. Comes off your head at night<br />The fit is loose
3.0,Fit was expected for a kid in size 8-10 clothes. It feels like cheaper thin polyester. Not the nicer dry wick/active wear fabric. It meets my needs for a costume though.
3.0,"I bought this top for a gypsy Halloween costume and it will be perfect! However...the material is like paper...feels like a costume...very hot! I was hoping for a lighter material. It fits good, most things I order are usually small so I always get XL. I maybe could have gotten a large but no time now. I won't wear out or on a date...the material is too scratchy and hard."
3.0,arent heavy enough. of course get brass.
3.0,Fun watch for the price. It's a piece of costume jewelry. Leaves a green ring on your arm if you wear it to long. Fun for nights out or parties. Not really a good everyday watch.
3.0,Didn't take long for one to break. .. and they are thinner than I thought they would be but they are still cute and not so expensive so I don't regret it lol
3.0,The hat is super comfortable but the peace sign has a white background in the interior section of it. The picture shown is very deceptive and is not what I received.
3.0,Fit good but not cushioned
3.0,It's very pretty but ran small in the bust. Had to send it back. 😞
3.0,Arrived quickly. They are larger than they appear in the photo. The lenses are way to big on my face and I won't be wearing them. Bummed.
3.0,I purchased these for my adult disabled son. Expected these to be a little more material
3.0,Thick material but sizing was off… runs small
3.0,"I had a hard time with the hooks they kept coming undone for me. Just when I would get a couple hooked, & moved on they would come undone.  I'm 63yrs of age & size 46G. I sent it back because of that reason but otherwise it was a nice bra. I wasn't that fond of the material but it's OK."
3.0,This dress fits perfectly except slightly longer but with some heels it's fine. The quality is decent and is exactly as pictured. Did not receive the free gift that was supposed to come with it.
3.0,Fell apart as soon as I used it!  Looked great though
3.0,"Pants are too short.  I thought I was ordering tall, but they aren't.  Otherwise they would be fine, nice jeans.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Company contacted me and offered to refund money in full.  In process."
3.0,"However, I ordered my name and got ""Sophia"".  What a pity.  I cannot wear it, but it's super cute and reminds me of Carrie Bradshaw in the series Sex in the City.  I always wanted a name necklace but alas I still don't have one.<br /><br />With that said and having received free product for a review I will say this would be a fun gift for a tween or even a bridesmaid's small gift at under $10.<br /><br />Don't forget you can use Amazon Smile when you shop to donate to your favorite charity!

3.0,"For the price ok, but the material is super thin.  I guess I should have expected that."
3.0,They were a little bit large around the waist but they were way too long.  I ordered the &#34;short&#34; length and will have to cut them off in order to hem them at the proper length.  It would be very nice if we women could order by length like men order their jeans.
3.0,Not so pretty in person. Don’t like how it adjusts.
3.0,I didn’t like it because it fit entirely too tight. I ordered a medium and I weigh 130 and I’m 5’7 definitely was for a shorter woman at around 120 just in their medium. I think it was constructed for a woman not in the US.
3.0,I love the fit but didn't notice additional warmth under gloves.How do I know they're truly silk anyway?
3.0,"These are too big but that’s my fault as ordered a bigger size thinking they’d shrink. The material is heavy & warm but they just don’t fit my body very well. Drawstrings are way too short.., can’t tie like a shoelace."
3.0,Was too large for my son.. but he still enjoys it..
3.0,This exact watch is at Wal-mart for $15 suckers!! The two outter buttons dont do anything. But i really only like the way it looks.
3.0,"A little tight around the stomach, as the length doesn't tuck deep into mid-waist slacks. I know my size, so this was just a tad disappointing but it still looks great with a vest on ;) the material is comfortable and holds up well when cared for properly. Definitely prone to heavy wrinkles - make sure to hang these up as soon as you take them out of the dryer."
3.0,I love the fit and style of these! They do seem to add a strange prism or halo to my vision.
3.0,"Definitely a cheap sweatshirt, but worth the price."
3.0,Larger then I expected
3.0,I am returning these sandals today because they did not meet my expectations.  These may be acceptable for someone with less support needs.  They are of average width which did not work for my wider foot and do not have much arch support.  Also the straps are narrow and do not feel secure.  Not as supportive as my previous Pro Wellbeing Orthotic flip flops.  Disappointed.
3.0,I’m 5’11 and a 36DD. I ordered an XL it was just too short!
3.0,"The grapichs I would rate it a 5, ad far as quality, hmmm... I thought the the thickness. Would have been better however I just added a 2nd. One and it kinda. Worked out okay."
3.0,"Good material, dress was a bit short on the sleeves and also length. My kid size is a little under average.  Overall it was a hit"
3.0,too smal
3.0,DIDN'T REALIZE THEY ARE FOR PIERCED EARS.
3.0,nice scarf but the  shade of orange is quite different from the picture it's a lot brighter 😟
3.0,Felt the hood was  heavy and very stiff so not comfortable.
3.0,"i read the reviews and ordered a size up.  My mistake, its too big unfortunately wore them outside so can't return them."
3.0,"The picture shows on Amazon it looks larger, it looks nice too. It was a little disappoint after I received. Finely, I decided return back."
3.0,The padding in the top slides around.  It has nice padding otherwise.  The bottoms snagged easily.  Most likely only good for one season.
3.0,too tight to the neck for my taste I may alter it.
3.0,... do not filter sun as well as I expected.
3.0,"I’m 5’0 120 pounds and this dress fit me a little loose overall. The length is pretty long since i’m so short, might be perfect length for somebody a little taller. Also has butterfly sleeves which i’m not a huge fan of. Looked a little cuter with belt around the waist but dress was still too loose."
3.0,"I got this dress for my work holiday party, and it was okay. The arms are VERY tight, I nearly couldn't get them pulled up far enough despite ordering a 2XL when most of my shirts and dresses are size L and a few are size XL. The chest is also tight (I'm a 36DDD), so the ribbon at the waist was pulled right up under my boobs instead of being around my actual waist. My dress also had numerous threads hanging off (they were easily clipped off though) and a small tear at the top of the waist ribbon (luckily not noticeable since it was tucked tightly under my boobs). Also, just so you know, every single type of bra except a strapless will show under the lace, even a perfect nude strap, which doesn't help the well-endowed out any. Overall, it was good for a single wear to the party, and because it was cheap I'm not too surprised by the quality or sizing issues, but if I'd had time to order something different for the party I would've returned this."
3.0,"Purchased this for my wife. The color was not as expected - looked bright white in the photo; however, it was more of a cream color - but she still plans to wear it."
3.0,I did not expect the fabric to be as stiff as it is and the crotch or the rise is short for size 42 with a elastic waist man. Hopefully after I wash a few times they will soften up.
3.0,My daughter purchased this fascinator to wear to an afternoon tea. She picked orange to blend with an autumn dress.  There was nothing in the description telling that the fascinator is attached to a 3/4-inch black fabric covered headband. Reading  after-the-fact we did see that from some reviewers. There is nothing wrong with a black headband with fascinator attached but my over 30 (inserted for clarity as to why she didn't want to wear a decorated headband to a tea) daughter has blonde hair and the headband stood out. I was able to carefully remove the headband and cut off the area where the fabric was glued onto the back of fascinator. I then attached an alligator clip to the bottom of the fascinator with a few stitches wrapped around the base of the clip in two places. Now the fascinator can be clipped onto the side of the head and appear to magically balance without distracting from the design or the color. I would not buy another as there are other manufacturers who do not use the headband attachment.  If headband must be used it would be so much nicer if it were clear or a neutral color. I feel the headband cheapens the look.
3.0,I wanted to love this  but the first thing my husband said was that it looked like a cardigan his grandma would wear. Unfortunately after that I couldn’t unsee it. Unfortunately had to return
3.0,Comfortable however the zippers do NOT stay up. Threw one away already
3.0,I bought my grandson a size 8 they were more like a size 6.
3.0,"Not happy w/the fit & not happy I have to wear my camisole w/a bra built in.  My bras that I normally wear, the straps are too wide.  That's why I had to purchase the camisole (bought a light beige & a white one).  But I do have to say this too is very lovely."
3.0,"Would be better for my husband if these came in an XL as he has a large head! Also, I didn't pay close attention to the fact that this is not 100% cotton :(<br /><br />They are well made. Shipping was quick."
3.0,I wont complain about how long it took because I know it came from China but I didnt really like the fact that its not exactly like the one in the picture. I was really hoping for the three layer chains intead it only came with two the one with the little circle and the long one with the little rectangle. Disappointed.
3.0,Material is pretty but it runs small. I ordered an XL in the Wine color. Probably needed a 3XL to get that real flowy feel. Front panels for some reason are really narrow and the back of it fits tight....probably can still wear it but just not as expected. Will not be ordering again.
3.0,"Really pretty but, they do look a little on the cheap side. However, this is only when your are looking really closely. Even still, I would've given a higher rating except that mine came with a missing stone."
3.0,I bought this for my daughter and the sleeves are tight. Runs small.<br />The color is pretty but it is orange not pink like the picture shows.
3.0,can't figure out how to wear it!
3.0,"1.1mm was the thickest available in 18"".  It is way too thin to support a 5-gram pendant."
3.0,I bought these for my daughter and they weren’t bad for the price!! The only thing I’d say is that they are see through. I wish I would have known this because it would have definitely affected my decision to buy these. They are really thin and see through so you’ll have to wear a shirt long enough to cover your bottom.
3.0,Great quality prescription pad. Very functional and stylish. A bit overpriced though
3.0,Is a nice boots however I was walking and be stand up fishing for more than 5 hours and gimme a blister on my pinky toe :(
3.0,What the heck happened to all the good reviews?????? I bought this because the user ratings were good and i like bags like this. Bag is good quality for price. I don’t like fancy bags. Big issue i have is the silly side ties that fell off and make the bag a whole new shape. I don’t really recommend.
3.0,"Probably should have looked more at the length for this strap so it's mostly my own fault for not doing enough research, but I have a pretty small wrist and this strap is only able to buckle on the very last opening and it still feels a little tight.  As a result it's now in the box in my closet and I've gone back to my sport strap from Apple.  Beware if you've got any wrist that's not super tiny.  Construction is just ok.  It does look better in the pics than real life."
3.0,I thought it would be long like in the picture (coming to my knee length) but it actually stop right under my butt. overall its ok and im still going to wear it
3.0,Way cute but only fits as a shirt.  Too small.
3.0,Loosely knit. If you have any modesty you need to wear something beneath it. Super big neck. I do like the fitted wrists and waist.
3.0,"The material is pretty flimsy but it looks good. Definitely hand was and air dry only. Be gentle when putting your arms through the sleeves and I recommend putting rings on after you put it on. Its made of yarn but it's super cute. As long as you take precautions with it, it should last."
3.0,Felt more like a nightgown than a dress
3.0,Always add one size bigger.  Plus it is thin not great but looks nice.
3.0,"Love Primigi shoes for my kids because they wear well and have that stylish European flair...these dont disappoint in that respect, but these had a major issue- the straps are way too long, they reach the floor when my daughter has them adjusted to fit correctly, which leaves a lot to be desired in terms of looks :( especially with the button design on the end of the strap."
3.0,Comfortable but not durable!
3.0,"Based on the photo, I expected the top to be flowy and longer - it was much smaller than expected (ordered XXL and it may barely be a large) and almost crop length rather than below the groin as indicated. Aside from sizing issues, it is still a very nice quality top, and I've given it to my niece instead. She loves it but does wish it were a bit longer."
3.0,It's more of a t-shirt than a sweatshirt. I kept it because it's cute. But definitely should not be descripted as a sweatshirt!
3.0,They do shrink more than anticipated . But very comfortable still.
3.0,"I have bought three of these glasses and each time they fall on the floor from at least 2 feet one of the lenses will pop out. Otherwise if they don't fall, they are really cute glasses and have a mirror reflecting lens"
3.0,I thought it would be a little bit smaller. It's cute though.
3.0,Cute dress but too small in the bust for me
3.0,Not uncomfortable but dont support as much as real compression socks. Felt more like lady's trouser socks. Gave them to my son to wear for basketball like NBA players.
3.0,"Doesn't stay on my shoulder but very soft. Perfect for those ""no bra days"""
3.0,The material has that cheap shine to it but overall it isn't bad.
3.0,"The white one is completely see through, I love this brand and the shirts.  But I'd buy another color but white, I have not found a bra or shirt I can comfortably wear under the see through material.  Stick  to the barker colors. If I went up a few sizes it might not be as transparent,  but then I'd be swimming in the shirt and would defeat the whole purpose."
3.0,"Like the material, but I have a big neck and it's kinda tight"
3.0,I did size up due to the comments .. I am 5.4” and 128 pounds .. the dress was poorly made .. the color and fabric was ok .. I had to take to a seamstress to fix and clean all the seams
3.0,"Average budget tie, not real impressed with how it hangs"
3.0,"Picture isn’t as colorful, but it’s cute. Nice chain."
3.0,I received my order today. I was thrilled that it arrived early. However I was really disappointed when I opened them up and noticed that they looked like a pair of hand me downs. The underarmour logo and the R on the leg was stretched out and had a bunch of cracks. The pants overall are comfy. I read that they ran large and ordered a size down and they are still a little on the big side.
3.0,"I normally wear a 1x and this shirt fit like a large. The length was more like shirt length than tunic/dress. It was an ok shirt, but I'm not keeping it."
3.0,This fell about for me after 20 days of use.
3.0,"This item shipped quickly, but I was disappointed when the chain broke on one of the necklaces in less than a month."
3.0,"Color, cut, and length was great. I would order this dress again but highly recommend ordering up a size."
3.0,Very cute advertisement but misleading. It is NOT for big girls at all. Did not fit
3.0,"Fits bigger girls except for the boob area. For reference I am a 36DD and got an XL. The bra area does not support good, cups too small, and it rolls down. Just doesn't work good for big boobs. Returning but it was really cute, I wish it fit better in the boob area."
3.0,"The design is super cute and fits well. Every time I wear it to the gym though, the ends roll up so much it just looks like I'm wearing underwear lol"
3.0,5' 150 lbs about a us size 10-12. 36B I got a size xxxl in case and it was too big. prob a xxl would have been better. i like how the back has too slits. I like how the tangerines look. Don't know how I feel about it overall but i like the quality of the swimsuit.
3.0,Size chart was misleading. Turns out it was a kids Jersey.  Luckily it fit my 8 yr old daughter
3.0,Dress seems like nice quality. Color isn't quite as pictured and it runs big. Unfortunately the cost to return is the buyers responsibility and shipping to China is outrageous. I thought it was free return since I ordered through Amazon Prime.
3.0,"I have an RBX sweatshirt that I absolutely love and bought this one thinking it would fit the same and be of the same quality, I was sadly mistaken. The fabric is not soft, kind of weird and it fits tight. It seems to be a cheap knockoff."
3.0,Odd in color and does not ware like in the pictures.
3.0,This dress does not hang well.  I wear a size 16 and a 38 DD bra.  I did not like the fit.  It just does not hang well.  The fabric is more of a cotton feel and horribly wrinkled.  I will be returning this dress.
3.0,"While this dress is cute, it's not that comfortable. The material isn't soft, so it's kind of itchy. But I did like the way the dress fit and the way it flowed."
3.0,"We bought this for our 10 year old daughter to use for halloween. It is scary looking - just what she wanted! But..... she couldn't really see out of it so it spent most of Halloween pushed back on her head, off of her face. At least it looked good for pictures."
3.0,I didnt like them and they still fogged up.
3.0,Material feels like polyester. I was hoping for more of a cotton feel. Very thin
3.0,I love it. Mine shrunk the more I washed it sadly
3.0,OAKY
3.0,I have a big but and it was basically a high waisted thong. I want to return it but it feels wrong to do that. I bought it for a family vacation and didnt want to wear it around my kids. I'd wear somewhere there were no kids though
3.0,"Run very small, but very cute"
3.0,"It,s ok. Looks nice but a little cheap I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,"I'm 5'3&#34; it's very long and form fitting, hugs every curve."
3.0,I saw product made by them in the past and that was why I ordered one for a friend.  It is very cheap looking and friend didn't care for it.  There use to be a leather tooled version that was really very nice looking.  Selling this one off at a garage sale to recoup my money at this late date.
3.0,"For the fact that the Measurements are misleading, these glasses do not fit a normal average US Americans Head. I am getting sick of spending money on glasses made for a kids or womens head when it says Mens Sunglasses.  The Frames are perfect size but the lenses are smaller than the frame and is not shown in pic but it is a big difference.  To small for Men good glasses for Woman or childs head."
3.0,I’m only 5 3 and this thing is up past my butt. It’s more like a shirt.
3.0,"Like the pendant it looks exactly as picture shown,the chain is to brittle"
3.0,Too small: I can wear a 1X-2X but I ordered this in a 4X and it was too small. Great material and look.
3.0,This was a gift and no one complained
3.0,Straps on the bag are starting to shred and it was a Christmas gift.
3.0,It is a cute ring but it turned my finger brown when I wore it.
3.0,"Not best quality but you get what you pay for. Fabric is very thin and stitching/edging is very uneven. I do like the length. Very curious why clothing manufacturers do not design, make and sell plus sized clothes that are high quality and classic as far as style goes."
3.0,Comfortable and stay on but so thin they wore holes in the toes within two uses for all three pairs
3.0,"It is pretty, but not as pretty as the picture."
3.0,Enough Springs for a lifetime
3.0,"Ordered  by size chart, can  fit but too small. Not true to size at all."
3.0,Nice costume. Only complaint is that The antlers just hang down the deer’s face. I will need to use a safety pin to keep straight up. I filled the deers arms with newspaper. They were also flimsy. The costume is pretty long. It meant for some one pretty tall. Im 5’7” so its pretty long for me. I got it since it was on sale on black friday
3.0,Very cute but not the material feels kind of like plasticy canvas
3.0,See yhru but comfortable.
3.0,"It’s definitely not the highest quality shirt. Doesn’t provide much shape and wouldn’t recommend sizing down. You want this loose! If it’s too tight it’s the type of material to show every flaw. Other than that it is wide necked and comfy. Back is longer than front, long enough to cover your butt. Olive color is slightly lighter than the photo"
3.0,This is a beautiful skirt but it does run large.  I get so many compliments whenever I wear it.
3.0,"The silicone watch band is excellent but the quick release pins are very weak, after installing on my watch & wiggling the band around, the pin came out of watch, I tried it several times & it would not stay in.  I installed my old regular pins in watch band & all is well.<br />I would give this a 5 star rating if the quick release pins were stronger & more reliable."
3.0,"unfortunately I bought the small shoe, apparently it is for a 2 year old girl and my daughter is 5. in spite of that the shoe is beautiful and of good quality"
3.0,"The belt works well so far. The material is rather stiff, making it tough to thread the belt loops and buckle at times. The biggest drawback is that the buckle is surprisingly large and heavy, and since it's made from a cheaper material, it just clunks while when dressing/undressing. For the price, it's not bad. But if I had it to do again, I would just have spent more to get a better belt."
3.0,Not the best quality but super cute!
3.0,"I am 6'1 and slim, I normally can wear a medium but went with a large to have some wiggle room. I will keep this because it is cute but cannot wear as a dress because it is too short, will work well as a shirt or swim suit coverup though!"
3.0,The ball has been great up until two weeks ago when the stitching started to come undone. I thought it would have lasted longer.
3.0,The top is a little to long. I need to fix it.
3.0,Reloj original de buena calidad pero el estuche está en malas condiciones y el reloj rayado
3.0,For very thin legs only
3.0,A bit loose around the ankles.
3.0,I just a little disappointed it didn’t fit. Wasn’t able to return not going to purchase anytime soon
3.0,I bought this set mostly for the purple gloves.  The correct amount of gloves were included but none were purple—none were even close to purple.
3.0,"I liked how this looked online and off the body, but it just fit me slightly odd. I am about 125lbs and 5'5"". I ordered this in a size small. It fit well in the waist but just fit kind of odd in the top and hips of my body. I do like the material and that this dress had pockets but wasn't thrilled about the cut. I am smaller in the top and a little wider in the bottom half. I do like the colors and the floral design. This could work for someone else, but not for my body type."
3.0,"They do smell strongly. However, they are okay for the price."
3.0,Seemed to be child size
3.0,Ok for price. Very thin. Fit snug.
3.0,Dislike it has a little yellow tint.<br />Love- blocks blue rays from staring at my computer all day.
3.0,"Material a little thin, but comfortable"
3.0,"Fits okay, only because it stretches. The material though is actually awful. Shiny and non cotton."
3.0,"Material is very thin and tight, stretchy. The seam on the collar of the jacket isnt secure so it flips out all the way down the jacket. It would be better with a button or clasp or with the collar lining sewn down the middle. I would size up, i got my normal size and it fits but the next size up would have been more comfortable and probably still really tight."
3.0,"Butterfly was smaller than expected. It was a gift, the recipient was very pleased with it. Nice quality. Stones are shiny."
3.0,"This is a beautiful piece of jewelry that looks way nicer than its price tag reveals. I get complements every time I wear it. However, I was surprised no previous reviewer mentions the lead warning that comes with the necklace that says no one younger than 14 should wear it. Uh, what? Not very reassuring."
3.0,It's pretty but also pretty small. I did read the dimensions but it looked larger on the model. Maybe a nicer chain will make it look nicer. The chain it came with is very cheap looking.
3.0,"It is warm, looks pretty good for being inexpensive. Did have a button fall off right away but I got it back on. Overall I like it, and it is very warm"
3.0,The tassels are not secured to the earring; they will eventually loosen and fall out.
3.0,"It is a 3X shirt, but it's a women's 3X shirt, rather than a men's. I gave it to a friend of mine, who likes it quite well, says it's warm and comfortable. So, although it wasn't of any use to my husband, my friend got a new shirt, so it's still a win."
3.0,Cute but small runs too big they need an extra small
3.0,This sweatshirt feels rough and of low quality... it is warm and looks ok....but kinda thick and also rough when you touch it... i am not crazy about it but it is usable...
3.0,Loved the design but it was too see through for my taste
3.0,Missing 1 pair of earrings.  2 sent.  Missing  the ball  pair.  Otherwise I would give it a 5 star rating.
3.0,These were a little smaller and a little bluer than I thought they'd be. Not the greatest quality but for the price I like them
3.0,The pearl broke off less than an hour after wearing this necklace.
3.0,The item fit my son well and initially looked like really good quality but after one use there was a lot of pulling and fraying of the fabric.
3.0,The mask size is somewhat small on me. I use an XL helmet if that helps any.<br />It does tend to fog up my eyewear because of the gap between the check and nose.<br />I also have a large neck so it does fit tightly around it. So it doesn’t droop under the chin. It is a snug fit.
3.0,"Product has way to many design issues.  If you have a really big head and don't want to put over prescription glasses they  may work for you. Besides being to wide for a normal head like me ,  the goggles are not designed to allow frame to fit  your prescription frames correctly in the middle, therfore never fitting  snugly on your face . Really disappointed."
3.0,this is smaller than what it was advertized.  very nice looking just very small
3.0,I ordered an XXL but feels more like an XL. Runs a tad bit small.
3.0,Material was not as nice as expected
3.0,"I previously wrote to say that the circular leather loop, that holds the end of the strap down, came apart.  I need to either sew it or glue it, as the end of the strap keeps sticking up and catching on this, so I am not able to wear my watch.  BTW,  I previously sent a note saying the band had come undone, but didn't hear from provider."
3.0,Did not care for the silky material and is small for a medium.
3.0,Color wasnt as it appeared
3.0,It’s super cute but broke way to easy wouldn’t Recommend
3.0,"If you have a small face but want bigger glasses without it looking too big, these are perfect. The only reason I gave these 3 stars is because the item I received was the wrong color. They were red instead of black framed. I tried reordering and once again received a reddish color frame and also they were scratched. Amazon's customer service was great with my refund but unfortunately were not able to guarantee me a black pair so I've kept the original red pair. Would have loved these if they were black framed."
3.0,"I was hoping this dress was super long, as I’m 5’11” and have a hard time finding maxi dresses that touch the floor. The dress unfortunately only comes to my ankles. Other than that, I love the color and material. Just wish it was longer."
3.0,Doesn't stay together for very long with moving around which is a shame when you are meant to wear it whole you are working
3.0,"This is definitely heavier than I expected.  A co-worker has one of these and it seems to really help keep all the cables and gadgets organized.  I don't always work from the office, but try to keep my things organized and as light as possible for my commute.  This is the size I expected, but feel it just adds way too much weight for what I was trying to do.<br /><br />I would order again, but definitely a smaller size and w/o the zipper pocket which may cause the added weight."
3.0,A little too small.
3.0,Cute but not enough &#34;dangle&#34;. The tips of the hooks keep getting tangled/stuck with the charms.
3.0,Too little for my head
3.0,"Cute shirt! But was lavender,  not like pic at all."
3.0,"color is nice, fabric is quite thin."
3.0,Love it and looks great! Need to get an underskirt for the flare but I expected this.
3.0,"case is nice, protects the keyfob, but..it also blocks rf signal, i have to stand close to trunk to open it, also to open door needs to be closer, maybe mazda 2 2019 has weak rf, anyway the case is making it a little difficult for the car to sense the fob."
3.0,"Material was too shiny for me, but it was a pretty color and felt nice. I returned it. Also the color is alot more vibrant than in the photo"
3.0,"These are very thin fabric material. They feel even less than your dollar store bandanas. I'll keep then for work related things, but don't expect them to last."
3.0,"I am using it outside of the winter long jacket, and it's still big. I had to sew it to make it shorter. One thing I should give credit is the fact that after using almost 4 months, the durability is still great."
3.0,"Really great looking. Colors are vivid. These masks are very comfortable and easy to breathe through... Too easy. I tried the ""blow out a match"" test and they failed. These are not very good as protective masks.<br /><br />HOWEVER, there's a pocket for an insert in each mask. The masks are nice enough looking that I wouldn't warn you off purchasing them **so long as you also purchase some filters to insert in the masks** when wearing out in public.<br /><br />Even with a filter, I would not recommend these masks for long-term wear in an environment (like a job) where you may be exposed to multiple people or to one person in the same room for an extended period. I just don't trust that the material is up to the job. I urge you not to wear one of these masks without a filter."
3.0,This wallet is a bit wider than expected but build quality is good.
3.0,"Material: 3.5/5 the material seems to be standard swimsuit material and looks like it won’t turn transparent in water<br /><br />Style: 3.5/5 Style could look sexy on some  but the cuts are too wide and clumsy! It reveals a lot more than I expected<br /><br />Fit: 2.5/5 I am usually a size small but I sized up after reading the reviews, but then as well it was difficult to get on and a bit tight around my lower waist and hip area, which was surprising. Also a few side strips are loose and just flops. People with muffin top should really get this, else all extra fat will peek out through the strips<br /><br />Ease of use: 2.5/5 This swimsuit will be good if you are stick thin and just want some cute pictures but it’s highly inconvenient for swimming. There are straps all over and you wouldn’t want some of it getting stuck somewhere! Also doing the back straps is tough!"
3.0,"Fit as expected until washed. The top shrunk and changed form, meaning the side seams were no longer straight and the top twisted around. I threw the top away."
3.0,"Super comfy and stretchy. However the ties for the ""sleeves"" ripped already. One wasnt sewn on very well and the other ripped when I ducked down. Not the best quality but you get what you pay for."
3.0,"Super cute dress but they sent me a 2XL and I wear a medium so I returned it.<br /><br />I like the material, the style, the colors.. but was way to big for me."
3.0,just to large but looked good
3.0,"Not for curvy gals,  looks great with the bust, but shows off every roll on your hips.  I'm not even fat and it looked awful on me,  it does not give on the hips or butt."
3.0,Going on a trip to Disneyland and thought this will be nice to take instead of a full size purse. The package arrived today and when I opened it and started looking inside I noticed a key in one of the pockets. On further inspection the little charm on the wrist strap was missing a stone. The missing stone is no big deal but what bothers me is they sent me used (returned) merchandise. Other than these couple minor issues everything else looks good.
3.0,"Generally speaking, I liked the neck wallet. It is light, easy to carry around/conceal under/over clothing, with plenty of storage. I would rate it higher if the neck straps were resistant to cut and tear by thiefs. I would recommend thin metal/cable neck straps that are better when you are commuting in subways and/or city buses during peak hours. A professional pickpocket would have no problem in cutting these flimsy straps and you will NOT even feel it. I travel a lot and believe me, you need to protect your valuables as much as possible.  I know, my money and documents were picked in the Buenos Aires subway."
3.0,"Very pretty. The main wrap is very nice quality for the price. The ties however broke off after being worn for an hour. Also, I am small and I feel this would fit a medium/ large the best. I am going to just cut the tie off on the other side and keep it since it’s pretty."
3.0,These are just heat shrink tubes and not regular aglets. Go to any hardware store and you can pick up the same thing for less than half the price.
3.0,So this is lovely thin material in a pretty bright shade of pink but the seams in the front are horrible- several centimeter thick seems down the front which are VERY noticeable in the thin fabric. I seriously doubt my child is going to wear this even with a tank top underneath. SO disappointed. Would not recommend for a child with any pickiness about comfort at all
3.0,Definitely disappointed with the product. I live in a rural area so I use this service fairly often.
3.0,"Reverse stitchng at the waist, and very see through."
3.0,Bigger and heavier than it looks.
3.0,"Cute designs, nice variety, but 2 of the 12 masks were defective...the design was just not good... eye holes didn't line up with where eyes actually are on a human face. I bought these for a dance costume, and well they really aren't durable enough for that., especially the tiny elastic strap on them. I guess there're just made for standing around in."
3.0,This wallet is cute but pretty small. With putting my change in it barely closes. If it were bigger or ample to accommodate more “stuff” I’d give it 5 stars.<br />So if you have 10+ cards or keep a lot of change or want your checkbook in your wallet this isn’t the wallet for you!
3.0,"I'm 5'3"" & weight 130 lbs. and got the Large Petite.  The bottoms were WAY too big and long.  It wouldn't have shrunk that much to fit me.  The top I might have kept, but it comes as a set.  The sleeves were a bit long (but I could roll them up.  Returned it."
3.0,"It looked super cute, but felt super awkward and was a little difficult to put in and take out"
3.0,"The seams start to rip after a few weeks.  I have worn two of them and both have started to rip at the seam.  Also, needs more stretch in order to get over the braids, unless you lead the hair in inch by inch."
3.0,"These were cute,  quality yes, stretch no"
3.0,I agree with other reviewers who noted that the cross strap between toe strap and ankle strap is ill designed -- too large. Back these went.<br />I really like Franco Sarto sandals generally and will be checking Nordstrom Rack as well.
3.0,It's way too large than the description.....I returned it.
3.0,OK.  Probably overpriced.
3.0,It is to small for ladies that are over weight unfortunately that is me so i have to give itaway
3.0,"I love this blouse, made very well & I received a lot of compliments from friends and strangers. However, the bust area runs very small all away around towards the back. I’m not very heavy cheated I don’t think.. lol.. This causes a pull in my upper backside area.. Otherwise it is a beautiful blouse and I’m very please.."
3.0,Bill was a little bent
3.0,Cute necklace however it's bigger then expected thought I'd be more dainty piece  of jewelry. Definitely more of custom jewelry.
3.0,"The shoe looks very nice  The cushion foot bed is adequate  The Problem is the strap over the top, at ankle.  It rides too high and rubs across ankle.  Very uncomfortable.  I missed the return cutoff on these. So to someone else they will go I guess.<br />I did return a few weeks ago, and requested a credit, but have yet to hear from anyone."
3.0,"Very good material and workmanship, its just that it is quite large.  Maybe I'm not an xlrg (yea) (5'9 230 lbs)"
3.0,"I love the product, but the blue can get a bit dirty easily, other than that I'd recommend it"
3.0,"I thought the band might be a little thinner in width. I don't have small wrists or hands so bulkier items usually look ok, but this is a bit much."
3.0,Not exactly xs and came in folded and full of creases that needed to be irones out and also the buttons were on the left. Personally wish the buttons were black instead of gold.
3.0,It’s a little cheaper then the picture shows but still cute
3.0,They do not work well at all for touchscreen gloves. They are also bulky and awkward.
3.0,"Shirt was great but I ordered to small, was a bummer with no exchange offered."
3.0,"Uneven stitching made the edge puffy in one spot. For the price, I would expect the stitching to be without defects.<br /><br />Not silk, but nice and soft. No stretch to the material except at the waistband."
3.0,Chiffon material is a little rough. The pics look like it's elastic at the bottom but they aren't. Pics look a little different from real product.
3.0,"First, the green is very pretty, and that's what drew me to ordering it. I'm a petite size 2 or XS, and my bust is 34 B.  The top part was a bit loose and the straps too long. The waist and hips are fine, and so is the length. The material is also a bit thin. I'm keeping it, as I can sew/adjust the straps."
3.0,The belt was too short.
3.0,"These are pretty close to invisible under clothes, not totally, and not as good as other brand's I've purchased from nicer lingerie stores.  They are also not as cute as they look in the picture.  It's just a little more granny panty looking than it should be for a bikini brief.  The material is ok, they're not uncomfortable.  For when I just need something that won't show under a skirt with more clingy-type fabrics this is pretty good."
3.0,I ended up not loving the fabric but the jacket was cute and fit as expected.
3.0,"Size up...I haven't worn then because they are too tight. I also thought they had a built in bra, but they don't."
3.0,"One ring wasn’t cut properly, others are still little rough around edges, but I got lots of rings and it was cheap so it’s fine:)"
3.0,"my daughter LOVEs the bracelet, but the clasp has broken on her twice now. It can be fixed with a pair of needle-nose pliers but the clasp and chain that hold in on the wrist is cheap. The leather braid part is well-constructed."
3.0,They came in the bag with loose threads inside the socks
3.0,Info states bathing suit but no liner inside and not typical bathing suit material
3.0,Did not get to wear way to small more like a shirt
3.0,"I just recently purchased a pair for my daughter last week. She loved them, they are amazing shoes! However, the next day when she wore them the right shoe stopped lighting up. It wouldn't light up while both shoes were charging to know if it was properly charging.....both shoes would normally light up red while charging. The right shoe has shown signs that it's still getting a charge when we press the button, but I don't believe it's charging correctly because it always stop working, but the left shoe still works."
3.0,very very small.
3.0,"Really wanted to love this but didn't. Overall, it's very good quality and looks like the picture. I just didn't like it on me mainly because I'm so short. Also, I'm 5', 110 lbs, and 34B. I ordered the small and the top fit perfectly while the bottom was super tight and cut into my butt."
3.0,"Pretty dress - but NO lace insert came with my dress. Also, this is not a sheath dress...it has a pencil design (tapers in towards your legs from the hips down). The fabric is knit, so it clings. Every dress I own is a size 10 - this was more like a medium (8). I had to return it."
3.0,Good hat but it’s not embroidered it’s just an iron on sticker
3.0,"It's problems are sideways button holes. It doesn't make sense. Again,great prices though."
3.0,thick fabric does not move easily within belt loops.
3.0,"the blue one is more brigth but its ok the product, would be betther longer hanger"
3.0,"Mas o menos , no era lo q esperaba"
3.0,"The mask is light weight . It is one thin layer,  It fits well and I have had multiple complements on the butterfly pattern."
3.0,"kind of a weird fit.  &#34;around&#34; it was good in the chest, hips, waist.. but the &#34;length&#34; of it is too short.  don't get me wrong, I'm completely fine wearing low-cut blouses, etc.. but this suit doesn't stretch enough and the fabric pulls on the straps.. and reveals more than is acceptable in a public setting.  I wore it around my house for about 5 minutes, and now it will go to goodwill so I don't have to hassle with the return."
3.0,Dress fit was a bit short wasted and I didn't care for the fabric weight - too flimsy.
3.0,"Expensive. But it's the same straps you get with a brand new watch. Gave it only 3 stars because it's expensive and it doesn't come with springs. If you really want an original strap (like me), then buy this."
3.0,"I was astonished to find a sterling silver chain for such a low price.  Maybe it was just the chain I ordered, but the clasp broke after less than two months of gentle use.  It looks good, lays well and you can't beat the price, but now the next box chain I buy will be at cost plus the price of this one.  Not fixable.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/15/2011:  The second chain we ordered from this company also broke with no force.  It's a nice chain, but we're moving on to a new brand."
3.0,"They look great, fit great and do block a LOT of blue light but the nosepiece is extremely uncomfortable on my nose and the bifocal part on the lense could be a bit larger/placed higher on the lens for easier use; I find I have to tip my head back to use the bifocal part. If those two issues could be addressed, these would easily be five star glasses."
3.0,Buyers need to look closely at the picture as 2 initials (E and O) are part of the design. People without an E or O might not want them.
3.0,I bought the dark blue in XL and they were very stretchy borderline too big. So I bought the brown in size large. The material was less stretchy even tho the descriptions are the same. So now the larges are too small because it has less give. Probably gift them.
3.0,Product was slightly see through. And I bought the green color and it was still see through
3.0,"Great fit, cute style, fabric is low quality, pills and does not wash well. Wore once and looked worn, before end of evening. Worse after washing."
3.0,Flimsy: the hooks funny hold the mask straps properly. When they work they’re comfy.
3.0,"Doesn't stay on that well. Okay for the price, but not grand by any means."
3.0,very nice fit. Just wish the fabric was a little softer. Overall very good leggins
3.0,"I did it in hopes for some fun different things, but got a LOT of different captain America's, and mickey type ones.. I was hoping for a cow it more dog stuff like a paw or something..."
3.0,"Very small in the bust.  Nice material and style, but if you have any size to your top it won't fit."
3.0,Fairly cheap quality material. Also smaller than anticipated. I have a larger than average head and can't find a good fit for this hat even using the adjustable strap.
3.0,It is good but comes in a bag guess not bring hard case.
3.0,"I returned this top.  I didn’t not like how it fit.  It was not flattering on me.  It’s pretty, but just didn’t look good on me."
3.0,It's okay for the price but it was way too big for me. It feels like it is going to fall off of my face if I move. It's not horrible though.<br /><br />Edit: Okay it fits now but still 3 stars. I have sewn down the top a little bit so it would fit to my face; It was a easy fix.<br /><br />Good:<br />~ It is very soft and the fabric is thick.<br />~Easy to breath<br /><br />Bad:<br />~Way too big for me<br />~printing in spotted in some parts.
3.0,The chain was small. I couldn't wear it.
3.0,"The jacket was a thin satiny material, it was fine for how much I was paying. The lettering and material overall seemed good enough quality for a Halloween costume. Mine had a large hole in the back, it looks like the fabric misaligned while it was being sewn, not a tear or anything. 3 other people in my office ordered them as well and didn't have any issues with their jackets. Returning it was simple enough. I would have bought another one from the same company without too much worry, but ended up borrowing one someone had laying around."
3.0,Its cute and all but I'm walking to class right and the whole wallet breaks open and all my money falls on the ground. Not a fun experience
3.0,Not sure it's worth $10 but daughter likes it.
3.0,If you have long legs this one is for you! Otherwise I love it it compliment my Xmas outfit
3.0,"in person looks different than it display, color looks grey/pink, the fur around hood edge poorly done looks like it's going to fall off."
3.0,They are to short for me and there is not an option go TG.The material is very thin.
3.0,"I bought this as a gift for my husband, who is a Bears fan and BBQ fanatic that always gets grease all over his shirt when he smokes meat.  He loved it, but it's almost too small to be useful.  It fits my 9 yr old son. On my husband it barely comes to the bottom of his shirt.  It will serve its purpose but looks a bit ridiculous on a 6'1"" man.  If it's for a smaller guy with a thin build you will probably be ok."
3.0,"Got for wife to wear, as she is needing a new suit for her work wear. The outfit is nice material but unfortunately the fit is off. We got the smallest size as my wife is typically between an S and XS, mostly the latter. But with the S size, it's tight on the shoulder area, too snug for moving arms around, yet the waist area isn't snug and bit on the looser side, so it doesn't hug the waist. The sleeves might also be a bit short. If one is wearing long sleeve dress shirts underneath, then the blazer's sleeves end too early to expose a bit too much cuff of the dress shirt. If not wearing such underneath, the sleeves expose too much of the arm. But I'm not versed in women's fashion, maybe that's the style for women compared to men? Otherwise, the sleeve fit is not good. The skirt fits nice and ok, but hugs tight to the hips, in that the zippers are hard to zip up/down without someone helping the wearer of the outfit. Overall a good outfit set, but could use improvement. If it doesn't fit perfect for you, it might need some tailoring, if you decide to keep it."
3.0,"These pants are nice, but are waaay darker than the photo! If you want navy pants that are almost black then these are the ones that you want, but if you’re looking for the nice shade of blue shown in the picture don’t buy these."
3.0,"Really loved this dress, beautiful but see through.  And the slit was a bit higher than I liked."
3.0,These rings are super cute.  My daughter loved them for her bday present.  Wasn't long before her fingers turned green though
3.0,"El material no es lo que esperaba , soy fans de este artículo mis primeras compras excelentes... esta no!"
3.0,I liked that it looked like the pic. What I didn't like was the strong chemical odor it had! Very strong! 3 stars for that.
3.0,Good but too large and the pink is not as light as the picture
3.0,The colors were duller than expected.
3.0,I DID NOT LIKE THE FACT IT WAS A VERY SMALL PENDANT SIZE OF A DIME FOR THE MONEY SPENT SHOULDS AT LEAST STATE THE SIZE OF ITEM BUT ITS VERY NICE WHAT YOU CAN SEE OF IT
3.0,"Definitely does the job as a Minnie costume, but isn't very fancy. The collar is roughly hemmed, the polka dots don't go all the way around the back of the dress, but my 3 year old is happy. She's in the size 4-6x and I think she'll fit into it for a long time, if the costume holds up."
3.0,"This dress has a beautiful cut. However, it is a very thin, t-shirt like material. It was completely wrinkled when I opened the bag. It also clings to your body, so it outlines every curve or underwear line. I'm 5'8&#34;, 145lb and Medium fit me will."
3.0,The dress slit was extremely high and required alterations and the fabric material was very cheap. Otherwise the dress was nice for a holiday party.
3.0,These worked great until awhile after use the sides broke off.
3.0,"After reviewing many back packs I selected this one...and ended up with a good bag that has some notable flaws.  The size of the bag is perfect.  A little larger than most but it will hold whatever I need to bring with me.  The additional pockets...great.  They allow for organization and additional storage.<br />It also has some issues with construction.  This is a soft bag so no reinforced shape...this is not good for a laptop unless you add padding to protect the computer.  The canvas material is great, but the snaps are cheap and probably won't last.  One of the snaps broke the FIRST time I used it.  The straps have a strange magnetic clasp hidden under the buckles.  Odd thing to put on the back pack...  I gave this three stars out of five...for good material, good size, and prompt delivery.  I took away 2 stars...one for faulty workmanship and one for poor hardware.<br />I decided to keep the bag and took it to a friend who has an industrial type sewing machine.  She will double stitch everything, make the straps and snaps actually usable, and get rid of the magnets.  Once this is done I believe that this will be THE backpack that I have been looking for..."
3.0,The jacket works out great except after a few months one of the seam in the back popped. Cheap quality for the price I paid for.
3.0,they didn't fit my wife's plastic frames. they won't fit any plastic frames. They should tell you this before you buy them.
3.0,It’s a nice blouse but a little too sheer
3.0,I love the shorts! The thing I didn't like was the fact that I payed almost $50 for these shorts and when I received them the tag on the shorts had a price tag of $30. I feel like they ripped me off.
3.0,Delivery was super fast. Product was new as described. However the product rouched up really bad in the back when tried on. So I returned it. I would still purchase from seller again.
3.0,"Since it's a one-size, I shouldn't be too surprised; but it is rather tight and therefore rides up a bit. I wasn't expecting something quite so form fitting."
3.0,"Cute dress but I did not realize until after I had worn it to an event, that the stitching on the busy was off. The decorative mesh on the one side was sewn over so there were differences in appearance of the top portion of the dress. Be sure to inspect before you wear."
3.0,Fits awlward! Got a medium at first but it didnt fit. Returned and ordered a large and fit awkward. The under wire was warped and it was just not comfy.
3.0,Mis-labeled.  This is a woman's watch.
3.0,Excelente p niña
3.0,Order three of this product only one of them was satisfactory.
3.0,"I was a little disappointed in how small the stone is, I love the ring but it's hard to notice the beautiful stones color."
3.0,My toddler couldn’t get his<br />Foot in very easily! Cute design and looks pretty durable!
3.0,"Ordered a medium; the shirt fit well but the pants were so tight around the waist. The quality was good and they were cute, so I was sad I had to return"
3.0,"It didn't come in the box shown in the order, came in a cheaper looking box,  I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,"Well made, looked great with the exception that the apron was longer than the skirt part of the dress by several inches. Would be super happy if it were like the picture but it wasn't. That part was disappointing. Should have been right considering the price is relatively high for such an item. If it weren't for the apron it would have been perfect. Sadly for me, I didn't catch that fact until I was literally dressed and headed out for an Oktoberfest celebration. I can't figure out how to contact the vendor so I guess I'm stuck."
3.0,Fairly thin and cheap feeling but it’ll do.
3.0,Very thin material. Most likely one time use.<br />Runs very small. Definitely order a size up.<br />Other than that- would do the job for the price!
3.0,"I'm 5'11 and 180lbs they fit great the material is very swishy (loud) and there's 1 little pocket inside, I was expecting outside pockets"
3.0,"Black Tank- pretty good, the quality is fine, runs a bit small so I got a Med, since Im usually a small. Fits good. The only issue I have is that it kind of bends over in the front, and doesnt lay flat above my chest- this has nothing to do with my size chest, it is the material, but other than that, for the price its worth it."
3.0,In picture look like beautiful. I don't like it
3.0,"My daughter loved the colors, style, and comfort of this ""dress"" but I ordered the 7y-8y for my 5 year old and it was entirely too short to be worn as a dress. She is still able to wear it with leggings but it should not be labeled as a dress."
3.0,"Sizing is way off. I am 140lbs, 5'5, 40"" hips and normally wear medium but could not even get the medium over my hips. I re-ordered XL and they fit but not much stretch."
3.0,"I like this skirt but I have one reservation. It bleeds even in cold water and that's all I use in my washer. So be prepared for that. Otherwise, I love wearing  it."
3.0,Stiff bottoms.  They are exactly as pictured and cute.  My baby doesn't fit these yet.  Seems like they are meant more for toddler than an infant.They are huge for a 3 month old.  Maybe when she is about 9-12 months....
3.0,"I got a 2XL thinking it would be super huge on me and a really baggy fit but it fits snug on me. It’s fits me like a Large, not extra large or two XL. But I should’ve gotten 3 sizes too big for baggy fit"
3.0,"Not full cover all around, wide open at the bottom of glasses."
3.0,"Said to buy one size larger and we did, and was not what expected. Package came in good condition but not we she wanted."
3.0,I didn’t get the silver one
3.0,Cute earring but they are more tan tortoise and have an orange flower it’s not that pretty pink color at all
3.0,"I received the Crocs, loved the style and the color, but they just did not feel good on my feet.  I had to send them back."
3.0,Pretty but hard to snap and too snug in middle.
3.0,"Cute, but a little in the thin side. I can see my big toe through the stretched fabric."
3.0,Hide nicely in shoes yet cut into your ankles. By the end of the day I can’t wait to get them off. Come packaged nicely.
3.0,This guy is very fragile. his arm broke while getting him out of the box. beware that he is a very delicate skeleton.
3.0,"I purchased this top in several colors in size Medium. I wear a size M-L in tops and sometimes XL for a relaxed fit. I knew the style of this top was loose which is why I purchased the medium, I should have gone with a small. Approximate measurements unstretched: underarm to underarm 19&#34;, underarm to hem at shortest side seam 11&#34;. The hemline scoops down in the front and back but the sides are really short, almost crop length.  The fabric is thin and very stretchy with the white being on the sheer side of semi-sheer. The white would need a cami under the top which sort of defeats the purpose. I liked the style enough that I'm returning the Medium and ordering more in Small...minus the white. If the sizing info had been more accurate and I hadn't purchased the white I might have rated it higher."
3.0,Nice shirt but it wrinkled so easily and also size chart doesn't match.
3.0,Need two sizes bigger for the look!
3.0,"I own several of these skater style fandom dresses, this one is made from the same stretch fabric as the rest but this style does not have the waist seam. I only gave this &#34;MIDDLE EARTH&#34; dress 3 stars because the printing is blurry as if they over enlarged the print design to make it fit dress OR it may just be a defected dress."
3.0,The fit is a little big and for the price all you get is an iron on symbol nice hoodie but not for $50
3.0,The top is way too padded....adds like a whole cup size up! If I could take the pads out it would be perfect. The bottom is a lot smaller then pictured. The picture looks like it covers more.
3.0,Doesn’t feel real soft. Kinda weird material. Is thin and light weight which is nice for summer. But it was not worth what I paid.
3.0,It’s a beautiful dress but not if you have a larger stomach. It’s very comfy but the empire waist accentuates big tummies. If I ever lose weight this will look amazing.
3.0,Made very well but thicker material than I prefer in warmer months. I also prefer only one pocket but good quality.
3.0,"Chest area was really tight, and uncomfortable. I ordered my normal size, and it was tight on the chest. Fit everywhere else tho."
3.0,I like the outfit colors but I am kind of disappointed in the bottom piece. The ruffles are sagging and not firmly sewn in place. It looks cute in the picture but I wish they would fix the ruffles and sew them more firmly held in place and not sagging so much. Otherwise I would give it a 5 if that was fixed. Hoping
3.0,"the product is very pretty, I had lots of complements from friends and coworkers. But one of the crystal chain broke within a week. I wish this product is more durable."
3.0,"Cute, but the ring connecting the half heat to the clip broke in like a day and now my pupper's half is gone forever"
3.0,It’s a beautiful dress. Just make sure to size up it’s not true to size.
3.0,Fits small and the slit in the front was practically riding so high my crotch would be visible.  Will be returning this.
3.0,"This bag is cute but it has an awful smell. After a few days with a dryer sheet in it, it still has a terrible odor. Gross. Kind of embarrassing to carry around for that reason. It’s unfortunate because the bag is so cute 😭"
3.0,Good fit. A little looser than Iike
3.0,"Its ok, you get what you payed for. Cheap fabric."
3.0,Nice but I wish it was a little bigger and that the backpack straps were detachable. Wish the main compartment opened up larger.
3.0,"I bought this for my daughter's who are very much into headbands at the time.  This is a cute product, but I can't say it's that sturdy.  However, it is comfortable and they do wear it, so for the price I payed, I say it was worth it."
3.0,Beautiful tops but too small ordered large would not fit
3.0,Way too small. It was pretty but it just didn't fit. The zipper was also a bit troublesome.
3.0,The bracelet is too big for my tiny wrists.
3.0,"Really cute set but, unfortunately WAY too small. On myself personally it was not flattering at all, due to the size. I would recommend sizing up one or even two sizes if you’re looking to buy this set."
3.0,"Only good for a baggie shirt, the material is good quality but not what I thought it was."
3.0,When product arrive one of the nose pieces was bent lower than the other so they did not sit right on my nose. Luckily I was able to very carefully bend it into a better position so that they sit normally on my face.
3.0,"This suit is so very cute! The problem is, you better have really small breasts. Ordered an XXL, which fit perfect and is true to size, but the bust area is so odd. The cup inserts need to go, for one, but the underwire is for someone with a tiny breast, and the overall bust area is huge, so you can't even get a push up thing going. Just poorly designed in that area."
3.0,"Love the sleeve length & neckline. I typically wear an XL T-shirt with room, this XL fits too snug around bust and belly and is see through."
3.0,I like the way it clicks on. That is awesome. But the buckle is really uncomfortable. But i have a big belly
3.0,"The material is much thinner and a little see-through, and there are thick, embroidered sort of edges that make it feel a little uncomfortable around the neck and sleeves. The flowers are as pictured and the purple is a nice color."
3.0,a little snug but not bad for the price
3.0,"Very thin, top had a weird boxy shape that didn’t fit well. Ordered a xl which is my usual and it fit fine but ended returning bc of the top"
3.0,I liked the material but it ran a little small.
3.0,"Looked nice online, but stuff and not soft inside."
3.0,Very cute dress though
3.0,Nice dress but way too small and short and I'm  only 5'3..
3.0,The reflective material can rub off or detach from abrasion.
3.0,"Beautiful, but cheap clasp on the necklace."
3.0,"Ordered a black case as shown, received a white case"
3.0,"She loved it, and I'm happy it's &#34;fake&#34;.  AND......she has four more!!!"
3.0,Too big on top
3.0,I wish that it was a little longer and had a different buckle.
3.0,Lightweight trousers great for summer.  Poor quality. They tore easily
3.0,"Excellent, but the product that arrived was NOT the &#34;P8&#34; model that is shiny material which I ordered.  Instead it was the &#34;P6&#34; model which is a dull matt-like. non-shiny material, which is NOT what is pictured for the p8 choice and NOT what I ordered.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B06VV8PM74 MUSCLE ALIVE Mens Bodybuilding Competition Posing Trunks Nylon and Spandex Size L Black-P8]]"
3.0,[[VIDEOID:a3408ba1ab460a323d07a06ff3435448]] I edited the size and visibility of my photos before submitting my order and none of the photos came out to the way I edited them. Kinda dissapointed..
3.0,This  ring is ok wasn't that impressed
3.0,"looks funny and very shinny in the night. Love this design, and but some works only a while,but for this money ,i have to say,it this quality. Just ok"
3.0,"If you have larger breasts (C cup and above), do not attempt to wear this.  Seriously... Do not do it lol<br />All jokes aside, the bottom fits perfectly; The only issue is with the top.  But it can be fixed with taping or a secure black bandeau, so you are not putting a lot of stress on the neck with the string ties if you have a heavy chest.<br />The color is rather nice, though.. Like a burgundy."
3.0,"If you wear a size 7 1/4 or smaller.... The hat will gap on the sides even if you tighten it all the way....... What im saying is , you have to have a big head to fit properly....."
3.0,"I have mixed thoughts on this dress. I would say that is totally cute on, but uncomfortable to wear. The elastic at the shoulders required constant adjustment to keep it in place with even the smallest of movements. The material did not feel good on the skin and the belt is detached and hard to find a way to tie it so it laid correctly. I did like the length for me (4 foot 10), but it would probably be really, really short for anyone talker. I believe I ordered a size bigger than I normally wear based on reviews. You will probably gets lots of compliments on the dress, but will be miserable the whole time you are wearing it just trying to keep the shoulder elastic and belt from moving constantly."
3.0,"It's ok, it seems like the first time I wore it, it stretched out and won't really fit snug like it shows in the picture anymore."
3.0,"It fit snug despite being I have a small head and its one size fits all compared to other brands that say the same thing.<br /><br />I have to say though that it isn't as warm as others I've tried...and believe me I've ordered six from amazon to try out.<br /><br />My recommendation is seirus innovation's ultra clava. By far the most comfortable and warmest that I've tried. Added plus is that it actually IS waterproof and windproof.<br /><br />Buy that, make sure you buy the correct size, and I swear you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />3 stars for comfortability and fit.<br />1 for warmth."
3.0,I liked it but the feather portion of the arrow came unscrewed extremely easily and it was lost within weeks.
3.0,My husbands size 12 shoes barely fit and it’s very cheap quality.
3.0,works ok. a bit flimsy
3.0,Fabric did not seem great quality and sizing runs large.
3.0,They aren’t keep their shape and get smaller after wash
3.0,"The quality isn’t quite what I expected, it’s not very warm. It does run small and there was a huge smell of chlorine on it when I opened it so it has to be dry cleaned before wearing.  The dry cleaning is more then the jacket so all considered I got what I paid for lol"
3.0,"lovely to look at, but seem flimsy. Not sure how long they will last."
3.0,Not as flattering as I expected!
3.0,Very cute but totally sheer. Better as a bathing suit cover up than something to wear in public.
3.0,"tighter than the fit guide led me to expect, but a soft material so comfortable for brief periods, till the compression gets too much."
3.0,This dress has beautiful color and the fabric is thicker than I expected. I’m going to keep it and alter it to fit. I’ve ordered from China before and it’s been a nightmare getting a return completed!
3.0,"Very light and plasticy, but my 5 year old daughter thinks its great."
3.0,Nice costume but hard to keep inflated. Batteries do not last long.
3.0,"I'm on the fence about this jacket. I usually buy a medium in Allegra K clothing and they normally fit well. This was quite a bit too large. It's pretty massive. The sleeves are too long and the body of the coat is also big. It looks good on the model in the product picture, but I wish I would have paid closer attention to the placement of the buttons and the size of the collar. I may keep it, but I probably couldn't button it without looking like it ate me. On a positive note, it is FANTASTIC quality. It comes lined and it's a heavy coat."
3.0,Fits perfect just made for women who are taller than 5 ft! There is 3 inches on the ground.
3.0,"Nice looking, however the posts are super soft and easily bends. Would not order again."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:8e8c3e9096fc11bb891032d883ed7d5a]] Concerned because the waist area is too big. I bought the sm/med. I am 5’4 150 lbs. the area are tricky to get tight but do one and then do the second tight and go back and redo the first one. Let’s are too long and won’t stay in place and I have not even tried to work out with it. The material is thick and great quality. Just not made for short or smaller girls. I am not sure if anyone else is having these issues? Know a way to fix these to keep?
3.0,"Nice, heavy piece. Came very nicely boxed and with certificate. Measurements are incorrect. Not 27L. Closer to 60 inches long, can be doubled over."
3.0,"If this had fit as I expected I would have included a picture or video with my review, but because it is too tight, I have avoided the embarrassment. It's soft and lightweight material, but because it's too small I look like Homer Simpson with stretched buttonholes. If you order this, please make sure to order a size or two larger than you need. There is also a slight shrink after the first wash."
3.0,"The ring is bright and the gemstone is vibrant and well faceted. It is a bit clunkier than it looked in the photos, and the edges are a bit... not really sharp, but because it's a little clunky they're uncomfortable against the fingers on either side of the ring. I'ts great for special occasion wearing, but I wouldn't be able to wear it daily."
3.0,"Very pretty.  Was hoping sweater would be longer, but it's VERY short."
3.0,Está mucho mejor la tela
3.0,Not what I wanted does not fit right
3.0,"Cute shirt, but I am 5&#34;11 and 145 lbs. and this definitely was not long enough for me to wear with leggings. I was hoping it would be long and flowey but it's just a regular shirt on me"
3.0,WOULD BE COOLER WITH 5 STARS IF ONLY THEY DIDNT COME CROOKED. I ORDERED IT TWICE HOPING THEY’D FIT OK. THE SECOND PAIR I GOT FIT BETTER BUT STILL SLIGHTLY CROOKED. GOT ME THINKING MY HEAD WASN’T STRAIGHT. BUT A THIRD PAIR OF A DIFFERENT TYPE FIT FINE.
3.0,I bought this necklace to go with a dress i had ordered and it was beautiful. I love it.
3.0,I love the texture and cut but these are too large .  Need to exchange for a small.
3.0,This dress was really cute. I got a large and I’m an 8-10 it fit like a 7/10. But it was wayyyyy to short and I’m 5’5. I had to cut it into a top and pretty much wasted my money. Would be great for really short girls!
3.0,Fit small so had to return for next size up.
3.0,They are beautiful just a lil too big
3.0,"Just like the other reviews said, the jacket doesn't have NASA anywhere like in the pic. That's false advertising. Otherwise it fits well but no hand pockets. But for the discounted price it's acceptable and I'll just apply my own patches I bought elsewhere."
3.0,"The colors were fantastic but the fabric is not as stretchy as I had hoped.  They were large everywhere/decent fit, except the upper thighs, and that just resulted in me having to constantly pull them up...it wouldn't have been as much of an issue if i was mostly sedentary, but I was needing to move efficiently through the forest."
3.0,"I ordered these a size larger, but really I should have only ordered a half size larger. They weren't as small as people in the comments section indicated.<br /><br />They are cute though!"
3.0,"I bought this dress for a wedding and I'm not sure if I will wear it.  I got a medium and I am 5'5, 125 pounds.  I should have gotten the small because I don't feel like the dress is snug enough, especially up top.  The quality is very nice, I just wish it fit a bit better, if I had more time I would have it taken in."
3.0,"I love this dress, the arms were a bit snug but overall it’s okay"
3.0,I was excited when I opened the box because this watch is so pretty. I was also pleased because I bought mine as a used product and it was in pristine condition (the plastic it's wrapped in was still on). Then I tried to put it on. I have rheumatoid arthritis and it was impossible for me to clasp. I think it would be a challenge for anyone?? I even tried to attach it while not on my wrist and could not get it to clasp. Quite possibly it was returned already because the person who got it first found it not to clasp as well. I'm hoping it's just this particular one that had an issue and not all of them.
3.0,"These shoes are cute but way way too big.  I have wide feet and usually buy a 1/2 size to size up.  I read the reviews and ordered a 1/2 smaller and they are still a full size too big.  If you are an 8, order a 7.  If you have narrow or average feet, I don't recommend these, definitely for people with wide feet."
3.0,"Product is so inpressive when you very first get it. But after a couple months, the finish wears off and it looks super old. Purchased almost a year ago and is holding together great! But looks like it has had a rough life after only the first 2 months or so. But for money I am not upset."
3.0,"Good quality socks, but not plus-sized as advertised. I couldn’t wear them over the knee if I valued blood flow to my legs, and I wouldn’t consider myself a big person so buyer beware."
3.0,They work well for a few months before the grip stops gripping. They also need to be 2 inches longer because I'm tall and they are not long enough (even after adjusting to max)
3.0,It had a broken clasp when I received it! Very disappointed! I was left without a much sought after gift.
3.0,"The mask fit a kid's face very well however, the features are disproportionate.  The nose is obnoxiously big.  Listen, I know Mario has a big nose, but its outrageous when its placed on a normal size head.  The proportions of this mask can be scaled down by 50%.  If you want Mario's mouth to be where your kid's chin is, this is the mask for you."
3.0,These glasses are well made with good lenses but don't seem to be polarized. They come with a test polar strip that work with other sun glasses but not these.  It doesn't make since that they would send a test strip and the glasses not be polarized.
3.0,Manufacturing of the socks is somewhat inconsistent. Durability no where near as high as merino wool socks.
3.0,"They fit perfect but the materials are cheap. For instance, the clasp can easily be broken or bent and the wire/string used for the necklace serves it purpose, however, isn’t if a good sturdy material. I would say these are better for teens although fits an adults neck perfectly.<br />Thank me later."
3.0,"These are very small.  Keep that in mind before ordering!  Colors are pretty.  I ordered the navy, dark pink set."
3.0,Cute for price.. cheaply made!
3.0,I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING LOOSE FITTED KINDA LIKE THE PICTURE BUT ITS NOT...THE MATERIAL IM NOT A FAN OF BUT IT STILL LOOKS CUTE..
3.0,"This fit the computer and uses just right. The problem that we had with it is that after 6 weeks of use, the nylon connection that held the ring for the strap frayed and broke. It had received light use to that point. Still works for handle carry, but the shoulder strap in of no use now."
3.0,"I really wanted to like this but it was too small for me and I'm a petite person! For reference, I'm a 32A, size 0, 113lbs. I think my torso is too long for this so it was riding up places that was not so comfortable. Even with the straps fully down, it was still to small."
3.0,"And I am short.  Very cute and made well,  but about hip length.  And I am exactly five feet tall!"
3.0,The color is extremely vibrant. Perfect for lake swimming but the material is not the best quality and is not supportive. It does run a little small.
3.0,It’s kind of reduced for a M size
3.0,"The wallet is the perfect size.  The inside card slots are a different sort of material, almost cardboard like, but the cards slide in and out well.  The clear pouch for ID, also is easy to access.  The zipper is secure."
3.0,"I ordered red top, was kind of orange color. But still like It.  Arrived just as said it would. Happy with item.  Would order again from this seller."
3.0,"The cuffs are a little tight on my big calves.  If you are a lady with large calves, I'd recommend finding some other socks with a bit more stretch.  If you have normal sized calves, these will probable be just fine for you!  They are on the thin side, but sometimes that can be a good thing."
3.0,It's beautiful but it broke the first time I wore it
3.0,"I bought this for my son for when I have to drop him off in the mornings. It came sooner than I expected and I had high hopes for it. The material was soft and warm especially for the cold winter mornings. Unfortunately when I opened the package and inspected it, I realized that it was stained (as you can see in the pictures) I’ll continue to use it, as it’s very warm, but I am disappointed that I received it in that condition."
3.0,I have only had this wallet for 9 months.  I am disappointed that it has not held up very well.
3.0,"Super cute sweatshirt! I am normally a size small/medium. Based on other reviews, I ordered a medium and had plenty of room to spare. I think it runs a little big. I was very disappointed to notice a defect in the string right away. I'm still deciding what to do as I'm not sure I want to mess with a return."
3.0,Super cheap. Fast shipping. Stitching on v neck is off center.
3.0,The chain was smaller than expected.
3.0,"Some of the rings are very small, so they don’t all fit on my fingers. The ones that did were nice. A couple left green rings after wearing them for a day. Other than that they’re cute"
3.0,"It looks just its picture, I just wish it were bigger, but I am keeping it and wearing it with my casual nautical outfits.  It's nice when I just want something simple on my wrist. A great buy for the price."
3.0,It’s way too big and looks ridiculous
3.0,Slippers have great arch support and are very comfortable. My disappointment is the stitching is already coming apart.
3.0,"On the whole these aren't too bad,the fabric feels pretty soft and they fit really well. My only issue was the cut as they're baggier than I'm used too ; I'd  say they're closer to a slim/straight leg. They also felt longer than I was expecting and are too wide to roll, it's a shame really as I like the pattern of the fabric. If I could I'd have the legs made skinnier but that would probably cost more than the pants."
3.0,These boots look great but be careful. The zipper scratched my daughter's leg several times throughout the school day.
3.0,"I really liked the look of this shoe when it arrived.  However, I have narrow feet and this was way too large for my foot.  Construction of the shoe was exactly like the photo.  If the shoe had fit I believe it would have been extremely comfortable as most Birkenstocks are."
3.0,"love the necklace & considering how cheap it is, it's super cute"
3.0,Nice. Very nice
3.0,"The bracelet is oval, not round. Never in my life have I seen a bracelet that isn't round. O can get it on my wrist and wear it, it just has to stay on the lower part of my wrist. For $3 I can't complain. I wouldn't pay more for it though."
3.0,"Shoes arrived in a timely manner. The green sheen to the black was too much for me, as was the staggering height of the heel."
3.0,They're cute but the back leaves blisters on my daughters feet even with socks. She can't wear them.
3.0,"For some reason, I did not like  the way they looked on me.  Kinda looked cheap."
3.0,Probably cute if you’re very slender.
3.0,Home wear
3.0,"My 4 year old loved these and wore them quite often, unfortunately they broke within a month of getting them. If your looking for shoes for vacation or that you don't mind getting worn out quickly, these are a decent option"
3.0,"Cute for a kids toys, but quality is not there. The wand is the worst. Cheap plastic, doesn’t even really look like a wand just a very cheaply made plastic stick is more like it. The glasses are also cheap plastic, no lenses, but kinda cute. The scarf and the tie however are cute and a much better quality. The tattoos are cool in theory, but are too big and red to be realistic. Overall, it’s ok for kid and my daughter does like it."
3.0,Fine if you have to use them for easy assistance with birthing. But will rip during a difficult birth assistance.
3.0,"I was pleasantly surprised when opening the Fidelo to the quality of its contents.  The materials looked and felt premium and was packed quite nicely.  I ultimately decided to return this wallet because it doesn’t work well for my work environment.  I noticed that the cards would slide out partially during the day while moving around and I had to constantly push them back in.  That led to the cards getting pretty dirty in my pocket (I work a fast paced job around a lot of dirt and box dust).  I also noticed the finish of the front plate began to discolor after only 3 days, perhaps due to rubbing against other objects in my pocket.  I’m going to try one of the other brands that secure the cards a little more, but if you don’t have such a fast paced life style it may serve its purpose well."
3.0,stiff  with one sandal's toe holder severely bent
3.0,This cover up is very cute but it runs very small around the hip area. The shipping was very fast but you may want to buy 2 sizes up.
3.0,Would have liked the length longer.
3.0,"So I like it. I'm usually a medium and I ordered a large. It fits like a medium. The hips do poke out, so if you're insecure of your hips- pass. The material is super soft and comfy. Great for lounging or catching a flight. Seems well made to me and a great price."
3.0,"If fit as expected, my husband uses it for when he works out and is happy with it"
3.0,It's OK. Deteriorates quickly and easily.
3.0,"I was ecstatic when my watch arrived today. I had been debating buying it for weeks and had finally convinced myself that i needed it. When it finally came, I put it on snug and then went about my day. I received many compliments on it, and i dare say it made me feel cool. It was beautiful and it fit my personal aesthetic.<br /><br />However, towards the end of the day, as I was leaving a building, someone came up behind me with my watch in their hand. It had fallen off. The small stick (i guess would be the word) attached to the watch that the strap loops over had fallen off, just like that. It was pretty disappointing, considering how much anticipation I had leading up to getting it. It didn't last 6 hours before literally breaking off. I guess at under 4$ you get what you pay for. But jeez man it didn't last a day before having to go to a shop and buy a replacement strap"
3.0,"The fabric was nice and the color pink was also nice.  I did not like the way it hung, but my sister sure did so she wears it now."
3.0,"The color is beautiful and i really wanted to love this dress, but it fell just short of what it was aiming for."
3.0,"I bought the all black version of this AR5886 and this watch is very big. It's definitely a nice watch but not a watch you want to buy if it's going to be your daily watch because you will have issues with it's size when you wear long sleeve clothing.Buying this for fashion purpose might be the most recommended. The watch is stunning but it turned out to be just way too big for me. If you like big watches, this watch is the one for you!"
3.0,"UPDATE: I reordered these for the third time Sept 2021. They are significantly larger than 1.5 millimeter that I have always gotten from this company, plus they seem to tarnish very quickly. I'm changing to stainless steel.<br /><br />These last forever! This is my second order. My first order was 8 years ago! They are the perfect diameter for me. Tiny & super sparkly. After I apply makeup, I dip a q-tip in alcohol and dab the stone. Makeup is all gone & I'm back to workout!"
3.0,"Not everyone has a small behind. I dont understand why the top fits and the bottom is always too tight. and no, I am not pear shaped."
3.0,"I was so happy to order these aprons and chef hats for the grandchildren coming to decorate gingerbread<br />houses.  Here are two disappointing things to note.  When the children get icing on themselves they will tend to wipe their hands on the aprons.  Well the aprons are made of a material that is slippery and may cause the icing not to adhere to the apron. The other thing is the hats, although cute are not the chef (bakers hats) shown in the pictures. It is a different hat all together.  I do not want to say false advertising but what do you think?<br />Happy Baking Children."
3.0,"They are hard to close.  otherwise, okay."
3.0,Material is not comfortable to wear. Feels like crape paper.
3.0,"Its great if u like snow white color. I thought it would be more off white, like pictured."
3.0,It is very pretty but too small so I had to return.
3.0,"Ok I will start with the obvious!! This was a great price. For the price it is a nice ring. I was looking for a small accent ring that matches my other rings. it the pictures it looks like a small turquoise stone that is surrounded by leaves. The stone i such bigger then it appears and it sticks up way above the setting . The stone also looks cheap and it’s awkwardly places in the setting. The leaves that surround the stone looks nice. They actually look well done and much prettier then the stone. I do like this ring but it’s not exactly what I was hoping for. Overall it’s worth it. however, if you’re looking for a small accent ring. This ring is too big for that."
3.0,The item description was for 16 rings. I only received 11. Seems like someone took the prettier ones before the package was shipped.
3.0,These actually have like an olive green frame. You can't really see it in the pics in the advertisement.  The fit is okay and they seem meh.  I wouldn't have bought these if I could have tried them on and seen them in person.
3.0,"Great idea, but doesn't work as well as I hoped. Kind of a pain to put on. Maybe with practice it'll be better. Definitely takes time!"
3.0,"I was really hoping to wear a simple sweater dress to my works holiday party but it was too short! I got a 2XL and I am 5'5"" tall and weigh 190lbs  the dress is an Inch from exposing my bottom so I will have to alter it and add some fabric to extend the dress. the fabric feels pretty cheap as well but other than that the dress is ok."
3.0,"I love the pattern of this shirt, but the sleeves seem a bit too long and I didn't realize it is hand wash only. I probably would have ordered it if I had know it was hand wash only."
3.0,Nice material and style.  It was a little shorter than I like to wear.
3.0,"Didn’t work for me. It would be nice for someone who plans to wear it alone, without a top over it. If you do want to wear a shirt over this thing, there will be pronounced lines all over the place, but especially down the bust. There are also awkward pads in the cups that feel a bit like plastic packing foam, not sure how well that would fair in the wash."
3.0,"As it was $38.00 watch from Amazon, it feels that cheap when you start using it, especially the band.<br /><br />No easy band length adjustments, you need to remove the elements with precision tools and no easy link remover option. Second week into the use, the band buckle security lock is damaged.<br /><br />Chronograph letters are tiny, but watch case look good."
3.0,Shrunk after one wash in cold water and hung dry. The sides billow and don’t align flush with my face.
3.0,Used to buy this sweater but now it’s made different. Disappointed!
3.0,Way too small for advertised.
3.0,The dress roped on side 1st  time I word it. And the apron just fell apart. Wish I could find out how to get ahold of the company. For the price of $170. I would expect a lot better put together out fit.
3.0,"This is a really pretty wallet but since I have been using it for a few weeks, the latch keeps sticking. You have to jiggle it to get it to close. For a price tag of $99.00 you would think there would not be a problem. It matches my purse so I'm keeping it but please be aware if you are going to purchase one."
3.0,"Arrived quickly and intact. Looks nice but haven't hooked 'em up yet to our luggage so no comment yet on the wear and tear. Material seems durable, very flexible and bright enough to distinguish your luggage from all the other luggage's that spew out of any airport baggage claim carousel. Will update star rating when it's gone thru several journeys but for now cautiously 3 stars."
3.0,I love the color scheme but I ordered my true size and it feels a bit too tight.. I would suggest the next size up for comfort
3.0,"Probably does fit true to size, however it's pretty form fitting. Not super flattering if you are a bigger girl with rolls. 😉<br />Very cute shirt though, not cotton, but more of a poly blend."
3.0,Good for the price. Was not so well finished but good buy!
3.0,"The cut for sleeve was just right for me (5'2&#34; - size 8 petite).  However, there is a tremendous amount of material and I was swimming in the dress.  Cute cut, but needs to be trimmed back so that you don't look fat."
3.0,I love the dress but I didn't like how the pockets stood out I send it back already.
3.0,"This bathing suit is so beautiful and well made; however, being a small chested girl (36A), it slips down any time I raise my arms over my head. As a result, I don’t feel confident wearing it. I got a size medium as I have a larger bottom half. The bottom fits me perfectly, but the straps going around the neck are way too long. I wish it were adjustable for those of us who are two different sizes."
3.0,"Material was wonderful, thick and soft.  But the sweater fit too tight.  If I wanted an underpinning, this could have worked.  But I wanted a sweater and I even ordered a larger size than I usually do.  I had to return it sadly.  It's unfortunate because the fabric and texture are an excellent buy"
3.0,"This cardigan fit like I expected but I just wasn't thrilled with the color so I ended up returning it and keeping the version I bought from ECHOWISH(?), it was just a bit brighter than this one. The material is very silky and soft, but be aware the fabric is not printed on the inside (it is just white) if that happens to bother you."
3.0,"didnt expect real gold, but it looks like it came from a .50 cent machine, so i instead gave it to my daughter for costume jewelry. maybe the silver one looks better."
3.0,Material is very THINNNNN doesnt look like pic at all. Very disappointed.
3.0,I loved the design of this band but just a warning for people who have sensitive skin or allergies. Something in this band caused a really bad allergic reaction to breakout on my wrist that I was wearing the band on. I’m not sure what I’m allergic to in it because I’ve never had the issue before. Other than that the band is lovely.
3.0,"The blazer is very cute and adds flare and flavor to any ordinary piece, but its flimsy and feels very cheap. I gave it 3 stars because you get what you pay for. Dont be of the impression that you are getting a steal with this item. You aren't! If you keep in mind it's a product under $30 meant for your body then the shock of the material and quality will be minimal.Happy Wearing, if you dare!"
3.0,I love this ankle bracelet. I gave it 3 stars because it breaks easily. I have ordered 3 of them and I have lost all 3 of them. It is very beautiful though.
3.0,"All but the finest (we're talking extra fine) nibs bleed through. It doesn't get onto the next page, but it makes the other side of the page you wrote on pretty much unusable. That takes away a big chunk of the enjoyment of writing for me."
3.0,I ordered  a different colors. I like colorful socks and ordered them but got 3 black pair and 3 grey with tiny hearts. Price is great and they don’t fit. They are more for children’s size people. They go half way up my calf and cut off my circulation.
3.0,"I cannot speak to size and fit because the image was blurry, looked cheap, and not cute at all so I didn’t even try it on. It even looks better in the photo i took than it does with the actual eye. Very disappointed."
3.0,Pretty tights but too small. Ripped the first time they were worn.
3.0,"I love the color and I'll keep,  but it's not roomy like a robe should be, and the flannel is quite lightweight."
3.0,Says for men or women but strap almost too short for men.
3.0,"I loved the way this suit looked but the bust area fit was not for me. I am 5'8&#34; and wear a 34 DDD bra. I ordered a size large according to the measurement chart. The bust area was too large but the bottom portion fit fine. I had to return the suit due to there being NO additional support in the bra area. Unless your breast are firm and do not require support to stay lifted, then this is not the suit for you."
3.0,"Rich brown color which is perfect for fall.  However, it was too much material for my liking and just didn't fall right on me.  The seam across the chest hit at the middle of my chest instead of below which was unflattering.  I'm 5'5, 122 lbs. and ordered a small."
3.0,"So cute, very pretty, but no phone made in the last few years is going in that thing. It's pretty much child-sized. I can't see anything going in there besides a credit card, ID, and maybe a lipstick.<br />Too bad because the design is pretty."
3.0,"The earrings are smaller than I expected, but not too small that I would return them. A definite drawback is that the posts are shorter than what you'd typically find on an earring. As a person with thick lobes it's kind of concerning but again not enough to send back because what I care about is the metal; I also have very sensitive skin and decided to switch to these from irritating sterling silver. They look great in my third lobe piercings so I will be keeping them. But as a note to the seller, there should be photos up of what the earrings look like on so potential customers have a better idea of what to expect."
3.0,"These were quite too small and rode up a lot, they seemed like they could be good but in the end I had to return them for misfit."
3.0,Nice product for the price but the lenses seemed a little scratched out of the box. The case was good quality.
3.0,"I was surprised at how weak the silver bracelet part is and am worried it will break if I wear it a lot. I thought about returning it because of this weakness, but decided that I would keep it as I do like the style.<br /><br />The bracelet is very pretty."
3.0,"Quality of product is great, but fit is slightly tight in comparison to same size from Ariat or Cinch vests I’ve owned. If a large is typically baggy, buy it as these run snug and make fitting a sweatshirt under it turn into a Michelin Man commercial."
3.0,I mostly got this pack for the leaf looking nose ring however it’s so small it’s kinda uncomfortable when you don’t get it set in the right place. It’s supper cute and shiny but wish it was a bit bigger.
3.0,"This is not truly a 1x, it’s a regular XL"
3.0,Cheap quality…. Cheap price
3.0,They were really really bueatiful but to heavy for my ears.
3.0,"Perfect fit for my rather difficult face, but the color of the frame not as light as shown in the photograph. I am a brunette so the golden tones are still flattering. The price was good too."
3.0,"Cute sweater, I'm 5 2&#34; so I can wear it either as a sweater or a tunic. The quality could be much better. It's your typical Chinese quality, but the price is really good so I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,"I purchased this item as a gift. The garments are well-made, fit well, and are quite beautiful. Definitely worth the money. My rating is based on the fact that it arrived in clear wrapping with no actual packaging. I'm all for minimal packaging, but this is not sufficient. The clear wrapper does not conceal the contents, making it obvious to a would-be thief what's inside. And I do not believe it would protect against the elements if the weather were wet. This is something the shipper needs to remedy asap."
3.0,The dress is made of very thin/sheer material.  I wasn’t comfortable in it.
3.0,Awesome dress but fits very form fitting and that's not how they wore dresses in the 20s. So I had to order a new dress for the occasion. GREAT QUALITY THOUGH!
3.0,"I love the suit. It was a nice quality. The leg warmers and the wings were too small. They looked as if they were for children. And, the wings should have had velcro on it. It would have fit then."
3.0,"The fit was a little big but okay ,however the slippery surface made exterior clothing have static cling but also sliding around and look ill fitting"
3.0,Very comfortable and looks great. Perfect for work.
3.0,Did not hold up very well. Clamp broke on the first use and rendered the stirrup useless.
3.0,These look as described but I don't care for the leverback hook. They are difficult to insert and seem very insecure. A fishhook would be a huge improvement in an otherwise good product.
3.0,It’s okay. It was inexpensive so I wasn’t expecting it to be top of the line or anything but I have bought many inexpensive outfits here that surprise me with their quality.
3.0,"My only issue to date is that one of the lacing hooks came off which is significant in that I have only had the boots for a short period of time and I don't put a lot of stress on them aside from walking a lot. Other than that, they are reasonably comfortable and holding up well."
3.0,Beautiful ring but the stone is more pink than red so that was a disappointment.
3.0,Definitely runs really small....
3.0,This Jumper is super cute and thin. Perfect for a hot day. I ordered a large. As others have stated the top is a little revealing I wore with a lace Cami.<br />Now to the negatives... It's very cheap only wore one time! By the in of the evening I had a hole in my crotch and one strap had popped.
3.0,The belt is nice. What I don't like about it is the fact that the clasp or hook is small/ short it comes loose when you make sudden movements.
3.0,I item runs small
3.0,"It is very nice but, it broke had broke on the second day."
3.0,It is okay at everything but not great at one thing.
3.0,material smells like gas
3.0,not made for someone with curves
3.0,The gold is definitely not 14k plated as I thought. There ok.
3.0,It was tighter then it should be
3.0,"I ordered the charcoal grey pair before these and LOVED them. Several months later I decided I needed a black pair as well. They fit great and were once again perfect UNTIL… they began unraveling at the waist. I only had them a few months and washed and dried according to instructions. The grey pair I bought still held up nicely while the black pair have been slowly deteriorating. There are strings everywhere and I’m constantly tucking the strings back into my waistline. Wish these held up with more consistent quality, however I’m not confident in buying more as I don’t want to buy another pair that falls apart."
3.0,Material was soft wanted something a little longer in the sleeve was ok.
3.0,"the necklace is lovely and my teen daughter loved it. however the insert card was NOT the one shown, it was more of relationship quote vs the mother/daughter quote. I wasn’t able to contact the seller. other than that - it is a lovely necklace"
3.0,"My biggest complaint is that I always want the front main pockets to be loose & not sewed to the leg, that way when you come in the house & sit in your recliner & go back every thing doesn't slide out of your pockets because you can slip them either back or forward & nothing will spill !!"
3.0,"This jacket is just ok.  For the price, can't complain."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this top. The lace is pretty and the material was light and soft. I also like that the straps are adjustable. However it did not flatter my figure at all and felt a bit cheap. It would definitely need to be worn with a strapless nude bra since it is pretty see through. It was a bit too wide up top and too short in the back for my torso. I am 5’8”, 125lbs and ordered a small. If I was a bit shorter I would keep it and wear it under a cute blazer or cardigan, but since it is too short I will be returning."
3.0,It lays like a maternity outfit. The stretchy section is too small for a regular fit.
3.0,"Tight in the chest, I’m a 36D"
3.0,It does run a bit bigger due to the material type.
3.0,Run small<br />2x feels like a large
3.0,"It's a pretty dress, and I'm going to keep it, but not the fabric I was expecting. It seems more parachute-like and stuff and definitely wouldn't stretch. I bought white in an XL so size up. And you'd also need a slip because that thin parachute material is see-through. But it is cute and it fits, so I can't complain too much!"
3.0,the front and back are indistinguishable. The neck line is lower than I expected and it slides off the shoulders. Nice soft fabric and beautiful colors.
3.0,So I saw a pic of what it really looks like and I mean yeah it's a scam but kinda cute I don't like that it's a stolen design though:/
3.0,These seem fine for about 1 wear. If you snag or rip them at all they will run literally all the way down.
3.0,Very cute but way too small.  I ordered an 8 for my 7 year old and she could hardly get it on.  The torso is really short.  I would order a size up.
3.0,It looks like the pic just small and nothing glamorous
3.0,Brought it for work it worked out just fine
3.0,I don’t expect these to last long but they are lightweight because of the material quality. It's comfortable but the length runs small. It has shallow (not deep enough) side pockets.
3.0,"I love these, but I only recieved 11 pairs??? Very confused."
3.0,"Bought for my boyfriend. He loved it, but it broke soon after he had it"
3.0,"received 2 different colors-1 came in light blue,another darker. returned it"
3.0,A little small and very short. You will definitely need leggings or shorts underneath.
3.0,"I ordered a XL and thus did not bot size up. The fit is perfect and the elastic straps to do smosh my breasts. The color is nice but seeing as the shirt is rediculacely short I do wish I had bought black rather then green. Also light blue and green , not the same thing.<br />I am 5.3 and The shirt doesn't even fall below my but and I won't be able to wear it without leggings. I suggest getting a color that looks well with whatever leggings you own. I shall be keeping it though as I can always die the fabric and lengthen it."
3.0,it just fit oddly on.
3.0,I love the necklace but had to put 3 stars cuz it literally broke on the ring part of the clasp when I went to clasp it on. Luckily I was able to put it back together and just use pliers to put the metal ring back on the clasp cuz it was opened. Otherwise I would have did a return and I really liked this necklace.  I just advise you check the clasp part to make sure it isn’t going to fall off while your wearing it.
3.0,"Cheap material, after the wrinkles came out it looks cute, needs to be washed carefully as I am already seeing tiny holes at the seams."
3.0,Super cute but much thinner than I expected and not warm enough to be a winter coat
3.0,"Everything else about this dress is fine: color, comfort, etc. But fabric is thin and therefore wrinkly. Who wants to iron a knit dress every single time. Not I."
3.0,"Looks like faux shearling, but it feels almost like carpet in-person. Very strange fabric used on the outer layer."
3.0,Wayyy to small for an 9 year old fits small children
3.0,Did not like the price
3.0,"I love that they are so shiny and don't hurt my ears. They aren't comfortable to sleep in though. But I wasn't happy that the backs of the earrings kept coming off. I lost one back, so I'm going to have to buy a new one."
3.0,It's super nice but I'm having to replace it already because the plastic case is broken. I'm also kind of hard on my phones but I had hoped it lasted longer.
3.0,Cute but runs small you might want to order a size bigger. I'm going to keep but will be giving it to my daughter.
3.0,these are super cute! they are just really thin. you could bend them into another shape with the smallest amount of pressure.
3.0,I bought it extra big to work out in. I love the fabric and especially the length but it ran extremely small.
3.0,"I first ordered the navy floral one. I really love this style romper that i bought another one. I ordered what i though was gray and it says gray, but when it came, it was the same color as the navy one. So I’m pretty disappointed with that 😞"
3.0,Nice but not what I expected.  Thought it would be more of a unit instead of two sepRate pieces. Very basic.
3.0,"While the slipper is well made and good looking, they run rather small.  Definitely recommend choosing the next size up."
3.0,Couldn't fit my large head. Avoid if you have a large head.
3.0,"I only gave it one star because it fit me. Since my baby gas sensitive skin, I have to wash all of my clothes before I let him near me. After the FIRST AND ONLY wash the bottom seam came off and the camisole was ruined. The material construction is very poor quality.<br /><br />Update:<br />The seller has contacted me regarding my purchase and has offered me a full refund even though it was damaged.  They have great customer service."
3.0,"The glasses are fine, but two of the cases were broken when they arrived.  Not worth the trouble to send them back."
3.0,These are just ok for the price. I read many other reviews so I went with the XL to be safe. The material is not cut the best in lengths. One of my right shoulder is slightly longer than the other.  I was willing to move past that but then I got 2 shirts the same color purple!  That’s not what I ordered. I can’t wear the same color two days in a row. lol very disappointed.  The pink shirt is ok but is slightly see through. If you purchase these I would suggest an undershirt.
3.0,Not really matching the picture. The sleeves are 3/4 and the shirt fits wierd. Ill wear it..but it wasnt what was advertised.
3.0,"Bought them for my son on Sept. 20, 2008, paid $18.98.  Nice looking shoe, I love the colors, great for wide feet, and what soft genuine leather, which is why it's easily scuffed...some of the color is scratched away at the toes.  Mainly because he was still crawling at the time, but still you could scrape it with your nail and it would get scuffed!  The tongue also comes stitched to the shoe for some reason and you could nick the leather trying to remove it, which I did, if you're not careful (man did they stitch that good!)  My son didn't use them much because it was soon too cold to wear shoes and he outgrew it.  I would buy these again if they had his size and they were back to $18.98 or cheaper, since he's walking now, they will still get scuffed, but maybe not as much.  I just love the style and color!  They lost 2 stars, one for the easily scuffed part and one for the tongue being stitched to the shoe too well!!"
3.0,"These are nice but unless you order it smaller than you usually wear, there’s not a lot of compression going on. It’s just a polyester tank top."
3.0,"My 5 year old loves Trevor Henderson's creatures. No idea why. But he really wanted this. And it fits him, but he is small and skinny. I cant image it working for others. Its super long. We had to tailor it to fit his height. I would hope they sew it a bit wider for others."
3.0,these are ok. not for long walks or hikes. more of a water shoe.
3.0,"It’s not as brown as the first couple pictures. More of a light tan like the last couple. It’s just a thin T-shirt, nothing great. It’s cute but don’t love it as much as I wanted to."
3.0,I've been wanting a pocket watch for a long time so finally opted for this one.<br />When it arrives was disappointed that the chain was not connected to the watch. Also there was no gift box.the watch is fine but now I have to get.a chain.<br />So a little disappointed.
3.0,"Received my ring, first, it wasn't as shiney as it appears on the website, second, I ordered a size 7 and received a size 6.5, band doesn't seem as sturdy as I'd like. Did not send back for the correct size (only paid a little over $4.00 for the ring),it would cost more to return, so keeping, hoping I will have someone to give it too. Sure this is a good vendor, but, I won't purchase from them again."
3.0,"The overall design is cute and the fabric is soft.  However mine is badly sewn, making it wrinkle and poke outward at the side.  It had deodorant marks on it when it arrived, so I wonder if someone returned it before me.  I will probably return it.<br /><br />I'm a flat 32B 5'9.5&#34; 125 lbs and small seems like the right size.  It would be more flattering on someone with bigger boobs.  The back looks like I'm getting hints of back rolls despite me being thin, so I wouldn't want it smaller."
3.0,"It's true, the design on it is terribly pixel ed. It looks silly. Plus, it's not cotton.....it's very polyester feeling. Not sure what the description said, but It didn't feel very summery."
3.0,It just looks like a piece of material that has holes cut out for arms and head
3.0,"I like the design, and it fits well. The material was unexpected though, feels a little like the cheap polyester material used for Halloween costumes. That being said, it's still decent for the price."
3.0,"it was a good watch but the watch broke in 1 month, it was great for school and going out with family, i would defenetly buy this again."
3.0,"Beautiful, but they broke the second time I wore them."
3.0,Bought this pack of gloves as backup for when my kids lose their 'good' pairs. Covers their hands but arent very thick or warm.
3.0,"It's the only fitted hat I've found, so I ordered it.  I don't like the synthetic material.  The sewing quality is average.  It won't fit what I want, but for an inexpensive fitted hat, it's not bad.  I doubt it will hold up for long.  Order one size smaller and it should work."
3.0,"It's really cute, but it's very small for my daughter. She's supposed to wear it for her birthday. It's more for babies."
3.0,Disappointed in two things:  quality of yarn used not likely to hold up very long and the knitting is quite loose. Not likely to purchase again.
3.0,"It was cute, but when I got the bathing suit it looked more like orange and black. Also it was way to tight on me. I should of got a size or 2 up."
3.0,Too small on the top. The part that drapes over your breast does some weird fitting when you have larger breast.
3.0,"I really love the earring cuffs. they are very pretty, but they wear out after about a week. They need to be made more sturdy."
3.0,Smaller than appear in photo
3.0,"I have ordered 3 of these dresses now, 2 solids & 1 striped. The striped is a stiff cotton where other 2 are soft & flowy Rayon. Plus it seems to be a couple inches shorter than others."
3.0,Goggles fog
3.0,To say that these would fit a L to a 3X is really pushing it.  I am typically a 2X in a legging/capris and I can't get these to my hips.  Unstretched they measure 28&#34; around.  Stretched it's pushing it to get them to 40&#34;.  So I'd give them a 36&#34;-38&#34;.  So I would not call these a plus size at all.  The material is polyester so they would be great for working out.  So know that before you buy these that they do run small.  These leggings were provided to me for evaluation and without any further obligation.
3.0,"I ordered the round tassel earrings in khaki thinking they would be a light brown with gold accents. the fringe in not khaki at all, the entire earring is gold. The lack of color contrast makes the earrings look cheap. The color ""khaki"" should really be changed to ""gold"", as it is misleading. Also, the earring is a little heavier than I was expecting. It is not unbearable, but it definitely makes my ear lobes sag a bit."
3.0,"Look nice, it is kind of really small. The bracelet os really cheap. For the price would not expect a Rolex but I bought watcjes at this price range and were really good. But Casio went really toooo cheap on this one feels like it is going to snap at any moment. It is just nostalgy......but ...disapointing."
3.0,"Every shirt in my son's closet is an extra large boys. I ordered this shirt in the same size, and it's more like a medium adult.  Now I just need to figure out how to return it for a smaller size."
3.0,Love the necklace. Only problem is it lost a Jewel after just one wear 😞
3.0,"The belt is good looking and the fit is right.  Buckle is heavy enough.  Not sure how long it's lifespan will be, feels a little too soft as I prefer a stiffer leather that I can break in.  But it's perfectly serviceable and great to have as an extra."
3.0,Not fancy but functional. Just needed a cheap watch for a short time and it served its purpose. There has been no issues with it its just a plain simple watch.
3.0,"It works ok, but is cheaply made.  More importantly, there is a WARNING LABEL on the front of the case that says that &#34;Some Materials in this Item are Dangerous & Have Been Linked to Illness.&#34;.  What in the world???  No thank you!"
3.0,Doesn't latch closed well as it only has a small pin on the back of the buckle.
3.0,The product as received was damaged and missing the house charm. I had no issues returning the product. The product did seem to be well made and I wish the charm had not been missing .
3.0,Very boxy and a large neck opening
3.0,"more of a solid color, and not as thin as the fabric in the photo. this is just a regular crewneck."
3.0,"The hands are of good quality, however they didn’t  Fit. Much to small. Couldn’t get them on. Would be good for someone with small hands."
3.0,36/28/38 32DDD 150lb.  I got a medium and its too snug.  I think I will just return it.
3.0,Wife likes it. Skulls are upside down on the back.
3.0,I feel very tight .
3.0,"The hat I received was of very good quality, however, it was the wrong one."
3.0,"I love the mask. Great details,  but came out a bit larger than I thought it was."
3.0,The suit was cute but too small. I would recommend one size up from what you are
3.0,Nice fitted and thin enough for a nice summer dinner outside with a bolero.
3.0,When I received the product the top of the liner inside the case had separated from the case itself...apparently it had been poorly glued.  I easily corrected it with some small glue adhesives and haven’t had a problem since.  This case can be tough to open easily as it tends to be hard to grip and closes tightly.  Due to that fact though you don’t have to worry that something will scratch your glasses if you need to toss them into your bag and go.  It’s a cute case and looks just as pictured but for the price the quality wasn’t as expected.
3.0,"I like creative sunnies; Quay has some great designs. However, the quality was missing on these - the plastic was flimsy and they were uneven. I couldn't get them to sit straight on my face, so I returned them right away. Form can't trump function. The return was easy and I had no issues."
3.0,"I like this piece a lot. It looks very nice, but the fabric is not really comfortable. It's not uncomfortable, but just not really comfortable. Hope that makes sense."
3.0,"for the cost, just spend a few more bucks and get an express shirt on sale. the quality is crap on these shirt. I would buy it again for half the price.<br />the cut is also long under the armpits making it hard to lift up your arms without untucking the shirt. I have express, CK, etc, all slim fits and this is by far the worst one."
3.0,"5""8 180 pounds 32 inch waist bought large should've ordered medium<br />Too long and fits loose . Material is good"
3.0,"The overall look is ok, the biggest problem is that it is very sheer.  You need a strapless camisole underneath."
3.0,Top is awesome. Bottom is hideous! I am keeping it for the top and wearing a cute black bikini bottom with it!
3.0,Didn't like how the top part fit. The fit felt a little off to me.
3.0,"I am 5'3, 165 lbs and ordered a Large. The dress was beautiful (looks just like picture), hugged my body perfectly BUT it was too long and the arm part was too tight and had no stretch. Had red lines on my armpit/ arm area from only trying it on. Had to return it. :("
3.0,Pros: Cute colors and good price for wool socks.<br />Cons: Claim to fit up to size 12M. I wear an 8.5M and the tops are a little tight. My major disappointment is that the yarn is very coarse and loosely woven so they are not very smooth inside and are a little uncomfortable to wear if you need to do much walking.
3.0,"Only looks like the picture from a certain viewpoint, otherwise hard to see what it is."
3.0,poorly made.
3.0,I will send it back for medium
3.0,"They look really good be careful of hills it puts unnecessary stress on them, after a long night of trick or treating the strap broke I was sad because it was the first time I wore them for an extended period of time. I plan on ordering new straps it just sucks because I waited so long to get them. So definitely not for heavy use!"
3.0,"These do exactly as they are supposed to, no more no less."
3.0,Dress was actually purple instead of blue also the bow was in the middle of the neck and not on the side
3.0,Very pretty but very large for a medium!  The jewelry detail was nice as was the little necklace they sent so I kept it and will hope it shrinks a little!
3.0,Cute and comfy but the “burgundy” color is not at all like the picture it was traditional nude color wich was disappointing
3.0,"The dress is ok - the fabric is thick which makes it perfect for fall however it's kind of stiff. The dress does not flare like the picture at all, it hangs straight & boring. I wanted to love it - but am returning it."
3.0,I had my mom take it in to give a more flattering shape since it’s pretty loose. Unfortunately after the first wash the material started to look a bit worn. I do still like the print and have worn it more than once this summer.
3.0,Material feels great bu the size was off
3.0,The thickness of the socks make them very warm (which I wanted) but also make them hard to walk in.
3.0,Not as cute as the picture but it’s not terrible. I’ve had it a few years.
3.0,"They don't really improve my night vision while driving.<br />They are made sturdily, but I haven't worn them more than twice."
3.0,"After having a baby I decided to try this since it seems loose and flows. I’m between large and xl so I decided to order a large. It still seems big, if I ordered again, I would probably try a medium."
3.0,"It’s not bad quality, it just runs very small and it’s very short. It could just be me, I’m a 36 DD. It would probably work great for an A or a B cup, or someone that has a belly worth sporting...😀"
3.0,"Very disappointed i ordered 2x this more like a small , item is cute but sizing is off it has somewhat stretch but like a stiff stretch😞, was really looking forward to"
3.0,The material is not the greatest but it's a pretty shirt. I bought a small and It fits big.
3.0,Not sure why shoe size was not used. S M L is not a good indication for getting the right size
3.0,Hat is flimsy doesn't fit my pug to great.
3.0,Its too still
3.0,It would be nice if we could have gotten a smaller size.
3.0,Should be longer.  The bottom part is too tight.  I cut the sides.
3.0,Cute shirt but extremely small and has fairly strong chemical smell. Returned
3.0,"Very soft and comfortable I ordered a medium and fits great!  However, I ordered the wine red and gray...but received an orange and a black set!?!?"
3.0,"Socks are just like nylons, very easy to get runs."
3.0,"I thought these sweet pins were the answer to the vexing issue of gaping surplice tops and bodices. Unfortunately, I have lost nearly all the pearls. They pop off at the most inconvenient times: in church, going into meetings, etc. All the pearls are interchangeable, so I was able to use them for as long as I had at least two pearls. I'm down to one pearl, and I will not be replacing them. The pins are not very sharp, which means you have to really fight to get the pin through some fabrics and at seams. This is not easy task because you don't have anything to hang on to (the pearl will pop off if you try to use it for leverage, and the pin being angled means it just keeps turning the wrong direction the more you push it. I will not be buying these again. I will go back to using pretty lapel pins, tie tacks and brooches."
3.0,These leggings are so very thin that while they are comfortable there is no support. Waist band rolls while standing up  I’ll be returning
3.0,"Top is NOT true to size. Get one size up. Bottoms fit, but top didn’t. The white cups also show at the top."
3.0,Great color but runs small I ordered a extra large I'm a size 12 I clearly needed a 3x but couldn't find one so I cut it and just wore the top as a shirt it worked out great for me
3.0,Use better material
3.0,"Very see through, so it could work for a swimsuit Cover.  Also the front does not come up in the center very much like it is shown in the picture."
3.0,"The fabric feels like like plastic, all polyester. It was a cheap dress and for that the as price was understandable . Met my expectations and looked just like the picture."
3.0,"Nice product, but they seem to me to be tighter than expected, consider that when ordering"
3.0,"Liked the style and fabric. Did bit like the fit. Seems like it didn't bunch up perfectly in the waist. Also, quality wasn't that great. It was just ok so I returned it"
3.0,"Sexy underwear but rides a little too low.  Kept the fellows in place, however.  Good to sleep in if you like to sleep naked and don't want to leave skid marks."
3.0,Shoes were nice got true to size didn't come with the dog tag that when with the shoe
3.0,"Love the bottoms of these suits, but the tops are pretty large and sloppy; serious under boob peeking out. For the price, though, it's worth it to get the cute bottoms and match them with a different top."
3.0,I like it but it’s not the same colorful one I ordered. I ordered the colorful one but it’s thinner in the photos. This one is the regular one.
3.0,The scarf is very beautiful
3.0,I ordered based off other reviews. I'm a 36D chest. I got a size 12. My boobs were hanging out the side edges. Padding is removable. That didn't help. The cups were still to small. The bottom looked like granny panties. I am returning this suit.
3.0,Was so dirty.
3.0,The picture is a photoshopped exaggeration. Item is not as long as what is shown on the model's torso. The person that it was given to for wearing actually has a short torso.
3.0,I think this dress is adorable but I was not super impressed with the quality of the material. My strap also broke after wearing the dress only once. The strap broke while I was wearing the dress. I was able to easily sew it back on.
3.0,"Not high quality metal, the finish came off pretty quickly.<br />I had to replace the O-rings because they weren't the same strength as the chain. They twisted off very quickly.<br />Gave three stars as I don't care what the chain looks like but if you're looking for a quality item look elsewhere."
3.0,"Have ordered twice, I must be hard on this style because both of them broke.  Very pretty though"
3.0,I love their regular tights but the ones made of denim material I find too tight and uncomfortable.
3.0,I wear a size 18. I ordered a 3x hoping for a little room. And it won't close. But i have a dressi can wear under it. Or i may give it to my sister.
3.0,The coloring of these earring's are very pretty but a lot bigger than I had expected.<br />Not what I had expected but will do.
3.0,"this cube is entertaining, it is confusing to match the right edge sizes to the right centers, but is not a speed cube, it does not move easily, probably due to the various shapes."
3.0,"It's a pretty necklace and goes great with cardigans, however it tangles SO easily and when it does you're basically screwed unless you have a good 10 minutes to spend untangling it so only to have it rectangle as soon as you pick it up."
3.0,"I usually wear a  size 16w, but I wanted a pleated skirt so ordered this skirt in a size 18. Unfortunately, the waste band had no elastic and is too small. Also skirt too short. But it is well made."
3.0,"Uncomfortably thick and stiff, but strong and durable."
3.0,"If you are needing cheap earmuffs, the 4-pack is a good deal. They a quite warm and fairly comfortable. However, after wearing them for a little while they slowly start to slip down and expose the top of my ear, and the wire is then directly on my ear making it uncomfortable. I have a fairly “normal” sized head, but they might end up fitting someone else fine. Really wanted to keep them, but will be returning because the slipping is too annoying.<br />I have since bought a pair from Kedofe and they fit much better and noticeably thicker padding."
3.0,"The top seems to fit true to size, although not made for a long torso! The bottoms are awful! Huge at the top and super skinny at the bottom. They would not stay up!"
3.0,"It feels really cheap but I guess it will work, just need to find something that looks okay with it"
3.0,"material is not good.....after washing it,  a visible white patch came out....cant return cz now i dont have that packaging cover.."
3.0,"I ordered size Large. What I received is labeled Large but not nearly as voluminous as in the photo - not just a body size difference,  I mean the cut itself is not as full.<br /><br />The dress fit my US size 12 figure fine, except around the bust. My bust is a 38B, the listing says the bust is 59, but the dress was unbearably tight in the bust."
3.0,Fabric too thin and has too much elastic.  I wish it had more cotton and less elastic.
3.0,"Very transparent, but they do seem to be rather comfortable.  Might be good for sleeping or lounging around."
3.0,"It feels like a thick cotton t shirt, not very soft even after washing. Its a fine shirt but not quite what I was expecting."
3.0,I did not really like the material of this hoody.
3.0,These were too small for me and I ordered size up. Thankfully my daughter was able to wear with the drawstring. They are her new pajamas. They are to see-through to wear in an office setting or out of the house.
3.0,It was so small in size. I was hoping it was bigger around so it would show up better on your finger.<br />Perfect for tiny hands but not medium or larger hands for a woman
3.0,"Great polarized glasses, just wish the frame was larger. Tight fit, cause I have a big head lol<br />Update: rubber pads have started to peel off."
3.0,G/F did not care for the style !
3.0,it is too small...
3.0,"I liked that it's wide and smooth, and doesn't look totally obvious like most of the other bands designed to push the breasts down after surgery. Wish someone would make these with lace on them so they look nice peeking out from under shirts. Seriously why hasn't someone done that yet? My only recommendation would be to slightly taper the rough end of the elastic so that it doesn't slightly overlap the soft part and scratch the skin or snag clothing. Anyone looking for size reference, I measure 38&#34; at fullest bust, and this band fits on about 1&#34; from the loosest setting. If you're bigger than 40&#34; you might wanna go with the larger size. UPDATE: I'm downgrading to 3 stars because the rough Velcro edges have left a bunch of snags on a very nice compression top, basically ruining it. I'm pretty upset. Tapering the rough Velcro end would have prevented this problem. I have requested a return and will go back to the elastic provided by my surgeon because at least it didn't destroy my clothes."
3.0,"This shirt is soft and fits nicely, honestly a good quality shirt. The screen printing is awful though, it's cheap vinyl or something similar. Not proportionate to the size of the shirt (too small, looks awkward) and it feels like it will peel off after one wash. i am disappointed."
3.0,Very flimsy.  I returned it.
3.0,"It's a nice enough shirt but it runs small.  If the description had said that anywhere, I would have ordered a bigger size.  I ended up giving it to my much smaller niece and it fits her well."
3.0,"Beware... this product states it is 4X6.  This is misleading, because the dark blue part is 4 x 6 only when it is OPENED FLAT.  The actual cleaning part of the cloth is 5 x 3 1/2."
3.0,I put it on and it broke...luckily I was able to repair it but I should not have had to right out of the box!
3.0,"Seems like a good watch.  The looks are very noticeable.  But the watch was adjustable yet with it all the way wide, it was very tight ony wrist.  I can't imagine why a watch would not include enough band to fit me.  The cost of an additional link or two would be great.  I am not the largest person I know either.  I am 6'3"".  I know people who are 6'8"" and much bigger.  Why not sell a watch that just covers more people?  Humans are getting bigger, a lot bigger.  Tee shirts came in small, medium and large for most of my life.  Very recently they have started selling 2,3 and sometimes you can find 4x tee shirts.  Watch makers should take notice."
3.0,I wanted it like the picture.
3.0,"They look awesome! But when I look at my cell phone, it looks warped, like the lens are most likely damaging."
3.0,"Ordered xl, got l. It still runs small. It looks more like a medium.  It is still super cute. Luckily it is my daughter's favorite color and will fit her great. The pic looked like it would come to my waist, definitely not, it is a half shirt. But it is cute."
3.0,"This panties are pretty, well made and comfy. Material looks good, but they sends to me other combinations of color, not what showed in the picture."
3.0,Pretty dress but not as fitted as my daughter would like.
3.0,Wasn’t happy with it .. definitely ran about 2 sizes to small
3.0,"I am 5'7&#34; tall and ordered the Large TALL. I ordered the tall so that it would hit the floor so that I could wear heels.  It did not.  With wearing only 1 1/2 inch heels, this still comes to my ankles.  A little disappointed at the length, the color is beautiful."
3.0,"I was expecting a t shirt material, it is full polyester. Like a swim suit... bummed."
3.0,nice quality shirt just sizes are off I ordered a medium felt more like an Xl
3.0,Bought for granddaughter for Valentines Day. Cheap chain and doesn’t light up very good. Looked discolored
3.0,package got here in good time and looks very good but package was ripped open
3.0,"I've bought this brand before for my three year old daughter who is pretty petite. However, this particular bodysuit is way too right and will probably last a few months before it's too small. I wish I ordered a larger size."
3.0,"I thought these earrings were very well made, and I liked how delicate they looked. Unfortunately, I am returning them because they sent two different sizes. I am planning on reordering them and hopefully this time I will get two earrings that are the same length. Other than this unfortunate mistake, I would recommend these earrings."
3.0,"This Skort was Okay;  Because of the elastic waist band, I found my golf balls (only 2 in the pocket)  were weighing down the skort and had to pull it up often."
3.0,I lik this bag but the lining is cheaply made and is freying and tearing. I have had to sew it already.
3.0,I likeit
3.0,"Love the dress and the shape of it. I’m 5’8”, wish the dress was a little longer so it felt more appropriate for work."
3.0,Made me feel like I had a very boxy body.
3.0,The stick on lens is very thick not the best I have seen
3.0,"Apart from the fact that the color of the shoe does not match the color displayed on the page, the overall quality also is pretty average, or probably should say the most you could expect for the price. However when worn they look very fancy!"
3.0,"Nice and attractive shoe. It does, however, runs a trifle small in width, but only in the toe box. They are &#34;just&#34; wearable due to not being quite wide enough because my toes don't even reach close to the end of the toe box. Nice leather and a good price for this brand of shoe."
3.0,"These pants are beautiful and I love the fabric.  The waist fitted perfectly, but the legs too long for my 5'3 body."
3.0,"So, this apron is not ""thick"" but it's not flimsy either. I can't comment on it's usefulness as this is a gift for xmas. What I did like was the pockets and the coating on the back to keep it ""waterproof"" and wasn't thin as other items I've purchased. There was a minor inconsistency with the sewing, but doable."
3.0,"The fit was a bit smaller than all the other nightgowns I ordered from PajamaGram.  The fabric is rough and scratchy, even after several washings.  I should have returned it immediately when it was different from all the rest.  Love the colors, dislike the material."
3.0,"The item arrived on time and in fine condition. The quality seemed average, nothing spectacular. However, I had to return it because it was HUGE on me. I ordered an XL based on the size guide and while it did fit, it did not look sexy at all. Maybe it's because I'm a petite girl, but the shorts were very long on me and the top looked like a dress. The fit was nothing like the model in the picture."
3.0,It balls up after a couple of washes
3.0,This trench coat is lightweight and super soft very comfortable to wear don't get me wrong! But the style and design is a bit confusing and not too flattering to my shape!! It keeps me warm it fits just right just something about it is off to me and my eye. Not sure if this one just had extra fabric on it or it's the way it's supposed to be.
3.0,Product arrived in a timely manner. The only real issue I had was that the product came with a &#34;gasoline/oil smell&#34; and I had to wash them twice to even consider trying on.
3.0,"Cute dress I wear a medium but I bought a large, it fit like a small. I suggest you buy two sizes up."
3.0,This is a very pretty dress. I am not a fan of the tie straps.<br />I am also very picky with dresses
3.0,The dress have a beautiful print but it's somewhat on the small side so make sure to order a size up also the strap goes midways under ur breast not around ur waist.
3.0,Would not know if comfortable or not. Could not get it on
3.0,I love this product ! No regret !
3.0,post infected the ears
3.0,"Size doesnt fit like the picture, it feels small.  Very thin odd material."
3.0,Technically it works. However the fabric slips to the end of the oval ring and bunches up leaving a bulge and poor fit.  Bad design in my opinion.  I give it 3 stars because even with the bunching it is more comfortable than traditional stays
3.0,"it is a good product but its very overrated, in my opinion it doesnt deserve such a very very expensive price like this specially that it is a new emerging brand not having a big name like Mont Blanck etc.."
3.0,Very disappointed in this belt. Very stiff unlike my other leather belts that I own.
3.0,Top was slightly tight on the bottom band and bottoms fit well. Not the most flattering set ive bought but does the job. As fashion goes horizontal stripes does make a body look more plump. But after the long wait of about 5 weeks it showed up and it comfortable.
3.0,The shipper was great to work with. The big problem is that after getting the case it didn't fit our Kindle Fire at all.
3.0,The cut is a little different.  Not as flowy as pic shows or long as pic shows.
3.0,Don’t darken at all
3.0,"I love the look of this necklace from far away, but the large, fake, blue &#34;gem&#34; hanging off the bird's tail was too cheap-looking for me (it's hard to see that detail in the picture--I missed it and would not have ordered it had I seen it). I removed the &#34;jewel&#34; and have worn the necklace out in the evening, but I still wouldn't wear it anywhere in bright light. It's the details that reveal how cheap it is."
3.0,Most of these do not light up at all. I have purchased them before and they were much better. Bad batch?
3.0,Was cheaply made but served it's purpose. Not sure if I'd wear it again cause it's thin and cheap.
3.0,"I checked all reviews before I order it. The delivery was fast than I expacted. But the design is little bit different with my order. I can select only one type font, the font size is too big. And in the front side, there is some scratch. I can't remove it."
3.0,"This bag is beautiful. Looks better in person than online, but I wasn't happy at all with the way it was packaged. It was folded  & creased at the bottom of the bag to flatten it for packaging I assume, but now I have to get it back to its original shape before I carry it.  Not cool at all."
3.0,Not particularly flattering.
3.0,Way too big to be a bracelet. It doesn't stay on my wrist at all.
3.0,"I am giving 3 stars because it looks like it should have been good quality in route it arriving broken.<br /><br />My roommate and I both we're unable to open it.<br />It fully extends but doesn't open even a little bit.<br /><br />On a side note, the package had been opened when I received it and the umbrella cover was missing but I didn't see any physical damage find to the umbrella and it was still snapped."
3.0,Pretty dress but the color is not what I had expected. I order the light pink and the color it’s a lilac not pink at all.
3.0,VERY NICE BANGLES.....VERY CHEAPLY MADE.....THEY GET OUT OF SHAPE WHILE WEARING THEM.....MATERIAL IS TOO SOFT.
3.0,Wanted to use to hold sweaters closed. They looked cheap
3.0,"It was a little too big, maybe it was my nose, but the color is so pretty"
3.0,I ordered a large bc that’s what Amazon had as my “recommended” size and it fit like a medium. Would definitely size up 2x for an oversized fit but once for just comfort. Super cute though
3.0,"Love the navy blue and white, but the skirted part of the dress is very stiff and doesn't lay right. I tried steaming it which helped just a bit. It flares out more on one side than the other. It's made of a thick cotton type material.<br /><br />The top of the dress was a bit loose fitting around my shoulders and bust area, very uncomfortable.<br /><br />Im normally a size small, or 2 reg, or 2 petite. I ordered this in a small. I think dress this dress would look better on a curvier, taller or petite woman.<br /><br />The material is nice and doesnt look cheap at all. Just not for my petite/short body type."
3.0,I love the color and fullest of the skirt. I wish it had the long ribbon draw string around the waist. Still a beautiful skirt.
3.0,They're ok but run small and the band at the top is to thick.
3.0,"These hats are adorable but they run very small, more for kids than adults"
3.0,I really like one however one of them broke very quickly.
3.0,This tank is comfy but really short
3.0,It was a ok fit and for the cost it look fine.
3.0,Great comfy socks but unfortunately don’t work with my shoes.
3.0,"Not bad for the price paid, as far as style goes.  It leaves a green stain on skin, though, when worn for a while.  Would have paid a bit more for a set that's plated at least, but my 11 year old daughter picked this herself."
3.0,Split to high. Tight torso area so you can barely get it over your head. It also smooshes your boobs
3.0,"Ok quality. Color nice.  I followed reviews on sizing and it was too large for my daughter.  Returning.  Simple dress but don't size up.  If you are a ladies 10 with a chest, a large should fit.  Medium should work for size 8-10 with average chest."
3.0,"These bags inconsistently at 14"" to 15"", they will not hold a 12"" x12"" project box. Heavy canvas body with finished seams."
3.0,"I love the style of this so much. It’s cute and on trend. The sizing seems a little off, however. It is very short in the torso. My newly turned 1-year-old is quite petite and it isn’t long enough for her. In order for it not to pull on the crotch, I have to loosen the straps pretty far, which shows a little too much chest area. Go a size up for a better fit!!"
3.0,Fast delivery  thin material but ok
3.0,My clothes still get wet when I use the apron. So not %100 waterproof.
3.0,I  did like the hat but unfortunately it was to big for me so I decide to give it as a gift to someone that I know it will fit perfectly:)<br />To bad because I really like it !!!
3.0,"Top is too big, bottom at hips is too small."
3.0,"I love these earrings but twice now the earrings have come off from the actual part that goes in your ear.  I had to stop wearing them because of that, I don't want to lose them.  They are very nice though."
3.0,I have ordered a different brand of this type belt that I liked and seems much better made. This adjustment buckle has a very sharp edge that digs into my back. I’m going to see what I can put on it to smooth it out and then for the money it wasn’t to bad for as many as you got.
3.0,"My daughter got this for her and her friend and I don't know how the friends necklace is holding up but my daughters chain fell apart, she was able to put a different chain on but the original chain isn't too sturdy."
3.0,already one latch broke
3.0,"cheaply made, like plastic"
3.0,"I would size up if you want it to cover leggings, it is shorter than expected, for under $10 I can't complain, it is soft."
3.0,I use it for casual work
3.0,Definitely very slim.
3.0,Very nice just somewhat tight and short.
3.0,"Very pretty, but the ball came unglued one of the first days I wore it."
3.0,Liked the print and pattern but the fabric is warm for Florida until the cooler weather rolls in
3.0,"Cute and functional.  BUT the 'bling' is coming off quickly.  Wouldn't buy the 'bling', again.Also, the strap separated from the hook on one of them- could have been a disastrous loss!"
3.0,The luminous dial only works for 15 minutes after exposure to bright light.
3.0,I have two of these and love the design...BUT..both have eventually torn and are now useless. Such a shame.
3.0,"So cute, and otherwise perfect, but it came with 2 stains that appear to be ink stains. Not noticeable enough that I thought it was worth the trouble of sending back and replacing, but they are see through."
3.0,I have thick thigh and it keeps on rolling down.😩
3.0,color is coming off
3.0,Not good for winter... I had to return. I was hoping for something thicker and warmer. Fit was ok and style was ok.
3.0,It's fine. Just know that a polyester knit tie costs a third of what a silk knit ties costs because it is a third the quality and look.
3.0,The beads are beautiful but the description says the bracelet is adjustable and it is not.
3.0,This dress looks beautiful on my daughter. The only problem is she has a large chest. The dress is not made for a woman that is big breasted. We kept the dress and had it altered because we loved it so much. It is for a July outdoor wedding and it seemed to have be cooler than other long black dresses
3.0,Did not fit across the back as expected. keeping it anyway.
3.0,"The dress is adorable and double lined so it isn’t see through, however, I wasn’t expecting it to be so heavy. It was a little tight, too short for my comfort, and the button at the neck came off when I went to close it. Sadly I will be returning."
3.0,"Its very warm, but sleeves are very wide."
3.0,"I really wanted to like this dress because I loved the pattern but the sizing was all off. I’m 5’6’’, 123lbs. I ordered a small. You can see from my photos the cut is very  exaggerated. It goes from a small waist to huge hips. The top/waist fit perfectly on me, but I had a ton of extra fabric on my hips. It was also much longer than expected, hitting mid/lower knee. Unfortunately, I had to return."
3.0,Bought this for two teenage Grandaughters who live in Daytona Beach and neither liked it.  Said it was too bulky for them and just not something they would wear.  So.. another rewrap as a Door Prize.
3.0,great top but runs a little small and because there is not a lot of stretch in the material it gets tight at the shoulder after awhile.
3.0,Beautiful but ROD 2 SHORT!!
3.0,Cool designs but they don’t was very well. They tend to ball up after first wash
3.0,"I love G Shocks but didn't love this one.  The screen is buried too deep so glare makes it hard to read during the day.  I bought the GD 350 1 B instead because its similar but more readable during the day.  I did like the solar and atomic time, however all the G shocks are so accurate I didn't feel the need for the atomic time."
3.0,"The overall aesthetic of this dress was beautiful- from a distance. Close up, you could tell it was made like a costume. The lining was way too short, and the dress kept going crooked on me. I ended up returning."
3.0,Overall the luggage was satisfactory. However I was disappointed that it did not have any additional pockets to place small items or shoes in it. Nor that it was not expandable.
3.0,great fit but too thick of material. Cant breathe or even talk through them.
3.0,"It's very comfortable for cool to cold weather. But let's say -40 degrees. You'll either use these as insulators OR get some insulators and wear these on the outside. My UA cold gear works better. I thought these would work the same, but NOT. Their good for cool to cold weather, but not REAL cold weather. For this you'd probably be better off having actual ski type gloves."
3.0,"Ordered women’s 10 n these are about 2 inches too large and very wide. I have a wide foot but these are really wide. Rubber is harder than Oofoos, but still has good arch support n good cushion. Will return and order smaller size."
3.0,These bras are not high impact. I think they might work for yoga but I wouldn't know. I got them for a friend. They offer no support for high impact activities.
3.0,Too thin for effectivness
3.0,Hat will not shape as picutred.
3.0,This shirt is a must have for any biker chick. Go one or two sizes up since the sleeves are a bit snug. I ordered the ×small /small...I am 5 ft 2 in tall and 130 lbs. It's long on the waist and covers butt so I enjoy wearing it with dark leggings and knee high boots. Thick fabric and strong stitching with good HD graphic after being washed multiple times. I wish I had ordered a Medium or Large just for better comfort on my arms and wrists.
3.0,Please delete the review posted on the web -- I did not buy it!!!<br /><br />But I agree with the review -- I saw the product.  I won't buy it with $150
3.0,"These yoga pants are nice and stretchy, but not flattering on.  The fabric seems to have a lot of give to it, so I don't know if it will retain it's nice, yoga-tight feel after washing. There's a small pocket on the back which will be nice for a key or an ID. These are a large, and I typically wear a medium, so I'd say these run small.  If you have a very fit physique these may look great on you. For me I'd have to wear a long shirt over them.  They are also long on me as I am only 5'1""."
3.0,Material is a little weak and it runs small and the bust fit's off
3.0,It's poorly made and not what it looks like in the picture. It's much darker and made in cheaper material. Do not buy this item.
3.0,It's small. I'll save it because it was inexpensive and I am hoping to lose weight
3.0,"I usually wear size xl,but this is too tight. Is there any way,I could replace it for xxl?"
3.0,"this tie is just ok.  the overall quality of the material is ok, nothing to write home about, but still slightly nicer than like some cheap cloth tie.  i received the gold color and my wife does not particularly like the color.  the color is pretty true to the one picture on the amazon web page.  it is a little bit wide for my style.  mostly my issues are the overall quality of the material.  fair, not bad, not great.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for my unbiased review my reviews are my own and as unbiased as possible. I do not receive any additional compensation for my reviews. I also do not receive anything different if I rate something 5 stars or 1 star and have not been instructed to give only high ratings. I try to leave the most honest reviews to help others decide whether or not to purchase a particular product as I value reviews before making any purchase on Amazon. I hope these reviews help others in deciding on their purchases as other reviews have helped me countless times. I will come back and update my reviews as necessary as I use products through their life cycle, updating on durability and overall satisfaction of use."
3.0,"Wanted a darker color like shown in the picture, but the product is much lighter. So haven't used it."
3.0,"The watch's clasp I got is different from the picture, was this a mistake? The picture shows pin and tuck and this had a clasp. Please advise if this was in error."
3.0,"CON: kind of small and will rub on the heal if you wear them for several hours.  PRO: they look cute with shoes that show the top of your foot, I wear them with some small flats and I always get compliments from girls who notice my feet. Toe socks with style."
3.0,Super cute and cozy but the poms aren’t secure. They fall off easily.
3.0,"These look great and came in excellent packaging but they are not the functional. You can tell when you look through them that the polarizing in a little shoddy which doesn't bother me all that much. The big issue is that they are too flat, if the sun is between your 8 & 11 it's gonna get your eyeball. They doo seem to be well constructed though."
3.0,Little flimsy side were loose but I love them they fit my face fantastic!
3.0,"Some of the LED lights will be different colors on a solid color chosen.  For example if the entire shoe was lit green,  I get a couple of the LEDs that would be blue.  They are nice shoes, just not the greatest controller."
3.0,A little flimsy feeling but she what do you expect for the price. Pretty and shiny.
3.0,I unfortunately did not have a good experience with this seller I received twice the wrong size pants and at 1 point the button was missing on one of them. However as for as the quality of the item it was as described and had stretch to them to fit a bigger body shape.
3.0,"Nice looking, great price but what I would call oversized."
3.0,this crown is HUGE! I don't have a tiny head but this hat was covering my whole head!
3.0,Fits perfect I suggest any one if your tired of losing your nose peircings to get this product it's great!! I wear mine every day
3.0,"Okay so the dress is just like the picture, the fit was a little more clingy but not to the point where it's uncomfortable or hard to put or take off. The material is what's eh, it's a shiny material,  looks cheap. But still a nice dress."
3.0,It fits better on my 9 yr old niece.
3.0,Very good quality but very small
3.0,The fabric picks easy. So if you happen to get up against anything it will have a snag in the fabric.
3.0,come small!
3.0,The glasses were too big and couldn’t fit my face
3.0,"My daughter loves this necklace and wore it daily until the pearl clasp popped off.  She nearly lost it and we retied it but it's not very secure to start.  Great for the price but you get what you pay for with this one. Super cute, not the best made."
3.0,"Size up - I did, nearly fit, but  cute"
3.0,A little tight in the waistline compared to my other shorts.
3.0,"It’s a nice shirt—not a jersey as described. Overall, it was an okay purchase."
3.0,"I was so excited about getting my tee shirt and I was so bummed that it was too small. I even ordered one size larger because some fabric shrinks, but when I tried it on it was too small. My nickname is Sassy! The fabric is not good quality so that also makes a difference."
3.0,My other hat didn’t have a tilted crown it was up right does this mean my hat has a defect ? Also had a weird adhesive substance on the back of the hat it came off with some friction so I’m not too concerned just found it off putting
3.0,"I ordered a small and they were too big! Pretty disappointed. Will keep them to wear around the house but, definitely can't be worn to exercise in as I would have to constantly pull them up. Wish they came in an xs."
3.0,These gloves are for people with extremely long fingers. I don't have huge hands but I can't imagine someone having long enough fingers to fill these out. The material is nice but not as soft as I would have liked. They are stylish.
3.0,These shirts have a great design but the shirts are not the soft cotton you want. These feel more like a cheap fundraiser shirt.
3.0,Great stretchy belts but was not pleased that the gold one was more rose gold.
3.0,"It frayed in the sleeves 3rd time worn.Not quality.<br />Comfy, Pretty but Flimsy"
3.0,"Your product good, my problem is neck, shoulders and upper arms so I need compression there"
3.0,Doesn't hold up without straps. Too much space in between pad in boobs so... kind of useless.
3.0,"I bought these for my wife. They are pretty, except the coils are different.."
3.0,"i like them, but they are a little small and i need to lose about 15 pounds for them to fit good."
3.0,Too small for my fat fingers and looks cheesy
3.0,Is a little baggier than I expected. Might try to order a size smaller next time
3.0,I thought it was an adult earring. It is too small u can hardly see them. They are cute for children.
3.0,Maybe go up 1-2 sizes for more length but still works for the look I was going for (36B)
3.0,"These are beautiful, but the back snapped off of one of the earrings after I wore them twice"
3.0,"I don't have an exceptionally large head, but these did not fit snug even at the widest setting. Also, the ear forms were too small to cover my whole ear which was disappointing. I'll keep them because I live in the freezing midwest and I might need a spare pair around - But I'm ordering from a different brand and just doing over the head kind."
3.0,"Fell out a few days after putting it on, how annoying."
3.0,I was excited for these as they are super cute.  I ordered a half size bigger due to reviews of hard to slipping on.  I had no problem getting them off or on.  I got lots of compliments.  However after wearing them for the third time the heel totally came unglued from the Boot.  Bummed
3.0,"I'm 5'8&#34; and 140 lbs, usually a US size 8 with a larger bust.  This dress fit beautifully in a medium and I almost kept it...until I noticed the poor construction around one side of the dress.  The seam where the skirt meets the bodice was VERY obviously wavy on the dress I received.  I would have needed a belt to cover it, defeating the purpose of a flowy maxi dress.  So sad."
3.0,I liked the overall look of these pants.  However only one side of the 2 adjustable elastics worked. And the pants did not look like the picture. On the good side they are warm and they are long enough to go over snowboots. It's just when you  order off a picture you really expect the item delivered to look like the picture
3.0,"This product ran very small. Other than that,  they were soft and comfy."
3.0,This was to be white. I didn’t even try it on but it’s a pretty dress sure I would have looked great in it - but not the color I requested.
3.0,Nice color but run too small
3.0,"this dress is very cute but it has no stretch at all. I thought with the 5% spandex this would have good stretch. If you are very busty this may be a tough fit. This dress fit me everywhere but it was VERY tight in the bust. Ordered the XL and I am usually a  16/18. Will probably return or give it to my daughter. I am 5'7"" and the length was good. Disappointed because it is a nice style."
3.0,They run small and shrink even further. Even having bought a size bigger they still barely fit. Not worth the price.
3.0,"Bought this product to clean my sneakers (mainly got it for the brush and the carrying case as I use castille soap which works GREAT to clean shoes).  Anyways, the cleanser works alright.  It doesn't exactly perform miracles, even when multiple applications are applied.<br /><br />However, the brush works really well, especially on mesh cloth.  The reason why I gave it 3 stars is because my brush grew mold on it VERY quickly.  I would let it dry after use but it still grew mold on it and I haven't even owned it for more than 2-3 months (and have used it LESS than 10 times).<br /><br />Anyways, I ended up throwing out the case and the brush.  Would highly recommend using castille soap and a soft bristle toothbrush.  I may also give the Jason Markk brush a try because cleaning my shoes with a toothbrush takes a long time because of the small surface area."
3.0,"The shirt I ordered is not the shirt I received--I ordered the light blue with the guns and roses pattern, the last one in stock. I received a more casual linen shirt in a darker shade of blue. But the fit was excellent and the quality is good, and I got a great deal (when I ordered, that size and color was only $20). Plus the one I actually wanted was out of stock. So I'm keeping it, and recommend this brand for quality--just make sure you can get free returns in case they send the wrong item."
3.0,"I ordered Sucrose in large (just to be sure to wasn't gonna be too tight) and it was a bit boxy which is fine. The garters were too long so there was an awkward sag to it when its clipped to the socks and clothes. The left glove couldn't even fit because of how tight the pinky was and had no room for it anyway or almost any other finger. The vision broke after i tried it on since the clip was hot glued on :/ The socks were fine and comfortable. The white jacket felt weird and upside down even when it was worn correctly. The belt that velcros to the blue coat was shaped kinda odd, idk."
3.0,I love the style of the shoe. runs a bit small had to order a bigger size for my 3 year old who usually fits a size 8.
3.0,The sandals are really cute but they slide from side to side which makes it hard to walk on.
3.0,"It was just like the image online, neatly made! My daughter feet is long, so I have to go up a size, to give space for (big toe). Because it would tip over an inch in front of the sandals. Overall it's an ok pair of sandals #1sttimebuyer#thanks"
3.0,"These were much larger than I anticipated, I wouldn’t like to wear them on my glasses all day.  They look very heavy duty, not what I was hoping for"
3.0,The shoes look just like the picture and are very cute BUT they fit very small. I normally wear a size 6 and ordered a half size up 6 1/2 and still too tight. I would recommend ordering a whole size up.
3.0,I got rusty the same day I wore it.
3.0,The fit of this shirt is too tight and small--I would order up two sizes.
3.0,The shirt is soft and fairly comfy however the sleeves are really tight for the average plus size woman. If there was half inch of give in the sleeves this shirt would be perfect.
3.0,"I like the company and style of these pant, and have ordered three different pants from them before! However, when I received this particular pant, the color was not as pictured. The color was brown, but I was hoping it was a darker brown, like the picture; not a chocolate brown.<br /><br />The color in the picture looks sophisticated. The color I received was off. Had to return. The fit was great, but the color was not true to the picture. Thank you!"
3.0,Jacket was nice but runs small.  I normally wear a US size 4 and order a medium.  I found that it was tight.  That means I needed to order 2 sizes up.  That would mean L and the jacket would hang too big in the chest area.
3.0,Gloves were soft and comfortable but there was a strong chemical smell. I’m hoping it wears off over time since this was a gift.
3.0,Cute print but poor quality. Fabric seems more worn/thin in some places than others. Sad to return because otherwise looks just like the photo.
3.0,Top was very small and tight
3.0,"Im rather busty and its snug, its a bit long too."
3.0,"Quality isn't very good, but the colors are beautiful. It's not a cotton type sweatshirt, more of a silky feel to it. Not something that will keep you warm in cold weather. Shipping didn't take as long as I had expected, it arrived in time for a 14 year olds birthday. The problem I had was I ordered a small/medium and was sent a large/XL, which didn't fit the 90lb girl."
3.0,"I really loved this necklace, unfortunately after a few moths, the sparkly part peeled off like a sticker. I guess you get what you pay for? I may even order another one. I wore it with several different outfits and got many compliments!"
3.0,"It’s ok, but it’s definitely not what I ordered. I ordered the gray shirt with white buttons but got a blue shirt with brown buttons. Would love to not deal with the hassle of returning it but still have the correct shirt sent to me."
3.0,"I have loved this bag , but after 7 months the little leather holder that holds the strap broke. So disappointed!"
3.0,"I am normally a true medium in dresses/shirts but I ordered up to a L just to play it safe.  This dress was super tight, like you can see my uterus tight. :0  The chest area was really small and for my 38C chest so even a low cut bra would show.  If I were to order this again I would prob order an Xl or even an XXL.  It is, however,  a nice length; right at mid knee.  I ordered the Navy blue which was a very dark blue but quite classy looking.  Cute dress just did not work for me."
3.0,"Everyone in the reviews all said that this suit runs really small, but I disagree. I got a small (I usually wear a small) and it fit pretty well. I think a medium would have also fit, but may have been a little big. The suit is very cute and looks a lot like the pictures. It is a cheaper material, but I think it'll still work great. I've gotten a lot of compliments on this suit!"
3.0,The shirt ended up not fitting well and the material was very light. The screen printing seemed like it would flake off.
3.0,Poor quality. Looks cheap. Looks better on the website than in person.
3.0,"They have a great stretch to them. However, they were really loud to walk around in, and super super long. I felt like even if I wore them with heels, they would've bunched up on the bottoms. They have an awesome tall waist so it sucks you in. But I did return them."
3.0,These leggings are cute and seem to be made pretty well except they flare out at the ankles. Very weird.
3.0,Looks kinda cheap but my mom loved them so that's all that matters!
3.0,"These fit the diameter of my calves fine (not slim, but not quite wide, either) but they're pretty short so I can see them becoming a hassle to keep in place."
3.0,Sizing was weird and they are more like panty hose than tights.
3.0,"Just like many other shirts I have purchased off amazon... sleeves are to short, which is extremely irritating! Other then the sleeves it fit good."
3.0,The picture makes it look shorter than it really is
3.0,"It could be taller, to extend from eyebrows into the hairline further."
3.0,I had to make adjustments to it. Did not fit as expected. Waist area was a loose.
3.0,Not as pictured .. dress is mostly white and paper thin. Not long enough to wear as a dress unless you want your buttcheeks hanging out.
3.0,Looked good but very flimsy.
3.0,"The shirt fits width wise, but the length is too short. I ordered it for my kids to give to my dad. He wears it, but if he raises his arms up, you can see his tummy!! Also, the shirt was Heather grey, with black print, and the print looks faded. It isn't a bold black, more like a black that's been washed several times. I'm giving 3 stars because the shipping was quick and I do like the lightweight material of the shirt. However, I would not order again."
3.0,Ivory white color. Neck is too large for me. Did not fit body type.
3.0,To tight in the sleeves. Towards the wrists
3.0,"The bottom padding is nice, that is for dance purposes only. If you are looking for footwear for Barre, Pilates or Yoga this is not for you. Your four toes feel kinda squished together. In movement you don't want to think about any sought of discomfort."
3.0,"The reasons I got this backpack is, because I really liked how it looked, the trendy style, and it came with a lunchbox plus a pencil case.<br />Lunchbox - The lunchbox was very small. It is shaped differently than in the product picture and is NOT insulated like lunchboxes are supposed to be. It is only lined with the same material as regular totes or bags.<br />Backpack - The backpack could barely fit two 2-inch binders in it. Also, the zippers kept getting stuck. Overall, I wouldn't say it was a waste of money because most backpacks are way harder to use.<br />Pencil case - This is the best part because of its style and size. It doubled as a cosmetic bag for lip gloss and hair accessories.<br />I was really disappointed though, because the backpack was described differently than it really is in quality and even capacity."
3.0,"I bought this and it's cute but once I got it I kind of regretted it, but for style reasons.  I'm also 5'5 and weigh 115 lbs and it fits pretty well"
3.0,I preffer in other size if possible for next orders.
3.0,"They were nice, not the best at blocking the sun. After about 3 weeks of normal wear the screws started to come loose and they didn't sit right on my prescription glasses anymore. The screwdriver needed is very small and I don't happen to have one lying around."
3.0,"not really for warmth, but would does a great job of keeping the hair back out of your eyes.  i would buy it again"
3.0,"These were a big hit on Christmas morning because they look great and feel great and are very warm.  After a few washings, however, they lost their elasticity.  We bought one set of a different brand that are holding up better."
3.0,"Just okay.  Pretty cheap looking, but will wear them occasionally."
3.0,"I purchased this product as it remind me of the one I had back in my college days. Unfortunately it was really tight in the shoulders and the upper sleeves, even though I went a size larger to make sure I would fit. I'm happy with it for what it is but I'm worried I'm gonna rip through it."
3.0,"When I received the item I was very disappointed.  The hat box was broken in two places.  It was made of a plastic material that I would describe as ""brittle.""<br /><br />I would but from this seller again - they did a great job on the return.  I just wouldn't buy this particular product again."
3.0,"Disappointed it didn't fit.  Bought 14/16 for granddaughter, nice colors as pictured but runs small."
3.0,did not order
3.0,"This is an affordable shoe for a toddler who is going to be outside messing them up.  They are affordable, light weight, not sure they will last thru summer tho.  Need to pull the tongue up, I need to help my toddler do this each time she puts them on."
3.0,Just got it. Was so excited. Looked great until further inspection. The rainbow is damaged. If I could just get the rainbow replaced then I would be a happy customer
3.0,Ha dot return it because it was more of a large size than the normal 1X I buy in this exact style.
3.0,no t impress
3.0,Its not working now!
3.0,"The skirt is nice quality and fit my waist perfectly, however it's way too short and I'm 5'3 I ordered my size but if you have hips or a butt, it'll be way too short"
3.0,"Wire for USB connection is flimsy. Mine broke (internally), resulting in intermittently working.<br /><br />Returned for replacement; I've attached a USB extender (female A to male A) which takes the strain off their flimsy wire (and is easily replaceable.)"
3.0,"I like the look and the material of the shirt shipping was extremely fast too, just not the way that it fits normally I am a large I was hoping these would be a little baggier so I ordered a large it was too tight for me to even put it on so I ordered a extra large thinking that that would be perfect still skin tight seems to be a couple sizes too small"
3.0,Desapointed by the poor quality material and smaller size as expected. Didn't look as expected on the picture
3.0,Pants fit great but the top is very small for the size I ordered
3.0,I liked the ease of the install. I don't trust the swivels on the end of the straps. Seems like the weak point.
3.0,"Super cute on the hanger. Would be an adorable maternity dress. But the bodice is too tight and too short and the skirt is too full, so it made me look pregnant when I'm just chubby."
3.0,"I usually fit between a medium and large and, unfortunately, this dress is very much on the small side. I think it is at least two sizes short of being a large. The fabric and print are lovely. Too bad."
3.0,I liked it but it was way smaller then expected
3.0,"Color combo is great, material is very nice. The large fits fine everywhere except the under arm area seems to be too big & shoulders a little too small. Seems to be out of balance. I wore a little black jacket with it & received a lot of compliments. Maybe a medium would have been better but I didn'the want the hips to be too tight."
3.0,It’s okay. The brown is a little more orange then I wanted. Reminds me of Baby Bear from Sesame Street.
3.0,Product fits if your dimensions are average but if you have broad shoulders or an oversized chest then you may need to get a size larger than expected.
3.0,"Overall a cute dress in person but i ordered 2 sizes larger than normal and ir still didnt fir over my chest. Cute dress,im bummed i have to choose a dif dress for my event.  Be sure to check the measurement guide."
3.0,"Purchased the green, and the color is nice. Fabric is okay. But, the sizing didn't work for me at all. The top is short, runs small, almost fits like an extra small, on me. The joggers are sized appropriately and fit well. The whole set looks out of proportion because of sizing. I probably won't purchase this brand again."
3.0,"Super cute!  The bracelets are a little tight on my wrist, and the letter blocks are smeared but over all cute for the money."
3.0,Very light weight and not too dark which is what I was looking for and I couldn't beat the price...
3.0,Too small to protect your clothes. Bought them for my mother-in-law but the straps are too short to go around her waist.
3.0,Cheaply made but we bought it for the &#34;Oma&#34; factor... She loved it!
3.0,It was too small and short!!
3.0,It’s ok for a dupe. The GG logo has some black spots on it...
3.0,It was okay.  My husband only had to wear it once so I think it’s alright.  If you need it for longer keep looking.
3.0,"I have to say, that although this is a well-made product, I'm very disappointed with it. Especially for the cost. The fabric hardly stretches at all, and is so stiff, that it won't stay on my head. Based on the pictures, it looked like a much softer, pliable material. I ended up giving it my daughter. It seems to fit her head better, maybe because her hair isn't as thick as mine. If you are pulling your hair back in a ponytail or bun and want to use this to help hold stray hairs down it might work, but it does NOT work well as a real headband."
3.0,Gorgeous bras but they run small.
3.0,"I think you get what you pay for. It’s not an expensive jacket, it’s not a bad jacket. It’s not exactly what I was expecting but it’s fine. One very funny thing is that the buttons that are usually on the outside of the cuff are on the outside side  of the right-hand sleeve (so right side of cuff) and essentially in the same position on the left-hand sleeve (right side of cuff) so it’s like I have cuff buttons on two right-hand sidesof the sleeves. At first I thought they might’ve put the left side sleeve on wrong but I don’t think that’s the case. The color is good the collar is good. It seems a little surprise in the stretchy and I think if I didn’t hang it up on a nice hanger it would probably lose its shape quickly. I would try other things from this company"
3.0,Delivery was good my only complaint is that the stiching on the top of the sock came apart otherwise good fit just bit long for me i am 6'2&#34; wear a 32 length pant.
3.0,I like the convince of the light weight and slim design how ever I did not like how small the frame actually was they looked like children's sunglasses
3.0,Sucks to have to get something altered because it's so incredibly big. I ordered the smallest size possible and it's still maybe two or three sizes too large. Is there a company that makes vintage for petite women?! I have to budget extra money for alterations each time I order a dress. :/
3.0,"It is what it is. Dress is cheaply made and cheap fabric. It fits very long and I paid $45 to alter the length. However, once done it looks good."
3.0,I have issues with my eyes. But  I think for me glasses might work better!
3.0,Not enough support for a heavy chested person and it runs small
3.0,"Looks so cute in picture, but the overall cut of the dress just isn’t the same when it arrives. I was massively disappointed (dramatic, sorry) because it was just so frumpy. It has since been delegated to pajamas."
3.0,It is a little bigger than expected but mostly will just wear it for St. Patrick's day.  It's really pretty and colors are bright
3.0,"Gloves are decent for the price.  They are mostly waterproof.  Your hands will stay dry, but the outer glove will get wet.  Once wet, you no long have the warmth.<br /><br />Additionally,  these gloves are not very durable for regular daily use.  Gloves have holes in them with less than 30 days use."
3.0,"This is really nice piece, the chain is bit short though. Plus size girls like myself may need a extension."
3.0,"the lens is NOT polarized. if you do not care about this, then the product is very nice."
3.0,It runs small.They need bigger sizes.
3.0,Thought it would ba different color.
3.0,"All around just as expected, but if you pull on the backs of your piercing as i do (labret & philtrum) the back is likely to fall off as it did within the first 3 hours of me having one in."
3.0,"Can't really move your arms up, the way it is sewn it makes you move stiff. Also, I wear a size 4,  it runs very small and so I had to give it to my daughter. Cute, but its worth about $9.99 for a one time wear for a teen."
3.0,Cap size is more suitable for 6 year old and younger.  Be advised that light on front  has to be removed to charge and  charges seperately from Bluetooth audio system. Charging Bluetooth Audio requires included cable.  I found it very difficult to locate charging port on Bluetooth control panel . There is just a small opoening in the fabric where you plug it in but it is difficult to get the connector in. Not exactly kid friendly.
3.0,"Like how they look, very pink. However scratch marks from cleaning frames. Can still see well. Probably will not repurchase."
3.0,"The band is great, but the pins are two weak and keep popping out."
3.0,The 3 starts isn't for the product it's for amazon. Amazon keeps lieing to me about my packages. Get the masks they are fun
3.0,Fits good groin area is a little snug but ok very comfortable but the drawstring sucks broke on second wear
3.0,I’m on the fence with this one! I really loved it but I only used it for about 2 weeks before it broke!  I’m constantly moving and doing stuff so it would get caught on a lot of things. Maybe if it didn’t hang when tightened it then it would be great
3.0,"Cute, but it's for left handed people so I'm keeping as a gift for a friend."
3.0,They were short linked.
3.0,I would give this a full 5 stars but the pockets started to come undone before the second wash! Cute and comfy but a little cheaply make unfortunately
3.0,This fit very snug for the size chart reference
3.0,pay for what you get. for the money it was a great product but its very cheap looking.
3.0,"Not oversized, but very narrow"
3.0,"I love ""The Path of Life"" designs from Alex & Ani so I was super excited to find this bracelet on Amazon. It's a pretty piece, but unfortunately, since it's embossed, it arrived damaged (with enamel on the design rubbed off or chipped off) & I can only assume the enamel will continue to rub off with time. It leads me to believe it's a low-quality piece that won't last long — or at least not as long as a metal-only charm would."
3.0,"Good for the price, I just wish there was more matches to make earrings. I only found 4 pairs."
3.0,The band looks really cute once it is installed. I purchased the Pink Poke a Dot band. It is too thick to just fit in the FitBit case. I had to modify the size by cutting off a little at the pin side so it would fit in the case. Other than this problem I would have given it a 5 star. Install was a real trick.
3.0,The paper clip chain bracelet had a lot of imperfections in the “gold” finish. It’s cute but I am picky so will return it.
3.0,The sole is hard and doesn't provide much traction walking on rocks. A softer more pliable sole would really help
3.0,"I wish i could have chosen the magnification amount . I need 250 , these were probably 100 or 150 ."
3.0,I like that they were light weight and the leather quality to good.  I just didn't care for the size.  They're huge!
3.0,"The sleeve holes are a bit tight especially for the stated size.  Thanks to reviews I knew to get XXXL.  I like it, it’s what I had in mind for lounging.  I am  5’8” .  I hope it washes up well."
3.0,"I bought this watch because my other watches were stored in a bank and needed to be fixed. This watch is certainly heavy but has a really great design. I knew once I saw a watch named after Louis I would really want to buy it because usually the name is associated with gold and beauty.<br /><br />This watch has given me a couple issues, such as randomly stopping, which requires you to sync the time again. It happens 1-2 times a week but I like the design so much I really don't want to return it. I might eventually stop using it and just have it next to my desk as a very expensive decoration."
3.0,"I ordered my usual size, and it was WAAAAY too big. Order a size down."
3.0,Arrived covered in fuzz. It’s not as stretchy as I’d like(has a zipper) but it’ll work.
3.0,Cute for 7 year old . Doesn't tarnish (yet). Daughter won't use them for a long period of time because she says the pinching bothers her. Others might tolerate pinching or not it depends on the individual.
3.0,The shell itself is smaller than I was expecting and color varied. My cat loves it more than I do lol
3.0,"These are cute and fit pretty well but one of the gray socks had some random extra stitching at the toe which made it an uncomfortable fit for my daughter. The extra stitching could not be undone without creating a huge hole in the toe. I’m fairly certain this was just a missed quality control issue so I’m hoping I can get the company to send us a replacement pair. My daughter needs them for her school uniform so shipping back isn’t really an option. Otherwise, the socks are nice."
3.0,Not quality material. Construction is raw. Very small size if one is abundant on the top.
3.0,"Cool Tshirt but the XXL size is more like a smedium. Unfortunately I didn't try it on before I washed it, or I would have returned it for a much larger size."
3.0,way too thin<br />you can see through it<br />it's pointless to have the back cut out for design or for heat release if you have to wear a shirt under it because it's so transparent<br />waste of money
3.0,"These are cute and lightweight, but the posts were bent a lot. It looked like it was done on purpose to make the earrings fit flatter in the packaging. (The packaging wasn’t damaged at all.) I was able to gently bend them straight, but one of the posts feels loose where it’s attached to the back of the earring."
3.0,"The one /without/ the ruffles and the one /with/ the ruffles are designed different enough to be a defining factor when buying this item.<br /><br />First I bought the sage green one with the ruffles on top. I didn’t like the color so I returned it and bought the coral one (doesn’t have the ruffles on top).<br /><br />As a previous customer reviewed it….the one WITHOUT the ruffles (coral one) has straps with an odd design where you have to put the strap over your head when taking it off and putting it on. You could use the button but it’s hard to get at when it’s already on, and if you’re putting it on, it’s too much of a hassle to hold onto the strap and gown (it’s not terry cloth so I’m not calling it a towel) when you’re putting it on.<br /><br />I put a face mask on and/or put oils in my hair before getting in the shower so I didn’t want to wear something that went over my head when I take it off so this design didn’t work for me.<br /><br />As for the quality….it’s really not bad for something made in china. If you’re looking for something plush and luxurious, this isn’t it.<br />If you just need something to take on and off with ease, it (the ruffled one) works!"
3.0,They are okay. I don’t know if they are safe for newer piercing. The crystals are rough and can irritate a healing piercing.
3.0,"I ordered the Ramble Rose and the bottom lace and tassles were green instead of beige. I thought perhaps I had misjudged the pictures, but they show a clear closeup of beige tassles. What's worse, however, is that the tassles are very weak. One tassle was too long and I pulled on it in hopes they were sewn in pairs, and ALL the tassles started to unravel.<br /><br />Thankfully, I'm a seamstress so I could repair or remove the silly tassles. The rest of the cardigan is great! Just like it looks-- thin and flowy, sharp print, beautiful colors. The picture posted by another reviewer is accurate to the true colors-- with the unadvertised green tassles."
3.0,Nice looking and felt great. The legs were too big. I had to return them.
3.0,"It says FLEX FIT on the underside of the bill, but it is not. It has an adjustment strap in the back.<br />Made in CHINA"
3.0,Very cute shoes but way too big and I did not receive the headband.
3.0,No es como lo ponen en la foto
3.0,Wife didn't love the fit.
3.0,It is pretty but the description said &#34;stone&#34; which if there is it is encased in acrylic. That was not stated anywhere. So as a stone jeweler I am disappointed.
3.0,Returned. Cut into the area behind my knee.
3.0,"Love the blue and the yellow bands.  The pink is not true baby girl pink, it’s “blush,” which was disappointing.  Gave three stars because I’m only using two of the three bands in the set.  I look forward to “blush” pink going out of style, and normal baby pink coming back."
3.0,Wish the under part wasn't white.  Expected it to be black like the suit.
3.0,"Fits well, came packaged well. Unhappy because one of the reflectors are lifting off when i took it out of the package."
3.0,"I'm 5'6 and 190 lbs. Usually between a size 14-16. The XL fit, but was tight and places like my chest or booty where the material stretched, the colors faded. Fit way too tight to actually wear out. It's cute and exactly like the pictures but  I will be returning it."
3.0,"I’m a size 8 and these were tight in length. If I can’t get them to stretch a bit I’ll probably give them away. However, they do seem well made and are very cute."
3.0,"Didn't come in the color I th ought it would,  was a little baggy"
3.0,nice overall but runs small.
3.0,cute for maternal wear
3.0,"Very comfortable, true to size and looked great from the front.  Even made my legs look longer.<br /><br />Keep in mind that it has an elastic waist and there is zero support for the tummy, though.  You can wear a shaper but it will likely show through as the fabric is very thin.<br /><br />It looked absolutely awful from the back, though.  Since the natural waist forms from the elastic (and there are no back pockets, of course) it made my butt look very long and gave me a bit of a ""mom jeans' look.  Not flattering.<br /><br />This may actually look better on a slightly heavier person.  A wider rear-end may balance out the longbottom look it was giving me."
3.0,"There are different styles of pants on this page, as well as different colors. The product info that displays will vary too, even if you're viewing what seems visually to be the same style but in a different color. (This means the reviews are not all of the same pants!)<br /><br />According to Amazon, I ordered Z6101 Grey in a size 29, but the pants I got look like the darker Z6088 Grey -- which is fine, because I'm returning them anyway, since the knee zipper is below the knee on me and I don't like that. The fabric is okay, not silky smooth but not exactly scratchy either. I appreciate that the pockets are mesh (so that water doesn't get trapped, were you to fall in a stream).<br /><br />I'm 5'3"" or so and weigh 140 lbs. Most of my pants are 30-32 waist, but if I actually measure my waist with a tape measure it's 33-34. These pants are a 29, which isn't the waist size or the inseam; you can see on some other similar Chinese manufactured pants that the numbers chosen for the sizes are sort of arbitrary. The 29 fits me okay in the waist, with some give in the elastic, but I think they'd pinch a little after a big meal. I'd guess the inseam is 30-31, a tad long for my height but manageable, and standard for most pants in stores at this waist size. Honestly, the best thing you can do is order a couple sizes and return whatever doesn't fit."
3.0,"3 stars because I'm keeping them, but they're see through when you bend over. Okay for days when I mostly teach without doing much demonstrating, but I wouldn't wear them in a class where someone is behind me."
3.0,Sleeves are good. The top elastic band became detached from 3 of the pairs within 2 weeks.
3.0,Really pretty but one butterfly broke off the day i first wore it while drying my hands.  I was bummed but still able to wear.
3.0,"I guess my opinion is abnormal, which I'm pretty use to at this point in my life...lol<br /><br />I'm gonna start with the good.... The material is sooooooo soft and silky, it feels sooooooo nice on my skin. It's a great length, it had the potential to be cute, IF the &#34;sleeves&#34; had been like the picture. So I was taken by surprise at the ruffled sleeves. They look flat on the model, but mine was SUPER ruffled! It looks silly, I think. This has been relegated to a nightgown for me, I'd NEVER wear this out of the house. Honestly, I don't even like my husband to see me in it. The back is weird, crisscrossing straps that are a pain to tie tight enough by myself, but my shoulders are bad from years as a gymnast. I just don't have the range of motion to tie it behind me the way it needs to be. That is not the dresses fault though. I gave it 3 stars for the misleading picture. I still say those sleeves look flat. There is no way the one I got could ever look the way it does on the model."
3.0,Looks nice but very strong plastic smell
3.0,2XL looks like a medium
3.0,Sits below waist
3.0,"I wanted to really, really like these socks but they were very thin and were almost unwearable after 1 wash."
3.0,"They are soft and nice socks, but they both say ""I'm retired"" on the bottom.  I thought 1 said  ""do it yourself"" which is why I bought them."
3.0,"Not large enough to fit around my earlobe.<br />Perhaps, for a newborn or toddler."
3.0,The goggles were a good deal for the price.
3.0,It's too big for my face and it's not very breathable
3.0,"The lenses work well, the glasses frame is very cheaply made. Wonder how long they will last. AND the huge rubber tips that are on the ends with little rubber nubbins grab my hair and make it very difficult to put on and off."
3.0,"The color of the stripes on the sleeves look like a cream color in the picture, but the shirt I recieved is white.  The sleeves at the wrists are white too.  It looks fine, but I am afraid that the wrist area will end up looking dingy.  I would much rather have the charcoal gray color at the bottom of the sleeves like the one pictured."
3.0,Nice colors and design but baggy
3.0,"Love the fabric and it is really cute but even after using the sizing chart it still came to small in the arm length and the body, had to return it because I ordered an extra large and it doesn't come any bigger. I also thought it had buttons on it but it only comes with hooks to keep it close."
3.0,"Odd fit, not a big fan!! 😒"
3.0,I ordered a different style so i gave this three stars but it is cute.
3.0,This dress is shorter than I expected.  I love the feel of it and the print so I will figure out how to wear it without being uncomfortably exposed.<br />The uneven hem is new for me but I will get use to it.
3.0,To clean my rings.  The brush was completely solved.
3.0,Thought it was a little flair.  Tight fitting.
3.0,"It looks just like the picture, but the pieces start coming off the bracelet."
3.0,"These fit as expected and I rate them as OK because they are more like fuzzy socks than slippers/house shoes.  As for 'non-skid', well, I skidded in them on my wood floor.  I like them just fine, but as I said, might as well wear a pair of fuzzy socks."
3.0,Dress is adorable but it runs small and very short. I'm 5'0 and barely 90. Lbs it just fits. Definitely have to be careful with sitting and bending. I don't want to give peep shows.
3.0,smaller than expected. And lining up the holes is just a little difficult.
3.0,"I had to keep untangling myself all day, it was worse when it got get. The side tassels needed to be tied up so I would not trip on them."
3.0,I'm a size 6 and it seems my feet slide down and they fit a tiny bit too big but they're still wearable. Gave me pretty bad blisters after wearing for a pretty short period of time but they are super cute.
3.0,A bit flimsy.
3.0,"The legs are way too long and wide.  Not at all like the picture.  Will return.  The material is very nice, wish there are pockets."
3.0,"Beautiful deep Kelly green color and fit was perfect. However, length was way too short for a dress if you're over 5 feet 5 inches. Haven't decided if I will keep as a tunic or return."
3.0,"While the brush and cloth are a nice touch, the cleaning solution is where it falls short. The “bubble gum” scent is horrendous and if using on a bright white shoe, it dries with a yellow tint. Ive been using the cleaning kit with Dawn dish soap instead, then throwing in the washer, the yellow tint washes off and your shoes are clean again!"
3.0,"Shorter and smaller than they appear, but still pretty. They'll do for prom."
3.0,Super comfy and soft. But I wear a 2x and this runs way small and it's too short! I'm only 5'2 and it barely goes below belt line. Not enough fabric
3.0,"Just as pretty as pictured, but you can only keep a very few things in the wallet part or the case won't close."
3.0,This watch looks great and has many features of more expensive watches. The tiny numbers are at times difficult to read so if you don't have eagle like vision forget reading the date and day of the month in anything but the brightest lighting.  Overall the watch has worked great except for the awful band clasp. It's easy to get on but way too easy to fall off. Sometimes at the worst times like paying at a drive thru or lifting something on a shelf. The skin on the bottom of my wrist too easily presses on the clasp release and at least one side opens causing the watch to nearly fall off. You only have so much adjustment for how tight or loose you can wear this by removing or adding sections of the band so it may not be as bad for you but I wish they would have used the more common divers clasp or Oster lock. Without a reliable clasp the watch is somewhat unusable.
3.0,"I received the dress on time as expected(I have prime).  The dress was packaged in an acceptable manner.  I bought the dress to wear on a cruise, and it served it's purpose. It doesn't wrinkle easily when packed away in a suitcase. The material was acceptable (not the best but not the worst either) for what I needed it. All in all, I was happy with this purchase."
3.0,"Cheap product, cheap price"
3.0,I gave this as a gift back in June. It was very pretty however one of the earrings jewels was a darker color than the other earring. So earrings are mismatched in stone color.
3.0,Too flasy for my taste but well mase
3.0,"Beautiful color, thick, not see-through. Too small for my hips,  I could get them on but they were too tight to be comfortable.  I have curvy hips and usually wear a size 12 in women's pants.  I'm also really sensitive to fabrics and I found these to be a tiny bit itchy."
3.0,"The color is brighter than what is pictured. I decided to keep it since it was around Halloween. I wore it once but won’t be wearing it again, the pants were suuuuper long so they were dragging on the floor and got messed up."
3.0,I ordered a large don’t get me wrong it’s super cute on but the fabric on the inside is super itchy
3.0,"love the hat but the way its shipped, is a problem, yes, you can go get the hat steamed and I tried but it didnt do much good. luckily it was for the beach and it didnt really matter if the hat was wrinkly."
3.0,I love the dress its so cute but sizing chart is off I wear a small normally but this fit like a ex small. i would size up by two sizes. i would return this but i had already tossed the packing out.
3.0,These are tight around my wrists and arm strangely. I can wrap my thumb to little finger around my wrist and still it is small!<br />Reenforce the strap around the middle finger because it is loose!
3.0,"I ordered these glasses for outdoor wear on runs and bike rides.  The glasses are lightweight and the earpieces fit firmly and don't slip down or off when exercising.  The lenses wrap around to give some protection against sun glare getting in.  The nose piece has some adjustability, but I found the glasses uncomfortable on my narrow nose.  The plastic lenses and frames are sturdier than my drugstore pair, but I don't feel like these are a great value for the price."
3.0,The material itself is easy to rip.  ESP walking by bushes.
3.0,I know I'm not the size of the model but I expected a better fit since I ordered XL. Add it to the pile of motivational items of clothing I can't wear
3.0,"These are very pretty. The gold ones look more like rose gold, which I prefer. They were very hard to get apart. I bought theses for my helix, nose and lip. I believe these must be 14/16G. They do not fit my helix which apparently is an 18. Haven't tried them anywhere else yet but I know I will fit my nose."
3.0,Looks exactly like pictures. I would have given more starts if they didn't start to pill after washing them.
3.0,"Very pretty glasses! I got the black and blue ones, and I wear them almost every day. Great for the price. They are very lightweight and sort of hard to clean the lenses, but I love wearing them nonetheless."
3.0,These are not black.  Mine was gray w/a few copper colored ones.
3.0,Did not fit me as it is pictured. Arms were way too short and i definitely do not have long arms...am returning. Was also more of a bright red than the picture.
3.0,"Metal ring started rusting a week after purchase, otherwise I liked it."
3.0,"I liked the style of this dress, but the fit was much larger than I expected.  Shipping was fast and I have just initiated a return, so we'll see how this goes.  If it were available a size down for the same price, I would buy again, but there's a $30 increase to buy correct size!"
3.0,"I love this belt.  But, after a few months it stretches out.  Should have gotten a leather one."
3.0,"Looks a bit cheap when you inspect it. From far away, a great church or work piece"
3.0,"Pretty big, not exactly as pictured. But good enough that I won’t bother returning. Ordered down a size in a different style on the same listing and got the exact same pants... so that was weird."
3.0,"I love the design and pattern of this mask, and that it includes a filter pocket, but the material is satin-like and hotter than any other mask I've worn. I would definitely prefer this in a material that is recommended for mask material.<br />The metal nose bridge was made of what felt like floral wire."
3.0,one of the tassels is missing ans it's a bit short
3.0,The product was in a plastic bag with a plastic hanger. No gift box included.
3.0,They are cute but fits a little small
3.0,They look very nice. They are very flimsy though. After a few uses I can see these breaking.
3.0,Cute but kept having to pull them up all day! Kept sagging in the butt. Returned
3.0,"Reading the reviews I normally wear an xl although I ordered a 2x which was too big, if your thinking of ordering the jacket please order you exact size."
3.0,"These are cute. Obviously for looks and not functionality.We ordered two pairs of these to wear for the World Cup games. One of them came a little bent, but they are okay."
3.0,"When I received this it was much bigger than I expected and it was very scratched and dingy, but it still looks okay from far away."
3.0,"Top fits fine...dress is way too short for me though. 5'2 ...but I have a pear shaped body with a big booty so it makes the dress even shorter than usual on my body. If I ordered a larger size, the top would not fit me."
3.0,Really nice watch. Just a little small for my taste.
3.0,While the quality of the shirt and the appliques are high  the shirt fits a bit small. It's not so much that I can't wear it yet I won't buy another.
3.0,"It looks really pretty, but it's way bigger than I expected and it looks funny on my face :( wish it was a little smaller."
3.0,Was too small but it look great and fit someone who was size 0 great i order size 2
3.0,"Not as flattering as I thought it would be. I have a small waist, and this does me no favors. It’s also short waisted for me. Doesn’t fit right under my bust or go down to my natural<br />waist…it’s somewhere in between. See my photos. Other than that, it’s a nice dress with pockets."
3.0,"Outfit was adorable, but my daughter was swimming in it! Hopefully it will fit next year!"
3.0,"Very cute but like other reviews stated, WAY TOO BIG. I figured I have a face that fits a lot of weird shapes so I would give them a try and yep they are too big. I returned them."
3.0,Ok for summer. Not the best quality
3.0,"I'm 5'7"", 120lbs and received this in a small. I think this fits well and true to size although if you have thicker arms or wider shoulders I might size up.<br /><br />When I first got this my first impression was that this felt amazing and very well constructed. It feels great, has quality stitching and construction and overall seemed like a great piece. It comes with sewn up pockets you can easily open to make them useable.<br /><br />As excited with the quality as I was, I've struggled to actually style this. The length and collar makes it difficult to style I think.:(<br /><br />If you have ideas on how to wear this, I'd recommend! I think it's a quality piece. Unfortunately for me it just doesn't seem to be something I can make work with my work wardrobe:(<br /><br />Hope this review helps!"
3.0,"I wanted a warm plaid scarf for this fall. This scarf is okay. It's really warm, but very bulky."
3.0,It fits a little tight across the top so order a size up.  The color of this blue dress was totally different I bought it for my Birthday because of my favorite color but was disappointed.  You must also purchase a Tulle/can can slip for it to flow properly.
3.0,they are not compressing
3.0,It was nice accurate but compared to some of others I've gotten it had shortcomings
3.0,"Glasses are more for dress-up/Halloween/theatre, as opposed to a pair you could wear regularly anf pass off as legitimate glasses. They are thick and the lenses have a pinkish hue to them, which I wasn’t expecting. Very distinct pair of specs, just not what I thought they’d be."
3.0,this is pretty and very nice.  but one thing I would not have thought about is rain collects in the grooves and may cause rust later.
3.0,"This just didn't fit right for me. The neck hole was too wide so my bra straps were showing. The waist was a bit high and the skirt too short for my liking. It just didn't give me a great shape, either. The material was a thicker t-shirt like fabric, and I liked that. The grey was a nice color, not too light, a good medium heathered gray. This dress just didn't hang right and didn't have enough pop for me to keep it."
3.0,Looked good at first but red color has faded quickly.
3.0,"Cute jeans but way too big... too big in waist hips and length. Although I am 5'1"" and 100 lbs. But still.  For the price the size small is really big!!"
3.0,"I liked,but wish it was stitched at ends so it won't tray after time."
3.0,"I like the fit and they are comfortable. The purple is more of a wine color.<br />The navy blue pair I received had darker splotches on the back (like the dye was uneven) and a hole in the front thigh area. I'm returning them for replacements, hoping the next ones are better quality."
3.0,"Definitely go up two or three sizes! Shorts are comfortable, but they run small."
3.0,"I purchased this skirt for Christmas after buying several other skirts that didn't work out. This is exactly what I had in mind and it worked out. Originally ordered the 2X, but it was a little tight so I went up to a 3X. Runs a little small, but overall not a bad skirt."
3.0,They don’t stay anywhere at sll
3.0,"Didn’t realize the cords are printed on the case, not very attractive."
3.0,Fit not good
3.0,"The right slipper arrived with a small tear. It's just a thin layer of leather in the back. I've seen UGG's in stores and have found better made ones, but these are lighter and don't feel as premium as I was hoping. The made in China tags aren't helping either. I paid less than fifty for these and returned them. I would never have paid a hundred for them."
3.0,"From the picture, I thought these were actually stitched, but they are a cheap print.  I returned them, they are definitely not worth the money!"
3.0,"The color is not as vibrant as the picture and it was too tight, even though I sized up. So disappointed."
3.0,I really wanted to like these sandals. They are very bulky. Fit as expected and comfortable (after you get used to the squishy sole) but they are quite big looking
3.0,"There is a bar inside the hat that pokes the top of your head. It’s really not for wearing it’s more for magic tricks or something else besides wearing. It looks really good though, it’s just not comfortable with the bar inside."
3.0,The quality of the earrings seem good for now. But the picture of the model with the earnings on makes them look much smaller then they are in person.
3.0,"No what I was expecting. Definitely cut for slimmer built people. Bought extra large, fits as large. Fabric is not what you expect for active wear, its stiff and kind of scratchy."
3.0,mens glasses need to be a littel smaller
3.0,I liked this wristlet until it broke! I only got one or two uses out of it.
3.0,I would say short body ladies should steer clear but well made and nice.
3.0,I ordered 2 sizes larger than I normally would and the suit fits fine. I was disappointed that the quality wasn’t better. The plastic boning was already coming out of the top when I tried it on..😭 I guess you get what you pay for. I wouldn’t order this again.
3.0,The top is a bright red with no contrast colored stitching. Falsely advertised. Don't bother buying the red one. It's wearable though and is flattering.
3.0,Material is cheap feeling & the bottom snap will NOT stay snapped
3.0,"Somewhat shapeless fit, needs more tapering at waist."
3.0,"These are good quality gloves, but the size small had fingers that were very long. I will have to exchange these."
3.0,"Flimsy, will not be using them after first use"
3.0,It really fits snug for an XLarge when I usually wear Large. I'm definitely glad I read the reviews and ordered one size up. Quality is ok. Not as nice as the black and blue one I ordered earlier. Love the length and so nice to wear with leggings.
3.0,"I am not happy  since I received this watch, because the watch is not same as picture shown. It does not have wording &#34;JAPAN MOVT&#34; on surface"
3.0,Frame Quality is not good
3.0,"Bought both a small single and medium double. Length is the same on both, although “panty” part is slightly narrower on the small. Fabric is nice. We’ll see how they hold up and I can update."
3.0,"This is the type of outfit you wear once, then throw away. Meaning: Save a few dollars and purchase from the US. The material doesn't look like the knitted look as in the pic. When you receive the item, the colors seem more....immature if I can use this word? Kind of cartoonish? The material is not knit but like a screen overlay graphic....I wore it when I went out, and it was bodycon, but I dont know. I don't know if I'd wear it again. Something to think about...If it's cheap, there is a reason."
3.0,These shoes seemed big for the size but you can tighten them with the string on the ankle.  They looked long and narrow and are much cuter in the picture.  On my grandsons feet they looked a little funny but he didn't care.
3.0,"I bought these to have them in the hallway for my toddler, because we don't walk barefoot there...<br />It serves the purpose for walking there, but I cannot imagine my son walk outside in it. He would fall immediately. They simply do not stay on little toddler foot."
3.0,"I ordered the white and black one but somehow ended up with the plaid one. The dress is cute on top but the bottom is extremely poofy. The fabric is thick but cheap, which is fair enough for 30 bucks. Haven't decided if I'm going to keep it or send it back."
3.0,"These are a fun idea, but they aren't that well made. Quite a few of them fell apart and we hadn't even used them yet. They are bright lights, though."
3.0,From the picture I thought this T-shirt was more of a slouchy look. It was very clingy and long like a tube and I could not get it to lay right with any bottoms I paired it with.<br />I’m a medium and the medium fit fine just an odd cut. Not flattering on an hourglass shape
3.0,It's super cute but it's far too large for my adult female face.
3.0,"Green 2 is NOT the same as the other dresses and all run small.<br />Print is exactly what I wanted, but the dress does not fit the same as the other styles. Unfortunately, this dress is not the same structure or material as the other dresses. It has no elastic at the waist and the material has no give. Also, the top is cut very, very low and gaps.<br />I wanted to love this dress and make it work because the print is perfect, but it is not the same as the other Milumia dresses.<br />Also, all sizes run very small. I am normally a small, but I had to size up to a medium."
3.0,Received this belt and it had these white marks on it that wouldn’t come off... very difficult to unbuckle the belt..
3.0,Definitely too big for a woman. ok for halloween maybe :)
3.0,"The size was too small, so buttons pulled out leaving it wide open and ugly.  I had to sew the thing togerther to make it work."
3.0,"I love the quality of these pants! They are super soft and very high quality. I've never worn Lulu so I cannot compare, but they are definitely amazing leggings! My only complains are the length and overall fit. I am strictly a Medium in literally every pair of pants I've owned in the past 15 years. These actually fit a little large and I find myself pulling them up every half hour or so. I could try and order a Small, but with my luck they will be just a tad too small. Also, they are advertised as cropped leggings. I am 5'4 and usually wear a 27"" inseam pant and these fit like ankle leggings on me. I can pull them up a little bit, but it awkwardly bunches at the bottom if I do that.  If I don't pull them up, the bottoms aren't tight on my calves and stick out a little bit. I've had the same length issue with other 90 Degree ""cropped"" leggings I bought at the same time as these ones. Overall love the material and pockets (fits my iPhone XR with case!) and I'm lazy enough not to exchange them. Next time I may size down in 90 Degree leggings."
3.0,Please refer to the size chart provided. The 2XL fit like a 1XL or a lose L it was too small.
3.0,Super cute and my daughter loves them but the backs do not look as pictured. They are just regular earring backs
3.0,don't fit great (kind of lopsided) but they are soft and cute
3.0,"This is not a sweatshirt, it is a shirt. It looks like a bulky sweatshirt but I was very disappointed to find that it is simply a thin long sleeved shirt sewn to look like a sweatshirt. Very misleading"
3.0,Nice dress but not for the price. Cheap material
3.0,"Did not fit. I ordered an XS as i always do, was big, retured."
3.0,This was a cute top but it is to short for my daughter.  Black lace at the top.  Stitched at the bottom.  Racer back adjustable straps over the shoulders.  Lightweight.  This top would look nice under a jacket.  The length is to short for her however.
3.0,its ok. wouldn't purchase again.
3.0,To big for my taste.
3.0,"Fit in the shoulders and chest but was not fitted at all through the mid section like it is in the picture. It was more of a straight up and down cut, instead of narrowing in the mid section. Also, make sure to notice that this shirt is spandex, stretchy, material. It will shrink in dryer, which helped me get it to fit better. I usually wear large, bought this as a large, and was too big."
3.0,Looks great but pin holding the clasp together on one side fell out day 2 and the replacement it comes had no threads on the ends.
3.0,"Nice , soft and comfortable  if you order a size larger than usual.  Had to send first one back."
3.0,I returned these. Very thin. Not best quality
3.0,"Suited my needs, my son wore it for 1/2 hour photo shoot. It is pretty cheaply made and the seam started to come undone by the time we got home.... but for $11 and the fact that he probably wont wear it again I'm satisfied. Sure beats spending $50 on Etsy for something he'd wear for 30 minutes."
3.0,"I like the quality of the jewelry, especially for the  price. The one thing i didnt like was the 12 inch chain. I didnt see a measurement and assumed it was 18 inch. Too much hastle to return so some luck little girl will be getting a necklace"
3.0,no complaints here. they did their job and kept my arms warm while running in chicago in the winter. Id order another pair.
3.0,I am not sure of donating this item to my charity or RETURN them.<br /><br />The item was supposed to be WIDE WIDTH but these in my view are not. They in my view are narrow and I cannot put them on in comfort. In other words I cannot wear them at all.
3.0,"I love this dress. I purchased one in blue and one in purple. I washed them together, gentle cycle of drumless top loader, and unfortunately, the purple one fell apart in the wash. I may order another because the fit and color are perfect. The blue one is fine but I will hand wash from now on."
3.0,"The dress is cute and fits decently, although I recommend wearing a slip. The fabric is slippery and clingy in a way that doesn't do service to the intended style."
3.0,"Nice hat, wish it was designed for larger adult head sizes."
3.0,They are very fragile and ten to pop.
3.0,"I bought this to wear on the weekends for easy bike rides or yoga. I only gave it 3 stars b/c it does look pretty cheap but hey- it was cheap. I think I paid less than $3 for it. So for $3 I really like it. I am pretty sure that I got a small. It is a looser fit, not clingy, but not baggy either."
3.0,I really like the style and the cozy comfortable fit. The material is soft and warm and a super loose nit design. The downside is the arms wanted to fray after only one day of use. I also think the design would be improved with some deep pockets. Overall the quality is not as good as I expected. But it looks good on and I hope it stays in shape without more fraying.
3.0,"The t-shirt looked soooo cute in the picture, but I was very disappointed with what I received.<br /><br />I ordered a size large (my usual for a relaxed fit) and it’s very tight.  It’s only wearable because the material is so thin and stretchy.  The manufacturer says to refer to the size chart, but no size chart was provided.<br /><br />Speaking of material…the material is very thin.  The shirt is only wearable because it’s black.  If it was a light color, it would be see-through.  At this price, I wouldn’t buy this."
3.0,"Everything looks great on these, but they are heavy. I couldn't wear them because they were pulling my earlobes so much."
3.0,I ordered the recommended size but the bottoms were long. The were essentially a high wasted string bikini. I wasn’t a fan. The top fit fine. Returned
3.0,Did not dislike top.  The fit was too snug for me.
3.0,These fit fine but don't like the material.
3.0,"This is a cute dress BUT as soon as I took it out of the package I couldn’t believe how sheer it is. You could read a book through it. If you have any tattoos, they will show up under this dress. You HAVE to wear a slip or everyone will see everything. It’s a shame it’s made out of such poor material."
3.0,Nice material but a little small per chart.
3.0,Too large for me thanks.
3.0,Okay piece
3.0,"I guess for the price  I can't complain,but they were very dull,even after proper cleaning ,they were not very &#34;Blingy&#34;"
3.0,"I purchased these because the description described them as Red...however they are orange..<br />Pretty earrings, very unique but not what I thought they were....<br />Will keep them just because they're funky.....disappointed"
3.0,Fit is tight by the end of the dsy cant wait to take it off
3.0,"I had a very hard time breathing in this mask - even when removing the removable filter. Also, since this has masks that fit around your head (instead of around your ears), one strap just hung on the back of my neck because the mask was too tall for my face. This might work better for someone with a wider of longer face structure, but they do not work well for me."
3.0,The pearl is very large and it's a unique setting. It's a gift for a fiend who never had pearl jewlery. I wished it had come with a certificate of authenticity - like is was pictured with the product. Even a tiny card would have done. Also no box for necklace.<br /><br />I will not give it as gift as intended.
3.0,Waist was way way too small.  Will be returning.  Length was perfect for my 34 inch inseam.
3.0,"Cute style,  shorter in length than I expected, ran a little small.  Bought as a first communion dress for my daughter who does not like to dress up."
3.0,"So beautiful!, not to tight and not bad quality."
3.0,Cute designsthe fabric is just to thin for my taste
3.0,"Frustrating when the main sock fits very well and is relatively comfortable, but the tops roll down immediately upon putting them on."
3.0,"Dress was super cute! Fabric seemed  perfect for hot summers. I loved the flow of the skirt. Issues: Dress seemed to have been tried on before hand, arrived unbuttoned at the waist/thigh area...and the previous customer might have damaged product. Upon opening the package, instantly noticed the string from the tassel “belt” was unraveled (where the string met waistband). Also, there was something odd about those strings on the smocked waistband. Feels a bit like the tassels were added as an afterthought.<br />Also be aware that the color is not red, nor coral, but most definitely an orange-hue.<br />Cut of dress would be really flattering on anyone."
3.0,"My daughter really liked them, but after about 30 minutes of wearing them, she would complain they were hurting her ear lobes and we would take them off. Inevitably, one side was always coming off. Cute idea, but we decided to just pierce her ears."
3.0,My teenage daughter had the first pair for less than a year. They ended up breaking on the metal decorative piece by the hinge. Bought this replacement pair which broke in the same place in a few months.
3.0,Necklace was made of plastic. Did not expect it to be made of plastic.
3.0,Cute socks but they show under my kids native and Tom shoes. They’re no show on her athletic shoes (Pumas) so that’s something. The fabric is thin but sufficient enough. I don’t expect them to last more than a few months though.
3.0,Nice looking. Band is a bit difficult to secure
3.0,I purposely bought these for the navy blue mask to match my daughters sports uniform and it did not come with blue as advertised. It came with 3 black and one gray.
3.0,A very pretty and stylish item... accept that it’s kept catching on my hair!<br /><br />Every time I moved my head it would pull my hair!<br /><br />I ended up wrapping it around my wrist or my belt loop.<br /><br />If you have long hair I would not recommend this at all.
3.0,Not as cute in person as in the picture. The gems on the single tassels are ugly.
3.0,I ordered two sizes up and i'm glad I did cause some areas fit exact and some were loose. I just went and got it taken in. Feathers shed though. And the buttons wouldn't stay closed so my mom sewed a piece of fabric to keep the neck part together since that's basically what's holding up the dress.
3.0,I’m not in love with this dress. It’s cute and I wanted to love it.  I kept it but didn’t wear it. I wear a size 14. I have broad shoulders and a 2xl fits me. Maybe I’ll wear it. Call me wish-washy!
3.0,"These tops were a bit misleading in the “one size fits all” category. My girlfriend bought 2 of these and they looked so good on her I had to buy one for myself. However, the one I got did not have adjustable straps so it was really tight under my armpits and came up high above my belly button. I am 5’4” 130lbs and I cannot wear this comfortably. My friends had adjustable straps but mine didn’t so I have to return. Wish we knew which ones were adjustable or not!"
3.0,Great belt. Consider making it without the Velcro. I had to cut the belt down to fit my 32&#34; waist. This eliminated the Velcro completely.
3.0,The shirts were a little smaller than I expected them to be.
3.0,"I bought one of these belts a few years ago and have been very happy with it.  I recently noticed it was beginning to show some wear, which is not surprising after a few years.  Anyway, I bought a replacement, and as is common these days, it's evident that corners have been cut to save money and increase profits.  The belt material is a little lighter, maybe a little narrower, and definitely shorter in length.  In addition, the buckle is made of a lighter weight material than the original.  Still a decent product, but not as good as the original.  I see on the Bison website that they offer a Grateful Dead line.  I was thinking of gift shopping for some Deadhead friends, but I'm having second thoughts due to the reduction in quality."
3.0,Took over a month to get here (China).  Should have known.  Can't get the charms or whatever they are called to all go the same direction in order to wear it properly so probably won't ever get to wear it.
3.0,This was the second time I ordered this for my wife the last one was a 2x it was way to small so we tried going up to a 4x it is snug on her she normally wears a XL. These hoodies are in asian sizes so be careful wife still loves it.
3.0,"The quality is amazingly satisfying and it came super early however, though it was a Large it fit like a Small."
3.0,The shirt is huge to big for me. But it's beautiful just like the picture. If you are big breasted this shirt is made for you
3.0,Need to reorder in a different size to give it another chance
3.0,It is lightweight piece. No lining. Looks unfinished. The collar looks to be a Shaw type but is not. Washed nicely.
3.0,"Very Cool coloring book, but would be nice to see a color picture to understand everything."
3.0,"I got these as a silly gift for my boyfriend and was super excited about these... until they arrived. I got a size L but unfortunately they seem to run a bit small and I doubt that they will even fit him... the quality isn't the best and the foam inside was exposed (it seems that somehow the inside seam may have ripped a bit). Too bad that the restocking fee is about half of what I paid for, so it doesn't seem to make much sense to return them.. If they end up not fitting him I'll just wear them for however long they'll last. These are adorable though... if the sizing was a bit larger and the quality a bit better they would have been a great gift.<br />I received his product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
3.0,I’m 5’10” 170 lbs and bought a L. It’s a size too small....that’s what happens though when you buy cheap no name brand. Save your money and don’t waste it on this.
3.0,Kinda thin more of a spring or autumn outfit
3.0,"The romper says long, but isn't very much longer than the calf length ones. Maybe a couple inches. So, it's kinda in that weird area.......is it long enough, does it look weird? Otherwise, it fits ok. I kept it, but was disappointed with the length. I'm a taller person and have trouble finding any pants, maxi dresses, and rompers that are long enough."
3.0,Wish it was a little bit bigger. Might’ve shrank it myself though.
3.0,"Love the shoes and good quality but they are not true to size.  It says US size 11, but they are at best size 10.5.  It is a shame.  They are beautiful shoes and I would've LOVED to keep these.  The leather is soft and they seem to be comfortable if they were true to US size.  If you have a smaller foot, these are a great buy.  If you are an 11, then these are not for you......what a shame."
3.0,I would order a size larger than what you normally wear.
3.0,"I have worn the pink band for about 2-3 weeks now and it has turned color around the edges and on the band so it looks dirty.  I have tried several things to clean it with no success.  Also, the bands are not as pliable as the original fitbit brand but for the price that isn't a huge issue."
3.0,"Based on the other review, ordered  the Large. The Large is too small. I am 5'7"" and 180. Normally fit size 14. It is snug across my chest, and not long enough to completely cover my butt. The fabric is fairly sheer. The skirt is not flowing as pictured. I think I will work over leggings or a skirt. The print is cute."
3.0,"This dress is really cute HOWEVER, it is not ballet pink although that is what it says when you choose color before putting in the cart.... It is more of an orange pink. I was really disappointed in the color. I really needed the dress, so didn't return it. Had i had more time, I would have definitely returned due to the color NOT being true ballet pink......."
3.0,"I have ordered several pairs of the pants and seems the same size is never the same.  I've tried it in different colors and different sizes (approximately six pairs and I've only kept one-and I love them).  The small short in one case was two inches longer than a medium/regular.  I kept a pair of M/M black that fit nicely.  I want a pair of the gray but have tried a couple different ones and they did not fit the same.  I'm going to give it one more try and then I'm done.  Good thing Amazon has free returns on these pants or I would have returned all of them in the beginning and given up.  And they all say they are made in Vietnam so they aren't even made in different countries which might explain it.  Have to assume they are made in different factories.  Looks like Columbia would give them sizing and with some quality control, make sure they stuck to it."
3.0,previous reviews stated order down a size as they ran large .... I did and it fits just a tad tighter that I prefer in a maxi dress<br />but love the color and the way its made and not so tight I'd go up a size
3.0,"Had a lot of compliments, but way too  tight. I ordered a large. Have to wear a jacket with it  so my rolls don’t show lol"
3.0,"Same day shipping was great! B U T...before I even tried it on, the dress had a spot/stane on the back. Supper bummed out that I have to return it, such a pretty dress."
3.0,"They're nice, but they were not pinstripe."
3.0,"See pics. Has all the ""similar"" VCA markings, (but not exactly same as ones from the stores) .<br /><br />I can't tell what the metal is made out of. So if you're not sensitive to with metal, this is great!<br /><br />(not diamond per diamond tester - as expected)"
3.0,The undies were really small and didn't fit my 11 year old. The cup was fine though.
3.0,"It says not cheap material, your princess will not destroy it easy ...and... after first use it looks weird. Otherwise they are warm!must be cheaper"
3.0,Some workout leggings are flattering and suck everything in ... These are not those. Good quality though.
3.0,"The fit all the way until just passed my knee… if your thighs are larger 22” around - forget it. These will not fit. They are however, super nice, soft, and I believe they would be comfortable if they actually fit. Hope this helps!"
3.0,necklace itself is very thin... charm is pretty small
3.0,The shirt was soft and it looks exactly like in the photo. I was hoping this was a case where it didn’t. I found the pattern of the shirt to take away from the image. I didn’t care for them together and sent them back.
3.0,This is the second time I have ordered these flag pins. The first time everything was perfect. I love the way these flag pins look and they attach firmly to my lapel. This second batch still looks amazing. However the back of the pins now have this small protruding peg that makes it much harder for pin backer to be attached. What's up with that? Left over from manufacturing process?
3.0,"The tie is a slightly different color than what I expected but it is still a nice tie nonetheless. The tie is very cheap material and not your typical sturdy, durable type of type. An upside is that it is skinny, making it look sleek and modern. Overall, not a great tie material wise, but it looks great."
3.0,It was more form fitting than expected
3.0,Comfortable wearing but too big.  It does protect your shoes so that's good!
3.0,It's comfy.. I'd recommend to hand wash or on a gentle cycle... I washed it with like similar colors in a normal cycle and it ruined the fabric. It had a bunch of lint balls on it now. It's a lil big.. I'm tall 5'9 and it's still long almost to the knee... Not cute.. only wore it once... Donating it to Goodwill
3.0,"I love the pattern and the fit of this dress on top, but it's WAY too short. I'm 5'7&#34; 145lbs, and I purchased size M. It is shorter in the back, so I can't see myself being able to wear this unless it's with leggings. I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the length."
3.0,"They’re really pretty and as pictured, but the posts are really short. They squeezed my son’s lobes enough to cause irritation and maybe a slight infection over the couple weeks he wore them. Recommend for thin loved or inconsistent wearing. It’s not something you would want to keep in long term."
3.0,Material doesn't hold up.  Does not like to be washed.  Each one has faded and balled up.<br />At first....I loves them.  It was over time... That I fell out of love!
3.0,"Not as sturdy as expected, will not hold in bulges"
3.0,"Sweat pants just arrived and was anxious to try them on.  I sized up and probably didn't need to. Ordered XL but a large would have sufficed.  I did it incase they shrink.  They are comfy and the material feels nice, but the quality is lacking.  Not the best sweat material, and whoever sewed this or QC'd it was drunk- the stitching is coming apart as is right out of the package.  Might update after actual wear and wash."
3.0,They are tiny and thin but cute for a younger girl. I won't be able to wear them after all but decided to keep them to maybe give as a gift.
3.0,"Nice material and overall design, strange placement of the zipper pockets, I'm 6' 1"" and I ordered the 3XL and it was almost like a 1XL, had to give it away."
3.0,I loved that bag
3.0,"Its ok but...I thought the string was to go around your chin..instead it is in the rim of the hat..I guess if your head is too big or small thats helpful. So when I cut grass on my rider lawn mower and have a branch hit my hat it flies off were as if I had the string around my chin the hat would stay on...but the hat looks ok keeps the sun and bugs off my head and fits fine other than that...I just thought it would have a chin drawstring, not a string to size the inner size of the hat."
3.0,the engravable area is only enough for initials not a word......I wanted it to say &#34;Grampy&#34; for my father in law but the space wasn't large enough.  It turned out when I took it to my local engraver they had the same piece for less.
3.0,This dress for being an XL was very very small fitting.
3.0,"From what I can tell, the SB SOX Lite Compression Socks are good quality.  They arrived promptly & in excellent condition.  My 3-star rating is based on size.  The socks I ordered are several inches too long for me--clearly not intended for people with short/muscular calves.  The foot is 3&#34; too long--something I would try to deal with, but they come to my upper knee and are uncomfortable, likely unsafe, rolled down.  My calf measurement falls slightly above the small/medium so I selected large/x-large. I wear a women's size 9 to 9.5 med shoe, the low end of the 9.5 - 14+ range of the large/x-large listed on the box of compression socks.  I will wash & donate these long tall socks.  I will continue to search for medium/large socks that better fit my size range."
3.0,Tarnish easily
3.0,"This is a great, lightweight hoodie but runs at least two sizes too big."
3.0,The color was nice. Size was smaller than expected
3.0,I prefer a zippered closing
3.0,"The package arrived in good time. I ordered a size 10 for my 9 year old son, 56 lbs and 4 feet 1 inch tall..they were too wide n the waist. The material is good and thick"
3.0,"Size up, runs really small"
3.0,Came way smaller than a 7. More like a 5 so I would size up. But they are cute
3.0,"I love this dress, however its too small. I always order up a size or two, but this was too tight in the chest and didnt flow like i had hoped. I had to send back :("
3.0,Bought for my fiance because he gets earaches when it's cold. He can't even use it because there's no cable for it.
3.0,"Super cute design, but extremely hard to bend in order to get a nice snug fit."
3.0,cute belts but too large for my waist and no way to adjust
3.0,I love the bras. They are cute and comfy but I do suggest going up a size in the band and in the cup. Definitely if these are going to be for what you pack in your hospital bag. These are snug and I can only imagine how they are going to fit when my milk comes in. Other than that. Definitely a good purchase!
3.0,"It rides so high under the breast that it is uncomfortable, kept pulling it down.  If the high waist of it were more comfortable it would be a great night gown."
3.0,Cute suit but if you are large busted there is not enough room. I am a D cup and the cups are too small.
3.0,I love the design bit the shirt doted alittle snug. I should've read other reviews before ordering a small. Must order a size larger
3.0,The material is very thin.  They fit fine but I am curious to see how well they hold up over time; maybe bamboo wears longer than cotton.
3.0,"The 2-pack of neck gaiters came today, and, when I took them out of the packaging to wash, I noticed that one of them had a band of sticky ""stuff"" on it.  This one is totally useless."
3.0,Sunglasses looked & felt great. The only negative was one of the rubber covers for the ear stems fell off.
3.0,Super cute! I think it runs about 2 sizes smaller.
3.0,"The pendant is lovely, BUT the chain was knotted and looked cheap.  I would return it if I didn’t already have another and better looking chain to use.  Delivering a knotted chain is simply unacceptable!"
3.0,i ordered a size medium thinking it would be true to size. fit more like a small small .. order size up!!
3.0,"Basically what the title says, it's got some decent stretch to it so when you put it on unless you have your watch on your ankle it's not going to fit your wrist, I ended up disassembling it all together and using the watch attachment parts to create my own watch band"
3.0,"These are very small and fingers are very short. My hands felt like they were suffocating. If you like longer nails, these will be very uncomfortable. I bought the L and it fit like an M. If they were larger, I would not have returned. The overall appearance is super cool."
3.0,They should have in between sizes.
3.0,"ITS HUGE!!!  Not what I was expecting.  Its ok because I am using it to mark my extra keys.  If it was a gift, LOL!!, I would be embarrassed to gift it."
3.0,So it's a very cute outfit but the pants didn't fit as expected.
3.0,Center ball broke off within a week.
3.0,"No llego en el color esperado, lo pedí en color negro y llego gris... aun así me lo quede<br />Tampoco es el largo que se mira en la foto"
3.0,got the Large size...fit well. Sizes runs small.
3.0,Cute jacket but fits very small! Order like 2 sizes too big and you might be ok.
3.0,Chain is very cheap -- don't expect this to last long. Son loved it for a birthday gift and is thankfully small wristed enough to not need the adjustable chain -- the smallest link only -- the remainder of the chain took no time in breaking off.
3.0,The underlining at the bust area is too short.
3.0,love the bracelet and wear often - have not worn the earings yet as I just don't wear earings frequently. The necklace is long and I have worn once. Went to put on the other day for a 2nd time and the clasp broke - not happy on that. Clasp on necklace was already stiff and had to be pushed back in place - lobster claw clasp. will keep and replace clasp.
3.0,"Cute, cheap necklace. It won’t last more than two months if you wear it twice a week. If you wear it once a week or once every two weeks it might last a full two months. It isn’t heavy."
3.0,"Runs 1/2- 1 size Large, is 95% polyester,  has red marking dots on fabric where the seamstress missed the marks. Extremely thin see through fabric. The drawstring is cheap cord and there is a lot of it, down to your knees. Not what I expected for almost $40."
3.0,"The pair of earrings seem to be of decent quality. However, I was disappointed when I opened the box. The metal pieces that dangle are not straight, they are curved. The dangling metal pieces bend IN towards and your neck and OUT towards your chin. I would have preferred if the metal pieces were straight and not curved, as it looks in the seller photo."
3.0,I am very petite 5’3 and 98 pounds and I ordered a small and it is just to big in the waist
3.0,"I ordered a medium, expecting it to be a little loose since I normally wear a small. Not so. It creates this weird bulge on the sides because of how the band is designed. Although probably not a problem for those who describe themselves as &#34;toned.&#34; :)"
3.0,The kimono was definitely to small. I wear extra large and this kimono didn't even fit around my waist which is a 38size. I weigh 197 and am 5'8&#34; tall. I have to return but there were no instructions or vendor information with the package .
3.0,The scandal seemed very loose. I wear a size 12 and have never put a pair on that felt like my foot was not entirely secured. However these felt that way. I have been wearing reef sandals for 10 years and will continue to buy because of how long they last.
3.0,Just way too large!
3.0,These are fairly thin - I was looking for a thicker lining.
3.0,"Very cute shoes, but you can tell they were not expensive to make. I have worn them three or four times for whole days at a time and everything seems to still be in good condition though, so no complaints about the workmanship. Did leave blisters on my heals where the zipper rubbed between my heel and ankle. But still super cute."
3.0,They come big so order in a size smaller they drink as well and it really wasn't worth the price
3.0,"This was a XXL and it was way to small for the size it should be. I really like the style and the blouse color and fabric, the size is misleading."
3.0,"The shirt I received came under a different name, &#34;Zenana Signature&#34;.  It looks exactly like the one in the picture and the color looks the same.  I ordered an Beige, XL.  It fits perhaps how a US size 14-16 would fit, with average arm length?  Fabric feels nice, but is thin.  I will be returning because it is too big for me."
3.0,Pretty dress but runs too big.
3.0,"The product is nice but is not what I ordered. I ordered color black misses size 12. What came in the mail is color navy blue, petite size 12. I decided to keep it but will not order clothes on Amazon again."
3.0,"I love burts need, but these just weren't great"
3.0,"They are cheap and they price and workmanship match. I did find them useful to have on hand for an outdoor concert where it rained and I was able to have extra to give to friends which went to good use. As others have noted the neck hole is small such that it is hard to have the hood up and covering your head because there isn't enough material give. Also, one of them I opened had a large rip down the side which I think was just a manifacturing defect. But, holes in a poncho are less than desirable. They definitely served the purpose I wanted them for and were adequate for the price but you will likely get 1, maybe 2 uses out of them. I think having them on hand for outdoor concerts is reasonable so you don't have to spend 5-10x as much to buy the ones at the venue.<br /><br />Edit- I received an email offering me a partial refund shortly after this review as the ponchos didn't meet my needs completely. I thought that was a nice gesture."
3.0,"These jeans are super cute, however I gave it 3 stars because of the zipper. The zipper won't stay up. I looked at u tube to see how to keep a zipper up. I have a class reunion  this weekend, I only hope that these jeans last until the nights over."
3.0,Looks great but the ratchet wont hold and keeps slipping.
3.0,"Soft but runs small, get two size up. I usually wear a small and should have got a large"
3.0,The detailing of the print was not as neat as i would have liked. I’m actually sending back for a refund.
3.0,We were missing one of the earrings other than that they were fine. Packing was ok.
3.0,Cool design but the chain is weak. Broke after 20 mins of wearing at home.
3.0,For young thin woman
3.0,Not how shown in the picture. I will still wear it but I was expecting what I saw in the picture. If you don’t wanna be disappointed then I suggest you pass on this one
3.0,It's a 5 and she's a small 4yr. old so she won't get much wear out it.
3.0,"I normally wear a size 11, and they were way to small. The toe box is also too small. I have a wider foot but these still felt too small. The fur lining is comfortable, but the backs of my heels fall out of the shoes when I walk up stairs because the top tongue does not come far enough up the shoe. Also, the placement of the drawstring seems to be a bit too forward (toward the toe). I'm returning them and looking for something else."
3.0,i'm 5.9 tall and weight 150 lb usually wears us medium on tops and 32 in pants.<br /><br />i ordered US Medium from these boxers<br /><br />what i like:<br />the fitting is perfect<br />it looks so hot (your girl will definitely like it ;)<br />the quality is nice<br /><br />what i don't like<br />the colors combination (the phosphoric colors kinda make it look cheap) and this is personal can differ from one to other<br />the fabric makes me hot under a sharp sun and doesn't absorb all the sweats.<br /><br />overall its a good deal regarding the price.
3.0,"The ring that's attached to lobster clasp and the charm wasn't soldered and the clasp came off the ring through the tiny gap. They need to do a better job with their workmanship, otherwise the charm itself is quite nice."
3.0,It's a little shorter than I thought.
3.0,"Really cute skirt. The length was relatively decent; compared to the model in the picture, the skirt came down just slightly past my knees. I thought it was a very flattering skirt and the material was nice/comfortable. I was slightly concerned about the material being a little see-through, but it was difficult to tell how see-through it would have been. I would have kept it except the waist was a wee bit too small (this is rather surprising since I'm fairly petite and most clothing items that are marked as Small are usually too big). I had trouble getting this past my hips without a whole lot of shimmying and gentle coaxing of the material."
3.0,The glasses are sturdy but the glasses are too small and it makes your eyes look bigger than they should actually appear.
3.0,"This jeans we're very cute and we'll made but the size is nowhere close to the side of the jeans. I ordered two sizes larger than normal for my daughter per advice in reviews. She usually wears a medium to large. I ordered a 2x. They won't even pull up above her thighs. She loved them and if they had fit, they would have been well worth the price. We were both really disappointed."
3.0,The mandrel has 2 measurements per side. The ring gauges are based on Hong Kong size. I wish it would have stated that. They are ok.
3.0,They fit OK but the cut is too small and revealing.
3.0,Cute but somewhat see through material.
3.0,"Cute dress.  Comfortable to wear.  Stretch fabric gives the bias-cut.<br /><br />Manufacturing quality, however, isn’t great.  I wore this dress once for work.  I hung it up.  Several days later, I went to steam it (packing wrinkles never fell out), & found that the upper skirt ruffle was separated from the serged seam.<br /><br />Due to the type of fabric, it is fraying when I attempted to mend it.<br /><br />I may end up using it as a pattern to remake this dress, since I like the overall style."
3.0,Got 4t for my son expecting it to be big to still have next year but it fits like a 3t
3.0,However there is a reason they don't take a picture of the back of the necklace . . .
3.0,"While rain gauge is as shown it is poorly made as both plastic gauge is loosely fitted, leans and wobbles and the umbrella does the same.  I'm sure it would blow away with wind.  Needs work to make it work correctly."
3.0,"The inside/underneath part of this band is white.  I kinda wish it was all black. The white makes it look cheap.  With that said, its a cool design and its soft and comfortable.  It is perfect for my needs.<br /><br />I took a pic of how the band folds in, its kinda neat."
3.0,I was disappointed. I didn't realize it was sheer.
3.0,"They're a bit flimsy, but kind of what you expect for the price."
3.0,"These would be great with the exception that the balls that screw on will NOT stay screwed on. I have tried everything, even using needle nose pliers to tighten, but they keep falling off. After wearing them for less than a day I have lost 6 little balls. Maybe I received a bad batch."
3.0,Very roomy & clingy!
3.0,The fabric is thinner than expected so I decided to return the joggers.
3.0,I am true size 6.  They are quite short for me (5'9&#34;) and the waist does not have much give (no elastic or buttons) but<br />I like the flow of it.
3.0,"For a ballet sweater, it isn’t very form fitting.  The fabric doesn’t hug as tightly as I would like, and it feels cheap.  The ballet shoe accent is cute though."
3.0,"I got these for pregnancy edema and I work in nursing the foot section fits perfectly for my size, but the leg section is way tight. My fiance had to help me put them on because they're so tight. Once on they do their job, but left marks on my calves."
3.0,"Bought a small for a photo shoot and the top wrapped strangely as it was way too big.  In the product photo, the dress appears to tie in the front but there was no way to make that happen because it was so big so we ended up wrapping it in the back.  Even with a larger chest, it would've been way too big although the top may have looked more normal.  The bottom flows beautifully, though."
3.0,"I ended up returning this shirt. It fit fine but it was very different than I expected from the picture. All those buttons! Buttons, buttons, buttons, and more buttons. Definitely not my style."
3.0,acceptable and timely delivered
3.0,Boxing not very nice for the product. Chain small but over all quality of pendent is nice
3.0,Cut slim except for the sleeves which could have fit two arms inside them
3.0,"I DON'T KNOW IF I NEED TO RETURN THE WINDER OR NOT YET, I WILL FOLLOW UP. I have a large wrist and most of my watches are on bracelets. This winder is not able to fit bracelets adjusted for an 8"" wrist. either they need to supply larger pillows or warn the customers before they purchase the winder."
3.0,"The fabric, fit, and quality are not nearly as nice as the picture.  I didn't return it in time, so I'm either stuck with it or will donate it, but don't recommend buying unless slightly itchy fabric and uncomfortable fits don't bother you.  Beautiful color, though."
3.0,"The plugs are lovely, but the black silicone o-rings are a little too big; I have lost nearly all of them and when I bought replacements, they fit much better."
3.0,"I was bummed, this was too large for my wrist buy maybe it was made for a man's wrist. Other than that It's a nice bracelet and made well."
3.0,The fabric was nice and the colors of the print looked good. I ordered a size up from my normal size though and it was still way too small.
3.0,These feel very strange when on.  I love gardening but I will stick to my shovel and rake when weeding.  This just doesn’t work well for me.
3.0,Quality good.  Runs small.
3.0,They just fit her. She is very skinny and I would recommend ordering a size up. She likes them but I wish they were a little bit bigger on her.
3.0,The outfit was really pretty but it was too big I usually wear extra large I could have went a medium but to be on the safe side I will have gotten a large I end up giving it to my sister I am 5'9 I wait 215 lb but thick in all all the right places but it still was big so down size ladies it's stretchy real pretty I ordered a different pattern same company and in a large and it fitted me really well I could have really went medium but wanted to play it safe
3.0,Took forever to ship but they were cheap so you get what you pay for!
3.0,"I got the size I always get, I'm small, and they fit like a large would. Soft material."
3.0,cute & sturdy-ish
3.0,Pretty color! It's t shirt like. The front is very pretty with the ruffles but the back is high up it's kind of odd. I would like more back coverage. I won't be buying anymore of these.
3.0,Very nice made but definitely very small for my child (4 years old)
3.0,pretty but cheaply made
3.0,"Nice material, lovely in blue, but too small. Buy a size larger."
3.0,"I loved the whole concept of the suit, but it just didn’t look as appealing on me. I love the way burgundy looks on me, but fire engine red isnt"
3.0,So cute and I purchased the xxl and it’s very tight and I take an xl-1x!! I put it away for a gift for someone but very disappointed because I really loved it ☹️😣
3.0,I wasn't thrilled with it and returned it.  It just did not look good on my daughter and looked a bit cheaply made.
3.0,I got 2 shirts from this company. One is perfect and this one is too big. It looks great and i passed it along. But be sure to order a size smaller.
3.0,"Darker than I thought it would be, also pattern seems squeezed.  It does not look Matyo to me but will keep it anyway."
3.0,Fit great but they are hard to open and close.
3.0,Was shorter than expected and not as flattering as I liked.
3.0,"Nice and light weight.  Down side is the band is small.<br />If this is a unisex watch I expected the band to be big enough for my husband to wear.<br />My wrist is large for a woman,8&#34; but I have to wear it on the last hole."
3.0,Im 5'9&#34; 170 34C and I bought a L in the wine color. Its much shorter in the front than the pic indicates. Also a marled sort of color with white threads running through it. Its cute but not what I expected. I am anticipating that it will shrink some when washed as this material usually does. If the length shrinks I wont be able to wear it.
3.0,Pink butterfly is smaller than expected (blue flower is bigger) and harder to get on. Turned green after a few days so not sure if its stainless steel. Very pretty and butterfly has shiny glitter in it
3.0,It was much larger than I would have wanted
3.0,"Would give a 4 or 5 star rating except for lack of operating instructions. For example, one of the advertised features important to our use was the ability to set the TPD (turns per day) in addition to the various motion program choices. I still cannot find the TPD control, beginning to question its existence. Assistance appreciated. Rgds, George Rutland"
3.0,"Too small for a large.  Nice colors, but it fits small."
3.0,The bag is very well made but it is a bit large for me to use as a shoulder purse and a bit too small to use as a tote bag.
3.0,Leather is a bit stiff and the lining is a little odd-- not sure if that's synthetic--it feels a little like a felt.
3.0,"I don’t think the dress looks like the picture. It’s more of a silky material and I thought it was going to be cotton. Which maybe that’s my fault for not reading the description better... but even so, it looked like a tent on and I don’t think a smaller size would have helped. It runs very big, so if you do decide to give it a chance, go down a size. For reference I am 5’9” and 200 lbs and I ordered an XL. Pictured is the yellow dress and green dress. I think the yellow looks gold in person which I liked but some wouldn’t if they wanted a true yellow. The green is a true green though."
3.0,"I love the design of the shirt. It fits except that the sleeves are way too short. I still like it so I wear it with the sleeves pushed up, but I would really prefer them to be long enough especially with it costing over $20. I am tall though so maybe my arms are just longer than average"
3.0,"Disappointed that the sizing description is not accurate ~ the band is huge! See photo - this is on a wrist measuring exactly 6 inches.there is no way the HR monitor would work. The band looks very nice, but won’t work on the stated wrist sizes"
3.0,not a good coat.
3.0,Not much sparkle but nicely set
3.0,I have other glasses cases similar to the Gunnar case and they all collapse flat when not being used to protect my glasses. The one DOES NOT and takes up too much valuable space in my backpack. I won't make that mistake again.
3.0,Flops on the bottom.
3.0,It's okay material is kinda thin
3.0,I thought these world be great due to ratings. They are made of very nice quality material. However to tight in the crotch area for my liking. Will not buy another of this brand.
3.0,"Bottoms fit great, but top is about two sizes too small. Size medium top looked to fit about an A cup!"
3.0,Very nice concept but how so cheap. Super thin. You can hardly see the writing. If you have average to large wrists it may prove difficult. I do have a small wrist so its wearable.
3.0,"I don't think this will be a dress that will last for very long, as it is not well made.  I had to deal with a few loose threads.  Also, I would recommend going up a size if you decide to get the dress."
3.0,"I am 5'8"", 160 lbs and I bought a Medium in blue after reading reviews. The color is a brighter than the pictures but I didn’t mind as it is a beautiful color (best color representation is the last picture in the natural light). The material is super soft but the fit is just terrible. It hugs my hips even when pulled up instead of looking slouchy like the item pictures. The arms and side of the sweater have a different pattern and it just looked weird for me. I bought it in large and it was so over-sized that it felt heavy. If the sweater would have fit better on me, I would have kept it- but I returned both."
3.0,"Very comfortable, water proof, I actually use them to wash my bike in the cold weather. While riding my bike in 25degree weather my finger tips are freezing... they dont hold up as advertised. Now, 35plus with the windchill factor.. I'm ok for an hour or so, then my finger tips start to freeze"
3.0,"The fabric is pretty thin and not very soft even after washing. It also definitely runs on the small side, if you're close to being in-between sized I'd go with the larger size. The graphic is good, looks sharp."
3.0,They're really cute but the posts came bent. I bent them back but I'm worried they may not stand the test of time.
3.0,"Its an ok product neither was too happy or too disappointed. After a while the threat starts to come off from certain places after you wash. Do recommend to dry it in your lowest setting. Personally, I feel that after some washes it started going soggy and stretchy."
3.0,"I ordered the one that should’ve come with a tiara and scepter, but it’s only the dress. It’s smaller than expected (still fits, but barely) and I ordered a size larger than the size chart suggested in the hope she could play dress up for a while. Kid is happy, mom is disappointed."
3.0,"Runs a bit large. I’m 5’4”, 127 lbs and got a small. Its loose and sack-like at the top and too long (falls just below the knee, which is an awkward length for me). The tie belt helps some, but there’s just too much extra fabric. Could be really cute on someone a little taller, but I’d say err on the side of sizing down."
3.0,Price is good but not quality leather!
3.0,This is a great idea<br />I purchased these so my purse would not be on the floor when I go out to dinner etc. I'm glad they come in threes bc one already broke
3.0,Ehhh though it would be solid but nope more like a cast
3.0,Oh are these cheap. I lose and scratch sunglasses all the time so these will work. They are cute but I don’t expect them to last long. Plastic looks and feels so cheap. You get what you pay for.
3.0,"Fit is nice & sexy & looks like the pucture, but it is very hard to walk in. Great for a photo shoot but not real life. Will be returning."
3.0,"I LOVE my Birkenstock’s so when I was in the market to buy my son a pair that he could get wet, I was so excited to find these. But - they tore within a few weeks of him having them and can no longer be worn because the rips have gotten so big that he trips over them. I love the design, they just need to be more durable."
3.0,It works but it is very uncomfortable.
3.0,"Its a cute looking Dress. Fits my 11 year old just right. Unfortunately it ls very cheep (rips)and everything sticks to it (fuzz,hair). Over all it did the trick for a one night deal."
3.0,Michael Kors products are favorites - but - I returned these glasses because they were too large for my face.  Would not have kep them even if they had fit because I didn't think they were worth the price.
3.0,Very nice beanie but it is like a kids size. They need to be more honest about the sizing.
3.0,"Shorts were cute and seemed well made, my hips were just to wide to be a comfortable fit. The fabric doesn’t have much of a stretch."
3.0,"This quality dress is beautiful, warm, and cozy; but, impossibly long.  I love the golden color.  The seller's size chart is exactly right.  An extra-small fits my 37"" bust-line perfectly.  But, there are no high-heels tall enough or belt-styling blouson enough to compensate for the ridiculous length.  To fit my 5'6"" height, I will need to remove literally at least 12"" of fabric.  If you are under 6'6"" and purchase this item, plan to tailor it."
3.0,I like it  very nice  it was the style of the draw me.  Thank you !
3.0,Not fir fuller figures
3.0,Its fine.  Not great quality but not poor quality either.  Arms a little small compared to how the rest of it fits.  Its just ok.  I wont buy it again but Im not upset I bought it either.
3.0,normally medium is perfect size for me but apparently the sizing is slightly bigger than i expected.
3.0,Top fit fine. Bottoms were short enough to be considered capris. Granddaughter was extremely disappointed.
3.0,The under shirt fits small but the rest is fine.
3.0,This is a beautiful set. But however the top fits very strangely the shorts fits okay. I love the faded grey with the white stars. It looks very cozy. And the material feels nice and soft. I just don't like the fitting of the shirt. It's hard to explain. But it's like the back of the shirt fits High. and the front of the shirt sort of low. No support for the girls whatsoever if you know what I mean.
3.0,I love these glasses. They work amazing. Look super cute. Fit awesome. BUT when I wear them they smell so much like chemicals I can only wear them for so long. About 30mins and I start to feel like puking. I tried to wash them but no change. If there was no horrible smell they would be 5 stars hand down.
3.0,The material quality was poor and there are threads hanging everywhere inside the hems. You also need to wear a slip/spanx underneath because it’s completely see through.<br />I do love the fit though and it’s a comfortable dress to wear casually every day.
3.0,Material is not very soft...fits okay
3.0,"Looking at the picture,  you think your getting this beautiful blue colored pearl.  To me it looks royal blue.  What  I got, is actually a grey colored pearl.  It looks like a charcoal color grey in person.  I'm disappointed in that, because I don't wear grey."
3.0,I read the reviews to get a size bigger than I normally am.  I wear a small so I got a medium.  The bottoms fit somewhat but the top was really big.  I just sent it back and ordered a small!  Overall the suit is really cute!
3.0,"you have to fight to get in and out of this thing, maybe be double jointed in the shoulders..."
3.0,Returned this. Way too short in the back but fit great everywhere else. I was bummed.
3.0,"I ordered this suit, because it is super cite and different than your typical triangle top string bikinobthat every one wear nowadays. When I ordered this I chose a small based on the reviews. I am 120lbs 4'11&#34;, a 34c in the the bust, and have a butt. The top fit perfectly as it wasn't too tight or too loose. But the bottoms you can forget it. It wouldn't even fit a 5 year old. I still plan to wear the top and just find a black bottom that I can fit into else wear."
3.0,Very tiny but seems nice and durable
3.0,Half fit onto my charm bracelet
3.0,"When tried by my mother, a tearing sound was heard; sounded like stitches pulliung loose.<br />After several wearings, the ledy slipper is bit loose."
3.0,"I am 5'4 110lbs and ordered a small. While the length is perfect, it is a bit wide. The drawstring definitely helps give it a waist, but there is still a ton of fabric that you have to position along the drawstring so it doesn't look super poofy/bunched up in places. The material is really comfy and breathable. The pattern is adorable. I will say though that the stitching in general, but especially on the button loops is not the greatest. One of the loops came out the 2nd time I wore this dress when I didn't even have that particular button buttoned."
3.0,"like the colors!  Seems stiff, and cheap feel to it, especially the burlap bottom, looks like i can see shiny glue between the burlap and material.  Material feels stiff and thin,  like it will tear quickly."
3.0,Good price. Thin material. A little on the small side.
3.0,"Just received my dress only 1 day after I should have gotten it... no big deal for me. Tried it on... umm, doesn't work for me... the dress gathers on the side where the wing is and as I walked it kept rising.... not trying to spend my time tugging at the dress during the time I would have worn it.... curvy size16, puchased an XL... order up"
3.0,"It is a good robe, nice and warm. The only problem is the sizing chart. The sleeves are 4&#34; longer than the chart shows for the small/medium size."
3.0,I needed the size to be more a accurate. It was very short and ran a little small. More like a junior size than a women's size
3.0,I like the size and all the pockets.  The inside pocket is rather odd because it’s sorta loose in the purse.  My least favorite is it has a smell to it.  I’ve left it hanging outside on my patio with all pockets open trying to air the smell out!
3.0,nice jacket i normally wear a xl ordered a xxl and still way too small
3.0,"I bought these necklaces in every available length, and for the most part was very pleased. However, the 18” I received were not Sterling, but do seem like a decent stainless steel. Then the second pack of 20” only had one necklace instead of the promised three. The only option is to return for refund, but for the price I might as well keep them. On the plus side, all the others are beautiful. If not for the inconsistencies and inability to just get my other two necklaces, I’d give them a five."
3.0,not quite what i was expecting. the chain is way too long and cannot be made shorter
3.0,"The ""sleeves"" on this dress are SO tight.  I'm 5'6"" and fit but my arms are not big or bulky.  The ""sleeves"" cut into my arms in an unflattering way and made it hard to move.  I was disappointed because I LOVED this dress online.  I returned it."
3.0,"Too warm, for winter use only."
3.0,Charis loose fitting womens top. This has a sparkle to it and I did not care for the scratchy material.  The interior of the shirt was not scratchy but the exterior was and I found it irritated my skin when it rubbed against it. It is definitely a loose top. I reciea size medium and it was loose on me.  I am 5'4 109lbs and a 34D.  This was a pass for me due to the material.
3.0,These are way smaller than expected. The fabric pulls easily too. I will either shrink or sell them at  yard sale someday.  An extra large is more like a small.
3.0,Pentair sm-2.  Clean out the old spider gasket first; ours was totally glued in.  All day job to get it cleaned out. This fit in fine but seems a little thin so not 100 percent seal.  The little pack inside is a lube. We used a higher grade silicone lube we had.  We did small spots of gorilla gel super glue to hold per a you tube video.<br />The other gaskets all fit fine and made a good seal.<br />Worth trying compared to cost of new valve.  I think if I did it again I would run a bead of silicone caulk before laying in the spider gasket just to fill a bit better and raise it a bit higher.<br /> Just a tiny bit as the cover still has to be able to move/rotate.
3.0,"In weight, this would make a good coat/long sweater in the fall or spring. It doesn’t provide a lot of warmth but could be used as a layer. I’m 5’5” and it sort of swallowed me. The sleeves are too long and, though it fits all right in the shoulders, overall it’s just not very flattering. It does look like a short bathrobe, and you could certainly use it for that. Not really something I’d wear to go out because it doesn’t look good on me."
3.0,"Feels very cheap, doesn’t seem like it will last. Looks nice and is comfortable but doesn’t feel durable at all."
3.0,The shorts are very comfortable but was unhappy with how short the drawstring was. It isn't anywhere near as long as shown in the picture. Also the color isn't quite as accurate as it is shown. Both pairs I got especially the green pair wasn't like the picture. I also got a size large even though I wear a medium and I'm glad I did. They are comfortable just not quite as described or like the photo shown.
3.0,Would not buy it came broken 😕
3.0,Dress is lovely the material slezy so it fittted to the body
3.0,"Cute earrings for girls into all things Paris, but the post didn’t fit into the earring back (the earrings and backs were not together in package so maybe there was no quality control). Required some chiseling in our part to make hole large enough to properly fit post."
3.0,Had too pass this on to my pre-teen grand-daughter because it was too tight. I'm disappointed.
3.0,"It is truly Rose Gold, not &#34;gold&#34;."
3.0,"Had to send back right away. Too small and actually had a &#34;less quality&#34; appearance which I was very surprised about. Others seem to like the shoes, but they don't have a bigger size for me to try so I had to look elsewhere."
3.0,"It was ok, a little flimsier than expected, however it works."
3.0,"Not crazy about these, not as comfortable as I had hoped they would be. I will say they are everything the seller claimed and good quality, so they may work for others but not for me."
3.0,"I LOVE the shirt, but they run very small, going to reorder in a larger than regularly worn size."
3.0,"Thinnish fabric. Looks nice, but pricey for the quality."
3.0,It was bigger than what i expected and not as dainty as i wanted....you get what you pay for applies here. It's not ugly it's just pretty cheap looking.
3.0,"My kid is a slender size 5 and was crying that the Small was too tight. I'm severely allergic to artificial fragrance, and was shocked at the strong floral smell when I opened the package. Can't try another size, since I'm not interested in migraines and vomiting until the fragrance washes out!"
3.0,Comfortable but the backside is not flattering at all. I’ll wear them around the house but not in public.
3.0,Material seemed to be of average quality. Returned.
3.0,Looks different then I expected. Love it though!! Took me a few days to decide if I wanted to keep it.
3.0,It arrived a bit too small for me despite choosing my usual size and showed up in the package very wrinkly and matted. Had to run it through a de wrinkle cycle in the dryer
3.0,These are very nice but the top is just too small
3.0,Really thin. Will work for the season in Cali
3.0,"It’s cute, the design is really cute. But the fabric and print looks cheap. I’m 5’8” 150lb, the problem is I tried on without bra, it’s so tight around breast and arms. I ordered a large, im old navy Walmart small, forever 21 medium. I’m bra size 34DD, I even heard a bit of stitch breaking. But the waist is fine. I really don’t wanna exchange or order extra large, that’s detrimental to my self esteem and I don’t want it to look bulky in the lower body."
3.0,Soft beautiful a little too tight in the chest<br />And some lose hemming pieces... And the zipper sucks bug time
3.0,Not meant for men with extra big balls & penis.  Material is soft & prices are good.  Will research better!
3.0,Purple was lighter than what’s shown in the picture and the design was a bit crumpled up
3.0,Cute top but cheap silkish type material. Runs short
3.0,"The opals are very pretty and the post seem to hold them pretty sturdy.<br /><br />Sadly two things keep me from enjoying them fully. My helix piercing is put in such a way this jewelry sits awkwardly on my ear.Second, I dropped the backing and could not find it. No fault of the company, just my luck."
3.0,"This hat is huge, and I have a big head. Because it’s so large the ear flaps don’t stay close enough to keep ears warm. I’m using this over a knit hat on really cold days"
3.0,It did fit to my baby
3.0,My earings are cute but one of them doesn't latch correctly
3.0,"Ugh, wish I had seen the price it's listed here sooner. Bought this in Canada for $60. Anyway, worked for the first day, second day not as good, and by the third it was way too big. And it seemed kinda tight on the loosest band a couple days before. I should add that, no, I haven't changed shape myself. I bought it 3.5 weeks postpartum because support bands (and other maternity/baby products) are hard to find in Victoria. So it's not that it did the job and just doesn't fit anymore. Wish I could have my money back but no returns from the store I bought it from once it's opened.. even though it was $60..nice. I'm going to at least try what another reviewer suggested and wash it. Hell, maybe I'll dry it too even though it says not to. I'd like it to shrink afterall.."
3.0,Super cute. Great fabric but super narrow across the shoulders. Unfortunately I will be returning this.
3.0,"This is pretty, but it's very heavy and even with the bobby pins that they included, I found that it felt like it was always going to fall off my head. If you have thicker hair with bobby pins to hold onto, it may work better for you. If they could've made it out of a lighter,  more flexible metal, it would be perfect.  I returned mine for a full refund."
3.0,Nice but the cables disconnected at the clasp. I had to fix with super glue
3.0,The clip is  bit flimsy and will stretch out if you put too much money in it. But it's more about team representation than functionality. Right?
3.0,"Cups are way too small, and compressing"
3.0,"Cute but way to small, it doesn't look so small on the photo"
3.0,They suck ripped when I put them on<br />I trashed three pair in two hours
3.0,I ordered these socks to fit women size 11 and they were gigantic. I couldnt wear them and gave them away
3.0,Cute hat but creased really bad.
3.0,Nice leather. The only downside is the credit card slots are too tight for the cards esp if I put 3 cards. Has a hard time taking them out.
3.0,Flimsy material. Look really cheap and the designs are not always recognizable
3.0,perfect para el verano elegante feliz con la compra
3.0,Order Xtra large.
3.0,The color is so rich its very soft wish it was a little bigger  will keep it the price was perfect  very pretty
3.0,"for a men's jacket, the zipper was on the wrong (left) side.  It was also sized too small and was returned.  Customer service offered several times to replace the item for free.  They have gone beyond normal expectations.  I'll write a review as soon as the new one shows up!"
3.0,"I have large upper arms & I don't think it would be comfortable for any long amount of time<br />Also, I would wish the top of the shoulder seam could have been a little wider to cover a bra strap<br />I am older and feel the shirt is far too pretty to have a wayward strap showing<br />Very sorry to say that I will be returning this really otherwise VERY classy, stylish shirt<br />Unfortunately !!! Can't be right for everyone"
3.0,My set did not come with GAME on the hat it came with PLAY ON IT!!!  Son still likes it but dang it I wanted it to be what I ordered
3.0,The bracelet is very pretty but the clasp keeps coming undone. I find myself checking it often. Perhaps the particular bracelet I received is simply defective.<br />Has anyone else had issues with the clasp?
3.0,Need to adjust it
3.0,Not quality material or sizing. Purchased 1-2 sizes up and it was still a bit tight
3.0,"The concept is cute; however,  the material is a cheap bandage material.  It's not the heavy kind that stuck in everything."
3.0,granddaughter loved them but had to reorder a larger size.
3.0,I thought it was a long tshirt. It fits regular at waist.
3.0,The service was quick with this dress.  I normally wear size 12 and bought the large but it was too small.
3.0,wish I had received them  they must be walking them herwiv
3.0,"The bands are comfortable, but the sky blue is almost navy and the lilac is purple. Not what I wanted."
3.0,"The look and feel of the band is great.  Tools and instructions to adjust were very easy to use and follow.  My only issue is that the Fitbit frame is a bit wider than the Fitbit and as you can see it is sticking out on the 2 button side.  Hasn’t fallen out yet, hoping it won’t."
3.0,"While the pattern on this dress is cute and the cut is nice, the material is a lycra-like legging material and very thin. If this wasn't for an indoor photo shoot where I didn't have to worry about sunlight hitting on me I'd likely have to wear a slip underneath."
3.0,"This piece of jewelry was so tiny, but delicate and pretty. I kept it although it was very small."
3.0,"Beautiful, but heavier than most.... Bottom piece lasted longer than I expected tho... For the price, it was def worth the purchase!"
3.0,"A shame it's cheap plastic.  Otherwise, The design is pretty, but it's only good to wear as accessory to a costume."
3.0,"I gave it a three because it is attractive.  I usually do not wear any bracelets due to my physical activities but I wanted to experiment with this and know the magnetic bracelets can be helpful. I have worn a Q-link for many years and am open to other forms of health care, but honestly, I didn't notice any changes in my body.  So, it's pretty but as far as for healing or betterment of the body, I personally cannot recommend."
3.0,My measurements are 38-30-42. This was tooo cute but tooo small. And there was no shape.
3.0,"Really cute but the tags are sewn on the outside on every single shirt. If you look closely, you'll see that there isn't a tag visible on the neckline and this is the reason why - a big floppy tag sewn on the the sides on the outside of the shirt."
3.0,This looks more orange than it actually was. It’s not as opaque as the picture so the color doesn’t look as vivid
3.0,"These were absolutely stunning, right size and all. However, the back clip on one of the earrings broke and I can't wear them anymore."
3.0,This is really cute but unfortunately at least once a week it falls off or gets caught on something and breaks and it’s a pain to put back together. It risks losing my Apple Watch because sometimes I’m not doing anything strenuous when it breaks and falls off to the floor. I can’t say it’s great quality unfortunately because of this
3.0,"Product came as pictured, but was missing the hat. Planned on using at least the onesie and hat for our pregnancy announcement. I guess we’ll just have to make it work."
3.0,"Medium is somewhat small, large is somewhat big. The pockets weren't level by about half an inch."
3.0,On the shorter side but comfy
3.0,Like the band but it's still too big for me on the smallest setting! Maybe I received the wrong one.
3.0,"there is a simular dress in macy's im sure this is a copy of the one in macys goes a little past the knee this one is above the knee so i was disappointed, the return was easy though"
3.0,"You would want to use larger than 1/4&#34; ball bearings/ammo to have it feel right when drawing. not sure if the plastic pocket's scored fold will last though. I wish the pocket was leather, though."
3.0,to small on the arm area.everything else is fine it's so soft.
3.0,It's about the size on my thumb print...
3.0,"Fits as expected, but material is very thin, almost see through. Will be a good lounge shirt, but not one I would wear out and about."
3.0,Slip off easily
3.0,"The neck and sleeve length are perfect... But It is absolutely HUGE in the mid section. I feel like i'm wearing a parachute. No kidding. The shirt also has an GIGANTIC front pocket. It works fine if you have a short coat or suit jacket to wear with it. If not, it is just way to big in the middle. And did I mention the HUUUUGGGGEEEE Pocket."
3.0,Costume fits great and looks great but found imperfections on the body and mask.
3.0,Cute Design Poor Execution - I am normally a XXL/1X/38D - the shirt fit more like a crop top and was a bit see through.
3.0,I was going to return these but missed the return date. I don't like the crotch area.
3.0,"I am quite tall (about 5 foot 9, 36A/B), but most of that is in my legs! Originally ordered a small, returned that as it was too short and ordered a medium. The medium was still very much a crop top on me so I ended up returning this as well."
3.0,"Kind of see through, and about a foot too long!"
3.0,Chain is cheap looking.
3.0,This was too sheer for me.
3.0,"Not the width that I wanted, but the belts themselves are ok."
3.0,"They did shrink after being washed, but that worked out for us because they come large. After shrinking they fit my baby perfectly, but he's a small baby. If your baby is of an average or larger size, order a larger than needed size.<br />The quality is ok. There's some loose stitches that stick out of seams as seen in the pictures. Not a big deal to me as long as the seams hold up."
3.0,Just a little too short! I'm not a tall girl- 5'4&#34; and this barely covered my butt with a medium! But super cute with leggings and wedges!
3.0,So slouchy. I didn't like it but my daughter did so i gave it to her.
3.0,"I’m a 34E and this thing is holding onto dear life. Actually, I think this too is long dead. If it’s not riding up my back it’s wires are riding up my bust - this usually means the band is too big, but if I went any smaller the cups wouldn’t fit (not like they do anyway). The under wires are stretched, the awkward little “point” at the gore is literally bent out of shape, shaking and crying. Even if you taped the life out of this shirt to your body it still wouldn’t be flattering- don’t buy the hype. Zero support, looks horrible, feels horrible."
3.0,Material is cheap but also the price..
3.0,I love this mask! But it stretches out over time making it to big to fit! But it’s so comfortable and doesn’t cause me to break out
3.0,I don't really like the fabric for this.  I usually wear jumpsuits during the summer but this material isn't very comfy so I would probably skip it.  The polka dots are okay.  Sewing is modestly okay.
3.0,"It's a very cute pink color, made well, and the sound is very clear. However, it doesn't fit my adult size head. It doesn't fit my teenager or 10 ur old either. It fits a small child's head only. Luckily I have a 7 yr old and with some effort she was able to get it on herself. Sizing is definitely not for adults."
3.0,Loved this cute little outfit!! But the pants were too long :(
3.0,I like it but it is shorter than I wanter it to be.
3.0,"Cute shirt. RUNS SMALL. GO UP A SIZE. I usually wear a large--11/12. Bought a large and it fits tight, not flowy. Color of flowers is a bright pink, not mauve like it looks it photos."
3.0,"Runs very small and is not flattering at all. It worked in a pinch for a costume, but I would never have worn it if I had had time to get something else instead."
3.0,Very nice however when I put it on the chain broke.
3.0,Meh.. Straps are super thin. If my chest was any larger it would be falling out of the bottom of this.  No under wire or anything to keep your girls in. I'm a 34B.
3.0,They are OK as long as one doesn't separate and reattach the Velcro too many.  The material gets frazzled and fuzzy.
3.0,"I ordered per their sizing chart but XL was too big for me (5’6”, 140 lbs., 34H) I had to return and ordered next size smaller, large (when measured. My. Bust is 43 inches) per large size max bust is 40.6 inches & hips are btw 44.1-44.9 (my hips are 41 inches) the large fit ok, but had to shorten the straps a lot and the stupid draw string tie looks weird.  Will not cover any bra easily, recommend it only as a beach cover up"
3.0,Looks very beautiful but the stones are very loose and easy to come off
3.0,Bag is a little too small for my needs and the cell phone pocket is much too small for today's larger cell phones. The pocket was totally unusable. Love the style and color of the bag and the straps are finally long enough to use the bag as a shoulder bag. That's why I decided to keep the bag and will use it occasionally.
3.0,"Lightweight, a bit small but comfortable."
3.0,The fabric looks a lot lighter in the picture. It's pretty thick. The sleeves are pretty wide as well. Need to get it tailored which is not what I wanted to do.
3.0,Very small. The return was processed quickly.
3.0,The nose is lower than it should be.
3.0,"They look cool, but be warned: THEY HURT.<br /><br />I wear them very rarely now, and only for a few hours at a time."
3.0,Item looks and feels good. Shipping was slow.
3.0,These containers were smaller than I thought they would be. Not very useful for clothes in my opinion
3.0,"Very stylish and roomy, though very quickly shows wear and tear. I would not recommend for everyday use, but it is a decent purse!"
3.0,It's a bit see threw wasn't too happy with that.
3.0,"I love this color and pattern, but this shoe slips off my feet too often when walking. If I see this pattern and color in another style, I'll buy it right away. The heel is supportive, but with no ankle strap, I slip out of these too much to be comfortable."
3.0,Sleeves to short and cheap material
3.0,I like the way it feels. It keeps everything dry.
3.0,Not quite as cool as I expected. A little junky. Probably would not buy again.
3.0,Kind of cute but plain at the same time
3.0,was thin hoodie I thought it was going to be thicker.
3.0,"This bra feels amazing. The material is *chef's kiss*! Overall fit is fine, but the design!!!<br />I am a 34d and I couldn't even lean forward without a bit of boobage trying to sneak out the front! I wanted to love this bra so much! But my girls did not approve!"
3.0,was not the size showen but we now know how to buy right size ps they are pretty ear rings
3.0,This product is very see through!
3.0,It is soo cute except it is see-through. Like really see-through so thank goodness its only for pajamas.
3.0,"Cheap material. It bends easily. While traveling out of town, I got it snagged while putting on a backpack... the bracelet pulled apart and went flying!  Cute but cheap."
3.0,The material was ok...if you don't have that perfect figure look forget it have to loose some weight on my tummy area before I actually wear this dress
3.0,Very pretty but very small!<br />The chain was small n u can tell it was cheap . Not too happy with it but my neice loved it.
3.0,"Im aware of my size, really. They fit in the waist, thighs.. but theyre long. I could easily take 3- 4 inches off the bottom, otherwise I might trip on them.."
3.0,I bought this for my teenage niece!  She loved the color.  The quality seems okay.  I am thinking this is overpriced ... but it is a nice scarf!
3.0,"it fits so weird.  I got a 4x, the length was good but the arms and shoulders were too big.  returned for a 3x and the arms are better but it's too short."
3.0,"The bras are a bit snug, but the biggest problem is the pads are extremely stiff and scratchy. Almost cardboard like. I may take them out entirely since I'm using nursing pads anyway. Disappointed that I wasted money on a 3 pack."
3.0,I'm usually a medium but after reading the comments I went up 1 size but it still fits snug. Tight under the arm and shorter than expected
3.0,The socks did not list the compression factor.
3.0,Costume jewlery by far
3.0,"Nice watch, but arrived with a dead battery."
3.0,Cute light material. Clingy
3.0,Wish the chain was a little bit thicker but it was gorgeous and was a great gift
3.0,"I ordered my dress in the dusty blue. It's very well made and the thigh slit is perfect for walking with the heavy fabric. I ordered a few sizes up like other reviews recommended but the shoulders sit too high pulling ""the girls"" up uncomfortably so I'll have to have it adjusted. The padding is fairly thick and the corset is easily adjustable so no bra necessary either. Although, I am disappointed that it did not come with pockets as described."
3.0,It is ok because it is the lenses are caming off easy othet  than that it is ok
3.0,The product arrived in a timely matter and are the perfect length for capris. I am 5'9&#34; 165 lbs and ordered a size Large based on previous customer reviews but found the pants to be a little big on me. I was also disappointed in the thickness and quality of the fabric- I will probably stick to other brands in the future but will wear these to lounge around the house rather than to the gym for workouts.
3.0,"it arrived on time and the size is as I wanted. However, the shininess makes it look cheap and quality seems to be lower than expected."
3.0,I thought it could open to be able to add charms . Doesn't open .
3.0,I can never get the bow to tie right so I've never worn this dress before. It's cuter online.
3.0,one broke on me after a month of use but I work and do alot so its not bad
3.0,"This is a beautiful set.  I wore the left cuff to a New Year's Eve wedding and got several compliments on it, even from strangers.  However, I had to take it off halfway through the reception because it pinched my ear so hard.  Ouch! Beautiful and secure, but it hurt."
3.0,Nice stile but to big for the size
3.0,My daughter has very narrow feet so these were a bit loose but that was expected. She wore these shoes 3 times and by the third time the toes were frayed and a hot mess. You can tell by the almost pristine soles that my daughter didn't wear these excessively or treat them roughly. I wouldn't buy these again. I prefer something a bit more sturdy.
3.0,"H1: The clip I received seems insanely small. There are pictures and dimensions provided, but when it actually arrived I was blown away by the size. It seems high quality, so I'm going to use it to clip onto my pack away rain coat for hanging on my backpack, but I wouldn't buy it for anything you need quick access to, like your keys."
3.0,"Not red, but a burnt orange. I really wanted red... It must have been a oversight. They look very close in color but it doesn't match my red sandals or purse, and both are true red!!! Bummer,"
3.0,"I have a fairly big head. Also, I have had the same problem with most of the ear slits in these 'ear loop' gaiters - the slits are too close to the face and make the mask ride up on my cheek bones. This gives very little flexibility for fit, and a good chance the top seam will creep into my eye socket - a no no for me.<br /><br />Also, as you can see in the photos, the slits are too small for my ears (I did try pulling them up to no avail)."
3.0,Beautiful but clasp not strong enough for me so I returned.
3.0,"The color is called Leaf and looks grayish in the picture. In real life - green, green, green."
3.0,"Runs small but if I had got a bigger size, it would’ve been perfect because these pants are truly flattering on the rear side."
3.0,This style is not easy to find. I would have preferred all cotton.
3.0,"I ordered an XL because I typically take a L in woman's,(5'6"", 180, 36DD) but this shirt is advertised as Junior size.  It is very form fitting even in the XL. Not sure if I'm going to be able to wear it, unless I lose 10 lbs before my trip."
3.0,I love the fabric but the top was way too big ! I bought it for my daughter who normally wears a medium.
3.0,runs very small.. i am an xl size 14/16 and i got xxl and was still too small
3.0,"I would give 5 stars because they seem good, but I only recieved 4 tops when it was supposed to be 5 and thats kind of unaceptable."
3.0,Not durable broke after 2nd use
3.0,"The quality of the material of the boots is disappointing! The shoe is way overpriced! I expected better for the price I paid! Though the fit is true to size it does not wear as a shoe made with quality material! It looks and feels cheap! Advertising on the quality of this shoe is misleading! Sad! Not sure whether to keep it, throw away or donate!"
3.0,This is an okay top - but it was too short in the torso for me and I'm only 5'4&#34;
3.0,These run large and aren't as snug as others I've purchased.
3.0,"It's cute, I can't wait to wear it at next year's school football games! It'd be perfect for those fall nights."
3.0,I love the concept. The inner material is great. The outer material is stiff even after several washes.  I want to like it...
3.0,The red came off with in a week of wearing them
3.0,"I really liked these when they first arrived, they were comfortable to wear and worked great for reading outside or in the car.  After owning them for about 5 months the plastic finish started shedding and about a month later some of the film on the lenses began to delaminate.  These things are literally falling apart.  IF I had rated these glasses two weeks after buying them, it would have been 5 starts, too bad they began to disintegrate."
3.0,"This cover up is not the exact colors shown in the picture.  It's long all the way to your ankles but I'm only 5'4&#34;.  Also it is seen at the seams to mid thigh, I expected it to be open to the waist for some reason.  I'm glad I have it and it's nice for the price."
3.0,Not really attractive in Fuller stout neck.
3.0,"I really wanted to like it, but it was way too small. I’m normally a small and I ordered a medium and it still didn’t fit. The quality is also not great, but I expected that for the price."
3.0,"These are about 2 sizes too big for my 10yr old. The looked like a kids xl instead of 7-8. Not sure if I received the wrong size, but she was bummed they were too big. They are cute but the material is also a bit thin and see through. Black might be best option of you can find a size that fits."
3.0,"I just don't know if I like the material, but it fits ok!"
3.0,"These run HUGE. I am normally a medium and the smalls are too big. I’m 5’10” 150 and have never worn an XS in my life but I think they’d have fit better. Plenty long! The light army green ones are also very see through...if you have any cellulite whatsoever, it shows. The darker maroon/grape pants are a little darker and not quite as see through. They’re just okay in my opinion. The darker colors will show less I believe but I wish I felt comfortable in the green ones because they’re cute! Just house-lounging pants, though. I did wear the darker grape ones for a high intensity workout and they were okay. They’re a bit big so it felt like they were bunching and sagging at times. I’d suggest ordering one or maybe even two sizes down from your normal size."
3.0,"The hat seems to work as advertised.  The problem is packaging. Why design it to provide so much sun protection and then package it into what is essentially a little wadded up ball from and it doesn't go back to its original shape, that's why I bought it.  It would be better in a pizza box. How about some more creative packaging ideas."
3.0,"When I received the shirt, and saw that the inside of the material from the back of the t-shirt sticks to the inside of the matetial of the front, where the print is, I washed it. I followed the washing instructions, but afterwards, the silver in the print had all crumbled and mostly fallen off. So now the t-shirt looks bland and old, and I haven't even worn it yet. What a disappointment."
3.0,Too wide at waist . Good quality material for the price !
3.0,"Ran a little small. They are a beautiful color and SO COMFORTABLE; unfortunately, they fit strangely in the crotch area and looks very weird. I wear them around the house and as pajamas--wouldn't be caught dead in them out in public though; maybe if you wear a really long, baggy shirt that covers that area. It's a shame b/c otherwise, they are really nice."
3.0,The leggings are absolutely adorable and my daughter loves them.  The only negative is that they are on the thinner side so the lighter colors are a bit see through.
3.0,"interesting, but just looking at the images I found four typos: Kölsch, Altbier, Weizenbier, and Blackbier (or perhaps Blackbeer). Not going to buy it."
3.0,This was a gift for my 8 year old she loves it. Could Of been of better quality but she doesn’t complain
3.0,"Very nice, but they run a bit on the small side."
3.0,"True to size. But the “paint” on it started peeling one day after wearing it. Did not expect high quality because if price, but would’ve thought it’d last longer than that."
3.0,Little big in the middle for a size small. Needed an XS but that option wasn't provided.
3.0,"the only downside is the actually clasp and that's just the type of clasp that is on this bracelet but delievered on time, very beautiful just annoying clasp that comes undone"
3.0,The necklace is bit short and the part that tightens is already frayed straight out the package. The obsidian block is large. I found something to wear it with and it sufficed. it is a nice piece to wear on occasion but too heavy and gaudy to wear all the time.
3.0,It had almost triangle shaped lining
3.0,Nice shirt just runs small
3.0,You cant read whatever word is stamped at bottom
3.0,"This 3-star review is low 3. The biggest reason being that the crystal itself is a LOT foggier than it looks in the photo. I do not recommend you buying this for the aesthetics.The quality of the product (other than the coloring) is pretty solid, though, and it well made. The quality seems like it could last for a long while before having to retie a new string or necklace to it."
3.0,The black band looks great at first but the black coating comes off very quickly. I'd say it started coming off after the first week or so.
3.0,Much to thin to wear out with out layering. Using it as a night gown.
3.0,"I got these hoping I could interface them into an Arduino project.... Ooops.... They have no control path that can be tied into a serial data stream, so they just sit on my desk, SD card & Mp3 files playing nicely....  ??  Oh well, guess I should read the fine print before I buy things, right?"
3.0,The shirt was nice but it was not white like it looks in the picture. It kind of has a yellow ish tint to it
3.0,Very beautiful! But order a 2-3 sizes bigger than what the size chart says.
3.0,Very short .. my bad didn't check the length.. but very pretty
3.0,Very cute & fun set of croc charms for my 3 yr old niece. 😌
3.0,Kind of over priced. I bought 9me from wish.com for $1.00
3.0,The set is pretty but quality is really cheap. One earring broke before she got to use it. The necklace and bracelet held together so in all it wasn’t too bad.
3.0,Very cute. Order a bigger size. One wash I can tell my son won't be able to fit it again.
3.0,Very thin sweater. Also smaller than I expected I normally order an xl with most tops on Amazon and it fits more snug and not very long.
3.0,"After owning these and gaining a few pounds, they arent as roomy. Its the fabric that is annoying, each side is different and one is very prone to static. Its really annoying, the waist band it awkward and annoying. Earlier: Wayyyyyy roomy. More than I expected. I wish I got a smaller size but I don’t want to bother with a return."
3.0,"This top is cute and material feels silky-ish. Definitely for those with larger chests. I will probably be returning it though, and it is not forgiving at all from the back view. It has no ruching- just smooth. It shows every lump and bump! Personally not a fan of that look, but that might not bother every one or those that have slimmer frames."
3.0,"Thin, but soft. I bought them for a one time use, so I don't know how they will wear."
3.0,"This top is just ok...I am not overly impressed. I would call it a long sleeve shirt and not a sweatshirt. I’m disappointed because the fabric is not very soft. The twist front is cute but it is very cropped. I sized up to a medium and it’s still super short on me. I’m 5’-5” and 125lbs. I will wear this around the house as a lounge shirt, but if you’re looking for a soft, high quality top - pass on this one."
3.0,Will return and order a larger size
3.0,"This suit fits a bit too large and the edges flop over on itself. But, the back of the suit up by the shoulder blades fit exactly as I would want. Still, I had a great time in this suit. I felt covered and confident but also sexy."
3.0,Great quality of leggings! Lots of stretch without being see through at all! I was very sad when I received them and tried them on. I ordered an XL and they fit tighter in the waist than the size Larges that I already own and love.  I'm normally a L/XL and these were so tight!
3.0,"I have long legs and it’s difficult to shop for pants. I finally found pants online from VIV that are reasonably priced with a 32” inseam. I ordered a gray and a black of the same style.  I was very disappointed when I tried on the black pair because when I pulled it up to my waist, it was not tall enough. The inseam barely measured 31”. The grey, on the other hand, measured 33” and are a bit too tall.  😐"
3.0,Runs very small. Gave them to my daughter 3 sizes smaller than me. They last!
3.0,Much thinner than expected. Quality seems questionable.
3.0,It's nice... but it is too large for my taste. I were small and this looked like size L on me...<br />:(
3.0,They are okay. Kind of flimsy. But they are super cheap and made in China.
3.0,"I really love this purchase, the sleeves were a little snug but overall good fit!"
3.0,"The bottoms are way too tiny.  I did know this going in based on other reviews, so I wasn't too surprised.  I tossed them in the goodwill pile.  I do like the top, however.  I'm almost 5'9 and it's hard to find longer tankinis. The material is not high quality, but not super cheap, either.  I would recommend this swimsuit, but only if you're comfortable paying $26 just for the top."
3.0,"The material was too thin for wearing out of house. Felt like I was in my Jammie’s. Fit was spot on ..5’8. 210#. XL.  I returned, wanted it to do errands."
3.0,Bought this as a gift. Was disappointed to find that it fits an entire size smaller! My mother wears a 2X so that's what I ordered. Didn't fit. She needs a 3X in this nightgown.
3.0,The material was not as expected. It is very flimsy material not like a true windbreaker but over it looks pretty good!
3.0,Absolutely no room in the chest but it was nicely made and cute.
3.0,The hem on this top is not great quality. It seems unfinished. Its only surged and the hem isnt turned under and hemmed properly so the material curls. Im going to have to have it fixed. Otherwise its cute!
3.0,"The top was too tight, other than that I liked the fit. Had to send back.  :("
3.0,"For the price good product, very thin but fit well. Saved us some wet clothes in Disney."
3.0,"They are soft, thin and comfortable. I always wear a tank under any shirt I wear. If you want it to be more loose, size up a size. I went to a large. (I also have weight to lose)"
3.0,Loved them but way too small! Sent them back.
3.0,"I got a size medium and the bottoms fit well, but the top was somewhat small. I can wear a size medium-large depending on the item and material. The shorts fit really well. I'm 5' 81/2"" tall and 160 pounds. The top was a little small and I didnt like how the straps and lace formed a y shape. Basically the top of the top and the straps seem to go in towards your chest rather than straight down from your shoulders and it doesnt look flattering. The material is really soft. It is stretchy, but not too much because then I heard pulling as if they were going to rip. I've had a few loose strings as well. Overall, I would say the set is nice for lounging."
3.0,"Got one like it with different design, expected it to fit like the first one. It didn't.  This one had a different fit and ran a lot smaller."
3.0,The glasses were nice and well made but it does not work as described. All it does is makes  everything turn yellow. It does not reduce the glare at night. It’s ok to wear them during the day as sun glasses but not as Night Driving Glasses.
3.0,"Nice seat, but wrong size!"
3.0,"Awesome coral color, however this ran very, very small.  Had to return."
3.0,"Beautiful but I felt the zipper was hard to pull up and down.  Caught at waist, pleats cause a lot of material at that juncture so I felt in time I would blow the zipper so I returned it.  The fit was beautiful."
3.0,"Honestly, I regret buying this.  There's nothing inherently wrong with it...but the clear shell that the fiio comes with is actually preferred in my opinion.  It's a more satisfying grip in the hand, and it even looks better."
3.0,This scarf has gold sequins and braid in the peacock embroidery.  I don't think it looks as pictured.  Still pretty but very gold sequiny
3.0,Design are awesome but the fit is not good
3.0,"My son he loves the slippers,  he is 12, and they only fit him for a month before he grew out of them, my feet are size 8 1/2 at his feet are a little bigger..  so these definitely run smaller than advertised !"
3.0,I really wanted the tiered ones. But these will do just fine.
3.0,"I purchased these hoping I could wear them for rock climbing, but they have no stretch so that won’t be possible. The fit is really cute, but I can’t even comfortably squat down to pick something up in these. Very weird fabric choice since these are described as being made for “active women”. The color was darker than the picture for Garnet Red, but it was still a great color. Shame about the fabric. Hopefully Columbia will redesign them in the future!"
3.0,The waist is a bit tied but the bottom is too wide.  Strange style.
3.0,"They are all right. Stones are a little big... not what i was looking for, but they're ok."
3.0,"Color was good, quality was mediocre but was bigger than expected size. Top was not supportive enough to wear without straps but straps did not stay hooked"
3.0,I bought these for my boyfriend for snowboarding and they are nice for him and his buddies to wear while outside in the snow. When I tried to wear one while snow boarding it would constantly fall off my face. They are kinda big and not snug around your face.
3.0,Very cute but way too big!!!
3.0,Still getting used to
3.0,"The pendant I received is not as green as the one shown in the ad but that is probably because Jade has many variations of green including mottled.  Also, the leaves are not as detailed as I had expected.  Nevertheless, I feel I got my money's worth though I doubt it was ever sold for more than the sale price."
3.0,Pretty but they are very heavy. I don’t think I will actually get any real use out of these because they’re that heavy!
3.0,"I have another one of these hats from another seller and This one is a bit tougher to use. It uses a slightly different pump that you have to push harder to get the ears to go up and if you want Active Rapid Flopping you'll tire out your fingers and arm muscles real fast from how hard you have to press.<br /><br />On the plus side, the hat design itself is super cute and softer than the other one I own with brighter colors and nicer material"
3.0,The material is shinier than expected!!
3.0,"This swimsuit was SO CUTE ON!!! I love it the only thing is that I am 5'5 and a size 12. I bought the XL and it BARELY fit. And when I put it on, it was almost like I was too &#34;tall&#34; for the item.  I had to take out the bra pads because they sat at my waist instead of my chest. Once I took the padding out it was fine. Still could use a bit more breathing room but I'll deal with it considering paid less than $15 for it."
3.0,Nice product but not at all for a newborn.  it's more like 6 months
3.0,This was not very well made.  I was disappointed in the yarn quality.
3.0,Very cute but Not true to size
3.0,"I have had this set a little shy of a year now.  All the stones are intact which is good, but it's does not sparkle like it once did.  I am not exposed it to harsh chemicals or anything that I should not have.  I got a lot of compliments when it was new, not so much anymore.  It's beautiful, but do not expect long term beauty from it."
3.0,Purchased the wine red but it was more like a burgandy color. Way too big
3.0,Started tearing
3.0,"I have to scrunch these because they do that annoying roll down thing if I try to wear them as actual knee socks. But I wear them anyway because I love the design and they're still comfy. I only wear these on days I'm not on my feet much, though, since they don't function for me as true compression socks. I have larger, very muscular calves, but most compression socks fit fine anyway. Wish these did, as well."
3.0,A defected item was received.  The seller issued a refund.
3.0,These are pretty however one arrived broken.
3.0,The material doesn’t lay well. It’s quite stiff and doesn’t have a great drape on top. The skirt is as pictured and didn’t seem see through but having full hips made the back shorter. And because it’s a circle/skater skirt style I didn’t feel comfortable wearing it. It seemed like given the right angle or any gust of wind I’d be flashing everyone. I’m guessing someone shorter or with a very petite frame would find all of this a non issue but for me the fit wasn’t worth keeping it.
3.0,Very cute~!!
3.0,"Nice comfy material, stay put, but I have small feet and these are pretty snug"
3.0,Cute but they scratch too easily.
3.0,It's a very pretty colorful shirt
3.0,"The charms are adorable but they don't stay on the bracelet very well.  My granddaughter is very careful with it but she has already lost a charm and several others have fallen off.  It's a shame, because it's really cute, but unless they figure a way to make the charms more durable on the bracelet it's not worth the cost of the charms."
3.0,You get what you pay for. Small item very thin and cheaply made. If you add it to another bracelet it's fine but alone it looks very cheap.
3.0,Quality could be better but cheap so whatev
3.0,"Unless you want this very fitted, the sizing chart is off and this item runs very small."
3.0,Really pretty but too big if you ask me. I wish we could make it tighter. I don't have tiny arms I would say average & I don't like how this constantly moves around!
3.0,Lightly tinted orange/amber sunglasses. Fits well on larger heads and kinda gives a better contrast when wearing them.
3.0,Not for baby or toddler crocs the attachment is too large for holes.
3.0,"I typically wear size 11 1/2, E width. My feet are wider than average. These Levi's shoes are size 11, but they're so big they come off of my feet as I walk. I'm returning them."
3.0,"Sterkowski makes quality hats. However, while the cap I received is well made it turned out to be different than the picture. Instead of the texture leather shown, I received a cap made of smooth and shiny leather (see photos). Instead of the described snap closure between the bill and 8 panel portion of the crown mine is permanently sewn closed and can't be released. I was told this textured leather is no longer available. They will not accept a return or send a substitute. They did provide a discount and communications about the discrepancy were prompt and cordial. Still I have a cap that looks very different from the image that is on the Amazon web site. If the description and image had been accurate, I would not have ordered. If you plan to order a product from Sterkowski first contact them and ask for an up to date image of the current material being used. Also ask if any of the specifics of the construction have changed since the description on the Amazon site was entered. This leather is shown on other Sterkowski caps on the Amazon website. If the company is correct that the leather is no longer available those illustrations may also be misleading."
3.0,"Seems to be the okay, about what you expect in this price range. Shades were too small though for my glasses. What I didn't anticipate was they sit up higher due to the clip, so I needed a much larger size."
3.0,"Bought this for a photo shoot, and it served its purpose. However, the boots did not match, it was like two completely different people knitted each boot...AND they each had a different template or sample to copy. Luckily, you couldn't tell in any of the photos"
3.0,"These tank tops are fine. However, they are more of a slinky material while I was expecting a cotton material. I wouldn't have a problem with this but they tend to ride up when I wear them running."
3.0,I just got this anklet on Monday and took it out of the package and the extender chain broke in half?  I just put it all back in the envelop so I can take time to look at it.  Disappointed that it fell apart so quickly.  It is cute though so I am going to try to fix and wear.
3.0,I like it. I didn't expect it to come with the knot untied. Otherwise good product! Very Soft!
3.0,Customer service is terrific but imfind all there sweatshirts are a little stiff and not flexible. But the sweatshirt printing is so top notch I have purchased 6 or 7 cafe press sweatshirts.
3.0,"This jacket is very lightweight and has interesting shoulders that give it a unique look. It only has one button that closes just above my waist which causes a gap in the upper portion of the jacket. I would have preferred another button placed a little higher. It is also a little too flared for me when not buttoned. It does look really great on the models, but I prefer the cut, style and fabric of the &#34;My Wonderful World Women's Slim Candy Color Round Neck Jacket Long Office Blazers.&#34;"
3.0,"I'm giving it only 3 stars as it seems a bait and switch situation. The side pockets do not have hand pockets as the photos suggest. As others have also mentioned there is no manufacturer's label on the inside. There is no interior pocket.<br />I ordered size Large and this item fits as a Large would. I'm 5'7"" and 168# and when wearing a sweatshirt this vest over it fits snugly at my 44"" chest. But there is a tag I just noticed that says 4XL. Go figure.<br />That said, I like it and I'm keeping it. Another reviewer mentioned that its fur is like the fur of a teddy bear. It is. And it feels great.<br /><br />The main zipper is on the left hand side, similar to ""women's"" clothing here in the USA. But the zipper cover material in which the snaps reside is built just like you'd expect for ""men's"" jackets/vests.<br /><br />If it weren't for it seeming like a bait and switch, I'd give it more than just 3 stars for the quality of the stitching. No unfinished ends. One reviewer mentioned the snaps being plastic. Mine are a combination of metal and plastic. The male snaps are metal. The female snaps have metal wire prongs encased in plastic.<br />I'll downgrade from 3 stars if these snaps should fall apart quickly.<br /><br />I had wanted a vest for indoors at home that has snaps to be able to quickly access my pistol. The vest I had ordered in Nov '18 was falling apart with only 1.5 winters of use. It was the Portwest US414BKRL vest sold here at Amazon.<br />This WrongYou vest seems better made despite not being strictly what was advertised.<br /><br />This vest meets my needs so I'm keeping it. It was only $30 USD.<br /><br />Edit 18Feb20:<br />No problems over the short time frame I've had it. I've answered tonight a question regarding whether it has the 2 side pockets. Mine doesn't, but I read answers from others who wrote that theirs had the side pockets.<br />I'm guessing that when you order one of these vests you might get one that is as advertised or you might not, depending upon where in China your vest was sewn."
3.0,"This wasn't expensive, so I kept it; however, it's pretty flimsy and not great quality. Still, I'll probably get some where out of it at some point."
3.0,Material is not what I expected but is still nice quality.
3.0,My husband is a welder master mechanic and ive been buying these watches at 9 bucks a pop (sales) but they where lasting more yyen 6 months. Now not a month. Twice the band just broke. Rest of time is job related. Ok for the money. But hard to get a reliable watch that is this cheap. So for the money and reason their ok. Good looking.
3.0,"This item was as described. It fit well, true to size. I did end up returning it because the top red panel ended up awkwardly highlighting my mom-tummy, and as that's an area I'd rather minimize, than highlight, I ended up deciding to send it back. But it seemed like a super comfy summer dress and if the pattern were different I totally would have kept it."
3.0,"These are nice looking bags. After two trips to Japan, the large one broke at the point where the wheel connects to the bag-unrepairable. And the medium bag's handle no longer pulls up to pull it. So not very durable."
3.0,Son muy finos la calidad de ve mala pero sirven a corto plazo
3.0,I did get compliments on the shirt. I does have some loose strings around the lace but that is to be expected with the lace of this type. The sleeves are a bit short but I am 5'11 so that is typical.
3.0,Fabric is very thin.  Not what I expected.
3.0,They were really cute. But the I went by the size chart. 4-6 small (which are the sizes I wear in jeans) and I couldn't even button them around my waist. The legs fit fine though. Didn't want to deal with the next size.
3.0,Poor quality. Spring falls out immediately on some of them. But there are pleanty left. Pack of 20!!!
3.0,"It's cute for a 1 time thing, it comes looking stretched out but maybe that is just the style"
3.0,Somewhat small on the waist and big on the back area.
3.0,Great product but too big my baby is almost two months I got 0-3 month and it fit more like a 6-9 month or bigger other than that is pretty outfit I put the sleeper an bow on my baby the skirt was way too big but beautiful ❤️
3.0,"If your glasses have a larger end to the earpiece, these will not work for you. The neoprene did not expand much at all, and definitely not enough to accommodate my glasses. If you have very thin, wire frames, this will probably work for you."
3.0,"I definitely returned this one. The fabric was cheap and scratchy, plus it just really didn't look good. Don't know if that was a body type issue but it really just looked like a sack. And that's coming from someone with curves."
3.0,"I really got what I paid for.  There wasn't much (if any) put in to put these together.  The best part was probably the disposable filters.  I'm going to see if this sparks any DIY motivations, otherwise they will be great backup masks."
3.0,Why don't write brand
3.0,This is not for women with larger breast. It doesn’t have shape so it would fit smaller cup sizes best.
3.0,Excellent looking<br />But they leak in the snow<br />My fingers get very cold<br />I wear them for looking good
3.0,the legs would not stay pulled down
3.0,"Really like Flojos - I have several, these were just not a comfortable as they look in the picture. Not a bad product, and price is fair, but the sole is much thinner than I expected."
3.0,"Nice little rosary holder. I stress &#34;little&#34; because it was much smaller than expected. The neoprene material should protect the rosary well, but the cost seems high, for the size."
3.0,Light weight steel toe wore them on a 12 hour shift added additional insole in the shoe feet was still hurting by my 10th hours. Shoe is tight around my ankles causing my ankles to swell. ☹️
3.0,I love these pearls Bc they're exactly the look I was going for BUT they smell horrible for weeks after opening. It's a strong chemical smell that was almost intolerable for the event I purchased them for.
3.0,"This fit as expected, its very stretchy, the down fall with this is that the material is tooo thin, you can see right through it, and i am light skin so everything shows even the underwear color."
3.0,"It says &#34;Men's&#34; but this seems more like a wallet designed for a woman to carry in her purse than for a man to carry in his back pocket.  It would work quite well as a woman's deluxe coin purse but I would not want the pressure of two significantly raised zipper sliders poking me when I move or sit down.  Likewise I'm not masochist enough to enjoy the pressing of a handful of metal discs I might otherwise consider keeping in that outside coin purse.  The snap-to-close feature would be useful for a woman wishing to carry it in her purse or handbag,  not so much for someone who intended to carry it in their pocket.<br /><br />I would also resist carrying a wallet where my credit cards are completely hidden by their leather compartment although I suppose you could discipline yourself to enforce a rigid systematic organization so that visual clues to a compartment's contents are no longer necessary.<br /><br />It is well made and the leather smells great.  And the lack of room inside would prevent you from accumulating a lot of useless contents - insuring that your wallet maintained a healthy thinness. The RFID Shielding Material sounds like a good idea."
3.0,"Little whatch , in the photo look bigger"
3.0,This was labor as sweatshirt so I was hoping for a thick fabric. It’s just a long sleeve shirt.
3.0,Very disappointed!  Very poorly made
3.0,"Too short not true to my size,really like them returning for larger size.size"
3.0,This dress fits small so i had to go xxL for the dress to fit.<br />The waistline could be a bit longer down to your tommy button<br />I read the coment there from other customers and apply it to my buying options....<br />But it all awesome nice ...I love it
3.0,"Soft, comfortable, patterned but not ostentatious. I find them equally as appropriate for casual or dressier wear. And, you don't have to worry about one of them vanishing in the clothes dryer alternate dimension because one of those inscrutable laundry symbols on the envelope style folder they are shipped in means do not tumble dry, I assume to  maintain whatever antibacterial efficacy the socks may or may not have.<br /><br />For me that's a problem."
3.0,These did not have the same strength in the sock that skidders brand has. They slide off of the foot and take constant adjustment. I prefer skidders.
3.0,The ombre in the photo is not how it looks at all. It's all pale blue and very short.
3.0,I hope i get what i order because its hard finding 6xl shirts for. If it the right order ill give it a 5 star
3.0,Beautiful bracelet but it's very small.
3.0,I ordered the masks hoping for 6 different ones. Was really looking forward to the skull mask. I received my masks and two are identical. The reason I ordered these was for variety. They are also different materials for each mask. Some are softer than others. Some are thicker than others. Glad I received them but kinda disappointed it wasn't what I ordered and paid for.
3.0,I thought these were going to be the same as a pair of cargo pants I bought from Blank awhile back. The material is different and less stretchy but still a nice pair of pants. Fits well. A little lower sitting than I thought.
3.0,looks cheap on and not the best shape in the back
3.0,As pictured but smaller than I expected. Didn't balance my face correctly.
3.0,My mistake and i didn't see where it was being shipped from !! It took a whole month! Its cute but i recommend for you to wash with care or else shirt will come off
3.0,"Material was not was expected,"
3.0,This was way to small for the posted sizes. I've purchased other ETOSELL products such as the Womens Solid Deep V Padded Bra Push Up Bra which fit great but this was much smaller for the same size. Would look great if it was larger. Bottoms were also very small.
3.0,The product fit great the only problem we had was rhe rip at the knee was a little too ripped. When he went to put them on it came completely apart leaving a big gap at the knee. Thus I had repair it with a patch at the knee which left him slightly disappointed!
3.0,As expected.  Works for my Halloween costume.
3.0,too big<br />I'm petite and tall and so tired of so called &#34;small&#34; clothing being too big.
3.0,"If you're looking for a hoodie that's made in the USA, keep looking. Decent quality. I'd go with the cheaper brand."
3.0,"Great hat with a great feel. Priced to match. But celebrating to early someone dropped the ball at the 95 yard-line/the 5 at the other end of the field. For such a nice hat, it did not come in an appropriate box, which was to small for its protection and was sent to me damaged torn right in the front. It's made of rice paper but that's no reason it should be damaged or malformed because of the to small of shipping box."
3.0,It was good. The earring is much bigger than shown in the picture though.
3.0,"5-10, 155 lbs. just about long enough wished a smidge longer, but to floor barefoot, ordered the large...the Belt is way too short, material is ok. I will be inquiring about that to the seller, overall they are cute pants for the price and I will most likely keep for a holiday party."
3.0,I have a small head and was suprised that it fit so tight. The lace band on the back was hanging and not sown on well. I had to sew it on myself. All and all it is a cute little cap to keep your hair in place.
3.0,Letters were coming off before even being washed.
3.0,"The price is good. However, they don't feel very cottony and are pretty small for me. I usually wear a medium to large women's glove. It is still a good deal for the price."
3.0,"I gave this bag 3 stars bc, it looks longer in the pic than it really is, it's actually smaller in width than advertised, but....the color is true, and it really is a nice looking bag........lots of space and compartments on the inside.  I thought it was tan trim but actually it's gold which does look good.  I'm very pleased......good with jeans or dresses for casual."
3.0,These pants are very thin. They run big too. I ordered a xlg because im a size 12/13 but they fall after 10 minutes of being on. Also I have to wear leggings under them or else I freeze.
3.0,"I usually wear a size L (165lbs, 5'5) but this swallowed me! The material/quality of the shirt is great very comfy but unfortunately, I had to return it (hence 3 stars). Not sure if this is Unisex sizing but i would need to go at least 1 or 2 sizes down for a proper fit."
3.0,"D-ring is a plus,  Beautiful and spacious!<br /><br />Unfortunately, the rope holding the carabiner tore or stretched and now it is barely connected so no longer able to use it."
3.0,"My 68 year old husband is having a crisis, that's all I can say!!"
3.0,"I really love this watch band. It matches my Series 1rose gold watch, was easy to size, and is comfortable.<br />The downside is that the finish has already started to wear off in spots, noticeably around the clasp. I’m disappointed, mostly because I’ll have to purchase a new band soon."
3.0,"Dress has a nice thick material, but it runs big. I suggest ordering a size down"
3.0,Too small for our hands so we never used
3.0,"ring faded quckly and stained. there should have been a warning...DO NOT GET WET...along with ring. but it was very inexpensive, and it showed"
3.0,"Had to order like a 4x.... Very stiff material, even after washing six times"
3.0,"I gave these in black and they fit perfect which is why l ordered 2 more pair yet the new ones, different colors, are too small."
3.0,"Bottoms are very cute and fit perfect, but I ordered a size up based off reviews and the top is very very large. There is nothing to make the top tighter the straps are not adjustable."
3.0,Would have been better if the bottom was brown and not black. Odd combination. Just bought a separate brown bottom.
3.0,"Good quality, but every once in a while the back disappears. It’ll unscrew itself and jump off my ear. For the price... it’s whatever."
3.0,They don't fit snug into the frames and they rattle sometimes
3.0,"Strong, lightweight, Large zip front pocket."
3.0,Not bad for it price
3.0,"When I ordered these fairly simple, yet boho-inspired yoga pants, I expected their arrival to be as straight-forward as they would be if offered from a catalog. This was not the case. They took a month and a half to arrive. Turns out, it was cause they came from China. I'm learning my lesson as of late that pretty much anything greatly discounted on Amazon that doesn't have a major brand attached to it, hails from some black hole in Asia, where they make....everything. My advise? Don't buy clothing on here. UNLESS it's Prime. Even then, if the photos depict Asian mannequins, and you're grass-fed Milwaukeean, the sizing isn't gonna work. And if it's not Prime, the returns will be a drawn-out bitch.  There are COUNTLESS US stores that carry everything you see on Amazon, you just gotta watch for sales. I think we've mostly all learned that just about everything on here that seems to good to be true money-wise, IS. You want boho and can't afford Anthropologie? Check out SEARS. Yup, Sears. Their Junior section has been carrying *great* boho for decades now. They have massive sales, constant coupons and like all American stores, you'll never wait more than a week. You want REALLY cool, original, lush boho? Check out ETSY. Not to mention, there's so much genuine vintage on there that you won't have to stress over not being able to go thrifting right now.<br /><br />Having said this, after my waiting hit the one month marker, I was certain I wouldn't want these pants once I got ahold of them. Especially after reading countless reviews of the stunning, flowy boho-wear that is SO my cup of tea, only to learn that people were getting utter crap from China. Stuff that didn't fit, that was made for one wear, and often not even remotely as pictured. But I have to say, I was ultimately somewhat pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The pants FINALLY bothered to show yesterday.  First impression was the pungent &#34;gluey&#34; smell that accosted my nostrils the moment I opened the parcel. Like ten times stronger than the typical &#34;new clothes smell.&#34; For now, I'm choosing to ignore any potential health implications, but I will definitely be doing a solo hand-wash for their first cleaning. I could easily see them pouring black dye. Plus, they kinda *feel* gluey too...like there is an &#34;aftertaste&#34; on my fingers after handling them. Not so much a residue I wish to transfer onto any other apparel.<br /><br />But the pants themselves, they're actually pretty damn-near as-pictured! They're all flowy and hand-cut looking and although they are clearly not cotton, they are super thin, so I just might be able to wear them in this heated NY summer. They have that built-in over-skirt, which is great considering the slight see-through factor.<br /><br />As for the size, like I said: CHINA. I ordered an XL and received the American equivient of a Junior's L, at BEST. I'm 5'8 and the legs are juuuuust barely long enough. Again: hand wash. Cold. Then pray ;-)"
3.0,"I’ve got pretty small wrists for a 5’11” guy, and I can barely get these to fit without cutting off my circulation.  The material and construction is absolutely fine, but the sizing is super small."
3.0,"Outfit looks as pictured nice material, dislike top could've  been a lil bigger"
3.0,"Really like these. Fit great, but very thin and see through. Most definitely will wear another part under."
3.0,"It's such a cute top in the pictures, but in person, it is a very cheap material and very see-through. I ordered a small (5'8&#34;, 120 lbs, B cup), and it's flowy but VERY short in the front. One thing I didn't realize when ordering is that the front is assymetrical to the back...so, the back is an awesome length, the front looks more like a crop top. Kind of seems like poor design to me--it would be way cuter in a symmetrical cut, but oh well. I don't think the shirt is worth the price, but I might be able to wear it once or twice to justify not having to deal with the hassle of returning it. Definitely not meant for anyone over 5'5&#34;."
3.0,"They are a bit short,  the traction portion is approximately one fifth less area of the bottom of the socks versus the other brands that I own.  Lastly,  I can see the pink of my skin through a fair bit of the sock,  which makes them thin enough to worry me about how long they are for this world with normal washer and dryer usage.<br />I  had high hopes.  They are  fair to middling as opposed to outstanding."
3.0,Generally the fabric & design is good and cute. But the skirt is a little bit too long and most importantly the neck & waist line was not lined up horizontally as showing on the picture. It is pretty comfortable and cute dress so I think I will enjoy wearing for long though...
3.0,"The material is not tie dyed, it is just a print of something tie dyed. The fit is large and loose but the collar is not as wide and slouchy as pictured in the ad. It is pretty soft and comfortable though."
3.0,"This is a nice sweater especially for the price.  The material feels good.<br />EXCEPT -<br />I am a XL and ordered an XL. It fit nicely but definitely not loose.<br />The problem I have with it  is it is way too long for my taste.  It ends about 2 inches below my jeans back pocket.  The sleeves are also way too long but I have no problem cuffing / folding them up a bit.<br />For the price I might keep it.  It is too bad it is made to fit, in looks only, like a 3/4 length coat.<br />VF"
3.0,"Not what I expected, very thin"
3.0,"Believe it when it says XXL.  I didn't pay any attention to it and ordered anyway.  They are so cute but just very big.  If they were not so big I would give 5 Stars.  But that's not the vendors fault, it was mine for not reading.  If you want a large size, these are great!"
3.0,"Looks nice in the box but it doesn't lay flat on your neck. As soon as you turn your head, one side of the other lifts up and points forward.  You could appear to be dowsing (finding water with a forked stick) or possessed.  Either way, I returned it."
3.0,I did like the design of them but they were a bit tight around my calves. My calves are a bit bigger so they would be hard to fit.
3.0,*update<br />I purchased 2 more pairs.<br />They do not all fit the same.<br />I'll attach pictures to show how much different they all are. I will be returning
3.0,The outfit is not shiny like the picture and it looks very cheap it look like something I could go to work out in
3.0,I could not create versatile styles due to short length of fabric.
3.0,"This is a nice slipper, fit and support were perfect. I ended up having to return them because the heel on the inside is so slippery my foot kept slipping off the side, made walking very difficult. Perhaps if worn with bare feet you won’t experience this issue."
3.0,"This chain is nice, smaller than I expected. I purchased this a gift for my mother in law, she was able to wear It for a while however about 2 months after continuous wear it has began to change color. Not the kind of thing you would like to happen with a gift to your mother in law. She did enjoy it for the time she was able to wear, but in the future I will splurge and get gold and hope the same does not occur."
3.0,Looks pretty but is REALLY sexy
3.0,It’s not bad but it Looks like is fading out. Easy to access cards.
3.0,"Well I used one ,good"
3.0,No support..very cute..not comfortable
3.0,"It is really cute and what I ordered but it’s HUGE. Normally I buy medium sports bras and I ordered a small on here and it fits like a large. So unless you have a big chest, size down or don’t buy lol."
3.0,Good material just way too sml
3.0,"These pants look cute, but they're made of an odd plastic-y material that feels a little weird when touching. They're decently comfortable, though, and they look like nice paper bag pants once on. Just the fabric is a little weird"
3.0,Cheap material stains easily.
3.0,2x is not a 2x wish I would have ordered a 3x ...looks good ...material is not like the hoodies I'm used to wearing..its ok
3.0,The material is soft and comfortable but the sizing is not proportionate.  The top is really loose but the bottoms are very snug and short.
3.0,"I am older so things are not as firm as they used to be.  I think I just need something a little larger so I do not fall out the sides.  Otherwise, I think the product would work great.  It held fine, I just had too much overflow."
3.0,"Ordered mint green, received a pale  blueish color.runs very small."
3.0,Cute ... the tape does not last long at all! If anyone buy these its better to use nail glue
3.0,"Really bummed as I thought I would love it! First off, the fabric has a little bit of a shine to it, which I wasn’t expecting. The arm holes/sleeve connections are set too low so that if you stretch your arms out straight, you get little bat wings at your armpits. It’s difficult to lift your arms up for the same reason. Finally, my fiancé pointed out that it’s almost like the two halves of the dress don’t go together. The top fits like a sexy body con type and the bottom fits like a casual maxi skirt, not like this cute, vintage flare as pictured."
3.0,The socks fit well and stay on nicely. I was a little upset that the first pair I put on had a big hole in it.
3.0,The fish shaped ones are too small to fit normal sized chapstick. Otherwise I’d give 5 stars
3.0,Not real leather but an okay boot.
3.0,Very heavy for a dress
3.0,The xxl I bought for my husband was tight on him. It definitely runs small.
3.0,The sleeves are short and will not protect from elbow to wrist. I am disappointed in this product.
3.0,Legs are way too long and way to wide. I ordered boot cut so they would slide over my boots with ease. They do. With five inches to spare. Remind me of bell bottoms
3.0,"I don't think I'll be keeping this wallet.  It doesn't have as many compartments<br />as I would like it to have.  It's pretty, though!"
3.0,"They fit weirdly around the head. The velcro strap is a bit too large and the back of the bunny hat is too short, so my whole neck and some of my back hair is exposed. It fits oddly but it is quite cute. I wouldnt buy again though"
3.0,"This is a nice hat, but despite my efforts to get the right size, this is a tad too small."
3.0,"Cute suite, bottoms are great very cheeky! Top is ok, mediocre padding and quality but looks super cute. Occasionally will use."
3.0,Cute for the price but not something that will last with heavy wear
3.0,"I like the suit. The colors are really pretty, but the top is not true to size. I bought an extra/large and the top fits like a med that was disappointing."
3.0,Nice for the 50's party but very small . The large is really medium and they don't make it in XL
3.0,"First time in my life I've ever said these words, but these sunglasses were TOO big for my head.  I have a  large head and have trouble finding hats and sunglasses that fit; especially at stores like Lids.  Thought I would give these a try, but they ended up being too large even for me.<br /><br />I plan on keeping them and wearing them when mowing the lawn and weed whacking this summer.  They seem very durable and unlikely to break, even if sat on."
3.0,"The bottoms fit fine, but the top was too big around my rib cage, although fit well for my boobs... no way to adjust.  i like the shorts enough to keep it and either wear with a solid top or try to take in the band ...  pattern is cute. Def seems like it will only last one summer, but the price redlects that and I wasn't expecting much more :)"
3.0,"I like it and I'll work with it, but I can't believe it's a 3x. The shoulders are really tight. I am going to attempt to alter it somehow."
3.0,The color is not as pink as I thought that it would be. It's more like a peach color.
3.0,"This by far is my favorite kigurumi to wear.. I wear it often as pajamas. Now there are many reasons for the low score, I'll explain. Reason 1)Upon arrival the costume was basically just shoved into the authentic typical ""kigurumi bag"" as if it either had been returned or just mistreated or something. Even the label that goes around the costume was all torn and what not. 2)Mistakenly I disregarded this (I wish I had taken pictures hindsight is 20/20) excites to try it on, and after getting it on I noticed the stitching was completely off in the crotch area and there was a huge hole. I then went online to Amazon to see if I could set up an even exchange. 3)Seeing as that wasnt an option and seeing as the seller had raised the price from only 49.99 to 79.99, I reluctantly fixed the stitching in the crotch myself. 4) after fixin and washing the costume only 1 time, the stuffing in the tail got all screwed up and got all stuffed into a tiny ball into the end of the tail. 5) at this point this was the straw that broke the camel's back, I contacted the seller in Hope's that they would do something.. anything to work with me.. and at the time I had several pictures of almost everything that had gone on minus the initial opening of the package, I'm sad to say I have since lost those pictures because I got a new phone and my old one was destroyed.  But I sent many pictures to the seller which really just turned out to be a waste of my time and data. The seller was completely unhelpful, refused to do an even exchange for me even though he had just change the price then day after I purchased mine, and refused to make it right and send me a new one.  As cute as this costume is.. I sincerely dont reccomend and would definitely not purchase this costume or from this seller ever again."
3.0,"the style is nice and the colors are great, but the band at the bottom that makes this top tunic length is too tight. Its wearable, but I would prefer a slightly looser fit there."
3.0,"The quality seems great, but the sox are very tight... Actually haven't worn them yet because of that"
3.0,"You get what you paid for, stylish but won't last long. Aren't comfortable."
3.0,"Uses: Birthday present for my wife.<br /><br />Pros: Very pretty and formal.<br /><br />Cons: The jewel popped out of one earring! Very disappointing, but it should be an easy fix for a jeweler."
3.0,The pearls are stuck together and very tiny. More suitable for a teenager.
3.0,Pants were great the first two wears. But now all of the seems are coming unraveled. They seem to be fitting looser than when first bought. Sad because I was so excited with them I bought 3 pairs total. :(
3.0,"They’re great I love the design (which is why I bought them) but they’re super itchy... I literally cannot stand them after 15min I have to take them off... I was reading some reviews about the itchiness, and I guess it would have to be depending how how sensitive your skin is... the lace is super soft, is more underneath where I habe itchiness... hope this helps"
3.0,"Very pretty ring, I just wish they had more size options since the largest was a bit tight"
3.0,They mostly do what they are supposed to but one of the masks wasn't finished on the top of the head. the sewing was way off. The other products were fine
3.0,In the photo the bra has a clasp back. The item I got does not open. Otherwise this item seems well made and is beautiful.
3.0,It broke already I just got it last week. Super glue it is
3.0,This did not look like the picture.
3.0,"Beautiful watch, difficult and rather uncomfortable watchband."
3.0,Very cute but small. Almost an ear cuff
3.0,They're good in theory but the string that digs into the back of my heels causing pain.
3.0,"THIS IS ADORABLE. I love the look of it as a phone strap. Very delicate and sailor moonish. Although, I’ve bought it twice because the moon breaks off of the thin metal holding it to the strap. Would be perfect if the plastic was a little better quality"
3.0,"Fit good, but I had to resew a piece."
3.0,Wrong one
3.0,"I bought these for my son and they are rather small in size (nice for a men's hoop) but possibly due that factor, they are incredibly difficult to fasten."
3.0,The appearance looks great but runs on the small side. There’s also a strong scent that nauseating so I left it on a hanger to see if the scent will decrease.<br /><br />Came back to update after leaving the coat on the hanger. The scent is gone but frustrated with packaging. The coat was folded and shipped in a plastic bag. Coat has a lot of wrinkles. Made every attempt to iron out and got about 80% after 30 minutes of trying. Normally a steam iron would do the job but I don't have one and I don't think a regular steam iron would do the job. May have to take it to the cleaners and pay as much as I paid for the coat.
3.0,Kinda cheap material but for the price it was to be coerced I suppose.  Fit as it said it would.
3.0,i received this item broken. If I return the item it will cost me to do so it didn't cost that much to buy therefore it would not be worth sending it back. I tried to send an message to the seller however I could not find an email to send a message.
3.0,A little cheap but it was the exact color I needed
3.0,I am planning on wearing it this weekend.
3.0,I love Ruby Road but the package was very slow arriving. It was just put in my mailbox. I haven’t even received it yet. I will go tomorrow to get it.
3.0,"The  material and workmanship is fine. The price is obviously good. There is an inner pockert and the material is thick for extra protection, which extends beyond the edge of the table.  The magnet holding the cover down is weak, but there is a strap for extra holding power. So why only ok? The top cover doesn't lie completely flat, because of a crease needed for the landscape position. I don't like the method to secure the tablet. A Velcro tab slides under the tablet once inserted into the viewing window. That secures the table well, but makes it difficult and unwieldy to remove for reading from tablet only. The nook hd is very reader friendly.  When the top cover is folded back for reading, the whole apparatus is too thick and bulky for reading comfortably, And how much does one need to use this is landscape mode anyway?"
3.0,"They are nice but bigger than they appear, my mom did not like them because the size is not the same as advertised."
3.0,"I LIKE IT IT DOES LOOK VERY NICE ...HOWEVER,  THIS IS NOT HEMATITE IS ""HEMATINE ' WITCH IS AN ARTIFICIAL MAGNETIC MATERIAL ...JUST CALL IT AS IT IS ....BUT DO NOT TRY TO  CHEAT THE CUSTOMER.....I WILL KEEP IT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS TRUE MAGNET HELP FOR PAIN .....WILL SEE"
3.0,I dont like how zipper works
3.0,There is a stiff card inside the pocket that goes behind the ear next to your head. Seems like the card is more just to keep shape than to be functional.
3.0,"This runs VERY small.  I went by the size chart and had to return twice.  Hopefully the 5x will fit.  I'm 5'1"" and 195lbs."
3.0,Wheels are noisy!! Not as large a the Fushcia Pink Trim Zebra Boarding Case Luggage~ would have liked the bigger size.  (Daughter got the Zebra case~ she LOVES it!)
3.0,"The apron itself is actually kinda nice, it's constructed fairly well and does its job. My main disappointment is with the image quality. It just looks blurry. As you can see from the photo, the camera is in focus but the lemons are not."
3.0,"I got these to use as exercise shorts based on the advertised poly/spandex fabric.  What I got is 100% nylon, with zero stretch.  For my purposes these are not going to work, which is annoying.  The inaccurate product description wasted my time, boo hiss. These are not really running or exercise shorts, they're just a basic swim suit with a mesh inner brief.<br /><br />On the sizing front, an XXL is a US size L, and fits like the standard L I usually get.  I'll keep these for beach use, but they unfortunately are NOT as described."
3.0,The body material is flexible as well as the sole material. The foot room was comfortable with the protective toe. When kneeling (steel toe turned up) the right boot sometimes had a bulge (suspected sewing mishap) that I had to slowly work out to flatten so as not to rub the top of my toes. The very front scuffed fairly easy - otherwise a comfortable boot.
3.0,Very thin and runs small
3.0,"I'm 5'7 175lbs for reference.<br />The dress is so cute and absolutely perfect for a night out but i had to do some altering! I ordered the xxl because I have a large bust and while the dress fit perfectly everywhere else it squished my chest and I could barely get it on. I took out the stitching and opened the fabric on the slip on the inside of the dress and I could breathe again! It's unfortunate that the people making this dress don't consider increasing bust size along with waist size but if you have the same issue as I did, it only takes about 5 min to open the inner fabric."
3.0,"The bow and arrow are actually pretty functional (even though they seem like they should not be used). The red “angel” wings were packaged as an outfit set. They are clearly labeled “devil” wings on the packaging and are smaller than I expected. Overall $15 is a little pricey for what you get, but costume stuff is always like that."
3.0,"Looks good, top of hat projects up a bit high, but ok if one pulls it down as far as it can go (which I don't).<br /><br />The material of the cap (main part of the hat) is very thin.  Not like the typical baseball hat."
3.0,after drying could not wear-shrank to much
3.0,"good, quick service.  looks and feels just want we expected.  would recommend this item if someone were looking for luggage that 'stands out'"
3.0,When this appeared on our doorstep and I got a close look at this thing.  It looks really cheap.  Save your money and get a real good one instead.
3.0,Fit well but had to go up 2 sizes. Not a great fit if you have muscular build. I'm a size 6-8 and ordered a medium but had to go up to XL to have them fit. I cinched the waist and now they are one of my favorite pair of shorts.
3.0,"It was pretty, but the band fell apart within a week."
3.0,"I wear jeans 16/18.<br />I ordered the black and blue pair of Romastory Women's 2 Pack Skull Print Tights Leggings Elastic Waist Workout Leggings Pants. The black one fits comfortably, but it stretches pretty thin and becomes transparent. A long tunic can help with that.<br />The blue one does not fit at all - didn't get past my knees.<br />The colors are ok, the material feels a bit cheap, but it's perfect for my costume.<br />It's not buttery soft, it's just stretchy. Feels like very thin swimsuit material."
3.0,Beautiful bra but was to small must order an extra size bigger
3.0,"Bought the black dress, not black its navy blue. Still cute though"
3.0,Decent polarized sunglasses.  Would be nice if there's a cleaning cloth.  The pouch bag can be used for cleaning but wouldn't recommend it.
3.0,I like the hat and mitts the scarf needs to be thicker
3.0,Too small. They give me an awful headache that lasts for 24 hours
3.0,These earrings are thin hoops. I was looking for something with a little more thickness. If you want thin large silver hoops they are great.
3.0,"I like it was what I expected, the color is not true red it has a pink hue to it."
3.0,Pretty but when wearing them for about a month the coding came off literally didn’t even go down to Silver it’s like a tarnished metal not cool because the stones are still beautiful but the setting sucks
3.0,If you don't have an hourglass shape don't buy.
3.0,The colors were a bit muted but they will serve their purpose.
3.0,Good but size not as expected .It is little small and it has only one main zip.
3.0,"El producto vino arrancada la etiqueta, con manchas en la espalda y agujeros producto de lo que sacaron las etiquetas"
3.0,Silver wore off quickly
3.0,Disappointed— the 3D imaging was not as 3D as the pictures appeared.
3.0,"Lights within the suit did not work, even after changing batteries.  Material was expected and the print is super fun.  Our son typically wears a Mens Medium; however the Size Large for him better."
3.0,I had to get the wrist band sized at a jeweler so the total cost for this item was much more than I wanted to spend.
3.0,Description said Women’s size 5 EU 36 but I had a hard time fitting them into my size 6 slippers. Also they are quite thin. I was looking for something to replace Dr. Scholls lambswool inserts but these are thinner and not as cushiony.
3.0,"Run small and tight, if you have 7 5/8 or large head, skip it! Quality is excellent!"
3.0,"Product was a little stiff and hard to get &#34;snapped.&#34; Other than that, they are okay."
3.0,"These socks are adorable and soft, but they shrank quite a bit and are extremely difficult to put on. They fit my 8 year-old perfectly. Good for her, bad for me. I'll be buying a different brand next time.,"
3.0,"I loved these earrings. They were pretty light weight, but not light enough for my sensitive ears. They were also a bit too big for my style too"
3.0,Wanted a dif tint
3.0,"Love the style. Mostly comfortable on face, but has to placed too tightly in order to avoid water getting in. Somehow, water seemed to get in at some point during my swim, always close to the nose bridge part. (My stats: slim face, very short hair) Tint is darker than my other goggles, which at times was uncomfortable for me, especially during 5am swims before the sun came up. I eventually adjusted to it somewhat. Goggles still fogged and had to be cleared during swims (tropical climate) like my previous goggles, but not as bad."
3.0,Looks really good. But size is way bigger
3.0,I had some of the brackets that the latch was missing or wouldn’t open at all.
3.0,Way to small but delivery was quick and great with the return
3.0,It’s okay but in the photo it looks like the flower 🌸 part is MUCH brighter and I bought it MAINLY because the color was important to me (that is why I gave it 3 stars) and it would make my Backpack look cuter but I might return it.🙄
3.0,"This is really pretty, but the clasp doesn’t stay closed and it has fallen off several times."
3.0,"Adorable outfit, but runs a bit small. Consider ordering up a sz."
3.0,really loved this but i dropped it down the sink trying to get it in :(
3.0,They are made well but not to size for plus woman
3.0,"probably should of went up a size, thought there was more spandex too it"
3.0,Waist fit perfectly. If you have thicker thighs it may be a bit snug when you sit. The jeans did come as described in the picture. I wear a size 12-14 and got XXL. The fit around the legs were decent when standing. The holes were just a bit more than what I was expecting.
3.0,Not happy with the color. Was expecting brown. It is a brownish tone. Not my favorite color.
3.0,"Super cute and breathable, however the paint pot is a lot bigger than the one in the picture and the paint starts really low. You almost can’t tell what’s even going on. It fits me pretty big but I’m a small human so tying it will do just fine."
3.0,"Kinda disappointed, quality was kinda off, thin for my taste. I'm 180 pounds 40' 37' 42' ordered a Xl for a more loose fitting dress which still hug my curves but could have ordered an L though. The print is the same but upgrade the quality and it would be 100%."
3.0,"I've used this umbrella only a handful of times since I got in because it's just not sturdy.  It opens easily, but it doesn't close very well.  The ""arms"" don't seem to want to close back down compactly.  I feel like I have to force them closed in order to wrap the velcro closure around it and secure it."
3.0,"Do not buy if you aren't below a size 10. I love the design, but the fit is a little rough."
3.0,"I've been looking for a kelly green tunic or dress to have on hand for St. Patrick's Day.  I have two similar tunics from two other labels that I purchased from Amazon and I like them both a lot. This tunic went on sale for $10, so I bought it.  It's...ok.  If I had been able to try it on in a store, I probably would have passed on buying it.  The material is Jersey-like, but shiny almost like nightgown material and the hem isn't even, though it's not an asymmetrical hem.  But, it is comfortable and the color is very vivid.  I don't think other people will notice the uneven hem.  I might attempt to fix it myself or take it to the local alterations shop."
3.0,Doesn't stay on top of your wrist. Have to keep placing it all day long. Plus it pulled apart on first wear. But easily put back together.
3.0,Ordered plus size. Recommend ordering a size up.
3.0,Wish I’d read the reviews. Love the shirts but SUPER small. Had to return the med and size up to the large.
3.0,"Ok I've ordered from tough cookie's several times, but this time  a 3 pack but only received 1 shirt. I love tough cookies produce but disappointed about this order $29 for one shirt? I think not. Would be nice if someone could get a hold of me."
3.0,"Nice wallet, very comfortable but the chain is very cheap. Only stayed on for about 2 days. My husband had to lay on the ground to look under our vehicle and the chain broke. We fixed it but then about section. So he's going to look for a different chain."
3.0,Poor quality material. Somewhat see through. The dress bunched up a bit in the back on the bottom making an upside down V shape. I’m 5” 3” and 118 lbs. I ordered a small. And extra small would have been very short. It has shoulder pads which looked nice! Returned.
3.0,"Shoulder area and stomach area not as expected, not as flattering as expected"
3.0,Not as long as I was expecting
3.0,Runs very very small. Material is cheap.
3.0,"The fabric is poor quality, and the size is too big.  I will use it, but not like I thought I would."
3.0,"Genius idea, but I wish the ends were made of leather instead of vinyl or whatever. I would pay for the better material bc of potential mishaps with a kid using it on themselves. Keep in mind you do get more than one. Soooo when one breaks use the next one."
3.0,OVER PRICE
3.0,The earrings showed up late which bugged me but I was still excited when they arrived. When I opened up the package I noticed they were not as the image shows. They look cheaply made and they have bumps/black lining that shouldn't be there on them. Though for the price I guess they are good. They hurt my ears *but my ears are sensitive* Overall I give them 3 stars.
3.0,Runs small. Foot booties are really thin completely expect holes to develop soon.  We'll see how the colors fair after the wash.
3.0,Wasn't that happy with these. A little too small for my fiance and weren't as comfortable as he expected. Won't be purchasing again.
3.0,the glasses is look nice but it’s loose.  it’s bigger than my face.
3.0,"I didn’t like that the straps were too long or too stretchy. It’s ok for the price but didn’t fit as expected. Also, a bit see through. Color is a nice yellow so it was as expected."
3.0,"Service was great, watch is beautiful and I hope it is sturdy and will last. I get lots of compliments but the only negative is the plastic in place of mineral crystal but what do you expect for the reasonable price, otherwise this watch is great for the price."
3.0,The button cap on the jeans spin and pop but they're still secure after a week. I'll give an update if anything changes.
3.0,The waist on these was too big. The second time I wore them they got a hole.
3.0,Top to snug
3.0,Okay for the price.  Go with a half size larger though.
3.0,"The fabric is described as &#34;cotton polyester, very stretchy&#34;. Very stretchy indeed, but not cotton. It is actually a shiny nylon/poly/ spandex blend. It's swimsuit fabric. Maybe it was intended to be a swim coverup?  That being said, it is a cute (shiny) dress. Not sheer at all even though there are white stripes. I wore mine layered over a navy tank and you couldn't see where the tank ended. I am tall 5'10 with a 36d chest and the large was a little snug. I probably would have been happier with a larger size but there isnt one. It hits me about 4 inches above the knee. I love the cute pockets and the way it falls away from my midsection though. Didn't shrink or fade when handwashed and line dried. I just wish it were made from t-shirt fabric instead. Oh, and I paid a little extra for the express shipping and it came from China in less than a week."
3.0,"I normally wear an XS or S. I bought the small and wish i had bought the medium. Run small, and the pants are low waisted. Not as comfortable as other 100% merino sets that I have, somewhat itchy."
3.0,I love this jacket’s fit and style. It does a good job of keeping me warm and dry. Only issue i have worn it about four times and a cord has already broken on the hood. Any way to get this replaced?
3.0,Nice shirt but runs small in bust area
3.0,"I love the glasses the size is exactly what I want, how ever they are a little heavy on my face so I have to adjust them a few times but I still love them"
3.0,The material is a tad tighter than what i expected but still fits good. Got alot of compliments when I wore it
3.0,"Bought this for a cheap price. However, the quality is not as expected. The frame is easy to scratch. And my old lenses don't fit this frame so I have to order a new pair of lenses.."
3.0,My wife said it fits and runs small.
3.0,"This is just ok, not worth $39.99 IMO.<br />I really wish all sellers would provide all measurements for each size! But free returns offsets that problem a bit.<br />I'm hourglass shaped, 38DDD, 5'8&#34; tall. 2X was huge and I spent HOURS trying to decide between XL and 1X and exchanged for 1X. I read reviews and the answered questions on most of the tunics from CATALOG CLASSICS and Parsley & Sage trying to piece together size info - that's way more work than an ok quality article of clothing is worth!<br />1X is still a little big but I don't want to hassle with another exchange in case XL is too small (see why listing measurements would help?). (For those who are trying to find out, the 1X is 32&#34;long from nape to bottom hem.) For me this tunic is a little big in the shoulders. It just looks kind of frumpy. The fabric is quite thin and I'm afraid a closer fit would cling to my flaws and be very unflattering. According to reviews it does shrink some in the wash; hopefully it'll shrink in a good way.<br />I thought I'd be safe to order some of the other tunics once I knew my size with this company. Given the quality vs. pricing, I probably won't order again. I'm very limited in ordering from this company anyway because there isn't enough sizing info provided and most of the products are not Amazon Prime so returns are not free."
3.0,"I bought the shirt for my mom's boyfriend for his birthday and he LOVED it!. It fit perfectly and was well made. The reason why I didn't give a 5 star rating is because the shirt arrived in the bag like a 4 year old had "" folded "" it. It was balled up and mangled. Very sloppy and not professional at all."
3.0,"I normally wear sizes 1XL to 3XL, depending upon the brand. When I got this shirt, it looked great. The colors and graphics are great. The material is very lightweight and comfortable, and perfect for the warmer months. BUT... I ordered a 3XL, which should have been more than enough to fit me. It wasn't. It fits like a Large at best. I'm 6'6"" and 380 lbs. Some companies' products fit awesome at 3XL, while a few have actually been a bit big. This one WAY too small. I couldn't even come close to pulling the shirt together to button it.<br /><br />So, keep in mind, you will need to order about 4 times the size that you normally need. That's unfortunate for us bigger guys, because it is a nice shirt otherwise. I hope the manufacturers see this and properly size their shirts in the future."
3.0,Got these for my 10 year old and had to send Them back because they were what too short. I got them because In the picture they looks like they were a little longer. Nope1111
3.0,"I ordered these in black, in a medium. They only had 2 colors available at my time of order. The fit of these was fine and I'd say true to size. When I first put them on they were fine but after several hours I was looking forward to taking them off -- they were itchy!!!!! I'm not sure if this is due to the material makeup or poor quality of cotton or too-tight stitching... but I know they don't feel nice.<br /><br />For only about $7 more, I can order a way nicer pair off Etsy, that's available in an array of colors.<br />I will be returning these."
3.0,"I like the material it’s made of. It is very soft. I purchased the XL. I have a bit of a gut☹️ And this does not rap around to front.I pull it around and it kinda covers but not much. It just hangs on the sides. It’s also does not stop the cold from getting through the fabric. Maybe I should of bought a larger size,but I usually buy XL anyway my waist size is 10-11"
3.0,"While these leggings are soft and comfortable, they are see through. I could see my pink underwear when I looked in the mirror. Not so much. They are going back."
3.0,Unfortunately this ring so pretty does not live up to its picture
3.0,Cute but the latches are very weak. One of mine fell out the day after I got them. It’s unfortunate because they are cute but are not secure. I think finding a different pair may be more quality.
3.0,Fits a bit funny.
3.0,"It's nice to have a single wallet like this for my young teenage boy, but it doesn't fit much even for someone without a part-time job!  It fits a few bills in the center, along with a card or two on the outsides.  It's definitely stiff right now, which I expect to a point with leather, but it's stiff enough that it's hard to get the money in the center.  Maybe with time it will break in."
3.0,I love it except the elevator key puncher broke very easily!
3.0,"Beautiful dress, however I ordered a large and received a small. I was able to get it on but I am returning it for the correct size."
3.0,Good deal if you look @ the quality.
3.0,Zero support. It's very thin and flimsy. It's ok if just at home or to sleep in. Would not wear out.
3.0,"Sorry for this bad review.  But I really thought since these were priced a little higher they would have worked better or lasted longer. Put these on my grandson's coat three days ago and they already broke.  Cheap made. Might have well just bought the cheap ones. I'm going to take the other clamps off (on the ends) and just sew them to his coat. That'll do it.<br /><br />However, this outfit has a GREAT customer service dept. They truly care about their customers and our satisfaction of their products. Would buy from again (just not this item). Thank you for your great service."
3.0,"THE DRESS IS OKAY, IT DID FIT, BUT IS NOT WHAT I REALLY NEED AND I WILL BE RETURNING IT IN EXCHANGE FOR ANOTHER FANCIER."
3.0,"Love the set, very comfortable. I just wish the color had not faded so quickly - I used cool wash & dry setting, but fabric still faded quickly."
3.0,I loved this but it turned colors super super quick
3.0,"Will never order again if it said from China, this one took a little over 1 Month."
3.0,When these first arrived they were gorgeous but the fabric where your foot stands was very soft and slippery.  I slid a few times before my feet naturally stomped down the fluff.  After two weeks of regular use (approximately 1-2 hours per week) they are very beat up - no padding and worn looking.  It's like walking on a thin piece of fabric since the padding has worn down so much.  They were great to begin with but I don't wear them now because they don't provide enough cushioning.
3.0,I loved them but I usually wear a lg. but am right now (need to lose weight) so the lg. did not work. Love the compression but I don't know what size to order. It would be great to wear those instead of sub hose. Any Info I could get from the company I would appreciate it. TY
3.0,It was a comfortable shirt but it's fit was small so I returned it.  The shirt itself was great but the arms were super tight.
3.0,"The ZISTA Round Champagne Garnet Heart Pendent is a nice necklace for costume jewelry.  The pendant is a nice size-not too big and not too small.  If you are not getting real diamonds, this is a nice gift for Valentine's Day or any other occasion.  While overall I like it, I do have a few issues with this necklace.  First, the packaging was excessive. Secondly, the garnet color is not a deep red garnet.  The stone in the heart is more of a light pink color.  Finally, and most importantly, the chain is not very nice.  It's stiff and reminds me of chains that tarnish easily.  Overall, the pendant is nice but the seller should pair it with a better chain."
3.0,"I like this dress. It is a beautiful office dress if you pair it with a blazer (as the blazer helps conceal how thin the material is) and take the blazer off for a nice dinner dress if the restaurant is dark enough to not let the thinness of the material show. a full body slip is how I'm handling the thin material matter. I tried just a waist down slip but the material is so thin the waist band of the slip showed. So I am ordering a full body fitted slip to fix the problem (I need a full body slip anyway so i I'm going to invest the money in it, but it does make this a much more expensive dress by having to add stuff like this to make it wearable). It's too bad cause it's a really great dress- just super thin. It also runs big IMO. I'm 5'1&#34; and 105 and ordered a S and as you see from the pics it's pretty big on me. But it's cheap enough that I'm going to keep it since with a blazer  it's work appropriate and I am short on work dresses at the moment. But, not in love with this dress. Bummer."
3.0,Nice but not as sturdy or dark as I was hoping for.
3.0,"Bought this for my husband for his jui jitsu rash guard under his gi. He is 5' 11"" and about 180 with a slight belly and he says it fits a little tight in the mid-chest area and a little ""pinchy"" in the arm pits. Design is good. Fit is a little tight but he said it's not a deal killer."
3.0,"After 15 minutes of removing tiny plastic tags and cutting out the scratchy paper or whatever those are made from tags from inside the slipper, I had a soft warm washable slipper. Of all the things made in China that are too small, these slippers were oddly slightly too big. Now I have to find time to free the rest of the slippers."
3.0,I can’t wear them longer then a day without my ears hurting. I don’t know why.
3.0,This charm really was nice however the little eye stone came off within a few weeks. It's so small you really don't notice much.. But I rather have it on cuz it really looks nice with it. The chain and charm keeps its luster though.. So it's pretty good considering.. If it wasn't because of the stone coming off<br />. it would be 5 stars
3.0,Fits well but the fabric is itchy even after several washes.
3.0,"They fit very well, and I like the adjustable straps. They worked so well and were so comfortable at first, but they soon got very cottony and made me not able to breathe well. But they are nice"
3.0,super thin but great for working out
3.0,Sleeve is too long... Body shape is good...
3.0,"Love the band and the value, fits my Gear S3 Classic perfectly. However twice now the pin connecting the clasp to the band has fallen out. The second time my watch fell off and hit concrete. It is very upsetting when a product causes damage to another product and their is nothing you can do about it."
3.0,"The shape of shirt is nothing like shown on the 90 lb model!  I will wash this and  keep it for sleeping in!  This seems to be a common problem with Amazon photos...models are very tiny, almost anorexic like  models on the runway!  They dont 't resemble standard size!  If you want really clingy, this is for you.  It certainly won't cover up any lumps or rolls that anyone has."
3.0,They are exactly as pictured. Cheap but wearable. The smallest pair are unusable because they are badly misaligned but not enough of an issue to return. I knew what I was buying and getting.
3.0,"When I saw this top, I thought it was stylish and something I would love to wear. I was excited to wear it as soon as it arrived but as soon as I took it out of the package, I was so disappointed. It’s so itchy. I washed it, assuming... well hoping it would get softer after being washed and dried. It didn’t. It did wash well; no fraying seams and no shrinkage, so that’s good. I ordered a medium, but I could have gone with a small. I have a little more weight on me than usual (5’4 128lbs, usually 120lbs) so I wanted to be safe. I believe it’s more form fitting and if you have the right size, it would look great for any figure. The fabric is not see through and is kind of warm. But it is itchy. I can only wear it for an hour or two before it’s just too annoying and I have to take it off. I’m not usually bothered by most fabrics so this was surprising and disappointing to me. It must be cheap, poor quality fabric. For that I deducted two stars. If it wasn’t so itchy, it would be a really nice, fashionable sweater."
3.0,"I bought these in both pink and charcoal. I had been looking for high waisted capris to wear with open midriff shirts. The fit is much lower than shown in the photo, it barely touches my hips. Oddly the charcoal pants are looser than the pink ones even though they are both the same size. They are very comfortable though and appropriate for both casual and work."
3.0,"I take a 9 1/2 shoe size so I ordered a size 10 slipper, as suggested.  This size is too big & I had to use a pair of inserts to alleviate the problem.  Also, the soles are not rubber so it's very noisy when I walk."
3.0,"It does look nice and retro, but you get what you pay for with its electronics and display, as it’s quite limited in its functions and user interface. I was hoping add a NATO strap and become a watch person but I don’t think this $15 one has quite convinced me..."
3.0,Material is heavy yet see through. Returned them.
3.0,"Overall, nice dress. Pretty and well sewn.<br />Downfall, its see through and thin."
3.0,These just arrived and all the instructions are in Chinese. Do you put the fuzzy side up or down in your shoes?
3.0,good for gift
3.0,"I LOVE THE FIT AND FEEL OF THIS WALLET. IF I DID NOT BUY IT EXPECTING IT TO ALSO BE RFID BLOCKING, I WOULD RATE IT 5-STARS. HOWEVER, EVERY TIME I TESTED IT WITH MY CREDIT CARD IN ANY DIFFERENT LOCATION IT DID NOTHING TO BLOCK THE SIGNAL."
3.0,"Loved these joggers, nice and soft but they run really large."
3.0,Nice metal band....sent wrong 20mm sliver push rods
3.0,"Much much smaller than expected, it would look good on a little girl than a grown woman."
3.0,"This suit runs small. Order 1 to 2 sizes up, especially if you have a long torso. I returned mine and did not reorder."
3.0,A little cheesy but they were the only horns we could find in time for Halloween. They served the purpose but had a big white tag on one of the horns that had to be cut off leaving a white strip on the side of the horn. I colored it with a red marker.
3.0,"The hood is not large enough to go over a jacket hood, leaving the face and the forehead exposed. It's very cute, fits my small 4 year old fine but I need a rain hat to protect the head. What I really want is a larger iplay rain poncho (folds into own pocket) that I had, but it looks like they stopped making them."
3.0,"Great luggage, very comfortable, but has bubbles  on the top coat as you can see in other pics. Will keep it, just because its very comfortable!"
3.0,"Nice shorts, they look like they will last, good fit. Embroidery looks good.<br /><br />However two of three pairs I received had the label plastic T-connector sewn INSIDE the waist hem rather than through the fabric like normal, as if they tagged the leg when the shorts were half made, then sewed on a hem over the tag. So whether you pull or cut the tags, the 1cm plastic end-T piece that held the tag remains in the waistband to poke you every time you wear them, unless you unhem the waist to get it out, snip a hole in the fabric, or do what I did - sit there for 20 minutes per pair with a needle, gradually stretching the thread of one stitch hoping you don't ruin your $45 shorts, until there is enough of a gap to slip the tag T-connector out of the hem."
3.0,It looks great but the tassels at the bottom shed as bad as my dog....
3.0,"I wish the chin strap was velcro or something else, my baby just constantly unties the bow"
3.0,"Fits, works well but is thin t-shirt material so not for dressy outfits. Works well with casual attire."
3.0,"I use paste silver polish for large silver platters etc. but wanted something more practical for jewelry. I had another silver polishing cloth for many years that was also treated with something to remove tarnish, and I was hoping this would be the same. This new cloth does do the job but, unfortunately, it's messier. It uses some kind of powder to accomplish the tarnish removal where my old cloth did not. This new cloth is OK but I would prefer the former type if I knew where to purchase it."
3.0,Hoping for better quality but still a nice dress.  Was a little big on my daughter.
3.0,"So I ordered one of these rings a size 8 when it arrived it was too small, they sent me a size 6 instead :(. But I just turned it into a necklace and it’s actually cute !"
3.0,Very flimsy fabric but I get compliments
3.0,"These belts don't wow me, but I don't hate them either. The quality isn't the best (nothing like real leather.) I feel as if they might split apart within a few months. They are cute on, the buckle itself is heavy and has a nice polished (not knock off look to it.) You have to touch it or look closely to see the cheapness of it. I find it to be true to size. I wear a small and that's what I got. It fit perfectly. They did package these belts in a very nice cloth bag. That was a big plus. Overall would I repurchase? Probably not. I'm going to keep them because returns are a hassle. Just being honest."
3.0,"Before washing these masks worked great. The were relatively comfortable, the ear loops were better than some I have tried. However I put these in the wash, and the breathing valves came off. This didn’t happen with a similar style mask I own. So, if you get these be sure to hand wash, and expect them to take a day to dry"
3.0,"It's cute, I just don't like how it fit on me, it doesn't last long sadly and the strings are pretty cheap"
3.0,"This produce was okay. I liked it, it used way less foundation which is great because I hate the feeling of wearing foundation. This sponge blends the product nicely but I had to finish with my original sponge. That's why I rate with 3 stars."
3.0,They are warm and cozy but have been worn twice and holes in the toes have formed. Not sure they will last the winter season.
3.0,"I ordered a medium and the shirt fit as expected. I gave the shirt three stars because the material was not cotton. Instead, it's a cheap thin stretchy like material. The shirt that I received looked like a cheap knock-off of the shirt in the picture. Definitely not worth the money. I'm not returning the shirt because I'm not up for the hassle of returning it. I suppose I'll​ find some use for it."
3.0,Was ok hung different then the picture
3.0,The waste hits funny and the material feels thick.
3.0,"The over all quality is fine but it’s small. The bag is at least half the size I thought it would be, especially for $18.00! Would not purchase again."
3.0,"Ok looking, larger than size, doesn’t look as good as the photo,"
3.0,"Returned it - the cups in the suit were too small, so your boobs are sort of falling out. However the bottoms were HUGE."
3.0,haven't been able to get it to fit yet...
3.0,"The earrings were as described, and arrived on time. I was hoping for some that would &#34;climb&#34; my ear, and stay that way. These did not remain in the &#34;climbing&#34; position. I had to continuously adjust them back to where I wanted them. They aren't cute if you just let them hang like they want to. I ended up returning them. They didn't work for me at all."
3.0,Product was broken upon arrival in the mail but we were able to fix it with pliers.  Clasp did not work so we have to cut it to open it up to put on and use a safety pin as a clasp.
3.0,This outfit was way too large. My daughter is 2 months old. I ordered the 0-3 months. She is 11 lbs and swims in it. It's so darn cute that I'm going to tuck it in the back as make it work.
3.0,"I liked it, but it was the wrong size, and I had to return it.  Will definitely purchase in a different size."
3.0,Nice one piece. I purchased this for an aquatics class I was taking.  Fits a little lose but nothing major.  The legs don't run up which I was very happy about.  The only issue is that there were some holes that appeared along the strap.  This suit was hand washed and hung to dry only.  I don't know how it got torn.
3.0,"Loved the design, had to remove the padding, but no tummy control at all"
3.0,It’s a hat it’s an apron for a child what would you want me to say about it somethings are better left unsaid
3.0,They are very pretty but you have too get a size in a half up! Toes were hanging out front
3.0,So far so good the pockets are awesome it also come with a slit in the side so you can use your pants pocket. Im 5&#34;6' weight 166Ibs with Borat shoulder the lab coat is baggy and come down an inch past my knees. It will feels nice and allows a lot of movement. I would prefer a slightly smaller size but not enough to do an exchange. Very easy to do and undo the snap. Haven't used it for class yet
3.0,This is way too big to fit anyone unless they're a man. I opted to use the charms to make necklaces rather than send it back all the way to China.
3.0,"These are cute, but they run a bit small"
3.0,"Warm and fashionable. The size eight fits my palm perfectly (size  8 hand) though the fingers may be a bit short for those with longer fingers. For the same reason as before, the fitting is slightly awkward and the gloves feel thick when trying to  do other activities. Great if you have shorter fingers!"
3.0,"These masks are very comfortable and cute but depending on the size of your child they may not fit. Way to big for my 6 year old. A little too big for my 11 year old and not big enough for an adult. I happened to have small clips for the ear loops and so I could make them the correct size for my kids, but as they come wouldn't have worked. Good quality and value just not good sizing."
3.0,"Much longer than it looks in the picture and basically made out of stretchy fabric. I bought this to wear to dinners when I went on business trips, but I don't know if now looking at it if it would suit."
3.0,Nice but not shawl like
3.0,Pretty colors but are very thin and kind of small and have a very thick seam
3.0,I just don’t like the length of the split bell sleeves.  Seems excessive and gets in my way. Very pretty though.
3.0,"A tad smaller than expected,  but I still like them!"
3.0,"It’s an ok coat but I think I paid too much. The color is more taupe than beige or tan.  The xs fits well through the shoulders but I do have some complaints. The coat arrived badly wrinkled and I may have to take it to a professional cleaner to get the wrinkles out. The belt at the waist is too long and does not tighten properly around my waist, so I will have to tie it instead of using the buckle. The belt buckle seems very cheap and rickety. The black trim at the wrists and collar is definitely not real leather and also feels very cheap. It is not warm at all and is really only appropriate for late spring through early autumn.  I’m going to keep it since I like the color and it will go with almost anything, but I would not have paid this much for it."
3.0,Cute shirt. It fit as expected
3.0,Not as thick as expected and sizes were small
3.0,The price is great.  It is easy to use and hold Fitbit well.  I love it. it is hard to put in on.
3.0,"Runs true to size as I'm 5'5"" and wear size 6 and small fit great. Very comfortable and it has back pockets which is important to me. I will caution you that these are quite long and I had to cut 3 inches off for them to fall at a decent length for me. Unfortunately I lost the cute bottom fray in the process and these will likely fray on their own after wearing and washing a few times but probably not evenly.<br /><br />If you found my review helpful please mark it as helpful below - thanks!"
3.0,Smaller than I had imagined
3.0,Wrinkles bad in dryer even if you pull it why its still a little damp and hang it up.
3.0,"The tiny buttons on the arms are too difficult to do on, but you can't do them before you put it on. Too small one the chest,  but still a lovely overall look. It just isn't right for my body type. It also doesn't look see through in three pictures,  but it is. Have to pair it with a cami."
3.0,Cute but the band is very thin and fragile. It started peeling apart on one corner during the first week.
3.0,Used it once. Wraps good.
3.0,Wife loved the ring. She has had it about a month and its turning color. Going to try to see if I can fix it.<br />Pros:<br />Looks great<br />Perfect fit<br />Cons:<br />Turned color fast
3.0,I liked the product a lot  I just didn’t like it on me . I was very upset with myself because I really wanted to wear it
3.0,I absolutely love the material and the color was exactly what I was looking for but I was disappointed that it fit big. I orgianllay ordered in a medium and have now re-ordered in a small. Hope it fits!
3.0,"The fit on this dress is amazing. However, it is thin & the khaki colour is more like a light yellow."
3.0,"a lot smaller than expected but still very cute and good quality. Make sure to tighten the loop where the keychain holds onto, it ended up falling out but we found it."
3.0,"Feels like rubber, bought one size bigger should of went two size larger"
3.0,"Way too small, like 2 sizes too small but would have been cute.  A booty or a belly significantly shortens the dress.  Positive: cute design and fast shipping."
3.0,Fits well but fabric is very papery feeling.
3.0,So so material. Very long.
3.0,Don't really care for it. I should have gone for a more expensive and well-known brand as I usually do.
3.0,They were so pretty but it kept breaking 👎I  had to play misses fix it a couple times.
3.0,Love the look of the shoe but its a bit wide at the toes and my feet slide when walking.
3.0,not really what i expected. i thought it would look different from how it actually did so i didn’t really like it. when i put it on it didn’t really feel like i had anything on my head.. the material is good quality but i thought that the material was going to be thicker than it was.
3.0,"Very comfortable, may be difficult to put on for anyone with mobility issues. Does not support as well as pictures show on larger sizes."
3.0,Even though this dress was a bit snug below the chest area I wore it anyway. I felt cute and got a few compliments. It wasn’t until I got home that I realized both front seams were busted open! I had on a blazer so I didn’t see it until I took it off.<br />I bought a 1X and I’m 5’6 219 lbs
3.0,"PLAN ON RETURNING, MY FOOT SLIPS THROUGH THE OPEN TOE FRONT. USUALLY WEAR NARROW BUT THESE AREN'T NARROW ENOUGH."
3.0,It feels comfortable and is warm as long as you wear a heavy sweater underneath the coat . It is light and is not for weather 20 and below.
3.0,"I have two other pairs of these sandals and love them. I wear them year-round on tile floors, either with or without socks depending on the season.<br />When the new ones arrived, I saw that the company had changed several factors. Most important, they made them smaller. The attached picture shows the old size 6 (2XS) in light blue next to the new size 6 in dark blue. The old sizing that had fit me perfectly is now a little too narrow and too short.<br />The color seems a little darker than it should be, more like black than blue, but that's a minor point compared to the size change.<br />Finally, the foot bed is more firm than the old pair. I like the less-squishy feel, but I don't think I can wear this new size. I've ordered the next size up, but if it doesn't fit, I will have to change to another brand, in which case I would give this item a lower rating.<br />It's very disappointing when a company ruins a good thing. Telic's own website said it was sold out of every type of Z-strap sandal, and they have never responded to Amazon reviews that I've seen, so I assume they're having a lot of trouble. Or, to put it less charitably, they suck."
3.0,"I'm not going to dis the seller, BUT !!! If you're going to buy a ""Rainbow Moonstone"" Expect to pay about 3-4 Times this ammount, this is because true Rainbow Moonstones are classified as rare. Now you can find normal moonstones for this price which is likely what the seller has, so the price is right for this ring. It's very beautiful. Before buying any gem stones do your homework first so you know what to look for for the money you will pay."
3.0,The shirt is really cool but the sleeves don't fit the shirt. It's a mock baseball shirt and is tight fitting which is expected but the sleeves are huge and baggy it just doesn't make sense.
3.0,This is not a sweater.
3.0,Disappointed- looks cute but the fabric is a big let down
3.0,"Very large for a Large. Very thin, have to wear something under it."
3.0,Don't love the material or the baggy bottom. These are just okay.
3.0,"Happy with this design!!!! Lower portion of suit, not satisfy with fit....still on the edge regarding exchange....."
3.0,"It's an ok LSAT watch. The crown seems very difficult to get out an adjust, which makes it very inconvenient for LSAT purposes.<br /><br />I ended up getting the Mastermind LSAT Watch. Yeah, it is more money, but it is worth it."
3.0,Left black stain on my hands; washed the gloves twice and color seems settled down.
3.0,"I got it because I planned on running more, and it worked fine for yoga and light impact activities, but before I even worked up to running, the straps started coming undone."
3.0,"They work great for what I need them for but they do not last very long, about two washes and they are falling apart. Also they have a tendency to roll at the top."
3.0,They are super cute but I guess cheaply made.  The top wing part popped out the second day I wore them.  So I didn't get to enjoy them much.
3.0,I liked fabric but it was too large and way too long.
3.0,"Back pockets ripped off on both sides, luckily I know how to sew th back, also rips on knees are twice the size of the photo. But 5’7” 150lbs and fit a size 9 perfect."
3.0,"Weird fit. Too sort, to big, not a wine red, but a bright red. Just jot great"
3.0,"I'm a busty girl (34F) and it fit awkwardly in the chest area for me.  If you're not a huge fan of showing cleavage this is not the dress for you because the girls take center stage.  Would I buy it again....no.  However, I wasn't unhappy to the point of returning it."
3.0,"My daughter wore it one time and the pocket ripped. Loved the look of it, but didn't last long."
3.0,"I’m really torn on this set because I wanted to like it so much. The color is very faint. Supposed to be pink tie dye and it’s more white with a few pink stripes than anything else. Doesn’t really bother me. The top seems abnormally big yet short at the waist. I’m 5’9” and it comes just to the top of the shorts. The shorts are comfortable, a little short but very comfortable. The lining of the top is a polyester material and not cottony soft in case that matters to you."
3.0,It shows it as a open front cardigan. I got a long sleeve tee shirt.
3.0,Ordered 2 pairs one size was was true to size the other which was just one size under was so much smaller and so tight. Had to send back both pairs since they were ordered for twins and the one pair that fit also<br />Came with a rip in it
3.0,This rescue tube works OK as long as you don't try to wrap it around a victim and clip both ends together.  There are other rescue tubes on Amazon that do include this clip
3.0,"Great material, but too large. I'm a size 2 and ordered a small"
3.0,Came with a thread pulled on front of top... looks old before even get to wear it
3.0,"Es bonito,  pero está mejor en la foto"
3.0,"The band is attractive and fits decently.  However, the portion that holds the Vivosmart HR has edges that cause the apparatus to feel much too ""metallic"" in comparison to the supple Vivosmart HR original band.  The edges should be more ""rounded"" or ""cambered"".  This would serve to remove the harshness and mimic the suppleness of the original equipment.  I have become more accustomed to the band with time."
3.0,These were cute necklaces but that came all tangled together in a knot.
3.0,"Fit okay but fabric felt cheap, so I returned it."
3.0,The hat itself is sort of cheap. For $7 I can’t complain!
3.0,"I loved these glasses, they fit amazingly and looked great on my face (heart-shaped face)... However I had them for less than a week and the screw came off on of the sides and broke. Less than a week!! :("
3.0,Just got my ring. Love the stone but the band was tarnished
3.0,these are a nice length and light weight.  Very comfortable.  I like the smooth elastic waist to wear shirt over it.
3.0,"NICE HAT , JUST MADE ON THE SMALL SIDE"
3.0,Held the earrings to tight making them uncomfortable.
3.0,"Ok. I usually read a fair amount of reviews before buying but didn't with this item, so this is on me. These are very pretty, solid earrings. Very classy looking but they are GREEN in color. Like the dark green in camouflage. If that is ok with you, buy away. Really are pretty earrings. However I needed black. These are NOT black. Really did try to make it work but ended up returning."
3.0,"A little snug and there's no give in the crotch, so there are already seams giving way from bending and squatting."
3.0,"Tends to run small, I bought it for myself, but ended up giving to my daughter.  She is like 2 sizes smaller then myself."
3.0,My son loves it! Its less then 18inches long. Its blue and white bwaitifully.<br /><br />Cons: it has a smell on it which i cant describe. And the clasps is kind of difficult to open it.
3.0,Cute!  Not a perfect fit. Slightly small. If I got one size bigger it would have been too big.
3.0,"Love the look, however, the balls are hard to crew on"
3.0,Shirt size is fine but I am disappointed in the quality of the emblem print on the shirt.  It's a bit blurry and is off center from the V neck so it looks a bit awkward.
3.0,"The fabric is polyester, and not the soft jersey-type fabric one expects when ""Sweatshirt"" is in the description. It's not lined at all, but I didn't expect that. I washed/dried it before wearing, and it didn't shrink, but it didn't soften up much either. It is cut narrower in the shoulders/chest/upper arms than an XXL normally is, but I have to roll up the sleeves. Also, the neckline is too high for my personal preference. This isn't the warm, soft and cozy full-length sweatshirt to keep me warm  that I'd hoped for."
3.0,These shoes where way smaller than the size scale. Couldn't even wear them ended up giving them to my niece.
3.0,They are comfortable and supporting.
3.0,"Cute shirt. I went by the size chart and it was still too large. Also, the picture shows it to be fitted. It was more boxy fitting on me. It is going back. Shame, I have to pay S&H to return it."
3.0,"We are always on the lookout for full elastic pants for my husband to wear as house pants. We really thought these would be perfect, but the material is a little odd. It is like a silky canvas or parachute material.<br /><br />Also, the elastic band is not very stretchy, so it’s important to get your size or size down.  They have two pockets in the front.  They are very loose and fit baggy.<br /><br />Very casual and lightweight.  There are no belt loops, so make sure you get the size that fits so they don’t fall down!"
3.0,Very cute but fell apart the second time I wore it and a tad to big
3.0,I lost the center stone after wearing it once.
3.0,The Key chain is cute.
3.0,They didn’t fit I wouldn’t recommend them they aren’t what I was expecting
3.0,Tight on neck like struggled to get in it then it ripped between the legs soon after
3.0,This legging is about 2 inches too short. It fits good but after a few months threading came out.
3.0,"Sizing is not at all as expected. I normally wear a 7/8, I am 5’8” tall, normal build, etc. I purchased a large, thinking it would fit comfortably, not tight or clingy being it should have been a 10/12 that I was ordering, a full size larger than I normally wear. When I put it on, the entire dress was extremely tight from the shoulder area, breast area, middle through hips. It looked more like a 3/4, rather than a 10/12. It looked awful to say the very least. The reason I gave this dress three stars is only for the softness of the fabric and the print. Had the dress actually fit me as it should have and then some, I think it would have been quite pretty. Im considering exchanging it for an xl or xxl, however I have never purchased a dress this size. Im returning the current dress and pondering the idea of a reorder."
3.0,straps are too big
3.0,"I absolutely love the Wallet but unfortunately the zippers get stuck all the time, cheap..."
3.0,"the silk feels cheap and is nowhere near as soft as the old waldorf play silks i have from when i was little, but like its definitely silk, and if i was getting this for a 3 year old im sure the kid wouldnt really care"
3.0,Material is not good to be on the beach. Thought it was cotton.
3.0,I love vintage but this was rather 'old lady' on my small frame.
3.0,"for some reason these were blurry, at the same strength I normally get my readers.  The frames were also tight, at the same size I get (I have a little measure thing, since I order Rx glasses online.)  Frames were nice and substantial feeling.  Return was easy and no hassle.  The lenses were not obnoxious amber, only slightly off from clear, which I would have liked if they hadn't been blurry from my normal strength."
3.0,The soccer ball keeps coming off so we had to super glue it to make it stay. Otherwise it's a cute keychain.
3.0,"I like it because it's knitted, but it looks nothing like the photos, I'm 5'10&#34; and 145lbs, and this fits like a bra. I should have known with the &#34;one size&#34;, sadly I was too excited and trusting of the pictures. I'm keeping it because I'm 1. tired of returning things and 2. It works for layering and winter cute outfits."
3.0,I liked the product at first. It was very helpful to cover my face BUT I only used for 6 days  and the adjustment at the side became defective and it came off. I returned the product.
3.0,"Unless your child has a skinny foot, these will give them blisters - the leather really needs to be worked by something other than their delicate feet since the back is rather stiff and the opening nearest the toes doesn't give much.  We've definitely gotten better primigis for our toddler."
3.0,"I generally wear the size I oredered, but these were a little snug."
3.0,This was too see through and the back didn’t work for me but I can see how some people might like it.
3.0,Which they had a way to adjust the tightness. Works great for sound but then my poor kids got a headache from having their heads squeezed.
3.0,To slim
3.0,"Good sunglasses looks great on me, the only reason 3 stars is because the nose piece hurts my nose."
3.0,Took awhile to get here but its nicely made
3.0,Fabric a bit cheep. Needs a clasp at the top . It slides off your shoulders constantly. Loved the color.
3.0,I like the shirt however it is just a little oversized
3.0,"It works fine, can tell its generic though. Color not great"
3.0,"I ordered these jeans in hopes they would be high waisted, but they are not quite. They did come up to my belly button but were not as flattering as I hoped. I am usually a size 12-14 and i ordered the extra large. I was able to pull them up but that created a muffin top. The band was a bit too tight. The rest of the jeans fit and looked great except for the waist. Definitly order up when ordering according to the size chart. If you are like me and have difficulty find good jeans or wanted to hide that mom pooch- these are not for you."
3.0,The material is kind of cheap and the masks are way too big for my face. I almost always have that problem and it’s rare I find a mask that will actually fit me. I now have to give these masks to my husband.
3.0,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M5KC6BL/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_52
3.0,The leotard portion was very odd perportionately. The arms were so long and narrow. The cloak/cape piece is nice and so is the belt etc. Ordered a Capezio leotard and problem solved.
3.0,"It was cute for an older person. Maybe 50 and older. I thought it would be simple and sexy like the pic, but it gave me older lady vibes."
3.0,"Cute top, way too small and I ordered the size I normally do.  However it is really cute so it went on my &#34;HOPE&#34; shelf.  Got here on time and seems to be good quality."
3.0,"I love the colors and design but the bands are too tight on my wrist. One of the bands left an imprint of the backside where the fit but is goes into it. They are not as water tight as the real thing and the colors fade after about a week of wear. If you don't workout at a high intensity or are just looking for a fashion piece, these are great. But for someone who is highly active I do not recommend this product."
3.0,It’s super cute. Was delivered very fast. It fits smaller than size. I don’t think it’ll survive a wash.
3.0,They were so pretty but the diamond  iratate my gum
3.0,"Nice heavey weight jacket, Great color Great quality. Sizes run big."
3.0,Nice bag but larger than I thought it would be.
3.0,It’s a bit small for men. I could see this being better for woman.
3.0,"very beautiful, but breaks easily"
3.0,Was not made in the USA as previous hats were. Graphic was not straight and smaller.
3.0,The fabric is pretty and the style is loose and flowy but overall the shirt is much shorter than I expected.
3.0,Came on time. Small graphics and bad print overall. Fit was as expected
3.0,"It is a flat card mask. It does look like the picture. I am not sure &#34;high quality&#34; is an apt description, it is just an inexpensive mask."
3.0,"I like the fake stone as it reminds me of the cairngorm of the Scots small knife. The faux patina I can live without though I find the fleur de lis decoration on the ring quite attractive.<br /><br />But it's just too big. The ring itself is as long as the finger bone where rings are normally worn. I like the construction but it's just too big. If you have big hands or long fingers, maybe it'd be a good fit for you, but it's just too big for me."
3.0,"Can't complain about it being smaller than actual size because the seller clearly says get a size bigger if you're fat, Lol! The design isn't all that great, took quite some time in the shipping process."
3.0,Would've gave 5-stars but they are actually really tight! If you have a large wrist I do not recommend!
3.0,Love the concept...but the ear muffin part comes out of my ears. It won't stay put
3.0,"They're cute but small. I'm a women's size 8 and after one wash, they're very little."
3.0,Cutr hard to talk
3.0,It was ok not my style and the dress is heavy
3.0,These look nice but they don’t hug the ears tightly creating a droopy effect. I wouldn’t buy again
3.0,"It's cute, yes. BUT it looks like something I could have made myself, still like it though."
3.0,"Want some bling for your dog?  Then this might be the right collar for you.  The shiny links are very pretty on my black lab.<br /><br />However, this collar is a choke collar and I would never use it for anything other than decoration as choke collars are known for causing damage to a dog’s trachea! I’m glad that the description for the collar also notes that it should only be used for decoration.<br /><br /> But, when used for decoration, this collar is pretty and it’s also extremely lightweight so it’s easy to wear and didn't bother my lab at all.  It’s like jewelry for dogs. 😂"
3.0,I rhough that the larger bag would be much bigger
3.0,"The pros: they are very lightweight, the lenses seem to filter light well and I can tell the polarization is there. They work well for me when I'm not running and I think they'd be great for someone with a larger head.<br /><br />The cons: They're built for someone with a large head - probably men, generally speaking (I'm an adult female, 5'6, average-to-smaller head).  The earpieces go far beyond my ears, so that they more difficult to slide and keep up onto my head and look funny when sitting on my cap.  I bought these primarily for running, but they slide down my nose consistently once I began to sweat and it is extremely annoying.  Looking to replace them already."
3.0,I've bought a few pairs of these compression socks. But for some reason this one had a hole on the inside of the foot seam right out of the Box. I had to send it back. Must have been a problem at the factory with this 1.
3.0,Very hard to put on by yourself
3.0,Everything was good except the hat was crushed I’m hoping to fix it by steaming the hat I hope it works
3.0,"I like the material, coloring and flag image. All that is good and as pictured in the add. It’s also warming. however as a mask, it continuously slips under your nose. If it was intended to serve as a mask it needs ear loops."
3.0,"They're okay for the price. A lot of these were bent out of shape and hard to put in my tragus piercing.  The tops are small and clear, I already lost 2 trying them on. I can't see how I could cut these down since the top pin is so long and the hollowed out end doesn't have much length to shorten.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Clear and hard to see/find<br />- Top insert is long enough to hold its place<br />-Flexible to an extent ( I wouldn't force too much on it)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Can't cut down any further than maybe 1-2mm<br />-Would not get this for tragus piercings (unless your tragus is as thick as your lip then maybe you can pull it off)<br />- The hollow end is rather flimsy and it's like trying to feed a toddler food that they hate (maybe I'll try the airplane method)"
3.0,Like the color of the belt is significantly lighter than the leather pictured.
3.0,"This ""straw sun hat"" is essentially plastic in feel, and almost as solid as a plastic hard hat.  I'm afraid to try to shape it in the least, and not because I might tear the straw--which I assume is in it somewhere--but that I might literally BREAK it by creasing it.  Worse is the third display showing the ""Perfect Fit system"" which might work on some hats just fine, but NOT ON THIS ONE which has no traditional sweatband but instead an elastic band (see attached), so there's literally no 'hat band' under which you can tuck folded paper, a size reducer, or a sweat liner.<br /><br />To the vendor: For $67 and marketing this in differing sizes, put in a regular band."
3.0,I took off the small flimsy chain link band and replaced it with another. This is just my preference. I LOVE the Dragon!
3.0,"I thought this dress was going to be heavier like the black part to be thicker but its not, its thin as in a shirt thin and when I took it out the bag a button rolled on the floor and I was okay with that because you can easily sew a button back on, but it didn't just pop off the button itself if actually broken.  The dress looks as it appears just when you pay over $20 to $ 25 for a dress off amazon you expect better material, because the style is cute I can live with the thin fabric, now what about the button as it didn't come with a spare?????? I gave it 3 stars because it's really cute and less than five because I don't know what to do about the button and the thin fabric."
3.0,"I got a size small and it was a bit big. Fit perfect around the waist and wasn't too tight either, but below, it was baggy and uncomfortable especially around the crotch (When I sat down, it looked like I had a guy's membrane). It also came slightly above my ankles which I was O-kay with but I like the pant legs to go below the ankles. I ordered an Xsmall to see if it would fit better. It did. It fit perfectly around my legs, nice and tight the way it was supposed to be...but then I couldn't even zipper it up unless I removed a few ribs. -__- I was saddened. In the end, I kept the size small and hope that one day after a few hundred washes, it will shrink a bit.<br /><br />In case anyone is wondering or might find it helpful, I'm 5.4 and weigh 120lbs. Slender built."
3.0,Small in Size. Expected them to be more thick.
3.0,"It’s cute and very dainty. My complaint is that the front side can never stay on the front. Like while I wear it, the rock bit isn’t balanced and it always flips over so the back faces the front.<br /><br />This could be fixed with some fashion tape I’m sure, but I’m not going to tape a necklace to my skin just because."
3.0,"My boy loved it. He told me this is very soft and comfortable shoes, great for swimming poor since he often got skin scratched from the bottom of the poor.but smell is terrible."
3.0,"Nice dress, but the material is too shiny like spandex. The stitching around the edges make the dress look cheap."
3.0,It was cute. I bought for my daughter and I too match. My dress fit snugger than I would have liked. My daughter didn't like the waist. There was also a flaw in that a small piece of fabric from the bottom was caught in the stitching of the waist section.
3.0,Nice but to small...hurt ears
3.0,"Pros: color is true to photo.  Lightweight, good for layering. Length overall is good.<br /><br />Cons: not very soft.  Would have liked full length sleeves."
3.0,"The pattern is right but the color is not vibrant like the original. Also, buy it a size bigger than you normally wear."
3.0,When I first got the package there was a weird residue in the plastic bag with the hoops. I was skeptic. I will wait before I put the hoops in my gauges. They do have a bit of weight too.
3.0,I brought for my son girlfriend and we I received it it was broke.<br />I glued th stem back on with glue.
3.0,These run a little small. But if you like tight compression then order your usual size
3.0,"It's nice, but too small.  Not made for big wrists."
3.0,"On the light grey pants the front pockets show through, and it requires seamless panties. However it is very soft. The charcoal one fits looser and is ideal for ]wearing outside. The charcoal fits great  on my petite frame and is super soft."
3.0,Doesnt have the same sheen as the picture. The red is also extremely bright and stands out against the black whereas in the picture it sort of blends.
3.0,it was nice but wrinkled
3.0,the material looks nice but on my legs they aren't as long add they appear in the picture. I guess I got fat calves.
3.0,"Top one too short, bottom one too long.  If you have A big neck, it won't fit at all. Love the bead in the bottom one though.  I have some very small pliers, am gonna try to fix it."
3.0,And long
3.0,The stitching came apart after the first wear. Otherwise very cute play clothes
3.0,"Way to long, bought it to wear around the house."
3.0,"The straps are too short. I wish that they were a little longer. Otherwise, the bra itself is really beautiful, and well made. I am so sad that I cannot wear this."
3.0,First photo is through these glasses and the second photo is through an old cardboard pair I had laying around.  Big difference (photo makes both look brighter than they are).
3.0,Changes colour. Loved it before it changed. Suppose you get what you pay for.
3.0,The gloves didn't keep my hands warm enough.  It did allow me to use the touchscreen on my phone perfectly well.
3.0,"Turtleneck - This model must be very short.  I ordered a medium and the sweater just touched my hips.  Since it's very loose and should be dress-like as shown, it looked like a 3X sweater on.  The turtle neck is absolutely bizarre.  It folds over and then has a lot of extra fabric that looks like a bandanna underneath and wasn't at all pretty.<br /><br />There are 2 sweaters linked to this review.  The sweater without the turtleneck is exactly as pictured.  I ordered the grey and loved it so much I ordered the black and brown as well.  It's very heavy durable yarn."
3.0,"I give the compression socks a 5-star for their great socks but I give Amazon a 1-star for their service which averages out to the 3-star. I already have a pair of these socks and ordered another 4 pairs because of their comfort and how well they work. However, Amazon sent me only 2 pairs of these socks which are made mostly from cotton. They sent me 2 other pairs of stockings which are completely different and made from mostly nylon. I will not use those, but Amazon says I cannot return or replace those 2 pairs which I have no need for. Needless to say, I am very pleased with the Wanderlust socks, but very disappointed with Amazon’s service!"
3.0,"It was a cute costume, although very short and itchy"
3.0,Very small. Not meant for an adult female unless she is petite in stature.
3.0,Not what i expected- maybe my size was off. Just ok not bad not excellent
3.0,"I was replacing my Lynco Slide size 13 which I love with this shoe, the fit was more like a size 14.  Not sure if these shoes are copies or the shoe size was miss labeled.  The quality of the shoe was nice it was just too large."
3.0,Get a size larger than you wear
3.0,"I bought size XXL, and even that was a little too small.  It doesn't even fit like a large.  Other that that, the cut and the material was ok."
3.0,"Beautiful pair of glasses but the case does not protect them at all.<br /><br />I was actually wearing them and when I took them off, the leg snapped and broke. The most random way of breaking. Also, this is the second pair of Quay I’ve had and they both got ruined. These broke and the previous pair the lens started to peel."
3.0,I wish the hat had a size adjustment.  Otherwise the hat is beautiful and well made.
3.0,Good but run a little small
3.0,Lens cover cheap plastic
3.0,"Good quality one piece bathing suit. Very nice, but the torso is very short. If you don't have a large chest or if you are tall and have a long torso, this will not fit correctly. Fit well as far as plus size is concerned, but torso needs to be a few inches longer."
3.0,"They are great, just really too big 😳😫"
3.0,Good quality but somewhat too large.
3.0,It's a lay that mask can lights at dark. I expected better one.
3.0,"Very good finish but I found it quite small (only about 15 inch wide), somewhat like a woman's purse so I returned it."
3.0,I got these for my 8yo DD and she loved the design and color. She really like the feel at first and the lining was awesome and comfortable but she says they are not too water proof; after playing the the snow for about an hour or so her feet would be wet and cold so she would have to come inside.
3.0,If you are going to get this set make sure you get two sizes up. These run small and they shrink after washing. The material is cool and thin. It is soft. Good for spring/summer.
3.0,The picture makes it look sparkly and fun but it’s matte and boring.
3.0,"It's cute and will serve it's purpose but the material is cheap looking and dull.  Just as shown, it's not very big so it won't hold very much."
3.0,"This is definitely more costume jewelry than everyday wear. It's not too bad by any means, but if you're looking for chokers made for casual everyday wear I wouldn't recommend this or amazon in general."
3.0,"A bit small, these are made for perky girl, with not so much boob!!!&"
3.0,"The quality is not what I expected.  The fabric is cotton and not worth what I paid.  I am sending it back along with the others two just like it in a different print.  These three skirts are definitely not worth $150. Pretty print, that's about it."
3.0,"It’s an ok top, feels cheap, probably should be half the cost, but overall fit is good"
3.0,Size up!!!! Mine were insanely smaller than they should be.
3.0,It was a really adorable dress! I just had some issues with it being way to tight around my chest and mine yoj I am normally a large and I order an xl to compensate with the size of the top and my chest was popped out. It was wayyy to long as well
3.0,Thought when I bought these that they were thermal gloves...they are not.  My fingertips still get very cold when I am out walking for about an 1hr at a time.  Better if use with a inner thin glove  like thin disposable gloves.  Dissappointed in these gloves.
3.0,i liked it but it kinda of crock and not straight.
3.0,Nice looking PJ's. Fit way to small. I am a 36 waist and they are snug. So far worth what I paid.
3.0,Nice lounge dress. Thin fabric that wrinkles easily.
3.0,"Size is exact as the conversion they show in the product description. Material is nice but needs a better back support in the heel, because the upper material is somehow elastic. The traction when you need up or down heal, pulls feet out on the bottom surface and strees the stability and grip."
3.0,"It is too transparent, and fita small. I returned."
3.0,When I received the item one of the earring were detached from the post
3.0,Beware of sizing!!!! My daughter is a true 10-12 and the product we received was not even close to a 10-12. More like a 6-6x. Very disappointing!
3.0,The black writing came off
3.0,Um the shoulder strap without ruffle is way too long. We have to tie it in a knot
3.0,"The skirt is fine, but the top is very cropped, and the bottom part of your bra shows."
3.0,somewhat larger than i expected a medium to be.
3.0,"It was great having a lot of colors to choose from. Unfortunately, the construction isn't the greatest, and the glue didn't hold the flower onto the pin very well. I had to reinforce it."
3.0,they seemed a little cheap on the metal from others I have bought.
3.0,It has a nice neckline but it runs small.
3.0,Kind of snug
3.0,This product was ill fitting and fit small for me. I recently bought three other bras on Amazon (Playtex and Bali) and had no problem with their DDD cups.<br />  I typically wear a 36 and this 36 was pretty tight. The DDD didn’t fit correctly and created and almost created a uniiboob. The center boning didn’t lay flat so it just stuck out in the middle away from my skin.<br />Maybe it will work for a woman with a differently shaped boob.
3.0,"Good for price. Material is only lining material. Tears easily and ears are easily breakable.  However, good for one night of trick or treating, especially with the price."
3.0,"My son likes these, but I bought a larger size than usual and they are fitting perfectly instead of giving him room to grow."
3.0,They definitely run slightly larger than expected but still works.
3.0,Great quality but runs small. I needed it for Halloween so I was able to cut it open and Frankenstein it for my intended purposes. I usually wear a size 1 or 2 and thought size 4-6 would be ideal. I was wrong. This is not US sizing...more like Australian sizing.
3.0,I had bought this a week ago and made a review on the packaging which was very broken and opened and I came to delete it and comment on the wear of it and it was removed for me apparently. I'm only giving it 2 stars on packaging and 3 stars on the wear because it was for a Fashion show which I had to change multiple times and i was sweating so it would come off. Multiple times. It fits but not for long wear or a lot of activity. Other than that it fits. Haven't worn it since I don't even know if it will work anymore. But if it's for one day and your not planning on being active just chilling then go ahead it's great and looks nice.
3.0,"Very cute but they don't have a long life. My toes made holes through one pair after the first wear. Also, another pain began to fray."
3.0,The product was a different material than expected. the shirt was a bit large and did not fit that well
3.0,Pretty earrings but smaller than expected
3.0,"The skirt is very nice but it is not a midi. I am only 5’6” and it came just below my knees. I wanted it a little longer. I’ll keep the skirt because I like it,"
3.0,"Pretty color and design, but broken and coming apart in three places. Having to spend time and money to make it wearable."
3.0,See comment in the headline above.
3.0,"Cute shoes, but they are very peach in color...not rose or pink as advertised. They will not match any of my daughter’s clothing"
3.0,"I bought this too as a cute way to cover my crotch while wearing leggings... it will do that... but it fits like a very basic T-shirt that is on the thinner side. The picture makes it seem like it would be flowy, it is not and I don't think buying a bigger size would supply that style either.<br /><br />It will still serve my purpose, it is like a slightly longer casual T-shirt. Still cute and will be worn plenty :)<br /><br />For reference I have a very average body type with a bit of a belly. I am 5'7"" and weigh about 180"
3.0,"too big for my luggage it hinders the rolling of wheels because it stuck up between.this is stretchy so make sure you get the right size.very stretchy that maybe medium will fit the 28"".and also the hole doesn't shoot in the handle.i just used it once back and forth now it's showing some little tear."
3.0,I have a 5”9 height and im Skinny athletic build. I purchased a medium but the shorts go above my knee and the fabric is weak so a hole tore the same week. It has a nice look though but wouldnt recommend.
3.0,"I wear a women's size 9 in shoes and these socks fit me fine. The material is soft but extremely thin to the point of being see through.<br />There's nothing special about them, they're your average pair of ankle socks. I wouldn't purchase these for fear they'd rip too easily."
3.0,Turned green within days lol what the ....
3.0,I ordered these to make necklaces for my coworkers and lucky enough 6 out of the 10 I can use. Quality control needs to be better and being that so many came with missing stones and one with missing enamel I am not sure they will hold up over time. I am sad because they are so pretty.
3.0,It’s too small and light it seems will break in any minute. I returned. It’s beautiful but didn’t work for me.
3.0,"I have always received this item quickly and item has been as described. However, I have had many of the hair ties break during the first or second use."
3.0,I  bought the belt in December and by May of the next year it’s buckle had broken off. For the price it lasted 6 months. I figure $1.15 per month for a belt isn’t that bad of a deal.
3.0,needs to be made out of cotton atleast 90%
3.0,Love the top. Hate how the bottom puffs out in front.
3.0,"Band is ok, but way too long even after removing all 6 links. Have to return it."
3.0,The belt fell apart as soon as I took the costume out of the packaging but thank goodness I keep fabric glue around. The leotard fits about a small down but is perfect if you want that skin tight fit. Overall the quality isn’t great but is a good costume for a one time event
3.0,"Good product, well made, good material. However, the arm holes are small. If you have a well endowed bust it won't fit."
3.0,"Leather quality looks so-so - - average or below average. Buckle is heavy for my liking. Ratchet mechanism works OK. If leather holds up over a year without peeling, etc., it may be worth it."
3.0,"fit ok - but poor quality - sooner or later a lens will fall out from past experience.  And, definitely not dark enough - I need v.dark glasses for driving - not being able to read the dashboard dials clearly is a price I expect to pay for comfortable driving."
3.0,poor quality and not as cute
3.0,Waist to small for a large and way to long.  Sad because it is very pretty and would of looked great.  Going back.
3.0,"I like the fir of these joggers. The fabric is heavy enough but it pills. I will buy another color. I got the matching sweatshirt in an L, but it runs small."
3.0,"Much smaller than I thought they would be, hard to screw on!"
3.0,I wish there was more of a percentage of cotton in these socks. My feet tend to sweat when I wear them. They do hold up good after washing them.
3.0,low quality item.<br />disapointed
3.0,"Cool, and funky, but seriously too big.  I look like a bug!"
3.0,"Too short. Otherwise fine, but that's a big deal for me"
3.0,"Just ok, ordered these keepsakes for our children and grands after my husband passed away.  The chain was broken on one of them, emailed the company and never heard from them.  The canister with ashes fell out of one of them and luckily found it while house cleaning"
3.0,"I’m in between a M and a L, but always order a Large when I order clothes from Amazon. This shirt fit everywhere but was so short. Not like crop too short, like normal length and in between where a crop top should fall. I wore it with high waisted dress pants, so it worked out.  But it came to just below my belly button, and if I raised my arms at all I had to tuck back in."
3.0,Looks and feels amazing but irritates my legs. Also the fabric rolls up easily and the pouch area doesn't keep things in place. If you need pouched underwear then I recommend briefs.
3.0,"It's pretty and looks nice, but if wearing a wet bathing suit under it, the parts of the suit that touch the material, especially the chest area, show up as &#34;spots&#34; on the material until it dries."
3.0,"This shirt looked adorable on the pics but when I put it on I felt like the ruffle at the shoulder stood WAY up/out and was not flattering like the picture.  Material was fine, color was great.  Just not for me."
3.0,There okay nice colors like for night club ..
3.0,The image is a bit crooked and material doesn't stretch even..
3.0,"The gloves overall are fine but within two days of use the zipper on the left glove broke and I can't fix it for the life of me. They also have obnoxious big red I don't really know what to call them, patches? stitched on the back of them. Kind of difficult to use your phone with compared to my wool phone friendly gloves but are better protection against the cold. For the price they're pretty solid, just wish the zipper didn't break because now my left hand is fairly cold."
3.0,"Perfect in every way BUT If only it had 4"" inches more in girth; I would buy several. 5'4"" 140 Size large and I can't fold it between my legs. BOOHOO."
3.0,I actually cut off the sleeves of this to make it cooler.  I wore a black suit underneath so it looked kind of dirty.  I would wear white or very light colored to complement the cover up.
3.0,"With a title that says &#34;... Water Absorbant ... Bathrobe&#34; - I presumed that the robe would absorb water :D. Unfortunately, that is not the case =[. I typically put this on right as I get out of the shower and leave it on for 5-10 minutes while I dry my hair. When I take the robe off, I still have water all over me and have to use another towel to dry off.<br /><br />With that being said, the robe is comfortable (albeit keeping me a bit hot) and is something I'd enjoy wearing around the house when I'm not just getting out of the shower.<br /><br />I'll be purchasing a different bathrobe that can dry me off but will be keeping this one to wear on some lazy weekends."
3.0,very warm but very hard to get on and off...should have gotten an X Large but they did not have one at time...I typically take a Large ...discovered thru a review that Montane tends to run a size smaller than American sizing.
3.0,"The fabric is not as black as pictured. In the light, it has a blueish gleam which is not what I wanted. Was expecting more of a PVC-like fabric based on the photos and description but this is more like a shiny spandex material than PU leather."
3.0,"Cute but the fabric is rough and doesn't feel that great against your skin. The skirt print is really cute and why I decided to keep it. If I only wear it for one or two seasons, I'll be happy."
3.0,These glasses looked good and preformed well for the first week but on the second week of use they broke in half. I don't think they were defective but you will need to be careful not to stretch them when taking them off. the material used breaks easy.
3.0,These pinch your arm hairs so wearing them is annoying. But they are very cute!
3.0,"Runs big, especially through the chest.  Top is somewhat shapeless  comfortable fabric."
3.0,"I bought this because I liked the pattern. However, if you're not careful with washing in gentle cycle and line-drying, then this material is easy to pill and look cheap over time. It would only last a few months before you end up using it as a ""rag"" shirt for when you're cleaning house or painting a room. Cute style, but it won't last long."
3.0,"Loved the design, but it's near impossible keep this in beard without them falling out. They should also include something to assist in pulling hair through."
3.0,Good quality for the money. Beware it runs small.
3.0,"These slipped off my daughter’s heels despite being the right size everywhere else. I ended up sewing straps of elastic over the tops and that solved the problem. But for the price, they should stay on without alterations."
3.0,Love the ring but to big
3.0,The fit is just kind of strange.. it was still too big/loose on top for me.  If you don't have much on top this might work okay.
3.0,Too short and cheap fabric
3.0,"I have hip dips for one so the high cut on the leg is not flattering on me at all. It’s also hard to get on because it runs small and cuts into my cheeks. I ordered a medium but believe a large would have been better. Then again, I’m not sure the large would have fit my back because the medium is tight enough on my shoulders to stay in place when doing minimal activity.<br /><br />I don’t think this swimsuit is for doing a lot of movement. It’s very eye catching and cute but I’m afraid the shoulder would slip off and you know the rest. Unfortunately, I won’t be able to wear but it may be appealing on others. I do recommend being cautious when picking your size to order."
3.0,The accessories make the outfit look a lot better than it is when it comes. Hot confining not as cute as I expected.
3.0,Advertised as a 3 pack but there were only 2 in the package.
3.0,some didnt work:( and coused me not to have enough for kids at party very disappointing
3.0,Well I ordered a medium and it was originally for me but it turned out it was to big. So I just gave it to my brother as a gift. wished it would have fit me though. I recommend you ordering a size smaller than what your actual size is.
3.0,This boa is way too skinny...
3.0,"This was a really sweet dress; well made and lovely fabric... BUT I had to return it because it was WAY too small.  I estimate the ""Large"" size to be about a size 10.  Otherwise, it was perfect.  Wish I could've worn it!"
3.0,"This dress was a bust. I’m 5 ft tall and got the small and it hits me below the knee, making it look more like a night gown instead of a cute summer dress.<br />There isn’t bunching in the front like pictured either, and the material is stiff. I’ll either have to have it hemmed and altered, or return. Think I’m sending this one back."
3.0,Makes my eyes hurt after using for over half hour. My eyes run water and get red at times.
3.0,Ordered the size they said that was compatible  to US sizing . Even went one size bigger just to be safe and it was still too small.
3.0,"I bought these socks for my grandfather who is suffering from a lot of swelling in his feet. These xxl socks are barely adequate. There isn't enough stretch to get them on easily, and then they had a tendency to slide down.<br /><br />Edit: The seller was highly interested in customer service and replaced the xxl with xxxl. This size was marginally better.<br /><br />The socks are on par with products found at a hospital.  They do not suit my need (regaining mobility after hip surgery) but may work for someone else."
3.0,Beautiful dressed but fit small! Was a little disappointed!
3.0,Nice buy for the price. Costume jewelry is fun. This is cool and I wear the thumb rings all the time. The mid rings don't fit we'll for me.
3.0,"It's a great coat. A little on the cheap side, but perfect for my Nymphadora Tonks costume.<br />However, I sent it back because it fits more like a large. I ordered a 2 x because it said it tends to run small, but two sizes to small? No thanks.<br />I wish I could have kept it..."
3.0,It's kinda of a bad fit if you have a bigger chest. It doesn't come to my knees and the top part barely covers my chest. If it wasnt such a hassle I'd probably return it.
3.0,"If you're putting resin in these you are only looking at 20 workable pieces.  Several weren't closed all the way, some bent and some squashed beyond recognition."
3.0,"Don't let Amazon's description fool you - &#34;Need a comfortable work boot? Try the Boss or the Protector, which features steel toe protection.&#34; The Protector is the only one with steel toe. The Boss does not. I was expecting steel toe."
3.0,"I ordered this dress in both the Sunflower and Black/White Polka Dot.  The Sunflower dress is all cotton, which I prefer.  The material is a little thin so I wear a half slip under it.  It will be great for the hot August days.<br />The Black/White Polka dot is more of a polyester fabric.  It is heavier material than the Sunflower dress, so there is no need to wear a slip under it should you not want to wear a slip, I am also under sure of how comfortable it will be on the hot August days because polyester is not breathable material.<br />But in saying these things, I have worn both dress and gotten compliments every time I wear them.  The sunflower dress I wore with summer sandals while meeting a friend for lunch.  I was stopped while being seated and asked where I got the dress from because its just so cute!<br />The Black/White Polka Dot I wore while Bridesmaid Dress shopping.  I dressed it up with  dressier strappy sandals.  Two different woman came up to me and said ""What a cute dress"".<br />I would recommend these dresses to those who are looking for a good summer dress that is comfortable."
3.0,Funky
3.0,Both items are a lot darker than expected. The ivory is more of a tan and the red is a dark maroon. Great quality just not what I was expecting.
3.0,Love the pattern and feel of fabric.  However it's not as long in photo.  Hits at belt length.
3.0,"I’ve been looking at this shirt for a while and finally took the plunge and got it.... this is a WOMEN’S CUT shirt! From the pictures, it looks like a standard t-shirt (men’s/unisex) which is what I ordered according to since there is absolutely no product description. I have other barstool tees that by pictures look just like this one. Don’t get fooled. It is extremely tight fitting with short, capped sleeves.<br />I would order up at least one size from what you normally order. (When  I received this shirt, I had to double check that I didn’t order the toddler size shirt.)<br /><br />***EDIT*** I ordered again and made it  a 2X in this to account for the women’s cut (and because I have a large upper body). No luck. They sent me a MEN’S CUT shirt this time. So apparently it is a craps shoot as to what type of shirt you’re going to get. 🤷🏼‍♀️"
3.0,"I order an 2x but it doesn't even fix, so I gave it away."
3.0,"Material seems cheaply made, very flimsy with no weight."
3.0,Very synthetic feel. The styling is very odd. There is some sort gathering around the waist on the right that makes an odd diagonal wrinkle across to the left. Very odd and affects the fit as it isn’t balanced. Odd look and with material that is very fake.
3.0,"It's ok for the price, but not what I expected."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:60b0dedefcf29a56e0e546558b0b4197]] Seem was ripped otherwise great
3.0,"Slippers themselves are ok, but order a size bigger than you wear.  I wear 7.5, so I ordered 7.5-8.5 and they’re too small.  Colors and design are nice"
3.0,Product is very large not what is shown
3.0,The dress is pretty but it does not fit right. The chest area is too loose. Had to return
3.0,The first pair I ordered were missing a fastening button at the top. I sent them back and reordered. They fit comfortably but are a bit snug around my stomach. Over all (pun intended) I am happy with this purchase. I will likely be ordering in another color as well.
3.0,Tight around the chest area
3.0,The skirt is very thick skirt doesn't flow like maxi skirt...Colors are great ....Not True to Size
3.0,They are okay. Once I style them I’m sure they’ll look better but the hooks on the side do not stay in place when you tighten the pants. I had to tie the strings so the pants stay tightened.
3.0,"Glad I got this on sale. The buttons are not real, the fabric is thin and wrinkles easily. I am a L/Xl and ordered xl. It was far too large. Fortunately it fit a friend perfectly who was 2xl."
3.0,"I WAS HOPING THIS WAS TURQUOISE.  IT'S NOT.  IT IS PLASTIC.  STILL LOOKS NICE.  IT IS EASY TO ADJUST THE LINKS TO MAKE SMALLER.  THE WATCH FACE IS QUITE LOVELY.  NOT SURE WHAT THAT IS EITHER.  PROBABLY PLASTIC TOO. IF YOU DON'T MIND THAT IS NOT REAL TURQUOISE, THEN YOU'LL BE HAPPY WITH YOUR PURCHASE.  I WAS JUST TOO LAZY TO SEND BACK."
3.0,2xl is more like a large and it cost $18 to return
3.0,"I love the way my tote looks, but on the picture it showed that on the bottom of the purse, there were gold footings, but when I received the purse there were none? Weird. But other than that it was not a bad purchase, I just wish that if the seller is going to advertise the purse looking a certain way, that the customer gets what’s advertised, because clearly that is the reason why the customer purchased that particular item for. Some of these seller have got to do better!"
3.0,Bright red in color. Not a rich red. This is a small shorter in length scarf. It is very soft and I would be very cute with a blazer.
3.0,Love the pattern and color of the suit but the breast part is very stiff and has a lot of non-removable padding
3.0,Pretty but way bigger than expected.
3.0,"It's a beautiful wallet but right after I put my ID and cards in, the wallet lining by the cards ripped. Now my ID keeps trying to fall out. Other than that it's a good wallet."
3.0,Not exactly what I expected. The label (poor quality) was actually purple instead of blue
3.0,Hat was too small for any adults.  We couldn't use them.
3.0,My daughter was so excited to received these slippers for Christmas. The quality is what you would expect from this type of house shoe. The run exceptionally small and tight.
3.0,"Love the colors and fit, just wished it had pockets! I've never had a hoodie without the front pocket or side ones. The material is also thin and  not soft."
3.0,"Cute dress, but it was above my knees and did not suit my needs."
3.0,Can't say it does much but the kids sure loved it. Other than laying an egg it's just squishy & fun to squeeze. Was hard to find & it is unique. Thanks Amazon!
3.0,"Ok, but not quite as plush I had hoped. Seems cheep and the kind of material that catches on things."
3.0,The string ripped when my husband tried to put it on his big man head . Lol but we fixed it with super glue .
3.0,The chain is twisted 😒
3.0,"Most of my weight comes from my genetically given 36JJ (UK)/ 36 N (US) breast (31 waist), so to say my proportions are off is an understatement.  I was skeptical it would accurately ‘measure’ me from a picture and a few measurements, and I was right.<br /><br />The shirt fits about as well as any other shirt, and it’s definitely not worth spending extra money on getting one custom. It does not look or feel custom made for me, it feels like some one/ thing picked it out of extended variations of sizes, and then stuck a custom tag on it.  You can’t really see it well from my picture, but the fabric really pulls around my chest and bags around the waist and hips. I do like the high wrist fit, but it’s an incorrect fit from a tailoring perspective, a little less than an inch off.<br /><br />HOWEVER my initial impression of the quality is still really good, and this quality of fabric (for the price) is becoming my expectation for amazon. The quality really saves how bungled the fit is"
3.0,The two rhinestones were different shades of blue. Very fast shipping and it was well packaged. Would recommend buying it in clear stones to avoid the mis-match of colors.
3.0,"I bought this item for my wife and she was so excited! When she wore it the same way as the model in the picture, the dress was significantly shorter; her height is 5'9&#34;, and we assume the model must be shorter than 5'. Perhaps some detailed notes will help customers to construct better expectations when shopping.<br />My wife was satisfied, only after she added a nice belt, her beach hat and sandals."
3.0,"My hands and wrists are small but the gloves are hard to get on, no give because they are leather. The fingers are too long. I got medium but small would be worse. I got navy and it's very dark, almost black. I do like the looks of the gloves, very dressy."
3.0,"Way too long for me. I have to roll the top up so it’s not dragging on the ground and I don’t step on it. Which makes it look funny at the top. Gave away to charity. Otherwise, cute. (I’m 5’4)"
3.0,"I would say the bottoms are a little small for some and the straps on the top are a little loose for me but it’s still good, I would say the bottoms are extremely cute and not to small at all if your looking for a cheeky suit! For the top, the little straps that lay on your chest for looks are not tight so if you don’t have a big chest they might flap around a bit."
3.0,Looks good but very cheaply made or so i think!
3.0,"Lightweight mini dress. Great as a summer piece that can be used to transition summer to fall, paired with jeggings, tights or yoga pants. Comfy to wear. Easy to wash (I shake out & hang dry all my dresses) and wear. I could even see paired/layered with a long sleeve tee or thermal."
3.0,"Nice material, put together well"
3.0,I wear my shorts with a water proof belt so I like the to sit low. They would be perfect if the were 2 inch’s longer to sit below the knee cap.
3.0,"BEAUTIFUL dress just way too big! It swallows my 8 yo and I had to get it altered (spending an extra $20) Wide in arms and waste area. If I had gotten a smaller size I bet it would still be too big (wide) and then just become too short .  It's not white white like the picture, it's almost like a very light ivory, otherwise very pretty dress ."
3.0,Really nice but just small. Im normally a large but nned to return for a extra large.
3.0,"I have a number of tee shirts from Joe's shop and all of them with the Koloa surf company logo. All them, until this order, fit great as a large and are of high quality. I've been very pleased with every other order. However, on this order the company sent me what appeared to be a used tee shirt that arrived with the tag cut off and a stain on the lower front part of the tee. Also, the tee is marked Large, but it is clearly at least a 1X - it's massive and unwearable.<br /><br />*I originally marked this order with one star, but am upgrading the review to three stars to reflect the customer service I received after filing an issue with this order. While the shirt was not what I had ordered, I have loved all of the other shirts I have received through Joe's USA and their customer service person offered a prompt refund and additional clarification about their communication with me. I will remain a loyal customer of this company and understand that, from time to time, an order does not work out as intended. I would highly recommend ordering from this company - prompt service, excellent customer service, and generally speaking, great tee shirts (I have reviewed other shirts received with 5 stars)."
3.0,They were cute and look just like the picture.  Sadly 2 months of use and they are falling apart.<br /><br />They did fit true to size and we like how they lit up.
3.0,"The charm is difficult to slide, not like all of my others which were easy to connect to my bracelet."
3.0,Had to return. Fits like a tent.
3.0,"These earrings are spectacularly made and polished brilliantly.  My only problem is that they are HUGE! This absolutely doesn't mean that I don't like them...but I was wanting a cute pair of turquoise earrings to wear every day and these are just a bit gaudy for me.  I will wear them every now and then, but definitely not as often as I wanted to. Very disappointed at the size, but the craftsmanship is absolutely stunning!"
3.0,Pretty jewelry but gets rusty fast and smells.
3.0,I ordered this scarf because of the colors and pattern of the print.  Unfortunately the print is only on one side of the material
3.0,I use these gloves as a member of the American Legion Honor Guard at funerals. Because they have no elastic they have a tendency to bunch around the wrist. Not a good look. Had it not been for that they could have been a 5 star. Elastic was shown in the pix I ordered from.
3.0,Felt a bit too flimsy.
3.0,"There’s one fatal flaw for my case which is that it just doesn’t have the time showing all of the time.<br />ATTENTION  manufactures or whomever,<br /> if you have a watch just like this that shows the time and you don’t have to touch on it to make it show the time, that would be perfect. but this one makes it confusing for my mom because she doesn’t know what the hell is on her wrist so she doesn’t wear it.<br />I know it says touch to show the time, but that’s kind of lame. why don’t you just make it show the time all the time? it’s not like it’s using the battery a lot like it’s an 🍎 watch Apple or a real smart watch or some thing.<br /><br /> I can tell you though that the first day she had it on people thought she actually was wearing an Apple Watch (they were worried oh no who’s gonna charge that every night and I said no no no need to worry it’s just a cheap normal watch and the director of the old folks home actually said send me a link I want to get that for my son and I did I don’t know if she did though) so this is definitely what they’re going for.<br /> it is simple, but I felt a little stupid when I was trying to set the time and the date, and all you have to do is hold your finger on there a little longer than normal…<br /> so also that is not really the greatest user interface because I feel like my mom, because it doesn’t have anything displayed, is going to hold her finger on it and mess up the time like all the time …but unfortunately she hasn’t even used to it enough for that to be a problem so I guess I’m gonna give it three stars"
3.0,"I love the concept, but the bottom of the top fits me at an odd place, not quite covering the crotch area. It does cover, but i have to keep pulling it down so i haven't actually worn it out yet."
3.0,"PICTURE IS OF MY 12 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WEARING THIS IN AN XL!! (FOR SIZE REFERENCE SHE IS A SIZE 14/16 IN KIDS, NOT A WOMENS SIZE XL)<br /><br />REVIEW:<br /><br />Bought this for myself in an XL and that is what I normally wear so I was disappointed when I had to give to my 12 year old and it fit her perfectly.  If you're a size XL don't buy because it won't fit you. For reference, I'm 175 lbs and 5'3&#34; and it didn't fit.<br /><br />But the lettering never came off and I've washed it twice already, just turn the shirt inside out when putting in dryer."
3.0,"Love the umbrella,  to bad the lights never worked.😕"
3.0,I bought these to use under running tights. I am a US women's size 10 with an athletic/curvy build. They gripped okay and basically stayed put. I am not overly concerned about panty lines but IMO there wasn't much. I think it would be nice to have the option to buy them in a 'two pack' as I think they are a bit expensive. Hope they last.
3.0,Too small so returned
3.0,Thought it wouldn't look flimsy... it should be a lot thicker I wouldn't mind even paying more
3.0,Beautiful color. I love the design of the bottoms. But the top does not fit well. I wear a 36B and it was not fitting well. I thought the fit issues would be for women with D cups and above but they were not. Also I really don't like the tie back. A clasp would be better. Maybe I needed to take out the extra cups to make it fit better. I am going to bring with me on my next vacation and see if I can find a way to make it fit better.
3.0,Very cute but run very large.
3.0,Not what I expected  runs extremely small cut
3.0,"It's too small! I ordered a xxl thinking it will either fit just right or slightly large. I considered the belt so even if it's too big, .. it has a belt. Well, I tried it on, adorable! But then I try to zip it up and it wouldn't zip! Understand I'm aware I'm a ""larger"" person..I ordered honest sizing and it's just cut small. I wear a 2xl for a very slight loose fitting as I'm between sizes. Sad. I really want to keep it a little. It's adorable!!"
3.0,This runs large and the shoulder ruffles are huge! Returning.
3.0,The glasses work wonderfully for my toddler who happens to be obsessed with always wearing sunglasses. I wish they were a bit higher quality however.<br /><br />The flower pieces aren't additions instead they are part of the glasses mold and are painted on. That paint can be rubbed off. The hinges on glasses are very tight and you have to use some force to get them open the first 10-15 times or so.  On one pair one of the arms is a few centimeters away from the glasses frame while the other is spot on which makes them not fit quite right.  They however have not broken or shown any sign of easily breaking which is wonderful.<br /><br />The colors are beautiful however and my daughter absolutely loves the fact that one of the pairs are Broncos colors.  As parents we enjoy the fact that we gave have pairs in both of our vehicles and didn't have to spend an arm and a leg.<br /><br />I was given this product at a discount for this review.
3.0,It's too floppy. It fell down over my face so much I could not see. It was like wearing blinders.
3.0,"It looks good, but it doesn't stay as two strands on my neck they usually fuse into one."
3.0,They are super cute. Runs a little small. I am size 12 and ordered an XL. I even looked at the size chart and measured myself and it said I would be an XL. It wouldn’t go over my thick thighs. So I added some elastic and it looks perfect. It fits perfect around my waist and the length is perfect. It was just my thunder thighs. But it’s super cute.
3.0,These took a little longer to ship than I anticipated but the bracelet is very cute however the links that hook it on you wrist breaks easily.
3.0,"This Emiqude Henley was not as well made as I expected, based upon other items I got from Emiqude.<br /><br />Material:<br />I found it to be too shinny (pictures shows dull colors), like polyester that has a plastic like shine. It also felt average on your skin. I like to dress relaxed casual when I go out, so I fancied this shirt with a nice pair of pants for a weekend out. This shirt doesn't look good enough for a night out, a good gym/weekday run around shirt for sure though.<br /><br />Fit:<br />Everything from Emiqude that was Large, fit me - I'm always usually a Large. This shirt was too big, the sleeves were all the way down to my knuckles (good 3 inches too long). I think a Medium would fit me well, I recommend ordering a size smaller. Also I didn't like how the opening around the neck looked. It lay weird on me but it could just be that I have wide/flat shoulders. Perhaps if you have shoulders that gradually increase in height as you get to the neck, it will lay properly on you.<br /><br />Overall it's not a terrible shirt, the only reason I'm returning because the size is wrong. I think the material will lose it's shininess and become softer after a wash or two.<br /><br />Thank you Emiqude, who provided me a discount so I could review this item and give you my honest opinion. My reviews are unbiased because I too rely on YOUR honest reviews to help ME purchase things. If you found this review helpful & would like others to benefit from the information here, please click YES at the bottom."
3.0,"The pearl is beautiful and passes all the &#34;home tests&#34; for a real pearl. However I think the chain looks cheap. It is adjustable and looks vaguely like rope, no sheen, and just doesn't seem to fit the pearl."
3.0,"Dissapointed in the size.  It is MUCH smaller than in the photo shown as an example.  I purchased this for my husband and it will definitely need to go back.  He has other timex that fit great.  This is definitely not for Men.  Although, at this price I may let my 11 year old keep it."
3.0,"First of all, this bunny (black/grey spots) was shoddily made - short fur, stiff body. My daughter felt bad for it, and refused to let me return it. So we kept it for that reason, but I definitely do not recommend.<br />The light pink one came in today, and it is much better looking - fluffier, and softer. However, for those who don't pay attention - these bunnies are made with fake fur, not the real bunny hair (which I assumed it was), so they will not feel nearly as lush and smooth as the ones with real rabbit hair."
3.0,I carry this in my briefcase when traveling and use it to hold my purse and small cooler when I board a flight to reduce the number of carry-ons.  It's a fantastic size but it ripped around the zipper within about 5 flights.
3.0,It was a big too big on me. It's very stretchy too so order a size smaller than your usual size.
3.0,"They're okay but they slide off the ankle after 15-30 minutes and then you're left with a sock under your foot in your shoe, kind of uncomfortable"
3.0,I love the top. It fits great but it arrived with a stain on it. I'm going to try to get the stain out as I need it for an upcoming event.
3.0,"Super cute! We were very excited for these to arrive! They are really cute but we received the wrong size! I would have loved to keep them but they were so small, we couldn’t get my daughters foot in them."
3.0,"Makes boobs look like they’re halfway down your body, maybe because of the stripes? Cute shirt otherwise"
3.0,It’s okay for the price
3.0,"I usually wear L, but took XL and it's still too small. I am 6'4''<br />Quality itself is ok."
3.0,Cute but I thought they were plain white. They have iridescent simmer on the that I did not want
3.0,"It’s just ok. It wasn’t what I was expecting really and could not use it as I needed to. It made no sense so I returned it. But, it might be exactly what you need."
3.0,Shorter than other tanks I’ve ordered<br /> from them but still well made
3.0,"The pants, themselves, were very nice and I bought others, but didn't like the colors.  Onscreen, they appeared to be black and beige.  In person, they are black and a light khaki green.  Returned them but kept others."
3.0,For very light accidents. Not overnight like I tried to do with my daughter and woke up to a mess
3.0,It broke as I was trying to put it together. I guess it is still useable but annoying when it falls apart...
3.0,"The strap on the back fell apart on me after a few weeks, as a canine officer I need a hat that not falling off me."
3.0,"The shirt was not what I expected. I thought it was going to be more like a sweater material, but instead it is more like a generic polyester-blend. The graphic on it is really cool though!"
3.0,"Saw it on an ig person. thought it was cute, bought it and returned it. the t-shirt graphic didn't quite align with my body (if you know what i mean) I wasn't too crazy about the feel of the fabric, it felt cheap. I would've still kept it and worn it if the fit wasn't so wonky."
3.0,Plastic arm broke on me. I don't think I was hard on them. Only lasted a couple of weeks. Otherwise I really did like them
3.0,I didn't realize this was mostly spandex so I may be returning
3.0,"I attached a photo from the box showing shoe size to sock size comparison.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I wear a Men's 9.5 and bought L/XL. Most of the reviews I read made it seem like they run small, but I'm exchanging for S/M. They are compression socks, so they are supposed to fit tight and these fit like normal socks."
3.0,these are super soft and comfy but the sizes run large even if you measure your chest and torso to the chart... get a smaller size than you measure. mine are very loose im hoping they shrink in the wash.
3.0,They look like the pic.  It's heavy for me.  I got annoyed after 2hrs and took them off.  Good thing I only wore it for a dinner with the girls.  Some of the threads stray from the pattern but that wasn't a big deal.
3.0,"well. im giving this three stars instead of five, because although I am pleased with the overall product it self I am disappointed that I paid for two-day shipping and it took four days to get to me. very displeased with that BUT,  I guess it was worth the wait because I absoultely LOVE these glasses. I love how they fit my face and just the overall look of them."
3.0,I got it and was wondering if I even ORDERED it.it came in one long chain.i have to shape it to my arm myself.and it doesn't like to stay put.it unwinds by itself while wearing it.i like it but not easy to wear.
3.0,It's very thin but it's ok for the summer.
3.0,Some loose threads.
3.0,just got mine and they are too tight.
3.0,The hoodie is smaller than expected.  I do not like the fabric it is imprinted in.  It feels stretchy and doesn’t make it comfy for me
3.0,Super cute silhouette but too see thru for me.. sad to return!
3.0,"Runs small. Very short, like “Brittany Spears Oops pit the limo crotch shot” short."
3.0,"Giving three stars because it definitely runs very large. I wore a wig under it and it still was a bit loose in the chin. The ears also look a bit big to me. Overall, very comfortable to wear. Just be prepared for it to be loose if you don’t wear large hat sizes."
3.0,The sleeves make this a no go for me. They are too baggy and look ridiculous.
3.0,"My boyfriend loves this watch but their is a huge catch. I bought it for him for Christmas because it looks so incredible. He opened it up and has been in love with it ever since. The issue with it is that it won't keep time. He has to change it a few times a day to keep up. He loves it so much that he jokes &#34;my iPhone keeps great time, so I'm good&#34; but I imagine many people want a watch that is more reliable. If you want a watch that is very aesthetically pleasing and will get many, many compliments, this is your watch. If your goal is to use it to actually know what time it is, you may need to look elsewhere."
3.0,Good selection with cases for all.  But the glasses are too small for a standard eyeglass frame.<br />If you have small frames this is a nice selection.
3.0,"Ive used these panties on my periods in the last couple months. It’s not my favorite. It’s not very absorbent or breathable. Once the fabric gets wet from the leaks or sweating, it stays wet and the pantiliners wont stick to the wet fabric which makes it very uncomfortable to wear."
3.0,"This leather belt is a nice, neutral tan shade. I didn't think it was particularly &#34;skinny&#34; as it is about 1&#34; wide, my husband didn't seem to notice. It is labeled as &#34;Leather&#34; both on the tag and the embossed into the backside of the belt itself. The elegant, chrome buckle is sturdy and simple. We received a 36&#34; belt, which fit his 34&#34; waist well. The information does recommend &#34;for a great fit, select a belt at least 2 inches larger than your pant size,&#34; but I'm not sure that is necessary. This would look really nice with dress slacks (khaki and navy, especially!)  The price does seem a bit high for an unbranded item, but the belt has held up to my husband's rough daily use, so we can affirm the quality."
3.0,"I will have to use this anyway, however, the top hat was crushed when I received it."
3.0,"The pajamas are not bad but watch your sizing chart. I am 5'0"" and 140 pounds. I normally wear a medium in USA sizing. But these are Asian sizes. I ordered an XL in this and they JUST fit me! In fact they are a bit tight in the thighs and the stomach but I can wear them. I just hope they don't shrink too much. The material is nice and silky. But do not buy unless you are a smaller person. I truly would say no more than 150 pounds maximum. Order 2+ sizes up."
3.0,I have other products of the same size from this company that fit nicely. This item is WAY too big almost could be considered another size up. Especially in the arms
3.0,"Beautiful dress, but the wrong style was sent & the alternative style wasn't available, so I has ro have it refunded. I had ordered the style that zips up the back & not the one open cowl back style. If you're busy, order a size up. Material is a tad sheer so wese a slip. I ordered a medium. I'm 5'1"", 155lbs, 36DD & it was too small."
